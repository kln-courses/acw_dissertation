<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeol Oceania 41 (2006) 49-81 Mask Cave: Red-slipped pottery and the Australian-Papuan settlement of Zenadh Kes (Torres Strait) IAN J. McNIVEN, WILLIAM R. DICKINSON, BRUNO DAVID, MARSHALL WEISLER, FRIEDRICH VON GNIELINSKI, MELISSA CARTER and UGO ZOPPI Keywords: Torres Strait, island colonization, maritime specialization, pottery, Papua New Guinea Abstract Excavations at Mask Cave on the sacred islet of Pulu off Mabuyag in the central west of Zenadh Kes (Torres Strait) reveal four occupational phases: Phase 1 (2900-3800 years ago), Phase 2 (2100-2600 years ago), Phase 3 (1500-1700 years ago) and Phase 4 (last 1500 years). Faunal remains indicate marine specialization (turtle and fish) during all phases. Pétrographie analysis of sherds of finely made red-slipped pottery dating back 2400-2600 years reveals a unique fabric in terms of current understandings of Oceanic ceramic technologies. Mineral inclusions are consistent with local geology suggesting local manufacture and the existence of Indigenous Australia's first pottery tradition. Pre-ceramic Phase 1 is associated with demographic expansions across the western islands of Zenadh Kes by local populations of marine-based hunter-gatherers who were primarily Aboriginal language speakers. Phase 2 is associated with the immigration of Papuan maritime, horticultural and pottery-making peoples to the eastern and western islands of Zenadh Kes commencing 2600 years ago. Australian then Papuan settlement expansions across the western islands of Zenadh Kes explain why the local Western-Central Language has an Aboriginal base with a Papuan overlay. First colonization of the eastern islands by Papuans explains why the local Meriam Mir language is Papuan. Early red-slipped pottery in Zenadh Kes is linked to southern coastal Papuan pottery traditions that are reassessed to have a comparable 2600 year antiquity. Papuan settlement of the southern Papuan coast and Zenadh Kes was an extension of the post-Lapita settlement of the Pacific, an event memorialized in part by Torres Strait Islander oral tradition. In the central western part of Zenadh Kes1 is a small granite boulder-strewn islet called Pulu (Figure 1). The islet is located 300m off the west coast of the residential island of Mabuyag2, home to the Goemulgal (people of Mabuyag). Pulu is a sacred place, revered by the Goemulgal and their neighours today as much as it was when Alfred Haddon and other members of the famous 'Cambridge Anthropological Expedition to Torres Straits' were escorted to the great kod (ceremonial complex) at the northern end of the islet by Mabuyag Elders in October 1898. Haddon was also taken up the ridge behind the kod to a rocksheiter known as Awgadhalkula ('Augadalkula'). For as long as Goemulgaw oral history recalls, Awgadhalkula has been their most sacred site and the place where the sacred emblems of the culture hero Kuiam resided, keeping watch over the more than 80 skulls and jaws of decapitated warriors from enemy neighbours. Today many of these skulls rest patiently in boxes in the British Museum another world away. Haddon had an intense interest in the history and migrations of the world's 'races' and this interest extended to Torres Strait Islanders, a people that for him were positioned curiously along the frontier of the Papuan 'race' to the north (New Guinea) and the Aboriginal 'race' to the south (mainland Australia) (Haddon 1909). But despite months of fieldwork in Zenadh Kes and visiting numerous islands and countless cultural sites, Haddon believed the archaeological potential of Zenadh Kes was minimal: 'Unfortunately, I was unable to discover anything concerning the archaeology of the Torres Straits Islands. ... I consider it improbable that much will ever be found to illustrate the former condition of the people. . . . There never has been any pottery' (Haddon 1890: 303). Alternatively, the long-term cultural history of Torres Strait Islanders was to be accessed largely through reading beyond the metaphorical dimensions of their oral traditions and origins stories. But had Haddon continued walking along the ridge for 100m past Awgadhalkula on Pulu, he would have come across a cave that may have changed his view of the archaeological potential of Zenadh Kes. 1.

Study area showing sites mentioned in text. On the 17 August 1998, 100 years after Haddon's team visited Pulu, one of us (IM) was accompanied to Pulu by Mabuyag Elders. Unlike Haddon's visit a century earlier, the cave past Awgadhalkula was visited (Figure 2). Exposed across the cave surface were found flaked stone artefacts and scattered fragments of marine shell and marine turtle bone. The most recent evidence of use was a broken bottle, a rusty piece of metal (possibly a large knife blade), and a matchbox tin, all probably dating to the late 19th/early 20th century. The most striking feature of the site was a large face or 'mask' painted with red ochre located on the western roof of the cave (Figure 3). The face has stylistic similarities to the low-relief carved faces on Gope boards of the Papuan Gulf (see Lewis 1973; Newton 1961). On a subsequent visit to the site on 1 May 2000 by senior members of the Mabuyag community (Colin Bani, John Bani, John Mooka, Cygnet Repu, Terrence Whap and John Whop), IM (then University of Melbourne), BD (Monash University), Garrick Hitchcock (then Native Title Office, Thursday Island), and John Brayer (University of New Mexico), two small, thin, weathered pottery sherds (both with remnant red slip) were found amongst a lag deposit of stone artefacts associated with a c.20cm-deep erosion channel running through the middle of the site. The significance of the finds was recognized immediately. The sherds were the first examples of Indigenous pottery recorded for western Zenadh Kes - pottery being unknown ethnographically for Zenadh Kes (Gill 1874: 218; Haddon 1912: 122). These sherds appeared similar to pottery excavated two years earlier by Melissa Carter from the Murray Islands of eastern Zenadh Kes and pointed to the existence of an ancient and forgotten trans-Zenadh Kes pottery tradition. It was assumed that the pottery entered Zenadh Kes from ethnographically and archaeologic- ally-known pottery producers of southeastern Papua New Guinea through a previously unknown west- ern extension of the Papuan Gulf pottery trading system (e.g. Bickler 1997). Thus, both rock-art and pottery at Mask Cave pointed to possible ancient cultural connections between the central western islands of Zenadh Kes and Papua New Guinea. If Haddon and his Mabuyag escorts had been present with us that day they would surely have been impressed with what we found at Mask Cave, because they knew Torres Strait Islander oral histories point to New Guinea peoples to the east as the first migrants to many of the islands of Zenadh Kes. And after 100 years of archaeological scholarship across northern Australia, New Guinea and the Pacific, we also knew Mask Cave had the potential to yield fundamentally new insights into Goemulgaw history and perhaps into Torres Strait Islander origins. In this paper, we Figure 2.

To set the scene for appreciating the significance of the site, we begin by outlining previous understandings of Torres Strait Islander origins, first from Torres Strait Islanders themselves (oral traditions), followed by the work of outside researchers (anthropologists and archaeologists). Figure 3. Anthropomorphic face ('mask') painting at Mask Cave (black and white conversion from a computer enhanced digital photo - see Brady et al. 2004 for technical details). Torres Strait Islander origins Oral traditions According to some Murray Islanders in the Eastern Group, the 'original settlers of Mer' (Murray Island) were Pop and Kod from the 'Fly River district of New Guinea' to the northeast of Zenadh Kes (Haddon 1908: 19; see also Lawrie 1970: 303). An alternative version of the story tells how after arriving on Mer, Pop (a man) fashioned a 'mate' from white clay in the form of a female dugong with two legs (Haddon 1935: 103-4). Another tradition tells of the first settlers of the eastern islands of Mer and Erub as three women castaways from 'New Guinea' and men from New Guinea who had gone looking for them. On Mer, 4[o]ther people [subsequently] came to the island', apparently also from New Guinea (Haddon 1935: 102; Laade 1968: 142). Origin narratives have been published for the three islands of Dauan, Saibai and Boigu (Top Western Group). The first man of Dauan was Kogea who lived in a 'cave' where he continues to reside in the form of a large snake (see Laade 1971: 54-9; Lawrie 1970: 139-42 and Wirz 1932: 292-93 for details). Kogea settled on Dauan after traveling across the sea from the east, possibly from Kiwai Island. The first man of Saibai was Melawal (see Haddon 1904: 27; Laade 1968: 142; 1971: 12-4; Lawrie 1970: 153-60). He lived underground in a baler shell which suggests that 'he came from the sea' according to one of Laade's informants (Laade 1971: 12). The second man, Budia, 'came from the west, nobody knows from where' (Laade 1971 : 12). Another of Laade's informants suggested Budia came from the 'other side [of] New Guinea, might be Malayo country' ( 1 97 1 : 13). 'These two men have quite a mythical character' and lived on the western end of the island (Laade 1968: 142). The next immigrants, settling at Ait village on the eastern end of Saibai, came from the Pahoturi River district of the adjacent Papuan coast (Laade 1968: 144). On Boigu, Laade (1968: 145-6; 1971: 84-6) was informed that while a man named Boigu was the first inhabitant of the island, the island was visited subsequently by a canoe crewed by 'Maori' (a likely generic term for 'Polynesians' according to Laade). Three of the crew stayed behind (a woman and two men) while the 'Maori chief went back again with the rest of the crew)'. The first children of Boigu were fathered by the two Maori men (cf. Ingui and Toby 1991: 2; Lawrie 1970: 207-8). At a more general level, Laade (1968: 148) distilled the following oral tradition on Torres Strait Islander origins related to him by the Rev. Seriba Sagigi of Badu island in the Western Group: "Pacific men come to Torres Strait Island and married New Guinea women. That's how these islands got population. The Pacific men traveled first up to New Guinea coast, Maori, (men from) Tonga, Fiji." Specifying the origin of the migrants does not mean much; Seriba simply gives some names familiar to him. Then he continued, (When some of the newcomers had obtained women they left New Guinea). "First people they dropped at Parema. Leave one man on Saibai (allusion to Melawal), two at Gebar, three at Mabuiag." Rev. Sagigi's narrative continues, documenting subsequent settlement of various islands of the Central Group (Laade 1968: 149; see also Lawrence 1989: 103-5). Landtman (1917: 366) recorded a story from coastal Papuans opposite Zenadh Kes relating how Mua and Murulag islands of the Western Group were settled by people from Daru island (located off the Papuan coast) who headed south fleeing Kiwai Papuan raiders. In a related sense, Lawrence (1989: 103) recorded a story from 'the olden days' on Daru of how Zenadh Kes was settled by people who 'ran away' from the adjacent southern Papuan coast. 51</page><page sequence="4">Early anthropological and archaeological speculations Prior to major archaeological excavations in Zenadh Kes during the 1980s, modeling of local culture history was based upon local oral traditions, racial categorizations, and broader linguistic and material culture affiliations. The first hypothetical, long-term culture history model for Zenadh Kes was presented by Alfred Haddon (1935: 275-78, 4 ΙΟ- Ι 4; cf. Rivers 1926: 161). Using a racialised migrationist theoretical framework employed typically by late 19th century scholars to understand Aboriginal origins (see McNiven and Russell 2005: Chap 4), Haddon suggested the Western Group was populated by an 'ancient stock' that may have come across from northwestern Australia during a period of lower sea level (1935: 276, 410). After sea level rise and island formation, peoples from the Papuan mainland southwest of the Fly River mouth moved into the islands of western and eastern Zenadh Kes. Finally, peoples from the Fly River 'estuary' mixed with Islanders from western Zenadh Kes. Significantly, Haddon (1935: 278) speculated on Austronesian influences in the Strait: The cultural traits that Austronesian-speaking peoples brought from Indonesia to New Guinea on their way to Melanesia have spread over a considerable part of that island. By secondary diffusions, whatever routes they took or whatever modifications they underwent, some of these traits reached the southern coasts of New Guinea and influenced the Torres Strait islanders. The strong New Guinea elements in Haddon's migration model was clearly based on his (generally valid) observation that 'physically the islanders are Papuans and can be easily distinguished from Australians' (Haddon 1935: 410). While Haddon saw his New Guinea origins model as consistent with the 'Papuan' language of the Eastern Group and the oral tradition of Pop and Kod (see above), the 'Australian' language of the Western Group indicated 'an ancient ethnic movement' that required 'further investigation' (Haddon 1935: 410). The next hypothetical culture history model, advanced by Jack Golson (1972: 384-89), posited that after formation of Zenadh Kes some 6500 years ago, the western Strait became a 'marginal area of Aboriginal occupation' with 'residential and seasonally visited islands', thus 'ensuring the survival of the traditional populations of the area and the persistence of their hunter-gatherer way of life'. The descendants of the subsequent influx of Melanesian seafaring peoples with a 'horticultural economy' is found with Papuan language speakers of the Eastern Group, and the mixed Aboriginal- Papuan language of the Western Group (who subsequently expanded northwards and eastwards to settle the Top Western and Central Groups respectively). This Melanesian maritime settlement of Zenadh Kes was linked with the broader colonization of Melanesian islands by peoples using double-outrigger canoes. As these early maritime peoples were thought to use pigs, a date for this maritime expansion (including into Zenadh Kes) was put at 5000-6000 years ago based on the then apparent age of pig bones in the Papua New Guinea Highlands. A second Melanesian maritime migration event dated 2000-3000 years ago involving Austronesian speakers using single-outrigger canoes was thought to reach Zenadh Kes around 2000 years ago based on the earliest pottery dates for the adjacent southern Papuan coast (cf. Allen 1972; Vanderwal 1973). Austro- nesian influence in Zenadh Kes was demonstrated in part by Austronesian words for canoe outrigger floats amongst the non- Austronesian languages of Zenadh Kes, Cape York, and Fly River delta (Golson 1972: 392-94). David Moore (1979: 308-13) followed Golson, adding that in more recent times further Papuan migrants moved south into the Central Group (to speak a dialect of the Western-Central language - a.k.a. Kala Lagaw Ya) and Eastern Group. Haddon, Golson and Moore relied heavily on the relative degrees of Australian and Papuan linguistic elements within the two major languages of Zenadh Kes. Detailed analysis of Zenadh Kes languages by Wurm (1972), building on the foundational research of Ray (1907), confirmed that Islanders of the Eastern Group spoke a 'typical Papuan language' (referred to as Meriam or Meriam Mir) that belongs to the Eastern Trans-Fly language family of the adjacent Papuan coast. In contrast, Islanders from the Western, Top Western and Central Groups spoke an 'Australian language apparently adopted by speakers of an originally Papuan language'. The 'Australian influence on Miriam [sic] is negligible', while the Papuan influence on Cape York Aboriginal languages is 'relatively superficial' (Wurm 1972: 349, 356). To account for these linguistic arrangements, Wurm (1972: 364) posited that when Papuan peoples moved southwards into Zenadh Kes within the last few thousand years, they found the eastern islands uninhabited, while movement into the western islands was more complex as 'on at least some of the[se] islands' were peoples who spoke an Australian language. Recent archaeological understandings and limitations David et al. (2004) provide the first long-term chronological framework for the human history of Zenadh Kes based on local excavation results. Badu 15 rocksheiter on the island of Badu in the Western Group reveals a stone artefact sequence representing 'three phases of island use and occupation'. A lower phase dated 6000-&gt;8000 BP indicates 'the presence of resident populations on Badu at a time when Badu was separating from the mainland as post- glacial sea levels rose' (David et al 2004: 72). A middle phase with 'sporadic' artefacts dated between 3500 and 6000 BP is associated with 'low level use (likely fleeting visitation)' by people venturing 'from the Australian mainland' (David et al 2004: 72, 75). An upper phase dated 3000/3500 BP with higher artefact concentrations and 'sustained cultural deposits and heightened sedimentation rates' signals a return of 'resident populations' linked to an 'influx of people from the north or northeast' of 'Papuo- Austronesian' origin (David et al 2004: 74, 76). In broad terms, this three phase occupation model is consistent with occupational phasing hypothesised by Golson (1972) and Moore (1979). 52</page><page sequence="5">The case for substantial Austronesian influences followed recent linguistic work revealing considerably more Austronesian influences in local languages than previously thought (Mitchell 1995). Such findings support previous hypotheses for Austronesian influences in Zenadh Kes advanced by Haddon (1935), Golson (1972) and Moore (1979). David et al. (2004: 76) note that 'colonisation of Torres Strait is unlikely to have taken place long after initial Austronesian seafaring began in southeastern Papua.' They suggest further that these early Austronesian links are revealed by the 'presence of red-slip ceramics in low numbers at various sites across Torres Strait' (2004: 76). However, Carter (2004: 340) questions this link, pointing out that earliest available dates for pottery in Zenadh Kes at 2000 BP (Eastern Group) matches the earliest dated ceramic assemblages from the Papuan Gulf which are linked to immigration of Austronesian speakers from island Melanesia (Allen 1972: 121; Vanderwal 1973: 233). Carter (2004: 340-41) concludes that it is more likely that 'the occupation of Torres Strait not only pre-dated the Austronesian expansion into southern Papua, but also occurred entirely independent of this event'. Badu 15 revealed no faunal remains, thus precluding insights into subsistence activities. As such, it shed little light on the apparent widespread development of midden deposits (and associated maritime specialization) across Zenadh Kes that had independently been argued to start 2500 BP (Barham 2000). In addition, no radiocarbon dates are available at Badu 15 for the last 3000 years BP (the upper 11cm has not been dated). Thus, two issues remain unresolved in our new understandings of Zenadh Kes colonization. First, the historical relationship between 'colonisation' events of 3500 BP and the onset of major midden development and marine specialization at 2500 BP. Figure 4. Mask Cave site map. Second, the mismatch between the suggestion of 3500 BP Austronesian influences into Zenadh Kes (David et ai 2004) and the more temporally restricted and well-accepted timeframe of 2000 BP for Austronesian expansions along the southern Papuan coast. It is in this connection that excavations at Mask Cave on Pulu islet in western Zenadh Kes shed fundamentally new insights into the history of Zenadh Kes and southern Papua New Guinea. Figure 5. Cygnet Repu and John Bani of Mabuyag excavating Pits A and B, Mask Cave, October 2002. 'Mask' painting at top left (Photo: Ian McNiven). Mask Cave: excavations and stratigraphy Mask Cave is an elevated granite boulder supported by two major granite bedrock 'pillars'. The flat-roofed cave today has low average headroom of 1 .5m with a parallel sediment and granite rock floor sloping downwards to the north (Figures 2, 4 and 5). Two trenches located 3m apart were excavated to sample deposits from different sections of the site (Figure 4). The west trench comprised four contiguous pits - Pits A, B and E (each 50 χ 50cm in area) and Pit F (50 χ 30cm in area) - excavated to a maximum depth of 1 12 cm below the surface. The east trench comprised two contiguous 70 χ 70cm pits (Pits C and D) and was excavated to a maximum depth of 1 1 lem. In total, 2037kg (1572 litres) of deposit divided into 266 spits or Excavations Units (XUs) averaging 2.3cm in thickness were excavated (Figure 5). Sediment samples were taken for all XUs. Elevations, recorded for the beginning and end of each XU, totaled over 1000 for both trenches. A datum point was established on the highest point of an exposed granite boulder at the centre of the site (Figure 4). The northwest corner of Pit C is 156mm below the datum while the southeast corner of Pit A is 143mm below datum. As such, the surface of both trenches is on roughly the same horizontal plane. The consolidated nature of sediments made excavation physically difficult. All excavated sediments were dry sieved through 3mm mesh (measured on diagonal). For the purposes of this paper, investigation focuses on Pit A, the deepest, oldest and best-dated cultural sequence recovered from the site. Dating and preliminary analysis of cultural 53</page><page sequence="6">materials from the other squares appear consistent with Square A findings. Both trenches revealed broadly similar stratigraphies, albeit with different erosional structures reflecting topographic and water runoff variations across the site. The resulting complex stratigraphy is summarized as follows. Excavated sediments were divided into three major lithostratigraphic units (SUs) (Figures 6 and 7). Basal sediments (SU3) rest on granite bedrock across much of both trenches. They comprise pale brown (10YR 6/3), slightly acidic (pH = 5.0-5.5), fine-grained to coarse-grained granitic sediments (subdivided into SU3a and SU3b respectively in Pits C and D) with few granite rock inclusions and tabular fragments of granite roof fall. Sediments were mostly highly consolidated and difficult to excavate. Sediments exhibit scattered fibrous roots and the occasional larger root (maximum diameter = 5mm). The upper surface of SU3 in Pits Α, Β, Ε and F is undulating, probably as a result of subsequent erosional events associated with water runoff through the northwest sections of the cave. This erosion is most obvious in the c.25cm-deep channel feature that runs through the lower sections of Pits E, A and F (see south section of Pits A and E, east section of Pit A, and north section of Pit F in Figure 6). The northeast side of this channel is decomposing granite bedrock that represents the now buried sections of the western bedrock support 'pillar'. As such, this channel runs along the southwest edge of this 'pillar' . Prior to removal (erosion) of sediments with formation of this channel, SU3 in Pit A was at least 60cm thick. While SU3 in Pits C and D is culturally sterile, SU3 in Pits Α, Β, Ε and F contains a low number of flaked stone artefacts and small, dispersed fragments of bone and charcoal. SU2 is similar in form and texture to SU3 and is located above most of SU3 in the west trench. It represents a brown (10YR 5/3), slightly acidic (pH = 5.5), coarser-grained granitic sediment, ranging from consolidated to highly consolidated (subdivided into SU2a and SU2b respectively), with scattered fibrous roots and the occasional larger root (maximum diameter = 6mm), and few granite rock inclusions and tabular fragments of granite roof fall. The surface of SU2 is largely flat and parallels the surface topography of the cave. The major exception is another major channel feature located in Pits E, A, and F. Here SU2a sediments filled and buried the large channel feature in SU3 but subsequent erosion removed much of this fill to create a new, c.40cm-deep channel also running along the southwestern edge of the granite bedrock 'pillar'. As with SU3, SU2 contains a low number of flaked stone artefacts and small, dispersed fragments of bone and charcoal. SUI forms the major culture-bearing deposit of the site. In the west trench SUI sits above SU2 whereas in the east trench SUI sits upon culturally-sterile SU3 sediments (SU2 not represented in the east trench). The base of the unit varies from 35cm below the surface (Pit A) to more than 90cm (base of Pit F), and consists of consolidated, granitic sediments that range in texture from gritty (SUlb) to coarse grained (SU le). Colour is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) grading to grayish brown (10YR 5/2) and brown (10YR 5/3) with depth. Sediment is slightly acidic (pH = 5.0-5.5) with neutral sediments (pH = 6.0-6.5) within 5cm of the surface. Numerous fibrous roots occur through the deposit, along with a low number of larger roots (maximum diameter = 36mm). Loose and often powdery sediments forming the surface l-2cm of the deposit were designated SU la. SUI filled and buried the c.40-deep channel feature cut through SU2 sediments (Pits E, A and F) and continued to accumulate a further 40-60cm of deposit on top of SU2. SUI contains scattered fragments of granite roof fall in marked contrast to SUs 2 and 3. Flaked stone artefacts and fragments of marine animal bone, charcoal, and ochre form the moderate to high-density cultural deposit. Significantly in terms of this paper, 14 small pieces of pottery were found in Pits A, E and F scattered from the base of SUI to near the surface of the deposit. Stratigraphie integrity and disturbance Overall, the stratigraphie integrity of sediments is good. Stratigraphie breaks were generally well-defined with mixing restricted to the interface of SUs 1 and 2 along the sides of the channel feature where fine-grained SUI sediments appear to have impregnated and discoloured (most likely while in solution with rainfall runoff) adjacent gravelly SU2 sediments (see Figure 6). Most tabular fragments of granite roof fall were oriented horizontally. No termite burrows were encountered despite existence of a low termite mound located 0.7m south of Pit Β (Figure 4). Apart from shrub roots, the only post-depositional disturbance recorded during excavation was a low number of 3-4cm diameter linear voids (short tunnels) within SUs 1 and 2. While these voids tended to be intact, well-defined and hollow, small sections exhibited minor refill that were excavated separately and discarded. The structural integrity of the voids was enhanced by the highly consolidated nature of the surrounding sediments. Many of these voids may represent tunnels left by roots given live roots up to 36mm in diameter were encountered during excavation. No evidence was observed of tunnel use by rodents (e.g. fecal pellets). Essentially all of the voids were recorded across the lower half of SUI (35-75cm below the surface) in the west trench. All tunnels were oriented either horizontal or with a minor slope. This orientation is consistent with lateral pene- tration of roots emanating from shrubs located immediately beyond the site. Thus, for items to move from upper level voids to lower level voids would require a considerable zigzag journey across metres horizontally that extended well beyond the area of the excavation pits. The generally hollow and horizontal state of most voids indicates that while they may have facilitated short-distance (measured in cm) post- depositional horizontal displacement of some small cultural materials, the potential for vertical displacement of cultural materials is considered minor and small scale. Other post- depositional disturbance is considered unlikely given the highly consolidated nature of sediments. 54</page><page sequence="7">Figure 6.

Radiocarbon dates were calibrated using Calib 5.0.2 (Southern Hemisphere) (Stuiver and Reimer 1993; Stuiver et al 2005). Calibrated dates expressed as 'years ago' (i.e. calBP or years before AD 1950) for Mask Cave, as with all sites discussed in this paper, represent approximates based upon the midpoint of the highest probability 1 sigma calibrated age range rounded to the nearest 50 years. As such, all dates expressed as 'years ago' should be prefixed with circa. Four major phases of occupation have been identified for Mask Cave (Table 3). The age range of phases has been rounded to the nearest 100 years to emphasise the temporal generality of each phase. Phase 1 is revealed only in the west trench while Phases 2-4 are found in both the east and west trenches. Delineation of phases is based on date clusters and hiatuses (Figure 8), SU and changes in cultural materials (see below).

Calibrated AMS radiocarbon dates for Mask Cave (Black = 1 sigma range; White = 2 sigma range). BP) was obtained for Pit C (XU5) at a depth of 5-7cm below the surface. The most recent date for the site is 200 years ago (218±38 BP) at a depth of l-3cm below the surface in Pit C (XU3). As Phase 3 commences immediately below these dates, little occupation of the site appears to have taken place 1000-1500 years ago. (SUI) Phase 3: 1500-1700 years ago Below the 7cm-deep Phase 4 surface sediments, the upper 20cm of SUI sediments in Pits E and A produced dates of 1450 years ago (1640±50 BP) and 1650 years ago (1818+42 BP) respectively. Identical dates of 1450 years ago (1652±45 BP) and 1650 years ago (1824±36 BP) were obtained for the upper 25cm of SUI sediments in Pit C, with a date of 1700 years ago (1843+31 BP) from a depth of 35cm below the surface in Pit D. As the next-oldest date at Mask Cave is 2050 years ago (see below), it is clear that the only major pulse of activity at the site between 1000 and 2000 years ago occurred between 1450 and 1700 years ago (rounded to 1500-1700 years ago in terms of defining Phase 3 chronology). (SUI) Phase 2: 2100-2600 years ago Two dates for the lower sections of SUI in Pits A (XU22a) and E (XU27a) 67-79cm below the surface in the west trench are 2450 years ago (2507±42 BP) and 2400 years ago (2460±50 BP) respectively. This chronology matches results for SUI from the east trench with a date of 2350 years ago (2364±41 BP) (Sq C, XU22b) from 61-65cm below the surface and a date of 2550 years ago (2582±32 BP) (Sq D, XU24a) from 72cm below the surface. The 2550 date is important as it comes from a 3-D plotted charcoal fragment recovered from the base of SUI. This date is the only truly basal date available for SUI at Mask Cave and provides a reliable maximum age for SUI and Phase 2 as sediments underlying this date in the east trench are culturally sterile and virtually charcoal free. As such, it is likely that the undated basal 5- 10cm of sediments of SUI in the west trench similarly date to 2500-2600 years ago. The near basal date of 2507±42 BP from SUI of Pit A accommodates the 2600 year ago timeframe at one standard deviation (2363- 2696 calBP). Two dates for upper level sediments of SUI 22-35cm below the surface in Pit A are 2450 years old (2494±36 BP [XU9]) and 2400 years old (2400±60 BP [XU1 1]). The next youngest date of 2200 years ago (2280±50 BP) comes from near the base of SUI in Pit F (XU30), which overlaps at one standard deviation with the date of 2350 years ago from the lower sections of SUI in Pit C. A date of 2190±70 BP (2100 years ago) from 24-27cm below the surface (Pit E, XU12) is designated the top of Phase 2. A near-identical date of 2160±60 BP (2050 years ago) from the base of SUI in Pit A (XU23a) is considered to be stratigraphically anomalous. The tiny charcoal fragment (0.08g) used for dating most likely was vertically displaced during excavation from upper levels given it is at the base of SUI and has three dates in the range 2400-2450 years ago located above it. The nine 14C dates for Phase 2 span the period 2050-2550 years ago (rounded to 2100-2600 years ago in terms of defining phase chronology), with an age cluster 2400-2450 years ago (n=4). As dates in this cluster are spread vertically through most of Phase 2, it is likely that most of this phase 58</page><page sequence="11">similarly dates to this restricted timeframe. As such, while Phase 2 spans 500 years, most activity took place in less than a century 2400-2500 years ago. (SUs 2 &amp;3) Phase 1: 2900-3800 years ago SU3, forming the oldest cultural deposits excavated at the site in Pit A, produced two statistically indistinguishable basal dates that confirm establishment of the site 3750 years ago: 3540±50 BP (XU26) and 3520±48 BP (XU27). A 3D-plotted charcoal fragment from near the top of SU3 in Pit A, just below the interface with SU2, produced a date of 3500 years ago (3318±37 BP). As such, the 60cm of SU3 sediments located within the lower sections of Pit A built up rapidly over a period of approximately 250 years. Since XU26 of Pit A contained 11 stone artefacts and XU27 (forming the basal 8.3cm of Pit A) revealed only a single tiny (0.3g) stone artefact, XU26 marks the commencement of unambiguous occupation of Mask Cave. While no direct dates are available for SU2 (represented only in the west trench), it is clear that cultural sediments accumulated sometime between 3500 years ago (upper levels of SU3) and 2600 years ago (base of SUI and Phase 2). Two stratigraphically anomalous dates from the middle sections of SUI provide insight into the likely age of upper level sediments of SU2. A date of 2900 years ago (2860±40 BP) was obtained on a 0.1 lg charcoal fragment from Pit F (XU 17) at a depth of 40-43cm below the surface, while an older date of 3250 years ago (3080±40 BP) was obtained on a 0.03g charcoal fragment from Pit E (XU20) at a slightly deeper depth of 46-49cm below the surface. Although both dates are anomalously too old for SUI, they are within the expected age range of SU2. It is likely that the single tiny charcoal fragments used for each date were reworked stratigraphically sideways (possibly through water erosion). As such, the date of 2900 years ago equates to the top of SU2 while the date of 3250 years ago equates to the middle sections of SU2. This horizontal mixing is represented stratigraphically by the zone of 'mixed' sediments along the steeply-sloping interface of SUs lb and 2a in Pits A and E (Figure 6). As such, SU3 is considered to date mostly between 3500 and 3800 years ago and SU2 is dated between 2900 and 3500 years ago (rounded to 2900-3800 years ago in terms of defining Phase 1 chronology). Chronologically anomalous dates Two of the 26 charcoal dates are considered chronologically anomalous outliers in terms of the phases of occupation constructed above. They are a date of 5240±50 BP (5950 years ago) from a depth of 49-52cm below the surface in SUI (Pit F, XU20) (west trench) and a date of 4457±36 BP (4900 years ago) from a similar depth of 50-55cm below the surface in SUI (Pit C, XU19) (east trench). The similar stratigraphie context of both dates in the middle of SUI sediments, albeit in different trenches, is consistent with synchronous in- washing of old charcoal from similarly aged sediments eroding either within the rocksheiter (see below) or beyond the rocksheiter further upslope. It is unlikely the charcoal represents the result of post-depositional upward movement of charcoal from deeper and older (unexcavated) sediments within the rocksheiter as such movement implies major disturbance on a scale not documented at the site. As noted above, no voids occur in SU3 in either trench, while SU3 in Pits C and D is culturally sterile with only minute traces of charcoal. In- washing of charcoal eroded from older sediments is the most likely explanation for another anomalous charcoal fragment dated 3700 years ago (3514±37 BP) recovered from the middle of SUI in Sq C. The in-washing of anomalously old charcoal at Mask Cave is not unexpected given that it took place during intensive occupation and rapid sedimentation of the site in Phase 2 (particularly 2400-2500 years ago) when déstabilisation of sediments surrounding the site (from vegetation disturbance through landscape burning and treadage) and subsequent erosion through rainfall runoff, would be expected. Culturally sterile basal deposits The near absence of cultural materials in XU27 in Pit A (forming the basal 8.3cm of the west trench) suggests a mixed (and transitional) deposit of cultural and pre-cultural sediments. However, a dramatically different situation presents itself in the east trench. Here the lower 30-50cm of deposit (SU3) is culturally sterile. In marked contrast, SU3 in the west trench (located across a similar depth range within the site to SU3 in the east trench) is clearly cultural. As the sedimentary matrix of sediments for SU3 in both trenches is visually indistinguishable, the simplest explanation for differences in the cultural status of each is that SU3 in the east trench (Pits C and D) was deposited before SU3 was deposited in the west trench (Pits Α, Β, Ε and F). In other words, SU3 in the east trench is older than 3800 years and was present when people first began using the site about 3800 years ago. Yet it would be expected that SU2 cultural materials dated 2900-3500 years ago would have been deposited across the top of SU3 in the east trench given that similarly aged cultural materials were deposited in the site 3m away in the area of the west trench. This curious absence may indicate removal by erosion given both SUs 2 and 3 in the west trench exhibit considerable evidence for erosion and removal of sediments (cf. channel features). Cultural materials Cultural materials excavated from Mask Cave include fragments of bone, charcoal, marine shell, crustacean shell (exoskeleton), ochre, pumice and pottery, along with flaked stone artefacts. Chronological changes in the density of cultural materials within Pit A are shown in Figure 9. Pit A is most informative in terms of revealing chronological changes in use of these materials because it exhibits the 59</page><page sequence="12">deepest and oldest sequence within the site and the most stratigraphically consistent set of radiocarbon dates. Figure 9 was prepared using TILIA and TILIAGRAPH (Grimm 1987, 1991). Two forms of cluster analysis expressed as dendrograms using the program CONISS were undertaken for finds between XUs. The first (CONISS - unconstrained) compared XUs independent of depth. The second (CONISS - constrained) compared XUs taking into consideration the ordering of XUs with depth. Both cluster analyses were undertaken independently of Phases and SUs. The unconstrained analysis reveals a major clustering for Phase 1 (SUs 2 and 3) compared to broad-scale clustering of Phases 2 to 4 (SUI). In other words, a major division in cultural items exists at the site between lower levels dated 2900-3800 years ago and upper levels dated within the last 2600 years. The constrained analysis reveals a major clustering tripartite division between Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phases 3 and 4. The highest-order bipartite cluster division is between Phases 3 and 4 (&lt;1700 years ago), and Phases 1 and 2 (2100-3800 years ago). This separation reinforces the distinctiveness of major changes taking place within the last 1700 years. Subsistence All of the identifiable faunal remains from Pit A are marine animals. The only exception is 0.1 g of land snail shell recovered from XU2. Shellfish Four pieces of marine shell (5.5g) were recovered from Pit A, restricted to XUs 1 and 2 (i.e. the upper lem of deposit in Phase 4) (Figure 9). The three pieces from XU1 represent an Anadara sp. valve, a nearly complete Pyrene sp. shell, and a small fragment (possibly from an Anadara sp. valve). All of these shells are available from tidal flats (including reefs flats) in the area of Pulu islet. While Anadara sp. (mudu) are a well-known food item across western Zenadh Kes (McNiven and Hitchcock 2004: 158), the Pyrene sp. gastropod shell is small and unlikely to have had subsistence significance. Alternatively, as a small gastropod it may have formed a decorative attachment to an item of material culture such as a body adornment, an ethnographically known practice across Zenadh Kes (e.g. Haddon 1912: 41-2; Moore 1984: 69, Plate 34). The restriction of nearly all excavated marine shells at Mask Cave to the upper 2cm of deposit suggests strongly that such items date to the last 1000 years. The general lack of shellfish remains at the site is unlikely to be due to poor preservation given the preservation of more fragile faunal remains such as small fish bones through the sequence (see below). Crustacea Two small fragments of crustacean exoskeleton were recovered from XU5 (O.lg) and XU21a (O.lg). While such remains are highly susceptible to decay, the recovery of small fish bones suggests that poor preservation is not an issue and that crustácea were consumed rarely at Mask Cave. Marine vertebrates A total of 217.0g of bone was recovered from Pit A. Major changes occur in the quantity of bone deposited through the sequence (Figure 9). Most (83%) marine vertebrate bone (by weight) was recovered from Phase 2 dating 2100-2600 years ago. A major isolated peak in XU1, as with the rock rubble peak, reflects erosion and development of a lag deposit of water-worn bone. Very little bone was deposited within the site during the last 1500 years. Within the deeper 2900-3800 year old deposits (Phase 1), highest concentrations of bone occur in the upper sections of SU2 and base of SU3. The taxonomic status of nearly a third (32%) of the bone assemblage was determined. Most of the bone by weight is dugong (29%), followed by fish (2%) and marine turtle (1%). Bones of neither bird nor terrestrial reptile were identified. All remaining bone was categorised as either 'larger (marine) vertebrate' (66%) or 'smaller vertebrate' (2%). Dugong Two fragments of dugong {Dugong dugon) (dhangal, Western-Central Language) were identified: a large rib fragment (53.2g) from XU11 and a vertebral spinal process fragment (9.2g) from XU13 (Figure 9). The rib was lying horizontal and clearly was in primary depositional context. As both fragments were recovered from the middle sections of SUI in Phase 2, they date to 2400-2500 years ago. However, it remains possible that some of the fragments of iarger vertebrate' bone recovered from other levels of the site are dugong. Marine turtle All identified marine turtle (Chelonidae) bone was small fragments of shell (carapace and plastron). It is likely the bone is from Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas) (waru, Western-Central Language), the most commonly available and hunted marine turtle in Zenadh Kes today (McNiven and Hitchcock 2004). All identified turtle bone was recovered from XUs 9 to 18a in the middle of SUI dating to 2400-2500 years ago and from XU25a in SU3 dating to nearly 3800 years ago (Figure 9). It is doubtful that the older turtle bone is aberrant as it is likely that most of the 'larger vertebrate' bone found throughout the sequence is also marine turtle. Fish (including ray and shark) Fish bone was found in most levels of the deposit, indicating that fishing was undertaken by occupants of the cave throughout its 3800 year history (Figure 9).

Chronological changes in the density of cultural materials from Pit A, Mask Cave (excludes large discoidal core from XU10). the Pit A bone assemblage by McNiven revealed 94 fish bones. It is likely that many of the bones assigned to the 'smaller vertebrate' category represent highly fragmented fish bones. The 94 fish bones were sent to Weisler for identification to nearest taxon using a reference collection consisting of nearly 400 individual specimens from 46 families (see Weisler 2001: Appendix 3 for a complete listing of taxa). Because the assemblage consists primarily of bones &lt;5mm in length, a binocular microscope at 10-15X was necessary for examining individual elements. For the purposes of this preliminary analysis, the fish bones were quantified by the number of identified specimens (NISP) per cultural phase. Vertebrae were measured with calipers to two decimal places for providing an indication of fish size.

Fish bones (NISP) from Pit A, Mask Cave. The densest concentrations of fish bones were found in the Phase 2 and 3 deposits dating between 1500 and 2600 years ago (Table 4). Aside from the five-paired head bones, few other specimens could be identified to a specific element other than spines, vertebrae and unspecified cranial fragments. Burnt bones were present in most XUs. Despite the small size of the bones 43% could be identified to a known taxon, while an additional 35% may be identified with an expanded reference collection. In terms of NISP values for identified taxa, most fish were Scaridae (parrotfish) and Tetraodontidae (puffers) followed by minor amounts of Elasmobranchii (sharks and rays) and Myliobatidiformes (rays) (Table 4). Sharks and rays (Elasmobranchii) were represented by three vertebrae (centrum) with diameters of 2.86, 3.75 and 3.85mm, clearly from individuals of very short length. The terminal barb of a small ray (Myliobatidiformes) measured only 9.32mm long. Only one parrotfish (Scaridae) premaxillary-dentary was identified and all other specimens identified to this family were individual teeth from the upper and lower pharyngeal bones. The puffers (Tetraodontidae) were represented by the distinctive premaxillary and the occasional dentary-premaxillary (which could not be identified to a specific element due to their fragmentary state). No major chronological changes are evident in the range of fish caught through the 3800 year long sequence. Mask Cave complements previous archaeological evidence for consumption of parrotfish (Carter 2004: 220, 225; Ghaleb 1998; Harris et al 1985: 16; McNiven and Hitchcock 2004: 149; Rowland 1985: 129) and sharks and rays (Carter 2004: 220; McNiven and Hitchcock 2004: 1 10, 145) across Zenadh Kes. All three classes of fish continue to be caught across Zenadh Kes (e.g. Johannes and MacFarlane 1991: 126-27, 211-26). In contrast, Mask Cave provides the first archaeological evidence for use of puffers (Tetraodontidae) in Zenadh Kes. Ray (1907: 91) lists 'toad- fish' (Tetraodontidae) (badar, Western-Central Language) but does not indicate if they were eaten. 61</page><page sequence="14">All of the identified fish are available within shallow waters across near-shore reefs around Pulu islet. Since the average size of fish represented in the Mask Cave assemblage is probably less than 10cm in length, it is likely that such small fish were caught by hand or speared in reef pools stranded at low tide. In terms of contemporary consumption of parrotfish (kal/kala/urdum) across western and central Zenadh Kes, the usual capture technique is hand line or underwater spear (Johannes and MacFarlane 1991: 214, 219). However, 'small fish' (including Scaridae) are caught through poisoning by Islanders ('mainly by men') of the Central Group during what Poiner and Harris (1991:133) refer to as 'reef gleaning expeditions'. That is, the 'milky sap of the vine root (Derris sp.), imported from Daru [off Papuan coast], was used in small, shallow intertidal pools in coral areas'. Fuary (1991: 148) recorded that lama (Yam) Islanders of the central Strait 'occasionally' poison fish in tide pools on coral reef flats using the stupefacient sazi (Derris sp.). The '[disoriented fish swimming at odd angles near the surface fall easy prey to multi-pronged spears' (Fuary 1991: 148). Haddon (1912: 159) also mentioned that '[p]arts of certain plants [e.g. Derris sp.] are scraped and pounded or bruised and placed in pools or lagoons on the reef at low water to stupefy fish, which are easily caught as they float on the surface'. More generally, Haddon (1912: 3) reported: A little fishing is indulged in by both sexes when they feel inclined for a change of diet; but at certain periods fishing becomes more of a general occupation. At low tide men, women and children may be seen searching the reef for shell-fish and fish which have become imprisoned in rock-pools, but as a rule this simple collecting is done more by the woman and children. Discussion Faunal remains from Mask Cave indicate a marine subsistence focus on off-shore (turtle and to a lesser extent dugong) and near-shore low tide reef pool (small fish) resources throughout the site's history. This focus on turtle, dugong and fish similarly characterizes Torres Strait Islander ethnographic recordings of subsistence practices during the 19th and 20th centuries (Haddon 1935: 355; Johannes and MacFarlane 1991). Qualitatively, few changes are evident in the range of marine species eaten through time. In contrast, major quantitative changes are registered through the sequence with a dramatic increase in bone discard in Phase 2 dated 2100-2600 years ago (Figure 9). The preservation of small fish bones in all phases indicates that the dramatic increase in bone discard beginning 2600 years ago is not a taphonomic illusion. Stone artefacts A total of 842 flaked stone artefacts was recovered from Pit A. Nearly all (n=841) artefacts are small with a mean weight of 0.6g. A single outlier is a large (227.4g) tabular discoidal core recovered from XU10. The highest density of artefacts (in terms of number and weight) occurs within Phases 3 and 4 dating to the last 1700 years (Figure 9). While a technological analysis has yet to be undertaken on Pit A artefacts, 99% (n=832) of the assemblage has been assigned to raw material type. Raw material classification consisted of McNiven placing each artefact into one of 26 'types'. Examples of each type were sent to von Gnielinski for geological description. Many of the 26 types were considered variations of single rock types and were then re- grouped accordingly. During the original raw material assessment, it was apparent that the entire assemblage was dominated by flakes with bipolar reduction increasing dramatically during the last 1700 years. This increase is linked technologically to an equally dramatic increase in use of quartz (both crystal and milky varieties) (Figure 9). Of the identified assemblage, quartz dominates numerically (77%), followed by rhyolitic ignimbrite (18%), granite (3%), microgranite and felsic dykes (1%) and volcanic (1%). The large discoidal core is made from granite. The following brief geological overview of Zenadh Kes sets the scene for discussions of artefact sources (and pottery sourcing - see below). Zenadh Kes geologic background The islands of Zenadh Kes are emergent exposures of the bathymétrie Cape York-Oriomo Ridge (TMC 1971), a structural feature linking Cape York geotectonically to bedrock exposures near the southernmost tip of the broad headland of Papua New Guinea that lies west of the Gulf of Papua along the southern flank of the Quaternary sediment cover over the Fly River platform. The largely submerged ridge is an extension of the Paleozoic Tasman orogenic belt of eastern Australia, and the Zenadh Kes islands expose Paleozoic granite together with associated comagmatic felsic volcanic rocks, which are intruded and locally metamorphosed by the plutons (Hamilton 1979: 227; Willmott et al 1973). Two major rock types are exposed across the western islands of Zenadh Kes: Torres Strait Volcanics Group and the Badu (Igneous) Suite (von Gnielinski et al 1998). The Torres Strait Volcanics of late Carboniferous to Early Permian age are composed dominantly of 'rhyolitic welded tuffs with minor agglomerate, volcanic breccia, ignimbrite, rhy olite, andésite and interbedded sediments' (von Gnielinski et al 1998: 160). They have a known stratigraphie thickness of at least 300m, and are intruded by various bodies of the Badu Suite that have yielded isotopie Κ- Ar ages of 302-286 Ma (Willmott et al 1973: 143) near the Carboniferous-Permian time boundary. The Badu Suite is dominated by granites, and 'in terms of relative ages, the oldest intrusion is thought to be a porphyritic microgranite, followed by a biotite-hornblende granodiorite and a fine grained granite and lastly, unmineralised porphyritic siliceous dykes' (von Gnielinski et al 1998: 160). Most porphyritic microgranite dykes occur across the central 62</page><page sequence="15">western islands (Badu and Mabuyag). 'Narrow quartz veins are common in and near many of the dykes' (Willmott et al 1973: 117). Igneous and metamorphic Paleozoic bedrock is overlain unconformably on selected islands (notably Badu and Mua) by undeformed Cenozoic clayey sandstone and sandstone (von Gnielinski et al. 1998:159). Mabuyag exposes both volcanic and intrusive rock of Paleozoic age, but evidently no Cenozoic sandstone cover (Willmott et al. 1973: 114). Artefact sources Mask Cave stone artefacts are made from both Torres Strait Volcanics ('rhyolitic ignimbrite' and 'volcanic') and the Badu Suite ('quartz', 'granite' and 'microgranite and felsic dykes'). All of these raw materials are consistent with the known local geology of the Mabuyag area. Mabuyag comprises mostly welded tuffs (Torres Strait Volcanics) and porphrytic microgranite (Badu Suite) (Willmott and Powell 1977). 'Rhyolitic tuffs' were also identified on Mabuyag by Haddon et al. (1894: 456). Granite, which represents a small proportion of the artefact assemblage, may have been quarried on Pulu. While all of the Mask Cave stone artefact raw materials could have been obtained within 2-4km of the site (most likely on Mabuyag), neighbouring islands in the central west of Zenadh Kes such as Mua and Badu feature similar geology and cannot be ruled out as potential sources. During Phase 1 occupation of the site 2900-3800 years ago, very little use was made of the dyke/vein raw materials. Some quartz was used but no evidence was recovered for use of microgranite and felsic dyke rocks. In other words, use of raw materials with small and isolated source outcrops broadens within the last 2600 years and dramatically increases and focuses on quartz within the last 1700 years. This pattern provides an historical background to the dominance of quartz artefact assemblages within midden sites across western Zenadh Kes during the last 1000 years (see McNiven 2006a). While it is possible that limited use of dyke/vein raw materials during the initial occupation phase reflects a lack of familiarity of rock outcrops, it is also possible such changes reflect new functional requirements of stone tools and the need for finer-grained raw materials. Red-slipped pottery Chronology Sixteen pottery sherds were recovered from Mask Cave (Appendix; Figure 10). Two are surface sherds found amongst a lag deposit of stone artefacts within a shallow erosion channel running through the middle of the site. The remaining 14 sherds were excavated from Pits A, E and F. The depth location of each of the 14 subsurface sherds is shown in Figure 6. The sub-surface sherds were recovered from Phases 2 and 3 in XUs dated from 1640±50 BP (c. 1450 calBP) (SqE, XU5, 4-7cm below the surface) to 2507±42 BP (C.2450 calBP) (SqA, XU22a, 73-79cm below the surface) (Figure 6). The first group of eight sherds came from 5-25cm below the surface (Pit A: XUs 6 and 7; Pit E: XUs 5, 7, 8 and 11). They span the depth range of Phase 3 dated 1500-1700 years ago. However it is possible that the deepest of these sherds (Pit E, XU1 1) is older as it is located at the interface of Phases 2 and 3. Parsimony suggests the two surface sherds similarly belong to Phase 3. The second group of five sherds came from 65-95 cm below the surface (Pit A: XUs 21a and 22a; Pit E: XU29c; Pit F: XU31) in deposits dated 2400-2500 years ago (Phase 2). A single stratigraphie outlier, the sherd from Pit E XU 16a at a depth of 36-38cm below the surface, is embedded within sediments assigned to Phase 2 and is likewise assigned an age of 2400-2500 years ago. It is plausible that pottery is associated with the start of Phase 2 at 2600 years ago given that the one sigma calibrated age range for the oldest pottery sherd dated 2507±42 BP is 2363-2696 calBP. As such, the earliest pottery at Mask Cave is assigned a date of 2400- 2600 years ago. Figure 10. Selected pottery sherds from Mask Cave (cross-section is through the axis of maximum curvature). 63</page><page sequence="16">Taphonomy To what extent are the sherds in primary depositional context? Three taphonomic scenarios can be generated for the original deposition of the sherds. First, the sherds are in original depositional context and two major periods of pottery manufacture are represented. Second, the sherds date to 1500 to 1700 years ago and through disturbance nearly one third of these fragments moved 40-70cm down through the deposit into sediments 2400-2600 years old. Third, the pottery is 2400-2600 years old and through disturbance half of the sherds have moved upwards, up to 20cm, into more recent sediments 1500-1700 years old. The second and third scenarios are unlikely as such major vertical movement of nearly half of the pottery assemblage would require massive disturbance of the deposit that was not documented and indeed is inconsistent with the consolidated nature of sediments and stratigraphie integrity revealed by the stone artefact raw material distributions. For example, if nearly half the pottery had moved downwards through the deposit it would be expected that nearly half the upper quartz assemblage would also have moved downwards: it didn't. Of the 639 quartz artefacts in Pit A, 537 (84%) were recovered from the upper 18cm of deposit from Phases 3 and 4 dating to the last 1700 years. Thus parsimony indicates that the sherds are in original depositional context. Form and style Fourteen sherds are body fragments and one sherd is a possible body fragment. An unusual sherd recovered from the base of SUI in Pit E is oval in cross-section (10 χ 6mm) with a maximum length of 18mm. While the form of this oval sherd is consistent with a handle fragment, the lack of longitudinal curvature is not. Most sherds are small with a maximum length range of 10 to 43mm. All 14 body sherds exhibit a red or reddish-brown slip on the outer surface. The surfaces of the possible body sherd are too weathered to be informative about surface treatment. While no clear and unambiguous decoration in the form of painting, impressions or relief exists on the pottery assemblage, it would be premature to conclude the tradition is plain ware. Decorated pottery traditions in Melanesia are often diagnosed from sherd assemblages where less than 2% of sherds reveal decoration. For example, only 1.5% of sherds from Nebira 4 in the Port Moresby region are decorated (Allen 1972: 103). Similarly, decorated sherds from various Lapita assemblages in the Arawe Islands of southwest New Britain represent only 5% (Adwe Is.), 7% (Apalo, Kumbun Is.) and 14% (Paligmete, Pililo Is.) of sherd assemblages (Summerhayes 2000: 44, 92, 106, 126). If a similar situation existed at Mask Cave, on average decoration rates ranging from 1.5% to 14% would require recovery of 100 and 7 sherds respectively before a single decorated sherd was encountered. It is difficult to reconstruct the original form of the pottery vessels as no rim sherds were recovered. However, from the curvature of the body sherds it is clear that the original vessels were of moderate size. Apart from the red slip, the other distinctive feature of the pottery assemblage is its thinness. Body sherd thickness ranges from 2.7mm to 5.2mm with an average of around 3-4mm. The red slip and thin walls indicate finely made ware and skilled potters. How the pottery was used remains a mystery. However, the rarity of red-slipped sherds recovered to date from Zenadh Kes suggests the wares were similarly rare in the past, possibly (but not necessarily) denoting a special, perhaps prestige, or ritual function. To better characterize the nature of clays used as raw materials and to determine the possible place of pottery manufacture three of the sherds were sent to W.R. Dickinson (University of Arizona) for pétrographie analysis. The results of this analysis (Petro Rpt WRD-235) are presented below. Pétrographie analysis Three sherds from Pit A (one surface and two subsurface sherds) were subjected to thin-sectioning and pétrographie analysis to characterise the constituent elements of the raw materials, in particular the nature of tempers mixed in with the clay matrix. One sherd is from the surface (Surface #1) (probably Phase 3), one sherd is from Phase 3 (Sherd XU7 #1 from a depth of 15- 18cm below the surface), and one sherd is from Phase 2 (Sherd XU22a #1 from a depth of 73-79cm below the surface) (Figure 10). Tempers are discussed in terms of form (sands) and mineralogy. Temper sand The tempers in all three sherds are closely similar, to the extent that the two subsurface sherds are indistinguishable in thin section, and on a strictly pétrographie basis both could have been derived from the same ceramic vessel. The temper in the surface sherd is subtly different in texture, but still very similar overall. Temper is so abundant, with clay matrix hardly more than interstitial to temper grains in parts of each sherd, that the fabric could be mistaken for clayey sandstone were it not for the obvious sherd morphology coupled with the presence of red slip (slip is clearly visible micro-scopically as well as megascopically on both of the excavated sherds). The ratio of temper grains to clay matrix is higher than observed to date in Oceanian sherds. The tempers are well sorted, subrounded to subangular aggregates of fine sand. In each sherd thin section, there are also a few (three to four) outsized opaque objects, spherical to ovoid in shape, with dimensions of 0.5- 1.25mm (coarse sand). Optical petrography in transmitted light is a technique poorly suited to the identification of opaque and semi-opaque materials (through which little or no light passes), but the outsized objects appear to be pedogenic nodules of iron oxide, as judged from tiny silt grains imbedded within them, a hint of concentric internal 64</page><page sequence="17">structure, and a subdued reddish translucence in the intense light concentrated by a substage condenser. There is no textural evidence to reveal whether the nodules were added deliberately to clay bodies together with temper, or were residual nodules in the clay as collected, but the latter alternative seems the more attractive from a technological standpoint because no means of collecting the pedogenic nodules separate from associated clay can be envisioned. The excellent sorting of the temper sand is striking, and first-cycle derivation from any bedrock of Zenadh Kes islands seems precluded. Potential derivation from shelf sandstone of Cenozoic age overlying bedrock is a more attractive option, but apparently would require transport of either temper or finished ware from Badu or Mua where the Cenozoic strata are widely exposed (Willmott et al 1973: 1 14). One way to assemble the temper-rich clay bodies (as fired) would be to collect semiconsolidated sediment that was naturally tempered with sand (the local strata are described as 'clayey sandstone' by von Gnielinski et al 1998). The pedogenic nodules present in the sherds might then be acquired at the collecting site as a naturally occurring contaminant of weathered sediments. There would then be no need to manually mix clay, temper sand, and pedogenic nodules from separate collecting sites, for all three ceramic components would already be intimately intermixed within the natural clay body, with only kneading required to work the combined material into a perform state. From this provisional interpretation, both the sand and the pedogenic nodules can be viewed as natural temper, with no need for manual addition of temper to the clay bodies. This scenario most likely accounts for the near-identical fabric of the sherds of different ages. The other alternative is to suppose that the sherds were derived from ware brought to Zenadh Kes from elsewhere, and to seek comparative materials. The tempers in the Mask Cave sherds are wholly different, both texturally and compositionally, from either indigenous or exotic tempers observed to date in sherds from the Murray Islands of eastern Zenadh Kes (Dickinson 2004), the Aru Islands to the west of Zenadh Kes (Dickinson 2005; Petro Rpts WRD- 218), or the Ambon-Haruku-Saparua-Seram island cluster in Maluku (Petro Rpt WRD-223) and Halmahera (Dickinson 2005) of eastern Indonesia. The possibility that the occurrence of sherds on Pulu islet can be explained by ceramic transfer from any of those locales, or from the places of origin of exotic sherds recovered from those locales, can be dismissed as highly improbable. There remains no present archaeological guide to possible alternate origins of the Pulu ware. Temper mineralogy and source The search for any temper source is governed by the sedimentological and petrologie nature of the temper sand. The excellent sorting and appreciable abrasion of such fine sand implies marine sediment, rather than fluvial deposits, as the immediate source of the temper, but not a beach sand because neither placer concentrations of heavy minerals nor reef-derived calcareous detritus are evident. The mineralogical composition of the sand is unusual, and implies a unique combination of ultimate bedrock sources for the detritus. The most abundant grain types (Table 5) are monocrystalline quartz grains and glassy volcanic lithic fragments, the latter partially devitrified to cryptocrystalline alteration products that are weakly biréfringent and of pale yellowish to faint reddish brown hues in thin section. Although some of the quartz grains might be of volcanic derivation, most appear to be common plutonic quartz derived from intrusive igneous rock such as granite. The presence of plutonic detritus is confirmed by the occurrence of sparse K-feldspar grains with optic axial angles (2V) too high for volcanic sanidine. The subordinate plagioclase feldspar is not markedly zoned internally, and could also be mainly of plutonic origin. Minor grain types include chalcedonic microcrystalline quartz of indeterminate origin but possibly from amygdules in volcanic rock, poly- crystalline microlitic and felsitic volcanic rock fragments (in addition to more abundant glassy volcanic rock fragments), equant opaque iron oxide grains that are probably magnetite, internally foliated fragments of metamorphic slate, and rare aggregate epidote grains. Relative proportions of the various grain types are constant in the three sherds examined petrographically (Table 5), with all contrasts in percentages lying within standard deviations of counting errors for a counted population of 400 grains.

The only factor detrimental to that hypothesis is an indication that felsic volcanic rocks of the Torres Strait Volcanics are rather widely devitrified (Willmott et al 1973: 100-1), whereas the dominant volcanic lithic fragments in the tempers still appear glass- rich. The degree of devitrification may be variable on outcrop, however, and estimating its extent is in any case difficult from pétrographie observations in thin section because the amount of visible birefringence is not a reliable guide to the percentage of cryptocrystalline material present. Otherwise, the close association of the Torres Strait Volcanics with the Badu intrusive suite provides an attractive joint source for felsic volcanic and quartz-rich plutonic detritus, undiluted by other debris, as recorded by the temper sands. If the bedrock sources of the temper lie elsewhere, and the sherds are exotic to Zenadh Kes, no attractive sediment provenance is known within the surrounding region. The obvious first point of comparison is with pottery assemblages along the south coast of Papua New Guinea (see below for discussion of southern Papuan ceramic assemblage chronologies). Intuitively, the source of the Mask Cave pottery is the well-documented red-slipped pottery traditions of the Gulf of Papua (e.g. Allen 1972; Bickler 1997; Irwin 1985; Rhoads 1982; Vanderwal 1978). Limited pétrographie data (Worthing 1982) for sherds from archaeological sites along the eastern shore of the Gulf of Papua make the option of ceramic transfer unattractive for interpretation of the Mask Cave tempers. The temper sands in selected prehistoric potsherds from multiple sites (n=8) along -40 km of the Papuan coast centered on Port Moresby are dominantly quarto-feldspathic or calcareous (reef detritus), lacking the high proportion of glassy volcanic lithic fragments (&gt;50%) observed in the Mask Cave sherds, and all contain prominent (5%-55%) chert grains more abundant than the minor (-2.5%) chalcedonic grains in Mask Cave tempers (Table 5). The Port Moresby and Mask Cave tempers seem geologically unrelated, and the occurrence of sands derived exclusively from granitic and cogenetic volcanic rocks anywhere on the southern Papuan coast is unlikely, given the geologic complexity of Papua New Guinea, whereas sands of just that character are expected in the Zenadh Kes islands. Although transport of finished ware to Pulu from elsewhere cannot be precluded based on these preliminary results, no likely alternate provenience is presently known. Local pottery tradition The pétrographie analysis, while preliminary, strongly supports the hypothesis that the Mask Cave pottery was manufactured on the western islands of Zenadh Kes. This hypothesis is consistent with similarities between the form and mineralogy of tempers within clay matrices and the known geology of the region, and the lack of similarity with any known Indigenous pottery traditions of Melanesia or eastern Indonesia. As such, the Mask Cave pottery appears to represent the first identified Indigenous pottery tradition for Australia. Discussion Local demographic expansions across western Z£nadh Kes c.3000-3800 years ago Badu 15 rocksheiter on Badu island immediately south of Mabuyag demonstrates that people have been living in Torres Strait since at least 8053±42 BP (c.8900 years ago) (David et al. 2004). After a drop in occupational intensity during the mid-Holocene 3800-6800 years ago (3500-6000 BP) when Zenadh Kes was 'occasionally visited from Cape York', David et al. (2004) argue that the region saw more permanent occupation within the last 3800 years. This increased occupation is supported further by evidence from Badu 15 for increased anthropogenic firing of the landscape and concomitant reductions in 'forest cover' (Rowe 2006). The upper phase (Phase 3) of occupation at Badu 15, dated 3150 to 3800 years ago (3000 to 3500 BP) is similar to the lower phase of occupation at Mask Cave (Phase 1) dated 2900 to 3800 years ago. Thus, the new evidence from Mask Cave supports broader applicability of chronological patterning at Badu 15 rocksheiter. David et al. (2004: 74) associate Phase 3 (3150-3800 year ago) occupation of Badu 15 with 'an influx of people from the north and northeast'. Alternatively, we associate the dramatic increase in occupational intensity of Badu 15 and Mask Cave at 3800 years ago not with an 'influx' of Melanesian peoples but with a major demographic expansion of local populations, for four key reasons. First, excavations in the Murray Islands have failed to recover evidence of occupation before 3000 years ago (Carter 2004). Indeed, evidence of pre-2600 year ago occupation is limited to scattered shells of possible cultural origin cemented within beachrock at Sokoli on Dauar which have been radiocarbon dated to 3060±60 BP (2800 years ago) and 3150±70 BP (2850 years ago) (Carter 2004: 153). Thus the c.3000-3800 year old occupational phase is restricted to western Zenadh Kes. If the influx of peoples was from the Papuan coast it would be expected that both the western and eastern parts of the Strait would have been occupied. The restriction of c.3000-3800 year old activity to the Western Group suggests the demographic expansion was more localised and linked to mainland Australia and not mainland New Guinea. Second, 3800 years ago (3500 BP) coincides with the onset of intensified Aboriginal activity in northern Queensland (David and Lourandos 1998, 1999; Haberle and David 2004) and across other parts of the continent (e.g. David 2002; Lourandos 1997; McConvell 1996). For example, Haberle and David (2004: 171) discuss large-scale 66</page><page sequence="19">'regionalism' in rock-art of southern Cape York Peninsula as a 'post-3700 cal yr BP' phenomenon. Specialised seed grinding and Nyungic language dispersals in the arid/semi- arid zone date to the last 3500 years BP (David 2002: Chap. 8; McConvell 1996; Smith 2005; Veth 2000). More specifically in terms of coastal use, 3500 BP marks a major change in midden mound formation across various parts of northern Australia (O'Connor 1999; Veitch 1999). Rowland (1999) shows a major change in marine resource use and intensity in the Keppel Islands Group on the central Queensland coast beginning 3500 BP. Further south along the Curtis coast, Ulm (2004) demonstrates occupation after 3500 BP. This pattern is matched immediately to the north in the Northumberland and adjacent Southern Cumberland Island Groups where all available radiocarbon dates indicate use since 3200 BP (Border 1999). Barker's (2004: 147) detailed study of the adjacent Whitsundays region reveals 'an expansion of island use' after 3000 BP. Thus, the dramatic increase in use of islands in the Western Group of Zenadh Kes adjacent to Cape York follows a broader trend of changes in Aboriginal land and sea use across various parts of northern Australia, especially Queensland. To what extend the Zenadh Kes expansions were due to demographic push and/or resource pull is unknown. In this connection, Barham (2000: 300) makes the observation that increasing abundance of dugong and turtle resources, as modeled here dating to after 3500 BP, provided some stimulus to movements offshore'. While this 'stimulus' (resource pull) was couched in terms of southward movement of Papuans, the stimulus could equally apply to a demographic expansion of local peoples already using the islands. Third, the Papuan influx model of Barham (2000) and David et al (2004) is not supported by available evidence for pre-3000 year ago use of the southern Papuan coast. Indeed, only one site has been excavated and dated to more than 3000 years ago on this coastline - Kukuba Cave on the coast immediately south of Yule Island where Vanderwal (1973: 51) obtained a basal date of 3980±105 BP (4400 years ago). Thus, while it is likely that people were living on the southern Papuan coast opposite Zenadh Kes 3800 years ago, no evidence exists for intensified activity at this time. As discussed below, the first evidence for intensified activity occurs within the last 2500 years. However, the lack of evidence for a Papuan influx 3800 years ago does not discount the possibility of Papuan visits and Papuan-Zenadh Kes cultural and biological interactions between 2500 and 3800 years ago. Indeed, McNiven and Hitchcock's (2004) hypothesis that the Dingo was introduced by people to the Australian mainland from the New Guinea mainland via Zenadh Kes 3500 years ago necessitates a meeting of Papuan and Aboriginal peoples (see also McNiven 2006b). Furthermore, local demographic expansion through the western islands of Zenadh Kes is consistent with Wurm's (1972: 364) hypothesis for early Aboriginal language influences in the Trans-Fly region. Fourth, David et al see the 3150-3800 year ago Papuan influx as an extension of Lapita expansions across the western Pacific: This is precisely the time when many islands in the Western Pacific first became occupied as a result of Austronesian [Lapita] expansions - from islands off eastern New Guinea to Tonga and Samoa in the east - indicating that Torres Strait was also likely visited by peoples related historically and culturally to these specialized seafarers, or by nearly peoples culturally influenced by them (David et al 2004: 74). Yet the oldest known Lapita sites, located in the Mussau Island Group in the Bismarck Archipelago, date to 3300- 3500 calBP (Kirch 2001; Summerhayes 2001, in press), with dates for the movement of Lapita beyond the Bismarck Archipelago onto Tonga and Samoa around 3000 to 3300 years ago (Green 2003: 96). As such, Lapita development and Lapita colonisation expansions occurred c.300-500 and c.500-800 years respectively after the onset of demographic expansions across western Zenadh Kes 3800 years ago. This dating disparity supports the view that demographic expansion across western Zenadh Kes during the 4th millennium before present was an Australian phenomenon and not a Melanesian one. Introduction of red-slipped pottery to Zenadh Kes 2400-2600 years ago Mask Cave reveals two major periods of pottery use: a younger tradition dated 1500-1700 years ago and an older tradition dated back to 2400-2600 years ago. Partial corroborative evidence for pre-2000 year ago pottery across Zenadh Kes is found at Ormi on Dauar island in the Murray Islands group of the eastern Strait (Carter 2004; Carter et al 2004a, 2004b). A 2 χ Im trench was excavated at the midden site in 2000 by Melissa Carter and colleagues. The site was excavated in 25 excavation units (XUs) and the 220cm-deep deposit was divided into 13 stratigraphie units and five horizons. Six radiocarbon dates were obtained from the site (Carter 2002) and allow age estimates of the pottery (dates recalibrated for the purposes of this paper using Calib 5.0.2, Southern Hemisphere, using a AR value of 49±45 for shell dates following Ulm 2002). The 23 pottery sherds can be divided into two stratigraphie clusters. First, the upper two sherds (ORMI and ORM2) come from XUs 6 and 7 at a depth of c.80cm below the surface in Horizon I. Three dates for the upper metre of deposit suggest these sherds date to around 1600 to 1950 years ago. The second cluster of 21 sherds (ORM3 to ORM23) comes from XUs 16-22 at a depth of c. 11 0-1 90cm below the surface in Horizons III to V. However, nearly all sherds (n=19, 83%) were recovered from Horizon IV (c. 120- 170cm below the surface), with the highest concentration of sherds (n=10) recovered from XU20 across the lower sections of Horizon IV. The lowest sherd (ORM23) comes from XU22 (c. 190cm below the surface) across the upper sections of Horizon V. A date of 1950 years ago (2050±80 BP, charcoal) from a depth 1 10cm provides an upper age estimate for the second pottery cluster and suggests chronological continuity with the first pottery cluster. The deepest sherd is bracketed by a date of 2000 years ago (2435±48 BP, shell) from XU21 at a depth of 67</page><page sequence="20">c. 178cm and a near basal date of 2550 years ago (2840±50 BP, shell) from XU24 at a depth of c.210cm below the surface. While none of the sherds exhibit decorative designs, six sherds from XU20 are slipped (five with a reddish-orange slip). Pétrographie analysis of sherds ORM 1 to ORM3 by Dickinson (2004) revealed that the volcanic/metamorphic detritus inclusions most likely have a Papua New Guinea Highland source. Variability in mineralogy and sand grain morphology indicates a range of downstream sources and 'multiple' pottery manufacture locales in the lowlands of the Gulf of Papua, perhaps in the area of the Purari and Kikori Rivers. No sourcing has been undertaken for the deeper and older slipped pottery at Ormi. The Mask Cave assemblage suggests that finely-crafted red-slipped pottery was made in western Zenadh Kes 2400- 2600 years ago. This ware indicates considerable pottery manufacturing skills for an area that has no previous history of pottery. Where did the person or peoples who made the Mask Cave pottery acquire the skills and knowledge to manufacture fine-quality red-slipped pottery? Two options present themselves - links to the west (West Papua) and/or links to the east (Papua New Guinea). Unfortunately, it is difficult to assess the merits of the western link as very little archaeological research has been undertaken along the south coast of West Papua. While red-slipped pottery dated back to 3200 years ago occurs in the northern Moluccas (Bellwood 1997a: 229), closer to the south West Papuan coast reliable dates for pottery in the Aru Islands are within the last 1000 years (O'Connor et al 2005: 311). Thus, in terms of available information, parsimony suggests strongly that the Mask Cave potters came from pottery manufac- turing communities of southern coastal Papua New Guinea who possessed a red-slipped pottery manufacturing tradition. However, previous archaeological research along the southern Papuan coast dates the introduction of the red- Site Dated Dated 14CAge Calibrated Age Calibrated Age Years Lab Reference context material (years Β P) BP68.3% BP95.4% Ago number (1 sigma range) (2 sigma range) Circa# Oposisi Trench 1 charcoal 1890±305 1415-2069* 1095-1103 1750 ANU-425 Vanderwal (1973: 48, Unit 7 2079-2112 1138-1161 Fig. IV-4 &amp; VI- 1) Level 14 1168-2493* (Zone IIC) 2600 - 2609 2640 - 2680 Oposisi Trench 6 charcoal 1920+180 1568-1993 1394-2163* 1800 ANU-727 Vanderwal (1973: 49, Unit 2 2167-2179 Fig. IV-4 &amp; VI- 1) Level 4 2241 - 2302 (Zone IIB) Nebira4 Level 6 charcoal 880±250 553-970 331-367 750 GaK-2667 Allen (1972: 99) 442 - 1285* Nebira4 Level 14 charcoal 1760±90 1448-1454 1401-1825 1600 1-5796 Allen (1972: 99) 1517 - 1729* Nebira4 Level 14 charcoal 3340±160 3341-3720* 3080-3093 3550 GaK-2990 Allen (1972: 99) 3804-3807 3107-3128 3138-3925* 3951-3958 MailuOl F/G charcoal 1900±70 1706-1871 1571-1582 1800 ANU-1229 Irwin (1985: 87) 1600 - 1933* 1939 - 1942 Samoa 55-60cm charcoal 1850±95 1573-1579 1445-1456 1700 1-6153 Bowdler (in Rhoads below 1605-1825* 1516-1948* 1983:98) surface 1854 - 1857 Samoa 55-60cm charcoal 2430±370 1950-1961 1561-3271* 2400 ANU-2061A Rhoads (1983: 98) below 1969 - 1980 3284 - 3329 surface 1983 - 2845* Lobata Lower Marine 2300±100 1798-2046 1662-2175 1900 ANU-4808 Sullivan &amp; Sassoon midden Shell (1983: 7) layer Table 6.

This raises the question of how a red- slipped pottery tradition was introduced into Zenadh Kes 2400-2600 years ago when the apparent source area dates to only 2000 years ago. In the following section, we critically examine the evidence for the antiquity of red-slipped pottery along the southern Papuan coast. While up front we note that no direct evidence exists for pre-2000 year ago pottery along the southern Papuan coast, we ask the question: 'Does the available data provide scope for the possibility of pre- 2000 year ago pottery?'. Southern Papuan red-slipped pottery: &gt;2000 BP tradition ? The notion of pottery entering the archaeological record of the south coast of Papua within the last 2000 years ago is based primarily on excavations at eight sites. They are, moving from east to west, Mailu 01 (Mailu Island) and Selai (Amazon Bay) (Irwin 1985), Loloata (Bootless Bay) (Sullivan and Sassoon 1987), Eriama 1 and Nebira 4 (Port Moresby region) (Bulmer 1975; Allen 1972), Kukuba Cave and Oposisi (eastern Papuan Gulf) (Vanderwal 1973) and Samoa (western Papuan Gulf) (Rhoads 1983). This &lt;2000 BP chronology is accepted widely (Bickler 1997: 151; Frankel et al 1994: 45; Spriggs 1995: 122; Swadling 1977: 39; White and O'Connell 1982: 204). Yet for five of these sites (Oposisi, Nebira 4, Mailu 01, Samoa and Loloata) the possibility of &gt;2000 year ago red-slipped pottery cannot be discounted on available evidence. 1. Mailu 01 (Mailu Island off Amazon Bay) The open midden site of Mailu 01 was excavated by Geoff Irwin in the early 1970s. Pottery was recovered from all excavated spits and tended to be red-slipped and made from local clays on the island (Irwin 1985: 108, 204-7). The basal stratigraphie unit (Layer G), taking in the lower c.80cm of the pit (calculated from Irwin 1985: Fig. 31), was excavated in seven spits (Gl to G7 according to Irwin 1985: Table 18). Five radiocarbon dates (charcoal and marine shell) and nine thermoluminescence (TL) dates were obtained for the excavation. In terms of Layer G, the oldest radiocarbon date of 1900±70 BP (c.1800 years ago) was obtained from a 'burnt branch some 7 cm in diameter lying at the interface of Layers F and G' (Irwin 1985: 86) (Table 6). The only dates obtained from Layer G sediments were three TL determinations of 1880 BP, 1460 BP and 1310 BP (with 'reliability' ratings of 'good', 'fair' and 'unknown' respectively) for G4 located mid-way through Layer G. Even if the TL date of 1800 BP is accepted, the lower pottery assemblage, taking in the lower c.40cm of the site, remains undated. 2. Loloata (Bootless Bay) The open shell midden is located on Loloata Island in Bootless Bay near Port Moresby (see Sullivan and Sassoon 1987 for details). Excavations in the mid-1980s revealed two discrete midden layers separated by up to 2m of culturally sterile sediments of slope avalanche origin. The upper midden, averaging 10-20cm in thickness, was buried by 'up to 40cm of talus material'. The lower midden deposit 'was concentrated in the upper 10cm' of basal beachridge sands although cultural deposit extends down a further c.20cm (Sullivan and Sassoon 1987: 3-4). While both midden layers contain pottery, the lower midden is characterized by red-slipped wares. One of the sherds from the lower midden was sourced to the Yule Island region in the eastern Papuan Gulf by Bickler (1997: 157). The only radiocarbon date for the site, on a 'shell sample from the lower midden layer', produced an age of 2300±100 BP (c.1900 years ago) (Table 6). As Sullivan and Sassoon (1987: 7) note that the date was obtained from 'within the sandy beachridge capping', it appears that the shell sample was taken from the upper 10cm of the lower midden. As such, cultural material, including red-slipped pottery, from the underlying c.20cm of the lower midden remains undated. 3. Nebira 4 (Port Moresby region) The open site of Nebira 4 was excavated by Jim Allen in 1969/70. Pottery (mostly red-slipped ware of local manufacture) is found throughout the cultural deposit (Allen 1972: 99; Bickler 1997: 159). Allen (1972: 103, 108) notes that while 98.5% of sherds are 'plain', the style of decorated pots from the lowest levels matches the style of pots from the lowest level (Zone IIC) of Oposisi (see below). Three 14C dates were obtained for Nebira 4: 880±250 BP (Level 6) and 3340±160 BP and 1760±90 BP (both from Level 14) (Table 6). While Allen (1972: 120) remarks that '[n]o archaeo-logical reason can be given for this [dating] discrepancy', he rejected the oldest date based on the clear pottery assemblage similarities between Nebira 4 and Oposisi dated at 2000 years ago. Yet, the lower c.30-45cm of the cultural deposit and pottery assemblage (Levels 15- 1 8) at Nebira 4 remains undated. 4. Oposisi (Yule Island) The open midden site of Oposisi on Yule Island was excavated by Ron Vanderwal in 1969/70. Pottery was found within all zones, with red-slipped wares diagnostic of the basal zone (IIC) and upper zones (IA and IB), 'but does not occur on any pots found in Zone IIB, overlying IIC (Vanderwal 1973: 100-107 and Table VI-9; 1978: 426). Most of the Zone IIC red-slipped pottery was made locally in the Yule Island region (Bickler 1997: 156-7, 159). The lower stratigraphie units (Zones IIB and IIC) of Trench 6 were 'easily detected' but associated 14C dates are stratigraphically inverted and suggest some reworking of deposits. Level 4 (Zone IIB) produced a date of 1920±180 BP while slightly younger dates of 1530±160 BP and 1600±210 BP were obtained for Levels 6 and 7 (Zone IIC) respectively. A basal date of 1890±305 BP was obtained for Trench 1 (Vanderwal 1973: 48-50, Fig. VI-1). Vanderwal (1973: 48-9) makes the valid point that inversion anomalies with the 14C dates have little significance as little statistical difference exists between the four oldest dates (given the large standard deviations). Concluding, Vanderwal (1973: 69</page><page sequence="22">50, 53, emphasis added) states: '[t]he samples submitted from the lower levels of the site yielded a cluster of dates which suggests an original settlement at about 2000 BP, or perhaps slightly earlier' and 'through to perhaps less than 1000 BP'. The 2 sigma calibrated age ranges for the two oldest available dates - 1394-2302 calBP (1920±180 BP) and 1095-2680 calBP (1890±305 BP) - are consistent with a view that the oldest excavated cultural materials at Oposisi (Zone IIC) may be more than 2000 years old (Table 6). 5. Samoa (Kikori region) The open midden site of Samoa located adjacent to the Aird Hills of the Kikori region of the western Papuan Gulf was excavated by Sandra Bowdler in 1971/72 and subsequently by Jim Rhoads in 1976. Excavations revealed a 60cm-deep cultural deposit resting on relatively sterile red mud. Pottery was found throughout the deposit with most diagnostic rim sherds from the lower part of the sequence exhibiting surface 'colouring' which Rhoads identified as 'either paint or slip' (1983: 99, Table 2). Unlike all other known early red-slipped pottery traditions of the southern Papuan coast, the early pottery at Samoa was not made locally but probably imported from the Yule Island area (Bickler 1997: 158-9; Rhoads 1982: 133-34). Bowdler obtained a 14C date on charcoal of 1850±95 BP (c.1700 years ago) from 55-60cm below the surface. Rhoads obtained two dates from the 'same level': 1220±180 BP (on freshwater shell) and 2430±370 BP (on charcoal) (Table 6). Rhoads (1983: 99) rightly rejected his shell date because of the unknown local 'correction factor'. However, he also rejected his charcoal date because the 'sample was 7% of the required amount and thus permitted only a tentative result'. He relies on Bowdler 's date and argues that 'an age of 1900 BP best approximates the earliest date for site occupation' (1983: 99). Rhoads makes little of the pottery chronology, stating simply that the 'occurrence of interior and exterior surface colouring on bowls generally places the Samoa specimens within the first 800 years of the Papuan pottery sequence'; that is 1200-2000 BP. Indeed, it seems clear that this association heavily influenced Rhoads' acceptance of Bowdler 's date of 1900 BP for the site and rejection of his older date. Outside of the circular argument of pushing for a 2000 year antiquity, the admittedly 'tentative' date of 2430±370 BP indicates that a pre-2000 BP date for the lowest pottery cannot be rejected (for similar tentative acceptance of the earlier basal date for Samoa, see Barham 1999: 79, 100). The conclusion that excavations along the southern Papuan coast have demonstrated a less than 2000 year antiquity for a red-slipped pottery tradition is debatable. A major chrono-stratigraphic issue for the key sites of Mailu 01, Loloata and Nebira 4 is that below the so-called basal dates of 2000 years is 20-45cm of undated ceramic assemblage. We note with interest that the only sites where it seems clear that radiocarbon dates were obtained on charcoal from the base of red-slipped pottery assemblages is at Oposisi (1890±305 BP) and Samoa (2430±370 BP). Thus, available evidence, albeit circumstantial, indicates that the earliest red-slipped pottery tradition of the southern Papuan coast dates to before 2000 years ago. Implications of our critique and new hypothesis for the antiquity of southern Papuan pottery are twofold. First, a new fine-grained excavation and radiocarbon dating programme is required to better understand the age of the earliest pottery deposits of the southern Papuan coast. Existing data can neither confirm the hypothesis for &lt;2000 year antiquity nor deny the possibility of a 2000-2600 year antiquity as suggested in this paper. The hypothesis for a 2000-2600 year old antiquity for southern Papuan red- slipped wares can only be rejected if future (re)dating of basal pottery assemblages at sites such as Nebira 4 and Samoa produces dates of &lt;2000 years ago. Second, the hypothesised &gt;2000 year antiquity for pottery along the southern Papuan coast strengthens the case for cultural links between this region and Zenadh Kes. In the following section, we discuss previous research linking the develop- ment of the southern Papuan red-slipped pottery tradition to the westward expansion of Austronesian expansions from Island Melanesia. We then extend this framework to provide a new model for Papuan expansions into occupied and unoccupied islands of Zenadh Kes 2600 years ago. Southern Papuan red- slipped pottery tradition: Ρ apuo- Austronesian migrations All researchers associated with archaeological excavations along the southern Papuan coast over the past four decades agree that the early red-slipped pottery tradition was introduced by Austronesian speaking peoples. The archaeo- logical case linking red-slipped pottery with Austronesian expansions was first published by Bulmer (1971: 56) who pointed out that a 'connection' clearly existed between this tradition and the Lapita red-slipped pottery tradition of Austronesian origin across eastern island Melanesia. The southern Papuan red-slipped pottery tradition was placed 'at the more recent end of the Lapita time span' (Bulmer 1971: 56). As Bulmer (1971: 82) rightly noted, Ί think that it stretches the imagination to suppose that a similar evolution of [red-slipped ceramics] occurred independently all over Melanesia. As these people were seafarers, it must surely be assumed on present evidence that these contrasting pottery industries traveled widely rather than evolving locally'. The Austronesian (red-slipped ware) migration hypothesis was elaborated subsequently by Vanderwal (1973) and Allen (1972). Vanderwal (1973: 230) suggested that 'the decorative motifs and techniques' of the early red- slipped wares at Oposisi 'ally it with Lapita pottery with its wide insular Pacific distribution'. More specially, 'there can be little room for doubt that the Oposisi culture is another transformation of the Pacific Lapita' (Vanderwal 1973: 234). However, Vanderwal (1978: 424) clarifies that the Oposisi 'assemblage is, however, in no sense a Lapita one, so I follow Golson (1971: 75) and call it Lapitoid'. Allen (1972: 123) similarly noted that the people at Nebira 4 'were makers of a distinctive pottery tradition with its antecedents 70</page><page sequence="23">in the Lapita tradition of the Pacific'. Faunal remains reveal a people with a 'maritime' economic focus while the far- flung ceramic similarities (red-slipped pottery) indicate 'efficient sailing vessels' (Allen 1977: 393). Since the pioneering research of Bulmer, Vanderwal and Allen, the model of Austronesian speaking peoples migrating westwards along the southern Papuan coast with red-slipped pottery has become orthodoxy amongst archaeologists (e.g. Bickler 1997: 152; Spriggs 1995: 122; Sullivan and Sassoon 1987: 7; Swadling 1977: 39, 43; White and O'Connell 1982: 204; see also Frankel and Kewibu 2000: 279; Irwin 1985: 246). The model also has appeal to linguists who note that westward extension of red- slipped pottery centres from the Massim region to the Port Moresby region and eastern margins of the Gulf of Papua correlate spatially with the distribution of Nuclear Papuan Tip (Austronesian) languages (Massim region) and Peripheral Papuan Tip (Austronesian) languages (e.g. Ross 1988: Chapter 6; Pawley and Ross 1995: 56, 59, 63). Austronesian languages are not found west of Cape Possession (immediately west of the Yule Island pottery manufacturing centre) (see also Dutton 1978, 1982; Wurm 1972). Furthermore, genetic work by Hagelberg et al (1999: 149) on 'Austronesian mtDNA types' supports the archaeo- linguistic model of an Austronesian migration westward along the southern coast of Papua New Guinea. Papuan expansions into Zenadh Kes 2600 years ago In the final paragraph of his PhD, Vanderwal (1973: 237) states 'that it is a matter for future archaeological research to define the westward boundaries of Austronesian influence in past centuries'. As noted earlier, Golson (1972) and Moore (1979) extended the model of 2000 year old Austronesian migrations along the southern Papuan coast westwards into Zenadh Kes. We concur with this model in part but place the date of the commencement of this Austronesian-inspired migration around 600 years earlier at 2600 years ago. Eight lines of evidence support our model. First, the existence of finely-crafted red-slipped pottery in Zenadh Kes 2400-2600 years ago without local antecedents indicates either importation of pottery or immigration of peoples with advanced pottery making skills. Pétrographie analysis of red-slipped pottery sherds from Mask Cave supports the second hypothesis. That is, around 2400-2600 years ago peoples with advanced pottery making skills moved into western Zenadh Kes and began manufacturing red-slipped pottery locally to establish Australia's first known pottery tradition. Second, red-slipped pottery, the key signifier of Austronesian movements and influences along the southern Papuan coast, has been shown to occur in Zenadh Kes 2400- 2600 years ago. Circumstantial evidence is consistent with the view that red-slipped pottery dated &gt;2000 years ago exists along the southern Papuan coast. Comparability in the form and age of ceramic traditions reveals broad-scale cultural connections and shared cultural traditions. It is implausible that peoples of Zenadh Kes and the adjacent southern Papuan coast both independently developed red- slipped pottery 2000-2600 years ago. Third, the appearance of dense, sustained midden deposits across Zenadh Kes 2600 years ago marks a major cultural change in the region. Barham (1999, 2000: 272) was the first researcher to draw attention to the significance of a 'c.2500 BP' 'phenomenon' (uncalibrated), which at that time equated with the 'maximum known age of occupation' for the Strait. The key sites cited by Barham (2000; see also Barham et al 2004) came from the Top Western Group (Woam on Saibai - 2890±60 BP) and Eastern Group (Sokoli on Dauar - 2840±50 BP; Ormi on Dauar - 2840±60 BP). As Barham et al (2004: 49) comment, these marine shell dates 'are almost exactly identical in age'. While calibration of these radiocarbon dates produces an age estimate a little older at 2550-2600 years ago (see Table 7 for details), the veracity of Barham's argument holds. For example, the argument is consistent with recently obtained dates of 2550-2600 years ago for the initiation of the major midden deposit at Bura Burass on Badu (the oldest known midden in the Western Group - Crouch et al in prep.). Barham (1999: 100) likewise associates the 2500 BP (2600 years ago) midden phenomenon with 'population movement (by people familiar with coastal wetland exploitation and perhaps agriculture) into the Torres Strait'. However in contrast to our model, he posits an eastward migration 'along the Irian [West Papua] coast' based on available information that Torres Strait at 2500 BP was 'aceramic'. Fourth, the dramatic development of midden sites across Zenadh Kes within the last 2600 years parallels the equally striking increase in occupational intensity of Mask Cave at this time. That is, Phase 2 dating 2100-2600 years ago (and mostly between 2400 and 2500 years ago) is marked by a dramatic increase in the discard of cultural materials from Phase 1 (Figure 9). This pattern is reinforced by the expansion of Phase 2 occupational deposits across to eastern sections of the site as revealed by Pits C and D. Such a major increase in activity is consistent with a substantial increase in people using Mask Cave starting 2600 years ago. In isolation, such an increase may simply reflect restructuring of local settlement patterns and the increased localised importance (and use) of Mask Cave linked to decreased use of other sites. However, when combined with similar and complementary archaeological evidence from the broader region, increases in site occupational intensity (at Mask Cave) can be more plausibly associated with absolute regional population increase (cf. midden develop- ment) linked to immigration (cf. introduction of red-slipped pottery). Fifth, Barham's (2000) concept of the Torres Strait Cultural Complex encapsulates the notion that broad-scale occupation of Zenadh Kes requires maritime specialists in terms of subsistence and technology. Such maritime specialisation reflects a local environmental reality - Zenadh Kes exhibits superabundances of marine foods and depauperate terrestrial faunas (McNiven and Hitchcock 2004).

Cave, Sokoli and Ormi is self explanatory. However, the fact that all of these early midden sites reveal shellfish, fish, turtles and/or dugongs, indicates that: the earliest occupants [were] already in possession of an extensive knowledge of a wide range of intertidal, nearshore and offshore marine environments and resources and the necessary technical skills and equipment to exploit them. The parsimonious conclusion is that first arrival, colonization and subsequent coastal resource use was predicated on sea-faring knowledge and canoe technology (Barham 2000: 225). The clear implication of these conditions is that the immigrants of 2600 years ago were advanced maritime specialists (Barham 2000: 225). The recovery of marine subsistence remains (e.g. shellfish, fish, turtle and dugong) in Early Ceramic Phase sites along the southern Papuan coastline is consistent with this view. Sixth, David et al (2004: 74) rightly note that oral traditions amongst various Torres Strait Islander com- munities record early colonising events by peoples from eastern Melanesia. At the beginning of our paper, we outlined key legendary stories in this regard, based largely on the recordings of Laade (1968). To summarise, Laade (1968: 156-8) notes that a common thread to these origin stories is that the 'uninhabited' islands of Zenadh Kes were colonised by peoples crossing the sea from places in New Guinea, mostly to the north or east and even to the extreme east (from the western Pacific). While David et al (2004) tentatively associate these stories with Papuo-Austronesian colonization 3000-4000 years ago, we tentatively associate these records with Papuan colonization starting 2600 years ago. In addition, since these stories refer to colonization of uninhabited islands, they may be more relevant to the Top Western and Eastern Groups as the Western Group was frequented or occupied, at least in part, at this time (see below). However, following David et al (2004: 75), available oral traditions concerning origins 'may but need not relate to the very first colonizing events'. Seventh, skeletal evidence reveals major similarities between Torres Strait Islanders and peoples of the Papuan Gulf. For example, Pietrusewsky's (1979: 107, 114) craniometrie analyses reveal that the 'combined Cape- York- Torres Strait sample associates with the Gulf District sample from Papua New Guinea which, in turn, clusters with the remaining New Guinea samples'. Major distinctions exist between these samples and samples from other parts of Aboriginal Australia. Van Dijk's (2005: 803) independent craniometrie investigations 'support' Pietrusewsky's findings. 'This suggests (not surprisingly) that there has been gene flow between Cape York and Torres Strait and the coastal regions of New Guinea' (van Dijk 2005: 802). Such gene flow is consistent with 'contact or migration' in the past (van Dijk 2005: 802). Eighth, the final line of evidence for the Papuan immigration model is the most obvious - Papuo- Austronesian influences on ethnographically-known Torres Strait Islander languages. David et al (2004: 74-5), based on Mitchell (1995), document a series of lexical resemblances between Austronesian and Zenadh Kes languages, giving examples from canoe and sea terminology. Barham (2000: 246), following Golson (1972: 392-93), also reminds us that Haddon (1937) observed that the term wangga used for canoe and darman used for canoe float by Aboriginal peoples of Cape Bedford 500km south of Zenadh Kes reveal Austronesian links. According to Haddon (1937: 192), 'Wangga is the equivalent of waka, 72</page><page sequence="25">which is the almost universal Austronesian word for an outrigger canoe and has many local variants, and the same applies to darman for float. For float we find in New Guinea: Motu, darima; Massim, sarima, sama, etc., and similar variants occur all over Melanesia, Polynesia, and elsewhere'. For example, moving along the coast west of Port Moresby (Motu) to the northern coast of Zenadh Kes the term for outrigger/float is garima (Gabadi), dalima (Nara), tarima (Roro), tariva (Toaripi), karima (Koriki), sarima (Kiwai), and harima (Mawata) (Dutton 1982: 77; Haddon 1937: 204). Significantly, in Zenadh Kes the terms for outrigger float in the Western-Central Language is saima or sarima, and sirib in Meriam Mir (Eastern Language) (Haddon 1937: 194, 204), while for the Gudang of Cape York the term is charima (MacGillivray 1852, II: 291). Haddon (1937: 204) concludes: It is thus evident that the name for the float of the outrigger among the Kiwaians and in western Torres Straits is a word that is common to the Austronesian group of languages; it could have arrived direct from Indonesia, but it is almost certain that it came from Indonesia by way of the extreme west of [island] Melanesia. The structure of the Torres Straits and Fly River outrigger disproves a direct Papuo-Melanesian origin, though there is little reason to doubt that a double- outrigger canoe with a float called sama, or some such term, arrived at an early date from western Oceania. Gulf-Trans-Fly 'homeland' With these eight lines of evidence we contend that Zenadh Kes was a western extension of demographic expansions along the southern Papuan coast initiated by Austronesian migrations to the Papuan tip region around 2600 years ago. Unfortunately, too little archaeological research has been undertaken along the southern Papuan coast west of the Kikori River (western Gulf) through to the Trans-Fly coast flanking the northern shores of Zenadh Kes to understand where and possibly why coastal Papuans moved into the Strait to become 'Islanders'. However, it seems clear that the 'homeland' is Non-Austronesian language areas somewhere along the Papuan Gulf through the Fly River estuary into the Trans-Fly (i.e. west of the Papuan Tip Austronesian languages) and not Austronesian language areas along the southeast Papuan coast east of the Gulf, otherwise Zenadh Kes Islanders would be Austronesian speakers. It is for this reason that we refer to the population influx at 2600 year ago as a Papuan migration and not an Austronesian migration. While it is likely that demographic expansions across both regions commencing 2600 years ago were associated with red-slipped pottery makers, this association is not necessary. Initial migrations may have taken place with pottery makers following a few generations latter once social relationships and networks had become established as conduits to facilitate long distance movement of ideas and material culture. The Mask Cave evidence indicates pottery making became established in Zenadh Kes sometime between 2400 and 2600 years ago. Migrations, language, and rock-art Our dual demographic expansion model (local Australian settlement expansion 3800 years ago followed by Papuan influx 2600 years ago) helps resolve the long-standing question of language origins in Zenadh Kes. As noted above, two major languages occur across Zenadh Kes (Wurm 1972). According to Shnukal (1998) and Shnukal and Mitchell (1998), the Western-Central Language of the western and central islands is foundationally an Aboriginal language with four major dialects - Kala Lagaw Ya of central western Zenadh Kes, Kalaw Kawaw Ya of north western Zenadh Kes, Kulkalgaw Ya (a.k.a. Dhadhalagaw Ya) of central Zenadh Kes and Kawalgaw Ya (a.k.a. Kowrareg) of the south western Zenadh Kes. In contrast, Islanders of the Eastern Group speak a Papuan language known as Meriam Mir. Significantly, while the Western- Central Language is referred to as an Aboriginal language, it has considerable Papuan elements. Wurm (1972: 345) pointed out that while 'Mabuiag [language] is undoubtedly basically Australian in its structure and a portion of its basic vocabulary ... some features of its phonology are completely un-Australian'. Furthermore, 'the Mabuiag phoneme inventory look quite similar to that of a phonologically simple Papuan language. In fact, it is very close to that of the neighbouring Papuan Miriam [sic] language' (Wurm 1972: 347). Thus, the 'Australian influence on Miriam [sic] is negligible in contrast to the quite strong Papuan influence in Mabuiag' (Wurm 1972: 349). After considering a wide range of linguistic influences across Zenadh Kes, Wurm (1972: 364) advanced the following migration hypothesis to account for these influences: Miriam [sic] speakers appear to have left the [Papuan] mainland and settled on the eastern islands of Torres Strait. It seems likely that people from the same, or perhaps a more westerly Papuan linguistic area or both, moved southwards into the western islands of Torres Strait, adopting an Australian language ... probably spoken at the time on at least some of the islands, but largely maintaining their Papuan, more exactly Miriam- type, phonology with only a few concessions to the Australian language. The archaeologically-based Australian-Papuan settle- ment model outlined in this paper is consistent with Wurm's linguistically-based migration model. That is, occupation of the Western Group by Aboriginal language speakers up until 2600 years ago when Papuan peoples moved into eastern and western Zenadh Kes. In terms of the eastern islands, Carter (2002: 7-8) similarly linked the 2600 year date for Papuan influx with the establishment of Meriam Mir. In terms of the western islands, Sidney Ray (1907: 509) advanced a comparable dual settlement model, stating that it resolved the 'difficult to reconcile ... non- Australian physical appearance of the Western Islanders with the Australian form of their language.' No information is available to model processes of ancient interaction between Papuans and Aboriginal people on the 73</page><page sequence="26">western islands of Zenadh Kes. Indeed, at this juncture the genetic status of peoples occupying the islands of Zenadh Kes before 2600 years ago is unknown. As pre-2600 year occupants of the region appear to be descendants of peoples dating back to land-bridge times of lower sea level at least 8000 years ago (see David et al 2004), the degree to which they might be described as genetically 'Aboriginal' (Birdsell 1993: 440) or 'Melanesian' (or a complex mixture of both) is a matter for speculation until pre-2600 year old skeletal remains are forthcoming. For these reasons we simply refer to these early peoples as 'Australian'. In contrast, major movements of Papuans into Zenadh Kes commencing 2600 years ago are associated with Melanesian peoples. This immigration would have enhanced any existing Papuan genetic influences across western Zenadh Kes (a region of Papuan-Aboriginal genetic admixture extending back into the Pleistocene); a picture complicated further by cultural and genetic transfers across Zenadh Kes throughout the last 2600 years. An implication of the language admixture model is that the Australian presence in the Western Group was considerable during the period 3000-3800 years ago. Indeed it is unlikely the Western-Central Language could be an Australian language if such speakers only used the islands ephemerally. This inference provides further support for David et al.'s (2004: 74) suggestion that the Western Group saw 'permanent occupation after 3000-3500 years BP'. Our Australian-Papuan settlement model may account for the curious division of rock-art in Zenadh Kes. McNiven and David (2004) document that engraving sites in Zenadh Kes are restricted to the Eastern Group and the Meriam Mir Language, while painting (including stencil) sites are restricted to the Top Western, Western and Central Groups and Western-Central Language. While it was acknowledged that geological substrate may play some role in the form of rock-art across the Strait, McNiven and David (2004: 221) suggest that 'the eastern engravings reflect Papuan/ Melanesian origins while the western paintings belong to an Aboriginal tradition of place marking'. In this connection, Cole and David (1992: 5, 7, 15) pointed out that the engravings of the Eastern Group 'have no resemblances to any recorded petroglyphs in Cape York Peninsula' and may 'fit within the category of "decorated monoliths'" known for mainland Papua New Guinea (see Specht 1979). Alternatively, the paintings of Zenadh Kes show resemblances to painting traditions of both Cape York and New Guinea (see also McNiven et al 2004). Such a scenario matches our model positing a Papuan settlement of the eastern Zenadh Kes and a mixed Australian/Papuan settlement of western Zenadh Kes. Hunter-gatherers vs horticulturalists An inevitable question stemming from our dual demographic expansion model for late Holocene Zenadh Kes is whether the c.3000-3800 year ago Australian demographic expansion phase should be associated with hunter-gatherers and the later 2600 year old Papuan influx phase linked to the introduction of horticulture? In a nutshell we say yes. However, as the following discussion reveals, the issue of horticultural introduction to Zenadh Kes is debated. Following Barham's (1999) evidence for the development of mound and ditch systems on Saibai around 1200 BP, Barham et al (2004: 52) saw horticulture as a late introduction to Zenadh Kes linked to population increase and the need to intensify food production: 'we would see the later prehistoric differential pattern of intensive horticulture on high islands as representing a response to carrying capacities being approached'. Alternatively, Carter (2002: 5-7) reports the tentative identification of sweet potato (Ipomoea spp.) starch grains and ginger (Zingiberaceae) phytoliths in the lower levels of Sokoli (SU 14) dated back to 2600 years ago and banana (Musaceae) phytoliths in the lower levels of Ormi dated 1900-2600 years ago. Barham et al (2004: 48, 72) dispute these claims for early horticulture on Dauar, noting that some of the plant species may be wild varieties and that the plant microfossils (starch grains and phytoliths) may have penetrated deeper into older sediments through downward disturbance. While vertical displacement remains a potential issue with the Sokoli and Ormi microfossil evidence (Barham et al 2004: 48, 72), Carter (2004: 251) points out that Barham's (1999) identification of 1200 year old mound and ditch systems on Saibai represents a date for only one form of horticultural system in the region and not 'for earlier, less intensive horticultural systems, such as those found on the Murray Islands'. Carter's (2002, 2004) argument for early horticultural systems in the Murray Islands is both empirically likely and theoretically plausible. As Golson (1972) argued, it is unlikely that any of the islands of Zenadh Kes, except for the larger continental western islands of Murulag (205km2), Mua (171km2) and Badu (104km2), are capable of supporting resident groups of hunter-gatherers. We agree with Golson (1972: 389) that 'horticulture was essential to maintain a viable population' on the eastern islands, but only in terms of separate island communities. As Barham et al (2004: 42) rightly state, 'horticulture might reasonably be argued to be a pre-requisite for sedentism/permanent occupation' of individual eastern island communities such as Mer. Even in the case of the larger western islands, resident groups of hunter-gatherers would be of modest size and need to maintain strong alliances with their neighbours (possibly including groups living on the immediate mainland of Cape York), to remain economically and socially viable. The limiting factors are plant foods followed by drinking water (McNiven and Hitchcock 2004: 123). As Haddon (1890: 359) stated, '[t]he small size of the islands and the difficulty in procuring food, especially of a vegetable character, were very strong reasons for limiting population'. In marked contrast, the seas and reefs surrounding islands provide a superabundance of marine protein to the extent that 'Islanders could harvest from their waters at least an order of magnitude more seafood than they do today' and maintain sustainability (Johannes and MacFarlane 1991: 198). 74</page><page sequence="27">Under this scenario of the horticultural viability model, Pulu (&lt;lkm2) and nearby Mabuyag (8km2) are too small to support a resident hunter-gatherer population. As such, the territorial domain of hunter-gatherers camping at Mask Cave before 2600 years ago most likely included larger islands, the obvious option being nearby Badu, with possible extensions to other islands in southwest Torres Strait and Cape York. This view does not contradict the possibility of a permanent human presence on Badu before 2600 years ago (David et al 2004: 75), it simply states that the annual seasonal round of hunter-gatherers using Badu before 2600 years ago included neighbouring islands (and possibly Cape York). Such connections most likely provide an ancestral basis to the current close socio-political relationship between Mabuyag and Badu. Harris (1979: 96) points out that 19th century ethnographic records also reveal the 'economic interdependence of Badu and Mabuiag'. The arrival of Papuan horticulturalists on Pulu (and most likely Mabuyag) 2600 years ago does not automatically indicate establishment of a viable, horticulturally-based resident group as recorded ethnographically (see Haddon 1912: 3, 1935: 55-62). We posit that horticulture (or some related plant food intensification strategy) is simply a prerequisite for transformation of most, if not all, Torres Strait islands into economically and socially viable residential islands. Thus, at what point Mabuyag became a residential island and a separate people (i.e. the Goemulgal) with their own identity after 2600 years ago is unknown and a question for future archeological research. However, it will be interesting to see if such developments coincide with initiation of more recent occupational phases of nearby Mask Cave: Phase 3 (1700 years ago) or Phase 4 (1500 years ago), or coincident with major cultural changes across Zenadh Kes of the last 600-800 years (McNiven 2006a). Similarly, viable settlement of the Eastern Group 2600 years ago by Papuan colonists may pre-date the development of separate and distinctive residential and horticulturally-based communities on Ugar, Erub and the Murray Island Group. Conclusions Ian Lilley (2006: 2) in his introduction to Archaeology of Oceania observed that 'new evidence from Torres Strait is beginning to tie Australia to late Holocene developments in Island Melanesia and the wider Pacific as well as mainland New Guinea in ways unimagined by most Australian and Pacific archaeologists until now'. In this connection, the dual demographic expansion model for the origins of Torres Strait Islanders outlined in this paper taps into cultural processes being played out across western Oceania over the last 4000 years. Local population increases in the western islands of the Strait beginning 3800 years ago paralleled demographic changes in northeast Australia, especially along the tropical coast of central Queensland; changes mirroring socio-demographic intensification in numerous regional and cultural settings across the Australian continent (Lourandos 1997; see also O'Connor 1992). Similarly, the movement of Papuans southwards into the Strait around 2600 years ago was an historical extension of one of the greatest migration events in the ancient world - the Austronesian settlement of Island SE Asia, the Pacific and the Indian Ocean. The signature of the early Austronesian mariners was (but not exclusively) red-slipped pottery, which makes its entry into the archaeological record of the Austronesian homeland of Island SE Asia 4000 years ago (Bell wood 1997a: 232, 1997b: 47; Spriggs 2003a). From here the pottery tradition spreads eastwards and in its most celebrated elaboration becomes the Lapita dentate-stamped red-slipped wares of Island Melanesia (Kirch 1997; Spriggs 2003a). Around 2800-2500 years ago, the Lapita Cultural Complex underwent a range of transformations and associated settlement expansions in the Bismarck Archipelago (e.g. Summerhayes 2003; Torrence and Stevenson 2000), extending to Post-Lapita Austronesian expansions, more or less associated with red-slipped pottery, into Remote Oceania (e.g. Green 2003: 96; Spriggs 2003b) and possibly western Micronesia (Anderson 2003). We contend that Post-Lapita demographic expansions of the western Pacific 2800-2500 years ago reached out to the southern Papua New Guinea coast with follow-on effects to Zenadh Kes of northeastern Australia. Fifteen years ago, Irwin (1991: 503) stated that the early red-slipped wares of the southern Papuan coast 'will probably prove to be derived ultimately from Lapita pottery but the gap in time and space has yet to be documented'. In this paper we have advanced an argument that helps close this temporal gap but opened up a new and unanticipated spatial dimension. That is, red-slipped pottery existed 2400-2600 years ago within Zenadh Kes on Pulu located 90km north of mainland Australia. The question open for future research is whether these wares were traded to Cape York and/or whether these pottery making skills crossed to the Australian mainland.
