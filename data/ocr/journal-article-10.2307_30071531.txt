The project has continued with excavation seasons in 2001oo, 200oo2 and 2003.2 Thus the surface survey and related studies form part of an overall strategy of research, albeit a self-contained part. Indeed there is a broader context still, which has grown out of the British School at Athens' mission at Sparta. Throughout the BSA's connection with Laconia there has been a balance between topographical (or landscape) archaeology and the urban archaeology of Sparta. In the renewed phase of BSA activity in Laconia, since 1973, this latter has looked, in particular, to the Bronze Age, with the excavations at the Menelaion,s and to Hellenistic, Roman and Medieval Sparta with 1 The 1999 season at Kouphovouno in Laconia was a synergasia between the British School at Athens and the 5th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities, under a permit granted by the Greek Ministry of Culture. Dr Th. Spyropoulos took overall responsibility on behalf of the Ephorate for academic supervision of the project and we have discussed the results of the fieldwork, which are presented in this report. We are extremely grateful to him and his colleagues, S. Raftopoulou, N. Themos, and E. Zavvou, for advice and assistance, as well as access to facilities where the finds could be processed and stored. Dr Lena Papazoglou-Manioudaki kindly supplied us with information on the Neolithic stone artefacts now in the prehistoric collection of the National Museum. We thank David Blackman, Director of the British School at Athens, and his staff for their constant help and support. The equipment for coring was hired out to us to us by the Institute for Geological and Mineral Exploration, Athens. The project was generously funded by the British School at Athens, the Institute for Aegean Prehistory, the Ecole Frangaise d'Athenes, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, CNRS, the British Academy and the Universities of Nottingham, Liverpool, and Bretagne-Sud.

RENARD excavations and survey in the theatre and by and on the acropolis.4 However, it is now clear that the Neolithic period is one of the least known, and Kouphovouno (FIGS. 1-3), the main settlement of that period, 'Neolithic Sparta', was an obvious focus for further research. In what follows we shall summarize our plans for the whole project and the place of the intensive survey of 1999-2000 within that strategy. Moreover, the site has an importance which goes beyond the regional. The overarching research rationale of the Kouphovouno Project arises in part from the debate about the rise of complex societies in Greece, over the course of the Middle Neolithic-Early Bronze FIG. 1.

Intensive survey has demonstrated that few Middle- Late Neolithic sites survive in southern Greece,5 the earliest identified in the course of the Laconia Survey were Final Neolithic, and very few have been excavated. In central and northern Greece the situation is quite different. This 'north-south divide' must be faced, if the change of settlement in the Final Neolithic and the subsequent development of more complex societies in the Early Helladic period is to be understood.

The publication, in recent years, of the results of a number of surface surveys has underlined the fundamental reshaping of settlement and society during these critical periods. The site of Kouphovouno, in the light of earlier excavations and the survey, seemed particularly well suited to throw light on these questions. But before we proceeded to excavation, it was important to establish the overall size of the settlement, whether it fluctuated in extent over time, and which periods</page><page sequence="5">'SPARTA BEFORE SPARTA' 53 precisely were represented at the site. These were important questions that we sought to answer through the surface survey. A second research aspect is methodological and arises from the application of a surface survey. The relationship of what is recorded on the surface to the archaeology under the surface has hardly been explored in Greece. The Kouphovouno Project is designed to investigate this relationship, based on the methods developed in the Laconia Rural Sites Project.9 This research orientation has led us to establish the following objectives: (i) refine the chronological framework by establishing a stratigraphic sequence for the MN, LN and EH periods with 14C; (ii) investigate the technology of architecture, and the organization of domestic space; (iii) collect environmental evidence to model the subsistence economy and natural setting of the site; (iv) undertake scientific analysis of ceramic and lithic technologies for information on exchange and craft specialization; (v) recover human remains and study their funerary context; (vi) study geomorphology and tell formation processes as a control on survey and excavation results and to throw light on changes in the environment; (vii) compare the distribution of surface remains with excavated evidence. Plainly many of these objectives are to be met through the excavation phase of the project, but (vi) and (vii) were particularly prominent in the survey, and the finds also enabled us to get not only a useful overview of the pottery and stone tools, but also a means of judging how representative the assemblage from the excavations would be of the site as a whole. PREVIOUS HISTORY OF RESEARCH There is a preface to the first excavations at Kouphovouno. In 1891 Wolters reported a group of finds from the 'vicinity of Sparta',io five female figurines (FIG. 4) and two stone vessels of white marble, as well as two green stone beads." This must have been a single find, and the objects date together, as Wolters observed." They had been purchased by the Archaeology Society inJuly 1878 from a well-known antiquarian, I. Palaiologos, and were subsequently transferred to the National Museum.13 It is assumed that they must have come from Kouphovouno, which is often given as their provenance, but Phelps expresses reservations about this because the shape of the stone vessels recalls transitional 9 W.

However, a case can be made for a later date. LN shoulder bowls have the rounded rim, semiglobular shape and ledge lugs of the larger of the two stone vessels. The pedestal bowl could also be MN or LN. White marble bowls, again with a pronounced rim, have been found in LN or FN contexts in the Alepotrypa Cave.'16 An EN date for the figurines has been questioned by Perlks and Phelps is not convinced that they are MN either.'7 Papathanassopoulos and Talalay opt for MN or LN.'8 Talalay has drawn attention to the nearly identical proportions used for three of the 'Kouphovouno' figurines (NM3927, NM393o, and NM3932) and one from Aigina.'s She wonders how 'the same mathematical canon' could appear at two sites so far apart and offers various explanations. The proportions of a marble figurine from Alepotrypa are also similar in some respects and this piece, which closely resembles NM3928, is presumably LN or FN.2o A similar date is not out of the question for the Aigina figurine, as Phelps has observed." So it seems more likely that the group of finds in the National Museum is LN, or possibly FN, in which case they may be from Kouphovouno. Other sites of this period in Laconia, such as the Goritsa or Alepochori caves, cannot be ruled out but they are not so obviously in the vicinity of Sparta. We can only speculate on the context from which these finds came but the splendid tattooed lady, NM3928, with her polos headdress is a figure of some authority. In 1941, O.-W. von Vacano, the German archaeologist, carried out a series of soundings on the east slope of the tell at Kouphovouno, with the aim of determining the stratigraphy and chronology of the site. He excavated down to the natural soil and exposed undisturbed archaeological strata, in parts up to 2.50 m in depth, which indicated a relatively dense occupation of the site between the MN and EH II periods. From just below the modern surface he revealed remains of clay and stone constructions as well as burials, and recovered a large number of ceramic, stone and bone artefacts. Von Vacano had intended to continue exploring the site, but his plans, in the conditions of the Second World War, were frustrated and he did not pursue his research in Laconia any further.22 In 1985 J. Renard undertook the publication of von Vacano's work at Kouphovouno, aided by the excavation notebooks, plans, and sections, and drawings which the excavator placed at her disposal. The finds, stored at Sparta Museum, were restudied in the light of the advances made at other sites on mainland Greece over the intervening 40 years. This study, published in 1989,23 confirmed the importance of the site for understanding settlement and the way of life of Neolithic and Early Bronze Age peoples in the southern Peloponnese and contributed to the establishment of the programme undertaken in 1999- 14 Phelps 1975, 115.

CAVANAGH, C. MEE, J. RENARD ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES BY P. A. JAMES AND M. KOUSOULAKOU The history of the site of Kouphovouno spans eight-tenths of the Holocene, with occupation over 6,oo000 years of this period. The site developed, changed, and has in part survived, despite its location near the foot of one of the most impressive mountain-fronts in Greece. Moreover, it is on the floor of a graben (a downthrown block between two parallel faults) in one of the country's most tectonically active areas, in a climatic region known for its high rates of erosion and deposition. Stream erosion has failed to destroy the site, which presumably was chosen because of its slight elevation above the valley floor. But how much of the site survives? How deep are its archaeological strata, what do they contain, and what are their geochemical and other properties? How has the archaeological record been affected by geomorphological change? How has the landscape-the landforms, soils, and vegetation-in the local area of the Sparta Basin changed since the site was established? These are the questions addressed in our pre-excavation geoarchaeological studies. The research has followed two complementary lines, surface survey, and coring. We have surveyed the landforms, sediment exposures and topsoils within 500 m of the site, have completed a limited survey of topsoil mineral magnetic properties across the site, and made a broad study of the range of rocks, sediments and soils within the larger catchment of the River Eurotas and its tributaries. Twenty cores, ranging in depth from 0.94 m to to m, have been taken on and off-site. Soils and sediments from the cores have undergone a number of mineral magnetic, chemical, micromorphological, and other physical analyses. Essential to the interpretation of our data and reconstruction of landscape change will be the radiocarbon dating of charcoal and other material sampled from the cores. The interpretations we make here are based on very little chronological data and therefore are tentative and provisional. PHYSICAL SETTING Kouphovouno today stands with its summit about 5 m above the gently eastward-sloping floor of the Sparta Basin, at 195 m above sea level, 3.7 km east of the Taygetos mountains, and 1.5 km to the south of the outskirts of modern Sparta (FIG. 5). The hill, depending on the definition of its limits, measures some 170 m north to south and 150 m west to east. The northern limit of the site comprises the 4-m-deep trench of an ephemeral stream which flows from the Taygetos mountains through a gorge at Parori (the stream is referred to as the Parori stream below). At the mouth of the gorge, 305 masl, is the apex of an alluvial fan, one of a coalescing series forming the western margin of the basin, below the mountain-front (FIG. 5). The outer margin of the fan, as defined by the stony sediment at the surface and a slightly higher gradient as compared with the modern basin floor, lies 300 m to the west of the site-centre. The Parori stream is entrenched through the fan and for most of its continuing course across the plain to the river Eurotas, 2.45 km to the east of the site (165 masl). The Sparta Basin comprises a graben, in which several hundred metres of sediment have accumulated since the Pliocene.24 The surface geology, as mapped by the Institute of Geological and Mineral Exploration (IGME),25 is shown in FIG. 5. The oldest sediments 24 D.J. W. Piper, G. Pe-Piper, N. Kontopoulos, and A. G.

RENARD mapped by IGME on the basin floor are Pliocene or Lower Pleistocene lacustrine deposits, comprising marls and red clays alternating with conglomerates of varied composition. They form isolated hills which run approximately down the middle of the basin. To the west of Kouphovouno, covering much of the western half of the basin, and lying within 200oo m of the site, are shown Pleistocene alluvial deposits, including those of the alluvial fans. These sediments are described as locally very cohesive, with clayey or carbonate cement.26 Holocene alluvium is mapped extensively in the eastern half of the basin, including the areas on both sides of the Skatia and Parori streams, and the location of Kouphovouno. On the basis of field observations in the 197os, Bintliff had presented a somewhat different map of the geology of the Sparta plain, showing a Neogene outcrop to be very much more extensive than the Pliocene/Pleistocene indicated by IGME.27 He referred to 'the complex situation' surrounding Kouphovouno, with brown or reddish soils around the hill and 'dark alluvial silt' to the west of the site. On the hill could be seen exposures of 'very bright yellow clay', and above the Parori stream, close to the site, a 2 m exposure of 'yellowy/white marly sand'.s8 These sediments, and therefore the hill of Kouphovouno, Bintliff ascribed to the Neogene. Our own impressions during a visit to Kouphovouno in 1994 were also that the core of the hill may comprise a remnant of a Quaternary or older sediment, though this was based solely on the relief of the area, there being no exposures visible. The alluvial fans along the Taygetos mountain-front are described by IGME as Pleistocene talus cones.29 Four of the fans (excluding that below Parori) have been studied in detail by Pope and Millington,s"o who, from thermoluminescence dating and archaeological evidence, conclude that restricted proximal and medial fan segments date from the Pleistocene, and that final deposition on lower distal segments occurred during the Early Hellenistic (the A. Ioannis fan) and Early Byzantine (Kalivia Sochas fan) periods. They consider that, from the Late Pleistocene to mid Holocene, deposition of sediments eroded from the mountain catchments was restricted to proximal segments, and that extension of deposition basin-ward, to form medial and distal portions of the fans, began after forest clearance in the Taygetos during the Classical and Hellenistic periods. For evidence of this clearing, they refer to Bolte and Philippson.3' At least for the fan below Kalivia Sochas, Pope and Millington believe that further significant deposition occurred during the Late Roman period, probably following land disturbance in the stream catchment. These authors quote data for depths of fan sediments, giving 65 to 150 m for proximal, 18 to 36 m for medial, and 4 to 8 m for most distal segments.32 They suggest that, by the end of the Middle Byzantine period, stream channels had become continuous through the fan environment.33 We find that deposition of flood gravels on proximal fan surfaces, and of muds on the lowland to the east of their margins, continued up to the late twentieth century.34 26 Ibid. 27 J.

Of the topsoil variables measured in the Laconia Rural Sites Project, magnetic susceptibility had proved to be the most closely associated with archaeological data showing concentration of former activity at sites.35 Volume magnetic susceptibility (K) of the soil was measured in the field at 12 cm depth, using a Bartington MS2 probe,36 along two transects across the site and adjacent lowlands (N-S and E-W in FIG. 6). A more extensive sampling of topsoils was planned, but attention was focused on sediment coring. Nine to cm-diameter cores were obtained by IGME, using a heavy rotary drill, eight cores of 5 m and one of to m depth. Five (C1 to C5) were spaced at c. 25 m intervals southward from the hill summit, the last of these being off the hill (FIG. 7). C6 and C7 were taken on the hill-flank and adjacent lower surface on the east side, C8 at the base of the west side of the hill, and Cg in the shallow depression to the west of the site. The cores were described and sampled in the field by PeterJames and AlisonJones, then transported for storage at the British School at Athens. Core samples have been kept in cold storage in Liverpool. The cores had to be described in some haste in the field, and, in view of the disintegration of sections of the cores when they were released from the drill, the use of water in the drilling, and approximate measure of depths, the study of the 1999 cores is at a reconnaissance level. The evidence, nevertheless, is invaluable. 2000 A hand-held 'Makita' percussion corer was tested off-site and three 5 cm-diameter cores successfully taken: Clo (5.11 m deep, 200 m to the south-west of the hill summit), C11 (3.87 m deep, 180 m to the south-east), and C19 (3.92 m deep and 575 m to the south- south-west). They were described and sampled in the field by Peter James and Maria Kousoulakou. Two critical areas where we did not have access were the land where irrigated olives and vegetables are grown on the north side of the site, and the orange grove and garden to the east and north-east. A reconnaissance study was made of the geomorphology of the Sparta Basin and adjacent uplands by Peter James and Amy Clarke. Areas of all major rock and sediment types were visited in order to record the range of weathered materials and soils of the Eurotas catchment. This provided the broad geomorphological context of Kouphovouno and defined the range of potential sources for fluvial and lacustrine sediments within the basin. 200I Following the success with the percussion corer in 2000, an attempt was made to core the archaeological and underlying natural strata of the hill of Kouphovouno. The advantages of this corer are manoeuvrability, precise measurement of depth, and uncontaminated, if small, samples. It had been hoped that persistence with coring would meet with success 35 Cavanagh, Mee, and James (n. 9). 36 J. A. Dearing, 'Magnetic susceptibility', inJ. Walden, F. Oldfield, andJ.

At C17, a corer gouge became stuck in the deposits, and could not be retrieved. If we were to core again, we should seek a heavier percussion machine. Cores C13g to C17 on the hill (FIG. 7) varied between 0.94 and 1.97 m in depth. C18 (5.99 m) was taken to the north of the site, in the sediments adjacent to the Parori stream trench, and Ci9 (1.68 m), 2 m north of a bank on the north side of the hill, referred to below.

LABORATORY ANALYSES Mineral magnetic, chemical, particle-size, and micromorphological evidence from the core samples is used for the following: (i) to reinforce and improve upon inferences drawn from the stratigraphic data of the cores, including the definition of the lower boundary of the archaeological strata where this was reached; (ii) to throw light on the geomorphological evolution of the site and changes in its surrounding environment during the Holocene; (iii) to provide a reconnaissance study of the range of mineral, magnetic, chemical, and other characteristics of the archaeological sediments, and of the contrast between these and natural sediments; and (iv) to evaluate post-depositional effects of pedological and other diagenetic changes in the archaeological and natural sediments. (iii) and (iv) are being used in the design of the sampling and analysis of soils taken from the trenches during excavation of the site. Analyses of the core samples have been</page><page sequence="14">62 W. CAVANAGH, C. MEE, J. RENARD undertaken in Liverpoolo7 and at the Fitch Laboratory in the British School at Athens (preparation and analysis by Maria Kousoulakou of sixteen micromorphological thin sections from Clo, Cix, and C12). Pollen and diatom analysis was attempted on the natural sediments, but only one diatom and pollen of only Abies were found. Samples from the cores are to be submitted for ,4C dating. Mineral magnetic analyses have been completed on all core samples, but other physical and chemical analyses on only C1, C6, C8, and C2o from the tell, and C9, and Clo off-site. Selective reference is made to the analytical data in this report, their full evaluation will appear elsewhere. SUMMARY OF FIELD OBSERVATIONS, WITH REFERENCE TO SELECTED LABORATORY DATA Landform morphology Steepest slope angles measured on the flanks of Kouphovouno were around 31/20 (except for the bank described below). The northern side of the hill is the most gently sloping: from the hill-summit towards the Parori stream the slope is at first 2o 30', then reduces to io 40-. To west of north, the intensively farmed area, this slope is uninterrupted; to east of north it is cut by the bank referred to above, the origin of which we have not determined. The bank begins near core position C19, passing 3 m to the south of it, where it is at its highest, i.o m. It runs for 191 m from the north side of the hill around the circumference of the east side, where it becomes less well defined, to peter out on the south side, at the boundary between two land holdings. The surface on which cores C18 and C19 were taken, between the bank and the Parori stream, slopes eastward at &lt;1io. Where not cut by stream-trench or terrace, land within 300 m of the site slopes at &lt;2o, toward the east. To the west of Kouphovouno, however, a shallow, flat-floored depression separates the site from the distal fan sediments. Phases of erosion and deposition by the Parori stream have resulted in the deep trench of the present channel, late (?) Holocene sediments adjacent to this, and two terraces in the vicinity of the site. One terrace, 25 m at its widest and a maximum of 2 m below the adjacent land, borders the stream trench where it runs a southward course for c. too m, some 150 m to the north-west of the hill summit. The second terrace, on the north side of the trench opposite the site, is 40 m at its widest and lies 2.5 m below the land to the north of it. Sediments and soils Sediments examined in the cores and natural exposures within 500 m of the site are classified in TABLE 1, in order of decreasing tentative age. Selected characteristics of the cores and of one stream-trench exposure are described in TABLE 2. The topsoils of the area are fertile, brown (hue to yR38), stony fine loams, usually with blocky structure, and 37 Total amounts were determined for P, Pb, Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn, Ca, Mg, Na, K (all determined using nitric plus perchloric acid digestion and atomic absorption spectro- photometer or colorimeter) and organic C (using the Walkley-Black potassium dichromate digestion method: P. R. Hesse, A Textbook of Soil Chemical Analysis (London, 1971)). Free carbonate is determined gasometrically and reported as %o CaCO. The chemical and mineral magnetic analyses were carried out by Caroline Owen, Sarah Jackson, Anne-Flore Marziou, Maria Kousoulakou, Irene Cooper, Alan Henderson, and Bob Jude, using methods described in J.

A scattering of cobbles covers the tell, and the surrounding surfaces, particularly to the south and east, are quite stony. Cultural strata On the tell, these comprise archaeological materials; in the lower land at least to the west, south, and south-east of the tell, artefacts are mixed with alluvial sediments. The boundary between archaeological layers and underlying natural sediment is not easily defined in the stratigraphy of all cores. For example, red inclusions (usually around 2.5 YR 4/6), most &lt;1 mm in diameter, occurred in both anthropogenic and natural sediments. In some cases these were ceramic fragments, for example in mud-brick, in others they appeared to be weathered red sandstone, which was found in larger pieces in several of the cores. The base of the archaeological strata is defined in FIGS. 8 a and b on the basis of the deepest artefact observed. This depth is compared with the position of the 'magnetic threshold', the lower boundary of material with relatively high concentration of ferrimagnetic minerals, notably fine-grained magnetite and maghaemite, which form in well-drained topsoils and particularly where earth is burned.39 The threshold is defined using several magnetic parameters, including mass-specific low frequency susceptibility (Xf), saturated isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM) and measures of reverse-field remanence defining 'soft' magnetic properties.4o Also shown is the deepest charcoal fragment observed. Given the generally good correspondence between features recorded in the cores and magnetic properties, we believe the base of the archaeological strata to be quite well constrained in FIGS 8 a and b. The cultural layers of the tell (5A, TABLE 1) are deepest on the south slope, reaching 4.36 m in C2. In this core, a Middle Neolithic sherd was identified 0.52 m above the base of the cultural strata. On the east side of the hill, core C6 has shallower archaeological deposits with fewer artefacts and other anthropogenic features. In Ci19, to the north of the bank described above, there are many small ceramic and charcoal fragments above the base of the archaeological layer, which appears to lie at 1.02 m, though the core was only 1.2o m deep. The archaeological strata of the tell are rich in building stone, mud-brick, floor material, and ceramic fragments. Signs of burning abound in reddened soil and charcoal. Where not burned, colours are mostly of hue to YR. In the majority of the cores, these horizons are significantly more stony than underlying natural sediments. The texture of the fine matrix varies from clay to loamy sand, the finer textures predominating. In C1, for example, the &lt;16 micron fraction varies between 55%/0 and 650/0 of the &lt;1 mm material, by volume. In terms of the magnetic values of the minerals, the archaeological horizons are significantly 'softer' than underlying sediments, containing higher concentrations of fine, ferrimagnetic minerals. Highest values for X, 400-600 x 10-.8 m3 kg', occur in the deepest archaeological sediments, in cores C2, Cg, and C4 on the south flank of the hill, except for one peak of 1284 x lo-8 ms kg' at 1.62 m in C8.

From the west, values follow an increasing trend toward the hill and up its west side to beyond the summit at core C1, with marked peaks at the top of the bank and within the orange grove to the east of the hill. In the four cores from the tell which were analysed geochemically (C1, C6, C8 and C2o), the cultural horizons proved to be distinct from the natural sediments, but the nature of this distinction varies appreciably between cores, reflecting the variety of anthropogenic materials and the processes of their transformation. Calcium carbonate, organic C, and P consistently have higher concentrations than underlying sediments. Ca, Mg, Mn, Na, Pb, Cu, and Zn have much more variable patterns, all being enhanced in the cultural deposits of at least one of the cores. In C1, for example, Pb, Cu, and Zn, anthropogenic traces in archaeological soils of Boeotia' and Laconia42, have distinctly lower values in the archaeological strata; in C8 the trace metals are significantly higher in the cultural deposits. 41 J.

Transects A-B and C-D through the tell and its periphery, showing the depth of the chief cores, the deepest artefact and charcoal observed in each, and the base of magnetically enhanced sediment. Strata with concentrations of artefacts and evidence of the effects of burning occurred off the tell in cores C5 and C9, and in the top 0.50 m of the stream channel-bank exposure, Si (FIG. 7). The top of section Si (gB in TABLE 1) lacks the architectural features encountered on the tell but contained many ceramic artefacts, including a 15-cm-long Late Neolithic sherd. In contrast, the few artefacts in the top 0.65 m of the alluvial sediment of C18 are worn and appear to have been transported by the stream. Clo and Ci1, at some distance from the hill, contain artefacts in alluvium to 0.97 m and 0.66 m, respectively. C12, at 575 m from the tell-summit, had no artefacts. In all these cores, the deposits containing archaeological materials have distinctly 'softer' magnetic properties than the culturally sterile units. In the two cores for which we have chemical data, the units with artefacts in Clo have higher concentrations of organic C, P, Zn, and Pb, and, in Cg, of organic C, P, Cu, K, and Na. Natural sediments beneath the hill (Cz-4, C6, C8, C2 o) These (1 in TABLE 1) comprise compact alluvial and lacustrine deposits. The sediments are in large part clay-rich, with thin units of flood gravels. In certain cores there are significant depths of clay and silty clay units (7.5 m in core C6) with few, if any, stones. In</page><page sequence="19">'SPARTA BEFORE SPARTA' 67 three of the cores, C1, C4, C6, there occurred fine (predominantly &lt;1 to 2 mm thick; maximum 6 mm) horizontal colour banding in fine-textured units. In places, the colour banding comprised laminae of different particle-size, indicating rhythmic changes in sedimentation in a relatively still body of water. Such banded or laminated sediment was not found in any core taken in the lowland around the hill. Where the banding does not occur, colours have hues of to YR (with generally higher chroma and value than in the overlying cultural strata) and 2.5 Y. Hydromorphic, red iron mottles and bands, and black mottles and nodules of manganese occur. Alluvial sediments of the lowland around the hill (C5, C7, C9-z2, Ci8) These are alluvial and mudflow deposits comprising units rich in silt and clay, many with stones, interspersed with flood gravels. No clear palaeo-surfaces were visible in the natural sediments, but there were indications of possible buried topsoil material in the mineral magnetic and chemical properties of Cg, Clo, and C1 i. The clearest of these occurred in a stony clay unit in Clo, between 4.25 and 4.55 m, where peaks in 'soft' magnetic properties coincide with higher organic C, P, Zn, Ca, Mn, and clay content (FIG. 9). The unit was brown and reddish-brown but lacked other topsoil morphological features. Micromorphological analysis by Maria Kousoulakou shows no root remains, but amorphous, reddish-brown inclusions which may contain organic matter.43 In C9, 78 m to the east of C1o, there is no layer which correlates with the brown stony clay unit of Clo, but the core revealed a dark, sandy clay loam, in places stony, to a depth of 3.88 m. Between 2.00 and 3.88 m there were abundant red inclusions (most 1 mm diameter), some fine charcoal fragments, a distinct ferrimagnetic signature (FIG. 9), but no ceramic fragments, unless these survive in the red inclusions. Some samples in this unit give high P and Na, but the whole unit has low organic carbon. In the Parori stream trench, within 300 m upstream of the site, is exposed up to 0.5 m of rounded predominantly limestone gravel (base not seen), overlain by a maximum of 2.6 m of light yellowish brown (dry colour: 2.5 Y 6/3) silt and greyish brown (dry colour: 2.5 Y 5/2) very fine sandy silt. The silts contain low but variable amounts of fine stones. C18 was taken in these Holocene channel-fill sediments. In contrast, in section Si, beneath the Neolithic cultural layer, is exposed 1.6 m of an aged, bedded fluvial sediment containing fine units of gravel. This is concealed by concrete reinforcement below the exposure. The chronostratigraphic relationship with sediments beneath the tell is not clear, but the sediment may be late Pleistocene.44 Sediment diagenesis Post-depositional physical and chemical change is a feature of sediments in all cores, being very pronounced in some. Colour and mineral magnetic and chemical characteristics have been much affected by hydromorphic processes in natural sediments. Stains, mottles, and nodules of iron and manganese are abundant where wet sediments have dried as a 43 P. Bullock, N. Fedoroff, A.Jongerius, G. Stoops, and T. Tursina, Handbook for Soil Thin Section Description (Wolverhampton, 1985), 79 discuss the difficulty of distinguishing between amorphous iron oxides and organic matter in thin section. 44 The redness of the matrix, the nature of iron oxide transformations and the illuviation of clay and iron (including haematite) in this sediment are very similar to features observed by the writer in Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene river deposits elsewhere in southern Europe.</page><page sequence="20">TABLE 2.

Carbonate nodules and masses (to c. 4 cm in diameter) of cemented sediment occur in both natural and anthropogenic sediments. Calcium carbonate, iron, and illuviated clay deposits in voids are a major micromorphological feature of many natural and some archaeological units, seen in the thin sections and with a hand lens. Faunal and rootlet channels, commonly much less than 1 mm in diameter, dominate the micro-fabric of many natural and anthropogenic sediment units. Many channels are lined with clay or other deposits, including iron oxides and calcium carbonate. Mixing by earthworms and snails has affected particularly the moister sediments. Moist conditions in core C I have been favourable to these organisms, effects of gastropods being observed to a depth of 2.30 m. Microstratigraphic sediment features would have been disturbed or destroyed by bioturbation, and interpretation of the geochemistry of small sediment samples must be approached with caution.</page><page sequence="25">'SPARTA BEFORE SPARTA' 73 DISCUSSION From the results of the coring and geomorphological and topsoil K surveys may be defined four landform-sediment assemblages within the area of the archaeological survey grid. These define four zones of different geomorphological history which are critical to interpreting artefact taphonomy. The zones are (1) the tell; (2) the area to the north (north- east and east); (3) the lowland to the west, south and south-east, and (4) the Holocene sediments of the Parori channel fill. Zone i: the tell The settlement of Kouphovouno was established on a low hill, the shape of which is traced today by the base of the archaeological strata. We believe this to be one of the hills in the Sparta Basin which were formed by erosion of Neogene basin-fill, probably during the Pleistocene. The results of the archaeological survey and of trial excavation indicate that Bronze Age material may have been removed from the higher part of the hill. The only plausible means of significant erosion of the tell has been anthropogenic. At times when the settlement was not occupied, and when the area was finally cleared for cultivation, artefacts, including building stone, would be scattered. One can imagine larger stones being carried off to be put to use elsewhere. Irregularities in the ground would be smoothed out by tilling, and artefacts and soil matrix worked very gradually down the less gentle slopes, particularly with use of the modern plough. Transport by rain-splash, vigorous in this region,45 and sheet-wash would occur when soil was exposed, but the slopes are too gentle (at least at the present day) for the critical energy of flow required to remove particles much coarser than the smallest stones, and the area of the hill too small for much run-off to accumulate. The modern soils developed in the archaeological materials of the hill, furthermore, are not inherently erodible, being mostly of fine loam texture. Deflation by splash and flow, however, would concentrate a residue of stones and artefacts at the surface, exposing them to displacement by people and animals. Bioturbation, evident in the topsoils, could counter the effects of deflation by burying artefacts, especially on the most gentle slopes, but is limited in dry Mediterranean soils.46 Zone 2: the land to the north (north-east and east) of the tell At S1, the prehistoric cultural layer survived until being eroded by the Parori stream. Chronologically, the archaeological unit correlates with at least part of the tell stratigraphy. We distinguish between this and zone 1, however, because of the difference between the fluvial gravels of Si and the natural sediments beneath the tell, and because the surface at Si is lower than the tell. We place C19 in this zone also because the surface here is lower than the hill, though we have not dated any sherds from this core. For the area to the north-east and east of the hill, we have no sub-surface data. The appreciable amounts of Neolithic and Bronze Age pottery found in the extensive survey of this area may have been transported from the tell (as we conclude below for prehistoric artefacts on the 45 0.

Highest values for topsoil I however, were measured in the orange grove on the east side of the hill (FIG. 6 b), and we wonder whether these reflect traces of prehistoric activities which, as in S1, have survived alluvial deposition during the mid to late Holocene. Zone 3: the lowland to the west, south, and south-east of the tell We do not know the height of the land in this zone during the Neolithic period, but it was lower than at present, having been raised possibly more than 4 m by alluvial deposition. There is evidence in our cores of significant, but as yet undated, changes in the development of the valley floor during the Holocene. In Clo (FIG. 9), in the flat area to the west of the site, only 0.55 m of sediment has accumulated above the artefact, which is dated at no younger than 400 BC and which could not have been transported with the alluvium. The culturally sterile, brown, stony clay, which lay some 4 m beneath this artefact, we interpret as topsoil. This is either developed in situ (and represents a surface which had been stable for a period possibly of centuries) or was transported from a topsoil source following erosion of catchment hillslopes. The degree of pedogenesis indicated by the mineral magnetic and geochemical characteristics of this material is consistent with soil-forming conditions in the Holocene, rather than with the cold and dry late Pleistocene environment. As for when the erosion which removed it from its source or led to its burial occurred, we can say only that it appears to have preceded c. 400 BC. It would be convenient if Holocene soil erosion in the Mediterranean had everywhere been anthropogenic and had everywhere begun following deforestation, but these situations may apply neither to the Mediterranean region as a whole47 nor, especially, to the particular conditions of the Sparta Basin and its mountain rim. Holocene geomorphological change on the valley floor has been driven largely by streams whose discharge and sediment load have been determined by climate, weather and slope stability in the Taygetos mountains,48 for which we have no data. Here, precipitation is high, slopes are steep and thresholds of stability sensitive. A single storm, a shift in weather or climate, or an increase in grazing in the mountains may tip the balance toward erosion. Capricious stream-flow in migrating channels has left a complex stratigraphy of valley-floor sediments.49 Judging from the data we have so far, and notwithstanding possible removal of valley sediments by river incision at some stage during the mid to late Holocene, it appears that most alluvial deposition in this zone occurred between c. lo,ooo-c. 24oo BP, with much reduced rate thereafter. This model is a reversal of that posited for the coarse sediments of the alluvial fans by Pope and Millington, in which relatively extensive medial and distal fan segments accumulated after the Archaic period. According to those authors' dating, an extensive area of land to the west of 47 A. T. Grove and O. Rackham, The Nature of Mediterranean Europe: An Ecological History (New Haven, 2001), 288-311. 48 A local base level for river erosion has also been significant: the mountains have risen and the basin sunk during the Neogene and Quaternary (B. Schroder and D. Kelletat, 'Geodynamical conclusions from vertical displacement of Quaternary shorelines in the Peloponnesus, Greece', NeuesJahrbuch fir Geologie und Palaiontologie, 3 (1976), 174-86). Furthermore, the present outlet of the River Eurotas at the southern end of the Sparta Basin is a narrow limestone gorge. This may be of no great age, and could be blocked by river sediments resulting in the flooding of the basin. When the gorge was cut, base level of erosion by the Eurotas river system was lowered. 49 In the southern Argolid it was noted that alluvial deposits vary almost as much within a single unit as between units of different ages; M. H. Jameson, C. N. Runnels, and T. H. van Andel, A Greek Countryside: The Southern Argolid from Prehistory to the Present Day (Stanford, 1994), 174.</page><page sequence="27">'SPARTA BEFORE SPARTA' 75 Kouphovouno has been buried since the Classical period by extension of the alluvial fans, the distal segments of which are 4 to 8 m thick. Our own observation of the distal slope of the Parori fan to the west of Kouphovouono indicates that it has been little altered since before Roman times. The magnetically distinct unit between 2.00 and 3.88 m in C9, with charcoal fragments and red inclusions, is intriguing (FIG. 9). It lacks the higher organic carbon of topsoil material. It could be mud-brick, and the magnetic properties the effect of burning, though the earth has a more reddish hue (7.5 YR) only between 3.00 and 3.20 m. The burnt molar of an animal lay at the base of this layer, at 3.88 m. There is some evidence of anthropogenic influence here, reaching down to 4 m, but one that disappears somewhere between C9 and Clo. The core stratigraphy and what little we can infer about dates indicate that the Neolithic artefacts mapped in the depression to the west of the tell in FIG. 14 are not in situ: they have been transported by some means at a time much later than the Neolithic. Immediately to the south of the hill, in core C5, beneath a sharp magnetic threshold at 2.30 m, there is no indication of significant change in sediment source or of a phase of stability. To the east, Ci1 yielded several minor 'soft' magnetic peaks in the natural sediments, and there are significant fluctuations in organic carbon, not all correlating with the magnetic data, and some relating to modern organic matter. The variations down this core may reflect shifts in sediment source or changes in the balance between rates of deposition and pedogenetic/diagenetic alteration during the Holocene. Zone 4: Holocene fill of the Parori channel Between C19 and C1 8 is the limit of the Parori stream channel fill. At some stage, and possibly as late as the Middle Ages,5o the stream incised a trench, which it has filled and cut again. How much of the prehistoric site was lost, we cannot say. CONCLUSIONS The coring was not without problems, but it has been invaluable in throwing light on nearly all the questions we wished to address in the environmental survey. The exception is the history of vegetation change, about which we have found almost no direct (pollen or other fossil) evidence. We have insufficient information to reconstruct the vegetation and soils of the early Holocene Sparta Basin, the archaeobotanical evidence from the excavation of Kouphovouno during the next few years being our most promising prospect for data on local vegetation during prehistoric times. Where well drained, lowland Laconia would surely have favoured woodland, the extension of which could have been rapid at the close of the Pleistocene if a number of tree taxa survived the last Glacial in the mountains, as they had done in the Balkans.51' Van Zeist and Bottema considered that forest extended throughout the Peloponnese in the early Holocene.5= There is no clear indication in the cores of palustrine conditions around Kouphovouno, but the 50 Pope and Millington 2002 (n. 30). 51 K.

CAVANAGH, C. MEE, J. RENARD hydromorphic features in the sediments reflect a fall in water table resulting from incision by the River Eurotas and the Parori stream, if not also a drier climate. The sediments are proof that the lowland was prone to flooding: the hill of Kouphovouno was not only drier than the land around, it was above the threat of floods.5o The relief of the site and its periphery is subdued, and soils vary little in colour and texture at the surface. The sediment stratigraphy, however, presents a picture of spatial variability which defies correlation between our cores. Furthermore, the Neolithic artefacts on the surface of the depression to the west of the hill show how well preserved artefacts on an off-site surface may be neither spatially nor stratigraphically in situ. Two outstanding impressions from the survey of the landforms, sediments, and soils of Kouphovouno are how unique and how complex are the site and its relationship with its natural setting. We find complexity at all scales, from the broad context of the basin and its mountain surround to the microscopic. It is a complexity resulting in part from the high energy of physical processes in a mountain region of Mediterranean climate, and in part from nearly 8ooo years of quite intensive human activity. ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY SURVEY METHODOLOGY A grid measuring 250 x 250 m was laid out stretching from the Parori river bed, which forms the site's boundary to the north, and centred on the summit of the tell (FIG. 7). Thus the total area to be covered was just over 6 ha, though an area of 0.48 ha in the south- west and 0.9 ha in the north-west could not be treated because of very intensive agriculture. Given the size of the site and the quality and quantity of the material recovered, two methods were devised for artefact collection, a more intensive treatment in the centre, and extensive sampling on the periphery. The whole grid was divided into squares of 5 x 5 m, and each square was numbered consecutively along every row, thus squares 1-50 formed the southernmost row and squares 2451-2500 the northernmost row. A few squares just beyond the northern limit, close to the Parori (2522-8) were also treated. The orientation of the grid was decided by the lie of the land and is slightly off grid north (approximately -170). An arbitrary origin was established looo m west and looo m south of the sampling grid, and each square was located by its south-west corner (so square 801 is looo E, lo80 N). The intensive sampling was carried out in 592 squares measuring 5 x 5 m. Field workers were instructed to collect every artefact they could see within each square. Of course visibility was a significant factor. In particular some of the squares were covered with thick tall grasses which made it very difficult to see the ground surface. Here the collectors were supplied with gloves and sickles and encouraged to cut or brush aside the undergrowth. An estimate of the vegetation cover was recorded, and a count made of stones, of cobble size or larger, observed in the first square metre in the south-west corner of each unit, as this might reflect destroyed walls or building activity. The identity of the collectors, general comments on the sampling, an initial record of chipped and ground 59 According to legend, King Eurotas drained the Sparta plain (Pausanias iii. 1. 1), though it is not clear when this impressive feat is supposed to have been undertaken. No early Holocene lake sediments, however, have been reported from the basin, nor did we encounter any in our reconnaissance survey.</page><page sequence="29">'SPARTA BEFORE SPARTA' 77 stone artefacts and other finds, and observations of characteristics such as burnt mud- brick were also noted on the record sheets. The artefacts were then sent to be processed. Extensive sampling proceeded within units measuring 20 m x 5 m, that is by combining four adjacent squares (though at the western end of the site three blocks measuring 20 m x 20 m were sampled as single units, and a row of six blocks measured to m x 5 m). In this case the team of samplers would sweep, 2 m apart, across the unit, again attempting to recover every artefact that could be seen, but here no attempt was made to cope with very dense vegetation cover. No record was made of stone, but otherwise the treatment proceeded as with the intensive squares. 214 units were recorded in this way. The feature sherds from each square-rims, handles, bases, and body sherds with painted decoration or some other form of surface treatment-were marked and individually registered. The details recorded were as follows: type of sherd, open or closed, shape, fabric, decoration, treatment, width, or diameter in the case of handles, ware, and period. The 7,555 sherds that were registered represent 14%/0 of the total collected. Given the range of periods on the site, a high proportion of these sherds could not be dated, even provisionally. Nevertheless, it has been possible to produce distribution plots for each period and the character of the pottery is certainly clear. DATA PLOTS The density of vegetation cover, plotted on a notional scale of o-l oo%/0 is indicated in FIG. io. In spite of our best efforts some surface artefacts will have been missed, though visibility seems to have affected pottery collection less than it did the collection of chipped stone (see below). In producing plots of the finds from different periods we have used diagnostic pottery. 41% of the registered sherds could be dated to one period or another, in certain cases with some precision, and usually at least to a broad phase (Neolithic, Early Bronze Age). Some sherds, however, fell into categories that spanned our broad phases, for example FN-EH I, or Hellenistic-Roman. In order to deal with uncertainties of this sort, a scoring or weighting system was applied. Sherds we believed to date to one phase were weighted 1.o, those dated either to one phase or to another were weighted 0.5 for each phase. In other cases we identified a sherd as belonging to one or other phase with a reasonable probability (the period on the database was recorded within brackets, to indicate a degree of uncertainty). These sherds have been weighted 0.25, or, if falling between two broad phases, 0.125. Thus the distribution maps show the sum, for each sampling square, of the weighted score for each sherd dated to the given period. GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY AND RESULTS BY N. BRODIE Magnetic gradient was measured using a Geoscan FM36 Fluxgate gradiometer at a resolution of 1 nT. Readings were taken at 1 m intervals along south-north parallel traverses in a series of 20o x 20 m grids. A total of 40 grids were surveyed, laid out as shown in FIG. 11. The data were processed using the following software packages: Geoplot Version 1.20o, MapInfo 5.5, and Vertical Mapper 2.5.54 54 I should like to thank Michael Boyd for help with the final plots.

The south-west area of the site generally shows little variation in magnetic intensity, but variation increases in the region of the central mound, which presumably covers the Neolithic-Bronze Age remains. In the eastern and northern parts of the site there were a large number of vertical iron rods in place supporting young olive trees or irrigation sprinklers at the base of larger trees. These rods are marked on FIG. 1 1 as black crosses. There are what appear to be four main positive anomalies, or at least areas of marked variation in magnetic gradient. They are marked on FIG. 12 as features A, B, C, and D. Anomaly C (maximum 217 nT) is in an area of high surface tile concentration where a Roman structure was subsequently revealed during a test excavation in 2002. The locations of A (maximum 40 nT), B (maximumlg37 nT) and, to a lesser extent, D (maximum 57 nT) are marked by high surface concentrations of Neolithic pottery (FIG. 14). Pieces of what appeared to be baked clay daub were picked up during surface collection in the areas of A and B, and in 2001-2 excavation at A (= excavation Area C) uncovered the remains of a burnt Neolithic house. In view of these findings, it seems reasonable to suggest that anomalies B and D also mark the positions of burnt structures of Neolithic date.

It was thought that in many cases areas of high magnetic gradient, anything up to 5 m across, were due to burnt material confined within a mudbrick-walled space. Sometimes this was confirmed by the exposure of a dark, ashy deposit.55 However, the high visibility of the postulated burnt areas at Kouphovouno should not be taken to indicate an absence of archaeology in other parts of the mound area, which may simply have escaped fire.

Once the pottery from each square had been washed, it was divided into fine and coarse categories. This distinction was not made on the basis of the fabric but the thickness of each sherd. Those up to 8 mm thick were classified as fine and those over 8 mm as coarse. It was analysis of the pottery from the Laconia Rural Sites Project which suggested that the figure of 8 mm could be used to separate table wares from storage and cooking vessels. Of course this is not a particularly precise method of classification but we found that it gave an impression of the functional characteristics of the pottery from the sites surveyed. In the case of Kouphovouno, the intention was again to determine whether there was evidence of functional variation across the site. In FIG. 13 we have plotted the proportion of fine pottery in each square as a percentage of the total number of sherds. The weight of the fine and coarse pottery has also been recorded but, for comparative purposes, this is not as helpful since large sherds produce</page><page sequence="33">'SPARTA BEFORE SPARTA' 81 extreme values and consequently less reliable comparisons. The distribution map does show spatial distinctions, with coarser pottery more common in the south-east sector of the intensively surveyed area, and even more markedly predominant on the east side of the extensively surveyed part of the site. In the central and western parts of the site fine wares were more common. This distribution seems unconnected with visibility during the survey. Potentially at least, the relative proportion of fine and coarse sherds in each square could have chronological implications. As Perlas and Vitelli have pointed out,56 fine ware vessels dominate the MN deposits at Franchthi and the trial excavations have indicated that this is true of Kouphovouno as well. It is not until the FN period that the production of coarse wares increases significantly. The distribution of the MN pottery does indeed coincide quite well with the areas where fine wares predominate in the centre and north, though MN is not so well represented in the south-west part of the intensively surveyed area. The LN/FN sherds, on the other hand, coincide more with the south-east sector where, as mentioned above, coarser pottery predominated.

RENARD Alternatively, we could consider whether the size of sherds is an indicator of date, since it seems inherently likely that the earliest pottery found on the surface would be the most abraded. In 93 squares the average sherd weight is less than 5 g but 65 of these squares are at the northern end of the site where there has been such intensive cultivation that most of the pottery is completely undiagnostic and cannot be reliably dated. Again this is a plausible hypothesis which cannot be proved. NEOLITHIC The distribution of Neolithic pottery across the site is plotted in FIG. 14. It is concentrated in the centre, that is the highest section of the site, but spreads in every direction. There may have been some downslope movement of sherds as a result of erosion or cultivation. Equally it could be argued that these processes would have buried Neolithic levels away from the centre of the site, with the result that they have been less disturbed and consequently form only a minor component of the surface artefacts. There must also be Neolithic pottery in some of the squares in the market garden and the orange grove. If so, the size of the site at this time will have been around 4 ha. The pottery is discussed by period. Middle Neolithic No EN pottery has been identified, either from the survey or the excavations.7 It therefore seems likely that the site was first occupied in the MN period, although the earliest cultural horizons have not been tested yet. Most of the MN pottery (FIGS. 15-18) from Kouphovouno consists of jars and bowls, which can be difficult to differentiate if it is not possible to measure the rim diameter or the angle of the profile is uncertain. Phelps58 defines jars as 'closed vessels with some sort of distinct collar, neck or offset rim'. At Franchthi bowls have a rim diameter which is approximately the same as the maximum diameter of the vessel, whereas in the case of jars it is less.59 The collar-necked jar is one of the more distinctive MN shapes,6o with a low (&lt;25 mm: FIG. 15. 1-5), medium (25-50 mm: FIG. 15. 6-8) or high (&gt; 50 mm: FIG. 15. 9) inturned or vertical rim. Some of the bowls with everted rims (FIG. 15. 10-14) could also be classified as collar-necked jars. Piriform jars, which characteristically have an S-shaped profile, vary in size and presumably function, since the rims may be closed or open (FIG. 16. 1-2). The bowls with flaring rims6' (FIG. 16. 3-6) were evidently quite deep and sometimes carinated (FIG. 16. 7-8). The plain rim bowls (FIG. 16. 9-13) tend to be comparatively shallow. Many, if not most, of these bowls must have been set on the numerous pedestal bases (FIG. 17. 1-4). There were also MN ring and some flat bases (FIG. 17. 5-7). A number of bowls have conical spur lugs (FIG. 17. 8-1 o) placed on or just below the rim. On the basis of their fabric and finish, Phelps believes that some of the Kouphovouno examples should be Late Phase.6' As Renard has noted, tubular lugs (FIG. 17. 11-16) were also quite common in this period, more so than at other sites in the Peloponnese.63 57' Renard 1989, 97. 58 Phelps 1975, 65. 59 Vitelli 1993, 99. 6o Phelps 1975, 144-6. 61 Note that Phelps 1975, 141 uses the term flaring for rims that we describe as everted. 62 Phelps 1975, 157. 65 Renard 1989, 114.</page><page sequence="35">'SPARTA BEFORE SPARTA' 83 MARKET GARDEJ U 6RANGE GPO&gt;VE 50 0 50 100 150 200 260 Meters Neolithic Pottery . 0.25 - 1.5 * 1.6 - 3.5 * 3.5 - 7 . 7 11.25 e 11.25-23.375 Road Parori river 0.Sm contours Intensive survey Extensive survey N FIG. 14.

Much of the MN pottery had evidently been painted but Urfirnis decoration is of course characteristic of EH II as well and it was not always possible to date monochrome sherds. Fortunately, patterned Urfirnis decoration is rare in the EH period. The fabric of 74%/0 of the MN Urfirnis from Kouphovouno, monochrome and decorated, is fine and that of 26%/0 is medium. There were only a few coarse sherds. The paint is typically black or dark brown, less often red, and can be lustrous or matt. The patterned decoration-on collar-necked jars, piriform jars and bowls-usually consists of chevrons composed of diagonal lines, sometimes framed by a wider band (FIG. 18. 1-4). Other motifs include cross-hatched panels (FIG. 18. 5) and simple linear bands (FIG. 18. 6). Another standard form of decoration on the Urfirnis sherds is scribble burnish, randomly burnished lines which fire a darker colour, often black on brown but also shades of red (FIG. 1i8. 7-12). At Franchthi scribble burnish first appears in the second MN phase and becomes as common as monochrome Urfirnis in the fifth and final phase.64 This suggests that the pottery from the survey, as well as from the excavation,65 is mainly Middle and Late Phase. 64 Vitelli 1993, 139. 65 Phelps 1975, 48; Renard 1989, 98.</page><page sequence="36">84 W.

CAVANAGH, C. MEE, J. RENARD Late Neolithic At Franchthi there may have been a short hiatus in the occupation of the cave between phases 2 and 3, the Middle and Late Neolithic.66 Despite some continuity in pottery production, significant differences can also be seen. In particular it would appear that Urfirnis was not used as a decorative technique in the LN period-Urfirnis sherds in phase 3 contexts should be residual.67 Elsewhere, it has been argued that Urfirnis did continue, for instance at Corinth.68 In the Kouveleiki cave at Alepochori in Laconia the earliest level is LN but there were Urfirnis sherds.69 Consequently some of the Urfirnis from Kouphovouno could well be LN.7o Black burnished pottery is characteristic of the LN period, although Vitelli notes sherds decorated in this technique from MN contexts at Franchthi,71 and in the FN period plain burnished pottery which had fired black.72 However, Zachos reports relatively few black burnished sherds in period I at Ayios Dimitrios,7J which is FN. Clearly caution is necessary but a LN date at least for the finer black burnished sherds from Kouphovouno seems likely. Phelps in fact prefers the term Black Ware, since the surface treatment does vary.74 Some of our sherds had certainly been burnished but others were so worn that we could not be certain. There is also Grey Ware, which is not as consistently fired and therefore less distinctive,75 but no Matt-Painted or Polychrome pottery. This is curious because Matt-Painted is found in Laconia at Alepochori76 and Alepotrypa (on display in Diros Museum), as well as some Polychrome. A white slip is often used on the Matt-Painted at Alepotrypa77 and it is possible that white-slipped sherds from Kouphovouno, such as FIG. 19. 1 were once painted. Nevertheless, this is a period when there was much more variation in pottery styles78 and we should expect different local preferences.79 The LN pottery (FIGS. 19-20) from the survey includes jars, some of which had handles set on or just below the rim (FIG. 19. 2-8). Characteristic of this period is the shoulder bowl with an offset, rounded or bead lip (FIG. 19. 9-15), 'a shape unique to FCP 3',80 the earlier of the two LN phases at Franchthi. The oval lug on the shoulder of some of these bowls seems more decorative than functional. There is a similar lug on an open bowl (FIG. 19. 16). Carinated bowls sometimes thicken at the shoulder (FIG. 20. 1).81 The bowls with flaring or plain rims can be quite shallow in this period (FIG. 20. 2-6) and had conical or convex pedestal bases (FIG. 20. 7-8). Of particular interest is a black burnished rhyton leg decorated with incised crosses (FIG. 20. 9), a feature of phase 4 at Franchthi.8' Neolithic pedestal bases include FIG. 20. 10o-11. 66 Vitelli 1999, 35. 67 Ibid., 1999, 61. 68 J.

Many of the vessels had been fired for only a short period of time and must have been extremely friable.84 Once in the topsoil, sherds soon disintegrate. However, the fabric is quite distinctive and consequently diagnostic. The surface colour varies but is usually dark and traces of burnish can often be seen. There is similar pottery from the earliest of the Laconia Survey sites.85 Shapes include jars (FIG. 21. 1-2) and bowls (FIG. 21. 3-7) with ledge lugs (FIG. 21. 8-10) and raised or flat bases (FIG. 21. 11-12). One bowl has holes pierced around the rim (FIG. 21. 13). It is difficult to know whether these cheese pots really were used to strain milk but they have also been found at Alepotrypa (on display in Diros Museum). There were plastic cordons on a number of sherds with incised (FIG. 21. 14) or impressed (FIG. 21. 15) decoration. No pattern burnish has been identified or crusted ware."86 Vitelli wonders whether FN pottery was made for special, presumably ceremonial, occasions.87 The lack of durability would not have been a major concern if pottery was only used for a short period of time and then discarded. She suspects that skill levels declined as a consequence. It is certainly true that the explanation for this phenomenon must take account of the transformation in the social landscape at this time. EARLY HELLADIC The Neolithic and Early Helladic sherd distributions correspond quite closely (compare FIGS. 14 and 22). The Early Helladic is similar in extent but less dense, though the frequency of the pottery types is in part a reflection of how recognizable they are in surface assemblages: for example fragments of Neolithic pedestalled bowls are particularly durable and therefore diagnostic. Judging from the pottery the site covered approximately the same extent as in the Neolithic period. As Cavanagh and Crouwel have observed,88 EH I pottery in central Laconia is not particularly distinctive. At Kouphovouno a number of sherds have traces of red-slipped decoration (FIG. 23. 1-3) and should be EH 1.89 Shallow bowls with everted or flaring rims (FIG. 23. 4-9) recall two of the Talioti Hauptformen,90 although none of our examples has incised decoration. Nevertheless, a late EH I date seems likely. Also characteristic of the Talioti phase,9' and certainly common at Kouphovouno,92 are bases with mat impressions (FIG. 23. 10-12). EH II is well represented by classic fine ware shapes. A number of rim sherds come from sauceboats (FIG. 24. 1-7). Shallow bowls with incurving rims were a particular favourite (FIG. 24. 8-24). Like the sauceboats, these bowls had conical or raised bases 83 Perlks and Vitelli (n. 56), 99. 84 Vitelli 1999, 64. 85 W. G. Cavanagh, 'The Neolithic pottery', in Cavanagh and Crouwel 1996, 1-3. 86 See Zachos (n. 73), 51-3 for the distribution of Attic- Kephala style pattern burnish in the southern Peloponnese.

There is Urfirnis decoration on some of the sherds but often only traces and it is clear that a much higher proportion of the EH II pottery had once been painted. A series of larger bowls and basins with rounded and flattened rims could be EH I or EH II (FIG. 26. 1-1 i). Coarse ware vessels include large jars (FIG. 27. 1-3), pithoi (FIG. 27. 4-9) and a possible frying pan or hearth rim (FIG. 28. 1). A tile (FIG. 28. 2), for which an EH date seems likely, given the fabric and Urfirnis decoration, hints that there may have been sophisticated architecture. Some of the EH pottery has plain, impressed (FIG. 28. 3- 5) or incised (FIG. 28. 6) cordons. Occasionally incision is used on jar rims (FIG. 28. 7-8), on askos handles and other types of handle (FIG. 28. 9-12), and on sherds (FIG. 28. 13). The lack of EH III pottery at Kouphovouno has already been noted9es and this remains the case. It is a phase which proved equally elusive on the prehistoric sites examined in the Laconia Survey,94 although possible EH III sherds have recently been identified at Skoura, further south.95 While it is possible that few sites in central Laconia were still occupied, the true character of the EH-MH transition will only become clear when the pottery sequence in this region is better known. 93 Ibid., 127. 94 Cavanagh and Crouwel 1996, 16. 95 E.

The explanation may be that the later levels on the top of the mound have been disturbed or destroyed. This makes it difficult to calculate the size of the settlement but it must still have covered several hectares. The distribution extends more to the east than was the case in the Neolithic or Early Bronze Age. The thin but dispersed distribution, with scattered hotspots might indicate a more open pattern of settlement.

CAVANAGH, C. MEE, J. RENARD Middle Helladic The Middle Helladic pottery consists of approximately t oo sherds, compared with over 700 Early Helladic and almost 300 Late Helladic. Since relatively few coarse ware sherds could be dated to this period, these figures must be viewed with caution but they do imply a more restricted level of activity, to use a relatively neutral expression. The Middle Helladic pottery in Laconia is idiosyncratic but has links with the Argolid.96 At Kouphovouno there is Argive Minyan, dark burnished with a reddish core, as well as a few sherds which have matt-painted decoration. Fine stemmed goblets (FIG. 30. 1) must be late, MH III or even LH I. Coarse shapes include jars (FIG. 30. 2-5) and pithoi (FIG. 30. 6). Late Helladic Several sherds have a white slip and should be LH I-II (FIG. 30. 7-8). Similar pottery has been found on the Laconia Survey97 and also at Ayios Stephanos where it is seen as evidence of Minoan influence via Kastri on Kythera.98 There are Early Mycenaean goblets (FIG. 30. 9) and a sherd (FIG. 30. 1o), possibly from a piriform jar, decorated with curved stripes is LH II A. Although kylix sherds do tend to be disproportionately conspicuous, this was certainly the most common shape in LH III (FIG. 30. 11-17). Kraters, deep bowls (FIG. 30. 18) and basins (FIG. 30. 19-21) complete the range. Much of the pottery is LH III A-B; whether the site was still occupied in LH III C is less clear. ARCHAIC-ROMAN Archaeologically much of the Laconian countryside is a complete blank between the twelfth and sixth centuries99 and this is also true of Kouphovouno, despite the proximity of Sparta and Amyklai. For the late Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods, the number of sherds is thin, not more than two per unit, but widespread (FIG. 31). The density of 29 sherds per hectare is not incompatible with background scatter due to manuring, but excavation has now produced what seems to be residual Classical pottery in a Roman context. Most of the Archaic-Hellenistic pottery is black-glazed but cannot be more closely dated. Identifiable shapes include an Archaic cup (FIG. 32. 1), Classical skyphoi, a Hellenistic dish (FIG. 32. 2), and pithoi (FIG. 32. 3-4). One sherd (FIG. 32. 5) has grooved decoration. There is less Roman pottery (FIG. 33), but in this case there was a marked concentration on the west side of the site, which also contained a high proportion of the tile (FIG. 34). In the event excavation has confirmed occupation here in the Roman period, underlining the point that even a handful of Roman sherds can signal a site. The high concentration of tile in the western sector argues for structures spread over an area of some 0.4 ha. As is often the case in this period, the pottery consists mainly of closed shapes, in particular 96 Cavanagh and Crouwel g1996, 17, 25-6. 97 Ibid., 18. 98 J. B. Rutter and S.

Counts of sherds dated to the Roman period. Of the material, 66%/0 was made of obsidian and 34%/0 of flint or chert of variable quality and colour. The obsidian products derive from all phases of dibitage. No nodule of raw material was found, but there are numerous products from the decortication phase with cortex, and also products from the preparation of the nucleus for the dibitage (preparation flakes, crested blades: FIG. 36. 2). There are a number of prismatic blades (FIG. 36. i and 6), products from core rejuvenation (flakes or tablets produced during the rejuvenation of the striking platform or the core surface: FIG. 36. 3), cores abandoned once they had been fully used (FIG. 36. 4), as well as much debris. The following types of tools were found: retouched blades (FIG. 36. 6), arrowheads (FIG. 36. 12-14) and pisces esquillies The various forms of flint/chert (light grey, dark grey, honey, white, brown) and chocolate coloured jasper, are represented by numerous flakes, blades (FIG. 36. 7-10), debris or even cores. Certain materials are present only in isolated examples, whereas others, such as the chocolate jasper, are represented in products from various phases of dibitage. In the majority of cases the work is meticulous (carefully worked tools, but also ddbitage indicating skilled production), especially in the case of raw materials of high quality (chocolate jasper,</page><page sequence="58">io6 W.

Further study of the material will allow a more precise dating and lead to a more detailed technological study. POLISHED STONE BY J. RENARD AND F. FROEHLICH The study of the polished stone artefacts recovered in the course of the surface survey was linked to an investigation into the provenance of the raw materials. Thus, in parallel with the typological and technological study of the artefacts recovered, two campaigns were carried out in April 2000 and 2ooi to explore the local geology, in order to locate possible sources of the raw materials for the Neolithic and Bronze Age at Kouphovouno.</page><page sequence="59">'SPARTA BEFORE SPARTA' 107 MARKET GARDEN- ORANGE GROVE 50 0 50 100 150 200 250 Meters Chipped stone count 1 * 1-2 * 2-3 * 3-5 e 5-7 Road Parori river \0.5m contours Intensive survey Extensive survey N FIG. 35. Distribution of chipped stone artefacts from the surveyed areas. POLISHED STONE ARTEFACTS One hundred and forty-seven polished stone artefacts were recovered. Those whose function can be identified are catalogued in TABLE 3. The tools and implements can be subdivided into a number of broad functional categories: objects for grinding, pounding, and crushing, tools for hammering or percussion, tools for slicing or cutting, and finally those for polishing or sharpening. It is not possible to give precise dates to these finds, in the absence of a reference collection founded on stratified material, but one can, nevertheless, make certain observations on their typology and technology, in spite of the damage they have suffered in the plough soil. Implements for grinding and milling Fourteen querns were identified, of which two were complete. Complete or fragmentary, they all have a lower surface, which is slightly convex and pitted, and a concave upper surface, with marks of polishing, often transversal, probably as a result of use. The two</page><page sequence="60">o108 W. CAVANAGH, C. MEE, J.

Some of the implements, however, seem smaller, and not all would have served the same function: grinding cereals, preparing pigments, grating plant matter, not to mention serving as polishers or whetstones to sharpen the cutting-edges of axes or adzes. Rubbers and pounders Rubbers and pounders are more difficult to identify. A certain number of artefacts, oblong in shape and oval(K733.Si) or plano-convex (KiI19.Si) in section, had probably been used to produce a powder by working them backwards and forwards. Others, shaped like flattened pebbles (Klo67.Sx), could have had the same use, or might have been utilized to grind or mill in an irregular motion. Another artefact, in chlorite-schist and tronco- conical in form (K617.Si), could be a pestle. Hammers Thirty percussive or hammering tools were collected, 23 of them complete (FIG. 37. 2-5). More or less oblong in shape with an oval section, they have working surfaces at either end, which are curved and pock-marked by use. Their sides are usually polished. Their length varies from 4-10 cm, with the majority (11) 5-7 cm. Axes and adzes Axes have, by definition, a symmetrical profile and are mounted parallel to the blade. Thirty-seven axes were collected, thirteen of them complete, plus four distal fragments, which show that the edges are always curved and the sections oval or elliptical. Some have flattened sides. Those artefacts with a length greater than 8 cm usually have narrow butts (FIG. 38. 1-2), whilst the shorter have wide butts (FIG. 38. 3). None is longer than to cm. Evidently the axes and small axes did not have the same function, the smallest measured just 2.8 cm (FIG. 38. 4). The adzes have an asymmetric profile and are intended to be mounted with the haft at right angles to the blade. Twenty-three adzes were identified, thirteen of them complete (FIG. 38. 5-8). Only one is greater than 8 cm in length. The butts are usually broad (9 x 13 cm), which lends the objects an almost trapezoidal shape, with an ellipsoidal or lens- shaped section. The blades are curved. FIG. 36 (left).

An oblong, fragmentary artefact (K1o22.S1) has a groove on one of its faces parallel with the long axis. It is probably a polisher for the manufacture or rejuvenation of tools, weapons, or implements in wood, bone, or stone. Some long oblong objects might have been used as polishers during potting (FIG. 38. 9). The polished stone tools from the surface collection of 1999 are comparable typologically with the tools recovered by von Vacano. Furthermore, parallels can be found at other sites in the Peloponnese. As for the raw materials, the types of rock mentioned in the publication of the earlier excavations at Kouphovouno are present: in addition to limestone and schist, which are easy to recognize, rocks such as metamorphosed basalt, porphyry, epidote, quartzite, amphibolite, and haematite are found. Mineralogical analysis, already carried out on the survey material and proposed for the finds from the excavations, will identify each rock type. As for traces of ddbitage, nothing in the material recovered indicates whether the artefacts were made at the site or whether they were brought there as finished tools. The fragmentary examples are probably the result of accidents caused by ploughing. All the same, it appears that the raw materials were exploited relatively carefully, as certain tools seem to have been used successively for different purposes, for example an axe/adze reused as a hammer, pestle, or rod. Identification of the materials worked would require either microwear or residue analysis, which, in view of the disturbed character of surface material, has not been undertaken. SOURCE OF THE RAW MATERIALS An initial examination of the polished stone artefacts, by eye and with the aid of a lens, was carried out at the 5th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities in Sparta. The poor surface preservation of the majority of the artefacts ruled out certain identification of the lithology. One could affirm, at this stage, that the great majority of polished stone axes and adzes were made of greenstone. Many of these objects have a characteristic pure green colour, probably due to the preponderance of a clay mineral of the chlorite group. Thus these are homogeneous rocks, with few mineral inclusions distinguishable at the level of magnification achievable with a hand lens. Consequently we can conclude that the majority of the tools were made of greenstone, with more or less chlorite, probably rocks of volcanic origin (basalts) that have been metamorphosed. Geological prospection was aimed at investigating outcrops of greenstones on the basis of the Geological Map of the Peloponnese.100 Six distinct zones were examined in the region of Kouphovouno, as follows: 100 Institute for Geological and Mineral Exploration, Geological Map of Greece: Sparti Sheet, z:5o,ooo (Athens, 1999).

As the Taygetos massif is essentially of limestone derivation, it is not surprising that investigation of the river bed yielded no greenstone pebbles, or any hard stone: the rocks in the Parori are exclusively metamorphosed limestone. For the same reasons, the fans which, in the vicinity, rest on the flanks of Taygetos, only produce blocks of limestone. Of necessity, the raw materials derived from further away. Taygetos Massif: three distinct zones The road from Sparta to Kalamata follows the narrow gorges scoured out by the Langada (whose course runs parallel with that of the Parori). This offers a complete geological section of the catchment drained by the river. Up to 1 ooo m this shows a thick series of crystalline limestones, metamorphic, in places dolomitic, Plattenkalk, dating from the Triassic to the Cretaceous, which sometimes include nodules of powdery silica. This limestone series rests on a detrital bed of hard rocks (quartzites, schists, flysch) of Permo-Triassic date. The interface between the two series is found, at the heart of Taygetos, at around 100ooo m. It is probably for this reason that there are no pebbles of quartzite in the Parori river-bed. On the Xerokambi sheet of the Geological Map,101 rare, small outcrops of basaltic rocks metamorphosed to greenstones (amphibolites) are marked within this series, at an altitude of about 1500 m. Samples have been collected and analysed. To the south of Sparta, on the foothills of Taygetos, there are some outcrops of greenstones (amphibolites). To the west of Taygetos, on the Kalamata sheet, there is an important series of jasper formations, which could furnish the raw materials for chipped stone tools. Parnon Massif To the south-east of Sparta, Parnon displays some fine outcrops of greenstones (chloritoschists and amphibolites) at the heart of a thick flysch series. Note also the occurrence of jasper at the centre of a series of radiolarites. Kollines Massif The schist massif of Kollines closes the plain of Sparta to the north. In spite of indications on the Geological Map, the quartz-schist series of this massif has no outcrops of metamorphic volcanic rocks. Further north still, en route to Tripolis, there is a thick series of marbles, which, however, does not include rocks capable of producing the raw materials for polished stone artefacts.

CAVANAGH, C. MEE, J. RENARD LABORATORY ANALYSES Aims and methods The aim of the laboratory analyses was to establish the mineralogical composition of the raw material used to make the tools, as well as that of the rock samples located in the course of the geological prospecting, which might correspond to these raw materials. (Ultimately, it is hoped that simple visual inspection of the artefacts themselves will allow us to identify the rock source.) With the permission of the Greek Ministry of Culture, samples were taken from twenty fragmentary artefacts, which were considered to be representative of the polished tool assemblage. The permit allowed the extraction of cores 6 mm in diameter from each object, too small for the preparation of thin sections. Artefacts and samples of rock were initially examined by eye, while the very fine laminations in the rocks were studied under a polarizing microscope. Infrared analysis by transmission using KBr discs was then undertaken on both sets of samples. For this technique only about too mg (1-2 mg minimum) is required but the preparation time is relatively long (two hours on average) because the sample needs to be finely ground (grain size of the order 2 otm) before being mixed in a precise concentration with potassium bromide. The mixture is then compressed at high pressure into a transparent disk. In good analytical conditions, analysis by transmission in a KBr matrix gives the quantified mineralogical composition of a rock (each constituent mineral being assessed separately as a percentage of the whole rock), which can serve to fingerprint the given rock. For groups of rocks whose composition can vary considerably, the quantitative aspect of the characterization is particularly important. The rocks To simplify matters only the most relevant analyses are given in TABLE 4. The rocks collected on the basis of indications on the geological map (metamorphic basalts) are in fact very diverse and vary from schists and quartzites (metamorphic sandstones), to amphibolites (metamorphic volcanic rocks), themselves very varied from the mineralogical point of view. Not one of these rocks has an identical infrared spectrum: the quantitative infrared analysis here discriminates particularly well. Simple inspection of the spectra, even without interpreting them in terms of their mineralogy, can characterize a rock precisely: two identical rocks will present two infrared spectra which can be overlaid. The artefacts TABLE 5 presents the results of inspection and infrared analysis on the eleven artefacts that could be analysed. Because of the constraints on sampling, thin sections could not be made and, consequently, petrographic analyses were not carried out. The determination of the raw material has been carried out solely on the basis of the infrared spectrum. The majority of the tools analysed were made of green, chloritoid schists. The green colour of the chlorite (silicate of a group of clays) gives the whole rock its general hue. These are ancient sedimentary rocks, argillaceous quartzites that have been metamorphosed; one example is slightly calcareous. Two of the tools are of sandstone (or</page><page sequence="73">'SPARTA BEFORE SPARTA' 121 TABLE 4. Raw material of the rock samples.

CAVANAGH, C. MEE, J. RENARD Conclusions Unexpectedly, none of the tools analysed matched the outcrops of green amphibolite found on Taygetos. The only possible sources in the vicinity are the chlorite schists, outcrops of which were located after the initial geological prospecting had been carried out. However, comparison of the infrared spectra for chlorite schists from these deposits with the corresponding tools does not support the hypothesis that they were the source for the raw materials either. Further geological prospection is required, therefore, to locate green chlorite schists. Comparison of the infrared spectra should eventually allow identification of the sources, which have not so far been found in the Sparta area. At least one of the objects analysed must be an import from further afield (K2 127.S1): the pure haematite of which this axe is made, does not exist in this part of the Peloponnese. The axe Kg83.S1, strangely made of marble (metamorphic limestone), is perhaps the only polished stone artefact made of local material, possibly a stone collected from the Parori. As it was not anticipated that polished stone tools made of limestone would be found, analysis of the metamorphic limestones found in the Parori catchment was not carried out. Finally, it must be remembered that many complete tools and artefacts could not be analysed, and the results presented here are, of necessity, circumscribed. A full treatment in the future would include a mineralogical study of all the material coming from the excavations. SMALL FINDS In addition to the pottery and the chipped and ground stone, 33 other objects were collected and registered. As the supervisors were urged to err on the safe side, a number of these were later rejected as natural objects and not artefacts at all. They include undatable bone fragments that showed defleshing marks but had not been worked. Furthermore certain objects were of recent origin: an iron donkey shoe from square 1632 and a lead cartridge case from square 669.

CONCLUSIONS Perlas has with reason stressed the paradox of the earliest settlement of Greece: 'not all regions were settled, the density of settlement varied widely, and the founding of new villages did not take place regularly'."' At present, we are not able to report an EN phase at Kouphovouno, although other Neolithic sites in Laconia may conceivably have one.112 Nevertheless, the characteristically sparse and widely dispersed pattern of settlement in the Peloponnese was established early in the Neolithic.113 By the MN period Laconia certainly participated in this distinctive southern Greek pattern of isolated islands of 111 Perlbs (n. 15), 113 and i18 for 'paradox'. "' To judge from Hope Simpson's recognition of Variegated Ware (also known as Rainbow Ware) in a number of surface assemblages. The difficulty is that it was recognized at Kouphovouno itself, where no other report of EN pottery has been confirmed. Monochrome Neolithic pottery from surface assemblages is not highly diagnostic, and is probably best ascribed to the Neolithic without differentiation: Waterhouse and Hope Simpson 1960, 74 (Kouphovouno), 89 and n. 107 (Ayios Stratigos), 91 and n. 116 (Asteri Karaousi); H. E. Waterhouse and R. Hope Simpson, 'Prehistoric Laconia: part 2', BSA 56 (1961), 140 and n. 175 (Goulas, Plitra). 113 Perlks (n. s5), 118. Given the depth of stratigraphy at Kouphovouno, confirmed by the cores, it may still hold surprises.</page><page sequence="79">'SPARTA BEFORE SPARTA' 127 cultivation. Kouphovouno is located close to the spring line at the foot of Taygetos, and a reasonably close perennial source of water may have made the site attractive."4 Moreover, the fact that the hill was relatively well drained, unlike much of the Sparta basin at this time, must also have been an important factor, though no doubt there were other, possibly less obvious, considerations which brought the first settlers here. Our estimate of the overall size of the Neolithic site, some 4 ha, is based on the spread of all the Neolithic pottery, much of which could not be dated more precisely. But even the smaller sample of pottery closely datable to the MN period shows a similar dispersion. Certainly, the whole surface of the mound would not necessarily have been occupied at the same time, to judge from the different phases and densities of occupation on contemporary sites like Nea Nikomedeia and Sesklo.115 In addition to courts, open spaces and tracks, there would have been storage facilities, and space taken up by quarry pits to recycle mud brick. Nevertheless, with every allowance for such factors, the Neolithic population of Kouphovouno must have numbered hundreds. Intensive farming may in part explain the development of the Neolithic tell: the high inputs required to clear land and develop soil nutrients and texture may have meant that it was the surrounding fields as much as the village itself which tied the population to Kouphovouno. But this cannot be the whole explanation. 'The propinquity of Thessalian communities and the isolation of the Peloponnesian ones clearly also called for different integrative mechanisms. It is as yet difficult to discern what the latter could have been.116 The surface archaeology indicates no essential change in the size of the settlement through the Neolithic period. In 3000 years of history there must have been fluctuations, though the crudity of our data make it difficult for us to distinguish them. It is, all the same, of note that the LN and FN periods see no apparent diminution in the size of the site. This confirms that a substantial centre, with a long history, continued at Kouphovouno at a time when the rest of Laconia, and indeed other areas of southern Greece, start to show evidence of an expansion.117 Long-lived, larger villages, such as Kouphovouno, must have acted as a hub for the small, impermanent and scattered communities of the LN/FN Peloponnese."8 114 cf. M. Johnson, 'Water, animals and agricultural technology: a study of settlement patterns and economic change in Neolithic southern Greece', OJA 15 (1996), 267-95. 115 At Nea Nikomedeia roughly 25% of the total exposed area was occupied by buildings in phases 1 and 2. In phase 3 this falls to 16%, but there are greater uncertainties for this phase. Calculations based on information in K. A. Wardle (ed.), Nea Nikomedeia i (BSA Supp. 25; London, 1996). K. Kotsakis, 'What tells can tell: social space and settlement in the Greek Neolithic', in P. Halstead (ed.), Neolithic Society in Greece (Sheffield, 1999), 66-76, notes the marked differences between MN settlement types at Sesklo A, where buildings were set in space but the whole area of the acropolis was continuously occupied, and Sesklo B, where buildings formed tight clusters, but with spatial and chronological gaps. 116 Perl&amp;s (n. 15), 297.

RENARD Uncertainty still clouds our perception of the Neolithic-Early Bronze Age transition. The finds from Kouphovouno indicate that the site was occupied, though we cannot be sure of the extent of that occupation initially. EH II was certainly a climax phase, and there are hints that by this time the site was a centre of some importance. Its size, again some 4 ha, is considerably larger than any of the EH sites located across the Evrotas in the Laconia Survey area, the largest of which covers c. 1 ha, though other contemporary settlements in the valley, such as Palaiopyrgi and Ayios Vasilios, were probably of the same order.119 Roof-tile hints at the presence of architecture of some pretension and a local administrative role is not out of the question. At the end of the Early Bronze Age there was apparently a break in occupation. Neither Kouphovouno nor, with one or two possible exceptions, any other site in the southern Peloponnese has produced pottery of the EH III phase.120 After a gap, the site was reoccupied in the Middle Bronze Age, possibly in MH II, and it continued to flourish in the Mycenaean period. This history of (re-)settlement in the Middle Bronze Age and, evidently, continued occupation into the Late Bronze Age can again be paralleled in the Laconia Survey area, not least at the Menelaion itself, and at a number of sites on the right bank of the Evrotas (Ayia Kyriaki, Palaiopyrgi, and Ayios Vasilios). At the site of classical Sparta, on the contrary, there is nothing earlier than LH III.2' The MH/LH pottery at the site is not densely distributed, often 2-3 sherds per 25 m1 but with as many as 8 in places. The presence of figurines is not particularly significant, as they are commonly found on Mycenaean settlement sites. Kouphovouno was not a sanctuary like Ayia Kyriaki (Amyklai) but a village, presumably under the control of one of the major centres in central Laconia, such as the Menelaion.
