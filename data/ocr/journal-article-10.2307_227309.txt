<plain_text><page sequence="1">Chauntecleer and Medieval Natural History By John M. Steadman * L IKE Virgil's "Culex," Chaucer's "Nonne Preestes Tale" secures its special effect-the mock-heroic-through deliberately exaggerating the dis- parity between content and style. For so commonplace an incident as a fox's raid on a hen-coop, so humble a setting as a barnyard, personae so insignificant as a cock and a hen, medieval poetic theory demanded an answerable style. Instead of the stylus humilis, however, Chaucer amplifies his base material with all the resources of the stylus altus or gravis.1 Though he begins with the low style appropriate for his subject and returns to it briefly at a crucial moment to describe the pursuit of the fox, he usually employs the loftier style' suitable for persons of the courtly sphere and the subject matter of tragedy. It is this conscious disproportion between matter and manner, between the objects and the idiom of his description, which makes his tale "of a cok and hen" a comic masterpiece. His barnyard fowl-the lowest of rurales-speak, feel, and act like curiales.3 They display the sentiments of courtly lovers, the erudition of prelates, the pride of kings. Nevertheless, for all their "chere of court," Chauntecleer and Pertelote remain merely "a cok and hen" writ large. However "estatlich of manere" and "digne of reverence" they may appear, they represent a thoroughly con- ventional conception of domestic poultry. Though Chaucer exaggerates these attributes to the point of absurdity, they are nonetheless firmly grounded in medieval natural history. Chauntecleer's uxoriousness, regal pride, and cho- leric temperament are characteristic traits of gallus domesticus. Beneath Chaucer's ludicrously inflated portraits of the cock and his paramours there is a firm core of orthodox scientific doctrine.4 1 "Ye been ful colerik of compleccioun,"5 declares Pertelote, and advises her husband to purge himself "bothe of colere and of malencolye."

Although these details may indeed indicate the cock's choleric complexion, Chaucer must surely have had in mind the medieval doctrine that gallus domes- 236</page><page sequence="2">CHAUNTECLEER AND NATURAL HISTORY 237 her diagnosis-that the cause of his dream was "the grete superfluitee Of youre rede colera"-proves false, it nevertheless reflects the contemporary belief that the cock was by nature a choleric animal, hot and dry in com- plexion. According to Bartholomeus Anglicus, this was responsible for his belligerence: "Also the cocke is hotte and drye of complection. And therfore he is full bolde and hardy, and so fyghteth boldly for his wyves agaynste his adversaryes / and assayleth and reeseth on them, and teareth and woundeth theym with is [sic] byl &amp; with his spores." 6 St. Albertus found in the cock's choleric temperament an explanation for his regularity in crowing. According to medical theory (he explained) the movements of choler occur at intervals of three-at every third year, every third month, every third day, or every third hour. As a choleric animal, the cock is subject to the movements of choler at every third hour. At this time he sings most, because choler is produced in the gall-bladder and transmitted to the heart.7 In attributing Chauntecleer's dream to "fume" and "complecciouns, Whan humours been to habundant in a wight," Pertelote demonstrates her famili- arity not only with the theory of dreams but also with the physiology of ticiss is a choleric bird. Pertelote's words refer to the cock's natural temperament, and we must, accordingly, reject Sisam's view (p. 37) that "Complexion now has the narrow sense 'colour &amp; texture of the skin of the face....

Cf. Batmnan uppon Bartholome (London, 1582), p. 183; Pro- prietes des choses, tr. Jehan Corbichon (Lyons, 1491), Book XII, Chapter 17, "Du coq." Cor- bichon's French translation was completed in 1372, and John of Trevisa's English version is dated 6 February 1398. See Gerald E. Se Boyar, "Bartholomaeus Anglicus and his En- cyclopaedia," JEGP, 1920, 19: 168-189. The doctrine that different species of birds and beasts were characterized by different temperaments was well-established in the Middle Ages. According to Bartholomeus (see the introductory chapter to Book XII), birds sought diverse habitations in accordance with their various complexions. The eagle (Book XII, Chapter 1) was "avis naturaliter calida et sicca," whereas the dog (Book XVIII, Chapter 26) was "naturaliter frigidus &amp; siccus: cui nigra colera dominatur," and the ass (Book XVIII, Chapter 7) was "ani- imal melancholicum frigidum scilicet et sic- cum." Similarly, St. Albertus held that "canis et lupus sunt animalia melancholica"; see Alberti Magni Opera Omnia, XII, Qutaes- tiones sutper de Aninialibus, ed. Ephrem Filt- haut (Aschendorff, 1955), p. 169. St. Hilde- garde's Physica, on the other hand, shows a somewhat different conception of the com- plexions of various animals (Migne, P.L., CXCVII, col. 1295): "Gallus et Gallina uterque frigidam et siccam naturam habent"- both cock and hen are melancholy, rather than choleric, in temperament. The falcon was hot and somewhat dry (col. 1296), the ox cold and dry (col. 1323), the swan cold and moist (col. 1289). Unlike Bartholomeus and St. Albertus, she regarded the dog as hot in complexion, like the eagle, the goose, the fox, the otter, the pig, and the tiger (cols. 1292- 1330). 7lbertus, pp. 201-202, ". .. cum quattuor sunt humnores in corpore, secundum diversita- tem vel mutationem temporum eorumn mutatur dominium eorum, ... et in tempore calido et sicco dominatur cholera et in tempore frigido et sicco dominatur melancholia. . . Sed gal- lus est animal cholericum, quod attestatur parvitas capitis respectu proportionis corporis sui et siccitas cerebri, quia parvum habet caput et cerebrum siccum. Sed motus cholerae se- cundum medicos est de tertio in tertium: vel a tertio anno in tertium annum vel a tertio mense in tertium mensem vel a tertio die in tertium diem vel a tertia hora in tertiam lioramn....

STEADMAN gallus domesticus. In St. Albertus' opinion, such "fumositates cholericae" were the reason why the cock usually flapped his wings before crowing.8 Moreover, according to the same scholar, the hen is less choleric than her mate, and this difference in complexion makes the voice of the male more shrill than that of the female.9 Both the timbre of Chauntecleer's voice and the regularity of his crowing depended largely on his choleric temperament. It is, therefore, quite under- standable that he should resent Pertelote's suggestion that he purge himself of excess choler by taking laxatives and thereby conceivably marring both his song and his valor. Moreover, as Pertelote herself was less hot and dry in temperament than her husband, she might easily exaggerate the extent of his "superfluitee" of choler. Even his normal state might appear to her excessively choleric. 2 Chauntecleer's role as Venus' servant and courtly lover is also distinctly in character. Aristotle'" had described "the barn-door cock" as "peculiarly salacious," and Bartholomeus emphasized his generosity and devotion to his wives ("uxores suas"):` And he loveth iolousely [sic] his wives. And whan he findeth meate / he calleth his wyves to gether with a certaine voyce / &amp; spareth his own meate to fede therwith his wives. And he setteth nexte to hym on the royste the henne that is mooste fatte and tender, and loveth her best, and desyreth mooste to have her presence. In the morowe tide, whan he fleeth to get his meate, fyrste he layeth his syde to her syde: and by certayne tokens &amp; beckes, as hit were love tatches, he woweth &amp; praieth her to tredynge. And he fyght- eth for her specially, as thoughe he were Jelouse. And with bylle and spores he chaceth and dryveth away from hym other cockes, that come nyghe his wyves. The cocke he secheth his mleate with his bylle and fete, and scrapeth and over torneth strawe and duste: And when he fyndeth a greyne / he calleth and cryeth to hym his hennes. 8 Ibid., p. 202, "Sic est in proposito, quod tempore motus cholerae membra cholerica tra- hunt ad se multum de cholera et cholera pungi- tivae naturae est et mordicativa, et ideo tem- pore illo gallus ad sedandum et excutiendum choleram illam pungentem extendit alas et movet versus partes anteriores et posteriores et praecipue versus pectoralia, ut tales fuinosi- tates cholericae exeant, et post exitum et excussionemn earundem caiiit." 9 Ibid., p. 201, "Quaeritur ulterius de cantu galli. Et primo, utrum vox eius debeat esse acutior voce gallinae. . . . Sed nunc est ita, quod gallina bonae complexionis est, et quanto minor, tanto melior....

Unde per calorem aperitur via vocifer- andi, et propter siccitatem vox eius magis asperatur.

Both of these writers called attention to the "gentle murmur" with which he invites his wives to partake of a grain of corn. Neckam"4 elevated the same behavior into an example of munificence, describing the cock himself as "munificent" and the grain of corn as a "noble grain." The conventional barnyard cock of these accounts behaves, in fact, very much like the conventional courtly lover. He sues for his lady's favors, fights jealously for her, displays generous and considerate table manners, and mourns her death. It is not surprising, therefore, that several details in Chaucer's description of Chauntecleer bear a close resemblance to Bartholo- meus' description of the cock. Chauntecleer too "loveth iolousely [sic] his wives." He too singles out the most attractive of the hens as his special favorite, sets her beside him on his perch at night, and in the morning avows his love to her. Whether Dame Pertelote is the "mooste fatte and tender" of Chauntecleer's "paramours" Chaucer does not say; nevertheless she defi- nitely excels the others in beauty ("the faireste hewed on hir throte"), and this gives her a special claim on her lord's affections: That trewely she hath the herte in hold Of Chauntecleer loken in every lith; He loved hir so, that wel was him therwith. When the tale begins, she is appropriately seated beside Chauntecleer on his perch: As Chauntecleer among his wyves alle Sat on his perche, that was in the halle, And next him sat this faire Pertelote.... And when Chaucer's fowl declares to his favorite the "joye" and "solas" he experiences "whan I fele a-night your softe syde," he seems to be echoing Bartholomeus' acount of gallus domesticus and his favorite hen ("fyrste he layeth his syde to her syde," etc.). Again, Chauntecleer displays the cock's conventional generosity in sparing "his own meate to fede therwith his wives": And with a chuk he gan hem for to calle. For he had founde a corn, lay in the yerd. He chukketh, whan he hath a corn y-founde, And to him rennen thanne his wyves alle. 12Speculi Maioris Vincentii Burgundi ...

STEADMAN The barnyard cock, as Bartholomeus described him, is so close to the medieval conception of the courtly lover that Pertelote's dismay at Chaun- tecleer's confession of fear is hardly surprising. A cock emboldened by love and jealousy to "fyght for her specially" would have measured up to her ideal of the chivalric lover, but a paramour "aghast of swevenis" violates not only the essential principles of l'amour courtois, but also the basic traits of gallus domesticus. Chauntecleer's lapse from the courtly ideal proves, however, to be merely temporary; his love for his mistress dispells his dread, and he behaves like the "gentil cok" Bartholomeus had portrayed, devoted to his wives and proving himself "free . . . and no nigard" by reserving the "corn" he finds for the ladies. 3 "Thus royal, as a prince is in his halle," Chauntecleer "deyned not to sette his foot to grounde." This regal pride is likewise characteristic of his species. According to Pliny, the vanity of gallus domesticus nearly equalled that of the peacock. The foremost (princeps) exercized royal dominion over his companions, and even the common herd (plebs) flaunted its pride: Nearly equally proud and self-conscious are also our Roman night-watchmen, a breed designed by nature for the purpose of awakening mortals for their labours and interrupting sleep.... They lord it over their own race, and exercise royal sway in whatever household they live. This sovereignty they win by duelling with one another, seeming to understand that weapons grow upon their legs for this purpose, and often the fight only ends when they die together. If they win the palm, they at once sing a song of victory and pro- claim themselves the champions. . . . Yet even the common herd struts no less proudly, with uplifted neck and combs held high, and alone of birds casts frequent glances at the sky, also rearing its curved tail aloft. Consequently even the lion, the noblest of wild animals, is afraid of the cock."5 Berchorius likewise stressed its regal and warlike characteristics, comparing its crest to a crown'6 and developing in detail the analogy between the haughty barnyard cock and the arrogant soldier. Its spurs could be likened to the warrior's weapons, its comb to a helmet, its tail to a banner, its song to a military watch, and a cock-fight to a pitched battle."7 15 Pliny, Natural History, III, Loeb Classi- cal Library (London and Cambridge, Mass., 1940), pp. 321-323. Cf. Vincent, p. 204. For the possible relation of this passage to Chau- cer's "as it were grim leoun," see Sisam, p. 46; Mortimer J. Donovan, "The Moralite of the Nun's Priest's Sermon," JEGP, 1953, 52: 503. 1' Petrus Berchorius, Reductoriu{.m Morale (Venice, 1583), p. 208, "super caput christam [sic] habet rubeam pro corona." Cf. Bartholo- meus, "cristam rubeam gestat in capite pro corona." The Comparatio galli cum presbitero is even more explicit in stressing the cock's resemblance to king and soldier. See Fran- cesco Novati, "'Li Dis du Koc' di Jean di Conde e il gallo del campanile nella poesia medievale," Studi Mediczali, 1904-1905, 1: 479: Quasi rex in capite gallus coronatur; in pede calcaribus, ut miles armatur; quanto plus fit senior pennis deauratur; in nocte dum concinit, leo conturbatur. Like Chauntecleer, this regal cock wears golden feathers. 17 Berchorius, p. 209, "Vel dic etiam secun- dum Plin. quod gallus potest significare milites....

Gallus domesticus was, then, both king and soldier.20 His royal eminence, his military valor, and his pride made him, in several respects, a barnyard epitome of the typical hero of epic and romance.2' That such a conception should lend itself readily to caricature is hardly surprising. Pagan and Christian22 had vied in eulogizing his voice and prowess, and the line of demarcation between Neckam's stilted diction and the burlesque exaltation of the cock is narrow indeed. Chaucer's mock-heroic treatment of Chaunte- cleer and his household was rooted not merely in the tradition of the beast- epic, but also in a conventional picture of the domestic cock as prince and warrior. It is this background which confers meaning on Pertelote's dismay at her lover's exhibition of fear ("I can nat love a coward, by my feith") and caria portat, pennas suas hispides facit, &amp; cristam elevat. Tales pro certo sunt nostri milites moderni.

Concludens hosti mox infert ergo canorum Martem, concludit pneumate praeco sui Non adeo gratas persolvit praeco diei Laudes, cum roseos Cynthius urget equos. 20Jean de Conde's Li Dis du Koc extolls the cock as a model for knights ("Ii chevali- ers"). The "gentil oisiaus, cointes et fiers, nobles et biaus," sheathes his spurs while tend- ing his hens, but bares them to attack any felon who attempts to iinjure his mates. He carries both banner and shield. If deprived of food for eight days, he nevertheless refrains from eating the first grain given him and be- stows it instead on his hens. See Novati, pp. 486-487; Charles Dahlberg, "Chaucer's Cock and Fox," JEGP, 1954, 53: 282. 21 Vincent (p. 204) explains the cock-fight as a duel for supremacy: "si in uno praecinctu atri; plures galli fuerint unus devictis caeteris dominatur, &amp; superbus graditur, finisque duello saepe commorientibus est." 22 Though Pliny and Neckam border on panegyric, St. Ambrose's encomium is even more extravagant: "Est etiam galli cantus suavis in noctibus; nec solum suavis, sed etiam utilis, qui quasi bonus cohabitator et dormien- tem excitat, et sollicitum admonet, et viantem solatur, processum noctis canora siginificatione protestaiis. Hoc canente latro suas relinquit insidias; hoc ipse lucifer excitatus oritur, coe- lumque illuminat; hoc canente moestitiam trepidus nauta deponit, omnisque crebro ves- pertinis flatibus excitata tempestas et procella mitescit; hoc canente devotus affectus exsilit ad precandum, legendi quoque munus in- staurat; hoc postremo canente ipsa Ecclesiae petra culpam suam diluit, quam priusquam gal- lus cantaret, neganda contraxerat. Istius cantu spes omnibus redit, aegris levatur incommo- dum, minitur dolor vulnerum, febrium fla- grantia mitigatur, revertitur fides lapsis, Jesus titubantes respicit, errantes corrigit." (P.L., XIV, cols. 240-241.) Cf. Vincenit, p. 204. After such exaggerated praise from a Father of the Church, Chauntecleer can hardly be blamed for his pride.</page><page sequence="7">242 JOHN M. STEADMAN on the petty kingdom where Chauntecleer exercises royal "governaunce" over his hens: "Regimini plurium sufficit iste gallinarum . )23 4 In stressing Chauntecleer's choleric temperament, his royal jurisdiction and pride, and his uxorious disposition and fidelity to the principles of courtly love, Chaucer went beyond the narrow limits of the usual beast-fable and exploited the fresh source of humor afforded by medieval natural history. To the same tradition belongs Chauntecleer's instinctive knowledge of astronomy and his punctuality in announcing the hours. The common belief in the regularity of the cock's crowing fostered the idea of his instinctive knowledge of astronomy: "They are skilled astrono- mers," declared Pliny,24 "and they mark every three-hour period in the daytime with song. . . ." Neckam25 likewise believed that the cock distin- guished the hours by instinct. The usual explanation medieval scientists gave of this phenomenon was that his song was prompted by the regular movements of certain humors. Besides St. Albertus, 6 Vincent of Beauvais27 and Alexander Neckam28 also held this opinion. Knowing by nature "by kynde, and by noon other lore" "ech ascencioun Of equinoxial in thilke toun," Chauntecleer displays a familiar aptitude of the barnyard cock, exaggerated to the point of absurdity. Parodying medieval scientific doctrine, Chaucer elevates Chauntecleer's conventional ability to sound the hours29 into a technical knowledge of astronomy: 23 Neckam, De Naturis Rerum, ed. Thomas Wright (London, 1863), p. 120. In Nivard's Ysengrirnus (ed. Ernst Voigt [Halle a.S., 1884], p. 251), Sprotinus boasts his suzerainty over twelve hens: Unde meo videor despectior esse parente? Coniugibus bis sex impero solus ego, Quaelibet et minimum non audet tangere granum, Me nisi mandetur praecipiente prius. Jean de Conde (Novati, p. 488) praises the cock's "seigneural" government over his hens: Li kos gouverne son poulage: seingneuralment se fait doubtier, nuls d'iaus ne l'os contraitier; et donc doit bien 1i hons conduire fame et enfans et entreduire sa maisnie, par estouvoir, si qu'il face le Dieu vouloir: gouvrener les doit et nourir, con sire sur iaus seignourir, le bien leur doit moustier et dire, n'il ne le doivent point desdire. 24 Pliny, p. 321; Vincent, p. 204. Cf. Sisam, p. 33; Donovan, p. 503. 25 Neckam, De Laudibus, p. 391, Gallus adest cantu distinguens temporis horae Instinctu genii nunciat ore diem. 26 Albertus, p. 202, "Et quia iste motus cho- lerae est in certis temporibus, ut determinatum est, ideo in certis temporibus et horis quasi horologium cantat et maxime post mediam noctem, quia tunc sol incipit ad hemisphaerium nostrum et oriri et humores calidi moveri in- cipiunt tunc. ..." 27 Vincent, p. 204, "Et dicitur, quod ita cantu suo horas distinguit, quia ex multo calore certis horis humores in ipso recipiunt ebulitionem, indeque salsedinem, &amp; sic pru- ritum, ex qua nascitur delectatio, per quam excitatur cantum." Cf. St. Gregory, Moralia in Job (P.L., LXXVI, col. 529); Hugo of St. Victor, De Bestiis (P.L., CLXXVII, col. 33). 28 Neckam, De Naturis, p. 121, "Solet quaeri ab iis quos agitat talis labor, quare gallus cantu suo horas distinguat. Ad hoc respond- ent, quod ex multo calore recipiunt humores dictae avis ebullitionem, et ex ebullitione sal- sedinem. Salsedo facit pruritum, et ex pruritu nascitur titillatio, ex qua provenit delectatio. Ex delectatione autem excitatur ad cantum. Natura vero statuit certos terminos motibus humorum, unde et certis horis cantat gallus." 29 Though medieval scientists disagreed as to whether the cock crowed every hour or merely every third hour, they accepted essen- tially the same physiological explanation for his accuracy. Since Chauntecleer crows "whan degrees fiftene were ascended," Chaucer has obviously followed the former tradition. Any medieval reader familiar with iiatural history should have readily perceived the causal con- nection between the cock's choleric complexion and his chronometrical accuracy.</page><page sequence="8">CIIAUNTECLEER AND NATURAL HISTORY 243 "The soiinne," lhe sayde, "is clomben up on hevene Fourty degrees and oon, and more, y-wis." In comparing the cock's "crowing in his logge" to "a clokke, or an abbey orlogge," the poet may have had in mind St. Albertus' statement that this fowl sings at certain hours "quasi horologium." Several other details in "The Nonne Preestes Tale" may also reflect the influence of medieval natural history. The deliberate anthropomorphism of Pertelote's query "Have ye no mannes herte, and han a berd?" derives its point from the fact that the cock's wattles or gills were commonly known as "beards" (barbae)." Again, her condemnation of his apparent cowardice ("I can nat love a coward, by my feith") seems all the more appropriate inasmuch as Bartholomeus had alluded to the possibility of occasional cow- ardice in this species: "The cocke beareth a red combe . . : whiche beinge loste / he leseth his hardynes, and is more slowe &amp; cowarde to assayl his adversary." Chauntecleer's impressive display of erudition could be supported by divine authority, which credited the cock with intelligence ("vel quis dedit gallo intelligentiam?")." Moreover, Neckam had explained the cock allegori- cally as "doctor ecclesiae." 32 The cock's keen eyesight was likewise conventional. According to Bar- tholomeus, . . . the cocke is ryghte sharpe of syghte, and therfore he loketh downwarde with the one eye to seche his meat, and upward in to the ayre with the other eye / to be waare of commynge of the egle and of the gossehauke. And if he see one of them come aferre / anone he cryeth to the hennes, and fleeth away / and hydethI him selfe in houses amonge stones or in hedges....33 In "The Nonne Preestes Tale" it is, significantly, Chauntecleer who first detects the fox, while he is seeking food: And so bifel that, as he caste his ye, Amon-ig the wortes, on a boterflye, He was war of this fox that lay ful lowe. In several analogues, on the other hand, the cock remains blind to his danger; the hens first make the discovery, and in Le Roman de Renart, Renart sur- prises Chantecler in his sleep.34 As Chaucer's version is obviously closer to Bartholomeus' idea of the natura galli, it seems probable that he altered the beast-fable to reflect the orthodox conception of the cock's proverbial vigilance. 30 Neckam, De Naturis, p. 121, "Non est autem facile assignare unde palearis rubricata, quae vulgo dicuntur barbae, provenianit." 31 Job 38:36.

STEADMAN 5 Like the digression on the nature and significance of dreams, Chaucer's portrait of the choleric, uxorious monarch of the barnyard is indebted to medieval scientific doctrine. The mock-heroic technique, which lifts Chaunte- cleer and Pertelote virtually into the sphere of curiales, and the parody of the conventions of courtly love are really a reductio ad absurdum of several characteristic attributes of the species-attributes on which natural historians had already lavished extravagant praise. Though Chaucer burlesques them, these traits reflect current scientific belief. Chaucer's fidelity to the natura galli may have been partly conditioned by medieval poetic theory. Matthieu de Vendome's Ars Versificatoria placed considerable emphasis on Cicero's attributa personae.35 Among the most important was natura, which involved not only such factors as age, sex, natural advantages or disadvantages in mind or body-"quae a natura dantur animo et corpori"-but also whether the character was a beast or a human being. 36 If Chaucer's argumentum a natura (i.e., "per naturales proprietates de persona aliquid probare vel improbare, personam propriare vel impropri- are")37 were to have any valid basis, it must be founded on an orthodox con- ception of the natura galli, the nature of the barnyard cock. As Chauntecleer bears a marked similarity to the conception of the domestic cock as set forth in Bartholomeus' chapter "De Gallo," it seems probable that Chaucer was indebted for several details to the De Proprietatibus Rerum, one of the most popular encyclopedias of the thirteenth and four- teenth centuries.38 He could have derived them directly from this work, or else indirectly through Berchorius' Reductorium Morale, which had been strongly influenced by Bartholomeus' encyclopedia.39 35Faral, pp. 119, 135-136; Cicero, De In- ventione, Loeb Classical Library (London, 1949), p. 70, "Ac personis has rebus attributas putamus: nomen, naturam, victum, fortunam, habitum, affectionem, studia, consilia, facta, casus, orationes." See also Geoffrey de Vin- sauf's Docrm-enttutn de modo et arte dictanzdi et versificandi (Faral, p. 310). 36 Cicero, pp. 70-72. 37 Faral, p. 136. 38 Se Boyar, pp. 177, 185. 39 See Erliest H. Wilkins, "Descriptions of Pagan Divinities from Petrarch to Chaucer," Speculum, 1957, 32: 511-522. In the Reduc- toriurn Chaucer could have found a detailed and systematic allegorical exposition of the attributes which Chauntecleer shares with the cock of Bartholomeus' chapter "De gallo." Among various allegorical referents for the cock Berchorius gave special prominence to (1) the "praelatus" or "sacerdos praedicator" and (2) the "religiosus vel etiam omnis qui est fidelis &amp; catholicus christianus"-an inter- pretation particularly interesting in the light of Dahlberg's emphasis on "the cock-priest equation" in this tale and Donovan's concep- tion of Chauntecleer as "any holy man." In moralizing the natura galli, Berchorius ex- plained the cock's hot and dry complexion as charity and chastity, his comb as fervid charity or the helmet of salvation, his voice as preach- ing. His devotion to his wives symbolized the prelate's affection for his subordinates. As the cock especially cherished the fattest and tenderest of his hens, the prelate placed his best subordinates in the highest offices. As the cock distributed to his hens the grains of corn he found, the pious and liberal inan dis- tributed his temporal goods to the poor, and the prelate bestowed them on his subordinates and on the needy. As the cock, while seeking food, still kept an eye out for his enemies, the hawk and the eagle, the prelate exercized a double discretion-turning one eye downwards towards temporal goods and the other up- wards to guard against the onslaughts of the fieild. As the cock fought for his hens, the prelate defended his subordinates from invad- ers; and the preacher, the religious, or the faithful Christian contended against his adver- saries-the world, the flesh, and the devil.</page></plain_text>
