(Patrimoines, Islam.) 336pp. Paris: Editions du CERF, 1997. Fr. 250. The Sunna contains many statements of Muhammad and of some of his Companions describing God in anthropomorphic terms. Such hadiths, just like similar descriptions in the Quran, soon became the subject of major dispute among the religious scholars. While the literalists, especially most Hanbalis, insisted on their acceptance without argument (bila kayf), the rationally inclined theologians attempted to discredit them, either by rejecting them as forgeries or by interpreting their anthropo- morphisms metaphorically, or as not really referring to God. Most famous among the works of the anti-literalist theologians was the Kitdb (Ta'wil) mushkil al-hadith of the Ash'ari theologian Ibn Furak (d. 406/1015). In the present book, Daniel Gimaret gathers these hadiths from the canonical and uncanon- ical Sunni collections, arranging them according to subject matter in chapters dealing with the location and movements of God, His 'body', and His human emotions and behaviour, such as laughing, marvelling, enjoying and being ashamed. He provides a careful, annotated translation of the hadiths, noting variants, identifying their transmitters down to the 'common link', and analyses the efforts to neutralize them by the anti-anthropomorphist theologians, from Ibn al-Thalji and Ibn Qutayba down to al-Suyuti. In his introduction, Gimaret explains that he will not attempt to examine the authenticity of the individual hadiths and expresses his belief that the bulk of them are authentic. He argues that while hadiths concerning predestination, the definition of faith, or the imamate could well be invented because there was an obvious motive and interest to do so, there was no such interest in spreading a belief that God had fingers, a leg and a foot. One would, he suggests, expect the transmitters to have tried to suppress such statements rather than invent them. This view, however, may well be questioned, not only by scholars of the Goldziher-Schacht school, who hold that there are no authentic hadiths going back to Muhammad. Belief in an anthropomorphic God is usually no less grounded in elementary religious sentiment and interest than belief in predestination. To many pious faithful it has ever been a comfort to believe in a personal God with human features and emotions to whom they could readily relate in prayer as it has been a comfort for them to trust that everything that happens in the world is predetermined by God and that they are among the elect. The prominence given to these anthropomorphist hadiths in Hanbali creeds and books like Ibn Khuzayma's Kitab al-Tawhid makes it unlikely that the literalists held on to these merely out of a conservative respect for a tradition which somehow embar- rassed them, and that the famous formula of bila kayf had any agnostic implication. The literalist theologians were quite certain that these anthropomorphic descriptions of God were literally true and that any metaphorical interpretation of them was not only impermiss- ible but false. Ibn Hanbal in fact found the quranic 'nothing is like unto Him' (laysa ka-mithlihi shay'), on which the anti-literalists often relied, more embarrassing than the anthropomorphisms of Quran and Sunna, and declared it to belong to the ambiguous verses (mutashabihat) of the Quran that must not be generalized. The anthropomorphisms in the Sunna are, moreover, much more unambiguous and crude than those in the Quran. Gimaret repeatedly points out the artificiality and arbitrariness of the interpretations of these hadiths by the anti- literalist theologians. If they are indeed authen- tic, the conclusion can hardly be avoided that Muhammad's theological view of God was solidly anthropomorphist. The Quran mostly reflects Muhammad's spontaneous religious experiences rather than theological reflection. The quranic anthropomorphisms are much more amenable to metaphorical interpretation and in some instances distinctly invite it. There is plausible evidence that Muhammad at first interpreted his early vision, described in suras 53 and 81, as a vision of God, but later came to interpret it as a vision of the angel Gabriel. Anti-anthropomorphist verses such as 'Nothing is like unto Him' and 'eyesight does not comprehend Him' (la tudrikuhu 'l-anzar) seem to reflect his later, more reflective view. Haadths asserting that the Prophet told his Companions that he saw his Lord in the most beautiful shape of a beardless youth and that he felt the coolness of His palm between his shoulder blades are difficult to reconcile with the quranic image of God. In the Quran God is both awesome and merciful, but there is hardly a trace of the 'beautiful God' of the Sufis. If Muhammad had really had such an experience of God one would expect to find some reflection of it in the Quran. W. MADELUNG RICHARD C. MARTIN and MARK R. WOODWARD with DWI S.
