<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> REALISM IN ORGANIZATIONAL THEORY:  A REASSESSMENT*  Michael Keeley  Loyola University of Chicago  Among organizational theorists, the old debate concerning the reality of social groups has been largely  settled in favor of a reafisr position, which portrays organizations as natural entities that have many of  the properties of living beings. I argue in this article that an alternative, interacrionisr view has been  too lightly regarded as a general framework for organizational analysis. This view is defended on  descriptive grounds, and its normative advantages are discussed.  Many organizational theorists claim that their subject matter has “objective reality,” that  organizations possess “an existence independent of their members and. . .power over  peoples’ lives” (Aldrich, 1979: 2). Today, such claims are not generally considered  remarkable. But they have historically provoked controversey (see Alport, 1924), and a  few theorists still find it necessary to take up the question, “Are organizations real?”  (Hall, 1977: 23). I believe that those who renew past debates over the reality of groups  are right in supposing there is more to be said. This article will contrast two opposing  approaches to organizational reality: the dominant “realist” approach, which treats social  groups as objects that act like natural entities, and the “interactionist” approach, which  treats social groups as processes that consist of the joint acts of individual persons. These  views will be further distinguished below. Some presumed theoretical and descriptive  merits of the realist approach will then be questioned. And, finally, normative advantages  of the interactionist approach will be outlined.  THEORETICAL ISSUES  Richard Hall suggests a major point of dispute between realist and interactionist views  in his book, Organizations: Structure and Process (1977). (This book is a useful focus  for discussion, since it provides a solid overview of mainstream organizational theory  and contains one of the most explicit defenses of the realist approach to appear recently;  see Warriner, 1956, for an earlier defense.) Hall states that, at first glance, the question  of whether organizations are real seems inane. “[O]rganizations surround us and. . . we  *Direct all communications to: Michael Keeley , Department of Management, Loyola University, Chicago,  Illinois 6061 1.

But a second look at the question will reveal a very  basic issue: whether organizations are anything more than individuals who have come  together in an interaction system” (p. 23). If we look even closer, it appears that this  basic issue does not concern whether organizations are real at all; rather, it concerns  whether organizations are one or another kind of reality, one “more than” or not more  than a system of interaction. The basic issue is easily obscured by the question, “Are  organizations real?,” which is a red herring. In addressing this question, in arguing that  organizations are real, realists tend to assume that only a particular (noninteractionist)  conception of organization respects group reality. This assumption is not often challenged,  and it conceals the full extent of the realist proposition. This proposition is that organi-  zations are not just real, but a specific form of reality-namely, actors that have intentional  properties we normally attribute to living organisms:  When we hear statements such as ‘I t  is company policy,’ ‘2 State University never condones cheating.’  or  ‘Trans-Rhode Island Airline greets you with a smile,’ these are recognizable as being about orga-  nizations. Organizations do have policies, do and do not condone cheating, and may or may not greet  you with a smile. They also manufacture goods, administer policies, and protect the citizenry. These  are organizational actions and involve properties of organizations, not individuals. They are camed out  by individuals. . .but the genesis of the actions remains in the organization. The answer to our basic  question, then, is: Organizations are real (Hall, 1977: 27).  The attribution of organismic properties to social groups has long been common in  realist theories, at least as advanced in sociological, political, and juristic classics (Durk-  heim, 1938; Gierke, 1900; Hegel, 1942). Such theories usually imply that other views  trivialize organizations by misrepresenting them as social fictions. On this count, realists  have expressed especially sharp opposition to views depicting organizations as interactions  or agreements among self-interested participants. Gierke, for instance, opposes the legal view  of organizations as contracts and ‘treats corporate bodies as real corporate persons. . . which  are not merely legally competent. . .but also really capable of willing and acting” (Hallis,  1930: 146). In like manner, Hall opposes the view of organizations as exchange systems  and treats them as really willing or goal-seeking entities. What interactionist theories dispute,  however, is not the reality of organizations, but the need for anthropomorphic conceptions  of organization. Interactionists simply substitute nonorganic realities for organic ones as basic  models of organizational processes. One of the more popular strategies has been to model  organizations after games (Allison, 1971; Goffman, 1969; Silverman, 1970). There is room  for argument about the general utility of a game metaphor. But games are readily understood  and they serve to illustrate how an interactionist model might explain organizational properties  that realists invoke in support of their own views.  An lnteractionist Response to Evidence for Realism  Realists frequently remind us that organizations remain virtually unchanged despite  replacement of individual participants. This fact is taken as evidence that organizations  “have an existence of their own, above and beyond the behavior and performance of  individuals” (Hall, 1977: 26). The troublesome word here is “existence.” One can see  that organizations, given their continuity, must have existence in the sense of independent  reality. But it is not obvious that they must have existence in the sense of organic being,  that in them, for instance, resides the “genesis” of persistent collective action. Imagine  </page> <page sequence="3"> Realism in Organizational Theory 281  that organizations are like games with respect to participant replacement. A game often  remains much the same while players change. This fact suggests that the game has an  independent existence. Still, it does not suggest that the game has a life of its own, above  and beyond those of the participants. Games are stable features of social behavior because  some people find it worthwhile to perpetuate them. Just as it is unnecessary to attribute  organismic properties to games to account for their stability over time, it is unnecessary  to attribute these to organizations.  Another fact about organizations that realists submit causes difficulty for interactionist  views is this: organizations tend to have much influence over their members, who are  not as free to construct lines of behavior as some interactionists suppose. Hall says, “The  organization trains, indoctrinates, and persuades its members to respond on the basis of  the requirements of their position. This response becomes quite regularized and routinized  and does not involve the interaction frame of reference” (pp. 24-25). Realists have  traditionally implied that such response involves submission to something like the will  of a social organism, as manifested in collective tendencies or goals which direct group  activities (see, especially, Durkheim, 1938). But this is not the only possibility. Again,  compare organizations to common games. Normally, a player cannot change the rules  of a game on demand. These rules constrain a player’s performance, perhaps even more  so than the rules of most organizations. The game itself, however, does not will specific  performances; it does not itself train, indoctrinate, or persuade players to behave according  to the requirements of their positions. People can agree with one another to abide by  certain rules, both formal and informal, and no organismic properties need be granted to  games-r organizations-to account for rule-governed behavior. Of course, those cur-  rently engaged in a social practice (participants in a game, employers in an organization)  will frequently have power over newcomers in specifying terms of agreement, the power  to forge “contracts of adhesion.” But, in the game case, we do not confuse this power  with powers ofthe game. Nor do we confuse prudential rule-following in games, wherein  participants observe rules to advance their own interests, with compliance for the sake  of the game’s interests, goals, or requirements. The avoidance of this confusion in the  case of organizations is characteristic of interactionist models.  There remains a related issue. We do at times have reason to attribute acts to orga-  nizations rather than to their participants. The statement, “Exxon made a profit last  quarter,” probably makes more sense than, “Some named individuals who associate as  Exxon made a profit last quarter.” This fact seems to be what realists have in mind in  claiming that the group is “more than” the sum of its parts. Interactionists, though, do  not generally dispute this claim. Organizations can have many properties that are not  simply aggregates of or reducible to individual properties. For instance, an organization  may produce consequences, like profits, that are true properties of the organization and  not just the summed effects of individuals. And it is proper to say that organizations act  in the sense of producing these consequences. But it is a large leap of logic to say that  organizations also act in the sense of intending their consequences, that they have, say,  goals of their own which guide their actions. This is a dubious assertion.  Once more, the game model is useful for purposes of illustration. To say that a game,  such as football, produces revenue at many universities is a logical attribution of action  to the game; revenue is a synergistic consequence of the game as played at the college  level. However, to say that the game of football intends to generate revenue is inappro-  priate. Various people will have intentions or expectations for the game: university  </page> <page sequence="4"> 282 SYMBOLIC INTERACTION Vol. 6iNo. 211 983  administrators may intend revenue, players and spectators may intend victory for one  team or the other, and, certainly, the game may have consequences that are unexpected.  Yet, the game itself intends nothing. As a real but nonliving system of action, it lacks  the capacity to prefer any of its own outcomes. So too in the case of organizations, the  consequences of action may be properties of an organization, while the intent of that  action may not.  The Challenge to Realism  As mentioned earlier, my aim is not to present a brief for a game model of organization,  but only to demonstrate how an interactionist approach might handle typical claims of  social realists. No doubt, organizations are more like contracts than games, the former  suggesting a broader type of interactionist model (Keeley, 1980). What interactionist  views primarily challenge is the realist implication that pervades organizational theory  from introductory through advanced works:  The primary rationale for the existence of organizations is that certain goals can be achieved only through  the concerted action of groups of people. Thus, whether the goal is profit, providing education, religion,  or health care, . . .organizations are characterized by their goal directed behavior (Gibson, Ivancevich  and Donnelly, 1979: 3-4).  . . .the simple but basic fact is that the organization would not exist if it were not for some common  purpose.. . .The purpose or goal is the basis for organizational activities (Hall, 1977: 83).  Social scientists have found it useful to distinguish formal organizations from. . .other forms of social  organization precisely because formal organizations have explicit, specific, and limited goals.. . .Were  we to drop goals from consideration, there would be no need for special theories or formal organizational  structure and behavior (Hannan and Freeman, 1977: 1 I I).  The argument so far is that organizations need not be goal directed; they can exist, can  have real structure and behavior, and still have no intentional properties. Why does it  matter, though, whether organizations are granted or denied organismic features? One  answer is that realist imagery may easily distort social description.  DE SC RI B IN G  0R AN lZATl0N S  REAL I STlCA  L LY  In describing organizational behavior, realist views have historically encountered a serious  problem: it is difficult to specify the intentions or goals that social entities are assumed  to possess. Ordinary participants may only have a vague notion, if any, of an organization’s  goals. And organizations are unable to tell us a great deal about their true intentions  through official “self” reports (e.g., charters or public communications). To deal with  this problem, we are often advised to derive real, operative goals from analysis of group  policies and procedures (Perrow, 1961; French, 1979). But most organizational operations  do not consist of practices whose actual purpose is clear.  Consider a manufacturing operation involving policies and procedures that generate  material consequences, such as products, salaries, profits, pollution, etc. Some of these  consequences are, presumably, “goals”-reasons for action. Others must be “costs”-  expenses of, rather than reasons for, action (unless we are prepared to say that any  organizational consequence, even pollution, is a goal). Now, how does one categorize  </page> <page sequence="5"> Realism in Organizational Theory 283  consequences like profits and salaries. Certain participants and observers may regard the  manufacturing operation as a profit-maker, whose costs include salaries (e.g., investors).  Some may regard this operation as a salary-maker, whose costs include profits (e.g.,  workers). Still others may consider both profits and salaries to be goals (taxing bodies)  or costs (consumers). And there is ordinarily no objective, organizational criterion by  which to resolve such disputes. In the final analysis, what are taken to be goals of an  organization look very much like subjective goals for an organization, as conceived by  someone or other. Frequently, this someone is a top executive in operative-goal accounts  (Price, 1972; Hall, 1977).  It is deceptive, I think, to call goalsfor an organization, goals of an organization. The  latter connotes a degree of unanimity (or at least acceptance) that is rarely evident in  complex organizations. In small, cohesive groups with few external dependencies, the  same goalsfor an organization may be intended or accepted by all participants. Yet, such  cases are of limited interest. In larger organizations, like major corporations, goals for  the organization are diverse and conflicting. And it is generally important to keep track  of whose goals one is speaking of-goals for shareholders, managers, other employees,  customers, and so on. By obscuring the diversity of participant ends, the collective goal  notion precipitates oversimplified analysis of social systems.  The descriptive shortcomings of goal-based theories have been well documented in  past studies of organizations. Dalton (1959), for example, reports on inaccuracies of  bureaucratic theory, which “assumes that members of the organization are relatively inert  and ready to follow the intent of rules.” “The theory. . . slights the fact that in the larger  organizations, local and personal demands take precedence in most cases” (p. 265). His  data suggest that “The typical firm is. . . a shifting set of constrained disruptions, powered  and guided by differentially skilled and committed persons” (p. 270). Conflict and private  interest-seeking, therefore, are simply shrouded in a bureaucratic cloak. At another level  of analysis, Allison (19 7 1) demonstrates how goal-based perspectives promote misleading  explanations of international affairs. In his account of the Cuban missle crisis, he shows  that a game-like model yields a much richer description of events than models which  attribute goals and motives to the governments or organizations involved. Strauss (1978)  provides other examples of insights gained by viewing groups as systems of competitive  interaction, wherein order results from agreement on means, not ends.  While the descriptive aspects of organizational models are important, the balance of  this article will focus on normative aspects, which have received less serious study by  social scientists. General social theories do have prescriptive as well as descriptive im-  plications, and realist theories tend to oversimplify with respect to both.  NORMATIVE IM PLlC AT10N S   As Quinton (1976) notes, social realism has long been connected with an ethical position  that grants intrinsic value to associations; groups are seen to have an irreducible welfare  (e.g., “the common good”) and come to be valued for their own sakes. This ethical  connection is, perhaps, not logically necessary but it is compelling. It would seem strange  to attribute goals, needs, interests, and the like to social entities without also granting  them some claim to satisfaction of these things, some right to our respect to autonomous  “beings.” It is not unusual for this right to overwhelm similar rights of individuals, as  Durkheim (197453) implies:  </page> <page sequence="6"> 284 SYMBOLIC INTERACTION Vol. 6/No. 211 983  The interests of others can have. . .no more intrinsic moral value than our own. In so far, however, as  another participates in the life of the group and in so far as he is a member of the collectivity to which  we are attached, he tends to take on some of its dignity and he becomes an object of our affection and  interest.. . .what binds us morally to others is nothing intrinsic in their empirical individuality; it is the  superior end of which they are the servants and instruments.  This end, of course, is the well-being of the group itself.  Few contemporary theorists would express the idea so strongly, but many popular  views incorporate the notion that, as intentional actors, organizations have a welfare or  good of their own which deserves our respect. This is evidenced in continued use of  organizational goal attainment as a standard of system value or “effectiveness”; it is  still widely believed that organizations should be evaluated on the basis of success in  achieving their own objectives (Steers, 1977; Kahn, 1977). High regard for the welfare  of social entities is also evidenced in continued use of organizational goals as ultimate  values in the selection of research questions; it is still widely believed that an administrative  science should stress how organizations attain or fail to attain their own ends. These ends  serve as “ethical givens” for focusing inquiry (Simon, 1957); they indicate which aspects  of reality are significant (by virtue of goal relatedness) and which are not. The goal of  organizational survival, for instance, remains an implicit value guiding much research  even when attention turns to the environment (Aldrich and Pfeffer, 1976), corporate social  responsibilities (Sethi, 1979), and other external matters. Pfeffer and Salancik (1978:84-  89) make the point explicitly that individuals and their interests have “importance” only  in relation to one’s power to affect organizational well-being. This propostion is offered  both as a descriptive principle for understanding organizations and as a prescriptive  principle for managing them. The propositon, on both interpretations, becomes ques-  tionable if organizational survival is devalued.  Organizational goal attainment is regularly devalued in everyday affairs; this fact casts  doubt on the practical relevance of social realist theories. In such theories, the good of  the organization, because of its supposed generality, tends to assume priority over (or at  least parity with) the good of individuals. But this priority (and even parity) is contradicted  by many well-established customs and well-considered moral opinions. Many of our laws,  for example, have been established precisely to defend the intrinsic importance of indi-  vidual persons against “functional requirements” for organizational goal attainment and  welfare. It is hard to see how the practical concerns that underlie laws like our Civil  Rights Acts can be incorporated in a social realist model. It might be argued that orga-  nizations must take antagonistic laws and opinions into account to ensure their own  survival (Sethi, 1979). But the point is that the very existence of these laws and opinions,  which recognize urgent rights of individuals, calls into question the rights of organizations  to pursue their own goals and, indeed, to survive at all.  Interactionist ideas also call into question organizational rights. The interactionist ap-  proach has historically been connected with the position of ethical individualism, in which  “social objects, groups or institutions, have no intrinsic value that is not constitutive of  the welfare of individual people” (Quinton, 1976:13). In contrast to the implication of  social realism, “any value [institutions] possess is purely instrumental” (p. 13). Again,  the ethical implication may not be logically necessary, but it is hard to escape. In denying  that acts of association create social entities with intentional properties of their own, an  interactionist is consistent in denying that such acts create entities with interests, welfares,  </page> <page sequence="7"> Realism in Organizational Theory 285  and worth of their own. Entities lacking the latter features are properly denied rights  (Feinberg, 1974). Recall the model used earlier for illustration: just as association in a  game does not create intentional properties of the game, it does not create interests or  rights of the game itself. These are all properties of participating individuals. So it is in  the case of organizations.  One might reply that, unlike the game example, we do often attribute (legal) rights to  certain organizations, such as corporations. From an interactionist standpoint, however,  this represents only the adoption of a simplifying bit of fiction-a shorthand way of  refemng to the similar rights of some individuals, which should be (and routinely is)  dropped when it oversimplifies and abridges the rights of other individuals. Hamilton  points out that in law, for instance,  . . .most business corporation acts provide that a corporation may sue or be sued in its own name,  and it is generally accepted that the power to sue or be sued in its own name is an attribute of an entity.  Thus, as a ‘short and convenient mode’ of describing the legal relationships surrounding a corporation,  considering the corporation as a separate entity is undoubtedly useful. It should be emphasized, however,  that a corporation possesses these attributes, not because it is an entity, but because the business  corporation acts so provide. Also, it certainiy does not necessarily follow that because a corporation  possesses certain entity attributes under the statutes, it possesses other entity attributes as well (197 I :981).  Hamilton concludes,  Whether or not [a corporation] should be deemed a separate ‘legal entity’ or ‘legal person’ should  depend on the question to he resolved. A corporation may be an entity for some purposes and not for  others. In such circumstances, to argue that a corporation is an entity, and therefore that certain results  follow, is to put the cart before the horse (p. 1009).  The central normative weakness of the realist view is that it does not recognize this point.  Instead,  . . .corporations can be full-fledged moral persons and have whatever privileges, rights and duties as  are in the normal course of affairs, accorded to moral persons [like human beings] (French, 1979:207).  A concrete case concerning “corporate rights” may help to demonstrate the imprudence  of such a view.  Corporate Rights of Speech  Recently the United States Supreme Court, in First National Bank v. Bellorti (435  U.S.  765, 1978), invalidated a Massachusetts statute prohibiting corporate expenditures  aimed at “influencing or affecting the vote on any question submitted to the voters, other  than one materially affecting any of the property, business or assets of the corporation”  (p. 768). The Court held, five to four, that this statute violated “the corporation’s” rights  to free speech. Writing for the majority, Justice Powell said,  If the speakers here were not corporations, no one would suggest that the State could silence their  proposed speech. It is the type of speech indispensable to decisionmaking in a democracy, and ,this is  no less true because the speech comes from a corporation rather than an individual (p. 777).  Concerned with the implication of the statute for media corporations, Chief Justice Burger  added,  </page> <page sequence="8"> 286 SYMBOLIC INTERACTION Vol. 6/No. 2/1983  . . .the First Amendment does not ‘belong’ to any definable category of persons or entities: It belongs  to all who exercise its freedoms (p. 802).  Realists would, no doubt, agree. But a more sophisticated position is outlined in Justice  White’s dissent.  Justice White argues that corporate communication is not on a par with individual  expression and, thus, may be subject to restrictions that do not apply to individual speech.  He maintains that the First Amendment values self-expression, self-realization, and self-  fulfillment, which are not necessarily furthered by corporate communications: “They do  not represent a manifestation of individual freedom or choice” (p. 805). Justice White  well recognizes that some communications of corporations deserve protection as a con-  venient means of protecting individual First Amendment rights (e.g., in cases of the press  or common-interest groups like the NAACP). He explains, however, that profit-making  corporations generally have no common political or social goals, that communications  by corporate managers regarding political or social issues are not ordinarily expressive  of the heterogeneous beliefs of shareholders, and, therefore, that such communications  are not guaranteed full protection as speech of the corporation. The speech in question  is, in fact, that of managers, and it is proper to disallow use of corporate funds for the  propagation of their political opinions (though, of course, managers may use their own  resources for this purpose). In short, measures designed to prevent dominance of political  processes by those who control corporate wealth are quite consistent with First Amendment  guarantees of a “free marketplace of ideas” (see also Hart and Shore, 1979). An inter-  actionist can find much to agree with in this analysis.  O’Kelley (1979) points out a few relevant errors in Justice White’s dissent-most  importantly, his failure to conclude that the Massachusetts statute is overbroad. The  statute prohibits corporate expenditures for nonbusiness communications even in situations  where unanimity of belief prevails. While these situations may not be the rule, they do  arise (e.g., in a corporation sole) and must be exempted from restrictions. In O’Kelley’s  view, Justice White’s error, though major, pales in comparison to mistakes of the majority,  whose reasoning confuses corporations with natural persons and ignores principles es-  tablished in prior cases. O’Kelley shows that, in the past, the Court has consistently  granted constitutional rights to corporations only in instances where these organizations  are the instruments through which particular individual rights are exercised-that is, in  instances where the denial of legal rights to corporations would deny the constitutional  rights of some human beings. The Court has declined to treat corporations as full-fledged  persons with independent rights but, rather, has looked to see whose rights are being  asserted through the corporate device and what constitutional protections are available to  these individuals. This precedent was overlooked by the majority in First National Bank.  The consequence is an opinion that has the earmarks of realist oversimplification. In  assuming that corporations have the same rights of speech as natural persons, the Court  failed to see that the rights being asserted are mainly those of top managers, who stand  to gain unwarranted protection to amplify their speech through the corporate treasuj.   The First National Bank decision has yet to be reconciled with public policy in other  areas, say campaign financing. Thus, the Court will have future opportunities to reconsider  the principles abandoned in this case. I would suggest that the Court (and social scientists  who advocate a similar realist position) can make sounder policy judgments about or-  </page> <page sequence="9"> Realism in Organizational Theory 287  ganizations (including how to evaluate, study , and manage them) by taking more seriously  the interactionist point of view. The normative implications of this viewpoint are worth  summarizing.  CONCLUSION  Natural persons, as intentional individuals, are capable of organizing to further their own  interests and well-being. The well-being of individuals has intrinsic value and this is  expressed in the recognition of individual rights: moral or human rights, such as the right  to equal concern and respect (Dworkin, 1978), or at least legal rights, such as those  specified in our Constitution. Organizations, on the other hand, have no intentions,  interests, or well-being of their own, nothing of intrinsic value that deserves respect as  a matter of right. They cannot have moral rights (any rights independent of legal rules).  And they cannot have legal rights for their own sakes since they have no “sakes.”  Nevertheless, organizations-governments, corporations, unions, etc .&lt;an acquire legal  rights for the benefit of natural persons. It is useful to extend a legal right to organizations  when this furthers the enjoyment, by all participating individuals, of a prior moral or  legal right. Realists are generally not so careful in acknowledging organizational rights.  A common mistake is to assume that an activity, which benefits individuals and deserves  protection when performed by them, likewise benefits the members of an organization  and deserves protection when “performed by” the organization. The problem is that,  unlike individual action, action attributed to an organization may be intended by and  benefit only some influential members of the social “body.” In this case, organizational  rights to the act may not protect individual rights but individual power; a main virtue of  interactionism is that it reminds us of the difference.  The interactionist approach provides a useful framework for examining other normative  issues, such as corporate social performance questions. It can handle the complaint that  the concept of “social responsibility” does not make clear sense when applied to or-  ganizations (Letwin, 1978); yet an interactionist view opens additional possibilities for  addressing social performance concerns. To be more specific, a view of organizations as  nonorganic systems of interaction suggests that they can have neither moral rights nor  moral duties, i.e., social responsibilities. Indeed, some writers have argued from an  interactionist viewpoint that public interference with organizational affairs in the name  of some alleged social responsibility is unjustified (e.g., Hessen, 1979). But this is too  simplistic (Hamilton, 1979). While it may be illogical to expect organizations to behave  responsibly, like natural persons, it is not illogical to expect organizations to exhibit those  moral or social qualities we find desirable in similar systems, like games. It is certainly  odd to ask whether a game is itself behaving responsibly, but is is quite reasonable to  ask whether the game is fair, right, harmful, or something of this sort. Most would agree  that a potentially violent game, to the extenE that it entails penalties for injurious acts, is  socially preferable to a comparable game which entails no penalties, but allows the  participants to inflict unlimited injury on one another to further their own cause. So also  in the case of organizations, those minimizing injurious consequences to participants  could be considered preferable from an interactionist perspective. In all probability, such  a perspective would justify stronger public policies toward organizationally produced  harms than an organismic-realist view. The former is more likely than the latter, for  </page> <page sequence="10"> 288 SYMBOLIC INTERACTION Vol. 6/No. 2/1983  instance, to provide a rationale for a strict liability policy, since it denies organizations  the kinds of intention-based excuses for their acts that we accept from natural persons.  In sum, an interactionist approach to social performance problems treats these as part  of the larger problem of fairly allocating benefits and burdens, rights and duties, among  those who participate in organized activities. This larger problem is an important one in  the administration of organizations, and it is important in an interactionist research agenda.  Realist theories divert attention from allocation questions by emphasizing the overall  welfare of social systems. Systems may be indifferent to the fate of particular people.  Actual people, of course, are not so indifferent. Interactionist theories can respect this  fact by acknowledging individual interests and rights-rather than system objectives-  as the appropriate “ethical givens” for a science of organization. An orientation of  organizational inquiry along interactionist lines implies a broader program of research:  for instance, more empirical study of how organizations produce harmful consequences  for individuals (such as crime; Farberman, 1975), instead of preoccupation with those  system-enhancing consequences identified as goals; more theoretical development of  distributional criteria for organizational evaluation (such as justice; Keeley, 1978), instead  of refinement of narrow, goal-based measures of effectiveness; more attention to the  practical informational needs of all those who take part in managing our complex or-  ganizations (such as judges, legislators, regulators), instead of concentration on questions  of interest to the nominal managers. As a descriptive guide, an interactionist model may  increase our understanding of organizations; but, more to the point, as a normative guide  it may increase the relevance of administrative science to a wider segment of society.
