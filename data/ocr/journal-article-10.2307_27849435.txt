<plain_text><page sequence="1">David E. Doyei The Prehistoric Hohokam of the Arizona Desert The archaeological record sheds some light on the cultural growth and change undergone by the Hohokam over 1,700 years For over a century the southwestern portion of the United States has provided anthropologists with a unique laboratory for the study of native American culture. Archaeolo gists have discovered aboriginal set tlements and artifacts documenting human occupation of the region for at least the past 10,000 years. Perhaps best known to the American people are the Anasazi, the "ancient ones," who constructed spectacular large stone pueblos and cliff dwellings be tween A.D. 1000 and 1300 at Chaco Canyon, Aztec, and Bandelier in New Mexico, Mesa Verde in Colorado, Hovenweep in southern Utah, and Canyon de Chelly and Navajo Na tional Monument in northwestern Arizona. These national parks and monuments surround what is known as the four-corners region, where the four states share a common boundary point. Much of the archaeological research accomplished in the South west has focused on this region, making it one of the most intensively studied archaeological provinces in the world. Considerably less field work has been conducted in the more southerly portions of the Southwest, including the mountains and vast desert regions of central and southern Arizona. By 1950 research had resulted in a tripartite division of prehistoric Southwestern culture into the Ana sazi, the Mogollon, and the Hohokam, which archaeologists have tradition ally associated with three distinct geographic areas and environmental zones (Fig. 1). The Anasazi inhabited the northern district known generally as the Colorado plateau, with its ma jestic weathered stone mesas and scrub brush and juniper-pine vege tation. The Mogollon occupied the forested mountain region of east central Arizona and west-central New Mexico, with its abundant water supply and cold winters. Broad river valleys, rugged mountain ranges, a wide variety of cacti and other des ert-adapted plants, and hot summers characterize the Sonoran Desert province, the home of the Ho hokam. The ascription of a particular pre historic site to one of these groups has traditionally been based on three general criteria: pottery, architectural styles, and mortuary customs. The Anasazi produced black-on-white and gray pottery, lived in round pithouses and, later, rectangular pueblos, and buried their dead without cremation. The Mogollon manufactured brown, red, and red-on-brown pottery, had their own pithouse and pueblo ar chitectural styles, and also buried their dead without cremation. The Hohokam constructed square to rec tangular semisubterranean houses of a unique style and later made houses of adobe. They produced a plain brown utility pottery and a distinctive red-on-buff decorated pottery but produced little red pottery until late in their history. Unlike the other two groups, the Hohokam cremated their dead. Research on the Hohokam has had a spotty history, only occasionally il luminated by short-lived ventures into the field. The less spectacular nature of the ruins and the often op pressive desert heat, which coincides with the traditional summer field work schedule, have rendered the desert a less attractive place to con duct research. Southwestern ar chaeologist Emil Haury has recently remarked that work in the desert re gion lags behind that in the northern districts by forty years or so (1 ). But from the beginning archaeologists noted with interest the differences in the prehistoric remains located in the Arizona desert, and, by the early 1900s, they recognized that the cul ture of the Gila valley was quite dif ferent from that of the northern pueblos. In the late 1920s, anthro pologist A. L. Kroeber reaffirmed this distinction when, as a result of eth nographic research, he separated a Gila-Sonoran culture from that of the northern pueblos. By the 1930s suf ficient research had been accom plished to warrant a conference on the "red-on-buff culture," at which it was generally agreed that the tradi tion in the desert was significantly different from that of the Anasazi, and the name Hohokam was formally accepted (2). The term is a Pirna In dian expression meaning "all used up," but archaeologists have pre ferred more romanticized translations such as "those who have gone" or "that which has perished." The slow pace of archaeological fieldwork in the desert has created a distressing situation, as the fragile David E. Doyel received his Ph.D. in anthro pology from the University of Arizona in 1977. As staff archaeologist for the Arizona State Museum from 1972-79, he conducted exten sive fieldwork in the state of Arizona and wrote numerous publications on the prehis tory of the southwestern region of the United States. Along with his continuing involvement in the growing field of cultural resource man agement, he is interested in the evolution of social and economic systems among subsis tence agriculturalists. Dr. Doyel is currently the director of cultural resources for the Na vajo Tribe. Address: Cultural Resource Man agement Program, The Navajo Tribe, P.O.

This map of Arizona and bordering regions of the Southwest shows the locations of the major prehistoric culture areas. The Ana sazi occupied the four-corners region south to the Little Colorado Hiver in Arizona, and the Mogollon inhabited the mountainous zones of east-central Arizona and west-central New Mexico. Although the Hohokam shared a long border with the Mogollon in central Arizona, the area of primary Hohokam occupation was in the broad river valleys in the desert region of southern Arizona. The map shows the core Hohokam region and the area of maximum distribution at around A.D. 1000. remains are rapidly being destroyed by growing population centers and increased land use. Fortunately for the archaeologists, and ultimately for the American people, recent federal legislation, such as the National En vironmental Policy Act, has required that land managers and developers consider the impact to antiquities prior to any modification of public lands. A program known as cultural resource management has grown out of this legislation, making it possible for archaeologists to investigate many ruins and areas that would not have been selected from a purely academic perspective. Owing to this develop ment, we have gained a much better understanding of the range of varia tion of Hohokam settlements and their temporal and spatial distribu tions. Hohokam chronology and origins One of the most persistent and seri ous problems hampering research in the desert region is the absence of materials that can be dated by abso lute methods. A chronology based upon tree rings has been developed for the northern portion of the Southwest and has revolutionized work in that region. Unfortunately, because trees amenable to this dating technique do not grow in the desert, less absolute methods have had to be used in establishing the Hohokam chronology. Most of the chronology was developed during the 1930s at the large site of Snaketown, located near the center of Hohokam country between the modern cities of Tucson and Phoenix (3). Here, stratified trash deposits, superimposed house floors, cemet eries, and Anasazi trade pottery were i'&lt;''' '^"^^ ; V Qrand Cannon - ?:-^:-T^ , Colorado River : ' ' ' //: 'V-''-'f?

The consistent stratigraphie occurrence of certain pottery types on house floors and in the trash deposits made it possible to construct a relative sequence of cul ture from early to late. The Anasazi trade pottery was then employed to align these levels with the tree-ring chronology and with the Christian calendar. However, because the Pi oneer Period (ca. 300 B.C.-A.D. 550) levels were thought to date to a time prior to the beginnings of pottery production in the northern districts, there was no independent method of dating either the time span or phase durations for the entire Pioneer Pe riod. Based upon the amounts of residue present, the stratified nature of the trash deposits, and the knowl edge that phases in the Anasazi region often lasted for considerably long periods of time, the Pioneer Period was divided into four phases each lasting 200 years. The original and still generally em ployed chronological scheme spans over 1,700 years and is divided into four major periods and numerous smaller phases (Table 1). Since its introduction, this chronology has been the subject of no fewer than five major revisions, with most of the de bate centering on the Pioneer Period and the rather arbitrary selection of 200-year phase intervals. A persistent theme is that the pottery types used Table 1.

Revi sions of the chronology have been directed toward reducing the amount of time in each of the phases or mak ing the phases overlap, thereby com pressing the 1,700-year chronology into less than 1,000 years. Because of these continuing prob lems, Haury returned to Snaketown in 1964 to gather more data. Using newly developed dating methods, he essentially reaffirmed the original chronology and retained the period phase structure with only minor re visions. Although his latest efforts at Hohokam chronology-building have not gained acceptance at all (4,5), it should be pointed out that Haury's position is supported by a substantial body of evidence, while most alter native chronologies are based upon a more selective reading of the evidence or upon highly localized conditions. A second persistent problem associ ated with Hohokam prehistory is the question of origins. The basic chal lenge has been to identify the ante cedents of Hohokam culture. Fifty years ago, A. V. Kidder remarked that the remains found in the Arizona desert were so aberrant as to suggest that "we had overstepped the limits of the Southwestern culture area" (6). Since that time many archaeologists have argued that the Hohokam were a group of immigrants from far to the south in Mesoamerica. During this period of research, how ever, Haury steadfastly maintained that the Hohokam were not immi grants from Mesoamerica but were the descendants of the indigenous archaic-period Cochise culture. He argued that cremation burial, worked-stone artifacts, and projec tile-point styles typical of the early Hohokam and an incipient agricul tural complex existed in Arizona by 500 B.C. and that an evolutionary se quence from Cochise to Hohokam could be demonstrated. He believed that this Cochise complex repre sented the ancestral stock from which developed both the Hohokam and the Mogollon, stimulated along the way by the diffusion of various elements such as pottery from Mesoamerica (7, 8). Haury's more recent work at Snaketown has persuaded him to alter his long-held position. He now argues that a complex of traits in cluding established sedentary vil lages, canal irrigation, corn, beans, squash, and possibly cotton, pottery, clay figurines, cremation burial, and a developed craft industry consisting of worked stone, shell, and bone was introduced into the Arizona desert by - *KN!. -R - -- e~ . - - - - - - * - -- - * --. * -- - * --- - * - * . ml ..... - - -- *E 3- --Q .-.-.--.-.-.-.-. - * -- - - * * -* - Figure 3.

Houses were usually rectangular or oval, and roof-support beams were placed around the perimeter and in the center of the structures.

Recently, many archaeologists less inclined to accept the migration hy pothesis have argued that Haury's original position?that of local evo lution?is more probable. It has been suggested that the dating of some of the traits in Haury's complex is not firm. Even his hypothesis that sed entary villages based upon agriculture were the way of life in the area during the Pioneer Period has been ques tioned. Generally, the critics of the migration model do not emphasize the argu ment that there was typological and historical continuity in architectural and artifactual traits between the Cochise and the Hohokam. Rather, they have been more interested in developing theoretical models of the evolution of subsistence and settle ment systems in the desert environ ment within the context of demo graphic growth. Regardless of the logical possibilities for local evolution, it should be pointed out that there remain striking differences between the latest known Cochise sites and the earliest known Hohokam, and that the resolution of the problem of ori gins will not come through the pro liferation of more theories. What is required is a new, concerted effort to discover sites dating to this critical time period so that we may learn more about the latest Cochise as well as the earliest Hohokam. Hohokam cultural history According to Haury's reconstruction, the earliest, or Vahki, phase of the Pioneer Period began sometime around 300 B.C. with the movement of a small group of immigrants from Mexico into the Gila-Salt region. They brought with them knowledge of house building, pottery manufac turing, weaving, and farming by means of canals, and a variety of craft industries including the production of anthropomorphic figurines. Al though variable, Hohokam settle ments dating prior to A.D. 1100 were composed of dispersed single-unit dwellings often surrounded by refuse, cemetery, and ceremonial mounds. The earliest houses were large and well constructed, consisting of nu merous support beams around a square or rectangular dwelling space which was then covered by thatch and plaster. Houses were equipped with ground-level entryways, interior hearths, and plastered floors (Fig. 3). Our knowledge of Pioneer Period houses is sketchy. Haury was able to document only 62 houses, many of them disturbed by later construction, for the Pioneer Period, which ac cording to his reconstruction lasted some 850 years. By contrast, for the shorter Colonial and Sedentary pe riods 143 houses have been docu mented at Snaketown alone, while many other houses have been exca vated at other sites. The only Pioneer Period houses that have been exca vated at sites other than Snaketown date to very late in the period. How ever, a systematic search for sites of the early Pioneer Period has not been undertaken. Decorated pottery appears at Snaketown by the time of Christ; it is dark in color with simple red-painted rectilinear and geometric broad line designs. Similar designs have a much wider distribution, extending into New Mexico and possibly into Chi huahua, Mexico, but apparently dating to a slightly later time. By A.D. 350 Hohokam pottery had become technically more advanced and ex hibited more complicated design styles as well as more varied vessel shapes (Figs. 2 and 4). We know very little about the nature of regional settlement distributions and subsistence practices for the Pi oneer Period culture. Sites appear to be relatively small, some containing pithouses, located along the major rivers. Only two sites dating to the earliest Vahki phase have been exca vated, and excavated materials from the Estrella and Sweetwater phases are rare. By the time of the Snake town phase we have more concrete evidence of a widening of the area occupied by the Hohokam, including settlements in more arid desert areas, as well as in smaller peripheral drainage systems. This appears to represent a dispersion of a growing population, although the specific nature of the expansion is not un derstood. Although Haury has rightly empha sized the importance of canal irriga tion among the Hohokam, as they were the only native North Americans to develop a sophisticated canal irri gation technology, it also seems clear that not all Hohokam settlements were associated with canals. Some sites are located in areas where canals simply could not be constructed, which argues for a need to widen our perspective on Hohokam subsistence. Numerous farming methods could be employed in the desert region, as has been documented among the native populations during the ethnohistoric period. Canals could be constructed where the proper soils, gradient, and landform existed. Elsewhere, river and stream floodplains could be farmed using groundwater, while ar royos and terraces could be farmed using various floodwater systems. 1979 September-October 547</page><page sequence="5">While the Hohokam of the Pioneer Period possessed domesticated crops, it is probable that, like their descen dants, they also depended on the natural bounty of the Sonoran desert ecosystem. A wide variety of native plants and animals were exploited to supplement the diet and were relied upon during years when harvests were poor. It has even been suggested that the Hohokam of the Pioneer Period may have depended more on wild native products than on agri culture for subsistence. Hohokam society during this period exhibited little complexity. Canals appear to have been village specific, requiring little in the way of inter vill?ge coordination and cooperation. No status differentiation can be in ferred from the architectural or burial patterns, and no community lodges or other public buildings are known to have existed. Aside from the canals, the only "public" works that can be identified are several large earthen mounds at Snaketown that were constructed partly of accumulated trash and partly of clean desert soil. They suggest some form of ceremo nialism similar to that found in Mexico and among the mound builders in the eastern United States. The distinctive Hohokam figurines made of fired clay, as well as incense burners and other artifacts, also hint at ritual behavior (Fig. 5). Significant changes are detectable in the Hohokam sequence during the Colonial and Sedentary periods, be tween A.D. 550 and 1100, when the Hohokam underwent a time of pop ulation growth, regional expansion, and developing complexity in their material products. Populations began to colonize many areas, and by A.D. 1000 Hohokam settlements were distributed over an area of no less than 26,000 km2 (10,000 square miles) which included all the major river valleys in southern Arizona. Settle ments in the central region, such as Snaketown, also continued to grow, approaching 100 hectares in area and populations of approximately 1,000 people. Numerous smaller settle ments were also established along the rivers. The distribution of settlements suggests that the Hohokam were be coming more familiar with their des ert environment and had elaborated the range of subsistence practices h?HB&amp; Wi^BS S??^????

The full ce ramic figure and the crude facial characteristics indicate that these figurines date to the early Pioneer Period. During the later Colonial and Sedentary periods, figurines were usually made of clay heads attached to perishable bodies. The later figurines reflect a concern with portraying facial characteristics as if they were individual portraits. Although we do not know the ultimate origins of the Hohokam-style figurines, many strongly resemble figurines made far to the south in Mexico. Figure 6.

In the drainages surrounding the central Gila-Salt region, settlements were supported by a diversity of dry farming methods supplemented by the hunting and gathering of native food products. Evidence for these dry farming systems is apparent to us today in the form of numerous rock piles found distributed over the river terraces and foothills throughout much of southern Arizona?the result of land clearing for farming. Other farming methods included the con struction of terraces, check dams, and gridded gardens, all designed to slow down and direct the spread of water evenly over the field systems (10). The use of improved domesticated crops may also have been an impor tant aspect of the "adaptive radia tion" of Hohokam populations to a wider variety of environments. The situation in the Gila and Salt river valleys in the central region was somewhat different. Here, the rivers have formed-flat, generally gravel-free terraces, which allowed for the con struction of extensive irrigation sys tems. Large canal systems serving multiple villages became common. Over 200 kilometers of canals have been mapped, and many ditches have undoubtedly been reused or plowed under during the ?tistoric-period ex pansion into the desert area. Some of th?se ancient ditches, excavated by the Hohokam from hard desert soils with nothing but pointed wooden sticks, measure over 5 meters wide and 3 meters deep (Fig. 7). Population growth in the central re gion was accompanied by the devel opment of several types of public places where games and ceremonies were conducted. Around A.D. 500, ball courts were introduced. These large, oval-shaped, bordered depressions varied in size; the largest court re corded approaches the size of a mod ern football field. Over 100 courts have been recorded in southern and central Arizona, and undoubtedly many remain to be found. They served as a central focus of activities, where people from numerous villages could come together for social, eco nomic, and recreational purposes. Similar courts have a longer history in Mexico, and the Hohokam courts are thought to have been inspired by the southern models.

The prehistoric Hohokam are well known for their harnessing of the desert rivers by means of extensive irrigation systems ex cavated out of the hard desert soils with noth ing but pointed wooden sticks. Over 200 kilo meters of canals have been mapped in the Gila-Salt region of southern Arizona, and many of the ancient ditches have been reused by modern farmers.

Con structed of usually clean desert soil excavated from nearby sources, these mounds were either round or square in plan and had plastered walls and floor surfaces. The concept of the platform mound is again Mesoamer ican in origin, and indeed the Ho hokam mounds exhibit the numerous remodeling episodes characteristic of platform mounds in Mexico. The Hohokam mounds are thought to have served a ritual or ceremonial function. An increase in the production of na tive craft arts is clearly evident for these periods. The carving of jewelry and other items of adornment in shell, stone, and bone was common, as was the production of carved-stone and fired-clay animal and human repre sentations (Figs. 6 and 8). Ornate clay figurines, highly stylized stone pal ettes, and incense burners made of stone and clay also became common. Acid etching of shell was known to the Hohokam long before it appeared in European craft industries. Work in textiles also flourished. Numerous objects imported from Mesoamerica, including copper bells, mosaics, stone mirrors, and birds with ornate plumage, have also been found from these periods. In general, the Colonial and Sedentary periods of Hohokam cultural history represent a time of high aesthetic achievement, and in this respect the Hohokam excelled above all other Southwestern popu lations. All these developments occurred within a context of increasing social and settlement complexity. Large sites such as Snaketown possessed the range of public places, while the bur ial remains suggest increasing social differentiation. But nearby are found much smaller settlements that lacked the public places and much of the ornate material culture. In the Gila valley, a settlement pattern has been identified that consists of one large site and several smaller sites along a single canal system. This pattern, which can be seen along both sides of the Gila River between the modern settlements of Florence and Coolidge, has been referred to as an "irrigation community," wherein the various villages linked by a canal system are thought to have been economically and politically integrated into a larger community network (11). The Hohokam Classic Period is in some ways misnamed. Between A.D. 1100 and 1150 the dynamic growth pattern of the earlier periods sud denly changed. Large settlements such as Snaketown were abandoned; outlying areas where subsistence was dependent upon dry farming either were depopulated or underwent a major restructuring in settlement patterns and material expression. There appears to have been some population movement into the more well watered river valleys, which may have contributed to greater popula tion concentrations and perhaps subsistence stress along the rivers. Architectural patterns shifted from the traditional pithouses to rectan gular surface structures built of adobe. Some of these houses were tightly clustered into walled villages called compounds, indicating a shift away from the sprawling rancheria type of settlement characteristic of the earlier periods (12). A new em phasis was placed upon the con struction of massive ceremonial platform mounds, sgme of them measuring over 5 meters in height and 50 meters in length. Villages often tended to cluster around these mound groups (Fig. 9). A polished red pottery with a glossy black interior became popular at this time, while the production of red on-buff pottery declined markedly. The burial pattern became much more variable and included both cremation and inhumation. Produc tion of the distinctively Hohokam craft items such as figurines, effigies, Figure 8. The Hohokam also produced ornate objects of carved stone depicting both animal and human forms.Objects such as this one, which is 7.5 cm in diameter, were probably made by craft specialists for ceremonial and religious purposes. 1979 September-October 549</page><page sequence="7">palettes, and stylized projectile points was discontinued. In general, there was a decline in Hohokam influence on a wide scale, and interaction with neighboring cultural traditions was on the wane. Hohokam pottery and other items from this period are rarely found in the outlying regions, and ball courts found outside the central re gion do not postdate A.D. 1125 (13). Around A.D. 1300 several large mul tistoried structures, known as "big houses," were constructed inside massive walled compounds in the Gila-Salt area. Although these structures have been the subject of various interpretations, they are now generally believed to have been the dwellings of the chiefly lineages. An interest in astronomy appears to have been associated with the big houses, and additional energy was invested in the construction of specialized cere monial and storage rooms. These de velopments are roughly correlated with the introduction of a foreign polychrome pottery decorated in red, black, and white, which was similar in style to pottery distributed from the Tonto Basin in central Arizona to as far south as Casas Grandes in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico. The post-A.D. 1300 period seems to have been a time of renewed contacts with other cultural traditions. Social and economic systems Recent research has provided the opportunity to explore the nature of Hohokam society in greater detail. We now know that by A.D. 550 to 700 the Hohokam had undergone a major period of population growth. The in creased population expanded to oc cupy a very large territory, and the Gila-Salt region probably attained the highest population density in the Southwest during the prehistoric period. Along with this dynamic growth pattern we see a trend toward increasing complexity in settlement patterns. Large sites possessed a wide range of public facilities such as ball courts and platform mounds, and many settlements were integrated into larger social and economic net works through their participation in irrigation projects of sufficient mag nitude to have required a somewhat complex form of political organiza tion. Increased differentiation in burial goods further suggests that social ranking was an important part M compound walls platform mound -room walls o firehearth X burial 15 m Figure 9. Hohokam settlements of the period between A.D. 1100 to 1450 shifted from the use of single-unit pit structures to above-ground houses often tightly clustered into walled units, or compounds. Large platform mounds are often integrated into the settlements, and the larger sites of this period consist of numerous compounds and mound groups distributed along a canal system. The village illustrated here?the Escalante ruin, on the Gila River near Florence, Arizona?was planned and laid out prior to construction, as determined by the fact that the houses were built only after the main outer and interior plaza walls were con structed. Also seen in the map are large cere monial rooms, living rooms with entryways and hearths, and small storage rooms. Each plaza generally possesses all of these room types. of Hohokam society. The various or nate goods recovered from sites such as Snaketown strongly suggest that religion and ceremonialism were highly formalized and served to in tegrate the various communities throughout the region. Many of the material expressions and organizational forms I have discussed are equated with a form of social or ganization known to cultural an thropologists as chiefdoms?societies wherein status ranking and some form of centralized authority and decision-making are integral parts of the social system. The proposition that Hohokam society was politically centralized would help to account for much of the variation seen in Ho hokam settlements and material re mains. Surely some form of central* ized decision-making was necessary for the construction, maintenance, and use of the irrigation systems, ball courts, and platform mounds. For the later period, increased centralization can also be inferred from the house remains, which indicate that whole villages were planned prior to con struction. It seems logical that the ruling lineages resided at the larger settlements where the public cere monies were conducted, and it is not coincidental that the public archi tecture, the majority of the ornate items, and the rich cremation burials are also found at these larger vil lages. Some archaeologists maintain that the Hohokam lacked complex social systems?a position based upon the use of ethnographic analogy. Because the Pirna Indians, considered by most scholars to be the descendants of the Hohokam, did not exhibit any strong tendencies toward centralization of authority at first contact, it has been argued that centralization must also have been lacking in the prehistoric Hohokam. However, by the time Europeans entered the Arizona desert in the late 1600s, the Hohokam-Pima had already suffered through several centuries of population reduction owing to the introduction of foreign diseases carried up the Mesoamerican corridors by traders and visitors. The reduced population, coupled with unstable conditions in the riverine environment, selected for subsistence practices and settlement patterns that did not require the control nec essary with canal irrigation tech niques and larger, more dense popu lations. Historic Pirna culture did not include platform mounds, ball courts, or ex tensive irrigation networks, nor did the Pirna produce any of the fine artwork for which the Hohokam are known. The ethnographic Pirna cul tural pattern would therefore not be expected to exhibit a social organi zation equal in complexity to that of the Hohokam. Yet the Pirna did have "ditch bosses" for managing the ex isting canals, they had war chiefs for organizing battle against the Apache, and they held village council meetings in large community houses. This pattern reflects only faintly the complexity of late prehistoric Ho hokam society.

Hohokam exchange systems in op eration around A.D. 1000 can be traced by raw material and artifact distributions. Different kinds of social and economic relationships seem to have been established with various non Hohokam groups. Hohokam ball courts and cremation burial in some outlying regions suggest an attempt to introduce Hohokam ceremonial and perhaps religious concepts. Statement that early historic-period Pirna social organization operated on a level of complexity similar to that of the late Hohokam Pioneer Period. It now seems apparent that large settlements such as Snaketown were also production centers where craft specialists manufactured pottery, jewelry, figurines, projectile points, carved-stone effigies, palettes, and other items. Haury's identification of a specialized pottery-making area at Snaketown and the fact that over twice as much decorated pottery is found at Snaketown as at other sites in the area suggest that it was a center for pottery production. The essential similarity of red-on-buff pottery over a wide region further suggests wide spread exchange of pottery vessels. Don Crabtree, a specialist in the production of stone tools, has repli cated the stylized Hohokam barbed projectile points and has concluded that they must have been manufac tured by craft specialists (14). The presence of quantities of residue re sulting from the manufacture of shell and other jewelry at Snaketown and the lack of these materials at other sites lends further support to the hy pothesis of specialized production centers and craft specialists. It is interesting to note that the raw materials used in the manufacture of many of these products do not occur naturally in the Gila-Salt region. The twenty-five species of marine shell used had to be brought from coastal areas, and abalone could have been obtained only from the California coast. The jet, serpentine, soapstone, argillite, and other stone materials used to produce jewelry and carved stone items, and the obsidian and chert used to manufacture blades and projectile points, were probably ob tained from the mountainous zone in central Arizona. Craft specialists could have traveled great distances, sometimes hundreds of kilometers, to obtain raw materials. Other materials could have been obtained through down-the-line or indirect trade with neighboring groups. Finished prod ucts were recirculated and may have been traded for more raw materials and other goods. 1979 September-October 551</page><page sequence="9">It is also possible that more formal ized mechanisms were developed to ensure the acquisition of favored raw materials. A study of Hohokam ball courts, which occur as far north as Flagstaff and as far east as the Ari zona-New Mexico border, might throw some lighfon trading networks. At Point of Pines in east-central Ar izona and at Wupatki in northern Arizona, ball courts in these non Hohokam puebloan sites are accom panied by shell, palettes, pottery, and cremation burial. It is possible that this Hohokam-puebloan interaction was designed to strengthen contacts with neighbors for purposes of alli ance, but securing rights to key re sources may also have been a motive. Perhaps the Hohokam traded cotton, shell, and other products for materi als not available in their homeland area (Figs. 10 and 11). Hohokam interaction with other cultural traditions, including the traffic in raw materials and finished products, did have a fairly widespread influence in the Southwestern region. Hohokam art styles, craft arts, and cremation burial are found as far east as the Mimbres valley in southwest ern New Mexico, home of the Mimbres culture, which is world fa mous for its black-on-white pottery. Early Mimbres black-on-white pot tery reflects a strong emphasis on life-form designs borrowed from the Hohokam (15). Hohokam art styles were also carried north, where they were locally interpreted in Anasazi ceramic traditions in the Flagstaff Little Colorado region of northern Arizona. It appears that highly interactive exchange and economic systems were present in the Hohokam desert homeland. Some villages may have specialized in certain products and exchanged them through a market system. Cotton requires large amounts of water to yield good har vests, as present-day Arizona resi dents are aware, and villages near the rivers probably grew cotton and manufactured textiles for trade. They could also trade crops such as corn, beans, and squash with villages in the drier desert areas for native plants to supplement their agricultural pro duce. This model is consistent with ethnographic accounts of exchange between the riverine Pirna and the desert Papago Indians of the nine teenth century (16). Centrally located large villages like Snaketown, home of the ranking lineages, appear to have served as marketplaces as well as ceremonial centers. Haury has identified an area devoid of houses near the large ball court at Snaketown that he suggests may have been used as a marketplace. The large plazas at other settlements could have served a similar func tion. The Hohokam present the ar chaeologist with the opportunity to study an important aspect of human cultural evolution. Although the ar chaeological data suggest that Ho Figure 11. Burden carriers depicted on Ho hokam red-on-buff pottery of the Colonial Period perhaps symbolize itinerant merchants who traveled throughout the Southwest and traded in raw materials, finished products, the latest in improved agricultural products, technology, and perhaps ceremonialism. This sherd is 14.5 cm high. hokam society was organized on the chiefdom level, there is little indica tion of the centralization and subse quent redistribution of goods by the ranking personages. No stockpiled goods and few specialized storage fa cilities have been found. Instead, goods appear to have been controlled by lineage or household units, as de termined by architectural analysis and by the distribution of goods found in excavated settlements. According to the classic model, chiefdoms are characterized by a centralized authority who regulates the flow of goods by acting as a re distributor. Although exhibiting all other aspects of chiefdom-level societies, the Hohokam appear to have been integrated through a mar ket system that lacked a clear verti cally structured redistributive sys tem. This interpretation aligns Ho hokam social and economic systems more closely with Mesoamerican so cieties than with other Southwestern societies, as Mesoamerican societies were traditionally integrated through market systems (17). It would seem that chiefs from the ranking lineages were primarily political agents who established schedules, resolved con flicts over water and land rights, and performed functions at village cere monials. However, the ranking lineages may also have controlled the production and exchange of exotic commodities and ritual paraphernalia as a way of maintaining political clout among their constituents. Subsistence and settlement The recognition that it was their canal technology that enabled the Hohok am to live in large settlements near arable land located miles from rivers has led Haury to conclude that the Hohokam were more politically in tegrated than the other Southwestern societies, because of their need to manage the distribution of water on such a large scale (28). Continued studies of the ancient ditches will tell us more about when they were con structed, how much water they car ried, how much land could be irri gated, and other important informa tion (19). In addition to their canal systems, other aspects of Hohokam subsistence such as dry farming sys tems and the use of native plants and animals are being investigated (20). Settlement-pattern studies have been useful in documenting a wide range of site locations within diverse envi ronments, while analysis of site en vironments has yielded clues to the kinds of subsistence practices em ployed. Continued research along these lines promises to improve our understanding of Hohokam cultural adaptation to their desert environ ment. There remains still another impor tant question that studies of Hohok am settlement and subsistence might address in the future. While I have maintained that the populations oc cupying much of southern Arizona were Hohokam in cultural affiliation, other archaeologists feel that the term Hohokam should be restricted to the archaeological remains found only in the Gila-Salt region. This position is based upon the uneven distribution of certain artifactual and architec tural forms throughout the wider 552 American Scientist, Volume 67</page><page sequence="10">desert region. The fact that platform mounds are rare, ball courts occur less frequently, and much of the ornate material culture is less common out side the Gila-Salt area suggests to some that the peripheral populations were not Hohokam but other indige nous groups who were differentially affected by interaction with the Ho hokam. However, it has recently been suggested that these regional differ ences are not necessarily cultural in origin but are due to different adap tive requirements of different drain age systems (21). It should be recognized that the ad vent of an agricultural economy did not automatically select for one adaptive option. The relationships between settlement patterns and subsistence practices may have dif fered throughout the desert area. In the Gila-Salt region, environmental conditions were such that a large, stable population could be sustained through irrigated agriculture, which in turn created more demands on the social system. In the neighboring San Pedro and Santa Cruz river valleys, canal irrigation was not as viable, while agriculture was practiced along the floodplains and also in the foot hills where rainfall could be em ployed. These agricultural strategies selected for a different settlement pattern that included numerous farmsteads located away from the main villages. The locations of the farmsteads shifted as the soil was depleted and new fields were utilized. The settlement pattern in these drainages was one of fewer large sites and many small sites. In the arid Papagueria?home of the Papago Indians in historic time?located to the south of the Gila-Salt area, where water was more scarce and less reli ance was placed upon agriculture, a two-village system was developed. During the planting and growing season, villages were located along the washes and arroyos where crops were grown, and during the winter season the populations moved up to higher elevations where water was available from springs flowing from the mountains. Neither the San Pedro-Santa Cruz nor the Papagueria settlement sys tems could support sedentary popu lations as large as those in the Gila Salt area. Due to the smaller popula tions, seasonal mobility, and lack of development of canals, there was lit tie need for political centralization. From within this perspective, we can envision how segments of the same cultural tradition can diverge through time because of the expansion into new areas where adaptive require ments were different. In general, re search has revealed that we should expect differences in adaptation throughout the desert. Documenta tion of regional variation through detailed analysis is a necessary di rection of future research if we are to understand how such differences evolved, and how these different re gional populations interacted. The dynamics of change While archaeologists have suggested a number of possible explanations for the origins and development of Ho hokam culture, two prominent themes, or positions, recur through out the literature. One envisions the Hohokam as an example of the rise of a formative-level culture out of an earlier archaic cultural pattern. This evolution involved the shift from a more mobile hunting and gathering economy to one based upon agricul ture and the successful integration of this economy into established village life. This reconstruction deemphasi zes extraneous cultural influences except for the diffusion of cultigens and pottery into the area. The late archaic Cochise period was a time of population growth and settling-in. The Pioneer Period was a further extension of the settling-in process wherein farming skills and crops were improved, and the basic tools, facilities, and handicrafts were developed. Due to the successful ad aptation of agriculture to the envi ronment, the population continued to grow, ultimately leading to the de velopment of canal irrigation in the central region. The increased stability and production stemming from canal irrigation further stimulated popu lation growth and led to the devel opment of a more complex social or ganization and ceremonial system. Increased contacts with Mesoamerica at this time would have been useful to the ruling lineages as a way of bol stering their power and stabilizing the political order. This period of dynamic growth was interrupted or thrown off course be tween A.D. 1100 and 1150, possibly by environmental changes leading to a reduced or unpredictable flow of water in the rivers. These conditions undermined the economic and polit ical systems and disrupted exchange networks, leading to a period of cul tural instability that lasted roughly a century. During this period attempts were made to reorganize the resident populations through the construction of numerous massive ceremonial platform mounds. By A.D. 1300 the situation stabilized sufficiently to encourage reunification of the irri gation systems and local polities, and once again regional exchange systems operated on a wide level. While vari ations exist, this essentially summa rizes one perspective on Hohokam cultural growth, which can be termed the "indigenous growth model." Other archaeologists, however, have attempted to explain the entire Ho hokam development sequence as a function of contacts with the higher cultures of Mesoamerica. Haury and others have accounted for the early presence of agriculture and settled village life in the Arizona desert by postulating a migration of Mesoam erican people into the region. The developing social and cultural com plexity of the A.D. 550-1100 period is further explained as a result of in creased Mesoamerican contacts with the Hohokam for purposes of eco nomic exploitation. Likewise, the rapid decline in Hohokam culture around A.D. 1100 and the disappear ance of most of the ornate material items are attributed to the severing of Mesoamerican trade routes. The ap pearance of multistoried architecture and polychrome pottery around A.D. 1300 is attributed to the collapse of the Casas Grandes trading empire located far to the south in Chihuahua, and to the subsequent movement of these people into the desert area (22). J. Charles- Kelley, one of the few scholars familiar with both northern Mexico and the southwestern United States, succinctly summarizes this perspective: Archaeologists very often see such a smooth progression of successive events in their own area of specialization that they almost automatically seek for local causes for events they interpret as local affairs. But the Southwest actually forms only the periphery of the gigantic inter action sphere of Greater Mesoamerica. Southwesterners must eventually learn that the portions of this great economic and cultural structure with which they work are indeed only minute and rela 1979 September-October 553</page><page sequence="11">tively insignificant local cultures, easily lost in the welter of similar local devel opments that make up Mesoamerica. Once one contemplates the major struc ture itself, he no longer attempts to ex plain all things in terms of local cultural ecology or cultural evolution [23]. The models of indigenous growth and Mesoamerican interaction currently represent competing belief systems which in their present form do not promote further understanding of Hohokam culture and cultural change. Just as surely as Mesoamer ican-Hohokam interaction occurred, this interaction cannot account for all the developments reflected in the Hohokam archaeological record. New perspectives must be developed to investigate the nature of the interac tion. The dating of events in northern Mexico remains uncertain, and, in deed, much of northern Mexico rep resents an archaeological terra in cognita at this time. We must ask ourselves What was the cultural context of this interaction and how did it change through time? If this interaction was economically moti vated, what did the Hohokam have to offer? Was this interaction one-way or two-way? What were the actual mechanisms of transmission? Only more specific investigations on both sides of the present international border will eventually lead to a mid dle-ground position. We should ex pect discussions of this subject to be lively for some years to come. Research into Hohokam prehistory has contributed substantially to our knowledge of the occupation of the desert areas in southern Arizona and has also encouraged archaeologists to consider many broader issues of Southwestern prehistory. The pres ence of a farming culture early in time in the Arizona desert prompts the question whether the Hohokam acted as middlemen in transferring traits such as domesticated crops and handicrafts such as weaving and pottery-making to other cultures farther to the north. One can also wonder how the relatively complex social and political systems and the widespread exchange networks found in Hohokam culture affected neigh boring traditions. Did other such so cieties exist during the prehistoric period? Can a portion of the prehis tory of the Southwest be explained by the presence of competing polities, the rise and fall of which created shifting centers of power and in fluenced the directions of interreg ional exchange? How closely were these developments tied to events in Mesoamerica? The Hohokam archaeological record reflects a long sequence of cultural change, starting from a relatively simple farming culture and devel oping into a highly interactive tradi tion. Hohokam culture is clearly suited for research into more general archaeological and anthropological issues. Why did such a dynamic soci ety develop and flourish in the most arid portion of the Southwest? What environmental and cultural condi tions influenced the direction of Ho hokam cultural growth and change? We should now be in a position to begin investigating the interrela tionships among population growth, environment, subsistence, technolo gy, and social and ceremonial orga nization in order to discover the na ture of Hohokam cultural change. Perhaps future work in the Hohokam area will assist archaeologists to un derstand the beginnings of village life and the evolution of social and eco nomic systems, as seen unencum bered by the overburden of civiliza tion.
