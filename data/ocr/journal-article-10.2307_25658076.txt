<plain_text><page sequence="1">Human Freedoms in a World of States by William T.R. Fox*** It is hard for us today to recall what an abiding faith Americans had in the gospel of peace, freedom, and progress when this society was founded 75 years ago. The Boston publisher from whom, also 75 years ago, the funds came to establish the World Peace Foundation evidently believed peace?real peace, per manent peace?was near enough at hand so that it would be prudent to make provision for another use of his money once world peace had been won. So did Andrew Carnegie a few years later when he made the founding grant for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. About the same time Jesse Macy, a president of the American Political Science Association, was writing what was meant to be a standard text in comparative government. He called it Comparative Free Government The implication of the title was obvious, that only free governments were worth studying because unfree political systems were being swept into the dustbins of history. In a similar vein just after World War I Sir Alfred Zimmern was portraying the British Common ***Bryce Professor Emeritus of the History of International Relations, Columbia University.</page><page sequence="2">73 wealth and Empire as a procession marching along toward freedom with the Old Dominions just then &lt;x&gt;ming past the reviewing stand and the more advanced colonies not far behind. For both Maty and Sir Alfred freedom was plainly the wave of the future. Things seem more complicated in 1981. Our predecessors of 1906 were naively sanguine, but they were also men of vision. How shall we describe ourselves as we ask how is freedom doing in today's world? We are more sophisticated, but what are we to say about our vision? A subject so vast as "human freedoms in a world of states" cries out for delimitation, and I propose first to narrow it by declaring some basic assumptions and making arbitrary exclusions. (1) Freedom, like security, is not a separate value but a word used to character ize the enjoyment of, or the opportunity to compete fairly for, the things valued most. Hence, we will be discussing freedoms (plural) rather than freedom in general?for example, freedom of association, freedom of speech, freedom from arbitrary arrest, etc., etc. (2) My ethic, and I assume the reader's too, is cosmopolitan. Our primary concern is with freedoms for flesh-and-blood human beings. Our concern, accord ingly, is with progress toward the freedoms the world system ought to make it possible for human beings everywhere to enjoy. We may and indeed must be concerned with autonomy for states, but in this discussion only to the extent that autonomous choice for states contributes to the protection and promotion of freedoms for people. (3) Statements about freedom are somewhat like statements about power. They do not mean very much unless they specify who is how free from whom in pursuit of what objectives and under what conditions. One such statement? never mind for the moment its truth or falsity?might be: "Foreign investors are less free than say 75 years ago to invest in developing countries with the valid expectation that the military power of their own governments might be invoked in the event of confrontation with local authorities." (4) The direct concern of this paper is not with how well the world system is coping with legitimate demands for economic justice. It may well be true that civil and political freedoms may be neither enjoyed nor assured where basic human needs for safety and subsistence are unmet. That topic, however, will be discussed elsewhere in this volume. (5) In defining the civil and political freedoms with which this paper is directly concerned there is no present need to improve on the phraseology of the U.N. Charter or of U.S. law as embodied in those provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 relating to "respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the world without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion." Under that act, foreign assistance is to be withheld where there is "a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights ... unless -" Note the linked phrase, "human rights and fundamental freedoms" (plural), and note the emphases on nondiscrimination, universality, and international rec ognition. I will return to the "unless" in a moment. (6) The bracketing, in the Foreign Assistance Act, of basic human rights and fundamental freedoms is not accidental lb be free is to be free to choose, but that freedom is properly subject to the corresponding rights of others to choose equally freely and in some cases to the performance of duties whose effect is to assure respect for and observance of such rights and freedoms when they are threatened.</page><page sequence="3">74 (7) What those internationally recognized freedoms are to which every human being is said to be entitled simply by virtue of being human and which the workings of the international system ought to guarantee is not easy to determine in a world of diverse cultures, differing social systems, grossly unequal develop ment, and unevenly changing conditions and outlooks. (8) The high-minded injunctions in the Foreign Assistance Act to which I have previously referred were directed at the behavior of governments with respect to "a consistent pattern of gross violations" of human rights and freedoms. Not only did the violations have to be recurring and gross to call for a cessation of foreign aid but they were subject to two further (and revealing) qualifications: overriding priority to "the national interest of the United States," whatever the policy makers of the moment may judge that to be, and some consideration for the needs of truly needy people who would be directly benefited if American aid were to continue to be distributed through governments whose human rights perform ance was deemed substandard. This is but one illustration of the obvious truth that no one goal, not even one so undebatably worthy as increased respect for and observance of basic human rights and fundamental freedoms, has absolute prior ity over all the others. Some of the hardest questions necessarily relate to trade offs or accommodations at the margin between national policies to promote and protect internationally recognized freedoms of individuals and national policies to promote other goals recognized as legitimate in the contemporary world system. (9) Some of the most powerful impulses for increasing respect for and observ ance of internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms come from within the most powerful states. So do some of the most powerful impulses for disrespect and nonobservance. Power is sometimes on the same side as virtue, and evil on occasion on the side of weakness. In this far from ideal world what is internationally agreed to be both good and feasible will be agreement among the unequally powerful, and will very often be significantly different from the agree ment that might have been negotiated by diplomats from equally powerful states which shared a truly cosmopolitan ethic. The distinction which the title of this essay makes between autonomy for persons and peoples and autonomy for sovereign states is fundamental. The government of a sovereign state may or may not, within the range of choice afforded to it by the workings of the international system, act effectively to protect human rights and the freedom of those within the reach of the state's power, but a people who are not free to govern themselves can only gain that freedom in a state that is free to implement the people's will. It is appropriate, therefore, to begin by discussing the ability of peoples to achieve freedom by forming self-governing states. The 20th-century state system reflects its Westphalian heritage in at least three ways that are relevant to our subject today. (1) The state-members of the system are generally free from external interference. In 1648 this meant, for example, that each prince could, so far as his fellow princes were concerned, choose the religion of his subjects. In 1981 no more than in 1648 does autonomy for a state assure any particular freedom for those living within it. (2) Nonideological al liances may be formed. In the mid-17th century Catholic France and Protestant Sweden could fight as allies to assure what a few decades later in the Peace of Utrecht would be called "the peace and liberties of Europe," not, please note, the peace and liberties of Europeans; then as now a balancing process favored the survival of states as states in a system but did little to guarantee the survival of free men as free men. (3) Nationhood is a recognized basis for statehood but has no</page><page sequence="4">75 overriding priority over historic entitlement In 1648 this opened the way for Dutch and Swiss independence. It did not until our own century provide a basis for daiming independence from the victors in a general war, but its utility for diminishing the power base of the vanquished has long been evident. By the first decade of this century the Europe of divine-right kings was long gone, and the era of divine right of peoples had begun. In this era of popular sovereignty, as in the old era of dynastic sovereignty, the principle of freedom from external interference, at least so far as it applied to advanced states of the Euro peanized world, was generally accepted. The principle of permanent sovereignty, the overriding claim of historic entitlement, a claim which encompassed the European homeland, the fruits of past aggressions in Europe (if any), and over seas possessions, some of them very recently acquired, was, however, another matter. National self-determination was in the early 20th century a rallying cry for a variety of demands to redraw the map of Europe and to dismember or reconstruct polyglot empires, including some of worldwide dimensions. If there was still wide acceptance of the "mission civilisatrice,,, rendered in English as the "white man's burden," the burden was coming to be seen as temporary. We have President McKinley's word that God, while telling rrim that the United States should take the Philippines and uplift them and educate them and Chris tianize them, also told him that the United States should set them free. We know that Woodrow Wilson's Governor-General for the Philippines rapidly transferred responsibilities to Filipino administrators. And we also know that Franklin Roosevelt promised independence by a date certain, 10 years from July 4,1936, and the promise was kept. Article 22 of the League Covenant echoes the paternalistic justification for temporary tutelage. Mandates were to be created for states "not yet able to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world." Their welfare and development were declared "a sacred trust of civilization," ie., of the signato ries to the Covenant, and the mandatory power had among other things to guarantee freedom of conscience and religion and prohibit the slave trade. It is hard to see how a legal obligation to the inhabitants of the ex-possessions of the defeated enemy could be wider than the moral obligation to the inhabitants of colonies and dependent areas remaining under the sovereignty of the World War I victors. Parenthetically, we should note that the U.N. Charter in an article dealing with trusteeship (Article 73) speaks more circumspectly of "sacred trust," without the Covenant's reference to "civilization" and its implication that the mandatory power is part of civilization and the mandated areas part of barbarism. The Charter is also more circumspect in the form which the implied promise of ultimate sovereign equality takes. The trust territories are described as having "not yet attained a full measure of self-government," but there is nothing about the candidate for sovereignty having to be judged "able to stand alone." The Charter in Article 78, dealing with nonself-governing territories of all kinds, in cluding the colonies and possessions over which the victors in World War II continued to exercise full sovereignty, calls for "respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms"; it thus strengthens the presumptions that for these terri tories as for the trust territories unequal treatment is temporary and that the inhabitants of dependent areas should in due course have fundamental freedoms comparable to those of inhabitants of the metropolitan country itself. Let us return for a moment to Sir Alfred Zimmern's evocative vision of an Empire and Commonwealth stately procession marching along toward freedoms, and let us further assume what we do not know to be really true, that Sir Alfred's</page><page sequence="5">76 vision was shared generally by the statesmen of the far-flung empires of the interwar period The freedoms they had in mind were no doubt freedoms for peoples and persons, but sovereign equality (or, alternatively, equal status in some kind of Levesquian "sovereignty association") was the status in which these human freedoms were to be enjoyed. Constitutional freedom, ie., self-government, would come when the colonial power was satisfied that human freedom would be respected. What was implicit was the Kantian expectation that "they" would henceforth behave so much like "us" that the need would be small for interna tional action to correct consistent patterns of gross violations of internationally recognized standards with respect to basic human rights and fundamental freedoms. Americans did not disagree, but with their traditionally anticolonial perspec tives they were almost as suspicious as the Russians that the imperial power might be slow to grant independence and be slow for unworthy reasons. American suspicions seemed to be confirmed when they found during World War II that British views toward the future of the colonial world, and especially Britain's share of that world, were at some variance with their own. The Australian histo rian, W. K. Hancock (now Sir Keith Hancock), argued eloquently that the colonial power had the responsibility of staying on until a constitutional compact had been negotiated which would assure the rights of all ethnic and other minorities in the about-to-be independent country. The notion that we know what they would want if they had the knowledge and judgment and responsibility which we, at least for the moment, happen to have is still pervasive. It has given many in the advanced countries who happen to have had in their own hands the levers of power and influence the confidence to dispense measured and sometimes homeopathic doses of autonomy to the previously nonself-governing peoples. Europeans and Americans have been alike in exhibiting what I call the "like us" syndrome. Both have believed that we have freedom, know what it is, and will be able to tell what kind of progress they are making toward it. Soviet ideologists, incidentally, also exhibit a "like-us" syndrome, though it is a different "us" and a very different freedom. They, we have believed, want freedom, want to get where we already are, and, most of us formerly believed, were moving or being moved inexorably toward it. Where U.S. policy diverged from that of the old colonial powers of Europe was in the matter of promising independence by a certain date no matter what the prospects then for human freedoms in the new state. Time tables were anathema to those who asserted the metropolitan power's responsibil ity to stay on until certain tests of suitability for sovereign equality could be satisfied. The "tests vs. timetables" argument was overtaken by events, and the long-run consequences of the European and American differences have not been great. The principle of national self-determination had by World War II been rather fully applied in Europe and in overseas settlement colonies of European culture. The 20th century brought independence to Norway, Eire, and Iceland in Western Europe, to the belt of succession states in Eastern Europe stretching from Finland to Turkey, and to the Old Dominions in the British Commonwealth. The Class A mandates formed out of the non-Turkish parts of the Turkish Empire gained their independence just before and after World War II. Then, the flood gates of independence burst open?most importantly with the British withdrawal from the Indian Subcontinent. Tests and timetables alike were almost forgotten. The great scramble for colonies in the fourth quarter of the 19th century had as its sequel 75 years later a great scramble to get rid of them. Until near the very end</page><page sequence="6">77 some, like the Belgians and the Portuguese, may have been reluctant to leave, but once they decided to go, they moved quickly. In Angola the Portuguese did not even bother to choose among the three contending factions as to whom to hand over authority. The final act is being played out in Southern Africa?Zimbabwe just yesterday, Namibia today, perhaps in South Africa itself tomorrow. The "like-us" syndrome may have led many in the West to imagine that the advanced countries had escaped the burden of imperial responsibility when they yielded the mantle of authority to indigenous governing elites. The relative af fluence of the United States and Western Europe and their relatively high degree of public safety had masked the extent to which civil and political freedoms on the two sides of the Atlantic depended, for both their maintenance and enjoyment, upon the maintenance of at least minimum standards of personal security and subsistence. The recognition has grown only quite slowly that, as Henry Shue has argued, civil and political freedoms, social and economic welfare, and security against both internal and external threats to life and liberty depend in significant measure on each other?to put the matter more simply, that freedom from oppres sion, freedom from hunger, and freedom from fear all go together. The assumption that they want to be like us?evident in our continued ten dency to use words like "development," "modernization," "growth," and "take off"?suggests an insensitivity to the traditional values of each of the widely varying non-Western cultures and perhaps to the way persons in each culture judge how free they are to have the things that they do in fact want, things not necessarily the same as we (or the Russians) assume that they ought to want. lb introduce the notions of cultural heterogeneity and cultural relativism into a discussion of universal human rights and freedoms in a world of sovereign states is to point to the enormous intellectual task that lies ahead. If "they," the "back ward" peoples, did in fact aspire only to become as much like us as conditions would permit, there would be no need to reconcile differences in value systems as they relate to priorities among not wholly compatible freedoms. Nor in a world of absolute cultural relativism and wholly autonomous sovereignties would there be any impulse to search for common ground. In fact, increasing sensitivity to and acceptance of the need to establish firmly and on a universal basis certain human rights and freedoms, the reality of both cultural heterogeneity and interdepen dence among peoples (and especially interdependence in West-South relations), and the triumph in much of the Third World of the vocabulary of socialism combine to make the elaboration of universally applicable transcultural norms for evaluating the state of freedom both urgent and perplexing. In our almost universal recognition that every people ought to be free to have its own political institutions, we reflect one such transcultural norm, but even here there is a problem. How do we know "a people" when we see one, and what we ought to make the judgment? "People," as C. Wilfred Jenks has reminded us, is "a collective plural of indeterminate content." The question may not have seemed urgent when the struggle for national self-determination was being car ried on mostly in Europe, a continent on which most people knew or thought they knew which groups of human beings were the nations from which states were to be formed. Ironically, the question of how one knows a people when one sees it did not seem to matter much while the great European empires were being rapidly dismantled. Not nationhood but a set of boundaries drawn for the convenience of colonial administrations defined the "people" to whom independence was being granted (or, perhaps in the case of some prospective dissatisfied minorities, upon whom it was being thrust). The nation, in contrast to the situations prevailing in,</page><page sequence="7">78 say, Poland in 1919 or Ireland in 1921, had in most of the new post-World War II states yet to be built. The nation had to be built on the basis not of a real but only a hypothetical social contract between the new rulers of the new state and a nation that would only learn that it was a nation as social mobilization proceeded. The map of today's Africa with its 50-odd sovereignly equal states corresponds, so far as I know, to no one's expectations or demands, African or non-African, when the post-World War II process of decolonization was in its early stages, lb raise now the question of boundary changes or changes in the roster of sovereign African states would be to open a Pandora's box. For the foreseeable future this is not going to be the route by which fundamental freedoms are to be promoted, protected, and enjoyed in the newly sovereign less developed countries of the world, and it may not be very significant anywhere else in the world either. lb say that we must take as largely given the sovereignty map of the world is not just to say that the very recent episodes of creating new sovereignties en masse is over. It has been true for centuries that the sovereignty of states once admitted into the society of nations is only rarely permanently extinguished on an involuntary basis. Thus, Poland and Austria have been resurrected, and the three tiny Baltic states absorbed by the Soviet Union are among the few modern exceptions that prove the rule of state longevity. Great aggressors have not, so far at least, conquered the world; and when they are beaten back, conquered states may regain their freedom. Vested interest of the rulers, the perquisites of political and bureaucratic power, promote state survival from within at the same time that the balancing process promotes it from without. But what if it is true, as it is, that modern states, like self-winding clocks, just keep on running? This says nothing about the capacity of a state to keep on performing, or for that matter ever to perform, the services which provide the moral justification for its continuing to exist. If, for example, a regime is so much the prisoner of its struggle to survive that it offers its people nothing but oppression and grinding poverty, the survival of the state has no meaning for those concerned with states as instruments for promoting the rights and freedoms of that portion of the human race committed to its care. With the survival question recast in these terms the 20th-century record of the ability of states to become free and to stay free in ways that promote human freedoms is at best spotty. The absolute right of whatever state happens to have become a state and whatever regime happens to be in power to remain in power when there is a consistent pattern of gross violations of human freedoms would be impossible to defend, but more about that later. What kinds of assurance does the international system offer against external interference to states whose governments are responsive to and protective of the wishes of their governed? If anarchy among states posed the same kind of threat to states as Hobbes would have us believe anarchy among human beings poses to individuals, the life of both freedom-loving and despotic states would be as vile, nasty, brutish and short as it is for men and women in the Hobbesian state of nature. States are not, however, anthropomorphic monsters, and they are widely enough distributed across the face of the earth so that it is hard for them to coerce each other. Central authority is less needed among states than among men, every thing else being equal, simply to maintain order. It would also be more burden some than among men. Given the variety of cultures and of geographic circum stances, the less that is decided centrally the better the cause of freedom is served. We can be confident that institutions of the global system are not soon likely to be strong enough to interfere with freedom-loving and freedom-promoting good</page><page sequence="8">79 states in their performance of their good works; but by the same token, we must accept the probability that they are not soon likely to be strong enough to give sustained and reliable protection to these good states against those who would interfere either from without or from within. Assurance on a worldwide basis of basic human rights and fundamental freedoms is also assurance of unfreedom to violate or deny those rights and freedoms. Is there a contradiction between, on the one hand, restraints on freedom resulting from generally enforced limitations on state autonomy and antisocial behavior and, on the other hand, the respect for cultural diversity, local decision making, and personal choice which these standards are supposed to assure? The general rule that in the exercise of any particular freedom no one has a claim-right that is not generalizable, Le., that is not equally available to everyone else in the same set of circumstances, leaves ample leeway for diversity and decentralized choice. Fortunately also, the government which is conforming to some widely respected standards of freedom-promoting behavior can hardly be less likely to get help from outside and if anything is more likely to get such help when it is threatened, than a government which by common consent is thought to be violat ing them. The key phrase in all this is, of course, "widely respected standards of freedom-promoting behavior." Bridging social systems and cultural differences by elaborating transcultural norms that are widely respected and by building consen sus so that they are widely supported are tasks in whose performance the transna tional community of international lawyers plays an indispensable role. Any discussion of freedom must be a discussion of the freedom to be different. It would be incomplete if it did not recognize that from any of the many non Western and Third World perspectives it is we of the affluent West who appear to be "different" and to demand more of one kind of freedom than some non-West erners think we ought to have. Just as we in the West are learning to respect the wishes, if they exist, of non-Western peoples not to be like us, it is startling to hear from an Indian scholar that the world needs "to build ethical and institutional safeguards against... unrestrained expansionism and self-indulgence." His refer ence to the absence of an ethic of consumption in the affluent West carries the implication that we rather than they are the deviants who cause the problems. Reference to the rate at which the West is drawing down the whole world's supply of nonrenewable fossile fuels and mineral resources would have given added point to the remarks about lack of an ethic of consumption. It is, of course, as appropriate to ask about the particular ways in which the West's uniqueness threatens non-Western freedoms or imposes on affluent West ern countries special responsibilities to promote those freedoms as it is for people in the West to ask which practices in the non-Western world are sufficiently threatening to basic human rights and fundamental freedoms as to warrant the use of sticks or carrots or persuasive powers to reduce or eliminate threats. One contention, already noted, is that the North Atlantic realm of affluence and com paratively efficient government has desensitized those concerned with civil and political freedoms to the corequisite freedoms which are so firmly established among peoples on the two sides of the North Atlantic that they are not seen as part of the freedom problem. Certainly the proclamation of human rights dealing with freedoms from oppressive government has enjoyed wider support in a coun try such as the United States than those declarations dealing with economic and social rights. Such inattentiveness as there may be among the "haves" to freedom-restraining social and economic conditions among the "have-nots" may be due to a general failure to distinguish between questions about the need for a</page><page sequence="9">80 certain level of freedom from hunger and fear if there is to be an environment in which civil and political freedoms flourish, and the far thornier questions of in ternational distributive justice. And the widespread use of the language of social ism by those who call for a higher priority for economic and social rights casts the debate over those rights in an ideological framework not at all conducive to consensus about universal rights and freedoms. Discovering the precise extent to which the "haves" ought to be permitted to keep the fruits of a superior capacity for capital formation, a fortunate ratio of population to resources, past predatory activities sanctified by the passage of time, inventiveness which keeps them on the leading edge of technological ad vance, and prudent and efficiently administered public policies, or any combina tion of the above, is an exercise which is not a wholly different exercise from one dealing with the conditions for establishing basic human rights and freedoms on a firmer basis. Identifying what if any are the corequisites of civil and political freedoms is, however, central to our task. Perhaps in terms which have become fashionable in the Washington of 1981 we should be asking whether the provision of "a safety net for the world's needy" by such income transfers as compassion may dictate is or is not sufficient to meet the responsibilities of the affluent for establishing conditions under which the observance of universal standards of civil and political freedoms may be promoted and protected in the hungry countries. And if it is true that donor strings on income transfers may be pulled to promote such freedoms, how does one choose between the claims of today's needy and those who want to see their yoke of oppression lifted tomorrow? Lack of sufficient knowledge of and respect for non-Western cultural traditions and the values of non-Western peoples associated with those traditions can make some Western efforts to make "them" more like "us" a threat to, rather than a support for, individual rights and freedoms. There was general bewilderment in the West at the violent rejection of the Western development model by influential Shiite clergy in Ayatollah Khomeini's Iran. This rejection of Western ways is, however, only a particularly dramatic example of the freedom-destroying social disorganization which is a consequence of technological hubris and segmented modernization. The modernizers failed to calculate the by-product effects on hu man freedoms of single-minded concentration on Western-style economic growth. To make matters more difficult for the cause of universal civil and political freedoms, unsought by-product effects of segmented technological transfer are not all due to insensitivity to or disrespect for traditional cultures and values. While Third World birth rates are now plummeting downward, the very consider able time lag between the effective spread of the technology of death control and the spread of social attitudes and personal practices appropriate to dramatically lowered death rates has left a legacy in the form of many hundreds of millions of human beings already born who will by the end of this decade be entering the labor market and compounding the political problems of fragile Third World gov ernments. Already unable to cope with the unemployed and underemployed who are now swelling the populations of their large cities, leaders in many underdevel oped countries are unlikely to find that it will soon become easier for them to strengthen civil and political freedoms. I have deliberately drawn a sobering picture of the prospects for civil and political freedoms in a Third World many of the governments of which are preoc cupied with their own survival and have not the corequisites of such freedoms, and may be washed away by a tidal wave of hungry, unemployed protesters. An equally, if not even more sobering picture could be drawn of the state of civil and</page><page sequence="10">81 political freedoms in the Communist countries of the world As the case of the Poland of 1981 demonstrates, the struggle to establish civil and political freedoms against the will of despotic authorities can be helped to some extent from the outside but there is no substitute for battlers within the unfree system itself. Any discussion of the resources of the international system for enforcing an internationally recognized standard of behavior runs up against a fundamental difficulty. Intervention has a bad name. It is associated with what is sometimes called "informal imperialism" involving the threat or use of force to uphold stan dards of protection of life, liberty, and property for foreign nationals in semicolo nial countries, standards which had been generated in the so-called advanced countries. The United States, though short on colonies in the age of overseas empires, was long on informal imperialism. Intervention was an instrument of the strong to make the weak toe the line. It ceased to be useful when the political interests that divide the strong came to have a higher priority than the particular economic interest which in the days of dollar diplomacy might have seemed to justify military intervention. It is not now and never was useful for making the strong conform to some international standard of behavior. Between the strong and the strong it was war, diplomacy, or nothing. There is an elemental core of transcultural consensus which countenances force ful action when an Idi Amin or an Emperor Bokassa or an Anastasio Somoza flagrantly misbehaves over a protracted period. No tears would be shed for a new Dracula if a socially responsible neighbor were to collaborate in his downfall and if Dracula happened to be the ruler of a relatively weak state. Moving against Stalin and Hitler for their purges and their inhumane actions against kulaks and Jews was another matter. The affluent West tried to do business with both until very late in the day. Given the OAS Charter, the Helsinki agreements, the prohibitions in Article 2 of the U.N. Charter, and a variety of other international agreements, the scope for legal armed intervention is very narrow indeed. On the other hand, any reasonable reading of international agreements regarding human rights, fundamental freedoms, nondiscrimination, genocide, slavery, minority rights, and so forth ex pands greatly the range of internal affairs subject to international scrutiny and corrective action. Like the celebrated "gap" in the Covenant with respect to the resort to war there appears to be a substantial gap between legally permitted measures of enforcing international standards and the expectations for enforce ment implied by international agreements reflecting these standards. How has the use of interventionary force been related to the cause of human freedoms in recent years? One could argue that external interference in the affairs of Amin's Uganda and Bokassa's Central African Empire strengthened the cause of human rights however much one may deplore the resort to force involved in each case. The brilliant success of the Israeli raid on the Entebbe airport and the spectacular failure of the U.S. helicopter rescue mission in Iran are not convin cingly criticized as undermining the cause of freedom, though the latter at least may be criticized on other grounds. Without either praising or condemning the way force was used, one might say that such use of interventionary force in the last acts of the decolonization process?in Goa, Timor, Angola, Rhodesia, and Na mibia?is an almost completed episode in contemporary history that will have little effect on future progress toward universal respect for and observance of human freedoms. It does not seem useful to discuss the military incursions of Israel and its neighbors into each other's territory in a rights and freedoms context. The same can be said of the interventions by great powers in the internal</page><page sequence="11">82 affairs of nearby smaller powers?the Soviet Union in Hungary and Czechoslova kia, the United States in the Dominican Republic, and the People's Republic of China in Vietnam; however they may have affected the freedoms of the peoples in the four countries, they are not most usefully discussed in terms of their impact on basic human rights and fundamental freedoms. It is not just by incremental steps toward worldwide guarantee of human freedoms that this class of events is likely to be eliminated even though its elimination would be a gigantic step toward an improved environment for freedoms. With Poland in 1980-81 threatened over a period of months by overt military intervention and subjected to military maneuvers by Soviet forces within its borders meant to chill that environment, we must note that the influence seems the other way. The mass-based struggle to establish freedoms has made the inter vener at least hesitate and perhaps back away entirely. The Polish case also reminds us that the line between interference and noninterference by one state in another's internal affairs is a thin one. How are we to account for the disappear ance of old-style military intervention by the affluent and strong for economic or "denial of justice" reasons? One factor has already been mentioned: intense com petition among the strong makes the friendship of a friendly (or sometimes a servile) regime in a weaker country of the Third World more valuable than the economic interest which intervention would protect. A second may be the network of international agreements which explicitly limit the right of interven tion and thereby increase its international political cost and in freedom-loving countries often increase its domestic political cost. A third may be the raised consciousness of the Group of 77 and the nonaligned nations; this also Raises the political costs for the intervener. A fourth may be its divisive effect on domestic politics of the intervening country. A fifth, in the nuclear era, may be a fear that in the era of bipolar competition, local intervention might not stay local. A sixth may be that military intervention seems to have worked poorly as a way of protecting economic interests in many if not most cases, whereas economic pres sures and inducements have yielded better results. This last point requires further comment. Johan Galtung would afford the United States no moral credit whatever for having turned away in the past half century from the use of U.S. Marines as an instrument of foreign economic policy. He uses the term "structural violence" to describe core-area behavior in unequal economic relationships between developed and developing countries, between core and periphery. Canadians may be surprised tp learn that he cites the 49th parallel as a boundary of structural violence. "The 49th parallel," he writes, "is a border of peace only for hi who is satisfied with a very narrow peace concept." He goes on to speak darkly of "the invisible continent of nonterritorial actors," the IGOs, the INGOs, but most of all the BINGOs, ie., business international nongovernmental organizations. No complicity by government and no evil intention by anybody is needed for structural violence to impair the just rights and opportunities of the disadvantageously situated. It is hard to see what kind of shift in public policy by the powerful Galtung would prescribe to promote the rights and freedoms of the victims of structural violence. I forebear from saying how unhelpful a diagnosis is which concentrates on assertedly inequitable economic effects. It makes both means and motives almost irrelevant by erasing the line between military coer cion and the deployment of wealth in an unequal economic relationship and more importantly, the line between the deliberate action of a strong government and the unhindered expression of the profit motive. More interesting is Franz Schurmann's description in his Logic of World Power</page><page sequence="12">83 of American imperialism as Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal on a world scale. Like Charles Beard who a generation ago saw America's troubles resulting from the country's being infected with a sense of world mission, Schurmann argues that the taste for managing everything in sight, acquired by New Dealers as govern ment expanded first during the New Deal and then during World War II, led in the postwar years to a hubristic effort to be not merely the world's policeman but also the world's manager of economic development, social reform, and so forth. One need not accept the Schurmann thesis to agree that U.S. economic and military aid as well as that of several other large and developed countries has given governments in developed countries some, I emphasize some, influence on the policy choices of governments in the aided countries. The correlation has not, however, been close between the expected and the actual consequences of aid. Human rights and fundamental freedoms have had to compete with, among other things, bipolar competition, humanitarian relief, the quest for accelerated economic development, and domestic pressures for military sales and for the reduction of agricultural surpluses in the formulation of aid policy. Controversy has been constant as to how high a price in "rights and freedoms" terms the United States dares charge, given the multiple national goals and sectoral in terests that aid is expected to promote. The matter is complicated and will not be resolved by simplistic assertions about overriding national interest and the greater effectiveness of "quiet diplomacy and nuanced pressure" any more than by claiming top priority for the cause of rights and freedoms considerations in every circumstance. That diplomacy should be quiet and pressures moderated so that they will better serve the cause of fundamental freedoms, and that long-run freedom goals ought not to be allowed to get in the way of high priority urgent foreign policy goals are two very different propositions, and coming months should show which is the operative proposition in the Reagan administration when a choice between them is necessary. The leverage offered the promoters of human freedom by the possibility of granting or withholding aid is sometimes significant but often limited. It may be becoming smaller. As international discussions have come to be more in terms of "income transfer" and less in terms of "aid," the gradual legitimation of transfer as a matter of right, and therefore of economic justice rather than charity as the criterion of sufficiency, probably makes it harder to put strings on aid in the name of civil and political rights and freedoms. So probably would any substantial effort to meet demands for a New International Economic Order if that new order were to create a structural change in the world economy that would largely obviate the need for assistance programs except to the poorest of the poor. So far as the very poor countries are concerned, they are the very countries in which for humanitarian reasons the urgent requirements of subsistence would make it un feasible in any case to shut off relief measures. The case is only slightly different with military assistance. Except where its object is to buy a regime's friendship and is not really military at all, opportunities for promoting freedoms by turning the spigot of military aid on and off will be smalL Big governments of big, affluent Western countries are finding it very difficult when they wish to use coercive, persuasive, and economic power to promote human freedoms for all the reasons cited; the illiterate, hungry, and intimidated little people in authoritarian countries are nearly powerless to help themselves. (I am not for the moment speaking about Eastern Europe where as in Poland today the stirrings of demands for civil and political freedoms are a source of wonder and admiration.)</page><page sequence="13">84 Beginning with the Second Hague Peace Conference the underdeveloped non European countries have played a large and increasing role in world conferences and international organization. Mahatma Gandhi demonstrated that the downtrodden had constituencies in the advanced countries to which to appeal when his negotiations with India's imperial masters became difficult. It was, of course, British and American opinion that he was able to mobilize and not Ger man or Russian opinion. With Hitler gone, there are persons of goodwill, intelli gence, and sometimes relevant technical skills throughout the whole of the af fluent West who can be enlisted in the cause of freedom whether or not their governments are taking the lead. Furthermore, Third World leaders in and out of government are finding ways of identifying and meeting with each other and legitimating their causes in each other's eyes, at the seat of the United Nations, and in the public prints. Their countries and their persons are objects of dignity in the world. Their voices are more and more heard with respect, and the terms on which resources will be transferred to the developing countries are, as we have already said, negotiated more and more in terms of justice and less and less in terms of charity. The large forums, the UNCTADs and the Groups of 77 and the regional blocs, may be more important for consciousness-raising than anything else, but they open the way for serious bargaining in smaller group negotiations and on specific issues. UNCTAD cannot do what the World Bank can do, but it can capture the world's and the World Bank's attention, and at the very minimum can force a damage-limiting strategy on the representatives of the affluent. We are told that the world system is a violence system and that with such a large share of the guns in the hands of the presently powerful the downtrodden cannot help themselves. Yet, in a longer view, in what James Eayrs has called the three-quarter-century-long struggle between the sledgehammer and the walnut, the walnut has been winning the struggles. Mugabe in Zimbabwe is a fitting follower in the footsteps of Juarez, Aguinaldo, Sun Yat-sen, Gandhi, Nehru, Nyerere and Kenyatta. One-party government and military rule are everywhere to be seen, but the mold of oppression having been broken once can be broken as many times as necessary. In the cracks and fissures of discontented regimes, there are forces for freedom to be supported and in the consciences of the presently free there are the motives for doing so. It is not just in Poland that restive forces are pressing for human freedoms. The cause of civil and political freedoms will continue to find it hard to compete for attention with a variety of other causes, and reconciling the requirements of freedom with those advanced in the name of security or development or even of some crass and narrow interests will continue to be difficult, but that is one of the reasons why a society of disinterested and high-minded lawyers is so important in defining both the tasks and the opportunities. Having uttered these pious and optimistic but I hope not unrealistic senti ments, let me now look quickly at the'record. We see a changing patchwork of protection of human rights and civil and political freedoms. Some kinds of law and order seem less firmly established than 75 years ago, the kinds that protect foreign investment, and in the case of the well-run colonies of yesterday, the efficient protection of such freedoms as the distant authority may have chosen to recognize. Sovereign equality has opened many doors even as it has created expectations that are not yet fulfilled. Where oppressive regimes have come to power, however, they are rarely so stable that the oppressor can indefinitely delay his downfall.</page><page sequence="14">85 Often insensitive but sometimes sensitive native elites have replaced often insen sitive but sometimes sensitive colonial rulers. In the larger cause of freedom there have been big failures and small successes. Our century has been one of unimaginably brutal and massive assaults on human dignity, made worse, if possible, by obscene efforts to escape individual responsi bility by pleading "superior orders." The Holocaust was only the worst of the mass killings. The communal riots in India and Pakistan at the time of partition of the Subcontinent, the Katyn massacre, the grisly Mylai incident and the wan ton strategy of defoliation, the wholesale destruction of human life after the fall of Sukarno, the administrative failure which underlay the Bengal famine, the so called "holocaust of neglect" in Ethiopia and the Sahel, the blighting of human aspirations in China's Cultural Revolution, the purges and the labor camps and the killing of the kulaks in the Soviet Union, and the pitiful plight of the boat people and of the less noticed refugees in the Horn of Africa by no means exhaust the litany of horrors. There are small successes too. Brezhnev's Soviet Union is not Stalin's, and suspected dissidents are not seized in the dark of the night. The Brazil of 1981 is not the Brazil of a decade ago, and both mysterious disappearance and torture seem to be on the wane. Even the Argentine government, caught in the spotlight partly by the human-rights policies of the Carter administration, seems to be striving to regain respectability by moderating some of its most oppressive prac tices. There is a functioning commission on human rights in Europe whose exist ence may have made the government in London more cautious in its methods of bringing order to Northern Ireland. Under the watchful eye of its critics around the world who pay the United States the compliment of holding it to a higher standard in protecting and promoting human rights than its major competitor, and one suspects, in some cases than their own countries, the United States pays a high price for its own shortcomings in the protection of fundamental freedoms. If the effect of the law-creating activities of leading jurists is to give the critics more ammunition with which to shoot at the American target, so much the better. The greater the pressure on the United States to be scrupulous in protection of fundamental freedoms at home the more important its standard-setting function for the world, the stronger its negotiating position as it moves to promote freedoms abroad, and the clearer its representatives ought to be as to what they ought to be negotiating toward. One last word. Pacifism is said to be like fertilizer, not much good unless spread evenly all over. The case is different with respect to basic human rights and fundamental freedoms. The process of elaborating standards whose maintenance the operations of the international system ought to guarantee for every human being is continuous, and each government that lives up to the standards can be an exemplar for all the rest. In our time the road toward wider and wider observance of universal human rights and protection of basic freedoms may not be via en forcement, with the accent on "force," but rather by parallel action in the moral, legal, and political systems of our expanding group of enlightened countries. Remarks by Tom J. Farer* Professor Farer commented that he was not sure that such a vast topic as human freedoms in a world of states permitted one to write a coherent essay, Distinguished Professor, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey School of Law, Camden; Chairman, Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.</page><page sequence="15">86 rather than to assemble a bundle of loosely related thoughts. The very enormity of the topic reminded one of the quotation from Yeats, "Things fall apart, the center cannot hold, mere anarchy is loosed upon the world." Where there was no clear standard of relevance, everything could be made to appear relevant. For Professor Farer, the inevitable thread which passed through Professor Fox's presentation was a question. How had the fragmentation of the colonial empires and the consequent proliferation of new states affected human freedom? Professor Farer felt that Professor Fox might have considered in greater detail the question of why this liberation process occurred in the first place, and how had contemporary participants and observers envisioned the results of this process. Some of those observers who could be described as "good-natured" liberals tended to assume that ideals played an important role in producing decoloniza tion. They tended as well to imagine happy endings in which lovable old retainers of dusky hue, having learned the blessings of democracy and due process, em ployed them to enhance the dignity of their fellow ex-colonials. Liberals had a plausible basis for believing that decolonization would have humane consequences. Racism and material self-interest had prevented the met ropolitan powers from treating the colonial peoples as authentic equals within a single political framework. The more democratic the metropole, the less likely it was to extend equality, because its electors would not tolerate a significant dilu tion of their own electoral power. Nor would they tolerate wealth transfers which promised to yield problematical and only very long-term benefits to them. As a result, the metropolitan power by its very nature could never satisfy the growing demands of the colonial constituencies and therefore it could not rule without growing coercion and the progressive diminution of colonial freedoms, such as they were. Moreover, both popular sentiment in European states and the solidarity and homogeneity of the ruling states' elites precluded even the ablest of the colonial people from aspiring to high office, even in situations, e.g., Portugal and France, where the colony and the metropole were theoretically integrated. In sum, practical liberal theorists foresaw at least two moral gains from decol onization. One was liberty of access to positions of ultimate power for the ablest of the colonial population. A second was that less coercion would be required to maintain the structure of power. Liberals tended, however, to overlook or excessively discount several circum stances which haunt us today. First, in many cases the new governing elites would have less perceived legitimacy and effective power than the colonial governors they replaced. Second, in practically every case, the absence of a dynamic and extensive private sector, and the disparity between public and private sector income, would by themselves invest political competition with a terrible ferocity. Third, the colonial power provided a pernicious model and framework for govern ment. Even where parliaments were established on the eve of independence or a few assimilated locals sat in the metropolitan parliament, the lived reality was that these were conquered territories governed from the top down in which the governors lived beyond the average man's wildest dreams of avarice. In short, the model was profoundly undemocratic and inegalitarian. This framework into which the new local elite stepped perpetuated the old order. As Rene Dumont pointed out in his disillusioned study of Africa, a member of the Upper Volta parliament just after independence was paid at the same rate as his French counterpart, thereby making more in one month than the ordinary peasant could gain in 20 years of hard labor, if he lived that long. Fourth, the colonial powers had, in most cases, played on tribal and cultural</page><page sequence="16">87 antagonisms in perpetuating their rule. The divisions were worse in some cases at the end of the colonial period than those that had preceded colonial conquest. A frightened insecure elite, probably elected on a tribal base, habituated to respect models of life and governance hostile to a sharing of essential goods and of power, was not a recipe for the promotion of liberty. Conservatives and cynics may have been much more realistic. It took an able and practical intellect, although not a memorable one, to recognize by the late 1940s that old-style colonization had ceased to pay for itself. Admittedly not everyone saw this. At the Brazzaville Conference of 1944, where the French government called together representatives of her various colonies, a resolution was unanimously adopted saying that France's mission in Africa was nowhere near its conclusion and indeed its conclusion could not then be foreseen. Yet, indigenous elites were beginning to demand more than the metropole could yield, or more than it found worthwhile yidding. For the diminished states of Western Europe, stripped of global ambitions, colonies had lost their strategic value and the growing economic value could be sustained without bearing the costs of direct control What would be lost by the transfer of power? The new governments would remain dependent on the West for protection and capital and know-how, and in most cases the elite dasses would have more in common with their old oppressors than with the peasant masses. The culture of material greed was universal. Professor Farer asked, were the cynics wrong? Within the confines of this messy topic, was there any issue more speculative, both to empirical research and orderly speculation, than the extent to which the operation of contemporary Western diplomacy, and the capitalist institutions centered in the West, affected and influenced the struggle for more open and just sodeties in the Third World? In Latin America, for example, whole strategies of sodal and political organiza tion during the past 20 years had been premised on the collaboration of Western capital with governments which imposed stability by liquidating populist political movements, immobilizing the trade union movement and concentrating wealth. In Brazil during the decade after the 1964 coup, the top 10 percent of the popula tion increased its share of the national income from 39 percent to 50 percent. The absence of liberty of assodation in countries like Brazil and South Korea probably helped to increase the competitiveness of their exports to the detriment of indus tries and workers in the United States. The absence of liberty in the Third World, in other words, has had practical consequences for Western economies; for that reason, if for no other, human rights might not be a mere indulgence. Suppressing trade union activity and controlling wage rates by fiat were forms of export subsidies, but ones overlooked by the countervailing tariff laws of the United States. Professor Farer believed they were overlooked as well by those who, like Professor Fox, insisted on the spedous distinction between security interests and concern for human rights. Professor Farer explained that he men tioned this hidden export subsidy as only one example in which conventional reasons of state intermingled with humanitarian concerns in pervasive and subtle ways. Western strategists had for decades voiced fear of the appeals of a)mmunism and more recently they had wailed hysterically at the comparable organizing power of Islamic fundamentalism. In other words, the most cynical among Ameri ca's governing classes conceded the importance of ideas or ideology in the strug gle for power. And yet when one concerned with human rights urged action that</page><page sequence="17">88 would reaffirm the value aspect of our own system, he was accused by these same people of "softheadedness." This, for Professor Farer, was clinical schizophrenia Of course ideas were powerful instruments for subverting the enemy's forces and marshaling one's own. The Polish workers were plainly not motivated simply by the desire for more meat. A recent poll taken in Poland indicated that the workers were driven by an authentic, personally experienced passion for indus trial democracy, indeed for a liberty in some respects more profound than the kind practiced in the United States. Perhaps it was this confusion about the relationship between moral and strate gic concerns which led Professor Fox to say a passing good word about "quiet diplomacy." Too open and aggressive advocacy of human rights, including its liberty dimension, would frighten those who saw altruism and self-interest in hopeless conflict. Professor Farer stated that however much he might object to this viewpoint, such objections were trivial compared to his difficulty with the supposed virtues of quiet diplomacy. Moreover, Professor Farer was not sure quiet diplomacy meant anything. Clearly it did not mean telling thugs privately that unless they took certain ameliorative steps they would find themselves sub ject to an array of sanctions. Rather, it was always offered as an alternative to concrete measures. What no one ever bothered to suggest was on what theory of human causation should quiet diplomacy succeed. The only possible theory was that dictators and pretorian guards were on the whole stupid. They used far more heinous methods than their purposes required so they needed a little quiet advice from their friends. So advised, they would eliminate the gratuitous thumbscrews. Professor Farer believed this unlikely to occur. The unfortunate truth was that the most thuggish governments were not gratuitously sadistic. They appreciated better than their quiet advisors from abroad how to cap the volcanos they governed. Because they were prudent, they might throw their soft-spoken foreign friends a bone or two out of the thousands they had collected. For what was a bone or two if they kept the voices soft and capital and weapons flowing into the hands of the enemies of liberty? Open and frank criticism by a still great and prestigious power, even when backed by the thin carrots and fragile sticks fretfully employed by the last ad ministration, carried weight because human rights had become a vital ideology, and those exposed for violating them suffered in their own countries a frightening loss of legitimacy. This was why they profoundly preferred an administration which professed an adherence to a policy of quiet diplomacy.</page></plain_text>
