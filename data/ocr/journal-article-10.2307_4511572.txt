<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vol. 40, No. 2 Recent Literature [177 84. Extinct and Vanishing Birds of the World. James C. Greenway, Jr. 1967. Dover, N. Y. 520 pp. $3.50 paperback.-Since Dover reprints only "classics" it seems safe to say that "Greenway", as the book is called, has become classic in less than a decade since its original publication in 1958. The reprint has a short new preface, some added notes throughout, and additional references at the end. For those who missed it the first time around, the book has a brief explanation of species and subspecies concepts and an introduction that acts as a summary as well (lists birds that are extinct, probably extinct, known only from bones, hypothetical, have small populations, and are rare but in no immediate danger). After this follows the section of the geography of extinction, with empha- sis on specialized insular forms, and then the species accounts of extinct and vanishing birds. There is a fine bibliography and an appendix of museums in which specimens of the extinct forms are located. The index does not come last between the covers, since Dover partakes of its usual annoying habit of putting several pages of ads for books after the last page of the index. The new preface sums up changes between 1954 (when the original manu- script was completed) and 1967. Six birds thought to be extinct have been found again (Eskimo Curlew, Australian Scrub-bird, Eyrean Grass-wren of Australia plus three subspecies of flourishing species). One species (Huia of New Zealand) and four subspecies bit the dust in the intervening years. I suppose that is as good as we can hope for.-Jack P. Hailman. 85. Birds of the Atlantic Ocean. Paintings by Keith Shackleton and text by Ted Stokes. 1968. Macmillan, N. Y. 156 pp. $12.95.-Those of us who love seabirds welcome any new volume. It is no accident in this one that the artist is listed first on the title page, for it is best considered a book of illustrations with an accompanying text. Fifteen oil paintings of single species and 23 plates of drawings in gouache illustrate the penguins, albatrosses, petrels, shearwaters, storm petrels, tropic birds, pelicans, gannets and boobies, cormorants, frigate- birds, phalaropes, skuas, gulls, terns, skimmers, alcids and other birds of the entire Atlantic Ocean. The illustrations are good, and for the most part quite accurate (although I have never encountered a Franklin's Gull having a yellow tip to its red beak- and I've examined hundreds of specimens). The drawings are of the type we have become accustomed to in field guides and handbooks, with more attention given to accuracy than artistic setting; I like these better than the full oils of single species. (This is no field guide, however; it measures nearly a foot square). There is no cross-reference from text to illustrations, which is occasionally annoying. If one turns to page 142, which begins the text on skimmers, he finds a full color plate of alcids on the opposite page, with a diagram of the plate on the text page; the next page ends the text on skimmers, but still no pictures of skimmers! The sharp-eyed reader will remember the oil of the black skimmer on p. 139, but is unlikely to recall the head of the African skimmer in the lower left corner of the plate of terns back on page 135! The accompanying material consists of a description and a range map for each species. As is to be expected, the maps leave something to be desired. The Laughing Gull's range in the Pacific part of the map is entirely omitted (whereas the Franklin's Gull is shown in the Pacific on the adjacent map). Some maps (e. g., Arctic Skua, Fairy Prior, Shy Albatross) have strange, unexplained gray arrows protruding from the range shading. The Magnificent Frigatebird's illus- trated range does not go north of Florida (I've seen the species in North Carolina), whereas the Brown Pelican is shown going to Nova Scotia! The breeding range of the latter species is shown only as far north as Georgia, yet Brown Pelicans breed in North Carolina. The Olivaceous Cormorant is shown breeding throughout the Gulf of Mexico, across the whole peninsula of Florida, and throughout the Caribbean, including the Bahamas. Surely, it breeds only as far north as the southern tip of Texas! And as far as I can determine, this species is not even seen east of western Louisiana. When does an inaccuracy become an outright mistake? The text, written by a Commander retired from the British Navy, is certainly the weakest aspect of the book. He says frankly "I have never seen many of the birds featured in this book." However, first-hand familiarity is not necessary for clear exposition. We are told that the Laughing Gull lays "from April to July, depending on the latitude of the colony." How does the egg date depend</page><page sequence="2">] 7Q] Notes and News Bird-Banding 178Nts n]Nw April, 1969 upon latitude? The author apparently has little familiarity with evolutionary theory, and his ignorance makes him antagonistic. We find such statements as "to make up to the twenty-five recognised species of Atlantic gull (sic), the original ancestral stock did not exceed more than about four recognisable super species." If Stokes really does understand what a superspecies is, he fails to enlighten the reader. And does he understand what a species is? "The ways of scientists are indeed difficult for the mere layman to understand." Birds sometimes look the same and are called different species "yet no one doubts that (the north European man and the pigmy) are merely race variations of the species H. sapiens." If you like anthropomorphic descriptions of birds, attend to the Herring Gull which "is one of the most evil scoundels of all birds . . . Nothing is too despicable for the Herring Gull." And some of the writing is simply poor: "The name [of the Adelie Penguin] is derived from Madam Adelie Durville, after whom the bird was originally named." It is unfortunate that the illustrator, Shackleton, did not write the text, for his preface is the most literate of its kind I have read: "A fickle task-master, the ocean has guided a trend of evolution for those who live off her bounty, with scope enough to make the flightless penguin equally as successful an animal as the long-winged albatross." And the masterful Shackleton sums up for us his subjects: "They bewitch us and humiliate us with their unassuming mastery of wind, water and whereabouts. They provide inspiration and example for mariners and aeronauts alike, but that is not all. Since man first ventured into their domain they have offered the solace of live company and visual delight where their need is greatest." Buy this book, read Shackleton's preface, marvel at his illustrations, but forget the text.-Jack P. Hailman. 86. Wildfowl 19. G. V. T. Mathews and M. A. Ogilvie. 1968. Wildfowl Trust, Slimbridge, Gloucestershire, England. 172 pp. $2.50 paperback-Wild- fowl 19 is the continuation of the old Wildfowl Trust Annual Reports, which went 18 volumes. The new issue contains 18 papers (some of which are noted elsewhere: see reviews 8, 16, 36, 38, 45, 46), an editorial, some miscellaneous reports, and the annual report of the Trust. It is an attractive volume (the cover painting and drawings by Peter Scott help greatly), and yet a scientific one too. It contains magnificent photographs. Some of the contributions lack summaries, an omission that is tantamount to criminal in the modern age of information explosion. And lest Americans get confused, "wildfowl" means only ducks, geese and swans, not all wild fowl. The new publishing concept is a good one, and we shall await Wildfowl 20 with anticipation.-Jack P. Hailman. NOTES AND NEWS The Bowdoin Scientific Station (Kent Island, Grand Manan, New Brunswick, Canada) offers facilities for research, on colonial sea-birds in particular. Visitors not planning research are welcome, if space permits. Inquiries may be addressed to the Director, Prof. Charles E. Huntington, Dept. of Biology, Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Me. 0401 1. NEBBA dates to bear in mind: a spring field meeting on June 21 and 22, 1969, in Litchfield County, Conn. (centered at the White Memorial Foundation); the annual meeting on November 8th, again at Drumlin Farm in Lincoln, Mass. NEBBA now has 18 types of mist nets in stock, including tethered types, corresponding to all standard types except type B. The quantities in stock vary greatly. While NEBBA makes immediate shipment on over 99% of all orders, we regret that we cannot guarantee immediate shipment across the board. In- quiries or orders should be directed to: Mr. E. A.
