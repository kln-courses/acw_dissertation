      <p>The past decade has seen an increasing number of Mesoamericanists relying on the concept of shamanism for their interpretations of artworks created prior to the Spanish conquest. Whether these scholars are anthropologists, archaeologists, art historians, or trained in Latin American studies or the history of religions, all have drawn heavily on social scientific literature in the form of ethnohistories and ethnographic reports. It is our position that many of these writers, regardless of their disciplinary base, are using shamanism to provide predictable, easy, and ultimately inadequate answers to what are often very complex questions about the relationship of art to religion, medicine, and politics in preHispanic Mesoamerica.</p>
      <p>Without wishing to diminish the important contributions of some of the work on shamanism and art, we contend that many of those who have related the concept of shamanism to preconquest Mesoamerican artworks have avoided the demands of scholarly rigor. Although the evidence that shamanism is reflected in these art objects is at times surprisingly scanty, it is sometimes used to support broad claims for shamanisms role in the understanding of Mesoamerican art. Moreover, many of these studies proceed in an uncritical manner. In particular, scholars writing about Mesoamerican art in relation to the concept of shamanism invariably fail to examine the historical origins and viability of the vocabulary and models they have chosen to use. They neither provide adequate etic criteria for identifying a person as a shamancriteria that have crosscultural (including transatlantic and transpacific) validitynor fully disclose what is currently known about those specific individuals roles. In particular, the internal rankings and factions within and among specific groups of religiousmedical practitioners, like the economic and political aspects of their performance, are typically played down in studies of Mesoamerican art if they are mentioned at all. The result is a seductive but also reductive and lopsided portrayal of Mesoamerican art as an essentially spiritual affair.</p>
      <p>For us the spiritual, as something largely separate from the mundane political and economic spheres, is, like shamanism, a vague Western category whose utility in analyses of Mesoamerican art is seldom defined, justified via crosscultural comparison, or compared with indigenous, emic notions of religiosity. When it takes center stage it is usually at the expense of a historical perspective. The resulting highly romantic image of Mesoamerican religion and the art it supposedly inspired plays directly not only to uncritical lay readers but also, as others have pointed out, to selfserving nationalist and commercial interests both within and outside of Latin America (Joralemon 1990; Kehoe 1994, 1996, 1999; Fikes 1996).</p>
      <p>We suggest that the representation of Mesoamerican artworks as products or reflections of a mastery of the spiritual has been so appealing because it reinforces the notion of the ahistorical, apolitical, irrational Other that was initially constructed during the conquest and colonization of the Americas. While the function of this othering process in colonial times is relatively well understood, its appeal for scholars working today has not received much attention. We argue that the problem originated in an idealist aversion to materialist and political explanations of human behavior and to the complexities and dynamics of human history. This aversion has long characterized both the field of humanistic anthropology and the humanities and has been particularly endemic in the disciplines of art history and the history of religions. Many scholars are attracted to the study of art, as to the study of religion, precisely because its making, use, and meaning have traditionally been characterized in the West as matters of ideation rather than of the material world.</p>
      <p>In what follows we will provide evidence that this avoidance of secular, material explanations of art has been a reaction to several controversial theoretical schools and methodologies that gained academic prominence at various times in the course of the 20th century, among them diffusionism, cultural evolutionism, cultural materialism, the New Archaeology, and social and Marxist art history. Each of these approaches has, in its time, provoked serious intellectual debate and even division among scholars regarding the relative importance of idealist versus materialist explanations of human behavior, including the making of art. Whereas materialists have been inclined to acknowledge social change and cultural difference in Mesoamerican art history, idealists have tended to see ideas, especially religious beliefs, as determinants of artistic choice and to emphasize broad, even universal, and longlasting human behavioral and cognitive similarities. Although the sharp dichotomy between materialism and idealism has in recent days yielded in some quarters to more complex and less totalizing theoretical models, we find that most scholars who interpret Mesoamerican art in terms of shamanism still appear to come to the subject from an essentially idealist perspective.</p>
      <p>Since we see the history of art as first and foremost historicalthat is, as dynamic, competitive, and contextualwe begin with a look at when, where, and, in our opinion, why shamanism first began to play a significant role in Mesoamerican art studies. We then examine the sources and validity of the principal criteria used by Mesoamericanists to identify shamanism in works of art. A look at some possible but largely acknowledged reasons for shamanisms popularity among scholars of Mesoamerican art will follow. We conclude with some recommendations for what we hope may be a more responsible way of analyzing the interface between art, religion, medicine, and politics in this part of the Western Hemisphere and elsewhere.</p>

         <title>Shamanisms Entry into Mesoamerican Art Studies</title>
         <p>The concept of shamanism was introduced into studies of Mesoamerican art at a moment of methodological crisis in academia in the mid1960s. By that time, preColumbian art had come to be taught in departments of art history rather than in departments of anthropology, where it had previously been housed. In the early 1960s there were two schools in the United States that offered a doctorate in preColumbian art history: Yale University and Columbia University. These two programs trod very different paths. The founder and beacon of preColumbian art studies at Yale was George Kubler, whose approach was historicist, formalist, and, later on, semiotic; Kubler never evinced any interest in shamanism. At Columbia, in contrast, preColumbian art history was primarily taught by the primitivist Douglas Fraser, who had become an ardent devotee of diffusionism. In Frasers (1962, 1966) hands diffusionism aimed to identify and explain, on the basis of presumed ancient transpacific maritime contacts, the formal resemblances among Asian, Pacific Island, and Latin American images.</p>
         <p>Diffusionism had enjoyed considerable popularity among U.S. anthropologists and archaeologists since the late 19th century, when it arose in reaction to both the notion of multiple independent inventions and the Enlightenment view of human history as evolutionary and progressive (Trigger 1989:99100, 15051). It had come to Frasers attention through the works of Asianists like Robert HeineGeldern (1959; HeineGeldern and Ekholm 1951), who claimed Southeast Asian origins for certain Mesoamerican and South American art forms, and a growing number of social scientists in the United States. Among the latter was the Mesoamerican archaeologist and museum curator Gordon Ekholm, who occasionally taught courses on preColumbian art in Frasers department at Columbia. Ekholms (1953, 1964) argument in favor of Han Chinese influences on Teotihuacan cylinder tripods, among other presumed artistic evidence of transpacific contact, exemplifies the tendency at the time to cite formal resemblance among manmade objects and imagesmany of which we classify as works of artas evidence of diffusion.</p>
         <sec id="sc1.1">
            <title>The Seminal Writings of Peter Furst</title>
            <p>By the mid1960s, however, diffusionism had come under increasingly scathing reproach from social scientists, historians, and art historians, and Frasers own confidence in this approach was severely shaken. It was precisely at this time that Fraser became aware of the work of the U.S. cultural anthropologist Peter Furst, who had begun interpreting Mesoamerican artworks in terms of the concept of shamanism. Fursts interpretations inspired Fraser to turn away from diffusionist explanations of art in favor of interpretations based on shamanism, which seemed to provide a more plausible (not to mention more academically acceptable) explanation of the similarities among certain Asian, Pacific, and New World art forms. According to this model, the shared beliefs and practices represented by these visual resemblances date back to a socalled archaic substratum of shamanic beliefs and practices.</p>
            <p>Frasers attention was specifically called to an article by Furst that had been published in 1965 in the periodical <italic>Antropolgica</italic>. The topic, West Mexican Tomb Sculpture as Evidence for Shamanism in Prehispanic Mesoamerica, was derived from the research for his doctoral dissertation (P. Furst 1966), which he would submit the next year. The article identified a group of West Mexican ceramic figurines, believed to have come from deep shaft tombs constructed in Colima, Jalisco, and Nayarit during the 1st millennium <sc>b.c.</sc>, as effigies of shamans who served as tomb guardians (fig. 1). Furst compared the leftturning postures and horned headdresses of some of the male figurines, who appear ready to strike an invisible enemy with their raised club, with Late Chou and Han period Chinese tombguardian statues, some of which likewise display a weapon. He related the West Mexican figures curious headdresses to the use of animal horns to signify the supernatural powers of shamans among hunters and gatherers throughout the world and their sinistral orientation to the widespread Jungian association of the left side with danger and evil (1965:4767).<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg1" position="float" seq="1">

            </p>
            <p>Furst (1965:29) offered this interpretation as a correction to previous identifications of the West Mexican tomb figurines as warriors and to the widely held position of the time that West Mexican tomb ceramics in general were essentially secular and anecdotal, free of supernatural overtones. In the conclusion to his article, Furst (p. 73) called for greater attention to comparative religion as a means to unravel the deeper meaning that underlies the overt archaeological data. His idealist leanings emerged in his declaration that the traditional view of ancient West Mexicans as free from the domination of religion was, in his words, sheer nonsense.</p>
            <p>Fursts desire to position himself in the idealist camp must be seen in the context of contemporary developments within the social sciences. He was writing at a time when his own discipline was seeing the reemergence of neoevolutionary thought, some of which was directly influenced by Marxs writings. At the same time, archaeologists had begun to espouse what would become known as the New Archaeology, which focused on materialistusually ecological and economicexplanations of culture change. In ironic contrast to Marx and Engelss understanding that culture can and does influence human history (Doy 198:2829), this new breed of materialists ruled out ideas and religious beliefs, including their manifestations in works of art, as active forces in social change. Indeed, they dismissed them, in the parlance of the day, as epiphenomenal. The implication of thisthat the study of art and culture in general was a comparatively unimportant enterpriseunderstandably raised the hackles of all good idealists, including most preColumbian art historians.</p>
            <p>According to Gordon Willey and Jeremy Sabloff (1980:184), one of the factors that brought about these intellectual changes was a more scientific approach in the social sciences and some of the humanities. A probable second factor was the change in political climate in the United States (Willey and Sabloff 1980:184). According to these writers, it was common in the postwar 1940s and 1950s for the spectre of Marxism to be raised by the antievolutionists in the heat of argument. Thus, a scholars stand on the importance of ideas, including religious beliefs, in understanding human behavior and cultural patterns not only spoke, at the time, to the theoretical place he chose to occupy within his discipline but also implied an antimaterialist if not antiMarxist position.</p>
            <p>Fursts stand against the rise of materialist sentiment in the social sciences was even more clearly stated in his second study of Mesoamerican artworks, which he published in 1968. This time he relied heavily on ethnographic reports of nonagricultural peoples living in South America to interpret a group of largely unprovenienced, late1stmillennium<sc>b.c</sc>. Olmec male figurines with partially feline features as shamans in the process of transforming into their jaguar familiars, or alter egos (fig. 2). In the concluding paragraph of this study, Furst (1968:170) took direct aim at what he termed the scientific world view, to which, in his view, we are all captive. The scientific paradigm, he complained, makes it difficult to reach meaningfully into the metaphysical, esoteric areas of the pastor, for that matter, the present. Could it be, Furst (1976:155) asked in a later essay, that ideological factors played a more significant role than putative environmental limitations?<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg2" position="float" seq="2">

            <p>Among the ethnographers who influenced Fursts thinking was the Austrian Gerardo ReichelDolmatoff (e.g., 1961), who had demonstrated considerable interest in the impact of shamanism on the art of certain remote groups living in Colombia, where he himself lived from 1937 until his death in 1994. In 1973 ReichelDolmatoff began to make annual visits to the United States to teach and work with graduate students in the anthropology department at the University of California, Los Angeles (Sanmiguel 1994:290), which by that time had become home to a number of humanist anthropologists who shared ReichelDolmatoffs interest in shamanism.2 Furst came to know him well and later, together with his wife Jill Furst (1981), wrote an enthusiastic review of three of ReichelDolmatoffs books about South American shamanism. Although ReichelDolmatoff (1976) often strove to elucidate the relation between art and religion, on the one hand, and ecology, on the other, the Fursts (1981:262) praised him instead for showing that ideas are important and are capable, like faith, of moving mountains. His work served, in their view, as a welcome antidote to the current lack of attention to ideology and religion, which they attributed to a secular and highly technologized society fascinated with economics, innovation, change, specialization, energy input and output, and what has come to be known in social science jargon as adaptive strategies. The term adaptive strategies alluded to the New Archaeologys view that cultures are ecologically adaptive systems, that is, shaped by mans physical responses to his environment (Trigger 1989:278).</p>

                  <p>Among these humanist anthropologists were Fursts former dissertation adviser, Johannes Wilbert, who worked with Warao shamans, the Moche art specialist Christopher Donnan, and then fellow graduate students Douglas Sharon, Alana CordyCollins, and Carlos Castaneda. In 1968 Castaneda launched a controversial career with the publication of his wildly popular <italic>The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge</italic>. The book, which was based on his dissertation, was later accused of being highly fictionalized (De Mille 1976, 1990).</p>
                  <p>Not everyone at UCLA was enthusiastic about the new model, however. In 1978 Cecelia Klein, a former student of Frasers and by then a member of the faculty in the Department of Art, Design, and Art History (now the Department of Art History), delivered a paper entitled Shamanitis: A PreColumbian Art Historical Disease. (It was not until afterward that a physician pointed out that shamanitis, in medical terms, means inflammation of the shaman.) Together with Josephine Volpe, the authors of the present article have since written another paper with that same title (Klein et al. n.d.).</p>

            <title>Mircea Eliade and The Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy</title>
            <p>The work that provided the broad intellectual framework for Fursts thinking about shamanism and art, however, was written not by a social scientist but by a historian of religion. The text was Mircea Eliades <italic>Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy</italic>, which was initially published in France in 1951 and appeared in English translation in 1964. By that time, Eliade, a Romanian migr, had become the chair of the department of the history of religions at the University of Chicago and was widely recognized as a leading thinker on the topic of comparative religion.3</p>
            <p>Because the practice of shamanism was best documented for 17th through 19thcentury Siberia, Eliade defined it in largely Siberian terms; it is from the Siberian Tungus that the word shaman (<italic>saman</italic>) derives. He argued (1964 [1951]:45) that what differentiated the shaman from other magicoreligious specialists was the practice of entering a state of ecstasy, or emotional intensity, which typically took the form of trance. It was in this altered state that the shaman was able to engage and control supernatural beings directly. He also discussed a wide range of archaic beliefs and practices that he saw as being present in many, if not all, societies practicing shamanism. These included such features as animal familiars or helpers and access to the upper and lower worlds via a Cosmic Pillar, World Tree, or Cosmic Mountain marking the <italic>axis mundi</italic>. All of these features represented, in his view, remnants of a substratum of primitive religious beliefs and techniques (1964 [1951]:6) dating back to the first migrations of peoples from Northeast Asia into the New World.</p>
            <p>As Alice Kehoe (1996:383) has pointed out, it does not seem to have bothered Eliade that the data he used to define his archaic substratum largely came from ethnological reports of modern peoples. Nor did Eliade confront the possibility that many of the similarities he perceived between Northeast Asia and the Americas might reflect recent, welldocumented 17th and 18thcentury contacts between Siberia and northwestern America (Kehoe 1996:38182). Those who subscribed to his views seem to have had no problem with these facts, either. In 1976 Furst (1976:156) articulated his own belief in an archaic substratum of huntergatherer Weltanschauung that extended from PaleoMesolithic Asia across the Americas. The German word <italic>Weltanschauung</italic>, worldview, implies that sometimes very disparate peoples, regardless of time and place, can be justifiably classified together by virtue of the way they see the world. To many scholars working in the late 1960s and early 70s, as today, Eliades emphasis on the workings of the universal mind to explain formal resemblance had tremendous appeal.4</p>
            <p>The notion of an archaic shamanic substratum was predicated on the notion of extraordinary cultural continuity over a long period of time, which implied that certain (usually primitive) peoples have long been highly conservative by nature. The pejorative effects of portraying Third and Fourth World peoples as essentially timeless and conservative have been pointed out by numerous critics of anthropologys collusion with Western colonialist and neocolonialist enterprises (Fabian 1983, Hobsbawm and Ranger 1983). Suffice it to say here that although shamanism seemed to some to represent a historical explanation of current cultural semblance, Eliades argument was anything but historical. Eliade, in fact, was intent on evading history as commonly defined (Allen 1998:211). He wrote frequently on such topics as the difficulties of historicism and the terror of history and argued that archaic peoples had no real sense of history because for them time was endlessly recycled rather than linear and progressive (Eliade 1959<italic>a</italic> [1949]). Moreover, Eliade never grounded his brand of shamanism in the specific socioeconomic realities and political pressures of the peoples he discussed. In his work shamanism seemed to float above the mundane needs, interests, and socioeconomic interactions of the people below.</p>
            <p>Sam Gill (1998:319) has recently shown that Eliades general disregard for history directly affected the way that he built his arguments, for which he drew upon multiple chronologically disparate and often contradictory sources without acknowledging that his account was a creative pastiche.5 Unfortunately, the failure to treat sources as historical documents, to check those sources sources, and to determine their credibility, as Gloria Flaherty (1992:208, 15) has noted, has been characteristic of scholars writing about shamanism. The reason offered by Flaherty speaks to some of the same questionable premises mentioned above and sheds light on the ways that shamanism helps to other the cultures that allegedly practice it. In Flahertys (1992:15) words, Shamanism has not been deemed a subject worthy of history because it has often been viewed as existing only in cultures the West believed antedated by its own invention of history.</p>

         <title>Problems with Definitions and Criteria</title>
         <p>The problem should not, however, be understood to stem solely from the work of Eliade. The ambiguous, malleable nature of the word shamanism, which had become popular by the end of the 18th century, was lamented as far back as 1903 by the distinguished sociologist Arnold van Gennep (2001 [1903]:51), who described it as a strange abuse of language. Van Gennep complained, We have inherited a certain number of very vague terms, which can be applied to anything, or even to nothing; some were created by travelers and then thoughtlessly adopted by the dilettantes of ethnopsychology, and used any which way. The most dangerous of these vague words is <italic>shamanism</italic>.</p>
         <p>Little progress has been made since van Gennep wrote. As Flaherty (1992:6) has put it, the word shaman has come to mean many things to many people. Eleanor Ott (1995:245) recently complained that the term shamanism can be easily slipped on, in her words, like a secondhand sweater, even when there may be no justification for it. All of these writers imply that scholars often use the word mindlessly, either without bothering to define it or without subjecting their definition to critical examination.</p>
         <sec id="sc2.1">
            <title>Problems with Eliades Model</title>
            <p>Since the concept of shamanism entered Mesoamerican art studies through the writings of Eliade and Furst, it is important to look carefully at the validity of their definitions and criteria for recognizing it. Eliade (1964 [1951]:35) was aware of the slippery nature of the concept of the shaman and, as we have seen, tried to produce a precise and workable definition of the concept. However, he clearly failed. For example, the notion of trance, which Eliade (pp. 45, 8) heralded as the definitive hallmark of shamanism, has come under scholarly attack for its imprecision.6 As mentioned above, Eliade (p. 5) believed that trance was a form of ecstasy proper to shamans, who specifically employed it to confront the supernatural in the otherworld. The word trance, however, generally refers only to an altered, somnolent state. As Roberte Hamayon (1993), who studies Siberian shamanism, points out, trance tells us nothing about what the shaman is actually doing and cannot, in any case, be empirically verified. Moreover, Eliade (1964 [1951]:5) himself noted that adherents of other religions employ forms of trance. Indeed, a principal duty of highranking Zapotec and Aztec priests was to enter into a trancelike state in order to consult directly with the gods (Townsend 1992:194; Burga 1989:276).</p>
            <p>Michael Winkelman (1990:309, 311, 313, 325; 1992; 2000), who has conducted the only systematic crosscultural comparison of magicoreligious practices, finds trance to be present not only among those whom he identifies as shamans but among those whom he distinguishes as shaman/healers, healers, and mediums as well.7 Winkelman (1990:311) concludes that, as Eliade had intimated, professed altered states are common to magicoreligious training and healing in all societies and at all levels. We must also wonder how meaningful our Western notion of trance would be to Mixe shamans in southern Mexico, who reportedly do not differentiate between the dreaming and the waking state (Lipp 1991:153). Indeed, Hamayon (1993:7) notes that shamanistic societies do not make use of native terms homologous to trance' and do not refer to a change of state to designate the shamans ritual action. She concludes from this that it even seems that the very notion of trance is irrelevant for them. When asked whether the shaman is or is not in trance, they are for the most part unable to answer. Moreover, some individuals considered by scholars to be shamans, such as the <italic>tangol</italic> in southwestern Korea, never enter a trance or experience ecstasy (Keith Howard, cited by Keightley 1998:771 n. 28).8</p>

                  <p>For Winkelman one of the few features that distinguish shamans from other kinds of religious practitioners is their association with nomadic hunting and gathering societies. In a 1982 article based on a paper delivered at Skidmore College in 1975, Esther Pasztory, a former student of Fraser and now professor of preColumbian art at Columbia University, pointed out that monumental and technically complicated art is invariably absent among hunters and gatherers. Ironically, as Pasztory (2001:18) complains in a recent essay, some Mesoamericanists have cited parts of her article as evidence that shamanism influenced certain monumental and refined works of art in more complex societies.</p>

                  <p>The only personal traits that Winkelman sees as distinguishing shamans from other religious personnel are shamanic soulflight and personal charisma (cf. Lewis 1981). Both of these, however, occur outside the boundaries of shamanism (Kehoe 1996:378; Eliade 1964 [1951]:481). The same may be said of the socalled divine mandate (Kehoe 1994:5; 1996:378; Rose 1970:2629). In any event, the position of shaman is inherited from a parent or grandparent in many Mesoamerican societies.</p>

            <title>Fursts Criteria for Shamanism in the Americas</title>
            <p>Furst quickly realized that Eliades criteria for identifying a person as a shaman did not always match the portrait of the typical American curer.9 As Kehoe (1999:45) has noted, ReichelDolmatoffs archetypal shaman in Colombia had little in common with the classic Siberian shaman described by Eliade. The hallucinatory plants reportedly so fundamental to South American shamanism, for example, are of little or no importance for the Tungus, and narcotics, according to Eliade (1964 [1951]:401), arrived in that region only recently. Since Furst saw the use of hallucinogens to achieve a shamanic state of ecstasy as being considerably more important in the Americas, he reordered and modified Eliades criteria for shamanism to fit the New World data (Anzures y Bolao 1987:29).</p>
            <p>Furst (1976) published his list of criteria in an article titled Shamanistic Survivals in Mesoamerican Religion. Rather than focus on shamanic techniques, as Eliade had, Furst prioritized certain cosmological features, such as a tiered universe joined at the center by a World Mountain or World Tree, surmounted by a bird, marking the <italic>axis mundi</italic>. He also included among these criteria an animistic environment in which a lifelike force is intrinsic to natural objects and elements, the importance of hallucinogenic plants, and a fundamental emphasis on transformation, especially humananimal transformation. Eliade had cited none of these factors as being universal among or unique to shamanistic societies.</p>

                  <p>William Madsen (1955:4849) had already observed that, in Mesoamerica at least, Eliades (1964 [1951]:84) criterion for a shaman as one who has direct communication with supernaturals through dreams, visions, or spirit possession is too broad, since it can apply to laymen and witches as well as curers.</p>

            <title>Problems with Fursts Model</title>
            <p>Despite Fursts attempt to redefine shamanism in terms of specifically American religious beliefs and practices, the new criteria he produced have proved to be as unreliable as Eliades. The latter repeatedly insisted that the concepts of a universe divided horizontally into an upper world, a terrestrial middle world, and an underworld, the three tiers penetrated by a World Tree or Mountain, were virtually universal and predated the rise of shamanism (Eliade 1958:3; 1964 [1951]:3, 7, 37, n. 6, 264, 26674, 492). After all, Christians also recognize a threetiered cosmos, and animism has long been known to characterize many smallscale societies, whether or not they have shamans. In the Americas, the use of hallucinogens is not restricted to or required by all of the individuals who have been labeled as shamans. Among the Mixe, as among the Jvaro of Ecuador, for example, hallucinogenic plants are available to all, and everyone knows how to use them (Lipp 1991:188; Harner 1972:154). In fact, most Mixe practitioners make no professional use of these plants, and when they do it is their patients, not they, who ingest them (Lipp 1991:14950). In Peru today, curers who use a brew containing the hallucinogenic San Pedro cactus to effect an altered state often share the concoction with their patients (Sharon 1978:37, 45, 47).</p>
            <p>Furst, in short, redefined shamanism in terms of traits that other scholars, including Eliade, had shown to be too general or too variable in distribution to be identified exclusively with it. Nonetheless, most Mesoamericanists trying to explain preColumbian art in terms of shamanism have drawn on Fursts criteria rather than Eliades as evidence of the shamans presence. In doing so, moreover, they typically have focused on only one or several of Fursts criteria, usually failing to mention whether any of the others are also present. The criterion these writers most commonly citethe ability to make direct contact with the supernatural by means of ecstasyis, as we have seen, highly problematic.</p>

            <title>The Shamanic Universe</title>
            <p>Fursts emphasis on cosmological beliefs as diagnostics of shamanism has remained entrenched in preColumbian art studies to the point of becoming virtually reified in recent years. <italic>Maya Cosmos:</italic>

               </italic> 
               <italic>Years on the Shamans Path</italic> (Freidel, Schele, and Parker 1993) epitomizes this tendency to associate a particular cosmology with shamanism. By the time of the books publication, the torch for shamanistic explanations of Mesoamerican art had passed to the Mayanists, and in particular to David Freidel and Linda Schele. Schele had started out as a painter but subsequently earned her doctorate in Latin American studies at the University of Texas, Austin, and later taught in the art history department there. Freidel, an anthropologist who frequently collaborated with Schele, teaches at Southern Methodist University. According to the personal note from the authors at the beginning of <italic>Maya Cosmos</italic>, it was Freidel who had interested Schele and Parker in shamanism (Freidel, Schele, and Parker 1993:12). He had become fascinated with the subject during his student days after reading Eliades book on shamanism, which convinced him that shamanism is a very old, coherent, and broadly diffused mental paradigm.</p>
            <p>By the time that Freidel and Schele began to publish on shamanism in Maya art, the New Archaeology, with its materialist emphasis on ecological adaptation and political competition, had gained a firm foothold in Mesoamericanparticularly Mayanarchaeology. Moreover, beginning in the 1970s, social and cultural anthropologists had had to confront a theoretical bogeyman of their own: cultural materialism. As articulated by its primary advocate, Marvin Harris (1979:ix), cultural materialism was based on the simple premise that human social life is a response to the practical problems of earthly existence. As did the New Archaeology, it aimed for a scientific way of understanding human society and identified material processes as determinant. Although Harris rejected the historical and dialectical materialism of Marx and Engels, his acknowledgment of the overall importance of Marxs theories of social evolution caused many humanists, as well as social scientists, to shudder (pp. ixx).</p>
            <p>Freidels reaction to these new developments was clearly articulated at length in a 1981 article titled Civilization as a State of Mind: The Cultural Evolution of the Lowland Maya. Freidel argued, on the basis of what was known at the time about the pClassic Maya, that culture was an independent causal factor in the rise of civilization and the state. His position was that social relations, subsistence practices, and technology (proposed prime movers in cultural ecological explanations) exist and affect society only as they are symbolically constituted within the shared reality of that society (p. 189) and that the material expressions of religion and ideology are far from being epiphenomenal (p. 191).</p>
            <p>Schele similarly rejected the evolutionist, materialist premises of the increasingly numerous New Archaeologists working in the Maya area, speaking out strongly at several professional conferences against what she called their Marxist approach. But Schele was also battling a related dragon from within her own discipline, for what had come to be known as social and Marxist art history had begun to make its presence felt in Mesoamerican studies. In their rebuttal to Cecelia Kleins (1988) criticism of their catalog (1986) for the exhibition Blood of Kings, Schele and Mary Ellen Miller (1988) rejected as a Western, Marxist presumption Kleins contention that elite masterpieces tell us little aboutand may indeed distort our understanding ofMaya commoners. In its stead, Schele and Miller argued that Maya art and the messages encoded in it were engaged with Maya society at all levels. This view was declared to be <italic>the</italic> fundamental issue in <italic>Maya Cosmos</italic>, where Freidel, Schele, and Parker (1993:48) expressed their concern that if this great spiritual chasm between [Maya] elite and commoner existed, then the great artistic and intellectual achievements, the massive public construction efforts in the hundreds of ruined urban centers, must be regarded as the bitter fruit of the sustained oppression of the majority by the elite minority. Their own work, they wrote, convinced them of the opposite: that a unified view of Maya ritual and cosmology has endured for at least two millennia.</p>
            <p>Key to Freidel, Schele, and Parkers arguments were Maya beliefs in the sacred trees and mountains that they identified as variant forms of the <italic>axis mundi</italic> providing access to the Classic Maya upper and lower worlds. Their interpretation of the crosslike object carved on the lid of the ruler Pakals sarcophagus at Palenque as a World Tree was inspired by a glyphic inscription in the Temple of the Cross at the same site, which they read as <italic>wakah kan</italic>, meaning six sky or raised up sky (Schele and Freidel 1990:66, 426 n. 8; Freidel, Schele, and Parker 1993:57) (fig. A). Their argument that certain monumental Maya temple pyramids were symbolic mountains associated with the creation of the world and serving as the source of human sustenance was based upon inscriptions that relate the word for mountain, <italic>witz</italic>, to specific Mayan structures (Schele and Freidel 1990:7172, 427 n. 16). The most commonly cited example of a Witz pyramid is Structure H Sub3 at Waxaktun, Guatemala. This complex features huge modeled stucco masks on both sides of the central stairway that, according to Schele and Freidel (p. 137), depicted a great Witz Monster sitting in fishladen primordial waters with vegetation growing from the sides of its head (fig. 3). In principle, they claimed, all Maya pyramids were Witz Monsters (p. 439 n. 22).<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg9" position="float" seq="3">

            <p>In addition, these buildings, like the World Tree, hypothetically served as Cosmic Portals, giving the Maya ruler access to the otherworlds and the supernatural (e.g., Freidel, Schele, and Parker 1993:13852). The danger of incautious use of cosmology as evidence of shamanism is exemplified by Brian Strosss (1994:159) interpretation of a Classic Maya pectoral as a symbol of such a portal (fig. B). When the king wore the pectoral, Stross argued, he could pass through the Cosmic Portal into the underworld to converse with the ancestral deities. For Stross (pp. 159, 166) the ruler was a state shaman and the portal was part of a shamanic universe. Stross based his argument on a previous identification of quadrifoil forms in Classic Maya paintings and sculptures as places of passage between this world and the otherworld (Freidel, Schele, and Parker 1993:215, 352, 36667). However, the pectoral that Stross analyzed does not assume a truly quadrifoil form either wholly or in part. Moreover, although Eliade (1964 [1951]:48286) recognized an earthly portal open to the upper and lower worlds as a frequent component of shamanic ideologies, he did not identify it as a diagnostic of shamanism. Notions of a Cosmic Portal, he noted (1958:3; 1964 [1951]:26669, 270, 272), are, like the World Tree and the World Mountain, ancient and widespread throughout the world, having played a role in both Christianity and Islam. Thus, even if Strosss identification of the pectoral as a symbolic Cosmic Portal were betterfounded, it would not support his assumption that a ruler who may have worn the pectoral was necessarily a shaman.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg10" position="float" seq="5">

            <title>HumanAnimal Transformation</title>
            <p>Beginning with Fursts identification of certain Olmec figurines as shamans in the act of transforming into their jaguar familiars, Mesoamericanists have been preoccupied with the theme of humananimal transformation. Their interest received a boost in 1989 with publication of an article by F. Kent Reilly, then a graduate student at the University of Texas, Austin. Although he was earning his degree in Latin American studies, Reilly had been working closely with Schele and was eventually to submit a dissertation entitled Visions to Another World: Art, Shamanism, and Political Power in Middle Formative Mesoamerica (Reilly 1994). Reillys article, The Shaman in Transformation Pose: A Study of the Theme of Rulership in Olmec Art, focused on an unprovenienced figurine in the Princeton Art Museum  (fig. C) that he identified as a shaman in the process of turning into an animal (presumably a jaguar) under the influence of a hallucinogen. The novel part of Reillys argument was his identification of these transforming shamans as Olmec rulers who, according to him, based their right to rule on their personal charisma and professed supernatural powers. His evidence for the identification of these figures as rulers consisted of traces of red cinnabar found on the Princeton figure and several other transformation figurines, red cinnabar having been found at several Olmec sites in elite burials. His opinion that the Princeton figurine specifically represented what he and others have called a shamanking hinged on his speculation that its now missing eye inlays were made of a shiny stone such as pyrite or magnetite. These, when in place, would allegedly have expressed the figures state of selfreflection and created the effect of spirituality. The subjects charismatic personality, Reilly argued, was revealed by the features of its fine head, while its trancelike condition was implied by the poisonous toad, a member of the species <italic>Bufo marinus</italic>, incised into the top of its head. Bones of <italic>Bufo marinus</italic> had been found by Michael Coe and Richard Diehl (1980:383) at the Olmec site of San Lorenzo, and there are reports of the use of poisonous toad secretions to induce trances among modern tropicalforest peoples in South America (Schultes 1972:28n; P. Furst 1972).<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg11" position="float" seq="6">

            <p>Scant as solid scholarly evidence may be here, Reilly related the subject of the Princeton figure to the ancient Shang emperors of China, who, according to the Sinologist K. C. Chang (1988:4455), served the Shang state as head shamans. Reilly was clearly unaware of David Keightleys then unpublished critique of Changs thesis, an argument that has since been published (Keightley 1998; cf. Kehoe 1999:12). Nor did Reilly engage the still unresolved question of whether the Shang and Olmec polities were comparable in size and organization. According to most Olmec archaeologists, current evidence for that polity points toward a less complex form of government, a chiefdom (Diehl 1989:2630) or, at best, a small kingdom (Clark 1997:215). Experts disagree about the Shang, but there are good reasons for thinking that it was a territorial state (Trigger 1999).10</p>
            <p>The positive reception granted Furst and Reillys efforts to identify Olmec figures as shamans transforming into their animal familiars encouraged other scholars to transfer the model to other parts of Mesoamerica. In their discussion of certain Zapotec relief sculptures at Monte Albn the archaeologist Marilyn Masson and the art historian Heather Orr (1998:166)both trained at the University of Texas, Austincite only three of Fursts criteria for identifying a shaman: humananimal transformation, a threetiered universe, and the ability to pass among the levels of that universe during trance. However, exemplifying scholars tendency to pick and choose only those shamanic criteria that suit their material, they discussed only two of thesehumananimal transformation and magical flight. Evidence of a belief in a threetiered universe among the Zapotec was not presented. Masson and Orr identified certain figures that appeared to be part human and part animal as royal shamans, or shamankings, each of whom had transformed into his animal familiar or <italic>nagual</italic>. That these figures might represent warriors dressed in the costumes of their military orders was rejected, and the possibility that the costumes referred to the name of the wearer or his lineage (as do certain animal costumes in the Mixtec historical manuscripts and some Maya reliefs) was not considered. As support for their claim that the Zapotecs also believed in magical flight, Masson and Orr pointed to other Zapotec reliefs, many found at other sites, in which figures assumed a horizontaltherefore, to their minds, flyingposition. Although some of these flying figures had previously been identified as ancestors, an identification that would not be incompatible with that of shamans, no further evidence that they were shamans was offered.</p>

                  <p>Current estimates of the size of the largest Olmec site, San Lorenzo, place it at about 690 hectares, with a population of between 10,500 and 17,500 (Clark 1997:21617). While the full extent of the largest Shang sites, the capital Anyang and the city of Zheng Zhou, has not been determined, the walled center of the latter alone covers an area roughly half the size of San Lorenzo in its entirety; the bulk of the populace lived outside these walls in an area approximately nine times the size of the center. Thus, Zheng Zhou was roughly four times the size of San Lorenzo. Moreover, unlike the Olmec, the Shang had several major urban centers existing simultaneously (Lothar van Falkenhausen, personal communication, 2001; Trigger 1999:53).</p>

            <title>The <italic>Nagual</italic> and the <italic>Way</italic>
            </title>
            <p>Masson and Orr, moreover, like most scholars who use the concept of shamanism to understand Mesoamerican art, failed to confront the historical and historiographical problems presented by use of the term <italic>nagual</italic>, which comes from the Nahuatl language spoken primarily by the contactperiod Aztec of Central Mexico. Today, <italic>nagual</italic> is used not just in Central Mexico but also by people living in a number of places in Mexico and Guatemala where Aztec influence was felt before the conquest but, as in Oaxaca, Nahuatl is not spoken. There it is most often used to refer to certain exceptional persons believed capable of transforming into animals for nefarious purposesnot, as Masson and Orr used the term, to indicate a rulers animal familiar.11</p>
            <p>Aztec specialists are still uncertain what <italic>nagual</italic> or <italic>nahualli</italic> meant to the preHispanic Aztec. Alfredo Lpez Austin (1988:372) has concluded that, among the Aztec, the term referred not to a person who could literally turn into an animal but rather to one who could deliberately release or separate himself from one of his three souls.12 George Foster (1944:95) had earlier argued that, since the conquestperiod Aztecs themselves had no concept of an animal soul companion or coessence, the word <italic>nagual</italic> must eventually have become attached to the southern Mesoamerican concept of an animal alter ego. According to him, this confusion (pp. 85, 103) was probably due to the fact that 16thcentury Spaniards tended to use the word <italic>nagual</italic> as a convenient handle to describe what were actually a wide variety of unrelated customs. The moral character of the <italic>nagual</italic> changed with the passage of time as well. In the decades immediately following the Spanish conquest, <italic>nanahualtin</italic> (pl. of <italic>nahualli</italic>) could be good as well as bad (Sahagn 195082:31), but over time the word <italic>nahualli</italic> came to be synonomous with sorcerer. Julian PittRivers (1970:19798, 200) suggests that Spaniards could understand the <italic>nagual</italic> only as a malevolent being because in Europe it was witches, seen as consorts of the Devil, who were believed capable of turning into animals.</p>
            <p>To make matters worse, many subsequent scholars have used the word <italic>nagual</italic> to describe phenomena for which the texts actually provide indigenous words, in the process often mistakenly attributing to the local entity the <italic>naguals</italic> transforming powers (Foster 1944:102).13 Foster provides example of ethnographers writing about the Zapotec, who (like Masson and Orr) use the word <italic>nagual</italic> instead of the indigenous words recorded by earlier observers.14 The confusion this can cause has spread to studies of Classic Maya images, in which the word <italic>nagual</italic> is often used interchangeably with the Maya word <italic>way</italic>. Stephen Houston and David Stuart (1989<italic>a</italic>) have argued that a key glyph (T539) in Classic Maya inscriptions reads as <italic>way</italic>, which today means sleep or dream but which they have preferred to read as coessence (see also Grube n.d.). In some Maya areas the term coessence connotes an individuals soulcompanion or alter ego.15 Accordingly, these writers identify the strange, hybrid figures on a painted vase from Altar de Sacrificios as possible manifestations of these spiritual entities, an interpretation extended to many other enigmatic beings in Classic Maya imagery, including the large vision serpents on the famous stonecarved lintels of Yaxchilan (fig. D and E). The idea has caught on with other Mayanists (e.g., Freidel, Schele, and Parker 1993:192; ReentsBudet 1994:17, 155, 272).16 Its fragility, however, is implied by Inga Calvins (1997) study of the inscriptions accompanying some of these figures, which suggest to her that the figures do not represent coessences at all. Rather, she suggests, they refer to lineage ancestors and certain locations associated with them. It follows from this that we still do not know exactly what the words <italic>nagual</italic> and <italic>way</italic> connoted prior to the conquest.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg12" position="float" seq="7">

         <title>Why Is Shamanism So Popular?</title>
         <p>If there is no single, universally valid definition of the word shaman, it is often impossible, when one is mentioned, to know exactly what that person did or does. As Keightley (1983) has put it, one scholars shaman is not always anothers. Although this situation necessarily frustrates attempts at scholarly rigor, we suggest that this is precisely why so many scholars still cling so fiercely to the term. In our opinion, it is the very vagueness of the notion of the shaman that makes it so attractive to so many scholars, lay people, advertisers, tour guides, museum curators, and nationstates. By allowing us to avoid certain other words and categories that would force us to confront the historical, social, and cultural specifics of the peoples in question, the words shaman and shamanism make scholars lives easier. In so doing, however, they foster the false impression that these peoples are socially and culturally very similar to one another, internally homogeneous and harmonious, and preoccupied with the spiritual and magic. At the same time, they imply that the religious and medical specialists in all of these societies lack scientifically sound medical knowledge and exert little sociopolitical influence. In what follows, we examine some of the religious, medical, and political terms that the words shaman and shamanism often replace and argue that it is precisely by means of this avoidance of these terms that we have been able to create and preserve our Mesoamerican Other.</p>
         <sec id="sc3.1">
            <title>Shamans, Priests, and Magicians</title>
            <p>If we see certain individuals as primarily religious practitioners, for example, the label shaman allows us to avoid referring to them as priests. Although, to our knowledge, no Mesoamericanist has ever seriously tried to formulate a theoretical distinction between shamans and priests, the Plains Indian specialist Robert Lowie (1963 [1954]:179) took up the problem in 1954. Lowie defined a shaman as one who acquires his status through a personal communication by supernatural beings, whereas a priest need not have this facetoface relationship with the spirit world, instead deriving his expertise from group ritual through formal training. Since this seems to be the most commonly accepted basis for the categorical distinction between shamans and priests, it is significant that, in practice, Lowie encountered difficulty in applying it to the Pawnee medicine men he had studied. Although these individuals were called to their office by the thunder spirits and derived their powers from animal protectors, they were trained and essentially ordained by Pawnee medicine men. Lowie (1963 [1954]:179) had to admit, therefore, that these men were shamans who were likewise priests. Similarly, Gerald Weiss, in his 1973 article on the personnel conducting the Campa <italic>ayahuasca</italic> ceremony in Peru, had to acknowledge that the behavior of the individuals he worked with combined features of both shamans and priests. And Barbara Tedlock (1992:47, 5253) has concluded that Quich daykeepers and motherfathers in Momostenango, Guatemala, are best described as shamanpriests and priestshamans, respectively.17 These examples parallel Winklemans (1990) insertion of the evolutionary categories of shaman healers, healers, and mediums between those of shaman and priest because he, too, could locate no clearcut functional difference between the two (see also Keightley 1998:770).</p>
            <p>If leading group ceremonies is a criterion of priestly status, then it should be noted that most Mixe healers, parttime specialists who work independently with individual clients, nonetheless come together on occasion to officiate at major feasts and crises (Lipp 1991:149). A comparable observation may be made of the Zinacantan Tzotzil <italic>hilol</italic> (seer), who is typically described in the literature as a shaman (e.g., Freidel, Schele, and Parker 1993:127). While it is true that the <italic>hiloletik</italic> (pl. of <italic>hilol</italic>) effect individual cures by means of supernaturally derived powers, they frequently also come together to conduct ceremonies on behalf of various social groups (Vogt 1966). By excluding the word priest from their descriptions of these individuals roles, scholars not only emphasize the difference between them and Christian religious authorities but also misrepresent the range, diversity, and nature of their roles.</p>
            <p>Why do scholars persist in repressing the priestly and social dimension of the shamans occupation? As we have seen, the Mesoamerican shaman is often said to operate by means of magic; he or she is, in other words, what many anthropologists call a magicoreligious practitioner. However, Keith Thomas (1997:41), in his monumental study of the decline of magic in the Old World, pointed out that the belief that earthly events can be influenced by supernatural intervention was [and is] not in itself a magical one. Moreover, even if magic were a major strategy of Mesoamerican curers and diviners, Roman Catholicism itself, as Thomas (pp. 4650) noted, has always depended heavily upon magic; there is no major difference in that regard between native specialists and Catholic priests and clerics.18 Indeed, rather than deny that magic existed and was effective, the church countered the magic of the Middle Ages and Renaissance with its own forms of magic (Thomas 1997:41, 4849; see also Malinowski 1965:105).</p>
            <p>Michael Taussig (1987:14243) has eloquently argued that the colonial church in Latin America, as a consequence of its ethnocentric assumption that Indians were particularly prone to magic, actually imposed upon them their reputation for religious magic. Taussig has come as close as anyone to clarifying the motive for this process:</p>
            <p>
               <disp-quote>
                  <p>Doubtless this it we call magic  existed in thirdworld countries before European colonization. But equally surely this it from that point on contained as a constitutive force the power of colonial differentiation such that magic became a gathering point for Otherness in a series of racial and class differentiations embedded in the distinctions made between Church and magic, and science and magic. Here magic exists not so much as an it entity true to itself but as an imaginary Other to the imagined absoluteness of God and science.</p>
               </disp-quote>
            </p>
            <p>It seems to us that this ability to create a starkly different, magician Other underlies shamanisms appeal to Mesoamericanists. In their introduction to <italic>Maya Cosmos</italic>, Freidel, Schele, and Parker (1993:1011, 34) state explicitly that what they seek to lay out for the reader is evidence of a spiritual and magical world, a pervasively spiritual way of life. According to them, the Maya world to which they promise to introduce their readers is a world of living magic that has thrived in the Maya area since earliest times. That shamanism feeds a romantic nostalgia for a supposedly more spiritual, less materialistic and rational past has been noted many times. Taussig (1987:168) and Kehoe (1996:377) both recognized it as a modern form of primitivism, a myth that, as we have seen, today appeals as much to some academics working in urban universities as it does to New Age gurus and wannabe shamans (Kehoe 1996:384, 386). The image of the shaman as a magician feeds that myth. As John Middleton (1987:82) noted, the concept of magic has almost always been thought to mark a distinction between Western and socalled primitive cultures, or between Christian and nonChristian religions. He cited LviStrausss (1962) contention that both magic and religion are subjective notions used by Westerners, in Middletons words, to mark off outside thought as different from our own scientific thought (Middleton 1987:88).</p>

                  <p>Be this as it may, scholars writing about Mayan art seldom follow Tedlocks lead, preferring to refer to Maya daykeepers simply as shamans (e.g., Stross 1994:161, 1n; Freidel, Schele, and Parker 1993:3033, 5557, 12931, 18485, 21922).</p>

The reason: he does not want his people to be compared to Christians. Peter Furst (1994) reports that his principal Huichol informant, Ramn Medina Silva, who in the 1960s was an aspiring <italic>maraakme</italic>, had picked up the word shaman from a local priest who had studied anthropology in the United States and begun to refer to himself as a shaman because, since the priest pronounced the word as <italic>shamn</italic>, he assumed that it was the Spanish word for his own religious title.</p>

            <title>The Shaman and the Doctor</title>
            <p>To preserve this constructed Other, however, it seems to be equally important to distinguish the shaman from the physician. Although some scholars (e.g., Thomas and Humphrey 1994:4; Graham 1998:192) have lamented academias preoccupation with the healing role of the shaman, few protest or explore the implications of the fact that scholars avoid standard Western medical nomenclature when they write of shamans. When scholars identify a native who cures the sick as a shaman, in other words, they do not have to recognize him or her as a doctor or physicianthat is, as a person who practices medicine rather than healing by means of magic.</p>
            <p>Why do we want to make this distinction between the native healer and the doctor or physician, between what native curers practice and what we call medicine? We suggest, following LviStrauss (1962), that the real distinction being made here is between shamanism and Western science. One factor shaping this desire to differentiate the Mesoamerican curer from the licensed doctor has to do with the ageold antagonism between folk medicine and the establishment. Keith Thomas (1997:637) points out that during the CounterReformation, in particular, the church saw European folk healers, along with magicians and astrologers, as its deadly rivals because these individuals competed for the privilege of responding to misfortune. A similar competition occurred among those who cured the body rather than the soul. Barbara Ehrenreich and Deirdre English (1973) note that, during the Renaissance, Italian physicians, who were typically of privileged birth and had attended urban universities, saw themselves as being in competition with unschooled curers. Many of these folk healers were ultimately denounced as witches by these doctors and their patrons, an act that resulted in the formers appearance before the dreaded Inquisition. This Old World antagonism between doctor and folk healer was brought to the New World by the Spaniards, who in both Mexico and Peru used the Inquisition to accuse and punish natives who persisted in using indigenous cures.19</p>
            <p>In the case of Mexico, the irony, according to Bernard Ortiz de Montellano (1976:23), is that at the time of the Conquest, health and medicine in Tenochtitlan [the Aztec capital] were at least on a par [with] and superior in some aspects to that of the Spanish conquerors. Ortiz de Montellano (pp. 225) argues that, at contact, the empirical aspect of Aztec medicine, which he says scholars have consistently underrated, was in fact substantial. Sixteenthcentury sources indicate that the ideal Aztec healer was one who tested his remedies, for example, and that the Aztec distinguished between healers whose cures were effective and healers whose cures were not. Conversely, Ortiz de Montellano (1976, 1989) points out, European medicine, which later borrowed heavily from Aztec herbalism, at the time contained a considerable magical component, much of which the invaders probably introduced into Native American medical practice.20</p>
            <p>The ready meshing and reciprocal influences of European and Aztec magical concepts and empirical knowledge are surely due in part to the high degree of correspondence between native and European beliefs regarding disease at the time of contact. In medieval and Renaissance Europe, as in the Americas before Columbus, healing was, at least in part, a religious matter. By 1477, the Spanish monarch Charles I had granted professional <italic>ensalmos</italic>, or prayer curers, the same status as doctors and surgeons (Ortiz de Montellano 1976:26). Moreover, like many New World curers today, European healers believed that disease was a foreign presence in the body that had to be removed, usually by conjuring or exorcism (Thomas 1997:182). In the early 16th century the physician and alchemist Paracelsus, who established the role of chemistry in European medicine, claimed that witches could introduce disease by shooting a foreign object into the skin of a victim, a belief also documented in the New World after the conquest (Ortiz de Montellano 1976:24). Like Mexican priests and curers, European witches also covered their bodies with a potent ointment that gave them magical powers (Brinton 1894, Cervantes 1994, Ehrenreich and English 1973).21 Similarly, some European healers used hallucinogenic plants and were believed to fly through the air, go into semitrance in order to divine, have animal familiars, and seek assistance from spirit helpersin their case, imps, devils, ghosts, and fairies (Aguirre Beltrn 1963:11014; Thomas and Humphrey 1994:215, 44546, 6068; Harner 1973:14047) (fig. 4). The parallels between conquestperiod indigenous New World curing practices and contemporary European folk healing are so striking that it is, in our opinion, simply impossible to justify making a qualitative semantic distinction between them.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg4" position="float" seq="9">

            <title>The Shaman as Political Actor</title>
            <p>The tendency to play down the medical accomplishments of Mesoamerican healers parallels the common practice of representing native religious leaders as operating outside of the political arena. Many ethnographic studies of shamans even in relatively noncentralized societies show that shamans often exercise, directly or indirectly, considerable political power (e.g., Dole 1973, ReichelDolmatoff 1976). Evon Vogt (1966:36566), for example, viewed as symbolic expressions of land and water rights the ceremonies conducted within local lineage or waterhole groups by the <italic>hiloletik</italic> of Zinacantan. Because the larger yearrenewal ceremonies held in the ceremonial center involved <italic>hiloletik</italic> from each of the outlying hamlets as well as those from the center, Vogt (p. 367) saw them as a symbolic way of relating the outlying <italic>parajes</italic> [hamlets] to the tribal gods in the ceremonial center (fig. 5). In these ways, the <italic>hiloletik</italic> played the political role of integrating and maintaining their communities.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg5" position="float" seq="10">

            <p>Scholars resistance to the political role of Mesoamerican religious practitioners can also be seen in the coinage shamanking. As we have seen, this term has been applied, on the basis of Olmec and Zapotec imagery, to Maya rulers thought by some to have claimed the ability to transform into a powerful animal familiar and thereby make direct contact with the supernatural. The arguments most recent proponent is Julia Kappelman, a former student of Schele, who has transferred the notion of the shamanking to certain figures carved in relief on Late PreClassic and ProtoClassic stone monuments at the Maya sites of Kaminaljuyu and Izapa.</p>
            <p>Kappelman (1997; 2001:8895) notes, for example, that on Izapa Stelae 2 and 4, elaborately garbed men, whom she presumes to be Izapan rulers, seem to have wings attached to their shoulders or arms and wear a headdress shaped like the head of a bird (fig. F). This, she concludes, implies that they are transforming into a bird. She identifies this bird as the nagual, or animal spirit companion, of the primordial shaman Itzamna (p. 91), a powerful deity in the northern lowlands at the time of the conquest. As partial support for her argument, Kappelmann offers John Justeson and Terrence Kaufmanns (1993, 1996) translation of a passage in the lengthypossibly Zoqueinscription on the coeval stela found at La Mojarra in southern Veracruz. There the impressive figure of a winged ruler is described, according to these epigraphers, as having been arrayed as a macaw, presumably the same macaw as the one named Vucub Kaquix in the Quich Popul Vuh and known to students of Classic Maya art as the Principal Bird Deity (fig. 6). The La Mojarra figure is also described in the adjacent text as a shapeshifter, according to Kappelman (p. 97) yet another indication of shamanic transformation. Kappelmans interpretation relates to Schele and Millers (1986:1089) earlier identification of a curious plant that rises from the headdress of the figure on Kaminaljuyu Stela 11 as the World Tree (fig. G). In their opinion, this shows that the king was identifying himself with the <italic>axis mundi</italic> and the Cosmic Portal and that he was professing to be able to access the otherworld by means of them.22<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg14" position="float" seq="11">

            <p>Although, in the present state of knowledge, we have no way of knowing whether anyoneincluding the Maya rulertook any of these claims literally, rulers in many places and times have professed to have special supernatural powers. Late medieval and early Renaissance kings in Europe, for example, claimedand were believedto be able to cure certain illnesses merely by laying a hand or bestowing a special object on the patient (Thomas 1997:19295, 199200; Bloch 1973) (fig. 7).23 The socalled royal touch, inherent in rulers whose descent lines were believed to be blessed by God, can be documented as far back as the 12thcentury reigns of Philip I of France and Henry II of England; it was elaborated upon by Englands Henry VII, making its way into the Book of Common Prayer in 1633 (Bloch 1973:14, 22, 46, 208; Rose 1970:36). The practice relates to the much earlier laying on of hands by Jesus and his apostles and the anointing of monarchs with blessed oil dispensed by popes and priests (Rose 1970:2729; Bloch 1973:3540). Englands Charles II ministered to roughly 100,000 people over the course of his reign (Bloch 1973:21013). Outside of England, during the same period, Louis XIV of France cured almost 1,600 people in a single day, and the king of Spain also drew large crowds of sufferers (Rose 1970:38).<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg7" position="float" seq="14">

            <p>Thus there would have been nothing exceptional about Mesoamerican rulers basing their rule on professed magical powers. Indeed, while it is true that antagonisms are easily bred by the antithetical agendas of chiefs and religious leaders (e.g., Klein 1978; Roe 1995:127), shamans have not always been in opposition to the state, as Caroline Humphrey (in Thomas and Humphrey 1994:193) has pointed out. John Pohl (1994:42, 45) has shown that the title of a second order of preHispanic Mixtec priests, whose duty was to perform sacrifices, derived from a kind of supernatural called <italic>yahui</italic> (fig. H). Today these <italic>yahui</italic> are said to transform themselves into birds and animals in order to fly through the air after ingesting hallucinogenic mushrooms. In this way they communicate directly with the ancestral spirits, whose answers to their questions allow them to diagnose diseases. Pohl (1994:44, 4751) noted that the ancient <italic>yahui</italic> priests, whose ideological powers were magical, appear in Mixtec historical codices in scenes of the founding of petty kingdoms, as well as taking responsibility for managing the royal economy and tribute collection. Moreover, a <italic>yahui</italic> priest apparently could assume the throne when the royal line failed to produce an heir. The Codex Nuttall shows that three Mixtec kings served as <italic>yahui</italic> prior to taking office, one of them the famous Lord 8Deer.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg16" position="float" seq="15">

            <p>Our point is that these rulers were no more shamans than they had been when they served as priests. Rather, they were political leaders, rulers of relatively small but centralized citystates, whose professed powers included an ability to communicate with the ancestors (Earle 1997:150).24 To label them as shamans or shamankings once they assumed office is to underestimate their political importance, deny the political and economic basis of their power, and exaggerate the differences between them and rulers elsewhere who have made similar kinds of claims. Moreover, as David Webster (1995:12122) argued in his review of <italic>Maya Cosmos</italic>, Maya kings did not emerge <italic>because</italic> they were successful shamans, but rather shamanism was grafted onto a set of more fundamental processes  that selected for centralized rulership. This resonates with Keith Thomass (1997:198199) observation that the British monarchy had deliberately commandeered the older belief in magical objects in order to build up the supernatural status of kingship, with the result that the ability to cure became a touchstone for any claimant to the English throne. As Kehoe (1996:7) pointed out, if Shang and Maya kings were institutionalized shamans, then without doubt so were many European monarchs. Yet we never refer to the latter as shamans.</p>

            <title>Hierarchy, Specialization, and Internal Factionalism</title>
            <p>Use of the umbrella word shaman rather than indigenous occupational titles also circumvents our having to acknowledge the hierarchization and specializations of Mesoamerican magicoreligious practitioners and the unequal distribution of power among them. Thomas and Humphrey (1994:56) note that one kind of medicoreligious practitioner may be incorporated into the state apparatus while others are simultaneously marginalized. Given that what falls under the rubric of shamanism is so diverse in form and that shamans tend to be internally ranked, they urge scholars to think in terms of multiple shamanisms rather than of one, essentializing shamanism. More important, they urge scholars to focus not on the metaphysical beliefs that underwrite what we call shamanism but rather on the political importance of what inspirational practitioners actually do.</p>
            <p>We can see the need for this in Mesoamerican studies. The Zinacanteco <italic>hiloletik</italic>, for example, sit at the table in a rank order based on their years of service (Vogt 1966:362). The highestranking <italic>hilol</italic> in each hamlet not only is in charge of the local ceremonies and the person who can grant permission for local novitiates to make their public debut but also gets to choose which two <italic>hiloletik</italic> from his hamlet will participate in the yearrenewal ceremonies in the ceremonial center (Vogt 1966:36263). At Momostenango, Quich priestshamans are likewise hierarchized in a manner that bridges religious and governmental duties (B. Tedlock 1992:35, 37). Moreover, regardless of rank, some Zinacanteco <italic>hiloletik</italic> are bonesetters, others (who are always women) are midwives, and still others are in charge of talking saints (Fabrega and Silver 1973:4146). Here, as nearly everywhere in the New World, there are also good <italic>hiloletik</italic> and bad ones, or witches (Fabrega and Silver 1973:42). In the Tzutujil Maya village of Santiago Atitln, Robert Carlsen and Martn Prechtel (1994:101) identified six different types of shamans: midwives, herbalists, daykeepers, spirit sweepers, animalbite specialists, and malevolent witches who transformed themselves into animals. Not only did these practitioners not know all of the others techniques but they differed among themselves on cosmological specifics (Carlson and Prechtel 1994:94).</p>
            <p>Specialization was even more pronounced in preColumbian times within the imperial boundaries of the Aztec state. Lpez Austin (1968) has constructed a list of 40 different kinds of Aztec magician, which, he notes, represent only the most important of these practitioners. Interestingly, only one specialist in the list, the <italic>paini</italic>, was said to travel to the otherworld under the influence of a hallucinogenic plant to effect his cures (1968:102). Under the Aztec subheading of <italic>tlacateclotl</italic> (transforming witch or <italic>brujo</italic>) Lpez Austin mentions 13 different varieties, which he distinguishes from the <italic>ticitl</italic>, or physician proper. Among those <italic>titici</italic> (pl. of <italic>ticitl</italic>) that used magic to effect their cures, he identifies 11 different specialized techniques (fig. 8). Nutini and Roberts (1993:9596) have since expanded Lpez Austins list. The moral of the story is clear: because there was so much variety among Aztec specialists, generalizing about the role of the magician in ancient Nahua societies has little validity (Lpez Austin 1988:362). Kehoe (1999:5) brings the point closer to the topic of shamanism when she notes that the wide range of Aztec religious practitioners makes the simplistic cover term shaman  grossly inadequate.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg8" position="float" seq="16">

            <p>Mesoamericanists also need to do a better job of factoring in the passage of time, in particular the often traumatic changes that have taken place since the conquest. Nutini and Roberts (1993:91), for example, conclude from their comparison of presentday Tlaxcalan anthropomorphic supernaturalism with its preHispanic counterpart that it is apparent that the system has shrunk six and a half times.25 That much of this change took place in the late 17th and early 18th centuries proves that attention to the immediately postconquest period is never sufficient (Nutini and Roberts 1993). Cecelia Klein (1995) has shown that European notions about women, midwives, and witches eventually altered not only the way in which female Aztec healers and indigenous goddesses were perceived and represented in colonial art and literature but also the way in which their professional women were treated. Moreover, art historians using ethnographic data to interpret preHispanic Mesoamerican religion seldom acknowledge postcontact African influence on Mesoamerican beliefs about sorcery and witchcraft.26 We also need to confront the implications of changes that took place prior to the conquest. Benjamin Colby (1976) suggested that at the time of the conquest some Maya, especially those living in the highlands, had recently adopted a new form of supernaturalism that involved tonalism, malevolent nagualism, and animal coessences. The Ixil and Yucatec Maya, in contrast, were still practicing a Classicperiod form of ancestor worship.</p>

         <title>Conclusions</title>
         <p>We have tried to show that uncritical use of the words shaman and shamanism is symptomatic of some very serious problems in Mesoamerican art studies. One of these problems stems from deliberate avoidance of the demands of rigorous scholarship, including a critical, historiographicaland historicalapproach to borrowed terms and concepts. A second problem arises from the inherent vagueness and variability of meaning of the words shaman and shamanism. Unless Mesoamericanists can come to agreement on a valid definition of shaman, we recommend that the term be dropped. Instead we encourage art historians, historians of religion, and social scientists to work together to create a more refined, more nuanced terminology that would distinguish, crossculturally, among the many different kinds of roles currently lumped together under the vague and homogenizing rubric of shaman. If a Mesoamerican ruler who apparently claimed to have supernatural powers is to be labeled a shamanking, then we should either similarly identify as shamankings all rulers, throughout the world, who have professed to such powers or cease using the term altogether.</p>
         <p>In our view, the stakes in this matter are high. By neglecting to address these problems, Mesoamericanists writing about art have for decades participated in, and indeed helped to perpetuate, the Wests shameless romanticization of the indigenous past. In so doing, they have maintained, indeed reinvigorated, the ahistorical, apolitical, spiritual and irrational Other that was initially constructed during the years of conquest and colonization of the Americas. What we all think of today when we hear or read the word shaman is a magician from some other time or place who is not quite a priest, a doctor, or a true chief or king but combines unspecified features of many if not all of these. This individual does not qualify as an empiricist, is no different from most other socalled shamans both at home and the world over, and is immune to the everyday competitions, squabbles, and power grabs that characterize those living in the modern Western world. Indeed, the shaman lives in a timeless space occupied by spirits rather than by real people, a mystical spacetime much like the otherworld of shamanic lore. He or she, in other words, is a phantom, a member of what Taussig (1989) has called a madeup, modern, Western categorya category of people who, some Mesoamericanists seem to think, are not like us at all.</p>
