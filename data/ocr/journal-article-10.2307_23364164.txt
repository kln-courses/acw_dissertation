Kramer • Gary Bente Published online: 24 February 2010 © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010 Abstract Numerous studies have evaluated the effects of pedagogical agents on students' learning outcomes, but so far, beneficial effects have not been consistently demonstrated. The ambiguous results might partly be due to the strong emphasis on cognitive outcomes, which is characteristic for research in teaching and learning. The paper suggests a shift of attention to socio-emotional and relational variables, which might be considered as relevant moderator variables in learning or even as learning outcomes per se, for example, in social learning. In order to achieve this goal, we suggest a systematic account of the results from social psychology and in particular from nonverbal communication research, and findings from studies on the social effects of embodied agents in general. This perspective will include (1) a distinction between static and dynamic aspects of embodiment, such as the visual appearance of agents and their nonverbal behavior, and (2) a more systematic approach concerning the functions of embodiment and nonverbal behavior, such as modeling, discourse and dialogue functions, and socio-emotional effects. A further argument addresses the necessity of complementing outcome measures by process measures, which are sensitive to the tasks and the changing situational demands that occur during learning processes and tutor-learner interaction.

While this agent is merely a simple graphical character that is not capable of interaction, current scientific implementations provide largely autonomous computer agents, which follow didactic scripts in order to enhance students' learning and motivation. These so-called pedagogical agents have been widely expected to transfer the benefits of human-human tutoring and instructional communication to the area of computer-supported learning. Future systems are anticipated to enhance e-learning programs for individual learning with a human-like motivator or to support teachers in the classroom by attending to small groups of students (Lester et al. 2000; Moreno 2004). As one major advantage of these embodied automatic tutors, their advocates claim that pedagogical agents can, or will be able in the future, communicate via verbal and nonverbal means, thus facilitating and personalizing the interaction with an e-learning program (e.g., Lester et al. 2000). Furthermore, increased motivation is expected: Baylor and Ryu (2003) suggest that the key advantage is that human-likeness creates more positive learning experiences and provides a strong motivating effect. And indeed, mentoring and collaboration have been identified as motivational factors relevant to learning (Bente and Breuer 2009). In line with these assumptions, research on pedagogical agents suggests that even the mere social presence of an embodied autonomous tutor might be capable of fostering interest, attention, and subsequently learning (Lester et al. 2000; Baylor and Ryu 2003). While recent studies focused on the students' learning outcomes and employed a framework grounded in cognitive psychology (Baylor 2001), the social, emotional and motivational aspects have been largely neglected (see also Kim and Baylor 2006), even though they are a crucial part of the depicted vision. Moreover, theories that might link social interaction and motivation to learning, such as self-determination theory (Deci and Ryan 1985) or Vygotsky's approach concerning the zone of proximal development (Vygotsky 1978), are never or seldom referred to. As one concrete example for the crucial role of social aspects, the establishment of common ground (Clark 1996; Jucks et al. 2003) can be mentioned, which is seen as a prerequisite for instructional communication: the student must be able to understand the instruction correctly and—probably more importantly—the teacher has to be able to recognize whether shared meaning or common ground have been achieved. Here, nonverbal communication is seen as one vital means to achieve and to check for mutual understanding (Bente et al. 2008b). For instance, a teacher might interpret the facial expressions of his or her students as signs of understanding or affirmation. Especially when the agent is expected to adapt to the learner, these fundamental aspects of social interaction have to be given. Against this background, the primary goal of the current paper is not to provide an overview of pedagogical agent research (for this purpose, see the excellent reviews by Baylor 2001; Clarebout et al. 2002; Domagk 2008; Moreno 2004), and nor is the goal to comment on the specific benefits of virtual environments (see Bailenson et al. 2008a, b; Blascovich and Beall this issue). Rather, the aim is to highlight additional aspects from social psychology and communication research that might prove useful when building and evaluating the effects of pedagogical agents. Specifically, we argue that the implications of embodiment (in the sense of representing the agent tutor with a human-like body) must be considered more closely. The incorporation of a virtual body on the screen is widely expected to result in increased motivation and eventually in more efficient learning (see Clarebout et al. 2002; Domagk 2008; Lester et al. 2000), but studies neither empirically verify whether the expected social influences occur, nor do most of them consider or systematically test the effects of static and dynamic embodiment cues. By static embodiment cues, we refer to the appearance of the virtual character (see e.g., Domagk 2008, van Vugt et al. 2007), whereas dynamic embodiment refers to nonverbal behavior, such as movement, gesture, and facial displays &amp;\ Springer</page><page sequence="3">Educ Psychol Rev (2010) 22:71-87 73 (Kramer 2008c). In the following, we first give a brief overview of current technologies and architectures and summarize results concerning the agents' effectiveness. Then, based on a taxonomy on the functions of embodiment and nonverbal behavior, we will comment on findings and approaches from social psychology, (nonverbal) communication research, and human-computer interaction that have been largely neglected in pedagogical agent research. The final section presents current possibilities to assess the social, emotional and motivational impact of pedagogical agents by means of process measures. The section further includes conclusions concerning how to build adaptive pedagogical agents. Pedagogical Agents—Current Systems and Visions As mentioned above, a vision that is connected to the development of virtual agents is that their presence will influence learning positively in various ways (Clarebout et al. 2002). Agents are assumed to have a positive effect on learners' perception of the learning experience (Johnson et al. 2000). This is accomplished by adding the—according to Vygotsky (1978)—necessary social dimension to the situation (Moreno et al. 2001) and by providing students with encouragement by means of displaying appropriate emotions (Elliott et al. 1997). By including life-like communication cues and building a positive relationship with the student, agents are supposed to enhance students' motivation, which in turn might lead to more effective learning (Moreno et al. 2001). Based on this vision, several research groups have put forward their idea of pedagogical agent systems, drawing on approaches from either the area of cognitive and educational psychology or from the field of computer science. While the former focused first and foremost on didactic aspects and in most cases opted for a merely superficial design of the agent, the latter emphasized either the development of the virtual body or the in-built artificial (social) intelligence of the agent. In the following, we will exemplify these approaches referring to the most sophisticated systems and comment on their advantages and drawbacks from a social psychological perspective. As examples for approaches from educational psychology, we will outline the agent systems of the tutoring research group (Graesser et al. 2001) and of the PALS (pedagogical agent learning system) group (Baylor 2001). In terms of approaches from computer science, we include the work by the IntelliMedia group (Lester et al. 2000) and of the Center for Advanced Research in Technology for Education (Rickel and Johnson 2000). For a more complete overview, see Baylor (2001), Domagk (2008), Clarebout et al. (2002) or Moreno (2004). We focus our discussion only on "teacher agents" and will not comment on related approaches in which the agent takes the role of a (fellow) student, as in the teachable agents paradigm (Biswas et al. 2001; Schwartz et al. 2007). At the University of Memphis, AutoTutor has been developed as "a discourse facilitator or collaborative scaffold that assists the student in actively constructing knowledge" (Person et al. 2001, p. 1, see also the work on e-learning with an agent by Craig et al. 2000, 2002). Based on discourse analyses of face-to-face tutoring lessons, Graesser et al. (1999) constructed the tutor to be a dialog partner, which by asking questions and giving feedback helps the student to actively construct subjective explanations and engage in deep reasoning (Graesser et al. 2000, 2001). Here, the agent utilizes a hint-prompt-elaboration circle until the learner utters the correct answer. The embodiment as talking head "Marco" (built by means of the software Poser and Microsoft Agent), however, is merely seen as the front end, which only supports the underlying, more emphasized content-related architecture. Nevertheless, it is seen as crucial for the learning process: "A talking head is an important enhancement to AutoTutor because it concretely grounds the conversation between the tutor &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="4">74 Educ Psychol Rev (2010) 22:71-87 and the learner" (Graesser et al. 1999, p. 48). To achieve this grounding, the agent is enabled to produce specific nonverbal feedback cues, such as nodding or shaking its head, and display facial expressions, e.g., smiling or raising its eyebrows. However, compared to the sophisticated dialogue model, the nonverbal implementations as well as their theoretical foundations are rather shallow. Similarly, in PALS, Baylor and colleagues use simple embodiment techniques (Micro soft Agent "Merlin" or Poser agents) with merely basic nonverbal capabilities to personalize their sophisticated learning program (Baylor and Ebbers 2003a, b; Baylor and Ryu 2003). When clicked on, the agent gives assistance and additional information. The major goal of the group's implementations, however, is not to optimize a specific agent but rather to use it for systematic research on the effects of pedagogical agents on learning. Rickel and Johnson (1999, 2000), whose developments are grounded in computer science, locate their agents in a virtual learning environment. Agent Steve leads learners through a US navy ship and is capable of reacting to changes in the virtual environment as well as to learners' behavior. Based on information on the environment and the learner, he asks the student appropriate questions or gives explanations. Primarily physical tasks such as handling and maintenance of equipment are taught. The group's priority, however, lies with improving multimodal input (e.g., tracking the student's behavior) and related technology. Multimodal output (e.g., deictic gestures and further nonverbal behaviors) are not yet fully developed (Rickel and Johnson 2000). The architecture has been amended with the integration of an emotion model (Affective Reasoner, Elliott et al. 1999) and behavior control in a multi-agent environment (including turn-taking abilities, building common ground, Traum and Rickel 2002). The IntelliMedia Initiative at the North Carolina State University (Lester et al. 1997, 2000) developed various agents that are supposed to motivate children to learn within desktop-based learning environments. In particular, one of their most recent agents, Cosmo, is designed to use nonverbal behavior to support learning (Lester et al. 1999). He is not only able to use gestures and movements to highlight objects, but is also capable of displaying a wide array of emotions. However, the gestures and movements used do not precisely represent human nonverbal behavior—especially as the agent is only partly anthropomorphic. Recently, the group put forward Companion Agents, which are more explicitly geared to support social interaction (McQuiggan and Lester 2007). They tiy to extend the communicative capabilities of socially intelligent agents by modeling empathy as the next logical step in the evolution of synthetic agents. In general, all approaches highlight the importance of nonverbal behavior but the implementations themselves are in need of improvement. Summary of Research on the Effects of Pedagogical Agents In recent years, several reviews on pedagogical agent research summed up the results of evaluation studies (Baylor 2001; Clarebout et al. 2002; Domagk 2008; Kramer 2008a; Moreno 2004). As they report, a number of studies supported the notion that pedagogical agents motivate the learner and lead to increased learning: Lester and colleagues (Lester et al. 1997; Johnson et al. 2000) demonstrated that especially an expressive agent successfully supports student problem solving. Based on more systematic research in at least a dozen experiments, Graesser et al. (2007) concluded that AutoTutor improves learning by nearly one letter grade compared with reading a textbook for an equivalent amount of time or in comparison with a pretest. However, Rajan et al. (2001) demonstrated that it is first and foremost the voice that is responsible for these effects (see also Bente et al. 2008b). Similarly, £j Springer</page><page sequence="5">Educ Psychol Rev (2010) 22:71-87 75 Atkinson (2002) reported moderately positive results which also hint at the importance of the agent's voice. When the agent was capable of speaking, learners experienced less difficulty and showed increased transfer performance compared to a learning situation that was supported by a text-based agent, only text or no instruction. An additional experiment showed more clearly that an agent with voice is superior to voice or text only conditions with regard to several learning parameters and with respect to learners' experiences. Baylor and colleagues provided more evidence for an impact of pedagogical agents on learners' subjective experiences, but not on their performance and learning outcome (Baylor and Ryu 2003). In a series of studies, Roxana Moreno and her colleagues showed that it is not recall that is enhanced by pedagogical agents, but rather transfer performance. In line with the studies cited above, they demonstrated that the agent's voice is responsible (Moreno 2001; Moreno et al. 2001). More recently, Moreno (2003) therefore postulated that there is no evidence for the social cue hypothesis as it has not been shown that the mere presence of social aspects such as a human-like body leads to distinct effects. However, the cognitive guiding functions provided by vocalizations and a program's didactic concept did prove to be decisive. Moreno concluded that the main strength of pedagogical agents resides in the specific instructional method embedded in the agent rather than in the visual presence of the agent itself (Moreno 2004). She argues that the visual presence is neither beneficial nor detrimental and suggests that merely for observational learning that targets motor behavior (e.g., physical education, dance, and technical training), embodiment, i.e., visibility of the model, might be beneficial. Domagk (2008) also did not find a general effect of pedagogical agents on motivation or learning. However, when taking the specific appearance and the resulting "likeability" into account, it was shown that likeable agents lead to a higher motivation and increased transfer performance. In summary, research on the effects of pedagogical agents demonstrated that, first of all, learners' experiences, to a lesser degree performance, and especially transfer are positively influenced. Several studies provided evidence that beneficial effects might be due to vocalizations rather than the agent's visual presence. However, given the fact that none of the current systems provided sophisticated nonverbal communication in the sense of the subtle nonverbal behavior that we know from human-human interaction (see discussion below), it can be assumed that an improvement of nonverbal communication capacities might render an agent more effective. Similarly, Moreno et al. (2001) suggested that results might be different if deictic gestures or gazes were more salient or if social contents were relevant. The role of nonverbal behavior, and how its influence might be enhanced, will be debated below. If recent research demonstrates beneficial effects of agents, it has not yet been established whether these are due to motivational effects in the sense that the virtual teacher, for instance, encourages the student, or whether an agent influences predominantly cognitive variables. Therefore, studies assessing the processes during learning are needed (see Bente and Breuer 2009). Corresponding methodological possibilities will be discussed below. Pedagogical Agents and Their Static and Dynamic Attributes from the Perspective of Social Psychology and Communication Research Although traditionally, research on pedagogical agents has been dominated by a cognitive perspective (especially with regard to the dependent variables), recent approaches explicitly state the importance of complementing this by a social psychological framework. For instance, Kim and Baylor (2006) argue that learning environments should provide situated Springer</page><page sequence="6">76 Educ Psychol Rev (2010) 22:71-87 social interaction since it is well documented that the cognitive functioning of learners is framed by social contexts. Consequently, and based on a social cognitive framework that refers to the theories of distributed cognition (Salomon 2001) as well as on Bandura's (1977) social cognitive theory and Vygotsky's zone of proximal development (Vygotsky 1978), Kim and Baylor (2006) sum up that teaching and learning are highly social activities. They conclude that the reason for the weak impact (compared to human tutors) concerning learning outcomes of even the most successful tutoring systems (Koedinger and Anderson 1997) might lie in the lack of empathetic social encouragement and caring aspects. Situated social interaction, as Kim and Baylor argue, can be realized by pedagogical agents that simulate human instructional roles such as teacher or peer. Similarly, Graesser (2006) states that social psychological aspects have to be considered in pedagogical agent research since cognitive representations might be social. He specifies conditions under which more or less social context has to be provided and concludes that the social context of knowledge construction is particularly important when knowledge is vague, open-ended, underspecified, and fragmentary. As a consequence, especially when building computer systems that can conduct effective conversation, the system has to possess basic social abilities in terms of having internal representations of the knowledge, beliefs, goals, intentions, and values of the human user (see Kramer 2008b, who argues in favor of implementing a theory of mind). Although the importance of considering social aspects has thus been acknowledged, and despite the fact that the mere presence of an agent has been assumed to trigger beneficial social, motivational, and cognitive effects, the implications of this kind of embodiment as it has been discussed in social psychology, communication research, and in human-computer interaction have not been discussed explicitly. Two aspects of embodiment that can be relevant in instructional settings, including pedagogical agents, will therefore be described in the following: the impact of both static (appearance) and dynamic (nonverbal) cues. With regard to static cues, we present recent findings from human-computer interaction research, which show that even basic aspects of human-likeness trigger social reactions. Concerning dynamic features of embodiment, we focus on the central role of nonverbal behavior. Static Aspects of Embodiment: The Presence of Social Cues and Their Effects Pedagogical agents have traditionally been expected to transfer the advantages of human human tutoring to computer-supported tutoring. However, to our knowledge, it has not been consequently tested whether the mere presence of social cues when embodying a virtual tutor actually results in tangible social impact. Furthermore, aspects of social perception and motivational effects of agents have not been assessed as consistently as their impact on performance. Within the area of human-computer interaction, social effects of virtual agents have long been described: early evaluation studies of conventional computers characterized by human-like attributes (Reeves and Nass 1996) as well as with embodied conversational agents (Sproull et al. 1996) provided evidence that machines and agents are readily perceived as social entities: even minimal cues and similarity with humans suffice to lead users to show behavior that would be expected in human-human interaction. Besides the fact that virtual characters capture the attention just as real humans do (Dehn and van Mulken 2000), the person perception of these agents was shown to be like that of real humans (Bente et al. 2001). Moreover, cooperation and trust is fostered (Parise et al. 1999; Sproull et al. 1996), tasks are facilitated or inhibited by the "social" presence of a virtual agent (Rickenberg and Reeves 2000), and socially desirable behavior is triggered (Sproull Springer</page><page sequence="7">Educ Psychol Rev (2010) 22:71-87 77 et al. 1996, for a more detailed discussion, see Kramer 2008a). The latter aspect was tested by asking participants to choose from three possibilities to spend their time during a waiting period (watch a documentary on Albert Einstein, watch a James Bond movie, watch whatever is currently on the TV). Participants were more likely to choose the most socially desirable alternative, Albert Einstein, when they were assisted by an anthropomorphic agent as opposed to text or speech output (Kramer et al. 2003a). With regard to users' communicative behavior, it has been shown that the presence of an agent triggers behavior known from human-human dialogue: for example, users are inclined to use a speech interface instead of a non-social technical device such as a remote control (Cassell and Bickmore 2000; Kramer et al. 2003b) and, moreover, employ politeness strategies such as small-talk and etiquette (Kopp et al. 2005; Kramer 2005). In fact, virtual characters that show social facial expressions such as smiling or eyebrow-raising have been found to cause an activation of the same brain regions as those triggered by human-human interaction, whereas meaningless facial movements were not found to result in the activation of these areas (Schilbach et al. 2006). Consistent with the definition of automaticity by Bargh (1994), many of these results suggest that people's reactions to embodied agents are automatic in the sense that they are largely unconscious, efficient, uncontrollable (i.e., cannot be stopped) and unintentional. In fact, Nass et al. (1997) propose that users automatically and unconsciously apply social rules to their interactions with computers due to the fact that humans are inherently social. Nass and Moon (2000) term this phenomenon "ethopoeia" and refer to the theory of mindlessness by Langer (1989). In their "threshold model of social influence", Blascovich et al. (2002) argue similarly that an artificial entity has the capacity to socially influence a recipient in a sustained manner. However, they also pose that the behavioral realism of the agent is an important prerequisite. On the other hand, Kiesler and Sproull (1997) challenge these assumptions and put forward a more cautious explanation for these seemingly social reactions. They suggest that "demand characteristics" of the situation are causative and that people merely act "as though", without attributing humanness and really acting socially. In summary, although it has been shown that agents are actually capable of exerting social influence, the supposition that this is predominantly due to visual social cues is unequivocally supported. Dynamic Aspects of Embodiment: Nonverbal Behavior In the following, we will give an overview of current assumptions on nonverbal behavior. This is done in order to demonstrate the complexity of nonverbal communication and to point to aspects that have so far been neglected when developing and implementing pedagogical agents. Nonverbal behavior has been shown to serve various functions (Bente et al. 2008a) that might facilitate communication within instructional settings. The modeling function, for instance, is addressed when the teacher demonstrates motor tasks (see Rickel and Johnson 1999). Illustrative aspects incorporate pointing gestures or beats in order to stress important information (see Cassell et al. 1999). Particularly in learning situations, the focus of attention plays a major role in establishing shared meaning and mutual understanding (Rickel and Johnson 1999). Less important, although not dispensable, within instructional settings might be the dialogue management function of nonverbal behavior. Here, cues such as gaze or backchanneling behaviors regulate the turn taking processes of the parties involved. Socio-emotional functions are of special importance: specific immediacy cues such as smiling and proximity have been identified, &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="8">78 Educ Psychol Rev (2010) 22:71-87 which affect not only interest and motivation of the student but also learning outcomes within everyday instructional contexts (Andersen 1979). Besides this, nonverbal behavior is described by means of specific attributes: researchers stress the enormous complexity of nonverbal behavior. For instance, in contrast to language, nonverbal behavior is not believed to refer to an explicit semantic code (Kramer 2008c). This is due to several specific characteristics of nonverbal communication that have been distinguished as (a) procedural character/subtle dynamics, (b) context dependency, and (c) production and perception outside of awareness (Kramer 2008c). Concerning (a) the procedural character, recent studies indicate that the quality of a movement may even have a stronger impact on the observers' impressions than so-called semantic aspects, such as a specific posture (Grammer et al. 1999). In particular, subtle physical properties of body and face movements, such as speed, acceleration, dimensional complexity or symmetry, have been shown to be highly influential. With regard to (b) context dependency, both verbal and nonverbal contexts have been shown to modulate the effects of a specific nonverbal signal. For instance, depending on the verbal context, eyebrow-raising can be perceived as a question, an offer, surprise, disbelief, or attention (Chovil 1991). Frey et al. (1983) demonstrated that nonverbal signals can also provide a context for the interpretation of other nonverbal signals: the evaluation of Mona Lisa's smile is dependent on the lateral tilt of her head. Thus, its context dependency in particular renders nonverbal behavior highly equivocal with regard to its effects. Finally, nonverbal behavior is characterized by (c) automaticity, which means that it is largely produced and processed outside of awareness. In line with this, Buck et al. (1992, p. 962) aptly state that nonverbal communication is "conversation between limbic systems." When implementing nonverbal behavior, all of the aforementioned attributes of nonverbal behavior have to be taken into account. Specifically, we suggest implementing more sophisticated and more subtle nonverbal behavior in pedagogical agents in order to provide illustrative, dialogue, and socio-emotional functions. Especially in order to achieve common ground, which has been described as important for pedagogical agents by Graesser et al. (1999) as well as Rickel and Johnson (1999), more natural deictic gestures as well as backchanneling feedback have to be provided. Mapping human behaviors to agents by means of motion capture devices, in order to end up with more natural movements, provides a solution in this respect. Alternatively, human behavior could be videotaped, coded through a detailed time-series notation system, and transferred to virtual characters (see the approach by Bente et al. 2001). The naturalness will be especially important, as nonverbal behavior is processed automatically and might not be processed by the learner's "limbic system" (see above, Buck et al. 1992) if it looks slightly awkward. This is all the more relevant when taking into account the socio-emotional function of nonverbal behavior. In order to compensate for the lack of empathetic social encouragement by pedagogical agents as described by Kim and Baylor (2006), nonverbal behavior must be implemented with all its subtle nuances. With regard to pedagogical agents, it has already been demonstrated and acknowledged that the nonverbal behavior of an embodied agent has sustainable effects (Rickenberg and Reeves 2000, for a summary, cf. Kramer et al. 2007). Concerning movement behavior, it was demonstrated that an agent is evaluated more positively when a subtle behavioral aspect such as head movement activity is increased (Kramer 2001). More specifically with regard to pedagogical agents, Baylor and Kim (2008) showed that the effects of nonverbal behavior are dependent on the task: facial expressions were particularly valuable for attitudinal learning, but detrimental for procedural learning. Kim (2004) provided evidence that a pedagogical agent displaying positive facial expressions was experienced as more facilitative to learning, and motivated Springer</page><page sequence="9">Educ Psychol Rev (2010) 22:71-87 79 the learners more strongly to carry on with the task. This is in line with recent findings from embodied agent research that agents are able to influence the human partner's mood in the interaction: a virtual TV/VC'R assistant evoked less anger and a more positive mood when informing about a mistake compared to when the news was provided by conventional text or an audio-based system (Kramer et al. 2003b). Kim and Baylor (2006) therefore suggested leveraging agents' nonverbal behavior to elicit emotions like interest, curiosity, or excitement in order to potentially influence learning and motivation. Kim (2004) had already demonstrated that when the agent "empathetically" matched the learner's emotion, the students showed more interest and higher self-efficacy. To enable the agent's behavior to be tailored to the specific situation, however, the system must (a) be able to recognize the emotional state of the learner (Craig et al. 2004), and (b) know how to respond, that is, which nonverbal cues of the agent have which effects. Indeed, this is no small feat given the characteristics of nonverbal communication as depicted above. The former aspect has recently been focused on by Graesser et al. (2007), who have begun to design AutoTutor to be able to adapt not only to the learners' cognitive states but also to their affective states. The methodological prerequisites for assessing the learner's emotions (Graesser et al. 2008) are presented and discussed below. Measurement Issues: Towards the Assessment of Social Aspects and Adaptivity So far, research on pedagogical agents has primarily focused on outcome measures: either on performance parameters or on post-hoc assessments of motivation or experiences (see, e.g., Ryu and Baylor 2005, for a standardized instrument on the perception of the agent persona). However, in order to assess social effects of pedagogical agents and to continuously monitor the affective impact of agents' nonverbal behavior, process measures have to be introduced to the research area of pedagogical agents to complement outcome measures. This is even more important when trying to develop adaptive agents. To enable the agent's behavior to be tailored appropriately to the specific state and current needs of the learner, it is important to (automatically) assess these learner states. In the following, we present an overview of objective, non-obtrusive process measures of motivational, emotional, and social aspects as they are already utilized, for instance, by the tutoring research group (Craig et al. 2007) and in the context of serious gaming. With regard to the latter area of research, Bente and Breuer (2009) describe implicit measures of the user's arousal, attention, and social relations in order to tailor and adjust games to users' cognitive, emotional, and relational states, and thus foster the improvement of user skills without boring or overburdening them. Along the same lines, Shute et al. (2009) propose so-called stealth assessments, which are capable of accurately monitoring students' cognitive and non-cognitive abilities over time, and thus enable the game environment to be adjusted to support learning by seamlessly aligning the story and lesson. Indeed, computer-supported learning environments in particular provide excellent opportunities to record, store, and analyze data on psychological phenomena that are beyond the scope of non-mediated learning environments. Thus, relevant psychological phenomena, which under usual conditions remain implicit because they are hidden (e.g., arousal states, evaluations, moods, thoughts, attitudes), hard to aggregate (e.g., interaction patterns, group structures), or ambiguous (e.g., nonverbal behavior, facial displays, silence), can be made explicit and thus taken into account (see Bente and Breuer 2009). With regard to visual behavior, eye movement, pupil dilation, or blink rates can be objectively measured in order to capture cognitive processes accompanying the learning Springer</page><page sequence="10">80 Educ Psychol Rev (2010) 22:71-87 process, such as mental workload, attention, and information processing (Partala and Surakka 2003). Additionally, psychophysiological responses can provide insights into emotional arousal and modes of information processing during media usage (see, e.g., Fairclough et al. 2005; Blascovich et al. 2004). With regard to learning, there is evidence, for example, that learning might be facilitated by higher arousal, which results from a social situation (Okita et al. 2008). Facial expressions can be used to assess the learner's affective states. For instance, technologies developed by Essa (1995) or Wehrle et al. (2000) measure facial displays automatically and based on the facial action coding system (FACS), and relate them to affective states. By correlating emotive utterances and FACS codings, Craig et al. (2007) identified facial displays that are related to confusion, frustration and boredom. Finally, Graesser et al. (2008) use the "emote aloud" procedure as a manifestation of the emotions that the learner is experiencing: Learners speak out loud whatever emotions come to mind while interacting with a learning environment. These "emotes" are then classified into theoretical categories of emotions by trained experts. However, to enable AutoTutor to potentially respond to learners' emotions, an automated affect classifier is needed. Thus, Graesser et al. (2008) tried to unravel the systematic relations between specific characteristics of dialogue (AutoTutor's feedback, the directness of AutoTutor's dialogue moves, the quality and verbosity of the learner's contributions) and particular emotions that are manifested in the emote-aloud protocols. The authors established significant correlations for confusion, eureka experiences, and frustration. Confusion is negatively correlated with positive feedback or assertion from the tutor and positively correlated with hints. Eureka shows a strong relationship with both positive and negative feedback, and frustration is negatively correlated with positive feedback from the tutor. Conclusion Based on a brief summary of current agent systems, corresponding visions, and a summary of results concerning the effects of pedagogical agents, we attempted to highlight aspects that have thus far been neglected in pedagogical agent research. Although nonverbal communication is consensually described as holding a huge potential for agent systems, current technical implementations remain a long way from matching the complexity and subtlety of real-life nonverbal behavior. Especially in order to be able to use nonverbal cues to achieve common ground and to provide socio-emotional information, the agents' nonverbal abilities have to be improved. This could be accomplished, for example, by employing motion-captured human movements. More sophisticated agent technologies might enhance the expected emotional and social effects. These social effects in particular can be assumed to be a crucial moderating variable in the process of facilitating learning (see, e.g., the social presence concept of Blascovich et al. 2002), but have not been rigorously assessed; hence, when analyzing the effects of pedagogical agents, social effects or social presence are rarely measured. It is therefore unclear whether insignificant effects of pedagogical agents on learning are due to the fact that the agents do not (yet) exert a social influence, or whether even if agents do lead to social effects, they do not foster learning. In order to assess the emotional effects of nonverbal communication and to verify whether social influence occurs, we suggest additionally employing process measures instead of merely using outcome measures. Measuring several aspects continuously will help to further clarify the mechanisms of the agent's influence on the learner. Such data will also help to shed light on the question of •£j Springer</page><page sequence="11">Educ Psychol Rev (2010) 22:71-87 81 whether learning effects are caused by increased motivation or whether cognitive aspects are influenced more directly. Most importantly, however, process measurements are a prerequisite for the development of adaptive agents. In this respect, first steps have already been taken, for example with regard to the automatic inference of learners' emotional states (Graesser et al. 2008). However, in order to tailor the agent behavior to the learner's motivational, emotional, and cognitive state, greater efforts still need to be undertaken. Commentary by Detlev Leutner and Joachim Wirth The fundamental idea of this paper is that the effectiveness of instructional communications may be improved by augmenting e-learning environments with embodied virtual pedagogical agents. The improvement is expected to occur because an instructional communication that is delivered by a virtual pedagogical agent is suggested to positively affect a student's motivation to learn, which in turn is suggested to lead to improved learning outcomes. The authors state that the virtual pedagogical agent should be embodied to enable the use of nonverbal behavior, which fosters students' learning. In the paper, underpinnings are provided from social psychological research on nonverbal communica tion as well as research into the social effects of embodied agents. Whereas research findings on the effects of virtual pedagogical agents are mixed, the authors suggest that attention should be drawn not only to cognitive learning outcomes, but also to motivational and emotional effects. To this aim, their paper focuses on static and dynamic aspects of embodiment and the functions of embodiment and nonverbal behavior in social interaction. Furthermore, to enable adaptive pedagogical agents, the authors suggest that research should focus more on process than outcome measures of successful instructional communication. From an instructional psychology point of view, it seems interesting to improve an e-learning environment by augmenting it with embodied virtual pedagogical agents, which affect a student's emotions and motivation to learn by means of nonverbal behavior. Such an implementation would be a consequent generalization of the idea of intelligent tutoring, bringing more communication channels into play than written on screen text, spoken text, and pictures or graphics only. This would be fully in line with the ancient vision of Skinner (1954) of an effective private teacher for every student. However, can this vision be achieved by such agents? The authors show that research has made progress concerning motivational and emotional aspects of the vision. However, if we take a purely cognitive instructional psychology perspective, there seem to be at least two basic questions to be discussed: (1) what kind of instructional function can effectively be complemented by embodied pedagogical agents? (2) What happens when the agent imposes extraneous cognitive load on the learner, for example due to specific characteristics of its implementation? Instructional functions to be complemented by embodied pedagogical agents Referring to a cognitive model of learning such as information processing, successful learning involves selecting, organizing, and integrating information, storing information in and retrieving it from memory, as well as transferring knowledge in order to solve new problems. Furthermore, learners have to be motivated to undertake all of the aforemen tioned aspects, and they have to monitor and regulate the whole learning process. If they are Springer</page><page sequence="12">82 Educ Psychol Rev (2010) 22:71-87 unable to do so by themselves, or in other words if they are not effective self regulated learners (Leutner et al. 2007), they will need assistance. They will require a teacher who fulfills all of the learning functions (motivation, information, information processing, storage and retrieval, application and transfer, monitoring and directing, Klauer 1985) as teaching functions. Of course, these teaching functions can also be provided by an e-learning environment (Leutner 2004). In such a learning environment, pedagogical agents would therefore have to fulfill specific teaching functions that are not met by the learners themselves. In their paper, Kramer and Bente focus on emotional and motivational effects of pedagogical agents. Pedagogical agents are primarily expected to fulfill the teaching function of motivation. Indeed, motivation is necessary at all stages of the learning process: students have to be motivated to select and further process information, to store and retrieve information from memory, and to transfer knowledge to new problems. From a purely cognitive information processing perspective, a pedagogical agent can provide the learner with new information, pose questions and give feedback in order to induce deeper information processing, call for deliberate practice in order to exercise storage and retrieval, or set the learner transfer problems to be solved. In an e-learning environment, all of these teaching functions can also be fulfilled without a pedagogical agent. Thus, an open question for further research concerns what the added value of a pedagogical agent is with regard to specific teaching functions. Although it is interesting to assume a general social communication perspective on teaching (including teachers' nonverbal behavior and its effects on students), as the authors did in this case, from an instructional psychology point of view, it would be fruitful to think about the arrangement and the effects of specific kinds of teacher communications (including specific kinds of nonverbal behavior) in order to fulfill specific types of teaching functions (see e.g. research on the effects of gesture, Alibali and Nathan 2007). Thus, research should also be encouraged that incorporates measures for learning outcome. Much of the research cited by Kramer and Bente investigated aspects of social communication without any regard to learning, meaning that it is essentially research on person-agent interaction but not on pedagogical agents. Cognitive load potentially imposed by pedagogical agents Compared to traditional e-learning materials (such as text and pictures, presented in a visual format on screen, or sound, presented in an auditory format), pedagogical agents provide an additional source of meaningful information using both visual and auditoiy presentation formats. Thus, pedagogical agents attract learners' attention: on the one hand, this can have advantageous consequences, but on the other hand, the agents therefore compete for learners' resources in terms of working memory. For example, Kramer and Bente refer to research by Moreno (see Moreno and Mayer 2007, for an overview), which shows that it is sometimes better to abandon the visual display of a pedagogical agent and only provide learners with what the agent says in auditory form. Thus, in line with cognitive load theory (Sweller 1994), the visual display of the pedagogical agent can impose "extraneous" cognitive load, which hampers learning (Paas et al. 2003). Kramer and Bente, however, claim that well-designed pedagogical agents would not contribute to extraneous cognitive load. On the contrary, in terms of cognitive load theory, a well-designed pedagogical agent can be expected to positively affect germane cognitive load by increasing learners' cognitive effort (Paas and van Merrienboer 1993) based on positive emotions and increased learning motivation. However, for a given e-learning environment with a given pedagogical •£] Springer</page><page sequence="13">Educ Psychol Rev (2010) 22:71-87 83 agent, it is an open question whether advantages concerning germane cognitive load are potentially overridden by disadvantages concerning extraneous cognitive load. Another aspect of pedagogical agents can also be reframed in terms of cognitive load theory. Kramer and Bente state that nonverbal behavior displayed by an embodied pedagogical agent can be good or bad, depending on implementation. For example, if an agent behaves in a way that is perceived as somewhat strange by learners, this thinking about strangeness requires cognitive resources, and consequently imposes extraneous cognitive load in working memory. Future research should examine the extent to which learners are able to adapt to implementation problems relating to the ecological validity of embodiment. Summary Implementing embodied pedagogical agents seems to be a promising option for improving e-learning environments. Effects can be expected on the emotional and motivational level, albeit depending on the quality of implementation. On the one hand, effects on cognitive learning outcomes can be expected to depend on the specific type of cognitive load imposed on the learner when processing the information provided by the agent. On the other hand, the effect of a specific pedagogical agent in a specific e-learning environment is expected to depend on the specific kind of teaching function that the agent is designed to fulfill in order to help students learn. From an instructional psychology point of view, it seems to be a great challenge to design pedagogical agents that are able to diagnose students' emotional and motivational states based on process measures in order to adapt their instructional behavior.
