<plain_text><page sequence="1">SEMANTICS AS SOCIAL EVASION MARGARET SCHLAUCH of unease are apt to engender proponents of facile remedies, and our own age sees no lack of vendors for spiritual nostrums. At the moment, it is language that is being scanned with new hope by those questing for unarduous solu- tions to our problems. One particular department of linguistic study, namely semantics,1 has attracted an unusual amount of atten- tion in America; preoccupation with this "new" subject has become in fact something of an intellectual fad. The term "semantics" is indeed being used with some of the rapt solemnity more properly associated with tribal cults and shaman's magic. Absurd claims are put forward for this discipline by non-specialists, and an eager if unfounded optimism is evoked in wide circles of the reading public. There are distinct elements of danger in this optimism, as there must be, indeed, in any hope which has not first looked the menace of actuality in the face. It is rightful, of course, to relate present tragedies in some manner to the inadequacies of communication by speech. All of us know by experience that language is only partially successful in the task for which we employ it: mutual understanding among human beings. No two of us speaking animals can possibly have the same chronicle of experience behind us when we talk; hence no two of us can use any single word with the same heritage of connotations. Hermann Paul referred to this condition when he said that every word is a new creation every time an individual uses it.2 And for some words, we must admit, there is a deplorable lack of similarity in the surrounding connotations of various individual speakers. Try lThis discussion of recent work on semantics is expanded from brief passages in the present author's book The Gift of Tongues (New York: Modern Age, 1942), ch. 5, p. 128 ff. 2 Prinzipien der Sprachgeschichte (5th ed., Halle, 1920), p. 18. This lack of exact correspondence in the multiple individual usages of the word is the general source of semantic change. Cf. Paul's remark: "Die Sprachveränderungen vollziehen sich an dem Individuum teils durch seine spontane Tätigkeit, teils durch Sprechen und Denken in den Formen der Sprache, teils durch the Beeinflussung, die es von den anderen Individuen erleidet," ibid., p. 34. 315</page><page sequence="2">316 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY to pin down your friends and colleagues to explanations of emotional attitudes as well as definitions when they use words like "race" or "democracy'* or "dictatorship," and you will find lack of coincidence of meaning even among the most sophisticated. This divergence will still be noticeable in more concrete phrases such as "racial char- acteristics," "democratic procedure" and "dictatorship of finance capital." Under certain circumstances the linguistic divergences may find expression in physical violence. But there is one important factor which must not be ignored in the heat of conflicting defini- tions or of blows: the maladjustment in understanding which sends some disputants to the dictionary and others to "settle the matter outside" has its origin somewhere in actual human experience. It is not merely verbal in either cause or effect, though it may find verbal expression- among others. Consequently there is more than verbal adjustment necessary to bring about a cure. This correlation with maladjustments in the objective world is what the liguistic shamans tend to ignore or oversimplify. Their intentions may be of the best, but their leadership is dangerous. They are most effective in pointing out to us how little we under- stand one another. But their cry is: "Don't despair, boys; cheer up. All we need is to get together and define our terms! Semantics- that's what we need!" A sober onlooker in the Vanity Fair of 1942, an observer with some perception of the intricate ugliness now threatening our very existence, will be reminded of the cheerful cries of a hawker vending panaceas at a circus. Yet we clearly need more than linguistic analysis, alas! to make us whole. I Among the proponents of salvation by way of semantics none is more vocal, nor it may well be more influential, than Alfred Kor- zybski. His ambitious opus, Science and Sanity, occupies almost 800 pages of text, not counting a new introduction of 49 pages written for the second edition.3 The book is an elaboration of the thesis that we must revise our science of meanings in accordance with the new, non- Aristotelian, non-Euclidean, non-Newtonian universe of modern science. Our awareness of ordinary speech must catch up with the 3 Alfred Korzybski, Science and Sanity: An Introduction to non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics (Lancaster and New York: The International non-Aristotelian Library Publishing Co., 1941).</page><page sequence="3">SEMANTICS AS SOCIAL EVASION 317 implications now familiar only to an Einstein. (This is, to begin with, a debatable question.) If we bring this about, the revision will confer vast benefits on the study of biology, psycho-logy (for thus Korzbyski affects to spell the word), physiology, mathematics, linguistics and other disciplines. It will also cure certain types of insanity and go a far way towards curing our social ills. With envi- able confidence, Korzybski offers to lead us into the Paradise of proper understanding. He is presenting us with a variant of the familiar exhortation: Let us clear up our definitions and all will be well. For all of his pretentious terminology, Korzybski's suggestions are really quite simple; his charts and formulas and diagrams embody little more than truisms. They are built on a phrase which is, to be sure, quite useful in itself: namely the "levels of abstraction* ' involved in the terms we employ. Starting with a specific object- let us say, a pencil-, our author defines it non-Newtonianly as a "space- time-event." Next comes the object as we know it and handle it in everyday life; the ineffable thing, not the linguistic label. Still more remote from the space-time-" event" (or process) is the word "pencil," a conventional abstract symbol. We could go even farther and, under certain circumstances, create an abstraction "pencilness," which would lead us into a kind of philosophic mythology. The important problem is to discriminate the levels of abstraction while we use the conventional lables constituting language. Our failure to do this is the cause of our socio-psycho-biological ills, because it leads to a confusion of our "semantic reactions." We use "multi-ordinal" and "over/ under-defined" terms- or, as ordinary folk would say, ambiguous ones. We permit ourselves to be tricked into violent emotional responses by our failure to distinguish the level of the term heard or spoken. What is "flag" to one person, with all the complex and intense responses associated with it, may be just "piece of cloth" to another, who classifies the term on a lower level of abstraction. A kick may be an ordinary kick or, if directed at a special rank of person, an insult to the "honor" of a state. Korzybski's commonplace thesis that "the label is not the thing" (or feeling or experience) is repeated and illustrated many times. It is the basis of his claim to a non-Aristotelian way of thinking. Every sentence containing the "is" of identity is dismissed as mis- leading, as false to experience since it does, according to him, imply</page><page sequence="4">318 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY an identification of label and object. But does it? Surely Aristotle was not guilty of such a childish error. This is not the place to enter into an exposition of Aristotle's position, but at least it may be said that in general Korzybski's pre- sentation of it is unjust because it is repeatedly oversimplified. "In a non-Aristotelian orientation," the new edition of Science and Sanity assures us, "we ask for actual facts, and do not accept mere verbalism/' 4 But even the severest critics of Aristotle would hesitate to imply that he was guilty of accepting mere verbalisml Many of the other distinctions between "Old Aristotelian Orientations (350 B.C.)" and "New General Semantic non-Aristotelian Orientations (1941 A.C.)" in a lengthy double list of contrasts by Korzybski5 are likewise either unfair or irrelevant to the linguistic problem of semanics. Aristotelianism is characterized by "methods of magic (self-deception)" as opposed to "elimination of self-deception" under non-Aristotelian orientation; by " 'emotion' and 'intellect' " as opposed to "semantic reactions"; by "anthropomorphic" something- or-other (the noun being omitted here in a list otherwise made up of nouns- a curious lapse from logical symmetry), as opposed to "non-anthropomophic" something-or-other; by "primitive static 'science' (religions)" as opposed to "modern dynamic 'religions' (science)';' by "avoiding empirical paradoxes" as opposed to "facing empirical paradoxes," and so on. Some of these contrasts may be just, but many are too general to be meaningful and others are clear- ly unjust to Aristotle. They are in fact a repetious statement that Aristotelianism is inadequate in every sense, while the "non-Aris- totelian orientation" is, in every sense, completely adequate. All that is A is bad; all that is non-Α is good, to put it baldly. It may be remarked in passing that Korzybski's frequent invoca- tions of modern physicists and mathematicians is as inaccurate as his easy dismissal of Aristotle. He goes so far as to state that we live in a "four-dimensional world" merely because space and time can not be separated in our thinking.6 This is a misuse, or at best a mere metaphoric use, of a technical phrase borrowed from mathe- matics. To say that man is a "time-binding animal" because he has * Science and Sanity (1941), p. xliü. β Ibid,, p. xx-xxiii. tlbid., p. 184.</page><page sequence="5">SEMANTICS AS SOCIAL EVASION 319 memory does not justify the claim to an Einsteinian approach. It is rather an attempt to conceal truism behind pretentious terminology. Korzybski's positive claims are even more sweeping than his nega- tive criticisms. It is here that his influence may become actually dangerous. Linguistic maladjustments, he says, have led to "univer- sal disagreement" of the nervous system with its environment. In individual life this led to pathological conflicts with ourselves; in private life, to family strifes and unhappiness, and so to nervous dis- turbances; in national life to political strifes, revolutions ... ; in interna- tional affairs, to mutual misunderstandings, suspicion, impossibility to agree, wars, world wars, 'trade wars' . . . , ultimately ending in slaughter, general unrest, worry, confusion, and suffering in different degrees for all, helping again to disturb the proper working of the human nervious system.7 If our woes, then, are fundamentally neuro-semantic afflictions, perhaps we can cure them by corrective linguistic exercises: by sepa- ration of label from thing; by avoidance of "multi-ordinal terms" and the "is" of identity; by sharp discrimination of the levels of abstrac- tion; by dating all affirmations in order to bring in the time element. "In our lives," remarks Korzybski, "most of our miseries do not originate in the field where the terms 'true* and 'false* apply, but in the field where they do not apply: namely, in the immense region of proportional function and meaninglessness, where agreement must fail." 8 The social implications of this are serious enough to warrant fur- ther comment. If "cash" is a high-order abstraction, as Korzybski thinks, it becomes easier to persuade workers with less of it in the specific form of wages. Money is regarded as "a symbol for all human time-binding characteristics," 9 unreal and therefore negligi- ble. Thus readily-and dangerously- may pivotal social issues be thrust aside; worse still, thus easily is semantic doctrine adaptable as a narcotic, an instrument of reaction. That the fanatical and ignorant attack on the theory of evolution should have occurred may be pathetic, but need concern us little, as such ignorant attacks are always liable to occur. But that biologists should 7 Ibid., p. 45 f. 8 Ibid., p. 142. 9 Ibid., p. 549.</page><page sequence="6">320 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY offer "defenses," based on the confusion of orders of abstractions, and that "philosophers" should have failed to see this simple dependence is rather sad.10 The words I have taken the liberty of italicizing betray the dangers of Korzybski's whole approach. The poor ye have always with you- and the ignorant. They will be with us indeed if we are content to look upon "cash" merely as a high-order abstraction, and upon aggressive ignorance as a permanent state which "need concern us little"; so little that we do not inquire about its causes. Those causes lie in the sphere of correctible social abuses. "Such ignorant attacks" as resulted in the Scopes trial do not have to occur. But the semanticist who trusts entirely to the art of definition concludes that they must. He even appears reconciled to the necessity. Thus he unconsciously aligns himself with reaction in the end, and per- mits his whole doctrine to serve its purposes. The inadequacy of Korzybski's method appears most glaringly in his analysis of the contemporary phenomenon of National Social- ism in the recent edition of his book. "The beginning," he tells us, "was 'mental' illness of a few leaders [but was it?], based on hates, fears, revenges, etc." Such leaders abuse language in a war of nerves which employs "screaming" bombs, verbal distortion, the "psychology" of deception, etc. These methods can be counteracted only when governments who feel their responsibility not only to the ruling classes, but also to the people of their nations, will employ experts in neuro-psychiatry, anthro- pology, general semantics, etc., for guidance, if the present world neurosis is to be checked.11 We are assured that the Mikado of Japan must receive a seman- tically edited version of events in China- the "murder, rape, looting and drugging"- else he would not approve it; and we are treated to a brief explanation of Hitler's rôle in history which is limited almost entirely to personal gossip, a few generalities about totalitarian "egos," and some Biblical excerpts to illustrate the Jehovah com- 10 ibid., p. 166. 11 Ibid., p. xxxix.</page><page sequence="7">SEMANTICS AS SOCIAL EVASION 321 plex.12 The author laments that in September, 1939, he made constructive suggestions to some leading governments, "urging the employment of permanent boards of neuro-psychiatrists, psycho- logicians, and other specialists, to counteract similar dangers'* in connection with our neuro-semantic and neuro-linguistic mechan- isms. But alas! This warning of his elicited only two polite answers from the governments approached; specialists also ignored it, and so (concludes our Cassandra)- we have the known disastrous results.13 The factors omitted by Korzybski cry aloud for recognition. Rarely, and then in a most perfunctory manner, does he indicate the basic importance of class conflicts and the rivalry of empires. Only the vaguest indications are made concerning eradicable con- crete maladjustments in the objective world, such as unequal dis- tribution of income, exportation of capital to helpless "backward" countries, international trade competition, and recurring crises and periods of unemployment, which are the causes of insecurity lead- ing to psychological ills. Exorcism seems the easier when these problems are treated as primarily linguistic. We are invited to cure them all by semantic exercises. But if we permit ourselves to take this invitation seriously we shall most surely fall victim to the ruth- less, practical, bloody foe, the band of organized fascists who employ not only language but also, unfortunately, the steel instruments of conquest and oppression with an unparalleled contempt for the niceties of language and in fact all humane scruples.14 12 For the discussion of the Mikado, see p. viii; for Hitler, p. xli-xliii. At the end of the latter exposition, Korzybski modestly says: "These suggestions are given to indi- cate how psychiatrists can help future historians." Any one of them could have been made by the most unskilled layman. 13 Ibid., p. xlv-xlviii. 14 There are a number of subsidiary issues upon which Korzybski may be charged with unscientific doctrine, for instance his treatment of race and intelligence. His fulsome praise of Spengler's proto-fascist Decline of the West (p. 47 if.) is indicative. He implies that lhe inestimable benefits to be derived from his - Korzybski's - teachings are beyond the capacities of persons with pigmented epidermis: "When all is said and done, one cannot but see, at least as far as the white race is concerned, that a change from an A (Aristotelian) to a - A [non - Aristotelian] system must be momentous" (p. 52, italics mine). Moreover, he informs us that the work of Aristotle and his followers "has had an unprecedented influence upon the development of the Aryan race" (p. 85 f.)- an exclusive statement which strangely ignores the conspicuous interest of the Spanish Arabs (Semites!) in Aristotelian thought. Such careless statements, obviously colored by race prejudice, are sufficient to impugn Korzybski's authenticity as a social philosopher.</page><page sequence="8">322 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY II Korzybski's influence is due less to his ponderous writings (which few read) than to this popularizers. One of the first to proclaim the master's evangel was Stuart Chase, in an adulatory volume called The Tyranny of Words.15 Here the warnings against abstract nouns are almost tantamount to a tabu on their use. The examples of their misuse are both apt and distressing, to be sure, but some of the deductions about them are surprising, to say the least. "Something has perverted human-survival behavior," Chase says. "I assume that it is a temporary perversion. I assume that it is bound up to some extent with an unconscious misuse of man's most human attributes- thinking and its tool, language." Because we are such slaves of abstract nouns or linguistic symbols, however, which embody abstract principles, we have been condemning ourselves to worsen- ing evils and despair. And that would appear to be the sum total of the problem. If Americans were devoid of rigid principles, it is conceivable that poverty would have been virtually liquidated about 1925, when mass production became a dominant element in the manufacture of goods; that the great depression would not have taken place; that the so-called Supreme Court crisis would not have arisen; that the labor situation would not have become acute; that the prospects of a war involving this country would be fantastically remote [as of 1938]; that the Democratic and Republican parties would be extinct; and that we could go peaceably about our business of improving our relations to the environment about us.16 Not a word in all this about the very specific monopolies and other organizational forms of capitalism today which cause and foster that rigidity of principles as their greatest protection against change- both on the linguistic and practical levels of experience. Chase exorcises fascism (an abstract noun) by a triumphant proof that people don't know what they mean when they use the word. His deduction is that we must avoid the abstract noun and concen- trate on individuals: don't fight "fascism" but "fascists." But in so doing we may be defeating our own ends. An abstract formulation iß Stuart Chase, The Tyranny of Words (New York, 1938). Chase also acknowledges indebtedness to P. W. Bridgman, I. A. Richards, C. K. Ogden and Thurman Arnold. 16 Ibid., p. 115.</page><page sequence="9">SEMANTICS AS SOCIAL EVASION 323 need not be meaningless. It may be necessary. Unless we can give a clear analysis of the forces involved, remembering their origins in concrete reality, we may find ourselves administering a resounding defeat to "fascists" abroad and yet eventually succumbing to their spiritual kin at home because we fail to recognize the identical philosophy. "Capitalism" is another abstract noun dismissed by Chase with a magician's wave of the hand. What does it mean? "I used to believe that I knew," says Chase, "but that was before I took up semanics"! (An eloquent commentary, this!) Perhaps the term does save breath, he concedes, in substituting for a long list of descriptive characteristics; still, that doesn't mean that it has meaning. "What kind of 'capitalism' is it when managers of great corporations, often not owning a share of stock, override and sometimes fleece the legal stockholders?" The question is supposed to be unanswerable. It appears that a friend of Mr. Chase once sent a research worker to the New York Public Library to get him a good definition of capital- ism, and the poor fellow was more confused than ever after two weeks of study. . . . But "why worry a dead bone?" asks Chase. It is such a relief to learn that we need not be distressed about capitalism any longer because a research worker can't find a good definition for it! 17 Now Chase uses this difficulty in defining "capitalism" as a chief basis of attack against the Marxist analysis. He tends to ignore, how- ever, the care with which Marxist economists discriminate specific phases in a general complex development which, for purposes of convenience, may still be called capitalism. They retain the general term but introduce limitations such as "merchant" capitalism, "finance" capitalism, and so on. They observe a technique of dis- crimination which enables language to deal with changing historical situations; and their cited material is habitually dated and placed in specific periods in a manner to satisfy the most exigent Korzybskian. Hence they are in a position to draw usable deductions. A petty- bourgeois semanticist like Chase on the other hand, throws up his hands in despair. He gives us chapters inviting us to dance to the left with one group of economists and to the right with another, as if the whole matter were a mad Walpurgisnacht without meaning. 17 Ibid., p. 279 f.</page><page sequence="10">324 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY Because terms and referents change in changing historical situations, he will have to do with nothing but particulars- and stable ones, at that. In rejecting economic theory he has rejected the linguistic tools which will enable him to deal with the problems of an eco- nomic system like ours which is at once declining and transforming itself rapidly. His method will work only when he is so fortunate as to deal with comparatively stable systems. Thus language is made an excuse for adhering to piecemeal reform, unintegrated in a larger scheme. Some of the more popular studies in semantics by Hugh Wal- pole,18 S. I. Hayakawa lö and Irving J. Lee 20 are more modest in scope and therefore less open to the reproach of dismissing acute problems airily or of offering inadequate solutions for them. Walpole's book, in fact, does not claim to do more than expound on certain problems in the art of definition, following upon the dis- tinctions made by I. A. Richards and C. K. Ogden some years ago.21 Hayakawa and Lee are closer to Korzybski. They not only repro- duce his terminology, but also repeat many of his examples and parables with but slight variation. Both use lively and apt illus- trative material of their own in addition, taken with hospitable inclusiveness from many types of contemporary sources. Lee's book is besides adorned with graphic figures to make still more patent the familiar transparent principles. The antifascist position of both these authors is firmer and more forthright than that of their master: they avoid unfortunate references to ' 'white' ' or "Aryan" races as exclusive inheritors of any special type of intellectual prowess, and at the same time they use the master's simple techniques commend- ably to reveal fallacies in Nazi demagogy.22 18 Semantics: The Nature of Words and Their Meanings (New York, 1941). 19 Language in Action (New York, 1940). 20 Language Habits in Human Affairs (New York, 1941). 21 The Meaning of Meaning (New York, 1923). Walpole reproduces and explains the "semantic triangle" first clarified in this book: the "word," the "referent" or object to which it refers, and the "reference" or complex of thought, emotions, memo- ries, etc., called up in the hearer's mind by the stimulus of the word. He deduces methods of definition from this general speech situation. Like Korzybski, he gives salutory stress to the distinction between word and object; but the contribution made by him lies more in manner than in the matter presented. 22 See Hayakawa, op. cit., p. 170 ff. and 180 if.; Lee, op. cit., p. 19, 60 and 100. Lee deals more often and more explicitly than Hayakawa with the conscious semantic malpractices of the fascists.</page><page sequence="11">SEMANTICS AS SOCIAL EVASION 325 Nevertheless these well-intentioned writers are faulty guides insofar as they attempt to analyze present abuses and suggest their linguistic cure. The fault lies, once again, in omissions. Too often we are given the impression, indirectly, that linguistic adjustments are all we need. In explaining "intensional orientation" (that is, use of undefined terms charged with emotional connotations) Hayakawa says: Although in real life communists are sometimes charming epople, they are never presented as such, because in the light of intensional orienta- tions, anyone called "communist" cannot at the same time be "charm- ing." Although in real life Negroes often occupy positions of dignity and professional responsibility, in magazine stories they are never per- mitted to appear except as comic characters or as servants, because, by intensional orientation, Negroes should never be anything else.23 Here (as in Chase) there is not even an indirect allusion to the causes of the intensional orientation, and to the need, therefore, for something more than language therapy to solve a situation involving class interests, the nature of the state, exploitation, and a legacy of fear on the part of rulers inheried from the days of slavery. At an- other point Hayakawa wonders why it is that we tend to take action always too late for effectiveness, whether it be in war preparations, conservation of soil and forests, or protection of our Indian popula- tion. His analysis leaves much to be desired: What prevents us from acting? First of all, of course, there is the inertia which makes us prefer the evils that we have over others that we know not of. But our national resistance to any and all changes involves more than that; it has elements of pathology in it.24 Again, no reference to the conscious sabotage of national defense by industrialists over-eager for assured profits, or to the specific groups which resisted legislation to protect natural resources and Indians' rights because of their own acquisitive interests. Lee also tends to formulate our problems exclusively as instances of faulty communication, without reference to mundane determinants in the realm of economics: And when men's eyes are lifted from the variety of things to the phan- 23 Hayakawa, op. cit., p. 230. 24 ibid., p. 242 f.</page><page sequence="12">326 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY tasms made by few-valued utterances, then books are burned, heretics are lashed, concentration camps filled, pogroms organized, and terrors unleashed, for somehow it has never seemed easier to fight with more fury than when facts give way to exhortations.25 At our risk we forget that behind the "few-valued utterances" of Hitler, at the height of his demagogy before 1933, there were quite calm, hard-headed, undemagogic backers like Krupp, men who had been paying for brown-shirted uniforms and printing and pub- licity with cold cash for some years. Their part in the rise of Hitler was something more than linguistic misunderstanding; they prompted the semantic malpractices but were themselves apart and largely undeceived (if not entirely, we must admit) about the demagogue they subsidized. To ignore them in analyses like these is to misstate the problem; to lead us astray where we most need guidance . Ill On a distinctly higher level than all this, scientists and philoso- phers have also been scrutinizing language to find where it is inade- quate to the modern concepts of the universe. Some writers proceed from this point to suggest that a revised approach to terminology and definition will have desirable sociological consequences; and again we find (less obviously, perhaps) that the non-linguistic elements in the situation are dangerously ignored. The need for semantic housecleaning is, to be sure, clear enough for persons who find themselves using everyday words like "time" and "space" and "identity" in contexts of advanced research in physics. When a modern physicist tries to initiate outsiders into his universe, he must engage in a task of helping them to redefine. Professor P. W. Bridgman has written a very influential essay which deals with the problem of the redefinition of basic concepts.26 Here he came to the challenging conclusion, important for students of semantics, that "the concept is synonymous with the correspond- ing set of operations " by which you verify it: for example, the opera- tions of measuring a rod which itself baffles you constantly by expanding, contracting, lengthening and shortening (because of alti- 25 Lee, op. cit., p. 105. See also p. 127 for an example of superficial analysis: wars and other disasters are explained in terms of "intensional orientation/ 2β The Logic of Modern Physics (New York, 1933)-</page><page sequence="13">SEMANTICS AS SOCIAL EVASION 327 tude, velocity and so on), even while you are engaged in operating on it. He also pointed out how some of our basic concepts in ordinary life, such as time, space and causality, tend to fuse as we approach the "experimentally obtainable limit/' Here time and space become inextricably bound up, and conventional terminology ceases to be adequate. One of the results of defining by operation, according to Bridgman, is the elimination of certain pseudo-concepts as mean- ingless. Just because a word is used with conviction we need not assume that it stands for a concept which can be subjected to mean- ingful operations as a check. It is possible to put together two or more words in such a way that they fail to give any meaning in the operational sense. These "footless concepts" of Bridgman corre- spond to the terms designated less elegantly as "blah" by Korzybski and Stuart Chase. Questions based on them are meaningless and may be set aside. An example would be speculation as to whether the solar system, in moving from one part of space to another, changes its "absolute" scale of magnitude in such a way that all things are affected equally. Such speculation is senseless as far as we are con- cerned, because we could not possibly be aware of the shrinking or expanding; no operations would reveal them to us. So far, so good. Emboldened by the undoubted clarifications resulting from operational definition, . Bridgman next proceeds to apply his method to social problems. And it is here that a conspicu- ous lack appears. In a second volume 27 he undertakes to investigate the semantic archaisms in the current social idiom. He exhorts us to use language with the sharpened sense of concrete situation which experimental procedures instill in a scientist. In general, the complete meaning of any concept is determined by the complex of its behavior when subjected to every possible operation. . . . Words in language are a part of a stream of activity. The meaning of a word is affected to some extent by the whole context in which it is embedded, and since this context never exactly recurs, the meaning of the word is never precisely the same. Our analysis of words as repro- ducing permanent features of experience discloses an approximation, not only with regard to the permanence of the features of experience but also with regard to the permanence of the relations of words to the 27 The Intelligent Individual and Society (New York, 1938). For a general criticism sec Abraham Edel in Science and Society, πι (1939), ΐ3ΐ-34·</page><page sequence="14">328 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY features. In fact the meaning of the whole is never exactly the sum of the meaning of the parts.2* The student of language will be quite willing to admit this, as we pointed out at the beginning. But when Professor Bridgman starts to test some of our social concepts by his "new" method, the result is disheartening. Testing for the meaning of "duty," the scientific investigator complains that he encounters a lot of mean- ingless phrases; so with "rights" (especially "inalienable" ones), "morality," and similar words. The complaint about vagueness of reference is, to be sure, justified. The operationalist therefore decides that he must guard himself against premature value judgments. But in so doing he appears to have renounced all value judg- ments for all time. Although ostensibly rejecting the incommuni- cable private universe of the solipsist (p. 152 f.), he in practice makes his ego a central fact and subordinates all values to its judgment. A key test for him becomes "Why should?" The perpetuation of the group and race has always been offered as a primary good worth living for- but why should one accept it? It is not a major matter for the individual (as Bridgman conceives him); the "central fact" in the scheme of meanings. So long as his conditions of life are pleasant and assured of pleasant continuance, all is well. It is admitted that the welfare of the group is necessary for this continu- ance. But "regard for posterity" is a mere artifact. It is just another meaningless concept, according to the operationalist; one of the many with which sociologists have peopled our world. These writers, he says, have undertaken to offer us something outside our- selves to tie up to; something "bigger than it all"- but there simply isn't anything there. Here the quest for social meaning via operations ends in a blank. Bridgman concludes that society must be so constructed that it serves the individual, instead of having the individual serve society. And serving the individual means serving his ultimate egoistic "drives," which are "not to be rationalized or justified, and certainly not apol- ogized for" (p. 265). This is the sociological position to which Bridgman's adventure 28 Ibid., p. 54 and 56; italics mine.</page><page sequence="15">SEMANTICS AS SOCIAL EVASION 329 in semantics leads him. But the linguist and the sociologist may alike charge him with oversimplification. His thesis is unfortunate as an initial assumption and false to the best human experience as a conclusion. Ibsen gave imaginative demonstration of the workings of such a philosophy based on individual drives when he wrote the mad-house scene in Peer Gynt. A Marxist could point out in addi- tion that Bridgman's approach is fundamentally a mistaken one, since he posits a deep division between his intelligent individual and society. He sets them as it were in opposition to each other instead of viewing them in intimate dialectic relationship. In the few years since his book was written, however, its whole message might be felt to be already outmoded by many who were once impressed by it. Joint effort in a hopeful, ultimately constructive war effort is making collective thinking habitual to many who formerly held themselves consciously isolated, as Bridgman's intelligent individual was sup- posed to do. There is a curious paradox in this individual isolation reached by way of semantic studies in language. Communication is accepted as a primary function of language among men: communication, faulty and proximate as it may be, of experience based on an existent objective world of reality. Isolation or quasi-solipsism would seem to be the last of all likely conclusions to philosophic-linguistic studies. Yet it is the end result if too little attention is given to the hopeful possibilities inherent in the speech situation. Since we con- tinuously check and recheck linguistic formulations by our experi- ence of the material changing world, in collaboration with our fellows, we are able to move forward. But any philosophical ten- dencies which underemphasize or deny this checking and collabora- tion, and stress instead the ultimate incommunicability of experi- ence, will lead us to isolation and despair. The logical positivists also put extraordinary emphasis upon the study of language, although their preoccupation is not exclusively with semantics. The chief, if not the only, method of philosophy, according to Carnap, is the analysis of language. Basic philosophical positions such as idealism and naturalism are, he argues, mere verbal confusions. Sentences stating such positions are, when properly analyzed, not about the world, but only the use of words. Carnap 's contentions have already been criticized in an earlier issue of this</page><page sequence="16">330 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY magazine.29 Here we need only point to their resemblance to the theories of the semanticists. Representatives of this latter movement tend, as we have seen, to regard all statements made about values, all ethical statements, as purely emotive; that is, as expressing emotions of the speaker, and not facts of the world or of society. The violent differences of opinion on ethical, social and political questions, in which values play a part, turn out to be more absurd than anyone had expected. They are resolved into differing ex- pressions of the speakers' emotions. Although the logical positivists have made contributions to the analysis of language, it is difficult to escape the conviction that they too have greatly exaggerated its therapeutic values. And their approach, like that of the semanticists, may be used as an avenue of escape from active concern with an external world which daily presses the most urgent problems upon our attention. Semantics and sanity are connected, without doubt, and the valid relations between them will be explored in due time. The authentic investigation will be made, we may be sure, by persons actuated by a social philosophy more generous than any evinced by current writers on the subject. Such a study must be made, at the very least, by those who are not seeking escape from the actuality of non-verbal problems. It must be made by students who accept the existence of our material world, with everything in it that is unpleasing to us now; and who are willing to fuse theory and practice in realistic efforts toward its amelioration. For such students, the lore of seman- tics will become an instrument of social progress instead of a tech- nique of social evasion. New York University 29 V. J.
