The play was the latest in a series of attacks by wits and churchmen on the new science associated with the Royal Society.1 Robert Hooke, the Society's best-known curator of experiments, did not see the play on its opening night, but he was told about it that evening at Garaway's coffeehouse.2 When Hooke went to see The Virtuoso in its second week with some friends, he left the theater convinced that the play was a personal attack on him. His diary entry for that day ends in a wounded staccato: "Damned Doggs. Vindica me Deus. People almost pointed" (2 June 1676, p. 235). The next day, the situation worsened. Back at Garaway's, his regular haunt, more people Hooke knew "[came] from Play [and] Floutingly smiled" at him (3 June 1676, p. 235). As his diary shows, Hooke was asked about Shadwell's play several more times in the coming weeks. Playgoers were of course correct to look to Hooke as one of The Virtuoso's targets, for the play had directly parodied material from his Micrographia{'665) among other recent Royal Society works.3 But perhaps what troubled Hooke most was how Shadwell's attack from the stage confirmed his own worst fears, namely, that the new science could be seen as a species of drama and his empiri- cal work merely a kind of comic performance. In the 1650s, after all, Cambridge Platonist Henry More could refer to the work of John Shanahan is an associate professor of English at DePaul University. He has essays in print and forthcoming on Ben Jonson, Margaret Cavendish, and Jonathan Swift and is completing a book entitled "Elaborate Works: Untangling Drama and Science in Early Modern England."</page><page sequence="2">550 Thomas Shadwell's Virtuoso the new science as that "Mechanical kind of Genius that loves to be tumbling of and trying tricks with the Matter (which they call making Experiments.)"4 Spectacular public shows of natural magic, legerdemain, and other tricks with objects made the association of empirical manipulation with theatricality and deceit almost inevitable. Given the long history of natural magic and alchemy and their empirical repertoires, historian G. MacDonald Ross is correct to note how "mechanists of the seventeenth century had a considerable problem if they wanted to maintain that they were different in kind from the magicians of old, and were not simply the first generation of successful magicians."5 Since the late 1650s, Hooke had been paid to undertake empirical trials, to manufacture new instruments (most notably the air-pump that Robert Boyle made famous), and to demonstrate his own and others' experiments, first briefly for Boyle while at Oxford before the Restoration, and after 1660 for the Royal Society as a whole.6 Hooke was, in effect, the Royal Society's hired player. In fact, he complained in an unpublished Royal Society manuscript that some members came to meetings "only as to a Play to amuse themselves for an hour or so."7 In its semipublic demonstrations of wonderful natural phenomena, was the Royal Society indeed functioning like a third theater in Restoration London? Hooke's private anger and exasperation demonstrates the fact that at least some contemporaries had not internalized the new reception protocols necessary for distinguishing scientific experimentation from popular theater. For many observers throughout the seventeenth century, empirical natural philosophy was not immediately and obviously different from the dexterity of jugglers and cunning-men, the leg- erdemain tricks of showmen and players, and the kitchen-based skills of alchemists, cooks, and pharmacists. In an influential es- say, Steven Shapin drew attention to the fact that "in the middle of the seventeenth century the experimental laboratory and the places of experimental discourse did not have standard designa- tions, nor did people who found themselves within them have any tacit knowledge of the behavioral norms obtaining there."8 Henry More's dismissive quip was only one in a series. Thomas Hobbes, for instance, also used theatrical metaphor in several attacks on Boyle and his colleagues in the early 1660s: the air-pump was little more than an elaborate "pop-gun," he claimed, and Society fellows "display new machines, to show their vacuum and trifling wonders, in the way that they behave who deal in exotic animals, which are not to be seen without payment."9 And theatrical meta-</page><page sequence="3">John Shanahan 551 phor was employed inside the Royal Society as well. In July 1663, for example, Royal Society fellows debated what experiments Hooke was to show at King Charles IPs upcoming visit. What was needed, Christopher Wren suggested, was "a notable experiment" with "something of pomp," but the planners were simultaneously aware that such spectacle risked casting the virtuosi as little dif- ferent from the Court entertainers of previous reigns. Wren hoped for the possibility of avoiding in their demonstrations for the king "knacks only, and things to raise wonder such as [Jesuit natural magicians Athanasius] KIRCHER, [and Gasper] SCHOTTUS, and even jugglers abound with."10 To its boosters, the Royal Society's new natural philosophy was not to be confused with the wonder- production of court performers such as John Dee, "Hocus Pocus," and Cornelius Drebbel.11 Boyle defended his work in that same year (1663) by insisting "the [natural] Works of God are not like the tricks of jugglers, or the pageants, that entertain princes, where concealment is requisite for wonder."12 The new science's legitimacy depended on public trials and witnessed facts, yet images of private space and theatrical imposture haunted the empirical program of the early fellows. To counter this problem, Shapin argued, correctly, "experimentalists like Boyle and his Royal Society colleagues in the 1660s were engaged in a vigorous attack on the privacy of existing forms of intellectual practice."13 Viewed in retrospect and with a sufficient level of abstraction, seventeenth-century natural philosophy did indeed make a tran- sition in rhetoric and in practice from the domestic to the public realm. However, attention to Shadwell's important play will show how the decades-long evolution from private tinkering to public demonstration was all along the way more complicated and con- tested than retrospective accounts of the rise of the new science have previously acknowledged. If Royal Society fellows were troubled by associations of privacy in their pursuit of true public knowledge, they were at the same time conscious of their work as public spectacle and its vulner- ability to being deflated precisely as such, as the examples I have mentioned above show. This latter anxiety, about the publicity and theatricality of experimentation, is the central focus of this essay, which will show how the new science's reception vis à vis discourses of theatricality was fundamentally important in ways that complicate the public-private demarcation problems high- lighted by Shapin and others. Leveraging the power of the stage to volatilize both ontology and epistemology, Shadwell's Virtuoso proves to be the period's most brilliant formal intervention in</page><page sequence="4">552 Thomas Shadwell's Virtuoso intellectual and ideological crises surrounding the new science. Shadwell drew upon the fact that the vocabulary and practice of drama was already "at hand," semantically rich, expansive in scope, and subsumed within itself, among other things, a history of interrogations of behavior in places ranging from the public stage to the private closet. By the 1660s, theories and practices associated with dramatic performance constituted a powerful if oft debated lexicon for examining the nature of empirical repre- sentation and apprehension. Combining the history of science and the history of theater, this essay will show how the early experimental community struggled to find ways to mark its work as different from inherited models of theatricality and knowledge, and how Shadwell worked to counter these goals with a quite profound (and simultaneously rather funny) satiric analysis of the proliferating and functionally differentiating spaces of sci- entific modernity. In precisely those years when Boyle and his fellow virtuosi sought to make natural philosophy increasingly autonomous from discourses of theater, Shadwell short-circuited their message by representing empirical work on stage, "inside," as it were, the very different but more capacious and flexible space of drama that natural philosophy sought to escape. The innovative power of Shadwell's Virtuoso stems from the fact that it counters Royal Society self-representations of leaving behind both the domestic and the theatrical by portraying (via satire on the public stage) how mundane, compromised, and private labo- ratory work was and always would be. Ultimately a celebration of the power of drama, The Virtuoso argues that the new science, despite recent appearances, should be regarded as no more than a species of theater. Privacy, as we have seen, was a major target of the new natural philosophy. Unproductive secrecy was common in the popular representation of alchemy, for example, and the latter was to be reformed with increasingly public methods by trustworthy gentle- men-virtuosi. Boyle's Sceptical Chemist hoped to encourage "the [aljchymists' doctrine out of their dark and smoky laboratories" for the benefit of the wider experimental community (1:461). In the preface to Micrographia, Hooke lamented that "the Arts of Life have been too long imprison'd in the dark shops of Mechanicks by ignorance and selfe interest."14 Despite Hobbes's early criticism of the Royal Society for its restricted access - speaker B in his 1661 Dialogus Physicus states bluntly that "the place where they meet is not public" - the virtuosi consistently emphasized the collective and public nature of what took place at meetings and in private</page><page sequence="5">John Shanahan 553 laboratories. 15 To facilitate the new public fact-production, Hooke wrote up protocols for the Society that required witnesses and documentation for experimental trials. Seeing an experiment in person made its truth value forcefully apparent; ideally, Hooke stressed, "[I]t were very desirable that both Observations and Experiments should be divers times repeated, and that at several Seasons and with several Circumstances, both of the Mind and of Persons, Time, Place, Instruments and Materials."16 In Hooke's words here we also see the theatrical lexicon that subtends the very imagination of empirical work. One must perform a trial for different audiences and work to find what might remain con- stant through the iterations. While the ideal witness was a fellow virtuoso, Boyle at times made an effort to have spectators and witnesses from outside the circle of gentlemanly science. In his novel trials with animals in the air-pump, he noted that this "sort of experiments seem so strange, that we were obliged to make it several times, which gained it the advantage of having persons of differing qualities, professions and sexes (as not only ladies and lords, but doctors and mathematicians) to witness it" (1: 106). Bird trials in particular evoked in Boyle some of his most dramatic rhetoric: a suffocating lark was a "tragedy" of just under an hour's time, dying "with her breast upward, her head downwards, and her neck awry;" a hen-sparrow, by contrast, when air was let back in, panted, "opened her eyes, and regained her feet" (1:97, 98). Boyle's rescue of yet another bird was prompted "by the pity of some fair ladies" (1:106). Natural philosophy is an affair of some pathos here, and notable is the way an inherited vocabulary of dramatic decorum is employed to figure unprecedented experi- ences. Theatrical discourse was employed in still more significant ways. Thomas Sprat's 1667 History of the Royal Society went so far as to declare that facts were in effect publicly produced and verified even in cases when an experiment was undertaken alone and in private. He writes, "In Assemblies, the Wits of most men are sharper, their Apprehensions readier, their Thoughts fuller, than in their Closets . . . Those, to whom the conduct of the Experiment is committed ... do (as it were) carry the eyes, and the imaginations of the whole company into the Laboratory with them."17 Similarly, Hooke asked rhetorically in Micrographics "How neer the nature of Adorns must all those Propositions be which are examined before so many Witnesses."18 But a self-presentation cast in the vocabulary of theatricality was a volatile invocation for the new science, for anyone who had been to a public playhouse or a legerdemain show in the streets, or simply watched a contentious</page><page sequence="6">554 Thomas Shadwell's Virtuoso debate, might challenge Hooke's and Sprat's model as overly ide- alizing. The skeptic might ask, for example, whether it is actually true that men's wits are "sharper" in crowds, or whether seeing something demonstrated live always enhanced the conviction of its truth. Live performance is inherently unstable, both from the perspective of the performers and of the audience. The Virtuoso brings such skeptical concerns directly to bear publicly. By put- ting the appearance of Royal Society science on stage, Shadwell complicates and volatilizes Royal Society models of witnessing, in effect reminding audience members in real time how witness- ing is much more epistemologically and socially unruly than had been optimistically claimed. By placing virtuoso Sir Nicholas Gimcrack and his laboratory directly onstage and within an otherwise conventional comic de- sign, Shadwell fashioned a sophisticated exploration and critique of the proliferating spaces of knowledge in Restoration culture.19 At the same time he created an important formal innovation in English drama. From Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus, through Ben Jonson's The Alchemist and Shakespeare's The Tempest, previous English drama rarely represented the actual materials and behaviors of experimental work onstage. In Jonson's Alchemist, notably, the alchemical endeavor of the swindling trio takes place behind the back door in another room, and no realistic equipment is shown. The audience, like the dupes who come to Lovewit's house, can rely only on what the swindlers say about the transformations supposedly happening just offstage (but in fact happening right before our eyes, as I have argued elsewhere).20 Visitors to Lovewit's house must supply their own imagination to complete the fantasy initiated by Subtle and his criminal col- leagues. In Jonson's London, there was no distinct "space," official or otherwise, with which to identify the proper place of empirical experimentation. But six decades later, Shadwell is satirizing a royally chartered and now institutional science claiming public attention outside of private homes. Writing drama about natural philosophy after 1660, Shadwell juxtaposes two real and, in a sense, competing performance spaces, new theaters and new Royal Society, and by formally overlapping them forces an audi- ence to work to compare and contrast them explicitly. For all his admiration of Jonsonian satire, Shadwell inverts the dramatic formula that worked so powerfully in The Alche- mist Lovewit's house in Jonson's play is a blank space without real experimental objects, a place within which people project new selves and new worlds. Shadwell, by contrast, stages, quite</page><page sequence="7">John Shanahan 555 literally, palpably, the workspace of the new science - its instru- ments, actions, and repulsive denizens - but precisely in order to discourage imaginative additions or fantastic accompaniments to arise inside the realistic setting on the stage. To put it simply, Gimcrack in The Virtuoso is shown with his frogs, bottles, and spiders in order to prevent projection from taking place. In an ironic inversion of the Royal Society's eloquent rhetoric of per- suasive communal witnessing, Shadwell uses the public stage to show his audience how one need only see an experiment and experimenters in order to deflate the new science's pretensions to social value and moral transcendence. Gimcrack's laboratory, like his garden, his courtyard, and every other place in The Virtuoso, is filled with mundane, compromised people and their all-too- worldly motivations. There is nothing special about a room called a laboratory (Lady Gimcrack defines her husband's as merely "a spacious room where all his instruments and fine knacks are"); it is only more of the same in our common experience of dwelling (II.i.289-90). Shadwell's exercise in strategic literalism was an assault di- rectly upon the Restoration experimental community's attempt to differentiate the laboratory from the private kitchen and the public theater. The Virtuoso aims to prevent the emergence of science as an autonomous type of place and practice. For the boosters of the new science, a laboratory was a special new kind of space and experience, and facts arising therein were public and tran- scendent, not the property of one group or method. According to Sprat, laboratories were the setting for a solid new "Philosophy of Mankind" (p. 63). The young Boyle described his newly assembled laboratory as a fantastic, even sacred, place in a 1649 letter to his sister: "Vulcan has so transported and bewitched me, that as the delights I taste in it make me fancy my laboratory a kind of Elysium, so as if the threshold of it possessed the quality the poets ascribed to that Lethe, their fictions made men taste of before their entrance into those seats of bliss, I there forget my standish and my books, and almost all things, but the unchangeable resolution I have made of continuing till death" (6:49-50). This laboratory is a space of quest and transcendence to which Boyle will dedicate a pious life; he elsewhere suggested that Sunday might be the best day to perform experiments.21 Joseph Glanvill also described the work of the virtuosi as anything but mundane; the effort of experimenting in his description resembles more an eroticized choreography of pursuit: "'tis . . . a pleasant spectacle to behold the shifts, windings and unexpected Caprichios of distressed Nature,</page><page sequence="8">556 Thomas Shadwell's Virtuoso when pursued by a close and well managed Experiment. And the delights which result from these nobler entertainments are such, as our cool and reflecting thoughts need not be ashamed q/!"22 We might also see in Glanvill's description of empirical work here a flicker of self-awareness of the perception that what virtuosi do in their rooms might be less "cleanly j oyes" than "titillations that reach no higher then Phancy and the Senses."23 Such uncharitable views certainly existed before Shadwell penned his play. In a 1667 Westminster Abbey sermon, for instance, Oxford church- man Robert South called the Royal Society "a set of fellows . . . g[o]t together, and . . . formed into a kind of diabolical society, for the finding out new experiments in vice."24 Gentlemanliness, as Shapin has shown, was in response an important component in the self-presentation of virtuosi as, in Sprat's words, "free, and unconfin'd" and thereby able to study nature without moral sus- picion or pecuniary motives.25 By definition, if not always in actual fact, gentlemen faced less direct challenge to the veracity of their testimony. Royal Society members cast themselves as mediators of a notable new type - self-identified "priests of nature" - but who worked without practicing the trickery associated with priest- craft in Protestant polemic. Boyle's ideal "Christian Virtuoso," for example, knew how to add reflection about the Creator to his study of natural phenomena and therefore was superior to "a lib- ertine, though ingenious, or a sensualist, though curious; or ... a mere empiric" (5:524). His Usefulness of Natural Philosophy (1663) predicted the future calling of a "priesthood without unc- tion or imposition of hands," who were nonetheless "ordained" in rational knowledge of Nature and qualified "to celebrate the divine service not only in it, but for it."26 Boyle put a great deal of effort into cultivating a pious public persona, and the chorus of support both for him and for his model was widespread. Nathaniel Highmore in 1651 credited Boyle for being "married to the Arts," and John Evelyn called him "clear and candid; not a blemish or spot to tarnish his reputation."27 Typically extravagant, Glanvill thought Boyle would have been deified in antiquity for his exem- plary life and works.28 Shadwell deflates such virtuoso self-aggrandizement in two principal ways: by attacking the personality of the virtuoso, and by attacking the new kind of space crafted by and for natural phi- losophy. Study of the first method of attack, Shadwell's biographic or demographic satire, has dominated the critical reception of the play.29 But the second method of attack - to challenge the very sta- tus of the new kind of space science seemed to require - is where I</page><page sequence="9">John Shanahan 557 locate Shadwell's true artistic innovation and his most devastating intellectual challenge. It has been overlooked in previous criticism that Shadwell's real triumph is in striking at the form science takes as well as its content. Approaching the play anew in terms of space has the added benefit of unifying it as a coherent satire. Notoriously, Gimcrack's laboratory is subsumed entirely within the more familiar spaces of Restoration comic plotting. The epi- sodes dedicated to the satire of virtuosity and experimentation are at times fleeting and embedded within a rather conventional plot. This might appear a formal weakness of the play, as if Shadwell did not or could not focus sustained attention on his object of attack (assumed to be the personalities of particular scientists), and instead frequently wandered off target into clichés of 1670s sex farce. But locating laboratory work intermittently within a home turned upside down is in fact precisely the foundation of Shadweirs most stinging critique. Sir Nicholas Gimcrack's lab is shown directly only a few times (Il.ii; possibly Ill.iii and V.ii), and at other moments evoked indirectly in connection with his medicinal garden and basement vault for storing air. Much of the action of the play takes place elsewhere inside and just outside of Gimcrack's home: in its courtyard (IV. v), the street (V.iii), a hired apartment for clandestine sex (Ill.ii; IV.ii), and in a large masquerading room (V.iv). There are still other spaces as well, including a subterranean vault that temporarily traps Sir Formal and Sir Samuel and a "woodhole" that serves as a hiding place for characters caught in compromising sexual situations. Amidst such comic variety, time spent in Gimcrack's lab comes to have a constructive and furtive feel. Bruce and Longvil, the witty young gentlemen-heroes of the play, wait impatiently for excuses to flee Sir Nicholas in order to get back to the garden and their loves (II. ii.302-3; Ill.iii. 116-25). Like Bruce and Longvil, and Gimcrack's nieces and wife, an audience is supposed to feel uncomfortable and dirtied by its time inside of a laboratory. Shadwell was a resolutely topographic author in a self- consciously topographic age, often investigating the nature and experience of particular locales in his works.30 To mention only a few examples from the plays, briefly, there is the volatile mixing ground of the baths in Epsom Weils, where Shadwell forces his audience to examine the interaction of individuals from various socioeconomic strata.31 His Bury Fair similarly takes as its setting the conflictual spaces of market and home and as its theme the prevalence of disguise in mediating the self in public. In The Lan- chashire Witches, Shadwell tapped into the paranoia surrounding</page><page sequence="10">558 Thomas Shadwell's Virtuoso rumors of a Popish Plot in order to dramatize a clash of knowl- edge and fanaticism in one particularly charged place. His late masterpiece The Squire ofAlsatia is set in the notorious "liberty" of Whitefriars inside the City walls and is so precise in its inten- tion to document a specific area that the printed play came with a glossary of the "cant" spoken by the exotic inhabitants of the neighborhood.32 The nature and quality of the built environment mattered especially to Shadwell and for reasons of ethical import. For Shadwell, one's environment was a heterogeneous moral topography in which different locations could not and should not be treated alike. Decorum prescribed different behaviors for different occasions, all in the end dependent on one's status. In his important book on Shadwell, Christopher Wheatley has per- suasively argued that the governing ethical system in the plays is that people ought to act in ways appropriate to their social posi- tion. (For example, gentlemen have a duty to stamp out disorder in the lower orders, as they do seemingly without irony in The Virtuoso and The Squire ofAlsatia.) In a related argument, Stephen D. Cox has shown that private vices, particularly sexual ones, seldom bother Shadwell the self-professed moralist-playwright, but rather that for him the worst offenses are "injuries to public safety" and actions inappropriate to one's station.33 In connection with this, we might note how the rakish depravity of Don John in Shadwell's The Libertine (1675) is described in spatial terms. For the libertine Don John "All times and places are alike" (Works 3:29, Li. 199); that is to say, in his fully secular world he can rape and murder in churches as readily as in houses, and for him there are no canonical hours. Don John's prédation in abstract space is the terrifying ethical analogue of a physical environment of universal sameness. When all places are equivalent, how could one know one's place? Since appropriate behavior for Shadwell depends on its context, we see too how Jonsonian humors served as a skeleton for his dramaturgy. For Shadwell as for Jonson, to have a defining "humor" - that is, to be inflexible despite changes of place or company, to be an inefficient judge of what was fit for a particular occasion, or to universalize or rhetorically elevate a mundane place - was to be suspect ethically and unstable intel- lectually.34 And we now can recognize that the universal and abstract space associated with Gimcrack's new science parallels the sinister, because ethically blank, environment prowled by Don John the libertine. Paraphrasing Alexandre Koyré, we might say that in both cases Shadwell is troubled to find a familiar, ethi- cally heterogeneous "closed world" being displaced by the new</page><page sequence="11">John Shanahan 559 science's infinite and formally isometric "universe" of deracinated subjects and objects.35 Gimcrack in The Virtuoso, like Don John in The Libertine, has made himself a man oblique to and perhaps even incommensurate with inherited ethical systems. To skeptical observers of the new science such as Shadwell, Samuel Butler, and, later, Jonathan Swift, the early modern virtuoso suffered from what Lorraine Daston has termed a "pathology of misdirected attention."36 The natural philosopher confuses the great and the trivial and, despite a flowing rhetoric of perfectibility and accomplishment, can in fact realize neither himself nor collective betterment. Indeed, in Shadwell's hands Gimcrack's work is fundamentally antisocial, for it inverts assumed hierarchies and dissolves traditional bonds. Derek Hughes is correct that Gimcrack "lives in a world from which ancestry has been erased."37 The virtuoso has no children, but instead the temporary care of two nieces who despise him. Rather than traditional human entailment, Gimcrack cares for a pet spider named "Nick" and a whore, Mrs. Flirt, who (like his wife) cuckolds him. Misdirected attention has warped his sense of proportion, so he finds sociability in repulsive vermin but, as his niece Miranda quips, "never cares for understanding mankind" (I.ii. 13). 38 His training as a virtuoso is ultimately a parody of civil- ity and gentlemanliness; Sir Nicholas made the grand tour not to "observe the wisdom, policies, and customs" of noble Italians and others, but to study "the secrets" of insect government (III.iii.86, 85). Secrets of state, those arcana imperii so contested in early modern Europe, have devolved in Gimcrack's novel worldview to absurd metaphorical limits. He has not cultivated humanistic prudence and wisdom, but instead has immersed himself in an inverted chain of being. In fact, by celebrating spiders instead of bees and putrefaction rather than cultivation, Gimcrack is craft- ing a perverse new form of the georgic sensibility. Not redemptive nor environmentally sensitive, Sir Nicholas nonetheless claims to have learned a great deal from his humble and unsavoiy subjects. His belly on one table, his limbs tied by strings to those of a frog on another, Gimcrack is in act II shown struggling to discover "the speculative part of swimming" (II.ii.84). Gimcrack's virtuoso science exchanges human and animal traits and literal and metaphorical reference. One of the play's most persistent attacks is its attention to the linguistic and metaphysi- cal improprieties of virtuosity. Gimcrack's work demonstrates the danger of linguistic plasticity out of control. Sir Formal at one point brags of his friend Sir Nicholas, "Not a creature [is] so inani-</page><page sequence="12">560 Thomas Shadwell's Virtuoso mate to which he does not give a tongue, he makes the whole world vocal; he makes flowers, nay, weeds, speak eloquently and by a noble kind of prosopopeia instruct mankind" (I.i.272-5). Not only does the virtuoso domesticate vermin by giving them pet names ("Nick," his pet spider, but also the "greyhound," "spaniel," and "hound" spiders ridiculed throughout the play), but he also trains and learns from them. Sir Nicholas has discovered that tarantulas enjoy music by engineering an experiment to place different kinds of spiders on "[wood] chips in water" to witness their individual responses to somber and antic music (III. iii. 93-10 1).39 What Gimcrack's experiments, musical and otherwise, finally show is anthropomorphism run amok. In a description of the hunting practices of spiders by Sirs Formal and Nicholas, human and nonhuman traits blend to destabilize fundamental decorums. As we saw above in a different context, Shadwell draws attention to the leveling and, finally, the absence of proper ethical differentia- tion: "Sir Nicholas. [The tumbler spider] will teach its young ones to hunt and discipline 'em severely when they commit faults. And when an old one misses its prey, it will retire and keep its chamber for grief, shame, and anguish ten hours together" (III.iii.62-5).40 Such linguistic confusion begets dangerous activities as well, as is made particularly clear in Gimcrack's experiments with blood transfusion. He is dangerous to know, literally: he has, accord- ing to Snarl, "kill'd four or five" with his transfusion experiments recently (II.ii.2 14-5).41 Shadwell dramatizes how the new science's physiology radicalizes the metaphorical capacity of language, threatening to collapse the literal and figurative senses of words and thereby make basic ontology problematic. In an experiment transfusing sheep's blood into a madman, Gimcrack has troubled referentiality. Shadwell's description of the work begins tamely enough as satire - after an exchange of blood "[t]he patient from being maniacal or raging mad became wholly ovine and sheepish" (II. ii. 190-1). Basic metaphors so far are recognizable and comic, but the experiment has had additional consequences: the former madman "bleated perpetually and chew'd the cud" and later grew wool and a tail (II.ii.191-4). No longer figurative descriptions of human traits, the "sheepishness" of the patient has become ontological as well. Shadwell at the same time highlights how such empirical work is a doubling and profanation of religious vocabulary: Sir Nicholas reports that the madman recently sent him a letter calling himself "the meanest of my flock" (II.ii.208), and the playwright might have drawn upon earlier criticism of Royal Society transfusion experiments for illegitimately meddling</page><page sequence="13">John Shanahan 561 with "the blood of the lamb."42 What seemed at first comic and comfortably domestic, merely the figurative usage of common words, becomes ominously literal and potentially blasphemous in the world of virtuoso activity. Gimcrack's antisocial life, though ungentlemanly and intel- lectually unstable, is not without any forms of companionship. His relationships, however, are far-flung rather than local (with corresponding virtuosi in Lapland, for example); with objects and vermin rather than men; and hired and nonprocreative rather than conjugal. He has what we might call "patients" - the poor who crowd his courtyard for medicine, especially for the pox, at the end of act IV - but as Snarl has noted (II.ii.214-5), Gimcrack's proffered remedies may as likely prove to be poisons. Gimcrack has business dealings with tradesmen for samples and equip- ment, but these too are flawed.43 Gimcrack's principle "humor," his hubris of expansive personal and ethical accomplishment (he tells Bruce and Longvil he can fly, for example [II.ii.36]),44 has paradoxically narrowed his vision and leverage in the world. No longer able to influence his wife, nieces, uncle Snarl, or local patients, he can manipulate only the small creatures in his labo- ratory and similarly "inspired" natural philosophers. Lady Gim- crack, a wild and predatory woman bent on independent desire, uses the studied absence of her husband to employ the house for her own goals of bedding Bruce and Longvil in turn during a masquerade in act V. The works Gimcrack produces are trivial and useless; the weight of the air, famously, he determines only "to know what it weighs" (V.ii.20), and when confronted by angry local weavers who believe he has invented a mechanical loom, he confesses never to have made anything of use (V.ii.115). Bruce observes aside to Longvil during a microscopical presentation that "one bricklayer is worth forty philosophers" (IV.iii.2 19-20). Since he learns to swim indoors "speculatively," Gimcrack can be said to know and act only in a very limited sense. For all of his physico-theological language of meditation and transcendence, Sir Nicholas's intellectual horizons are actually smaller than what any normal engagement with the world might produce. The speaking tube Gimcrack has developed will lessen the need for travel and diplomacy, for "from the chief mountain, hill, or eminence in a county a man may be heard round the county ... I have thought of this to do the king service. For when I have perfected it, there needs but one parson to preach to a whole county" {V.U. 54-60). 45 The virtuoso no longer travels for health or wisdom (though he says that he can fly), because he has air from different regions</page><page sequence="14">562 Thomas Shadwell's Virtuoso bottled and sent to him. When Sir Nicholas has "a mind to take country air, I send for maybe forty gallons of Bury air, shut all my windows and doors close, and let it fly in my chamber" (IV. iii. 264-6). Instead of the convivial and gentlemanly offer of wine, Gimcrack has only "airs" for his guests. Additionally, Sir Nicholas and Sir Formars behavior on stage indicates that the simultaneously distorted and constricted senses of the virtuosi turn their appetites sinister. A blatant example is Sir Formal's attempted rape of Sir Samuel Hearty (the latter in women's clothes) when they are trapped together in a dark vault (IV.i. 1-81). Most importantly, Gimcrack himself is a fornicator, in Shadwell's terms, not a bachelor or priest of nature, as Boyle cast himself. Useless but sweaty and experimenting, often in dark closed chambers where one "let[s] it fly" (IV.iii.266), Shadwell sug- gests natural philosophy rests on a foundation of both onanism and fugitive sexuality. The episodes in the laboratory or within hearing of natural philosophical discourse are to the young and truly witty characters only moments lost from the spontaneous pleasures of love-play. By contrast, virtuosi make spectacles rel- evant and engaging only to themselves. Gimcrack's schemes, from human flight to perception across thresholds larger and smaller than are natural to the human senses, are shown to be external symptoms of a failure to understand the reality of limits.46 Sir Nicholas knows no limits in his tone: perfection is routinely on his lips, from the speaking tube ("I shall improve it very much more, for there's no stop in art") to travel under water and in the air (V.ii.48-9; II.ii.27-48). Bruce, Longvil, Miranda, and Clarinda recognize the suspect bonds shared among the virtuosi in their workspace. As Sir Formal and Sir Nicholas compliment one an- other on their studies, Longvil quips to Bruce, "How the asses claw one another" (II.ii.71); indeed, the two virtuosos constitute a "mutual admiration society," in the words of one modern critic.47 In a little world without human lineage, teeming with vermin and machines but without decorous social bonds, Gimcrack and Sir Formal, in effect, perform only for one another. The laboriousness of the virtuoso in his lab and underground air chamber is effort for naught, sweat for no higher purpose. The virtuoso fails to block the love-pursuit of his nieces by Bruce and Longvil, to catch his wife cheating, or to disperse angry ribbon weavers who threaten to storm his home. It is gentlemen Bruce and Longvil with pistols and swords, by contrast, who prevent a near riot by the weavers (V. iii. 82-3) and beat away "bullies" at the masquerade (V.v.5-6). In these episodes, Shadwell shows that because of its onanistic</page><page sequence="15">John Shanahan 563 features and its refusals, even ignorance, of common sociability, the work of the virtuosi ought to remain private. We can now appreciate more fully the devastating logic of Shadwell's decision to show a laboratory and its workings on stage and its resident virtuoso as both fornicator and cuckold. Against a rising tide of polemics and apologies casting laborato- ries as sacred spaces different from their worldly surroundings, Shadwell casts them as perfectly continuous with the fallen spaces of (comic) man. There is nothing transcendent about Gimcrack's empirical retreats; they are not portals to elsewhere or temples to the deity. The work that goes on in his laboratory is neither a pious unveiling nor an engaging "Caprichio" with nature, but merely the self-arousal of profane persons by revolting creatures and suspect objects. If the new space of science is not a qualita- tively different medium, then neither is the person who works in it. Shadwell here too stresses moral and epistemological continuity by means of theatrical convention. Like any aging fool in a comic play, Sir Nicholas is not celibate, nor "clear," nor uninterested in gain. He boards his uncle Snarl and his nieces only in hopes of gaining inheritance and dowry through them (I.ii.244; V.vi.85-8). He is caught with Mrs. Flirt, one of a series of kept mistresses, and Lady Gimcrack, at the close of the play, threatens the ulti- mate revenge she can take on him - sending his love letters to Gresham College (V.vi. 16-7). As I noted at the start of this essay, natural philosophers in the second half of the seventeenth cen- tury attempted to pull away from and to develop alternatives to the tangled discourses of empirical experimentation, theatricality, domesticity, and priestcraft. In turn, Shadwell wove experimental science tightly back into inherited, stylized, narratives and their easily readable generic spaces. His characters repeatedly find deflationary equivalents to describe the virtuoso and his flatter- ing admirer Sir Formal. To Bruce, Sir Formal is "chorus" to Sir Nicholas's "puppet-show"; to Snarl, he is the "zany" to Sir Nicho- las's "mountebank" (I.i.282; II.ii.205). And keeping with some of the oldest formulas for comedie plotting, Sir Nicholas takes on the qualities of the heavy, inhibiting father. From the very opening of the play, Shadwell's self-conscious plotting keeps the audience aware of what kind of plot space they are being invited to witness. Bruce tells Longvil in the opening scene that "[the] Virtuoso is as jealous as an Italian uncle," and therefore will make courtship of the sisters more difficult than desired (I.i.97-8). The sisters echo this description exactly in their first appearance on stage (I.ii. 1-2). Before encountering Sir Nicholas for the first time in his lab in act</page><page sequence="16">564 Thomas Shadwell's Virtuoso II, an audience is prepared to find just another aging guardian in a comedy centered on youthful love-seeking. Against such conventional obstacles, the young couples de- scribe their predicaments self-consciously and briefly in terms of chivalric romance. Trapped by their "Italian" uncle, the girls recall a previous meeting at church with Bruce and Longvil and hope, as Miranda says, "[I]f your knight-errants and we agree upon the point, they'll soon deliver us distressed damsels from our enchanted castle" (I.ii.71-3). The sisters, like smart audi- ence members, are prepared to create and then dissolve in the reflexivity of wit any rhetorical flights or redescriptions of the everyday as the enchanted. When Bruce and Longvil finally meet their intended mates in the garden, the couples try on roles and rhetoric only to laugh them right off again: Bruce. Lovers are quick aimers and can shoot flying. Clarinda. Not if they fly so fast as I shall from you. Bruce. Come, I see this way will not do; 111 try another with you. Ah, madam, change your cruel intentions, or I shall become the most desolate lover that ever yet, with arms across, sigh'd to a murmuring grove or to a purling stream . . . Savage 111 wander up and down the woods and carve my passion on the barks of trees and vent my grief to winds that as they fly shall sigh and pity me. Clarinda. How now! What foolish fustian's this? You talk like an heroic poet. Bruce. ... I had a mind to try what the romantic way of whining love could do. Clarinda. No more of this. (Ill.i. 58-72) Success in this play's world, which is the original audience's own, of course, depends on plain speaking and plain thinking, and on eschewing the romantic vagaries of heroic loving and ex- perimenting (recall Boyle's knight-errantry in describing his lab, mentioned earlier). The triumphant characters in The Virtuoso come to understand that projection and utopianism, the hard cur- rency of the new science, is in fact only onanism and impertinence redescribed. Shadwell highlights metaphorical redescriptions and narrative precedents in order to bind the laboratory more tightly within the theater - within already-familiar surroundings and associations. Every person and place in this play is capable of rhetorical enhancement, but none truly deserves it.</page><page sequence="17">John Shanahan 565 Ultimately, Shadwell's powerful satire of the new science is at the same time a tribute to the power of dramatic form. To the new Royal Society, that rival new theater in London rife with its own brand of spectacle and bombast, Shadwell addresses a stinging analysis of behavior in space that argues for the greater truth- value of satiric drama. Nothing could more effectively undercut the rhetoric of the new science than Shadwell's counsel from the stage that there is nothing new under the sun. For the Restora- tion satirist, the truths of human action and emotion in drama are more capacious, because universal in scope and documented since antiquity, than the virtuosi's new truths about some animals and some objects in some special cases. The Virtuoso's fundamen- tal claim is that (human) nature - in gardens, in masquerades, in drawing rooms, or in laboratories - is best witnessed in the more familiar and ethically comprehensive medium of dramatic decorum.

Like Gimcrack, he cannot tell the trivial from the important, using, as Bruce quips, "as many tropes and flourishes about a mousetrap as he would in praise of Alexander" (III. iv. 131-2, and see III.iv.90-1). J. Douglas Canfield is correct that The Virtuoso is the "apogee of Jonsonian" humors satire in the Restoration (Tricksters and Estates: On the Ideology of Restoration Comedy [Lexington: Univ. of Kentucky Press, 1997], p. 103). 35 Alexander Koyré, From the Closed World to the Infinite Universe (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1958). Koyré summarizes his titular distinction this way: [The] scientific and philosophical revolution [of the seventeenth century] . . . can be described roughly as bringing forth the destruction of the Cosmos, that is, the disappearance, from philosophically and scientifically valid concepts, of the concep- tion of the world as a finite, closed, and hierarchically ordered whole (a whole in which the hierarchy of value determined the hierarchy and structure of being . . . ) and its replacement by an indefinite and even infinite universe which is bound together by the identity of its fundamental components and laws, and in which all these components are placed on the same level of being. This, in turn, implies the discarding by scientific thought of all considerations based upon value-concepts, such as perfection, harmony, meaning and aim, and finally the utter devalorization of being, the divorce of the world of value and the world of facts. (p. 4) 36 Lorraine Daston, "Attention and the Values of Nature in the Enlight- enment," in The Moral Authority of Nature, ed. Daston and Fernando Vidal (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 2004), pp. 100-26, 104. 37 Derek Hughes, English Drama 1660-1700 (Oxford: Clarendon, 1996), 157. 38 Shadwell may be borrowing from Meric Casaubon's criticism of the Royal Society in his A Letter of Meric Casaubon D. D. &amp;c. to "Peter du Moulin" D. D. and Prebendarte of the Same Church: Concerning Natural Experimental Philosophie, and Some Books Lately Let out about it (Cambridge, 1669; rprt., in "A Letter of Meric Casaubon to Peter du Moulin Concerning Natural Experi- mental Philosophy91 [1 669] and uOf Credulity and Incredulity" [1 668, 1 670], by Meric Casaubon, Facsimile Reproductions with an Introduction by David G. Lougee [Delmar NY: Scholars' Facsimiles &amp; Reprints, 1976, pp. 1-36), which ridicules Pierre Gassendi's claim that polymath and virtuoso Nicolas Pieresc had learned more about controlling his passions from witnessing the fight of a louse and a fly in a microscope than he had from anything else he had heard or read. Casaubon retorts, "What? Peyreskius, so learned, so wise a man, to profit more by the sight of such a combat, and the demeanour of the</page><page sequence="22">570 Thomas Shadwell's Virtuoso louse in it, in a thing of such consequence to a mans life, than he had done by the reading of so many Philosophers, who have written so excellently of that subject ... or the precepts and perswasions of the Word of God, always divine" (p. 32). 39 It is quite possible that Shadwell heard about similar acoustic projects and claims from Royal Society members. Hooke, for example, explained a "musick theory" at Garaway's coffeehouse in November 1674 (see Diary p. 131). On early modern acoustic research, see Penelope Gouk, Music, Science, and Natural Magic in Seventeenth-Century England (New Haven and London: Yale Univ. Press, 1999); and Bruce R. Smith, The Acoustic World of Early Modern England: Attending to the "O" Factor (Chicago and London: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1999). 40 Shadwell took this almost verbatim from Observation 48 in Micro- graphia, based on notes John Evelyn had taken while traveling in Italy: Such [hunting spiders] I did frequently observe at Rome, which espying a Fly at three or four yards distance, upon the Balcony (where I stood) would not make directly to her, but craul under the Rail, till being arriv'd to the Antipodes, it would steal up, seldom missing its aim; but if it chanced to want any thing of being perfectly opposite, would at first peep, immediately slide down again, till taking better notice, it would come the next time exactly upon the Fly's back: ... I have beheld them instructing their young ones, how to hunt, which they would sometimes discipline for not well observing; but, when any of the old ones did (as sometimes) miss a leap, they would run out of the field, and hide them in their crannies, as asham'd, and haply not be seen abroad for four or five hours after. (pp. 200-1). 41 Shadwell might have read in the first issue of the Philosophical Trans- actions (4 June 1666) an account of the dissection of two Wadham College students who were killed by lightning the month before. See Robert G. Frank Jr. , Harvey and the Oxford Physiologists: Scientific Ideas and Social Interaction (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1980), p. 183. Frank notes other examples of virtuoso medical experimentation that seem as predatory as altruistic: in autumn 1657, for example, Christopher Wren and Timothy Clarke, visiting the home of the French Ambassador to the Protectorate, started to inject a mixture of blood and crocus metallorum into the veins of "an inferior Domes- tick of his that deserv'd to have been hang'd," but stopped the process when the servant fainted (p. 172). 4¿ On Arthur Coga s notorious blood transfusion and the satires it in- spired, see Nicolson, Pepys1 "Diary," pp. 55-99; and Schaffer, "Regeneration: The Body of Natural Philosophy in Restoration England," in Science Incarnate: Historical Embodiments of Natural Knowledge, ed. Christopher Lawrence and Shapin (Chicago and London: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1998), pp. 83-120. 43 Among his suppliers, Gimcrack has a fishmonger (who fails to deliver) (II.ii.290), a fellow who sells him fake eggs (II. ii. 232-6), ribbon weavers who revolt in act 5, and, in the words of Snarl, "Several engineers, glassmakers,</page><page sequence="23">John Shanahan 571 and other people you have dealt with for experiments" suing him for unpaid debts (V.vi.27-8). This might remind us of Evelyn's well-known 1659 letter to Boyle explaining that he was giving up writing a Baconian history of trades because of "the many subjections, which I cannot support, of conversing with mechanical capricious persons" (qtd. in W. E. Houghton, "The English Virtuoso in the Seventeenth Century: Part II," JHI3, 2 [April 1942]: 190-219, 204). 44 It is possible that Shadwell heard about Hooke's claims regarding the possibility of human flight in the years just before The Virtuoso appeared. Consider the following entries from Hooke's diary: "First tryd Experiment about artificiale strength by water, air, fire, by which flying is easy and car- rying any weight" (7 October 1674, p. 125); the next day, "At [Royal Society] Councell at Arundel told Sir Robert Southwell that I could fly, not how" (ibid.) Later that month, Hooke told his friend Edmund Wild about "flying, etc." (30 October 1674, p. 128). On 9 August 1675, Hooke recorded in his diary that he "Invented flying chariott" (p. 174). 45 See Jessica Wolfe, "Inanimate Ambassadors: The Mechanics and Politics of Mediations," chap. 3 oí Humanism, Machinery, and Renaissance Literature (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 2004), pp. 88-124 for the figure of the artificial ambassador in early modern natural philosophy. 46 Here I am adopting Douglas Lane Patey's description of the critique of projecting in Gulliver's Travels: for Jonathan Swift, the scientific utopianism of Lagado is "the external equivalent ... of the failure to know one's self ("Swift's Satire on 'Science' and the Structure of Gulliver's Travels," ELH 58, 4 [Winter 1991]: 809-39, 817). 47 Joseph M. Gilde, "Shadwell and the Royal Society: batiré in me vir- tuoso" SEL 10, 3 (Summer 1970): 469-90, 488. This essay should make clear the deficiencies of Gilde's reading of Shadwell as a kind of fellow traveler of the Royal Society who sought to criticize only bad science and not the entire empirical program.</page></plain_text>
