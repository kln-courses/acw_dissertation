<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reviews. 409 NATURAL MAN. A Record from Borneo. By CHARLES HOSE. Pref. by Prof. G. ELLIOT SMITH. Macmillan &amp; Co., 1926. 9x" x 61". Pp. xvi + 284. Map + 126 ill. 30s. DR. HOSE'S work supplements that classic, The Pagan Tribes of Borneo, of which he was joint author. The first of its six parts describes the characteristics and probable origins of the island's various peoples and cultures. The Punans are nearest the title r6le, as they are forest-dwellers without houses, crops, domestic animals, or property that cannot be packed on the back; and do not make the metal tools they use. Parts ii and iii, (Tribal and Village Life), are full of interesting details. We learn that common ceremonies and traditions, with inter- marriage, bind together the Kayans into the most clearly defined of the tribes, despite slight intercourse between their widely scattered villages, each of which has several Long Houses under one village chief, with customary power and duties but little reward save social precedence. Kinship terms are few and loosely used. According to a decaying custom, when a birth is announced by a gong beat for a boy and a drum beat for a girl, all present in the House receive a handful of salt from the parents and all absentees must present a piece of iron. There are still many taboos on the parents and child, and the girl of mixed twins was formerly exposed in the jungle. Personal names, usually for the first born those of grandparents, are given at harvest time (when rice and rice spirit can be spared for a feast) to all children of the House in their third or fourth year ; the names are changed after serious illness or accident. Among the Kayans of the Upper Rejang, at naming a cross is made with charcoal on the infant's right foot, and it is taken to the door of each room to receive a gift, after which it must be secluded for eight days, similar seclusion following the next harvest, when the first name is confirmed or a new one given. A sooty mark on the forehead also disguises a child or adult from a malevolent spirit, or protects in strange surroundings. Dr. Hose remarks (p. 271) that " the more intimately one becomes acquainted with these barbaric tribes, the more fully does one realise the close similarity of their mental processes to one's own," and there are striking examples in his pages.

When fishing with tuba, the name of the root must not be uttered and fish must be referred to only indirectly (lest the birds and bats should warn them). The dead lie in state with a valuable bead under each eyelid (p. 207), to pay passage over the River of Death for the ghost-soul, which is distinct from the vital principle; or (p. 216) a bead is fastened to the corpse's right arm to bribe a two-headed dog opposing the ghost's passage; or otherwise the soul must cross a river on a 'shivering bridge' only passable by those who in life have taken heads. Cooked rice and tobacco are laid on the coffin, which is hung round with cigarettes as gifts to dead friends. The coffin must not leave the House by the ladder which is the ordinary exit. Part iv (Arts and Crafts) includes tattooing, a mark of distinction carried over into the next world and universal among Kayan women. They believe that the designs will light them in the After-world, and that only completely tattooed women may bathe and gather treasures in the river Telang Julan, even the banks of which are refused to untattooed dead. Parts v and vi (Creeds and Superstitions; Morals and Mentality). Gods and godlings range from anthropomorphic and ancestral spirits and departmental deities to vague principles such as the virtue of seed-grain or the toh or spirits animating dried human heads (not those of the original owners). Fire must always accompany prayer, even if only a lighted cigarette. The presiding god,-named by the Kayans Laki (grandfather) Tenangan,-is sometimes seen in dreams, usually his back only, and sacrifice of pig or fowl is made on prayer to him. There is much about the honoured crocodile, omen-animals, the ngarong (or " secret helper " who, Prof. Elliot Smith thinks, suggests an explanation of totemism), etc. The volume is full of valuable material and finely illustrated, sometimes in colour. It is a most important contribution to knowledge. A. R. WRIGHT.</page></plain_text>
