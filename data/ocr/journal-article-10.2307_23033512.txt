Evolution by common descent quickly gained acceptance, but sexual selection by female choice faced significant skepticism and remained a discredited area of research on the fringe of evolutionary biology until the late 1970s, when it finally received its due as an important mecha nism for species formation. So the story goes. Or does it? In Looking for a Few Good Males, Erika Milam seeks to replace what she calls this "eclipse narrative" of loss and recovery with a more complex one that stresses the broader scientific and social context in which sexual selection theory was debated. The result is a carefully researched, fascinating history of rich detail on a part of evolutionary biology that has so far garnered little attention among historians, scientists, and the public. This is a thoughtful book that appeals to anyone with an interest in animal behavior or the uneasy relationship between evolution science and the study of human social relationships. Milam begins by pinning the discomfort raised by Darwin's theory of sexual selection upon the threat to human exceptionalism posed by cogni tive choice in other animals. Darwin was explicit in Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex: when evaluating the extravagant plumages and energetic displays of male pheasants (Phasia nidae), for example, female pheasants compared competing males and chose the most beautiful from among them. Anticipating his readers' discomfort Darwin reassured them that, although some of the lower animals undoubtedly possessed a sense of beauty and actively chose their mates, cultivated man (i.e., white Western man) repre sented the pinnacle of an evolutionary progression of cognitive ability and aesthetic sense. Man alone was capable of rational choice. Most of Darwin's colleagues, including Alfred Russell Wallace, co discoverer of natural selection, rejected both choice and an aesthetic sense in other animals, preferring natural selection for male "vigor" as an explanation for male traits that attracted female attention. Unfortunately, the ladder of evolution ary progress appealed to many 19th and 20th century readers, and framed (and constrained) the debate over sexual selection for years to come. Milam continues with a description of the state of animal behavior research in the decades leading up to the Second World War. Not surprisingly, much of the focus on sexual selection in Europe during that period centered on the eugenic potential for female choice to improve human populations, although interest understandably faded with the end of the war. Darwin's attri bution of aesthetic sense to animals had largely been abandoned while concerns over the en croachment of animals upon the uniqueness of human cognitive ability remained. Despite excel lent work by amateur biologists like George and Elizabeth Peckham (spiders) and William Pycraft (birds) that supported female choice and sexual selection, professional evolutionary biologists in creasingly rejected conscious female choice for their mates in favor of physiological reactions to external (male displays) and internal (gonadal sex hormones) stimuli. Eventually, a critical shift in focus occurred from animal mating behavior as precursor to human behavior (the "ladder" metaphor) to animal mate choice and its effect on the process of evolution. This shift was accompanied by new methods that strove to create experimental conditions that mimicked nature as much as possible, and widened the scope of animal behavior science. Researchers increasingly fo cused on the role that sexual selection might have in reinforcing or breaking down species bound aries. Some (e.g., Gladwyn Kingsley Noble) reported evidence of female choice, while others (e.g., Lester Aronson), concluded that females mated randomly. Female mate choice, with the rise of ethology in postwar Britain, was rejected outright in favor of mechanistic models of behavior in which a stimulus (male behavior) overcame female inertia. Ethologists placed critical importance on the genetic basis of behaviors, which they saw as innate, ritualistic responses to environmental stimuli. This idea, coupled with advancements in experimental genetics, enabled animal behavior ists like Claudine Petit and Lee Ehrman to investigate the impact of mating behavior on the genetic dynamics of populations and species. Both found strong evidence for female choice. None theless, prominent evolutionists like Theodosius Dobzhansky and Ernst Mayr continued to dis count its importance for speciation. Finally Robert Trivers, in his paper "Parental Investment and Sexual Selection," interpreted Petit and Ehrman's results in the light of evolutionary game theory, and demonstrated that mate choice must be widespread as well as critically important for</page><page sequence="3">190 THE WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY • Vol. 123, No. 1. March 2011 population dynamics. After the publication of E. O. Wilson's Sociobiology (edited by Robert Trivers), interest in sexual selection surged. Birds, with their obvious sex differences in plumage and behavior and their anthropomorphic appeal, remained a centerpiece of the debate over sexual selection. British naturalist Edmund Selous concluded from hours of observing wild birds that some animals must choose their mates, as did Julian Huxley from his early work on the courtship behavior of Great Crested Grebes (Podiceps cristatus) (although he later rejected that view). Bower birds (Ptilonorhynchidae), with their elaborate mating arenas and innate prefer ences for colorful decorative objects, were invoked for decades by some scientists as proof of conscious animal aestheticism, an idea dis credited by Australian ornithologist Jock Mar shall. Surprisingly, preeminent ornithologist Ernst Mayr conducted his research on female mate choice not in birds but in Drosopliila fruit flies; readers might be chagrined to learn of his declaration that "there is not as much difference as you might imagine." Despite this rich history of inquiry, the decades separating Descent of Man and Sociobiology are frequently dismissed by modern biologists as bereft of significant advancements in sexual selection. Milam attributes this narrative of "renewal" of sexual selection and female choice partly to efforts by organismal biologists to reclaim evolution from molecular biologists, whose recent triumphs in biochemistry threatened to monopolize public attention and funding. For Milam, this "eclipse narrative" served to paint evolutionary organismal biology as a dynamic field with pressing new questions that could be addressed only in nature, not in the laboratory. Fortunately, the momentum of synthesis cannot be contained, and today Darwin's second great idea is actively tested by dyed-in-the-wool field biologists and genomic technocrats alike—some times, even in tandem -ELEN ONEAL, Post doctoral Researcher, Duke University, 125 Science Drive, Durham, NC 27708, USA; e mail: eo22@duke.edu</page></plain_text>
