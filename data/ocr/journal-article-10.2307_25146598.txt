The author wishes to make grateful acknowledgement to the American Philosphical Society and to the National Re search Council for financing the expedition. She wishes to thank her companions in the field: Dr. A. J. Eardley, Department of Geology, Uni versity of Michigan, Mr. Kenneth Gorton, then a student in that department, and Mr. Norman Reynolds, at that time a student of Anthro pology at the University of Washington. We are indebted to Professor L. A. Baier of the University of Michigan for the design of the boats that carried us safely down the Yukon. These were built at Nenana on the Tanana by the members of the party under Dr. Eardley's direction. Drs. Philip Smith, S. R. Capps, J. B. Mertie, Gerald Fitzgerald, and R. H. Sargent of the Alaska Branch of the U. S. Geological Survey and Dr. Hugh S. Bostock of the Canadian Geological Survey gave us help and advice. The list of those who helped us in the field is too long to record, but we should like to express our appreciation of the true Alaskan hospitality accorded by Father MacElmeel and the Sisters at the Nulato Mission and by the Reverend and Mrs. Henry H. Chapman at Anvik. The research work in libraries and museums was made possible by a Fellowship of the National Research Council, 1936-1937. I wish to thank especially for their assistance in this phase of the work Dr. Diamond Jenness and Mr. Douglas Leechman at the Canadian Na tional Museum; Drs. Donald Scott and Lauris ton Ward at the Peabody Museum, Harvard; Mr. T. F. Mcllwraith and Mr. James Mellon Menzies at the Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology; Messrs. Douglas S. Byers and Frederick Johnson at Phillips Academy, An dover; Dr. Arthur C. Parker and William A. Ritchie at the Rochester Museum of Arts and Sciences; Dr. N. C. Nelson, Miss Bella Weitz ner, and Dr. Froehlich G. Rainey at the Ameri can Museum of Natural History; Mr. George G. Heye of the Museum of the American Indian; Mr. W. A. Newcombe of Victoria; Drs. Erna Gunther, Verne Ray, Viola Garfield and Melville Jacobs of the University of Washing ton; Dr. M. R. Harrington of the Southwest Museum; Mr. David Rogers of the Santa Barbara Museum; Dr. Emil Haury then at Gila Pueblo; Dr. Harold S. Colton and Miss Katharine Bartlett of the Museum of Northern Arizona; and Miss H. N. Wardle of the Uni versity of Pennsylvania Museum. Dr. Donald Horton generously contributed an analysis of the pottery wares. (See the Ap pendix.) Photographs of specimens in the Uni versity of Pennsylvania Museum were made by Mr. Reuben Goldberg. Checking of the references was made possible through a grant-in-aid from the Miller Research Fund of Bryn Mawr College, and Mrs. Charles David of Bryn Mawr undertook a heavy share of this burden. Mr. Henry B. Collins, Jr., of the Bureau of American Ethnology and Dr. J. Aiden Mason of the University of Pennsylvan a Museum read all of the manuscript with greiat care, cor recting many minor mistakes, pointing out major ones, and giving helpful encouragement. My two good friends, Harlan Ingersol Smith and William John Wintemberg, have died since this study was begun so that it is impossible to tell them again how much I owe them. Dr. Therkel Mathiassen and Dr. Kaj Birket-Smith, my former expedition companions who have taught me so much, I cannot thank until Den mark is free again. The above was written in 1942 when the manuscript was completed and I had hopes of early publication. These hopes could not be fulfilled and the manuscript languished for many months, apparently a war casualty. It was rescued from oblivion by Henry Collins, who had never lost interest in it, and was given by him to Douglas S. Byers, Editor, and Frederick Johnson, Treasurer of the Society for American Archaeology. They were con vinced that the manuscript should be pub lished. To these friends I owe more than I can express. They have been more than generous with their time and patience, and fortunate is the author who has had such assistance and the counsel of so wise an editorial pencil. The Society for American Archaeology has met a portion of the costs of publication and the remainder was contributed by an anonymous friend of the Society and by the University of Pennsylvania Museum. A further grant from the Miller Research Fund of Bryn Mawr Col lege has made possible the final preparation of the illustrations.

We investigated a great number of sites, most of which were very recent, dug at some that were older, and re turned with a rather small and miscella neous collection of archaeological and near archaeological specimens. We did not find any traces of the First Americans, who presumably had wandered up the valley in late Pleistocene or early Recent times. As was proper, after writing a few prelimi nary articles on what we had seen and found, I sat down to prepare a complete statement of the results of the expedition. It was originally entitled: "Notes on the Archaeology of the Middle and Lower Yukon Valley, Alaska." Then, when it seemed obvious that I should not return to Alaska in the immediate future, I tried to relate what we had discovered to that which had been published on the area by earlier explorers and to what had been found in the general neighborhood by archaeologists. I attempted, for example (see Chapter III), to locate all of the villages visited by Zagoskin, Dall, Allen, Schwatka, and Jacobsen, and to determine what tribal groups had lived along this part of the Yukon. During this stage of the investigations the words "Notes on" were dropped from the title of the report. However, it was inevitable that the com parisons of Yukon Indian specimens with those of their immediate neighbors should have tempted me ever further afield, until I found myself discussing the history of the adz, the hypothesis of a prehistoric culture drift from Japan to North America via the Aleutian Islands as evidenced by pottery styles, the position of the Dorset Eskimo culture, and the probable stages in the development of North west Coast culture! This book?for the report had meanwhile tripled in size?was theoreti cally completed in the fall of 1939. Dr. John Alden Mason, under whose encouragement and guidance the original start had been made, was then confronted with the final results, which he patiently and generously read. He pointed out to me that what I had written was "The Pre history of the American Arctic and Northwest as seen from the Yukon," and that I had buried all my most interesting and ambitious theories in obscure conclusions, even in an Appendix, as if I were determined that no reader should ever find them! I had, in fact, been guilty of committing every fault which I deplore in archaeological reports. The information and conclusions had been presented in the order in which I had writ ten them, not in the order in which the reader would like to come upon them. It is too late, unfortunately, to rewrite the book to meet these self-imposed criticisms. I can, however, make amends by rewriting my appendix as "Introductory Conclusions" for Chapter I, and by offering hints to the general reader as to what he will find most useful if he does not in tend to wade through the whole book. In Chapter II, which was originally the first, there is a general discussion about the Yukon Indians and the country in which they live. The summary of tribal subdivisions (pages 27-31) will be useful for reference, since the archaeo logical sites are classified according to the same scheme. Chapter III begins with a list of archaeo logical sites, classified according to present ethnographic boundaries, with references to the maps on which they can be located, and also classified according to the age suggested by material obtained. Names of the most impor tant are printed in italics, and accompanied by references to pages where they are described in detail. Three of these sites are drawn to the at tention of the general reader. The first sections of Chapters IV and V con tain information about burials and houses, pre historic and modern. In the last sections of these chapters the Yukon Indian traits are compared with those of other peoples in the same way that the excavated specimens are treated in Chapter IX, Chapters VI, VII, and VIII consist of de scriptions of the collections from the Indian sites and from some supposedly Eskimo sites. Chapter VI opens with a list of the types thus obtained, presented in the same order in which they are described in subsequent sections, and arranged in columns to show their occurrence in sites of prehistoric, historic and uncertain age. This classification of specimens supplements the classification of sites given in the first section of Chapter III. The second section of Chapter VI 1</page><page sequence="9">2 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 compares the specimens we found with those listed by Osgood from the Ingalik, the group of Indians living farthest down the Yukon. The remaining sections of this chapter are devoted to a description of the specimens, type by type, from Indian sites. Chapter VII deals with the pottery found at Indian and "Eskimo" sites, and Chapter VIII, with specimens from the "Eskimo" sites. While it may not be necessary for the reader to study this material carefully, he will have to understand what I mean by the names given to these types and what the specimens look like if he is to follow the detailed comparisons made in Chapter IX. Chapter IX, like the final sections in Chap ters IV and V, compares all the types found on the Yukon with similar or corresponding traits found archaeologically or ethnologically in various parts of North America and Asia. Since references are made to the plates in which the Yukon specimens are illustrated it may be pos sible to read these sections without consulting Chapters VI-VIII. If it is necessary to do so, however, page references to the description of the types will be found in the Index and in the Table of Contents. The analyses in Chapter IX are attempts to write a "Paleontology" of each type of tool or utensil represented by our Yukon specimens, tracing as far as it is possible the development of the type in order to show at what stage in its history it appears on the Yukon, and, if possible, from what source it reached this part of Alaska. This treatment is, of course, highly speculative, and from this study have grown my notions about the group ings of cultures which have been expounded rather dogmatically in the Introductory Con clusions; from it also has grown the reconstruc tion of Yukon Indian culture, summarized in the Final Conclusions in Chapter X. In this last chapter I have attempted to re weave the various strands isolated and un ravelled in the analyses made in Chapters IV, V and IX. Since the discussion is still another step removed from the data upon which it is ulti mately based, the treatment is even more speculative. If I have written with what seems to be dogmatic conviction, it is not because I am trying to proclaim these hypotheses as proven truth, but only because I have wanted to avoid a too liberal peppering of the text with the over-worked "probably, perhaps, ap parently, and it would seem." If I thought I had solved all the problems I have tried to raise, I should indeed have to offer an apology for spoil ing the fun.

The area is inhabited today by Athabaskan speaking Indians whom I call the Tena, follow ing Jette. These correspond to Osgood's Tanana, Koyukon and Ingalik. Practically all the specimens we shall have to discuss come from the territory of Osgood's last two tribes. These Tena had, at the time of white contact, a culture which was much like that of all the interior Alaskan Athabaskans, whom we can take as typical exponents of the Snowshoe hunting stage, discussed in Chapter X. The Tena differ from their relatives in two respects: first, they had a richer source of food in the salmon which come up the Yukon every sum mer to spawn, and second, they had borrowed much from the Eskimo. On the north, west, and southwest, Tena territory abutted on that of the Eskimo, and their strongest contacts were with the Eskimo of Kotzebue Sound, Norton Sound, the deltas of the Yukon and Kuskokwim, and Bristol Bay. This meant that they could and did receive ideas from both the northern and southern Alaskan Eskimo. On the east they were in contact with their relatives, the Han and Kutchin on the upper Yukon and with the Nabesna on the upper Tanana. On the south and southeast they met the Tanaina of Cook Inlet. These last were a group of Atha baskans who, I believe, had pushed down into Cook Inlet in relatively recent prehistoric times, dislodging an earlier Eskimo population. The Cook Inlet Eskimo were one of the groups be longing to the southwestern Alaskan Eskimo division, which also included the Eskimo of the Alaska Peninsula, Kodiak Island and Prince William Sound?peoples we call the Pacific Eskimo?and the Aleut. Influences from the southwestern Alaskan Eskimo could also reach the Tena, via either the Bristol Bay and Norton Sound Eskimo, or via the Tanaina. If we go farther down the coast of Alaska, beyond the Prince William Sound Eskimo, we come first to the little tribe of Eyak Indians at the mouth of the Copper River. The culture of these people has a very primitive stamp and, like that of the Eskimo in general, seems to have been based upon the Ice-hunting cultural sub stratum further discussed in Chapter X^. They have received very little of the later Snowshoe hunting traits, although they traded with the Athabaskan Atna above them on the Copper River. Their culture is really like that which we should expect to find underlying the present specialized culture of the Northwest Coast. Their language, also, strengthens this feeling of their cultural position, for they seem to speak a form of Na-Dene, that stock which embraces Tlingit, Haida and Athabaskan.1 Beyond the Eyak are the northern Northwest Coast In dians: the Tlingit, Haida and Tsimshian; be yond them again the southern Northwest Coast tribes: Kwakiutl, Nootka-Makah, Coast Salish and Lower Chinook. The Salish, I believe, have preserved many of the aspects of what must have been an early stage of northern Northwest Coast culture, intermediate between the pattern we felt to be basic to the Eyak and the full flowering of the last centuries. South of the Salish, Northwest Coast cultural traits become fainter and fainter down the coast of Washing ton and Oregon to die away in California. Northwest Coast influences have been strong among the Eyak and Tanaina and among the southern Eskimo groups, including both the Aleut-Pacific Eskimo and the tribes of the Bristol Bay-Norton Sound area, and some of these traits have been passed on to the Tena. I think we can distinguish between two strata of influences; the most recent and striking being due to diffusion from the "typical" and specialized culture of the northern Northwest Coast, the older suggesting diffusion from the "intermediate stage" represented today by the southern Northwest Coast tribes, especially by the Coast Salish. On the Northwest Plateau, behind these coastal tribes, are inland peoples who have also been influenced by them. These are, from north to south, the Athabaskan Tuchone, Tahltan, Tsetsaut, Sekani, Carrier, Chilcotin and Nicola, and the Interior Salish. These peoples have often made the same kind of choice in borrowing from the coast as have the Tena and Tanaina. 1 Sapir, 1915; Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, Appen dix n. 3</page><page sequence="11">4 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 In discussing the history of the cultural traits possessed by the Tena we shall have to deal with all these northwestern American tribes. Sometimes our distribution studies will take us down into California and even out into the Plains and the Southwest. Since the archaeology of the Northwest Coast is still locked in the ground, I will postpone a summary of what I believe happened in that area until we have seen what light Eskimo archaeology can shed. Because borrowings of Eskimo culture traits by the Tena have been so important, we shall have to deal extensively with the Eskimo. The present Eskimo may be grouped into four major divisions, as follows:2 1. The Greenlanders, all of whom are de scendants of colonists from Canada, and who fall today into (a) East Coast, (b) West Coast, and (c) Polar subdivisions. 2. The Central Eskimo of Canada, com prising (a) coastal groups in Labrador, (b) southern Baffinlanders, (c) Iglulik of northern Baffinland and Melville Peninsula, (d) Netsilik of King William Land, (e) Caribou Eskimo, the most typical bands of whom live on the Barren Grounds in the interior west of Hudson Bay, and who may be considered either as the most primitive of all Eskimo or the most de generate of the Central group, (/) Copper Eskimo of the Northwest Passage. 3. Western Eskimo, comprising the tribes at (a) the Mackenzie Delta, (b) northern Alaska from Point Barrow to Seward Peninsula and including the Diomede Islands, (c) Colville River in the northern Alaskan interior, (d) St. Lawrence Island and East Cape, Siberia, and lastly (e) Norton Sound to Bristol Bay. The last group is intermediate between the northwestern and southwestern Alaskan groups. Perhaps the northern Alaskan group should be further subdivided to distinguish between the Eskimo of Point Barrow, Kotzebue Sound, and Seward Peninsula. 4. The Pacific Eskimo and Aleut of south western Alaska. Archaeological and historical evidence tells us that Eskimo territory was once greater than it is now. For example, parts of Greenland and of the northern Canadian Arctic were formerly inhabited by Eskimo who have since moved away or died out. There were certainly settle 2 See the detailed list of tribes in Birket-Smith, 1936, pp. 225 ff. Cf. also Kroeber, 1939, pp. 20-27. ments in northern Newfoundland and on the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, which we can assign to an extinct phase of Eskimo culture known as the Dorset. In Siberia, the Eskimo once lived as far west as the Kolyma River, to judge by archaeological finds and by Eskimo place names in present Chukchee ter ritory. I have already said that the Pacific Eskimo had to yield all, or at least the lower part of Cook Inlet to the Tanaina, and now have only a small settlement near the mouth of the inlet, below Kachemak Bay. The Prince William Sound Eskimo territory formerly in cluded Kayak Island and Controller Bay, east of the Copper River, from which the Eskimo were driven by the Tlingit about the end of the eighteenth century. All anthropologists have been impressed by the striking homogeneity of the Eskimo in race, language and culture. However, in all three respects there is a rather sharp boundary dividing the southwestern Alaskan tribes from all the others. A major distinction between the "typical" long-headed Eskimo and the more round-headed Pacific Eskimo and Aleut can be made, although the Alaskan groups as a whole show tendencies towards brachycephaly. In culture, the Bristol Bay-Norton Sound group occupy a transitional position. A great linguistic boundary is also found at Norton Sound: all the peoples north and east of this locality can understand each other's speech but they cannot understand the dialects spoken by the more southern Alaskans, or by the Eskimo of St. Lawrence Island and Siberia. Aleut is a separate language in the Eskimo-Aleut stock. There is no doubt that southwestern Alaska has had a history different from that of the rest of Eskimo territory, and this is confirmed by the archaeo logical record. One last observation might be made about modern Eskimo culture and that is that the most striking similarities are between the culture of the Greenlanders and that of the Western Eskimo, especially the Point Barrow group. The Central Eskimo who live between make a minor break in this continuity. In Asia, beyond the small Eskimo territory along the Siberian shore of Bering Strait, we shall have to deal with a number of tribes. First, there will be the simpler peoples known as the' Palae-Siberians or Palae-Asiatics: the Chuk chee, Koryak, Kamchadal, Gilyak of Sakhalin Island, and the Ainu of the Kuriles and Hok kaido, and formerly of northern Japan (Honshu Island). In this group there are also the</page><page sequence="12">de lacuna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 5 Yukaghir and the isolated Yenisei-Ostyak. Second, there are the more advanced Ural Altaic peoples, who probably have displaced the Palae-Asiatics from part of their former territory. These are the Tungus, Yakut, Ostyak, and Samoyed. We shall deal with some of these. Since all of these Siberians have ex hibited in more or less diluted form the spread ing of cultural influences from higher centers, we will also have to refer to the Neolithic of Siberia, especially of Manchuria and Mongolia, and to the Bronze Age and Neolithic of northern China. We shall pay particular attention to the prehistory of the Japanese archipelago since we will find many cultural similarities linking the prehistoric Ainu and the Pacific Eskimo Aleut. On the other hand, we will find close ties between the Chukchee and Koryak of north eastern Siberia and the Western Eskimo. All of the Siberian peoples have cultures originally based on the ancient Ice-hunting way of life, over which has been laid a strong development of the Snowshoe complex, topped off for most of them by reindeer breeding, and mingled with traits from China and from other centers of high culture. ESKIMO ARCHAEOLOGY Since the archaeology of the Eskimo is particularly well known I shall give only a sketch of what I believe to have been their history. Probably none of my colleagues will be in complete agreement with me, but at least the reader will be able to understand the as sumptions that have been made in the course of this study. The oldest Eskimo cultures of which we have any knowledge are the Old Bering Sea, Ipiutak, Kachemak Bay I, and Dorset. These may all be roughly contemporaneous and they carry us back to the beginning of the Christian era, prob ably some of them far beyond that point. I ap pend a chart of Eskimo prehistory which is a compromise between the estimates of chronol ogy made by various writers.3 Setting aside the Ipiutak culture, the distinctive traits of which seem to have played little or no part in the de velopment of Eskimo culture, we have at the dawn of Eskimo prehistory three major divi sions: The Eskimo on the Pacific (Kachemak ? Mathiassen, 19366, Chapter VI; Birket-Smith, 1936, Chapter I; Collins, 1940, Fig. 36; Jenness, 1940, mimeo graphed supplement; Rowley, 1940, Fig. 5. For a briefer version of the chart cf. de Laguna, 1946. Bay I), the Eskimo on the Arctic (Old Bering Sea), and the Eskimo on the Atlantic (Dorset). Eventually the last group was absorbed by descendants of the second. As Kroeber has expressed it: "The two grand divisions would then be Eskimo on the Arctic Ocean and Eskimo on the Pacific."4 The Old Bering Sea culture5 furnished the basic pattern, or at least a major part of it, for all the northern Eskimo groups who at present live from Bering Strait to Greenland. It came into being some time in the last millennium B.C., flourished on St. Lawrence and the Diomede Islands, at Cape Prince of Wales (?), and probably in Siberia also, although we can not be sure that the specimens found in Siberia were not carried there by trade.8 Its influence was felt as far north as Point Barrow and as far south as the Kuskokwim, if indeed it was not actually at home on the Alaskan mainland.7 Collins suggests that it came to an end about a.d. 1; Rowley would have it last until a.d. 700; I compromise by suggesting a terminal date of a.d. 100, allowing a little overlap with the Birnirk culture at Point Barrow (see below). The distinctive Old Bering Sea art, which in cluded carving in the round and especially delicate curvilinear patterns of incised lines, falls into three styles. Style 1, the oldest, is cruder and more scratchy;8 the later Styles, 2 and 3 (roughly contemporaneous ?), are the best that the Eskimo have ever produced. The type sites of the culture are those excavated by Collins on St. Lawrence Island. What Rainey has called the "Okvik"9 is not a separate cul ture, antedating Collins' Old Bering Sea, but is simply an early phase of the latter, charac terized by Style 1. Most of Collins' material is associated with Styles 2 and 3. Aside from the heart-shaped ivory objects and the carved ivory figurines, none of the Okvik or Old Bering Sea 1 types are different from those of Old Bering Sea 2 and 3, and indeed the art and the ivory "winged" objects exhibit a continuous develop ment which can be traced from Old Bering Sea 1, not only through the more mature Old 4 Kroeber, 1939, p. 27, note 11. 6 Collins, 1937a. 6 Collins, 1929, Fig. 1; cf. specimens in National Mu seum of Norway. 7 Pt.

The more systematic excavations of 1934 were also made by Eskimo, directed by Geist and Ivar Skarland. Although Rainey tells us that "The results of that expedition and the collections obtained are the main consideration of the following account,"11 the collection as published contains some specimens which are certainly much younger in age than the bulk of the material, and which presumably came from a great site of the Punuk culture only a short distance away. We can be sure of the intrusive origin of those that are decorated in the typical Punuk style; others, which belong to types found by Collins only in Punuk culture sites and not in Old Bering Sea deposits, raise the suspicion of similar intrusion. Only line draw ings of the Okvik material have been published and these do not show the degree of patination which would have given us clues in doubtful cases. Rainey's somewhat uncritical handling of the material makes it difficult for us to know, except in the case of decorated specimens, just what types belong to Old Bering Sea 1. The Ipiutak culture,12 recently discovered by Froelich Rainey, Helge Larsen, and J. L. Giddings at Point Hope, is difficult to place. It may be a local and highly divergent phase of the Old Bering Sea culture, undoubtedly old fashioned in many respects. Much of the art is definitely similar to the Old Bering Sea styles, and Collins recognizes a type of harpoon head which is particularly associated with Style l.13 The majority of the utilitarian objects are not only Eskimo but many point particularly to the Old Bering Sea and Birnirk cultures. However, the Ipiutak must be contrasted with these because it lacks ground slate tools, hand sleds, and any form of lamp or cooking pot, either of stone or pottery. The Ipiutak Eskimo lived in a tremendous village of semisubterranean 10 Heart-shaped objects (Rainey, op. cit., Fig. 35, 1-3), figurines (Figs. 27-30), winged objects (Fig. 26). Cf. Col lins, 1940, Pis. 14,15. 11 Rainey, 1941a, p. 465. 12 Rainey, 19416. 18 Collins, 1940, p. 558. Collins, 1943, published after this was written, considers the relationships of Ipiutak and Old Bering Sea more fully. wooden houses, arranged in blocks and "ave nues," and their graveyard contains some burials in log tombs accompanied by elaborate and often fantastic grave goods. The site must have been occupied over a long period, and Rainey has pointed out that different parts of the site are of different ages. The very fine flint chipping, the best produced by any Eskimo, and the frequent use of these small blades as edging for ivory weapons in typically "Meso lithic" fashion argue connections with the Neolithic of Siberia and northern China, where similar "Mesolithic" techniques were com mon.14 In respect both to lack of ground slate and to the development of chipped flint, the Ipiutak is more old-fashioned than either the Old Bering Sea, or the Birnirk of Point Barrow, both of which not only produced ground slate but used "Mesolithic" side-blades only in harpoon heads. However, I cannot believe that the Ipiutak is "the parent culture, predicted by Jenness, from which the already-known Birnirk and Old Bering Sea cultures of that region have evolved,"15 first, because the art, resembling not only Style 1 but Style 2, suggests contem poraneity with the Old Bering Sea, and second, because the culture is too divergent. The most divergent types are those found in the graves. There was evidently an elaborate cult of the dead which involved not only burial in a cemetery, but sometimes cleaning of the bones and reassembly, furnishing the skeletons with artificial eyeballs, plugs for the nasal apertures and covers for the mouth in some cases. At least one log tomb seems to have been decorated with mask-like ornaments of sewed-on ivory plates and studs. The dead were provided not only with utilitarian objects, but also with "pretzel-like" ivory carvings?I can think of no better description?unique in Eskimo archaeology. I do not think that these were used by the living, although shamans may have possessed some for dealing with spirits. I be lieve that they were intended for ghostly use, for the many openings suggest the Copper Eskimo shaman's description of a storm spirit:1* "And see now?there among the hosts of naked ones in flight is one, a single figure, a man pierced all into holes by the wind. His body is but a mass of holes, and the wind howls 14 Rainey, 19416, p. 374; Collins, 1943, p. 224. 16 Rowley, 1940, p. 499. 16 Rasmussen, 1927, p. 277.</page><page sequence="15">8 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 through them?Tchee-u-u-u; tchee-u-u-u. Hear! He is the mightiest of them all." Unfortunately we know too little of Old Bering Sea burial customs to be able to make comparisons between those and the Ipiutak. On St. Lawrence Island and on the adjacent Siberian and Alaskan coasts, the Old Bering Sea culture was transformed into the Punuk,17 largely because of enrichments from Siberia. The transformation is clearly reflected in the art, which becomes stiffer and more precise in the Early Punuk when the makers seem to have access to iron engraving tools, and which finally in the mature Punuk (a.d. 500-1400) adopted the mechanically perfect circle, drawn with a metal-tipped compass. In other aspects of culture also, the Early Punuk (a.d. 100-500) represents a transitional stage. Collins places the climax of the Early Punuk just before a.d. 500 and the climax of the mature Punuk just before a.d. 1000. North of Bering Strait, particularly at Point Barrow, we have remains of the Birnirk cul ture.18 This shares much with the Punuk, especially with the Early Punuk, and also with the Old Bering Sea. Decorative art is scanty, as Collins has remarked; what there is suggests the primitive patterns of Style l.19 Some of the Old Bering Sea types found at or near Point Barrow suggest trade, I believe, rather than the presence at an earlier period of the Old Bering Sea culture itself. One harpoon head20 may be a Birnirk copy of an Old Bering Sea head. There was certainly a good deal of give and take between Birnirk and Punuk, accounting for the presence of Birnirk-like harpoon heads in Punuk deposits on St. Lawrence Island and for the spread of Punuk traits of Siberian origin to the Birnirk culture. The southernmost Birnirk site in Alaska is a late one at Cape Prince of Wales; the westernmost finds have been made in Siberia.21 Collins originally sug gested that the Birnirk was a direct descendant of the Old Bering Sea, but more recently modified this hypothesis to suggest that Old Bering Sea 1 may have been the parent. "But whereas the stage of culture represented by 17 Collins, 1937a. 18 J. A. Mason, 1930. 19 Collins, 1940, pp. 557 f. 20 J. A. Mason, 1930, PL V, L 21 Collins, 1940, pp. 555 f. East Cape, Siberia (Mathias sen, 1930a, PI. 18; Bogoras, 1904r-1909, I, Fig. 33), Puoten Bay, Siberia (WSM); Kolyma River, Siberia (Mathiassen, 1927, H, p. 180). style 1 led directly to those represented by Old Bering Sea styles 2 and 3, there was probably an intervening and as yet undiscovered stage between the 'parent culture' and the Birnirk as we now know it, as the latter seems to have been contemporaneous at least in part with the Punuk."22 Jenness has also pointed out that the Birnirk was established in Siberia and in Alaska north of Bering Strait, while the Old Bering Sea and Punuk were concentrated south of that line. He felt, however, that both Old Bering Sea and Birnirk were the "offspring of some less advanced culture that flourished on the north east coast of Siberia around the mouths of the Kolyma and Indigirka Rivers."231 had also felt that one ought to find "somewhere in the north a simpler, less specialized stage than the Old Bering Sea culture . . . [which influenced] the development of the Birnirk-Thule series."24 We cannot as yet solve this problem. The Birnirk is either the grandchild of Old Bering Sea 1 by an unknown parent, according to Collins; the brother of Old Bering Sea by an unknown parent, according to Jenness; or the half brother or nephew of Old Bering Sea, according to my guess. In point of time, I believe that it overlaps the last stages of the Old Bering Sea and all of the Early Punuk, and, following in the main Collins, I have assigned it to the period from a.d. 1 to 500, but it may well have lasted longer than this in some areas. It is con ceivable that a few influences from the Ipiutak survived into the Birnirk. The Thule culture is the offspring of the Birnirk. This culture is best known from the classic sites in Canada,25 to which it was carried by emigrants from Alaska. As yet only one Alaskan Thule site has been excavated; this is the site at Cape Prince of Wales investigated by Jenness and by Collins,26 which yielded a sequence of late Birnirk and Alaskan Thule. This Thule stage was contemporaneous with the mature Punuk on St. Lawrence Island, with which it shared much. The Alaskan Thule and Punuk may be regarded as cousins that have intermarried. I suspect, however, that the main development of the Thule was farther north in Alaska; Collins suggests the north coast, east of Point Barrow.27 Certainly the Thule people of 22 Collins, 1937a, p. 372; 1940, pp. 558 f. 23 Jenness, 1940, p. 10. 24 de Laguna, 1938, p. 303. 26 Mathiassen 1927. 28 Jenness, 1928; Coffins, 19376, p. 377; 1940, p. 561. 27 Coffins, 19376, p. 377.</page><page sequence="16">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 9 Cape Prince of Wales were not the ones to migrate to Canada, for they possessed specific Punuk traits, not shared with either the Birnirk or the Canadian Thule cultures. We may place this Alaskan Thule stage between a.d. 500 and 1400, contemporaneous with the mature Punuk. The Thule peoples began their migration east ward rather early in this period, arriving in Canada about a.d. 800. This great migration was stimulated, according to Jenness, by the introduction of the large breed of sled dog from Siberia and by the development of whaling.28 Perhaps associated with the last was an im provement in the umiak, or large, open skin boat used by the Eskimo for whaling and sum mer travel. Neither Birnirk nor Thule is found south of Bering Strait. Rainey's "Birnirk" and "Thule" stages on St. Lawrence Island are really Early Punuk and late Punuk.29 There is no evidence of a separate stage of Thule culture on the island, unless the "round semi-subterranean whale bone house of the Thule type at Kit neapaluk (St. Lawrence Island) containing only Thule harpoon heads"30 is really Thule. How ever, I suspect that these "Thule" heads, like those of Rainey's Kukulik site are really late Punuk forms, and the house, though described as round, suggests the square to rectangular whale bone house of the late Punuk.31 When the Thule immigrants arrived in Canada they found the eastern Canadian Arctic and sub-Arctic already settled by bearers of the Dorset culture. A discussion of the position and probable age of the Dorset may be postponed for a moment. It is sufficient to say now that it bears no direct relationship to the series of Eskimo cultures that we have been discussing and that it is probably very old. For a time, between perhaps a.d. 800 and 1000, the Thule and Dorset Eskimo lived side by side, trading. Eventually the Dorset were swamped, disap peared from some areas, and in others, es pecially southern Baffinland and the islands in Hudson Bay, mingled with the Thule invaders.32 In the meantime, the Thule culture had as sumed its peculiar Canadian form, an evolution undoubtedly stimulated to some extent by 28 Jenness, 1940, p. 11. 29 Geist and Rainey, 1936, pp. 227 ff.; de Laguna, 1939a. 30 Rainey, 1941a, p. 562. 31 Collins, 1937a, p. 261. 32 Jenness (1940, p. 11) estimates that a mixed group of Thule and Dorset descent lived on in southeastern Baffin 1 and until the sixteenth century. Dorset loans. The period of Thule domination in the Canadian Arctic I would place between a.d. 1000 and 1500. Then the Thule people were themselves overrun by a movement of Eskimo tribes from the Barren Grounds west of Hudson Bay who pushed out to the coast. I have sug gested a.d. 1500 as the date when this impact was first felt on the coast, but the movement was still in progress in the eighteenth century. Jenness has suggested a.d. 1200 for the be ginning of this exodus from the interior.33 We might even take the extinction of the old fashioned Sadlermiut of Southampton Island in 1902 and the occupation of the island by a branch of the modern Iglulik Eskimo as mark ing the final ripple of this movement. Although Thule traits were striking in Sadlermiut cul ture, Dorset elements (not all of which Mathias sen recognized) were also so strong that it would be difficult to say whether the Sadlermiut were the last of the Thule or the last of the Dorset.34 The immigrants from the interior of the Barren Grounds are the modern Central Eskimo proper. The Caribou Eskimo are the remnant that was left behind. It is still impossible to say whether these last inland people were survivors of the oldest and most primitive Eskimo group, as Birket-Smith has argued, or whether they were only an offshoot of the early Thule peoples who turned inland and became degenerate through isolation, as Mathiassen and Collins believe.35 In any case, I can see no evidence of any connection between them and the Dorset Eskimo, which Jenness at one time suggested in an attempt to reconcile these opposed views.36 Modern Central Eskimo culture is thus a blend of three ingredients, Dorset, Thule, and inland Canadian. But before the Thule culture had disappeared from Canada, its carriers had initiated further migrations in two directions. The earliest of these, about a.d. 1000, was northeastward across the narrow strait between Ellesmereland and Greenland. Their first new settlements were in the Thule district, the present home of the Polar Eskimo.37 From here they spread down the west coast, around the southern tip of Greenland and up the east coast, where this 33 Birket-Smith, 1930, pp. 9,18; Jenness, 19376, p. 35. 84 Mathiassen, 1927,1, pp. 285 ff. 36 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, p. 226; Mathiassen, 1927, II, p. 200; Collins, 1937a, pp. 379 ff. 36 Jenness, 1933, p. 395. 37 Wissler, 1918; Mathiassen, 1927,1, pp. 293-304; Holt ved, 1938.</page><page sequence="17">10 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 southern movement met with a similar but much smaller migration to the east coast around the northern end of the great island.38 The Thule immigrants to Greenland had prob ably been preceded by the Dorset. In any case we have Dorset finds from the Thule district and from the west coast down as far as the Arctic Circle. We do not know whether the Eskimo remains seen by Erik the Red in a.d. 983 in southwest Greenland were Dorset, or Thule, or mixed. The most important modifica tion of Thule culture in Greenland, which forms the basis for modern Greenland culture in the west and east, was the Inugsuk stage, a.d. 1200 to 1400, during which time the Eskimo were in contact with the Norsemen. In the proto historic period, a.d. 1400 to 1650 on the west coast, modifications were made to adjust the Inugsuk culture to local conditions. Contact with European whaling expeditions, which began about a.d. 1650, inaugurates the modern period. A last small migration, consisting of 14 Eskimo from Baffinland, came to the Polar Eskimo in 1864, resulting in a thin veneer of modern Central Eskimo over what had been practically pure Thule culture.39 In the meantime, all contact was probably not lost between the Thule Eskimo in Canada and their relatives in northern Alaska for I know of one Punuk type harpoon head that was found on Devon Island, north of Baffinland,40 and a number of plain lamps from northern Alaska and Siberia suggest the presence of diluted Thule influence (see Chapter IX, pp. 256-257). In any case, about a.d. 1400 or per haps later, there began a return to northern Alaska of Canadian Thule Eskimo, introducing not only the Canadian Thule culture but even the physical type of its carriers. This movement was probably accelerated by the pressure of the inland tribes who were pushing to the Canadian Arctic shores. The return Thule migration, as Collins has pointed out, explains the present striking uniformity of language, folklore, cul ture and somatology from northern Alaska to Greenland which stands in such a strong con 38 For a general survey of Greenland archaeology see the conclusion of Mathiassen, 19366. West Coast archaeology is treated in Mathiassen, 19306; 1931; 1934a; and 19366. East Coast archaeology is discussed in Mathiassen, 1933; 19346; 1936a; Larsen, 1934; and 1938. 39 Birket-Smith, 1930, p. 10. 40 Collins* open socket type III (a) x, NMC catalogue number JX-C-2813. trast to the lack of uniformity between northern and southern Alaska.41 The protohistoric and modern cultures of Point Barrow and Point Hope42 are thus Alaskan Thule (?), though not yet isolated in that area, overlaid with Cana dian Thule. The protohistoric culture of St. Lawrence Island and of East Cape, Siberia,43 is late Punuk, colored with Thule influences which grow stronger in the modern period. I would place the protohistoric period of Point Barrow, St. Lawrence Island, and Siberia be tween a.d. 1400 and 1700. The last date is suggested by Gidding's study of tree-rings at Kukulik on St. Lawrence Island. He estimates that the most recent protohistoric house was built about 1691 or shortly after and was abandoned by a.d. 1730.44 During this proto historic period there were a few iron tools on St. Lawrence Island, imported from Siberia. The modern cultures of the Siberian and Alas kan Eskimo also show specifically Siberian traits.45 In Alaska, south of Norton Sound and north of the Alaska Peninsula, there are far fewer Thule traits but more Punuk survivals, overlaid with Northwest Coast loans. These last may have been moving northward as early as the end of the Punuk, but do not make them selves very evident in the culture of the Western Eskimo until modern times. South of Bristol Bay, the Aleut and Pacific Eskimo culture has had a very different history. The earliest culture stage in this area is unfor tunately known from only one site and is not documented by many specimens. I have called this stage Kachemak Bay I,46 and we may as sume that a comparable culture (or cultures) once existed over the whole area, since Kache mak Bay I already bears traits?stone lamp, simple stone carving, labret, harpoon socket piece in two parts, detachable barbed dart head, etc.?which are distinctively southwest ern Alaskan in character. A number of other traits, the antiquity of which is suggested by their primitive form, wide distribution, and occurrence in other archaeological sites in the great North Pacific area, probably also belonged 41 Collins, 1937a, pp. 366-371. 42 Mathiassen, 1930a, Chapters IV, V; Murdoch, 1892. 43 St. Lawrence Island (Geist and Rainey, 1936, pp. 134 165), Siberia (Mathiassen, 1930a, Chapter VI; material from latest graves at Puoten Bay, WSM). 44 Giddings, 1941, p. 82. 45 Bogoras, 1904-1909; E.

Because of the reliance upon chipped stone; use of open, not closed, socket harpoon heads; breeding of Eskimo dogs, and other features, Kachemak Bay I may also be described as exhibiting a generalized, old-fashioned Eskimo character. In what way it is related to other ancient Eskimo cultures is still difficult to say. It represents something as different from Old Bering Sea as the latter is from Dorset. It is hard to estimate its age, but I should imagine that it was estab lished along the shores of the Gulf of Alaska before the Christian era, and that it lasted until about a.d. 500. In southern Cook Inlet it was succeeded by Kachemak Bay II, a stage which is really only transitional to Kachemak Bay III. Kachemak Bay II lasted from a.d. 500 to 1000, and Kache mak Bay III from a.d. 1000 to 1700.47 The latter can be divided into Sub-Ill, developed, and late. The basic pattern of Kachemak Bay III, with local modifications, is represented by archaeological finds in Prince William Sound, Kodiak Island, the Alaska Peninsula, and the Aleutian Islands.48 Probably Kachemak Bay II was also present in these areas. The Third Stage is characterized not only by the develop ment of local types but by the introduction of foreign traits. Some of these came from the Asiatic side of the North Pacific, brought by a circum-Pacific culture drift; others have come from the Northwest Coast and link Kachemak Bay III with the "intermediate" southern Northwest Coast culture.49 The physical type associated with the various Kachemak Bay III cultures was like the long-headed type found in ancient Coast Salish sites.50 Hrdlicka de scribes these "Pre-Koniags," as he calls them, as "neither true Eskimo nor Aleut." "These were an oblong- and medium high-headed type, occasionally somewhat eskimoid, but more commonly Indian-like. Their latest strains [on the Aleutian Islands] admixed more or less 47 Op. cit.y pp. 122-129. 48 Prince William Sound (Birket-Smith and de Laguna, field notes, 1933), Kodiak Island (Specimens in NMD, AMNH; Hrdlicka, 1932; 1935; 1936; 1944), Alaska Penin sula (Weyer, 1930), Aleutian Islands (Dall, 18776; 1878; Jochelson, 1925; Weyer, 1929; Hrdli&amp;a, 1937; 1938; 1939; 1945). 49 de Laguna, 1934, pp. 215-217; Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, pp. 519 ff.; de Laguna, 1940, p. 73. 60 Hrdlicka, 1935, p. 52; 1936, p. 52; 1937,p. 62; 1938, pp. 90, 92; 1941, p. 412; 1944; 1945. with the broad- and low-headed Aleut." On Kodiak Island, also, they were replaced about 400 years ago by the "Aleut," or Koniag. In his last publications, Hrdlicka distinguishes between the two early, long-headed groups, "Pre-Aleut" and "Pre-Koniag," but admits a close relationship between the round-headed Aleuts and Koniags. During Kachemak Bay III there was doubt less diffusion of southwestern Alaskan traits to both Asiatic and Indian recipients. The end of this period in Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound is marked by trade in copper obtained from the interior Athabaskans, perhaps also from sources within Eskimo territory. On Cook Inlet, the Eskimo were actually driven out of Kachemak Bay by the invading Tan aina. There is also evidence that small amounts of iron, and blue glass beads of what I call the "Cook" type were obtained by the Pacific Eskimo prior to the arrival of the Russians. During all this development there are sur prisingly few evidences of cultural exchange between the Aleut - Pacific Eskimo and the Western Eskimo farther north in Alaska. Metal cut lines, which appear in Kachemak Bay II, indicate Punuk (probably Early Punuk) in fluences; the compass-drawn dot-and-circle of the Third Period was derived from mature Punuk art. Barbed slate blades and labrets, on the other hand, were traveling from south to north, and appear sporadically in protohistoric sites in northern Alaska. In modern times the labret spread to the mouth of the Mackenzie. The modern Pacific Eskimo and Aleut cul tures, after a.d. 1700, belong to the period of Russian expansion, and are also characterized by strong influence from the developed north ern Northwest Coast culture. Many or most of the traits assigned to the partially hypothetical "Pacific Eskimo I" are not confined to southwestern Alaska. They are distributed from western North America?not only from the Northwest Coast and northern plateaus, but some even from California?to the Asiatic shores of the North Pacific, and beyond. They are probably Ice-hunting traits, like those which link the northern Eskimo with the northern Eurasian peoples, but they tend to lie in a belt farther to the south, although the line between the two systems of links is often hazy. We should probably attempt, therefore, to distinguish between an Arctic aspect of the Ice-hunting horizon and what I shall call the</page><page sequence="19">12 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 "North Pacific cultural continuum." This last must be conceived as a very ancient counter part of the circum-Pacific culture drift of the last millennium, since this continuum must be at least two thousand years old. The traits linking the various local expressions of the con tinuum rarely occur at Bering Strait, and this makes us wonder whether the cultural ex changes responsible for their diffusion did not take place between the Aleutian Islands and Kamchatka, even though this hypothesis would involve a greater development of navigation at that early period than we should like to grant. If we discard this hypothesis, we must postulate some form of ancient culture at Bering Strait containing the North Pacific traits, and ante cedent to the Old Bering Sea culture. Neither choice is very satisfactory. Another difficult problem will be to distinguish between traits belonging to the older North Pacific continuum and those of the much later circum-Pacific drift. We know practically nothing about the archaeology of the northern Northwest Coast (southeastern Alaska and northern British Columbia). If we were to dig in this area, I suspect that we would find the following se quence: 1. An ancient simple substratum of culture, like that which exists today in modified form among the Eyak. This would be a Northwest Coast expression of the North Pacific continu um, and would probably correspond with Kachemak Bay I. 2. An "intermediate" stage, like that found among the prehistoric Coast Salish and which, but slightly modified, has persisted on the southern Northwest Coast. Exchange of traits with the Pacific Eskimo probably began in this period, which I would equate with Kachemak Bay II. Such exchange did not reach a climax until the next period. 3. Shortly after a.d. 1000, when influences from the Northwest Coast had given Kachemak Bay III its distinctive stamp, Asiatic elements belonging to the circum-Pacific culture drift began to appear on the northern Northwest Coast. This period would be roughly contempo raneous with Kachemak Bay sub-Ill and de veloped III, but possibly ended about a.d. 1500. 4. In protohistoric times the Asiatic traits had been integrated into the Indian culture and produced the highly specialized northern Northwest Coast phase, which, acting as a second center of diffusion, strongly influenced the southern Eskimo, Indians of the interior plateaus, and southern Northwest Coast. On the southern Northwest Coast (southern British Columbia and Washington) the se quence would be: 1. Ancient substratum of culture, corre sponding to Kachemak Bay I. 2. "Intermediate" stage of culture repre sented by the Coast Salish sites excavated by H. I. Smith.51 This period probably corre sponded to Kachemak Bay II and to most of Kachemak Bay III, a.d. 500 to 1500. 3. Protohistoric stage, beginning about a.d. 1500, or possibly a little later, marked by a spread of Asiatic traits, probably as a result of secondary diffusion from the northern North west Coast, and also by a movement of Interior Salish tribes to the coast. The long-headed population was submerged by a round-headed element, already present on the coast in the previous period. At this time the shed type of house was probably introduced among the Coast Salish. This hypothetical sequence of events in southwestern Alaska and on the Northwest Coast differs in some details from Collins' re construction. First, he feels that many more of the elements of the circum-Pacific drift were of American, not Asiatic, origin than Birket Smith and I are willing to admit, and second, he notes that a number of specific Northwest Coast features, which are lacking, or appear only in modern times in Pacific Eskimo-Aleut culture, are even more characteristic of south eastern Asia or even Oceania than of northeast ern Asia. To explain this: "... the possibility should be recognized that they may have been brought to America directly across the Pacific in relatively recent times."52 However, we know that a culture drift was moving north up the coast of Asia in ancient times and that it brought many elements of southeastern Asiatic and Oceanic origin to the Ainu.53 Some of these may have belonged to the North Pacific continuum, and have been temporarily lost in part of the area. Many of the elements are such that they could not be discovered archaeolog ically, so that I hesitate to accept the hypoth esis of trans-Pacific diffusion to the North 51 H. I.

Other elements, which I feel sure be longed to the later circum-Pacific drift, seem to have passed through southwestern Alaska with out leaving any lasting trace of their passage. The chronological scheme which I have pre sented is rather similar to that proposed by Kroeber, who sees the original center of North west Coast culture in the Gulf of Georgia and lower Fraser area of the Coast Salish. Later, this shifted to the Kwakiutl, Heiltsuk and Bella Coola, who are really intermediate between the northern and southern cultures; after the middle of the nineteenth century it had passed to the Haida, Tsimshian and Tlingit. "From both the northward centering and recent north ward trerid of the climax of the whole North west Coast, it is expectable that more refined analysis will confirm the conjecture that Asiatic influences perhaps were more potent tha,n Nu clear (Middle) American ones in the specific shaping of Northwest Coast culture. If direct Oceanic influences have ever to be reckoned with, they may complicate the picture."64 We must now return to the Dorset culture. As I have said, before the arrival of the Thule immigrants about a.d. 800, bearers of the Dor set Eskimo culture were already established in eastern Canada, and may even have been colo nizing Greenland. Evidence, though inconclu sive, suggests that Dorset remains from Green land belong to a period prior to the Thule migration to that island, and were not carried there by a mixed Thule-Dorset people. We assume that the Dorset people were Eskimo, although, as far as I know, we have never found any skeletal remains attributable to them. Type sites have been found near Iglulik, north west of Hudson Bay, and in northern and south ern Baffinland, islands ih Hudson Bay, and northern Newfoundland.65 The culture seems to have centered in southern Baffinland and the islands in the northern part of Hudson Bay. Other finds of Dorset material come from King William Land on the west, Devon Island and Ellesmereland on the north, Polar Eskimo country in northern Greenland and on the west coast of Greenland down to the Arctic Circle, and on the south from northwest Labrador, *4 Kroeber, 1939, p. 31, cf. pp. 28-31. 65 Iglulik (Rowley, 1940. Cf. also his map, Fig. 4), north ern Bafhnland (Mathiassen, 1927, I, pp. 206-212), south ern BafTinland and Hudson Bay islands (Jenness, 1925), Newfoundland (Wintemberg, 1939-1940). the Belcher Islands in southern Hudson Bay, the east Labrador coast, and the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence.56 Most of these sites were not pure Dorset: some were Thule with Dorset trade pieces; some were Dorset originally, but were occupied by later peoples; some, especially in Greenland and Labrador, were places where Dorset stone types lingered on. There are also differences between the various Dorset collections, due to differences in age, environment, season of occu pation (?), and contacts with the northeastern Indians and with the Thule Eskimo. We have as yet no clue to the origin of the Dorset cul ture. Some characteristic types, especially in art and in stone work, suggest links with Old Bering Sea I, but a greater number, extraor dinarily enough, point towards Kachemak Bay I and the North Pacific area in general. The latter traits, which not only link the Dorset with the North Pacific but distinguish it from the Canadian Thule culture, include: oval stone lamp, open socket harpoon head with medial spur, closed socket harpoon head with two lateral spurs (not as yet known from the Pacific Eskimo-Aleut), double foreshaft leister har poon (inferred for the Dorset), prominence of multipronged leister rather than bird dart with side prongs, detachable barbed heads with tang (loaned by the Dorset to the Thule cul ture ?), thin grooved or notched adz blade, composite comb (inferred for the Dorset), chipped triangular or leaf-shaped blade with side notches, chipped asymmetric knife blade with side notches, and certain simple design elements. A number of these traits also belong to prehistoric Ainu culture; a discussion of some will appear in Chapter IX. A few other Dorset elements are shared with both the Old Bering Sea and Pacific Eskimo cultures, and some with the Old Bering Sea alone. However, one has the feeling that much of the Dorset culture must have been derived in some way from the ancient North Pacific cultural continuum, even though it is impossible now to suggest how this happened. These various links suggest contemporaneity of Dorset, Old Bering Sea and Kachemak Bay 66 Cf. map in de Laguna, 1946. King William Land (Mathiassen, 1927, I, PI. 82, J, etc.), Greenland (Mathias sen, 1928; Holtved, 1939; Solberg, 1907; specimens in NMD), northwest Labrador (Leechman collections in NMC), east Labrador (Strong, 1930), Belcher Islands (Quimby, 1940; Jenness, 1941), Gulf of St. Lawrence (Win temberg collections in NMC).</page><page sequence="21">14 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 I. Collins suggests that the Dorset may even have been older in Canada than Old Bering Sea in Alaska, and Jenness would date the entry of the Dorset into Canada from the west in the closing centuries of the second millennium B.C.67 Some Dorset harpoon heads with side blades or with residual grooves reminiscent of such blades suggest indirect contacts with the Birnirk at Point Barrow, probably just prior to the devel opment of the Alaskan Thule culture. The more northern Dorset sites, in any case, seem to be older than those in Newfoundland, but I hesi tate to suggest any initial date. For a time, between a.d. 800 and 1000, the Thule and Dorset lived side by side, the Thule being more to the northwest, trading and per haps intermarrying. From the Thule, I believe the Dorset people took over the one-piece comb and slate ulo, but failed to adopt the bow drill, which was one of their most conspicuous lacks. To the Thule, in turn, I believe they gave the flat shape of the toggle harpoon head, the detachable barbed dart head with tang, the stone lamp for cooking and the suspended stone cooking pot (See Chapter IX). It is the Dorset culture already enriched by Thule loans which is found in Newfoundland, and I would there fore suggest that the Eskimo settlements there date from about a.d. 1000 (or perhaps 900 ?) to 1500, when the Eskimo were replaced by the Beothuk. Of course, there may have been an earlier "pure" Dorset colonization, but evidence of this has not been found. Farther north, the Dorset were eventually swamped by the Thule, whose culture gives the impression of greater vigor and efficiency, although Dorset influences are discernible in the blend we call modern Central Eskimo. Although the Dorset left Newfoundland to the Beothuk, the descendants of these Eskimo continued to frequent the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, where they were ob served by Champlain in the early seventeenth century. Subsequently they retreated north to Hamilton Inlet in southeastern Labrador. Dur ing the long period, a.d. 1000 to 1700 (?), the Dorset and their descendants were in contact not only with the Beothuk, but with early Woodland groups, or their predecessors, in the Maritimes and on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and later with the Laurentian Iroquois. By the time of Champlain's voyage, probably already by 1600, the Laurentian Iroquois had aban 67 Collins, 1940, Fig. 36; Jenness, 1940, p. 9. doned their territory, the people of Montreal eventually joining the Mohawk-Onondaga, and the Quebec group probably merging with the Hurons. "This interpretation would help ex plain certain alleged resemblances between the head form of the Huron and Eskimo on the grounds that the Canada [Quebec] band inter married with Eskimo during summer fishing excursions to the Gulf of St. Lawrence."58 NORTHEASTERN INDIAN ARCHAEOLOGY Although our primary interest is to define the background of Tena culture, we shall be forced to deal rather extensively with North eastern Indian archaeology, even though this may seem at first glance to have only very re mote connections with our problem. Tena pre history is closely linked with the prehistory of the Eskimo, and a full knowledge of the latter is impossible without an accurate appraisal of the Dorset culture. Information about the Dorset is still so unclear that we cannot afford to neglect any clue which might be furnished by studying the Indian neighbors of the Dorset Eskimo, since some of these Indian groups ap pear to have borrowed characteristic Dorset traits and to have given the Eskimo a few of their own in return. Furthermore, the Ice-hunting and Snowshoe stages, upon which Tena culture is based, can not be properly understood if Northeastern archaeology is ignored, and our obligation to investigate this field becomes clear when it is realized that the most important contributions to Northeastern Indian archaeology have ap peared only recently and were not available when Hatt, Hallowell and Birket-Smith made their basic studies of the Ice-hunting and Snow shoe stages. For these reasons, the following sketch of Northeastern Indian archaeology is offered, in order that my readers may be aware of the assumptions which I have made concerning the chronological and genetic relationships of the prehistoric cultures in this area. Because these relationships have been more clearly defined for New York State than for the other regions of the Northeast, we shall use Ritchie's classifica tion of prehistoric New York cultures as our basic framework, since, with some additions or extensions, it can be applied to the whole Northeast. Ritchie's scheme is an application of McKern's classificatory system to New York 68 Fenton, 1940, p. 176.</page><page sequence="22">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 15 archaeology. It is a type of classification which endeavors to exhibit the genetic relationships between cultures, after the fashion of a family tree, such relationships being determined by the presence of shared traits. I present here a modification of a table already published by Ritchie, with a few additions.59 The Iroquois aspect of the Upper Mississippi pattern is subdivided into foci corresponding to Northeastern Indian Prehistoric Cultures (based on Ritchie, 1944, PI. 1) Pattern Phase Aspect Focus Mississippi Upper Iroquois Iroquoian tribes as known historically -?- Hopewellian -?- New York IOwasco /Castle Creek \Canandaigua [Point Peninsula Vine Valley &lt; Middlesex Woodland J , K^UF'v , -?- [Late New York (Originally J Early New York classed as Coastal \A dd: New Jersey Northeastern) [Add: Northern -?- (Origi- -?- (Originally nally classed classed as -?- (Originally Orient as Woodland) Northeastern) classed as Coastal) (Vosberg -?- Brewerton (Originally classed as Lauren tian JVergennes Northeastern Woodland) \Add: Classic and shell heap Archaic &lt; Red Paint [Add: Tadoussac -?- (Add: Laurentian-Archaic) Frontenac -?- -?- Lamoka the Iroquoian tribes of Ontario, New York and Pennsylvania as known from historic times.

The New York Hopewellian, found in mounds in western New York, represents an intrusion from Ohio which merged with the Point Peninsula focus (or a related focus) of the Vine Valley aspect.62 The Owasco aspect of the Northeastern Woodland is found in central New York, and in the Champlain, Delaware and Susquehanna valleys. It is a development of the Vine Valley aspect, showing indirect Iroquois influence in the earlier Canandaigua focus, and strong direct 61 Wintemberg, 1931, pp. 66 f.

The Point Penin sula, of lower Ontario and northern, western, and central New York, is probably the latest focus, and is related to the Intrusive Mound culture of Ohio. It is known from village sites and graves, chiefly the latter.64 Early in its his tory, the Point Peninsula, or a closely related focus (?) was affected by the Hopewellian intrusion from Ohio. The earlier Middlesex focus of the upper St. Lawrence valley, Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont, and east-central and central New York, is known only from grave finds, and seems to be a diluted Northeastern grave cult, derived from the Adena culture of Ohio.65 I do not know to what focus we should assign the Vine Valley material (?) found over lying the Archaic strata at Lamoka.66 The Coastal aspect of the Northeastern67 Woodland corresponds to the Owasco and Vine Valley aspects in the interior. Ritchie groups with New York coastal sites others in New Jer sey and Pennsylvania. I suspect that the sites in the interior of New Jersey should be placed in separate foci.68 The Late New York Coastal focus is a development from the Early focus and shows Owasco influence.69 The Early New York Coastal focus corresponds roughly to the Vine Valley aspect in the interior.70 To these two foci listed by Ritchie I would add the Northern Coastal, represented by shell heaps ascribable to the Algonkians, in the Maritime Provinces and in New England, probably as far south as Connecticut. This may well have to be subdivided into earlier and later mani festations.71 83 Canandaigua (Ritchie, 1936a; 1928; Parker, 1922, pp. 340-343), Castle Creek (Ritchie, 1934; 1939a). 64 Nichols, 1928; Ritchie, 1937, pp. 188-193; 1938c, pp. 223-225. ?

The New York Coastal aspect in general is covered by Skinner, 1932, but without segregation of temporal periods. 71 Moorehead, 1922, Part IH; Smith and Wintemberg, I am not sure how interior New England sites of Post-Middlesex age should be classified. The Orient focus of Long Island and lower Connecticut is classed by Ritchie in the Coastal aspect.72 Since there are some features which suggest a relationship with the Tadoussac of Quebec and the Red Paint of Maine, I am not sure where it should be placed.73 The Laurentian aspect has been assigned to the Northeastern Woodland, but it is possible that it may be reclassified.74 I think we can add to it certain foci not originally included by Ritchie. Those specifically assigned by him to this aspect form an inland series, or the Lauren tian proper. These are the Vosberg, of the Mo hawk and Hudson valleys, the Brewerton, of central New York, and the Vergennes, of the Champlain valley.75 Inland Laurentian remains certainly occur in Ontario but I do not know whether they should be placed in a separate focus.76 To this inland series I would add a coastal series, consisting of at least two foci: the Red Paint, of Maine, known from classic sites (caches, or graves ?) and from shell heaps; and the Tadoussac culture of the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence.77 This may, however, be stretching the concept of "Lauren tian" rather far. What I have designated as the Laurentian Archaic aspect, known from Frontenac Island in Lake Cayuga, New York, is a blending of Brewerton Laurentian and Lamoka Archaic.78 The Archaic pattern seems to be represented by a single focus in New York, the Lamoka.79 1929; Willoughby, 1935, pp. 119-300 in large part; W.

This system of classification, which is like a family tree, does not take into account cross cultural influences, nor does it attempt to exhibit temporal relationships, except as it may be possible to list the earlier patterns, aspects, etc., below later ones without distorting the genetic scheme. I am indebted to Ritchie for a chart showing a tentative chronology of cul tures in which cross-cultural exchanges and influences are also indicated. I give it in the form of a table. Chronology or New York State Archaeology as Suggested by Ritchie Late Coastal: a.d. 1450?1600. Developed from Early Coastal under Iroquois and Owasco influences. Is the precursor to modern Algonkian. Castle Creek: a.d. 1450?1600. Developed from Canandaigua under Iroquois influence. Is the precursor to modern Algonkian? Iroquois: a.d. 1400?1600. Precursor to modern Iroquois. Canandaigua: a.d. 1200-1450. At first shows Point Peninsula influence. Is transformed into Castle Creek under Iroquois influence. Hopewellian: a.d. 1100-1250. Point Peninsula: a.d. 1050-1300. At first shows Middlesex influence. Hopewellian influence is apparent about a.d. 1200. Middlesex: a.d. 1000-1100. Orient: a.d. 900-1050. Exhibits Early Coastal influence (?). Early Coastal: a.d. 900-1450. Exhibits Laurentian (and Orient ?) influences prior to a.d. 1000. Is transformed into the Late Coastal. Frontenac: a.d. 750^1850. Is influenced by or formed by a fusion of Laurentian and Lamoka. Laurentian: a.d. 700-1050. Lamoka Archaic: a.d. 300 (?)-850. Because it is the Laurentian which exhibits the strongest evidence of Eskimo influence, and because the Eskimo traits in the Laurentian were presumably derived from the Newfound land Dorset after the latter had been subjected to indirect Thule contacts, I do not believe that we can date the beginning of the Lauren tian until after the appearance in Newfoundland of the Thule-influenced Dorset. I have already suggested a.d. 1000 as the approximate time for the beginning of this Dorset period. Of course, Dorset with Thule loans may have been in Newfoundland a century before, and Ed. Note.?Ritchie, 1944, now classifies the Lamoka focus, the Frontenac focus, and the three inland foci of the Laurentian aspect as manifestations of the Archaic pattern. The term "Archaic," as used here by de Laguna, applies only to Ritchie's Lamoka focus of the Archaic pattern. there may even have been a "pure" Dorset culture there at a still earlier period, but I do not think we can set the emergence of either the inland or coastal Laurentian prior to a.d. 1000. If this is correct, it means a revision of Ritchie's tentative chronology to shorten the sequence of events between the appearance of the Laurentian and the arrival of the Iroquois. I would therefore suggest the following se quence of cultures in the Northeast: Period I ?- a.d. 1000 This period of unknown duration is charac terized by the presence of the Archaic culture, the oldest found in the Northeast. The Lamoka focus seems to be a specifically northeastern manifestation of the Archaic horizon which formerly existed over the entire East.80 The lack of bannerstones suggests an absence of the weighted spear-thrower, an indication that this branch of the Archaic was rather poor in some respects. Since the Lamoka focus seems to have been centered in the Genesee and Finger Lakes area of New York, where all the excava tions were made, we do not know what other foci may have been present elsewhere, but we may assume that some form of Archaic under lay all of the known cultures in the Northeast.81 The Lamoka is a simple hunting and fishing culture, lacking pottery, steatite vessels, to bacco pipes, and evidence of agriculture. Its bearers were long-headed, high-vaulted Indians, rather like the Basketmakers. The end of this period is marked by the in troduction of traits from at least two, and pos sibly more, foreign sources. The cultural pro file published by Ford and Willey,82 seems to indicate the date a.d. 1000 as the end of the Archaic period in New York, and while I be lieve that it does date the end of Archaic dominance, there are certain finds which sug gest that the Lamoka Archaic culture lasted on into the next period, either in a pure form at a few sites, or as a mixture. Period II a.d. 1000-1200 This period is characterized by the emergence of the Laurentian proper in the interior and of Tadoussac and Red Paint on the coast. Some continuity between Lamoka Archaic and inland 80 Ford and Willey, 1941, pp. 332-334. 81 Cf. map, Ritchie, 1936&amp;, PL XIV. 82 Ford and Willey, 1941, Fig. 4.</page><page sequence="25">18 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 Laurentian can be seen?we might even call the latter a highly enriched Archaic?but it is less apparent that Red Paint and Tadoussac were built on an Archaic base similar to La moka. While the inland Laurentian was non agricultural like the Lamoka Archaic, it pos sesses better woodworking tools (gouge, celt for ax [?] thinner adz, greater variety of chipped knives and scrapers), better hunting equipment (weighted spear-thrower, detachable barbed bone dart head, fixed barbed bone point, ground slate weapon blades, a greater variety of chipped weapon points), in addition to other new elements such as the plummet, ground slate ulo, articles of native copper (from Brew erton only), and cord-marked pottery. Copper comes chiefly from the lower levels at Brewer ton, and pottery from the upper levels at the same site, although potsherds are found throughout the layers at Vergennes.83 Although the list of traits given above applies specifically to the inland Laurentian series, many of these types are duplicated at Tadoussac and at Red Paint sites, or appear in variant forms on the coast. In this complex we can distinguish ele ments of Eskimo origin;84 others, chiefly pottery and copper, are derived from higher cultures to the south and west. The site on Frontenac Island exhibits a mixed Laurentian and Lamoka Archaic cul ture, and indicates that the latter must have persisted fairly intact after the formation of the Laurentian, in order to produce this fusion. At least, this is the impression I received after seeing some of the material and discussing the matter with Ritchie. Of course, it is possible that we have here merely a stage transitional between the earlier Archaic and the fully de veloped Laurentian. The type site of Lamoka, however, also gives indication of a long survival of the Archaic, here in pure form. Towards the end of the period of occupation, the original inhabitants were conquered by round-headed Indians of more advanced culture, who made pottery and wore marine shell ornaments, and who may even have practiced agriculture. These new comers may have been the advance guard of the Vine Valley people (see Period III), but the material recovered is insufficient to define their culture. At Lamoka they tortured to death some of their captives, but the skeletal ma 83 Ritchie, 19406, pp. 49,88; Bailey, 1939, p. 20. 84 de Laguna, 1946. terial from other sites suggests that the long headed Archaic people and the round-headed invaders intermarried in some cases. When the skeletal material from the Brewerton Lauren tian and from Frontenac are published, we may find some evidence of the presence of this same round-headed type. I suspect that the upper layers at Lamoka antedate the oldest defined focus of the Vine Valley, otherwise we should have to postulate the survival of the Lamoka Archaic all through Period II. It would fit very prettily into this historical reconstruction if we could consider that the round-headed in vaders of Lamoka were a branch of the group responsible for the introduction of pottery to the Laurentian. A later and more extensive immigration of the same people would then explain the appearance of the Vine Valley and Coastal aspects. The Orient focus and the very beginning of the Early New York Coastal focus may fall in the last part of Period II. The chart of Ford and Willey, to which we have already referred, would also place the Adena of Ohio and the related Middlesex focus of the New York Vine Valley in this same period, a.d. 1000-1200. This is probably true for the Adena, of Ohio, but the Middlesex reflects only attenuated Adena traits, and is probably later. Period III a.d. 1200-1400 This period corresponds to the "Second Al gonkin period" as originally formulated by Parker and Ritchie.85 It is characterized by the Vine Valley aspect in the interior of New York, consisting of the Middlesex focus and the later Point Peninsula focus. The Ohio Hopewell was intruded into the early Point Peninsula in western NeW York (or into a closely related focus), while the later Point Peninsula shows evidence of contacts with the post-Hopewellian Intrusive Mound Culture of Ohio. The dating here suggested for the Vine Valley fits the chronological scheme of Ford and Willey, since they place the Ohio Hopewell just after a.d. 1200 and the Intrusive Mound culture just before a.d. 1400. On the coast during this period, we have the Early Coastal focus in New York; in Maine and Nova Scotia, etc., the Northern Coastal is represented by the bulk of the shell heaps. A culture comparable to the Early New York Coastal is found in New 85 Parker, 1922, pp. 48 f.; Ritchie, 19326.</page><page sequence="26">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 19 Jersey, and may be contemporaneous with it. In Ontario and Quebec there seems to have been a culture comparable to the Vine Valley? Wintemberg's pottery-making Algonkian and the remains of a "mound-builder occupation."86 The latter may be specifically related to either the Middlesex or to early Point Peninsula Hopewell. Period IV a.d. 1400-1600, When History Replaced Archaeology This period is marked by the invasion of the Iroquois. Their coming meant the displacement of earlier populations and may have resulted in pressure which forced the immigration of the Beothuk to Newfoundland and the retreat of the Eskimo from that island. It is possible also that this pressure was felt farther north, and may have had something to do with the emi gration of the interior Canadian Eskimo to the coast as a result of successive movements to the north of the Ojibwa, Cree, and Chippe wyan. The Vine Valley culture, which was probably carried by Algonkian-speaking In dians, was transformed into the Owasco. At first, in the Canandaigua focus, we observe an improvement in pottery but a deterioration in pecked and polished stone work (loss of the grooved ax and of the exuberantly ground slate bannerstones, amulets, etc.). This change may have been due to indirect Iroquois influence, for in the subsequent Castle Creek focus such influence is very clearly shown, for example, by Iroquois styles in pottery. The same sort of change transforms the Early New York Coastal into the Late Coastal focus, and direct or indirect Iroquois influence is probably to be found also in later stages of the Northern Coastal. On the other hand, the Iroquois them selves took over Woodland (Algonkian) traits. These are, according to Wintemberg:87 barbed bone and antler points, both fixed and detach able; bone fleshing tools; snowshoe netting needle; and pottery decoration made by cord wound sticks, notched rocking stamps, and awls (punch marks). Some Iroquois also picked up a few slate gorgets and articles of copper. The last two items are very rare or else lacking in New York sites, and may indicate either that the Vine Valley complex lasted longer in Ontario or that Iroquois culture developed " Wintemberg, 1931, p. 66; 1928. ?7 Wintemberg, 1935. earlier in Canada than in New York. Outside the area under direct consideration, we can rec ognize in this period the Fort Ancient culture of Ohio and Kentucky, which is a form of Upper Mississippi contemporaneous with and related to that exhibited by the Iroquois. In south western Pennsylvania, the Monongahela Wood land exhibits "... a specific Fort Ancient Iroquoian influence at the Montague site [in Somerset County], a general one in the western section of the Monongahela area."88 JAPANESE ARCHAEOLOGY Just as we shall have to wander rather far afield into northeastern Indian archaeology, seeking light on the eastern Eskimo and on the Ice-hunting and Snowshoe culture stages, so our research will carry us across the North Pacific to Asia. Tena culture is based in part upon the North Pacific cultural continuum, and has been strongly influenced by the later circum-Pacific culture drift. An understanding of either of these cultural manifestations de pends on knowledge of the archaeology of Kamchatka, Japan, and China. Kamchatka, which lies closest to the end of the Aleutian chain, could doubtless supply us with many important clues concerning the ex change of traits between the Asiatic and Alas kan inhabitants of the North Pacific area. Un fortunately, its soil has as yet been barely scratched, and the archaeological material available to us from Kamchatka seems to date from the eleventh to the eighteenth centuries, and to reveal little evidence of the cultural changes which probably occurred during this period.89 Kamchatka, however, has been under the influences of cultural complexes that traveled northward from Japan over the Kurile Islands. It is, in fact, this cultural drift, moving directly to the Aleutian Islands from the Kuriles, or indirectly to the Aleutians via Kamchatka, which played such a striking part in the devel opment of the cultures of the Pacific Eskimo and Northwest Coast Indians. Fortunately, we know a good deal about Japan, including the archaeology of the Ainu in the northern part of the Japanese Empire who were carriers of traits passed on to North America and recipi ents of others diffused from the New World. 88 Butler, 1939, p. 71. 89 Schnell, 1932, pp. 59-65; Jochelson, 1928; and other re ports listed in the Bibliography.</page><page sequence="27">20 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 In Japan, too, will be found traces of the early North Pacific cultural continuum. For these reasons it seems important to pre sent a brief summary of the prehistory of Japan. In this, I follow especially the dating suggested by Schnell, and also make extensive use of the material presented by Bishop, and by Nishioka and Schenck. I am also indebted to Dr. Lauriston Ward of the Peabody Museum at Harvard for suggestions.

Kanda has published a valuable album of stone artifacts, and some material on pottery types has been summarized by Liang. Other sources of lesser interest to the general reader can be found in the bibliography of this book and in the bibliography published by Schnell.90 Little is known about the prehistory of Japan before 200 B.C. In the succeeding periods we have to deal with two racially and culturally distinct populations. The dividing line between these peoples at 200 B.C. and for some little time thereafter seems to have been at Lake Biwa on the main island of Japan, Honshu (or Hondo). This body of water, together with the bays on the coasts opposite, almost cuts Honshu 90 Schnell, 1932, cf. chronology on p. 42; Bishop, 1925; Nishiokaand Schenck, 1937; Munro, 1911; Kanda, 1884; Liang, 1930. in two, making a larger northeastern part and a smaller southwestern section. Northeast of Lake Biwa lived the Ainu. These hairy people have been classed by Hooton as the purest survivors of the Archaic White Race, a race which has left its trace in India, the East Indies, Melanesia and Australia.91 It is believed that the ancestors of the Ainu must have come from the East Indies, spreading north via For mosa and the Ryukyu (Ryuku, Riu-Kiu, or Loochoo) Islands. Schnell mentions Ainu-like natives still living on these islands, and cites the cultural evidence collected by Sternberg as offering "... certain proofs . . . establishing the Ainu's connection with the peoples of the East Indian archipelago."92 Bishop believes that the Ainu came to Japan, thousands of years ago, probably in three waves.93 Ainu sites in Japan are characterized by the presence of cord- and textile-marked pottery, known as Jomon ware. No Jomon pottery has been found southwest of Lake Biwa, and no site in south ern Japan has ever been conclusively identified as Ainu. Southeast of Lake Biwa, but with some ex tensions to the east, are sites ascribed to the ancestors of the Japanese. These are also found on the island of Kyushu to the southwest. The present Japanese are certainly a mixed race. The predominating element is Mongoloid, 81 Hooton, 1938, pp. 507, 539 f., 559 f. 92 Schnell, 1932, pp. 21, 39; Sternberg, 1929. 98 Bishop, 1925, pp. 548-552.</page><page sequence="28">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 21 which can be ascribed either wholly or in large part to emigrations from the coast of northern China and from Korea. These migrations were responsible for introducing the traded bronze objects, pottery types, grain cultivation, etc., which characterize the earliest known Japanese, or rather proto-Japanese, culture in the south.94 The present Japanese also carry a strong ele ment of Ainu, most of which was probably ob tained in the eighth and ninth centuries, when the Japanese were overrunning Ainu territory with divide-and-conquer strategy, although some Ainu increments must have been incor porated earlier.95 Other racial elements, of un doubtedly far greater antiquity, should prob ably be recognized. Thus Schnell, in pointing out that an important part of Japanese vocabu lary shows affinities with Austronesian lan guages suggests: "It is possible, therefore, that the bulk of the Japanese, as well as the Ainu, come from the South by way of Formosa and the Riu-Kiu islands."96 However, the various theories about the origin of the Ainu and of the Japanese still need the confirmation of archaeology, and un fortunately we know little about the prehistory of Japan before 200 B.C. A number of sites of an earlier period, 400 to 200 B.C. (?), have been excavated in southern Honshu and Kyushu, and have yielded Neolithic remains. They do not show clearly recognizable connections with either the ancient Ainu or with the proto Japanese, although it has been argued that they exhibit stages of culture ancestral to the one, or to the other, or even to both. Since it is the various types of pottery from these sites which will be of interest to us, we may defer a discus sion of them until Chapter IX, pp. 241-242. These sites are: Ko, in Kawashi, and Tsukumo, in Bitchu Province, southwest Honshu; Ibu saki and Idzumi, in Satsuma Province, and Torodoki, in Hido Province, Kyushu. It is also possible that some of the finds in northern Honshu date from a period prior to 200 B.C. These, however, would be merely very early Ainu (yielding pre-Atsude pottery, see below), and would not in themselves offer a solution to the Ainu problem. The culture of the proto-Japanese, 200 B.C. to a.d. 200, is concentrated in southern Honshu and Kyushu. It is Eneolithic. The people were 94 Bishop, 1925, pp. 554-560; Schnell, 1932, p. 39. 9fi Bishop, 1925, p. 567. 9? Schnell, 1932, p. 40. agricultural, buried their dead in cist tombs, and for a time, in northern Kyushu, in double urns, in a manner also known from Korea.97 Okamoto in northern Kyushu, which Schnell de scribes as a type site, contains, in addition to chipped and polished stone implements, Chi nese bronze daggers and mirrors of Han dynastic age, Chinese glass beads, and slate ulo blades, all objects or types imported from Korea.98 The pottery, known as Yayoi, is a brownish red ware, often wheel-made, though the marks of turning were usually removed with small hard brushes, and it was sometimes decorated with incised lines. "Both in material and form it borrows so much from the Neolithic and 'Aeneolithic' culture of Korea that the connection is unmis takable."99 Bishop has pointed out that during this period there was a single culture area em bracing southern Korea, Quelpart Island, and southern Japan, and that it was related to the culture of coastal China which existed before the spread of Chinese culture proper.100 The Eneolithic or Yayoi period came to an end during the third century a.d., when iron and a new pottery type, the Iwaibe, were intro duced from Korea, producing the Iron Age or Yamato Period, of from, say, a.d. 200, or 250, to 700. The Iwaibe ware is gray, finely made, and shows clear turning marks. It was at first used as offerings in the stone tombs or long barrows in which the dead were buried, while the Yayoi-type pottery, now called the Eanibe, remained for ordinary domestic use. Eventually the Iwaibe supplanted the latter, even in the home. Bishop says that iron came to Japan as part of a complex, partly Chinese, partly cen tral Asiatic in origin, which included such traits as horse-archers using sounding arrows, sacred ness of piebald and albino horses, sword wor ship, burial of living retainers in the tumuli of kings and nobles, irrigated rice culture and the associated Korean bullock, and elements in the modern Japanese language. Writing was intro duced from China about a.d. 500, and Budd hism a little before a.d. 700.101 With the introduction of iron weapons and improved methods of fighting, the Japanese were able to conquer the Ainu. There had been, I should imagine, some shifting northward of 97 Schnell, 1932, p. 43 98 Op. cit.y p. 42. 99 Op. tit., p. 41, cf. also pp. 25,44, Fig. 7. 100 Bishop, 1925, p. 556. 101 Op. tit., pp. 557-561.</page><page sequence="29">22 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 the Ainu-Japanese frontier during the Yayoi period. By a.d. 800 the Ainu had been driven north of the 39th parallel of latitude on the west coast and the 37th parallel on the east coast. In spite of some temporary Ainu successes, they were virtually expelled from Honshu by a.d. 1000, although a few subjugated villages around Aomori Bay were still occupied by Ainu in the eighteenth century.102 With the possible exception of some very early, pre-Atsude finds, the prehistoric Ainu, or Jomon culture, falls into three divisions, each marked by a distinctive pottery type. While these divisions are in the main temporal, and succeeded one another, there is some evidence that the specific pottery types assigned by Schnell to these three periods had their centers in different sections of northern Honshu and may have overlapped in time. Thus we may have to amend Schnell's chronological scheme, given above, to recognize regional and temporal differences. A more accurate presentation might be something like the following: Northeast MountL Kwanto ...A.D. 700... Kamegaoka or ? Usude, and Mutsu Omori? ...a.d. 200... Ento-Doki or Atsude Morioso Ichi-ohji ...200 b.c... This can be reconciled with Schnell's sequence of Jomon pottery if we remember that the Kwanto area, just northeast of Lake Biwa and including the region around Tokyo, was un doubtedly conquered by the Japanese early in the period of their expansion, so that the Usude pottery in that area must have been extinct while the Mutsu pottery was still flourishing in the extreme northeast. From 200 B.C. to a.d. 200 (according to Schnell), corresponding to the pro to-Japanese Yayoi period, Ainu culture was distinguished by Atsude pottery. Like all Ainu Jomon ware, it is brownish-yellow or brownish-red, coarse, hand made, but is distinguished from other Jomon styles by the vessel shapes and ornamentation. The rims rise into ears and the upper part of the vessels are encrusted with applied ribbons of clay. In the next period, a.d. 200 to 500, Usude pottery was made. The rims are usually flat, but a spouted teapot appears. Schnell suggests that the earliest Ainu pottery in the Kuriles, 102 Op. tit., pp. 556-567. his textile-ornamented Type C, was derived from the Usude, but both Usude and Type C may have been parallel developments from the Atsude. The last period, a.d. 500 to 700, is char acterized by the Mutsu, which has vessels with a high stand, like the Yayoi and Iwaibe, and more ornate teapots. During this time, the Kurilian cord-ornamented Type B pottery may have been developing. After a.d. 700 the Ainu in northern Honshu seem to have imitated Iwaibe and Hanibe (Iron Age Yayoi-type) pot tery, and the influence of the latter was carried to the Kuriles where it is reflected in the Kurilian smooth-surfaced, incised Type A ware. The latter, I suspect, also shows influences from the Asiatic mainland. The history of culture on Hokkaido (Yezo) seems to have followed that of the Kuriles. Probably one should distinguish between a southern Kurilian-Hokkaido sub area and a northern Kurilian sub-area, for the latter seems to have had close cultural connec tions with southern Kamchatka. As has already been said, the Ainu culture in Honshu comes to an end about a.d. 1000. The Ainu are still to be found on Hokkaido, Sakhalin, and the Kurile Islands. Baba's ex cavations in the Kuriles were at Ainu sites, con taining iron objects and Copeland china im ported from England, probably belonging to the eighteenth century.103 Although there was no recognizable stratigraphy, these imported objects seem to have occurred only in the upper part of the midden. (I am indebted to Gordon Bowles for a translation of the Japanese.) Some of the native pottery belongs to SchnelPs Type A, other pieces seem to be very closely related, and there are also copies in clay of iron pots. According to Schnell, the Kurilians ceased to make pottery at the beginning of the nineteenth century.104 Unfortunately, it is impossible to estimate the age of the lower layers at Baba's sites. Influences from the mainland of Asia have been important in shaping the development of culture in Japan and the Kuriles. In the later chapters of this book, references will be made to types (analogous, related or ancestral to Tena forms) which occur in the Chinese Bronze and Neolithic ages, or in the Neolithic of Man churia and Mongolia.

One of the main purposes of the expedition was to study the Pleistocene and Recent geology of the region, with reference to the problem of early human migrations. Dr. Eardley, our geologist, natu rally assumed charge of this task. Considerable attention was also paid to more recent archaeo logical problems, especially to the relationship of the Indian culture to that of the Eskimo near the mouth of the Yukon. Preliminary reports have been published by the author, and Dr. Eardley has also published two geological pa pers.1 Although we visited a number of sites at which the bones of Pleistocene animals are exposed, we found no trace of contemporary man. From late Tertiary times to the present, the Yukon has experienced complicated cycles of deposition and erosion; in the valley, the land surface on which Pleistocene or early Recent man would have hunted and camped is now largely destroyed, and the present topography gives no clues to likely camping places. Human remains of this period will probably be found by chance, therefore, rather than as a result of systematic search. Our failure to find such re mains cannot be interpreted as evidence that Early Man did not live in the Yukon Valley or travel through it to reach the areas in the High Plains where his camping places and tools have been found. In connection with our reconnaissance, Dr. Eardley mapped for the first time the Khotol River and Kaiyuh Slough (Fig. 9). The only previous maps of this tributary system, aside from guesses, were two sketches drawn by Indians, one made for Jette, the other for our own use. TENA TERRITORY In preparing the following account of the physiography, climate and natural resources of Tena territory, I have drawn upon the Bulletins of the U. S. Geological Survey, written by 1 de Laguna, 1935; 1936a, b, c; Eardley, 1938a, b. Eakin, P. S. Smith, G. L. Harrington, and Mertie, and on Eardley's two studies, already cited, as well as on the Summary of Climatologi cal Data for Alaska of the U. S. Weather Bureau.2 It was written in consultation with Dr. Eardley. The region covered by our explorations em braces the Tanana River from Nenana to its junction with the Yukon, the Koyukuk River from the mouth of the Kateel to its junction with the Yukon, the. Khotol River and Kaiyuh Slough from the mouth of Yukon Willow Creek to the Yukon, a small section of the Innoko River in the vicinity of Hologochaket, and the Yukon Valley itself from Tanana down to Fox Creek some 14 miles below Holy Cross. This section of Alaska lies between north latitude 62? and 65? 30', and between west longitude 149? and 160? 20', within an area roughly 400 miles east and west and 250 miles north and south. Our explorations were confined to ter races and hills lying close to the banks of the rivers and streams, and since a distance of about 1600 miles by water was covered in eighty days, no claim for thoroughness can be made. Travel was in two 15-foot skiffs, equipped with out board motors (PI. I, 2). The return journey from Holy Cross to Fairbanks was made by plane. The Tanana at Nenana is only 350 feet above sea-level, the elevation at the confluence of the Yukon and Tanana, only 200 feet; in conse quence, the gradient of the stretch we traversed is slight. The current of the Tanana is about 6 miles an hour; that of the Yukon from Ram part to Anvik averages about 5 miles an hour; from Anvik to Holy Cross it drops to 2 or 3 miles an hour. At several places, especially where the stream sets against rocky bluffs, there are apt to be rapids, and on the Yukon between Koyukuk and Holy Cross unpleasant waves are raised by the rain-bringing south winds during the summer. In spite of these hazards, the Yukon and its tributaries form a highway for travel, and the Indians' canoes, now made of canvas, rather than birch bark (PI. IV, 6), are able to make fairly good time upstream by tak 2 P. S. Smith and Eakin, 1911; Eakin, 1916; G. L. Har rington, 1918; Mertie and Harrington, 1924. 24</page><page sequence="32">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 25 ing advantage of the slack water and back eddies along the banks. Canoes are excellently adapted for the network of small creeks, sloughs and lakes, especially in the Kaiyuh-Khotol and Shageluk-Innoko regions, and it is in these backwaters that most of the prehistoric settle ments were located, not along the Yukon itself. In winter, ice freezes more solidly on these small bodies of water than it does on the large rivers, where rapids make dangerous ice; for this rea son the former are better for sled travel. Before the advent of the airplane, overland trails were kept open between the various settlements along the main rivers, but they are now almost entirely abandoned. The natives still breed sled dogs, however, for short journeys to and from their winter trapping camps. While we know that the use of the sled dog cannot be very old among the Tena, their myths would suggest that the dog sled was used prior to contact with the white man. At Holy Cross, the mean annual rainfall is 19J inches; on the lower Tanana, it is about 12 inches. The wettest months are July and August; over half the year's precipitation oc curs during the summer. The ground is gen erally covered with snow from the middle of October until early in May. The lowest officially recorded temperature for this area is ?76? Fahrenheit at Tanana, while the highest is 99? at Fairbanks. The mean minimum temperature for the Tanana valley is ? 23?, the mean maxi mum 72?. Holy Cross, which lies so much closer to the sea, has a more equable climate, with an average of 93 days a year of sub-zero tempera ture, as compared with the average of 123 days at Fairbanks. However, even in the Tanana valley it is rare that sub-zero temperatures last for 30 consecutive days. The middle and lower Yukon opens for navi gation about May 12 or 25, the Tanana, at Nenana, about May 7, the upper Koyukuk, at Allakaket, about May 20. These rivers freeze over about October 20. When the dramatic spring break-up occurs, the ice is likely to jam, damming the river water so that flood levels of 10 to 30 feet above normal are not uncommon. During these floods, the Yukon water presses back up the sloughs, often for miles across the meander belt, sometimes cutting new channels and silting up others, so that when it subsides one may be surprised by the changed pattern of sloughs, lakes and little tributaries. The river waters also constantly undercut the banks, and sandbars in the river shift rapidly. This con stant remodeling of the topography of the meander belt is responsible for the destruction or concealment of many archaeological sites. A large number of villages noted by travelers in the 1880's can no longer be found. The soil is permanently frozen all along the valley we explored down to some point between Bonasila and Holy Cross. In midsummer, the top of this frozen soil may be from one to four feet below the surface, depending on the con figuration of the land and the direction of the exposure. The fill in the abandoned house pits which we explored was always frozen, and this prevented a thorough excavation unless we were able to stay long enough to allow it to thaw. At Old Fish Camp, on the Khotol, we at tempted to hasten thawing by building a fire on top of one of the burials in House 12, but this was a most unfortunate experiment. Not only did the area thaw very slightly, but the heat injured a part of the skeleton; this method is to be condemned. Three types of topography are encountered along the middle and lower Yukon. Bedrock hills form the sides of the valley which varies in width from 5 to about 50 miles; the meander belt is from 2 to about 35 miles wide. For most of its course, the Yukon hugs the hard rock along the north and west side of the valley, but at Ruby, where the valley is rather narrow, it runs against the hills on the south. Where the Yukon water breaks away to form the Kaiyuh Slough and the Thompson branch of the Shage luk Slough, it joins the Khotol and Innoko rivers to run close to the Kaiyuh Hills on the east side of the valley. The hills bordering the Yukon are low and rolling, with rather steep slopes near the valley bottom; their summits rarely reach an elevation of 2000 feet. Some of these hills, such as Bishop Rock which rises like an island from the valley floor, are only 100 feet high. Eardley reports that "the highest peaks close to the Yukon River at any point below Tanana are northwest of Blackburn Island. They have not been mapped but rise probably over 4000 feet above the river."3 Where spurs run out to the river, their bluffs, rising to 50 or 600 feet above the water, not only make convenient landmarks for the traveler, but also produce fine gravel beaches for camp ing (PI. I, 2). Lower land, on the southern or downstream side of such a spur, is apt to have been chosen by the natives for a village site. 1 Eardley, 1938a, p. 307.</page><page sequence="33">26 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 The graveyard will generally be found on the slope upstream from the village, where it com mands a view not only of the village but of the river. The rocks from many of these beaches and bluffs have been used for artifacts. Some of the adz blades, however, are made of basic intrusive rocks. Since Dr. Eardley did not observe such rocks in place, he suggests that they may have been imported. On both sides of the meander belt are high terraces of frozen Pleistocene silt, remains of the alluvial deposit, once perhaps 800 to 900 feet thick, which formerly covered the valley floor. A thin veneer of this silt covers the summits of the lower hills, although weathering and stream action have stripped it from their sides in most places. The top of this silt forms a table-land, almost as flat as the floor of the meander belt, but 200 to 300 feet above it. Except near the Yukon, where it is cut into V-shaped canyons by small tributary streams, the table-land is a poorly drained swamp. In some parts, sparse timber grows in scattered clumps or in lines along the banks of the streams (PL I, 3). The edges of the table-land have been carved into terraces of various heights by the shifting meanders of the Yukon. In some places, only the lowest and most recent of these terraces can be seen from the water; in other places the river flows against high palisades, cave-off cliffs and bluffs (PL I, 4). It is in the frozen sands and loams (silts) of this table-land, and especially in the frozen muck which accumulated in an cient stream beds on its top, that remains of mammoth, horse, and bison have been found. There is as yet no incontrovertible proof that man lived contemporaneously with these ani mals in the Yukon Valley, although most ar chaeologists are confident that he did. Unfor tunately, no specimens which were discovered in placer mines cut through the frozen muck and silt were found under conditions which could establish their antiquity without any question. While some of these specimens pub lished by Rainey4 bear suggestive resemblances to Folsom and Yuma types from the High Plains of Colorado and New Mexico, some of the specimens from the placer mines are of rather recent Eskimo origin. Sites of present and recent villages are never found on top of the silt table-land or on its highest treraces. They are restricted to the lower terraces of the ancient silt or to terraces 4 Rainey, 1939, Figs. 9 to 11. of more recent formation, between 10 and 30 feet above the river. The third type of topography includes these more recent terraces of silt and peat and the low lying alluvial deposits of the meander belt. The country is a veritable Paisley pattern of streams, sloughs, oxbow lakes, and swamps. It is heavily timbered, except where the land is but a re cently formed river bar on which only willows have as yet been able to gain a foothold. It is within this area that all the former and present village sites were found, and here the Indians still spend the greater part of their lives, fishing in summer and trapping in winter. The timber of the region grows on the slopes of the hills up to about 2000 feet above sea-level. Trees are not large, the majority failing to ex ceed 12 inches in diameter. The most common species are spruce and birch, with cottonwood and willows along the streams, and willows and alders above the timber line. The birch was formerly of great importance to the natives, since its bark was used for canoes, the roofs of winter houses and the covering of summer lodges and shelters, and for dishes and storage vessels. Edible berries on the hillsides are the blueberry, raspberry, high- and low-bush cran berries, and currants. Reindeer moss and other lichens on the tops of the hills made ideal pasturage for the once numerous herds of cari bou that retreated to the hills in summer to escape the voracious mosquitoes of the lowland. Other game includes moose, black and brown bear, fox, lynx, wolverine, wolf, muskrat, mar ten, rabbit, squirrel, weasel, beaver, rock and willow ptarmigan, grouse, swan, crane, loon, sea-gull, and various species of geese and ducks. In the streams are trout, grayling, whitefish, pike and pickerel. In summer, the dog and king salmon ascend the Yukon, generally reaching Tanana in the latter part of June. These are caught by the women in nets, and by the men in fish wheels (PL IV, 2), formerly in fish traps (PL IV, 4). Lamprey eels make a mass migra tion up the river in winter and are caught by the thousands through the ice with hooked sticks. The route which they follow each year is well known, but when a point a few miles above Anvik is reached, the eels mysteriously disap pear. Occasionally a stray beluga (white whale) or a few seals have been found as far up the Yukon as Nulato,5 but the visits of these sea 6 Dall, 1870, pp. 118 f., confirmed by our native inform ants.</page><page sequence="34">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 27 mammals are rare and the Indians of the lower Yukon have to rely upon trade with the Eskimo for sealskins and oil. TRIBAL DIVISIONS The area covered by our investigations is at present inhabited by Athabaskan-speaking In dians, who may be conveniently designated as the Tena, as Father Jules Jette has done.8 This name will serve to distinguish them from the Eskimo below them on the Yukon, and also from the other Athabaskan-speaking groups, Kutchin, Nabesna, and Tanaina, who are their neighbors. Actually the Tena comprise several divisions, the boundaries between which are not very clear. A consultation of published sources is not very helpful, for a majority of the names reported as tribal designations are simply varia tions, imperfectly rendered, of the several local expressions for "Up-river Indians," given by any group to describe their neighbors who live above them on the Yukon. Moreover, the loose social organization of the natives was never one which clearly differentiated them into tribes. In default of detailed ethnological information which might establish divisions based upon cultural differences, we have to rely mainly upon dialectic variations and upon the feelings of the natives themselves. Even these are not as well known as we could wish. I suggest, therefore, that we abandon the various names that have been given as tribal designations and start afresh, using unambiguous geographical descriptions. The following list, compiled after a study based on the material discussed in the next pages as well as on conversations with some of the natives, is, I believe, correct for the minor groupings of the Tena. I have not attempted to indicate the major divisions. 1. Lower Tanana. 2. Yukon from Rampart to just below the mouth of the Tanana. 3. Yukon from the Tanana to the Nowitna. (Possibly 2 and 3 form only one group.) 4. Yukon from the Nowitna to the Koyukuk. 5. Upper Koyukuk, above the mouth of the Allatna River. 6. Lower Koyukuk and the Yukon to just above Nulato. "Ten'a," cf. Jett6, 1908-1909. All other references to JettS's work apply to the unpublished manuscript of his Ethnological Dictionary of the Ten1 a Language, which Father MacElmeel of the Jesuit Mission at Nulato most generously gave me permission to consult and use in this present study. 7. Yukon from Nulato to Blackburn inclu sive, also including the Khotol-Kaiyuh drain age, and formerly the Ulukuk River. 8. Yukon from Blackburn to Holy Cross, in cluding the Innoko below the Thompson Shageluk Slough. 9. Upper Innoko (now extinct ?). The territories of groups 1 to 3 are found on Figure 2, those of groups 4 and 6 on Figure 3, of group 7 on Figures 7 and 9, and of group 8 on Figure 14. The territories of the other groups were not included in our reconnaissance and so are not indicated. I have no information, other than that cited below, as to what groups of Indians on the Kuskokwim should or should not be included with the Tena. The following discussion follows the group ings presented by Osgood.7 His major divisions are: Tanana, Koyukon and Ingalik. According to Osgood, the Tanana occupy "the drainage of the lower Tanana River below the Tok River, the region about the confluence of the Tanana and Yukon, and the region along the latter river above the confluence." He also includes the now extinct Tatsa of the Yukon and the people about Lake Minchumina. There seem to be several groups on the lower Tanana (information from the Nenana natives and the Eleventh Census),8 and we should probably distinguish these from the groups liv ing on the Yukon, since the dialect spoken at Nenana is different from that spoken at Tanana. Petroff and Dall both state that the Tanana River natives came down to the mouth of the river only for purposes of trade, though Porter, in the Eleventh Census, enumerates 300 Tanana Indians at Nuklukayet, the trading post near the mouth of the Tanana.9 The Koyukon inhabit "the drainage of the Yukon River south of the mouth of the Tanana to about latitude 63? north [Hall's Rapids], including the drainage of the Innoko River north of the latitude named, and of the Koyukuk River, in west central Alaska." The name Koyukon was originally applied by Dall to the inhabitants of the lower Koyukuk.10 Osgood, however, follows, in the main, Dall's subdivisions. The Yukonikhotana, a subdivision of the 7 Osgood, 1936, pp. 12 f., 14,19; cf. 1940, Appendix D. 8 Porter, 1893, p. 126. 9 Petroff, 1884, p. 161; Dall, 1877a, p. 29; Porter, 1893, p. 126. Porter reports a permanent population of 120 in 1890 (p. 165). 10 Dall, 1870, p. 53.</page><page sequence="35">28 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 Koyukon, are said to occupy "the drainage of the Yukon River south of the mouth of the Tanana to the mouth of the Koyukuk River." I am somewhat doubtful as to the accuracy of this grouping. It may be both too inclusive, and at the same time too restrictive. Thus the In dians at Tanana gave us the name yuk' anxot; ana for themselves, including all the Indians on the Yukon from the Koyukuk up to Stevens, above Rampart Rapids. This would indicate that Osgood may be wrong in classifying the Ta nana-Rampart group of Yukon Indians with the Tanana River people. However, we may well ask whether the names Yukonikhotana and yuk'anxot'ana mean anything more than "Yu kon People." I rather suspect that it is not a tribal designation at all. And on the other hand, we should probably subdivide the group living along the Yukon between the Tanana and the Koyukuk. Thus Dall places a dividing line at Sunka'kat, an unidentified stream, perhaps Main Creek, near Ruby, while Porter puts the boundary at the mouth of the Melozi, just across the river from Ruby.11 Natives at Ruby would include Kokrines, just above Ruby, in the lower group. Probably the mouth of the Nowitna might be safely taken as the dividing point. Dall calls the upper group Un'a-kho tana, but our native informants tell us that this is simply a corruption of yunaxotana, "Up river People." In his list of the Indian tribes of the Yukon Kuskokwim drainage, Zagoskin12 gives a sepa rate heading to the "Inkilik Unna-Hotena" who "occupied the side of the Una or Kvihpak [Yukon] from the mouth of the Unna-ka [Koyukuk] river and much further." (On the map the Yukon above the Innoko is called Yukxana, JOicxaHa, or Yuna, lOirBa; the Koyukuk as Yunaka, K)m,aKa). Zagoskin himself ascended the Yukon to the vicinity of the Nowitna mouth (?) where rapids forced him to turn back.13 Here 11 Dall, 1877a, p. 28; Porter, 1893, p. 119. 12 Zagoskin, (1935), p. 330. The translation of Zagoskin to which I have had access is an unsigned and undated manu script, being unfortunately a rather illegible carbon. The translator has had some difficulty in transliterating native names. For example, the Russian X is rendered by H (cf. Holmberg's transliteration of the same as CH), and I sus pect that the manuscript has some typographical errors. Zagoskin's original map is not included, but I am indebted to Mr. Charles Hubbel of Seattle for a photostat copy of this map from which I make my own transliterations. 13 In ascending the Yukon, Zagoskin mentions the follow ing rivers: Melekozitna [Melozi] on map as Molekozhitno, MoJieKOJKHTHo; the Minhotliatno [Big Creek?] which en he met several camps of Indians who had come down Big Creek (?) from the south. They had "small skin boats," probably made of caribou skins for the journey home after the hunt, and they spoke an unintelligible language. "Their clothes were very similar to those of the Tlegon hotana tribe [Upper Innoko, or Tlegon, TjieroHB, of the map, the eastern branch, with headwaters very close to those of the Innoko] but their lan guage was much different."14 I believe we can interpret this information as indicating a dis tinct break in the peoples of the Yukon, some where in the vicinity of the Nowitna mouth. It is interesting that Zagoskin's map gives the names Yukxana, K)KxaHa, and Yuna, K)Hi&gt;a, to the Yukon from the mouth of the Innoko to the mouth of the Koyukuk, and repeats the name Yuna alone for the Yukon above the mouth of the Koyukuk. It is possible $ of course, that Yuna does not mean simply "the river above us," but refers to some definite stretch of the Yukon, in which case it would be natural to refer to its inhabitants as "people who live on the Yuna." The use of distinct names for differ ent parts of the same river or stream is very common. Since, however, the Indians at Tanana called the Yukon yuqana, I think we can be quite sure that yunaxot'ana means only "the people who live on the river above us," and is consequently not a tribal designation. The op posite term, "Down-river People," is vuddxo t'ana. At Nenana on the Tanana the two words are rendered as nitzuxt'ana and D07tzoxtana. A comparable expression is the Koyukuk name for white people, yuna 17x0tana, "people from oyer there." Osgood's second subdivision of the Koyukon consists of the Koyukukhotana who occupy "the drainage of the Koyukuk River." According to the natives themselves, we should distinguish between the natives of the lower river, who occupy the territory from just above Nulato on the Yukon to the mouth of the ters the Yukon from the south 7 miles above the Melozi, where the hills on the south give way to tundra, on the map asMinxochlyachno, Mhhxo^ijihhho; and finally, also on the south side, the Noggay-ai Lagushia River [Nowitna], where he turned back, on map as Noggoiya, Horroftfl. On the map the names for the first two tributaries are transposed, but the manuscript makes perfectly clear from which bank they entered. Zagoskin's estimate of latitude is very faulty, but the longitude, 154?18' 45" West, would place him near the mouth of the Nowitna (pp. 174 ff.). 14 Op. tit., p. 174. Cf. p. 170 for mention of caribou skin boats made by the lower Koyukuk Indians after the hunt.</page><page sequence="36">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 29 Allatna River on the Koyukuk, and another group on the headwaters of the Koyukuk. These groups are differentiated on the basis of dialec tic differences. The Indians of the lower Koyukuk call themselves koyt'btsenxotana "people of the willow river country," and call the upper Koyukuk people tub7Xot'ana, "people who live at the head of the river." We were also given the following designations for the lower Koyukuk group which are more like demonstrative expressions than true names: yunak'axofana, 07ulbxnat'ana, yurykaxot'ana. Zagoskin also enumerates as a separate tribe the "Inkilik Unnaka-Hotena . . . living on the lower part of the Unna-ka [Koyukuk] river. The relatives of this tribe stay at Nulato." Half a day's walk above Hotilkakat [Kateel] is one lone barabara, and from here on the country is uninhabited until one reaches a region where many streams enter the Koyukuk, inhabited by the Tutlika-hotena or Tine-ka-hotena, the people of the upper Koyukuk.15 Osgood's third subdivision of the Koyukon is the Kaiyuhkhotana. Their territory is "the drainage of the Yukon River, south of the mouth of the Koyukuk River, to about latitude 63? north [Hall's Rapids], including the drain age of the Innoko River, north of the latitude named." While the territory is somewhat vaguely de fined, the validity of the designation is sup ported by Jette and Zagoskin. The former classes together all the natives from Nulato to Blackburn inclusive, and calls them the de scendants of the Kayar group who recently migrated to the Yukon from the Khotol River Kaiyuh Slough country. One branch of this group formerly lived on the Ulukuk River, an eastern tributary of the Unalaklik River, flow ing into Norton Sound. The population on the Ulukuk numbered about twenty-five in 1890. They were driven out by the Eskimo and crossed the divide to join their relatives on the Yukon.16 Zagoskin also speaks of the Bistroy (Black burn) River as marking the frontier between two distinct groups.17 He gives the name Inkilik without modification to the upper group, who live on the Yukon from Nulato to Tuttago in clusive. The latter (Tuttago, TyTTaro on the 16 Op. tit., pp. 330, 139 f. On the map, the Koyukuk is rendered as Yunaka, lOH-BaKa. A barabara is a semi-subter ranean winter house, see Chapter IV. 16 Dall, 1870, pp. 26 ff.; 1877a, p. 25; Handbook, II, p. 865. 17 Zagoskin, (1935), pp. 218, 330. map), was a village on the east bank, above Blackburn, and near Eagle Island. He recog nizes as subdivisions of the Inkilik, the Ulukag mut, who live on the Ulukuk River, and the Takaiksa, or Takaiksatz, or Takaiksantz. Of the latter, he writes: "All of the level land from parallel of the Nulato and down to Hogoltlinde village [one mile above Kaltag] is occupied by the Takaiksantz tribe, which are in affinity with the Ulukog-mut tribe. The word Takaiksa means swamp. The population of this tribe is a hundred people."18 These Takaiksantz are obviously the Kaiyuh-Khotol Indians.19 It is uncertain whether the people of the upper Innoko, above the Thompson-Shageluk Slough, ought to be included with the Kaiyuh group, since Zagoskin classes these Upper In noko as a separate tribe under the names Tlegon-Hotana, Innoka-Hotana, and Inkilik luat.20 They are now practically extinct. In his latest work, Osgood has also questioned this in clusion, but insists that the dividing line between the Kaiyuh group and the Ingalik who live below them on the Yukon should be at the mouth of the Thompson-Shageluk Slough, not at Blackburn River, citing Dr. Chapman and native informants as authorities.21 It is possible that there has been a recent shift in population, accounting for the difference of opinion. I have followed Jette and Zagoskin in placing this boundary at the mouth of Black burn River. Osgood's third large division of the Yukon Indians is the Ingalik. They occupy "the area between Anvik and Holy Cross on the lower Yukon River, including the drainage of the Anvik River, and the region southeast to the Kuskokwim River, including its drainage above Georgetown, west central Alaska." He subdi vides this group into: (a) the Anvik-Shageluk group, "centering around the villages of the same names"; (b) Bonasila group, "centering around the village of the same name"; (c) Holy Cross-Georgetown group, "centering around the villages of the same names"; (d) McGrath 18 Op. tit., p. 198. 19 Dall (1877a, pp. 25 f.) wants to apply the name Takai'yakho-tan'a to the people of the "Sh&amp;g'eluk River," which is, of course, quite unjustified. Since Dall's whole sys tem of terminology is hopelessly confused we need not pur sue the matter further. However, it is with some justice that he translates the name Kai'-yuh-kho-ta'na as "Lowland ers," even though he extends it to cover too wide a group. (For Jette's translation of Kayar [Kaiyuh] see page 57.) 20 Zagoskin, (1935), pp. 311 f., 331. 21 Osgood, 1940, p. 480.</page><page sequence="37">30 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 group, "the people of the upper Kuskokwim River." Again, I am not quite satisfied with the defini tion of this large division. In the first place, ac cording to Zagoskin and Jette the upstream boundary is the mouth of Blackburn River not the mouth of Anvik River or the mouth of the Thompson-Shageluk Slough. Secondly, the sub divisions of the people on the lower Yukon and the lower Innoko are much smaller than the comparable groupings for the people on the river above them. Lastly, I do not know to what extent the subdivisions of the Kuskokwim Indians should be included in the Yukon Innoko groups. Zagoskin applies the name Inkalit Ug-elnut to the Indians living on the Yukon between Blackburn River and Holy Cross, and includes the people of the Innoko River below Shageluk Thompson Slough.22 He enumerates the follow ing villages on the Yukon: Wagichagat or Vajichakat (Vazhichagat, BaacHHaraT-B, on the map), on the east bank of the Yukon just above the mouth of the Shageluk-Thompson Slough; Anvig, Ahbhfl; Makki, [Bonasila]; and Aniluh takpak (Aniluxtak-kak, AHHjryxTaKKaK'B on the map), at Ghost Creek, just above Holy Cross. The people of the first village complained of the attacks of the Takaiksantz from the Kaiyuh Khotol region.23 Of the last village, Zagoskin re marks that it is the lowest Indian settlement above Eskimo territory.24 On the Innoko, Zagos kin mentions Huligachagat, [Hologochaket], (or the Xuligichagat, XyjinrHHaraT-B, of his map) as the uppermost village of this tribe. Above them, on the upper Innoko, lives a separate tribe, the Tlegon-hotena or the Inkilih-luat.25 Zagoskin also tells us that the Indians of the lower Kus kokwin should be grouped with those of the lower Yukon and lower Innoko. "A part of this tribe [Inkalit Ug-elnut] was moved to the Kus kokwim into Kwigim-Panayg-mut village and spread to the upper waters of this river to the place where the Holitno flows into the Kuskok wim." These people are known to the Kuskok wim Eskimo as the Tutna, meaning "main land."26 The mouth of the Holitno is roughly in west longitude 157?, and this supports Os good's inclusion of the Kuskokwim Indians at 22 Zagoskin (1935), p. 331. 23 Op. tit., p. 220. 24 Op. tit., p. 226. 25 Op. tit., p. 310. 26 Op. tit., p. 331. Georgetown with the lower Yukon division. On the other hand, Zagoskin denotes as a separate tribe the Indians of the upper Kuskokwim, Os good's McGrath group, and designates them by the name Goltzan-Inkalih-lut. He also tells us that his Tanaina interpreter from Kenai on Cook Inlet could converse with all the Kuskok wim Indians and also with the lower Yukon and lower Innoko groups.27 Just how significant this last statement may be, is another matter. Os good has also called attention to the linguistic equivalence of Tanaina and "Ingalik."28 The important feature to be noted about Os good's groupings in general is that he marks a very sharp break near Hall's Rapids, and evi dently considers the people on the Yukon above this point to be much more closely related to the Indians of the Koyukuk and middle Yukon than they are to the Indians on the Yukon be low. Zagoskin on the other hand gives equal weight to all the "tribal" divisions, while Dall lumps together as one group all the Indians on the lower Yukon up to and including Nulato, together with those on the Innoko and the Kuskokwim.29 As we shall see later on, Zagoskin also makes certain observations which would indicate that to some extent one can class to gether the Indians on the Yukon below Nulato in contradistinction to other groups. It may be of interest to enumerate again Zagoskin's tribal divisions:30 (1) Tutlika-hotena or Tine-ka-hotena. Upper Koyukuk above Ka teel; (2) Inkilik Unnaka-Hotena. Lower Koyu kuk; (3) Inkilik Unna-Hotena. Yukon above the Koyukuk; (4) Inkilik. Yukon from Nulato to Blackburn, including the Khotol and Ulukuk Rivers; (5) Inkalik Ug-elnut. Yukon from Blackburn to Holy Cross, the lower Innoko be low Shageluk-Thompson Slough, and the lower Kuskokwim below the "Holitno River" and above the Eskimo at the delta; (6) Innoka Hotana or Inkalik-luat, or Tlegon-Hotana. Upper Innoko above Shageluk-Thompson Slough; (7) Ttinaytz or Kiney. Upper Stony or "Mantastano or Thaluk" River, an eastern tributary of the Kuskokwim above the "Ho litno" (same language as on Cook Inlet); (8) Goltzan-Inkalih-lut. Upper Kuskokwim above the "Holitno." 27 Op. tit., pp. 331 f. 28 Osgood, 1936, p. 22. 29 Dall, 1877a, pp. 25 f. under the name Kai'-yuh-kho ta'na. 80 Zagoskin (1935), pp. 330 f.</page><page sequence="38">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 31 Dall, however, writes: "Holmberg, in his summary, was misled by the untruthful and imaginative Zagoskin, many of whose fables were exposed by the parties of the International Telegraph Expedition when exploring in this region. Hence, his undue multiplication of tribes, intended to enhance the discoveries which he made principally, not by traveling, but by questioning the natives."31 This is a most unwarranted attack, all the more striking since Dall, who traveled far less extensively than did Zagoskin, produces only dogmatic as sertions to refute him. Dall's own efforts to reduce the "undue multiplication of tribes" are filled with confusion and inaccuracies. Wher ever it has been possible to check Zagoskin, either through my own fieldwork or through that of recognized authorities, the correctness of Zagoskin's observations has been vindicated. It is perfectly true that his choice of tribal des ignations is unfortunate, and he may well have made more divisions than careful ethnographic and linguistic research would warrant or find profitable, but that these divisions do have some validity I have no doubt. That the prob lem is one of great difficulty is sufficiently ex hibited by the lack of agreement among those who have attempted to solve it, and by the con fusion and inconsistencies to be found in the Handbook of American Indians. The eight regional headings under which I shall describe the archaeological sites (Chapter III) follow the tribal or sub-tribal groups as I have indicated them here. These regional divi sions have been adopted primarily for practical convenience, and should not be taken as an attempt to propose a final solution to the prob lem of tribal distribution in the area, the more so since the archaeological material is too scanty to suggest prehistoric culture areas. INTERTRIBAL CONTACTS Since archaeological, ethnological and histori cal data indicate considerable mingling of Es kimo and Indian cultures, as well as trade be tween the Indians, it may be well to summarize what we know about the contacts between the various groups on the Yukon and in the vicini ty, as reported by various observers. For the Indians of the Koyukuk and of the lower Yukon, trade with the Eskimo was easy. Besides descending the Yukon to the Eskimo 31 Dall, 1877a, p. 22. village of Paimute, below Holy Cross, the In dians had only to cross a few low passes, easily negotiated in winter with dog team, to meet the Eskimo of Norton Sound, only 40 to 75 miles away in a direct line. One such pass leads from the Kateel, a tributary of the Koyukuk, to the Ungalik and Inglutalik rivers that flow into Norton Sound. Communication was so easy that the Indians at Kateel finally had to build a fort to protect themselves from Eskimo raids. Dall mentions that the Koyukuk natives were obtaining liquor from traders in Kotzebue Sound via this route.32 Other passes into Nor ton Sound lead from the Gisasa, another tribu tary of the Koyukuk, and from the Nulato River to the Shaktolik, and from the Kaltag to the Unalaklik. The presence of a subgroup of the Nulato-Blackburn division on the Ulukuk River, a tributary of the Unalaklik, shows the close contacts maintained across the last men tioned pass. Dall himself traveled from Unalak lik to Kaltag by this trail.33 There was also a pass into Norton Sound from the headwaters of the Anvik River. To the east, there are easy portages between the lower Yukon and the lower Kuskokwim; in fact, in seasons of high water, river steamers of shallow draft can travel from one river to the other. Travel back and forth between these two rivers must have been very common, to judge from the reports of the early Russian explorers.34 From the Kuskok wim Valley there was an easy portage into the Cook Inlet country, but Glazanof, who at tempted to make the trip in 1832, failed to secure guides because the Kuskokwim natives were afraid of the Indians who lived in the intervening mountains since the latter had killed a number of parties of their fellow tribes men.35 The bulk of Tena contact with the Eskimo seems to have been along the Yukon, for the lower groups of Indians are more mixed with Eskimo blood than those who live above them, and they have also adopted more of Eskimo culture. Zagoskin reports many instances of trade be tween the various Indian groups and between the former and the Eskimo. This information may be summarized under four heads. 1. The Koyukuk Indians traded at Nulato, 32 Dall, i870, p. 53. 33 Op. tit., pp. 31-41. 34 Bancroft, 1890, pp. 547, 550, note 31, 551. 36 Op. tit., p. 552.</page><page sequence="39">32 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 and also ascended the Yukon as far up as the vicinity of the Nowitna for purposes of trade. They annually received Eskimo visitors from the coast; at Kateel, for the benefit of their guests, they constructed a kashim?the Alas kan Eskimo ceremonial hall, men's club house and workshop, corresponding to the kiva of the Pueblo Indians (see Chapter IV). They traded sable, wolverine, land-otter, beaver and fox furs, receiving from the Eskimos, in exchange, sea lion and whale oil, sea lion leather and boot soles, fancy parkas, tobacco, and spears with copper blades that had been made at Irkutsk. The Eskimo on one occasion wanted them to join in burning the Russian post at Nulato. Zagoskin makes no comment on this proposal of the Eskimo, but it seems likely that the Eskimo were motivated by a desire to re tain in their own hands the advantages of trade with the Indians. It is impossible to say whether the suggestion actually had anything to do with the subsequent Nulato massacre (see page 52). The Indians of the upper Koyukuk traded at Kateel, at the mouth of the Koyukuk, and also with the Eskimo of Norton Sound. Red paint from Hall's Rapids on the lower Yukon traveled to the lower Koyukuk and from there was passed on up the Yukon. At Nulato, one small ball of such paint was worth a beaver.36 2. Natives from the Tlegon (upper Innoko) whom Zagoskin met on the Yukon near No witna would presumably trade with the local natives. They also exchanged goods with the Indians on the Yukon below Blackburn, and Zagoskin also mentions a trail from the upper Innoko to the upper Kuskokwim.37 3. The Ulukuk River branch of the Nulato Kaltag group were great traders, acting as middlemen for the Eskimo of Norton Sound and their own relatives on the Yukon. They attempted to discourage Russian trade because they wanted to keep this barter for their own benefit. They had borrowed "customs and habits of living" from their Eskimo neighbors. The Indians of the Kaiyuh-Khotol region were also great traders with the Eskimo and with other Indians. Nulato was chosen by Malakof in 1838 as the site for the Russian trading post because it was already a gathering place for the natives who came there in numbers to dry fish and exchange furs. Zagoskin met seventy Indians from the Kaiyuh-Khotol region trading 36 Zagoskin (1935), pp. 117, 138 f., 158, 222. 37 Op. tit., pp. 169, 234, 317. there. We have also mentioned trade between Nulato and the lower Koyukuk.38 4. The people from Hall's Rapids, or vi cinity, used to go to the coast via the Anvik River pass, and some of them spoke Eskimo. The Blackburn-Holy Cross Indians traded with the lower Koyukuk and the upper and lower Innoko Indians, passing on their furs, etc., to the Eskimo of the lower Yukon and the coast, and to the Russian post at St. Michael. They traded dried and frozen salmon and other things with the Indians and the Russians on the middle Kuskokwim (Kolmakof Redoubt). "Very frequent visitings of the natives from Ittege [lower Innoko] with the tribes in the Anvig and Aniluhtakpak [vicinity of Holy Cross] villages made during the winter a very smooth road." The Indians from Shageluk on the lower Innoko also went via the Anvik pass to trade with the Eskimo on the coast.39 Zagoskin also makes a few comments on the effect of this intercourse upon the Indians. Of little value, perhaps, is his guess that an Indian from Cook Inlet could talk to all the Indians on the Kuskokwim and to the Anvik and lower Innoko people, while he would find the speech of the other Yukon groups unintelligible. How ever, the following statements are of more in terest. The Indians of the Yukon up to Nulato "copied their clothing from the seashore people [Eskimo] and do not wear beads, but anyway they keep up a big trade selling beads to the interior tribes."40 The lower Yukon Indians (group or groups not specified) acquired to bacco and other imported luxuries "first from the northern Chookchie, then from our south ern settlements on the Bering Sea Coast." As a result their material culture had changed rapidly in the last 10 years (1833-1843) .41 "The Inkilik [Blackburn-Nulato] and Inkalit Ugelnut [Holy Cross-Blackburn] tribes, dur ing the trading time with other tribes [Eskimo] borrowed their habits, costumes and religious holidays." He mentions in this connection the labret, tonsure, sweat-bathing in the kashim, Eskimo dances, and the eating of sea mammal oil as features which distinguish these groups from the rest.42 However, as noted above, the lower Koyukuk Indians used whale and sea lion 38 Op. tit., pp. 105 f., 127, 190, 198. 39 Op. tit., pp. 220 f., 234, 309, 321. 40 Op. tit., p. 112. 41 Op. tit., p. 233.

Zagoskin's references are not as specific as we could wish. The Indians and Eskimo seem to have entertained each other at potlatches, and on several occasions Zagoskin mentions Eskimo dances performed along with Indian dances at Indian festivals in the kashim. And on the other hand, he noticed that the Eskimo of Paimute, on the Yukon a short distance be low Holy Cross, while retaining their own tunes and dances, had adopted the quicker Indian tempo.43 Whymper, also, has a good deal to say about trading. Intertribal commerce goes on to such an extent that clothing worn hundreds of miles up the Yukon, and in other parts of the interior of Russian America, is of Tchuktchis origin, and is made up by the women of the coast tribes, who sew better than those of the interior. [Johnny Dayton's wife, lower Koyukuk, told us that she had learned to sew by copying the Eskimo because the Eskimo women do the best work. On the other hand, women at Nulato told us that the sealskin boots bought from the Eskimo were inferior to those they made themselves after the Eskimo pattern. I suspect that the Eskimo had been "dumping" inferior work, made expressly for trade.] This trade is principally for tame reindeer skins, of which the Tchuktchis have an overplus, and in exchange they receive bone, oil, and the furs of smaller animals. By constant inquiry, I found that marten (American or Hudson Bay sable of commerce), beaver, and fox skins, taken high up the Yukon, traded to the Co-Yukons [Indians of the Yukon from the Koyukuk to the Tanana, including the lower Koyukuk?] from them to the coast natives, and again from them to the Tchuktchis, eventually reach Russian traders on the Anadyr River, Eastern Siberia, or the American whaling vessels on the coast. . . . Guns obtained as far off as the Hudson's Bay Company's fort at the junction of the Porcupine, find their way to the coast by intertribal barter.44 Of the trade routes, Whymper mentions the overland trail from St. Michael in Norton Sound to the Yukon, 230 miles long, the trail from Unalaklit to the Yukon, 170 miles long, and a route from the Tanana to Fort Yukon in Kutchin territory. The trading centers he men tions are Ulukuk on the Ulukuk River, "Newi cargut" at the mouth of the Nowitna, "Nuclu kayette" on the point between the Yukon and the Tanana, and Fort Yukon.45 In 1867 there does not seem to have been much active trade with the whites on the lower Yukon, for Whymper says of Anvik, "... the natives there, and generally on the lower river, were of miserable appearance and badly clothed; they see less of traders than even the 43 Op. tit., pp. 252, 297, 305, 333. 44 Whymper, 1869, pp. 162 f. 46 Op. tit., pp. 171, 180, 229, 239, 255. upper Indians."4* Dall writes that at the time of his visit with Whymper "... the Mahle muts [Eskimo] had purchased most of the furs. Well armed, bold, and numerous, the latter completely overawed the degraded, fish-eating Indians, and forced them to sell whatever they had, at the purchaser's price."47 Probably by that time the territory around Anvik had al ready been almost stripped of fur. The Anvik natives wore labrets like the Eskimo and spoke a jargon when trading with them. The Eskimo used to ascend the river to exchange skin clothing, needles, tobacco, ammunition and their old guns for Indian furs and wooden dishes. The latter seems to have been a stand ard article of commerce with the Eskimo be cause of the lack of fresh wood in their terri tory. The Anvik Indians used to descend the Yukon in the fall to exchange their birch bark canoes for oil, ivory, boot soles, etc.48 Petroff also notes that the Yukon Indians as far up as Nulato had adopted from the Eskimo per manent villages, dog teams, traded kayaks, and "frequent celebrations of festivals and the rites of shamanism."49 In 1890, much the same type of trade was still carried on by the lower Yukon Indians, for Porter explains that they obtained oil and dried fish from the Eskimo in exchange for furs and birch bark canoes. These Indian canoes were used by the Eskimo for visiting fish traps, and were also taken by Eskimo women and children when they went to gather berries or fuel. There was consider able intermarriage between the two peoples on the Yukon.50 All of this evidence testifies to the intimacy of the lower Yukon Indians and Eskimo. NOTES ON THE ANNUAL ECONOMIC CYCLE OF THE KOYUKUK The following notes were recorded by Nor man Reynolds from information given chiefly by Johnny Dayton of Koyukuk. Beginning of May. The people moved to spring camps. Some used the summer birch bark lodge, but most had conical tents of de haired caribou or moose skin. The latter were about 15 feet in diameter, with smokehole and fireplace in the middle, and a skin door.

Geese and ducks were just arriving and these were hunted with bow and arrow. They were also caught with rectangular nets of willow bark which were suspended from two trees across a narrow slough. People stood at each end of the net with disk-shaped pieces of bark in their hands. When a flock of waterfowl flew by, the men would sail the disks above the birds. The birds would mistake these for hawks and dive into the net. During this time greyling, white fish, pike, lush, and suckers were caught in rectangular nets of willow bark, 20 or 25 feet long and 8 feet wide, equipped with floats and sinkers. These were set across narrow sloughs under the ice, and were also used in open water after the break-up and throughout the summer. During the break-up, dip nets were used from the shore where eddies set in close to the bank. The nets were held in the water with the mouth towards the current and were pulled in when they were shaken by the fish. As soon as the ice went (about the middle of May), muskrats were hunted by parties of 3 or 4 men in single canoes. They went out at night with bow and arrows and spears, calling the muskrats with a kissing noise. Early June. People moved to the summer fishing places. Those of the Koyukuk from the settlement called "Central place for ducks that can't fly in summer" and below, went to the Yukon, while those above remained on the Koyukuk. Since no king salmon and few sil vers run up the Koyukuk, we may assume that the natives remaining there had to depend on hunting to a large extent. About the first of July, the king salmon appeared in the Yukon and the run lasted for about three weeks. Dog salmon came after the kings stopped, about the middle of July, and overlapped the run of silvers. The silvers appeared about the first of August, and, like the dog salmon, seem to have run for about 20 days. Salmon were caught in the large conical basket traps of spruce splints, made and tended by the men, and also in the rectangular nets, described above, that were made and tended by the women. Most of the fish caught were dried for the winter. Bears, small animals, and ducks were shot with bow and arrow during the summer. Ducks were hunted particularly from the middle of July to the middle of August, when they moult and cannot fly. Beaver were shot from the canoe or from shore when they were feeding along the banks. The summer house was a small dome-shaped lodge of birch bark with a tight bark door, sewn on to keep out the mosquitoes. The lodge was only for sleeping; cooking was done over an open fire outdoors. Before the people went to bed at night smudges were built to drive out the mosquitoes in the lodge. Middle September. At this time the families moved to their fall camping places. The houses were the same size and shape as their winter houses, but were entirely above ground. The informant was not sure about the construction but thought that there was a framework of poles, covered with moss, logs, and then dirt. The roof was curved (made of bent poles?) and had a smokehole in the middle. At night the hot coals were removed from the central fireplace and the smokehole was shut with a cover of whale gut. A similar type of fall house seems to have been built in the Anvik-Shageluk region, and we may assume it to have been a common Tena trait. This type of house was also mentioned by an informant from Shageluk, but was not described by Osgood, unless it was one of his summer houses. Soon after the families were established in the fall houses, the men left on their annual caribou hunt in the hills. They went to the Cari bou Hills at the headwaters of the tributary streams, where they killed the game with snares, pitfalls, and arrows. They also shot any other game they encountered, especially bear and moose. Most of the meat was covered with skins and cached on tree platforms. The trees were blazed (cut with an ax) for identification. No shelters of any kind were taken along, but if hunters were overtaken by bad weather they would build a temporary lean-to of brush. They returned home in early November. Meanwhile the women gathered cranberries, blueberries, mossberries, blackberries, etc., and snared rabbits, spruce chickens, ptarmigan, and willow grouse. The berries were put in birch bark baskets and stored in underground caches. Middle November. Now the families moved into their semisubterranean winter houses. Soon after they were established, parties went into the hills to bring back the meat that had been cached. The entire family often went to gether, living in their caribou-skin spring tents, and dragging back on hand sleds the cached</page><page sequence="42">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 35 meat, or any other game they might be able to get on the way. Toboggans were used in soft snow and to carry the children. Throughout the winter, fur-bearing animals were trapped with set bows, deadfalls, snares and box traps. Caribou and moose were hunted on snowshoes. Probably fish were also caught in winter, but we do not know whether the conical fish traps were set under the ice, as they were on the lower Yukon. Women tanned caribou and moose skins during February and March.</page><page sequence="43">??^jr?- ^U|J *I '^"i. ?** ?*** m/ i*p 1**0# % Y*** ^" ' wmV?"r37.^''' ,*?''' ^ ,*'*'' RAY MOUNTAINS 'f W ^ * ^* -^^^.^ -Ww Jr &lt;*-~- ^Wiinj^g-Z-_S' - a/_/* / ^ ^ L?au*m? ** ..--mot spn.Nos ?.^^y^-?

The territories of group 5 on the upper Koyukuk and of group 9 on the upper Innoko were not included in our survey. There is, however, an eighth archaeological region, the Yukon near Holy Cross, which yielded specimens of a more pronounced Es kimo character than anything found in the areas above. These sites are, therefore, tenta tively listed as "Eskimo." In the following sections of this chapter there will be a discussion of all former village sites in the regions covered by our survey, including sites mentioned in the early literature or re ported to us. For the convenience of the reader I present below a list of the sites from which specimens were obtained, grouped according to the region in which they are located; their probable age is indicated. The presence of stone adzes and the absence of trade goods of white manufacture are taken as indications that the site was prehistoric, although in most cases, especially where we did little excavating, such an assumption is based on rather inadequate information. Since Russian exploring and trad ing expeditions did not penetrate Indian ter ritory on the Kuskokwim and Yukon rivers until the early nineteenth century?Kolmakof 1820, Glazanof 1833-34, Malakof 1839, and Zagoskin 1842-44?the expression "pre historic" does not necessarily imply an age greater than one hundred years.1 The most im portant sites are printed in italics and references to the pages where they are described are add ed. Where only a few house pits in a large vil lage were explored, the judgment is based only on those house pits, since this list is intended as a guide primarily to the sites as represented by the collections, not as a guide to the sites per se. 1.

In addition to the page references given above, see also Figures 12 and 13, and Plates VI, 3 and VII, 1, 2. Kateel on the Koyukuk (see Figs. 4, 5, 6) was the most interesting of the historic settlements, and Old Bonasila (Fig. 18, PL IX, 1, 2) presented the most diffi cult problems in dating. The general reader may find it profitable to read the description of these three sites. The first sections of Chapters IV and V summarize the information about burials and house types which is scattered through the later sections of this chapter, and also include data on modern Tena graves and buildings. NOTES ON THE LOWER TANANA VALLEY (FIGURE 2) Red paintings on the rocks were reported at two localities. The first of these is on an over hanging cliff, about 10J miles east of Fairbanks (20 miles by river), at the confluence of the Little Chena and the Chena rivers. The locality is called vata/yelene' "rock" and is supposed to be the place where Raven made the first women by transforming men. There is a low row of human figures in silhouette, about 12 inches high. The pictures are supposed to be come redder during some years than they are at other times. We had no opportunity of visit ing the site. The second spot is at Mile 35 on the Alaska Railway (measuring south from Nenana). The pictures were destroyed by river ice. We visited the site on the grounds of the University of Alaska, where stone artifacts have been found.2 The place is on a bedrock hill at the edge of the Tanana Valley, about 3 miles west of Fairbanks. The hill is covered with a thin silt veneer, the upper 18 inches of which contain particles of charcoal and stone artifacts. These comprise chipped arrow or small weapon blades with tang, but without pronounced shoulders or barbs; end scrapers; retouched flakes that may have served as knives or scrapers; ulo-shaped scrapers; and small slender flakes, struck from prepared cores. Whereas this material does bear striking re semblances to Nelson's Epipaleolithic ma terial from Mongolia, it also resembles much more recent stone working from Kamchatka; many of the types can be duplicated in our collections from comparatively recent Indian sites down the Yukon. There is, unfortunately, no topographic or geologic clue to date the 2 N. C. Nelson, 1937; Rainey, 1939. Fairbanks site. Until recently, the caribou used to migrate close under the hill, and the spot may well have been a camping place of the Tanana Indians. The only other site on the Tanana which we visited was at Mr. A. P. Stults' place, on the north bank of the river, 1| miles below the mouth of Hot Springs Slough (PL V, 1). Mr. Stults reports finding arrowheads and blades for knives and scrapers made of obsidian. He had not kept any of these, but furnished us with a sketch of the type of arrowhead, drawn from memory. The tang is slightly enlarged at the butt, while the blade lacks barbs or pronounced shoulders. A lump of chipped stone which he showed us was certainly obsidian. These objects were found on the slope down stream from the creek at his fox farm. The soil here showed traces of charcoal to a depth of 3 feet, but we found no other sign of human occupancy. One year the ice in the mouth of the creek gouged out a hole in which he found a human skull. The obsidian may have been obtained "from the Yukon above Tanana, or from the headwaters of the Tozi River, where it is reported by Mr. Henry Luttman, of Tanana. Rainey excavated a site known as Dixthada on Mansfield Creek, near Tanana Crossing on the upper Tanana, and reports a "purely in land culture," characterized by "bone, horn, stone and native-copper implements." It not only lacks pottery, but is also different in char acter from the site on the University of Alaska grounds. He also reports that the lower Tanana Indians used to make pottery from clay ob tained on the Yukon, near Arlan Jordan's fish camp, about 35 miles above Tanana, and that the Indians say that this pottery was traded up the Tanana for 425 miles, as far as Big Delta. The extent of this trade remains as yet uncon firmed.8 NOTES ON THE YUKON BETWEEN RAMPART AND TANANA (FIGURE 2) Various sites were reported to us on the 40 mile stretch of the Yukon above the mouth of the Tanana. We obtained a few specimens said to have been found at some of these places but Rainey, Letter dated September 24, 1937; Rainey, 1939, pp. 364r-371. Workshop sites in the Tanana Valley be low Tanana Crossing are at Good Paster River, Chena River near Fairbanks, and Lake Harding (pp. 371-374).</page><page sequence="46">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 39 had no opportunity to investigate the sites. A number of sites above Rampart are reported by Rainey.4 A small double-ended "hunting adz" or pick was purchased from Chief Luke, Tanana Mission, which he said came from Rampart Rapids (PL XI, 2). There is said to have been an old camp or village site at Julius Joseph's fish camp, on the south bank of the river, about 7 miles below the Rapids. The earth shows traces of char coal. We purchased from Joseph Nikolai, of Tanana Mission, a large double-ended "hunt ing adz" or pick, said to have been found at this site (PL X, P). Both Nikolai and Chief Luke said that it was here that the natives used to obtain clay for making pottery. It was not necessary to mix sand for tempering, be cause the clay already contained a sufficient quantity. Stone adzes are said to have been found at Arlan Jordan's homestead, on the north bank of the Yukon, about 2 or 3 miles above the mouth of Morelock Creek, some 35 miles above Tanana and 6 miles below Rampart Rapids. Adzes were also found by Louie Ky low, when spading his garden, about \ mile above the mouth of the creek. These sites are said to be on small knolls, about 30 feet above the high water level. These were reported by Commissioner William Thompson, of Tanana. I was told by Mrs. Coulombe, of Kalland, that there is said to have been a battle between the local Indians and invaders from the Kobuck River on a hill in back of Jordan's homestead. An old trail starts from here to the Kobuck River. I do not know whether any artifacts have been found here, however. At Tanana Mission, we purchased two ulo shaped stone scrapers which are said to have been found at the mouth of Jackson Creek. Unfortunately we were unable to locate this creek on the map. One specimen was bought from Chief Luke (PL XIII, 19), the other from Mrs. Sarah Joe (PL XIII, 17). Schwatka (1883)6 places Senati's village on the north bank of the Yukon at the Rapids. Petroff (1880) places it much nearer to the mouth of the Tanana. We were unable to iden tify this place with any of the sites mentioned 4 Rainey, 1939, pp. 375-376. 5 The dates in parentheses refer to the date of the visit, not of the author's publication. No specific references are given to maps. above. Whymper (1867) mentions the village of Chief Sekneota or "Senitee" above the Ram parts as being the first Kutchin village reached as one ascends the Yukon.6 The Ramparts seem to mark the Tena-Kutchin boundary. Rainey not only reports an extensive deposit of clay at Jordan's homestead about 6 miles below the Rapids, but also found potsherds there. This site, as we have mentioned before, is about 35 miles above the mouth of the Ta nana. He also reports that potsherds have been found at the Agricultural Experimental Sta tion at Rampart, some 75 miles above Tanana.7 Since this site is considerably above Senati's Village, we must conclude that either the pre historic Kutchin near Rampart manufactured "crude pottery" after the Tena pattern, or the Tena themselves formerly lived farther up the Yukon than they did at the time of the first white explorers. THE YUKON BETWEEN THE TANANA AND THE NOWITNA (FIGURE 2) A stone adz is said to have been found on the beach at Tanana Mission, and an Indian told me that he had often found potsherds when digging in the Mission gardens (PL II, 2). In the cut bank just below the Mission landing, we found charcoal, cut logs, nails, knives, china, etc., to a depth of 12 inches, but nothing to suggest prehistoric occupancy. We also searched the Mission gardens but found no trace of an old site. Schwatka (1883) indicates a village at the Mission and another near Tanana, 4 miles below. Stone adzes are reported from Willow Creek, on the point between the Tanana and the Yukon (PL V, 2). A native camp (age uncer tain) is said to have been located between the lake and the hill. The name for this point, according to Jette is Nukluroyit, "at the point of the big island," i.e., the mainland between the Tanana and the Yukon. This name was applied to the Russian trading post here, was transferred to the post later established on the north bank opposite, and was finally applied also to the post, "Old Station," established at Teketsenedakaihten, 15 miles below Tanana. Dall and Whymper visited the original trading post on the point in 1867, which the former calls "Nuklukahyet," the latter, "Nuclu 8 Whymper, 1869, p. 247. 7 Rainey, Letter dated September 24,1937; Rainey, 1939, pp.376-378.</page><page sequence="47">40 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 kayette." Jacobsen visited the same post in 1883.8 The only site which we found near Tanana was at Mr. and Mrs. Adam's place, about | mile below Tanana Mission. Here we discovered a number of artifacts along the cut river bank under his gardens. The bank is here 10 feet high, with scanty traces of charcoal, fire cracked rocks, and potsherds to a depth of from 12 to 24 inches. No animal or fish bones were seen. The site is about 100 to 200 feet long from east to west, but we had the impression that most of it had been washed away. The specimens from this site are :9 unfinished double ended splitting adz (PL XII, 1); unfinished single-ended (?) splitting adz (35-21-14); two hammerstones (35-21-12, -13); chipped end scraper blade (PL XIV, 4)\ fragment of large slate blade (35-21-15); undecorated potsherds, evidently from two vessels (PL XXII, 5, 6; Fig. 26, jf, 2). Hrdlicka mentions that he obtained several stone adzes found on the beach or in gardens between Tanana and Tanana Mission.10 Mr. Adams said that he gave him a flat, grooved, double-bladed planing adz or ax (?), and a club head, a round stone, grooved almost com pletely around the middle, which he had found on the beach at his house. Mr. Henry Luttman, of Tanana, gave us a stone hammer head (PL X, 6) which he found on the aviation field, about 300 feet from the western edge of the cleared ground. The stream here had cut a deep hole and the ham mer head was found in its bed, some 3 feet below the original surface of the field. It had undoubtedly been carried there by the stream, for we found no trace of human remains in the sterile silt. On the south edge of the field, about 100-200 feet from the east end, we saw charcoal and fire-cracked rocks in the turf. There was no clue as to the age of this camp site. John Burchell, of Nenana, reports an old site on the military reservation of old Fort Gibbon, on the north bank of the Yukon about 8| miles below Tanana and 1| miles above the 8 Dall, 1870, p. 93; Whymper, 1869, p. 236; Jacobsen, 1884, p. 191. 9 Catalogue numbers of the University of Pennsylvania Museum are given in the text only for specimens not illus trated in this report; catalogue numbers of illustrated speci mens will be found in the legends accompanying plates and figures. w Hrdlicka, 1930a, p. 43. mouth of the Tozi. It is about ? mile below the site of the "Old Mission" which was destroyed by fire, and is just above the beginning of a high silt bluff. We did not visit the place. Petroff (1880) marks this as Nuklukaiet on his map, and reports a population of 29.11 Schwatka (1883) marks houses, graves, and caches here. A copper spear head, about 18 inches long and 2\ inches wide, with a long, broad tang and two pairs of barbs, is said to have been found at the mouth of the Tozi, according to Mr. Luttman, but we found no indication of a site. Mr. Luttman also gave us a splitting adz which he found on Fleshmana Creek, an eastern tributary of the Tozi (PL X, 8). Natives at Tanana Mission report similar finds on the upper Tozi but were unable to indicate the exact localities. We visited an abandoned site known as "Old Station." Jette has identified this place as Teketsenedakaihten, where the trading post was established between 1887 and 1908. He writes of it: "The second location of the trading post known as Nukluroyit. When the trading post was finally transferred to Tanana the place became known as the 'Old Station.' This was subsequently deserted by the native popu lation, and the appellation was transferred to the camps where they settled, so that there are now three localities, close to each other, called 'Old Station,' viz, Teketsenedakaihten, on the mainland, another village on an island (Keihnu) opposite Teketsenedakaihten, and Tsotsikon ten on the mainland, two miles below Teket senedakaihten. [This last name means the "place where we caught beaver in a dipnet." It is probably the Sitzikunten of Dall,12 and the "New Old Station" where Elia Sport now lives.] The confusion between the three Old Stations is second only to that between the various Nukluroyits." The Old Station is called Nuclavayette on Schwatka's map (1883) and Nuklukyat on that of the Eleventh Census. We explored here a clearing on a knoll about 30 feet high, between two small creeks about 350 feet apart (PL V, 3). The houses have all fallen down with the exception of a few posts, possibly supports for caches. The soil was frozen to within 12 inches of the surface except along the cut banks of one of the streams 11 Petroff, 1884, p. 12. 12 Dall, 1870, p. 282. He describes it as a stream entering the north side of the Yukon, 65 miles above the "Nowika kat," or Nowitna River.</page><page sequence="48">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 41 where a section of midden, 18 inches thick, was exposed. In this we found only a glass bead. In various pits, probably house pits, we found many animal bones and scraps of china and rusty iron. There was nothing to indicate an older settlement. On the birch-covered knoll east of the site are a number of modern graves. Hrdlicka states that a trail led from here to the Koyukuk. Hrdlicka also reports house pits ["dug-outs (birch bark lined)"] and graves between this place and the Eighteen-Mile Road House, for merly owned by Mr. John Burchell, now at Nenana. Large stone adzes, a bone scraper, and a long ivory spear were said to have been found in this vicinity.13 We noticed a thin midden at the "New Old Station" near Elia Sport's cabin, but it seems to be modern. Mr. Burchell gave us an unfinished adz or hammer head (PL XI, 1), found on the beach at the Eighteen Mile Road house. We did not visit this place. There are a number of sites in the vicinity of Kalland from which artifacts are reported. Kalland, locally known as xun/aUn (Jette: Ron'aten) is a small settlement, consisting of a number of native houses scattered along the top of a 30-foot bank, just above the mouth of Illinois Creek. Other names for this place are nukatlika7at (Koyukuk dialect), Nukatlika kat, the mouth of the Nukatlitno or Nuarlitno (Jette), Newchuklicargut or Nuchuklikakat (Petroff), Kuklukayet (Jacobsen), Khalen (Hrdlicka). The present village covers a stretch about a quarter of a mile long. There is a lower terrace at the mouth of the creek, and below this, again, the higher terrace continues. Mrs. Coulombe, who lives in the last house above the creek flats reported that the former occupant had found many archaeological artifacts in his garden on the flat. We investigated the place without success. There were only the ruins of a modern semisubterranean house, with flat, birch bark-covered roof. The house was 14 feet square, the walls of rotted logs banked with earth about 2 feet high. Artifacts have also been found on top of the higher terrace where the present village is located. Mrs Coulombe sold us a barbed arrow head (PL XV, 18) found on the path between her house and the river beach. Tom Butler told us that he had found a stone adz in front of his house, about 12 inches below the surface, when he was digging a path down the bank. 13 Hrdli&amp;a, 1930a, p. 46. There were formerly the ruins of a semisub terranean house in his garden. It is said to have been roofed with bark, banked with earth, and entered through a low door. The fact that the house was still as well preserved as this descrip tion suggests would indicate that it could not be very old. However, a stone adz was found near it. Skeletons have also been found along the river bank. Mrs. Paul found an ulo-shaped stone scraper in front of her cabin. On the opposite side of the river, but slightly above Kalland, a few specimens have been found. One of these was the stone mouthpiece for a cord drill. It was found between Tom Butler's and Kennedy's fish camps. Mrs. Paul made a sketch of the specimen showing that it resembled in general shape the bone specimen which we obtained at Blackburn Slough on the lower Yukon (cf. PL XIV, 10). Mr. John Burchell reports a site about ? or f of a mile below the mouth of Illinois Creek, where the high terrace begins again. The old clearing on top of the bank has since been over grown. It was here that Skinny Alberts had a cabin, now in ruins. Tom Butler reports that an ulo-shaped scraper was found here. We ex plored the place but found no indication of an old site. Some 3J or 4 miles below Illinois Creek, at Nikolai Alberts' camp, were found a stone club (PL XII, 2) and an unbarbed bone arrow head (PL XV, 2), which we purchased from Mrs. Coulombe. We did not visit the place. The bluffs here are called denaqoxolkotcDin (Tena-ka-rolekokten, Jette) or "landslide," because they once fell on a man. Dr. Eardley has named them the Cave-Off Cliffs. Another village site is reported by Tom But ler at the lower side of Nikolai Creek, which enters the Yukon from the south, below the Palisades, and some 9 miles below Kalland. Mrs. Nikolai is still living there. This is prob ably Jette's Tlatsordokakat, mouth of the Tlatsordotno, or "across the bluff river," be cause the bluff of the Palisades hides the view of the stream. The Palisades (PL I, 4) are Naradenilna-katlona, "cut bank of the ghosts" (Jette). Allen (1885) marks the Klat sutakakat River in the middle of the Palisades, but indicates the village in the correct place. Schwatka (1883) marks a village just below the mouth of the creek. A site was reported at Big Albert's camp, on the north side of the river, on the large point 2 miles above the mouth of the Nowitna.

Fig. 3.?The Lower Koyukuk and the Yukon from Nowitna to Nulato. name is mitmdqotlDin or bitbnlqoth)in or "white bluffs," in the Koyukuk and local di alects, respectively. Jette calls it Melnelekol ten, "place where the ground is lumpy and white," and identifies it as the site of Kokrines or Hakara's first trading post. It is also known as Me-ok-ne-oz-dok, or Miokniozdok, he re ports. This may be the Mercier Station of Petroff (1880). This place is about 14 miles above Kokrines. We located traces of a midden on the upper side of the point, opposite the eastern end of the larger of the two islands blocking the mouth of the Nowitna. The mid den contained animal bones, charcoal and orange-colored ash, and was on a low terrace bordering the beach. The higher terrace in back is about 30 feet high. Big Albert's camp is a short distance down the beach. Most of the lower terrace with the midden has been washed away. We were unable to find any clue to the age of this site. In 1929, Hrdlicka obtained a number of specimens (adzes, USNM 351147, etc.) from "Big Albert's slough, 15 miles above Kokrines." It may be the same place. THE YUKON FROM THE NOWITNA TO THE KOYUKUK, (FIGURE 3) Mrs. Annie Alberts, of Kalland, reports an old site at the mouth of the Nowitna, although she does not know whether it was on the main</page><page sequence="50">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 43 land or on one of the islands. Jette locates a camp here, called Norikakat, or mouth of the Noritna, "frog river." It has also been called Newcargut, Noyakakat, Nowikakat, Novi kakat, etc. Zagoskin's map (1843) indicates the Nowitna as the Noggoiya, HorrofiH, but does not show any village here. Holmberg (1855), who generally follows Zagoskin very closely, marks Noggoya (a camp or village) just below the mouth of the Nowitna. There was certainly a settlement here in 1876 for Dall and Whymper visited the place, and the latter refers to "New icargut, one of the most important halting places on the river," where 150 natives were gathered at the time of their visit. Dall de scribes it as "a mere collection of huts, tem porary lodges, and tents; one or two winter houses seemed as if long deserted and rapidly going to decay." There is here "a small cove or harbor, which opens by a narrow passage into the Yukon, and on which Nowikakat village is situated.14 Petroff reports a population of 107 in 1880.16 Schwatka (1883) marks a village on a point some little distance above the mouth of the stream, but it is probably the same place. Jacobsen (1883) refers to the village by the name Nukakiet.18 Zagoskin says that the natives reported many winter barabaras on the headwaters of the Nowitna.17 Henry Luttman told us that he had found pottery in this area, some 100 miles up stream by canoe travel. The pots were large enough to hold two quarts, and varied in color from red to yellow. An Indian woman from Nulato reports pictures painted on the rocks at Beaver Creek, a tributary of the Nowitna that drains the hills behind Ruby. She said there was also "writing in Russian." Mrs. Annie Alberts also told us that there was formerly a village at Mouse Point, on the north side of the Yukon, about 6 miles, by river, below the Nowitna. There are still a few people living there, on a bench below the 65 foot silt hill, just above the mouth of a draw. We did not examine the place. It is called delt'sanu7oyit, "mouse point," or Tiltsaa nuroyit (Jette). Jacobsen (1883) also refers to Delsanorvit, where a shaman tried to destroy by magic the steamer on which he was travel ing.18 14 Whymper, 1869, p. 229; Dall, 1870, pp. 78, 282. 15 Petroff, 1884, p. 12. 16 Jacobsen, 1884, p. 192. 17 Zagoskin, (1935), p. 184. 18 Jacobsen, 1884, p. 192, Kokrines, a small Indian village with two stores, has been established only recently. The older site of the village, bikidenikesDin "red paint," is above the graveyard of the present village. Jette gives this name as Mekedeni kasten "red ochre," and explains that it more properly refers to a place on the south bank of the Yukon, 2 miles below Kokrines. Kokrines is often called by the name of the older village, but its own name is toihdenelekasten "red sand place," and the name Kokrines is a cor ruption of the name of the trader, Hakara, who moved here from the site at Big Albert's camp, (Jette). On his map, Petroff places a village on the south side of the Yukon, which he calls Soon kakat. This is probably the Tsunukakat of Jette, some 4 miles below Kokrines. Between this village and the Nowitna, Petroff lists Medvednia. Soonkakat had a population of twelve, Medvednia boasted fifteen in 1880.19 Zagoskin mentions a camp of natives about 2 miles above Big Creek and another camp of natives from Big Creek still farther up the Yukon, where they had four canoes made of caribou skin.20 It is possible, of course, that these temporary camps are Petroff's Soonkakat and Medvednia, but it is not likely, since the latter were supposed to be permanent settle ments. Both Porter and Petroff mark a village called Mentokakat, at what seems to be the mouth of Big Creek. This is a tributary that enters the Yukon from the south, just above the Ruby hills. Zagoskin calls Big Creek Minhotliatno, rendered on the map as Minxochlyachno, Mhhxohjihhho, but does not mention or indicate any camp at its mouth. The map erroneously transposes the names for Big Creek and the Melozi, although the text makes perfectly clear to which tributary the respective names should apply, and this error is repeated on Holmberg's map. The latter even indicates a village by the name of Minchothljatno on the north bank of the Yukon, just above the Me lozi. Mrs. Dago Kid Brown, of Ruby, said that she had seen house pits on a small knoll above the second creek above Ruby (i.e. between Big Creek and Ruby) on the south side of the Yukon. We visited the place, but found only signs of a recent camp. A stone chisel is said to 19 Petroff, 1884, p. 12. 20 Zagoskin, (1935), pp. 174, 177.</page><page sequence="51">44 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 have been found at the creek above that (i.e. about 3 miles above Ruby). Jette gives the name Latsulok, "earthen pot," to a nearby hill, which suggests that the natives may have obtained clay for pottery in the vicinity. Most of the bluffs here are of limestone. Ruby itself is a modern town. For a view of the Yukon near Ruby, looking upstream, see Plate V, 4. Mr. Ohls, of Anchorage, whom I met in 1930, gave me a club head (PL X, 3) which he found on the banks of the Melozi, about a mile above its mouth. We ascended the river for a distance of 2\ miles, but a careful search failed to reveal any old site. The Melozi, like the Yukon, has been undercutting its banks, so that any old site is likely to have been washed away. The Melozi, according to Jette, is properly called the Melorizitna, "its upper end is backwards," a significant topographic feature that is often mentioned in the geological reports on this region. The mouth is called Melorozi kakat, corrupted in the literature to Melozika kak, Melozicargut, Losi-kaket, etc. Zagoskin renders the name as Molekozhitno, MojieKo jkhtho, although, as already explained, the map applies this name erroneously to Big Creek. Holmberg has indicated a village on the Yukon just above the mouth of the Melozi, applying to it Zagoskin's name for Big Creek. While there is no trace of a site above the present mouth of the Melozi, it is possible that the Melozi once emptied into the Yukon farther south. The former village, "Old Melozi," on the north bank of the Yukon, on a point just below and across from Ruby, may therefore have been just above an earlier mouth of the Melozi, since Mr. Bill Alfred, who lives there, told us that the place used to be an island be fore the slough in back dried up. The shore at the point has been washed back at least a hundred feet to his knowledge, so that any re mains of a significant age would have been destroyed. The river is still undercutting the 15-foot bank and washing out graves. Mr. Alfred estimates these to be about fifty years old, to judge by the Russian crosses and iron tools found with them. However, there may have been an older site at or near this place, because a native found a stone club head on the beach. Mr. Alfred describes it as egg-shaped, with a blunt point at each end. The Indian who found it said that it had been hafted in skin and was used to brain people. Mr. Alfred un derstood him to mean that the stone lacked a stiff handle of bone or wood. However, the Indian may have meant only that the head was covered with skin in order to haft it to a handle. Conceivably this specimen is the one which we acquired from Mr. Ohls. In any case, we found two large notched stones on the beach in front of Mr. Alfred's place (35-21-157 a, b). The natives at Koyukuk identified Jacob sen's Belase-karat21 as "Old Melozi," pro nounced b9lostka7at in their dialect, meaning "the mouth of the Melozi." They were,.how ever, unable to identify Jacobsen's Makkat mekettan with its graveyard and Norraden kulten, both between Mouse Point and Old Melozi. It is possible that Norraden-kulten is actually the "Old Lowden" below Lowden Point discussed below. We were also unable to identify the village of Nusarron, somewhere be tween Old Melozi and Old Lowden. Jette ex plains the names Tanakot, Tanathotkhaiak, and Tanohkalony, sometimes applied to Old Melozi, as corruptions of the demonstratives used in pointing. The correct name for Old Melozi, as well as for a village on the south bank of the Yukon opposite, is Nurutlare lenten, "the current runs in the slough." This twin village to Old Melozi is on the south bank of the Yukon, at the upper mouth of a slough connecting the mouths of Main and Yuto creeks, according to Mrs. Brown. Can this conceivably be Jacobsen's mysterious Nor raden-kulten? Zagoskin's map shows the slough, Protok Notlyagelyata, LTpotokt, HoTjiHrejiHTa, but does not indicate any settlement there. Pet rofFs map (1880) shows a village, Yutokakat, just below the mouth of Yuto Creek. There are a number of sites on the first large bend of the Yukon below Ruby, all of which are known as Lowden or Louden. These are, going downstream: (1) New Lowden, on the north bank above the point, (2) Old Lowden at the end of the point, (3) Old Lowden on the south bank of the Yukon opposite the point, (4) Old Lowden just below the point. These three "Old Lowdens" seem to have been inhabited simul taneously. The name "Lowden" seems to be a corruption of the native name tsaxadaloDtn, "the point of the hill," (Site 2) according to our Koyukuk informants, and Jette's Tsara dal'oten, "where the river bends towards," more properly the name of the village on the 21 Jacobsen, 1884, pp. 192, 194.</page><page sequence="52">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 45 south bank (Site 3), though sometimes applied to the camp on the point (Site 2). Besides "Lowden," Jette gives other corruptions of the native name: Zakatlatan (Petroff), Sakatalon tan (Dall), Saghadellanten, Sakadelontin (Schwatka), Sachertelontin (Whymper), Sadul loten, etc.22 The proper name for the village on the point (Site 2) is, according to Jette, Raben etsihten, or according to our informants, xam entcicDt11, "nose-paint place." Our informants applied the name to Site 3, on the south point opposite. Hrdlicka marks graves on the south bank. Our informants at Koyukuk identified Jacobsen's Kommensita with xamentcicDi11, and it is probably the summer camp which Dall (1867) called Kamen-sikhter.23 Zagoskin mentions the hill on the north bank "called Naminchihten from its rocky pinnacles," and the village, Tlialikakat, on the south bank op posite. "According to the guide, this is the only established village on the Kvihpak [Yukon] as farther up the natives are living scattered all over the interior and come to the river just to lay up the winter supply of fish."24 He obviously means that above this point there were no per manent villages on the Yukon. The site generally known as "Old Lowden," however, was on the north bank of the Yukon, about a half mile below the point (Site 4). Our Koyukuk informants called it naxaudo titlDtn, and Jette renders it as Nararadotilten, "the bluff comes down to nothing." It has been variously corrupted to Nahachatilton, Nahata tilton, Nahodatilten, and Nahohlatilten, (Jette), and Know-how-to-tilt-'em. This is evi dently Petroff's Natulaten, though he marks it on the south bank, too far down stream. It was abandoned only thirty or forty years ago, when the natives moved to "New Lowden" (Site 1), or Lowden Telegraph Station, just above the point, and some two miles above the former village. New Lowden is the "Lowden" of 22 Dall (1870, p. 83) applies the name to Site 2 on the point; Schwatka's map applies the name to the hill forming the point, but shows a camp site under the hill; Petroff's Zakatlatan is on the south bank (Site 3); Whymper (1869, p. 226) simply mentions the "fishing village" of Sacherte lontin. 23 Jacobsen, 1884, p. 194; Dall, 1870, p. 82. 24 Zagoskin, (1935), pp. 167 f. On the map, Tlialikakat, TjiHJiHKaKT-B seems to refer to the lower mouth of the slough connecting Main and Yuto creeks, while an un named village is marked on the south bank some distance below Lowden Bend. I believe the map is here in error, for "Tlialikakat" seems to be Jette's Tsaradal'oten. Hrdlicka's map. The original name of the new site was, according to Jette, Ranotsebanede tonten, "it is lined with spruce," but the native name for Old Lowden, together with the various European corruptions, were also transferred to the new site. New Lowden was abandoned in 1920, when the natives moved to Galena. The natives also told us of a former village site on the north bank, some 4 miles above the point, named kintotsitsDtn, after some man. Jette, however, gives the name Kentotsits ronten as the name of the bluff. The natives also told us that they used to dig clay for pottery somewhere between Old and New Lowden. The white clay pits are said to be still visible, though we did not see them. White, chalk-like clay was also said to have been ob tained from about three miles below Old Lowden (Site 4). The only site of this group which we visited was the Old Lowden on the point on the north bank (Site 2). On the beach were many signs of recent occupancy; glass beads, china etc. (35 21-30). On the bank above are a number of graves. Some of these have fallen down out of the bank onto the beach. We took the bones from one of these disturbed graves (35-21-24). Beside the left femur were two dentalium shells and several small white beads, two cylindrical opaque red glass beads, and one cylindrical bead of dark blue glass (35-21-25). Beside the vertebrae were one dentalium shell and small black and white glass beads (35-21-26), a flint blade (PL XIV, 15), and a knife made of strap iron and fastened with copper rivets to a decorated wooden handle (35-21-28). In another fallen grave, which we did not excavate, there were small white and dark blue or black beads, and a larger white bead (35-21-29). The bank of the high terrace on which the graves stand runs for about a half mile. On the very end of the point, where most of the terrace has been washed away, we found traces of a midden, with reddish humus, ashes and animal bones, to a depth of 8 or 9 inches. Galena, on the next point below Old Lowden, was established about 1920, and there seems to be no trace of an earlier settlement there. The native name is not'axliDtn, "water is whirling around." (Jette: Notarleten, "where it whirls to the bottom" [?].) In former times there were several sites near Bishop Mountain or Bishop Rock (PL VI, 1). The name for this hill is yisitla', which our</page><page sequence="53">46 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 local informant derived from yes, "wolf." Jette gives the name as Yesetla, "big mountain." He explains: Yelkor [was] a legendary giant who came from the south, where he was starving, according to tradition, followed by his wife. Before reaching the Yukon, however, they fell down, exhausted, and their remains are still seen in the shape of mountains. The wife is Rone'uye, of the Kayar range; the giant himself is Nodaros, a little farther to the east. In his fall, the pack which he carried on his shoulders tumbled over to the north bank of the Yukon, where it con stitutes the small hill Yesetla. One bluff point, also on the north [or west] bank, 5 miles above Nulato, called Yelkor tlala, or "Yelkor's flint," must be also a relic of that mem orable event, but no distinct tradition concerning it could be obtained. There is supposed to have been a village or camp site on the flat below the hill, but it seems to have been washed away. The approximate place is marked by a recently abandoned smokehouse. Dall mentions a solitary house and grave here (?) in 1867.25 This camp site is called Yesetlator, "under the big rock," according to Jette, and the same name was applied to a camp on the island or the south bank of the river opposite. Hrdlicka marks a village on this island. We found a fish camp here. The natives there applied the same name, istthtox, to a spring camp site in the slough above the hill. There is no information as to the age of any of these places, though we suspect that they were only modern. Petroff in 1880 mentions "Big Mountain," and marks the village of Bol shoigor at the hill. Zagoskin (1843) mentions a settlement or camp, called Tashoshgon, beside a small stream, on the slope of the Isitlia cliff, but does not say whether it was above or below this hill.26 Another old spring camp site is tokayat, "end of the slough," on the north bank of the Yukon, about ? mile above the mouth of the Koyukuk. It is just above the mouth of a small slough, from which the name is derived. Holm berg (1855) indicates Tokchakath roughly in this locality. We found only the signs of a recent camp here. Hrdlicka marks Tokhkhakat on the upper end of the large island, Yukon Island, at the mouth of the Koyukuk. Accord ing to Zagoskin, (1843) Tokhakat was up a stream (or slough ?) about two miles from the mouth of the Koyukuk. There was only one winter house here. Although he is not explicit, one has the impression that in ascending the Yukon, he crossed the mouth of the Koyukuk, 25 Dall, 1870, pp. 78 f. 2? Zagoskin (1935), p. 162. went up the small slough to Tokhakat, and from there passed on out the upper end of the slough, back into the Yukon. Unless the chan nels have shifted, which of course they may well have done, the camping place which we visited was not Zagoskin's Tokhakat.27 His map shows Tokxakat, ToKxanaT-B, on the north bank of the Yukon, opposite the end of the large island (Yukon Island) which lies at the mouth of the Koyukuk. The map also indicates that the main channel of the Yukon flowed south of this island, and that the Koyukuk entered the Yukon opposite the western end of the island. This is still true, though the northern channel around the island is much larger than Zago skin's map indicates. The map does not show the small slough on which Tokxakat was lo cated. Zagoskin's village may have been about a mile south (upstream) of the place we visited. THE KOYUKUK AND THE YUKON TO JUST ABOVE NULATO (FIGURE 3) The Lower Koyukuk We undertook an exploration of the lower Koyukuk River because Johnny Dayton, a native of Koyukuk Station, described the re mains of what he believed to be a prehistoric fort at Kateel. He also gave us to understand that he could lead us to several other old sites. He seems to have been mistaken as to their age, or else all ancient remains have been washed away, for we found nothing along the 90 miles of the Koyukuk which antedated contact with the whites. He pointed out to us the fol lowing sites, though we did not have a chance to explore them: 1. xotakadt71, "above place" (Jette's Ro takaten), on the east site of the Koyukuk about 3 miles above the mouth. This was said to be a winter camp. 2. nok^at, "mouth of a little slough," also on the east bank, about 3 miles above the first locality, and one long bend above a silt bluff. It was occupied both summer and winter. Zagoskin visited Nokhakat village, on the west bank of the Koyukuk, 8 miles above its mouth. The village consisted of three winter houses and had a population of fifty people in 1843.28 His map, however, indicates Nokxakat, HoKxa KaT'L, on the west bank of what is now the north channel of the Yukon, very near the Young 17 Op. tit., pp. 132 f., 163. 28 Op. tit., pp. 133 f.</page><page sequence="54">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 47 Girl's Cave (see page 51). However, this cave seems to be the summer camping place of the people from Nokxakat, which Zagoskin also mentions, though he speaks of it as on the east bank of the Koyukuk, at its mouth.29 Holm berg's Nokchakath is on the west bank of the Koyukuk roughly opposite the place that Johnny Dayton pointed out to us. 3. klakindco7ehndin, "where the current hits the bluff," was a recent summer camping place, nearly opposite Site 2. (It is possible that this was the site of Zagoskin's Nokxakat.) A woman at Koyukuk has a fragment of a clay pot which she found here. It has a flat bottom, about 4.5 cm in diameter, with widely sloping sides. 4. kitfyo-trt, "central place for ducks that can't fly in summer," to quote Johny's free but spirited translation (Jette: Kettroteyit), on the east bank, 4 miles above the last site. 5. xonu'7udtn, "above or behind another place" (Jette: Ronuurten, "big bend" [?]), only f mile above the last site, and on the same side of the river. 6. xDtlkat'fot, "rotten wood place," said to be in the dialect of the upper Koyukuk peo ple, from dalikiflcot (Jette: Rolkardiot[?]). This was a winter camp or village about 4 miles above the last site. 7. t'so&gt;kcoc7iardtn "a long patch of willows comes out here" (Jette: Tsekoihre'oten). This is on the west bank of the Koyukuk at the mouth of a small stream, which the U. S. Geological Survey maps erroneously place about 4 miles south of its true location. This is the only site below Kateel which we attempted to explore. The former village is supposed to be on the narrow tongue of land between the stream and the river, where there is now an abandoned cabin. We found no evidence of an earlier occu pation, but the stream is rapidly cutting away this point, so any old remains have probably been washed away. On the beach above the stream mouth we found a large notched stone (PL XII, 5). Allen (1885) shows a village on the opposite bank of the river, about 3 miles above this place. 8. gitlatlakaGat "at the mouth of the animal river," from gitlatlana', or Gisasa River (Jette: Ketalakakat), was both a summer and a winter village, and was located on the island in front of the mouth. This is Holm 29 Op.cit.,p. 162. berg's (1855) Kachljachljakakath. Allen (1885) shows a burial ground on the west bank of the Koyukuk, just above the mouth of the Gisasa. Zagoskin (1843) describes this site as follows: "Way back from the point where the small river Kalialishtna joins the Unna'-ka lays the settle ment, Kokliakakat."30 He also gives the name Kahlishiakakat. He mentions cliffs near the village, and accurately describes the Gisasa as coming from the west-southwest with its headwaters near those of the Nulato River. The winter village on the west bank of the Koyukuk had two winter houses and twenty six people. The summer houses were on the island opposite the mouth of the river. Johnny Dayton mentioned a large tree on this island on which the natives used to hang their belongings. Zagoskin's map renders the Gisasa River as Kalyalyaxtna, KajiajiaxTHa, and the village on the Koyukuk, just north of its mouth, as Kaxlyaxlyakakat, KaxjiaxjiaKaKaTB. 9. ts6n6kotlaxdtn, "place where the fish run out all the time," was said to have been a dou ble settlement on both sides of the Koyukuk, occupied in both summer and winter. Johnny Dayton locates it about 4 miles above the mouth of the Bitsla River. Jette gives the name Dzanoketlarten or Tsenoketlarten, and identi fies it as the Tsogliakten of Tikmenef (1861). Tikmenef was certainly following Zagoskin. When the latter explored the Koyukuk in 1843, he visited two settlements, both on the east bank of the Koyukuk. The first was Zohogoh liaten (Tsonagolyaxten, IJoHarojiaxTeH-L, on the map), with one winter house and eleven adults, the second place above it was Tzogliakten (Tsog lyaxten, IJorjiaxTeHt of the map), with one house and seven adults.31 Holmberg's map (1855) gives Zonagogljachten and Zogljachten. 10. Kateel. This site is discussed in the next section. 11. Other camping places and village sites were reported by Johnny Dayton on the Koyu kuk between Kateel and the mouth of the Huslia River, and locations for two of these are indicated on the map according to his informa tion. However, we did not visit any of them, and need only mention Dolby, where he said he had found the unbarbed bone arrowhead which we purchased (PL XV, 1). Andrew Pilot, shaman at Koyukuk Station, said that his father used to run a trading post for the Rus Op.tit.,p. 135. 81 Op. tit.,pp. 136 f.</page><page sequence="55">48 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 sians at Dolby. The place was two miles up Dolby (or Dubli) River, on its south bank. I do not know whether the arrowhead came from the site of the trading post or from the mouth of the Dolby. Johnny Dayton gives the native name for Dolby as dodbakaGat, "the mouth of the river with lots of young geese," which suggests that the original settlement of that name had been at the mouth of the river. Johnny Dayton's reason for claiming that these sites were prehistoric is that people were supposed always to have lived or camped at them. Many of them are still occupied by the natives during the winter trapping season, but there is no reason to suppose that this tradition of their antiquity is any more reliable than simi lar traditions about other sites which we found to be erroneous. The Yukon Indians in this respect show a marked contrast to the Chugach Eskimo of Prince William Sound, for example, who have a lively sense of "history," and not only know the location of the prehistoric vil lages but could tell us many tales associated with them. Kateel Village Johnny Dayton calls this katilkaGat, "mouth of the luckiest river," from katilna, or Kateel River, because it was always a good place for hunting. Jette gives the name Kodil kakat, and describes it as: "A place of foremost importance in the traditions of the Koyukuk Indians, and generally referred to as a sort of happy land, the place of great hunts and of warlike people."32 The village site is on the east bank of the Koyukuk, opposite a former mouth of the Kateel, and about 1\ miles above its present mouth. Zagoskin calls it Hotil-kokot (Xotilnakat, XoTmiBHaKaT-B, on the map, and the river Xotilno, Xotlijilho, is shown on the map emptying into the Koyukuk opposite the vil lage). Holmberg renders the name as Chotyshl nakath; Hrdlicka, as Khotyl-kakat.33 Dall mentions the place as the chief village of the Koyiikons.34 In 1843 Zagoskin found here a big kashim, three winter houses and sixty-five in habitants. The Eskimo used to come here to trade with the Indians every year, and "es pecially for them was the kashim built as the Inkiliki, the Unnaka-hotena tribes do not have the habit of taking steam baths." This kashim 32 Jette\ 1908, p. 319. 33 Zagoskin, (1935), pp. 136 f.; Hrdlicka, 1930a, pp. 131 f. 34 Dall, 1870, p. 53. he describes as being 147 square feet. Johnny Dayton reported that his father had told him the fort at Kateel was built by the Indians in 1845, to protect them from Eskimo raids. Later, a Russian trading post was established on the west bank of the Koyukuk, just below the mouth of the Kateel, but the place was finally abandoned some thirty-odd years ago. Unfortunately at the time of our visit I was not acquainted with Zagoskin's report, and so did not realize that the ruined kashim which we saw was the same as that described by Zago skin. I ascertained from Johnny Dayton only that it was "a meeting house," and stupidly neglected to obtain further details. It is quite likely that the kashim here did not serve all the functions?festival hall, men's clubhouse and workshop, men's sweatbath house, guest house ?that kashims do farther down the Yukon, and yet it must have served some of these. For it seems incredible that the Kateel Indians should have been so hospitable as to have built this large structure solely to please their yearly Eskimo visitors, when only a few years later they were to build a fort against the same people. While the ruined village and fort at Kateel proved to be modern and revealed evidence of contact with Russian traders, the site, never theless, yielded a number of native artifacts, showing that much of the Indian life had re mained little affected by this contact. The village (Fig. 4) is on a narrow terrace, about 20 feet above the river level, and a quar ter-mile inland from the bank. This terrace is separated from the river by a swamp, and is completely hidden from the water by a growth of willows, cottonwoods, and alders. The ter race itself has a stand of spruce, birch, and willow; some of the latter, up to 6 inches in diameter, are growing in the house pits. There are seven houses on the ridge. The dwelling houses, numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7, seem to have been approximately of the same size, as far as could be determined without ex cavation. Each house was excavated about 2 or 3 feet below the surface, and the earth banked up around the walls for a height of 3 to 5 feet. All the ground about each house seems to have been entirely reshaped by shoveling and bank ing. The entrance tunnels, leading into the pits, are about 2\ feet wide, and are generally longer than the longer dimension of the house. They enter through one of the longer walls, in every case that facing the water, except in House 2,</page><page sequence="56">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 49 which the tunnel enters from the north, obliquely away from the river. The houses have completely fallen in, and are now represented only by shallow pits from which protrude one or two rotten beams or posts that showed the sharp cuts of steel tools, probably adzes. Only in House 7 was no post visible above ground. un-7i V\ . ?w \\ \ ^'-t-"&lt;9&gt;'' " \v\ / ii! \ \ I J X \\\ ! / KATEEL VILLAGE T1TE n \ \ \ ! * SURVEYED BY P I ? *? / / A.]. tARDLtY 1 ? ii ' \ ?

Among the pits are large spruce stumps, showing the work of wedges or splitting adzes in tearing out pieces with the grain, in order to fell the tree. Near some of the houses are small pits, orig inally rectangular in outline, with which were also associated timbers. These seem to have been either retaining beams placed at the sur face of the ground at the edge of the pit, or else parts of a roof. These pits are: a (between Houses 1 and 2), b and c (between Houses 3 and 4, probably associated with the latter), d (near House 4), e (near House 6, the kashim), / and g (beyond House 7). Pit e is the only one of these that needs special mention. It is close to the south wall of the kashim and is approxi mately 4 feet square. At the middle of its south wall there is a small depression, 12 inches wide, like a miniature entrance tunnel. This may have been a play house. The other pits may have been, in part, holes in the ground from which turf and earth was obtained for covering the houses, but those with timbers were undoubt edly structures of some kind, probably caches such as are still used in some parts for frozen meat or for salmon eggs. We excavated pit d. The bottom was 1 foot below the surface of the depression, or 2 feet below the level of the ground. There were traces of ashes and charcoal in it, but these may have fallen in from a midden outside. Three logs lay diagonally across the bottom, their ends beyond the edge</page><page sequence="57">50 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 of the pit towards the tunnel of House 4. These probably represent the disarranged cover or roof of the cache pit. An antler wedge (PL XVI, 27) was found in the pit. The fort (House 5) was the only structure built entirely above ground. It was made of %.im I_j&amp;? i 5 I ! ; i Fig. 5.?House 4, Kateel (Fig. 3). large logs, roughly dovetailed together, the ends indifferently trimmed with a steel ax. The south wall, in which was left a small door way, was longer than the north wall. The east and west walls were the shortest. The door was a rectangular hole, about 18 inches above the ground, 18 inches high and 20 inches wide, or just big enough to admit a man. No traces of a roof were observed, and it is likely, therefore, that the fort was unroofed. The log walls at present stand to a height of 4 feet. No definite floor level was found inside. The entrance tun nel of House 6, identified by Johnny Dayton as the "meeting house" or kashim, opened through the floor of the fort, running almost to the middle of the latter. Cross beams, originally forming the roof of the tunnel, were found lying across the depression in the floor of the fort. House 6, the kashim, seemed like the other houses, except that the logs used in its construc tion were larger than usual, measuring 10 to 12 inches in diameter, and the building itself was larger. We partially excavated it. The tunnel, as on the other houses, was set into one of the longer walls, just to one side of the middle. The sides of the pit were retained by vertical stakes, and heavy beams were laid at the top of the ground outside the pit. In the center of the floor was a large heap of ashes and charcoal. The roof seems to have been of split poles, laid flat side up, covered with sheets of birch bark. Over the bark was moss and earth. How much of the latter was recent humus it was impossible to judge. The total depth of the accumulation in the pit was about 12 to 18 inches. The floor seems to have been about 3 feet below the top of the ground. We exposed only the north half of the roof, and here the poles ran north and south. Under the split poles of the roof were a few round poles running east and west. A large beam from just north of the entrance passage seems to have run all the way across the house, but since it was rotted through in the middle, we do not know exactly how the roof was con structed. It may have been cribbed, or pyram idal. House 4 was almost completely excavated. Figure 5 shows the roof beams as we found them; Figure 6, a possible reconstruction of the roof. The earth above the roof was full of ashes and charcoal, which may have been re mains of an earlier or a later midden. The bot tom of the pit was from 2 to 3 feet below the top of the banked walls. The edges of the pit were held in place by retaining stakes, with capping logs along the surface of the ground. Fig. 6.?Reconstruction of House 4, Kateel (Fig. 3). From the middle of the walls?the south wall was not uncovered?heavy beams ran to the center of the house, smaller beams ran from the corners towards the center. The southwest cor ner was not excavated. From the wall, smaller poles ran to these beams, apparently at a slight angle. This arrangement might result from the collapse of a pyramidal shaped roof. Across the corners were short diagonal poles. There was no trace of supporting posts in the center. In the middle of the house was a bed of ashes, 12 inches thick and about 5 feet in di</page><page sequence="58">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 51 ameter, in a pit 4 to 6 inches below the floor. On top of the roof we found remains of birch bark baskets, and part of a canoe, as well as the bark slabs sewn together to form the cover ing for the roof (35-21-37). In the kashim we found the following ob jects: four whetstones (PI. XII, 6, and 35-21-47 a, b, c) stone pottery smoother (35-21-48); antler wedge (PL XVI, 22); broken bone point (35-21-42); bone boot sole creaser (PI. XIV, 42); bone comb (PI. XIV, 39); wooden trigger for a set bow (PI. XVI, 5); wooden trigger for a trap (?) (PI. XVI, 6); several pieces of cut bone (35-21-45); fragments of a clay pot (PI. XXIII, 2); potsherds (Fig. 27, 3); and a few animal bones. In House 4 we found: barbed bone arrowhead for beaver (PL XV, 13); antler piece to strengthen a sinew-backed bow (PL XVI, 12); antler wedge (or ice pick ?) (PL XVI, 25); frag ment of wooden dipper (PL XVI, 4); potsherds (35-21-33); glass beads (35-21-153); and many animal bones. The Yukon below the mouth of the Koyukuk to just above Nulato On the west bank of the Yukon, just below the mouth of the Koyukuk, and near the upper end of the basalt cliffs forming Koyukuk Hill, is a cave or narrow cleft in the rocks. It is called kitlkani yax, "young girl's house." A boulder just ^visible inside the mouth looks like the back of a girl who is squatting on the floor. Smaller stones near her are supposed to be her sacks. The figure is said to be that of a young girl who was isolated here during her first menstruation and who turned to stone. We ex plored the floor of the cave, and while the soil between the boulders is stained with charcoal and contains fish scales to a depth of almost 3 feet, there were no other signs that it had been used as a camping place. The lower part of the cave would be flooded in spring high water. Somewhere along the same bank of the river, between the cave and the point of the bluff there is supposed to be a deposit of clay, which the women used for pottery. Indians from many miles away used to gather here to dig out the clay, camping "as thick as mosquitoes," on the shore of Yukon Island, opposite. We were un able to find any clay, and the sample of earth (weathered fragments of basalt), given us by Andrew Pilot, the local shaman, did not seem suitable for pottery-making, unless it was used for tempering. The summer camp of Nokxakat, mentioned by Zagoskin,85 is shown on his map on the east bank of the river, opposite the end of Yukon Island. On the sheer face of the bluff, facing down stream and overlooking the present native graveyard of Koyukuk, there is an indentation like a gigantic door. A white spot in the middle is supposed to be a padlock. According to one legend, some warriors, surprised by their ene mies, climbed to the top of the bluff and lowered themselves by thongs to a cave. They went in side, closing the stone door behind them, and were never seen again. According to another tale, the stone door marks the exit which the dead formerly used when they left the Koyukuk graveyard at night. People camping on Yukon Island opposite the cemetery were kept awake night after night by the revels of the ghosts. When they sent men to watch the graveyard at night to see where the dead were coming from, the ghosts did not appear, but as soon as the guard was removed, they became more noisy than ever. Finally the shamans were called in and they made a huge stone fly up and seal in the mouth of the cave, so that now the ghosts are effectively imprisoned. The present village of Koyukuk is on the west bank of the Yukon, about a mile below these high basalt cliffs. Plate VI, 2 shows a view of the hill taken from an airplane flying over Nulato; Plate VI, 5, is the view from the hill towards the mouth of the Koyukuk. About half a mile above Koyukuk Station is said to be the site of a large village, m?nil7ats9tbx, "under the hill." Jette gives the name Meni leradza or Menileradzator, "the fat round thing," and says it is actually the name oi Koyukuk Hill. This is probably the village which Dall visited in 1867.36 We found nothing at the site. Zagoskin (1843) mentions this vil lage under the name, Unilgochthoh, Unul gahthoh, and Unilgochthat, and reports one winter house and four summer houses here. He also mentions Koyukuk Hill, as Unilgoch Cliff, and specifies that the natives called it "pot" because "the mountain furnishes clay for the native homemade dishes." The village he visited was 3 miles below the mouth of the Koyukuk; after leaving it there was no other village on the Yukon above for a long time.37 Evidently Andrew Pilot was quite right in tell 38 Zagoskin (1935), p. 162. 88 Dall, 1870, p. 77. 87 Zagoskin (1935), pp. 131 f., 148, 160, but not located on his map.</page><page sequence="59">52 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 ing us that there was pottery clay in the vicinity of Koyukuk Hill, though he was mistaken as to its locality. We did not find any. Terentief's trading post, which Petroff indi cates on his map (1880), is on the west bank of the Yukon, 8 miles below Koyukuk. It is said to have been built on the site of a village called koyukozdtn, "red willows." Jette gives the forms KSyekasken or KoyekazrSn, "at the red willows." Terentief's son, Bazuk, is living there now. We found only a recent grave and ruins of a modern structure. Hrdlicka also mentions the place.38 It is said that a spot opposite Terentief's sta tion, on the east bank of the Yukon, was used as a big camping place during the king salmon run. It was called tldonidzit, "in the middle of the big bar," though it is actually on the mainland. Allen (1885) shows camps on both sides of the Yukon at this point. THE YUKON FROM NULATO TO BLACKBURN, INCLUDING THE KHOTOL RIVER (FIGURE 7) The Yukon from Nulato to Blackburn This stretch of the river, but more especially the hinterland along the Khotol River and Kaiyuh Slough, was the territory of the Indians now concentrated at Nulato and Kaltag. Ac cording to Jette, the massacre of the inhab itants of Nulato at the hands of the Koyukuk Indians was not due to the insult which the Koyukuk "chief," (or rather, shaman), felt that he had suffered at the hands of Lieutenant Barnard, as Dall suggests, nor because he was angry at the way the Russian commandant Derzhavin (Derabin) was treating his daugh ters, as Bancroft states, but was rather an ex pression of the traditional enmity existing be tween the Koyukuk and Nulato Indians.39 The English officer and the Russians were simply unlucky in being in the way. The Indians at Nulato told us the story of this massacre, as they had learned it from the sole survivor. In their minds, these events constituted the most remote history, beyond which no one could - hope to penetrate. The present settlement at Nulato (PL VI, 2) is called tlakist, (Jette: Tlakeyit, "arse of the point"), and lies just at the foot of the 38 Hrdli&amp;a, 1930a, p. 53. 39 Dall, 1870, pp. 48 fi\; Bancroft, 1890, pp. 572 ff.; The Tena lack chiefs, and their only leaders are shamans, as Jette" points out. rocky point on which the graveyard is located. The name, Nulato, is derived from the name of the former village, Nula79dox, "dog salmon place," (Jette: Nulator, "waiting for the blue back salmon"), about a mile below the present town. This was the Nulato visited by Dall and Whymper in 1867. There were three large winter houses here in 1851, at the time of the massacre. The Russian post, Fort Derabin, and the little settlement clustered about it, lay be tween nula73dox and the Nulato River. It was destroyed in the massacre and the place has been renamed dtktnl'tl t'hna', "in front of the hollow wood," (Jette: Tekenlul-tlena, "on the beach in front of empty coffins") be cause it is now so long since those who were killed in the massacre were buried here that the bodies have rotted in their coffins. Zagoskin marks the site of the Russian post on the Yukon just above the mouth of the Nulato River (HyjiaTo on the map), but Holmbergerro neously locates it some distance up the Nulato River away from the Yukon. Dall correctly indicates that the ruins of the fort were half a mile above the Nulato River and a mile and a furlong below "a small creek, a raging torrent in the spring, called Klat-kakhatne by the Indians, literally 'Stop-a-bit' River." Opposite the fort is an island, less than a mile long.40 The fourth settlement of the Nulato group was on the point, half a mile below the Nulato River, and was called nitbxadalodtn, "where the point runs out," (Jette: Nelenorodal'oten, "the place around the bend of the river.") It was inhabited in Russian times. Schwatka (1883) marks caches here. Six miles below the present Nulato, the only one now inhabited, is a former village called nikuLxqaGat, (Jette: Nikulerkakat), still marked by ruined cabins. This is probably the Kaiakak of Petroff's map (1880), and the vil lage noted by Schwatka (1883) and Allen (1885). Hrdlicka marks it as Khulikat on his map. This is also the place mentioned by Zagoskin as about 5 miles below the Russian post ("Nulato") as the "small village of Nulikata, called by the Russians 'shoman ovo,' " which was connected with the fort by a well-traveled trail. The names Nutulkakata and Hulikata seem to be applied by him to the same place.41 Zagoskin tells us that in the river opposite 40 Dall, 1870, pp. 46,49 f. 41 Zagoskin (1935), pp. 122,124, 213.</page><page sequence="60">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 53 II I I KOYUfuk\^r^j| I II I ii**'??.-.''"VT*ri'nti*t^F ^y ,11 j I ?'*'' ^ /^ "'"'"'V/* ^&amp;Jf/H U L A T O 0?.,, Il I 1 ~^^r "^T'V itey"*0" *Wov r' j I I I Upper Mloff.j&amp;r1"**"* **?p.---' '\"%S I ' *^4 v^?-" I x-v vo&lt;;.^L f#X ' \x | !

Both the village on the west bank and the houses on the island are marked on Schwatka's map (1883). However, there is some uncertainty whether the settle ment on the mainland was primarily a summer or a winter village. It is undoubtedly the village of xosaldl?ndtn, from xD*Un, "swift water," (Jette: Rosalentlenten, "where swift water hits the hill, passing around the point"). Holmberg renders it as Chogolthlinde. It is some 8 or 9 miles below Nulato. It was at this place that the Indians are said to have obtained clay for</page><page sequence="61">54 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 pots. The cut bank (PL VI, 4) exhibits a sec tion with a layer of blue clay 3 feet thick show ing above what was the water level at the time of our visit; above this is a layer of peat, 4-6 feet thick, topped by silt, making a total ex posure of 20 feet. A sample of clay was taken by Eardley for analysis. A village, Tatsenibanten, was some 18 miles below Nulato, according to Jette. This would place it a little above the mouth of the Kaiyuh Slough, and on the west bank of the Yukon. Dall also mentions "... a small village of two houses, on the left [east] bank of the river, nearly opposite Alikoff's barrabora [Jette's Tatsenibanten (?)], and being the residence of the old veteran Wolasatux [who escaped the Nulato massacre]. The village is known by his name." He further specifies that the village on the east bank is 14 miles below Nulato and 23 above the mouth of the Khotol, and his map shows it just above the mouth of the Kaiyuh Slough (P).42 It is probably the same place as the "summer village of Khogotlinde," which Hrdlicka marks on the east bank just below the mouth of the Kaiyuh Slough. The west bank village of Jette and Dall is probably the village mentioned by Zagoskin as about 17 miles above Kaltag River.43 None of these distances seem to have been measured very accurately. While they do not check with each other, yet they indicate that there were two settlements in the vicinity of the mouth of the Kaiyuh Slough, one on each side of the Yukon. Twenty-two miles below Nulato, on the west bank of the Yukon, is the site of nulwytt (Jette: Nuloyit, "at the end of the island"). It is now marked by a grassy clearing on a bench below a rocky bluff. Schwatka (1883) marks a village here, and one on the upper end of the island opposite. He also indicated "Tom's village" under the bluffs below the lower end of the island. On the east bank of the Yukon, opposite nulcoytt is the beginning of an old winter trail to a former village on the Khotol River, at Paul Esmailka's cabin. Thirty-eight miles below Nulato, or two miles above Kaltag, is the site of an abandoned village called nDdDydekentlit, (Jette: Nodo yitekentlit). There is now a summer camp here on the low silt bank, only 10 to 12 feet high, with a few graves on the higher ground behind 42 Dall, 1870, pp. 64, 282, fig. on p. 65 of "Wolasatux's barrabora." 48 Zagoskin (1935), p. 121. it. This is probably the "Upper Kaltag" of Petroff (1880). Hrdlicka's map notes the burials. The present village of Kaltag is properly called tDtli'btDnttn, (Jette: Totliletonten). It is situated on a silt bank, 12-15 feet high, which rises behind the village to a height of about 20 feet. While there may once have been signs of old house pits, these have been obliterated by recent buildings. Pottery fragments (35-21-50) were found in Mr. Muller's garden in front of his store, and on the path leading to the beach. We also found a broken planing adz blade (PL XI, 18) on the beach below the garden. Mr. Muller has a splitting adz which he found at a fish camp a quarter mile above his store. He told us that he had uncovered a skeleton in his garden but that the natives forced him to re bury it. Hrdlicka's detailed map shows a num ber of abandoned camps and village sites in the vicinity of Kaltag,44 but the site of the present village seems to be the only one occupied in pre Russian times. Petroff (1880) and Porter (1890) indicate an Upper and a Lower Kaltag (prob ably the small settlement 4 miles below the present village), but not the modern settle ment. It seems evident that the site of the present Kaltag was abandoned at an early date and was reoccupied only recently. Whymper says that he and Dall visited "Coltog" in 1867, but does not tell us exactly where it was except that it was somewhere on the west bank of the Yukon.45 There they "stopped in one of the largest underground houses we had ever seen; one inhabited by several families . . . [There] several of the Indians slept on shelves or benches built around the walls, and by this means four or five families were packed into one house." (Was this a kashim in which a large group of travelers were accommodated?) There were apparently two sites opposite Kal tag, one on the island at the mouth of Kaltag River, the other on the east bank of the Yukon opposite the present village. Jette gives the name Sanlaytor, "waiting for king salmon," to the camp on the island. Schwatka (1883) in dicates a village there. The natives told us that the recently abandoned village on the east bank of the Yukon was called x9XDldltnDtn (Jette's Roretlenten, "it flows following the bank"). This site is called Kahltog on Schwatka's map and Lower Kogotlinde on Hrdlicka's. However, 44 Hrdlicka, 1930a, Fig. 6. ? Whymper, 1869, p. 190; Dall, 1870, p. 41, "Kaltag."</page><page sequence="62">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 55 Zagoskin's map marks Xogoltlinde, XorojiTjinH^e, at the south end of the island. It was apparently an important village in his day. It had a kashim, and there he saw the natives taking a steam bath and using urine for soap.46 I believe that the village on the island was the original "Xogoltlinde," and that the name was trans ferred to the summer settlement farther up the Yukon which was frequented by Indians from the main village, and that still later the name was transferred to a newer village on the east bank of the Yukon, while the old site on the is land degenerated into the fishing camp of "Sanlaytor." Lower Kaltag, a settlement some 4 miles be low Kaltag, has given its name to the now more important village above. It is called qaltox (Jette's Kaltor, "camp for king salmon,"), and the same name is applied to a camp on the opposite (east) bank of the Yukon. The latter is Hrdlicka's "Old Kaltag Site." Lower Kaltag is on a flat between two creeks. In addition to the modern cabins and caches, there are several house pits, so overgrown as to suggest consid erable antiquity. According to the natives we met here, these "ancient" houses were made quite recently, and the builder of one is sup posed to be still living at Galena. I cite this as an example of the rapidity with which such semisubterranean houses fall into complete ruin. A white man's house is considered habit able for only twenty years in this climate. A sherd of native pottery (35-21-52) was found on the beach at Lower Kaltag. Now it is possible that I am in error when I identify the present "Lower Kaltag" with Jette's Kaltor. He specifies that the latter is only IJ miles below Kaltag, and while we did not measure the distance to the Lower Kaltag which we visited, the latter must have been about four miles. Since we did not see any signs of a recent village at the locality indicated by Jette, and since the Indians gave the name qaltox to Lower Kaltag, I assumed that Jette's estimate of distance was inaccurate. However, I ought to note that Zagoskin (1843) mentions a village Khhaltog-Chavichie, or Khhaltoga, one mile below Hogoltlinde.47 It is possible that we are dealing here with another case of a village shifting and taking its old name along with it. We also visited an abandoned site 1 mile be 46 Zagoskin (1935), pp. 116,124, 198, etc. Hogoltlinde or Nogolthnde in the translation. 47 Zagoskin (1935), pp. 120, 124. low our Lower Kaltag, also on the west side of the Yukon. There are several caches and one underground hut still standing (PL IV, 1). The four or five house pits also seem to be modern. A number measure only 6 by 9 feet, and must have been tiny hovels, degenerate forms of the old semisubterranean dwelling. We found nothing in the house pit we tested. Schwatka marks caches and graves here. Hrdlicka marks a site called Khatuotudze (Petroff's Khatnotutze, 1880) on the west bank of the Yukon, opposite the lower end of the island group above the mouth of the Khotol. This is either Jette's Karuihdokakat, aban doned since 1900 (?), or his Tekentlit, "river wards from the wood," which seems to have been about at this place. The mouth of the Khotol River is about 23 miles south of Kaltag. Hrdlicka has marked Khutulkakat here, but this is probably only a corruption for the native name of the river mouth. Petroff (1880) marks a Khutulkakat near St. Joe or Simon Creek, some miles farther down the river. We explored a flat by a small stream on the west bank of the Yukon, about 3 miles below the Khotol, but found only a re cently abandoned camp. Zagoskin mentions a Hutulkakat, which perhaps may have been in this vicinity, since all he says of it is that it is below Khhaltage (Lower Kaltag ?) and above a point some 17 miles above Tuttago.48 His map, however, gives simply the name for the Khotol, Xutulnayat, XyTyjiBHaHaTt, and does not indi cate any village there. Below this mysterious Hutulkakat, Zagoskin mentions Kakohgotna Creek, where the village of Kahatuk-Kamuk was located. It was aban doned after a smallpox epidemic which oc curred shortly after the first establishment of the Russian post at Nulato in 1833. The Indi ans, quite rightly, held the Russians responsible for this plague, and in retaliation burned down the trading post. It was rebuilt again in 1841. We were unable to identify the village of Kaha tuk-Kamuk, since Jette does not mention any place with a similar name, and Zagoskin says only that it was 17 miles above Tuttago, and was on a trail to Norton Sound.49 This would place it on the west bank of the Yukon, nearly opposite the mouth of the Khotol. Jette lists a Madzatetslihten 25 miles below Kaltag. 48 Op. tit., p. 214. 49 Ibid.</page><page sequence="63">56 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 A site suggested by Mr. Muller, at Stink Creek, on the west bank of the Yukon, some 30 miles below Kaltag, perhaps PetrofT's Tana hotkaiak and Hrdlicka's Khochaiak, proved to be modern. Hrdlicka marks "Ttutago" on the east bank of the Yukon, about 13 miles below Stink Creek. This is obviously Zagoskin's Tuttago or Ttu tago (TyTTaro on the map), which he locates on the left bank of the Yukon, among the willows. On the right bank, opposite, were a few summer and winter houses. The mouth of Tuttago River is a mile away from the main village.50 Holm berg follows Zagoskin's map in placing Tuttago on the east bank. We noticed two recently abandoned camps on the west side of the river below the rocky point, that is, across and downstream from Tuttago. Jette enumerates three camps and villages, all within 2 miles of each other, Fig. 8.?House, Blackburn Slough (Fig. 7). along this stretch. These are: Rotoroderekon ten, "down the slope the place has been burned"; Rotlolo'ontlit, "riverwards from the stone bluff"; and Lo'onkudilenten, "something dashes against stone." Schwatka (1883) marks graves, houses and a village in this locality. Hrdlicka notes Lofkas on the west bank of the Yukon, just below the upper end of Eagle Island. This is "Lofka's barrabora" deserted at the time of D all's visit in 1867. The latter indicates it at the mouth of the Yakutz-kala tenik River, and the map suggests that it was at Thurman's place, just above the mouth of Blackburn River.51 It is also roughly indicated on PetrofT's map (1880). It is probably the Sekudakakat of Jette. Mr. Muller also suggested a site on the west bank of the Yukon, just opposite the lower end of Eagle Island, but this also .proved to be modern. Hrdlicka marks a site at the mouth of Bis &amp;? Op. tit., pp. 216 f. si Dall, 1870, p. 211 and text fig. traia River. This is the stream now known as Blackburn River. Mr. Therman, who lives just above the stream mouth, has never found any thing in his garden, and the land below the creek is so low that it is constantly flooded. Mr. Therman's place is called Blackburn. At one time there was a trading post here. Schwat ka (1883) marks a village on the same side of the river, just above the rocky point, where Mr. Woods is now living. Jette reports the native name for Blackburn as Soltolten. Across the river there is a tributary and slough, called Blackburn Slough, or stslatna (Jette: Seslatno, "black bear is caught river"). The upper mouth of this slough is about two miles below the upper end of Blackburn Island. We were directed to a house pit on the north or west bank of this slough, on the right branch, some 8 miles above its mouth. It is opposite a small creek known as Sand Creek. The house pit is on the high silt bank, about 30 feet from the edge of the water. It measures 11 by 12 feet, with an entrance passage 12 feet long, leading northwest or away from the water, and entering one of the shorter sides (Fig. 8). The floor is from 18 to 24 inches below the surface of the ground. The contents of the house show it to have been inhabited after contact with the whites. The timbering of the roof was better preserved than that in any other house pit which we explored. The walls of the excavation were lined with a row of split posts, set close together. Just inside them was a retaining log, at the ground level. Two large roof beams ran from the back of the house to the front, one on each side of the entrance passage, which was 2\ feet wide. The fireplace was in the center of the house, and the smokehole was presumably between these two beams. The other logs form ing the roof ran from the side walls to these beams. No indications of posts supporting the roof were found, though it was probably like that of the Cook Inlet house.52 In this house we found: two whetstones (35-21-164 a, b); bone mouthpiece for a drill (PL XIV, 10); half of a wooden socket piece (PL XV, 21); bird bone tube (35-21-160); bone chisel (PL XVI, 21); wooden pin (35-21-161); wooden pin with tang (35-21-163 b); wooden shovel (35-21-189); cut bone fragments (35-21 162 a-c); block of cut wood (35-21-163 c); and potsherds (Fig. 26, 14). 62 de Laguna, 1934, Fig. 5.</page><page sequence="64">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 57 Other depressions near this house proved to be natural bog pits. The Khotol River and Kaiyuh Slough {Figure 9) Father Jette has written of the country traversed by this river system as follows: The Kayar region [is] a stretch of country consisting mainly of alluvial plains, lying between the Yukon main land and the Kayar mts., about 60 mi. long and varying j?^^7 \Green Water C* \S \ \ L?\\&lt;jSKr 7k&gt;tl temp l.jQ ^ Y^^ OQ^**'' BlocK bear Mr, 4,^ I I aTo^V'?

Fig. 9.?The Khotol River and Kaiyuh Slough. in breadth from 20 to 30 miles, intersected by numerous lakes and streams. It was formerly the habitat of a nu merous tribe, described by the early explorers as the Kayar Indians. These, considerably reduced in numbers have migrated to the Yukon, and constitute the main part of the Yukon villages from Nulato to Soltolten (Blackburn), a distance of about 130 miles. Kayar is still for them a spring and autumn resort and hunting ground. They refer to it, when on the Yukon, as being situated "up": "yutoko kayar," "up to Kayar," "up in Kayar," "up to the lakes," etc. The Kayar mountains limit this region to the SE, the most prominent among them being Rotoldela. The main stream of the region is the Rotolno, called Kaiyuh river. It is joined 75 miles above its mouth by a slough from the Yukon. This slough traverses the Kayar region and the whole length of it is designated as Kayar slough, the name of Rotolno being reserved to the river above its confluence with the slough. The natives however consider the lower part of the slough, below the confluence with the river, as the continuation of this stream, they keep to it the name of Rotolno, and its lower end, where it joins the Yukon, they call Rotolkakat. In this report we follow the native method of designation, since it is comparable to that ap plied to the Innoko River and Shageluk Slough system, using, however, the common rendering of the native names, "Khotol" and "Kaiyuh." Jette lists three out of many trails to the Kaiyuh region: one starting about 4 miles below Nulato, the second starting 8 miles below Nulato, and the third and shortest leaving the Yukon 22 miles below the town. With the exception of the map compiled by Father Jette from the natives' accounts, which Father McElmeel kindly allowed us to copy, and a map drawn for us by Francis McGinty, our Indian guide from Nulato, we had no map of the region. We ascended the Khotol River from its mouth 23 miles below Nulato, to Yukon Willow Creek, some 5 or 6 miles above the Forks or confluence of the Khotol with the Kaiyuh Slough. We returned to the Yukon by ascending the Kaiyuh Slough to its mouth,</page><page sequence="65">58 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 about 19 miles above Kaltag. The entire dis tance was mapped in a Brunton-time traverse by Dr. Eardley and Mr. Gorton. We attempted to identify all the villages and camps marked by Jette on his sketch map, adding a few that were known to Francis. A number of these sites were explored, but with one exception they all proved to have been inhabited only within recent times. Listing them in order upstream from the mouth, they are: 1. niltsatatcoDtn, "the place where the water splits," on the second fork above the mouth. It is on the Yukon side of the river, but is not visible from the main channel. 2. Old Fish Camp, tloG3qaiyax (Jette Loke kayar, "old camp" or "fish camp"), is a large site containing at least 40 house pits. It is on the Yukon side of the river, on the lower side of the bend on which the river approaches the rocky hills to the east for the fourth time (as one ascends). The house pits are on the second terrace, about 21 feet above the water. This site is so important that a full description is reserved for a special section. It seems to be Hrdlicka's Klenkakaiyuh.53 3. xatsu*lstiDtn, at the mouth of Fall Camps Lake (a translation of the native name) on the Yukon side of the river, seems to be a modern camping place. 4. "Inland Bend," yutoGonoDalDhnDin (Jette: Yutokonodaldelenten, "where the river takes a turn to the inland"), is a site with two mod ern house pits, on the Yukon side of the river, about \ mile below the mouth of Yukon Creek. One house has been partly washed away, only the rear wall, about 10 or 12 feet long, remaining. The second house pit is 12 by 15 feet, with the timbering of the tunnel pre served. The tunnel is about 2\ feet wide, and 2\ feet high. Every 8 inches there is a pair of upright posts, supporting a cross beam. These cross beams in turn support two longitudinal poles, running the length of the tunnel (cf. Fig. 6). In the first house we found a grooved whetstone (PL XIII, 11), a bird arrowhead (PL XV, 7), a wooden net float (PL XVI, 14), and a broken iron ax head. The timbers of both houses had been shaped with a steel ax. 5. tsu70thi7qaGat is the name of a former village, on both sides of the mouth of Tsurot lurna Slough, which enters the Khotol from the Yukon side. 6. latsqoqat (Jette: Latskokat, "on the sur ? Hrdlicka, 1930a, p. 54. face of the ground," i.e., a clearing or open space) was a village on both sides of the mouth of the slough of the same name, which we have translated as Ground Surface Slough. It enters the Khotol from the Yukon side, draining a small lake, about | mile from the river. Paul Esmailka has a winter cabin here (PL IV, 4, 5). Numbering from up the slough, towards its mouth, the houses are: Houses 1-4 on the up river side, between Esmailka's cabin and the lake; Houses 5 and 6 on the point opposite; and House 7 on the Khotol, above Esmailka's cabin. These pits were all measured and sketched, but do not seem interesting enough to merit a complete description. In House 5 we found a piece of tin and a wooden net float (PL XVI, 16). In House 7 we found fragments of the stitched birch bark roof, much rotted grass matting, a fresh-water mussel shell, and a white glass bead (35-21-127). 7. tsuc|ustati-t, "eddy," is said to have been a big town, surrounded by a fence, on the inland side of the Khotol, just above the mouth of Eddy Creek. We did not explore this site, since Francis McGinty told us that it was modern. 8. atfo7it was a village about 3 miles up Canoe Portage Creek, where Paul Esmailka has another cabin. We did not visit it. 9. nitlqa7aDlaDtn is two miles farther up the same creek, and the site is also marked by a trapping cabin. 10. tuzniDaxDin, "forced into the water," so named because a giant loon on a near-by lake used to tear up the people's bark canoes and drown them. It is on the inland side of the river, less than a mile above the Forks where the Kaiyuh Slough mingles its muddy gray waters with the transparent brown water of the Khotol. This village site has two house pits and a log fort, like that at Kateel. The fort is said to have been built after the Nulato massacre as a place of refuge from the Koyukuk Indians. Near one of the houses we saw a modern coffin, lying on the ground. No digging or mapping was attempted here. 11. Spring Camp, nitlqaDOGaDaDUn Dtnx6tsato'tsttit, is a camping place on the inland side of the river, about a mile above the Fort. It is on a portage to a lake. In the up river side of the portage, near the lake shore, is a ridge of high ground, with four house pits. The best preserved, House 1, measures 11 by 9 feet, with the entrance in the longer side. In it we found the bone inset for the mouthpiece</page><page sequence="66">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 59 of a drill (PL XIV, 9), a worked bone (PL XVI, 7), and a piece of a birch bark basket (35-21 134) of the same general type as that illustrated in Plate II, 4, but more crudely made. The tim bers showed the marks of a steel ax. Probably none of the houses here are prehistoric. 12. Da7atlnuqacat, "the mouth of Cotton wood Creek," is a site on the Yukon side, across from and just above the mouth of Bonanza Creek. Graves on the opposite bank of the Khotol suggest that it was recently occupied. 13. tlitsataniloDc11, is said to be an old site, about 4 miles up Bonanza Creek, where there is a modern cabin. 14. mcjaosa, is farther up, on the left branch of the same creek, just above another cabin. 15. Yukon Willow Creek, yuqancpibx, "among the Yukon willows," is a site on the inland side of the Khotol, just above the mouth of Yukon Willow Creek (Fig. 10). Houses 1 and 2, measuring 10X12 and 12X14 feet, re spectively, stand on an isolated knoll in swampy ground. The remaining houses are on a slightly 1 v^&gt; ? I I . ' / /; %\ Swamp. j / -&gt; ^ .

The houses, 3, 4, 6, and 7, measure about 10X10 to 12X14 feet, with the entrance passages facing either the river or Yukon Willow Creek. The kashim (House 5), measures 19X20 feet, with a 9-foot entrance tunnel entering the shorter side to wards the creek. The pit had been excavated to a depth of 3| feet. We were able to uncover only a small portion of the roof (Fig. 11), be cause of the large willows growing in the back part of the pit. A chip of wood from the floor, with marks of a steel ax, show that the house was not old. There seem to have been two levels of roof logs, with a layer of grass between them. /.x j : I ' ij Fig. 11.?Kashim, Yukon Willow Creek (Fig. 9). House 6 was partly excavated and yielded a whetstone (PL XIII, 5), a stone netweight (35-21-147), two wedge points (PL XVI, 24, and 35-21-139 b), a decorated bone awl (PL XIV, 22; Fig. 25, 5), a decorated bird bone tube (PL XIV, 41; Fig. 25, 6), a bone pendant (PL XIV, 37), an ornamental bone buckle (PL XIV, 33), four pieces of worked bone (35-21 138 a-d), two blue glass beads (35-21-141), potsherds (35-21-142), part of a wooden top (35-12-143), fragments of birch bark basket and of the bark roof (35-21-145). The house itself measured 11X12 feet with a 12?-foot tunnel entering one of the longer sides. The roof seems to have had a double ridgepole. House 7 was explored but yielded nothing except a human skull in one corner (35-21-149). Sites on the Kaiyuh Slough are listed from the Forks to the mouth on the Yukon: 1. takudzaDalDathx11 (Jette: Tarkudzatole datlten, "place where the minks went up"), is supposed to have been a village site or camp on the north side of the Kaiyuh Slough, on both sides of the mouth of Mink Creek.

We found no trace of a settlement here. 3. Jette mentions a camp called Kotseteyit, "portage," across from the mouth of Pike Trap Creek, and another camp at Tasezron, White fish Lake. Francis McGinty did not think that any of the sites on the slough were very old. Dall visited a settlement somewhere on the Khotol River or Kaiyuh Slough, which he calls "Tekunka's barrabora." He also visited a second place above it called "Jearny's barra bora." Here "there was only one Indian house and two caches. The building over the entrance to the house was large, square, strongly built of heavy logs, and pierced for musketry." It was evidently a fort-like antechamber.54 We were unable to identify these places, unless the second was the Fort just above the Forks. They are shown on his map on the inland (east) side of the Khotol. Old Fish Camp The Old Fish Camp (Fig. 12, PL VI, 3) is probably the most important site discovered in the course of our investigations. The large clearing which it occupies is clearly visible from the river. There is a lower terrace along the water, 8 to 12 feet high, with a few poles, the remains of fish racks or caches, still stand ing. The old house pits are strung out along the top or slope of the second terrace, 21 feet above the water. They cover an area 740 feet east and west, by 200 feet north and south. The chief reason for exploring this site was because the extraordinary lamp with human figure in the bowl,65 now in the museum of the University of Alaska, was picked up on a bar in the Khotol about half a mile below the site. Whether it was actually washed out of the village we have no means of knowing. When we visited the place, no such bar was visible, and the river was not cutting into the village site, but it may have done so, of course, at some stage of flood. We located some forty-odd house pits at the Old Fish Camp, but there may have been more which we overlooked in the high grass or in the thickets of willow. All that we found were measured and sketched. Figure 13 indicates the shape and dimensions of some of them, as far 54 Dall, 1870, pp. 175 f. 55 de Laguna; 1934, PL 71, pp. 177 ff., erroneously pub lished as having been found at Kaltag. as could be determined without careful exca vation. Most of the houses faced the water (south), but Houses 17, 20, 22, 31, 36 and 40 faced inland. House 32 faced east, or upstream. It will be noticed that practically no pit is sym metrical. This may be because the builders measured only by eye, or because the slumping of the roof and walls has given an appearance of irregularity. In general, these depressions are now about 18 inches deep, with House 35, as the shallowest, barely 6 inches deep. The kashim, House 19, is both the largest and the deepest pit. It measures 18X17 feet, ^P^V t(]\ /(?31 Mi?il } n * /H&gt; *L* H 4 ft "sHP^i 31 f * k *U\-k s/ / % s \ s ^?\ r\iii^ || 8 j; (I 3^|(( ii rf t!A h/ ?p^% ^. f 'finirii^^^ i ( 11 / 11 =33 / /^""^^ 'ill/ k/Aj tili ^^^ Fig. 13.?Plans of Houses at Old Fish Camp. with a tunnel 15 feet long. It is now 3 feet 4 inches deep; a still deeper pit in the middle, which was filled with water at the time of our visit, was probably the fire pit, which could be covered over during ceremonies. The majority of the dwelling houses require no particular description. The smallest are Houses 18 and 28, measuring roughly 9X11 and 9X10 feet respectively. The largest, ex clusive of the kashim, and not including the small additions found on several houses, are Houses 29 and 31. These measure roughly 13X14 feet 6 inches, and 13X15 feet. House 29 is unusual in having the tunnel enter through the southeast corner rather than in the mid</page><page sequence="69">62 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 die of the wall. It also seems to have had a small cupboard or alcove added to the west wall near the northwest corner. House 8 had two similar additions on the north wall, and the entrance seems to have been through the southwest corner, though the pit is too indis tinct for us to be sure. The longest tunnel was found on House 11 and measured 18 feet 6 inches. The shortest tunnel, 7 feet long, was on House 38. Houses 14 and 15 are interesting because the former opens into the latter and seems to lack an outside door of its own. House 35 is con nected with a small room on the south by a short tunnel only 3 feet 6 inches long. This small room, which is probably the entrance porch or antichamber is about 6| feet square. House 9 is connected by a long crooked tunnel with a pair of indefinite pits. These may be the remains of an older house, already in ruins when House 9 was built, or they may be some structure connected with House 9. Both House 1 and House 7 are connected by short tunnels with antechambers of some kind. That associ ated with the first was probably destroyed when House 2 was built. House 4 is a curious struc ture. The front half, if it can be considered part of the house, consists of a raised platform through which the tunnel has been cut. This platform is probably the torltal, or sleeping place for the children (cf. Fig. 21). Since, according to Jette, this platform, divided by the prolongation into the house of the roofless walls of the tunnel, was a regular feature of the Indian winter dwelling, it is surprising that we did not find it in any other house besides this particular one. In addition to the houses, there were scat tered through the village a great many smaller excavations, some of which are indicated on the map. We probably missed a great many more, since they were hidden by waist-high grass, and most of those which we found were only discovered after we had fallen into them. The whole surface of the ground was so cut up by pits and house walls that it was almost im possible to walk through the site until we had trampled down a path. These small pits are from 2 or 3 feet square, up to holes 3 by 8 feet. These longer excavations may represent simply the digging together of several contiguous holes. Because the water which collects in the bottom prevents the growth of grass, these pits are still from 2 to 3 feet deep. They were probably used for storing salmon eggs or frozen meat. It seems almost certain that all of the houses found at this site were not inhabited at the same time. Not only are some much better preserved than the others, but the small col lection obtained from the site shows that the period of occupation extended from prehistoric times to the period of contact with the Rus sians. It is not established whether this contact was direct or indirect. Moreover, if each of the forty houses were occupied by two families, say ten persons, this would indicate a popula tion of 400 people, and even if we cut this figure in half, it would be pretty large for a single village. According to Zagoskin's census of 1843, quoted by Hrdlicka, only 264 persons were counted for the Kaiyuhkhotana (Zago skin's "Inkiliks proper"), but as Hrdlicka points out, smallpox had already visited the settlements on the Yukon.56 We cannot even be sure that the period of occupation of the site was continuous. The Indians in recent years have been shifting their villages con stantly, and anything from an epidemic to the death by starvation of a white trapper at a summer camping place is enough to make them shun the site for fear of bad luck. Archaeological and historical evidence shows that such move ments were common in the past. As we found in the case of Kaltag, the natives may reoccupy a site after a lapse of time, probably when the original incident which caused them to aban don it has been forgotten. Such an abandon ment and reoccupation may have taken place at the Old Fish Camp. The Indians no longer camp there, Francis McGinty told us, because they do not like their children to fall into the old house pits. Certainly, it is all too easy to do so, as we ourselves experienced, but we were unable to discover whether the reason given by the Indians was merely common sense parental solicitude or superstitious fear. The modern "New Fish Camp" is at the mouth of a slough, some distance above the old site. An attempt was made to excavate three house pits, Houses 8 and 12 near the eastern end, and House 33 near the western end of the village. The frozen ground, however, prevented the completion of this work during our limited stay. House 8 was an indefinite pit, of which only the back (north) and west walls could be measured. These were 10 and 15 feet long, ? Hrdlicka, 1930a, pp. 131 f.</page><page sequence="70">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 63 respectively. There seem to have been two rectangular projections or alcoves on the back wall, and the entrance was in the south wall, possibly at the southwest corner. However, the pit seems to have been disturbed by later digging, so that we cannot be sure of the original shape. Charcoal, charred wood, fire-cracked rocks and ashes were found all over the roof. The turf here was about 18 or 20 inches thick, which includes both the original covering of the roof and later accumulations in the pit. The original floor level could not be reached, and no hearth was uncovered. All the specimens found, therefore, came from above the floor, and may have been thrown into the ruined pit later, and may not be possessions left behind by the original occupants. Objects from House 8 are: four whetstones (35-21-106 and -107 a-c); stone saw or scraper (PL XIII, 2); obsidian arrowhead (PL XIV, 2); obsidian blade (PL XIV, 3); slate knife blade (35-21-110); hammerstone (35-21-112); peb bles for netweights and smoothing pottery (35-21-111 a-c)', two double-handled bone scrapers (PL XV, 27, and 35-21-98 b); nine bone skinning tools or scrapers (PL XV, 28-30, and 35-21-96 a-f); decorated scapula scraper (PL XV, 25; Fig. 24, 1); two wooden net floats (PL XVI, 15, 17); five antler wedges (PL XVI, 26, 28, 32, and 35-21-93 a, b); wooden handle (?) (35-21-101, cf. PL XVI, 2); bone carving of a mouse (PL XIV, 40); cut bone and antler fragments (35-21-94 a-c); sewn birch bark fragments (35-21-102); and potsherds (Fig. 26, 7; Fig. 27, 1; Fig. 31, 9). House 12 faced the water, with the front and back walls measuring 12| feet, the side walls, llf feet. The tunnel was 3 feet wide and 13J feet long, entering a little to the west of the middle of the front wall. The turf over the pit was 6 inches thick; below it were about 6 inches of humus. The floor of the house was reached only along the front wall. Traces of the hearth were found in the center. Only a few timbers of the roof were found. There were retaining stakes along the walls, and a hori zontal beam along the west wall. Beams ran from the four corners towards the center. Probably the roof was pyramidal in shape, like that of House 4 at Kateel. The most interesting feature of this house were the two burials, one in the southwest corner (PL VII, 1, 2), the other in the north east corner. Because of the frost, only the first (35-21-88) could be removed. The second was carefully covered up, with the hope that we might be able to excavate it properly at some future time. Only enough of it could be uncovered for us to determine that this burial was probably similar to the first. According to Dr. Dorothy Cross, who examined the bones, the skeleton which we removed is that of an adult male. A shallow grave, only 7 inches deep, 2\ feet long and 2 feet wide, had been dug below the house floor, parallel to the front wall, and 2 feet from it. The body was flexed, lying on the left side, with head to the west. The knees were drawn up to the chest, over the bent arms, with the heels at the pelvis. The left hand lay in front of the face; the right hand was bent back sharply against the wrist, and the head was bent forward. The body had been wrapped in two twined grass mats. The matting next the body (PL XIX, 3 and PL XX, 2) was rather coarse, with the long strands running around the body. The outer mat (PL XIX, 1, 2; PL XX, 1) was somewhat finer, and was wrapped in the opposite direction. On top of this was a shroud of birchbark. A good deal of the skin and muscle was preserved by the frost, and this was saved, though the bones had to be cleaned for shipment. The grave was covered over by a 6-inch layer of sand, though the rotting of the body had caused this to slump into the grave. No artifacts ac companied the burial. There is some evidence to suggest that the house had burned down on top of the grave. We assume that both inter ments were made at the same time, and that the house was subsequently abandoned. It may have been intentionally fired. This method of burial contrasts with that usually practiced by the Indians in historic times. In House 12 we found the following objects: single-ended splitting adz (PL X, 1); four whetstones (35-21-76 c, -77, -78, and -83); two grinding stones (PL XIII, 15, 16); stone scraper (35-21-68); boulder chip used as a scraper (35-21-73); obsidian chips and frag ments (35-21-86 a-e); four slate ulo blades (PL XIII, 9, 10, and 35-21-70, -71); double-edged slate knife blade (PL XIV, 16); slate blade with dull edge (35-21-72); bird arrowhead (PL XV, 5); three bone barbs for fish hooks (PL XIV, 34, 35, and 35-21-59, b); decorated awl (PL XIV, 23; Fig. 25, 4); plain bone awl (PL XIV, 32); bone nail (35-21-57); three legbone scrapers or skinning tools (35-21-65 a-c); decorated scapula scraper (PL XV, 26; Fig. 24, 2); plain scapula scraper (35-21-64); decorated</page><page sequence="71">64 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 bone scraper ?

House 33 faced the river, and measured 11| feet at the front, and 12J feet at the side. The tunnel was 2\ feet wide and 15 feet long. The only beams observed ran from the back wall to the center of the house. Over these was a layer of bark, and on top of the roof was a bed of ashes, showing that the site had been reoccupied, perhaps for a camp, after the roof had fallen in. Most of the specimens, including the glass bead, came from the level of the roof, and may have dated from this later occupation, though the roof itself was not well enough pre served for us to be able to determine the rela tionship of the finds. We were able to excavate a very small part of the house. The specimens from House 33 are: hammer head (PL X, 7); two whetstones (35-21-124 a, b); triangular slate weapon blade (PL XIV, 13); greenstone drill point (PL XIV, 19); slate drill point (PL XIV, 20); antler knife handle (PL XIV, 44); bone awl (35-21-114); barbed point (35-21-115); point of ice pick (35-21 116); bone shaft fragment (35-21-118); five fragments of worked bone and antler (35-21 117 a-e); potsherds (35-21-119); Cook type blue glass bead (35-21-120). THE YUKON FROM BLACKBURN TO BONASILA, INCLUDING THE INNOKO RIVER (FIGURE 14) The Yukon from Blackburn to Bonasila About 10 miles below Blackburn, on the west bank of the river, is the abandoned vil lage of St. Joe. This is probably the "small vil lage" of Hrdlicka's map. A short distance below this, also on the west side of the Yukon, and about 12 miles above the mouth of Shageluk-Thompson Slough, is a modern Indian camp at the mouth of Simon Creek (PL VI, 6). It is occupied by Indians from Hologochaket on the Innoko, who come there in summer to put up salmon. They told us that there was an old site north of the stream, which they call takaxa, "slough." Either St. Joe or Simon Creek is probably Petrofl's Khutulkakat, unless he has simply misplaced the name for the mouth of the Khotol, and one of the two is the village marked by Schwatka (1883). Petroff also indi cated Kvikhagamute near the upper end of a large island above the mouth of the slough, and Nunakhtagamute, also on the west bank, opposite the mouth of the slough. They were probably only fishing camps, and the names given were undoubtedly supplied by an Eskimo guide. They are certainly not Athabaskan Indian names.</page><page sequence="72">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 65 Zagoskin often mentions a village (or vil lages ?) called Wagichagat. His map indicates Vazhichagat, BaHcnnaraT-L, on the east bank of Yukon just above the mouth of Thompson the Shageluk Slough connecting the Yukon with the Innoko. Whymper also mentions the vil lage of Shagelook on the Yukon opposite the mouth of "Shagelook River," i.e., the slough.57 Whether one or two villages, the settlement here must have been very important, because Zagoskin tells us that even after an attack by the Khotol Indians who are supposed to have killed the best "merchants" among them, the settlement in 1843 still had a population of a hundred.58 Holmberg's map indicates Washit schagath in the same place as Zagoskin's. At Hall's Rapids, locally known as Anvik Rapids, the Indians used to get clay for pots and red paint, according to our native inform ants. The deposit was on the west bank of the Yukon. Zagoskin writes: The gravel of this beach changes from Wagichagat from sandy layers to clay. On certain cliffs the natives pick a bloodstone [hematite?] and from others a soft mud or slime oozing with clean ochre mud of different kinds of shades, as: dark red-purple, brick, yellow, tan and white; the third one contains hard layers, which come down perpendicular with the river. The bloodstone is transmitted to the Unna'-ka tribes [Innoko Indians] and farther on to the Kvihpak. For a small ball of bloodstone, in two inches of diameter, some times is exchanged one beaver of second quality. It is the price of Nulato.59 The clay at Hall's Rapids is yellow bentonite, not the blue clay noted 9 miles below Nulato, and at other places. However, blue clay does occur on the west bank of the Yukon opposite the middle of the big island above the rapids. This may be Hrdlicka's "old site." We visited what we thought was the place indicated, and found nothing but modern refuse in the bank, below a recently abandoned fishing camp. About | mile above the small stream at Hall's Rapids there is a village site, marked by Mr. Gene Holiday's old cabin. He told us that his garden is on the site of the old kashim. We saw four pits at this place which may have been houses. The river has cut through a fifth and in this we found a fragment of a barbed slate blade (35-21-168) five fragments of worked jasper (35-21-169) and some potsherds (35-21-170). Jette gives the name Tlanedilinten 67 Whymper, 1869, pp. 264 f. 58 Zagoskin (1935), pp. 218 ff. He also writes of "Wagich agat village on Makaslat, as they call it." Is this a typo graphical error for "or Makaslat?" *9 Op.tit.,p.222 to Hall's Rapids. Dall renders it as Klan-ti-lin ten, "rocks and strong water."60 Schwatka (1883) indicates a village here. Mr. Ed Robinson, who lives on the west bank of the Yukon, 4 miles below Hall's Rapids and 3 miles above Grayling River, built his house on the ruins of an old kashim. He said that the timbers in the pit looked as if they had been chewed off by beavers, an apt description for stone-cut logs. In the pit he found a clay lamp, unfortunately since lost. He said that the Indians told him that this site was older than Old Grayling (a recently aban doned village). There are two sites at the mouth of Grayling River. Jette gives the name Maadzikakat, "amulet river mouth" to the settlement of his day, and identifies it as Dos-brats and "Sha man's village" of earlier writers. On the 25 to 30-foot terrace, \ mile south of the river mouth is an abandoned village known as Old Grayling. It consists of a number of quite modern house pits and the ruins of a kashim similar to that seen at Hologochaket. The site has been cut into little knolls by small ravines. Just below the Indian houses are the remains of a recently abandoned cabin. Hrdlicka obtained a skeleton here in 1929.61 Muller found an adz blade here. Curiously enough, the older settlement was at the site about \ mile above the river, mis named New Grayling, because it was re occupied about thirty-five years ago, after Old Grayling had been abandoned. Recently aban doned structures mark both ends of the older site (PL VIII, 1; Fig. 15). Along the top of the 18- to 25-foot terrace, between the Yukon and the meandering Grayling River, are thirteen or fourteen house pits. These are so much overgrown as to be difficult to measure, many are quite indefinite in shape, and seem to be prehistoric. The site is now a grassy clearing, interspersed with clumps of trees and saplings, and screened from the river by a growth of young willows. The pits at present range in size from 6 to 15 feet square, the size probably depending more on the way in which the pit has filled up, than on its original dimensions. Though measurements were taken of the more clearly discernible excavations, it seems un necessary to enumerate them here. House 13 was the only one which we ex plored. This was an indefinitely shaped depres 60 Dall, 1870, p. 215 and fig. opposite. 81Hrdli?ka 1930a, p. 58.</page><page sequence="73">66 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 4- % 1 [so * 11 \ t ^\\ V&gt;~7i Old cobi* a-*?x (v v&gt; I \W &lt;Ji 1 I ABOUT tOOo'TO (i- WI - CmAYUNG RtVfrft /J /J j X / J /f / / .Sr f / v^w / ?

The center of the de pression was from 1J to 2J feet below the level of the slightly raised walls. The pit itself con tained about 3 feet of accumulated earth, much of which seems to have been silt washed in during floods. It was impossible to determine the exact size of the house, the timbering of the roof, or even the direction in which the sup posed entrance tunnel ran. The upper layer of earth, above the roof, extended over and be yond the walls of the pit. It contained many beach pebbles, undoubtedly brought here for some purpose, and the remains of two large pots (PL XXIII, 1, 3). Below this was a band of charcoal containing potsherds and other specimens. Below this again, resting directly on the bark roof was a layer of flood silt, inter spersed with charcoal. One had the impression that the material from above the roof had been thrown here after the collapse of the house, when the pit was used for refuse. The interior of the pit below the roof was filled with mud and silt. The floor was littered with wood shavings and reddish ash from the central fireplace. In the earth above the roof we found: two whetstones (35-21-185 a, b); unworked pebble used as a netweight (35-21-186 a); two agate pebbles and one jasper pebble broken in two (35-21-186 b, c, e); chert chip (35-21-186/); slate lance blade with tang (PL XIV, 11); slate blade fragment (35-21-186 d); decorated scapula scraper (35-21-183); two pots and potsherds (PL XXIII, 1, 3). On the floor of the house were the following: three whetstones (35-21-179 a-c); stone saw (PL XIII, 1); three slate blade fragments (PL XIV, 18, and 35-21-177 b, c); agate pebble broken in two (35-21-181); lump of hematite scraped for paint (PL XIV, 8); toggle harpoon head (PL XV, 4); harpoon foreshaft ? (PL XV, 3); three bone and antler awls (PL XIV, 25, 26; and 35-21-174 b); two bone scrapers or skinning tools (35-21-175 a, b); fragment of ice pick (35-21-175 c); cut animal bone (35-21-175 d); wooden handle (?) (PL XVI, 2); and potsherds (PL XXIV, 1; Fig. 31, 1, 4). A broken splitting adz (PL X, 5), was found on the beach about 1| or If miles above the mouth of Grayling River, that is, about a mile above the site. The adz lay just below a recent camping place. It had probably been found at the old site, been carried to the camp, and lost there. The present settlement at Anvik is located on both sides of the mouth of Anvik River (PL VIII, 2). Jette gives the name Kedzolkakat, "mouth of the deerskin legging river," to the place. The village has actually been shifted several times in recent years. The Anvik of 1880 was located on the narrow neck of land which formerly divided the Anvik River from the Yukon. In 1935 this had been cut to a knife edge of bank, about 22 feet high, and it was the encroachments of the Anvik River which earlier had forced the abandonment of the site. Since our visit the river has actually broken through to the Yukon, leaving the lower point of the mainland as an island, between an upper and a lower mouth. The Anvik of 1880 is called Anvik Old Station, or gacax9neledtn, "where the old station (trading post) stood." We visited the spot but found only a 3-foot deposit of modern refuse. On the point, just above the original (1935) mouth of the river, is the mod ern Indian settlement which I have called Anvik Point (PL VIII, 3), to distinguish it from the settlement grouped about the Episcopal Mission on the lower side of Anvik River. The settlement about the Mission and the store is called g9tru77&lt;?tca-q. A clearing on the same side, just above the present houses, marks the site of a former village, called Old Anvik, or &lt;?atcint'o&gt;t, "at the foot of the rocks." This was not prehistoric, however. To further com plicate matters, there is now a new village called Lower Anvik, located just below Hawk Bluff, established by natives who fled from the parent settlement during the influenza epi demic of 1927. Zagoskin (1843) gives the name Anvig to the settlement on Anvik Point, clearly describing its location, with the additional information that the place gets flooded every spring. He also mentions a smaller, subsidiary village on the west bank, one and a half miles below Anvik River. (Does this mean that there was formerly a Lower Anvik, which was abandoned for a time and then re-occupied ?) The population of these two villages totaled 120 persons.62 Holmberg's Anwig is marked at the present site of Anvik Mission. Dall (1867) writes: "Anvik is a large village, of some ten or twelve houses, each of which may contain twenty in habitants."63 It is marked on his map just above the mouth of Anvik River, but the map 62 Zagoskin (1935), pp. 222 f. 63 Dall, 1870, p. 217.</page><page sequence="75">68 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 is too crude to indicate whether the site is that of Anvik Point or Anvik Old Station. Anvik Point is the only site in the group which can make any claim to age. It is called n'tccolwtcrt, "on the point," or tlcogaqayexatlcot, "the old village." Com pare this last name with that for the Old Fish Camp. Schwatka (1883) indicates a village here. There are two terraces (Fig. 16), the ! t ANVIK POINT VILLAQ&amp; i ? O- ? MOUSE- PITS ? % ?

Both the present houses and the abandoned house pits are scattered along the brink of the higher terrace. The cabins oc cupied at the time of our visit are all grouped close to the bank of the Yukon, although they face the Anvik River. The pits of the older houses range along the terrace for a distance of 600 feet or more from the Yukon. Those in the front row, nearest the modern cabins, are said to be only fifty years old. One large kashim in this group was actually in use during the memory of one of the older men in the settle ment. The pits in back are probably older, for the finds made along the Yukon beach in dicate that there was a prehistoric settlement here. This rear line of houses with its accom panying midden runs out to the Yukon bank at Evan's garden. There are about 35 house pits in the group, and two kashims besides the one already mentioned. A recent burial was exposed in the cut bank at Evan's garden (PL VIII, 4), and permission was obtained to remove the skull and a few objects near it. Because of the garden above, the rest of the skeleton could not be disturbed. Adhering to the skull (35-21-272) were frag ments of birch bark wrappings and grass mat ting (35-21-275), showing that the body had been wrapped in these for burial like the skele ton found in House 12, Old Fish Camp. Beside the skull were a birch bark box (PL XVI, 3), a small pottery lamp (PL XXII, 4; Fig. 32, 1), and glass beads (35-21-277). In the earth about the skull were fragments of native pot tery (Fig. 28, 4) and china. A number of specimens were picked up on the beach of the Yukon below the garden, and a small collection which had also been gathered here was purchased from the trader and the natives. These are: double-ended splitting adz (PL X, 4); single-ended splitting adz (PL X, 2); pick-like adz or chisel (PL XI, 4); planing</page><page sequence="76">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 69 -jj-?, M fl fff 51T&amp; fLtVtN MILES a ^y/ //U up anvik Riven ^3 b / / T %u-I i ifi / /' 3 to loo* |errac?f &lt; // \^/ / I v^* t&gt;? &gt;^ \* I Fig. 17.?Site Eleven Miles up Anvik River (Fig. 14).</page><page sequence="77">o ^^y^^^yyIV \\VX_^^^^^^^^^ Timbcv covered, mils 500- 80O feet Kt3K Ill\ ^?^^^^^^^^^--^-^^vXv 0LD B0MA5ILA 91 \V ^*^^&gt;&gt;s^ ^? **^\\\\\\V 9 Houst and Kash\wi pU* ftl \l^i\ ^**~~*****^ """"^\\\\ \S^ * Ruined. caJoins ? ^^ ^/&lt;i ll^l \ ^~^\.\\\\\\YS.

About 11 miles up the Anvik River (PL 1,1), on what is now a side channel of the river, there is an abandoned village site, called fladeflcp'cde, "red stone village." It was aban doned in 1898, but while some of the house pits date from this period, others seem to be older. Ralph Jackson, one of the older men at Anvik (PL II, 4), reported a second village above this place, which was inhabited in his father's grandfather's time. We were unable to visit it. The Eleven-Mile village is on a point of land, on the west side of what was formerly the main channel of the Anvik River, and on the south east side of a now dried-up slough (Fig. 17). The main channel of the river, called the Cut Off, is apparently not far distant to the north west. Twenty house pits and a kashim, an aban doned log structure, perhaps a cabin, and sev eral graves were found at this site. The graves were probably made after the village was abandoned, because they are scattered among the house pits, and it is doubtful if the natives would have built them there while they were still occupying the houses. The graves are coffins of wood and bark, originally set up on posts (PL IV, 8). The hours vary in size from House 17, meas uring 8X11| feet, to House 5, 18|X17 feet. The tunnel from this house, 13 feet long, leads into a hole about 2\ feet deep. The longest tunnel, 18 feet in length, was on House 2, and led into a large boggy hole, 8 feet deep. The houses seem to be of various ages to judge by the condition of the pits. The shape of some was so indefinite that they were difficult to measure, and it was impossible to determine the position of the tunnel. The depressions varied in depth from 1 to 3 feet. In general, the average size of the houses was more comparable to those at the site across from Hologochaket than at the Old Fish Camp. The kashim was obviously a modern struc ture. It faced east, and its tunnel was 16 feet long. The front and back walls measure 22| feet, the side walls, 16 feet. We explored House 13. It faced east, the front wall was 15J feet long, the side wall, 15 feet, and the tunnel, 9| feet. We found no clear roof or floor level, though the depth of the refill in the original excavation seemed to be from 18 inches to 2 feet, consisting of earth and fragments of charcoal. The only objects found in the house were a lump of agate (35 21-310), two unworked pebbles, perhaps used as netweights (35-21-311 a, b) and fragments of several poorly fired pots (Fig. 27, 7). One of the fallen graves was opened. The skeleton was that of a woman, to judge from the associated objects, and while she was not of large stature, the boards of the coffin were so short as to indicate that the body had been tightly flexed. The bones were too much dis turbed for their original position to be deter mined. Handwrought nails had been used in the construction of the coffin. With this skele ton (35-21-299) were three iron bracelets (35 21-300 a-c), glass beads (35-21-301), a number of caribou incisors, apparently used as a decora tion for something, though they were unworked, (35-21-302), a bone bootsole creaser (PL XIV, 24), an antler ulo handle with traces of an iron blade (PL XIV, 29), and a broken lump of agate (35-21-305). Old Bonasila, ntt'sana n73n (Jette: Netsen' anten, or Tsenanron, "launching canoes") (PL IX, 1, 2, Fig. 18) is on a flat between Cement Hill and Long Mountain, about 22 miles be low Anvik, and 20 miles above Holy Cross. Most of the site is north of the mouth of Cold Creek, about \ mile below the bluffs of Cement Hill. A few recently abandoned cabins can be seen south of the stream, where Maximillian had a trading post. The site was inhabited around 1880 (Petroff gives it the name of Makeymute and lists 121 inhabitants)64 but it was abandoned in 1898, after a measles epi demic, when the survivors founded New 64 Petroff, 1884, p. 12.</page><page sequence="79">72 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 Bonasila, just below Long Mountain. Old Bonasila is probably the place visited by Dall in 1867 and described by him as a "large win ter village between two hills, known to the Russians as the Murderer's Village,,, and also as "The winter Leather Village," 27 miles below Anvik, "at the end of the Shageluk." Zagoskin mentions Makki village, without any further details.65 The site was visited by Hrdlicka in 1926, who writes of it: The most interesting of these [older sites] was found at Bonasila, beneath the old site of Makki or Magimute, 18 miles downstream from Anvik. ... [It is on a] low flat backed by rising ground and cut across by a little stream.The flat is narrow, at present about 300 feet; and the part above the stream is deeply pitted by the remains of semisubter ranean houses of a "dead" native village, which I believe is identifiable with the Magimute of the Russians. On the slope behind the village were still about a score of old sur face burials, with an article here and there of Russian deri vation. The bank of the flat rises at present only about 4 feet above the beach of the river [our First Terrace], but the flat behind is higher [our Second Terrace]. The bank itself [First Terrace] contains many specimens showing human work manship, consisting of objects of stone, birch bark, bone, and rarely also of ivory, besides many fragments of pottery, many bones of wild Alaskan animals, and here and there a human skeleton. Some of these objects are low down in the bank. All the bones from the bank, including the human, and even the rare points of ivory, are semifossilized; the stone industry is peculiar; and the human remains differ plainly from both those of the later Yukon Indian and from those of the Eskimo. They are apparently Indian . . . but a tall Indian of a type that now is only met with much further south.66 He mentions "two fine long, partly fossilized ivory points . . . handsomely barbed on one side" that were found here, and hazards that they may be related to the Old Bering Sea culture. He also excavated five graves on the Second Terrace.67 H. W. Krieger, who contributed a discussion of the stone artifacts and pottery found here, states that the stone tools are of a very primi tive or degenerate type, and are "unique among Alaskan artifacts and have no relation ship with known types of Eskimo or Indian stonework."68 He finds it significant that Hrdlicka's collection included no objects of ground slate or jadeite. He makes a distinction between the "older" pottery from Bonasila [from the beach and First Terrace] and the pottery lamps found with recent burials on 65 Dall, 1870, pp. 220, 283; Zagoskin (1935), p. 235. 66 Hrdli&amp;a, 1930a, pp. 142 f. 67 Op. tit., 1930a, pp. 61, 144. 68 Krieger in HrdliCka, 1930a, pp. 145 ff. top of the Second Terrace. The latter he be lieves to be Eskimo, the former neither Eskimo nor Tinne. "The coarse type of pottery is un like that of the modern Eskimo in tempering, firing, and decorative design." For both stone tools and pottery he suggests an unknown Asiatic source. Hrdlicka revisited in Bonasila in 1929, when he wrote: The site at Bonasila yielded many further specimens, and if the erosion continues as at the present, it will continue to yield more for many years. From the collections made up to the present time and from excavations carried on this year it is now certain that the site comprised but one settlement, which began in pre-Russian times and continued t6 the time of the Russians. The culture, it is now seen, is essentially the same as that further down the river and must hence be ascribed to the Eskimoid rather than Indian people. The earlier skeletal remains from the site, unfortunately still too few in number, are exceedingly interesting.89 There are two terraces between Cold Creek and Cement Hill (Fig. 18). The First is a nar row and not very long strip, only 4 feet above the present river beach. The Second Terrace, on which the house pits are scattered, is about 10 feet high and slopes up to a wooded hillside behind the village, on the lower edge of which are modern graves. We begin excavation at the foot of the Second Terrace, and in the First Terrace discovered 1 inch of humus, 6-12 inches of silt, representing six or seven recent floods, a layer of charcoal 4-6 inches thick, containing artifacts, which rested on beach sand, also containing artifacts. At one time, therefore, the edge of the Second Terrace formed the river bank, and what is now the sand layer of the First Terrace was the beach. This sand is derived from Cement Hill. The artifacts found in the charcoal layer and in the sand of the First Terrace had evidently been washed down from the bank above. Later the river cut down and out, leaving the old beach as a low terrace. At flood times it still covers the First Terrace, and at even moderately high water it cuts away its bank. Near the mouth of Cold Creek, to which the First Ter race does not extend, the river cut directly into the bank of the Second Terrace. The arti facts thus exposed are scattered over the pres ent beach, the light bone material being carried by an eddy almost to the foot of Cement Hill. In the charcoal layer above the beach of the First Terrace we found: whetstone (31-21-223); four fragments of red stone ground for paint 69 Hrdlicka, 19306, p. 146.</page><page sequence="80">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 73 (35-21-222); jasper engraving tool (PL XIV, 7); three fragments of chipped stone (35-21-221 a, c, d); antler knife handle (PL XIV, 31); bone scraper or skinning tool (35-21-215); barbed antler arrowhead (PL XV, 14); fragments of bone and antler, some obviously worked with a steel tool (35-21-217 a, b, and -218 a-d); broken iron finger ring (35-21-220); and pot sherds (35-21-219). In the beach sand of the First Terrace, under this charcoal, we found: stone saw (PL XIII, 18); single-edged knife blade of polished dior ite (PL XIV, 21); two ulo-shaped scrapers (PL XIII, 13, 14); jasper chip (35-21-229); barbed antler arrowhead (PL XV, 12); bone knife blade (?) (35-21-226); antler spoon handle (PL XIV, 28); blue glass bead (35-21-228); and potsherds (Fig. 28. 11). The slope of the Second Terrace was covered with a humus layer from 18 inches to 2 feet thick, continuous with the thin humus over lying the top of the First Terrace. In this layer we found: whetstone (35-21-238); stone saw (PL XIII, 3); ulo-shaped scraper (35-21-236); triangular slate weapon blade (PL XIV, 14); five worked fragments of stone, including un finished slate blade, slate bar, slate chip, jasper chip, fragment of chipped and polished stone (35-21-235 a-e); fragments of cut bone and antler, one of which had certainly been worked with a steel knife (35-21-233 a-c); potsherds and scraper made from a sherd (Fig. 28, 7, 9; Fig. 29, 1,6; Fig. 31, 3). Near the edge of the Second Terrace at this place was the pit of a kashim (House 1). It measured 20 feet square, with a tunnel leading towards the river and opening into an ante chamber or porch, approximately 8 feet square. The specimens found in the slope below were probably derived in large part from the refuse thrown out of the kashim. The front wall of the antechamber was missing, having been de stroyed by the cutting of the bank by the river. Three logs forming the lower part of the south wall of the antechamber had sagged, and the floor also sloped down the bank. The floor of the antechamber was covered with sand, through which a path had been worn to the tunnel. The logs and stakes of the antechamber and the roof beams of the kashim, as far as we were able to uncover them, had been cut with a steel adz or ax. The roof of the kashim (PL VII, 4) was probably cribbed, like that of the pres ent kashim at Hologochaket (Fig. 22). It seems apparent from the finds that the beach of the First Terrace was being formed while Bonasila was still inhabited, but that the kashim was probably abandoned before the edge of the Second Terrace had been cut back to its present position. In the antechamber or porch of the kashim (House 1) we found the following objects: whetstone (35-21-247); hammerstone (35-21 248); red stone used for paint (35-21-250); two fragments of worked jasper (35-21-246 and -243 c); green chert flake (35-21-243 a); horn fels flake (PL XIV, 5); three ulo-shaped scrapers (35-21-240 and -245 a, b); bird bone tube (35 21-242); and potsherds (Fig. 26, 12; Fig. 33, 4). A white glass bead was found in the tunnel to the kashim. A few artifacts found in the turf above the kashim roof may have been thrown there after the building was abandoned, or may have been carried there accidentally with turf when the kashim was built. These are: greenstone chisel (PL XI, 8); three whetstones (35-21-252); jasper flake (35-21-253); bone netweight (or handle) (PL XVI, 20); and potsherds (Fig.31, 10). We also excavated an indefinite pit ("House" 2) on the edge of the Second Terrace a short distance above the kashim. This proved not to be a house but a place where salmon eggs had been cached in pits lined with birch bark. Above the pits, there had evidently been a bark roof, supported on poles that had been cut with a steel ax. In the turf above the roof we found: unfinished planing adz blade (PL XI, 14); andesite chisel (PL XI, 9); chipped stone arrowhead (PL XIV, 1); single-edged slate knife blade (PL XIV, 17); ulo blade (35-21-258); two ulo-shaped scrapers (PL XII, 3, and 35-21 259); three naturally hollow stone vessels, smoothed inside and smeared with red paint (35-21-256 a-c); and potsherds (Fig. 30, 5; Fig. 31, 7). Below the roof was a layer of undisturbed river silt, indicating that the site had been flooded. The tops of the bark-lined pits were some 6 inches below this silt level. On the floor (or original ground level) of the structure above the pits, we found the following: adz or scraper blade (PL XI, 13); two whetstones (35-21-269 a, b); chipped flint and jasper frag ments (35-21-267 a, b); red stone used for paint (35-21-270); naturally hollow stone, smoothed inside and smeared with red paint (35-21-266); and potsherds (PL XXIV, 8). In one of the pits containing rotten salmon</page><page sequence="81">74 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 eggs we found a planing adz blade (PL XI, 19). The following artifacts, in addition to numer ous unworked animal and bird bones, bits of iron, glass, china, etc., were found on the beach at Bonasila: planing adz blade (PL XI, 17); hammerstone or adz (35-21-211); nine whet stones (Pis. XII, 7; XIII, 6, 20; and 35-21-212 a-c, e, g, h); stone used for red paint (35-21-213); three bone and antler knife handles (PL XIV, 30, 43, 46); four barbed bone arrowheads (PL XV, 9, 11, 16, 17); antler socket piece (?) (PL XV, 20); three fish spear prongs (PL XV, 22, 23, and 35-21-201 b); antler wedge (PL XVI, 30); decorated scapula scraper (PL XV, 24); bone awl (35-21-205); antler comb, made with steel saw (?) (PL XIV, 38); stone inset for wooden dish (PL XIV, 45); worked bone frag ments (35-21-207 a-e); and potsherds (PL XXIV, 5, 10, 11, 16, 17, 20; Fig. 26, 8-11; Fig. 28,1, 2, 5, 6,10; Fig. 29, 2, 4, 5; Fig. 30,1, 3, 6; Fig. 31,2; Fig. 33, 2, 5). It is thus obvious from the material gathered that the site was occupied both in prehistoric and modern times. Unfortunately, in spite of our efforts to discover an old house pit or mid den level antedating Russian contact, we found only deposits where both old and recent arti facts were mixed. The older part of the site, from which the stone cutting tools were origi nally derived, may have been washed away entirely. The crude stone tools (ulo-shaped scrapers), which might have been thought to come from a pre-ceramic horizon, were found scattered indiscriminately with potsherds and other artifacts at every level explored. The material (andesite) is derived from the large boulders of Cement Hill. Most of these artifacts were probably naturally broken flakes, such as can be picked up by the hundred on the beach at the point, and the naturally sharp edge could be used without further working. Because all of the house pits seemed to be modern and to be quite similar to those seen at the sites described above, and because our time was limited, we made no attempt to meas ure them. All of the graves seen were modern, above-ground box burials, dating from 1867 1898. One grave close to the house pits may even have been built after the site was aban doned. New Bonasila, the village established by for mer residents of Old Bonasila is J mile below the basalt and mud-flow bluffs of Long Moun tain, or some 2 miles below the parent village. It is called debitci-tt, "at the point of the hill." (Jette, however, gives the name De'loyitchit, "in the angle of a hill," to Holy Cross). Here there are three terraces, with about twelve house pits and the pit of a kashim on the high est terrace, 8-10 feet above the river, between the modern cabins and the graveyard on the slope of the hill. The kashim pit has several trees growing in it, but neither it nor the houses seem to be old, though the natives re port finding stone adzes on the beach. Probably there was a prehistoric site here, but, as at Bonasila, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to locate it. We did not attempt any excavation here. Petroff indicates four villages between Old Bonasila and Holy Cross.70 These are Ignok hatskamute, with a population of 175 in 1880; Ashkomute, population thirty; Ookagamute, twenty-five; and Kaialigamute, or Khaigamute. It is impossible to identify the villages from these Eskimo names. The Innoko River The Innoko River, which enters the Yukon from the east, opposite Holy Cross, is con nected to its parent river by a long winding slough. This slough branches midway, the northern branch, known locally as Thompson Slough, entering the Innoko about a mile above Hologochaket, the longer southern branch, to which the name Shageluk Slough more specifically applies, running south, rough ly parallel with the river, to enter it between Hologochaket and Shageluk village. There is said to be a site at the point within the fork. The name Shageluk, tcauluq, as Indians pro nounce it, is said to be Eskimo. By analogy with the Prince William Sound Eskimo dia lect, it probably means "silver salmon place." The Indian name for the village is etdexe. According to Mr. Paul Keating, a trader at Hologochaket (Jette: Roluketchakat), there are several sites in the immediate vicinity of the village. We suspect that the modern houses may have been on a prehistoric site, since Mr. Keating found a planing adz blade (PL XI, 5) on the beach here. He reports an old site on the west bank of the Innoko between Hologochaket and Thompson Slough, where he found a sec ond planing adz blade (PL XI, 15), and a ulo blade (PL XIII, 7). Owing to a misunderstand ing, we neglected to explore the place. There is a lake behind Hologochaket, at present con Petroff, 1884, pp. 11 f.</page><page sequence="82">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 75 nected with the Innoko through a small outlet. A village site on the far side of the lake is only 75 years old. Contemporary with it was a ka shim on the river bank which was destroyed six years ago when the channel between the lake and the river was cut during a flood. The house pits on the north side of the channel, near Mr. Wood's store, are only fifty years old. The pit of a large kashim in Hologochaket is not pre historic. The kashim burned down only six years ago. Across the Innoko and a little above Hologo chaket, is another village site, which we ex plored. We have called it the site opposite Hologochaket. It proved, however, not to be very old. It contains eight house ruins and IN NOKO RI VCR ~ N SITE OPPOS IT* /f HOLOQOCHAKtT * C ;&lt;Aii in net O** 9?-"' *?&gt; Fig. 19.?Site Opposite Hologochaket, Innoko River (Fig. 14).

All of the build ings faced south, away from the river, with the exception of House 7, which faced downstream, and House 5, an indefinite pit, the entrance to which we were unable to determine. In every case, the tunnel entered one of the longer walls. That which we have called House 5 was prob ably not a dwelling at all. It measures 7 feet 3 inches by 7 feet 8 inches, is only 1 foot deep, and seems much too small to have been a regular house. House 4, measuring 10X11 feet, is the smallest; House 2, measuring 12JX15 feet, is the largest. The pits are at present from ?&gt;-. \W&lt;v ^==! fcl LI ? ? | !

The kashim, House 9, is 23X20 feet, and 8 feet deep, with a tunnel 16| feet long. It is to be noted that the average size of these houses seems a little larger than that of houses farther up the Yukon Valley, though the size remains well within the range of house sizes at the Old Fish Camp. The kashim is larger by a few feet than kashims seen at Ka teel, or on the Khotol, and is much deeper. We excavated House 7 (Fig. 20) and found in it a deposit of river silt 2 feet thick, making the floor level some 4-4J feet below the level of the ground outside. However, there seems to have been a second floor level slightly above the first. The timbers of the roof had been cut with a steel ax. A layer of grass was found on the lower floor. While the roof beams were fairly well preserved, it was difficult to determine the construction. One had the impression that the roof had been pyramidal, sloping up from all four walls to a smokehole in the middle. In this house we found: bone ulo handle (35 21-318); wooden scraper handle (PL XIV, 48);</page><page sequence="83">76 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 antler wedge (PL XVI, 29); two pottery lamps (PL XXII, 2, 3; Fig. 32, 3, 5); scrap of iron and blue glass bead. Shageluk on the Innoko may be an old site. We purchased from Mr. Keating a "hunting adz" (PL XI, 3) which is said to have been found here, as well as a pottery lamp (PL XXII, 1, and Fig. 32, 4) which is probably also from the same place. Zagoskin ascended the Innoko from its mouth to some point above its junction with Thompson Slough. According to his informants the upper part of the Innoko is called the Tlegon (TjieroHt on the map). The Tlegon, from the east, and the Ttachegno (TTanerHo on the map), from the west, flow together to form the middle Innoko, called the Inno-ka, or the Shiltonotno (IIIhjibtohotho and HmioKa on the map). A small tributary from the east, enter ing the river above the Thompson Slough, is the Yalchikatno (Hji^HKaTHo on the map). The Thompson Slough, rendered as Tztzeaika in the translation, flows into the Shiltonotno, and the slough as well as the river below it are called Ittege by the Indians and Chageluk by the Eskimo (Innoka or Chagelyuk, ^arejuoicL, on the map). It will be remembered that our Indian informants gave us the equivalents of both It tege and Chageluk for Shageluk Village. More often, however, Zagoskin applies Ittege to the lower Innoko alone. In the early part of his narrative he calls both the Koyukuk and the Innoko by the same name, Unna'-ka, so that only the content can tell us to which river he refers. In the latter sections, however, he ap plies Unna'-ka only to the Koyukuk and calls the Innoko Inno-ka.71 Ascending the river he passed the following villages: 1. Inselnostlende or Katihkat-mut, with a kashim, two winter houses, and a population of thirty-three. In the narrative he refers to it as at the mouth, but the map locates Insel nostlende (HHcejibHocTjienfle) on the west bank, some distance above the mouth. This is Holm berg's Insehlnothlende. 2. Huingitetahten or Huinshtetahten on the west bank (Xuingichetaxten, X^HHrH^eTaxTeH-L, on the map). This is Holmberg's Chuingite tachten. 3. Iltenleyden, Iltenleynde, or Unagun Chageluk-mut (Shageluk) on the east bank, the biggest village of the region, with six win 71 Zagoskin (1935), pp. 305-319. ter houses and a population of over a hundred. (Intenleiden, HHTeHjieftAem,, on the map). This is Holmberg's Ishltenleiden. 4. Tlegozitno on the west bank, where a stream enters the Innoko from the Tzaika mountains (Tlegozhitno, TjierojKHTHo, on the map). This is Holmberg's Tlegoshitno. 5. Tozgelede, a small village on the east bank, seven miles below Hologochaket (Tozh gelede, Tomvem&gt;eRe, on the map). 6. Huligichagat or Hulichichagat on the east bank of the Innoko, one mile below the mouth of Thompson Slough (Xuligichagat, XyjiHrHHaraTL, on the map). It had five winter houses and a population of over seventy. This is Holmberg's Chuligitshagath, and is probably our site opposite Hologochaket. 7. The summer camp of Tozgelede, opposite the mouth of Thompson Slough. "The Huligachagat village is the last one, where settlements of the Ttinytz, the tribe of Inkilikov-Ut-elnut are ended." Going still farther up the river he came to the first Tlegon village, Ttalite or Totacholden, on the west bank (Tahiti, TajuiHTu, on the map, at the mouth of the Yalchikatno). There were three winter houses and a kashim here. Other Tlegon settlements were the small villages of Tlegonkohkakat, Tlek-et, and Kholikakat, none of which are marked on the map. "The Tlegon-Hotena tribe was more for leading a nomad life than settled and did not follow the habits of seashore people [Eskimo] as to spend ing their time taking baths, plays and dances, and built a kasima only for traveling guests." Dall in 1867 visited "the Leather Village of the Russians. This is a large Ingalik summer village, the inhabitants in winter living at the last-mentioned settlement" or Old Bonasila. It is "a little way" up the Innoko, and on the east bank, according to Dall's map.72 THE YUKON NEAR HOLY CROSS It is at Holy Cross that the present boundary between the Indians and the Eskimo is lo located; within this area, Eskimo influence is pronounced. For, example, many of the places are known to the Indians by both Eskimo and Indian names. Unfortunately, the small col lections which we were able to gather from Ghost Creek, just above Holy Cross, and from Fox Creek, about 14 miles below Holy Cross, were not large enough for us to be able to de 72 Dall, 1870, p. 220.</page><page sequence="84">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 77 termine whether they belong more properly to an Indian or to an Eskimo culture. However, even in this handful, certain rather striking Eskimo types were represented, and for that reason I will describe these collections sepa rately. At Victor's Point, just above the upper end of Walker's Slough, on the west bank of the Yukon about 5 miles above Holy Cross, there is said to be an abandoned site called rmstbqaySx, "... town." On the same flat, just below the site, a battle is said to have taken place in Russian times between the local natives and Indians from Nulato. Ghost Creek, where Jim Walker has a trad ing post, was a site in prehistoric and historic times (PL IX, 3). The prehistoric site is called soGiqaySx, "old town," (compare with the name for Old Fish Camp), and the more re cent settlement genaqahotchrt "the end of the big eddy." Walker reports house pits on both sides of Ghost Creek, and the site of a kashim could once be seen in front of his house. The oldest skeletons are said to have been wrapped in bark and buried sitting up. Many of these graves were uncovered by Walker when building his house and store, and he reburied the bones in a big pit behind the cold storage plant. He also reports more recent graves. One of these, which he left undisturbed, is a coffin, deposited on the surface of the ground, and containing the naturally mum mified body of a woman in a cloth dress. The outside of the coffin is painted red. He de scribed other coffins, decorated with painted pictures or cylindrical pegs of ivory. The traces of the old village are pretty well obliterated, but during floods, when the Yukon cuts into the higher ground, pottery and stone tools are washed onto the beach. Walker reports that the clay used by the local natives was obtained at Hall's Rapids, and that the pots found at Ghost Creek were decorated by the insertion of pieces of ivory or caribou bone. The insets were small cylindrical pieces, pressed into the clay to form a line about 3 inches below the rim. We saw no pottery of this type anywhere on the Yukon, and wonder if he is not confusing the incised and pressed designs on pottery with the decora tion of wooden dishes with insets of stone and ivory. Hrdlicka visited this site in 1926 and opened some graves J mile farther up stream.73 73 Hrdlicka, 1930a, pp. 63 f. Schwatka (1883) indicates graves at Ghost Creek, with a village on the island in front, and on the east bank of the Yukon opposite. We purchased a small collection of objects found at Ghost Creek, comprising the following: adz blade (PL XXV, 13); two barbed antler arrowheads (PL XXVI, 3, 23); detachable barbed head (PL XXV, 7); and bird bone tube (PL XXVI, 12). This site at Ghost Creek seems to be Zagos kins' large village of Aniluhtakpak (Aniluxtak kak, AmuiyxTaK-KaKTb, on his map), located on the west bank of the Yukon, just above the point at Holy Cross, and opposite the end of the long island. One obscure passage in his nar rative would indicate, however, that it was on the left, or east, bank of the Yukon, three miles above the mouth of the Innoko. It is always possible that there was a subsidiary village or camp called by the same name as the main set tlement. Holmberg renders it as Aniluchtak pakh, and marks it at Ghost Creek. Zagoskin says that this village had a population of 150 and was the southernmost Indian village on the Yukon. In 1843, 700 adults gathered in the kashim for a celebration. "This building is twelve sagen square and more than six sagen high, has three rows of benches; the spruce boards of it are three and a half feet wide, shows as if they were chopped and squared by stone axes."74 Holy Cross, where the Catholic Mission is established, is called debi-tat, "the end of the hills" (Jette: De'loyitchit, Tihloyikeyit, "in the angle of a hill"). The native village at the Mission is also called, at any rate by the Nulato Indians, NSle'irken, Nele'irkten, or NelSlS' irkten, "Goblin's place." Jette has published the myth explaining the origin of the name un der the title of "The Bugbear."75 However, he here gives the name to Koserefsky, across the Yukon from Holy Cross. The name may well have belonged more properly to the latter vil lage, and have been transferred to Holy Cross with the shift of population when Koserefsky was abandoned. In any case, the inhabitants are supposed to be in large measure the de scendants of a woman from Kateel, who went crazy and ran away in a time of famine. She traveled down the Yukon, stealing food at night from caches and fish racks. Finally, after conjuring was of no avail, three young men of 74 Zagoskin (1935), pp. 225 f., 321. A sagen is about 7 feet. 75 Jette, 1908, pp. 317-320.</page><page sequence="85">78 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 Koserefsky caught her in a noose, tamed and married her. Because she had been a "goblin," the actual shape of her face and body had changed; she was hairy, with long claw-like nails and slant eyes. These physical character istics are supposed to have been inherited by her descendants. This story is apparently an attempt to explain the Eskimo features found in the mixed population at Holy Cross. She was supposed to have told her children to love the people of Kateel, because they were their brothers. This story is believed by the Indians at Koyukuk Station, and in consequence they feel very friendly to the Holy Cross natives. Such "goblins" are called NgnePin or Nedoron, and it is believed that whoever sees one must die, unless he has the nerve to kill it, tear open the belly and eat the liver. There is no evidence, we should add, of any old site at Holy Cross Mission. We did not visit the site of Koserefsky. We visited a site at Fox Creek on the west bank of the Yukon, 14 miles below Holy Cross (PL IX, 4). This is on the first flat below a sand stone hill, near the lower end of Horse Island. Mr. Frank Fox lives here. The site is called korpxtb '7omun or qorpxkrq, according to our Indian informants at Holy Cross, but these are both Eskimo names. The site is on both sides of the little creek, but most of the house pits have been obliterated by gardening. A few could be seen on the east bank of the stream, beyond the garden, and half of a large kashim pit could be traced on the opposite bank. Graves were reported on the east side of the stream, between the house and the steep hill side. Along the cut river bank in front of the site, old house floors (?) were noticed, 3? feet below the surface. Both stone adzes and glass beads were found on the beach, suggesting that here, too, there were both prehistoric and recent settlements. In addition to the collection made at the place by ourselves and the objects pur chased from Mr. Fox, Jim Walker at Ghost Creek sold us a few objects said to have been collected by Charles Ray at Fox Creek. Be cause of the slight uncertainty in provenience the objects found by Ray are indicated with an R after the catalogue number. The principal specimens are illustrated in Plates XXV and XXVI. For an enumeration of the types repre sented, see Chapter VII, which is devoted to them. At Horse Camp, just above the hill at Fox Creek, there was a village inhabited in Russian times, called tatatta'pn, or in Eskimo, nuna 7obq, according to our Indian informants.</page><page sequence="86">CHAPTER IV DISPOSAL OF THE DEAD TENA INDIAN BURIALS \CCORDING to our own observations and jt\. to the published accounts, the Tena have practiced many different methods of disposing of the dead, and there are also a number of sup plementary traits associated with these meth ods. We may list them as follows: 1. Inhumation a) Simple inhumation (lower Innoko, Black burn to Holy Cross) b) In the house (prehistoric, Khotol River) c) Under a grave house (Nowitna to Holy Cross) 2. Ensepulture above ground a) Upright, in a log cask (Fort Selkirk Kutchin to the Tena between Tanana and the Nowitna) b) In a coffin, raised on posts or set in a tree (Nowitna to Holy Cross). Sometimes a canoe is substituted for a coffin (above Blackburn?) c) In a coffin resting on the ground (Khotol River to Holy Cross) 3. Cremation, with area sometimes marked by lobbed tree (Koyukuk, Blackburn to Holy Cross) 4. Mummification (Koyukuk) Other traits are: A. Use of a double coffin with a lining of clay between the boards (Blackburn to Holy Cross, lower Innoko, and also Nulato to Blackburn?) B. Painting of the outer coffin (Anvik and the lower Innoko, Holy Cross, and also Nulato to Blackburn?) C. Streamers or flags on poles at the graves (Tanana to Holy Cross) D. Carved animal figures at the graves (Ram part Rapids to Koyukuk) E. Placing shaman's post at his grave (Black burn to Holy Cross, and the lower Innoko) F. Surrounding the grave with a picket fence (Rampart Rapids to Holy Cross) G. Preservation of trophy skull (Khotol River) In the following pages detailed descriptions of Yukon Indian graves are given, some notes on burial customs are added, and in the final section of this chapter the Tena practices are compared with those of peoples in the surround ing areas. It will be remembered that a single skull was found in House 7, Yukon Willow Creek on the Khotol, an historic site. It does not seem likely, that an isolated skull, without a mandible, would have been carried into the house except under special circumstances. It may have been a trophy skull. Trophy skulls were taken by the Indians of the Northwest Coast, the prehistoric Eskimo of Cook Inlet (Kachemak Bay sub Ill) and of Port Moller on the Alaska Penin sula, and by the modern Eskimo of Bristol Bay and the Kuskokwim, the custom having spread north from the Indians of southeastern Alaska.1 If the specimen in question is a trophy skull, the Yukon Indians must have borrowed the trait from their Eskimo neighbors. The only prehistoric graves found by the ex pedition were those under the floor of House 12, Old Fish Camp (PL VII, 1, 2). It will be re membered that the one which we were able to excavate was a shallow hole in one corner of the house, containing a flexed skeleton, wrapped in two layers of twined matting and birch bark, and covered over with sand. Whether burial in a house was common at this period, or whether it was reserved for special individuals, we have no means of knowing. I think we may infer, however, that inhumation was probably prac ticed outside the house at this same period. This is a point to which I shall return later. Osgood believes that in prehistoric times about half the Ingalik dead (Blackburn to Holy Cross) were buried. Murder victims might be inhumed under the fireplace of the house, wrapped in their own grass mat or skin on which they used to sleep.2 Burial methods observed in historic times among the Yukon Indians differ from that noted at the Old Fish Camp. Dall reports that the Un'a-kho-tana (be tween Ruby and Tanana) "deposit their dead sometimes in an erect posture, the sarcophagus looking like a roughly-made cask."3 Apparently no other writer observed this type of sepulture in a log cask for this part of the Yukon. At Nuklukahyet, on the point between the Tanana and the Yukon, Dall noticed "several graves in 1 de Laguna, 1934, p. 166. 2 Osgood, 1940, p. 409. 3 Dall, 1877a, p. 28. 79</page><page sequence="87">80 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 which the dead were enclosed, in a standing posture, in a circle of sticks squared on four sides and secured by hoops of green wood, thus looking much like a cask. From the sticks hung strips of cloth and fur."4 Schwatka publishes a picture of such a grave from the vicinity of Fort Selkirk at the mouth of the Pelly River, in Yukon Territory,5 so it is possible that such graves at the mouth of the Tanana may have been made by visiting Kutchin Indians from the upper Yukon, or by the local Tena in imi tation of them. According to most reports, the Indians below Tanana used a different type of coffin. Three types have been described, though the informa tion is not precise enough for us to determine what were the distributions of these types. They seem to be, however: (1) wooden coffin, half-buried in the ground, with a pile of logs on the lid (upper part of the middle Yukon); (2) wooden coffin set on posts or in trees (Yukon from the vicinity of the Nowitna to Blackburn [?]); (3) double wooden coffin set on posts, the space between the two boxes being filled with clay, and the outer box painted (Yukon below Blackburn, the lower Innoko [?] and the coast Eskimo). Dall writes of the Indians between the No witna and Tanana: "The bodies of the dead are always placed by them above ground in a box or wooden receptacle."6 Schwatka says that "coffins in trees" seen by him at Old Low den during his descent of the Yukon were "the first of this character seen on the river."7 Whymper says of the natives near Nulato: They do not inter the dead, but put them in oblong boxes, raised on posts, sometimes decorated with strips of skin hanging over them, sometimes with the possessions of the deceased (as a "baidarre," or other canoe, with paddles, etc.) on the top of the box. Small possessions are often put inside with the corpse. The tomb can not be better described than as a four-post coffin. They are common to the coast tribes also.8 The illustration also shows a pole with streamers rising from the top of the grave box (?) or from just behind it. On the grave box are piled a canoe, snowshoes, etc. The elevated coffin or box looks as if it were open at one end, but this is probably a mistake of the illustrator. 4 Dall, 1870, p. 95. 5 Schwatka, 1885, Fig. 20. 6 Dall, 1877a, p. 28. 7 Schwatka, 1885, p. 54. 8 Whymper, 1869, p. 211, fig. on p. 208. Jacobsen visited the graveyard at Makkat mekettan, an unidentified village on the middle Yukon between Mouse Point and Old Melozi. The following observations, however, apply chiefly to the lower Tena (Ingalik): The Ingalik as well as the Kwikpagemut are accustomed to bury their dead in the following manner: 4 posts are driven into the ground, their tops are about a man's height above the surface. On these posts the grave box is set. This box is made of two rectangular long boxes, an inner and an outer, between which is an airtight layer of mud or clay. The inner box holds the corpse, which is protected from the air by this clay layer. The outer box forms the grave monument and is commonly painted with red and black figures. These paint ings represent scenes of hunting and fishing and illustrate the deeds of the dead. The red color used for these designs consists of a clay found in Alaska; the black, on the con trary, is an artificial product of salmon spawn, which acts as an agglutinant, and powdered charcoal. On the Upper Yu kon between Nuklukayet and Nulato I have also seen in Indian graveyards grave boxes that are half buried in the ground, with a great pile of wood on top of the lid. At the graveyards one sees weapons and fishing gear; women's household utensils and pieces of clothing are hung up or laid around the grave boxes.9 When at Koserefsky (the former trading post, roughly opposite Holy Cross, and the lowest Indian village on the Yukon in 1883), Jacobsen removed a grave box from the ceme tery. In the inner box, wrapped up in a mat of braided grass (geflochtenem Stroh), there was the body of a woman, whose head was covered with a kind of cap of glass beads.10 Petroff says of the Indians between Nulato and Holy Cross: The Kainhkhotana, like most of their Athabaskan neigh bors, deposit the bodies of their dead in boxes raised on posts somewhat above the ground. Flags and streamers of white cotton are frequently attached to these structures. The burial-places are generally located upon some prom inent bluff overhanging the river, where the graves can be seen from a distance.11 Dall publishes a picture of an "Ingalik" coffin (at Ulukuk on the Unalaklik River?), which seems to be very similar to those of the Eskimo on the lower Yukon and on Norton Sound.12 He also writes: I noticed that the graves or coffins here [Anvik], instead of being covered with logs, as farther up the river, were filled in with earth beaten down hard and plastered over with clay. They were larger, rather more elevated, and painted more after the Innuit fashion than those farther up on the Yukon. 9 Jacobsen, 1884, pp. 193 f., my translation. 10 Op. tit., p. 203, my translation. 11 Petroff, 1884, p. 162. 12 Dall, 1870, pp. 128,133, fig. on p. 132.</page><page sequence="88">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 81 Of a body prepared for burial in such a cof fin, he writes: The body lay on its side in a deerskin. The heels were lashed to the small of the back, and the head bent forward on the chest, so that his coffin needed to be only about four feet long. Elevated coffins were noted by our party at a few places. At Terentief's station, on the west bank of the Yukon, 8 miles below Koyukuk, we saw the skeleton of a child in a wooden coffin made of planks, which had apparently fallen from a platform. The body was flexed on the left side, and there was an iron cup by the feet. The graves seen at the village site on Anvik River were about 50 years old. The coffins were double-walled (?) and had formerly rested on four posts. The lids seem to have been of sewn birch bark, not planks. A child's coffin is il lustrated in Plate IV, 8. The head and foot boards of the coffin are cut with two pairs of tenons which project through holes in the side planks, and are secured by windings of roots about the projecting ends of the tenons. The grave of the woman which we investigated seems to have been of the same type, except that the coffin planks had been fastened to gether with hand-wrought iron nails. The coffin had fallen from its scaffold, had broken open, and was nearly covered over with moss and grass. The body was flexed and the coffin con tained grave goods. There were also burials in coffins resting on the ground. A plain plank coffin was seen in the woods near the Fort on the Khotol River. What may have been a double coffin of planks, protected by a gable roof of overlapping planks, open at the ends, was photographed at Stink Creek, below Kaltag (PL III, 7). At one end is a wooden cross. The natives at Koyukuk told us that in the old days the grave house was built with a gable roof like a house, was cov ered with bark, and had a door in one end. A few of the dead person's belongings were placed inside. We are not sure whether the house in this case also contained the body, or whether the corpse was interred below it. Mounds cov ered with birch bark marked the graves at Old Bonasila, and at a cemetery on the Innoko, above and across from Hologochaket. Since we did not disturb these, we cannot be sure if the bodies were below or above ground. Hrdlicka, who collected five skeletons at Bonasila, says that the coffins were boxes of hewn or split wood, dovetailed together, lying above ground. The body was wrapped in three or four pieces of birch bark, lay flexed on the right side, with the head to the east. The cover of the coffin was of planks, not fastened down, with sod piled on top. (It is possible that this sod covering was only the result of the natural growth of vegetation). He found no bottom planks for the coffins, but this may be because the planks had rotted. The burials were accompanied with grave goods, generally placed at the head. Some of the coffins seem to have been painted red.13 Some of the more recent graves at Ghost Creek, just above Holy Cross, con sisted of plank coffins above ground. These were said to have been painted and ornamented with inset ivory pegs. One was described as having red silhouettes of a man shooting with bow and arrow at a herd of caribou. The one which we saw was simply stained red on the outside. These graves were perhaps no older than the oldest burials seen elsewhere, where the body was interred under a house-like struc ture. The painted coffins were probably like that photographed by Hrdlicka on the Innoko.14 The side visible is painted with silhouette fig ures of caribou, standing on a double line, with a row of dots between the lines. According to Osgood, the richer people and the shamans among the Ingalik were put into coffins. These coffins were boxes of spruce planks, sewed together with spruce root. Unless the person happened to die in May or October, the two months when coffin houses were built, the coffin was temporarily placed on a rack in the graveyard, and at intervals of a few days a small fire was lit below it, resulting in partial mummification.16 The use of these coffin racks suggests the ensepulture in elevated coffins ob served by Dall, Whymper, Petroff and our selves, except that the latter were permanent disposals of the dead, not temporary. According to Osgood, all coffins were finally provided with coffin houses, and these seem to correspond to the outer coffins observed by Jacobsen, and also to the grave houses described below. The simplest and most common form of coffin house was simply a crib of split logs built up around the coffin, which was set on two logs resting on the ground. The inside of this crib was lined with birch bark, with a layer of earth between the bark and the log walls. The coffin inside 13 Hrdli?ka, 1930a, pp. 19, 61, 63. 14 Hrdli?ka, 19305, Fig. 124. 15 Osgood, 1940, pp. 409-412.</page><page sequence="89">82 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 was covered with bark and earth. The smooth split surface of the logs on the conspicuous side of the outer box might be painted with pictures of animals the deceased had excelled in hunting. The coffin and its house were oriented so that the foot was towards the rising sun (see Hrdlicka's observations at Bonasila). The house or outer box might be furnished with a gable roof of birch bark.16 The house enclosing the coffin of a shaman was more pretentious and was apparently left open at the ends, while the lid of the coffin was frequently unfastened, thus permitting the ghost to escape. The coffin inside rested on a frame of four logs which held it about a foot above the surface of the ground. The house itself seems to have been simply a gable roof of bark, held up by a post at each end and a ridgepole, the "eaves" resting on the ground at each side. Sometimes one side of the roof was formed by a plank, painted like the side of the ordinary coffin house.17 The bodies of suicides and murdered persons were some times laid on top of the coffin house of a rela tive, wrapped simply in a skin.18 It was the custom to set up a post, about eight feet high, which might have a roof or cover of birch bark, at the head of the coffin house, and at the head of ordinary earth burials. The belongings of the deceased were hung on other poles, erected under the protection of the bark cover.19 At the death of a powerful shaman, a post which had formerly stood inside the kashim was set up at his grave. This post might have a wooden doll or hawk skin, etc.?the shaman's "medi cine"?tied to it, and presumably these objects were left attached to the post at the grave.20 Osgood does not mention other carved figures at graves, similar to those seen at Koyukuk (see below). Although most of the travelers on the Yukon, whose reports have been quoted above, stressed disposal of the corpse above ground, the finding of two interments in the house on the Khotol River, suggested to us that burial in the ground outside the house might once have been prac ticed throughout the Tena area. This supposi tion has been strengthened by information collected from the Ingalik. Thus Osgood esti mates that about half the dead, including the 16 Op. tit., pp. 412^14. 17 Op. cit., pp. 414-415. 18 Op. tit., p. 413. 19 Op. cit., p. 415. 20 Op. tit., p. 420. poorer portion of the population, were buried in graveyards. These burials were either ex tended (?) on the back or flexed on the side, but the foot of the grave was always towards the rising sun, so that the dead person could look in that direction. The bodies were rolled up in their grass mats or sleeping skins. Poles were laid across the top of the grave pit, and these were covered with birch bark and the ex cavated earth.21 As already mentioned, posts with grave goods were generally set up at the head of the grave. Infants were sometimes buried under a tree. I am not certain whether such burials might be outside the graveyard. We have already mentioned the mounds cov ered with birch bark at Bonasila and on the Innoko near Hologochaket, which seem to con form to this type of burial. The oldest skeletons found at Ghost Creek are said to have been wrapped in bark and were buried in a sitting position, "because they did not want to go into the next world lying down." Most of the modern cemeteries contain small houses over the interred bodies. At Old Lowden, these houses were of two types. One has a steeply sloping pyramidal roof, the peak sur mounted with a horizontal wooden disk. The other type has a gable roof, and a sliding glass window in one of the longer sides. We could see no plank floor or grave goods inside these houses; there was only grass growing. If there had been anything in the pyramidal houses we could not have seen it, because these lacked the window. The skeleton which we obtained on the beach at Old Lowden had originally been interred in a wooden coffin, probably under one of these houses, and slid out when the river undercut the bank. It will be remembered that the body was accompanied by grave goods. The most elaborate grave houses were seen in the cemetery above Koyukuk Station (PL III, 6). The oldest graves were at the foot of the steep hillside, and were covered with pyram idally roofed houses (PL III, 4). The peak was surmounted by an elaborate arrangement of horizontal wooden disks or squares, small poles with crescentic figures, or a fretwork comb. There was always a cross at one end; in one case it was the Russian cross with three bars. The most recent graves, higher up the slope, had gable roofs on the houses and hinged glass windows (PL III, 6). These houses were 21 Op. tit., p. 409.</page><page sequence="90">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 83 made of planks, corrugated or sheet iron, and were usually enclosed in a white picket fence. Because of the steepness of the slope, the earth below each house had to be retained by a log wall. There was always a cross at one end of the house, perhaps a smaller one at one corner of the same end, and often a cross rising from the middle of the roof. The ends of these crosses might be carved into diamonds, disks, stars, crescents, trefoils and other figures. Houses usually had a wooden floor, covered with oil cloth, while the walls were lined on the inside with cotton cloth. The windows were often curtained. Other decoration in the houses consisted of paper pompoms, suspended like chandeliers, an American flag tacked on the wall opposite the window, dishes containing food, flowers in a tin can, a commercial funeral wreath, paper roses, etc. This funerary equip ment exhibited considerable variety. Near the foot of the grave there was generally a tall pole surmounted by an American flag, in most cases bleached white by rain and sun. The newer houses had evidently been visited regularly and were kept in good repair and freshly painted. With a few exceptions, these graves are anonymous. One has a tin shield nailed to the head cross, with the inscription: "Sacred to the Memory of Mrs. Lucy Kennedy, Faithful Wife, Good Mother, Born 1883, Died May 17, 1927, Rest in Peace." Inside the house is an oilcloth-covered table with a paper frill, on which are three china cups, one containing a tooth brush and tube of tooth paste, the second a pipe and matches. Beside them are a box of snuff, a jar of vaseline, a medicine bottle and a rubber nipple for a baby's bottle. A second nipple and a spoon are on the floor. Near the table is a tin bedroom pot, covered with cheese cloth. A funeral wreath is tacked on the wall below a colored picture of the Virgin. Another unusual grave has a marble tomb stone, evidently made in the States, with the inscription: "Matrona Pilot, Died April 10, 1927, Aged 35 years." The most interesting grave of all probably belonged to a female shaman, though the na tives would not definitely admit her profession (PL III, 3). A rather large plot is enclosed by a picket fence. Near one end is an iron house with a pyramidal roof, surmounted by a red wooden disk, from which rises a blue cross. At one end of the house is another cross, the lower part of the upright painted red, the upper part blue, with the ends red, and a yellow star in the square red area in the center. A horizontal board connects this cross and the top of the roof (PL III, 5). On this board are a number of animal figures, which one of the local Indians admitted might be the woman's familiar spirits. Jette reports that the graves of hunters were ornamented with carvings of animals. The ani mals on the board are, from left to right: a white wooden rabbit; a yellow wooden fox; a gray wooden bear; a red wooden moose with tin beard, ears, and horns; and a red tin fish. The house lacks a wooden floor but has a bench on the long wall opposite the windows. This holds two china cups, one containing two spoons, besides an old lard can and a paper bag filled with something. The walls are covered with cloth, and an American flag is tacked on the wall above the bench. Near the foot of the house is an imported marble cross, with the inscription: "Natalia Alexis, Born 1843, Died July 10, 1918." Near this monument is a tall red pole, perhaps originally a flag pole, since there is a pair of cleats near the bottom to secure the halyard. Above them a tin can has been tacked around the pole, after the fashion of the tin cans on cache posts to prevent rodents from climbing up. Above this is a flat blue wooden disk, with radiating lines (red, yellow and white) painted on the under side. A smaller disk is above, connected to the first along the rims with a series of curved sticks. These are painted white below, red at the bend, and blue above. At the top of the pole is a blue wooden bird with yellow head and tail. Schwatka has published the picture of a grave at Rampart Rapids, decorated with a number of small carvings of ducks, geese, and bears, set on poles. The picket fence sur rounding the plot he ascribes to white influence. There is no grave house.22 Dall mentions a similar grave, without grave house, near Bishop Mountain: "A little fence of white spruce stakes was built around it, and from several long poles streamers of white cotton were floating."23 The graveyard at Nulato is on the high point of the bluff above the town (PL IV, 3). Most of the grave houses are of sheet iron, with a steeply pointed pyramidal roof, on top of which is a flag pole or a weather vane. There are crosses at the head, usually with a metal plate on them, though the inscription is lacking. There are also detached flag poles. A few graves 22 Schwatka, 1885, p. 49, Fig. 33. 23 Dall, 1870, p. 79.</page><page sequence="91">84 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 are surrounded by fences. The glass windows (as at Koyukuk) are on the side towards the river, but the houses lack floors. Even the most recent have grass growing inside. A few graves are marked only by a sheet-iron platform, sur rounded by a fence; others are marked only by a canvas stretched on the ground. Allen remarked on the upper Tanana: "graves cov ered with cotton cloth; the first monuments of this type we had seen. This method of marking graves is very common on the Yukon."24 The spreading of canvas, but especially of a blanket, over the grave is not uncommon among the Tanaina of Cook Inlet, as I noticed in the course of my field-work there. On some of the grave houses at Nulato, large mirrors have been set up to reflect the village below. At one grave an old snow shovel had been left inside the fence, beside another was a canoe, by a third, a sled. The mirrors on the roofs are perhaps symbolic of the belief that the dead know what is going on in the village. A very simple grave house was seen at New Grayling. This was just a gable roof, open at both ends, without walls. At one end was a post surmounted by a horizontal board instead of the usual cross. Below the board was a sheet of tin, without inscription. At St. Joe, an aban doned village above New Grayling, there was a grave house of planks, resting on two horizontal logs. The roof was gabled, the ridge being capped by a flat plank. There was a picket fence around it, with a wooden cross at one end of the house. Graves marked only by a cross and picket fence were seen at Elia Sport's place between the Tozi and the "Eighteen-Mile Road House," at Baker on the Tanana, at Tanana Mission, and at Anvik. Natives at Koyukuk Station mention other methods for disposing of the dead. Sometimes the bodies were burned, in which case the ashes were left untouched at the place where the cremation occurred. The spot was marked by lopping off all but the topmost branches of the nearest tall tree. The same might be done for a tree near which a corpse was interred. A similar practice of trimming trees as grave markers was described by the Prince William Sound Eskimo (field notes, 1933). Zagoskin writes of some group of upper Tena, probably the Koyukuk: The dead ones they burn, and ashes put in small box or to the birch bark basket and take it to the place which 24 Allen, 1887, p. 84. is nominated for this purpose. They burned the body only when it begins to decay, so in the winter time if some family has a dead body, they take it to the chosen place which sometimes takes three months during the trip, using the body as a pillow. The basket or box with ashes is painted with red color and hangs on four not very high posts, in front of which they stick the weapons of the deceased per son, also the utensils of his household, beads, etc. We never heard of some one taking the things.25 Hrdlicka mentions finding the charred bones of a child at Bonasila.26 Osgood also mentions cremation for the In galik. They were accustomed to burn those found frozen to death, or those who had been killed in war?both friends and enemies?and occasionally suicides and murdered persons. The ashes were left untouched at the site of the pyre.27 A native at Koyukuk also told us that when a mother died, her infant was buried alive with her. If this were not done, her ghost would haunt the village where her baby was. Another Indian at Koyukuk told us that in ancient days a form of mummification was at tempted. The blood and viscera were removed from the corpse and it was left to dry in a sitting position on a sort of cache. We did not find out what factors were supposed to determine the various methods of corpse disposal said to have been practiced at Koyukuk. It is possible that mummification was a temporary expedient, like the disposal of the coffined corpse on a rack, before the coffin house was built, as re ported by Osgood from the Ingalik. However, these Indians did not remove the viscera, al though they did attempt to keep the body dry by burning small fires below it. Jette has published a few notes about the disposal of the dead. In a legendary narrative, only half believed, a man who was dying, or pre tending to die, told his wife to put his body in his canoe in a tree, together with his bow and arrows and other things.28 In a note, Jette ex plains: The Ten'a have adopted the method of burying under ground since Russian times, but previous to these their method was to bury on trees. Very commonly the canoe was used for this purpose; in other cases the body would be sim ply wrapped in blankets or skins, and suspended to the 25 Zagoskin (1935), pp. 339 f. 26 HrdliCka, 1930a, p. 61. 27 Osgood, 1940, pp. 415-416. 28 Jett6,1908, p. 344. The story is told in the "Upper Dia lect" (Koyukuk ?), but the home of the teller is not given. It is called "The Bear-Skin," and is almost identical with a story which Birket-Smith and I obtained from the Chugach of Prince William Sound.</page><page sequence="92">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 85 branches, as a bundle, swinging in the wind. Or again, it would be deposited on a platform raised on four posts, some 8 or 10 feet above the ground, after the manner of a cache. When it was considered expedient, they even left the body on the level ground, building a sort of little house or erecting a small tent over it. Since they had adopted the custom of burying underground, it has become a general practice among the Ten'a to erect these little houses or tents over the graves, and they are generally kept in very good order, being frequently visited and repaired by the relatives of the deceased. A few notes about death customs may be of value to the ethnologist. When a person dies, it is the custom of the friends, not the relatives, to wash the body and dress it in new clothes. When the native wife of one of the traders died at Hologochaket, we performed this service. At the request of the natives, we burned the clothing in which she had died although this would not have been necessary from our point of view. The body is supposed to be left in the house for four days, during the first twenty four hours of which (when the ghost is still near?) food must be placed beside it. We had not been told to provide food, and when the woman's parents finally arrived at the village a day later they were distressed by our neglect, which it was then too late to remedy. Friends also dig the grave, erect the grave house and cross, etc. In this case, the coffin and grave house were made on the third day, but the painting of the house was postponed until the fall, possibly because the natives were still busy fishing. The graveyard is always upstream from the village, and is generally on a hillside overlooking the village so that the dead can see all that goes on among the living. The land of the dead is supposed to be at the headwaters of the Yukon, and the dead journey thither under the river. For this reason, it is considered dangerous for anyone to travel upstream from a village in which a death has just occurred. And when a whole village moves away after an epidemic or other catastrophe the Indians say that they always go downstream. The property of the deceased and other valuables are distributed at a pot latch some months after death. Among the Koyukuk Indians these potlatches were prob ably not very elaborate affairs, though I was told that distributions of gifts did take place. On the lower river?Anvik and Hologochaket to Holy Cross?the Feast of the Dead was made the occasion for an elaborate masked per formance in the kashim.29 29 de Laguna, 1936c. Whymper also gives us some information about death customs of the Nulato Indians: These tribes mourn for the dead one year, and the women during that time often gather together, talking and crying over the deceased. At the expiration of that term they have a feast or "wake," and the mourning is over. . . . [He saw such a potlatch held at Nulato for a dead child. ] The poor mother and some of her friends wept bitterly, while the guests were gayly dancing around a painted pole, on which strings of beads and some magnificent wolf skins were hung. They kept up singing, dancing and feasting to a fashionable hour of the morning. . . . The decorations of the pole were divided among those who took part in the "wake."30 We have already quoted his description of the raised coffin. Jacobsen also reports on the burial customs of the Indians. At Sakara?somewhere between Blackburn and Anvik, perhaps at Old Grayling ... a famous shaman had died, and was to be buried the next day. Many Indians had already gathered to take part in the great burial feast. Among the Ingalik, as among the Kwikpagmut, the dead are buried after four days, and dur ing these four days no kind of work is performed. This is connected with a tradition about which I will write later. I had the rare and unexpected opportunity to see the dead. He was completely dressed, huddled up on a kind of stool that rested on four posts driven into the ground. Against two of these posts he leaned his back; the other two sup ported his arms. The house was otherwise completely empty, and there were in it only the wives of his friends and relatives, who came in with a lot of food and set it respect fully before the dead. It really looked as if the shaman, whose eyes were half open like those of a meditatively gaz ing man, were still alive, and as if he were about to savor the many dried salmon, the fish oil, and the berries. During this time no man durst enter the death house, although no one forbade me from doing so. The Indians were outside in front of the house in a depressed, solemn, earnest mood; no one laughed or ventured to speak loudly. Unfortunately my time was so limited that I could not attend the death so lemnities. An attempt to buy ethnographic specimens from the people was unsuccessful. First they told me that they had nothing to sell, then that they did not dare carry on any trade because of the death of the shaman.31 An epidemic had visited the village, and many had died. In another house Jacobsen saw a corpse propped up; food was being passed around among many people. Osgood reports that the Ingalik (Tena be tween Blackburn and Holy Cross) were accus tomed to keep the corpse in the kashim for four days following the death. It was bound in a sit ting position, wrapped in the sleeping skin or grass mat, and was propped against four posts. On one of these poles was tied a clay pot (con taining food?). When the corpse was removed, it was carried through the smoke of a piece of birch bark burned on the floor, in order to drive 30 Whymper, 1869, p. 207. 31 Jacobsen, 1884, pp. 196 ff., my translation.</page><page sequence="93">86 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 away evil spirits, and was hoisted up through the smokehole. A rock was left in its place (in the kashim, or in the house where the deceased died), in order to make the building appear as impervious as stone to any evil spirit that might want to enter. Outside the kashim the coffin was waiting, and the body was put into that, and carried to the coffin rack at the edge of the graveyard, where it rested until the season for building the coffin house. If it was to be a simple interment, the body was placed in the open grave immediately. The persons who as sisted in building, and the artist who painted the coffin house had to take a sweat bath after wards. These persons might or might not be related to the deceased. The friend of the dead person who fired the pyre and tended the crema tion had to take a sweat bath every five days for a twenty-day period, and during this time might eat no fresh food. If the surviving house mates of the deceased were sickly, the shaman might suggest purifying the house in which he died with a little fire of birch bark. Dried dog salmon heads might be put in the corners of the house to frighten away evil spirits by barking. If a number of children had died in the house the shaman might whip the floor and walls with a switch of wild roses. The house might be burned down following the death of an adult or of several children. Persons who had been away from the village during the death of a close relative might, upon their return, signify their grief by thrusting bone skewers through their arm muscles.32 Osgood also mentions the death potlatch, but does not describe it in this volume. Jette has mentioned a few practices connected with the mourning feast for the dead. For this the natives build a "nutsil," an enclosure of poles, some 8 or 10 feet high, gen erally in the form of a square, of about 20 feet on the sides, erected expressly for the mourning feasts, among the Ten'a of the upper tribe [Koyukuk]. Twice a day, in the morning and evening, a fire is made within the enclosure, and food cooked over it for the whole village. This is distributed on the spot, each one coming with a plate or dish to receive his portion. The devout ones throw a bit of this portion into the fire, to benefit the soul of the person for whom the feast is being celebrated.33 It was by no means unusual to have races at a mourn ing feast.34 82 Osgood, 1940, pp. 308, 410 f., 416 f., 429. 83 Jett6, 1908, p. 336, in explanation of a story told by a native from Tsenoketlarten on the Koyukuk River. 84 Op. tit., p. 487, in explanation of a story told by a na tive from Nelenoradol'oten, 2 miles below Nulato. Songs are always composed and sung in mourn ing for the dead. A typical song consists of one or two sentences, couched in very good language, praising the dead person, but without any perceptible meter and generally quite prosaic.36 COMPARISONS WITH OTHER PEOPLES Of the various methods of corpse disposal described above, only inhumation under the house floor is known to be prehistoric. Flexed inhumation is known from Cook Inlet (Kache mak Bay II), Prince William Sound and Kodiak Island, and from the Aleut, Ainu and Eyak, and was probably widespread on the Northwest Coast before cremation was adopted. It is re ported from the Coast and Interior Salish, and from there we can trace it into the Plateaus, down into California, and into Mexico.36 How ever, though flexed inhumation has a wide dis tribution, burial in a house is less well repre sented in the North Pacific area. Among the Eskimo it appears sporadically, and we may suspect that most cases in which the dead ap pear to have been interred in a house are really due to the abandonment of the house with the corpse in it, generally after an epidemic or famine, when proper disposal of the dead was impossible. However, Collins reports what may be true inhumation in the house, from Old Bering Sea or Early Punuk, Punuk, and modern times on St. Lawrence Island.37 The Aleut often buried their dead in a flexed or squatting position in a compartment of the house, but the building was not necessarily abandoned.38 Among both the prehistoric Ainu of Japan and the ancient inhabitants of Formosa, the dead were often interred in the house, which was subsequently abandoned.39 The Great Bear Lake Athabaskans sometimes buried their dead in a squatting position in the thawed ground under the tipi fire.40 The Lillooet, Thompson, and Shuswap sometimes buried the dead in a sitting attitude in a house pit, eventu ally adding other members of the family. The original choice of the site, as among the Great Bear Lake Indians, was dictated because the house floor was the only thawed ground avail 36 Op. cit., p. 367, explanation of a Koyukuk story. 36 de Laguna, 1934, pp. 163 f.; Birket-Smith and de La guna, 1938, pp. 472 ff. 37 Collins, 1937a, pp. 76,186,188. 38 Dall, 1878, p. 7; Jochelson, 1925, p. 49. 39 Munro, 1911, p. 87; Miyasaka and Yawata, 1927, PL 3. 40 Osgood, 1933, p. 80.</page><page sequence="94">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 87 able in winter for digging the grave.41 Among the Alsea of the Oregon coast, the wealthy might be interred under the house, which was then burned down.42 Perhaps the inhumations in House 11, Old Fish Camp, were made there because it was the only easily excavated ground. If that is true, this would argue that inhuma tion outside the house was customary on the Yukon at that time, just as it is now. Instead of the present form of burial being a recent innovation, it may well have been a return to a custom older than ensepulture in a raised cof fin?an old custom which perhaps had never completely lapsed. Osgood's information about Ingalik customs seems to confirm this view. If, on the other hand, we are to regard the choice of the house as the significant feature, which is also suggested by Osgood's report that mur dered persons were buried in houses, then we may explain the Yukon practice as being only one instance of an old and widespread circum Pacific trait. We have described the use of coffins resting either directly on the ground or slightly raised on stringers (horizontal logs). Nelson figures a box coffin at St. Michael, resting on stringers, with four poles projecting above it, bound to gether by two pierced cross planks.43 He men tions driftwood coffins on the ground at Cape Vancouver, Cape Nome and Point Hope. Pet roff illustrates a Togiak Eskimo grave at Bristol Bay.44 The painted coffin rests on the ground, a painted post is erected at the head, and several salmon figures are set on stakes near by. Osgood says that the Great Bear Lake, Chipewyan, Mackenzie River and Slave Athabaskans put the dead in a "ground cache," or "tomb of wood," together with grave goods and food.45 I am not sure, however, whether these are true wooden coffins. Sepulture "in boxes set upon posts" is reported from Cook Inlet, but we do not know how old the custom is there.46 A pre historic Aleut tomb of wood containing several 41 Thompson (Teit, 1900, p. 336). Lillooet (Teit, 1906, p. 270).

This description fits the semi subterranean winter house. 42 Information from Dr. Melville Jacobs, University of Washington. 43 E. W. Nelson, 1899, Fig. 100, pp. 317, 320, 322. 44 Petroff, 1884, PI.

I think we may consider the wooden canoe used as a coffin as a specialized development from the coffin made of a hollow log. We may also consider the grave house in which the coffin is placed as a special development of the outer coffin. Among the Haida, the coffin containing the body (not necessarily that of a shaman) was often placed in the clan grave house, or set on a carved wooden figure resting on the ground.49 The Clayoquot Nootka formerly put the cof fined (?) bodies of commoners in caves, while the placing of the coffin in a shed-like grave house is modern.60 The Lower Thompson placed the dead in family grave "houses," which were "scarcely more than large boxes with sloping roofs," supported on posts.51 The Middle Columbia Salish below the mouth of the Snake River and the Upper Chinook had family burial houses.52 The southern Kwakiutl put the dead in canoes.53 Among the Snohomish and Snuqualmi the canoe containing the deceased was sometimes left on the ground under a shed.54 The Klallam sometimes laid out the dead under a shed or under a canoe.55 The Lower Chinook used either a box or from one to three canoes to hold the corpse. These were set on stagings or in trees.56 The Alsea sometimes put the dead between two canoes, covering the body inside with earth.57 The Lillooet even substituted a large coiled basket for the coffin.58 Coffins very similar to those of the Tena were used by the Yakut.59 On the first of those il lustrated by Jochelson we can see that the four posts at the corner rise above the top of the coffin, just as on the coffin burial figured by 47 Weyer, 1929. 48 Niblack, 1890, p. 355; Bancroft, 1875, p. 113. 49 Swanton, 1905, pp. 52, 132. 60 Koppert, 1930, pp. 106, 112 f. 51 Teit, 1900, p. 335; Ray, 1939, p. 65. 62 Lewis, 1906, p. 190. 63 Jenness, 1934, p. 343. 54 Haeberlin and Gunther, 1930, p. 53. 55 Gunther, 1927, p. 248. 56 Ray, 1939, pp. 75 ff., Fig. 8, and PL 3. 57 Information from Dr. Melville Jacobs, University of Washington. *8 Ray, 1939, p. 67. 69 Jochelson, 1926, Pis.

Both Yakut coffins are double, with dirt between the inner and outer box, as was reported from the lower Tena. The Goldi of the lower Amur put the dead in a plank or hollow log coffin inside an elaborately carved grave house, with gable roof and door at the end. The Orochi at the mouth of the Amur put the coffined dead on platforms in communal grave houses.60 The Gilyak put the body of a person killed by a bear in a shed, built near the scene of the accident.61 The grave house is also used on the upper Amur and on the upper Sungari by the Daurian Tungus, although we do not know whether the corpse is enclosed in a coffin or whether it is buried under the house. In any case, the grave house is reported from the Amur Tungusians in Chinese annals as far back as 1100 B.C.62 The Ainu of Sakhalin Island also placed their mummies in a grave house, but we do not know whether a coffin was used.63 The coffin resting on the ground, must in any case, be considered as a variant of the elevated coffin. The raised coffin is reported from the Eskimo directly contiguous to the Tena. Thus Zagoskin writes: The Kvihpak [Yukon] and Kuskokwim natives buried the dead ones in small boxes, with bending feet toward the stomach, the boxes wrapped in birchbark. Those coffins are placed on four posts of five feet high and to the face side they nailed a sort of shield which is four or six feet square, on this board they paint the occupation of the deceased man as his bidar, if he is a good hunter the picture of deer or beaver are painted, etc. On the front of the grave the lances and spears are driven into the ground, the bidarki is placed too.64 He also mentions the Feast of the Dead and the inviting of namesakes of the deceased from great distances. The Eskimo and Indians enter tained each other at these celebrations. Dall and Nelson describe and illustrate elaborate coffins of the lower Yukon Eskimo.65 Some of these are supported by four corner posts and one central post. Another arrangement is a double-decker structure of two coffins, sup ported by four posts which rise above the upper coffin, and to which grave goods are attached. The structure is ornamented with bone pegs, 60 Ravenstein, 1861, pp. 385 f., fig. on p. 386; Lattimore, 1933, p. 51; Czaplicka, 1914, p. 156. 61Czaplicka,1914,p.l53. 62 Ravenstein, 1861, pp. 4,351,364. ?* Op. tit.,?. 397. 64 Zagoskin (1935), p. 296. ?

Only a few elevated coffins are reported from Cape Nome, which seems to mark their northern boundary among the Eskimo. Of these coffins Nelson writes: In ancient times the Unalit of this vicinity [St. Michael] ex posed their dead on the open tundra back of the village, throwing their weapons and tools beside them. It was the custom to lay the body at full length on its back and plant two sticks about three feet long, one on each side of the head, so that they would cross over the face. The old man who told me this said that everyone used to be thrown on the ground in this manner, but he thought that it was from seeing the grave boxes made for the dead in other places that the Unalit had been led to adopt the present custom. The use of grave boxes undoubtedly came from the south, as it was observed that their greatest elaboration was found south of the territory occupied by the Unalit [i.e. in the Yu kon and Kuskokwim deltas], while to the northward the Malemut [of Norton Bay and Kotzebue Sound] still throw out many of their dead. My informant added that it was better to keep the dead in grave boxes, for it kept their shades from wandering about as they used to do; besides, it was bad to have the dogs eat the bodies.66 Elevated coffins are not found among the Pacific Eskimo or Aleut, and are rare among the Tanaina. The Tanaina of Kenai, however, used grave houses for chiefs and important persons.67 The Kutchin put the bodies of chiefs and important persons in coffins which they placed in trees until the flesh had rotted from the bones. Then the remains were cremated.68 This may indicate that box sepulture was older here than cremation, since it was retained in secondary form for honored personages. We are not sure whether the practices reported from the Great Bear Lake and the Lower Liard Athabaskans involves the use of coffins or only of open scaffolds.69 The Sekani used elevated coffins for important persons, prior to the intro duction of cremation.70 Among the Lower Thompson, the dead were put on a scaffold, sometimes in coffins, or they might be put into a large family coffin set on posts. This was a box with a lid, and was sometimes furnished with a pitched roof.71 The Haida sometimes put their dead in coffins raised on a single tall post.72 Boas reports that among the Tsimshian the 66 E.

The Clayoquot Nootka used to put the chief's coffin in a tree, and Koppert believes that this is the oldest form of burial.75 Among the Puget Sound Salish, the canoe containing the body was sometimes set in a tree or on four posts.76 The Clackamas (Upper Chinook) placed the burial canoe on a trestle, and the Lower Chinook used both elevated coffins and canoes.77 Scaffold exposure was practiced by the Uriankhai Altai (for shamans and persons killed by lightning, sometimes for ordinary persons among the Altai), Yukaghir, Yakut, and Buriat (sometimes for shamans).78 Elevated coffins were used by the Transbaikal Orochon, Yukag hir, Yakut and Tungus; sometimes the coffin was set into a dugout canoe, sometimes the canoe itself served as a coffin.79 Often the cof fin was put inside an elevated grave house, and this grave house is called by the Yukaghir by the same name as the elevated box cache, with which it is practically identical in form. The Orochi Tungusians at the mouth of the Amur put the coffin of a poor person in a tree, and the reindeer-herding Oroke of Sakhalin do the same. The Kamchadal put the body of a child in a hollow tree; the Buriat sometimes treat the corpse of a shaman in the same way, while the Uriankhai Altai do this to the corpse of an ordinary person.80 Of all the coffins seen on the Amur, Lattimore reports that the Chinese form seems to have been evolved from a hollow log.81 This would link it with the hollow log tombs of the Yukaghir, Yakut and Yakutized Tungus, who even go so far as to use a dugout canoe for 73 Boas, 1916, p. 442. 74 Porter, 1893, p. 60. 76 Koppert, 1930, p. 106; Jenness, 1934, p. 347. 76 Haeberlin and Gunther, 1930, p. 53 (Snohomish, Snuqualmi, Nisqually). 77 Ray, 1938, pp. 75 f.; Information from Dr. Melville Jacobs, University of Washington. 78 Czaplicka, 1914, pp. 161 f., 145, 156. 79 Op. tit., p. 155, Pis. 14 and 15; Jochelson, 1926, pp. 223 f. (the passage is not clear), 225. 80 Ravenstein, 1861, pp. 386, 399; Czaplicka, 1914, pp. 145, 156,162. 81 Lattimore, 1933, p. 51. Some of the hollow stone cof fins of the Iron Age Japanese also look as if they had had the same origin. a coffin. A similar substitution of the birch bark canoe for the coffin has already been noted for some of the Tena, and the substitution of the dugout, among the southern Northwest Coast tribes. Actually we do not know whether they formerly used a coffin and then replaced it with the canoe, or whether the idea of using the canoe as a coffin reached them at the same time as the idea of ensepulture. Lattimore also suggests that the Manchu coffin may have evolved from a grave house.82 There is no doubt that the grave house and the coffin are intimately connected, and no matter which we take to be the ancestral form, they seem to have traveled side by side, mu tually influencing each other. I do not think that the distribution of the practice of en sepulture in an elevated coffin or grave house can be understood without reference to that of the elevated box cache. Grave houses are found among the Tena, Kutchin, Tanaina, Eyak, Aleut, Tlingit, Haida, Kwakiutl, Bella Coola, Cowichan, Klallam, Quinault, Alsea, Tahltan, Carrier, Shuswap, Thompson, Nez Perce, Mid dle Columbia Salish, but they may hold either the corpse or the cremated ashes.83 Elevated box caches and grave houses show a remarkable similarity of distribution in both the Old World and the New. The dead seem to be disposed of . in the manner in which one would preserve meat, i.e., by putting the corpse in an elevated cache out of the reach of animals. The wooden tomb on the ground is probably one that was formerly elevated. In fact, the four posts rising above the coffins of the Yakut and Yukon Eskimo suggest this. I do not mean to say that the underlying motivation for box burial was in every case a desire to preserve the body. As the Eskimo explained to Nelson, it was also useful to prevent the ghost from wandering, as well as for keeping dogs away. Yet other analogies between burial customs and the ways of handling food stuffs might be mentioned. Thus, platform exposure is comparable to tree caches or drying racks, and inhumation to pit caches, especially where the corpse is actually interred in an old storage pit. In discussing mummification, and in criticizing Elliot Smith's theory of a diffusion from Egypt, Dixon draws a similar analogy. The actual methods employed [for "mummification"] were 82 Ibid. 83 Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, p. 474.</page><page sequence="97">90 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 everywhere simple, wholly natural, comparable to those used in preserving meat, and only what must have been done were any attempt made to keep the body. Numerous other methods, such as packing the body in lime, sealing it in a coffin, etc., are not mentioned by Smith or Perry, but are examples of the fact that a number of ways were tried out.84 I conceive of the box cache, the grave house, the elevated or above-ground coffin, and the dugout canoe as all being historically intercon nected and as all belonging to a circum-Pacific culture drift, probably from the Old World to the New. There is no evidence that they have ever belonged to the northern Alaskan Es kimo; in fact, we have specific data from Nelson that the coffin traveled from south to north in the Bristol Bay-Norton Sound area. Lack of suitable wood would certainly have prevented the building of any dugout canoe north of the Alaska Peninsula or north of the Yukon delta. It would seem, therefore, as if this circum-Pa cific culture drift must have traveled from Asia to America via the Aleutian Islands. This hypothesis will gain support if we can show what may have been other traits belonging to this culture drift. However, this hypothesis is weakened by the apparent fact that the first American peoples to receive these culture traits from Asia, the Aleut and Pacific Eskimo, often made much less of them than did either the Northwest Coast Indians or the Tena and Tanaina. This is certainly true of the coffin, grave house, and box cache, and, as we shall see later, it is true of other elements that seem to belong to the same culture drift. Perhaps there were some special forces at work, the nature of which we do not as yet understand, that made it possible for the Aleut and Pacific Eskimo to pass on certain ideas without them selves retaining them into historic times. Since we shall discuss this matter again, we need only refer to it here. Inhumation under a grave house requires a special explanation. Very often this type of burial is the result of Christianity: the old grave house that used to hold the body above ground is retained as a relic of pagan tradition. Thus, the Christianized Yakut erect a log cabin over the grave, embellishing it with a cross at the head, or build over the grave an octagonal house with a cupola surmounted by a cross. This last structure is built in imitation of the Russian church.85 On Cook Inlet all the grave 84 Dixon, 1928, pp. 220 f. 85 Jochelson, 1926, p. 229, PL XV. houses that I saw seemed to be modern. On the other hand, there are examples of inhumation under grave houses that seem to be truly ab original. Thus the Eyak not only used grave houses to hold the ashes of the deceased, but, if the corpse was buried in the ground (an alterna tive practice), they built a house over the grave.86 The Gilyak bury the ashes of the dead in a vessel and over it erect a small house with window and door, in which are placed the skull, part of the hair and clothing, food, smoking equipment, and a doll dressed in silk.87 The Wishram made family burial vaults by con structing huts with shed roofs over shallow pits.88 The Sekani originally built a brush hut over the grave.89 The Upper Thompson and Shuswap erected tipis of brush, bark, skins or mats over the grave.90 The Coos buried their dead in coffins under a gable plank roof.91 The Vogul and Ostyak of the upper Ob buried their dead in a boat or boat-shaped coffin and set up a roof of branches to shelter the grave and grave goods.92 It may be that in all these cases we have a degeneration of the grave house, which was originally elevated, even though we cannot ascribe the degeneration to Christian teachings which demanded inhumation. In the case of the Tena, I believe that the grave house over the interment has degenerated in function from the container of the corpse to the container of only a few grave goods. Certain features of the Tena grave houses were probably introduced by the Russians. These are the cross, the cupola and fret-work ornaments, and later the gable roof, all of them features which may be duplicated in the ceme teries of the Christianized Yakut. Perhaps the picket fence was also adopted from the Rus sians. The custom of setting up a pole or marking a tree by the grave seems to be very widespread, and the pole or tree often bears offerings to the dead, or his belongings. Thus, the Chugach Eskimo of Prince William Sound told us that they used to lob a tree and set up the digging stick that had been used to make the grave. The Kodiak Eskimo set up a few poles beside the grave, the Central Eskimo erect one, and 86 Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, pp. 166 ff. 87 Czaplicka, 1914, p. 152. 88 Spier and Sapir, 1930, pp. 271 f. 89 Jenness, 1934, p. 382. 90 Ray, 1939, pp. 62 f. 91 Information from Dr. Melville Jacobs, University of Washington. 92 Czaplicka, 1914, p. 164.</page><page sequence="98">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 91 the natives of St. Lawrence and Nunivak Is lands set one up obliquely or lay it on the ground.93 On Norton Sound these posts seem to be more elaborate. At St. Michael, a paddle with "totem marks" was set up to identify the grave. Grave goods were hung from the corner posts that projected above the coffin, and from other posts.94 The Naskapi put up a branch beside the grave; the Cree and the Chipewyan set up a pole with a deerskin hanging from the top.95 The Great Bear Lake and Dog Rib Athabaskans set up a pole with streamers to amuse the ghost and keep it close to the grave.96 Of the Lower Thompson, Teit writes: "Streamers were flying from the tops of the poles as a token of respect for the deceased."97 While the Upper Thompson hung grave goods, streamers and flags from the grave poles, the Athabaskans of Nicola Lake had grave goods tied to the poles, and the Kutenai laid a pole on each side of the grave. The Fraser River band of the Lillooet often set up four poles, tipi fashion, from which they hung grave goods.98 Among the offerings tied to poles by the Shuswap were the favorite dog and the tails of horses eaten at the funeral feast.99 The Middle Columbia Salish set up a pole at the head of the interred body with a few grave goods tied to it.100 The Makah set up the tools used to dig the grave.101 The Nisqually set up dance paddles at the grave; the Sanpoil and Nespellem, two or three small split cedar sticks; the Kalapuya, a scaffold with "killed" baskets hanging from it.102 The Ainu cut off the top of a tree near the grave and erect an inao (prayer stick). The Ainu of Hokkaido also mark the graves of women with a plain post, the graves of men with a post carved like a spear, and tie rags of some kind to them.103 The Goldi of the 93 Chugach (field notes, 1933), Kodiak (Dall, 1878, p. 31), Central Eskimo (Birket-Smith, 1929, II, pp. 40 f.), St. Law rence Island (W.

Amur hang up grave goods and food near the tomb of a shaman.104 The Uriankhai Altai set up a pole with the top carved like a cup near the hollow tree containing the corpse.105 The Tun gus hang the belongings of the deceased, to gether with the remains of the sacrificed rein deer and dog, to a post or posts near the ele vated coffin.106 Since the pole at the grave seems to have a much wider distribution in the New World than in the Old, we would naturally assume it to be of American origin. However, it is possi ble that it was once much more common in Asia, and has since been abandoned. The totem poles erected in honor of the dead, the carved grave posts and the heraldic orna mentation of grave houses on the Northwest Coast are so well known as to need no further comment. Even though the high development of carving is fairly recent, there must have been ancient grave carvings in this area from which the elaborate ones have evolved; the former are related to the simpler grave carvings of the Eyak, Carrier, Tahltan, Wishram, Thompson and Alaskan Eskimo.107 It is with these simpler grave images found on the peripheries of the Northwest Coast area that the animal and bird carvings at Tena graves should be compared. Among the Northwest Coast tribes, and per haps among the Eyak,108 the images at the grave indicated the moiety or clan affiliations of the dead person. Images at the graves of other peoples seem to have had a different sig nificance. The Tena images may represent either the familiar spirits of the dead shaman or the game pursued by the hunter. Perhaps it would not be too rash to suggest that the clan animals of the Northwest Coast were in origin guardian spirits that became associated with a whole social group, instead of remaining simply the helpers of one individual or one shaman. In this connection we may cite the posts (toro) set up in front of the Goldi shaman's houses. Lat timore remarks: "It is at once suggestive of a totem pole."109 The post is carved with a num ber of human and animal and bird figures, "divinities [that] keep guard 'over the whole house and courtyard.'" They seem to be not 104 Ravenstein, 1861, p. 386. 105 Czaplicka, 1914, p. 162. 106 Op. tit., p. 155. 107 Wishram (Ray, 1939, p. 65), others (Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, pp. 378 f.). 108 Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, pp. 167 f. 109 Lattimore, 1933, pp. 56 f., Fig. 3b; Ravenstein, 1861, p. 337 and fig., and p. 383.</page><page sequence="99">92 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 only the shaman's familiars, but "are most probably linked with the ancestral cult." Asso ciated with these posts are small stakes with animal and bird figures at the top, quite similar to those set up at Tungus shamans' graves to represent the guardian spirits of the deceased. The Goldi toro thus seem to stand half way be tween images representing an individual sha man's guardian spirits and the clan crests of the Northwest Coast totem pole. Nelson has given us considerable information about the carvings and paintings at Eskimo graves in the Bristol Bay-Norton Sound area. Some of the paintings are supposed to be "totemic." Others represent the animals which the dead person's father excelled in hunting. If the father had been a warrior, a bow would be painted. If the deceased had been unpopular, no painting would be made.110 We have already mentioned the graves described by Nelson on the lower Yukon that had pictures of a man shooting at an animal, and pictures of animal skins. The Togiak Eskimo of Bristol Bay set up figures of salmon on stakes near the grave.111 On the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, memorial images were erected by the Eskimo to com memorate the dead whose bodies had not been recovered. These were in the shape of human figures, with offerings hanging from their arms. Some are described as representing women with four arms and real hair. Other memorials are posts, hung with masks and grave goods. There are also posts with small animal carvings at the top, like those made by the Tena. All of these memorials seem to have been set up in the cemetery.112 The abundance of carved figures in the graveyards of this district, as was noted also among the adjacent Tinne" of the lower Yukon, is very remarkable, and their use does not ex tend northward of the Yukon in a single instance, so far as could be learned. However, Murdoch reports animal figures at the graves at Port Clarence, near Bering Strait.113 The wooden images and effigies at Aleut graves should probably not be compared with the Eskimo grave carvings just mentioned. MacLeod believes that the Aleut images were copied from those of the Ainu, and that they 110 E. W. Nelson, 1899, pp. 311 f. 111 Petroff, 1884, PL IV. 112 Porter, 1893, pp. 104 ff., 109; E. W. Nelson, 1899, pp. 316 ff., Fig. 104. 113 E. W. Nelson, 1899, p. 319, Fig. 105; Murdoch, 1892, p. 426. were substitutes for the slaves that were for merly killed to accompany their master into the next world. This complex of slavery and fun erary slave sacrifice he believes was diffused from Asia to the Northwest Coast, via the Aleutian Islands,114 which seems quite likely, since such offerings go back to the Shang Bronze Age in China.115 Turning south and inland from the highest center of Northwest Coast culture, we not only find memorial columns made by the Carrier, Tahltan, and Sekani in imitation of the North west Coast totem poles, but simpler images. Thus the Carrier erected animal figures, repre senting totems, on the roof of the grave house.116 The Interior Salish commonly set up effigies at their graves.117 The Thompson might make either an image of the deceased with clothes and offerings, or carvings of birds and animals.118 The Clayoquot Nootka set up animal figures at the chief's grave to illustrate his powers.119 The Wishram put up carved wooden images around the grave house or painted its planks to represent men and animals.120 The coffins of the Lower Chinook were supported on posts painted to represent anthropomorphic figures.121 In Asia, we can find a few examples of similar figures. Thus the Tungus set up loon figures on the posts supporting the coffin and on nearby stakes to represent the guardian spirits of the dead shaman.122 As already mentioned, these carvings are very similar in style to the animal and bird figures set on stakes in front of the house of the living Goldi shaman. When the latter dies (it is not clear whether this applies to ordinary persons also), an image of the de ceased is made to hold the soul for a while. It is finally broken in order to let the ghost escape to the underworld.123 The Gilyak set the image of a cuckoo on the grave house above the cremated remains; the picture of a bird or a fish may be drawn with charcoal on the lid of a Vogul coffin before burial.124 114 MacLeod, 1925, p. 146; 1929, p. 109.

It is immaterial for our study whether the original center was in Asia or on the Northwest Coast, since our Yukon Indian examples are only peripheral. If the original impulse came from Asia, the Northwest Coast was certainly an important secondary center of diffusion, for the prestige-display associated with chiefs was responsible for the elaboration of the carvings made at the death of a chief and at the assump tion of his honors and prerogatives by his heir. The human effigies at graves might also be explained by the Goldi practice. Was the effigy made in order to attach the ghost to the grave so that it would not wander about and bother the living? It will be remembered that the flapping streamers also served to amuse the ghost and thus would have had a similar func tion. An attempt at mummification was described by an Indian from the lower Koyukuk. This involved evisceration and subsequent desicca tion in a cache. I cannot vouch for the authen ticity of this report, since it was not verified by other informants, by the accounts of early travelers, or by archaeological evidence. Nor was I told what was supposed to be the ultimate disposal of the body. Cave deposition may be safely excluded, since there are practically no caves in this area, and the one which we visited contained no skeletal remains. If there really was some form of mummification we must, I suppose, link it to similar practices of the Aleut and Pacific Eskimo. These again are similar to those of the Tsimshian, who sometimes evis cerated the body and stuffed the cavity with cedar bark, and also to practices of the Ainu.125 James mentions other examples from North and Central America but they do not seem to have any bearing on our problem. He writes: The elaborate methods of mummification practiced by the Aleut and Kadiak appear to represent a diffusion from Asia rather than a development of the Tsimshian attempts at preservation.126 It would seem more likely that the Tsimshian custom represents a peripheral survival, iso lated because of the growth of other methods of corpse disposal on the Northwest Coast. 125 Boas, 1916, p. 442, MacLeod, 1925, pp. 146 f.; Raven stein, 1861, p. 397; de Laguna, 1934, p. 164. 126 James, 1928, p. 216. The practice of cremation on the lower Koyu kuk and lower Yukon finds its closest parallels among the Kutchin and Tanaina. The Kutchin either abandon the ashes or tie them in a bag to a pole which is fastened to a stump.127 The Tanaina of Kachemak Bay and Kenai bury the ashes under a pole; at Iliamna the ashes may be buried or saved; on the upper Inlet the place of cremation was fenced in and a pole was set up with food and traveling equipment; at Tyonek the ashes were hung on a tree.128 In Prince William Sound, we found burned human bones in a cave which may be either evidence of cre mation or of cannibalism. Hrdlicka reports a case of what may have been cremation from the "intermediate" period of Kodiak Island, i.e., late Kachemak Bay III.129 Cremation was practiced by the Eyak, Tlingit, Haida, Tsim shian, Northern Kwakiutl, Tahltan, Tsetsaut, Carrier, Chilcotin, Klamath, and sometimes by the Shuswap, Thompson, Takelma, Owens Val ley Paiute, etc. It is also practiced by the Chukchee, Koryak, Gilyak, Altai, Yakut, and Buriat.130 It was introduced into Japan along with Buddhism about a.d. 700.131 A number of authors have discussed the question of linking the northern center of cremation in northwest ern North America with that in the southwest and Mexico. Thus, James conceives of crema tion among the Tsimshian as representing a secondary center in the north, to which the practice penetrated from the south, and Mac Leod also believes that cremation, the sib and the labret had a more southern source and later diffused from the northern part of the North west Coast, possibly to Northeastern Asia.132 The problem is complicated by the fact that there are actually only a limited number of methods of disposing of a corpse. If the body is to be destroyed like refuse, it can be exposed and abandoned to the elements and to animals, interred, or burned. Doubtless cremation has been independently practiced in many different areas. In any case, the Koyukuk custom can be considered, as may also the Kutchin and Tanaina practices, as peripheral occurrences on 127 Osgood, 1936, pp. 145, 149. 128 Osgood, 1937, p. 166. 129 Hrdlicka, 1935, p. 52. 130 Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, pp. 471 f.; Czaplicka, 1914, pp. 161, 156 f., 152. 131 Chamberlain, 1905, p. 108. 132 James, 1928, p. 230; MacLeod, 1925, pp. 127 f.

Travelers report permanent villages with semi subterranean houses built of logs, and roofed with bark and turf, from all the Yukon tribes which we visited, with the exception of the Tanana, but give few details of construction. Dall however, specifies for the Un'a-kho-tana, between Tanana and Ruby (or, as we should say, between Tanana and the Nowitna), that "their houses are less solidly built and less per manent than those of the Lowlanders [Nulato to Holy Cross]."1 Of the Tanana Indians, Schwatka reports: "Their habitations, except among the Indians living near the mouth, are very temporary, being made of moose skins in winter, and generally of a lighter and less substantial character even than this in summer. Near the mouth of the [Tanana] river some of the tribe have underground houses, such as are in use among the Innuits, and are called by the Russians 'barraboras.' "2 Zagoskin says of the Tena: Concerning their winter houses, construction of which is similar to the sea shore people [Eskimo], especially when some Ttinaytz tribe came in close relationship with this tribe. So far the Inkilik, Ulukag-mut and Takaiksa tribes [Tena below Nulato, or does he include the lower Koyu kuk?] build their barabara and kasima by same construc tion as sea shore tribe of Chang-mut, that is with very narrow rooms and low sleeping bunks. The Ug-elnut tribe [Tena below Blackburn and on the Kuskokwim] which was in close relationship with the Kvihpak and Kuskokwim tribes build their houses by this way. The Ttinaytz-Un naka-Hotana and Tlegon-Hotana [upper Innoko Tena] do not have any bunks at all, they are inclined to the nomadic life, as is general to all people who spend their life in hunting animals.3 The inference is that their houses are less well furnished because they are occupied for such short periods. Zagoskin also mentions their summer houses "which are built in haste from brush-wood and bark, this primitive shelter hardly protects from rain or sun." Whymper describes the houses at Igtigalik or New Ulukuk on the upper Unalaklik, or more properly, the Ulukuk River. 1 Dall, 1877a, p. 28; see also Petroff, 1884, p. 161; Porter, 1893, p. 126. 2 Schwatka, 1885, p. 94. 3 Zagoskin (1935), pp. 335 f. On the right bank of the river we found a number of Indian summer dwellings?simple wooden shanties, built above ground, with a small doorway, sometimes circular, and a hole in the roof to let out the smoke. Behind them on posts were the fish-houses, or "caches," as before described. On the left bank were a few under-ground houses, in tended for winter use. These were simply square holes in the ground, roofed in, and earthed over. The entrance of each was a rude shanty of logs or planks, passing into which we found a hole in the ground, the entrance to the subter ranean passage . . . The passage-way into these houses was in wet mild weather nothing but a sewer. The fire was built on the floor in the center of the chamber, and when it burned low the embers and sticks were always thrown out of the smoke-hole in the roof by the natives inside, and it was then covered with a skin. This process effectively shut in all the warmth, but with it a good deal of smoke and carbonic acid gas. The entrance-hole was usually covered with a deer-skin.4 The text figure shows the entrance room (or porch, as Jette calls it) built of horizontal planks fastened to four corner posts that slant inward to make the structure like a truncated pyramid in shape. The long entrance passage is shown at the same level as the floor of the sub terranean inner room. The structure over this inner room is indicated as dome-shaped (prob ably due to the earth piled over it), with a square frame for the smokehole. The Indians that Whymper met at the mouth of the Nowitna ("Newicargut") were living in cotton tents "or in open booths, constructed of poles set up and tied together roof fashion, a few green boughs, pieces of birch-bark and skins covering them. Little fires were burning everywhere, to keep off the mosquitoes."5 Jette has given an excellent description of the arrangement of the Tena house. The only feature that he does not describe is the con struction of the roof. We reproduce two of Jette's sketches of the Yukon Indian house (Fig. 21). The lower has not previously been published. Jette writes: The porch was always river ward from the house. [We did not find this to be true in every case]. ... As appears in the first diagram, the roof protruded above the ground level, as a low mound of earth and sods. In the center was the opening, the letyi, or smoke-hole. Directly under this was the tlakat, or fire-place, a platform of beaten ground 4 Whymper, 1869, pp. 174 ff., fig. on p. 175. 6 Op. cit., p. 230. 95</page><page sequence="103">96 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 raised some 6 inches (or more) above the rest of the floor. [We did not find archaeological evidence of a raised fire place.] When the fire was lighted, the smoke-hole cover, made of fish skin or of guts, well-sewed together and stretched on a frame, was removed. It was replaced when the fire was put out, and the place, thus warmed, would retain its heat for a considerable time. The chimney-like hole afforded another entrance to the house, which was fre quently used, especially to introduce large or heavy objects VERTICAL SECTION.

On the lower section and plan the numbers represent: 1, door by which one descends into the porch, tsorotiyit; 2, porch or antechamber, lal; 3, tunnel, laldoyeka; 4, prolongation of the tunnel into the main room, ben. These are walls, three or four feet high, unroofed; 5, platform across the front, torftal, to accomodate the children, who ranked slightly above the no-account persons at the back of the house; 6, spaces along each side wall, to accomodate a family, bentoyar. These two families were usually related; 7, fire in the center, tlakat, on a raised platform of earth; 8, space opposite the door, yekatlot, to accomodate the aged, the unmarried, or the widowed?in general the in habitants of little importance; 9, smokehole directly above the fireplace, letyi. (The upper plan and section are from Jette, 1908, p. 307.) that would have been very inconvenient to drag through the tunnel. As the guts of which the cover was made were translucent, this opening also admitted some light into the dark interior. When the fire was burning, the smoke issued from the top of the mound as though it were coming out of the ground, hence the expression ro-le-re'o, "a smoke rises from the ground," to mean "there is a dwelling." The rear wall, opposite the entrance, was usually banked with a platform, or shelf, running along its whole length, and called yekatlot, yekatlona. This place was occupied by the old people and some of the unmarried ones; it was the lowest, or meanest position in the house. On the two sides of the entrance, between the ben, or projections of the tunnel-sides, and the side walls, were similar shelves, called torolkoda, or torltal; these were the sleeping places for the children and ranked next above the yekatlot. The sides of the house, called bentoyar, were the highest places, ranking above all others. On one of these, at mid-distance between the front and rear walls, the master of the house sat and slept. If he had only one wife, she sat between him and the entrance, as she had to go in and out to fetch things from the cache, and for her work, and Ten'a eti quette considers it impolite for a woman to pass in front of a man. Thus she was always on the river side of the man. If he had a second wife, she sat on the other side of the man, i.e., on his inland side. As she was of inferior rank, her pas sing in front of the husband was not considered to matter, she herself being of secondary importance. From this well established custom, the first wife, or wife proper, was styled yuta"ten, "the river-side one," and the second wife, or concubine, was called yunekSten, "the inland-side one." Two families usually shared the one house. Opposite the master of the house and his wife, or wives, sat the other family, in symmetrical arrangement. At Nulato the master of the house and his wives generally occupied the down stream side; on the Koyukuk river, and at Kokrines, they preferred the upstream side. This seems to have been left at their option. [Belongings were kept in the corners desig nated as "up-river," or "down-river."] A rather similar plan and section of the Tena winter house was published by Jette to il lustrate a Raven myth obtained on the Koyu kuk River. The native names for the various parts differ a little from those given in his manuscript, and the roof is clearly pyramidal in shape. There is no structure built over the end of the vertical shaft leading down to the outer end of the entrance tunnel. He writes:6 The winter dwellings of the Ten'a were formerly half underground, the roofs only projecting above the ground. They have two entrances, one through the chimney, "letyi," or aperture at the culminating point of the roof; it is often used in the stories; the other through an under ground tunnel some 10 to 20 feet long, in which one had to crawl on all fours: a hole in the ground gave access to it at the other end. They were invariably oriented parallel to the river, the entrance being in the upstream direction. Among the upper tribes, however, the entrance seems to have been facing the stream. The following rough diagram gives an idea of its shape and arrangement:?[see our Fig. 21, upper]. In our days the Ten'a have universally adopted the white man's log-cabin, but they still retain the orientation of the old times, and consequently have the door on the east side. Even this remnant of their former custom is, however, rapidly disappearing. 6 Jette, 1908, pp. 307 f.</page><page sequence="104">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 97 In explanation of another story from the Koyukuk River, Jette writes that the bunk shelf is rare in Tena houses, but common in those of the Eskimo. "It may have existed among the Ten'a who had intercourse with Eskimo tribes." The fire place is a foot or more lower than the floor (!). The elevated platform opposite the entrance of the house is where the master of the house and his family have their beds.7 It is difficult to reconcile these statements with those quoted above. We saw only one modern structure which in any way resembled the old underground houses, and this may have been a pit cache. It was a recently abandoned structure at the site on the west bank of the Yukon, 1 mile below Lower Kaltag. Here there were a number of pits about 6X9 feet, and one covered structure of the same size (PL IV, 1). The excavation is 4 feet deep. There are no walls rising above the ground. The earth had been cut away in front to make the entrance. A few boards across the open front of the pit made the doorway, 3X2| feet, with a high sill. Earth was banked against the front wall on each side of this opening. There was no floor other than the trampled earth inside, and no timbering to retain the sides of the hole. The roof beams ran from side to side, resting on the ground outside the pit, and on upright stakes at the front. These beams supported three layers of split poles, lying split side down and running from front to back. Over each layer of poles was a sheet of birch bark covered with sod. There was no provision for a fireplace inside and no smokehole. It appeared as if the hut had been occupied by someone, though it seems impossible that any human being could have lived in such a cramped and filthy hole. Osgood's information on Tena houses is the most complete. These refer specifically to those of the Ingalik. He describes in detail the large and small variants of the winter house; the kashim-like winter house; summer houses of planks, of split Cottonwood logs, of spruce bark, of birch bark, or of grass mats; gable-roofed smokehouses of spruce bark or of willows; shed like smokehouses; dome-shaped shelter used for a summer house or summer sweatbath lodge; willow tipi as a summer shelter; ridged tent of spruce boughs (or skins) as a winter or spring shelter; and lastly a winter shelter excavated in a snowdrift or built of snow blocks like an in verted V. One of our informants from Shageluk 7 Op. tit., pp. 334 f. also described the summer house of spruce bark, a fall house built of poles and grass, and a spring shelter like a ridged tent built of branches. One distinctive feature of the large and small variants of the Ingalik winter house as de scribed by Osgood, is that the excavated pit did not extend all the way to the edges of the slop ing roof, but left an unexcavated ledge on all four sides, interrupted only at the front by the opening for the entrance passage.8 The ledge in back is floored with split poles and may serve as a sleeping bench if three families occupy the house. The ledges at the two sides (or ends of the rectangular house) and across the front serve to support shelves for storing articles. The or dinary sleeping benches are built of poles across the sides or ends of the house, and are wide enough so that the occupants can sleep with their heads to the center of the room, and high enough from the ground so that an old woman may sleep under them. Generally two families would occupy a house, but the unmarried boys would sleep in the kashim. The interior arrange ments of the larger winter house are similar to those just described, except that the rear ledge is not wide enough to serve as a belich, but has to be widened into the room with a built-up portion. Four to six families might occupy the larger house, two families sharing a bench. The only other important difference between the two sizes of winter houses is that in the smaller, the roof is supported by four central posts, while in the larger, there is an extra pair of posts be tween the central supports and the ends, or sides, of the room. In each case, the side benches reach from the wall of the pit to the nearest pair of roof posts. Thus, in the small winter house there is only a small rectangle of clear floor space, not much wider than the entrance passage, and the fireplace is in the center of it. The excavated portion of the smaller winter house is 3J feet deep and about 16X10 feet, the longer dimensions being the front and back. The entrance passage leads out from the middle of the front edge of the pit for a distance of about 6 feet. It is as deep as the house pit, and is about 2\ feet wide ("a little wider than a person"). The total inside dimensions of the house, just under the edge of the sloping roof, are about 20X19 feet, to estimate from Os good's diagram, but the rear edge of the roof is only about 12 feet long, since the rear corners 8 Osgood, 1940, pp. 303-311.</page><page sequence="105">98 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 are cut off. The roof is supported by four posts set up inside the pit, one pair just inside the opening of the tunnel, the other pair opposite them against the rear edge of the pit. These support horizontal poles making a rectangular frame, against which are laid the roof poles which slant up from the surface of the ground outside the pit. The pitch of the roof is steepest at the front of the house, producing a roof that is shaped like an asymmetrical, truncated pyramid. The central part of the roof is prac tically flat, with an opening in the center for the smokehole. The height of the smokehole from the floor is only 1\ feet. The floor is of plain earth, the walls of the pit have no lining except grass mats. The roof is covered with grass and earth. The entrance passage or tunnel is roofed only with split poles. Since the inner part of the passage extends into the main room of the house, the roof of the passage connects the two earth ledges on each side. The outer end of the passage is open, and is furnished with a notched ladder for entrance and exit. This passage opens into a shed-like entryway, widest at the front and narrowed at the back. The sloping sides of this shed are covered with grass. Mats hang as doors in the outer doorway of the entry shed, in the doorway between the entryway and the opening of the entrance passage, and at the inner end of the passage. Since the larger winter house has six posts instead of four, and since the pairs at the ends (or sides) of the house are shorter than those in the middle, the roof has a more rounded slope from the sides to the flat center than from the front or rear to the center. The excavated pit for these larger houses measures 25X18X4 feet deep. The fireplace in these winter houses was simply a space in the center of the floor, but in spring, when there might be water on the floor, the fireplace could be built up with earth to a height of about a foot. The kashim-like winter house is built under the direction of a very rich man and would be occupied by several families.9 There were only a few of these among the Ingalik. It is like a kashim, except that the entrance passage and shed-like entryway are like those of ordinary winter houses; there is no tunnel leading from the entrance into the firepit; the benches around the walls are wide enough so the occupants can 90/&gt;.?7.,pp.311f. sleep with their heads towards the center of the room; and, while the walls of the excavation are faced with split poles, these are driven into the earth floor, not mortised into base logs. The roof is cribbed, like that of the kashim; there is a pit for the fire, 6 feet square and 2 feet deep; and the floor (except for the spaces under the benches) is covered with split poles, resting on joists. Osgood also describes a number of variants of the summer house, built above ground.10 These differ chiefly in the type of material used for the walls, some being made of spruce planks, others of split Cottonwood poles, still others of spruce bark, birch bark, or grass mats. They are rectangular or square structures, and the entrance may be in the middle of the longer or the shorter wall. The roof is generally a simple gable with single ridgepole supported by two main posts; the eaves rest on the top of the side walls. However, some houses are built with a two-pole gable roof, with a pair of main posts at the front and back; the central part of the roof between the two ridgepoles is almost flat. The roofs are covered with birch bark and earth, and have a smokehole in the center, divided by the single ridgepole in most houses, lying between the two ridgepoles in the others. There are benches along the side ends of the house and a shelf across the back. The plank summer house has the front and rear walls of vertically placed planks, the side walls are generally of horizontal planks tied between the corner posts which are set up in pairs. The house of split cottonwood logs is built in the same way. The bark and mat houses differ slightly in that the frame of the house is of lighter construction. One to three families may occupy these houses from May to Septem ber. Smokehouses for drying fish and for ordinary cooking in the hot part of the summer are built generally with a single gable roof.11 There is no smokehole, and racks are built for drying fish. The walls may be of spruce logs lying hori zontally at the sides, and split logs placed vertically at the ends; or the walls may be of willow branches with the leaves still on, laid up horizontally between pairs of vertical wall poles. There is also a shed-like smokehouse of spruce wood. As a summer shelter, or a house for summer 10 Op. cit., pp. 312-318. 11 Op. cit., pp. 319-323.</page><page sequence="106">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 99 use as a steam bath, the Ingalik made a dome shaped lodge, about 9 feet in diameter, with a frame of arched-over willows. The covering may be of birch bark, grass, boughs, or skin.12 A shelter against mosquitoes built during summer travel is simply a tipi of willows.13 The shelter used in winter or spring travel is like a ridge tent (or inverted V), with a single-pole gable, covered with spruce boughs, or a fishskin sled cover. The lower edges of the roof rest on the ground. There is a smokehole in the center, with a rude wind screen.14 ARCHAEOLOGICAL TENA HOUSES Figures 5, 6, 8, 11, 20 illlustrate what we were able to learn from excavation of a few house pits. Unfortunately not enough was pre served of the roof timbers in any case for us to be sure of the construction. The position of certain timbers in House 4 at Kateel (Fig. 5) and in House 12, Old Fish Camp, suggested that the roof was pyramidal, like that of the older grave houses at Old Low den, Koyukuk and Nulato (Pis. Ill, 4; IV, 3).15 There were probably beams in each of the four corners and in the middle of the four sides, their lower ends fastened (by mortising or ty ing) to the retaining logs at the top of the ex cavated pit or set into the earth outside, and their upper ends fastened to the square frame of the smokehole. Shorter beams rested against these principal logs. A reconstruction of House 4 at Kateel, which would be typical of all the houses of this kind, is illustrated in Figure 6. Our interpretation of the decayed timbers is of course only conjectural. The feature of which we can be most certain is the row of retaining stakes lining the inside of the pit. Jette's sketches (Fig. 21) indicate only that the roof rises above the level of the walls in the middle, and that it was probably pyramidal. He says only that there was no single ridgepole, since the middle of the roof had to be open for the smokehole. He does mention a beam "under neath the smoke hole," and side timbers which support the roof. Although we did not find any posts in the center of the house to support the roof, there may have been such. If they had been set with 12 Op. tit., pp. 324 f. 13 Op. tit., pp. 327 f. 14 Op. tit., pp. 326 f. 15 The old grave house of the Carrier (Morice, 1894, Fig. 186) has a similar roof. their lower ends resting on the floor, not sunk below it, it would be difficult to find evidence of their former existence. A small model in the U. S. National Museum, said to represent the Indian house of the lower Yukon, shows the sloping side of the pyramidal roof supported by four posts near the middle of the house. Since this model lacks an entrance tunnel, and shows the side timbers of the roof as arched rods, it cannot be taken as typical of the winter house. It seems much more probable that it is the fall house (see above). On the other hand, if the Indian winter dwelling were a copy of the Eskimo dwellings observed by Collins along the Alaskan coast from Bristol Bay to the mouth of the Yukon, we would expect to find four such supporting posts,16 as in the Ingalik winter house described by Osgood. However, not all the Eskimo houses of the vicinity were built in this way. Zagoskin describes the houses of Norton Bay with cribbed roofs, and Nelson not only fails to mention such posts but draws his cross-sections of houses at St. Michael and Cape Darby in Norton Sound as if they had cribbed roofs like the kashim.17 Thus even, though we suspect an Eskimo model for the Tena winter house, we cannot be sure which type of Eskimo house was most commonly copied by the Tena above Blackburn. The house at Blackburn Slough (Fig. 8) seems to have had a gabled roof with a double ridgepole, like the Tanaina house on Cook In let, or like one of the Ingalik summer houses described by Osgood.18 House 7 at the site opposite Hologochaket (Fig. 20) may have had either a pyramidal roof, or a cribbed roof like the kashim. In every case, the timbers of the roof were covered with strips of birch bark, sewed to gether, and banked over with turf. Osgood does not mention the use of bark for the roofs of winter houses, however. The house was entered through a rather long tunnel, which generally opened into the main room a little to one side of the middle of the wall. Only in a few cases did we note an enlargement at the outer end of the tunnel, corresponding to the antecham ber or porch described by Jette, but we did not attempt to excavate these. Besides, if this outer room were built entirely above ground, 16 Collins, 1937a, Fig. 25, pp. 257 ff. "Zagoskin (1935), pp. 65 f; E. W. Nelson, 1899, Figs. 74, 80, 81, pp. 241 ff. 18 de Laguna, 1934, Fig. 5; Osgood, 1937, pp. 55 ff., Figs. 5-8.</page><page sequence="107">100 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 little trace of it could ever be found. Whymper illustrated this outer room as if it had slightly sloping walls of horizontal planks. Dall's il lustration shows it as a flat-topped structure, entirely above ground, but built of heavy ver tical and horizontal logs, with a doorway at the side.19 Osgood described it as a shed, built above ground, with a door at the end farthest from the house. The depth to which houses were excavated seems to vary from place to place. For most sites we are unable to report the original depth of the pit, since the holes have been partly filled in by the material of the collapsed roof? logs, bark, sods?by flood silt and by the nat ural accumulation of humus. At present the bottom of these pits is found anywhere from 6 inches to 3 feet below the present surface of the ground. Even when we cleared the pit down to its original floor level, our limited time prevented us from clearing the ground outside to expose what was the surface at the time when the house was built. Even if we had attempted this, it is doubtful whether we would have learned much, since the houses were so banked over with earth that the ground must have been disturbed for some distance around each pit. At a site like Kateel, where the houses are crowded together on such a narrow ridge, all the surface of the ridge has been dis turbed; at a site like the Old Fish Camp, where building seems to have gone on over such a long period of time, it would be very hard to determine the ground level from which any one house had been excavated. I give below, however, the depth of the house floor (after our excavation) as measured from the present sur face of the ground at the edge of the pits: Kateel, House 4, 2-3 feet; Kateel, Kashim (House 6), 3 feet; Blackburn Slough, 1^ to 2 feet; Yukon Willow Creek, Kashim (House 5), 3| feet; Old Fish Camp, House 11, 2-3 feet; Old Fish Camp, Kashim (House 19) not ex cavated by us, now over 3 feet; site opposite Hologochaket, House 7, 4-4? feet; site op posite Hologochaket, Kashim (House 9) not excavated by us, now 8 feet; New Grayling, House 13, 4?-5| feet; Anvik River, House 13, 2?-3| feet; Fox Creek, 3J feet. Thus the houses were excavated at least to the surface of the permanently frozen soil, except at Fox Creek where the soil is not frozen. " Dall, 1870, fig. on p. 65. In some cases, especially for the kashims, the floor was dug into the frozen ground. The houses below Blackburn tended, on the whole, to be deeper than those above. Excavation in the frozen soil could only have been carried out if the Indians had interrupted their work to allow the frozen surface to thaw, or if they had built fires in the pit to hasten the thawing. We did not find any evidence of plank floors. In several cases?House 11, at Old Fish Camp, and House 13, at New Grayling?artifacts and animal bones were so trampled into the silt below the more clearly marked occupation level in the pit that we may assume the floor to have been only the earth at the bottom. We did not find any clear evidence of the benches or bunks that probably ran around the sides of the houses. At House 4, Kateel, there seems to have been an interrupted ledge of earth across the front wall, through which the tunnel opened, as described by Jette and Osgood. Perhaps some of the timbers which we inter preted as roof beams in this and other houses were really part of the sleeping benches. The fireplace in the center of the house was clearly marked by ashes, charcoal, etc., and by the baked silt below it. Jette and Osgood describe the hearth as being sometimes raised above the level of the floor. Actually, we found that the ashes ran below floor level, as if the first fire had been kindled in a depression (compare with Jette's published notes). In time, perhaps, the ashes would have accumulated to make a raised hearth. American residents on the Yukon told us that an ordinary frame house, unless kept in good repair, would not last more than twenty years. We may assume, therefore, that none of the semisubterranean Tena houses could have been occupied for a longer period. This is an important consideration for the dendrochronol ogist to bear in mind when attempting to date such houses by means of tree rings. The rapid decay of the native houses would be sufficient to explain the many house pits at some of the larger sites, as well as the apparently rapid shifting of the population from small sites, when the convenient terraces had been com pletely filled with the first houses. TENA KASHIMS The only standing kashim seen by the expe dition was that at Hologochaket. It was built about 1930, when the old kashim burned down. From the outside it looks like a mound</page><page sequence="108">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 101 of earth, with a wooden shed at the front and a glass-topped cupola rising from the top. Figure 22 shows the cribbed construction of the roof as it would appear from above if the covering of planks and earth were stripped from the beams. Earth is banked up about the upper part of the walls, which project above the top of the pit, and this earth is held in place by a low outer wall of horizontal planks, retained by stakes driven into the ground at 4|-foot intervals. The ends of the roof beams project through the sod roof. Inside, the walls of the pit are lined with vertical planks, and one can see the ceiling of sloping planks laid over the roof beams. There is a wooden floor, but it lacks the large fireplace in the center which was a regular feature in the older ka shims. When the kashim was used for sweat baths, fire was kindled in this pit; when dances were held, the pit was covered by a trap door. For certain dances, the performers emerged from the firepit. Around all four walls of the Hologochaket kashim there is a bench, broken only at the doorway. It is about the height of a table and a little over 2 feet wide. Male spectators at the dances sat on it, the women sat below it, and some of the dancers also sat below it while waiting their turn to perform. On the two sides of the room there is a row of holes in the floor, about a yard in front of the bench, into which wooden stands for lamps were set during the Death Potlatch. One lamp was lit for each person honored at the cere mony and our informant has seen as many as seven burning at one time. Across the back of the room is stretched a heavy wire, on which movable animal figures might be suspended and jerked back and forth during ceremonies.20 The kashim is entered through the shed at the front. Here one descends a few steps into a short excavated passage which opens into the main room at floor level. A few measurements of the main room may be of interest: outside length, 25.6 feet; out side width, 24.9 feet; inside length, 21 feet; inside width, 20.6 feet; height of eaves above floor, 5.5 feet; height of center of roof above floor, 12.3 feet; depth of excavation, 2.4 feet; height of doorway, 4.8 feet; width of doorway, 2.3 feet. Kashims were observed at the following sites: Kateel, House 6; Old Fish Camp, House 19; Yukon Willow Creek, House 5; site opposite 20 de Laguna, 1936c, p. 584. Hologochaket, House 9; Hall's Rapids; Robin son's place 4 miles below Hall's Rapids (re ported); Old Grayling; Anvik Point, three, in cluding a recently abandoned one; Bonasila; Ghost Creek (reported); Fox Creek. The roofs of these, as far as they could be determined, seem to have been cribbed in the same manner as that of the present kashim at Hologochaket. The kashim at Yukon Willow Creek had a roof made of two layers of logs with grass between. \&lt; ~-&gt; Fig. 22.?Roof Timbers of Modern Kashim, Hologochaket (Fig. 14). Modern "dance halls" used for Indian gather ings were seen at Nenana, Tanana Mission, Koyukuk, Nulato, and Kaltag. They are all ordinary log houses, without distinctive fea tures, with the exception of the building at Kaltag. This has a glass cupola on the roof, reminiscent of the old smokehole with its wooden wind screen and gutskin cover. The kashim at Hologochaket, though lacking an open fireplace, still preserves the tradition of the smokehole in much the same way. The dance hall at Nulato was under the charge of Old Lady Stickman, but we do not know who she was, or what was her position, or whether such an arrangement was common. In the preceding pages we have mentioned sites at which Zagoskin, Whymper, and others have observed kashims. These are: Kateel; Kaltag; Kogoltlinde near Kaltag, big enough to hold forty men and used for sweat baths; Inselnostlinde on the lower Innoko, with a chandelier holding six oil lamps; at the lowest</page><page sequence="109">102 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 Tlegon village on the Innoko; and at Ghost Creek, big enough to hold 700 adults, with three tiers of benches. Of the kashims at Ka teel and at Tallite, the lowest Tlegon village, Zagoskin says that they were built only to entertain guests, since the local inhabitants did not take steam baths. While we doubt that the builders were quite as unselfishly hospitable as Zagoskin would lead us to believe, we may well question whether these "up-river" kashims served the same functions as those built on the lower Yukon below Blackburn, and lower In noko. There can be no doubt that the lower Tena kashim, together with its functions, was borrowed from the adjacent Eskimo, and that it was spreading up the Yukon and its tribu taries at the time of the first explorations. In the vicinity of Anvik, the kashim served as the common meeting hall for the community and the hall in which masked dances of a re ligious nature were held.21 It was also the men's club house and workshop, the men's sweat bath house, and the guest house where travelers were entertained. Masked dances were not held above Anvik (or above Blackburn ?); the sweat bath is reported from Kaltag and may have been used as far upstream as Nulato. Petroff says that no kashims were built by any Yukon Indians, and that all their dances were held in a large dwelling house.22 This is obviously an error. As to what extent women were excluded from the kashim except at cere monies, I cannot say. When I was at Hologo chaket no objection was made to my entering and photographing the kashim, or to my hand ling and photographing the dance masks kept in a cache near by. In fact, an Indian man and woman assisted me. Of course, the old customs are dying out now; consequently it is dangerous to assume that in the old days women could enter the kashim as freely as they do now. The stone for smoothing pottery and the bootsole creaser found in the kashim at Kateel suggest that women were freely admitted to the build ing and may even have worked there, but we do not know whether such freedom was per mitted only on the peripheries of the area in which kashims were built. Our native guides identified the kashims at Kateel, Old Fish Camp and Yukon Willow Creek on the Khotol, as "meeting houses," and I now regret very 21 For a description and discussion of the masked cere monies see Chapman, 1907; de Laguna, 1936c. 22 Petroff, 1884, p. 161. much that I did not obtain further information. Our informants at Koyukuk mentioned several ceremonies which may have taken place in the kashim, although again we neglected to obtain specific information. One of these is the feast and potlatch which follows the death of an individual. Gifts are distributed to those who took part in the funeral and to important per sons, but this may not have taken as elaborate a form as the great Feast of the Dead at Anvik. The Indians of the lower Koyukuk and of the Yukon between Koyukuk and Tanana used to meet for something which was rather like a debating contest. The teams consisted of mem bers of the three clans?people associated with underground regions, native copper, and the black bear; people associated with the north and the caribou; people associated with the middle or with the sea, with fish, and with dentalium?the teams coming from different villages. The challengers made a speech full of obscure allusions to clan insignia?a painted paddle was mentioned in describing a particular occasion?and the opposing team had to guess the meaning of the allusion and counter with a speech of their own. It is probable that such large gatherings took place in a kashim, but of course we have no evidence that a kashim or meeting house was built on the Yukon above the Koyukuk until modern times. It is uncer tain whether these clans were found among the natives below Blackburn. Osgood describes the Ingalik kashim in con siderable detail.23 The pit for the main room was 35X25X7 feet deep, the entrance passage 3 feet wide and 5 feet long, the entryway 10 feet long and 8 feet wide, the height of the smokehole above the floor 12\ feet, the firepit 8X6X2| feet deep. The construction of the roof was essentially the same as that of the kashim seen at Hologochaket, but it was cov ered with grass and earth. The bench, 4 feet high and 2 feet wide, ran all around the walls and over the top of the door to the entrance passage. The bench at Hologochaket was inter rupted here, and the doorway was higher. The walls of the main room were lined with split poles mortised into a base log at the bottom and wedged at the top between the edge of the pit and a horizontal retaining log. The latter was supported by posts, also mortised into the base log. The floor was covered with poles, split side up, resting on joists. There was a 23 Osgood, 1940, pp. 290-302.</page><page sequence="110">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 103 removable cover of planks for the firepit. A tunnel?really a prolongation of the firepit, though not quite as wide?led from the pit to the entryway. The wooden floor of the main room and of the entrance passage was flush with the dirt floor of the entryway; dirt steps with wooden treads led up from the entryway to the outer door. The roof of the entrance and entryway are simply spanned and are covered with grass and earth. The outer doorway is gen erally uncovered; a bear skin serves as a door between the entryway and the entrance pas sage, and a second skin serves as door between the passage and the inner room. During the Animals' Ceremony some of the performers enter the kashim via the tunnel connecting with the firepit, emerging through the hole in the cover planks of the firepit. Osgood men tions a number of ceremonies, potlatches, and ceremonial games that take place in the kashim ?Lucky Pole, Bladder, Doll, and Animals' Ceremonies; Partner's Potlatch; Ceremonial Hoop and Pole, Bouncing, and Quoit Games, and other games. COMPARISONS OF TENA HOUSE TYPES WITH THOSE OF THEIR NEIGHBORS The conical tent or tipi used by the Tena of the Koyukuk only in spring or in November, on journeys to bring back game killed on the fall hunt, and by the Ingalik as a mosquito proof shelter on summer trips, has an exceed ingly wide distribution and seems to belong to the Snowshoe stage of culture in northern Eurasia and North America. Its distribution has been studied in detail by Birket-Smith.24 I need only mention here that it was used by the Western Eskimo north of the Yukon, by the Caribou Eskimo, occasionally by the Kut chin, by the Tanaina, Eyak, Tlingit, Sekani, Interior Salish, and some Puget Sound Salish, by the northern Canadian Athabaskans and northeastern Algonkians, etc., and in northern Eurasia by practically every tribe from the Chukchee, Koryak, and Ainu, west to the Lapps. Its lightness and the ease with which it can be taken down and set up make it an ideal home for the periods between seasons, for journeys, and for nomadic life. Since we do not know how the skin-covered tipi used on the Koyukuk was constructed, it is impossible to 24 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, Tables A3 and B2; additional citations in Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, pp. 377,518. compare it with the various sub-types. Be cause the Alaskan Eskimo tipi was made with a hoop binding the poles together, we might assume that the Tena tipi was similar. How ever, the tipi of the Kutchin was made without the hoop. We do not know which model was followed by the Tena. The Ingalik tipi was simply built of willows leaned together, and may have been, perhaps, only a degenerate survival of a shelter once better made, now superseded by better types of houses. The dome-shaped hut, used on the Koyukuk as a mosquito-proof summer home, and by the lower Tena (Ingalik) as a summer home, sum mer shelter, or lodge for steam baths, was also made by the Kutchin. In winter it was of skin heaped over with snow, in summer, of skins or birch bark.25 Birket-Smith has studied the distribution of this type of house and considers it an element of the Ice-hunting culture stage.26 He has, however, been more interested in the shape of the house than in the method of its construction. Among both the Tena and the Kutchin the poles supporting the cover of bark, skin, boughs, or grass are arched over like the frame of an inverted basket. I am not sure whether dome-shaped houses built on different principles ought to be equated directly with this arched frame construction. In any case, the dome-shaped house of the Tena-Kutchin type seems to be very ancient in both the Old World and the New; in a great many regions it has been largely supplanted by nouses of newer or better types of construction, so that it usually survives only as a sweat house or men strual lodge. One can imagine that once it was more important on the Yukon, used both in summer and winter, and that it was abandoned by the Tena in favor of the warmer semisub terranean winter house and the larger summer houses. It was retained as a summer home on the Koyukuk where the larger Ingalik summer house was lacking, or perhaps rare, and was practically reduced to the status of a shelter and steam bath house among the Ingalik. The fall house of the Koyukuk, and perhaps also of the lower Tena, was described as being like their winter house except that it was built above ground. We need not, therefore, con sider the details of its construction apart from those of the winter house, except that the Osgood, 1936, pp. 49 ff., 53 ff. 26 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, Table B 1, pp. 43 ff; additional citations, Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, pp. 377, 516.</page><page sequence="111">104 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 beams of the roof seem to have been arched over. This would suggest that it was related in some way to the arched-over frame of the dome shaped lodge. It seems unlikely that it could be related directly to the summer plank houses of the Ingalik and of the Alaskan Eskimo south of Kotzebue Sound,27 for these had gable roofs and were probably derived from plank houses of the Northwest Coast. In function, the Tena fall house certainly stands closest to the fall "moss" house of the Kutchin. This is built of upright split poles for the walls and has a gable roof with a single ridgepole. Moss and earth are piled over the walls and roof. The floor may or may not be slightly excavated.28 This house, like the Ingalik summer house built of split Cot tonwood poles and logs, of bark, or of mats, might be considered as ancestral to the North west Coast plank house with single ridgepole, the ruder or flimsier wall materials being re placed by planks, or the Tena and Kutchin forms may be considered as peripheral deriva tives of the Northwest Coast house. Although Osgood considers the "moss" house or "semi-subterranean log house" as a general Kutchin trait,29 I do not think that it is an cestral to the Tena winter house. In the first place, the Kutchin house is not always semi subterranean, and even the house of the Peel River Kutchin, which Osgood evidently con siders the most typical, is excavated only to a depth of IJ feet; that is, the wet humus is scraped away to the level of the permanent frost, while the Crow River house is not exca vated at all. The gable roof with single ridge pole found on these houses is not represented in the Tena winter house, only in the fall house, summer dwelling, and smokehouse. The Kutchin house lacks the entrance tunnel, the outer shed (entryway or porch), and the raised bunks inside. On the other hand, as we shall see, it is just these features, together with the details of the roof construction, in most cases, that link the Tena winter house with those of the Alaskan Eskimo. The only specific similari ties between the Tena winter house and the Kutchin fall house are their square or rectangu lar shape, walls of split poles, central fireplace, the covering of earth, and the more or less excavated floor. None of these features, except possibly the last two, are very significant. 27 E. W. Nelson, 1899, pp. 242, 247 ff. 28 Osgood, 1936, pp. 48 ff., 52 f. 29 Op. tit., p. 179. Earth as additional covering for walls and roof is such a widely diffused and obvious de vice that it need not argue any particular rela tionship between the two houses under discus sion. It is often assumed that an earth-covered house is the same thing as a semisubterranean house, but we should certainly distinguish be tween such types as a house completely encased in earth, like the Point Barrow house, and the wattle house with mud daub, or the open sun shelter with thick dirt roof but no walls, which are Pima types. It is not at all clear that the Kutchin attempted to bank their fall house over with a mound of earth as did the Tena their winter house. I am thus not sure whether we are really comparing traits of the same or der. As for the excavated floor, it will have been noted that the deepest pits for Tena houses are found farthest down the Yukon, nearest the Eskimo, and that in successive villages up stream, excavations are progressively shal lower. In Kutchin territory, the floor may be only slightly excavated or not excavated at all. Perhaps the level of permanent ground frost has something to do with this. However, the Alaskan Eskimo, even in the north, were not deterred by the shallowness of the thawed ground from achieving a semisubterranean house. Even at Point Barrow, where the floor of the house could hardly have been much below the original level of the ground, a truly subterranean effect was achieved by piling a big mound of earth over the house.30 On the whole, it looks as if the slight attempt to exca vate the floor of some Kutchin fall houses is to be explained as a peripheral manifestation of a trait borrowed by them from the Tena, and by the Tena from the Eskimo. Although a rectangular or oval subterranean or semisubterranean house with entrance pas sage and central fireplace goes back to Upper Paleolithic times in Europe,31 there is no reason to suppose that a semisubterranean house is an original item of Athabaskan culture. We can explain the Tena winter house types as copies of local Eskimo models. The winter house of the Cook Inlet Tanaina suggests a blend of Eskimo and Northwest Coast features. Thus, the horizontally laid logs for the side walls, held between retaining stakes (Kachemak Bay 30 Murdoch, 1892, pp. 72 ff.; cf. de Laguna, 1934, pp. 159 ff. 31 Golomstock, 1938, pp. 324 ff., 399 ff., Figs. 46 and 84, 1, 2, 4; PL XXIII.</page><page sequence="112">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 105 only), remind us of the Old Bering Sea house;32 certainly the excavated floor and entrance tun nel are typically Eskimo traits. Its gable roof with twin ridgepoles, end walls of vertical planks, and partitioned inner sleeping rooms are Northwest Coast features, shared by the Pacific Eskimo. The twin ridgepoles seem to belong to some Tena houses, too. The appended square bathrooms are typical of houses of the Cook Inlet, Kodiak, and Chugach Eskimo. The early winter house of the Midnoosky, on the Copper River, seems to have been very similar to the Tanaina house of Cook Inlet, and was probably copied directly from the Chugach or from the Tanaina.33 The Chilcotin and some of the Carrier in British Columbia, on the other hand, copied from the Salish the circular semisubterranean house with roof entrance.34 Whether the Eskimo and Salish underground houses are ultimately related is a problem that need not concern us here. We ought to make a more detailed compari son between the winter houses of the Tena and those of their Eskimo neighbors. In discussing the question of interior posts to support the pyramidal roof of the house at Kateel (see the Ingalik winter house described by Osgood), we mentioned such posts in the winter houses of the Eskimo from Bristol Bay to the mouth of the Yukon. This is described by Collins as the "Southwestern Alaskan house."35 The main room is rectangular, with a low earth bench around three sides, and an earth floor. Hori zontal retaining logs lie along the edge of the bench and along the edge of the excavation above the bench. Four upright posts at the inner corners of the bench support the flat central part of the roof, which is spanned by logs laid in two directions, like flat cribbing, leaving an open space in the center for the smokehole. The sloping "walls" of the house above the sides of the pit (what we have called the sloping roof) are of timbers laid up against the flat part of the roof. The house is entered by stepping through the roof of a slightly ex cavated anteroom, down another step into an inner connecting room, and finally along a tun nel, lower than the floor of the main room. The roof entrance into the outer anteroom and the prolongation of the tunnel into the main 32 Osgood, 1937, pp. 55 ff., Figs. 5 to 8; de Laguna, 1934, Fig. 5. Compare with Collins, 1937a, p. 260. 33 Allen, 1887, pp. 130 f. 34 Morice, 1894, Figs. 17 and 18. ? Collins, 1937a, Fig. 25, pp. 257 ff. room correspond with Jette's description of the Yukon Indian house, although Dall and Whym per show a side door in a completely above ground anteroom or shed, and Osgood, a door at the end of a shed. Collins' "Southwestern Alaskan house" is certainly very similar to some of the Tena houses. The house of the Nushegak Eskimo on the shore of Bristol Bay is described as being roughly circular, with a "tent-like" roof.36 This vague characterization suggests that the roof may have been pyramidal, without internal support, in other words, like our reconstruction of the house at Kateel. Some of the Tena houses seem to have cribbed roofs like the kashims. Zagoskin tells us that this was the common Eskimo type at Norton Bay, and we have already mentioned Nelson's diagrams as perhaps indicating that cribbed roofs were made generally in Norton Sound. Zagoskin's description of the house types at Norton Bay is so interesting that we quote it in full: The natives of Norton Bay have summer and winter barabaras. The winter barabara is dug out about a yard deep, at each corner is stood a large log from one and a half to two sagen high. [A sagen is about 7 feet.] The walls are of planks placed vertical beside the corner logs. The top is composed of two thick logs on the corners, then two the other direction a little in from the walls, then two more parallel with the first and farther in, and so in that way a pyramid shaped roof is built. The loop hole on top of the roof is a frame covered with the intestines of sea animals [and] replaces a glass window. The rafters are covered on the outside with boards [and dirt] and then all the buildings look like hills. The entrance is dug out of the ground very narrow and low, about seven and a half feet long. The nar row tunnel is covered with dirt, too. The tunnel to the win ter house is so small and low the family must crawl through the passage on hands and knees. . . . The arrangement in side the barabara is very sjLmple and all alike. The door to the passage is covered with bear or some other kind of skin, a square hole in the middle of the floor is the fire place. Boards laid over the dirt represent the floor. On each side of the entrance about one and a half feet from the floor and reaching from wall to wall are bunks about four feet wide; those are the beds, tables and divans for the natives. The grass rugs which they hang across each bunk divide the separate families. On the front side of the room are made shelves. On them and under them are bladders of oil, kettles, wooden bowls, bags of sea lion skin, and other household utensils. The summer house is built on top of the ground. The view from the outside is very similar to our houses except that-[part of the text is missing]. The roof is covered with lumber and earth. Summer barabaras do not have a fireplace nor a window at the top so light comes as it will through the cracks and door as you may call the hole in the front of the barabara. To know what is going on they 38 Petroff, 1884, p. 15; Porter, 1893, p. 170.</page><page sequence="113">106 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 make small holes plugged with rocks and shutters. The barabara does not have a floor. The view inside is the same as the winter house. I never saw a barabara larger than three square sagene. ... Each village has a public building known to us in Kadiak dialect as "kasima." They are built similar to a winter barabara but larger, some of them ten square sagene and four or five sagene high. Instead of bunks it has around all the walls benches. Some kasima[s] as on the Kvihpak [Yukon] and Kuskokwim have two or three tiers of seats. Besides the narrow passage they have more space away under the ground where the fire place is which is about four feet deep. The kasima witnesses the age of each set tlement as their benches are proofs of prehistoric time and could show how they were made by hand and filled with each generation. Men use the kasima for their work, tan ning skins, weaving nets, making sleds, besides holding meetings, councils, conferences. The kasima takes the place of a hall to receive guests, dining room for their feasts, auditorium for their public games, bed room for the men, and for bath houses, which is the chief amusement of the Kang-ulit."37 This passage is of particular interest to us since Zagoskin tells us that the Tena from Nu lato to Blackburn copied their buildings after those of the Norton Sound Eskimo. If we agree with Nelson38 that the Tena of the lower Yukon and Kuskokwim borrowed the kashim from the Eskimo, we may extend the same explanation to the semisubterranean winter house. The house built below Black burn is more like Collins' "Southwestern Eskimo house," and the house built above Blackburn is perhaps more like Zagoskin's Norton Sound house. The winter house was probably borrowed before the kashim was taken over, since it seems to have traveled farther up the Yukon, yet both may have been adopted at the same time and one may have traveled farther, due to special factors. Waterman, Mathiassen, Birket-Smith and Collins have discussed the various types of Eskimo houses in relation to each other and to the house types of the surrounding areas.39 I can add nothing to the solution of the problems concerning the original shape of the house? round or rectangular?or the type of entrance? tunnel or roof opening?but we might find it profitable to consider the various methods of roofing the structure, especially since the Tena seem to have employed a number of them. The archaeological and ethnological evidence, unsatisfactory as it is, suggests that the Tena 37 Zagoskin (1935), pp. 65 ff. 38 E. W. Nelson, 1889, p. 245. 39 Waterman, 1921; Mathiassen, 1927, II, pp. 132-157; Birket-Smith, 1929, II, pp. 43-56,133-137; Collins, 1937a, pp. 256-286; de Laguna, 1934, pp. 157-162. winter houses may have had the following types of roof: (1) truncated pyramidal roof without internal support, (2) truncated pyramidal roof with four supporting posts, (3) cribbed roof, like the kashim, and (4) gabled roof with two ridgepoles. A pyramidal roof (or rather a truncated pyramidal roof, since the smokehole with its flat cover cuts off the apex of the pyramid) supported only by the inclined rafters fastened to the frame of the smokehole, and lacking in ternal support, employs the same architectural principles as a four-pole tipi with ring. Such tipis were made by the Alaskan Eskimo.40 A square tipi is one among many forms of sum mer huts made by the Thompson Indians.41 If, instead of a light covering of mats and bark, we build the roof of logs and earth, then we may need to add internal support, like the log braces in the winter houses of the Plateau Salish. While most of these houses are round, thus more clearly exhibiting a similarity to a tipi, some Lillooet houses were square,42 and so stand closer to the Yukon type of house. The fact that the four posts in the middle that help to support the roof are not set up vertically, but lean outwards, suggest that these were later additions to the structure and not an origi nal feature of the roof. This is also suggested by the fact that while four such braces are customary (one for each of the four main beams of the roof), we can also find houses with a smaller number of braces or with none at all. The Sanpoil earth lodge with one or no central pole and the Lakes lodge, with none, have a roof built of radiating poles, the lower ends anchored in the ground, the upper ends tied to the frame of the hatchway.43 They are thus essentially earth-covered tipis of the hoop type, built over pits. Incidentally, the elaborate skin-covered tipis used by the Reindeer Chuk chee and Koryak have the side bulged out with braces which are inserted after the tent has been erected, but these have nothing to do with holding up the frame.44 I believe that we are dealing here with parallel inventions. The Eskimo around Point Barrow and Kotzebue Sound also used a sort of braced tipi for tem porary shelters. Thus Simpson writes that 40 E. W. Nelson, 1899, pp. 261 ff. 41 Teit, 1900, Fig. 139. 42 Teit, 1906, p. 213. 43 Ray, 1939, p. 135. 44 Bogoras, 1904-1909, I, p. 170; Jochelson, 1905-1908, II, p. 448.</page><page sequence="114">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 107 these shelters are made of small split trees, laid inclining inward in a pyramidal form towards a rude square frame in the center, supported by two or more upright posts. Upon these, the smaller branches of the felled trees are placed, and the whole, except for the aperture at the top and a small opening on one side, is covered with earth or only snow.45 If the structure had been more carefully made, the internal supports would not have been ne cessary and we should have had a roof like the one ascribed to the house at Kateel. It would not be necessary to derive this type of roof among the Tena from any Interior Salish structure, although it is duplicated by the Lakes and Sanpoil roofs, for it could have been derived directly from a local tipi, Indian or Eskimo. We might also note that Roberts reconstructs the roof of the antechamber of the Basket maker III house in Chaco Canyon, New Mex ico, as an earth-covered tipi, and reports that a similar roof was associated with a Basket maker III pit house at Mesa Verde, Colorado. Kidder and Guernsey also suggest a tipi-like roof for the round house in Fluteplayer House, northeastern Arizona, probably Pueblo I in age.46 Perhaps related to these truly tipi-style conical roofs, in the same way that the Sanpoil roof with one central post is related to the alternative form without such support, is the Type I house of the Georgetown phase of the Mogollon culture, of southwestern New Mexico and southeastern Arizona.47 This phase dates from about a.d. 500 to 700, and is roughly con temporaneous with Basketmaker III. The use of a large central post undoubtedly began in a pre-Georgetown phase,48 and its influence seems to have lasted into the San Francisco phase, a.d. 700 to 900. The Type III house built in this period has the roof mainly supported by a central post, although there are two others in line with it down the middle of the house. They probably held up a single ridgepole, however.49 One of the Sinagua houses which I excavated in 1941 at Cinder Park, near Flagstaff, Arizona, at a site which seems to combine Mogollon and Basketmaker III traits, probably had a tipi like roof with central support. The original form of a house with the flat 46 Quoted by Murdoch, 1892, p. 78. 46 Roberts, 1929, pp. 12 f., Fig. 2; Kidder and Guernsey, 1919, pp. 43 f., Fig. 18. 47 Haury, 1936, Fig. 26 a. 48 Martin, 1940, p. 14, Fig. 1. 49 Haury, 1936, Fig. 26 b. central part of the roof supported by four posts, and the lower part of the roof or upper part of the walls leaning up against it like a mansard roof, may have been a braced truncated py ramidal tipi, in which the braces have come to bear the main part of the load. In any case, the architectural principle is now quite differ ent from that involved in the tipi. Whatever its origin, this type of house is widely dis tributed. Four posts support the roof of the Bristol Bay-Yukon Eskimo house, and of the Mackenzie Eskimo house, which Collins has shown to be a specialized form of the "South western Alaskan house."50 The houses of the Maritime Koryak, the Kamchadal and the Gilyak were also of this four-post type.51 It was probably more widespread than we can now prove. I suspect that the roof of the Kodiak Eskimo house was of this type, although no description of it is adequate, and my own work on Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound did not add any data on roof structure in prehis toric times which might clarify this question. There seems to be no question that the roofs of all these houses are related. A similar roof appears in the late Punuk period on St. Law rence Island, and was built until forty or fifty years ago. Collins believes that it reached the island from Siberia, rather than from the Alaskan mainland, since St. Lawrence Island seems to have received many of its cultural ac quisitions from the Asiatic Eskimo.52 In support of this hypothesis, we can point out that the roof of the St. Lawrence house was supported by from two to six posts, while an ancient house ruin at Nunligen on the Chukchee Pe ninsula also differed from the usual type in possessing more than four posts. Bogoras' de scription and illustrations are unfortunately not very clear.53 In any case, both the Siberian and St. Lawrence Island houses seem to be marginal variants. It is characteristic of this type of roof that extra posts are added in forms found on the peripheries of its area of distribution (see historic Pawnee houses and Pueblo kivas, men tioned below). Another variant is found among the Ainu. Torii figures a pit house of the Sakhalin (Kara futo) Ainu, in which four posts hold up the 60 Collins, 1937a, p. 269, Fig. 25. 61 Jochelson, 1905-1908, II, pp. 253 ff.; see Collins' ex cellent discussion, esp. op. tit., pp. 271-286. 52 Collins, 1937a, p. 261, Type 3; Geist and Rainey, 1936, Figs. 1, 2, 3. 53 Bogoras, 1904-1909,1, pp. 181 f.</page><page sequence="115">103 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 several pairs of inclined rafters, making the central part of the roof gabled. Prehistoric Ainu pit houses in Japan also had four posts, al though we do not know just how the roof was made.54 The four-post support for the roof has a wide, if scattered, distribution in North America. It has been mentioned by Waterman from the Mohave, Hidatsa and Chikasaw?probably other pit houses in his list are of this type, but the descriptions are not explicit?and by Spier from the Klamath.55 On the Plains, the earth lodges of the prehistoric Upper Republi can culture of Nebraska, ancestral to the mod ern Pawnee and Arikara, and of the contem porary "Nebraska culture," ancestral to mod ern sedentary Siouan, had four-post roofs. The same type of roof was made by the historic Arikara and Cheyenne, but a number of mod ern Plains tribes, including the Pawnee, added extra posts.56 In the Southwest, the four-post roof is associated with Basketmaker III and with some Pueblo I pit houses.57 It appears in modified form in other Pueblo I houses.58 Later Pueblo houses, however, lose this type of roof entirely, when the walls of the house, now built completely above ground, are constructed of masonry and themselves support the flat roof. The architectural tradition of semisubter ranean house with four-post roof survives in the kiva. Thus the Pueblo III "Great Kivas" of Chaco Canyon and vicinity have the roof supported by four huge posts set in masonry lined wells. This type of kiva is also known from Mesa Verde, but not in the Kayenta area of Arizona. Its predecessors have been found at some Basketmaker III and Pueblo I sites.59 The six to eight masonry pilasters built on the bench of the small, generalized kivas of Pueblo II and III sites in the San Juan district are simply the old posts of the pit house pushed back against the walls and augmented in number. In the "intermediate Chaco type" kiva, the pilasters themselves have degenerated into ten to twelve low pilaster bases. Pueblo III kivas in the Kayenta area lack pilasters altogether.60 54 Torii, 1919-1921, Fig. 87; Miyasaka and Yawata, 1927, Pis.

The pit house with four main posts also ap pears in the Mogollon culture. While the houses of the pre-Georgetown phase had a variable number of roof supports,61 Nesbitt describes three types of four-post pit houses from the Starkweather Mogollon site, and ascribes them to the Georgetown and San Francisco phases. Thus, his Type I (round with entrance pas sage) is Georgetown and early San Francisco, Type II (round with roof entrance) is early San Francisco, and Type III (rectangular with entrance passage) is San Francisco.62 These types were not found by Haury in con temporary sites which he excavated. Instead, there were Haury's Type I Georgetown house with central post and his Type II San Fran cisco house with ridgepole and three posts; in the later Three Circle Phase, a.d. 900 to 1000, Haury's Type IV house appeared. This was rectangular, with four posts near the corners and a fifth in the middle near the back wall. This we may interpret as a modification of the four-post type; Haury compares it not only with Pueblo I pit houses, but with prehistoric Plains types.63 The excavations at Snaketown, in southern Arizona, have shown us that the four-post sup port was used at two widely separated periods of Hohokam and Pima history.64 In the first and third phases of the ancient Pioneer period (Vahki, about 300 to 100 B.C., and Sweetwater, about a.d. 100 to 300), the Hohokam built squarish semisubterranean houses with en trance passages, the roof held up by four posts. In the intervening Estrella phase, the flat part of the roof seems to have been extended to cover the entire dwelling, and was held up by four rows of posts, two at the walls and two down the middle. In the last phase of the Pioneer period and in the later periods at Snaketown, the Ho hokam house became rectangular to elliptical in outline and had a gable roof, supported by a primary ridgepole. It is not until one reaches the historic Pima round house that one again meets the four-post roof. If we accept Glad win's original dating of the Vahki phase as be ing about 300 to 100 B.C., the Hohokam four post roof of this period is the oldest example known from the New World. He has since, how ever, suggested a much more recent dating for this phase. 61 Martin, 1940, Figs. 4, 5, 9 to 11. 62 Nesbitt, 1938, p. 88. 63 Haury, 1936, Fig. 26c, pp. 82 ff. 64 Gladwin, 1937,1, Fig. 36.</page><page sequence="116">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 109 The roof with four posts is thus not only widespread in North America but is closely as sociated with semisubterranean houses. Pit houses, of course, often have other types of roofing, too. Is it possible that the four-post arrangement with flat top and inclined walls? mansard roof?originated in America and spread thence to Siberia? Unless future archaeo logical research at Bering Strait proves this type to be older on the mainlands than it is on St. Lawrence Island (late Punuk), we cannot sug gest that it traveled via Bering Strait, for it is too old and too widespread in northeastern Asia. The only other crossing would be via the Aleutian Islands.65 The hypothesis of an Ameri can origin for the four-post roof would be strengthened if we could prove that it did originate from some form of braced tipi-like structure, similar to the pit houses on the pla teau, for it is in this part of America that we find forms transitional from the true tipi to the house. In Asia, no such series can be found; there the tipi has taken a different line of de velopment, as exhibited by the compound tipis of the reindeer-breeding Chukchee, Koryak, Yukaghir and Tungus. Although the cribbed roof is found on some Alaskan Eskimo houses it seems to be particu larly associated with the kashim in the Bristol Bay-Norton Sound area, and Collins has em phasized the similarity in form and function between these kashims and the kivas of the Southwest.66 His description of the "South western Alaskan house" (of the Bristol Bay Yukon area) indicates that a kind of flat "crib bing" was employed for the square part of the roof between the four uprights and the smoke hole. This "cribbing" is so flat that the roof is not vaulted, and yet the fact that the beams run in both directions makes the roof a little dif ferent from a simple span. Roberts explains the pilasters along the walls of prehistoric Pueblo kivas as derived from the four posts that origi nally stood free of the walls in the earlier pit houses. These pilasters support the first set of logs in the cribbed kiva roof. If this theory is correct, we might expect to find that the cen tral part of the roof on the old pit house was also cribbed after a fashion, like the roof of the Bristol Bay-Yukon house, and Roberts does consider this possibility.67 The cribbed roof, 65 Collins, 1937a, p. 280, suggests that roof entrance to the house passed from America to Asia by this route. 66 Collins, 1937a, p. 257. 67 Roberts, 1929, p. 87. whether it is based on a square (kashim), or on a 6-, 8-, or 10-sided polygon (kiva), is well adapted for a large building, since the indi vidual logs do not have to span the total width of the house, and because their thickness builds up the height of the roof in the center. (In the kashim at Hologochaket the lowest set of logs rested on huge beams across the corners.) We have already cited evidence to show that the cribbed roof was also used on some Eskimo dwelling houses. We may now ask whether this vaulted roof did not perhaps have a wider dis tribution among the Eskimo than our available information would indicate. Could it have been used on houses of the Canadian Thule culture? Unfortunately, Mathiassen was not able to dis cover the methods by which these were roofed. Doubtless the smallest were spanned by whale ribs and bits of driftwood, but other houses were rather large, ranging from 5 to 7 meters in diameter (roughly from 15 to 23 feet),68 and these must have required a different type of roof. I dare not suggest a vaulted roof for all of these, because in two houses at least'? House VII at Qilalukan and the house at Miti matalik, on Ponds Inlet, in northern Baffinland ?Mathiassen found evidence that irregularly placed posts of whale bone helped to support the roof;69 these would have been quite super fluous for a cribbed vault. Two rather recent prehistoric ruins on Southampton Island70 have limestone posts set up about the walls, rather suggestive of the pilasters on a South western kiva. Yet, as far as one of these houses is concerned, we know that a vault was not built because there is a central limestone pil lar. For most of the Thule houses there was probably no definite architectural pattern, to judge by the irregularity in floor plans. The roofs must have been a haphazard patchwork, spanned where possible, propped up when nec essary. For many, in which no remains of wood or bone beams have been found, we can imagine a corbelled stone roof, like that built by the de scendants of the Thule Eskimo in northern Greenland. Yet, somewhere in the past of the Thule cul ture, I feel sure there was a knowledge of the cribbed vault. The Thule Eskimo undoubtedly built snow houses, as their numerous snow knives testify,71 and the domed snow house is, 68 Mathiassen, 1927,1, pp. 14, 17, 109, 115-117, 120. 69 Op. cit., I, pp. 134, 142, Fig. 46. 70 Op. cit., I, Figs. 76 and 82. 71 Op. cit., II, pp. 156 ff.</page><page sequence="117">110 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 I believe, related to the cribbed vault. Except for their occurrence in the modern northern Alaskan Eskimo culture, which owes so much to a comparatively recent immigration of Thule Eskimo from Canada, snow knives have a decidedly eastern distribution, being found in the Canadian Thule culture and in many of its modern descendants, and perhaps also in the mysterious Dorset culture, though the Dor set snow knives, if they are truly snow knives, are of quite a different pattern. Birket-Smith argues that the true snow house, built entirely of blocks of snow, has de veloped from a dome-shaped tent covered with snow.72 Such snow-covered shelters are built by some of the Alaskan Eskimo (Colville and Malemute) and by the Kerek Koryak. Tents of this kind may have played a role in the de velopment of the snow house, but architectually that role must have been a minor one, except in so far as it taught people the physical proper ties of different kinds of snow. These snow covered shelters are, as Birket-Smith points out, variants of the domed tent to which snow has been added for extra warmth. But the snow is simply shoveled over them as one would shovel dirt; and even though the Kerek cut snow blocks, these are piled up over the tent as one would pile up pieces of turf. The foundation of the shelter, the brush or skin tent with its frame of arched branches, is the essential fea ture. It can stand alone, but without it the snow covering would collapse. The important thing about the true snow house of the modern Central and Polar Eskimo is that it does stand alone without any support whatsoever, and this trick of building with snow blocks could not possibly have been learned from arching over willows to make a tent frame. Birket Smith places considerable emphasis on the domed and rounded shape of these two types of structure, and yet I would suggest that these similarities may be fortuitous, resulting in each case from materials and architectural devices which are themselves quite unrelated. The vaulted log roof and the domed snow house have this in common: each element, log or block, is supported by those below it and is so placed, or leaned, that it not only builds up but in, towards the center of the roof. There is no keystone involved, so that at any time one can interrupt the building process and the 72 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, pp. 43 ff. half-finished structure will be self-supporting. The chief difference is that the vaulted cribbed roof is built up symmetrically, being in outline a polygon with an even number of sides (4, 6, 8, etc.) with each tier rising level, while the snow house is built up in a spiral, asymmetri cally, being a polygon with an indefinite num ber of sides. The logs for the cribbed roof do not have to be shaped, each one lies horizon tally across the two others of the tier below, but it is essential that each snow block, especially the upper ones, be cut with beveled edges, so that it inclines inward as it rests on the course below and leans against the beveled edge of the previous block beside it. It would be perfectly possible to build up a log vault spirally, instead of symmetrically in even-numbered, hori zontal sets, providing the logs were so trimmed that they could not roll off. The natural sticki ness of snow is, of course, a great advan tage. Because the snow house is architecturally a spirally cribbed vault, built up out of shaped elements, I believe it is genetically related to the simpler cribbed vault built of unshaped logs. In fact, I do not see how the Eskimo could have learned to build it if they had not been previously acquainted with log cribbing. Such a cribbed log roof must have been associated with a log or stone house, and we should look for it in the Old Bering Sea or in the Birnirk culture, or perhaps in some ancient Eskimo culture, as yet undiscovered, which may have preceded and contributed to the Thule culture. The cribbed log roof on Norton Sound and Tena houses must then be regarded as survivals of an ancient type, which in southern Alaska was enlarged to fit the kashim, and which, in the east and in the central regions, became metamorphosed into snow. The gabled roof with twin ridgepoles, that is, with two longitudinal members near the middle of the roof, instead of one pole at the apex of the gable, is built by the Cook Inlet Tanaina, and, to judge from the descriptions of our Chugach Eskimo informants, was built in Prince William Sound for the summer "smoke house." Probably the Tanaina learned it from the Eskimo of Cook Inlet. Excluding the Eyak Indians at the mouth of the Copper River, who used a single ridgepole, we find the double ridgepole common on the Northwest Coast down to Salish territory, although the great size of some of the Northwest Coast houses necessitated the addition of extra pairs of</page><page sequence="118">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 111 purlins.73 South of the Salish shed houses, the gabled roof with single ridgepole appears again, as it does in the Kutchin fall house. Unfortu nately, much of the literature is not explicit, emphasis being placed on the gabled shape of the roof, rather than on the method of its con struction. The double ridgepole supporting the gabled roof may well have been a Northwest Coast invention. Nelson does not tell us how the gabled roofs of the summer plank houses of the Yukon Eskimo were built, but some may have had the double ridgepole,74 and the roof of the Tena winter house at Blackburn Slough may have been copied from these. Both double and single-pole roofs were used for Ingalik summer houses. The two-pole gable roof may have originated from the building together of two lean-to's, as is often done by the Interior Salish, and by the Atna on the Copper River.75 Imagine the flimsy covering of the lean-to frame replaced by planks, and imagine the lower edge of the roof raised from the ground by a horizontal pole on two uprights?the same architectural means as that used for the upper edge?so that the eaves are above walls, not on the edge of the ground. Where two lean-to's have grown to gether to form a single building we find a house like the winter mat dwelling of the San poil and Nespellem, or the rectangular plank house of some of the lower Lillooet.76 These houses are generally open all along the top of the roof, but where the two lean-to frames are more completely fused the central part of the roof is partially closed to make several smoke holes. It is only a step further to a single smoke hole. The gabled roof with a single ridgepole may also be derived from the simple lean-to, the roof having grown out on both sides to form a ridged tent. Both types of gabled roof may thus be correlative forms, and both are commonly associated with plank houses. The shed roof of the Coast Salish and the Nootka-Makah have remained closer to the lean-to, since the houses made by these tribes are simply plank lean-to's with walls. The horizontal position of the planks points, in fact, to the earlier use of horizontally placed mats, an old-fashioned type of wall material which is still used for the Salish and Nootka-Makah summer house. 73 Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, p. 367. 74 E. W. Nelson, 1899, pp. 247 f., PI. LXXXII. 75 Teit, 1900, p. 192, Fig. 42, Allen, 1887, pp. 130 f. 76 Ray, 1932, p. 32; Teit, 1906, pp. 213 f, Fig. 79. Waterman emphasizes the primitive architec tural features of these houses which he believes were brought from the interior, the planks being borrowed by the Salish from other tribes al ready settled on the coast. The making of planks was itself dependent on the rise of a highly developed woodworking technique.77 I wonder if we might not take the development of the heavy grooved splitting adz as sympto matic of this progress in wood working. We may anticipate a later discussion by pointing out that it is spread from the Haida and Tsim shian north to the Eskimo of Kotzebue Sound, with the exception of the Aleut and Eskimo of the Alaska Peninsula, to the Tanaina (?) and to the Tena. The sudden appearance of the splitting adz at Cook Inlet in the latter half (?) of Kachemak Bay III gives us, perhaps, a rough clue for dating.781 do not mean to argue any direct connection between the splitting adz and the making of planks, for planks are not made with such adzes, but only that they may both be expressions of a developed wood working culture. The Salish, for example, make planks, but have always lacked the splitting adz. Waterman errs, I believe, in assuming that the Northwest Coast plank house with gable roof was derived from a circular pit dwelling like that of the Interior Salish. "The ridge-pole or gabled construction and the rectangular shape would be easily understood as secondary modifications brought about by the use of planks."79 There may well have been ancient pit houses on the Northwest Coast before plank houses were built, in fact the pit often associ ated with the chief's house as a mark of rank suggests this, but it would be rash to claim that the Northwest Coast house itself descended from this hypothetical pit dwelling, when the architectural principles involved in the plank house point back much more clearly to a lean to than to the braced tipi-like pit dwelling of the Interior Salish. The lean-to and the ridged tent are, of course, of hoary antiquity. Both belong to the Ice-hunt ing stage of culture, and have a wide distribu tion in the Old and New Worlds, where not sup planted by newer types of structures.80 From its distribution, even if we consider only the 77 Waterman, 1921, pp. 26-32. 78 de Laguna, 1934, p. 172. 79 Waterman, 1921, p. 32. 80 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, pp. 21 f.; Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, pp. 516 ff.</page><page sequence="119">112 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 Northwest Coast and adjacent areas, the house with single ridgepole seems to be much older than the house with double ridgepole, and though we suggested a Northwest Coast origin for the latter, it seems hardly possible that the single ridgepole could be an American inven tion. We need only remark that the houses, or at any rate the temples, of the Chinese Shang Bronze Age (1400 B.C.) were essentially like Northwest Coast houses with a single ridge pole,81 and therefore this type of plank house may well be an element of the circum-Pacific culture drift from Asia to North America.82 CACHES Near all the house pits in the village sites which we explored we found a number of small pits, only a few feet in size and a few feet in depth. These were probably caches. Dall states that the Indians were able to preserve frozen meat the year round without spoiling by put ting it in holes dug down to the frozen ground.83 We found baskets of salmon eggs buried in a pit at Bonasila, and at modern fish camps on the Yukon below Blackburn saw the Indians putting up salmon eggs in the same way. The use of a pit cache for fish (so that the fish will rot, except in areas where the ground is frozen) is known from the Alaskan Eskimo, Aleut, Ta naina, Nootka, Tahltan, Carrier, Thompson, Koryak, Kamchadal, Tungus, Yakut, and Samoyed. "It is not unlikely that the method originally came from Asia across Bering Strait."84 The pit cache in general has, of course an extremely wide distribution in both hemispheres. We can mention the Basket makers of our own Southwest, and almost every prehistoric culture in the Northeast, as well as the Neolithic dwellers of Yang Shao Tsun in China and of Achenheim and Stutz heim in Alsace.85 It is even likely that this type of cache, like the semisubterranean house, can be traced back to the Upper Paleolithic of Europe.86 The caches at present used by the Tena for storing dried salmon, frozen meat in winter, fur clothing, etc., are small houses set on poles, entered by means of a ladder (PL IV, 5). These 81 Creel, 1937a, pp. 61 ff., Fig. 1. 82 Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, p. 519. 83 Dall, 1870, p. 37; cf.

A myth explaining the habits of the loon, told by a Nulato informant, mentions such a cache, which would indicate that the Tena built them in prehistoric times. Jette and Os good mention not only the elevated box cache but the unroofed platform cache.87 The elevated storehouse is built by the Es kimo from the Alaska Peninsula to Bering Strait, wherever they can find sufficient wood.88 The stand or rack, made of wood, stone, piles of snow, etc., is probably not a peripheral, de generate form of the box cache, but is more likely to be an older and more wide-spread type of structure. The elevated box cache is also made by the Tanaina, Copper River Atna, Tlingit, Coast and Interior Salish.89 We also find it practically all over Siberia, according to Jochelson.90 In fact, if we care to look farther afield, we can find it in Atlantic Europe, from Spain to the Lapps.91 In Europe as in Siberia, the elevated store house has a close connection with the summer dwelling. Thus, Lattimore writes of the Goldi thatched storehouse on poles that it is "quite possibly ... a survival of an ancient form of dwelling in use until the adoption of the house with its Manchu, Korean and Chinese affini ties."92 Jochelson expresses a similar opinion: "In summer the Kamchadal lived in huts on piles several meters high. ... At present these elevated huts serve as storehouses. In some places, however, they are still used as summer dwellings."93 Among the Gilyak the same struc ture is both the summer house and storehouse.94 These elevated houses and caches in Asia 87 Jette, 1908, pp. 336, 481; Osgood, 1940, pp. 328-332. 88 Kuskokwim-Yukon Delta (Porter, 1893, p. 110), lower Yukon (E.

Thus, Bishop believes that the storehouse of the Ainu, for example, came to them from a Mongoloid people of southeastern Asia who, before the rise of Chinese civilization, had developed a Neolithic culture adapted to shore life with buildings set on piles because of the swamps. He implies that in addition to the pile house, other elements now or formerly found in Japan were derived from this southern cul ture. These include: matrilineal descent, hoe culture, wooden paddle-shaped digging stick, basket-hat, grass raincoat, dugout with prow carved to represent a crocodile, etc. When the Chinese expanded towards the coast in the second and third millennia before Christ, this maritime population was driven out, some of it eventually reaching southern Japan.95 Whether the European dwellings and storehouses on piles, which first appear in the Neolithic, have any connection with southeastern Asia, I can not pretend to say. The box cache on posts seems to belong 95 Bishop, 1926, pp. 552 ff., explanation of Pis. 4, 1; 6, 1; etc. Most of these elements he ascribes to pro to-Japanese culture, but a number of them are traced by Sternberg (1929) from Ainu culture to a southeastern Asiatic origin. among the elements of the circum-Pacific cul ture drift which were derived from Asia,96 and with it came, I believe, the custom of putting the dead in elevated coffins, canoes and grave houses. I do not believe that the dwelling on piles was itself introduced into North America ?it seems already to have degenerated into a storehouse?and so I would consider the scat tered examples of pile dwellings (King Island Eskimo, Haida, Tsimshian, Bella Coola, and Kwakiutl) as accidental reversions to the origi nal function, or more accurately as inde pendent American inventions, stimulated by the cache on posts. The box cache could not have crossed at Bering Strait, for the unroofed platform cache alone is built by the Chukchee and is the dominant type among the Eskimo of Bering Strait. However, there are also diffi culties in arguing that it crossed via the Aleutian Islands, for it is today lacking among the Aleut and Pacific Eskimo. Perhaps among them, as among the Northwest Coast Indians, it was practically superfluous, since these peoples all built houses large enough to ac commodate all their accumulated supplies. 96 Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, p. 519.</page><page sequence="121">CHAPTER VI ARCHAEOLOGICAL COLLECTIONS FROM TENA SITES SUMMARY OF TYPES IN THE COLLECTION THE specimens recovered from the sites visited on the Yukon and its tributaries, or acquired by purchase from others who had visited such sites, comprise about eighty types. In making this count I have considered the ma terial of which the specimens were made, for example, listing netweights of stone as a dif ferent type from netweights of bone, and I have also treated the separate parts of composite implements, like harpoons, as distinct types. If I had considered each of the design elements used to decorate bone objects or pottery as separate types, the list would have had to be still further expanded. Such a list is given below. In the first column are given the types represented by the sup posedly Eskimo material from the vicinity of Holy Cross. In the second, are types from pre historic Tena sites; in the third, types from Tena sites of uncertain age; and in the fourth, types from historic Tena sites, to which are added in parentheses the types actually seen in use in 1935. With the exception of a few types, we might combine in one list all the objects of Indian manufacture in order to obtain a more rounded and still fairly accurate picture of Tena culture before it was influenced by white civilization. Unfortunately our collections are too small and were made in too haphazard a way for us to determine either local or temporal phases. We may say, however, that double-bladed splitting adzes, and perhaps hunting picks, were more common on the middle than on the lower Yukon, while single-bladed splitting adzes and planing adzes were more characteristic of the lower Yukon. None of this material is very old, and certainly nothing that we found had any bearing on problems of early human occupation of the area. It will also be seen that there is nothing very strikingly Eskimo in character in the material from the vicinity of Holy Cross, even though we have listed it as "Eskimo." The scantiness of our collections has prevented us from making as exact a distinction between the Eskimo and Indian cultures as doubtless could be made with more material. We are not surprised that Indian types are so similar to those found in the sup posedly Eskimo group, because there was so much trade between the two peoples (see Chapter II). Only extensive and carefully ex cavated collections can give us information as to the location of the prehistoric boundary between the two peoples. At present we can only point out the greater development of bone arrowheads, barbed bone points, and bone edging in the "Eskimo" material. The Indian collections, on the other hand, contain many different kinds of skin scrapers as against one doubtful "Eskimo" one. The Siberian birch bark box, the trigger for the set bow, the bone comb in one piece (?), and the netting shuttle are probably all rather recent items in Tena culture, but without more detailed archaeological work we cannot set any date for their appearance, This problem will be more fully discussed in Chapters IX and X. In the following pages we shall compare the archaeological Tena material, type by type, with the types reported by Osgood from the lower Tena or Ingalik; in the later sections of this chapter the archaeological types will be de scribed in detail. Chapter VII will deal with the pottery found at Tena and "Eskimo" sites, and Chapter VIII with the specimens, other than pottery, found at "Eskimo" sites.

In the following pages, I list a number of items described by Osgood as 1 Osgood, 1940. The page references in this section are to this work. belonging to the aboriginal Ingalik?on the Yukon from Blackburn to Holy Cross and on the lower Innoko?indicating by references to plates in this book those which were repre sented in our collections. Other items in the list were those which we did not find, but which might be expected in more extensive archaeo logical work. Naturally many objects described by Osgood are omitted here, since it would be very unlikely to find them in digging. The order in this list follows roughly that in the previous lists. In a number of cases I have renamed some of the items, retaining Osgood's names in quota tion, in order to make the nomenclature con form to the terms I have used in describing the archaeological specimens.</page><page sequence="124">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 117 Splitting adz, "with grooves on top," (p. 99), Plates X, 1, 2; XXV, 22, 25; etc. Planing adz, with stone blade, Plates XI, 5; XXV, 13, etc.; with antler blade (not found), (pp. 98-100). Elbow-shaped wooden adz handle (for both types of blade) with bed for the blade on top, Plate XI, 5, modern handle. (No adz haft of bone like our Plate XXV, 9 was men tioned.) (No hunting pick, like our Plate XI, 2, 3, etc., was men tioned, but women going into the woods might carry an adz as protection against bears [p. 100].) Stone ax, with an ungrooved blade lashed to the side, or inserted in a hole in the handle, used for chopping down trees and making cuts for the insertion of wedges (pp. 96-98), (not found). Hammerstone and anvil stone for crushing dried meat or breaking bones (p. 196). (Hammerstone found, but not illustrated. Some of our grinding slabs may have served as anvils.) Bone club made of moose tibia (or caribou tibia, or antler), with a wooden handle inserted at one end. Used for war and for dispatching game and fish (p. 207 f.). (Not found.) (No stone club like our Plate XII, 2, and no stone club or hammer heads like our Plate X, 3, 6, 7.) Wooden maul, a club-shaped wooden implement for driving wedges or stakes (p. 103). (Not found.) Whetstones and grinding stones or slabs (p. 104), Plates XII, 6, 7; XIII, 5, 6,11,12,15, etc. Chalcedony whet stones are said to have been used for chalcedony blades, but I suspect that the identification of the material is doubtful. (No stone saw like our Plates XIII, 1, 3, 18; XXV, 15.) Rubbing stone,"stone skin rubber," a natural fragment of a river boulder or an unshaped piece of broken rock, used to rub skin on the work board, after the white clay with which it has been smeared has dried (p. 81). Is this our Plate XIII, 15,16? Does it also refer to the ulo-shaped stone scraper? Splitting knife with flake blade, "stone bone cutter," made of a flake of chalcedony with a ground point at one corner, lashed to the side of a wooden handle. The flake may also be used unhafted as a burin (engraving tool) or hand drill (p. 94 f.). See Plate XIV, 7,15? Burin of caribou bone, "bone wood scraper," with a point like the Upper Paleolithic screw-driver burin, and sev eral notches on the edge like the parrot-beak burin, used for cutting grooves and bevels in wooden bowls (p. 81 f.). (Not found.) Scraper with ground slate blade, Plates XI, 6; XXV, 14, fastened adz-like to a long, gently curving wooden handle, "stone skin scraper" (p. 79 f.). Scraper with bone blade, Plate XVII, 7 modern, lashed to a pistol-like wooden handle, Plate XIV, 48 (p. 78 f.). (No chipped end scraper blade like our Plate XIV, 4.) (No ulo-like stone scraper, like our Plate XIII, 13, 14, 17, 19, unless it is one form of the rubbing stone mentioned above. The "side scraper" is said to be modern [p. 454].) (No scapula scraper with longitudinal edge like our Plate XV, 24,25,26.) (No leg bone scraper or skinning tool with transverse edge like our Plates XV, 28, 29, 30; XXV, 2.) (No leg bone scraper with longitudinal edge like our Plate XV, 27.) The meagerness of the skin-working tools described by Os good contrasts strikingly with the variety represented in our collections, but it must be remembered that ours were obtained from many Tena groups. (It is not clear whether any knife or weapon mentioned by Osgood had a double-edged slate blade, like our Plate XIV, 11, 16, Plate XXVI, 36. He does, however, describe a lance or spear, "Lance D," with a paddle shaped or leaf-shaped blade of moose bone, never of stone, 6 or 8 inches long, with the tang [?] inserted in the end of a 5-foot birch handle [p. 200 f.]. There is also a knife with a double-edged bone blade, generally concave-convex in outline, lashed to a bed at the side of a wooden handle, used for scraping birch bark, "bone bark scraper" [p. 76 f.]. The slate knife, "stone wood-trimming knife," with a blade 8 inches long, lashed between the two halves of a 5-inch wooden handle, is not described clearly enough to indicate whether the blade was single- or double-edged [p. 90 f.].) Single-edged knives, Plates XIV, 17, 18, 21; XXVI, 37. The "birch bark knife'7 has a slate blade 1 inch long set into the end of a 3J-inch antler handle, and is used for cutting bark on the tree, prior to using the bark remover (p. 89). The "stone skinning knife" has a 4-inch blade of ground red "chalcedony" set into the end of a 5-inch wooden handle (p. 90). The "stone war knife" has a slate blade 12 to 18 inches long and 2 or 3 inches wide, set into the end of a 7-inch handle (p. 208 f.). The "bone knife" with a blade of caribou leg bone, set into a deep slot cut into the edge of the wooden handle at one end, serves a variety of purposes (pp. 91 f.). The blades for harpoon heads and arrows may correspond to our triangular weapon blades of slate, Plates XIV, 12-14; XXVI, 38-41. The blade for the harpoon head, "Lance B," is described as made of "chalcedony," but the shape is unknown (p. 197 f.). The slate blade for the barbed bone arrowhead, "Arrow D," is illustrated as having a triangular shape with rounded basal cor ners. It has a hole for pegging or lashing to the bone arrowhead (pp. 203-206). (We found no weapon blades with holes. Osgood describes none with grooves or with concave base forming barbs.) (No chipped stone arrowheads like our Plate XIV, 1, 2.) Ulo, generally with plain slate blade, Plates XIII, 7-10; XXVI, 42-49, set into a plain wooden handle (found but not illustrated). (No bone or antler handles like our Plate XIV, 29.) Sometimes the blade may have two notches near the back, to hold lashings which pass through two holes in the wooden handle. The handle in this case is made of two pieces, pegged together. (No notched ulo blades or pegged handles found), (p. 89 f.). (No crooked knife like our Plate XIV, 44, but a number of types made with beaver-tooth blades seem to have served the same purpose): Unhafted beaver tooth, sometimes sharpened, which is used as a crooked knife (p. 84 f.). Beaver-tooth draw-knife, made with a wooden handle about 7 inches long, with a slot near one end through which two beaver incisors are thrust. It is used for cutting wood, making shavings, etc., and is drawn towards the body. The handle resembles the wooden bar with hole of Plates XVI, 2; Plate XXV, 4 (p. 87 f.).</page><page sequence="125">118 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 The "beaver tooth chisel" is a combination, chisel scraper-knife, with one or two incisors lashed to a scraper-like handle. The corners of the teeth are used as the cutting edge. The implement with one tooth is used with a motion towards the body, that with two teeth is pushed away (p. 85 f.). (Not found.) Knife handles with hole or slit at the end, Plate XIV, 43, 47, were used for the "birch bark knife," "stone skin ning knife," and "stone war knife." Knife handle with a deep slot at the edge of the end (not found) was used for the "bone knife." Knife handle in two parts lashed together was used for the "stone wood trimming knife" and the antler dagger (see below). (Not found, although a knife handle with iron blade, from the grave at Old Lowden, not illus trated, was made in two parts riveted together.) Knife handle with a bed at the side for the blade, Plate XIV, 46, was used for the "bone bark scraper." (No stone drill points like our Plate XIV, 19, 20.) Two sizes of hand drills, "Gouges A and B," with gouge-like points of antler, ? and \ inches in diameter, respec tively, with wooden handles, flaring at the end. (Pp. 67-70). (Not found.) (No bow or strap drills for making holes.) Bone mouthpiece for strap (rarely for bow) drill for making fire, Plate XIV, 10. Wooden mouthpiece with bone inset (p. 160). (Not found.) (No stone insets for mouth pieces like our Plate XIV, 9.) Bone awls of a number of types: Sewing awl of beaver radius or fibula, sometimes with suspension hole, or of a bird bill set into a wooden handle (pp. 73-75). (Not found.) "Skin puncture awl" for tattooing or piercing girls' nose and ears (pp. 71-73). (If found, not identified.) Awls for making holes in birchbark, "Woman's awl C, Man's awls A and B" (the differences between them are minor), made of caribou bone points with wooden handles (pp. 63-66), Plate XIV, 25. (No bird bone awls like our Plates XIV, 23, 26, 32; XXVI, 13, 14.) "Labret awl," or small chisel-like bone knife for cutting holes in a boy's lower lip for labrets. It might easily be confused with a bone drill point. (Pp. 70 f.). (Not found.) Needles of caribou bone are mentioned, but it is not said whether they had eyes (pp. 73, 188). (Eyed needles mentioned by an informant, but not found.) Snowshoe needle, pointed at both ends and with central hole, or made of a caribou fibula with a notch at the butt (pp. 166-168). (Not found.) (Bags of skin and grass, but none with a handle like our Plate XIV, 27.) Boot sole creaser of caribou bone or lynx ulna, shaped like a little knife-like awl (pp. 88 f.). Plate XIV, 42. Awl-like knife of caribou bone, porcupine or beaver ulna, used to strip off the inner bark of the willow. "Woman's awls A and B" (pp. 61-63). (Not found? These could easily be confused with the boot sole creaser.) "Wood chisel," with awl-like blade, sharpened like a chisel, used for cutting grooves or slots (pp. 66 f.). (This also might be confused with other types. Our bone chisel, Plate XVI, 23, seems to be larger, and was probably used unhafted.) Antler dagger, "horn knife," is double-edged, 12 inches long and 2 inches wide, with a handle of two pieces of wood lashed together (p. 93), Plate XV, 31. Stiletto for fish, "Fish rake B," is a 2-foot pole with a 6-inch point of caribou bone, used for killing dog salmon in a trap (pp. 225 f.). Compare with the modern fish stiletto, Plate XVIII, 5. Harpoon head. (Osgood does not describe either type of harpoon-head found in our collections, Plates XV, 4; XXVI, 1). The type described is a toggle head with closed socket, single spur, and blade parallel to the plane of the spur and at right angles to the line hole. The line hole in the illustration is placed at the base of the spur, but is described as being in the middle of the head. The harpoon, "Lance B," is used for king and dog salmon (pp. 197-199). Harpoon foreshaft is a piece of caribou tibia, set firmly into the end of the wooden shaft. It has no hole for a lash ing, and does not bend (See "Lance B.") Plate XV, 3.

Bone arrowhead with barbs but without blade, is 5-8 inches long, has a detached conical tang, and hole for lashing, and there may be 3-8 barbs on the same side. The rear end of the arrowhead as illustrated is so wide that it does not conform to the slender barbed points which we found (cf. Plate XXVI, 24), but it is possible that others may have resembled these more closely.

Osgood's informant thought it was ab original. In some of the illustrations the circles seem to have been drawn free-hand (pp. 182 f.). (No evidence of the compass was found, and no compass-drawn figures seen on modern specimens.) Realistic painted figures were in outline or in silhouette, sometimes with incised outline. Non-representative de signs were sometimes incised with black pigment</page><page sequence="128">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 121 rubbed into the cuts. The use of the circle (especially the compass-drawn dot-and-circle) and the abundant use of round dots (especially slightly detached at the ends of spurs) make the designs illustrated by Osgood much more like those of the Punuk period on St. Lawrence Island. The Punuk art style has survived to a considerable extent among the Eskimo south of Bering Strait. Our archaeological material, on the other hand, is more like the older Alaskan art which has survived in northern Alaska. (See Chapter IX? Art, pp. 258-267.) SPLITTING ADZES Two forms of the heavy grooved adz which I have termed "splitting adz"1 were found in archaeological sites within the territory of the Tena. One, represented by seven specimens, had a single blade like those which I described from Cook Inlet; four other specimens had a blade at each end. No sharp line should be drawn between the two forms since a broken specimen might, as Chief Luke of Tanana told us, be re finished with a single blade. Both have been illustrated by Hrdlicka who suggested that only double-bladed specimens seem to have been made above Ruby.2 However, I obtained two single-bladed specimens from this area, (PI. X, 8). One of these, unfinished, was obvi ously intended to have only one blade. It is not illustrated. The double-bladed adzes range from 15.2-31 cm in length, 2-4 cm in width, and 3.3-6 cm in thickness. Those with one blade are from 12.5-24 cm in length, 2-5.5 cm in width, and 3-7.5 cm in thickness. The materials used are basalt, greenstone, and tufaceous sand stone (?) containing basaltic material. Two specimens with very narrow pick-like double blades, from the vicinity of the Rapids, were identified by Chief Luke as weapons for hunting bears as well as adzes for splitting wood (Pis. X, 9; XI, 2). Three single-bladed speci mens, from the Tozi (PI. X, 8), Anvik Point (XI, 4), and Shageluk on the Innoko (PI. XI, 3) also have very narrow blades. The last was identified as a pick for chopping holes in the ice as well as for chopping wood. Double-bladed adzes were obtained from the following places: The Rapids; Joseph's fish camp, 7 miles below the Rapids; Adam's place, near Tanana Mission, unfinished; Anvik Point. Single-bladed specimens are from: Adam's place, not illustrated, unfinished; House 12, 1 de Laguna, 1934, p. 65. 2 HrdliCka, 1930a, PL 10, p. 135. Old Fish Camp; just above New Grayling; Anvik Point; Shageluk, Innoko River. Since stone adz blades seem to have been abandoned by the Indians in favor of steel adzes and axes as soon as the latter were im ported by the Russians, I have taken the pres ence of a stone adz and the absence of white men's trade goods as criteria for dating sites as prehistoric. PLANING ADZ BLADES Of the thirteen planing adz blades, none was obtained from the Yukon above the Nowitna, although this should not be understood to mean that the type was not made and used by the Indians above this point. These blades were undoubtedly used for finer work than the heavy splitting adzes just described. In fact, five of the specimens are so thin that they may have been used as blades for scrapers rather than for adzes (PL XI, 6,10-13). One specimen, from the south bank of the Yukon, opposite Kalland (PL XI, 7), was said to have been used as a hunting weapon, but too much credence should not be placed on the native's identifica tion. It is unique in having a notch in each edge for holding the lashings which fastened it di rectly to the handle. The materials used for blades are basalt, greenstone, green chert, and slaty sandstone The blades vary in length from 8-16.5 cm, in width from 2.8-7.1, although the majority fall between 5 and 6 cm, and in thickness from 0.5 2.5 cm. They have been shaped by sawing, chipping, and grinding. A specimen from Hologochaket on the In noko, furnished with a modern handle by the native finder, illustrates the method of hafting (PL XI, 5). The blade has a rather high (for a planing adz), facetted back, and is ungrooved. The handle is made of a V-shaped piece of wood, scarfed on top of the shorter arm to form a bed for the blade. On the lower side is a shoulder to hold the rawhide lashing. This lashing, after securing the blade, runs down the handle, and is fastened by a half hitch about the middle of the handle, and a double hitch at the end where it forms a loop for suspension. The handle is 27 cm long. A similar blade was found at the old site just above Hologochaket (PL XI, 15). These specimens can be compared with one from the Eskimo (?) site at Fox Creek below Holy Cross (PL XXV, 23). Other blades may have been hafted in the same manner. But since a number are somewhat</page><page sequence="129">122 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 thinner than the Hologochaket specimens, they may have been hafted by inserting them into a bone head which was in turn fastened to the wooden handle. This is the common Eskimo method of hafting adz blades. A broken bone adz haft of this type was found at Fox Creek, (PL XXV, P), but we do not know definitely whether or not this method of hafting was practiced by the Tena. The localities from which planing adz blades were obtained are: Yukon River opposite Kalland; Kaltag; House 12, Old Fish Camp; Innoko River just above Hologochaket; Holo gochaket; Anvik Point, three specimens; Bo nasila, four specimens. STONE CHISELS Two blades from Bonasila, too narrow to have served as adzes, are presumably chisels or fine wood-working tools. The first (PL XI, 8) is of greenstone, 5.8 cm long and 1.2 cm wide at the cutting edge; the second (PL XI, 9) is made from a thin slab of andesite, 7.5 by 2 cm. It is impossible to ascertain whether or not these small blades were hafted. STONE HAMMERS AND CLUB HEADS Nine specimens which were obtained were either hammerstones or the heads for hammers or clubs. With one exception which will be discussed separately, these specimens are made of beach boulders of sandstone, quartzite or diorite, varying in length from 9.5 to 22 cm. They show very little shaping, except for the effects of bat tering on the edges and ends. The largest speci men, not illustrated, may have been an unfinished splitting adz. Four unworked stones which were probably held unhafted in the hand come from Adam's place, near Tanana Mission; House 8, Old Fish Camp; and from Bonasila. One of the two hammerstones from the last site is a sandstone bar which was also used as a whetstone (see p. 123, below). A rather long beach stone from House 33, Old Fish Camp, has a pair of notches for at tachment to a handle (PL X, 7). Three specimens have partially worked grooves to hold the lashing which fastened them to a handle. One of these, not illustrated, is from Adam's place; another, from the aviation field at Tanana, is not only grooved, but is shaped to fit against the handle (PL X, 6). The third grooved specimen, which comes from the "Eighteen-Mile Road House" below Ta nana, may possibly have been an unfinished splitting adz or "hunting pick" (PL XI, 1). The final specimen, is so unusual that one would not suppose that it had been made by the Tena (PL X, 3). It was given to me in 1930 by Mr. Ohls, at that time a resident of Anchor age, Alaska, who said that he had found it on the bank of the Melozi River a short dis tance above its mouth. We found no evidence of a site anywhere within three miles of the mouth of the river, but this is not significant since it is rapidly cutting away the silt banks along the lower part of its course. The speci men in question is of limestone, such as might be obtained from the bluffs along the south bank of the Yukon opposite the mouth of the Melozi. The specimen is a club head, perfectly symmetrical and smooth, with bluntly pointed ends, a groove about the middle for a lashing, and a small hole for the insertion of a handle. The groove and the hole (?) show evidence of recent reworking, probably by the finder or his friends. The specimen is 16 cm long and 5.5 cm in diameter. In general appearance it resembles the club heads used by the Plains Indians.3 Bill Alfred who lives at the site of Old Melozi reports that an Indian found a stone club head on the beach at this spot. It was egg-shaped, worked smooth, and had bluntly pointed ends. He does not remember a hole or groove for lashing. The Indian told him that such club heads were sewn up in rawhide and were used for killing people. Mr. Alfred does not remem ber whether he mentioned a handle. If the handle were lacking, the weapon would re semble the throwing stones used by the south western Alaskan Eskimo.4 If it had a handle it would have been quite similar to Plains Indian clubs. If we are dealing with two separate speci mens, the fact that one was actually found near the Melozi should make us less suspicious of the alleged provenience of the second. Of course, both may not have been made on the spot where they were said to have been found, but it is not likely that the Melozi Indians should have imported two of them from any great dis tance. If they are one and the same specimen, which passed from the Indian to Mr. Ohls and 8 Handbook of American Indians, Vol. I, fig. on p. 313, first specimen on the left. 4 de Laguna, 1934, p. 168 ff.</page><page sequence="130">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 123 so to me, the fact that Mr. Alfred saw it either at the time when it was found or soon after wards would prove that Mr. Ohls did not give me a Plains Indian club head by accident or as a joke. In spite of its unusual character we may assume that the specimen I obtained is a Tena implement. STONE CLUB A monolithic club of partially metamor phosed sandstone (PL XII, 2) was obtained from a site on the north bank of the Yukon, 4 miles below Kalland. A naturally flat surface has been utilized for one side; the arched back and narrowed grip for the hand have been shaped by pecking and grinding. The specimen is 26.8 cm long, 7.3 cm wide, and 7.8 cm thick. The handle is 10 cm long and 4 cm in diameter. WHETSTONES The collection contains forty-six whetstones and grinding slabs, ranging in size from 4 to 24 cm in length. The larger slabs are too heavy to have been held in the hand and must have been set on the ground. Two specimens are pebbles, half ground away, as if they had been used as handstones on such grinding slabs (PL XIII, 15, 16; cf. also PL XIII, 12). Other specimens may be described as thin slabs (PL XII, 6, 7), blocks (PL XIII, 12), bars (PL XIII, 6), or unshaped beach stones. They may have from one to five ground surfaces. Four have been grooved for sharpening points (PL XIII, 5, 11). Six slabs bear traces of red paint, showing that they were used for the preparation of pigment (PL XII, 6). It may be significant that four of these six specimens were found in the kashim at Kateel on the Koyukuk, the other two are from House 4 at the same site, and from House 13, New Grayling. All the whetstones and grinding slabs are of sandstone, with the exception of eight of the nineteen specimens found at Bonasila. Of these eight specimens, six are of silicified sandstone, so fine-grained and metamorphosed as to ap proach hornfels or recrystallized slate in char acter; one is of andesite, and the last of silici fied vesicular rhyolite. It is rather interesting to find such a high percentage of hard silicified sedimentary and volcanic rocks at Bonasila, and it is curious that these hard, fine-grained rocks should have been used as whetstones. Whetstones and grinding blocks of similar hard materials are characteristic of the Dorset and Old Bering Sea cultures, but are otherwise rare.5 The proveniences of these whetstones and slabs are: Kateel, kashim, four slabs, House 4, three slabs; Old Fish Camp, House 8, six slabs, House 12, four blocks, one slab also used as a scraper (?), House 33, two slabs; "Inland Bend," Khotol River, one block; House 6, Yukon Willow Creek, one bar; Blackburn Slough, two slabs; House 13, New Grayling, four slabs, one block; Bonsila, thirteen slabs, of which one may be an unfinished adz blade, five bars, of which one may be a broken club. STONE SAWS The only saws or evidence of sawing as a method of working stone are from the Yukon below Nulato, but this does not necessarily mean that saws were unknown above this point. Four stone saws were found, and evidence of sawing is exhibited by an adz blade from Kaltag (PL XI, 18), another from Bonasila (PL XI, 14), a whetstone from Bonasila (PL XII, 7), and a slate blade from New Grayling. Two adz blades from Hologochaket on the Innoko may have been shaped with a saw (PL XI,5,i5). The implements which we have called saws are thin slabs of abrasive rock which were used as files or plow-grinders to cut pieces of rock in two. It is probable that they were kept moist during use, as our whetstones are. They can be recognized by the characteristic profile of the cutting edge, which has been ground rather blunt from use. On both surfaces, which are usually ground smooth, longitudinal scratches can usually be seen along the cutting edge. These tools were not notched or provided with teeth, since the small hard crystalline particles in the rock acted like the cutting ridges of a file. A complete specimen of andesite from Bonasila is 12.3 cm long and 8 cm wide (PL XIII, 18). A saw from New Grayling (PL XIII, 1) has three cutting edges. A fragmentary specimen from Bonasila (PL XIII, 3) may have been used as a scraper, as may a tool from House 8, Old Fish Camp (PL XIII, 2). A very fine sandstone saw was obtained by Hrdlicka at Bonasila and is now in the U. S. National Museum. NOTCHED STONES Only four notched stones were found, and 6 Jenness, 1933, p. 392 and note 22; Collins, 1937a, pp. 154 f.</page><page sequence="131">124 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 none of these is quite like the numerous speci mens from southwestern Alaska.6 They seem to correspond rather to some of the grooved specimens from that region. Two specimens were found at the site of Old Melozi. One is a rather flat beach boulder, 14.5X8 cm, notched at both ends. The other is an irregular egg-shaped boulder, 12 cm long, notched at both ends and on top of a projection on one side. From the "Long Patch of Willows" on the Koyukuk we obtained an oval beach pebble, notched at the ends and at the sides. One end was broken off and renotched for further use (PL XII, 5). The specimen is now 17.7 cm long. A sandstone block from House 12, Old Fish Camp, has three ground surfaces as if it had been used as a whetstone at one time. Notches at the edges form an interrupted groove about the middle. It is 5 cm long. There is nothing to indicate for what purpose these notched stones were used. They may have been netweights, although the stones used for netweights at present are unworked pebbles (cf. PL XVI, 8-11), and an Indian informant at Koyukuk Station denied that notched stones were ever used as netweights. CHIPPED STONE IMPLEMENTS While many fragments of chipped stone, chiefly cores, flakes and irregular lumps were found, there are few finished specimens in the collection. There are only two arrowheads. One from House 8, Old Fish Camp, is of obsidian, leaf shaped, with a simple tang and without barbs. It is 2.6 cm long (PL XIV, 2). Obsidian heads of this type, but with expanding tangs, were reported from Stults's place on the Tanana, just below the mouth of Hot Springs Slough. A poorly worked arrowhead of basalt, possibly unfinished, comes from Bonasila. It is 4.3 cm long and has a pair of notches just above the base of the flaring tang (PL XIV, 1). A leaf-shaped flake of obsidian, retouched on both sides, was found in House 8, Old Fish Camp. It is 2.8 cm long and may have been a knife blade (PL XIV, 3). A retouched jasper flake, 3 cm long, with a sharp point which would have served admirably as an engraving tool, comes from Bonasila (PL XIV, 7). A small 6 de Laguna, 1934, pp. 167 ff. chert implement (PL XIV, 15) was found beside the vertebrae of the disturbed skeleton at Old Lowden. It is 2.5 cm long and may have been an engraving tool or a drill point. It will be remembered that this grave contained Euro pean trade goods. At Adam's place, just below Tanana Mission, we found a small end scraper of obsidian (PL XIV, 4). It is made of a flake only 2.1 cm long and 1.8 cm wide, retouched only on the upper or convex face, and has a rounded edge and a pointed butt. In the woman's grave at the site eleven miles up Anvik River we found an unworked agate pebble. A similar pebble was found in House 11 at the same site. Two agate chips from the kashim at Kateel, two agate pebbles, broken in two, from House 13, New Grayling, and an agate fragment from Bonasila may possibly have been amulets, perhaps in the process of manufacture, since Jette describes "maadza" or amulets as thin, white translucent stones.7 Of the other fragments of chipped stone we need mention only a slender hornfels flake from Bonasila (PL XIV, 5). I originally be lieved that this specimen and a similar flake (PL XIV, 6) from the "Eskimo" site of Fox Creek had been struck from fluted cores like those from the site at the University of Alaska, compared by Nelson with Epipaleolithic and early Neolithic specimens from Mongolia.8 However, a more careful study has shown that the two flakes from the lower Yukon are not identical with the specimens from the Uni versity of Alaska campus. The flakes which I found might have been struck from prepared cores, but since they are of hornfels (silicified and recrystallized slate) which has a natural tendency to split into flakes of this type it is not possible to determine whether the shape of the flakes was due to the character of the ma terial or to the technique of manufacture. I should add that I found no prepared cores of the Fairbanks type and no lamellar flakes other than these hornfels specimens. These bear traces of dulling at the points as if they had been used as knives or as engraving tools. Proveniences of the chipped stone speci mens are: Adam's place near Tanana Mission, obsidian end scraper; Old Lowden, historic grave, chert engraving tool; Kateel kashim, two 7 Jette\ 1908, pp. 315, 345. 8 N.

ULO BLADES There are eleven ulo blades in the collection, of which six are complete. These unbroken specimens all have curved cutting edges, but three fragmentary blades have straight edges. The complete blades range in size from 8.8X8.3 cm (PL XIII, 10) to 13X7.8 cm. (PL XIII, 8). The first specimen is from House 12, Old Fish Camp, and is rather unusual in that the edge is sharpened all the way around. The other blades have dull straight backs, without notches or holes for lashing to a handle. However, they were probably hafted in wooden handles as are the vast majority of Eskimo ulo blades of the same type. The rather rigid way in which these Tena specimens adhere to the idealized pattern of an ulo makes them resemble the "semi-lunar slate knives" of the northeastern Woodlands, rather than the more irregular and varied shapes that one will find in any Eskimo collec tion. These ulos are all of ordinary slate or sandy slate, with the exception of one of green chert from Bonasila, and two of recrystallized slate, like hornfels, from Anvik Point (PL XIII, 4, 8). Proveniences of specimens are: Old Fish Camp, House 8, one specimen, House 12, five specimens; site just above Hologochaket, one specimen; Anvik Point, one specimen; Bonsila, two specimens. That the ulo was also known in the upper part of Tena territory is suggested by a large fragment of worked slate from Adam's place below Tanana Mission. Four fragments of slate blades, too small for identification of the complete form (PL XIV, 18), are from New Grayling. DOUBLE-EDGED SLATE BLADES The collection contains six double-edged slate blades. From House 12, Old Fish Camp, comes the only example of a knife or lance blade with two almost parallel straight edges. This is a type that I have named for Halibut Cove, Cook Inlet, where it was well represented.9 The specimen (PL XIV, 16) is flat on one surface, facetted on the other. Such a cross section is reminiscent of the large copper hunting knives of the Tena, Tlingit, Eyak, and Atna. A knife of this type, hafted as a spearhead for killing bears, was seen at Baker, on the Tanana River (PL III, 2). The facetting of the slate blade may have been copied from that of these copper knives. At Hall's Rapids we found a small fragment of a slate lance blade with a barb. From House 13, New Grayling, we obtained a leaf-shaped lance blade, with tang and shoul ders but without barbs. It has a lenticular cross section and is 8 cm long (PL XIV, 11). Three weapon blades are triangular in out line; two are grooved on the sides, and the con cave base forms a pair of spurs. The complete specimen from House 33, Old Fish Camp, was probably for an arrow, since it is only 3.7 cm long (PL XIV, 13). A similar specimen from Anvik Point is grooved on one side, and prob ably would have been about 4.5 cm long when complete (PL XIV, 12). The third blade is from Bonasila, and was probably for a lance (PL XIV, 14). The base is straight. SINGLE-EDGED KNIFE BLADES The collection contains four specimens which may be described as single-edged knife blades of polished stone. From above the roof of "House" 2 at Bonasila, is a triangular blade of slate, sharpened along one curving edge (PL XIV, 17). The back of the blade has been shaped by sawing. It is not clear whether the butt was intentionally left un smoothed or whether the specimen has been broken. In its present condition, however, it would have been suitable for use in a bone handle like those discussed below which were found at the Old Fish Camp and at Bonasila. From New Grayling there is a fragmentary specimen which may have been either a single edged knife blade or an ulo (PL XIV, 18). It is possible that a slate fragment with straight cutting edge, found in House 8 at Old Fish Camp, and previously listed as an ulo, 9 de Laguna, 1934, p. 72.</page><page sequence="133">126 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 was actually a single-edged knife blade. An other doubtful specimen is a blade from Bonasila with a dull edge. It is of polished diorite (PL XIV, 21). BONE AND ANTLER KNIFE HANDLES The collection contains six handles for men's knives and two handles for ulos. From House 33 at Old Fish Camp, there is a curved antler handle for a crooked knife (PL XIV, 44), such as all the Tena now use. It is 15 cm long. At each end, a small slit, for a blade, is cut in the edge. The slits are at right angles to each other. The blades they formerly contained were not curved. A second handle for a crooked knife was found at Bonasila (PL XIV, 30). In this case, the shape of the socket suggests that the blade was of curved metal, al though the handle may have become warped. If the handle had been straight originally, we would assume it to have been for an ulo. The unbroken end is cut to a blunt angle and the specimen is decorated on one side by a longi tudinal line down the middle, from which three pairs of oblique spurs run to the edge opposite the blade slit. These lines may have been cut with a steel knife. The other side is under rated. Two rectangular bone handles, from Bona sila, have a slit to hold a blade in one edge of the end, and a shoulder on one side to hold the lashing which secured the blade. The butt of the first (PL XIV, 47) was cut off by a steel tool, although the blade slit is so wide as to sug gest that it was for a slate blade. The second specimen (PL XIV, 46) is decorated on both sides near the fore end with two pairs of trans verse lines. A drilled hole near the butt, and the shape of the butt itself suggest that the handle was made from a broken detachable barbed head (see PL XXVI, 6-8). Another knife handle from Bonasila is made of a slab of antler (PL XIV, 31). The butt is cut off to form an oblique point. A slot for the blade is cut in one edge, and both edges at the fore end are notched to hold a lashing. Also from this site is a section of animal bone, 12 cm long, split open (PL XIV, 43). A hole for suspension has been drilled at one end. The other end has been cut across the hollow bone to form two pointed projections with a slot or socket be tween them, but since there is no evidence of a lashing about this socket, we cannot be sure that it was intended for a knife blade. A crude specimen, very similar to this, was found in a site of the Third Period in Kachemak Bay, Cook Inlet.10 From the site across from Hologochaket on the Innoko, there is a bone ulo handle with curved back and rounded ends. A rectangular ulo handle, containing the remains of an iron blade, was found in the woman's grave on Anvik River (PL XIV, 29). Jette's manuscript illustrates both the plain ulo handle of the type just described, and a handle that is longer at the top than at the blade slit.11 The latter has a symmetrically placed oval hole for the fingers. Jette also illustrates the woman's ulo-shaped skin scraper with a handle like the first type of ulo handle. At New Bonasila we saw a woman cleaning salmon with an ulo. DRILLS Jette reports that the Tena used the fibula of a bear, a marten's tooth, or a piece of worked flint for their drill points. A small chipped chert implement, found in the disturbed grave at Old Lowden, may have been a drill point or a small engraving tool (PL XIV, 15). Two drill points were found in House 33, Old Fish Camp: one is of green chert, with a wide butt and an abruptly tapering conical point (PL XIV, 19); the second is a slender rec tangular bar of ground slate, unfortunately broken at the point (PL XIV, 20). An Indian at Kalland told us that a stone mouthpiece for a cord drill had been found near Tom Butler's fish camp across the river. From the sketch he made, we gather that it had a rectangular grip for the teeth and a flaring lower end with a pit in which the drill shaft revolved. A similarly shaped mouthpiece made of caribou astragalus was found in the house pit on Blackburn Slough (PL XIV, 10). The natural pit in the bone was utilized, and the articular surfaces were trimmed away to make a rectangular grip for the teeth. At Spring Camp, on the Khotol, we found a limestone in set for a mouthpiece. It is a disk-shaped pebble, 2.2 cm in diameter, with a pit in one side to hold the drill shaft. An incised line bisects the pitted surface (PL XIV, 9). Andrew Pilot, the shaman at Koyukuk Sta tion, made us a fire drill outfit, with wooden 10 de Laguna, 1934, PL 46,11. 11 Cf. also Jette\ 1908, p. 357.</page><page sequence="134">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 127 mouthpiece like that said to have been found at Butler's fish camp. There is a plain wooden drill, a wooden bow with sinew cord, and a fire board with a simple, unnotched pit. BONE BAG HANDLE OR DRILL BOW From Bonasila there is a piece of animal rib, 20 cm long, with a drilled hole in each end (PL XIV, 27). The dorsal articulation has been left at one end. It may have been the carrying handle for a bag or the bow for a drill. AWLS The collection contains five bone and antler awls. A bird bone specimen from House 12, Old Fish Camp, is decorated with three pairs of longitudinal lines, with alternating oblique spurs. The articulation at the butt has been rounded off (PL XIV, 23; Fig 25, 4). An un derrated bird bone awl was found at the same site (PL XIV, 32). From House 13, New Grayling, there are two awls; one is a strip of antler with a rather clumsy point (PL XIV, 25), the second is a splinter from what appears to have been a decorated bird bone tube (PL XIV, 26). The first specimen has a few incised lines, suggesting an attempt at decoration. The tube from which the second was cut seems to have been deco rated with a row of oval figures, enclosed be tween two longitudinal lines. A slender bone bodkin or awl was found in House 6, Yukon Willow Creek, on the upper Khotol (PL XIV, 22; Fig. 25, 5). The decora tion consists of three lines with spurs encircling the head. Below these are two longitudinal lines with alternating oblique spurs on both sides. Between these lines on each side is a row of dots. The dots and spurs have been cut with a sharp chisel-shaped engraving tool. Caribou splints with naturally sharp points that could have served as awls were found at House 33, Old Fish Camp, and at Bonasila. BOOT SOLE CREASERS For crimping the soles of the sealskin "water boots," that is, boots of Eskimo pattern worn in wet weather in the spring and summer, the Indians of the Koyukuk and lower Yukon make use of a slender awl-like implement with a flat point. A modern specimen was purchased at Anvik and two archaeological specimens which were obtained were identified by the natives. The first, from the kashim at Kateel, is made of a split bird bone (PL XIV, 42). The second, from the woman's grave on Anvik River, is made of the leg bone of a small mammal and has a hole in the butt for suspension (PL XIV, 24). SCRAPERS EOR WORKING SKINS A variety of tools are used by the present Indians on the middle and lower Yukon for preparing hides and skins. A complete collec tion of these was made at Tanana Mission and implements of the same kind were found at archaeological sites. For skinning the animal, the Indians use a tool made of a split caribou leg bone, with sharpened and notched transverse edge (PL XVII, 7, 8). Jette figures such a tool, however, as a scraper. It consists of a split moose tibia, with notched edge across one end, the butt being hafted in the end of a section of green birch weighing from two to five pounds. The bone blade, according to his description, is from 5 to 6 inches long. As a flesher, for removing the fat and for scraping the hair from frozen hides, the Tena use a bent or straight iron blade, sometimes with a notched edge, hafted in a curved wooden handle (PL XVII, 3-6). The corresponding tool, used before the introduction of steel, is represented by the thin adz-like scraper blade (see p. 121) and by chipped end scrapers. Our only archaeological example of the latter type (PL XIV, 4) is, however, too small to have been used on skins. A wooden handle for a skin scraper with chipped end blade was found across from Hologochaket (PL XIV, 48). A two-handed scraper was used for removing hair from raw skins. This may be a piece of strap iron with each end wrapped in cloth to form a grip (PL XVII, 2), or it may be a split caribou leg bone with sharpened longitudinal edges (PL XVII, 1). The bone type was, of course, the only kind used in prehistoric times. The hide to be treated is laid over a hori zontal pole and the two-handed scraper is drawn towards the user. The hides are then smoked and soaked in a mash made of the animal's brains. After smoking and soaking in brain mash, the hide is laid on the pole and scraped again. A little canvas tent for smoking hides and the horizontal pole on which they were scraped were photographed at Tanana Mission (PL IV, 7). Fine, soft skins are finished with an ulo</page><page sequence="135">128 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 shaped scraper, held in one hand. Some of these are now of iron, with either a straight or a curved notched edge (PL XVII, 9, 10), but some women told me that they preferred the old blades made of chipped stone, since these do better work. The process of alternate soak ing and scraping is repeated until the skin reaches the desired state of softness. WOODEN SCRAPER HANDLE A wooden handle for a scraper, similar to handles now used with iron blades (cf. PL XVII, 3, 5), was found at the recent site op posite Hologochaket on the Innoko. It is curved so that the grip is at right angles to the plane of the blade; the blade was fastened in a bed on the lower side of the haft (PL XIV, 48). STONE SCRAPERS In our discussion of planing adzes (p. 121) we mentioned five blades which might have been used for scrapers or fleshers, and it is also pos sible that some of the other small blades de scribed as adz blades could have been used for scrapers. A whetstone from Old Fish Camp, with one end roughly chipped, was also men tioned as a possible scraper (p. 123). By far the greater number of stone scrapers (about a dozen) are of the ulo-shaped type; these were used for softening skins during the final stages of preparation. They are thin slabs of rock, chipped to an oval or sub-oval outline, and vary in size from about 8X10 to 10.5X16 cm. The materials are slate, sandstone, ande site, etc. Two ulo-shaped scrapers of chipped slate come from Jackson Creek on the Yukon above Tanana. One of these is a roughly worked oval slab (PL XIII, 19), the other is neatly chipped with a curved scraping edge and a straight back (PL XIII, 17). I saw a specimen closely re sembling the latter among the artifacts which had been sent to Dr. N. C. Nelson for study from the site at the University of Alaska.12 A similar scraper was found at Kalland between Tanana and the Nowitna, and is still being used by the woman who picked it up. There are two specimens from Old Fish Camp on the Khotol. The first of these, from House 12, is a broken sandstone boulder chip; the second, from House 8, a slab of sandstone, with ground 12 This is proably the specimen he describes as a "chop ping tool or scraper" (N. C. Nelson, 1937, p. 268). surface and curved ground edge (PL XIII, 2), has already been mentioned as a possible saw (p. 123). Bonasila has yielded many scrapers. These are chips and sharp-edged slabs of andesite, picked up on the beach and often utilized with out further shaping. The crude workmanship of those that have been retouched, of which Hrdlicka secured a number,13 suggested at first that they might have belonged to an early culture at the site. I believe, however, that they are no different from other ulo-shaped scrapers of the Tena. In addition to the seven specimens mentioned below, we found many other sharp edged fragments of andesite on the beach and in the river bank, but did not save these be cause they showed no signs of actual use. The seven catalogued specimens are roughly rec tangular slabs which show signs of use on one edge; one specimen has three utilized edges. One specimen has a curved scraping edge (PL XIII, 13), another has an almost straight edge with a notch at the unbroken end to hold a lashing or winding which served as a grip (PL XIII, 14). In addition to the seven scrapers from Bonasila, there is also a very large scraper or cleaver of andesite, with curved edge, meas uring 29X19 cm (PL XII, 3). BONE SCRAPERS Three types of bone scraper were found. The first is made of a caribou scapula with a longi tudinal sharp edge; the second is a split long bone with longitudinal edge (that is, a two handed scraper for removing hair from raw skins); and the third is a split long bone with transverse edge (that is, a skinning tool or scraper). The last two types have their modern analogies, as we have pointed out (p. 127, PL XVII, 1, 7, 8), but the scapula scraper has not. It may have been a depilating scraper to be held in one hand. Four scapula scrapers were found, three at the Old Fish Camp, the fourth at Bonasila. Only one from the first site is complete. It is from House 12, measures 5X3.8 cm, and is unusual in having on each side an incised figure of a bird, probably a duck (PL XV, 26, and Fig. 24, 2). A fragmentary scraper from House 8 (PL XV, 25, and Fig. 24, 1) is decorated on one side by the figure of a duck (?) without legs, and a crude representation of a man in a long frock. The head is not particularly human, 18 Hrdlicka, 1930 a, PL 11, esp. upper left.</page><page sequence="136">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 129 however, and the hands have three fingers. The style, although cruder, is rather similar to Eskimo designs from the mouth of the Yukon.14 On the other side is an incomplete figure of a bird. The third fragment, from House 12, is undecorated. The scraper from Bonasila, was originally larger. The end is rounded and the natural ridge along one side has been left. The ridge is decorated by three short transverse cuts (PL XV, 24). There are only two examples of the split leg bone scraper with longitudinal edge. These are both from House 8, Old Fish Camp, and, un fortunately, both are broken (PL XV, 27). There are twelve scrapers or skinning tools with transverse edge, made of caribou leg bone. Identification of all of these is not certain be cause a number are broken at the sharpened end. Eight are from House 8, Old Fish Camp, (PL XV, 28-30), three from House 12, and one is from Bonasila. The only complete specimen, from House 8, is 22.5 cm long (PL XV, 30). The sharp end is not notched as on some modern specimens; the articulation has been left as a handle. Skin scrapers were found at the following places: Jackson Creek, above Tanana, two ulo shaped scrapers; Old Fish Camp, House 8, saw or ulo-shaped scraper, scapula scraper, two leg bone scrapers with longitudinal edge, eight leg bone scrapers with transverse edge, House 12, adz or scraper blade, whetstone or scraper, ulo shaped scraper, two scapula scrapers, three leg bone scrapers with transverse edge, House 33, fragment of leg bone scraper (?); House 6, Yukon Willow Creek, fragment of leg bone scraper (?); site opposite Hologochaket, scraper handle; House 13, New Grayling, two frag ments of leg bone scrapers (?); Anvik Point, three adz or scraper blades; Bonasila, adz or scraper blade, seven ulo-shaped scrapers, ulo shaped scraper or cleaver, scapula scraper, leg bone scraper with transverse edge, five frag ments of leg bone scrapers (?). BONE DAGGER A fine bone dagger, 29 cm long, was obtained at Anvik Point. It is made of a split leg bone of a caribou with the articulation at one end trimmed for a handle. The other end is worked to a sharp point (PL XV, 31). The point of a similar dagger was found at Bonasila. At present the Tena on the lower Yukon use 14 Dall, 1870, fig. on p. 237. a stiletto for killing fish caught in nets before lifting them into a canoe. The stiletto is made of a sharp bone pin like an awl, lashed to a short wooden handle (PL XVIII, 5). Unless some of the specimens described as awls were actually fish stilettos, this type is not represented in our archaeological collection. Jette figures the salmon stiletto but says that the wooden handle is generally two feet long. HARPOON HEAD A single toggle harpoon head with socket was found in House 13 at New Grayling. It is of antler, 7.5 cm long, and has an open socket to be closed by a lashing in a groove (PL XV, 4). There is a medial spur but no barbs. The line hole has been gouged with a hand drill at the upper end of the socket. The point has been broken and reshaped. It is possible that it once had an end blade, since the dorsal side of the head shows what may be the remains of a groove for the lashing to hold a blade. EORESHAFT (?) In the same house pit at New Grayling we found a flat bone point, 6.2 cm long and 1.3 cm wide, tapering more abruptly towards one end than towards the other (PL XV, 3). Although there is no hole for the line, it might have served as the foreshaft for a harpoon head like that found near it. SOCKET PIECE (?) A water worn antler specimen from Bonasila seems to have been half of a socket piece made in two parts (PL XV, 20). It is 6 cm long, is decorated on the outside by a longitudinal line, and has two wide grooves for lashing to the complementary piece. It is much weathered on the inner surface, and this bears a drilled pit, suggesting that the specimen at one time served as a rest for a drill. Half of a wooden socket piece of the same type, 8.2 cm long, was found in the house pit on Blackburn Slough. It has a groove and shoulder for lashing to the opposite half, and narrows to a tang at the butt for insertion into a wooden shaft (PL XV, 21). It is difficult to understand why a socket piece should have been made of wood, unless the wood was tougher and stronger than that used for the shaft, or unless the socket at the end of the shaft had been broken and needed repairing, but, in any case, bone or antler would have been better.</page><page sequence="137">130 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 TJNBARBED BONE ARROWHEADS Three bone arrowheads without barbs or inserted blades were obtained. The first, from a spot four miles below Kalland, is made of a splinter of animal leg bone, 16.3 cm long, and has a scarfed tang with a slight shoulder on one side for attachment to the shaft (PL XV, 2). The second specimen, from Dolby on the Koyukuk, is 20.7 cm long, with a roughly triangular section. It lacks a distinct tang or scarf, and simply narrows towards the butt. On one side there are traces of a decorative longi tudinal line (PL XV, 1). The third specimen, from Anvik Point, is so badly weathered that we cannot be sure that it did not once have barbs (PL XV, 8). It has a scarfed tang and is 12.6 cm long. BARBED BONE ARROWHEADS AND POINTS While we found eleven barbed bone points that might have been used for arrows or as prongs for leisters (multipronged weapons), it is perhaps significant that we did not obtain any definite example of a detachable barbed head from the Yukon Valley above the Holy Cross district. One possible specimen is the knife handle from Bonasila, which may have been made from a broken detachable barbed head (PL XIV, 46), and there is also a broken barbed specimen from the same site (PL XV, 16) which could have been detachable, al though we have classed it among the arrow heads (see below). On the other hand, Jette describes and il lustrates in his manuscript two types of de tachable barbed points used by the Tena, so it was only an accident that we did not find any. However, we may infer that they were not used as much by the Tena as by the Yukon Eskimo. The first type illustrated by Jette is a harpoon arrow for beaver or pike. The head has two pairs of barbs symmetrically placed and a detached conical tang below the line hole. The line was of sinew, the slack being wound around the fore end of the arrow shaft. The second type of barbed head was used with the fish spear. Jette has sketched examples with two or three barbs on one edge, or with three symmetrical pairs of barbs. The tangs seem to have been wedge-shaped, and the line hole was drilled, not through the tang, but through the middle of the head, so that the head would toggle. The line was attached to the fore part of the spear shaft. Our collection contains eleven barbed points which were presumably attached permanently to the shafts. These are of bone or antler, the majority ranging in length from 14 to about 20 cm, with one very long specimen 32.7 cm long (PL XV, 15). The majority also have from five to seven barbs along one edge; the largest specimen, however, has ten barbs, and one specimen, already mentioned as having pos sibly been detachable, has only three barbs on one edge (PL XV, 16). One fragmentary speci men may have had three rows of barbs (PL XV, 10). There is considerable variation in the profile of the barbs, the shape of the tang, and the cross section of the head, so that it is im possible to describe these specimens as a group. While all but one specimen are probably heads for arrows, these ten specimens may be sub divided into those which we should not hesitate to describe as arrowheads, and those which resemble in style the slender barbed points from Yukon Island I and III in Kachemak Bay,15 even though one of these was identified by the natives as an arrowhead. One specimen from Anvik Point is 13.3 cm long, with four barbs on one edge. The opposite edge is quite straight, and the tang is cut down obliquely from the edge below the barbs. This asymmetry suggests that it was a point for a multipronged weapon?arrow, dart, or spear? not for a single-pointed arrow (PL XV, 19). Five specimens are clearly arrowheads. One of these is made of a split animal long bone, only 11.5 cm long, and was obtained at Kalland. It has a pointed flat tang, and five poorly cut barbs along one edge (PL XV, 18). A well-made arrowhead with six small barbs on one edge was found at House 4, Kateel. It has a sharp wedge shaped tang set off by shoulders, and is fur nished with a pair of notches for attachment. It is 16.7 cm long, and was identified by Andrew Pilot, of Koyukuk Station, as an arrow head for beaver (PL XV, 13). An antler arrow head from Bonasila has a row of six small barbs, a conical point and tang, and is triangu lar in cross section. It is 17 cm long (PL XV, 17). There are also two broken specimens from the same site. The first has three or four barbs along one edge, but is badly weathered (PL XV, 11). The second, with three large barbs on one edge, and a longitudinal line down one side which was obviously cut with a stone tool, has recently been reshaped. The butt has been cut off with a steel knife, so that we do not know 16 de Laguna, 1934, pp. 90 f.</page><page sequence="138">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 131 what kind of tang it formerly had. It may have been a detachable head (PL XV, 16). Five specimens were probably arrowheads also, although they are like the slender barbed points of Kachemak Bay. A fragmentary specimen from House 8, Old Fish Camp, is from the fore end of a slender barbed point of Yukon Island type III. It is triangular in section, and is decorated on each surface by a pair of longi tudinal lines. These probably outlined three rows of barbs, although the fragment itself lacks barbs (PL XV, 10). The four remaining specimens apparently had only one row of barbs, and resemble more the larger slender barbed points of Yukon Island type I. The largest barbed specimen in the collection, pur chased at Anvik Point, and identified by the native finder as an arrowhead for pike, is 32.7 cm long. It has ten small barbs, the lowest three being slightly larger and more widely spaced than those above. It has a detached conical tang, with a small slot-like hole above to which was formerly fastened the sinew attaching it to the arrow shaft (PL XV, 15). The last three slender barbed points come from Bonasila. One, 19.7 cm long, has a detached conical tang and seven barbs outlined by a pair of longitudinal lines (PL XV, 14). A broken specimen is ap parently of the same type (PL XV, 9). The remaining point, 14 cm long, has six barbs, lacks incised lines, but has two knobs on the detached conical tang (PL XV, 12). The proveniences of these barbed specimens are: Kalland, arrowhead; House 4, Kateel, arrowhead; House 8, Old Fish Camp, slender barbed point; Anvik Point, slender barbed point identified as arrowhead, leister prong; Bonasila, three slender barbed points, three arrowheads. BLUNT ARROWHEADS There are three blunt arrowheads for stun ning birds or small fur-bearing animals. The first is from House 12, Old Fish Camp. It is oval in section, with an enlarged fore end tapering to a blunt conical point. The tang is missing (PL XV, 5). The second is from "In land Bend," also on the Khotol, and has also lost its tang. The enlarged fore end has a central prong surrounded by four blunt points (PL XV, 7). Jette illustrates a similar head in his manuscript. The third specimen, from Anvik Point, has a simple blunt end, like the first, and there are two small drilled holes in the tang to facilitate hafting. The base of the tang is broken (PL XV, 6). BONE BARBS FOR FISHHOOKS AND FISH SPEARS The collection contains seven specimens which may have been barbs for fishhooks and fish spears. Jette has figured a compound fishhook made of two pointed birch twigs, lashed together at an acute angle. The shank is 6 inches long, the pointed barb, itself unbarbed, 3 inches. Two bone points, found at House 12, Old Fish Camp, may have been barbs for similar hooks. The first, 4.2 cm long, has a wedge-shaped butt, shouldered at one edge for insertion into the wooden shank (PL XIV, 35). The second speci men is simply a sharpened splinter of bird bone, roughly broken off at the butt (PL XIV, 34). It may, however, have been part of an awl or needle. At Anvik Point we obtained a rather re cently made specimen which seems to be part of the barb for a fish spear (PL XIV, 36). It is flat and rather blunt, and is scarfed for inser tion into a wooden side prong. It was broken, and then mended by a sinew lashing through two pairs of holes. It has been broken again. Identification is not certain; and it may have been the wedge-shaped tang of a weapon point. Four fish-spear barbs were found at Bonasila. One, made of a leg bone of an animal, is 14 cm long (PL XV, 22). It has a sharp point and a bluntly pointed butt, cut across diagonally and ending in a knob to hold the lashing. The other specimens are simply splinters of bone (PL XV, 23); two are fragments of animal rib, the third is a bird bone. All are curved and are notched at the butt for attachment. They have worn notches along one edge as if they had formerly had barbs which have been worn off. NETS The nets of the prehistoric Tena were prob ably made with shuttles, but the only archae ological specimen obtained cannot be very old, judging by the freshness of the material (PL XVI, 13, and Fig. 25, 2). This is an antler shuttle from Anvik Point, ornamented with two lines on each side, running longitudinally from prong to prong. The lines have oblique spurs on the outer edge. Netting shuttles and net gauges used by the modern Indians vary in size according to the type of fish for which the net is intended (PL</page><page sequence="139">132 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 XVIII, 1, 2, 4, 8). Nets were formerly of two strand cord made from the dried inner bark of the willow (PL XVIII, 3). Making, setting, and tending nets is women's work. It is men who make and use fish traps and their modern sub stitute, the fish wheel (PL IV, 2, 4). Four wooden net floats, ranging in length from 11 to 14.5 cm, were found on the Khotol River. The first is from House 8, Old Fish Camp. It is a slab, straight on one edge, convex on the other, with a small knob at each end for fastening to the net (PL XVI, 15). A similar object from the same house is notched along the curved edge, but lacks notches for attach ment (PL XVI, 17). An irregularly shaped float, notched at the ends, was found at "Inland Bend" (PL XVI, 14). An oval float with a drilled hole in each end comes from a house pit at Paul Esmailka's fish camp (PL XVI, 16). Netweights of stone, bone, and antler were found. The stone weights are simply unworked pebbles, like those which the present natives sew or tie into little cloth bags for securing to their nets. Perhaps in former days they were put into rawhide bags. The archaeological specimens are oval pebbles, from 4.9 to 9 cm long and from 1.5 to 3 cm in diameter. Four were found in House 12, Old Fish Camp (PL XVI, 8-11), two in House 6, Yukon Willow Creek, one in House 13, New Grayling, and two at Anvik River. If these specimens had not been found in house pits, where they had cer tainly been left by the natives, we should not have noticed these little pebbles. However, it is possible that some of the specimens identified as netweights were actually used for smoothing the interior of pots (see Chapter VII, p. 142). Two bone netweights were found. The first of these (PL XVI, 19) from Anvik Point, has two holes drilled through the corners near one edge. The other edge is rounded. It is 11.8 cm long. The second (PL XVI, 20), from Bonasila, is a rectangular slab of bone, 9 cm long, with a drilled hole at one end and the remains of a second hole at the other. It is possible, however, that this specimen was some kind of handle. BONE AND ANTLER WEDGES Fifteen wedges and wedge-shaped tools of bone and antler were collected. Of these, ten are wedges for splitting wood. These are sec tions of antler, ranging in length from 8.5 to 15 cm and in width from 2.2 to 4.8 cm; they are trimmed to a wedge at one end and roughly finished at the butt. The butts in most cases show signs of battering (PL XVI, 26, 28, 30 32), but one specimen shows no signs of use (PL XVI, 22). Two pieces of antler, both from House 6 at Yukon Willow Creek, on the Khotol, are possibly fragments discarded in the process of making wedges (PL XVI, 24). Two wedges, one, from Pit D at Kateel (PL XVI, 27), the second, from the site across the In noko from Hologochaket (PL XVI, 29), have asymmetrically cut edges, but these may have warped. One wedge, 18.3 cm long, from House 4, Kateel, seems to have been intended for strip ping bark, not for splitting wood (PL XVI, 25). Andrew Pilot, of Koyukuk Station, identified it, however, as an ice pick. There are, in addition, two bone chisels, both about 8.3 cm long and less than 2 cm wide." These are from House 12, Old Fish Camp (PL XVI, 23) and Blackburn Slough (PL XVI, 21). The proveniences of these specimens are: Kateel, House 4, bark-stripping wedge, Pit D, wedge, kashim, wedge; Old Fish Camp, House 8, wedge, House 12, five wedges, chisel; Yukon Willow Creek, House 6, two fragments from wedge making; Blackburn Slough, chisel; site opposite Hologochaket, wedge; Bonasila, wedge. WOODEN SHOVEL A shovel with a narrow paddle-shaped blade showing evidence of charring was found in the house pit on Blackburn Slough. It is now 66 cm long, with the blade measuring 21X9 cm. The end of the handle is broken. Jette reports that the Indians used to make snow shovels of tough roots, but these must have had broader blades. Our specimen was probably used for moving hot rocks or ashes. BOW AND TRAP A specimen of wood from the kashim at Kateel was identified by Andrew Pilot as the trigger for a set bow (PL XVI, 5). It is a flat wooden rod, 7.5 cm long, with a small shoulder at each end on opposite sides. Another wooden specimen from the same site may be part of a trap (PL XVI, 6). It is a flat piece of wood with a deep notch in one edge, and is 7.8 cm long. Jette has illustrated the type of trap to which such a piece might belong. Four posts, set upright in the ground, serve as the frame. On the ground between them lies a log, over which is supported a second log. When the trap is sprung, the upright posts make it fall directly on the lower log. When the trap</page><page sequence="140">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 133 is set, one end of the upper log is supported on a vertical stick, which in turn rests in the notch of a small wooden pin like that found at Kateel. The notched pin rests on the lower log, with one end projecting upward. The bait is attached to this end, and when the animal touches it the stick supporting the upper log is thrown down. The ordinary hunting bow, plain and with out sinew backing, but furnished with a pro jecting wooden guard to catch the bow string on its recoil, was not represented in our arch aeological collections. Such a bow was photo graphed at Nenana on the Tanana; the Indian used the Mediterranean arrow release (PL III, i). MISCELLANEOUS WOODEN OBJECTS A wooden rod, 23 cm long, with a rectangular cross section, was found in House 12, Old Fish Camp. It is slightly wider at one end than at the other, and this end has been shaped to a blunt wedge. The other end is charred (PL XVI, 1). It is probably an implement for softening the soles of Eskimo-type boots after they have become stiff from wetting, since it resembles a specimen used by the protohistoric Eskimo of St. Lawrence Island.16 From House 8, Old Fish Camp, there is a flat wooden bar with a rectangular hole at one end. A similar specimen, 20 cm long, which fortunately seems to be almost complete, was found in House 13, New Grayling (PL XVI, 2). They may be wooden handles, or parts of the frame for some object, such as a rack, sled, canoe, etc. In House 6, Yukon Willow Creek, we found half of a thin wooden disk, 3.5 cm in diameter, with a hole in the middle. It is probably part of a top, like those used as toys by Tanaina and Kutchin children.17 A slender wooden pin, 7.2 cm long, and a peg with a tang were found at Blackburn Slough. Other scraps of worked wood were found in the kashim at Kateel; in House 12, Old Fish Camp; in the kashim at Yukon Willow Creek; and at Blackburn Slough. MISCELLANEOUS WORKED BONE AND ANTLER Half of a section of antler, split in two and hollowed out on the inner surface to form two sharp longitudinal edges, was found in House 16 Geist and Rainey, 1936, p. 147, PL 48, 6. 17 Osgood, 1936, pp. 95,100; 1937, p. 124. 4, Kateel. It is 14.2 cm long and 2.3 cm wide (PL XVI, 12). The ends are rounded off and beveled from the outer convex surface. Andrew Pilot tried to explain that it was connected in some way with a bow string. However, the sharp edges and the lack of any means for attach ment would indicate that it was not a wrist guard. It does resemble the pieces which the Eskimo set under the sinew lashing of a backed bow to strengthen it at points of strain, so this is probably a bow reinforcement. From the kashim at Kateel there is a frag mentary bone point or butt of some implement. It is broken, but one end has been worked to a flat point. A thin bone strip, flat on one side and fur nished with a shoulder across the unbroken end on the rounded side, was found in House 1, Spring Camp, Khotol River (PL XVI, 7). A piece of bone from House 33, Old Fish Camp and another from New Grayling seem to have been parts of ice picks. According to Andrew Pilot, the Koyukuk Tena made ice picks of bone. A fragment of bone from House 12, Old Fish Camp, possibly part of a scraper, is decorated with two parallel lines, each with a pair of oblique spurs on the outer sides (Fig. 25, J). A fragment from House 33, at the same site, is decorated with a line with three slanting spurs on the same side (Fig. 25, 1). Fragments of cut and split bone and of cut antler were found at a number of sites but need no mention. WOODEN SPOON AND DIPPER The Indians on the Yukon still carve wooden spoons and dippers. A fine specimen was photo graphed at Baker, on the Tanana (PL XXII, 8). The design on the bowl is rather similar to that in the bowl of an Eskimo pottery lamp from the lower Kuskokwim.18 Plain wooden spoons were seen at Koyukuk Station and at Anvik, and two very fine spoons with cut-out handles were seen at Nulato. A broken, thin, rectangular strip of antler with a hole gouged through the narrow end was found at Bonasila. It is possibly the handle of a small spoon (PL XIV, 28). In House 4, Kateel, we found a fragment of a wooden dipper (PL XVI, 4). This piece of the bowl is painted black and has two shallow lines on the outer surface, following the curved edge. 18 Specimen in PMH.</page><page sequence="141">134 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 STONE INSET FOR A WOODEN BOWL At Bonasila, we found a small limestone inset for the rim of a wooden bowl (PL XIV, 45). It is a pointed oval in outline, flat on the under surface, and rounded on the other, although it lacks the pronounced facets frequently seen on modern specimens. Several wooden vessels with similar insets were purchased at Anvik and one of these is illustrated for comparison (PL XXII, 7). Nelson writes:19 The Tinne* of the lower Yukon, adjoining the territory occu pied by the Eskimo, are expert in woodworking. They fashion from spruce large numbers of wooden dishes, buck ets, trays, and ladles, which they ornament with red and black paint, and the maker usually places his totem [?] mark on each utensil. The specimens we purchased were stained with red paint; near the edge, one has traces of a simple black border and of some design in black paint, on the bottom. COMBS Two combs were found. One of these, made of bone and originally furnished with six teeth, was found in the kashim at Kateel (PL XIV, 39). It is 12.5 cm long and 3 cm wide. The rectangular grip narrows slightly from a maxi mum width at the base of the teeth and is cut to form a slight angle with the teeth when seen in profile. The upper edge of the handle is so sharp that it could have been used as a scraper. An antler comb from Bonasila is made of a thin rectangular slab and has eleven short teeth, apparently cut with a steel saw (PL XIV, 38). The handle is slightly narrowed in the middle. The specimen measures 6.5 by 4.3 cm. BIRD BONE TUBES A broken bird bone tube was found in House 6, Yukon Willow Creek. Its decoration, a design apparently incised with a stone tool, has been filled with red paint (PL XIV, 41 and Fig. 25, 6). The tube is encircled by four lines with alternating spurs on both sides, the three lower lines being placed rather close together. From these, run two longitudinal lines with alternating oblique spurs on both sides. Below these again is an encircling line with spurs. Because the specimen is broken, we do not know whether the design was symmetrically placed on the tube. 19 E. W. Nelson, 1899, p. 70. An undecorated bird bone tube, 8.2 cm long, was found at Blackburn Slough. Another plain tube, 8.3 cm long and broken in two, with a drilled hole at one end, was found at Bonasila. These tubes may have been needle cases, drinking tubes, handles, etc. ORNAMENTS A bone pendant (PL XIV, 37), with a conical point at the lower end and a small gouged hole at the other, for suspension, was found in House 6, Yukon Willow Creek. It is 6.5 cm long, and is decorated by a longitudinal line incised from the hole to the point. At the same site we also found an ornamental bone plate, possibly a belt buckle (PL XIV, 33). It would have measured about 3 by 3.3 cm when complete. It has a hole through the center and is decorated by a line of drilled pits or dots around the edge and across the middle, and by a group of four dots between the central hole and the longer edge. Presumably there was a similar group of dots on the portion which is missing. A bone carving, representing a mouse, was found in House 8, Old Fish Camp (PL XIV, 40). The ears are indicated but the specimen is so badly weathered that we cannot be sure whether the eyes and mouth were also shown. It is only 3.5 cm long. A coarse sandstone boulder, 13.5 by 11 cm, was found on the beach of the Yukon just south of the mouth of Blackburn River. It has a few lightly pecked lines on it indicating the eyes and mouth of a human face (Fig. 23). The woman's grave at the Anvik River site contained, among other things, a quantity of unworked caribou incisors. These probably served as a decoration for some object, probably a belt like those worn by the Eskimo women, from the lower Kuskokwim to the Arctic, and which are decorated with overlapping pieces cut from caribou jaws containing the incisors.20 RED PAINT It will be remembered that pictures in red paint were reported on rocks in the Tanana valley near Fairbanks and near Mile 35 on the railway from Nenana to Seward. Paintings were also reported from the headwaters of Beaver Creek, a tributary to the Nowitna River. We have also mentioned that five sandstone whetstones or grinding slabs from Kateel, and 20 E. W. Nelson, 1899, p. 58, PL XXVII, 19.</page><page sequence="142">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 135 one from New Grayling show traces of red paint. Paint was found inside two stone vessels from Bonasila (cf. p. 163); paint was also found on an unworked pebble from House 8, Old Fish Camp, and on a pebble from Anvik River. A piece of stone from the kashim at Kateel also has traces of red paint on it. In House 4, Kateel, we found three lumps of red paint, showing rubbed surfaces. Lumps of red paint were found in House 13, New Gray ling (PL XIV, 8) and seven lumps were found at Bonasila. All of this paint, with the exception of the lump from New Grayling, which is dis integrated rhyolite, is red ochre containing a considerable quantity of clay. The natives told us that they were accustomed to obtain red paint by firing lumps of silt. Dr. Dorothy Wyckoff, of the Geology Department at Bryn Mawr College, examined the specimens and said that they could have been produced in this way. The prehistoric Eskimo of Cook Inlet used fragments of baked shale from the north shore of Kachemak Bay as red paint, but we do not know whether these pieces were purposely baked or whether they were taken from deposits that had already been accidentally fired by the burning lignite beds.21 Dall gives us some information about the use of paint. He mentions the fact that the inside of a jacket worn by a Koyukuk Indian was painted with red ochre.22 He also describes the paint used by the Indians in the vicinity of the Tanana mouth, but we are not sure to what extent these statements are applicable to other Indian groups on the Yukon. He writes:23 All of these Indians paint their faces. Black is obtained by rubbing charcoal and fat together. Vermilion is pur chased of the traders, and supplies the place of the red oxide of iron which they formerly used. I saw one who appeared to have used graphite, or plumbago, on his face, but on examining the article itself, it proved to be micaceous oxide of iron, and was said to have been obtained on the banks of the Tananah. Harrington24 reports a bed of coal, 100 miles by water up the Anvik River, or 35 miles in a direct line from the Yukon, which "seems to have been used to a moderate extent by the natives, who formerly employed it in the manufacture of a black pigment." Modern wooden dishes and spoons are stained red with what I take to be a vegetable dye of 21 de Laguna, 1934, p. 117. 22 Dall, 1877, p. 82. 23 Dall, 1870, p. 95. 24 G. I Harrington, 1918, p. 65. some kind. The black paint occasionally found on some of the older specimens, and on the dipper fragment from Kateel, is probably made of charcoal and grease. Fig. 23.?Sandstone Boulder with Human Face, Beach South of Blackburn River Mouth (Fig. 14). Scale i (35-21 386). BIRCH BARK Fragments of stitched birch bark were found at several sites. Many formed the roof of the house, and were found above the beams, but covered with a layer of sods. Others were frag ments of baskets, of the same types as those still made by the Indians (PL II, 4). One frag ment from House 4, Kateel, was identified by Johnny Dayton as the deck piece of a canoe (cf. the canvas canoe, PL IV, 6). Birch bark fragments were found at House 4, Kateel; Houses 8 and 12, Old Fish Camp; at the Spring Camp on the upper Khotol; and at House 6, Yukon Willow Creek. Remains of a birch bark basket filled with what seems to have been fish eggs were found under the floor of "House" 2 at Bonasila but were not saved. A birch bark box with wooden bottom (PL XVI, 3) was found in the modern grave at Anvik Point. It is made differently from any birch bark vessel which we saw in use. The box is oval, measuring 4.5 cm in height, but the diameter could not be determined because the wooden bottom was almost entirely rotted and the specimen was crushed. The side is made of a strip of bark, 18 cm long, joined by folding and hooking together, much as cardboard boxes are made, to produce a zigzag line at the joining. The wooden bottom was fastened in with fine wooden pegs. The side is decorated by an all over pattern of oblique crosshatching, ap parently incised with a steel knife.</page><page sequence="143">136 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 An informant at Nulato told us that the women at Kaltag formerly used a small flat birch bark dish as a lamp. GRASS MATS The skeleton found under the floor of House 12, Old Fish Camp, was wrapped in two grass mats, then in birch bark (PL VII, 1). The skeleton at Anvik Point had also been wrapped in a similar grass mat, a small portion of which still adhered to the skull. All these mats were made by twining, the twisting slanting up from left to right. The outer mat on the Old Fish Camp skeleton was the finer of the two (PL XIX, 1, 2; PL XX, 1). It has approximately two warp strands to the centimeter; the strands of the woof are spaced at intervals of about 4 or 5 cm. The inner mat (PL XIX, 3; PL XX, 2), which lay with the direction of the weave at right angles to that of the first mat, was somewhat coarser, averaging twelve warp strands to 10 cm, and with a distance of about 6 cm between woof strands. No fragments of edging were found. The Anvik Point mat was too small to furnish measurements. Natives at Koyukuk Station told us that they used to make square twined grass mats. The warp element, instead of being simple twisted strands of grass cord, as in the archae ological specimens, was one long three-strand cord, folded back on itself. A twined grass bag with openwork weave was purchased at Anvik (PL XXI, 1). The Indians at Anvik and on the lower In noko still make grass mats, but these are of a different pattern from the specimens just described. They are circular or oval in outline, made by coiling a continuous length of four strand square braid of grass. Ornamental varia tion is produced by sewing in a row of braid on a zig-zag. A mat of this type was also seen at Koyukuk Station. The Indians of the Anvik-Hologochaket area also make coiled baskets, generally rather large, and furnished with tight-fitting lids and leather handles. They also make circular trays. The foundation is a single rod of flexible willow; the stitches are of spruce root, sometimes dyed with store-bought dyes to produce simple patterns. STONE VESSELS Stone vessels seem to have been rare on the Yukon, although fragments of pottery were found at almost every site investigated between Tanana and Holy Cross. Only nine stone vessels were found: one from House 4, Kateel, five from Anvik Point, and three from Bonasila. These are all very crude. The specimen from Kateel is only a rectangu lar piece of tufaceous sandstone with a shallow circular depression pecked in one surface (PL XII, 4). There is no clue as to its use. The specimens from Anvik Point and Bonasila are all of naturally hollow slabs of andesite, probably obtained from the bluffs of Cement Hill, just above Bonasila, or even from the beach at that site where the rocks include boulders of andesite which split into dish shaped pieces. Although many excellent nat urally hollow stones were seen on the beach just above Nulato, we could not discover any evidence that the natives in the vicinity had used them. Two of the five specimens from Anvik Point (PL XXI, 2, 4) and all three from Bonasila had been smoothed inside; two of the latter were smeared with red paint, as if they had served as paint mortars. One of these painted specimens also retained incrustations of carbonized organic matter on the outside. An Indian from Koyukuk Station reported that the Tena had formerly used stone as well as pottery lamps. It is difficult to tell, however, how these crude stone vessels were used. I have already figured and described the lamp with a human figure in the bowl which was formerly supposed to have been found at Kaltag.25 Mr. Muller, the trader at Kaltag who owned this lamp before it went to the Uni versity of Alaska, told me that it had been picked up on a sand bar in the Khotol about half a mile below Old Fish Camp, and that he supposed it had been washed from the village site. At the time of our visit, the water in the Khotol was so high that the sand bar in question was not visible, but we did not find any place where the river had been cutting into the terrace on which the old houses were built. However, it is possible that the lamp might have washed out at an unusually high level of the river, or the river may once have cut closer to the site. It is curious, however, that this lamp, which belongs so clearly to the Third Period of the Kachemak Bay Eskimo culture, should have come from the Khotol River, since we found nothing at the Old Fish Camp except the rather recent and slightly Eskimo-influenced culture of the Tena. Our excavations did not yield any 25 de Laguna, 1934, p. 178, PI. 71.</page><page sequence="144">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 137 clue as to whether or not the lamp had actually come from this village. The same mystery as to provenience surrounds the other lamps with human figure said to have been found on Knik Arm and at Kenai Lake, in the Cook Inlet Tanaina area. The lamp from the Khotol (PL XXI, 3) is of reddish, fine-grained rock, oval, with sloping rim and rounded bottom. There is a lip for the wick and a medial groove on the bottom to direct the oil to it. Outside, just below the rim, is an encircling decorative groove. The squat, 2. Fig. 24.?Realistic Engravings.

TRADED OBJECTS In the course of our explorations we found a number of objects which the natives had ob tained from Russian, Hudson's Bay Company, or American traders. These included various types of beads, an iron ax head, iron knife blades, rings and bracelets, a copper spoon, and dentalium shells. Small, colored glass beads are still used by the Tena for decorating moccasins and mittens and I have named these the "Gla cier Island type" after an island in Prince William Sound, where I found them associated with two Eskimo burials. The larger sky-blue glass beads I have named the "Cook type" be cause the Prince William Sound Eskimo al ready possessed some at the time of Captain Cook's discovery of the Sound. They may have been traded to the Tena prior to actual contact with the Russians, just as they seem to have reached Prince William Sound before the first white men.27 (See PL XXVI, 16.) The provenience of these traded objects is listed below: Old Station: one Cook type bead. Old Lowden: one grave contained three den talium shells, small black and white Glacier Is land type beads, two cylindrical opaque red glass beads, one cylindrical dark blue glass bead, knife or scraper made of strap iron riveted to a decorated wooden handle; an other grave contained small white and black glass beads, one larger white glass bead; from the beach below the graves, one white Glacier Island type bead, one long cylindrical dark blue glass bead, one round red glass bead with a white center. House 4, Kateel: white Glacier Island type beads, small light blue glass beads, small red glass beads with opaque centers, one large bright blue bead, one Cook type bead. Kashim, Kateel: one large amber-colored bead, one large dark blue glass bead, small white Glacier Island type beads, small red beads with opaque centers, one iron finger ring. Terentief's Trading Post, below Koyukuk: one Cook type bead. House 33, Old Fish Camp: one Cook type bead. Paul Esmailka's place: one small white bead. "Inland Bend": one iron ax head. House 6, Yukon Willow Creek: two blue Glacier Island type beads. Burial at Anvik Point: two very large blue beads, one small white bead. Anvik Point: collection purchased from na tives contained a broken copper spoon. Woman's grave, Anvik River: three iron bracelets, small blue and white Glacier Island type beads, one larger round white glass bead, one round dark blue glass bead, one very large blue glass bead, one facetted blue glass bead, 27 Q "The Archaeology of Prince William Sound, Alaska," in preparation with Kaj Birket-Smith.</page><page sequence="146">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 139 antler handle for iron ulo blade (PL XIV, 29). House 7, site opposite Hologochaket: one scrap of iron, one small blue glass bead. Bonasila (old beach level of Terrace 1): one iron ring, one bright blue glass bead. The only traded objects of any particular in terest are the dentalium shells, which must have come originally from Washington or Oregon. They were highly prized by the Indians of the Northwest Coast, the Pacific Eskimo and Aleut, Tanaina of Cook Inlet, Kutchin, and even by the Eskimo as far away as Bering Strait and the mouth of the Mackenzie.28 That these shells were traded to the Tena in very early times is suggested by the role they play in the Koyukuk myth explaining the origin of the three clans found among the Tena on the Yukon above Blackburn, on the Koyukuk and on the Tanana. According to this story, as told us by Andrew Pilot, one of the three groups, represented by a marten-man, acquired the name of "From-out of-the-water people" because the leader had come over a long stretch of water and could prove his claim by exhibiting a string of denta lium shells. The leader of the second group, a black bear-man, acquired the name of "Copper people" for his clan because he had come from underground and had a piece of native copper as proof. The leader of the third group, a cari bou-man, seems simply to have said he came from the north, and his clan were called "Cari bou people" without any exhibition of proof. Dall illustrates a nose ornament made of six dentalium shells and two beads, strung to 28 de Laguna, 1934, p. 113; Osgood, 1936, PL 2; Birket Smith and de Laguna, 1938, p. 395. gether to form a rigid pin which was thrust through a hole in the septum. He reports that at Tanana both men and women wore such or naments, while at Koyukuk they were worn only by men.29 Whymper says that dentalium shell nose ornaments were worn only by the men among the upper Tena (referring to the Koyukuk group?), but that among the lower Tena they were worn by both sexes.30 A woman from Nulato described a bib made of four lines of dentalium shells, alternately strung with beads, which the women used to wear. The or nament was attached to a collar or neckband and reached the middle of the breast, where it was finished off with a tassel of wolverine skin. The women also used to wear ear ornaments of dentalium shell. Jette reports that the Indians wore strings of beads hanging from the nose and ears. Dall describes a jacket of a Koyukuk In dian.31 On the inside it was painted with red ochre, on the outside decorated with strings of beads. The combination trousers and boots were stitched with a pattern of large black and white beads. The jackets of both men and women were ornamented with beads, replacing the earlier porcupine quill work. Strings of beads seven feet long, and valued at two marten skins were used as money by the Yukon In dians. The colors valued were red, black, white, dark blue, and amber. The only colors used on clothing at that time (1867) were black, white, and brick red. 29 Dall, 1877, p. 95. 30 Whymper, 1869, pp. 204 f. ? Dall, 1877, pp. 82 ff.</page><page sequence="147">CHAPTER VH POTTERY FROM INDIAN AND "ESKIMO" SITES INTRODUCTION 1HAVE preferred to describe in one section the pottery from the supposedly Eskimo site at Fox Creek and that from the Indian sites above Holy Cross, since there seems to be no real difference in the shapes or general char acter of the ware. The Eskimo of the lower Yukon and Kuskokwim also make very similar pots and lamps, though there seem to be slight differences in decorative style peculiar to each locality. Apparently all the Tena groups of the middle and lower Yukon Valley made pottery. Rainey reports potsherds from the fields of the Govern ment Agricultural Experiment Station at Ram part, 80 miles above Tanana, and potsherds and deposits of fine clay used for pottery mak ing at Arlan Jordan's camp six miles below Rampart Rapids, or 34 miles above the mouth of the Tanana.1 Indians from the lower Tanana used to come to these clay beds, and clay ves sels were apparently traded as far up the Tanana as the Delta River, some 425 miles above the mouth of the Tanana. Pottery was not made, however, on the upper Tanana or on the upper Copper River. Our own informants told us of pottery 100 miles (by water) up the Nowitna and on the Innoko about 80 miles above Hologochaket. We found sherds at al most every site investigated from Tanana Mis sion and Kateel down to Fox Creek below Holy Cross. As far as we were able to learn, there were the following sources of clay: (1) At Jordan's camp near Rampart Rapids, about 34 miles above the mouth of the Tanana, used by the lower Tanana natives, according to Rainey, and by the Yukon Indians as far down as Kalland, according to our informants; (2) near Lowden, used by local Indians and people from the vicinity of Koyukuk Station. This deposit was not located; (3) near the mouth of the Koyukuk and on the Yukon near Koyukuk Station. We located the first of these, but not the second deposit. Used by local na tives and others; (4) nine miles below Nulato, used by local Indians and by people from Koyukuk Station. A sample of the clay was 1 Rainey, 1939, pp. 376 f., 380. obtained for study; (5) at Hall's Rapids, used by local natives and by Indians as far south as Holy Cross; and (6) on the Yukon, J mile below Anvik.2 There were probably many other spots were clay was obtained. The clay itself is that which Eardley has described as the Koyukuk-Anvik Blue Loam.8 It exhibits the plasticity of clay, but should more correctly be termed a loam. Beds of this loam were found at various places along the river from Lowden and Kateel, or possibly higher, and they probably extend down to Andreafsky, or well into Eskimo ter ritory. On the Koyukuk near Kateel some yel lowish beds of sand are mixed with the loam. Tena pottery has been mentioned by several of the earlier writers, but until recently has never been described in detail. Thus Dall writes:4 I saw quite a number of clay pots and cups of native manufacture here [Anvik]. They were mostly large, holding three or four gallons, but some were smaller, and one was evidently modelled after a Russian mug. The common Innuit lamp is also made of clay, and all their pottery is rudely ornamented with lines, dots, and crosses. They are about three quarters of an inch thick, of a dark bluish clay, and were perfectly black from smoke and grease. . . . This kind of pottery was formerly universal, but has been super seded by the kettles of the traders. The pots are made by hand, and therefore not perfectly round or symmetrical. They are dried in the sun, then baked, and will stand the fire very well. Jacobsen5 purchased some pottery at the same village and remarks: A great deal of pottery is manufactured by the Ingalik. Most of the earthenware which they make serves as cook ing vessels or oil lamps. The pots are often quite large and attain half the size of a herring barrel. The gray-colored ware is worked without the use of the potter's wheel, partly with the hands, partly with the help of a stone or bone. Just before they are completed, the vessels are ornamented with small pits, poked into the inside and outside of the walls. In the Eleventh Census* we find the statement that certain groups living on Shageluk Slough manufacture a certain kind of clay pot, which in the spring and autumn is brought down in quantities to the coast to 2 Osgood, 1940, p. 146. 3 Eardley, 1938 a, pp. 325 f. 4 Dall, 1870, pp. 218 f. 6 Jacobsen, 1884, pp. 200 f., my translation. 6 Porter, 1893, p. 119. 140</page><page sequence="148">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 141 exchange for seal and beluga (white whale) oil, which forms part of their food supply, constituting one of the distinctive features between them and the upper river Indians, who abhor oil in any shape as an article of food. Chief Mathew, Rainey's informant who showed him the clay deposits at Jordan's, told him that the clay was mixed with chopped bear's hair, moulded by hand into large semi-spherical vessels, and baked in an open fire.7 The sherds which Rainey found at Jordan's camp are described as poorly fired, dark gray pottery, tempered with coarse bits of quartz and schist, but Rainey does not mention any trace of hair.8 We questioned a number of natives about the manufacture of pottery but received rather unsatisfactory and conflicting accounts. According to Chief Luke, of Tanana Mis sion, the clay was obtained from the deposits near Jordan's camp. It was dug up and stirred. Chopped bear hair and sand were added, and the mixture was modeled with the hands. The pot was first dried in the sun, then baked be side a fire. It was not decorated. Pots had to be set beside the fire when used for cooking, because they lacked means of suspension. Joe Nicolai, of Tanana Mission, told us that clay was obtained from the vicinity of Jor dan's camp. It already contained sand, so only feathers of salt water ducks were added. (Sea gulls and other aquatic birds, usually found by salt water, are numerous on the Yukon.) We were told by Mrs. Annie Albers, of Kal land, that clay was obtained from Jordan's. Eiderdown was added. She did not mention sand. The pot was modeled by hand, but the first portion to be shaped had to be allowed to dry before more clay could be added to com plete the vessel. The pot was dried beside the fire, being turned at frequent intervals. Mrs. Dago Kid Brown, of Ruby, said that hell-diver feathers were mixed with the clay. The pot was modeled without an inside form or mold (mentioned by Andrew Pilot). Water was put into the pot while it was drying (!). A man from the vicinity of Lowden claimed that local clay mixed with blood was used for pottery. Indians at Koyukuk Station told us that pots were made from white clay obtained near Lowden. 7 Rainey, 1939, pp. 376 f. 8 Op. tit., p. 377. The statement of Andrew Pilot, of Koyukuk Station, as interpreted by Ella Vernetti was: Natives came here to the mouth of the Koyukuk to get clay. They came from the Tanana River, the upper Yukon, the lower Yukon, and the Koyukuk. They camped on the flat at Tokchakat, hundreds of them?thick as mosquitoes. They would get a gob of clay and mix it with hell-diver feathers and a little whale or seal oil. The oil came from the coast over the Unalaklit portage, or over the trail from Kotzebue Sound to the head of the Kateel River. They made a mold of birch bark and laid it upside down, then spread the clay mixture over it, and patted it down. Then they left it in the sun for five days and it turned as hard as stone. He added that these pots were easily broken and so were always carried in cases of skin. When used for cooking they were placed on the ground in the middle of the fire, and coals were heaped around them. They were always greased on the inside after being used. We found no evidence, such as a print on the inside of a pot, that a bark form was used, and no other native mentioned it. Andrew Pilot came originally from Dolby, on the Koyukuk, and so may have been telling us about a local method of manufacture, not even used as far down as Kateel. No other native mentioned the use of a skin bag for carrying pots. A woman from Nulato told us that clay was obtained from the Koyukuk River or from the bank nine miles below Nulato. It was a shiny blue clay and was cut out of the bank with adzes. Chopped hell-diver feathers were added, but no sand. Any kind of oil or fish oil was mixed with it, and the mass was kneaded like dough. The pot was shaped by hand from one big lump. It was left by the fire all day to dry. At frequent intervals, grease was rubbed on, and it was turned around. No water was put into it, only grease. It had to be re-greased every time it had been used for cooking. When in use it was set on the ground, and a hollow was dug under it for the fire. According to a native of Anvik, the clay was mixed with blood from the nose. Certainly the amount of blood thus obtained was negligible, but it might have been considered magically potent. Our informant might have been con fused as to the source of blood, or he may just have been telling a good story. Natives at Ghost Creek said that yellow, brown, or white clay (bentonite ?) was obtained at Hall's Rapids. It was tempered with ground up coal and was decorated with ivory or bone insets. Our informant has probably confused</page><page sequence="149">142 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 the insets on wooden dishes with the instrument used for incising pottery. Osgood's account of Ingalik pottery making is quite detailed and I quote from it at length:9 When a woman wants to make some clay pots she goes to a place where there is a natural deposit of suitable clay, called literally pot dirt in Ingalik (there is such a place on the Yukon about one-quarter mile below Anvik). The clay is dug out with a little wooden shovel and put into an old birch bark basket. Probably two such baskets are filled up and brought home. There the clay is stirred up a little and the larger pieces of rock taken out. A little water is mixed in with the clay in order to soften it. Then some ptarmigan feathers are cut into fine pieces and mixed into the clay so well that they can hardly be seen. A piece of plank about 1J feet long and 1 foot wide is placed on the ground. Some of the clay is put out on this plank and flattened down to make the bottom of the pot. The woman feels it with her fingers to see if it is thick enough. The bottoms of the pots are always made thick. Then the walls are added by stick ing on pieces about 2 inches high and 3 inches long of the desired thickness. These are squeezed together at the joints. When the wall of the pot is half finished, one hand is put against the wall and the outside slapped with a little wooden paddle. A sliding blow is given with the paddle which stretches the clay upward. After this has been done all around, the upper part of the top is finished and slapped around in turn until it is just the right thickness. When the pot has been shaped it is moved on its plank about 3 or 4 feet from the fire and allowed to dry slowly. This takes about two days, the pot being turned from time to time and tested by tapping with a little stick in order to deter mine its condition of dryness by the sound. When the wall of the pot is dry, it is tipped over so that the bottom also dries. After this, a little fire is made inside with shavings to burn off the edges of the feathers which roughen the surface of the pot. When the pot cools again, water is put inside and the pot placed beside the fire. To the water some backbones of fish are added and cooked all day long. This is done in order to give the pot a permanent fishy taste which is very much desired. Finally the water is taken out and the pot wiped and put away. It takes about three days to make a pot including the first boiling of fish in it. . . . Pots vary somewhat in size and in shape. There are about four sizes of pots, ranging up to about 1 foot in diameter and 1 foot in depth. A typical shape is indicated by the illustration. [A rather squat situla, with a row of dots around it just below the rim, and another around the neck at the edge of the shoulder.] Every married woman has three or four pots. They are almost always decorated near the rim with incised lines (generally two) and with rows of dots below made with a bear's tooth before the clay dries. . . . The pots are always put beside the fire, never on it. When cooking with pots, one must be careful when putting wood on the fire to avoid breaking them. . . . Pots are used only for cooking. Water is never kept in them as it is believed that this would soften the clay. When carried from one village to another, pots are packed with grass in a birch bark basket. Lamps are made in the same way as pots. "A lamp requires about two days to make, in 9 Osgood, 1940, pp. 146-149. eluding the drying and firing." All lamps, ex cept the small one used for the Animal's Cere mony, have incised decorations inside, and per haps outside also. They are all round in shape, but the diameters vary. Two large lamps, 10 to 12 inches in diameter, are used in the kashim, set on high stands on each side of the fire pit. Each married woman has one to three lamps, about 6 inches in diameter, but uses only one at a time. If there are several wives in a family, each has her own lamp burning. A girl may have a smaller lamp of her own. White fish or seal oil is used. The wick of moss (Polytrichum strictum) is laid up against one side of the lamp, and is adjusted with a couple of fish bones. Lamps are used only for light, never for cooking or for heating. POTTERY SMOOTHERS Three small round pebbles were found; these the natives identified as stones for smoothing the inside of pots. They vary in diameter from 3.5 to 5 cm and come from the kashim at Kateel; House 8, Old Fish Camp; and Anvik Point (PL XVI, 18). The lower edge has been ground smooth on two potsherds which were found, one at Bona sila, the second at Anvik Point (PL XXIV, 3 and Fig. 27,4). They have evidently been used as scrapers of some kind, probably for smooth ing the outside of clay vessels. COOKING POTS The pottery vessels used for cooking vary in diameter from about 20 cm to 38 cm. There are also a few smaller specimens, only 12 or 14 cm in diameter, which were probably toys, and one very large pot from Anvik River, which seems to have had a diameter of 60 cm. The widest part of the pot is at the rim and at the shoulder; the smallest diameter is at the bottom. The shape of the rim varies. It may be flat, rounded, or bulging. It may be plain or deco rated with a groove. If flat, it may be level or slope outwards, in a few cases, inwards. The vessel may narrow evenly from the rim to the base, but in most cases it is constricted slightly to form a neck, one quarter or one third of the distance from rim to base (i.e., from 2.5 to 10 cm below the rim). It then turns out rather abruptly to form the shoulder, and from there slopes evenly again towards the bottom. The characteristic shape of these pots may be compared to that of a bucket or situla.</page><page sequence="150">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 143 With one known exception (PL XXII, 5), the bottoms of the pots seem to have been flat (PL XXIII, 2, 3). In addition to these com plete specimens from Kateel and from New Grayling, there are examples represented by sherds from House 12, Old Fish Camp, and from Anvik Point, Anvik River, and Bonasila. All of these sherds are from the walls of vessels, just where the flat bottom is attached; there are no sherds which can be identified as part of the bottom itself. The weak parts of the pot are at the thinning of the neck and at the junc tion of the bottom with the side. The walls may vary from 0.5 to 2.5 cm in thickness, usually de pending upon the size of the vessel, although this relationship is not constant. The thinnest part of the vessel is generally at or near the neck. The bottom, especially where it joins the side, tends to be thicker than the side. The sec tion illustrated in Figure 26, 12 is a typical of the profile at the base of the pot, except that the bottom is usually much thicker than the side. The bottoms have dropped out of many pots. This is because, as Osgood's description shows, the bottom is made first, and the walls are added to it. Just why we have not found these bottoms is hard to explain, unless they were thrown out on rubbish heaps which we did not explore, while the bottomless pot, which was probably still useful for something, was kept inside the house. Because, as Osgood reports, the pots were made by patch-modeling, they tend to break into sherds representing the original pieces of clay. These sherds are usually rectangular, sometimes triangular, with one or two edges parallel to the rim. The patching technique is also shown by irregularities in the thickness of the vessel wall. Marks on the inner surfaces of some sherds seem to have been caused by the pressure of some firm body against which the clay has been squeezed by paddling. It is pos sible that the pebbles identified as pottery "smoothers" for the inside of vessels were actu ally anvils, not rubbing stones. According to Osgood's description, the hand was used as an anvil. No marks of the paddle itself remain on the outer surface of the sherds because the out side of the pot seems to have been somewhat smoothed by rubbing, perhaps with the fin gers, to judge by faint prints and smears, or with a wad of grass or with a scraper. The faint scratches run horizontally in most cases, show ing that the pot was rubbed round and round after it had been shaped. This rubbing and smoothing tended to push in the rather coarse tempering material, so that the surface of the pot gives the impression of finer ware than is actually the case. Since Mr. Donald Horton, formerly attached to the University of Pennsyl vania Museum, has subjected these sherds to a careful petrographic analysis, as set forth in the Appendix, it is only necessary to mention here that the tempering consists of coarse sand and feathers. No slip was used, although a "false slip" was sometimes produced by wetting the fingers or scraping tool used in smoothing off the pot. Sherds often break by exfoliation, usually losing the outer surface. Sometimes the ridges on the inside, if made of separately applied rolls of clay, tend to break off. Pots show consider able variation in firing. Within the vessel wall there may be sharply defined zones of complete or partial carbonization. The surface of the ves sels also shows rather marked differences in color due to uneven firing, ranging from gray, tan, or reddish brown to black. On the large pots from New Grayling (PL XXIII, 1, 3), the rims have split at several places and the surfaces of many sherds from other pots have a crackled appearance as a result of imperfect firing. A few sherds from Anvik Point (PL XXIV, 19) show marked discoloration in lines, as if the pot had been painted with vertical bands of black and brown pigment. We have not been able to fit these into any pattern, however, and it is probable that the discoloration is simply due to the boiling over of the contents of the vessel. The insides of most sherds are incrusted with organic material, usually obscur ing the decorative grooves and ridges which commonly encircle the inside of the mouth. This incrustation may be as much as a quarter of an inch thick. Undecorated pots were made at most of the sites. While only one decorated sherd was found above Nulato (at Kateel), rim sherds obtained from sites below Nulato indicate that most of the vessels, especially below Blackburn, were decorated. Undecorated pots were found at Adam's place near Tanana Mission (PL XXII, 5, 6), in the kashim at Kateel (PL XXIII, 2), and at House 13, New Grayling (PL XXIII, /). Undecorated rim sherds were also found at Houses 8 and 12 of the Old Fish Camp, Black burn Slough, Anvik Point, and Bonasila. These pots had plain rims, rounded on top (Fig. 26, 3, 4, 7, 13) or flattened (Fig. 26, 8, 14-16) in</page><page sequence="151">144 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 a few cases bulging to the inside or the outside (Fig. 26, 5, 6,15). Three rim sherds from Bona sila are undecorated on the outside but show respectively a groove on the top of the bulging rim, a ridge around the inside just below the rim, and a line around the inside?features usually found on pots with exterior decoration (Fig. 26, 9, 10, 11). mm n \\nu&gt; ' 8 9 11 \ y \ i ? 15 Fig. 26.?Profiles of Undecorated Cooking Pots.

The larger of the two (PL XXII, 5, Fig. 26, 1) has a di ameter of 20 cm and originally stood 23 cm high. It is the only pot in the collection with a rounded bottom. The rim is flat, sloping out ward. The vessel narrows rather abruptly to a neck about 3 cm below the rim, then gradually expands in a fairly even curve. The second pot (PL XXII, 6, Fig. 26, 2) is 15 cm in diameter and was over 13 cm high. It has almost straight sides, sloping evenly from the flat level rim towards the bottom. The bottom is missing, but I have reconstructed the pot as if it had been flat. Only a slight thinning of the wall about 3 cm from the rim and a corresponding thickening 9 cm from the rim suggests the neck and shoulders common on the typical situla shaped pots from farther down the Yukon Val ley. This blurring of the pattern is what we might expect to find near the limit of distribu tion of a culture trait. The undecorated pot from the Kateel kashim (PL XXIII, 2) stands 27 cm high, with a di ameter of 22 cm at the rim and of 17 cm at the flat bottom. The pot is, however, not quite circular. The neck and shoulders are only faintly indicated. The rim is plain and flat. The pot from above the roof of House 13, New Grayling (PL XXIII, 1) is 36 cm in diameter at the plain flat rim, and probably stood 35-38 cm high, although the bottom is missing. There is a neck about 7 cm below the rim. As previously mentioned, the rim sherds found in lower Tena territory and at the two "Eskimo" sites prove that most of the pots in this area were decorated. The decoration con sists of shallowly incised or trailed lines en circling the rim, generally with a row of dots below them. The same motif is usually repeated at the bulge of the shoulder. The lower part of the vessel is undecorated. The lines vary con siderably in width and in neatness of execution. The dots were apparently made by pressing a bluntly pointed stick into the wet clay, and may be round, oval, or angular, depending on the shape of the stick and the angle at which it was applied. In one case, the depressions are double, showing that a split stick was used (Fig. 31, 7). In a few cases, the oval dots are oblique (Fig. 28, 5, 6,10; Fig. 29, 4; Fig. 31,1), but in general their longer axis is vertical. In some cases they are so fine as to be little more than pin pricks (Fig. 28, 8). In other cases, the dots are elongated impressions like short lines or spurs (Fig. 31, 2; PL XXIV, 18). Dots gen erally occur in horizontal rows just below a line, but we may also find them in groups of two (Fig. 29, 1, 3; Fig. 30, 7; Fig. 31, 4, 10), of three (Fig. 28, 6; Fig. 29, 2, 6; Fig. 31, 1, 2;</page><page sequence="152">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 145 PL XXIV, 1), of four (Fig. 30, 2; PL XXIV, 14), and also in irregular groupings (Fig. 28, 2; PL XXIV, 2). Dots have also been found in a row alone (Fig. 28, 9), or in a row above a line (Fig. 28, 6, 10; Fig. 31, 6). They are sometimes arranged also in a double line. The inside of the pots was often decorated also. In general, the more elaborate the outside decoration the more elaborate the arrangement inside. On some pots, the interior design con sists simply of encircling lines (Fig. 31, 1; and PL XXIV, 1). These, however, rarely extend as far down as the neck. On some specimens, the lines are deepened and widened and the spaces between them are built up to produce a series of encircling grooves and ridges (Fig. 27, 4). On others, a single ridge is built up, as if to support a lid (Fig. 27, 2,3; PL XXIV, 8, 13; etc.). However, we found no fragments of lids, and a number of pots have a whole series of such ridges (Fig. 28, 2,9; PL XXIV, 4,11; etc.). Some of these ridges have been produced by ap plying separate coils of clay to the interior of the pot; in other cases they seem to have been made only by modeling. In only one case do we find a combination of lines and dots on the interior like those outside (Fig. 30,1). The rims on the decorated pots are the same as we have noted for the undecorated vessels, except that there are more with grooved rims. One specimen has a deep groove, interrupted by a small knob (PL XXIV, 2). Since almost half of the rim of this pot was recovered and there was only one knob found, we conclude that when complete the pot could not have had more than two. This treatment of the rim is somewhat similar to that of a small pottery lamp (Fig. 32, 3, and PL XXII, 3). These knobs are purely ornamental; they are not pierced for suspension as are the lugs on mod ern pottery cooking vessels from St. Lawrence Island and northeastern Siberia. Occasionally the outline at the rim is definitely undulating, suggesting faint scallops (PL XXIV, 1). A few sherds show combinations of horizontal and vertical lines. On one, the vertical lines which run from the rim towards the shoulder are in groups of four (Fig. 28, 1), in another case they are probably in pairs with a line of dots between them (Fig. 28, 7), in two other cases, they are evenly spaced (Fig. 28, 3, 4). Another sherd is too small to show the arrange ment clearly (Fig. 30, 5). Only two sherds show oblique lines. Both are from the shoulders of pots. In both cases the oblique lines, in pairs, with a row of dots be tween them, converge to form a V at the shoulder (Fig. 28, 5, 6). The first sherd is too small for us to be sure of the orientation. All the remaining vessels are decorated only with horizontal lines and dots. They may be classified according to the arrangement of the decoration at the rim.

Some pots (Fig. 27) seem to have been deco rated only with lines, although we cannot be sure that there were no dots on the lower part which is now missing, especially since some sherds (Fig. 31, 8, 9) have seven or more lines with a row of dots below them. The sherds which exhibit only lines may have these evenly spaced from rim to shoulder (Fig. 27, 1, 6), or the lines may be in bands around the mouth,</page><page sequence="153">146 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 repeated again at the shoulder (Fig. 27, 7, probably also 3, 5).

This very simple motif may be repeated at the shoulder, or at the shoulder and half way between the shoulder and the rim, or there may be only a line at the shoulder. A larger group of vessels is decorated with combinations of two lines and dots at the rim (Fig. 29; PL XXIV, 2, 5). The treatment of the shoulder varies considerably: there may be a single line, two lines and a row of dots, lines with groups of dots, etc., and dots may also be found in groups between the rim and the shoulder. Only two specimens in this group have a plain rim and interior (Fig. 29, 2); on all the others, the profile of the rim and of the inside is elaborated with grooves and ridges.

Fortunately, one pot with this class of deco ration could be completely restored. It was found on the roof of House 13, New Grayling (PL XXIII, 3). It is 35 cm in diameter at the mouth, 21.7 cm in diameter at the base, stands 3.9 cm high, and has walls about 2 cm thick. The rim decoration of two lines with a row of dots below is repeated at the neck. The flat rim is grooved on top, and there are three rather unevenly drawn lines about the interior. Another large group of pots has three lines</page><page sequence="154">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 147 and dots at the rim (Fig. 30; PL XXIV, 14, 18). The dots at the rim may be in a single or double row, or in groups of two or four, etc. The sherds are unfortunately too small for us to be sure whether the same motif was repeated at the shoulder, although in one case (Fig. 30, 2 and PL XXIV, 14) it occurs again around the neck.

The rim is faintly</page><page sequence="155">148 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 scalloped. The vessel is unusual in having a second constriction about 15 cm below the rim, as well as the more pronounced neck.

In addition to the complete lamps and re storable pots, and to the rim sherds of pots, the collection also contains sherds from the bodies of vessels which lack decoration. These come from all the sites mentioned above as well as from Mr. Miiller's garden at Kaltag and from the beach at Lower Kaltag and from a house pit at Mr. Holiday's old place at Hall's Rapids. POTTERY LAMPS The collection contains three complete pot tery lamps and eight fragments. With one ex ception, which is oval in outline, these lamps are all small round saucer-shaped dishes, vary ing in diameter from about 10.3 cm to 22 cm. The bottoms are gently rounded and the walls of these shallow bowls rise in height from 3.5 to about 5 cm. The walls are about 1.2 cm thick, with the exception of one which is 2 cm thick. The ware is the same as that of the cooking pots and exhibits the same variations in texture, degree of firing, etc. All but two of the lamps have a simple incised decoration quite comparable to that on the pots, usually applied to the inside of the bowls. Two undecorated lamps were found. One, broken in two, is from the grave in Evan's garden at Anvik Point. The flat rim slopes sharply outward (PL XXII, 4; Fig. 32, 1). Half of a second lamp from the site opposite Hologochaket seems to have been oval, rather than circular, and has a small knob on the rim</page><page sequence="156">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 149 at the end which was recovered (PL XXII, 3; Fig. 32, 3). The lamp when complete was prob ably 13 cm long and 8.5 cm wide, and may have had another knob at the other end. A complete lamp from Shageluk on the In noko has a groove on the rim and two encircling lines inside (PL XXII, 1; Fig. 32, 4). A frag ment from Bonasila with a grooved rim and a fragment from Anvik Point with a plain rim (Fig. 33, 1) have three encircling lines inside. A fragment from Fox Creek has two grooves on the rim and six concentric lines around the inside of the bowl (Fig. 32, 2). A complete lamp from the site opposite Hologochaket has a rounded rim and is deco rated on the inside with three encircling lines and a row of dots (PL XXII, 2; Fig. 32, 5). A lamp from Bonasila has three grooves on the rim, six deeply incised lines and a row of dots on the interior (Fig. 33, 4). Another specimen from Bonasila has a grooved rim and an en circling decoration on the inside consisting of four lines, a row of dots, and two lines (Fig. 33, 3). Two fragments of lamps from the beach at Bonasila have what appears to have been the same decoration (Fig. 33, 2, 5). The smaller has two lines on the rim; the rim of the second is broken. In the interior of each there are five concentric lines, and a series (?) of paired spoke like lines, radiating out from the center. The larger lamp had an encircling line around the bottom of the bowl at the base of the spokes. A similar spoked-wheel pattern can be seen on * 5 Fig. 33.?Pottery Lamps.

For this reason, it is here de scribed in a separate chapter. This material consists of three small collections: the largest is from Fox Creek, about 14 miles below Holy Cross, and was collected both by Mr. Fox and by ourselves; the second is from Ghost Creek about a mile and a half above Holy Cross and was collected by the trader there; the third was collected by Mr. Charles Ray, and is said to have come from Fox Creek. It was purchased from the trader at Ghost Creek in Mr. Ray's absence; because of the slight uncertainty about the provenience of these specimens they will be indicated by an "R" in references to the plates. SPLITTING ADZES There are two splitting adzes of basalt, both from Fox Creek. Both are single-bladed, but the butt of one has been damaged (PL XXV, 22, R); both have a long, low projection on the top, separating the two grooves for the lashing. The undamaged specimen (PL XXV, 25) is 21 cm. long, and is larger in every way than the first. They may be compared to an adz head from the middle Yukon, an illustration of which was published by Hrdlicka.1 PLANING ADZ BLADES Of fifteen blades, eleven were probably for adzes and four, for either small adzes or scrapers. One specimen is from Ghost Creek (PL XXV, 13); the rest are from Fox Creek. They are made of basalt, green chert, hornfels, silicified sandy slate, and recrystallized and silicified sandstone. These blades are roughly rectangular in shape, with a somewhat rounded cutting edge, which tends to be wider than the butt. The complete specimens vary in length from 5.7 to 13.3 cm; and in width, from 2.6 to 7 cm. Five were clearly shaped by sawing; two were chipped out. Although the greater 1 Hrdli6ka, 1930 ?, PL 10, specimen on right. part of the specimen is usually roughly finished, the cutting edge generally shows a good polish. With two exceptions, the blades are flat. One of these has a high facetted back (PL XXV, 23, R) like the specimen from Hologochaket (PL XI, 5); the other is a fragment of an adz or scraper blade with slight facets. The specimens illustrated are an adz blade from Ghost Creek (PL XXV, 13), adz blades from Fox Creek (PL XXV, 16-19, 21, 24, 23, R), and small blades for adzes or scrapers from Fox Creek (PL XXV, 10, 11, 14). ANTLER ADZ HAFT From Fox Creek there is a broken adz head or haft of antler (PL XXV, 9). The fore end, where the blade was attached, is, unfortunately, missing, but there remain a pair of slightly de fined shoulders. The haft is furnished with two pairs of drilled holes and a pair of notches to hold the lashings which bound it to the handle. Each pair of holes is connected on the upper surface by a groove. WHETSTONES There are five whetstones from Fox Creek. Four are slabs of silicified sandstone, one is of slate, and all are ground on only one surface. They range in size from 6 by 5.6 cm to 12 by 3.8 cm. One was collected by Mr. Ray. STONE SAW There is a single broken saw from Fox Creek (PL XXV, 75). It is a thin slab of recrystallized and silicified sandstone, smoothed on both sur faces, and it bears traces of red paint. It is 7 cm long, and has two chipped edges and one convexly curved cutting edge. In addition, the edges of an adz blade of re crystallized and silicified sandstone from Fox Creek show wear as if it had been used as a saw (PL XXV, 18). CHIPPED STONE While there are no finished chipped stone implements, there are four pieces of chipped stone from Fox Creek. One chert chip was probably used as a scraper (PL XXV, 12). A second fragment of chert, collected by Mr. Ray, seems to have been part of a blade. A 150</page><page sequence="158">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 151 chipped fragment of silicified sandy slate, sawed along one edge, may have been used as a knife (PL XXV, 20). The last specimen (PL XIV, 6) is a slender flake of hornfels, already mentioned in Chapter VI, page 124, in discuss ing a similar flake from Bonasila. ULO BLADES Ten ulo blades of silicified slate or hornfels were found at Fox Creek. They vary in length from 6 to 9.9 cm, and in width, from 2.5 to 6.5 cm. With two exceptions (PL XXVI, 47, 49), they are longer at the back, and shorter at the cutting edge. The first of these also differs from the rest by having a straight edge. Two fragmentary blades have only slightly curved cutting edges (PL XXVI, 48). Another speci men has a curved but asymmetric cutting edge, suggesting that it may be for a man's large single-edged knife, rather than for a woman's ulo (PL XXVI, 37). The remaining five speci mens have straight backs and symmetrically curved edges (PL XXVI, 42-46). DOUBLE-EDGED SLATE BLADES From Fox Creek, we have five doubled-edged blades and one fragment, of silicified slate or hornfels, which were probably all intended for weapons. One of the specimens (PL XXVI, 36) is a facetted leaf-shaped blade with a broad tang set off by rounded shoulders. It is 8.4 cm long and 3.7 cm wide, and was probably for a lance or large flensing knife. The tang of a similar blade was collected by Mr. Ray. Four blades, three for arrows and one for an arrow or lance, are roughly triangular. Three are deeply grooved on both sides, from the base nearly to the point; the remaining blade is unfinished and lacks the grooves. The largest specimen, which may have been for a lance, (PL XXVI, 41, R), measures 8.2X2.4 cm, and the corners of its deeply indented base form a pair of spurs. The three smaller blades vary in length from 4.6 to 5.4 and in width from 2.1 to 2.8 cm. One of these (PL XXVI, 38) and the unfinished specimen (PL XXVI, 40) have only slightly indented bases; the last (PL XXVI, 39) has a deeply indented base and a pair of spurs. AWLS Two roughly shaped awls from Fox Creek, 8.8 and 11.2 cm long, are made from splinters of bone (PL XXVI, 13, 14). From the same site there is a well shaped bone implement which may be either an awl or a drill point (PL XXVI, 20, R). It is 5.4 cm long and has an enlarged rectangular butt and a conical point. BONE SCRAPERS Unfortunately, we have no good examples of bone scrapers to compare with those found farther up the river. The only complete speci men is one from Fox Creek (PL XXV, 2), of obviously fresh bone. It is a slab split from a long bone and ground fairly smooth, with a transverse edge at the narrower end and a hole near the butt for suspension or for attach ment to a handle. It is 14.2 cm long. An older specimen from the same site seems to be a combination scraper and boot sole creaser. It is made of a split leg bone of an animal and has been sharpened across one end and along one edge (PL XXVI, 15). Mr. Ray found a fragment of what may have been a similar implement. HARPOON HEAD A broken antler harpoon head from Fox Creek (PL XXVI, 1) has two opposed lateral spurs, a closed conical socket between them which has not been completely drilled, and in place of the customary hole it seems to have a groove to hold the harpoon line. The point is missing. ICE PICKS From Fox Creek there is a massive antler implement which seems to have been the ice pick for a harpoon (PL XXV, 1). The surfaces are facetted, the point is slightly oblique, and the butt has a very small, thin, asymmetrically placed tang for attachment to a shaft or handle. From the same site there is also an antler specimen which was probably the point of an ice pick or wedge (PL XXV, 3). It is flat on one side, rounded on the other. The butt has been sawed off. DETACHABLE BARBED HEADS There are four detachable barbed heads of antler, one from Ghost Creek, the rest from Fox Creek, and two fragments from the second site which may have been parts of similar specimens. The complete heads vary in length from 11 to 15 cm and are about 1.5 cm wide. Three of the complete heads are barbed only on one edge. The specimen from Ghost Creek</page><page sequence="159">152 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 has a single barb, and a ridgelike shoulder above the small wedge-shaped butt. The gouged line hole is symmetrically placed, and the edges on each side of it are slightly notched (PL XXVI, 7). One specimen from Fox Creek has four barbs. The edges of the three lower barbs are outlined by an incised zigzag line (PL XXVI, 8). The head has a small detached coni cal tang with a notch above it, like the tangs on the arrowheads from this site, and it also has a symmetrically placed line hole just above the tang. An unfinished head from Fox Creek has two barbs, a wedge-shaped tang, and a small drilled pit at the base of the upper barb, indicating how this was to be cut out (PL XXVI, 5). The fourth complete head from this site has three barbs on one edge and another on the opposite edge near the point (PL XXVI, 6, R). There is a small flat tang, set off by shoulders, with a central line hole above it, flanked by slight notches as on the Ghost Creek specimen. Two fragments may be from detachable heads, although the absence of the butts pre vents certain identification. The first is part of a very heavy specimen with one large barb, shown point down in the illustration (PL XXV, 7). The second, also from Fox Creek, has a pair of barbs. It may be part of an arrow head (PL XXVI, 2, R). ANTLER ARROWHEADS WITH BLADE SLIT Two antler arrowheads with slits to hold stone blades were found at Fox Creek. One of these is a cylindrical rod, 6.7 cm long, the butt end cut off squarely, and the point slit to hold a thin stone blade (PL XXVI, 10). Probably the blade was a grooved slate triangular blade, like those found at the site (see PL XXVI, 38, 39). The arrowhead closely resembles some of the specimens found in Kachemak Bay.2 The second arrowhead is 15 cm long and was evidently intended to hold a much larger blade (PL XXVI, P, R). It has a small, detached conical tang, with a notch on the shaft above the tang, probably to facilitate hafting. On the same edge as the notch there are two small ineffectual barbs. On each surface there is a medial line running down from the base of the blade-slit to the tang, and on one side there is an incised hook-shaped figure, probably the mark of the owner. 2 de Laguna, 1934, PL 41, 16, 17. BARBED BONE AND ANTLER ARROWHEADS In addition to the specimen with blade slit already described, there are seven arrowheads with barbs. These lacked blades. Two are from Ghost Creek, the rest from Fox Creek. The complete specimens range in length from 12.6 to 22.8 cm and have from two to four barbs on one edge. A broken specimen was evidently still larger, and another fragment has twelve barbs. These arrowheads fall into two types. The first type is represented by two speci mens. The main portion of the head is flat tened, with two small barbs set off by longitudi nal lines, and there is a slender detached conical tang. On the specimen from Ghost Creek, the barbs are close to the tang and there is an en circling line between the lowest barb and the tang (PL XXVI, 3). On the specimen from Fox Creek, the barbs are placed near the middle of the head and there is a hook-shaped owner's mark on one side just above the tang (PL XXVI, 4). The five remaining specimens are slender barbed points. A bone specimen from Ghost Creek (PL XXVI, 23) and an antler point from Fox Creek (PL XXVI, 26) each have three barbs on one edge, set off by a pair of longitudi nal lines. The first has a pair of notches on the pointed tang. The second has two oblique orna mental cuts and a single notch above the de tached conical tang. A larger antler point from Fox Creek lacks the bordering lines, but has four barbs and a large notch above the pointed tang (PL XXVI, 22). Two broken specimens, both from Fox Creek, are, curiously enough, of walrus ivory. One is the butt end of what was probably the largest specimen of all. It has a pointed tang with a notch above it and a pair of longitudinal lines that evidently outlined the barbs on the missing portion (PL XXVI, 25). The second fragment is the point of a very similar specimen (PL XXVI, 24). It has twelve very small barbs on one side?there were prob ably more on the complete point?and it re sembles the Yukon Island III type, except that it lacks longitudinal lines. BARBED PRONGS FOR LEISTER There are five slender barbed points from Fox Creek, all probably for a leister or multi pointed dart. They vary in length from 11 to almost 17 cm. One of these is straight, so that identification is not quite certain; the rest are curved. The straight specimen has four</page><page sequence="160">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 153 larger barbs near the point, and 10 very small barbs or notches below (PL XXVI, 27). There is a longitudinal line on each side. One point has eight small barbs on the outer, convexly curved edge (PL XXVI, 29); the remaining three specimens are barbed on the inner, con cave edge. Two of these have five small barbs (PL XXVI, 30, and 31, R); the last has three barbs, slightly more detached than those on the others (PL XXVI, 28, R). NETS Half of an antler netting shuttle was obtained at Fox Creek (PL XXV, 8). Two weights for nets also come from the same site. One of these was made by notching the ends of a fragment of mammoth leg bone, 17.3 cm long (PL XXV, 5). The notches, of course, lack the dark patination found on the surface of the bone. The second netweight is made of a section of antler with a hole drilled through one end; the other end has been broken off. MISCELLANEOUS WORKED WOOD AND ANTLER, ETC. In exploring the cut bank at Fox Creek, we found the end of a wooden bar, rectangular in section, with a hole or slot near the end (PL XXV, 4). It is evidently part of the same type of object that was found at the Old Fish Camp and at New Grayling (PL XVI, 2). At Fox Creek, Mr. Ray found a narrow slab of walrus (?) ivory with two longitudinal cuts in it, as if an attempt had been made to saw it into narrow strips. In Mr. Ray's collection there is a small antler spoon, with a narrow, straight handle (PL XXVI, 11, R.) The bowl, which is broken, is very shallow and seems to have been narrow. An undecorated bird bone tube was obtained at Ghost Creek (PL XXVI, 12). ORNAMENTAL BONE STRIPS AND EDGING Five specimens found at Fox Creek are of a type not encountered in our work farther up the Yukon. One of these seems to have been a piece of a bone edging for a shovel blade (PL XXV, 6). It has a curved blunt edge, with holes along the inner, concave edge for pegging or lashing to the end of a wooden shovel. It is 5.6 cm wide. The remaining specimens are more difficult to identify although the most plausible expla nation is that they were intended to be pegged to wooden objects as decoration. Two of these are antler strips: one has four large holes down the middle (PL XXVI, 35); the second, three large holes and a smaller one (PL XXVI, 32). A third specimen is of ivory (?), flat on one side and slightly ridged on the other. There is a medial groove down the ridged side, in which seven small holes have been drilled (PL XXVI, 33). The last specimen is of antler, rectangular in outline, flat on one side and slightly rounded on the other. Near each end are nine small holes, and down the middle are four larger ones, evidently drilled afterwards, since one of the larger holes breaks into a small er one (PL XXVI, 34). ORNAMENTS From Fox Creek we obtained a white lime stone inset for a wooden dish (PL XXVI, 17), like that found on the Yukon above Holy Cross (PL XIV, 45). It is oval in outline with pointed ends, roughly facetted on the outer surface, and flat on the side to be glued to the wood. An oval object of mammoth ivory from Fox Creek, with a hole near one end, is probably a buckle (PL XXVI, 18, R). It is 5.2 cm long, and was probably 3.8 cm wide when complete. At the same site we found two pendants. One is probably made from the canine tooth of a fox, and has a groove about the root for suspension (PL XXVI, 19). The second is a bear canine with a hole drilled from one side of the root into the nerve cavity through which a sinew could have been threaded for attach ment (PL XXVI, 21). That the Fox Creek site was inhabited in re cent times is shown by the finding of two trade beads. One is a sky blue glass bead of the Cook type, the second is a rectangular green porcelain bead, decorated with three oblique black lines and with white and yellow spots (PL XXVI, 16). According to the natives, the latter type was brought by the Russians.</page><page sequence="161">CHAPTER IX ANALYSIS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL TYPES INTRODUCTION ALTHOUGH the material from the middle and lower Yukon is for the most part so modern that it might with some justice be called ethnological rather than archaeological, and although it is a somewhat haphazard collection rather than a set of specimens from systematically excavated sites, it can illustrate in part the material culture of the Tena just prior to white contact. Typologically it lies be tween the culture of the Pacific Eskimo and Aleut (of the Kachemak Bay III horizon) and of the modern Bering Strait Eskimo on the one hand, and the culture of the interior Atha baskans of the upper Yukon, Mackenzie and Copper rivers, on the other hand. It seems to be a blending of old and new elements of diverse origins: some are from the ancient Ice hunting horizon of the northern Eskimo; some, from the interior Snowshoe hunting complex of the northern Indians and Siberians; some seem to stem from an ancient North Pacific cultural continuum, others, from a recent cir cum-Pacific culture drift. It does not seem to be a particularly rich blend, however, even though we make due allowances for the scanti ness of our collections. But because Tena cul ture is such a composite product, it will be interesting to take the various types which we found and attempt to trace their distribu tion and their relationships to similar types in the surrounding areas. In this way we may gain some insight into the building of Tena material culture. ADZES In a previous study I came to the conclusion that the single-bladed splitting adz was a fairly recent type on the Northwest Coast, and had appeared on Cook Inlet in the latter half of the Third Period of the Kachemak Bay Eskimo cul ture. It is distributed from the Tsimshian and Haida north to the Eskimo of Kotzebue Sound, but is absent from the Aleut and from the Eskimo of the Alaska Peninsula.1 Nelson figures from Diomede Island what 1 de Laguna, 1934, p. 172. Add: Haida (NMC XII-B 521), Kotzebue Sound (Emmons, 1923, PL XII). appears to be a splitting adz of ivory, with a single large groove, describing it as a hafted wedge, which is an apt description for all adzes of this type.2 Perhaps related to this specimen are the modern and protohistoric ivory axes from St. Lawrence Island, grooved to fit against the handle, and usually found with a battered butt.3 Splitting adzes are relatively common on the northern part of the Northwest Coast (Haida, Tsimshian, Tlingit, and Chugach Es kimo) but they are not found south of the Tsimshian and Haida, and they are quite rare among the Eskimo north of the Alaska Pen insula. It would seem, therefore, as if this type of heavy adz had been developed by the northern Northwest Coast Indians, probably in connection with their remarkable wood working art, and that it spread north from them. A number of Athabaskan tribes have copied it. The Eyak (Na-Dene) of the Copper River Delta had splitting adzes,4 which was not surprising in view of the abundance of adzes of this type among their Tlingit and Chugach neighbors. Osgood5 publishes a typi cal splitting adz from the Tanaina of Kenai, Cook Inlet, as a pick for digging or for chop ping holes in the ice. Of course, in this part of Cook Inlet one does not know whether such isolated archaeological specimens were made by the earlier Eskimo inhabitants or by the Tanaina Athabaskans. Since the latter copied so much from their Eskimo predecessors it would not be unreasonable to suppose that they also copied this type of adz. This type seems also to have been used by the prehistoric Athabaskans of the upper Tanana, for Rainey6 found at the site of Dixthada what appear to have been such adzes, and which he describes as "fragments of roughly polished adz blades of a type found on the surface of many regions of central Alaska."

The fully grooved ax, which utilized a similar means of attachment, belongs to the Early and Late New York Coastal, the New York Vine Valley? but not to the succeeding Owasco aspect?and to the Northern Coastal shell heap cultures of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, and Nova Scotia, although it is rare in the Maritimes.9 Hadlock records that a few specimens have even been found in classic Red Paint sites.10 Despite the resemblances between the grooved adzes, gouges and axes of the North east and the splitting adzes of the Northwest, the specimens in these two areas do not seem to be directly related to each other. I believe that they are parallel developments which have arisen independently from the smaller planing adz which itself has an ancient and wide distribution. Occasionally in the South west one will find grooved adz blades which are merely variants of the common three-quarter grooved Pueblo ax (see the collection at the Pueblo III site at Aztec, New Mexico, for ex ample) .

Valley is the only region where double-bladed splitting adzes were used. Aside from the speci mens published in this report, we can refer again to those illustrated by Hrdlicka and to one from Fort Yukon published by Osgood.11 Fort Yukon lies just within the territory of the Kutchin, not far from the frontier of the Upper Tena on the Yukon. We ought, how ever, to mention a number of double-bladed adzes, even though they are flat rather than thick, and so can hardly be called true splitting adzes. They probably ought to be included in the related class of "intermediate type" blades which I shall discuss presently. One of these flat double-ended blades is from Hotham Inlet, in Kotzebue Sound; two are from the modern and protohistoric periods on St. Lawrence Island, and they are sometimes found on Interior Salish sites.12 Although I cannot say anything about the place of origin of these few flat double-bladed adzes, I believe that the double-bladed split ting adz was a Tena invention, based on the single-bladed splitting adz which reached the Tena from the Northwest Coast. Whether the latter came to them via their Eskimo neighbors on the lower Yukon and Kuskokwim, or whether it came via their relatives on Cook Inlet and the Copper River, it is difficult to say. In favor of the first hypothesis is the fact that single-bladed splitting adzes are more common on the lower than on the middle Yukon, where the double-bladed type is found almost exclusively. On the other hand, the absence of the splitting adz in any form among the Aleut and Eskimo of the Alaska Peninsula suggests that to reach the Eskimo of the Yukon Kuskokwim region the splitting adz made a detour inland, via Athabaskan territory. It is difficult to find Asiatic parallels to the American splitting adz. Kanda13 figures a gouge-adz from Oshima in Satsuma Province of Kyushu Island, Japan, with an enlarged butt to hold the lashing. Two other specimens from the same place have similar, but less pro nounced butts, and related to them is an un grooved adz, also from the same locality. Jochelson14 states that the Neolithic inhab 11 Hrdltfka, 1930 a, PL 10; Osgood, 1936, PL 10 B, p. 85. 12Kotzebue Sound (Emmons, 1923, PL XIV a), St. Lawrence Island (Geist and Rainey, 1936, PL 34, 7 and p. 126, PL 49, 7and p. 149), Salish (Teit, 1928, p.

A grooved ax was even found in Shantung Province, in China, where it appears as a unique and puzzling specimen. Laufer,15 who publishes it, suggests that the grooved ax was invented in North America and was either traded to or copied in China. He also publishes, as a "stone hammer," an object from Sakhalin Island which looks like a fully grooved ax.16 However, these axes are not likely to be related to the splitting adz in any direct fashion, and the making of grooves or projections to secure the lashing is such an obvious invention that it probably means noth ing when considered by itself. The Japanese gouges might be related to the splitting adz, though their apparent restriction to Kyushu would suggest that they belonged to the cul ture of the Neolithic Japanese proper. Since no splitting adzes or grooved gouges have been found in any known Ainu, Kamchadal, or Aleut site, there is little likelihood that the American type was introduced into southern Japan. These Kyushu specimens then, to the best of our knowledge, must be considered as local developments of some tool brought from the Asiatic mainland. In addition to the splitting adz, which is distinguished by its high grooved or ridged back and its relatively narrow cutting edge, there is also found in the American Northwest a type of adz blade which is related to it, and which we may call the "intermediate type" since it stands halfway between the splitting adz and the small, relatively thin, and un grooved planing adz blade. Like the splitting adz, this "intermediate type" blade was lashed directly to the handle and was furnished with notches or grooves to secure the lashing, but resembled the planing adz in being relatively thin and wide. It is quite probable that we should expand this class to include all un grooved adz blades that were fastened directly to the handle (cf. PL XI, 5), distinguishing them from the blades that were secured to an intervening haft of bone. Since, however, we are dealing with archaeological specimens, the hafting of which is necessarily uncertain, I shall consider for the present only those blades which bear unmistakable evidence of having 16 Laufer, 1912, PL XIII, 1, pp. 50, 52 f. 16 Op. cit., PL XIII, J, p. 51. been lashed directly to a handle, that is, those which are grooved or notched. I have already mentioned the double-ended blades which might be included in this class. Grooved adz blades of this "intermediate" type are known from the Tlingit.17 One was found at Cape Nome, and two, at Point Barrow, in Eskimo territory.18 Though grooved, they are comparable to the notched specimen from the Nowitna-Koyukuk stretch of the Yukon (PL XI, 7). Mathiassen considers this anom alous intermediate type, which he calls "large stone blades for adzes," as characteristic of the "Western Thule Culture."19 However, he groups together the grooved specimens of uncertain age with the ungrooved Birnirk blades. The latter were hafted directly to the handle, as is shown by Van Valin's material from Birnirk sites near Point Barrow.20 I am doubtful whether these two kinds of blades were of the same age. It seems more likely that the grooved or notched "intermediate" type blades are relatively late, probably representing a blending of the large Birnirk blades without groove with the grooved splitting adz of the south. There is the further possibility that the plain Birnirk blades are descended from the large adz blades of the ancient Ipiutak culture of Point Hope. Although the position of this culture is still obscure, it shows linkages with both the Old Bering Sea, farther south, and with the Siberian Neolithic. Only a few Ipiutak adz blades have been published. Some are ordi nary planing adz blades, but one specimen re sembles the splitting adz in general shape and proportions, although it lacks any groove or knob for attachment.21 Are we to see in it the influence of the Siberian Neolithic? A further problem is presented by the fact that three notched slate adz blades, one from Cape Dorset, the others from the Belcher Islands in Hudson Bay, seem to belong to or to be descended from the ancient Canadian Dorset Eskimo culture.22 They are probably a local development, entirely unrelated to the grooved and notched blades of the Northwest.

A three-quarter grooved stone ax, probably an Eskimo copy of the In dian type, was found on the north side of Strathcona Sound, near the mouth of Admiralty Inlet in northern Baffinland.23 If we turn now to the smaller, thinner and relatively broad, plain blades which I have called "planing adz blades," we find these widely distributed. They belong to almost every phase of Eskimo culture, ancient and modern, being lost only among the Polar Eskimo and the Caribou Eskimo (except for the group at the coast), are doubtful in Labrador, and are rare among the modern Central Eskimo and Aleut.24 They extend much farther down the Pacific Coast than do the heavy splitting adzes, since they are found as far south as California, and furthermore, extend farther into the North western interior.25 They are also common in Asia. I have already mentioned examples from Kamchatka, Japan, and Formosa, and can add to these modern iron specimens from the Chukchee and Koryak which seem to have been derived from the same type, as well as archaeo logical specimens from Mongolia, and Shensi and Shantung provinces in China.26 Anders son27 has in fact shown that this type of adz goes back as far as the Neolithic Yang Shao stage of Chinese culture in Honan, which is sufficient to establish its antiquity in the North Pacific area. Some of the specimens published by Andersson are quite thick, approaching the ungrooved splitting adze in profile, and suggest ing the form from which these were, perhaps, to spring eventually.28 ?

Olson has pointed out that the planing adz is undoubtedly related to the adz-like fleshing tool of the Plains.29 This relationship not only applies to the shape of the blade but to the motor habits employed in using the adz and the flesher. Outside the Plains, moreover, we often find unusually small and fragile blades that seem better adapted for scrapers than for adzes, and, as I explained in Chapter VI, we cannot be sure of their use. I defer further dis cussion of them until the section on scrapers. The hafting of the planing adz blade presents interesting problems. It will be remembered that a broken bone adz haft was found at Fox Creek (PL XXV, 9). This was probably the modern local Eskimo type, with a socket for the blade and holes for lashing to the handle, such as Nelson has published from the Yukon Eskimo.30 No other adz hafts were found on the Yukon, but this lack of evidence does not prove that they were not made by the Tena. How ever, the distribution of small adz blades would indicate that if such hafts were made it was only by the Ingalik of the region between Blackburn and Holy Cross. Moreover, the hafted specimen from Hologochaket on the In noko (PL XI, 5) indicates that at least some of these small blades were attached without a bone haft. Osgood does not mention bone hafts. Eskimo adz hafts may be classified according to the following traits: (1) bed, or (2) socket for the blade; (3) groove, or (4) holes, or (5) knobs to hold the lashing attaching it to the handle; or (6) a hole for the handle. The ap pended table shows such a classification of Eskimo and Salish adz hafts. Eskimo and Salish Adz Hafts Ipiutak: socket for blade, groove for lashing. (Rainey, 1941 b, PL II, //.)

Since adz heads with socket for the blade are more widely distributed, they may be older than hafts with bed for the blade, even though both types appear at the same levels in the Old Bering Sea culture and in Kachemak Bay. The greater antiquity of the socket for the blade seems to be supported by the Ipiutak material. In 1934, I suggested that the groove for the lashing was older than the use of holes, and that the latter was an Arctic or Thule Punuk development (cf. Thule Type II and Punuk Types I and II). I also suggested that the recent northern Alaskan types, with socket and holes or groove, were types that had been reintroduced into Alaska by the return of the Canadian Thule culture, since these recent heads are plain and contrast strikingly with the elaborately shaped heads typical of the Old Bering Sea and Punuk cultures.31 Collins is inclined to agree with me, but reserves judg ment until we know more about the Birnirk types.32 As far as we know, from the one ex ample found and published, these Birnirk hafts were also quite plain, with socket and groove. The plain Thule hafts are probably derived from these, but the groove has been replaced, in many cases, by holes for the lash ing. The great development of drilling and the use of drilled holes for lashing seem to be very characteristic of the Canadian Thule culture. Thus, Collins33 has pointed out that the use of lashing holes on open socket harpoon heads is typical of the Canadian Thule culture and is one of the traits introduced into northern Alaska in recent times by the return movement of that culture. As far as adz hafts are con cerned, the development of lashing holes is not an exclusively Canadian feature, but is one that links the Punuk and Thule stages, and is foreshadowed in the Old Bering Sea culture. The recent northern Alaskan types are prob ably the survivors of the simple Birnirk type, reinforced by the introduced Thule types in which lashing holes are prominent. The adz haft also seems to be found on the Asiatic side of the North Pacific. From a semi subterranean ruin at the mouth of the Naya khan River in Koryak territory, Jochelson34 obtained a specimen which he published as a bone hammer head, but which looks like a broken adz haft, with a hole for the handle (as on the Old Bering Sea Type III) and holes for the lashing. The "socketed celts" of the northern Chinese Bronze Age are, as Anders son36 has pointed out, simply the forerunner of the modern carpenter's adz of Chihli and Honan provinces; the same tool was also used by the non-Chinese Shan of southwestern China. These "celts" are metal adz blades with a socket at the butt, into which fits the tenon 31 de Laguna, 1934, p. 173 f. 32 Collins, 1937 a, p. 334. 33 Collins, 1929 a, pp. 43 f; 1937 a, p. 309. cf.

The haft is a piece which fits, like the crossbar of a T, on top of a straight handle, being provided itself with a hole into which the tenon of the handle is thrust (cf. Old Bering Sea Type III). Andersson derives this metal adz blade from the stone planing adz blades ("stone chisel") of the Chinese Neo lithic,36 but he suggests that the stone proto type lacked a haft and was fastened instead directly to a bed on top of a wooden elbow shaped handle. It may well be that some of the larger and thicker blades from Yang Shao37 were hafted in this way. On the other hand, the very presence of the intermediate piece, or haft, on the later adzes suggests strongly that the prototype also had a haft. The socket could not have been in the blade, for that was of stone, but must have been in the haft. Later, when the blade was made of metal, the socket was made at the butt of the blade. Such an interchange of socket and tenon is often en countered and is almost to be expected when new materials are introduced for one of the parts. I would suggest, therefore, that the stone adz blades of the Yang Shao Neolithic stage were hafted in adz hafts similar to the Old Bering Sea Type III. Adz hafts of this type, with socket for the blade and hole at right angles for the handle, are common in the Danish Maglemose culture, and Birket-Smith has already compared Es kimo adz hafts with these, although at the time he wrote the Old Bering Sea Type III with shaft hole had not been found, so that he was forced to point out the difference between the pierced Maglemose type and the common unpierced Eskimo types then known.38 Cer tainly the pierced type is very ancient, and it may have been the oldest Eskimo type. The Salish Type I, with hole in the end, parallel to the blade socket, would not appear to be a local and perhaps recent development, as I had suggested,39 but may well date back to considerable antiquity. The Danish Maglemose, we should point out, possessed a bone adz or ax?not a haft, but a blade made of bone? and utilized the natural hole in the bone as a socket for the handle.40 It was, therefore, very similar to the Salish Type I haft of antler. Olson41 implies that the handle for these 36 Andersson, 1923, pp. 6 f., Fig. 1. 37 Op. tit., PL VI, 17. 38 Clark, 1936, Fig. 40, 3,4; Birket-Smith, 1929, II, p. 28. 39 de Laguna, 1934, p. 174. 40 Clark, 1936, Fig. 40, 6. Salish adzes was straight, but some of the archaeological specimens may well have been elbow-shaped, like the common Eskimo adz handles. If we are correct in assuming that the Salish Type I and the Old Bering Sea Type III adz hafts are related, and perhaps stem from an an cestral type common to the Maglemose and to the hypothetical Yang Shao type that I have suggested, then we must assign the adz haft with blade socket and shaft hole to a stage of Eskimo culture older than that represented by Collins' Old Bering Sea finds, because in them this type of haft was already largely sup planted by more typically Eskimo forms. The sockets or pits into which the top of the handle was fitted, in Old Bering Sea Types I, II, and IV and in Punuk Types I and II, may be con sidered as residual relics of the earlier shaft hole. The shaft hole was preserved, however, in the bone mattock blades?an adz-like dig ging tool?of the Punuk, protohistoric and modern St. Lawrence Island, and Canadian Thule cultures.42 Already in the Birnirk and Canadian Thule cultures the depression in the adz haft which received the top of the handle had begun to flatten out, until all that was left was the flat undersurface, such as is found in many modern Alaskan specimens. (The Dorset and southwestern Alaskan adz hafts are also flat on the undersurface.) Our specimen from Fox Creek, and the Yukon Eskimo specimen figured by Nelson must be considered as typi cal of the final stage in the development of the Eskimo adz haft. The holes for lashing to the handle may indicate the southernmost limit of influence from the recently introduced Ca nadian Thule types. We have not yet considered the type of handle used when the blade is lashed directly to it without the introduction of an intermedi ate haft. In the case of our specimen from Holo gochaket (PL XI, 5) the handle is elbow- or V or L-shaped, and a bed for the blade has been made on the outer surface of the short arm. Olson43 has classified the adzes of the Pacific Northwest on the basis of their handles, dis tinguishing between the elbow, the D, and the straight types. It is with the first type that we are particularly concerned, since this is the "Olson, 1927, p. 14, Fli, la. 42 Collins, 1937 a, PL 80, 2; Geist and Rainey, 1936, PL 24, 3, 4, PL 43,8; Mathiassen, 1927,1, PL 21, 3, 5. 43 Olson, 1927, p. 13, cf. esp. PL I.</page><page sequence="167">160 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 type represented by the Hologochaket speci men. The heavy splitting adzes, also, and the "intermediate type" adz blades were lashed to an elbow handle or to the derived T-shaped handle. Even on the Eskimo planing adz, the haft was so placed with reference to the wooden handle as to form a two-piece elbow handle. Olson writes with respect to the various types of handle:44 While they do not occupy mutually exclusive areas, the types are rather definitely localized. Thus, the elbow adz is seldom found south of the Puget Sound region,45 the straight type does not occur north of the Straits of Juan de Fuca, and the Columbia River on the south and the south ern tip of Alaska seem to mark the respective limits of the D adz. The virtual restriction of the elbow type only to the northern part of the area and its wide range outside the Northwest Coast suggests that this form had its origin somewhere outside the area, possibly in Asia. . .. It appears that the D adz represents an attempt to de velop a wood-working tool which lacks the defects of the elbow type . . . [Its distribution, the relative degrees of elaboration of the tool itself and of the woodworking art] . . . suggest that the place of origin of the D type is some where in the Kwakiutl-Nootka area. Olson does not offer any definite hypothesis to explain the relationships of the three forms, but his discussion would suggest that the D adz developed from either the elbow or the straight adz, that the straight adz was autoch thonous, and that the elbow adz was intrusive and had no relationship to the straight adz.46 I myself would consider the elbow adz to be the fundamental type which somewhere in the north (in the Old World), and long ago, de veloped into the socket adz with haft, and that farther south and much more recently evolved into the heavy splitting adz with T-shaped handle, and the delicate D adz. Still farther south, beyond the area of skilled woodworking, it may have degenerated into the straight adz. Both the plain elbow adz and the adz with haft came to the New World from the Old. The problem which particularly interests us is whether the plain elbow adz and the socketed adz with haft came into North America at the same time and by the same route. Birket Smith47 was not certain whether the adz belongs to the earliest stage of Eskimo culture, al though since he wrote, the discovery of small adz blades in the Old Bering Sea, Ipiutak, 44 Op. tit., pp. 15 f. 46 It is, however, found archaeologically in northwestern California (Kroeber, 1925, PL 119; 1936, p. 114). 46 Olson, 1927, p. 17. 47 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, pp. 27 ff. Kachemak Bay I, Birnirk, and Dorset cultures would indicate that the adz is as old as the oldest Eskimo horizon that we know. In all of these cultures, except in the Kachemak Bay I, hafts for planing adz blades have been found, and I have inferred from the small size of many of the Kachemak Bay I blades that they also were hafted in an intermediate piece.48 But is the plain elbow adz equally old in Eskimo culture? In discussing two elbow adzes with antler handles from the Tanaina, Birket-Smith writes:49 On these the intermediate piece is a natural prong of the handle and thus essentially different to the Eskimo type? in reality there is much greater likeness to the few ax handles which are thought to represent Denmark's earliest Stone Age [see Clark, 1936, Fig. 27, Lyngby antler axes and ax handles], whereas the Eskimo type more resembles the presumably younger ax [ and adz] heads of the Mulle rup [Maglemose] Period, apart from the fact that the latter have a shaft hole. We have already pointed out that the find ing of Old Bering Sea hafts with a shaft hole makes the justice of Birket-Smith's comparison all the more striking. I believe there can be no question that the adz haft or head developed from the projecting prong of an elbow adz like the Lyngby and Tanaina types. Wood splits too easily to permit the socketing of the blade as securely as does bone. The utilization of the greater tensile strength of bone is certainly a trait that developed in the Epipaleolithic period and belongs to the Ice-hunting stage. Yet a handle and haft made of one piece of antler has the disadvantage that the angle of the blade with respect to the handle is fixed by the natural shape of the antler. The development of improved woodworking that was bound to come with the growth of the boreal forests in Maglemose times demanded a better adjust ment of blade and handle. Therefore, the handle was made of wood, the blade was hafted in a separate piece of antler, and the two were joined to suit the higher technological demands of the worker. With the development of metal in the Bronze Age of Europe, the Near East, China and Siberia, the socket was naturally transferred to the metal blade, but in the north, to which metal did not spread until quite late, the adz blade remained socketed in bone. Probably all through this development the old 48 de Laguna, 1934, pp. 57, 121. No hafts have been found in Chugach sites, although small adz blades occur. 49 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, p. 28.</page><page sequence="168">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 161 elbow adz remained side by side with its sock eted descendant. When Birket-Smith wrote his great work on the Caribou Eskimo he complained that the archaeological material available to him gave little information about the methods of hafting adz blades.50 We still suffer from the same lack of data. In the absence of grooves or notches on the blades to indicate that they were lashed di rectly to a handle, and in the absence of the handles and hafts themselves, we can only guess from the size and shape of the blades their prob able method of attachment. All of the adz blades found by Collins in Old Bering Sea and Punuk sites are quite small, and were probably all fastened to a bone or ivory haft. However, size is often misleading, since we have a Birnirk adz with a very small blade still attached with the original lashing to a bed on the horn elbow handle.51 This specimen is the oldest example of a plain elbow adz in Eskimo culture, with the exception of the notched "intermediate type" Dorset blades which also imply such a handle. However, large blades, probably intended for elbow handles without separate haft, are found in undated and relatively recent sites in north ern Alaska (Barter Island, Point Barrow), and, as already mentioned, Mathiassen has listed as a "western Thule type" such large stone adz blades which must have been lashed directly to the handle, classing them with "intermediate type" blades.52 It would now appear that large, ungrooved adz blades date back to the Ipiutak. Large blades, without grooves, occur in every level of the Kachemak Bay culture and are also common on prehistoric Interior Salish sites.53 The elbow adz must also have been very common in the Northeast, to judge by the num ber of large adz blades found in this area. Thus, the facetted or "beveled" adz of the Archaic is certainly too heavy to have been hafted to any thing but an elbow or T-shaped handle.54 All of the grooved and knobbed adzes and gouges of New England, which we have previously com pared to splitting adzes, were certainly hafted in the same way, as Willoughby shows in his re constructions.55 We must postulate the same 60 Birket-Smith, 1929, n, pp. 28 f. 61 J. A. Mason, 1930, PL III, 11. 62 Mathiassen, 1930 a, PL 6, 13, pp. 26, 43, 94. 53 de Laguna, 1934, p. 57; H. I.

The gouges of the Lau rentian, the larger examples of the plano-con vex adzes of the Archaic, Orient, Vine Valley, Owasco, and New York Coastal cultures, and the "bar celts" and the grooved or double-bit ted adzes of the Iroquois, all must have had el bow or T-shaped handles.57 In fact, such handles must have been universally employed in the Northeast from the earliest times until iron axes were obtained from the white men. Although some of the adze blades of the Northeast are small enough to have been hafted in a socketed head or haft, no such hafts have ever been found, with the possible exception of two specimens from the type site of the Can andaigua focus of the Owasco aspect.58 We must therefore assume that the small blades, like the larger adzes and gouges, were fastened directly to the handle. We do not know, of course, whether these handles were furnished at the end with a bed for the blade (except where the blade itself shows evidence of the necessary lashing), or whether the handles had sockets for the insertion of the blades. Wil loughby suggests that some of the Red Paint adz blades may have been hafted by insertion into a socket at the end of the elbow handle.59 There is thus every reason to suppose that the plain elbow handle for the adz belongs to a very early hunting horizon in the New World. Asia has yielded similar evidence. Jochelson believes that the stone "slender chisels, wide gouges, [and] bent gouges" of the Siberian Neo lithic were lashed directly to the handle.60 Some of the blades which he excavated in Kamchatka, 66 Tadoussac (Wintemberg, 1929, p. 40; 1931, p. 72, PL VI, 2), Red Paint (Moorehead, 1922, Fig. 51, lower speci mens), Newfoundland (Howley, 1915, PL XVII, 9; Win temberg, 1939-1940, PL XV, 2, 6, pp. 313 f.). 57 Laurentian gouges (Bailey, 1939, PL IV, 22; Ritchie, 1940 b, PL XVI, 30, 32-38), plano-convex adzes (Ritchie, 1932 b, PL 9 q, pp. 408,410,412; 1934, PL XIV, 22; 1936 a, PL XII, 32; 1938 b, p. 105), Iroquois (Parker, 1922, PL 88, 4, Fig. 50; Wintemberg, 1931, p. 72). 58 Ritchie, 1936 a, PL X, 3, 4, p. 47. 59 Willoughby, 1935, Fig. 18 /; cf. the Danish Lyngby antler handle. 60 Jochelson, 1928, p. 29.</page><page sequence="169">162 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 some of the heavy, thick blades found in Mon golia, and some of the larger Yang Shao blades from northern China were no doubt lashed, as Andersson suggests, to a bed in the top of an elbow handle.61 In view of this wide and ancient distribution of the plain elbow adz handle on all sides of the Eskimo, it would be curious if it were not known to the ancient Eskimo, even though it was not as important for them as the "elbow adz" com posed of a handle and a socketed haft. While the plain elbow adz was lacking from the Old Bering Sea and Punuk cultures, as far as we know, it seems to have belonged to the Ipiutak, Birnirk, Dorset and Kachemak Bay I, and I suggest that the adz hafts themselves of the Old Bering Sea and Punuk indicate the presence or the in fluence of the plain elbow adz. These hafts (Old Bering Sea Types I and II, Punuk Types I and II, as well as the modern St. Lawrence Type II, and the Kachemak Bay III Type I) are in a way anomalous, because they have a bed for the blade, not a socket. This means that they fail to take advantage of the natural toughness of bone in hafting. They might just as well have been made of wood, as, indeed, were some of the Old Bering Sea speci mens. Typologically, therefore, they seem to be closer to the original one-piece wooden elbow handle than are the socketed hafts, but I do not think that this apparent similarity means that they are less evolved than are the bone hafts with socket. Rather, they may have developed as a degeneration of the socketed haft, by a process of rapprochement or convergence to wards the wooden handle, and this itself would mean that the plain wooden handle without in termediate bone piece could not have been far away. HUNTING PICKS It will be remembered that Chief Luke of Tanana Mission identified as hunting weapons the double-bladed splitting adzes from the Yukon above Tanana (Pis. X, 9 and XI, 2), and a similar identification was given for the single-bladed "intermediate type" adz from the Nowitna-Koyukuk stretch of the Yukon (PL XI, 7). While too much trust should not be placed in the identification of individual speci mens, the fact that this weapon was mentioned 61 Kamchatka (op. tit., PL 9), Mongolia (Torii, 1913 1914, PL III A h), China (Andersson, 1923, PL VI, 17, and Fig. 1). and the fact that some of the splitting adzes have pick-like blades, would indicate that the Tena (or Upper Tena) did use a weapon of this type. In default of a special pick, a hunter may even have carried an ordinary adz for protec tion. The double-ended pick-like adzes are il lustrated in Plates X, 9 and XI, 2, from the Yukon above Tanana; single-ended specimens are illustrated in Plate X, 8, from the Tozi; Plate XI, 4, from Anvik Point; and Plate XI, 3, from the Innoko River. There is also an unfin ished club or pick head from the Tanana-No witna area (PL XI, 1). The Chugach Eskimo sites in Prince William Sound62 yield a few single-bladed splitting adzes with equally narrow, pick-like blades, a few heavy chipped stone picks, and a few double ended specimens with a groove in the middle set between prominent ridges, the blades fin ished off in such a way that it would be difficult to say whether they were more pick-like or ax like. These last specimens were certainly weapons, not tools, and must be closely related to the Tena examples. As far as I know, these are the only Eskimo parallels. The Alaskan Es kimo from Old Bering Sea times down to the present day have made use of heavy ivory picks often lashed to the handle by means of grooves and ridges, but these were implements for dig ging, not weapons for war or hunting.63 Axes with crude stone blades are occasionally used by the Eskimo and were more common among the Eyak, but again these were chopping tools, not weapons.64 To find analogies to the Tena hunt ing picks we must turn to their Indian neigh bors. Osgood65 figures a combination stone hammer and pick head from Fort Yukon. One end is blunt, the other battered. As weapons, the Peel River Kutchin used a caribou antler with one projecting tine, or a moose mandible "studded 62 de Laguna, 1934, p. 155; Birket-Smith and de Laguna, field notes, 1933. 63 Old Bering Sea and Punuk (Collins, 1937 a, pp. 160 f. and PL 49, pp. 234 f.), Birnirk (UPM 29-90-336 and 337), protohistoric and modern St. Lawrence Island (Geist and Rainey, PL 24, 5, p. 104, PL 43, 9, p. 140), modern Cape Nome, Nunivak Island, and Norton Sound ( E. W. Nelson, 1899, PL XXXIII b, 1, 2, 3), Kachemak Bay III (de Laguna, 1934, PL 46, 13). Curiously enough these picks seem to be lacking from the Thule culture but belong to the Canadian Dorset (NMC IX-B-232 and MAI 15/8255 from Nuvuk and Mill Islands in Hudson Bay). 64 Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, pp. 406 ff., like the stone ax described by Osgood from the Ingalik Tena, cf.

Sometimes a sharp chipped stone blade was hafted, ax-like, in the tine.67 At Tyonek, however, the Tanaina also made use of an ordinary adz as a weapon for war.68 The Interior Salish used antler war picks with an ax-like tine.69 In fact this type of antler pick or spiked club is typical of the northern interior, where more highly developed clubs were not used. The Carrier used long poles with a chipped scythe-like blade.70 The Eyak used a wooden war club with spikes made of the sharp ened branches or of inserted bone.71 The Tlingit had antler clubs with an ax-like stone blade in the tine, or wooden clubs with an inserted bone point like a pick.72 With the exception of the adz used by the Tanaina of Tyonek, none of these weapons are very similar to those of the Tena and Chugach. The "slave-killers" of the northern North west Coast tribes and of the Salish have stone blades, and these are either axes or picks. There is no doubt that they are related to the simpler antler and wooden clubs mentioned above. War axes (tomahawks) were used by the Interior and Coast Salish.73 With a few exceptions, these blades are long and chisel-like. Smith describes an archaeological Coast Salish specimen made entirely of stone, but shaped as if it were a copy of a club with a wooden handle through which were hafted two double-ended ax blades.74 It was said by the Indians to have been used for war or hunting. Sometimes the "slave-killer" was a sword-like club made of a single piece of stone, with one or two projections on the same edge, like ax blades, and this type was charac teristic of the Pacific coast from California to southeastern Alaska.75 Among the Tlingit, 66 Op. tit., pp. 86, 88. 67 Osgood, 1937, PL 13 A, p. 110. 68 Op. tit., p. 111. 69 H.

Haida, and Tsimshian, however, a war pick was also made, the stone point usually being hafted through a hole in the wooden handle.76 Some of these weapons were double-pointed picks, the stone head being lashed to the top of the handle, and these specimens are almost identical with the war picks of the Prince William Sound Eskimo and the pick-like "splitting adzes" from the Yukon.77 The specimens, therefore, which most closely resemble Tena hunting picks are to be found among the Kutchin of Fort Yukon, the Chu gach of Prince William Sound, the Haida and the Tsimshian. As with the Tena, an ordinary adz sometimes served as a weapon among the Tanaina of Tyonek. Analogous forms are not wanting from Asia. Double-bladed ax-picks, almost identical with the Chugach specimens have been found in Hida and Ehime provinces and generally in southern and central Japan.78 Kanda believed such stone clubs or "Raiko" to be limited to southern and central Honshu, but Ohyama and Schnell have shown them to be characteristic of the Jomon (or earliest Ainu) culture of north eastern Honshu.79 The resemblances between the Ainu and Chugach specimens are so striking that they cannot be due to chance. There is no doubt, too, that this type of war pick is related to, or has been influenced by the splitting adz of the Northwest Coast, in some cases, as among the Tena, has even fused with it. I would suggest that the Ainu weapon may be a copy of the American. If this is true, the route of its diffusion must have been across the Aleu tian Islands, and I would therefore look to find such specimens on those islands, in Kamchatka, and on the Kuriles. However, we have still to consider the origin of the ax used in war, and it has a great an tiquity in the Old World. Jochelson says of the Siberian Neolithic:80 "Some of the large stone 610), Coast Salish (Boas in H. I. Smith, 1906 a, Fig. 181 a, b), Tsimshian (specimens in NMC), Tlingit (Boas in H. I.

Andersson has shown how the Chinese Ko or "hache-poinard" of the Bronze Age (we would call it a tomahawk) developed from a Neolithic stone blade with tang, shaped half-way be tween a pick and an ax,81 until it became a bronze blade with a tang and holes for lashing to the handle. Some of the latest forms are what one might describe as "pick-knives"; other Shang specimens Creel aptly calls "dag ger-axe" and "battle axe."82 More pick-like specimens can also be found in northern Asia. Thus, from Port Arthur, Manchuria, is a stone pick head in the shape of a bird with prominent beak, with hole for the handle, and a groove between ridges to hold the lashing.83 Kroeber84 has suggested that the club with knobbed head or spikes is an American Indian invention. I cannot believe that this is true of any of the types that we have mentioned. The simpler forms of clubs have such a world-wide distribution that they must have been one of man's earliest weapons. The clubs or picks made of an antler with projecting tine are so similar to the Lyngby antler axes and adzes of the early Mesolithic of northern Europe that the comparison with them has been made again and again. Clark writes of the latter:85 The Lyngby forms can probably best be regarded as mark ing a transition between clubs and the specialized forms of axe and adze, and in this they are of very great significance. It would be reasonable to suppose that this primitive type of generalized weapon and tool was diffused together with some of its more specialized descendants, and that it should sur vive as a weapon in the backward and rela tively isolated areas of the American North west Plateaus. On the Northwest Coast, the antler club-pick seems to have developed into more specialized forms, such as the club or pick with inserted bone and stone points. These, however, have also been influenced by northern Asiatic forms. All of the more highly developed Northwest Coast types that we have men tioned can be described as war picks, war axes, or war ax-picks. The ax-like character of so many of them is anomalous in an area where 81 Andersson, 1923, Fig. 2 a, p. 8; 1934, pp. 212 f., Figs. 101, 102. 82 Andersson, 1923, Pl.V; Creel, 1937 a, p. 145, PL XII, 1, 2; cf. also Shang bronze specimens at ROMA. 83 Egami, Komai, and Mizo, 1934, Fig. 2, /. 84 Kroeber, 1923, p. 3. 86 Clark, 1936, p. 84, Fig. 27,1, 2. the ax as a tool, not as weapon, is practically unknown?with the exception of a few true axes from the Chugach and Eyak?and where the adz is dominant. So strongly established were the motor habits involved in the use of the adz that when these Indians first obtained European axes they had to haft the steel blades as adzes. Now, in China, as we have seen, the original ax-pick developed into a true battle ax, and it is from the Asiatic North Pacific area that the American Northwest Coast derived so much cultural stimulus. It is not unlikely that the Northwest Coast types developed from the simpler club-pick under the influence of these Asiatic axes. Furthermore, the highly spe cialized coastal forms have assumed the specific function of "slave-killers," and the Chinese of the Shang period also used their bronze axes for the same purpose, even inscribing on them, as if for the benefit of archaeologists, the use to which they were put.86 It may also be signifi cant that the Neolithic and Bronze Age Chinese blades should have been hafted by means of a tang set into a hole in the handle, and that this same method of hafting should have been ap plied to many of the Northwest Coast war picks and war axes, where it appears as a "foreign" method in contrast with the more prevalent method of lashing blades to the top of the han dle. All of these circumstances suggest that the war ax-pick was originally a Neolithic Asiatic weapon which spread to the American North west and there brought about a transformation of the more primitive and earlier club-pick. Here in the American Northwest we must note a variety of modifications. Some types be came more pick-like, others more ax-like, some crossed with the monolithic stone club to pro duce monolithic axes?this point will be dis cussed in more detail in the next section?and some crossed with the splitting adz to form the heavy double-ended pick, lashed to the top of a T-shaped handle. The last type was, as I have suggested, carried back again to Japan. Under the influence of this specialized weapon, ordi nary adzes were sometimes carried as a weapon for war and hunting. CLUBS Two types of stone heads for clubs or ham mers were represented in the Tena collections. Both were grooved around the middle for lash ing to a handle, but one had rounded ends and 86 Creel, 1937 a, p. 206, PL X.</page><page sequence="172">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 165 no hole for the end of the handle (PL X, 6), while the other had bluntly pointed ends and a hole or socket (PL X, 3). The latter, which may not be a Tena specimen at all, has already been compared with Plains Indian club heads (p. 122). A similar specimen was published by Hill-Tout from the Middle Columbia Salish.87 The other plainer club head belongs to a much more widely distributed type. Mauls or hammers with similar stone heads are typical of the protohistoric and modern Alaskan Eskimo, the Kachemak Bay and Prince William Sound Eskimo cultures, and of the modern Northwest Coast Indians.88 Thus, for the Haida, New combe mentions: "small stone mauls, shaped like the larger ones used in making fish weirs, but said to have been used as weapons of war, and especially for dispatching slaves at cere monial feasts and distributions of property."89 Of the Northwest Coast in general, Niblack writes:90 "The hafted stone clubs were simply industrial tools already described [mauls? p. 279] and used for the time being as weapons." Hammer heads have not been found on Coast Salish sites, unless the few grooved stones from the Gulf of Georgia, which I have already com pared with the grooved throwing stones from Prince William Sound and Cook Inlet,91 are really club heads as Smith interpreted them. However, stone maul and club heads are known from the Middle Columbia Salish,92 and the Thompson (Interior Salish) used round stone club heads which they hafted in rawhide so that they were either rigid on the handle or able to swing.93 Plain grooved stone club heads are also typical of the Plains,94 and are found also in California and in the Southwest. Grooved maul heads were also used by the Chukchee and 87 Hill-Tout, 1934, p. 608. Teit (1928, p. 112) mentions that these people had grooved stone mauls and war club heads, but does not describe them in detail. 88 Alaskan Eskimo (Murdoch, 1892, Fig. 27; Geist and Rainey, 1936, PL 49, 13, pp. 148 f.; Collins found none in the Old Bering Sea or Punuk, and they seem to be lack ing also from the Birnirk, Ipiutak, and Canadian Thule and Dorset), Kachemak Bay and Prince William Sound (de Laguna, 1934, PL 17,1, PL 21, 6, p. 174), Northwest Coast (NMC XII-B-1423; Niblack, 1890, PL XX, 79 b, c, PL XII, 81,82,85,86, Boas, 1916, Fig. 4). 89 Newcombe, 1907, pp. 135 ff. 90 Niblack, 1890, p. 282. 91 de Laguna, 1934, p. 169. 92 Teit, 1928, p. 112; Hill-Tout, 1934, p. 609. 93 Teit, 189&amp;-1900, Figs. 247, 248, p. 263; cf. specimen in NMC. 94 Strong (1935, pp. 60, 66) found them very common at historic and protohistoric sites. Koryak95 so it is not surprising that the Tena had them. The very crude monolithic stone club from the Nowitna-Koyukuk region (PL XII, 2) is paralleled by equally crude specimens from the Thompson and Carrier.96 Such objects are prac tically unknown from the Eskimo, though a stone specimen which might be either a club or a pestle was found by Van Valin at a Birnirk site near Point Barrow97 and Wintemberg found a sandstone club at a Dorset Eskimo site in Newfoundland.98 In general, bone clubs are more common among the Eskimo.99 Bone clubs reached a high stage of development in the southern Northwest Coast, but in the North west in general we find two rather specialized types of stone clubs; pestle-shaped and sword shaped. Of course, wooden clubs are also used for dispatching fish and game and as weapons of war.100 Dagger-shaped stone clubs were used es pecially by the Tsimshian and the Salish.101 They were apparently used with a stabbing mo tion, to judge by the occurrence on the lower Fraser River of "skulls found [with] circular holes crushed in them about the size of the points of these stone clubs."102 A peculiar tool, possibly related to these, is the hand hammer adz of the lower Columbia Valley. It was apparently unhafted, has a battered butt, as if it had been struck by a mallet, a pitted and bat tered surface as if it had been used as a club or hammer, and an adz-like blade as if it had been used as a chisel.103 We cannot tell, of course, whether it was exclusively a tool or whether it also served as a weapon.

Both pestle-shaped and sword-shaped stone clubs are found in Japan. The first, Kanda106 di vides into four types: (1) with a knob at both ends; (2) with a knob at one end, the other end tapering; (3) with a knob at one end, the other end blunt [cf. the Tsimshian specimens illus trated by Niblack]; (4) without knobs (like a "roller pestle"). These four types of pestle-like clubs have been found from Kyushu to Hok kaido and thus probably belonged to both pre historic proto-Japanese and Ainu cultures. The sword-like club, on the other hand, Kanda107 knew only from central Japan and so believed that it belonged to the culture of the Japanese proper. Schnell and Ohyama, however, find the stone sword or "stone dagger" quite common in north Honshu, and so have established it as an early Ainu (Jomon) type.108 I have already drawn attention to the similarity between the stone sword-like clubs of the Northwest Coast and those of the Ainu and have suggested that they may be related.109 The same observation might be made concerning pestle-shaped clubs. It is, however, the stone swords that offer us a clue as to the direction in which they have been diffused. In tumuli in southern Manchuria, Torii110 found stone weapons which were a little too small to be called swords. They had a notch at the butt (for hafting?) and a ridge down both sides of the blade. He suggests that they are stone imitations of a metal (iron?) weapon. They would date, therefore, from the end of the local Neolithic, when a few metal objects were already being imported from China, and it is in the more advanced centers of northern China that we would look for the prototypes of the 104 Boas in H.

Stone swords or daggers have also been found in Korea.111 If the Ainu weapons are related to these, as is probable, then we have evidence of a cultural drift towards North America, and ought to confirm this hypothesis by looking for stone sword-like clubs on the Kuriles, in Kamchatka, and in southwestern Alaska. In the American Northwest these stone swords became elaborated by the addition of projections carved to represent heads of animals or fish,112 just as ordinary pestles were deco rated, or fused with the war ax to become mono lithic axes. The Tena, however, lay far to the north of the scene of these developments and so preserved only a much simpler and older form of monolithic stone club, related to the plain wooden and bone clubs and club-hammers. WHETSTONES AND STONE SAWS There is nothing very distinctive about the whetstones or larger grinding slabs from the Yukon. The range of forms is very similar to that from Eskimo sites in Kachemak Bay, Cook Inlet, except that the Tena lack a certain type which was peculiar to the Kachemak Bay III culture.1131 pointed out that the large grinding slab and grinding stone seem to be foreign to Eskimo culture outside of southwestern Alaska, where we know them from Cook Inlet, Prince William Sound, and the Aleutian Islands, but this statement will have to be modified, since a grinding slab has been reported from the mod ern St. Lawrence Island Eskimo.114 The grind ing slab is found in Kamchatka, and is also used by the Interior Salish.115 Although it yields to the mortar and pestle on the North west Coast, the grinding slab (metate and mano) again becomes prominent with the Klamath in northern California.116 I have already pointed out (page 123) that the whetstone or polishing stone of hard rock is a characteristic type in both the Old Bering Sea and Dorset Eskimo cultures, but it is doubt ful whether the hard rock whetstones from Bonasila and Fox Creek have any connection 111 Arimitsu, 1939, Fig. 1, esp.

Similar specimens are occasionally found in Rainey's "Thule," i.e. late Punuk, stage on St. Lawrence Island,117 and two quartz ite whetstones, probably Dorset in origin, were found at the Canadian Thule site at Nau jan on the west side of Hudson Bay.118 Strong reports hard red stones, polished smooth and flat on both sides, from the Upper Republican (prehistoric Pawnee) culture of Nebraska,119 and a polishing stone of porphyry was found in Kamchatka.120 Doubtless many more isolated finds of this kind have been made in a number of regions, but they do not seem to be very sig nificant. The stone saw is, however, a much more im portant type. Those from the Yukon (Pis. XIII, 1, 2, 3; XXV, 15) resemble somewhat the small specimens with from one to three cutting edges which Birket-Smith and I found in Prince William Sound.121 Stone saws make their ap pearance on Cook Inlet in the Kachemak Bay III culture. They are common at Coast and In terior Salish sites and since they are known from the Aleut (?) and the Pacific Eskimo, I sug gested that they should be found on the north ern part of the Northwest Coast.122 Up to now, they have not been found among the Eskimo north of the Alaska Peninsula, but their occur rence on the Yukon would suggest that they may be distributed at least as far north as the Eskimo at the mouth of that river. Sawed adz blades have been found as far north as Point Barrow, and a fragment of sawed slate was found on St. Lawrence Island.123 These speci mens, however, do not prove the use of the stone saw. Emmons reports that the Eskimo use a bone slab with sand and water, or a piece of flint with sand and water, or even a slab of wood with sand and water for cutting hard 117 A rectangular bar of basalt (Geist and Rainey, 1936, p. 197, PL 66,13). 118 Mathiassen, 1927,1, p. 53. 119 Strong, 1935, p. 109. 120 Jochelson, 1928, PL 11, 4. 121 de Laguna, 1934, p. 155; Birket-Smith and de Laguna, field notes, 1933. 122 de Laguna, 1934, p. 175 f. Emmons (1923, p. 40) says, however, that they are lacking on the coast north of Salish territory. The Clayoquot Nootka may have made them, since Koppert (1930, p. 37) reports that they made a "stone file" of hard black stone by chipping and grinding. "The natural coarseness of the grain gives it a file-like surface." Unfortunately he does not tell how it was used. 123 de Laguna, 1934, p. 172; Collins, 1937 a, PL 42,20. stones.124 Sawed stone is also known from the Dorset Eskimo culture, and what appears to be a single-edged stone saw was actually found at Cape Dorset itself.125 Unfortunately, I am not sure of the identification of this last specimen, and it appears to be unique. Turning south we find what appear to be stone saws on the southern California Coast among the Chumash and Gabrieleno.126 Kidder reports them from the Pueblo III or IV levels at Pecos, New Mexico and from the Swarts ruin in the Mimbres Valley.127 They were found at the Hohokam Grewe Site in southern Ari zona128 and Gladwin found eleven specimens in the Vahki to Sacaton phases at Snaketown in southern Arizona. He describes the type as a "thin flake of rhyolite [what I have called a 'boulder chip']; the edge along one side has been rubbed smooth." A sandstone "hoe" from the Sacaton Phase and three sandstone "knives" from the same level at Snaketown may also be saws.129 In 1934, I suggested that the stone saws of southwestern Alaska reached the Eskimo from the south, together with such typical Third Period elements as the slate mirrors and some of the decorative designs on the stone lamps with human figure.130 Now, however, the additional information which I have here compiled sug gests that the saw was older than I had originally supposed, even though there is no evidence that it appeared in southwestern Alaska before the Third Period of the Kachemak Bay culture. The methods employed by the northern Alaskan Eskimo in cutting stone may have been either an attempt to imitate the stone sawing practiced farther south, without employing the stone saw itself, or may be an earlier and more primitive method of cutting stone which was supplanted farther south by 124 Emmons, 1923, p. 43. H. I. Smith (1900, p. 416) men tions similar techniques which may have been employed by some of the Interior Salish in addition to, or in place of the use of the sandstone saw. 126 Sawed (?) nephrite adz blade (Jenness, 1925, Fig. 4 c); stone saw (?)

The single specimen from Cape Dorset presents an insoluble problem.131 I am now even less certain of the direction by which the saw came to southwestern Alaska. It is not only old in the south (the Vahki Phase of the Hohokam), but seems to be even older in Asia. I have already pointed out that some of the adz blades from Japan and Kamchatka seem to have been shaped by sawing.132 This in itself is not enough to prove that they were cut out with stone saws, but Torii states that in Manchuria, eastern Mongolia, and Japan, adz blades were shaped "by a kind of knife of mica schist."133 From Manchuria he figures a piece of sawed stone and a stone saw,134 and from Mon golia an adz or ax blade partially shaped by saw ing.135 Kanda also figures two stone saws from Japan, one of which is from Hokkaido (Yezo Island), which proves it to have been an Ainu tool.136 What appears to be a stone saw was found at an Eneolithic-Bronze Age site at Oka moto, Shichuzen Province, on Kyushu Island in southern Japan, dating from about the Birth of Christ when Korean influence was very strong.137 This would suggest that this implement reached the prehistoric Japanese proper from the Asi atic mainland and that it was passed on by them (?) to their Ainu neighbors in the north. The Mongolian and Manchurian stone saws are probably older than any in the Japanese archi pelago. I have been unable to find any ex amples of stone saws in China, although Laufer has published a Chou jade adz blade ("chisel") and a jadeite boulder from a Han grave, both showing sawing.138 On the basis of the evidence now available, it seems impossible to relate all the stone saws of the New World and of Asia to a common origin. They were probably older in Asia than in North America, where our oldest examples known at present date from the earliest Hoho kam. Yet they could not have been diffused 131 Sawed slate was found at the Nevin shell heap in Maine, but no stone saws (information from Douglas S. Byers). 132 de Laguna, 1934, p. 173; cf. also Kanda, 1884, PL VI, /, 3, 5: sawed adz blades from Musashi Province, near Tokyo. 133 Torii, 1913-1915, p. 18. 134 Op. tit., Fig. 8 (sawed stone), PL XI, 8 (stone saw). 136 Torii, 1913-1914, Fig. 25. 136 Kanda, 1884, PL VI, 7, 8.

It may be that there were two centers of invention and diffusion: one in northern Asia, affecting Mongolia, Manchuria, Korea (?) and Japan, and which was probably the source from which the Aleut, Pacific Es kimo, Tena, and Salish types were derived, the other, perhaps as far south as Middle America (?), from which were derived the Hohokam, Pueblo, and southern California examples. Since the stone saw or file is a type that is hard to recognize, it may actually be present in re gions from which it is as yet unreported, and so no hypothesis about the origin and diffusion of this type can be more than highly tentative. CHISELS AND WEDGES The two small stone chisels from Bonasila (PL XI, 8, 9) are rather similar to the small slate woodworking chisels of the Chugach. This type is characteristic of Prince William Sound, but seems to be practically absent from Cook Inlet.139 The Clayoquot Nootka and the Qui nault are supposed to have used a small stone chisel set into a wooden handle. This was struck with a stone hammer.140 Niblack figures a simi lar hafted chisel as typical of the Northwest Coast.141 Some of the small chisel-like celts of the Salish may have been used in the same way. The Chugach specimens are probably related to the Northwest Coast tools, but the Tena specimens are so crude that nothing much can be said about them. The "stone wedges" of the Carrier may, however, have been rather simi lar.142 That bone wedges were used by the Tena is scarcely surprising in view of the great distri bution and antiquity of this type. The wedge is ancient and widespread among the Eskimo and the Indians of western North America, and occurs sometimes in the eastern Woodlands and northern Plains.143 Although Osgood reports 139 de Laguna, 1934, p. 155; cf.however, PL 19,4, p. 57f., from Kachemak Bay HI (and II ?) which is somewhat similar. 140 Koppert, 1930, pp. 8, 38; Olson, 1936, p. 78 (also with blades of bone or antler). 141 Niblack, 1890, Fig. 78; Emmons, 1923, p. 28. 142 Morice, 1894, p. 47, Fig. 10. 143 Birket-Smith, 1929, H, Tables A 90 and B 59; de Laguna, 1934, p. 199; Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, p. 409.</page><page sequence="176">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 169 only the wooden wedge from the Crow River Kutchin,144 the bone wedge was used by the Carrier and by the Tanaina.145 Birket-Smith146 has ascribed the wedge to the Ice-hunting horizon, and the justice of this conclusion has been supported archaeologically by the occur rence of the bone wedge in the Ipiutak, Old Bering Sea, Punuk, Birnirk, Kachemak Bay I, and Dorset Eskimo cultures.147 The bone wedge has been found in sites in Kamchatka and on the Kuriles.148 Bone "chisels" have been re ported from the Neolithic of Siberia and Man churia,149 and "bone axes" from prehistoric Manchuria, Hokkaido, Sakhalin and the Ku riles, but not from Japan, Korea, or Mongolia. The latter are probably bone wedges, although the specimens figured show little evidence of battering at the butt.150 One of the Tena specimens may have been a bark-stripping wedge (PL XVI, 25). Such implements were used by the Kachemak Bay Eskimo, at least during the Third Period, by the Chugach, Eyak, Tanaina, Kutchin, Car rier, Haida (of stone), and by the Salish.151 The curved bone "chisel or knife," shaped like a wedge, is a type known archaeologically from the southern California coast, but we do not know how it was used.152 In addition to wedges, other types were used on the Northwest Coast for removing bark, and the prevalent form in the interior Plateaus is a simple knife-like im plement.153 Although Nelson has illustrated from the lower Yukon Eskimo a slender curved 144 Osgood, 1936, p. 75. 145 Morice, 1894, p. 47; Osgood, 1937, p. 104. 146 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, pp. 200, 208. 147 Ipiutak (Rainey, 1941 b, p. 369 note 8), Old Bering Sea and Punuk (Collins, 1937 a, PL 47, 8, 9, p. 235), Birnirk (U of PM 29-90-169 and 337), Kachemak Bay I, (de Laguna, 1934, pp. 100 f.), Dorset (NMC IX-C-205, 2683, IX-B-233, etc.). 148 de Laguna, 1934, p. 199; Baba, 1936, PL Vn, 3; Torii, 1919-1921, p. 200. 149 Jochelson, 1928, p. 31; Torii, 1913-1915, Fig. 20, 38. 160 Op. tit., p. 29, Fig. 20,43-50, PL XIII. 151 Kachemak Bay (de Laguna, 1934, PL 46,1), Chugach and Eyak (Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, pp. 409 f.), Tanaina (de Laguna, 1934, PL 56, 20; Osgood, 1937, p. 104), Kutchin (Osgood, 1936, p. 61), Carrier (Morice, 1894, p. 76, Fig. 64), Haida (Niblack, 1890, PL XX, 79 a), Salish (USNM 209700 from Salt Spring Island, B.

It is also similar to the dagger from Anvik Point (PL XV, 31). Osgood has definitely reported that knife-like bark peelers were used by the lower Tena. We have already mentioned bark knives from the interior Plateaus of the American Northwest. They are also known from the Quinault, Klamath, Yukaghir, and Ainu.156 The Koryak used a bone ax, which Jochelson thinks was copied from imported iron axes.157 Presumably the original tool was an adz. I am not able to offer any suggestions as to the relationship between the knife and wedge as bark-stripping tools. The latter, and per haps the former also, belongs to the Snowshoe hunting stage of culture.158 They may have developed coordinately from whichever imple ment, knife or wedge, was most frequently used for working wood. DRILLS The Tena bow drills had mouthpieces of stone, caribou astragalus, or of wood with a stone inset. They were used for making holes or for producing fire. The wooden drill shaft was equipped with a bit made of bone, of ani mal tooth, or of chipped or polished stone. The Tena also had the cord drill. The bow drill is almost universal among the Eskimo, being used by all modern tribes, and known archaeo logically (through the evidence of drill points, mouthpieces, and evenly drilled holes) from all ancient cultures except the Dorset.159 In this oldest Canadian culture the bow drill is con spicuous by its absence, and all holes were 164 E.

The cord and bow drills are among the older links between the Old Bering Sea, Thule, and Kachemak Bay I cultures and the Northwest Coast.162 Outside of the Eskimo area, the bow drill is known from the Crow River Kutchin, where Osgood regards it as a recent loan from the Eskimo;163 other Kutchin groups use a cord drill for making fire;164 and the Peel River Kutchin have the pump drill, which is cer tainly a much more recent importation from Siberia.165 The Carrier used a bow drill,166 the Tanaina also had the bow drill for fire-mak ing,167 but for drilling holes they used a cord drill.168 The Tahltan also used a bow drill for making fire.169 For making fire, the Eyak used a cord drill and, in modern times, for making holes, a pump drill.170 The bow drill for holes was also used on the Northwest Coast, being reported from the Haida and Quinault, for ex ample.171 I have already mentioned, in a pre vious study, the chipped stone drill points found by Smith at Lytton.172 It is, of course, impossible to deduce from these alone whether the Interior Salish used a bow or cord drill or only the hand drill in prehistoric times. He did not find drill points on the coast. We may conclude from this distribution that the bow drill and also the cord drill are elements foreign to northern Athabaskan culture, and their presence among the tribes cited can be explained by fairly recent borrowing, either di rect, or indirect, from their Eskimo neighbors. 160 Jenness, 1925, p. 435. 161 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, p. 110. 162 Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, pp. 413, 520. 163 Osgood, 1936, p. 75. 164 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, Table B47, p. 351. 165 Osgood, 1936, p. 70.

The development of the various types of mouth piece for the drill among the Tena shows that the bow (or cord) drill was well established at the time of white contact, and the Tena may have been among the first of the interior Atha baskan tribes to acquire this tool. I have already discussed the archaeological distribution of stone and bone drill points,173 so I need only mention now that both types are known from the Old Bering Sea culture.174 The distribution of the mouthpiece or top rest for the drill may, however, be of some interest. In the Old Bering Sea culture there were both rests that were held in the hand and mouth pieces to be gripped in the teeth, but it was not until the Punuk and Thule cultures developed that we find mouthpieces with a prominent ledge for the teeth, like that on the Tena speci men (PL XIV, 10), established as the more common type.175 The Punuk specimens are all (?) of ivory. Mouthpieces of caribou astragalus are known from the Birnirk and Thule cultures, and from a recent archaeological site in the Mackenzie Delta, but it is uncertain whether the choice of this material is significant.176 The caribou astragalus is also used by the Chukchee, but as a rest to be held in the hand, not as a mouthpiece.177 As far as I know, the mouth piece for drill is lacking in southwestern Alaska. In Prince William Sound, hand rests of bear mandible or blocks of whale bone were used, and pieces of bone and antler were probably used in the Kachemak Bay culture also.1781 am indebted to Mr. Allan May of Wenatchie, Washington, for identifying the Prince William Sound bear mandibles as drill rests. He owns a similar specimen from Umnak Island in the Aleutians, made of sea-lion jaw. Drill rests made entirely of stone, as was that reported from Kalland on the Yukon, are known from the Eskimo of the lower Yukon and Nunivak Island, from the Aleut and the Koryak, from a site in northern Kamchatka, 173 Ibid. 174 Collins, 1937 a, PL 41, 1-4, PL 48, 1-4. 175 Collins, 1937 a, p. 162, PL 82, 37-40, p. 236; Mathias sen, 1927,1, PL 22,14.

Bone hand rests were used by the Kurilian Ainu.180 Stone insets for the mouthpiece (like PL XIV, 9) are known from the Eskimo of the lower Yukon, Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Nor ton Sound, Diomede Island, and Kotzebue Sound.181 It is thus a fairly localized type, and the center of its development seems to lie in Norton Sound. The adaptation of the drill rest so that it can be held in the teeth, leaving both hands free, is an invention that is characteristic of the northern Alaskan Eskimo, and was carried by the Thule culture to Canada and Greenland along with the bow drill. The Tena are among the very few non-Eskimo groups to have bene fited by it. The drill rest of stone to be held in the hands is characteristically Asiatic, and evi dently did not spread among the Eskimo with the bow drill, but is restricted to the Aleut and the Eskimo of the Yukon delta region. The same form in bone is restricted to southwestern Alaska, as far as the Eskimo are concerned. We may suppose that the hand rest is either the older and more primitive form which has sur vived in the southern periphery of the Alaskan Eskimo area, or that it was introduced from Asia, via the Aleutian Islands. The latter hypothesis may hold true of the stone rest, in any case. While stone cannot be held comfort ably in the teeth it is an excellent material of which to make the pit in which the top of the drill revolves. In the Kuskokwim-Norton Sound region the advantages of the wood or bone mouthpiece have been retained, and the advantages of the stone have been added by using a stone inset. We may infer that this specialized type of mouthpiece used by the Yukon Indians and Eskimo is a recent develop ment. CHIPPED STONE Chipped stone artifacts are relatively scarce in the Tena sites and in the supposedly Eskimo sites which we visited on the Yukon. Pecking, 179 E. W.

I have already explained (page 124) that I could not be sure whether the two specimens from Bonasila and Fox Creek (PL XIV, 5, 6) should be considered as lamellar flakes com parable to those from Epipaleolithic and early Neolithic sites in Mongolia and to the undated specimens from Fairbanks. It may be interest ing, however, to consider the distribution of this type. These small flakes and the prepared cores from which they were struck (Rainey identifies the cores as fragments of broken knives or scrapers), are very common at the Fairbanks site. Thus, out of 500 specimens found in 1936, there were thirty-one flakes and three cores, and in 1934-1935, thirty-one cores were found.182 At the prehistoric site of Dixthada on the upper Tanana, Rainey also found out of some 500 specimens, "two small polyhedral cores and six small prismatic flakes derived from such cores."183 He points out that these specimens are of the same type as those found at Fairbanks, yet feels that the difference in numbers, as well as the differences in cultural content between the two sites, indicate two different cultural complexes, the Dixthada site being typical of the interior Athabaskan cul ture, while the University site at Fairbanks and a few others?Mr. Yeigh's place above Good paster River, a site on the Chena River above Fairbanks, both in the Tanana Valley, and pos sibly a site on the Yukon below Rampart Rapids?are "deposits which are not definitely recent Athabascan and may be older."184 As artifacts distinguishing the two complexes, he lists for the Campus site: "semi-lunar side scrapers retouched on one face only, the cleav ers, and the small elliptical blades regularly flaked on both surfaces"; and for the Athabas kan sites: bone, horn and copper specimens. These small flakes are known from Eskimo sites, also. While Collins does not illustrate any from the Old Bering Sea culture, he informs me that he found a few lamellar flakes in the St. Lawrence Island middens of that age. I should imagine that they served to cut the fine slots for the socket lashings on harpoon heads. Tiny lamellar flakes are a type charac teristic of the Cape Dorset culture, especially 182 Rainey, 1939, pp. 383, 387, Fig. 8, 1-11 flakes, Fig. 8, 12-14 cores. 183 Op. tit., p. 366, Fig. 5, 6 core, Fig. 5, 7-9 flakes. 184 Op. tit., pp. 388 f.</page><page sequence="179">172 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 in Newfoundland,185 and would have been serviceable as knives or gravers for the fine cutting and carving of the delicate Dorset bone and ivory work. The collections in the National Museum of Canada show that they must have been struck from prepared blade like cores, like those used by the ancient workers at Fairbanks, but fluted cores resulting from the manufacture of the blades have not been found. The Dorset Eskimo seem to have broken the entire core into small flakes. Lamel lar flakes and prismatic fluted cores have been found in great numbers at a site in Disco Bay, West Greenland,186 and were probably, like so many West Greenland stone types, derived from the Canadian Dorset culture. Such cores have also been found on the Aleutian Islands.187 Of the same type, but larger, are the so-called Flint Ridge chalcedony knives of the Ohio Hopewell culture, which Ritchie has proved were introduced into the Point Peninsula focus of the Vine Valley aspect in New York.188 Drill points or engraving tools made of tiny lamellar flakes have been found on the Channel Islands in southern California.189 Nelson mentions fluted cores for similar flakes from Mexico, Montana, and Oregon.190 It is doubtful, how ever, whether any of these widely scattered examples in North America are directly related to the Eskimo and interior Alaskan examples. Aside from the ancient specimens reported by Nelson from Mongolia, we can cite other Asiatic examples. At Kavran, in northern Kamchatka, Jochelson found fluted flint cores for such tiny flakes associated with Japanese porcelain and iron.191 Torii published, as "razors," slightly larger lamellar flakes from northern Mongolia, some with pointed ends, others with broad sharp ends, and notes that they have been found in Russian and Chinese Turkestan, northern Korea, northern Honshu, and Hokkaido.192 We have, therefore, an al most continuous distribution from Turkestan and Mongolia to central Alaska. 186 Cape Dorset (NMC LX-C-1076, etc.), Coats and Man sel Islands in Hudson Bay (IX-C-427, etc.), Nuvuk Island near northwest Labrador Coast (IX-B-329, etc.), New foundland (Wintemberg, 1939-1940, I, PL VI-2, 1-3). 186 Solberg, 1907, pp. 38 f., Fig. 13 flakes, Fig. 14 core. 187 N.

While the manufacture of blades is a develop ment typical of the Upper Paleolithic in Europe, the manufacture of such small blades might with justice be referred to a Microlithic or Mesolithic horizon. There is no reason for sup posing, however, that these tiny lamellar flakes are much older in the New World than the Birth of Christ, to judge by the Eskimo evi dence, and since they have lasted down until modern times in Kamchatka and in Labrador, their presence at Fairbanks and Dixthada can tell us nothing of the age of these sites. Even if we disregard the flakes from Bonasila and Fox Creek, since they are not very similar to the Fairbanks specimens, other recent Tena types have been found at Fairbanks: end scrapers, arrowhead with simple tang and side notches, ulo-shaped stone scraper, and whetstone.193 The side scrapers,194 which seem to be comparable to those of the Old Bering Sea195 and Dorset cultures,196 are the only clearly defined type which argue a greater age. It is also significant, that aside from the whetstone, all of the arti facts from the Fairbanks site are of chipped stone. As both Collins and I have pointed out,197 a greater abundance of chipped stone as com pared with polished stone is characteristic of all the older Eskimo cultures: Old Bering Sea, Ipiutak, Kachemak Bay I, older levels of Hrdlicka's site on Kodiak Island, and the Dor set. In this respect, as well as in respect to the particular forms of the stone artifacts, the Fairbanks site has yielded an old-fashioned culture as compared with that from Dixthada or with that which I found on the Yukon. Whether the Fairbanks site is actually con temporaneous with the older stages of Eskimo culture, or whether it simply represents a back ward culture cannot be ascertained yet. There is nothing in the geological features of the loca tion to give us a clue. We might, however, con sider that the scarcity of bone remains?Nelson reports only three out of 800 specimens he examined?198 was due to the disintegration of 193 N. C.

Even this evi dence is not conclusive, since the cultural de posit is only 30 centimeters deep199 and the con tents have been subjected to the disintegrating effects of annual freezing and thawing. We may consider the two arrowheads (PL XIV, 1, 2) as representing a single type: the leaf-shaped blade with tang. This type was common in the Old Bering Sea culture, but was not found in the Punuk, or at least was very poorly represented, since this culture had very little chipped stone;200 it was abundant in the Dorset,201 just barely present in the Canadian Thule,202 is known in the Birnirk and in more recent periods at Point Barrow;203 it occurs in ethnological collections from Kotzebue and Norton Sounds,204 and in archaeological collec tions from Port Moller on the Alaska Penin sula, and the Aleutian Islands.205 Morice figures a specimen from the Carrier206 that is almost identical with our Plate XIV, 1, from Bonasila. Rainey found specimens of the same type at Dixthada on the upper Tanana, and at Birch Creek in Kutchin country on the middle Yukon.207 He also publishes two specimens from the placer mines near Fairbanks, sup posedly found in Pleistocene muck, but actually of uncertain age.208 Nelson reports one arrow head with simple stem from the University site at Fairbanks.209 Blades of this sort were made by the Interior and Coast Salish.210 The type was not found in Kachemak Bay, though some of the leaf-shaped blades with rounded base are narrowed as if to suggest an incipient tang, and it was not found in Prince William Sound where chipped stone is practically absent. On the Asiatic side, we know it from the Chukchee and the East Cape Eskimo,211 the Koryak,212 199 Rainey, 1939, p. 382. 200 Collins, 1937 a, PL 40, pp. 148, 232. 201 Jenness, 1925, Fig. Al. 202 Mathiassen, 1927, I, PL 7, 16. 203 Cf.

Schnell specifies that it is most common in Hokkaido, becoming less common as one goes south in Honshu, until it disappears in Kyushu.214 This would establish it as an Ainu type. In view of this wide distribution, it is not sur prising that the Tena made the leaf-shaped blade with tang, even though most of the ex amples I have cited are for knives, spears or lances, whereas the two Yukon specimens are probably for arrows. If our specimens had been better made and exhibited the pattern more clearly, it would have been profitable to con sider such features as the shape of the tang, proportions of the blade, and the presence or absence of notches. Side-notched blades are uni formly absent from the Eskimo with the excep tion of the Dorset and prehistoric Aleut.215 Jenness has drawn attention to the striking similarities between the side-notched blades of these two peoples, and comparisons could also be made with some of the prehistoric Ainu types. These considerations have led me to suggest that such artifacts may belong to an ancient North Pacific-Dorset continuum.216 The leaf shaped flake from the Old Fish Camp (PL XIV, 3) is very similar to specimens from the Carrier,217 and Rainey has published flakes of the same type from Dixthada on the upper Tanana, from Rampart Rapids ("side scrapers"), and from the site at the University near Fairbanks.218 Such flakes are so little spe * cialized and are of such wide occurrence that we need not pursue their distribution. The chipped end scraper and the ulo-shaped scraper will be discussed in the section on scrapers. DOUBLE-EDGED SLATE BLADES Ground and polished slate was used much more extensively for making knives and weapon blades than was chipped hard stone, and in this respect Tena culture resembles recent prehis toric Eskimo cultures. 213 Baba, 1934, Fig. 8, 2, 15; 1936, PL I, 11, 12, 23, 26. 214 Kanda, 1884, PL III, 5; Schnell, 1932, pp. 32 f. 216 Jenness, 1935, Fig. 4 e, h, i, k; Jochelson, 1925, PL 15, 23, etc. Cf. de Laguna, 1934, PL 30, 36 (Kachemak Bay II or sub-Ill). 216 Jenness, 1940, p. 8; Akabori, 1932, Fig. on p. 297, map on p. 299; de Laguna, 1946. 217 Morice, 1894, Figs. 18, 19. 218 Rainey, 1939, Fig. 5, 5, Fig. 6, 3, 4, Fig. 7,1, 2.</page><page sequence="181">174 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 The leaf-shaped slate blade with tang (Pis. XIV, 11; XXVI, 36) is a common Eskimo and Coast Salish type. It dates back to the Old Bering Sea and Dorset cultures, but was lack ing from the Ipiutak, which had no slate blades of any type. It was not found in Kachemak Bay before period sub-Ill.219 I believe that it was the original form from which double-edged slate blades without tangs developed. It has a wide distribution outside of present Eskimo territory, being found at Dorset sites in New foundland.220 The common Eskimo form is lenticulate in cross section, but it is sometimes facetted to produce a flat diamond-shaped section. Some of the Dorset forms become rather long and slender.221 The form with tang and lenticular cross section was taken over by the Indians of the Northeast and is found at Tadoussac, Quebec, and in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Ontario, Vermont, classic and shell heap Red Paint sites in Maine, and at various sites in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New York.222 The form with flat broad hexagonal section, a close relative, is found in Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario, Maine, New Hampshire, and New York.223 The variant with flat diamond cross section has practically the same distribu tion.224 The slender form with rather thick diamond-shaped cross section is found in Quebec, classic and shell heap Red Paint sites, 219 de Laguna, 1934, pp. 71, 182 f.; Collins, 1937 a, PL 39, 6-13; Rowley, 1940, Fig. 2 k; NMC specimens from Dorset sites. 220 Howley, 1915, PL XIX, 1-5; Wintemberg, 1939-1940, PL XVI-1, 12. 221 Howley, 1915, PL XIX, 8; NMC DC-B-56. 222 Tadoussac, Quebec (NMC VIII-E-160); Nova Scotia and New Brunswick (NMC files); Ontario (NMC VII-F 9082, 5128, 15232; ROMA HD.31288); Vermont (Wil loughby, 1935, Fig. 32 c); Maine (Willoughby, 1935, Fig. 33 b,f, g; W.

These are (1) the awl-like forms char acteristic of Tadoussac in Quebec,227 (2) the bayonet types with asymmetric diamond or triangular cross section, characteristic of On tario and New York (probably Laurentian),228 and (3) the long facetted ribbon-like blades typical of Red Paint sites.229 The distribution of these various specialized forms suggests two routes of diffusion into the Northeast, one via the St. Lawrence and the inland waterways, associated primarily with the Brewer ton and Vergennes foci of the Laurentian, the other along the coast, associated with the Red Paint culture. Some of these specimens were doubt less used as knives, but the majority, I suspect, were for lancing fish and aquatic mammals. For many of the finds, we have information about the cultural context, and all of these may be assigned to the Tadoussac, Laurentian and Red Paint cultures. Unlike the slate ulo (see pp. 182-186) these blades have not been dif fused beyond the home territories of these re lated cultures. However, double-edged blades made of native copper, exactly like the leaf shaped forms with tang usually made of slate, are represented in the Perkins collection from Wisconsin, now in the United States National Museum. I do not know how these should be related to the duplicates in slate. Information from Siberia is scanty about this type of blade. Bogoras figures a slate blade with a broken base from a Siberian Eskimo site, and writes: "The double-edged knife of the usual Eskimo form does not exist at present in northern Asia,"230 by which he seems to imply that it formerly did.

In the Shang and Chou periods in China, large slate and jade daggers or knives, with a hole in the tang for attachment of a cross piece, were used for ceremonial pur poses.235 They seem to be copies of bronze swords and daggers, and these in turn were probably copied from stone prototypes of the Neolithic. From the Yang Shao Neolithic of China there are smaller double-edged slate blades for lances and arrows, and the same type also occurs in French Indo-China.236 The various specimens mentioned above vary tremendously in size, and were used for arrows, lances, spears, knives and daggers, but since they all exhibit the same fundamental pattern, I believe it justifiable to consider them as manifestations of one type. The flat double-edged slate blade with almost parallel straight sides, usually lacking a tang (PL XIV, 16) I have called the Halibut Cove type, after a Kachemak Bay III site which yielded a number of these blades. The type dates back to the Second Period in that area. It is also found in Prince William Sound,237 was made by the Coast and Interior Salish, and is even known in northern California.238 If my interpretation of a broken specimen is correct, it was represented in the Old Bering Sea cul ture.239 It has also been reported from Man churia.240 However, I do not think that blades of this shape constitute a well defined type. They are, rather, individual variants of the tangless leaf-shaped type which have become 231 Torii, 1913-1914, Fig. 35, p. 44, and note 30. 232 Torii, 1913-1915, PL XI and Fig. 10; Egami, Komai and Seichi, 1934, Fig. 3. 233 Ohyama, 1926, p. 214, Figs. 2, 7, 9; Holmes, 1919, Fig. 14; Torii, 1913-1914, p. 44 note 30. 234 Kanda, 1884, PL XXIII, 4-6. 235 Specimens in ROMA. 238 Andersson, 1923, PL VI, 8-10; Haguenauer, 1931.

Most of the tangless slate blades of the Northeastern Indians ("bayo nets") were strongly facetted to produce dia mond or triangular cross sections and these are also variants, coordinate with, though independent of, the Alaskan Halibut Cove type. As suggested above, they have probably evolved from the Dorset form found in New foundland.241 It will be remembered that a fragment of a slate blade with a barb was found at Hall's Rapids on the lower Yukon (not illustrated). I have already discussed the distribution of barbed slate blades, and have pointed out that they seem to be particularly characteristic of southwestern Alaska (Kachemak Bay II and III), as distinguished from other Eskimo cul tures, and that they are distributed from the Coast Salish to Norton Sound with the possible exception of the Aleutian Islands.2421 was wrong in saying that they are never found north of Bering Strait since a few specimens with one or two barbs have been found at the Mackenzie Delta 243 and at Cape Smythe near Point Bar row,244 but here they are neither very common nor very old. Even in the Kuskokwim-Yukon delta region they cannot have been common since Nelson writes of one as being "curiously formed."245 Barbed lance and arrow blades have prac tically the same distribution in the northeast ern provinces and states as do slate blades with tang though the shapes fall into several classes, as I have already mentioned, some being characteristic of inland sites, others, of the Red Paint culture on the coast of Maine. To my knowledge, none has been found in any eastern Arctic site, though they may belong to the southern Dorset culture, since Nielson pub lishes one from Newfoundland or Labrador? the provenience is uncertain?246 and Howley pictures some barbed forms from Newfound 241 Howley, 1915, PL XIX, 6-9. 242 de Laguna, 1934, p. 183. 243 Mathiassen, 1930 a, PL 3, 6, p. 11.

They represent the Dorset tanged slate blade modified by the addi tion of barbs, probably under the influence of the Indian chipped blades with barbs. The eastern and the western barbed slate blades should, therefore, be considered as parallel developments from a common unbarbed proto type. On the Asiatic side, barbed slate blades are known from Korea, Manchuria, and Japan.250 They are not found in the Kuriles, Kamchatka, or the western Aleutian Islands. Because of this gap in distribution, we should probably regard the Alaskan and Asiatic forms as parallel developments. Barbed slate blades are also known from the Arctic Stone Age of Scandinavia.251 Triangular slate blades with grooved sur faces and concave base (Pis. XIV, 12-14; XXVI, 38-41) are the most common type of slate weapon blade found at Tena and "Eskimo" sites on the Yukon. They were used for arrows primarily, and sometimes apparently for larger weapons (lances? harpoons?), being hafted in a slit in the bone head or in the wooden shaft. This is one of the specialized forms which the triangular slate blade of the Eskimo has as sumed. The generalized form, ungrooved and with a straight base, is represented by a single specimen from Kachemak Bay III, but from the Yukon it is distributed north and east to Canada, Newfoundland, and Greenland.252 The type is lacking in the Old Bering Sea and Punuk cultures, where its place is taken by the leaf shaped blade with tang.253 It is well represented, however, in the Birnirk,254 from which we must 247 Howley, 1915, PL XXI, 50, 51. 248 PMH 80483. 249 Howley, 1915, Sketch VIII. ^Ohyama, 1926, p. 214, Fig. 1; Torii, 1913-1915, Fig. 10, PL XI; Holmes, 1919, Fig. 13. 251 Clark, 1936, Fig. 25, 1-3, from near Bergen, Norway. 252 de Laguna, 1934, p. 183; Mathiassen, 1927, II, pp. 38 f.; Howley, 1915, PL XXI, 65. 263 Collins, 1937 a, p. 337. 254 J.

Triangular slate blades have been found at Canadian Dorset sites that also yielded har poon heads with slits to hold such blades,255 and since triangular slate blades are also known from Newfoundland, we can consider them a Dorset type, although there is little to distin guish Dorset from Thule specimens. These triangular blades exhibit a number of variations, the distribution of which is shown in the following table. To the Eskimo examples I have added specimens from the Northwest and from Asia.

The flat or facetted surface seems to be found everywhere that the triangular blade occurs, but the grooved surface is limited to the Cana dian and Newfoundland Dorset, West and East Greenland, Birnirk culture, protohistoric and modern Mackenzie Delta and northern Alaska, the lower Yukon, Kodiak Island, Coast Salish, and Neolithic of Manchuria. While the particular combination of grooved surface and concave base, which is so charac teristic of the lower Yukon, is reported only from West Greenland (in bone), the Newfound land Dorset, the protohistoric Mackenzie Delta, the Coast Salish, and Neolithic of Manchuria, still it would appear that blades of this type have resulted only from the almost accidental combination of the two unrelated features (con cave base and groove), and are therefore likely to appear wherever these two features occur independently. Three rather specialized devices have been used by the Eskimo for attaching these tri angular blades securely to arrow or harpoon heads. The groove in the blade is one of these, for when the blade is thrust into the slit the groove prevents it from turning. The second method is characteristically Alaskan, and is used with both flat and with grooved blades. This is to carve the slit in the harpoon head in such a way that the two halves of the slit bone had to be forced apart when the blade was in serted and so that they spring together to grip the blade. This is done by cutting the base of the slot or blade slit to the full width of the blade; the outer end at the point is barely cut through so that the two halves of the harpoon head at the point almost touch each other before the blade is inserted. This type of blade slit is found on Old Bering Sea, Birnirk, and Punuk heads, and on the late Punuk heads which have survived into modern times on St. Lawrence Island.256 This method of making blade slits is not found in southern Alaska or in the Dorset and Thule cultures. The only harpoon head with this type of socket known 266 For clear examples see: Old Bering Sea (Collins, 1937 a, PL 23,10), Birnirk (J. A. Mason, 1930, PL V, 6), Punuk (Collins, 1937 a, PL 28, 13; PL 70, 11) Late Punuk (Geist and Rainey, 1936, PL 67, 4), old-fashioned modern form (op. cit., PL 17 C, especially the fifth).</page><page sequence="185">178 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 from Canada is one which had obviously been traded from Alaska. It is of Collins' open socket Punuk Type III(a)x, and was found at Maxwell Bay, Devon Island, at a site which yielded Dorset, Thule and modern material.257 The third method of attaching these triangu lar blades securely is by means of a lashing or a peg, run through holes in the blade and head. While we did not find any blades with such holes, they were reported by Osgood from the Ingalik for both arrows and harpoon heads. Col lins has pointed out that holes for pegging are found in Alaska only with modern iron-bladed harpoon heads, and he argues that since pegged on blades are well developed in the Canadian Thule culture, their appearance in Alaska must be due to the westward return of the Thule cul ture in recent times.258 Cut holes for a lashing are found on a number of Dorset heads,259 and in Newfoundland Dorset sites a number of cut slate blades have been found. These are slender leaf-shaped blades, rather than triangular, and have one hole, or two holes side by side or one above the other.260 Triangular slate blades with one or more holes, probably designed for peg ging, are represented by one of the two speci mens cited from Kachemak Bay III,261 and the specimens listed above from West Green land, Japan and Formosa, and some of the slate and jade blades from the Shang Bronze Age in China. The Tlingit and Chukchee blades of metal also have holes for rivets. The use of holes is thus almost as widely distributed as the triangular blade itself. The hole for lashing, however, would appear to be more primitive, and must have been earlier than the hole for pegging. Riveting or pegging the blade in was probably developed independently only in areas where metal was known. In the Thule culture this metal was probably native copper, knowledge of which was acquired during the movement from Alaska to Canada through the present Copper Eskimo territory. The technique of riveting, in default of sufficient metal, was readily translated into pegging, and a prior knowledge of pegging on bone edgings (see pp. 215-216 of this Chapter) may 257 NMC IX-C-2813. 258 Collins, 1937 a, pp. 309 f. 259 Cape Dorset (NMC IX-C-233), Devon Island (IX-C 2692), Coats and Mansel Islands (IX-C-441, 254, 1147, 1151), King William Land (Mathiassen, 1927,1, PL 82, 3). 280 Patterson, 1891, PL X, /, 2; Howley, 1915, PL XIX, 14; Wintemberg, 1939-1940, PL XVI-1, 11). 261 de Laguna, 1934, PL 32,1, with one hole, p. 183. also have contributed to the development of the Thule use of pegging for harpoon blades. We may tentatively reconstruct the develop ment of the slate harpoon and arrow blade as follows: The original form was probably a small leaf-shaped blade with tang. This was the type which survived into the Old Bering Sea and Punuk cultures. It was probably, at first, set into a plain slit or lashed onto a bed at the end of the weapon head. The use of the bed for the blade is known from the Canadian Dorset and from Kachemak Bay. Later, the blade lost its tang, becoming the widely known triangular type. A variant form, of wide distribution also, is the triangular blade with groove, to prevent it from turning in the slit. The blade added holes for lashing, and these are known espe cially from the Dorset culture. We do not know whether lashing holes were ever used on St. Lawrence Island. If they were not, we must consider the development of holes in south western Alaska and in Asia to have been inde pendent of the development of holes in the Dorset and Thule cultures. If once used, holes must have gone out of fashion soon in north ern Alaska, because the invention of the spring slit for holding the blade rendered them super fluous. It must be pointed out also that the spring slit is as old as the oldest slate blades in northern Alaska and that it was used in the Old Bering Sea and Punuk cultures to hold blades with tang, not triangular blades. Only the Birnirk culture made use of triangular slate blades at this time. In Asia, some time between the Yang Shao Neolithic and the Shang Bronze Age, the triangular blade was equipped with holes for pegging or riveting. We may ascribe this development here to the knowledge of metal working, but we do not know yet whether there was an intermediate stage in which the blade was sewed on through holes. In Canada, holes for pegging were also developed in the Thule culture. These Thule Eskimo would have brought with them from northern Alaska the Birnirk trait of pegging on shovel edging, they probably also had some knowledge of riveting native copper, and whether or not they brought from northern Alaska slate blades with holes for lashing, they must have seen blades of this sort in the hands of the Dorset Eskimo. All of these elements combined to produce the triangular blade with holes for pegging which the Thule Eskimo car ried into Greenland and later brought back to Alaska. It will be interesting to see whether</page><page sequence="186">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 179 future excavation in northern Alaska will re veal any triangular blades with holes for lashing prior to, and perhaps competing with, the in vention of the spring socket. The slate blades from the lower Yukon are thus seen as rather old-fashioned, since they make use only of the grooved surface, and lack holes and the spring slit. The single-edge slate blade found on the Yu kon is obviously a knife blade and is therefore discussed in the following section on knives and ulos. KNIVES AND ULOS Single-edged slate blades for knives (PL XIV, 17) are a common Eskimo type, distributed from southern Alaska to the east coast of Greenland, with the exception of the Alaska Peninsula and the Aleutian Islands.262 They should have been found in Kachemak Bay be fore the Third Period since they belong to the Old Bering Sea, Birnirk, and Canadian Thule cultures.263 Judging by the finds of single edged slate knife blades in Ontario, Quebec, Maine, New Hampshire, and New York,264 we can assume that the type belonged to the Dor set culture, although it has not as yet been found at a Dorset site. From Japan there are large specimens with curving blade and handle made of a single piece of stone, and from Hokkaido there is a smaller specimen of polished jasper (?).265 In the Shang and Chou Bronze Ages, large jade knives of this type were used for ceremonial purposes, which would argue a great antiquity in China for the utilitarian prototype.266 The Tena undoubtedly copied this type of knife from their Eskimo neighbors. A single edged slate knife blade and a bone handle with end socket to fit it were found in one of the placer mines near Fairbanks.267 It is certainly Eskimo, and is probably not very ancient, 262 Mathiassen, 1927, II, pp. 73 f.; de Laguna, 1934, p. 183. 263 Old Bering Sea (Collins, 1937 a, PL 38, 2, 3), Birnirk (U of PM 29-90-630), Thule (Mathiassen, 1927, I, PL 19, 7 8) ,J?4 Ontario (RMAS AR 7.2.09/20779), Quebec (NMC VIII-E-387), Red Paint culture, Maine (PA 51132; Wil loughby, 1935, Fig. 35 b), New Hampshire (Willoughby, 1935, Fig. 35 c). 286 Kanda, 1884, Pis.

It is a good illustration, however, of how far up the Yukon such Eskimo types have been traded or copied. A crude knife handle like that from Bonasila (PL XIV, 43), being little more than a naturally hollow bone cut to hold an end blade, was found in a Third Period site in Kachemak Bay.268 The other knife handles from the Yukon all have a blade slit in one edge at the end, and of these the most interesting is the curved handle with a blade slit at each end, found at the Old Fish Camp (PL XIV, 44). While the handle itself is curved, the blades, presumably of stone, were straight. This specimen suggests the crooked knife, but it must be considered only as a prototype, since the true crooked knife has a curved blade, and seems to have de veloped only with the use of metal in modern times. Of course, the Tena probably had some access through trade to native copper, but it seems unlikely that they made crooked blades of this material, for even at Dixthada on the upper Tanana where copper tools were abun dant, there were no copper knife blades, straight or crooked. The material was probably too soft to be any good for a whittling or carving knife. The large wooden handle of Old Bering Sea "Type III" with a blade slit in the edge at one end,269 and the very small bone knife handle (or possibly bone socket piece for a wooden knife handle) of the Dorset culture270 illustrate two variants of the original type with straight handle and side blade from which the crooked knife was ultimately derived. The knife with long and usually slightly curved handle and straight side blade, which Collins and Mathias sen recognize as the true prototype of the modern crooked knife, does not appear until the Punuk and Thule cultures,271 unless a knife handle, curved at the butt end and furnished with a "long slot for flint blade," from Ipiu tak,272 is actually of this type. More recent ex amples of the Punuk-Thule type have been found in protohistoric and modern sites on St. 268 de Laguna, 1934, PL 46, 11. 269 Collins, 1937 a, PL 38,3,4. 270 Jenness, 1925, Fig. 7 a, b, c; Rowley, 1940, Fig. 1 e. 271 Collins, 1937 a, PL 78,1-3, p. 333; Mathiassen, 1927,1, PL 18, 2-4, II, p. 70. 272 Rainey, 1941 b, PL III, 6 and legend.</page><page sequence="187">180 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 Lawrence Island, and at Point Barrow and Barter Island.273 The Tena specimens resemble the earlier Eskimo forms with inserted blade much more closely than they do the modern Eskimo crooked knife with curved flattened handles, onto which the curved metal blade is riveted, not set into a socket.274 Knife handles with a blade slit in the edge at the end are not lacking from Asia. A remark ably Dorset-like specimen was found at Palan on the west coast of Kamchatka.275 Andersson reports that in the Neolithic Yang Shao stage of Kansu, China, one finds bone knives with a long groove in the edge to hold a row of thin, flint flakes.276 While these resemble the long flensing knives of the Canadian Thule culture, they suggest that the knife with a single side blade, from which they were presumably de rived, must have had a considerable antiquity in China. Mr. Henry B. Collins, Jr., informs me that the latter is known from the Neolithic of Lake Baikal in Siberia.277 We did not find any beaver tooth knives, although the Tena must have used them. It may be that this type of knife, with the blade made from a naturally curved tooth, has had some influence upon the development of the crooked knife. The tooth knife is of universal occurrence among the northern Athabaskans, and is widely distributed on the Plateaus of the Northwest. Except for the Eyak, the modern Northwest Coast tribes seem to have lacked it, although it has been found archaeologically among the Coast Salish.278 Nelson illustrates an Eskimo specimen from the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta with a beaver tooth blade set in a straight handle, and a specimen with a blade at each end from the lower Yukon Eskimo.279 The beaver tooth knife may have been used by the Kodiak Eskimo; a knife blade made of a bear canine was found in Prince William Sound.280 An engraving tool with the point made of a 273 St. Lawrence (Geist and Rainey, 1936, PL 23,5; PL 53, 8, pp. 102, 138, 156), Point Barrow (Mathiassen, 1930 a, PL 10, 7), Barter Island (Mathiassen, 1930 a, p. 25). 274 E.

The tooth knife thus seems to be primarily an Indian implement. In the Northeast, we can trace it back through the Iroquois, the Owasco and Vine Valley aspects, the Northern and New York Coastal, the Lau rentian and Red Paint, to the Archaic.282 From the prehistoric Ainu shell mounds at Omori near Tokyo, Morse publishes an antler handle with a hole at one end to fit a deer incisor blade.283 Collins assigns the crooked knife (more properly its prototype) to the Snowshoe culture stage.284 The modern Tena stiletto for dispatching fish (PL XVIII, 5), with its awl-like bone point hafted to a wooden handle, can be compared with the much larger unhafted bone stilettos of the Prince William Sound Eskimo.285 Among the Eskimo, the stiletto is not found again until we reach the Central and Greenland Eskimo. Because of this distribution, Birket-Smith sug gests that it may be an older implement among them than the dagger or two-edged knife for dispatching game. He mentions archaeological stilettos from the Interior and Coast Salish, from the Florida Keys, and modern stilettos from the Chipewyan, and deplores the "un certainty in archaeological determinations which may well conceal stilettos under such terms as 'large awl,' 'perforator,' etc."286 Now that we know that the points for such weapons may be no larger than ordinary awls, the dif 281 Rainey, 1941 b, PL III, 8. 282 Iroquois (Wintemberg, 1936, pp. 52 f., PL XIV, 6-9; 1931, p. 93); Owasco (Ritchie, 1928, PL IV, 18; 1934, pp. 33 f.); Vine Valley (Ritchie, 1937, Fig. 8, 5); New York Hopewellian (Ritchie, 1938 a, p. 33; 1940 a, PL 2, 41); New England Woodland (Willoughby, 1935, Fig. 124, a-e), Northern Coastal (Smith and Wintemberg, 1929, Pis.

The painted awls from Lamoka, New York, one of which is made of a bear ulna, and is 9\ inches long,287 and some of the larger awls from other Archaic sites, made of mammal leg bones, may well have been stilettos. Large awls or stilettos have been found in Hopewell and Intrusive burials in Ohio mounds, and at the Laurentian-Archaic site on Lake Cayuga, New York.288 The prehistoric Iroquois made stilettos of antler and of bear and human ulnas.289 If archaeological collec tions were carefully examined, I feel sure that we would find additional proof that the stiletto is a very old type. The bone dagger from Anvik (PL XV, 31) resembles very closely the knives of split long bone or carved ivory used by the Eskimo from the Kuskokwim to Kotzebue Sound for groov ing wood to be split,290 and it also resembles some of the bark-stripping knives discussed under "Chisels and Wedges." Birket-Smith has pointed out that the dagger is primarily a west ern element in North America, found among the northern Athabaskans, and tribes of the Northwest Coast and interior Plateau.291 We need discuss, therefore, only some of the stylis tic features of these weapons. Daggers of split leg bone similar to the Tena specimen are known from the Coast Salish.292 Surprisingly enough a specimen very like these has been found in a shell heap near Brooklin, Maine.293 Daggers of carved bone and ivory are, of course, related to these simpler specimens. A dagger with a triangular section (flat on one side, facetted on the other), appears in the Punuk culture;294 (it is lacking in the Old Bering Sea and Birnirk cultures), and lasts on until modern times on St. Lawrence Island, though the modern type seems to have a diamond-shaped section (?).295 The bone dagger is a Canadian Thule type and is known also from rather recent sites in the 287 Ritchie, 1932 a, p. 101, PL Vm, 20. 288 Mills, 1907, Fig. 38, from the Harness Mound; Mills, 1916, Fig. 8, from the Tremper Mound; Ritchie, 1939, PL 1, 31. 289 Wintemberg, 1936, p. 59, Pis.

In any case, they rep resent a totally unrelated type.297 A bone dagger with three facets on each side was found in Kachemak Bay III and a similar dagger, oval in section, was found in Prince William Sound.298 Shaped bone daggers are also known from the Tanaina. A specimen from Tyonek, published by Osgood,299 is clearly a copy of the facetted copper knife made by the Tanaina, Tena, Kutchin, Atna, Eyak, Chugach Eskimo, and Northwest Coast Indians. The Haida also made "bone daggers, flat on one side and convex on the other, which have evidently served as patterns for the iron knives so plentiful in later years."300 The Thompson had similar weap ons.301 Decorated and carefully shaped bone daggers are characteristic of the Point Pen insula culture in New York State.302 As Birket-Smith has pointed out, the early introduction of metal on the Northwest Coast has complicated the history of bone daggers and stilettos.303 We do not know how old native copper daggers are in the Northwest, but even if they prove to be comparatively recent, as I suspect, we still cannot rule out the influence of early Asiatic metal daggers. In fact, in the area under consideration we have two-edged knives or daggers of three materials?bone, polished stone (cf. "Double-edged Slate Blades") and metal?and they have all in fluenced one another to such an extent that it seems impossible to unravel the tangle. Facets may result from the grinding of bone and stone, or from the pounding and grinding of copper, and weapons of all three materials can also be made without facets. We know that "bone daggers" were made in the Siberian Neolithic, but Jochelson does not describe them further.304 296 Mathiassen, 1927, I, PL 13, 15, 18; 1930 a, pp. 13 f., PL 5 9' PL 8 9. 297 Rainey, 1941 b, PL III, 2 (lance head), 4,5 (swords ?). 298 de Laguna, 1934, PL 46,14; Birket-Smith and de La guna, field notes, 1933. 299 Osgood, 1937, PL 11 G. 300 Newcombe, 1907, pp. 135 ff. 301 Teit, 1900, pp. 263, Fig. 246. 302 Ritchie, 1937, p. 191, Fig. 8, /. 303 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, p. 64. 304 Jochelson, 1928, p. 31.

Collins, 1943).</page><page sequence="189">182 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 Both facetted and unfacetted double-edged slate blades were made in the Chinese and Manchurian Neolithic.805 It is thus impossible to say whether the stone and bone knives of the American Northwest are related directly to the Asiatic Neolithic forms, and the Ameri can copper daggers are again copies of the lat ter; or whether the Chinese and Siberian Bronze Age metal weapons had begun to influence the American specimens, just as they influenced the shape of the slate and jade blades made in China during Shang times. We can only be sure that the American copper daggers, stone knives, and shaped bone daggers have influ enced each other, for the similarities between them are too great to be fortuitous. I also sus pect that the American copper daggers, with their characteristic spiral ornamentations at the end of the handle (PL III, 2), are related to the bronze daggers of the Ordos area (north ern China and Inner Mongolia). The latter have blades with either two or three facets on each side, and the handle is frequently deco rated with spiral protuberances, which Anders son interprets as degenerate bird heads.306 Al though these Ordos weapons are of cast bronze, and the spirals turn inward, not outward as on the American copper daggers, the resem blances between them are striking. With the exception of the Alaskan Ipiutak culture, which lacked slate blades of all kinds, and with the possible exception of the Dorset culture, from which we still need more specific information, the ulo or woman's knife with slate blade is known from all Eskimo cultures. It is also found on the Northwest Coast and Plateaus.307 The southernmost examples from the west are a bone ulo-like implement from Santa Barbara and a rectangular slate blade from the Hupa.308 Some of the so-called "slate hoes" of the prehistoric Pueblo and Hohokam peoples are, I believe, ulos and ulo-shaped scrapers. Curiously enough, we have no proof that the Dorset Eskimo possessed the ulo blade of 806 Andersson, 1923, PL VI, 8, 9, 10; Torii, 1913-1915, PL XI and Fig. 10; 1913-1914, Fig. 35. 806 Andersson, 1932, p. 236, PL VI, 1,2. 807 Mathiassen, 1927, II, pp. 84 fl.; Birket-Smith, 1929, II, Tables A 75 and B 50; de Laguna, 1934, p. 184; Birket Smith and de Laguna, 1938, p. 408; Rainey, 1941 b, p. 370. 308 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, p. 195. He also suggests that there may be a connection between the ulo and the South American tumi. Specimens in SWM. ground slate. Such slate blades have been found on northern Dorset sites, but these are sites which also yielded Thule or more recent material, and there is nothing about the blades themselves to distinguish them from Thule or modern Central Eskimo specimens. It is per haps significant that Rowley did not find a trace of an ulo blade at his pure Dorset site near Iglulik.309 It is barely possible, however, that the lack of the ulo on this little island may have had some connection with taboos against women's work during the walrus and fox hunting seasons of the fall and winter when the site seems to have been inhabited.310 Ras mussen has published an impressive list of such taboos from the modern Iglulik Eskimo, and in referring especially to the rules designed to keep separate the time for making caribou skin garments (of necessity implying the use of the ulo) from the walrus hunting season, he remarks: The observance of all taboos at Iglulik was especially nec essary, as it is supposed to be from here that the sea spirit Takanaluk set out before going down to the bottom of the sea.311 Possibly these taboos and the sacred nature of Iglulik were derived from the days of Dorset occupation of the area, but we must not press this hypothesis too far, since there is nothing in the modern rules which forbids the importa tion to Iglulik of ulos or prohibits their use in cutting up meat. The only other Eskimo culture which seems to have lacked the slate ulo blade was the Ipiutak of Point Hope, Alaska. Here, however, chipped flint may have taken the place of ground slate,312 and the same may have been true for the early northern Dorset. Ulo blades of the ordinary Eskimo type with plain, thin back have been found in Newfound land and at the Eskimo site of Bradore, Quebec, on the north shore of the Gulf of St. Law rence.313 These sites may well be later than those of the northern Dorset, and it would not be unreasonable to assume that Dorset culture originally lacked the slate woman's knife and that it was taken over by late Dorset groups from the Thule invaders. We can be sure that 309 Rowley, 1940, p. 493. 310 Op. tit., pp. 491, 496. 311 Rasmussen, 1929, p. 192, cf. pp. 180-196. 312 Rainey, 1941 b, p. 370, PL VI, 13.

In discussing the ulo or semi-lunar knives of the Northeastern Indians we must make a dis tinction between those with plain or thin backs, which are exactly like the Eskimo forms, and those with an abruptly thickened grip or ridged back, which seems to represent the thin blade hafted in a handle like that used for Eskimo ulo blades.314 We can assume that un less this thickened grip is mentioned specifi cally in the literature, the slate blades are plain.

Ulos with plain backs, most of which were probably hafted like Eskimo blades in wooden handles, are thus found in all states and areas from which I was able to get specific informa tion: but they are relatively common in Can ada, Maine, and Vermont, i.e., in the north. Blades with thickened grip which were used without separate handles are relatively com mon in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Con necticut, New York and New Jersey, i.e., far ther south and west, although examples range from Ontario to Pennsylvania. Specimens on which the position of the grip is only indicated may have a truncated diamond cross section to produce a thickening, as is seen on ulos from Ontario and Maine, or the edge of the supposed grip may be indicated by an ornamental groove cut on both sides, as on examples from New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey. Although some Eskimo blades were evidently used without a handle,317 the thickened grip is definitely not an Eskimo fea ture. Only one example is recorded from an Eskimo site. This unique blade is said to come from the east coast of Hudson Bay.318 A number of Indian specimens with plain or ridged backs have from one to three cut holes. These holes are placed under the grip or in the correspond cit., Fig. 44 b; (e) Op. cit., Fig. 44 g; (J) Op. tit., Fig. 44, e; (g) Philhower, 1936, PL II, 3; (h) Op. tit., PL IV. 317 Cf.

These holes may have been cut for lash ings to hold the blade to the handle, or, in the case of the ridged specimens, to hold a winding about the handle or to tie on a suspension cord. While the holes are cut in a style very similar to the Dorset method of cutting holes, I do not know of any Eskimo blades with holes of this kind from Dorset territory. A blade from Mas sachusetts has two drilled holes and notches at each end; a blade from New York has drilled holes and another has only notches. Many Eskimo blades have notches like these to secure a winding of baleen which serves as a handle. That such lashing may have been used on Indian blades to take the place of handles is also suggested by the decoration which is found on a number of specimens. Incised XXXX's are found on the thickened grips of a specimen from Massachusetts, another from New Hampshire, and a third from New York.319 Transverse lines are found on the grips of two blades from Connecticut and one from New Jersey, and on the corresponding part of a plain blade from New Jersey.320 The only type of decoration which may not have been derived from such a lashing is a double zigzag line on the ridged grip of an ulo from New York, now in the collection of Roland B. Hill. Such incised decorations are never found on Eskimo ulo blades. Taken as a whole, these Northeastern In dian knives, like the Tena ulos, are better made than the specimens which would be found in any large Eskimo collection, that is, they adhere more exactly to the ideal form of the semi circular shape. Unfortunately, most of the Indian specimens have survived to us without any information about their original cultural context. I believe that most of the specimens from the vicinity of the Finger Lakes in New York belong to the Brewerton Laurentian, although Ritchie found no examples at the type sites. Ulos are characteristic of the Vosberg Laurentian in the Mohawk and Hudson valleys.321 All of the blades recorded from Vermont come from 319 Illustrated specimens are: Willoughby, 1935, Fig. 43 c, 320 Illustrated specimens are: Philhower, 1936, PI II 2 3; PL IV. 321 Ritchie, 1940 b, p. 94. Bailey's Vergennes Laurentian site.322 Two specimens from Hastings County, Ontario, are said to have been found with "slate arrows," which also suggests a Laurentian culture.323 An ulo with plain back, and four ulo fragments, a large chipped leaf-shaped knife blade, a fragment of adz or scraper, and a number of large chipped blades, all liberally bedaubed with red paint, come from a classic Red Paint site at Dennysville, Maine. All of the chipped material shows the shallow, broad flake scars characteristic of Red Paint pressure flaking.324 An ulo blade with cut hole comes from a non ceramic site at Perryville, Rhode Island, and another from a mature New York Coastal site on Long Island.325 Five blades have been found at or close to the Abbott Farm, Trenton, New Jersey, and another comes from Red Valley in central New Jersey. These are associated with a culture related to the Early Coastal of New York, although it may not have been contem poraneous with it.326 One thus has the impres sion that the ulo is definitely associated with the Laurentian culture, which may indeed have been the first Northeastern Indian cul ture to receive it from the Eskimo, although the ulo later spread to other, probably more recent Indian cultures farther south. If prac tically every classic Red Paint site were not exclusively devoted to men's tools, they would probably reveal more evidence of the ulo. The data at present available would indicate that the ulo is characteristic of the inland sites of the "Laurentian," interpreting the latter in its widest sense, but this data is probable incom plete. Some of the crescentic copper specimens from Wisconsin with sharpened convex edge and plain back, or with ends turned up for thrust ing into a handle, may also have been ulos.327 Birket-Smith also records ethnological ulos from the Cree and Montagnais, where, of course, recent Eskimo influence is to be ex pected.328 The specimen from the Old Fish Camp (PL 322 Bailey, 1939, pp. 9 f., PL IV, 7-5, 8, 9,15. 323 NMC files. 324 USNM 7032, found with 7007 to 7031. 326 Information from Douglas S.

Curiously enough, not many Athabaskan groups have adopted the ulo. Besides the Tena, there are the Crow River Kutchin, Kachemak Bay and Kustatan Tanaina, Eyak, and Car rier.330 Rainey publishes a typical Eskimo ulo with asymmetric blade and small asymmetri cally placed ivory handle from a placer mine near Fairbanks, proving trade between the Eskimo and the Indians of the middle Tanana.331 The plain ulo handles of the Tena (PL XIV, 29) reflect the most ancient and common Es kimo type, found in the Old Bering Sea and the Punuk, Birnirk, Canadian Thule, and modern St. Lawrence Island cultures.332 The handle represented by the thickened grip on the Northeastern Indian specimens suggests that the handles for the plain blades were also of the same type. The plain handle is found among the Haida and Makah.333 Turning to Asia, we have ulo blades from Kamchatka, Japan, and Formosa, those of the last two localities having drilled holes for haft ing.334 To the data on Japan which I previously published, I can add a few references. Slate ulo blades with curved edge, straight back, and two holes have been found in a site in Chikuzen Province in northern Kyushu, which Schnell dates at about the Birth of Christ because it shows strong Sino-Korean Bronze Age influ ence in the form of bronze daggers and bronze mirrors of early Han type. He believes that the bronze types and the ulos were imported from Korea.335 Ulos are also known from southern Honshu ;336 ulos with thickened back are known from Echigo Province, on the west coast of 329 Collins, 1937 a, p. 149. 330 Kutchin (Osgood, 1936, p. 75); Tanaina (Osgood, 1937, p. 102; de Laguna, 1934, PL 56, 21; PL 60, 1); Eyak (Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, p. 74; but really Na D&amp;16, not Athabaskan proper); Carrier (Morice, 1894, p. 51, but may be a scraper ?). 331 Rainey, 1939, Fig. 11, 2, p. 399. 332 Collins, 1937 a, PL 51,2-4; PL 78, 10, pp. 350 f.; U of PM 29-90-440 and 483; Mathiassen, 1927,1, PL 23, 4, 6, 8. 333 Niblack, 1890, PL XXIV, 96; Swan, 1870, Fig. 10. 334 de Laguna, 1934, p. 184. 336 Shimada, 1930, Fig. 7, 4, 9; Schnell, 1932, p. 42. 336 Hamada, 1920, p. 3 of resume\ Honshu, north of Tokyo;337 and ulos with straight cutting edge and two holes for hafting are known from Ehime and Shinano provinces in northern Honshu.338 I know of no examples from the northern islands of the Japanese Em pire and so conclude that the ulo was an imple ment characteristic of the prehistoric Japanese proper that did not spread farther north than to the Ainus of northern Honshu. Torii found ulos, generally with two holes at the back and with curved or straight cutting edges, com mon in Manchuria, eastern Mongolia, Korea, and Japan.339 Andersson reports: "the semi lunar, and the nearly related rectangular knife seems to be a characteristic feature of the Mon golian Asiatic peoples and their descendants on the American continent." The Yang Shao Neo lithic blades from Honan Province, China, were of slate, greenstone, and sandstone; and he also illustrates specimens from Chihli (Ho peh) and Johol provinces. The implement is still used in north China; in Nanking it has a plain iron blade, in Honan an iron blade with two holes.340 Liang also reports the rectangular knife from the Neolithic of Shansi Province.341 The inhabitants of Kansu from the Ch'i Chia and pre-Yang Shao periods down to the Shang Bronze Age used rectangular stone knives.342 Specimens of Shang age with straight edge, asymmetrically curved back and a hole near the straight edge, are generally supposed to have been hafted as scythes, although Anders son also derives these from the ulo.343 The rectangular jade "emblem of power," presum ably of the Chow Bronze Age, also looks like an ulo.344 Unfortunately we do not know how these ancient knives were hafted, except that we can assume that since the plain ulo handle is so old in the New World it must also have existed in the Old World at an early date. The Japa nese blades with thickened straight grip and curved cutting edge are indistinguishable from 337 Kanda, 1884, PL X, 4, 7, 8. 338 Higuchi, 1930, Fig. 17 on p. 86; Kanda, 1884; PL XII, 4. 839 Torii, 1913-1914, p. 42, Fig. 29; 1913-1915, pp. 22 f., Fig. 6.

Ulos with plain handles are known from the Chukchee and Siberian Eskimo, and plain ulo blades have been found in Koryak territory.345 Birket-Smith has pointed out that single edged knives like ulos, but with a lateral handle, are known from the Yukon-Bristol Bay Eskimo, the Chukchee, Koryak, Yakut, and from the Stone Age of northern Russia and Norway.346 It is therefore possible that some of the stone blades from China, Mongolia, and Japan were hafted in similar lateral handles. In any case, this type of handle does not seem to have traveled up the Yukon to the Tena, so in this respect the Tena cling to the more widely dis tributed, and possibly the older type of ulo handle. SCRAPERS The small end scraper from Adam's place at the mouth of the Tanana (PL XIV, 4) is almost identical with some found at the Uni versity site near Fairbanks.347 The chipped end scraper is also a common Eskimo type, be ing known from the Old Bering Sea, Ipiutak, Birnirk, Dorset, Thule, Kachemak Bay I to III, and from later Alaskan sites.348 It seems to be lacking on the Alaska Peninsula and on the Aleutian Islands. It is not known at Coast Salish sites, although it was part of the equip ment of the Interior Salish and the Carrier.349 It has been found archaeologically at other sites in central Alaska: Dixthada on the upper Tanana, Chena River near Fairbanks, and a placer mine near Fairbanks.350 It also occurs in Kamchatka and Japan, and Nelson has found similar specimens in pre-Neolithic sites in Mongolia.351 We need have no hesitation in assigning the chipped end scraper to the Ice hunting horizon.

A number of the smaller and more fragile blades described as planing adz blades may actually have been used as scrapers (Pis. XI, 6, 10-13, XXV, 10, 11, 14). Scraper blades of ground and polished slate are known from Kachemak Bay III and from the Canadian Thule culture, from the Tanaina, and from modern northern Alaskan sites. I have sug gested that some of the prehistoric Japanese or Ainu slate blades with tang and transverse cutting edge, called "hoes" by Munro, may have been scrapers.352 In both the Old Bering Sea and Dorset cultures, however, there was a specialized adz-like blade for scrapers, probably, as Collins suggests, for working tough skins or wood. Those of the Old Ber ing Sea culture are of hard rock, shaped like a planing adz blade, except that the pol ished edge meets the lower surface at an abrupt angle, sometimes almost at a right angle. Some of these had a sharp butt, and were probably used unhafted. They were rare in the Punuk and seem to have died out in that period.353 Some specimens of nephrite from the Dorset culture have ground surfaces, and an edge formed by a steep facet from one surface only, like the Old Bering Sea specimens, though none have as steep a facet. There are also specimens of slate and graphite.354 In all Eskimo cultures there are also small planing adz blades of polished hard stone that may have been used for scrapers. The wooden scraper handle (PL XIV, 48), from Hologochaket may have been equipped with either a chipped end blade, or with a polished adz-like blade of stone (or iron, cf., the modern scrapers on Plate XVII). The handle itself is quite like that of a planing adz, except that the bed for the blade is on the under, not on the upper side of the arm and the angle between the arm and the grip is blunt 362 de Laguna, 1934, pp. 76 f., 182.

Handles of this type are par ticularly common in western Alaska, though many Eskimo specimens have the bend near the end of the handle, where it fits conveniently against the heel of the palm. Nelson describes a specimen of this type from the lower Yukon Eskimo as a short scraper with a wooden handle curved downward to a pistol-like grip, and a heavy blade of black chert ground to a chisel-shaped edge, fitted to the handle with an interven ing pad of grass. The blade is held in position by means of a strong lashing of spruce root.365 He also writes: From the lower Kuskokwim to the northern part of Norton Sound and the coast of Bering Strait, stone-blade scrapers with long handles are the prevailing style, although on the coast and islands of Bering Strait a short-handle scraper is frequently seen, while from Kotzebue Sound northward they are all of the latter type, with the handle made to fit the hand and elaborately carved.366 These short handles with elaborate grip and chipped blades set into a socket or slot seem to be a local and probably a late form in north ern Alaska. The simpler type with long handle and with a socket or bed for the blade is known from Bristol Bay, Togiak River, Kus kokwim-Yukon Delta, lower Yukon, Norton Sound and Norton Bay, Sledge Island and Cape Prince of Wales.357 Unfortunately we have no archaeological material from Alaska that indicates the age of this type of handle. A fragmentary specimen from the Old Bering Sea culture, with a bed for the blade and shoul der to hold the lashing, is suggestive of this type, but the end with the grip is missing.358 Most of the Canadian Thule scraper handles are short and straight, or else have a bend at right angles, but in the plane of the blade.359 However, Mathiassen mentions finding at Naujan two bone handles, "rather curved," with a bed for the blade, which may be of the southern Alaskan type.360 In Kachemak Bay III there is a specimen of slightly curved whale rib 366 E.

Olson has commented on the adz-like char acter of the Eskimo skin scraper and has com pared it with the flesher used on the Plains. The Plains Indians use this implement with an adz-like chopping stroke, while the Eskimo, as well as their Indian neighbors who have straight-handled scrapers, push the scraper away from the body.362 The adz-like character of the Eskimo scraper is further exhibited by the fact that exactly the same type of small celt may be used for both the scraper and the adz. When we turn to the Indians of the North west we find that the scraper handle is usually straight. Such straight handles with the blade hafted at the end were used by the Western Dene, Interior Salish, and Wishram.3631 have no information from the Coast, where skin-dres sing does not seem to have been so important. Adz-like scrapers were used by the Columbia and eastern Salish.364 The Tena probably owe their type of scraper with bent handle and polished or chipped stone blade to their Eskimo neighbors. It will be remembered that ulo-shaped stone scrapers were among the most common Tena types (PL XIII, 13, 14, 17, 19). These tools were used unhafted, or, according to Jette, were hafted in an ulo handle. None was elaborately made; one from House 12, Old Fish Camp, was simply a boulder chip. Because the speci mens found by Hrdlicka at Bonasila exhibited such crude workmanship, he wrote:365 The stone industry from the bank [Terrace No. 1] ap peared at first sight so primitive that even the term "paleolithic" would not fit and the only term that seemed to meet the situation was "protolithic." It consists pre dominantly of scrapers and knockers, with here and there a tool sharpened for cutting. The scrapers look especially crude. They consist simply of pieces of small er or larger andesite-like volcanic slabs broken to the de sired size and chipped more or less roughly along what was 361 de Laguna, 1934, p. 58. 362 Olson, 1927, p. 15. 363 Western Dene" (Morice, 1894, Fig. 17); Interior Salish (H.

A closer examination of the stones, which were obtained from a base of a cliff farther down the river [Long Mountain] showed, however, that they were of material which is hard to work, and that the chipping, under the circumstances, was not really bad. Krieger contributed to Hrdlicka's report a description of these specimens which reads in part:366 Of the many sites examined, the old village site at Bonasila, 18 miles below the confluence of the Anvik and Yukon Rivers, yielded the most interesting data. Crudely flaked implements of trap rock with cutting edges showing evi dence of chipping and grinding were uncovered. These im plements are unique among Alaskan artifacts and have no relationship with known types of Eskimo or Indian stone work. In the shaping technic employed by their aboriginal makers; in form, and in type; and, generally, in their un developed character, the stone artifacts from Bonasila and other ancient archaeological sites on the middle Yukon may be classed as primitive neolithic. The stone implements uncovered at Bonasila are so crudely fashioned and are apparently of such an impro vised nature as to suggest an extreme conservatism in cul ture development, or perhaps a degeneration, due largely to lack of better materials. . . . Crude pottery vessels and potsherds were discovered associated with the objects of stone. This ware incorporates elementary decorative designs distinct from the known historic Eskimo or Indian types of pottery decoration. There can be no intimation that this ware is archaic or that it belongs to any archaic culture offshoot from farther south. It therefore becomes a ques tion of some unknown earlier Asiatic culture connection that manifested itself in crude forms of flaked and ground stone implements and in unique pottery forms. It is un certain that the ancient fossil ivory culture of northwest Alaska [Old Bering Sea culture], of which Doctor Hrdlicka has brought in some excellent examples, is in any manner associated with the primitive neolithic stone and pottery forms uncovered at Bonasila. It is established, however, beyond a doubt that both cultures and types of artifacts are Asiatic in origin and have little or no connection with the culture of the western Eskimo. It will be remembered that Hrdlicka later changed his opinion about the age of Bonasila, coming to the same conclusion that we did, namely that it was an Indian village inhabited from pre-Russian times until fairly recently. However, I wish to make clear that none of the specimens found at the site differs from recent Tena and Yukon Eskimo types. The scrapers from Bonasila, like those from many other Yukon sites, are crude, not because of lack of better material (our collections from Bonasila contained plenty of slate, basalt, etc.), but be cause roughly shaped scrapers were just as efficient as more carefully made specimens. Ulo-shaped scrapers were common on the upper Tanana and Copper rivers, where they 366 Hrdli&amp;a, 1930 a, p. 145. were often made of boulder chips with battered edges. Rainey reports them from the upper Copper River Valley, from all sections of the site at Dixthada on the upper Tanana, from Lake Harding near Fairbanks, from Rampart Rapids on the middle Yukon, and from the University site at Fairbanks.367 They were used by the Kutchin. Thus Osgood writes of their dehairing skins with a "side scraper." After soaking in brains and after being smoked, the skin is softened by being worked over a log "with a flat-sided piece of stone." "Flat pieces of rock with a minimum of retouching perform as side scrapers very well."368 The Tanaina also used similar implements for cleaning and scrap ing skins.369 The Kachemak Bay Eskimo in all periods made use of boulder chips as scrapers (as well as for other purposes), and in the Second Period they used very nice slate imple ments, chipped, but otherwise shaped exactly like ulo blades. These were also found at Port Moller on the Alaska Peninsula and on the Aleutian Islands.370 Ulo-shaped scrapers were common in Prince William Sound, and the natives there told me that sometimes a true ulo blade would be purposely dulled for use as a scraper. I believe that I was wrong in saying that these chipped slate blades were a local southwestern Alaskan type. Certainly the finest slate forms were developed in this area, but the generalized ulo-like type of scraper has a much wider distribution. Furthermore, very large slate blades with chipped edges, either un finished ulos or finished scrapers, are character istic of the Belcher Islands in Hudson Bay. They appear together with ordinary ground slate ulo blades.371 From St. Michael, in Norton Sound, Nelson published a "rounded, boulder-like piece of granite about 5 inches in its longest diameter for rubbing and softening skins; the lower sur face is smoothed and polished by use."372 This is, of course, somewhat different. From St. Lawrence Island, however, there are slate scrapers. Rainey describes the type as a large, rough, lozenge-shaped implement which retains most of the facets of the chipping process employed in its manu 367 Rainey, 1939, pp. 360, 366, 374, 378, Fig. 2, 8, 9; Fig. 4, 4, 5; Fig. 5,17; Fig. 7, 5, d. 368 Osgood, 1936, pp. 70 f., 67. 369 Osgood, 1937, p. 76, PL 12 A; de Laguna, 1934, p. 61. 370 Op. tit., pp. 61, 184 f. 371 Quimby, 1940, p. 154, Fig. 17 a; Jenness, 1941, PL XIX, 3. 372 E.

One specimen (PL 34, Fig. 1), is, however, polished to some degree on both surfaces. The lengths vary from 11 to 15 cms. in the five examples of this type found in the [modern] house. Since they are rare, it may be that these blades are merely rough blocks from which polished im plements were to be made, but it is also possible that they were used for skin scrapers. They were also found in the protohistoric and late Punuk levels (including Rainey's "Thule").373 In the Van Valin collection from Birnirk sites near Point Barrow there are only two ulo-like scrapers?a boulder chip and a sandstone implement with a chipped and ground edge.374 The Ipiutak culture, in default of ground slate ulos, possessed a semi-lunar form in flint, retouched on one side, which might have served both as ulo and as scraper.375 Ulo-like scrapers, hafted in plain bone handles without the tang characteristic of the contem porary ulo handles, were used in West Green land until very recently.376 From Port Burwell and Nuvuk Island, Labrador, both sites that have yielded a number of Dorset stone speci mens, there is a scraper made of a slate slab and another, of a boulder chip.377 From New foundland, there are a few large knives or scrapers made of slabs of smoky quartzite or chert, retouched along one edge. Whether these are Dorset or Beothuk we do not know.378 Similar specimens were found in great numbers at Tadoussac and Bradore in Quebec.379 Ulo like scrapers are sometimes found in Ontario, New York, and Massachusetts.380 They seem to be common to both Red Paint and shell heap cultures in Maine.381 A scraper made of a boulder chip was found 373 Geist and Rainey, 1936, pp. 125, 149, 163, 196, PL 34, 1-3; PL 49, 5; PL 57, 5; PL 66, 6, 7. 374 U of PM 29-90-517, 526. 376 Rainey, 1941 b, PL VI, 13. 376 Mathiassen, 1937, II, p. 85. 377 NMC IX-A-703, IX-B-193. 378 PMH 80426,66444; Wintemberg, 1939-1940, PL VI-1, 12. 379 Tadoussac (AMNH 20.1/7061 A; Wintemberg, 1929); Bradore (NMC VIII-E-432 e, etc.). 380 Ontario (AMNH 20.0/1343; ROMA HD 8781, and 8818 of slate), New York (AMNH 2/2052; RMAS from prehistoric Seneca site at Richmond Mills, Ontario Co.); Mass.

R. Harrington tells me that they were also used by the Paiute and Shoshoni. Ulo-shaped scrapers were found at a Basketmaker III site at Rioville on the Colorado River in Nevada.390 Ulo-like blades of slate, commonly called "hoes," are to be seen in the local museum at Clarkdale, Arizona, found at the nearby Pueblo III-IV site of Tuzigoot, and they are also known from the southern Arizona site, Roosevelt 9:6, and the site of Gila Pueblo, Globe, Arizona.391 Some of these have notches, like the ulos and chipped ulo-like scrapers from Kachemak Bay, and some even have edges polished from use. The latter are practically indistinguishable from southwestern Alaskan specimens. Typical ulo-like scrapers, made of thin slabs of quartzite, with one rounded edge, are characteristic of the protohistoric and his toric Pawnee sites in Nebraska.392 That chipped ulo-like scrapers are very ancient is attested by the collection from Pinto Basin, in the Mohave 382NMCXII-B-640. 383 H.

The notched specimen from Bonasila (PL XIII, 14) is rather similar to a notched slate scraper from Kachemak Bay.394 While this type of notching was reported by Osgood for the lower Tena ulos, it was not seen on any of our ulo blades from the Yukon, but it is common on Eskimo ulos from southwestern Alaska to Baffinland,395 and is also found on the slate ulo-like blade from Gila Pueblo and on two Northeastern "semi-lunar knives," already cited. The scraper of split leg bone with longitudinal edge (Pis. XV, 27; XVII, 1), generally with both articulations left for handles, is an ancient Eskimo type. I have shown that it is distributed from Kachemak Bay sub-Ill in southwestern Alaska all the way to Labrador and Greenland, appearing in Thule culture sites as a substitute for the cup-shaped scraper of ivory.396 It is also found in the Old Bering Sea and Birnirk cul tures.397 The Dorset Eskimo made a somewhat similar implement of split antler. This seems to have been a more generalized tool, however, and may have been used as a scraper for cleaning ice from the kayak, for pressing water from wet skins, or even as a snow knife (since one end is often finished off like a blunt knife), as well as for cleaning skins. Some specimens were almost certainly two-handed skin scrapers (beaming tools), but no sharp line can be drawn between the variations of the generalized type.398 Birket-Smith399 has published a comprehen sive table of the distribution of the two-handed scraper and shows that it is "characteristic of the sub-arctic peoples in Siberia and North America." The usual Eurasian form has a wooden handle with one or two inserted blades 393 Campbell and Campbell, 1935, PL 22 "side scrapers"; Roberts, 1935, PL 12 b; 1936, PL 5 big "side scrapers." 394 de Laguna, 1934, PL 35,1. 396 Op. tit., p. 184. 396 Op. tit., p. 200; add 0.

The subtype which consists of a sharpened and, usually, wholly or partly split tubular bone of a big animal, and which in North America stretches from the North Pacific plateaux across Canada to Labrador and the land south of the Great Lakes, is doubtless older [than the Eurasian form.]400 In Ohio it occurs in the older, so-called Fort Ancient Culture; but otherwise there is only very little modern evidence with regard to southeast North America, so that its occurrence here in earlier times seems to be doubtful.401 On the North Pacific Coast it seems to be un known,402 and from the Plains there are only two indica tions from the northern part (Crow, Arapaho).403 In Cali fornia, deer rib, and on the southwesterly plateaux, sharp ened but not split tubular bones have been used as two handed scrapers.404 I do not think that the split leg bone scraper is very old or even very common in the North east, despite its antiquity farther south, for it appears chiefly in Iroquois sites and in those late Algonkian sites that show Iroquois influ ence (Owasco, Late New York Coastal and Monongahela Woodland of western Pennsyl vania) ,405 In this connection we might note that the Fort Ancient culture, mentioned above by Birket-Smith, is in many ways like the oldest undifferentiated Iroquois culture. It would be 400 The split leg bone scraper is also used by the Chukchee (de Laguna, 1934, p. 200), Yukaghir and Lamut (Bogoras, 1904-1909, p. 218; Jochelson, 1926, Fig. 135), and is known from Neolithic Manchuria (Torii, 1913-1915, PL XIII, bottom row, but identification is uncertain). 401 Henry B. Collins, Jr. has kindly brought to my at tention evidence suggestive of the antiquity of the two handed scraper in the Southeast. Thus, Wedel has found it in the Hopewell horizon in Kansas and Missouri, and Webb (1938, PL 14 b, cf. pp. 363 ff.) illustrates but does not mention in the text a specimen from a cave in the Norris Basin in eastern Tennessee, the cultural contents of which seem to belong to the "Archaic" horizon. While no two handed scrapers have yet been reported from sites in Louisiana of this same period, they probably belong here also. 402 Cf. however H. I. Smith, 1903, Fig. 34 a from the lower Fraser; and Haeberlin and Gunther, 1930, p. 33, from the Puget Sound Salish (of deer rib). 403 Two-handed scrapers of bison rib were found by Strong (1935, pp. 60, 67, PL 1, 2 b) only at historic Pawnee sites, but scrapers of bison spines are found in the St. Helena focus of the Upper Republican aspect (prehistoric Caddo or Sioux ?) (Bell, 1936, p. 55, PL XXV, 9). 404 Split deer leg bone scrapers are found archaeologically in central California (Gifford, 1940, I. on p. 214, p. 172), and notched rib scrapers in the San Francisco Bay area (ibid., HI. on p. 213). 406 Wintemberg (1931, p. 90) reports it is rare even in Canadian Iroquois sites; Ritchie (1934, p. 35, PL XI, 20, 21) says that Castle Creek is "the only Algonkin site where such implements are known to have been found." Late New York Coastal (Skinner, 1932, p. 43), Monongahela (Butler, 1939, PL 22, lower right).</page><page sequence="198">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 191 interesting to determine whether this type of scraper had been introduced into the Northeast by the Iroquois. It is, however, found in Maine and Nova Scotia, but here we cannot exclude possible Eskimo influence.406 The scapula and mandible scrapers with longitudinal edge are related to the two-handed scraper of split bone, and it is possible that the small bone knife-like scrapers, made for deli cate use with one hand (see "Boot Sole Creasers and Stretchers"), are also related to them. The scapula scrapers with longitudinal edge (PI. XV, 24-26)) seem to be particularly char acteristic of Kachemak Bay III and the Interior Salish, and probably developed under the influ ence of the split leg bone scraper with longitudi nal edge, but in my original discussion of this type I was wrong in suggesting that it was restricted to these cultures.407 Thus the closely related scraper made of a beluga jaw was found in the Old Bering Sea culture,408 and the Dorset Eskimp or their descendants made a rectangu lar scraper with longitudinal edge from a trimmed piece of scapula.409 Scapula scrapers are not mentioned from the Kutchin or Tanaina, but the Carrier used "the socket end of the shoulder blade of the caribou, left almost in its natural state," as a fat scraper, and the Sekani used the "shoulder-blade of a moose sharpened like a draw-knife."410 In a site of the "Iowa Algonkian" culture Strong found a broken scapula scraper with transverse edge that had been resharpened with a longitudinal edge.411 Scapula scraper-knives, probably made from broken hoes of bison scapula, are known from prehistoric Caddoan and Siouan sites in Nebraska.412 Scapula scrapers or knives with longitudinal edge are one of the characteristic types of the New York Archaic, and also belong to the Laurentian, to the Point Peninsula focus of the Vine Valley, and to the New York 406 Maine (USNM 219774), Nova Scotia (Smith and Wintemberg, 1929, p. 123).

These designs will be dis cussed under "Art." The scraper made of a split leg bone with a transverse edge may be related to the Eskimo scraper made of a caribou scapula with trans verse edge. The latter type was not represented in our Tena collection, but might have been expected since it is a Canadian Thule culture type, and has also been reported from Kotzebue Sound, Port Moller on the Alaska Peninsula, and Kachemak Bay II and III. An ivory copy was found on the Aleutian Islands. We should also expect to find it represented in northern Alaska in some ancient horizon.416 It is possible that a broken specimen from the Van Valin collection from a Birnirk site near Point Bar row has a transverse edge.417 The leg bone scraper with transverse edge (Pis. XV, 28-30, XXV, 2) also belongs to the Canadian Thule culture. From Naujan, Ma thiassen figures blades of split bone, one of which was hafted in an antler handle.418 This tool is very similar to the scapula scrapers and to the stone copies of scapula scrapers figured on the same plate. Leg bone scrapers with ser rated edge or with an iron blade are used by the Eskimo and Naskapi of Ungava and by the Eskimo of the lower Yukon. The Eskimo of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta make an imi tation in antler.419 Rowley illustrates a Dorset specimen of split caribou leg bone as a scraper with transverse edge,420 although it closely re sembles the combination creaser and scraper 413 Archaic (Ritchie, 1936 b, Pis.

Split leg bone scrapers with transverse ser rated edge are used by the Kutchin for clean ing skins, and by the Carrier and Sekani.421 The same type, but with plain edge, is used by the Chilcotin, Interior and Coast Salish, and Tlingit.422 A scraper with serrated edge, found in the Arvilla gravel pit, Red River Valley, North Dakota, is also of the same type, and Jenks compares it with similar Siouan and Al gonkian specimens.423 Both notched and un notched specimens have been found in a mound at Sourisford, Manitoba, and in North Da kota.424 Strong reports that the type is common in historic Pawnee sites in Nebraska, but very rare in protohistoric sites, and "unknown as yet in prehistoric horizons."425 However, split bone "fleshers" and "gouges," with smooth rounded end, are known from prehistoric Cad doan and Siouan sites in Nebraska.426 Split leg bone scrapers, sharpened on both edges and on the end (like the Coast Salish type men tioned above) were found at the Basketmaker III site of Shabik'eschee, near Chaco Canyon.427 The scraper with plain transverse edge is com mon in Pueblo III and IV sites in New Mexico (see the local museums at Pueblo Bonito, Aztec, and Puye), and with serrated edge is still made at the Pueblo of Isleta.428 It is also known from the Utes.429 Both notched and plain edged scrapers have been found at Huron and Tobacco Nation sites in Ontario, where they appear to have been a loan from the Al gonkians, plain specimens are known from the Monongahela Woodland culture in western 421 Kutchin (Osgood, 1936, pp. 70 f.), Carrier (Morice, 1894, Fig. 54), Sekani (Jenness, 1937 a, p. 35). 422 Chilcotin (Morice, 1894, Fig. 53), Salish (H.

The only type mentioned above which we did not find is the scapula scraper with transverse edge. The variety of Tena skin dressing tools is reflected in the excellence and variety of the finished products. The Indians produce tanned skins decorated with porcupine quillwork (now beadwork), furs and bird skins in mosaic pat terns, waterproof clothing and bags of gut skin, eelskin and fishskin, articles of dehaired seal skin and also of woven rabbit skin. This variety is the result of blending Eskimo and Indian techniques and styles. The only Eskimo who possess a comparable array of skin-working tools were the Kachemak Bay III Eskimo and the modern Yukon-Kuskokwim Eskimo. In contrast, we have the Northwest Coast In dians whose equipment was extremely limited. For the Klallam, for example, Gunther reports that deerskins were dehaired with a mussel shell knife and that brains for tanning "were rubbed in with a rough stone," but mentions no other scrapers.432 BOOT SOLE CREASERS AND STRETCHERS The boot sole creaser (PL XIV, 24, 42), a little bone implement specially adapted for setting the creases in the toe and heel of the sole before it is sewn to the upper, is known only from Greenland and from Alaska. It does not belong to the Thule culture, however, like so many types with a similar distribution. In Greenland, it is not very old: the first bone and ivory specimens, shaped something like flat tened, blunt awls, date only from the sixteenth century.433 The creaser shaped like a little boot seen in profile, with the "sole" sharpened to an edge, is a still later Greenland form.434 In 430 Huron and Tobacco (AR, 1895, Fig. 192 a, b; Wintem berg, 1935, pp. 235 f.), Monongahela (Butler, 1939, PL 15 u), Maine (USNM 219645 "bone gouge"). 431 Ritchie, 1940 b, p. 80, referring to Beauchamp, 1902, p. 290, PL 28,267. 432 Gunther, 1927, p. 219. 433 Mathiassen, 1934 a, PL 3, 25, 26; 1936 a, PL 1, 20, 21; 1936 b, Fig. 53,15,16. 434 Mathiassen, 1934, a p. 108; 1930 b, PL 24, 6, p. 313.</page><page sequence="200">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 193 Alaska, the creaser is not known before modern times. I would suggest that the appearance of this implement in these two widely separated areas is probably due only to independent paral lel development. Eskimo boots may have had crimped soles from time immemorial,435 but if so, the crimping was accomplished without a special tool. One wonders whether the creaser was not associated in origin with an improve ment in sewing technique, perhaps stimulated by the acquisition of better needles (either metal needles or small bits of iron suitable for drilling fine eyes in bone needles). On the other hand, we cannot be absolutely sure that a specialized implement was not used for creasing boots in very early times. The small ground nephrite, chert and slate imple ments of the Old Bering Sea, Dorset, and Disco Bay "Stone Age" of West Greenland have one dull edge which meets at a right or oblique angle another edge, usually ground dull, also.436 This corner is usually broken off. Mathiassen, Col lins and Wintemberg have suggested that these implements were used as boot sole creasers.437 The first of the dated specimens (and I do not think that these were the earliest) were found by Mathiassen in sites of the Inugsuk culture in Disco Bay, dating from the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and "it was merely ac cidental that it was not found in the old layers at Inugsuk" itself, a site of the same age on the northern West Coast.438 In Disco Bay, in the Sukkertoppen District just south of the Arctic Circle, and at Angmagssalik on the East Coast they date from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; one crude specimen came from a site of the seventeenth to eighteenth century in southernmost Greenland, and the type lasts on in East Greenland through the eighteenth century.439 However, the small awl-like creaser 436 No crimping, however, seems to be visible on the Thule boot from northern BafBnland (Mathiassen, 1927,1, PL 56). 436 Old Bering Sea (Collins, 1937 a, p. 149, PL 39, 19-22, and pp. 153 f., PL 42,17-19), Dorset (Jenness, 1941, PL XVI, 20 from Belcher Islands; NMC IX-C-361, 389, 396, 412 from Cape Dorset; Rowley, 1940, Fig. 2, 9 from Iglulik; Wintemberg, 1939-1940, PL XVI-1, 1-6 from Newfound land), Disco Bay (Solberg, 1907, PL 5, 1-19, etc., "drill points."). 437 Mathiassen, 1931, p. 94; Collins, 1937 a, p. 336; Win temberg, 1939-1940, p. 316. 438 Mathiassen, 1934 a, pp. 125, 154 f., 156 f., 169, PL S,4. 439 Disco Bay (Op. cit., pp. 108, 120), Sukkertoppen (Mathiassen, 1931, pp. 93 f., 115, 120, 126, PL 3, 18), southernmost Greenland (Mathiassen, 1936 b, p. 97), of bone or ivory appears early in the sixteenth century on both the west and east coasts of Greenland, and in Disco Bay, at any rate, lasted on into the eighteenth century.440 This form was replaced by the boot-shaped tool. The stone implement and the awl-like creaser would, therefore, have been contemporaneous for some time, and I think it very unlikely that two tools of such different shapes and made of such differ ent materials should have been used for the same simple purpose. In any case, the West Greenland stone implements are of Dorset type and were undoubtedly derived from Canada, although we do not know whether they were brought to Greenland by a pure Dorset migra tion or by the Thule migration. The shape of the Canadian Dorset stone im plements suggests, I believe, the use to which all the implements of this class were put. These Canadian blades are thin stone plates, ground flat on both surfaces. One edge, the back, was usually left chipped and probably fitted into a slotted handle, probably like those used for knives. The chipped or ground notch on the opposite, front, edge evidently held a lashing which secured it to the handle. The edge above the notch is ground straight and flat, so that its plane is at right angles to the two faces of the blade. Frequently the edge across the top was ground in the same way; sometimes it was ground to form an obtuse angle with one of the faces. The angle between the front edge and the top, as I have remarked, was frequently broken off, implying an energetic use. Incidentally, this argues against the tool having been used to crimp boot soles, since one does not have to press very hard to crease skin, and none of the bone creasers figured by Mathiassen are broken at the tip. I believe that the stone implements were used for cutting grooves in bone, not only in order to break the bone in two, but to make the holes so characteristic of the Dorset culture which are produced by cutting two grooves, one on each side of the specimen and crossing at right angles. (The smaller holes were probably cut by lamellar flakes.) In cutting, one of the two angles of the upper outer corner of the blade would have been used, and this would account for the common breakage of the stone imple ment at this place. If my hypothesis is correct, this implement would correspond to the chipped Angmagssalik (Mathiassen, 1933, pp. 91 f., Fig. 30,11, 12, PL 9, 7, 8.) 440 Mathiassen, 1934 a, pp. 160 ff., PL 10, 4.</page><page sequence="201">194 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 stone burins (sometimes called "gravers") of the Upper Paleolithic. The Tena boot sole creasers (PL XIV, 24, 42) are like flattened awls and resemble not only the sixteenth century Greenland forms but modern specimens from Nushegak (south of the Kuskokwim), Nunivak Island, Kotzebue Sound, and Point Hope, Alaska.441 Nelson also figures two sewing-bag fasteners from the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, that "have their ends flattened to serve as sole creasers."442 Some modern Alaskan creasers are made like small knives. Nelson illustrates such types from Sledge Island, Kotzebue Sound, and Cape Prince of Wales.443 The combination scraper and creaser from Fox Creek (PL XXVI, 75) is probably more closely related to these than to the awl-like forms. There is an identical speci men from Prince William Sound.444 These smalj bone knives would probably not be recognized as creasers had they not been identified by the natives themselves. Indeed, we may well ask whether such little implements did not also serve other purposes connected with the prepa ration and sewing of skins. Two small knives, , or scrapers, as I originally described them, were found in Kachemak Bay III and another on the Aleutian Islands.445 There is a combination knife and scraper from the Coast Salish of Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, and small bone implements like paper-cutters are re ported from the lower Fraser, and from the Interior Salish. They may have been used for basketry or for cutting the inner bark of trees to obtain the sap.446 A combination knife scraper-awl of split leg bone was found at Shabik'eshchee, the Basketmaker III site near Chaco Canyon, New Mexico.447 Spatulate ob jects of bone are in general widely distributed in Indian sites all over North America. Small bone knives or knife-like scrapers were thus available to the Eskimo for the specialized function of crimping boot soles. The Eskimo from the Kuskokwim to Cape Prince of Wales 441 E. W.

They generally have a hole at one end, so they could have been used for stringing fish, and two sharpened edges and a sharp point, so they could be used for cleaning fish, or for other purposes. They seem to have been a handy, but not specialized tool.451 The wooden implement from Old Fish Camp (PL XVI, 1) resembles very closely a boot sole stretcher or softener from the protohistoric period on St. Lawrence Island.452 A bone im plement with a more spade-like blade was found by Jochelson on the westernmost of the Aleutian Islands and may have been used for the same purpose.4531 do not know the distribu tion of this type of implement. It does not have a distinctive shape and may therefore have oc curred at a number of sites without attracting notice. Mathiassen454 reports it from eighteenth century sites in West Greenland, where it is still used (now usually of wood with an iron blade), and it may have belonged to the Thule culture. The modern Point Barrow Eskimo, how ever, use instead an ordinary stone scraper.455 Some type of implement for softening and stretching the sole of the boot after it has shrunk and become stiff from being wet is in dispensable, and we might expect to find such an implement wherever the Eskimo boot is made. Since the Tena make and wear waterproof Eskimo boots, especially in the wet spring, we are not surprised that they have adopted the implement for softening the sole. HARPOON HEADS Two harpoon heads were found on the Yukon, one at the Tena site of New Grayling (PL XV, 4), the other at the "Eskimo" site of 448 E. W.

It is probable that they were used for salmon. The Kutchin use toggle harpoon heads for fish,456 but these were probably made in two pieces, like the heads used on the double-foreshaft (or two-pronged) fish and seal harpoons of the Northwest Coast and the northern Plateau. These two Yukon specimens must have been copied from Eskimo types, and the question is from what Eskimo and when? The New Grayling head has a medial spur and an open socket, closed by lashing in a groove. It may once have had an end blade set in a slit at right angles to the line hole, but the fore end was damaged and has been reshaped for further use without a blade, so that we may consider the specimen as bladeless. Bladeless heads of this type were especially charac teristic of Kachemak Bay I, although they lasted on into Kachemak Bay III.457 The group of Kachemak Bay open socket heads includes others with lateral spurs, and I have already compared them with Thule Type I heads from the Canadian Arctic (open socket, bladeless, with lateral spurs). However, the Kachemak Bay heads resemble far more closely the cor responding Type 1 heads of the Dorset cul ture,458 especially since these often have a medial spur. None of the Thule Type I heads has a medial spur, and therefore none is com parable to the Tena specimen. A medial spur with two subsidiary spurs on each side (form ing a trifurcated medial spur) is characteristic of a large group of open socket Old Bering Sea heads with side blades and two drilled line holes, one above the other.459 In a bifurcated form, this medial spur persists in some of the Birnirk-like descendants of this group belonging to the Punuk culture.460 However, all of these Old Bering Sea and Punuk heads seem far too complicated to have inspired the plain little Tena specimen. The question of when Thule Type I heads appeared in Alaska461 does not concern us here, since none of these Alaskan specimens has a medial spur.

Lawrence Island seems to have a medial spur. This is a specimen with open socket closed by lashing in a groove and slot, and with a blade slit parallel to the medial line hole and to the medial spur. It was found with a group of Punuk open socket Type III(a)x heads (Rainey's Type C) at Kukulik.462 Since Rainey refers to it as "Rare Type 2" we do not know how significant it is. Probably it is only a variant of the Late Punuk Type III(b)x. Medial spurs are also found on some closed socket heads (that is, the line hole is in the plane of the spur). These are found at Port Moller on the Alaska Peninsula, in a cultural setting corresponding to Kachemak Bay III, in the prehistoric Ainu (?) culture of Japan, and in the Lapp Iron Age.463 Somewhat similar closed socket heads, but with the line hole placed very far to the side, were made by the Koryak.464 On the whole, I think that the medial spur must be a very ancient feature, perhaps es pecially associated with the ancient North Pacific and Dorset continuum and I would sug gest that the specimen found at New Grayling is a copy of the Kachemak Bay type head. The harpoon head from Fox Creek (PL XXVI, 1) has a closed socket, two opposed lateral spurs, and groove for the harpoon line. The fore end is missing, so that we do not know whether or not it was furnished with a blade. In some respects, this specimen resembles a head for a bird harpoon arrow, found at Naujan, the classic Canadian Thule culture site.465 The latter harpoon head has a blade slit, closed socket, and two lateral spurs, though they are not quite as opposed as on the Yukon head, and it lacks a line hole. The most interesting feature of the Yukon specimen is not the lack of a line hole, but the presence of two lateral opposed spurs. Such spurs are found on a number of Dorset heads, including a group with open socket (Type IC), and all with closed socket (Types 2, 3, 4, 5 and 5) 466 These heads may have blades (Types 462 Geist and Rainey, 1936, PL 67,6, p. 201; cf. de Laguna, 1939 a, pp. 289 f. for translation of Rainey's harpoon types into Collin's system. 463 de Laguna, 1934, p. 189; add: Solberg, 1909, Fig. 40. 464 Jochelson, 1905-1908, Fig. 32 b, c. 465 Mathiassen, 1927, I, p. 37, PL 10, 10. 466 Type 1 C (Jenness, 1925, Fig. 8 c, broken), Type 2 (Fig. 3, Fig. 8, d, e), Type 3 (Fig. 5/, h, Fig. 8 k, I, m), Type 4 (Fig. 8f, g), Type 5 (Fig. 5 g, Fig. 8 n, o), Type 6 (Fig. 2, Fig. 8 h, i,j).

Modern Central Eskimo and Greenland heads have re tained the two spurs, but have usually pushed them to the back of the head, so that they appear as a single, bifurcated medial spur. Thus the only modern specimens with truly lateral spurs are from Angmagssalik in East Green land. The first is a small leister harpoon head with single line hole, closed socket, and blade less point. A pair of these were used on a salmon leister with two foreshafts.467 The other type has a closed socket, two line holes side by side, and a blade parallel to the plane of the spurs.468 Aside from these eastern heads, which are either Dorset types or hybrid forms resulting from a fusion of Dorset with Thule types, har poon heads with lateral spurs are exceedingly rare among the Eskimo. From East Cape, Siberia, Mathiassen has published a bladeless specimen with open socket, and reports that a somewhat similar specimen was found at Point Barrow, Alaska.469 These seem to represent a local type, probably not very old, according to Collins.470 To find other examples of opposed lateral spurs we shall have to go outside the Eskimo area. Thus the Ainu used bladeless forms, with closed sockets, and without line holes,471 and similar heads with slit sockets, both pre sumably used as arrowheads.472 There is a cor responding type with open socket, but here the line may have been attached to the lashing groove about the open socket.473 There are also bladeless heads with slit sockets and one line hole,474 or with two line holes side by side,475 or one above the other,476 and bladeless heads with closed sockets and a single line hole from edge to edge.477 These heads would correspond to Dorset Types 2, 4 and a bladeless 6. There is also an Ainu type with closed socket, blade, 467 Mathiassen, 1933, p. 115, Fig. 40. 468 O. T. Mason, 1902, PL 4; Thalbitzer, 1914, Fig. 133 d.

Going still farther afield, we find lateral op posed spurs on an open socket head from the Lapp Iron Age finds at Varanger Fjord, East Finmark. The socket lashing is in a groove, there is a single line hole, and no barbs or blade.483 With the exception of a few Northeastern Indian harpoon heads that have clearly been inspired by Dorset types, we cannot find any where a group of harpoon heads that resemble the Dorset types as closely as do those made by the Ainu of Hokkaido and the Kuriles. The Ainu made not only the forms with lateral spurs, but with two line holes side by side or one above the other, all features which are rarely found on other Eskimo heads. Unfortunately none of the pictures of Ainu heads are clear enough to tell us the shapes of the sockets. It is possible that some of the closed or slit sockets on Ainu specimens may have been rectangular, like those of the Dorset. This is suggested by the wedge-shaped ends of bone specimens from the Kuriles, which look very much like foreshafts.484 We might also note that the slit ting up of one face of the closed socket, which is a common feature on the Ainu heads, is paralleled among Dorset Types 2, 3 and 6.485 These slits occur on the ventral face, which is the more rounded, even on Types 2 and 3. If the modern leister harpoon from Angmags salik with two heads and two foreshafts can give us any clue as to the way in which the 478 Hitchcock, 1891, Fig. 85. 479 Baba, 1936, PL VI, 25.

Birket-Smith (1929, II, pp. 155 f.) has also called attention to the Dorset- and Thule like character of the heads from this site. 484 Baba, 1936, PL VI, 23,29; Torii, 1919-1921, PL XXX, 15. 486 Jenness, 1925, Fig. 3 b; de Laguna, 1946.</page><page sequence="204">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 197 Dorset heads were used, we might infer that many of the Dorset specimens, at any rate the smaller ones, were hafted on such double fore shaft leisters. The Ainu also used heads with closed sockets and two opposed lateral spurs on similar leisters for seals and fish.486 The evidence thus suggests that the Ainu and Dorset heads are related in some way. The Fox Creek head with closed socket and two opposed lateral spurs (and the similar East Cape head with open socket ?) may represent modern local variants of the same fundamental type. The prototype of the Fox Creek head was probably of southern origin, perhaps being ultimately derived from the same source as the Ainu types. In this connection we ought not to forget that the harpoon heads in common use on the Northwest Coast, northwest California, and adjacent Plateaus are made in two pieces, have two lateral spurs, frequently have a rectangular socket between, and are often used on seal or salmon harpoons with two foreshafts.487 We ought to consider the possibility that these two-piece heads may be the direct survivors of the prototypes from which the one-piece Dorset and northern Ainu heads were derived. This would explain the slit on the closed sockets of these heads. It seems now to be purely decora tive, but it may be a reminder that these heads were once made in two parts, for the slit 486 Hitchcock, 1891, Fig. 85; McRitchie, 1892, PL IX, 7; Hewes, 1942, Fig. 1; Montandon, 1937, Fig. 18. 487 This type of head is often described as being made in three parts: blade or point, and two barbs or spurs.

Moreover, all of the Dorset open socket Type 1 heads and the closed socket Types 2 and 3 heads have the single line hole enlarged at the back as if to hold the knot at the end of the harpoon line. Thus these heads, unlike most Eskimo specimens, were fastened at the very end of the line, not strung on a loop. This type of attachment can be seen on the heads of the double foreshaft leister harpoon from Angmags salik, previously compared with Dorset Type 2. We may infer the same method of attachment for some of the modern Ainu heads used on similar leisters. Unfortunately, the illustra tions of the prehistoric Ainu material do not show whether this attachment was used, al though Schnell suggests this for a prehistoric Honshu Ainu head with bifurcated medial spur.488 All the Northwestern Indian heads, like the Fox Creek head, were, in default of a line hole, necessarily tied to the end of the harpoon line. The similarity in the method of attachment thus strengthens our impression of a relationship between Dorset, Ainu and North western Indian types. There is also, as I have suggested, reason to suppose that the Dorset heads were used with a double foreshaft leister. Hewes489 has made a study of the distribution of harpoons of this type, reporting that of the Asiatic tribes only the Ainu knew it. In America, he finds it on the coast from the Kwakiutl and Nootka south to San Francisco Bay, and inland from the Chil cotin to the Yokuts of the San Joaquin Valley. He also notes the occurrence of this type of leister among the Copper Eskimo of the western Canadian Arctic (who use, however, an ordi nary head fastened in the loop of the line), but he was evidently not acquainted with the East Greenland form. In addition to the type with detachable toggle heads, the Angmagssalik Eskimo also used a form with two ittuarteq or hinged heads, the whole head and foreshaft assemblage being detachable.490 This has per haps supplanted to some extent the ordinary, and presumably earlier type with detachable heads and fixed foreshafts. In this study Hewes calls attention to specific resemblances be tween Ainu harpoons and those of the Kwakiutl 488 Schnell, 1932, Fig. 10. 489 Hewes, 1942, pp. 95 f. 490 Thalbitzer, 1914, pp. 438 f., Figs. 138 a, b, 139 a.</page><page sequence="205">198 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 and Nootka, all of whom use foreshafts of un equal length and a crutch-shaped or trilobed expansion at the butt of the shaft.491 The Ainu, some northern California tribes, and the East Greenland Eskimo are alike in using a con necting string between the foreshafts.492 Hewes believes that the evidence suggests the follow ing sequence of harpoon types:493 (1) Soon after the peopling of America, barbed heads with tang were used in the North Pacific area from the Amur to California. (2) The toggle head with socket developed. (3) Before the development of Eskimo culture, the double foreshaft harpoon with toggle head was in vented on the southern Northwest Coast and spread to the Ainu, via the Aleutian Islands or Bering Strait. (4) The double foreshaft harpoon was abandoned in the area north of Yezo (Hokkaido), in the Bering Sea area, and on the northern Northwest Coast. I do not believe that there is any evidence to suggest the priority of the tanged and barbed head over the toggle head in the Arctic and North Pacific regions; nor, do I believe, is there as yet any evidence from these areas as to the relative antiquity of the double versus the single foreshaft harpoon. On the other hand, the evidence suggests to me a regional differ entiation between types: The Siberian and Alaskan Arctic (based on the Old Bering Sea, its relatives and descendants) is characterized by the one-piece toggle head with single spur used on a single foreshaft; the North Pacific area, from possibly an equally remote date, has possessed the toggle head with two lateral spurs, made in two parts (or else possessing the slit reminiscent of the two parts), and it has also possessed the harpoon with two foreshafts. The Dorset harpoons and their Greenland descend ants show such strong affinities with the North Pacific forms as to suggest a common origin, and this common origin must have belonged to a very early period. One thus has the impression that the two harpoon heads in our collection from the Yukon are survivors of old types, and that the affinities of both lie with an ancient North Pacific cultural horizon with which the Dorset culture is in some way linked. In the Northeast, there are also Indian 49* Hewes, 1942, p. 97. 492 Op. tit., p. 98; add: Mathiassen, 1933, Fig. 40. 493 Hewes, 1942, p. 101. harpoon heads which seem to have been in spired by Dorset types, and so, if our hypothesis is correct, they are remote cousins of the Fox Creek head. Thus, the Beothuk Indians copied the heads of the Newfoundland Dorset, as is shown by the sketch made by Shanawdithit, the Beothuk girl. This is a picture of a sealing harpoon with a bone head, equipped with two lateral spurs, a barbed iron blade, and a single (?) line hole.494 The prehistoric Micmac of Nova Scotia seem also to have copied the same Dorset Type 3 head. Smith and Wintemberg publish two antler specimens with lateral spurs, but with conical socket. The specimen with com plete fore end has a blade slit at right angles to the plane of the spurs.495 As we go farther south, we find no direct copies of Eskimo heads but the Indians seem to have added the idea of the toggle harpoon to the conical hollow arrowhead of bone or antler. This type of arrowhead, in its simple original form, is listed by Ford and Willey among the common types of the Archaic horizon all over the east.496 This plain form, with straight base and without a hole in the side, is found in prac tically every Northeastern culture from the New York Archaic to the Iroquois. Variants with the base cut to produce one, two or more spurs (basal barbs) seem to be relatively late and are found, for example, in New York Hopewell, Fort Ancient, Iroquois, and Late New York and Northern Coastal sites.497 Specimens with a spur and a hole in the side are definitely harpoon heads and these were made only by the Iroquois. Those with a hole at right angles to the plane of the spur are like heads used by the protohistoric Central and Greenland Eskimo for fishing.498 The other Iroquois form with line hole in the plane of the spur is unlike any head from the eastern Arctic, but the medial position of the spur reminds us of open socket Dorset heads (and also of Japa 494 Howley, 1915, Sketch VIII. 496 Smith and Wintemberg, 1929, PL XX, /, 2, p. 34. 496 Ford and Willey, 1941, p. 333; cf.

The Dorset open socket head has, however, not been reported south of north western Labrador and the Hudson Bay islands, so that I hesitate to ascribe direct Dorset in fluence to this Iroquois form. Conical antler arrowheads with a plain un unspurred base and a hole in the side were made by some Fort Ancient groups as well as by the Iroquois. Mills believes that they were used as harpoon heads, and although it is difficult to see how the plain base could have caught in the wound, Mathiassen mentions an Eskimo specimen of this form from a Thule site in Baffinland and suggests that it was used to harpoon salmon trout.499 Since these harpoon heads are all late and since they lack specific Dorset features, we cannot say that they were copies of Dorset types. They were, I believe, inspired by the harpoon heads used by the post-Dorset Eskimo who frequented the Gulf of St. Lawrence in late prehistoric and early historic times. DETACHABLE BARBED HEADS WITH TANG Jette describes a Tena harpoon arrow with head barbed symmetrically on both edges for hunting beaver and pike, and a fish spear with detachable head barbed symmetrically on both edges or barbed only on one. Osgood reports that the Ingalik used harpoon arrows and fish spears equipped with detachable heads barbed only on one edge. However, we found no archaeological specimens at Tena sites and so we may infer that the barbed head was not very common. Our only specimens come from the "Eskimo" sites at Ghost and Fox Creeks. Three of these are barbed only on one edge (PI. XXVI, 5, 7, 8); the fourth is barbed asym metrically on both edges (PL XXVI, 6). The line holes are medially placed. Since I have already discussed the distribu tion of detachable barbed heads at some length,500 I will need only to point out some specific resemblances to the Yukon specimens and record additional data. Detachable barbed heads with tang seem to be lacking entirely from the Old Bering Sea,501 Birnirk and Punuk 499 Cf. Mathiassen 1927, II, p. 20, with: Mills, 1904, Fig. 34; 1917 b, Fig. 78; 1906, Fig. 35, p. 52; Beauchamp, 1902, Fig. 108; Parker, 1922, PL 40, 5 (hole not complete). A specimen with a transverse line hole and with two small holes in the side at the base was found in a shell heap on outer Cape Cod (information from Douglas S. Byers). 500 de Laguna, 1934, pp. 189 ff. 501 It is not certain whether any of the specimens from cultures. A careful study of the Dorset collec tions in the National Museum of Canada has convinced me that I had exaggerated the im portance of the detachable barbed head in the Dorset culture. Some specimens do occur, and in all but a few cases the line holes are medial.502 I know of only one specimen which is barbed only on one edge. Detachable barbed heads were of even less importance in the Thule culture, and the few examples found were symmetrically barbed. They may well have been copies of Dorset types. The Kachemak Bay culture was the only old Eskimo culture in which detachable barbed heads were used in great numbers, and we must note that they be came relatively more important in the Third Period than in the First, as compared to the numbers of toggle heads with socket. Among the modern Eskimo the center of distribution of the detachable barbed head lies in southern Alaska. Thus Nelson writes.503 From the lower Kuskokwim northward [read: From Cape St. Elias northward] to Kotzebue Sound spears used for taking salmon and whitefish have large points of bone, deerhorn, or ivory, with from one to three barbs. They are pierced near the butt for the attachment of a cord, and at this end are of a rounded wedge shape for insertion into a slot in the end of a long wooden shaft. Those which he illustrates on Plate LXVIII are, however, not particularly like our Yukon speci mens. The wider area in which such heads are used runs from the Salish (Coast and Interior), through the Northwest Coast, includes the Carrier, Eyak and Tanaina, reaches across to the Kuriles and Japan, and also includes the Koryak, although relatively few specimens are known from Kamchatka. In the Northeast, detachable barbed heads with tang first appear in the Laurentian, Laurentian-Archaic, and Red Paint shell heaps in Maine.504 Had not all bone material rotted in Okvik were detachable, a few may have been (Rainey, 1941 a, Fig. 13, 5), and I suspect that they are intrusive in the Old Bering Sea collection. 602 Symmetrically barbed, medial line hole (Jenness, 1925, Fig. 6 b,j; Holtved, 1938, Fig. 9, 16 and ? 17), sym metrically barbed, lateral line hole (Mathiassen, 1927, I, PL 62, 1; and ? Rowley, 1940, Fig. lj); asymmetrically barbed, medial line hole (Jenness, 1925, Fig. 9 g), barbed on one edge, shouldered tang to hold line, no hole (Howley, 1915, PL XXIII, 24). ?03 E. W.

Barbed heads are common in later shell heaps in Maine and the Maritimes, but appear rarely in Late New York Coastal sites, perhaps because the game for which they were used did not live so far south or because the New York tribes did not try to hunt it.505 The head barbed on one edge was also used by the Point Peninsula Indians and was probably passed on by them to their relatives who left the Intrusive Mound culture in Ohio. The detachable barbed heads with poorly finished butts, found at the protohistoric Fort Ancient site at Madisonville (but not at earlier sites of this culture), probable represent the degenerate survivals of this tradition.506 The Iroquois took over the barbed head from the Algonkians, and in the historic forms? large, clumsy, with a single powerful barb?507 we see how complete has been the transforma tion from the delicately multi-barbed Dorset heads, which were, I believe the original prototypes. Heads barbed asymmetrically on both edges (like PL XXVI, 6) are known from Kachemak Bay I to III, but are more common in Prince William Sound. They are also known from Port Moller on the Alaska Peninsula and from the Aleutian Islands. Modern specimens are very common in Alaska.508 One has been reported from Kamchatka; others have been found in Japan, on the Kuriles, and from the modern Koryak.509 The Thompson (Interior Salish) use them with arrows for small game.510 They are known archaeologically from the Delta area 506 Northern Coastal (H.

" Teit, 1900, Fig. 222 g. in California.5111 have already mentioned some asymmetrically barbed heads from the Dorset Eskimo. This type is rarely found in the North east. We can, indeed, cite only a few detachable heads barbed on both edges from the east. These are a few specimens from the Nevin Red Paint shell heap, a Micmac specimen from Merigomish in Nova Scotia, and four specimens from New York (probably Iroquois).512 This is in striking contrast to the development in the Northeast of the detachable head barbed on one edge or to the fixed point barbed sym metrically on both. The remaining heads from Fox and Ghost Creeks are all barbed on one edge (PL XXVI, 5, 7, 8). This type belongs to the northern Alaskan Eskimo (where it is rare), to Port Moller, the Aleuts, Eskimo of Kodiak Island, Kachemak Bay I to III, and Prince William Sound, and to the Tanaina, Carrier, Eyak, Tlingit, Haida, Coast and Interior Salish, and to the Indians of northwestern California. It was used also by the Koryak, but I have not yet seen any examples from the Ainu.513 With the exception of the Koryak specimens which are quite different from any of the American forms, all of these specimens resemble the Kachemak Bay and Prince William Sound style much more than they do those of the Yukon, so we must place the latter as rather divergent examples of the widespread type. The Yukon specimens differ in having centrally placed line hole, conical tang (PL XXVI, 8) and, in one case, a ridge about the tang (PL XXVI, 7). The symmetrically placed line hole is more com mon among Eskimo specimens north of the Alaska Peninsula than among specimens from farther south, so it is natural that our Yukon heads should have this feature. The conical tang is also more common in the north than in the south. The ridge about the top of the tang 511 Gifford, 1940, NN2b on p. 233. 6i2 Nevin shell heap (information from Douglas S.

Nelson pub lishes specimens with this ridge from St. Michael, Cape Nome and Norton Bay, only.514 Practically every specimen from the North eastern area, with the few exceptions already noted, are barbed on one edge and have a wedge-shaped tang, pierced for attachment to the line. The hole may be centrally or laterally placed. I think that the flat, wedge-shaped tang is the older form, and that the conical tang has been adopted by the Alaskan Eskimo from the fixed arrowhead. Two more ancient specimens may be men tioned for comparison with our "Eskimo" Yukon examples. These are the two heavy bone heads, barbed on one edge, which were found in the Arvilla gravel pit in the Red River Valley, North Dakota.515 One of these is notched and partially grooved near the upper part of the tang for the attachment of a line; the second seems to have been broken at the butt and reshaped without any obvious means of fastening the line, although a cord could have been looped about the shaft just below the last barb. These specimens must be very old and are probably to be explained as the result of cul tural diffusion from some center near the south ern Northwest Coast. The presence of the detachable barbed head with tang in the Kachemak Bay I and Dorset cultures marks it as an old Eskimo type. It has never been very important among the Eskimo, however, except in southern Alaska where it seems to have developed at the ex pense of the toggle harpoon head with socket. It is also shared by a number of groups in the North Pacific area, and here it is impossible to say whether it is primarily an Eskimo, Indian, or an Asiatic device. We can again note that the ancient distribution of this type distinguishes the Dorset and North Pacific cultures from the ancient northern Alaskan group. The specimens from the Yukon belong in particular to the local styles found on the coast near the mouth of the river, and may be considered as late in form. In the east, the detachable barbed head of the Dorset Eskimo was adopted by the Laurentian-Red Paint group of Indians and from them was passed on to a number of later Indian tribes. SOCKET PIECE AND ICE PICK The socket piece in two parts (PL XV, 20, 614 E. W. Nelson, 1899, pp. 147 f., PL LVII b, 16-18, 20. 516 Jenks, 1932, PL 18 a and b, c and d, pp. 456 ff. 21) seems to be restricted to the Tena and to the Pacific Eskimo and Aleut. It is known from Kachemak Bay I to III, Kodiak, the Aleutian Islands, and Port Moller on the Alaskan Peninsula.516 Its occurrence on the Yukon seems to mark the northernmost extent of its dis tribution, and we might expect to find it among the Eskimo of the Yukon-Bristol Bay area, through whom it probably traveled to reach the Tena. The Tena specimens tentatively identified as ice picks are too fragmentary to permit of com parison with other specimens. Of those from Fox Creek, one (PL XXV, 1) has no specific resemblances to Eskimo forms, while the other, which unfortunately lacks the tang (PL XXV, 3), might be compared with the Old Bering Sea Types 1, 2, or 4, the Punuk, or Thule types.517 It also resembles specimens from Kachemak Bay I and III.518 Ice picks of various sizes are common in the Dorset culture.519 This implement is thus an ancient and universal Eskimo type, being lacking only on the Aleu tian Islands, where the mild climate makes it unnecessary.520 Within the Arctic and sub Arctic area it is also common among tribes other than the Eskimo, the Indian groups of particular interest to us being the Sekani, Carrier, Shuswap, Dogrib and other northern Athabaskans of the Mackenzie area, and the Chipewyan.521 It is probably only an accident that Osgood did not report it from the Kutchin, since these Indians catch fish through the ice in winter. Indeed, an ice pick of some kind is essential to northern winter life, and must have been among the fundamental types of the Ice-hunting horizon. It is, of course, quite impossible for us to say whether the Fox Creek specimens were hafted to the butt end of a harpoon shaft or whether they were attached to separate handles of their own, as described by Jette and Osgood.

The Tena arrowheads of this kind (PL XV, 1, 2) are very crude, and so are hard to compare with more highly finished specimens. As far as they have any definite character, we may describe them as long slender pins, roughly triangular in section, with a pointed butt or a scarfed tang. A somewhat similar specimen was found in Kachemak Bay III.522 The arrowheads of Prince William Sound are somewhat flatter, but the lack of a distinct tang puts them in the same class. Collins has published a toy arrowhead from the Old Bering Sea or Punuk culture that is also similar to the Tena specimens,523 and this type seems to have survived on St. Lawrence Island into modern times. Thus, from the protohistoric period Geist and Rainey publish "sharp, slender points of bone and ivory" as arrowheads,524 and a war arrowhead that is triangular in section, 17.5 cm long, with conical tang.525 War arrowheads from the historic period are of bone or ivory, with triangular section, and a detached wedge shaped or conical tang.526 In the same horizon are other forms of bladeless and barbless arrow heads. Nelson also figures a modern head from St. Lawrence Island with a triangular section and butt flattened for hafting,527 as well as spatulate forms.528 Barbless and bladeless arrowheads are known from the Birnirk sites near Point Barrow, but these either are carved with a wide spade-like point to suggest a hafted blade, or else have detached conical tangs, and so do not resemble very closely the Tena forms.529 Most of the Canadian Thule culture arrowheads are not very much like the Yukon type530 although a rather poorly made head from King William Land, made of a hollow leg bone splinter, with scarfed tang,531 resembles our Plate XV, 2. A specimen from the same site, published as a bodkin,532 resembles our Plate XV, 1.

These points are like cylindrical pins.536 The Atna of the Copper River make blade-like arrowheads.537 It is not until we reach the Coast Salish, however, that we find examples really comparable to the Tena specimens. From the lower Fraser River, Smith publishes a group of long bone points for spears or large arrows.538 These have flattened hexagonal, sub-triangular, or diamond-shaped sections. These bone speci mens are analogous to the slate awl-like arrow and spear points found in the Coast Salish, Prince William Sound and Kachemak Bay III cultures, and this suggests that the slate points may be indirectly connected in some way with the type of bone arrowhead which we are dis cussing. Archaeological specimens from the southern California coast, shaped like bone pins with slightly detached conical tang, may well have been arrowheads.539 Among Chukchee arrowheads we find slender points with triangular sections and wedge shaped butts, as well as other types with pointed or bifurcated bases.540 A Koryak arrow head of mammoth ivory has a slender point with triangular section, but a bifurcated butt.541 The arrowheads of the Yukaghir are said to resemble those of the Chukchee.542 We find a closer approach to the Tena type in the arrowheads of the Ainu. Thus Hitchcock fig ures a specimen of bone or bamboo from Hokkaido543 that is very similar to our Plate XV, 2.

Some bone arrow heads from Neolithic Manchuria are barbless and bladeless, though none approach the Tena specimens very closely.545 The bone arrowheads of the Shang Bronze Age of China fall into four main types:546 (1) The first are leaf shaped, slightly facetted and narrowing to a simple conical tang, and were used in hunting. (2) The second are rather stubby, with a heavy fore end, triangular in section, and narrow to a cylindrical shank and a detached conical tang. One of these has a Punuk-like decoration of lines and spurs, such as is found on Punuk harpoon heads.547 (3) The third are for archery, and have a heavy blunt point, flat on one side and rounded on the other, and a detached conical tang set off by a pair of shoulders. (4) The fourth are plain bone pins with simple (not detached) conical tangs. It is these last which resemble the Tena speci mens most closely. Finally, from Kola Bay there are three slender bone pins, without detached tangs, triangular in section except for the hollow on one surface that has apparently resulted from the natural hollow of the bone used for manu facture.548 These are very similar to our Plate XV, 2. This distribution is perhaps sufficient to show the age of this simple type. Birket-Smith has written:549 In the last chapter we came to the conclusion that arrow heads of bone, without barbs, can hardly be assumed to be a type which has developed independently among the Eski mos. The archaeological material available to me has been much too small to give any idea of the diffusion and genetic circumstances of this element. Bone arrow heads without barbs have, however, been used by the Nootka and have been found by Harlan I. Smith's excavations at Thompson and Lower Fraser Rivers. In Asia we have this type from the Ainu, southern Manchuria, and the region around Tobolsk. It is also known from northern Russia and from Norway?the latter from both Iron Age finds at Varanger Fjord, which are believed to have come from a Lapp fisher 544 Baba, 1936, PL V, 2, 3,18,19, 37, 38. 645 Torii, 1913-1915, PL XIII and Fig. 20, 35. 546 Creel, 1937 a, PL VII; specimens in ROMA; informa tion from James Mellon Menzies. 547 Cf.

Birket-Smith, 1929, II, p. 149. population, and from the Epipalaeolithic (formerly so called "Arctic") Stone Age. I can only add that a number of simple bone weapon points have been found in the Magle mosian.550 These are a plain point wTith circular section and scarfed or wedge-shaped tang (Clark's Type 1), a point with triangular sec tion and somewhat detached tang (Clark's Type 13), a point with long cylindrical shaft and en larged conical head (Clark's Type 16), and a point with rather long cylindrical shaft and ex panded, flattened fore end, lanceolate in shape (Clark's Type 17). The first two are, therefore, very similar to the Yukon specimens. Pre sumably these Mesolithic bone points are derived from the hafted pin-like weapon points of the Upper Paleolithic. I believe now that many of the specimens which I described as "bone pins" (from Kache mak Bay I to III, Port M oiler, Kamchatka, Japan, Interior and Coast Salish) were really arrowheads.551 Many of these specimens are broken in the way that characterizes the "simple bone points" of the Maine and Nova Scotia shell heaps, which Tyzzer has argued were arrowheads.552 However, I doubt whether any one explanation will suffice for this large group of artifacts. In the Dorset culture, for example, there are a number of heavy bone pins, probably hafted. Some of these may have been arrowheads, others barbs for the side prongs of fish spears, others may have served still different functions.553 It is impossible to discuss the Tena bone arrowheads with barbs without also referring to the barbed points for multipronged spears or arrows and to that particular style of point for arrow or larger weapon to which I have given the not very satisfactory name of "slender barbed point." These three varieties of barbed points are all alike in that they are fixed to the weapon shaft and are thereby distinguished from the barbed heads which are detachable (See "Detachable Barbed Heads"). This classi fication can be only typological, since we cannot say with assurance whether the straight barbed points with rigid attachment, the barbed points 650 Clark, 1936, Fig. 41. 651 de Laguna, 1934, p. 197. 652 Tyzzer, 1936. 553 Fish spear barbs, Coats and Mansel Islands (NMC IX C-455), Cape Dorset (IX-C-235). Arrowhead, Cape Dorset (IX-C-236).</page><page sequence="211">204 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 for multipronged weapons, or the detachable barbed heads, were shafted to arrows to be shot with bows, to darts to be thrown with a spear thrower, or to spears to be thrust with the hand. Guesses based according to the size and weight of the head are only guesses. The fixed barbed points found at Tena sites are all barbed along one edge, and have from 2 to 10 barbs. At Fox Creek we obtained one specimen that was barbed on both sides (PL XXVI, 2), but since it is only a small fragment which does not show the method of attachment, we shall not discuss it further. The majority of the remaining specimens were most probably arrowheads, like those of the Eskimo and Kutchin.554 I do not think that a discussion of "bone arrowheads barbed on one edge" would be very helpful, since their distribution would include almost the whole world, and the type, as thus defined, does not take into account the smaller variations in style which character ize the weapons of different cultures. I shall mention, therefore, only those specimens from adjacent areas which are similar in style to the Yukon examples. Two arrowheads from Fox Creek (PL XXVI, 3, 4) fall in a class by themselves, and appear to be far more Eskimo in character than any of the others. They have a flattened, blade-like point, lanceolate in outline, with almost straight edges, and are furnished with a de tached conical tang. Birket-Smith and I found, in Prince William Sound, a somewhat similar specimen, which might be classed midway be tween these two heads and a more slender specimen, also from Fox Creek (PL XXVI, 26). The flat shape, almost parallel edges with abrupt point, and the detached conical tang of modern arrowheads from Kowak River, St. Lawrence Island, and Norton Bay,555 are all features which characterized the two Fox Creek heads. Protohistoric specimens from the Mackenzie Delta are also rather similar.556 The profile of protohistoric heads from Cape Smythe557 also reminds us of the Fox Creek specimens, although the Cape Smythe heads have more deeply cut barbs and the tangs have knobs. The hook-shaped owner's mark on our Plate 654 Osgood, 1936, pp. 68, 83. 656 E. W. Nelson, 1899, PL LXI, b, 11,12,10. 666 Mathiassen, 1930 a, PL 1,17,18. 657 Wissler, 1916, Fig. 26 c (except for barb at tip), Fig. 27 a-d (except for stone blades). XXVI, 4 is similar to a mark on arrowheads from Point Barrow and Cape Smythe.558 The same mark is also found on the barbed arrow head with blade slit, also from Fox Creek (PL XXVI, 9). Owner's marks are found on barbed arrowheads of the Canadian Thule culture and modern Alaskan Eskimo culture,559 and may be a trait brought into Alaska by the return of the Thule culture. They were probably derived ultimately from the rather simple, but un standardized designs found on barbed heads of the Old Bering Sea culture,560 since the latter could also have served to identify the owner of the arrow. Among the Eskimo from the Kuskokwim to Kotzebue Sound, including those of the lower Yukon, these owner's marks have gained a significance apparently not found among the northern Alaskan Eskimo. Nelson believed that they formed "a regular system of totem marks," and that these south ern Eskimo had totemic patrilinear gentes.561 These marks are supposed to represent such animals as the wolf, gyrfalcon, raven, etc., and are put on "carvings, weapons, and implements of almost every description. On clothing or wooden utensils it may be marked with paint."562 Nelson also figures the socket pieces for sealing darts that do not have such simple geometric figures, but that are carved to repre sent the whole body of the "totem" animal.563 In addition to carving or marking personal be longings, "It is said to have been the ancient custom for all to wear some mark about the dress by which the gens of each person might be distinguished." It is significant that in the ex amples cited, Nelson mentions that these distin guishing features of the dress consisted of parts of the skin of the animal in question.564 "It is customary for hunters to carry about with them an object representing their totem." And again the object is a part of the "totem" an mal or bird.565 In a few specific cases, Nelson mentions that the mark represents an animal that the owner, or his ancestor, had killed under lucky circumstances, or an animal to 558 Op. cit., Fig. 32 a, and Fig. 35, eighth from left on top row.

Among the Eskimo, almost all amulets are associated ex clusively with hunting, and it is natural, therefore, tha,t they and their signs should be inherited from father to son. Nelson was incor rect, it now appears, in believing that these marks indicated a totemic sib organization. Knud Rasmussen has shown, however, that the so-called "totem marks" are nothing but ownership marks, although they gradually attain something of the character of an amulet through their descent from generation to generation. Even though people with the same amulet may not marry, this can scarcely be called totemism, and certainly not sib organization. There is, of course, the possibility that we have here an incipient sib system. Kroeber (1923) suggests a similar origin for the Northwest Coast crest and moiety system.667 It is naturally impossible to say whether the marks on the Fox Creek arrowheads were any thing more than simple ownership signs or whether they had acquired the character of inherited amulets. In any case, the arrowheads are of modern Alaskan Eskimo type. It is not quite clear what relationship these arrowheads have to other Eskimo types. The conical tang, it is true, is a feature which be longs to Old Bering Sea, Birnirk, Thule, and southwestern Alaskan arrowheads and which has lasted into modern times in Alaska.568 However we ought to note that there are four styles of conical tangs: Type 1, a simple conical sharpening of the butt (Old Bering Sea, Birnirk, Punuk, also found on the slender barbed points of Kachemak Bay I to III and of protohistoric sites in northern Alaska); Type 2, a, detached conical tang, more or less abruptly separated from the shaft of the head, as on our Fox Creek arrowheads; Type 3, sl conical tang with a bulge or ridge part way down the tang (Punuk, Thule, Birnirk). Col lins calls this a "shouldered tang"569 but it is not to be confused with the shoulders setting 666 Dog bone carried as amulet and sign representing it used in place of previous "totem" mark, because man killed game with dog bone when starving (op. tit., pp. 325 f.). Red bear adopted as "totem" mark because man had killed one (p. 326). 667 Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, pp. 448 f. and note 1 on p. 449. M8 Collins, 1937 a, pp. 323 f. 669 Op. tit, p. 324. off the tang of Type 2; Type 4, a conical tang with knobs. Collins writes:570 the shouldered tang [(Type 3) is] the original Thule form, derived from Alaska, and the knobs [Type 4] a later feature which appeared after the Thule culture had become estab lished in the Central regions. The predominance of knobbed tangs at the later sites in North Alaska would be explained as being one of the numerous elements introduced into that region by a late return migration of Thule peoples from the eastward. The detached conical tang [Type 2] is found in the Old Bering Sea culture,571 but it is not as frequently encountered as the simple tapering tang [Type 1]. All of the ridged and knobbed tangs of later periods seem to be more or less detached, though usually not as sharply as on the Fox Creek specimens, or the Prince Wil liam Sound and the modern Alaskan examples figured by Nelson with which we have com pared them. Similar sharply detached tangs are found on a Haida arrowhead,572 and on some prehistoric Ainu specimens from the Kuriles.573 All of these reflect, therefore, the persistence of a tradition which must date back at least as far as the Old Bering Sea period. In respect to the tang, the return of the Thule culture from Canada has not affected the Yukon arrow heads. The flattened blade-like shape with straight edged profile seen on the Fox Creek arrow heads is quite distinctive, and cannot be very old, since it is not found in early horizons. Thus, the Old Bering Sea barbed arrowheads are round or oval in section, and the Punuk barbed arrowheads are triangular in section (like the plain bone arrowhead from the Shang Bronze Age of China, already mentioned because of its Punuk-like decoration). Most Canadian Thule arrowheads are rounded-triangular in section, and those that are flattened are much longer and more slender in profile than the Fox Creek ones.574 We can, of course, find a few specimens analogous to the Fox Creek heads in older Alaskan sites, for a late Old Bering Sea or Early Punuk arrowhead with small notch-like barbs on both edges is flattened,575 but the peculiar combination of characters exhibited 670 Ibid. bllOp.tit.,V\.34,6. 672 NMC IX-B-304. 673 Baba, 1936, PL V. 674 Cf.

Not all the barbed points from the Yukon were arrowheads. Some of the Tena (PL XV, 19 and perhaps 17) and "Eskimo" specimens (PL XXVI, 27-31) were probably intended as points for multipronged arrows or spears. They would have been similar to the bird spears with three end points (each point barbed on one edge, with sharpened butt) illustrated by Nel son from the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Nuni vak Island, and Norton Sound,576 or to the fish arrows with from one to three unilaterally barbed end points, also from the same area.577 This type of arrow or dart for fish or birds is used also by the Aleut and by a number of Eskimo tribes farther east (the Mackenzie [?], Copper, Caribou and Labrador Eskimo), by the southern Northwest Coast tribes (Kwakiutl, Nootka, Makah, Puget Sound Salish and Twana), and by the Klamath, Modoc and Yurok of California. Birket-Smith also reports it from the Kutenai, Virginia Indians, Gilyak and Anadyr Russians.578 He believes that it is older than the more typically Eskimo bird dart with central end point and three side prongs part way down the shaft, and that the latter was brought into Canada by the Thule culture.579 This would mean that the bird dart with side prongs was unknown to the most ancient Canadian culture (Dorset and/or Caribou Eskimo). Fixed barbed points are common in the Dorset culture, and while the style of the barbing is reminiscent of that on Old Bering Sea bird dart side prongs, the shape of the butt suggests a different method of hafting. I have no doubt that most of them were for leisters.580 Both bird darts and multi pointed leisters were present in the Old Bering Sea, Birnirk, Punuk, and Thule cultures. The Ipiutak had the bird dart and may have had the leister also.581 Both types have been found 676 E. W. Nelson, 1899, PL LIX, 1-6. Osgood (1940, p. 201) also makes this comparison, and reports that the Ingalik used them with the spear thrower. 877 E. W.

It is natural that it should have survived in an area which is peripheral to the Eskimo cul ture and to which the newer bird dart with side prongs did not penetrate. Doubtless many of the fixed points, barbed on one or both edges, which have been found in the Northeast, were prongs for leisters. They are known from shell heaps in Nova Scotia and Maine, including the Red Paint site at Taft's Point, although they are more common in the upper (Northern Coastal) than in the lower (Red Paint) layers. They are common on Iroquois sites, where Wintemberg ascribes them to Algonkian influence, and belong to the Owasco, Point Peninsula, and probably to the Laurentian. They are also found in the Intru sive Mound culture of Ohio.583 Of all these, those from the Northern Coastal sites are most like Eskimo specimens, suggesting their derivation from Eskimo culture, but they suggest a gen eralized Eskimo rather than a specifically Dorset style. Multipronged darts or spears for fish and birds are typical of the Maglemosian, which testifies to their antiquity.584 The barbed bone and antler arrowheads or leister prongs from Tena sites and most of those from Fox Creek seem to be related in style to the slender barbed points of Kachemak Bay, especially to the type which first appeared in the First Period and became typical of the Third Period on Yukon Island.585 The speci mens from the Yukon Valley exhibit a greater range of shape than do those from Kachemak Bay, chiefly because they are more poorly made.

However, certain specimens (Pis. XV, 9, 10;XXVI, 24,25) might almost have come from Kachemak Bay.586 I have argued that the prototype of these slender barbed points was an ancient Alaskan type, probably derived from an amorphous form like that represented by the barbed points of the Coast Salish.587 Such simple slender points with barbs along one edge are, of course, older than any North American culture, and are undoubtedly derived from the Upper Palaeo lithic, probably via the Maglemosian or an analogous Mesolithic stage. Many of the so called "harpoons" of the Algonkians and Iroquois are really arrowheads comparable to those of the Yukon Indians and southwestern Alaskan Eskimo. A few features characteristic of the Yukon slender barbed points may be discussed. Several specimens of Yukon Island Types I and III from Fox Creek have a notch just above the tang, probably to facilitate attachment of the binding (PL XXVI, 23, 25, 26). Similar notches are found on the slender barbed points of Yukon Island Type I from Kachemak Bay, on some specimens from the Coast Salish, and also on the large barbed war or whaling lance heads of the Aleut.588 Similar notches are found on Old Bering Sea leister prongs and appear as a purely decorative feature on the butts of Old Bering Sea, Birnirk, and Punuk side prongs for bird darts. They have even been transferred to Birnirk type harpoon heads where they could have served no possible function.589 One of the Tena slender barbed points has a detached wedge-shaped tang (PL XV, 13). 586 Cf. de Laguna, 1934, PL 42, 16, 19. The detached conical tang is common on Hrdlicka's Kodiak specimens. 687 de Laguna, 1934, p. 193. The slender barbed point has since been found in the Ipiutak culture (Rainey, 1941 b, PL III, 11). 588 Kachemak Bay (de Laguna, 1934, p. 91, PL 42, 16), Salish (USNM 209705 from Salt Spring Island, British Co lumbia, with four barbs, two notches and plain conical tang like our PL XXVI, 23, but more slender), Aleut (de Laguna, 1934, p. 192). 589 Leister prongs (Collins, 1937 a, PL 33, 18, 19), side prongs for bird darts (op. tit., PL 35, 5, 6; PL 74,1; UofPM 29-90-314), harpoon heads (Collins, 1937 a, PL 27, 2; J. A. Mason, 1930, PL V, 6, 7,11,12). This feature is found on some modern barbed arrowheads from the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta and from St. Lawrence Island.590 Wedge shaped tangs for arrows are, however, rare if not entirely absent from older Eskimo cultures in Alaska, so that their appearance among modern and protohistoric specimens in south ern Alaska must be ascribed to outside influ ence. Arrowheads with this type of tang are known from the Quinault and the prehistoric Kurilian Ainu.591 The longitudinal lines bordering the row of small barbs, present on some of the Yukon specimens, are typical of the Kachemak Bay slender barbed points. They are also found on some Old Bering Sea specimens identified as side prongs for bird darts and on Ipiutak speci mens published by Rainey as arrowheads. One of the latter is a typical Yukon Island III type, the other has side blades.592 These lines are, I believe, related to the method of cutting the barbs on Old Bering Sea arrowheads. These, and some of the arrowheads of the Ipiutak and Birnirk cultures, differ from the arrowheads of other Eskimo cultures chiefly in the profile of their barbs, which are long and slender, and lie close to the shaft of the arrowhead.593 I suggest that the longitudinal lines of the slender barbed points have been derived from the long cuts in making barbs, although the barbs themselves have shrunk in size. A style transitional between the two is illustrated by an archaeological dart point or arrowhead from Birnirk which has decorative lines trailing up from the undercutting of the barbs, and, curi ously enough, some of the Old Bering Sea arrow heads from Okvik have not only long trailing cuts but longitudinal lines suggesting an early form of the bordering lines.694 From Fox Creek there are two arrowheads with blade slits, presumably to accommodate triangular slate blades. One of these (PL XXVI, 10), without barbs and cut off abruptly at the butt, is identical with the larger type of barbless 590 E. W.

Some specimens from Kamchatka and the Kurile Islands are made entirely of bone, carved to represent the inserted blade.596 Some ceremonial bone arrow heads from the Shang Bronze Age of China, supposed to be copies of bronze forms, have a long conical tang (for hafting in a bamboo fore shaft) and a pair of large barbs.597 The bulge of the tang is carried up to form a decorating ridge on each surface of the head, and the whole shape suggests that of a peg-shaped point in which is hafted a triangular blade with concave base forming barbs. Though the immediate proto type of these ceremonial arrowheads may have been of bronze, the bronze forms themselves were probably copied from plain bone heads with triangular slate blades. We have shown that blades of this shape are also known from the Shang period (see discussion above, on page 175). This hypothetical prototype would have been just like the bone Yukon specimen (PL XXVI, 10) if furnished with a blade like those of our Plate XXVI, 38 or 39. The sym metrically barbed iron arrowhead of the Chuk chee is perhaps another copy of this type.598 Among the Eskimo, bone arrowheads without barbs but with end blades, go back to Old Bering Sea times,599 and seem to be a widely distributed type, though almost all are longer and larger than the Yukon and Kachemak Bay III specimens. We might also add that the Basketmaker darts and Pueblo arrows had a wooden head ("foreshaft") with blade slit and detached conical tang, and so are quite similar to the Eskimo forms. The shaft was a hollow reed into which the wooden head and wooden butt were fitted. The other arrowhead with blade slit from Fox Creek (PL XXVI, 9) has two small inef fectual barbs on the same edge as the notch above the tang. It seems to be related to the flattened lanceolate barbed but bladeless heads from the same site (PL XXVI, 3, 4) rather than to the slender barbed arrowheads which we have compared with the slender barbed points. 695 de Laguna, 1934, PL 41, 16, 17. 698 Op. tit., pp. 193 f.; add: Torii, 1919-1921, Fig. 74. 697 Creel, 1937 a, pp. 97 f., PL VII; Andersson, 1923, p. 97. 898 Bogoras, 1904-1909, Fig. 74 m. 699 Collins, 1937 a, PL 34,1. A modern head from the lower Yukon Eskimo, with one barb and a triangular slate blade, is rather similar.600 While barbed arrowheads with blades form a very old and widely distributed type, dating back to Old Bering Sea and Ipiutak times,601 there are no other Eskimo specimens that seem to have quite the same combination of features as the Yukon head. Farther south it was often the slender barbed point which received the blade in a slit at the end,602 and the Kurilian barbed arrowheads without blade were of a similarly slender pat tern.603 Osgood reports the barbed arrowhead with blade slit from the Ingalik Tena, and the illustration is more like the slender barbed point than like the Fox Creek specimen. Thus, these slender arrowheads seem to be closely related to the North Pacific rather than to the northern Alaskan forms. The Fox Creek head appears to be a local variant of a modern Alaskan type. The blunt arrowhead for birds is well repre sented in our Tena collection (PL XV, 5, 6, 7) and since it is commonly used by the Eskimo of the lower Yukon and the Yukon Delta Norton Sound area604 it is only by accident that we failed to obtain a specimen from Ghost or Fox creeks. Collins did not find blunt bird arrowheads until the Punuk stage and believes that the distribution of this type in northern Eurasia (Chukchee, Koryak, Samoyed, Yuka ghir, and Finns) marks it as an element of the Snowshoe culture.605 Rainey, however, reports the blunt bird arrowhead from the early Old Bering Sea site at Okvik, and while these speci mens may have been intrusive from the Punuk culture site near-by, the decoration on some suggests Old Bering Sea style.606 Curiously enough this type of arrowhead has never been very common in the Thule culture. The typical bird arrow with expanded blunt point was found only at the oldest and most westerly site of the 800 E. W.

In all his extensive archaeological explorations, Mathiassen did not find any, and the only reference to its use in Greenland seems to be the report by Hans Egede, on which the passage quoted from Mathiassen is based. Nor was the bird arrowhead very important among the Central Eskimo, and Mathiassen can cite only two references, one from Stefansson for the western Central Eskimo, one from Turner for the Labrador Eskimo. One suspects that the blunt bird arrowhead died out in the Canadian Thule culture and was re-adopted by certain modern Central Eskimo tribes from the Indians. I do not know how we are to account for its appearance in the eighteenth century among the Greenlanders. It is lacking in the Dorset culture, and in the culture of the Aleut Pacific Eskimo and in Eyak culture. It is used by the Kutchin, Tanaina, Carrier and Quinault, but among these Indians the head is not a separate bone piece but simply the blunt, ex panded end of the arrowhaft itself.609 The Tlingit and Copper River Atna (see the ap pended table) use blunt bone heads. Archaeo logical bone specimens from central and south ern California, interpreted as arrowheads for birds, have a laterally placed tang.610 The Basketmakers also had blunt-headed darts. Unfortunately our Tena specimens are all broken at the butts. Provided our interpreta tion of the broken specimen (PL XV, 6) is correct we can say that they had a wedge shaped tang, sometimes pierced by two holes for attachment to the shaft. Osgood reports a wedge-shaped tang with notches from the Ingalik. In other cases we suspect that the tang was conical. We did not find a single example of the type which is made like a bone cap with a 607 Mathiassen, 1927,1, PL 84,8, with scarfed tang. ??* Op.cit.,II,p.50. 609 Kutchin (Osgood, 1936, p. 68), Tanaina (Osgood, 1937, p. 90, PL 8 G), Carrier (Morice, 1894, Fig. 29.

The same is true of the heads used by the Copper River Atna (Allen, 1887, PI. 17). The richest variety of bird arrowheads seems to be found among the Eskimo south of Bering Strait and north of the Aleutian Islands, but this may be only an impression due to the fact that Nelson's report is fullest for these groups. Our present information is insufficient to indi cate the relative ages of the simple and com pound points and of the conical, scarfed and bifurcated tangs. BOWS AND TRAPS The bow with projecting wooden string guard, like that photographed at Nenana (PL III, 1), ought to have been represented in our archaeological material. It seems to be restricted to the northern Athabaskans, except for speci mens traded from them to the Northwest Coast Indians or made by the latter as copies of the traded bows.612 It has, however, tended to yield ground to the sinew-backed Eskimo bow, as on Cook Inlet, where the latter has completely supplanted it in Kachemak Bay,613 and on the Yukon itself, where Jacobsen found the bow with guard restricted to the upper Tena.614 It is unfortunate that our material could give us no clue as to whether the bow with guard was ever used on the lower Yukon; it is not described by Osgood. We do know, however, that the sinew-backed bow was used in modern times on the lower Koyukuk, for its presence at Kateel is proved by the bone piece used for strengthening the sinew-backed bow (PL XVI, 12) and Osgood has reported it from the Ingalik. Nelson de 612 Niblack, 1890, p. 286. 613 Osgood, 1937, pp. 86 f., 89. 614 Jacobsen, 1884, fig. on p. 193. scribes this type from the Yukon Eskimo as "a strip of bone, flat on one side and grooved on the other. It is intended for use as a strength ener to be inserted under the sinew backing of a bow."615 The specimen illustrated, is, how ever, much longer and thinner than ours. Forms similar to the Kateel pieces were used by the St. Lawrence Island Eskimo in Punuk616 and protohistoric times.617 They do not date back to the Old Bering Sea culture, and Collins argues that the sudden appearance of bow bracers and sinew twisters, as well as of other types as sociated with bows, such as the wrist guard, blunt bird arrow, and plate armor, shows these items to have been adopted by the Punuk Eskimo from Siberia, where they are all widely distributed. The blunt bird arrows and the wrist guard show borrowing from a Snowshoe hunting culture, but a form of the Showshoe stage that was particularly war-like. In view of the fact that wrist guards, new types of ivory arrow heads, and bow braces and sinew twisters?adjuncts of the sinew-backed bow?also appear for the first time in the Punuk stage, it would seem that we have to deal here with the introduction of a complex of elements connected with warfare, the most important of which was plate armor. The sudden appearance of these elements might indicate either the intrusion into northeastern Siberia of a hostile group or a gradual northward diffusion of armor and im proved means of warfare.618 Of these items with which the Punuk culture was enriched, the Tena seem to have taken over the sinew-backed bow with its bone strength ener (perhaps the sinew-twister, although we did not find any specialized tool of this type and it is not mentioned by Osgood), the blunt bird arrow, and possibly the wrist guard, though we cannot be sure of this because Andrew Pilot's explanations were very vague. They did not take over plate armor. The blunt bird arrow, of course, may have come to the Tena and to the Punuk (or Old Bering Sea?) Eskimo originally from different sources, and this is not unlikely since the forms of the arrowheads were different for the two cultures (see "Bone Arrowheads") and the Tena culture as a whole belongs to the Snowshoe hunting stage.

Similar braces of bone or wood were used by the Chukchee,619 and of fossil rhinoceros horn by the Yukaghir.620 With the exception of the Eyak, we know of no other North American tribe who used the set bow or spring bow as did the Tena (PL XVI, 5, trigger), and since it is widely used in northern Asia, we may assume it was introduced among the Tena and Eyak by the Russians.621 A hook similar to that from Kateel (PL XVI, 6), but with a very much longer and more slender shank, was found in the Old Bering Sea horizon on St. Lawrence Island, and was tentatively identified by Collins as part of a snare.622 The modern St. Lawrence Island Eski mo use similar notched stakes in setting snares for eider ducks, and they are also known from protohistoric times on the island.623 A set of hooks found in a prehistoric Chugach burial cave may also have been used for snares or traps.624 Hooks were used for marmot traps by the Sekani,625 for marmot deadfalls by the Tanaina,626 and by the Quinault for a combina tion pit and pole snare for deer and elk.627 A similar hook is used by the Hokkaido Ainu in rigging the set bow for bears.628 FISH SPEARS, FISHHOOKS, AND NETS Barbs for the side prongs of salmon spears, collected from Tena sites (PL XV, 22, 23) are much cruder than those made by most Eskimo, with the exception of the Kachemak Bay I to III Eskimo, who made barbs very simi lar to those of the Tena.629 In discussing the distribution of this type, I have stated that the pinlike bone barb which was attached to the two outer prongs of the three-pronged fish 619 Bogoras, 1904-1909,1, p. 153, Fig. 70 b. 620 Jochelson, 1926, p. 384. 621 Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, p. 429. 622 Collins, 1937 a, PL 57, 7. 623 Geist and Rainey, 1936, p. 120, PL 29,10; PL 47, 7. 624 Birket-Smith and de Laguna, field-notes, 1933.

The type seems to date back to the Old Bering Sea culture, though Collins is not very certain of the identification.631 The specimens in question are of the very primitive type represented by our Tena and by most southwestern Alaskan examples, in that they have only a groove and shoulder to hold the lashing. Lashing holes, so characteristic of modern Alaskan and Canadian Thule speci mens, seem to appear first in the Punuk cul ture.632 However, it is possible that some very similar specimens from the Old Bering Sea period, identified by Collins as prongs for blub ber hooks, may have been barbs for fish spear side prongs. These have round or slotlike holes; the barb for the Ipiutak fish spear has a slotlike hole, as do specimens from Okvik.633 We must, therefore, consider the possibility that both the hole and the groove were already used in the Old Bering Sea period. Side prongs with slotlike holes and specimens without holes seem to have been used by the Dorset Eskimo.634 Some of the bone pins found in pre historic Algonkian sites in the east may also have been barbs for fish spear prongs. Fish spears with attached barbs were used by the Kutchin, Carrier, and Interior Salish.635 I was in error when I said that they had not been reported from the prehistoric Coast Salish, for Smith636 mentions, from the lower Fraser shell heaps one short bone point . . . slightly flattened at the base, which is cut off diagonally, suggesting that the object had been set in a prong of a fish-spear and used as a barb like that now employed on the three-pronged fish-spear of the Thompson River region.

Of course, we cannot be sure how they were hafted. The Tena fishhook (if our identifications are accurate) had a straight wooden shank with a straight wooden or bone point (barb) lashed on or inserted into the shank at an acute angle (PL XIV, 34, 35). Osgood does not describe this plain V-shaped fishhook from the Ingalik, but only a highly modified form. The V-shaped hook is distributed from the Northwest Coast to Greenland and belongs to all periods of the Kachemak Bay culture, to the Old Bering Sea, and to the Canadian Thule culture (as a gull hook).642 In the Punuk period this type de veloped into a hook with a single shank and four bone points (barbs), the points themselves being either plain or barbed, but the older type of simple V-hook continued in use into modern times on St. Lawrence Island and at St. Michael.643 The V-shaped hook with barbed point (barb) is also used by the St. Lawrence Island Eskimo, 637 Central California (Heizer and Fenenga, 1939, Fig. 1, 18, transitional period; also early ?, p. 390, description not clear), southern California (specimens in AMNH, SBM, SWM; cf. larger examples of Gifford, 1940, types Tib, Tlh, T2bl, T2c, UI, 2, 3 on pp. 176 ff.). 638 de Laguna, 1934, p. 196, PL 40,8. 639 Torii, 1913-1915, PL XIII, described as an awl. 640 Collins, 1937 a, PL 75, 1, 2, 3. 641 Heizer and Fenenga, 1939, Fig. 1, 15, 16: Gifford, 1940, larger examples of types WI, 2, 3 on p. 224 and types 001 and 2 on p. 233. 642 Mathiassen, 1927, II, p. 55 (cf. also references to Cen tral and Greenland Eskimo); de Laguna, 1934, p. 94, PL 43, 16-19; Collins, 1937 a, p. 172, PL 56, 3. 643 Punuk: plain (Collins, 1937 a, PL 75, 8, 9), Punuk: barbed (Op. tit., PL 75, 6, 7).

Nelson, 1899, p. 181, PL LXIX, 11). and was the dominant type in Kachemak Bay, Prince William Sound, and on the Aleutian Islands for as far back as we have any record. It is also possible that it was used by the pre historic Coast and Interior Salish, and by many California tribes.644 Three very small barbed bone points from northwest Labrador and southern Baffinland suggest that it was also known to the Dorset Eskimo.645 Otherwise we should find inexplicable the appearance on the Belcher Islands, in Hudson Bay, of fishhooks with slate shank and barbed bone barb.646 The V-shaped fishhook with barbed bone barb was also known to some Northeastern Indian groups, perhaps as a loan from the Dorset culture. Such points have been found in Maine shell heaps, including the Red Paint site at Taft's Point, and in Point Peninsula graves.647 On the Northwest Coast the shank of the V-shaped hook became very much curved, producing the large halibut hook with plain barb, but the simple V-shaped hook was also used, especially on the southern Northwest Coast, and it was probably used also in Cali fornia.648 Other tribes using the plain V-shaped hook were the Kutchin, Carrier, Eyak, Tanaina, Thompson, and Koryak.649 Jochelson reports that the Neolithic inhabitants of the Lake Baikal region in Siberia used "stone hooks for fishing lines, consisting of two pins of mica schist tied together like the compound bone fishhooks of the Aleut and the California In dians."650 644 de Laguna, 1934, p. 196.

From early travelers' accounts we know that the V-shaped hook with plain bone point was extensively used by Algonkians and Iroquois. It has not, how ever, been reported very frequently from archaeological sites,651 but this is probably be cause the curved hook cut from a single piece of bone is the more striking type in the North east, and because the plain bone points of the compound hook could easily be mistaken for fragments of awls. Quite possibly the V-shaped hook with plain bone point belongs to the Ice-hunting culture, just as does the gorge. One curious feature about the distribution of Eskimo fishhooks needs to be explained before we can be sure about their position. Collins reports that the Old Bering Sea collection from St. Lawrence Island con tained some eighty-five sinkers for fishing lines, representing eight or nine types, while only one fishhook was recovered.652 It is possible, of course, that some of the "ivory slivers" classified as awls were really points (barbs) for fishhooks, but if they were not, the numerical discrepancy between hooks and sinkers makes us wonder whether the so-called sinkers were really sinkers after all. Then again, the gorge, which we be lieve belonged to the Ice-hunting horizon,653 ought to have been found in the Old Bering Sea culture, although Collins does not report it. It is possible that here, too, some of the awl-like slivers of bone and ivory were actually gorges. Thus, we really do not know what kinds of fishhooks were used in the Old Bering Sea culture, or even whether the fishhook was an important item. It would appear, however, that the V-shaped hook with barbed barb is only one among several links between the Dorset culture and Kachemak Bay I. Implements connected with the manufacture and use of fish nets represented in our collection are shuttles (PL XVI, 13, XXV, 8), wooden floats (PL XVI, 14-17), bone sinkers (Pis. XVI, 19, 20, XXV, 5), and unworked pebble sinkers (PL XVI, 8-11). The nets themselves were made of the dried inner bark of the willow (see the modern specimen on PL XVIII, 3). 681 Willoughby, 1935, Figs. 121, g-4, r, 125; W. B. Smith, 1929, Figs. 12 and 14.

Lower Amur tribes: hemp or nettles (op. tit., p. 375). Among the Eskimo farther north in Alaska, baleen, sinew and rawhide thongs were used. The earliest Eskimo specimen resembling a netting shuttle is a crude specimen from the Old Bering Sea culture, but it is probably a reel for a fishing line or for sinew cord, not a shuttle for making nets.654 It is generally conceded that the netting shuttle is relatively late in Alaska and that it was introduced from Siberia in protohistoric times along with the net gauge and the tobacco pipe.655 Examples of such modern Alaskan shuttles, published by Nelson from the lower Yukon, Nunivak and Sledge Islands, Norton Sound, Cape Nome, and the Diomede Islands,656 are identical with our Tena specimens (Pis. XVI, 13, XXV, 8). If Jenness is correct in assigning the sealing net to the Thule culture657 it must have been made without shuttle or gauge. My information about the distribution of the net gauge and shuttle is obviously not complete. These implements are recorded from the following tribes: Netting Shuttles and Gauges Chilcotin and Carrier: shuttle and gauge (rectangular frame), (Morice, 1894, pp. 158 ff.). 664 Collins, 1937 a, PL 58, 11. 656 Murdoch, 1892, p. 286. 666 E.

Koryak and Chukchee: shuttle and gauge (both similar to modern Eskimo types), (Jochelson, 1905-1908, II, Fig. 71; Bogoras, 1904-1908,1, Fig. 61). The modern net gauges of the Eskimo, Tena, Gulf of Georgia Salish, Chukchee and Koryak are different from the type common in the American Northwest, since the former are pro vided with handles, while the majority of American Indian ones are rectangular and lack handles. There is thus a suggestion that the plain rectangular net gauge may have come to America before the introduction of the smaller gauge with handle and the shuttle. While the shuttle was more widely diffused, the small gauge with handle did not spread much beyond the Alaskan Eskimo and their Tena neighbors. Barnett is the only author who reports the gauge with handle from any other American tribe. The Tena gauge with handle is illustrated in our Plate XVIII, 4, 8. The wooden or bark floats used with large nets vary somewhat in shape. Sometimes they are simply sticks attached by their ends to the upper edge of the net, as among the Carrier, Klallam, and Klamath.658 Blocks of wood or pendant-shaped pieces of wood with a hole were used by the Chukchee, Eskimo of St. Michael, and the Haida.659 Specimens like our Plate XVI, 15, straight along the edge next the net but convex on the opposite edge, and provided with holes or grooves at the ends, are figured by Nelson from Cape Prince of Wales and by Jochelson from the Koryak.660 While floats of wood or bark are mentioned from the area under discussion they are not usually described 658 Carrier (Morice, 1894, Fig. 97), Klallam (Gunther, 1930, p. 200, one long stick), Klamath (Spier, 1930, p. 152). 689 Chukchee (Bogoras, 19OM909, I, Fig. 43 b), St. Michael Eskimo (E.

Fig. 55 from St. Law rence Island, somewhat similar); Jochelson, 1905-1908, II, Figs. 70 and 85 a). in detail so we cannot compare them with the Tena specimens. Unworked pebbles (PL XVI, 8-11) are used as netweights by the Eskimo at Point Hope, by the now extinct Eskimo of Southampton Island in Hudson Bay, by the Carrier, Haida, Yukag hir (who fasten the pebble in a loop of wood), and by the Chukchee.661 Bogoras writes of the last: "Large pebbles are used for sinkers. They are strung on loops of thin leather, and, having no notch, easily fall off."662 Grooved stone weights are recorded from the Wishram, Quinault, the Klamath and other northwestern California tribes.663 Notched pebbles seem to have been used by the Middle Columbia Salish, to judge by the large numbers of such specimens in private archaeological collections in We natchee, Washington. Grooved and notched stones found in Neolithic horizons at Lake Bai kal in Siberia have been interpreted as net weights.664 The presence of notched stones at archaeological sites in the Northeast, dating back as far as Archaic times, has been generally accepted as proof of the use of nets. While I may have been too extreme in attempting to divorce the notched stone from the net,6651 believe that caution should be exercised in interpreting such notched stones as net sinkers in the absence of confirmatory evidence. Bone netweights are quite common among the modern Alaskan Eskimo. Nelson writes:666 Ivory or bone weights frequently alternate with stone sink ers on the nets, and serve both as sinkers and handles. They vary from five to six or seven inches in length, are more or less curved, and have a hole at each end for fastening them to the net. These are illustrated from Cape Vancouver on the Kuskokwim-Yukon Delta, St. Michael, the lower Yukon, and Cape Prince of Wales.667 Most of them are longer and more slender than our Tena specimens, and even approach in shape the object which we have identified as a handle or bow for a drill (PL XIV, 27).

It is possible, though Collins does not suggest it, that they have developed from the Old Bering Sea and Punuk fish line sinkers of ivory with holes at each end. Bone net sinkers with holes at the end are also known from the Late Punuk.669 A very similar specimen of walrus ivory is figured from the Chukchee.670 The Koryak made sinkers of whale vertebrae with a single hole.671 Although the bone sinker now has about the same distribution as the netting shuttle and small net gauge with handle, in the Northwest it seems to be older than these. We cannot com pare its age with that of the rectangular gauge, for this tool seems to be associated with stone sinkers, usually unworked. Stone sinkers are evidently the oldest type of sinker, and we must ascribe the use of bone and ivory for sinkers to the widespread use among the Eskimo and Chukchee of these materials for manu factures of every kind. The Tena nets and netting equipment reflect very closely those of their modern Eskimo neighbors. Natives at Anvik described catching eels through holes in the ice by means of hooked sticks. During the migration of the eels up the river, many thousands are caught in a few hours. Nelson672 says that the Eskimo of the lower Yukon also catch the migrating eels by means of dipnets or sticks with cross pieces. I do not know the distribution of this type of fishing. We found nothing that could be identi fied as a stick for hooking up eels, although Osgood has described the implement that was used. SHOVELS AND BONE EDGINGS The paddle-shaped wooden shovel of the Tena is probably related to the identically shaped implement used by the Prince William Sound Eskimo.673 It does not seem to have been like the snow shovel of the Kutchin, which had ?68 Collins, 1937 a, pp. 226 f.; PL 75,16. 669 Geist and Rainey, 1936, PL 64,6. 670 Borgoras, 1904-1909,1, Fig. 62 b. ?71 Jochelson, 1905-1908, II, Fig. 70. 672 E.

Jette reports that the Tena also used a wooden snow shovel with broad blade, but since he does not mention a loop handle we must not assume that it was identical with the Kutchin type. The Ingalik shovel used for earth and snow was a plain, broad-bladed type, according to Osgood. The Eyak snow shovel was also made of a single flat board, without a special handle on the blade for the left hand.679 The snow shovel is an element belonging to the Ice hunting stage of culture.680 It is therefore much older, in North America, at any rate, than the paddle-shaped shovel, unless the latter is not an Asiatic importation'but only a special form of digging stick, such as is used by the North west Coast and Northwestern Plateau Indians.681 Even though the Carrier use the same paddle shaped shovel to dig roots and to shovel snow, in general the shovels used for these two pur poses are quite distinct in shape. At Fox Creek a number of bone edgings were found. The edging for a shovel blade (PL XXV, 6) resembles the antler edgings for bone shovels used in the Birnirk682 and modern Point Barrow cultures.683 Such edging was not used in the Old Bering Sea, Punuk, or Katche 674 Osgood, 1936, pp. 71, 76. 676 Morice, 1894, p. 115, Fig. 104. 676 McRitchie, 1892, PL XVII, 10. 677 Bishop, 1926, PL 6, /. 678 Op. tit., explanation of plates on pp. 552 ff. 679 Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, p. 93. 680 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, pp. 112, 199, Tables A 87, and B 56; Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, p. 427. 681 Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, p. 440. 682 J.

Small bone edgings for other uses, like our Plate XXVI, 32-35, are not found in the Old Bering Sea, Birnirk, or Punuk cultures. Mathiassen figures a fragment of antler mount ing with peg holes from the Thule site of Nau jan687 but such edgings are rare in the Canadian Thule culture. They are found in the Inugsuk culture of West Greenland, and are more highly developed in modern West Greenland and Ang magssalik cultures than anywhere else.688 Here they are used as protective edgings for shovels, paddles, the "keel" of the kayak, and as orna mental mountings for wooden dishes, buckets, boxes, eyeshades, etc. Bone mountings seem, therefore, to belong to the Birnirk-Thule cultures, but to have become important only in Greenland. Their modern use at Point Barrow may be ascribed to the westward return of the Thule culture from Canada, but we do not know whether the Yukon "Eskimo" specimens are to be considered as survivals of the old Alaskan edgings, or whether they are due to recent Canadian influence in Alaska. The use of bone mountings in the Birnirk culture was perhaps foreshadowed by the use of ornamental ivory plates in the Ipiutak of Point Hope. From a grave, Rainey recovered a number of elaborately carved and incised ivory plates and button-like pieces which had evidently been lashed (not pegged) to a wooden background, perhaps part of the log coffin.689 These pieces, which suggest a highly conven tionalized anthropomorphic face, have a style reminiscent of the t'ao-t'ieh or "ogre masks," which were carved in marble or carved and painted in polychrome on the wooden tombs of the Shang Bronze Age in China.690 684 Old Bering Sea and Punuk: shovels of walrus scapula (Collins, 1937 a, PL 50, 6; PL 60,12); Kachemak Bay III: shovels of whale bone (de Laguna, 1934, PL 48,11). 686 Mathiassen, 1927, II, p. 67. 688 Jochelson, 1925, PL 26, 36; 1928, Figs. 42 and 44. 887 Mathiassen, 1927,1, p. 79, PL 34,13. 688 Mathiassen, 1930b, PL 18,31, pp. 262 f.; 1933, Fig. 61. 689 Rainey, 1941 b, PL VII. 890 Creel, 1937 a, pp. 67, 106 ff., PL V. BIRCH BARK CANOES The partially decked birch bark canoe (see PL IV, 6) may well have been the original Athabaskan type, in the east replaced by the open and more efficient canoe of Cree type, probably as the direct and indirect result of white expansion in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The older decked canoe in the east seems to have been used more for hunting than for transportation, and its limitations have been graphically described by the explorer Hearne. Birket-Smith believes that the bark canoe, which seems to be associated with the Snowshoe hunting culture, is a specialization, coordinate with that of the Eskimo kayak, from a simple primitive skin boat of the Ice-hunting stage.691 We must note that the Tena also used an open birch bark traveling canoe, and on the return from moose hunts made a temporary open canoe of moose skin. BIRCH BARK CONTAINERS, MATS, AND BASKETS The little box with pegged-on wooden bottom and side of birch bark fastened together by notching and interlacing (PL XVI, 3) is like modern specimens from the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, St. Michael, and St. Lawrence Island.692 They seem to be used chiefly for holding snuff and chewing tobacco and are traded from Si berian natives, especially the Chukchee. The latter, in turn, buy them from the Maritime Koryak or Russianized Yukaghir. They are sometimes ornamented with scratched geo metric designs like that on our specimen. This type of box was probably not made by the Tena and it is not to be expected on prehistoric sites. The folded birch bark baskets (PL II, 4), re mains of which were found in prehistoric and modern sites, are still made by the Tena, and are like those of the Kutchin, Carrier, Interior Salish, etc. A comparison could only be made on the basis of minute stylistic differences. The baskets made by the Ingalik (Anvik-Holo gochaket-Holy Cross Tena) are decorated at the rim with strips of equisitum stalks, woven in and out under the stitches holding the bark to the wooden rim. It is possible that this type of woven checker-board decoration is related to the imbrication found on coiled baskets in the 691 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, p. 172. 692 E. W.

Among the Interior Salish, for example, we find not only the more common type of imbrication in which the decorative element is folded back under each stitch to produce a solid line, but also a simple form of imbrication or beading produced in exactly the same way as on the Tena birch bark baskets. Folded birch bark containers, and indeed the extensive use of bark for many purposes, are associated with the Snowshoe culture.693 The twined grass mats used as shrouds by the Tena (Pis. XIX, XX) are identical with those used by the prehistoric Prince William Sound Eskimo for the same purpose. In both cases, the twining slopes up from left to right.694 Aleutian grass mats used for shrouds are very similar, except that the mats are finer and are often decorated with false embroidery, strands of contrasting shades, and tufts of whiskers, etc. The direction of the twining in most cases is, however, downward from left to right.695 The grass mat figured by Nelson from Norton Sound as typical of the sleeping mats used by the Eskimo from the Kuskokwim to Kotzebue Sound696 seems to be identical with the Tena and Prince William Sound specimens, and was made with a continuous woof element. These Eskimo mats might vary from 4X3f feet to twice that size. Evidence of twining dates from the Punuk period. This is a fragment of a grass bag (?), with the twining sloping up from left to right; the only unusual feature is that the warp is double-twisted.697 Osgood reports that the Tanaina made grass mats, but gives no description of their manu facture.698 Since they made twined baskets and were in contact with Eskimo who made twined mats, it is probable that their mats were of the same type. The Indians of the Northwest Coast were, of course, expert at twining, and we may regard their blankets of mountain goat wool as a highly specialized development, while the grass mats of their northern neighbors reflect the earlier and more primitive form. Cedar bark mats made by the more southerly tribes of that area were woven, not twined.

On the whole, it is reasonable to assume that the motor habits producing upward-slop ing stitches in twined baskets would produce similar twining in mats, and we may therefore turn to the former for hints as to which direc tion in twining seems to be the older. In her study of twined baskets (distinguished from other twined articles), Weltfish writes:707 All twined basketry in North America is manufactured mouth up, with the exception of Aleut and Haida basketry, which is manufactured mouth down, the Aleut suspended, the Haida set on a stake. The lean of the stitch is downward [from left to right] in the twining of the Northwest Coast area, in the finer twin ing of the Porno, including all the women's work, in some examples from Pit River tribes and the Klamath-Modoc, and in some of the Iroquois twined specimens. The lean of the stitch is upward in the twining of northern California, the Basin-Shoshoni, and the Southwest areas [I have seen some Basket Maker bags with downward twining], in the coarser twined work of the Porno, which is made by men, 699 Teit, 1898-1900, Fig. 131. 700 Olson, 1936, p. 85, Fig. 29 b. 701 Spier and Sapir, 1930, pp. 191 f. 702 Information from Alan G.

Stitches leaning downward and stitches leaning upward are found together on the same basket in specimens from the Qua michan, a Salish tribe of Vancouver Island. Specimens illustrated by Mason from the Salish and Nootka have upward stitches. Prehistoric twining from Lovelock cave has upward stitches, while prehistoric twining from southern Cali fornia caves may slope in either direction.708 While the evidence is not conclusive, one has the impression that twining upward from left to right is older than downward twining, and that the Eskimo and Tena mats are old-fashioned in this respect. Kroeber believes that:709 "woven and perhaps twined baskets, mats, and weirs" belonged to the culture of the first immigrants to the New World. From Siberia, we note clumsy twined (?) mats from the Chukchee.710 Twined mats were made by the southern Koryak and Kamchadal, and the stitch of their twined bags, at any rate, was upward.711 Jochelson has also excavated prehistoric Koryak and Kamchadal pottery with imprints of twined baskets or textiles.712 Prehistoric Jomon pottery from northeastern Honshu, made by the Ainu, has twined textile (matting?) impressions, with upward stitches.713 The clothing of the modern Ainu figured by McRitchie seems to be made of twined matting.714 The twined bags made by the Kuri lian Ainu have an upward stitch; those of the Hokkaido Ainu a downward stitch.715 On the Kuriles and Hokkaido the Ainu wrap the corpse in a grass mat before inhumation.716 Creel re ports of the Chinese in the Shang Bronze Age: There is some indication that the corpse was wrapped in matting before burial.717 The use of grass mats for shrouds is thus a trait linking the Tena, Southwestern Eskimo, Aleut, Ainu, and Bronze Age Chinese, while the manufacture of twined mats probably belongs to a wider cultural setting. * Op. tit., p. 4:90. 7&lt;&gt;9Kroeber,1923,p.2.

The twined bags made by the Tena (PL XXI, 1) are quite similar to those of the Eskimo in the Kuskokwim-Norton Sound area,718 and also like some of those already cited from the Ainu. I have already mentioned evidence that the twined bag dates back to the Punuk period on St. Lawrence Island. In default of further data it is impossible to say whether it was an item of ancient Eskimo culture, or whether it is a comparatively late borrowing from the highly developed center of twining on the Northwest Coast. It is safe to assume the latter hypothesis for the twined baskets of the Chu gach and the Aleut. The coiled baskets of the lower Tena are like the coiled grass baskets of the Kuskokwim Norton Sound Eskimo, although the Tena specimens are made of stiffer materials. Coiled spruce root baskets are figured by Nelson from the Eskimo of the lower Yukon and Sledge Island and seem to be restricted to this area.719 Coiled baskets are made by the modern Central, Labrador, and West Greenland Eskimo, and a small specimen of straw was found in the mummy caves of Qerrortut, Julianehaab Dis trict, southern West Greenland, dating from the sixteenth century. They are thus a wide spread Eskimo element.720 They are probably very old, and must either have been carried east by the Thule migrations, or have belonged to the Dorset culture. The Eskimo and Tena coiled baskets are identical in shape with the coiled grass baskets of the Kurilian Ainu, which again are almost identical with grass specimens made by the Koryak and Kamchadal.721 A circular tray of coiled grass, like one of spruce root which I purchased at Anvik, is said to have been made by the Ainu in imitation of Japanese lacquer trays. Some of the Koryak baskets are made of willow root, and those illustrated by Jochelson are identical in shape and style with Tena speci mens purchased at Anvik and Hologochaket. Jochelson points out the resemblance between Koryak baskets and those of the "Tinne, who, as Mason supposes, taught the Alaskan Eskimo to weave."722 Again, some of the Koryak baskets 718 E. W.

Montandon (1937, p. 105) says that the Kurilian Ainu copied coiled basketry from their northern neighbors, and that it is rarely made by the more southern Ainu. 722 Jochelson, 1905-1908, II, 634, Fig. 158.</page><page sequence="226">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORT$ AMERICA 219 are made by sewing together the coils of a wide flat braid,723 like a type described by Osgood from the Ingalik. This technique also suggests that of the coiled grass mats made of braid, apparently limited to the lower Tena (Anvik, Hologochaket, Holy Cross), and to the lower Koyukuk (the specimen seen at Koyukuk Station may have been traded from the lower Yukon). The distribution of basketry tech niques suggests that "coiling was the older basketry technique which was entirely sup planted on the Northwest Coast and partially displaced in the neighboring areas," although Wissler holds the opposite opinion.724 But whatever the history of coiled baskets, there is no doubt that those of the Eskimo, Tena, Koryak, Kamchadal and Ainu are closely re lated. BAG HANDLE The bag handle made from an animal rib (PL XIV, 27) is similar to modern specimens from St. Lawrence Island, used as bucket handles. One, found in a modern house ruin on the island, is, however, larger, being made of walrus rib,725 and another specimen is described as shorter and straighter, and has notched ends. From St. Michael, Nelson describes "specimens, made from walrus ribs, of a class of implements which serve a double purpose; they are used as sinkers and as handles for hauling in the seal or beluga nets."726 These are also much heavier than our Tena specimen. The bag handles illustrated by Nelson are of about the same size and weight as our object, but all are elaborately decorated. Similar handles of wood, bone, and ivory, plain or decorated, belong to the Old Bering Sea, Birnirk, Dorset and Thule cultures, and in fact may be considered as a universal Eskimo type.727 It is possible that our Tena specimen is a bow for a drill, not a handle. SPOONS, DIPPERS, AND WOODEN VESSELS It was not surprising to find spoons and dip pers in Tena and "Eskimo" sites on the Yukon 723 Op. cit., II, Fig. 164. 724 Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, pp. 417 f.; Wissler, 1917, pp. 50 f. 725 Geist and Rainey, 1936, pp. 107 f., PL 23,1. 726 E.

They have been found as far back as the Old Bering Sea culture in Alaska728 and seem to belong to the Ice-hunting stage.729 The specimen from Bonasila (PL XIV, 28) resembles most closely a modern spoon from the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta,730 that from Fox Creek (PL XXVI, 11), sl wooden spoon from the lower Yukon and an antler spoon from the Kuskokwim Delta, except that both of these are decorated in the bowl.731 The wooden dipper with decorative groove in the bowl (PL XVI, 4) was probably like a dipper from the lower Yukon, although the latter has a painted decoration in the bowl,732 while the fragment from Kateel is too small to show whether or not it had such a decoration. The modern Tena spoons from Nulato with cut out grip resemble in a general way Eskimo speci mens from the Kuskokwim-Norton Sound area,733 although the former lack the realistic paintings of the latter. Wooden dishes, with and without inlays were purchased at Anvik (PL XXII, 7, and an identi cal specimen without inlays) and a wooden dish without inlays was seen on the Tanana (PL XXII, 9). Stone inlays for dishes were found at Tena and "Eskimo" sites on the lower Yukon (Pis. XIV, 45, XXVI, 17). Nelson writes:734 The Tinn6 of the lower Yukon, adjoining the territory occu pied by the Eskimo, are expert in woodworking. They fashion from spruce large numbers of wooden dishes, buck ets, trays and ladles, which they ornament with red and black paint, and the maker usually places his totem mark on each utensil. [See the discussion of owner's marks in the section on "Bone Arrowheads".] They make trips down the river for the purpose of selling their products to the Eskimo, and travel as far as St. Michael on the seacoast. In addition to this trade with the Eskimo, the articles manufactured by these people are distributed over a much greater extent of territory by means of intertribal trading among the Eskimo themselves. Besides the ware of this kind obtained from the Tinne\ the Eskimo make similar articles themselves, which are as a rule equally well made. A dish with inlays, identical with the Anvik specimen (PL XXII, 7), is figured by Nelson 728 Collins, 1937 a, PL 51,13-16; PL 47,16, p. 166. 729 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, pp. 142 f.

A plain dish in the author's possession, also from Anvik, has a trace of a black border painted over the red stain, although this is so badly worn that no details of the pattern can be seen. Probably many of the Tena dishes had the same kind of Northwest Coast animal designs that were made by their Eskimo neighbors. Dall mentions that the Eskimo of Nunivak Island inlayed their wooden dishes with lozenge-shaped pieces of gypsum.736 The inlaying of wooden dishes apparently dates back to the Old Bering Sea culture, for Collins publishes a fragment of an oval (?) wooden bowl with three small pits in the rim, probably intended for baleen insets, and an ivory vessel with a row of tiny pits around the rim, probably for small baleen pegs.737 Baleen insets have always been very popular with the Alaskan Eskimo, from the Old Bering Sea period to the present, and have been used especially to represent animal eyes.738 In dis cussing the eye motifs so common in Old Bering Sea, Chinese Bronze Age, and modern North west Coast art, Collins has commented on the fact that these eyes are often enhanced by in lays.739 The Chinese of the Shang Bronze Age used turquoise and mother-of-pearl inlays quite frequently in bronze and bone work, not only for eyes, but for other elements in the decoration. The woodwork of their buildings was inlayed with carved pieces of boar's tusk.740 Turning back to North America, we can note a small oval ivory inset from Kachemak Bay III.741 On the Northwest Coast, inlaying was highly developed. Dishes and boxes were usually inlayed with shell, especially with the small oval opercula.742 Inlays of shell, bone and copper were common on wooden and bone objects. Other areas in North America where inlay work attained some importance in art are 735 Op. tit., PL XXXII, 8. 736 Dall, 1878, p. 23. 737 Collins, 1937 a, PL 51,12; PL 54,5, pp. 166,170. 738 de Laguna, 1934, p. 208. 739 Collins, 1937 a, p. 298. 740 Creel, 1937 a, pp. 100 f., 119, 67. 741 de Laguna, 1934, PL 51, 1. 742 Niblack, 1890, p. 316, Pis.

The development of inlaying in this northern region may well be due to in fluences that spread from China at a very early period. Perhaps related to the inlay is the small button-like ornament that is sewn or lashed on. Collins has compared the ornaments of this type from the Old Bering Sea culture with the similarly attached, small animal figures of Bronze Age China and the Iron Age of central Europe.743 Very beautifully carved animal and bird figures of ivory were made by the Dorset Eskimo, but it is not clear whether these were all pendants or whether some of them were fastened on to objects.744 Pegged-on animal figures are, of course, familiar from Angmags salik. Wooden bowls and dishes without inlays have a very wide distribution and are elements of the Ice-hunting horizon.745 BIRD BONE TUBES Bird bone tubes were found at Tena sites (PL XIV, 41) and at Fox Creek (PL XXVI, 12). These may have been needlecases, beads, handles, or drinking tubes. I have already discussed the distribution of the birdbone needlecase (or fishhook case).746 This is found among tribes from Japan to Greenland and Newfoundland, and in time extends back to the Dorset, Thule, Punuk, and Kachemak Bay III cultures. It would not sur prise us, therefore, if our Yukon specimens were needlecases. However, we did not find any bone needles and we are not sure whether the Tena used needles. Osgood mentions needles of cari bou bone from the Ingalik Tena, but does not tell us whether they had eyes, and, indeed, his whole discussion of sewing emphasizes the use of the awl. However, a Tena informant told us that he had found bone needles at a site on the Innoko River, and it is difficult to imagine how 743 Collins, 1937 a, p. 306. 744 Jenness, 1925, Fig. 7 *; NMC IX-B-276 (Labrador); IX-C-106, 107, 193, 264 (Cape Dorset), 118 (Mansel Is land); Mathiassen, 1927, I, PL 62, 13.

It will be safe, however, to assume that needles were not common among the Tena and that they were probably rare or even absent among the groups remote from Eskimo influence, since the Kutchin above them on the Yukon know only awls. On the other hand, it is possible that some or all of the Yukon bone tubes were drinking tubes. The drinking tube is a widely distributed element in Indian and Eskimo cultures. Among the Eskimo it is a utensil of everyday use; among the Indians it is almost always of ritual char acter, and, as among the Ingalik Tena, it is most frequently used by adolescent girls during their puberty seclusion.747 The corpses at the Birnirk culture site near Point Barrow were all provided with wooden drinking tubes, as well as with baleen dishes filled with food, thus prov ing the antiquity of the drinking tube among the Eskimo.748 The bird bone tubes were all found at modern sites on the Yukon, so it is possible that they were used as snuff tubes, since such receptacles are used for snuff by the modern Alaskan Eskimo.749 Osgood has mentioned the use of swan bone tubes as handles for birch bark baskets among the Ingalik Tena, which suggests another inter pretation.750 It is always possible, of course, that the tubes were used as beads. STONE MORTARS Several of the naturally shaped stone vessels (PL XXI, 2, 4) may have been used as paint mortars, since Osgood describes such specimens from the Ingalik. A stone mortar was found in Kachemak Bay, unfortunately of uncertain age. It was too large to have been a paint mortar and may have been used for crushing berries, as were wooden mortars made by the Prince William Sound Eskimo.751 Bone and stone mor 747 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, pp. 61,143 ff., Tables A 18 and B 12; Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, p. 419; Osgood, 1940, p. 408. 748 J. A. Mason, 1930, pp. 312 f. 749 E. W. Nelson, 1899, PL XC. 750 Osgood, 1940, p. 135. 751 de Laguna, 1934, PL 18, 4; specimens in WSM from Prince William Sound. tars were also found in Prince William Sound.752 The Tanaina of Cook Inlet used stone mortars for paint,753 as sometimes do the modern St. Lawrence Island Eskimo.754 Stone mortars were used on the Northwest Coast for paint and tobacco.755 The distribution of stone mortars on the Pacific coast, in the Plateau area, and in California has been summarized by Birket Smith.756 I need only add that the collections in the Santa Barbara Museum show that the mortar was in use on the southern California coast from the earliest days of which we have archaeological record. Stone mortars were used by the Chukchee, Koryak, Kamchadal, Ainu of the Kuriles, and by the Neolithic inhabitants of Japan (Ainu ?) and Mongolia.757 The Tena and the modern St. Lawrence Island Eskimo thus stand on the fringe of the circum-Pacific dis tribution of stone mortars. In view of the an tiquity of these specimens in the Old World and in the New we can hardly explain the dis tribution as due to recent diffusion, though it is possible that the stone mortar did not appear in south Alaskan Eskimo and in Tena culture until quite recently. TOP It has already been suggested that a speci men found at Yukon Willow Creek was part of a top. Birket-Smith has shown that the top is one of the elements of the Ice-hunting stage.758 It belongs to the Old Bering Sea, Punuk, Thule, and Kachemak Bay III cultures.759 Wooden tops were used as children's toys by the Ingalik Tena, Kutchin, Tanaina, and Eyak, to men tion only a few tribes.760 The Chilcotin, however, used similar wooden disks as whorls for spindles in making rabbit skin blankets,761 and since the Tena are said to have made similar blankets it is possible that 762 Birket-Smith and de Laguna, field notes 1933. 753 Osgood, 1937, p. 117. 754 Geist and Rainey, 1936, PL 35, 6. 7W Niblack, 1890, p. 281. 766 Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, p. 412. 767 Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, p. 412; add: Ainu (Baba, 1936, PL II, 19, 22, 30), Japan (Munro, 1911, pp. 133 ff.; Higuchi, 1930, fig. on p. 90 from Ehime Province), Mongolia (Torii, 1913-1915, p. 47). 758 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, pp. 205 f.; Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, p. 480. ?

Ill, Fig. 102.</page><page sequence="229">222 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 our specimen is a spindle whorl and not a top. The spindle was used by the northern North west Coast tribes in spinning mountain goat wool, and by the Coast Salish for dog wool. Nelson has published an implement from St. Lawrence Island said to be used for twisting sinew thread; it has a heavy part like a spindle whorl or a top, which, however, is held in the hand, not allowed to whirl.762 Heavy ivory parts of a similar type date from the Old Bering Sea culture on the island, but Collins thinks that they were parts of toy "spindle buzzes" like those of the Chukchee, Kerek (Koryak), and Greenland Eskimo.763 The question as to whether the Eskimo had anything like a spindle for twisting sinew thread, therefore, remains obscure. I doubt whether our Tena specimen was a spindle. ARTICLES OF PERSONAL ADORNMENT Three types of combs were apparently used by the modern Tena: the comb carved from a single piece of bone or antler (PL XIV, 38, 39); the composite comb of separate teeth lashed to cross bars, as described by Osgood from the Ingalik; and the wooden comb with separately inserted teeth (a variant of the composite comb), such as was purchased by Jacobsen from the Tena.764 The two one-piece combs in our collection were both found on modern Tena sites, but it is possible that this type was made by the pre historic Tena, since it is an old and widespread type among the Eskimo. The simple rectangu lar comb seems to be the fundamental Eskimo type, from which various local patterns have been derived.765 It dates back to the Old Bering Sea and Thule cultures, but has not yet been reported from the Dorset or Birnirk.766 The only specimen which might be interpreted as a Dorset comb is a two-pronged object made from a bear canine, and it could be described more aptly as a hair pin than as a comb.767 However, a number of Northeastern Indian cultures, which we know or suspect to have been in fluenced in one way or another by Dorset Eskimo culture, have combs. Thus the Beothuk 762 E. W. Nelson, 1899, pp. Ill f., Fig. 31. 763 Collins, 1937 a, p. 176, PL 46, 9, 10. 764 Osgood, 1940, p. 290; Jacobsen, 1884, Fig. 10, on p. 197. 765 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, p. 95, Table A 65. 766 Old Bering Sea (Collins, 1937 a, PL 58, 10; and Na tional Museum of Norway, 29155), Thule (Mathiassen, 1927, II, pp. 113 f.). 767 NMC IX-C-451 from Coats or Mansel Island. of Newfoundland768 have true combs, the shape of which seems to have been derived from Birket-Smith's Type 3, with "rather short and wide handle which tapers off towards the end and likewise tapers over the teeth," and which is slightly constricted in the middle of the handle.769 This type is especially characteristic of the Central Eskimo, and this makes us suspect that, like other traits with localized Canadian distribution, it may have belonged to the Dorset culture. However, it is doubtful whether it belongs to the earliest Dorset culture but was probably taken over from the Thule culture by a late Dorset group. In any case, such a comb was found at Naujan,770 which indicates it was one of the forms known to the Thule culture. It is probably only coincidence that the comb from Bonasila exhibits a similar constriction at the middle of the handle (PL XIV, 38). Bone combs with incised decorations reminiscent of Dorset, Thule, and Beothuk art are found in the shell heaps of Maine,771 and in the Point Peninsula focus of the Vine Valley aspect of New York.772 The decoration on these specimens suggests indirect contacts from Dor set and Thule to Beothuk and Northern Coast al, and from Beothuk to Point Peninsula. Bone combs, especially with projections at the ends of the handles, sometimes carved into animal shape, belong to the Laurentian-Archaic cul ture of Frontenac Island in New York, to the Intrusive Mound culture of Ohio, and to the prehistoric and historic Iroquois.773 This form of decoration is not found on Eskimo combs, and so must have been derived from some other source. Plain bone combs with suspension hole were found at the late Fort Ancient site at Madisonville, and fragments of bone points, like the teeth of combs, have been found in Hopewell cremations.774 Birket-Smith also re ports the one-piece comb from the Cherokee and Rappahannock.775 If we return to western North America we 768 Howley, 1915, PL XXVII, 35-39. 769 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, p. 95. 770 Mathiassen, 1927,1, pi. 52,13. 771 Willoughby, 1935, Fig. 123, h, i; W.

It is not found among the Eskimo south of the Aleut, and was apparently not common among the latter.776 Combs were carved from caribou hoofs by the Tanaina at the head of Cook Inlet,777 but their relatives farther down the Inlet as well as the Kachemak Bay Eskimo lacked one-piece combs. Moose hoof combs were also made by the Atna of the Copper River.778 The Crow River Kutchin carved combs of antler, but, ex cept for these, only combs made of the back bone of a fish were known to the Kutchin.779 It is possible that the Crow River Kutchin copied the one-piece comb from their northern Eskimo neighbors, and that it spread from them to the Atna and the Upper Cook Inlet Tanaina, but our information from the Athabaskans is insufficient to indicate the age or origin of this type. The bone comb is doubtful for the Eyak, but beginning with the Tlingit the true comb is distributed down the Northwest Coast, and into the interior, to the Coast and Interior Salish, Sahaptin, Chinook, Coeur d'Al&amp;ne and Okanogan.780 The comb seems to be a fairly recent type among the Carrier.781 That the one-piece comb of the Eskimo is re lated to that of the Northwest Coast seems fairly certain, but it is hard to explain the gap in its distribution in southwestern Alaska. It is always possible that one-piece combs of wood were made by the Pacific Eskimo and that these have not survived. The one-piece combs made by the interior peoples of the Northwest must be ascribed, I believe, to influence from the Northwest Coast. It is also hard to explain the gap in its distribution between the Thule Eskimo of Canada and some of the archaeologi cal cultures of the Northeast. It is too soon to say whether any of the one-piece combs in the Northeast were due to Eskimo influence, but if such influence was felt by the Indians we would have to explain it by the theory that the later Dorset Eskimo (of Labrador and Newfound land) borrowed the comb from the Thule Eski mo, since the comb does not seem to belong to the Dorset culture as we know it. The one-piece comb with long rectangular 776 Jochelson, 1925, Fig. 63. 777 Osgood, 1937, p. 53. 778 Birket-Smith, 1929, p. 187. 779 Osgood, 1936, pp. 42, 45 f. 780 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, Table B 44; Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, pp. 401 f. 781 Morice. 1894, p. 117. grip is known from Kamchatka,782 and the Ainu of the Kuriles and Hokkaido.783 Birket-Smith also records the one-piece comb from the Yukaghir, Gilyak, Tungus, Yakut, Yeniseians, Ostyak, etc.784 It goes back at least, to the Chou Bronze Age in China, and to the Ertebolle in Europe.785 The wooden comb with separately inserted teeth, collected by Jacobsen from the Tena, is probably a local variant of the composite comb, or Stabchenkamm. The Ingalik type described by Osgood is of the usual pattern made by tying the separate teeth together. It is possible that Jacobsen's specimen is a composite comb that has been influenced by the one-piece comb. The composite comb has a curious distribution, and one which suggests that it may have been the older type in the New World that was re placed in the north by the one-piece type. Birket-Smith has studied its distribution and finds it common in South America. The center of its distribution in North America is on the Northwestern Plateau, where it is made by the Molala, Nez Perce, Sanpoil and Nespellem, Spokane, Thompson, Middle Columbia Salish, Coeur d'Alene, Shuswap, Okanogan and Lillouet. It is also known from the Aleut and Angmagssalik Eskimo.786 It seems to have been the earlier type used by the Carrier.787 Ohyama believes that it was made by the Neolithic (Jomon) Ainu of northeastern Honshu.788 Since it was made by the Aleut, we ought to expect it from the Pacific Eskimo, especially since they seem to have lacked the one-piece comb. Several fine wooden pins, found in a pre historic Chugach burial cave on Prince William Sound, may, indeed, have been teeth for such a comb.789 The isolated occurrence of the com posite comb in East Greenland is hard to ex plain unless we admit that this type was known to the ancient Eskimo, and we wonder, there fore, whether it did not belong to the Dorset culture. If we may place the composite comb in both the ancient Pacific Eskimo and Dorset cultures, we will have this type shared by Dorset, Southwestern Eskimo, and possibly 782 It must have been rare here since it is reported only by Nakayama (1934, PL VIII). 783 Torii, 1919-1921, PL XXXII, /, 2,3, pp. 157 f.; Baba, 1936, PL III, 6, 7, 10 and especially 15. 784 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, Table B 44. 785 Specimens in ROMA; Clark 1936, Fig. 55,3. 786 Birket-Smith, 1937, pp. 33 ff. 787 Morice, 1894, Fig. 106. 788 Ohyama, 1930, p. 38. 789 Birket-Smith and de Laguna, field notes, 1933.</page><page sequence="231">224 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 ancient Ainu cultures, while the one-piece comb belonged to the Old Bering Sea, Thule, North west Coast cultures, and their derivatives. This suggests again the division between the north ern Ice-hunting and North Pacific (with Dor set) horizons, with the northern one-piece comb later supplanting the cruder composite comb in most of the North Pacific area. However, we must not overlook the possibility of independent invention of parallel forms. In any case, the Tena, like some of the interior people farther south, possess both types. Pendants from the Yukon were of two types: shaped bone (PL XIV, 37) and animal tooth (PL XXVI, 19, 21). Both shaped and tooth pendants belong to the Punuk culture, but are absent from the Old Bering Sea.790 With this exception they are found all over the Eskimo area, and in all Eskimo cultures, though the shapes have varied from place to place and from period to period.791 They are of such wide distribution throughout all the areas that we have been considering that it does not seem necessary to comment further. Buckles were also found on the Yukon. The small flat Tena buckle or amulet for the pack line, with central hole and dot design (PL XIV, 33) is similar in proportions to a specimen figured by Nelson from the lower Yukon Eski mo.792 The decoration of the latter consists of lines with alternating internal spurs and of tree figures, both elements which appear in Tena art. Dot designs, like those on our specimen, are typical of the Eskimo and will be discussed in the section on "Art." A buckle with two (?) holes, found at Fox Creek (PL XXVI, 18) is rather similar to a specimen from Prince William Sound.793 But tons are obviously related to the types of buckles under discussion and these are a com mon Eskimo type, being one of the few articles of personal adornment that was found in the Old Bering Sea culture.794 It will be remembered that a number of un worked incisors from the lower jaw of the rein 790 Collins, 1937 a, p. 305, PL 82. 791 de Laguna, 1934, p. 203. 792 E.

These were probably decora tions on a woman's belt. Nelson describes such belts, on which have been sewn overlapping sections of caribou mandible containing the incisors. The buckle is a bear tooth or plate of carved ivory. These belts were worn by Eskimo women from the Kuskokwim to the Arctic.795 Jacobsen purchased a specimen at Anvik.796 Dentalium shells were received by the Tena through intertribal trade in prehistoric times. They were highly prized as ornaments. They came originally from Washington or Oregon, and were traded into the interior, south to northern California, and north to the Kutchin, the Eskimo about Bering Strait (via the coast?), and the Eskimo of the Mackenzie Delta (via the Kutchin?).797 It would seem as if they reached the Kutchin and Tena via the Chilkat Tlingit, who passed them on to the Atna and upper Tanana tribes, or to the southwestern Alaskan Eskimo, the Tanaina of Cook Inlet, and the bands at the Nenana-Susitna height of land. Dentalium shells undoubtedly became more common on the Yukon in historic times, for Whymper reports that they were sold by both American trading companies on the Yukon in the 1860's.798 Jacobsen mentions trade in shells and beads with the Hudson's Bay Com pany posts at Fort Yukon and Fort Selkirk, and with the Alaska Commercial Company's stores on the lower Yukon.799 All of these various tribes used dentalium shells as ornaments for the nose, ear, neck, or hair, or for decorating clothing. For the Tena styles in dentalium shell ornaments see Chapter VI, "Introduction" and "Traded Objects." Pale blue glass beads of the "Cook type" (PL XXVI, 16) were found at a number of his toric Tena and "Eskimo" sites, and also at House 33, Old Fish Camp, which did not yield any other foreign manufactured articles. It is interesting that Osgood mentions blue beads as one type of traded article which reached the Kutchin before the white men penetrated their country. He believes that these beads came from 796 E.W.Nelson, 1899,p.59. 796 Jacobsen, 1884, fig. on p. 217. 797 Spier, 1930, pp. 214 ff.; Osgood, 1936, p. 47, Fig. 6,7; de Laguna, 1934, p. 113 and note 21. 798 Whymper, 1869, p. 204. 799 Jacobsen, 1884, p. 200.</page><page sequence="232">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 225 the coast.800 While he does not describe them, we imagine that they were of the "Cook type," since this seems to have been the earliest type of bead on the lower Yukon and in south western Alaska. Thus, when Cook discovered Prince William Sound in 1778 he found the Eskimo there not only possessed iron weapon points but "skyblue glass beads, about the size of a large pea."801 The beads and iron found amongst these people left no room to doubt that they must have received them from some civilized nation. We were pretty certain, from circum stances already mentioned, that we were the first Europe ans with whom they had ever communicated directly. . . . And there cannot be the least doubt of their having re ceived these articles, through the intervention of the more inland tribes, from Hudson's. Bay, or the settlement on the Canadian Lakes.802 At that time, the interior of Canada was very largely a blank, and Cook was not aware of the vast distances separating the Alaskan coast from the nearest Hudson Bay posts. Jochelsen has collected considerable evidence to show that the Aleuts, prior to Bering's voyage of 1741, had received iron in trade, either from the Chukchee and northern Alaskan Eskimo (as Steller sug gested), or possibly from more southerly Asiatic traders (Chinese, Ainu, Kamchadal?).803 There is thus a greater likelihood that the blue glass beads also came from Asia. We must, of course, consider whether they were not of Russian origin, (at least were among the articles carried by Russian traders). If they were Russian, this would explain why they appear so frequently on the Yukon and in Prince William Sound at sites dating from the Russian occupation. The oc currence of these beads at pre-contact sites would be explained by the hypothesis that the Russians had traded these beads to other tribes (Kamchadal, Chukchee, Aleut, and other Eskimo, etc.), who passed them on to more dis tant groups before the Russians themselves ap peared. On the other hand, these beads may be of Asiatic manufacture and have had, in the be ginning, no connection with the Russians. I submitted a specimen from Prince William Sound to Miss Helen Fernald, at that time Curator of the Oriental Section of the Uni versity of Pennsylvania Museum, but she was not able to tell me definitely whether or not such beads were made by the Chinese. Torii 800 Osgood, 1936, pp. 47 f. 801 Cook, 1906, p. 355. 802 Op. tit., pp. 358 f. 803 Jochelson, 1933 b, pp. 22 ff. reports that some kind of pale blue glass beads were made at a very early date by the Chinese, and that he has found such beads in ancient sites in Mongolia. They were also traded to Japan about 1,000 years ago.804 It was at about this time (during the beginning of the Kache mak Bay III culture) that Ainu-Kamchadal influences appeared in southwestern Alaska, so we must not overlook the possibility that the "Cook" beads were first introduced into Alaska through the same cultural contacts. The iron bracelets and the iron ring from Anvik River and Kateel are like those worn by the Eskimo of Nelson's time.805 Native copper bracelets and rings of the same type were worn by the most recent Kachemak Bay Eskimo, the Chugach, Eyak, Tlingit, Tsimshian, and Kwakiutl.806 Later, the Northwest Coast tribes made similar ornaments of iron and silver and developed elaborately carved patterns.807 PAINT It will be remembered that pictographs in red silhouette were reported in the Tanana Valley. Such paintings are characteristic of the southern Alaskan Eskimo and the Bella Bella, Bella Coola, Kwakiutl, Salish (Coast, but especially the Interior), and have occasionally been found in Nootka and Tsimshian territory, and Jenness reports them from the vicinity of Nome, Alaska.808 Since we did not see the Tanana Valley pictures, a comparison of these with those in other localities is impossible. Very few Athabaskans are known to have made rock paintings. It is doubtful whether any of the pictures on Cook Inlet are the work of the Tanaina, but if they were, they were undoubt edly copies of Eskimo paintings.809 The Kutchin apparently made none. The Carrier made some red paintings, and these were probably inspired by those of their neighbors.810 It is difficult to know from whom the Tanana acquired the art. 804 Torii, 1913-1914, p. 83. 805 E.

It has also been important among the Alaskan Eskimo in modern times, especially among the more southern tribes influenced by Northwest Coast culture.812 However, Collins reports that "the painting of wooden objects with red pigment was a common practice with the Old Bering Sea Eskimos." He describes fragmentary rods, painted red, with designs in black consisting of rows of small circles between heavy V-shaped figures.813 Apparently, therefore, the art of painting was not yet very highly developed, and it must have been from such relatively simple beginnings that the sophisticated paint ings of the Aleut and the Northwest Coast Indians were evolved. Rowley has also re marked that Dorset lamps were often coated with red paint, but suggests that this "rather surprising feature . . . may indicate contact with an Indian tribe that also had a predilection for red paint."814 It is questionable whether this red paint was intended for decoration; it is more likely that the small lamps were sometimes used as paint mortars. In that case, we do not know for what purpose the paint was intended. It is possible that the elaborate painting of Aleut and Northwest Coast Indian implements was a development stimulated by the circum-Pacific culture drift, since this art was highly de veloped in Asia, even as far back as Bronze Age China.815 The burning of clay to make red paint (see Chapter VI, p. 135) seems to be common in the northwestern part of North America. I have already mentioned crayons and paint manufactured from naturally baked shale in the Kachemak Bay III culture.816 The burning or baking of clay to produce red paint has been noted for the Quinault, Klallam, Puget Sound 811 Cf. also de Laguna, 1936 c. 812 Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, pp. 410 f. 813 Collins, 1937 a, p. 176. 814 Rowley, 1940, p. 495. 816 Cf. Creel, 1937 b, p. 234 and note 1: Paintings in black, white and red on the walls of grave houses. 816 de Laguna, 1934, p. 117. Of course, we cannot be sure that all such paint was naturally baked; some may have been artificially cooked. Salish (Nisqually), Wishram, and Makah.817 Of course, almost everywhere natural deposits of red ochre (hematite) have been used without further preparation. Black paint is almost in variably made of soot or crushed charcoal mixed with fat, oil, etc., which makes the pig ment waterproof. The use of coal for black paint, as was reported for the Indians on the Anvik River,818 is much more rare. Niblack reports the use of both charcoal and lignite mixed with oil for body paint among the northern Northwest Coast Indians, and Boas mentions coal used for paint by the Kwakiutl.819 Jochelson says that the Koryak painted bone objects with a black paint made of crushed coal and fish glue.820 It is possible that this use of coal has a wider distribution than appears from the literature. What we know about its distribution suggests that it is a rather recent North Pacific trait. It is not clear whether there is any historical connection between the use of lignite as paint, and the use of lignite as fuel. As far as we know, the only peoples burning coal in the northwest were the prehistoric Eskimo of Port Moller on the Alaska Peninsula and of Kachemak Bay III,821 but other peoples who had access to lignite (cf. Japan) may have burned it in remote times. Unfortunately, the type of fuel used can only be determined through chemical analysis, and I do not know whether any such analyses have been at tempted on material from other regions in this area. The only other North American peoples known to have burned coal were the prehistoric Hopi in Pueblo III and IV times. Their use of lignite as fuel was probably roughly con temporaneous with that by the southwestern Alaskan Eskimo.822 POTTERY The following discussion will deal primarily with cooking pots since lamps are to be treated in the next section. The pottery which we col lected on the Yukon will be compared with that of other regions in respect to the ware, methods of manufacture, shapes, and decoration. The 817 Qinault (Olson, 1936, p. 59), Klallam (Gunther, 1927, p. 224), Nisqually (Haeberlin and Gunther, 1930, p. 40), Wishram (Spier and Sapir, 1930, p. 208), Makah (Swan, 1870, p. 17). 818 G. I.

Native testimony is conflicting as to whether the sand was added intentionally or whether the clay already con tained a sufficient amount. Rock temper was sometimes used alone, but organic matter was often added: chopped bear's hair (reported from the Yukon above Tanana, but not repre sented in our collection or in Rainey's, see page 141), feathers (reported from Tanana Mission, Kalland, Ruby, Koyukuk Station, and Nulato, and by Osgood from Anvik, and represented in the material from all sites except from Adam's place near Tanana Mission), oil (reported from Koyukuk Station and Nulato), blood (reported from Lowden and Anvik). Coal was reported from Ghost Creek (as a substitute for rock temper?), but was not observed. Feather temper was noted without rock temper. One specimen from Adam's place near Tanana Mission (PL XXII, 6) appeared on superficial examination to have been tempered with grass alone, but this was not supported by the petro graphic analysis of a sherd from it (see "Ap pendix" by Donald Horton). The mixture of clay and temper was kneaded by hand, and was either modeled by hand from a single large lump (reported from Nulato), or was built up by patch modeling (reported from Kalland and by Osgood from Anvik, and confirmed by all the archaeological material). Only Andrew Pilot, from the Koyukuk above Kateel, de scribed molding over a birch bark form, a method which may have been restricted to the upper Koyukuk, since we found no evidence of such a practice in any of our material. The sherds in our collection suggest the use of paddle and anvil. This may be inferred from the pas sage quoted from Jacobsen on page 140. The use of a wooden paddle, the left hand serving as an anvil, was described by Osgood for the Ingalik. The surface seems to have been smoothed off with the fingers, a scraper, or a wad of grass, although this is not mentioned by Osgood. The degree of firing seems to vary considerably from specimen to specimen. Our informants described only drying before a fire, 823 de Laguna, 1940. with additional firing resulting from use, but most of the sherds in our collection indicate that the pots were put into a fire, and Osgood's informant at Anvik mentioned lighting a small fire inside the pot. In any case, the firing could not have been completely successful since natives from Koyukuk Station and Nulato told us that pots had to be regreased after each use, and Osgood's informants were afraid to keep water in them. On the whole, the pottery from the Yukon (and this applies also to all the modern Eskimo pottery I have seen from the Kuskokwim-Norton Sound area) was better fired than Eskimo pottery from farther north. This may be the result of the greater supply of fuel available in the southern area. The ware, however, was crude and inclined to exfoliate irrespective of the type of tempering. Vessel shapes from the Yukon are: (1) Small saucer-shaped lamps with rounded bottoms and curving sides, with or without decoration (PL XXII, 1-4). (2) Flat-bottomed cylindrical cooking pots of situla shape (PL XXIII, 1, 3), that is, with sides which flare slightly to a shoulder, are constricted to a neck, and flare again to a mouth of about the same diameter as the shoulder. They may be plain or decorated. (3) Flat-bottomed and straight-sided pots with out decoration (Pis. XXIII, 2; XXII, 6?). It is not clear whether this should be considered as a separate shape or as a variation of the situla. (4) Round-bottomed pots with slightly flaring sides, constricted a little just below the outward turned rim. This was represented by a single undecorated specimen from Adam's place (PL XXII, 5). This pot is so very different from all the others that for the moment we shall not consider it in our discussion of Tena pot tery. (5) Barrel-shaped vessel, decorated. This is represented by only one sherd from New Grayling (Fig. 31, 1), and since the sherd is hard to interpret, we shall disregard it. The decoration on the lamps consists of grooves or of knobs on the rims, lines or combi nations of lines and dots encircling the walls on the inside, and spoked-wheel figures in the bottom. The decoration on the situla-shaped pots consists of grooved rims, faintly scalloped rims, or knobbed rims, encircling lines with or without rows and groups of dots on the outside from the rim to the shoulder, lines or grooves and ridges on the inside just below the rim. These interior ridges were produced by modeling or by applying strips of clay. The knobs were also applied lumps of clay. All other</page><page sequence="235">228 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 decorations were incised with a stick or pointed implement. Jacobsen illustrates one type of pot that we did not find. Unfortunately he does not say whether it was one of the specimens he pur chased at Anvik or whether it was from a Yukon Eskimo village.824 This is a flat-bottomed cylindrical vessel, undecorated except for faint horizontal grooves, rather irregularly spaced, which seem to have been made with a ridged and grooved paddle or with a stick used as a paddle. The illustration is not very clear. A superficial examination readily establishes the fact that the Tena and Eskimo (?) pottery from the Yukon which we found belongs to the class of pottery characteristic of the whole Bristol Bay-Norton Sound Eskimo area. The ware and its methods of manufacture, the shapes of the pots and lamps, and the decoration are all very similar. Nelson has described the manufacture of pot tery at St. Michael:825 A quantity of tough, blue clay is moistened and kneaded thoroughly with the hands until it assumes plasticity; then short, tough blades of a species of marsh grass and a small quantity of fine, black, volcanic sand from the beach are mixed with it. A round, flat layer of the prepared clay is worked out to form the bottom of the vessel, and about the edge of this a wall is built up with a thin band of clay, car ried around a number of times until the desired height is reached. The top is then smoothed, and is either left plain or slightly scalloped with the fingers. The sides of the ves sels are usually left plain, but sometimes they are orna mented with a series of simple, incised lines made with a stick. Several vessels obtained at St. Michael have the sides curving slightly until near the top, where they are some what constricted and the rim is made slightly flaring. After the shaping and the ornamentation of the vessel are completed, it is placed near the fire until it becomes dry; then a fire is built both on the inside and the outside, and it is baked for an hour or two with as great a heat as can be ob tained. The general method of manufacture is similar to that employed on the Yukon, except for the use of grass instead of feathers (unless the pot from Adam's place did have grass temper) and the building up of the sides by coiling, of which we found no evidence, although sometimes the patch-modeling may have been regular enough to approach true coiling. Gordon describes the manufacture of pottery at Cape Nome:826 A quantity of clay, procured from certain localities on the 824 Jacobsen, 1884, Fig. 1 on p. 214. 825 E. W. Nelson, 1899, p. 201. 826 Gordon, 1906, p. 83 f. tundra, was reduced to a smooth paste by mixing with wal rus blood and kneading it with the hands. A quantity of sand from the beach was added, together with fine feathers from the breast of the ptarmigan. From this material the vessel was built up by means of the hands with the aid of a flat piece of wood shaped like a paddle. Sometimes the exterior was finished smooth and either left plain or deco rated with incised lines and dots by means of a pointed stick. Instead of a smooth finish a pitted surface was some times produced by means of a roughly carved paddle or by wrapping the unbaked vessel in a piece of grass matting which left its impression. The finished product was then baked in a wood fire. Women, and not men, were engaged in this industry. This method corresponds more closely to that used by the Tena, the only important difference being that we found no vessels decorated with a paddle or with textile prints. The collection of Eskimo pottery in the Pea body Museum at Harvard, from the Kusko kwim and Togiak Rivers (Bristol Bay), seems to be tempered with broken rock (?) or sand, containing white feldspar (?) particles and mica, feathers, and leaves (?). The ware is gray and rather coarse. We have here the same saucer-shaped lamps and the same situla-shaped cooking pots, though some of the latter are a little more squat in proportion than are our Yukon specimens. The flat bottoms of some exhibit the prints of twined (grass?) matting on which the pot was made. It is possible that we might have noticed similar prints on the bottoms of the Tena pots if we had found more sherds from the bottoms. The decorations are similar, though the Togiak-Kuskokwim vessels show a greater range of motifs, greater freedom of style, and are sometimes decorated farther down the sides below the shoulders than the Yukon pottery. They have grooved rims, en circling lines with rows or groups of dots, and also pots decorated with dots alone. The lamps also have encircling lines and dot patterns, and spoked-wheel designs on the inside. A few are decorated with lines and dots outside. On the side of one pot and in the bottom of one lamp is the same motif that we saw carved in the bowl of a wooden spoon at Baker, on the Tanana (PL XXII, 8). The pottery of St. Michael also seems to have been very similar to our Yukon pottery in shape and decoration, to judge from Nelson's description of two cooking vessels.827 A specimen of earthenware from St. Michael... is 9 inches high by 10} wide. Around the inside, near the top, occurs a series of small incised dots; on the inside of the rim 827 E. W. Nelson, 1899, p. 202.</page><page sequence="236">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 229 are five parallel incised grooves, just below a broader groove which borders the edge; the upper surface of the edge is marked also with a shallow groove. Another vessel from the same locality has three lines of dots around its outer bor der, near the rim, with two sets of double parallel grooves, and just inside the slightly flaring rim are four roughly made grooves. He also figures a pottery lamp from the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta,828 and describes it as a round, saucer-shaped toy lamp of clay, with the bottom rounded and the interior regularly depressed. A series of three parallel grooves are incised around the outer edge, near the border; inside the border are seven incised parallel grooves, succeeded by two others which encircle the center of the bottom and are connected with the series on the side by four spoke-like rays, each of which is formed by a series of four incised lines with an intermediate row of dots. Similar round, saucer-shaped lamps are in common use from the Kuskokwim to the Yukon mouth and are found also along the shore of Norton Sound to St. Michael. One of these lamps from the lower Yukon . . . has two grooves encircling the outside, near the border; inside are four heavy grooves, and a large cross is incised in the center of the bot tom. Within the Bristol Bay-Norton Sound area, only one type of pottery has been found which differs markedly from that just described. This is represented by sherds with a check stamped decoration from Cape Nome and Nunivak Island.829 The pattern was produced with a paddle carved like a waffle iron. The sherds from Nunivak Island were part of a "large flat-bottomed jar," apparently without shoulder and neck, and the pattern covers the pot, if not all over, at least for some distance down the side from the slightly thickened and slightly everted rim. The ware has a coarse rock temper and tends to exfoliate. These sherds are archaeological, but may not be very old in this region. The only complete pot of this type, modern and unfortunately of unknown proveni ence,830 has a flat bottom, sides that flare slightly to the middle of the height and then continue straight to the plain rim. The entire exterior is covered with check-stamp decora tion. One sherd of check-stamped pottery was found in the Old Bering Sea culture on St. Lawrence Island, and, according to Collins, 828 Op. cit., PL XXVIII, 2, p. 65. Cf. also the lamp on a stand from the kashim at Chichifiagamut, Kuskokwim Delta, Fig. 79, p. 252. 829 Collins, 1928, p. 254, Figs. 1-4. 830 WSM ace. 100-313. Mended with iron staples. Dark brown ware, gravel temper. Diam. at mouth 23 cm., at bot tom 14 cm, height 30.5 cm; de Laguna, 1940, PL II, 3. the distribution of such ware includes Neolithic Japan and southeastern Asia, especially Lamma Island near Hongkong where sherds of this type date back to 500-200 B.C., and an Iron Age site on Kola Bay, North Russia. The avail able evidence, he suggests, indicates that southeastern China was the center from which pottery of this type was diffused to the Eski mo.831 We do not need to consider this check stamped pottery further until we come to dis cuss paddle-decorated ware in general. Having shown that the pottery of the Tena belongs to the Bristol Bay-Norton Sound group, we may compare that group as a whole with the recent pottery of northern Alaska and the Mackenzie Delta. That a similar method of manufacture was employed on Kotzebue Sound and the Kobuk River, emptying into it, is shown by Stefansson's account.832 On Kotzebue Sound: Pots were made only on warm sunshiny days. The clay was from a place south of Kigirtaruk [an island in Kotzebue Sound]; any fine sand might be used; ptarmigan feathers were the third ingredient. A little sand was added to the clay "as salt is added to flour" and the dough of the three ingredients was worked as white cooks work bread. When properly mixed, one hand was thrust inside the dough and the pot was shaped by beating the outside of the mass with a stick held in the other hand. When shaped the pot was set beside a small fire and slowly dried, being turned a quar ter round every little while. A pot would dry between morning and evening. These pots broke easily and spoiled in long spells of wet weather . . . The pots were never burned, not even allowed to get very hot in drying . . . They say that clay is mixed only with the finest dry sand and ptarmigan feathers. On the Kobuk River "grass was mixed with clay, as well as sand or crushed rock."833 From Cape Prince of Wales, south of Kotze bue Sound, there is a fragment of a large pot, apparently cylindrical, with scalloped rim and a decoration on the sides composed of vertical bands of short horizontal grooves, such as would be produced by hitting with a ridged paddle or stick.834 Nelson illustrates a cooking pot from Hotham Inlet, Kotzebue Sound, with the same type of piecrust scalloped rim and beaten sides. It is large enough to hold two or three quarts. It is flat-bottomed and situla-shaped.835 This seems 831 Collins, 1937 a, pp. 349 f. Rainey (194J a, p. 536) also found six check-stamp sherds at the Old Bering Sea I site at Okvik. 832 Stefansson, 1914, pp. 312 f. 833 Op. tit., p. 342. 834 PMH 62701; de Laguna, 1940, PI.

Going farther north to Point Hope, we have a fine pot published by Mathiassen, with scal loped rim and stick-paddled sides.836 It is flat bottomed and barrel-shaped, the maximum diameter being about one third of the distance below the mouth. Mathiassen gives the dimen sions as: height 33.5 cm, diameter at the rim 21.5-24.5 cm, diameter at the bottom 11 cm. The specimen is of uncertain age, but is prob ably recent or protohistoric. He also found a fragment of a pot with rounded bottom. In the Washington State Museum at Seattle there is a broken pot from a grave at Point Hope.837 It differs from the pots just described in having a textile print, apparently that of a twined grass (?) mat, wrapped around it. The print begins at about 3 cm below the plain and slightly everted rim and runs down the side for a distance of 18 cm, where it ends with an encircling groove more deeply impressed than the matting print, and probably produced with a string. The pot is cylindrical or barrel-shaped, and the fragment is about 23 cm high. The bot tom is missing. The textile print decoration reminds us of that reported by Gordon from Cape Nome on the northern edge of Norton Sound. The ware is tempered with sand and feathers. Murdoch describes and illustrates some pot sherds from Point Barrow,838 but unfortunately we do not know the age of the specimens. He writes: I obtained three fragments of pottery, which had every ap pearance of great age and were said to be pieces of a kind of cooking-pot which they used to make "long ago, when there were no iron kettles." The material was said to be earth (nu'na), bear's blood, and feathers, and appeared to have been baked. They are irregular fragments ... of perhaps more than one vessel, which appears to have been tall and cylindrical, perhaps shaped like a bean pot [what we have called barrel-shaped], pretty smooth inside, and coated with dried oil or blood, black from age. The outside is rather rough [the coarse rock temper is visible], and marked with faint rounded transverse ridges, as if a large cord had been wound round the vessel while still soft. The 836 Mathiassen, 1930 a, Fig. 17, pp. 63 f. Mathiassen in terprets the horizontal grooves as evidence of coiling, but an examination of the pot, now on exhibit in the Danish Na tional Museum, convinces me that they are due to hitting with a stick or ridged paddle. Republished, de Laguna, 1940, PL II, 7. 837 WSM 540; de Laguna, 1940, PL II, 6. 838 Murdoch, 1892, pp. 91 f., Fig. 22. largest shard has been broken obliquely across and mended with two stitches of sinew, and all are very old and black. From the illustration, unfortunately not very clear, I would interpret the ridges and grooves as the result of paddling. The ware is ap parently the same as that of our feather tempered and blood-mixed pottery from the Yukon. Mathiassen describes pottery found by Ras mussen at Pt. Atkinson on the Mackenzie Delta. It seems to be about 200 years old.839 It consists of three large sherds of round earthenware pots. The clay is rather coarse in consistence, only slightly baked, mixed with gravel and pieces of stone, and seems to have been made in the hand, not built up of strips; it is apparently the same kind of pottery that Stefansson found in Franklin Bay District, and later has been found so far towards the east as King William's Land and Repulse Bay. He estimates the height of the pot as 23 cm, and the thickness of the walls varies from 1.4 to 2.2 cm. It is crusted with food on the inside. The surface shows the coarse rock temper sticking through. The modeling is uneven, and the sherd seems to curve towards a rounded, not flat, bottom. The rim is plain and rounded, with a slight constriction below it. The passage from Stefansson's journal to which Mathiassen refers describes sherds found at Point Stevens on Franklin Bay, east of the Mackenzie Delta. Here broken rock seems to have been used, and no signs are seen of feathers, which they [his Kotzebue Sound natives] say should be in evidence.840 There was probably no decoration, or it would have been mentioned. The ware of this northern Alaskan and Mac kenzie pottery is thus like that of the Norton Sound-Bristol Bay area. Rock temper alone was represented at Cape Prince of Wales (?), and at the Mackenzie Delta. Feathers were added at Kotzebue Sound, Point Hope, and Point Barrow, and as we shall presently see they have never been reported east of that point. Blood was also added at Point Barrow. Surface finish becomes poorer and the temper protrudes more as we go north and east. The situla shape is found as far north as Kotzebue Sound, but here it gives way entirely to a flat-bottomed cylindrical or barrel shape (also known from the Yukon). The scalloped 839 Mathiassen, 1930 a, p. 16, PI. 2, 9. 840 Stefansson, 1914, p. 313.</page><page sequence="238">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 231 rim is known from the Yukon (Jacobsen), St. Michael, Cape Nome, Cape Prince of Wales, Kotzebue Sound, and Point Hope, but is not found farther north and east. The center of its distribution is thus found at Bering Strait. Horizontal paddle grooves are known from the Yukon (Jacobsen), Cape Nome, Cape Prince of Wales, Kotzebue Sound, and Point Barrow, but not from farther east. It has thus about the same distribution as the scalloped rim. Textile prints are known from Cape Nome and Point Hope. The incised decoration, however, does not extend farther north than Cape Nome on Norton Sound. The rounded bottom appears at Point Hope and is the only type found in the Mackenzie area. The pot described by Mathiassen from Pt. Atkinson is duplicated in our collection only by one specimen from Adam's place (PL XXII, 5; and Fig. 26, 1), and this is quite unlike any other from the Bristol Bay-Norton Sound area. On the whole, therefore, while the ware of the recent pottery from northern Alaska and the Mackenzie is like that of the Bristol Bay-Nor ton Sound area, the shapes, the rough un smoothed surface through which the coarse temper protrudes, and the decoration mark it as distinct from the southern Eskimo and Tena pottery. Thus far we have not considered the modern and protohistoric pottery from St. Lawrence Island. The shapes of the vessels, as described and illustrated by Nelson, Collins, Geist and Rainey, have little in common with those which we have just considered. The pots are rectangu lar, with straight sides, flat bottoms, and pierced lugs for suspension; the lamps are oval rectangular with slightly rounded bottoms, with one or two ridges parallel to the longer sides. There are also pot-shaped lamp stands, with the rim cut away to catch the drippings of oil, and there are small curved trays set at the base of the stand to catch bits of burning wick that may fall from the lamp.841 The ware itself, from protohistoric to modern times, is not unlike that of the Kusko kwim-Norton Sound area, although we must note the absence of organic temper. Collins states that "the modern Alaskan Eskimo are 841 Geist and Rainey, 1936, Pis. 38 and 39, pp. 129 f.; Collins, 1937 a, PL 84, 4, 5. Republished, de Laguna, 1940, Fig. 6, 3, 7. known to have made use ... of mammal hair in tempering,"842 but apparently this statement does not apply to St. Lawrence Island, for Rainey writes as follows:843 At present the clay is obtained about thirty-five miles northwest of Kukulik [the site excavated by Geist on St. Lawrence Island], where the tide exposes a deposit of suita ble clay at the edge of a lagoon. The material is removed in blocks, and carried back to the village . . . and simply worked into the desired shape by hand. . . . No tempering material is mixed with the clay, but as the tide washes over it, a certain amount of sand is apparently added to it in its natural state. The moulded [modeled] vessel is allowed to dry in the sun for several days and is then placed on a bed of hot coals in the open. Firewood is saturated with seal oil and placed over the vessel so that heat may reach it from all sides. After baking, the vessels are often smeared with blood. The clay [in the finished vessel] is coarse, thick, and frag ile, and does not appear to have been subjected to any great amount of firing. Many of the fragments can be crumbled between the fingers. Most sherds are black in color and coated with charred oil, but a few are dull red or yellow on the surface, with a black core ... no decorative elements of any kind are present. The great majority of the sherds vary in thickness from one to two cms., but there are a few with a thickness no greater than 5 mms. Analysis shows the temper to be of grains of sand, some running up to 2 mm in size. Ap parently no trace of organic temper was recog nized. The same type of pottery was found in the protohistoric period.844 The shapes of these cooking pots are un related to any of the older pots on the island or to the pottery on the Alaskan mainland. The same type of rectangular cooking pot was made by the Asiatic Eskimo, Maritime Chukchee and by the Koryak of Baron Korf's Bay.845 This type appears on St. Lawrence Island at about the close of the Punuk period. Collins writes of it: It is an unusual and impractical form for a pottery vessel to take, and since it is unrelated to the earlier local form but very close to some of the soapstone pots (e.g. the rounded-square Thule type and the Greenland type de scribed by Hough . . .), it seems impossible to avoid the conclusion that it is a pottery imitation of a soapstone ves sel, a view which has already been expressed by Birket Smith . . . and Mathiassen.846 These pottery vessels are, therefore, copies of the stone cooking pots introduced into northern Alaska by the reflux of the Thule culture. These 842 Collins, 1937 a, p. 167. 843 Geist and Rainey, 1936, p. 129. 844 Op. tit., pp. 130, 151, 164. 845 Bogoras, 1904-1909,1, pp. 185 f., Fig. 104 b. 846 Collins, 1937 a, p. 347.</page><page sequence="239">232 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 pots, used in modern times from Point Barrow eastward, were probably imported from the Coronation Gulf area in Canada, where the westernmost outcrops of soapstone occur. The origin of these soapstone pots and their char acteristic shape need not concern us now. We shall also defer a discussion of the pottery lamps used by the Eskimo of the Bering Sea Islands and Siberia until a later section. There remains only the pot-shaped lamp stand. This is a rather squat vessel, with an oval outline, flat bottom, and very slightly flaring sides. The rim at the ends of the oval are slightly depressed to hold the lamp, and the rim in front is cut away in a large curve to catch the drippings of oil.847 Similar lamp stands are used by the Asiatic Eskimo and Maritime Chukchee.848 Except for the shaping of the rim to adapt the vessel as a support for the lamp, it is similar in shape to the plain, flat bottomed cylindrical cooking pots found on the Yukon (Pis. XXII, 6(?), XXIII, 2) and to the cylindrical and barrel-shaped pots found as far north as Point Barrow, if we disregard the decorative features of the latter. I believe, there fore, that this lamp stand is really the cooking pot of the Alaskan mainland, adapted to a new use, after it had become supplanted on St. Lawrence Island and in Siberia by the rectangu lar cooking pot. None of the pottery which we have com pared to the southern Eskimo ware (Bristol Bay-Norton Sound) has been of any great age. We must therefore consider the oldest pottery known in Alaska. Collins has described the pottery of the Old Bering Sea culture in some detail.849 The ware is generally a sooty black all the way through, but some sherds were a light brown, and others were dark inside with light buff or gray surfaces. Firing was slight. The tempering material most commonly used was coarse sand and gravel. The latter seems to have been carelessly selected, for it is often very coarse, containing particles up to the size of a kidney bean.. . . Fine grass was also used for tempering. The small grooves left by the grass stems and even the carbonized stems themselves are plainly visible on sherds which have weathered or flaked off. . . .The sherds with grass tempering are appreciably lighter in weight 847 Geist and Rainey, 1936, PL 37; PL 38, 8; PL 51, 3, p. 131. 848 Bogoras, 1904-1909, I, p. 185, Fig. 104 a. The Rein deer Chukchee use a wooden bowl for a stand (pp. 184 f., Fig. 102 a). 849 Collins, 1937 a, pp. 166 ff., PL 52. than those in which sand and gravel had been used, and they show a more pronounced tendency to flake off in lay ers. I have found no instance in which both methods of tempering had been used in the same vessel. The sherds averaged from 1 to 1.5 cm in thickness, with a total range from 0.5 to 2.7 cm. None of the grass-tempered pottery was of more than average thickness. The vessels seem to have been shaped by molding directly from the clay rather than by the coiling process. A single rim sherd (PL 52, Fig. 2) bears evidence of coiling, three dis tinct strips being visible at the rim. However, this would appear to be an exceptional case, for the many other sherds showed no evidence of coiling, and their strong tendency to flake off in layers shows that in most cases at least, this method could not have been employed. It is possible that what Collins has described as coiling was only rather even patch-modeling, since the specimen exhibiting it was only a sherd and could not show how far the strips of clay extended. Surfaces were smoothed, but not enough to prevent the rock temper from protruding. Although the pottery was for the most part undecorated* a large number of sherds were corrugated on the exterior, a decoration which had resulted from the application of a paddle or other implement bearing parallel grooves. He illustrates a wooden paddle, with plain handle, convex back and oval striking surface, just concave enough to fit a large pot and scored across by roughly cut grooves. A fine ivory specimen from Point Barrow, perhaps also of the same age, has the handle decorated to represent a bird's head, and is grooved oblique ly across both the concave and convex sides.850 We have already mentioned the Old Bering Sea sherds with check-stamp decoration. Collins also found a fragment of a lamp (?) with a little human figure, lying on the back with arms and legs extended, made from a modeled lump of clay applied to the inside just below the rim. This is the only example of modeled and applied decoration.851 It is thus shown that the grooved paddle decoration, so common in the recent pottery of the northern Alaskan mainland and also re ported from the southern area, like the check stamped decoration, goes back to Old Bering Sea times. 860 Collins, 1937 a, PI. 47, 17. Republished, de Laguna, 1940, PL I, 2. One of Collins* sherds grooved by such a paddle is republished in PI. I, 6.

The shapes of the vessels apparently remained un changed."852 Thus, while grass temper died out on St. Lawrence Island with the close of the Old Bering Sea culture, it lasted on (mixed with sand) at St. Michael in Norton Sound, and perhaps at the mouth of the Tanana. In the Old Bering Sea and Punuk periods both lamps and cooking pots were made of pottery. The lamps are described as "shallow, thick-walled, circular vessels, somewhat similar to those used by the modern Eskimo of the Yukon-Kuskokwim region, but flatter, with a straight slope from the rim to the somewhat conical base . . . there were no lamps with ridges."853 I would consider lamps of this type to be ancestral to the round-bottomed saucer shaped lamps of the Bristol Bay-Norton Sound area. The latter are rarely as large as the Old Bering Sea-Punuk specimens and are generally much smaller. This decrease in size is probably due to the fact that on St. Lawrence Island the lamp helped to warm the house, while in southern Alaska the wood fire on the central hearth gave out sufficient heat, so that the lamp was needed only for light. We must note that neither the old Bering Sea-Punuk lamps nor the southern Eskimo lamps were used for cook ing. This is proved by the fact that none of the associated pots have any means of suspension. We shall return to this point in our discussion of lamps. The cooking pots of the Old Bering Sea and Punuk periods were deep, cylindrical in outline, with steep sides rather thinner than the lamps, and a heavy, rounded, rarely a flat, bottom. They lacked lugs or holes for suspension. Col lins compares these with ancient Koryak and Siberian Neolithic vessels.854 Some of the Old Bering Sea sherds, with coarse gravel temper protruding from the surface, uneven modeling, and slightly thickened and everted rim,855 seem to be from cooking pots that were identical 852 Op. tit., p. 238. 853 Op. tit., p. 168, cf. PL 53, 2 (republished, de Laguna, 1940, Fig. 4,1), p. 342. 854 Op. cit., pp. 168, 238, 342, 346. 855 Op. tit., PL 52,1-3; republished, de Laguna, 1940, PL 1,7. with the large vessel from Adam's place (PL XXII, 5) and the pot described by Mathiassen from Point Atkinson on the Mackenzie Delta. These specimens are therefore survivals of the common type of Old Bering Sea cooking pot. The plain cylindrical pots with flat bottom (PL XXII, 6[?]; XXIII, 2) from Adam's place and from Kateel, as well as the plain cylindrical (and barrel-shaped ?) pots with flat bottom from northern Alaska are survivals of the less common Old Bering Sea shape. Even the paddled decoration, as we have seen, is an Old Bering Sea feature. The scalloped rim seems to be modern. It would be very interesting if pot tery from the lower Tanana and from the Yukon above Tanana should prove to have these same Old Bering Sea characteristics that distinguish the pottery from the mouth of the Tanana from other Tena specimens. We have a suggestion, at any rate, that on the upper periphery of the Tena pottery area the Old Bering Sea type lingered on, while newer styles became established on the lower Yukon. The Birnirk pottery from Point Barrow has unfortunately never been published in full. Mason says only that the specimens in the Van Valin collection consist of "round earthenware pots" and "round flat pottery lamps."856 The ware is very thick, crumbles easily, and has a marked tendency to exfoliate. It is tempered with very coarse gravel, and is very poorly fired. It is black throughout, and is coated with burned grease and permeated with fat. With two exceptions, the pottery is all broken and I doubt whether any of the cooking pots could be restored. The pots seem to have been cylindri cal, lack suspension lugs or holes, but I do not know whether they had rounded or flat bot toms. Presumably they did not differ from the Old Bering Sea vessels. The lamps, of which we have one complete and one restorable speci men, are identical in shape with the Old Bering Sea-Punuk lamps.857 The Birnirk pottery was apparently shaped with a paddle. A plain wooden paddle, with oval blade, 8.5X9.8 cm, was in the original Van Valin collection.858 Hopson who later excavated at a burial site of the same age near Point Barrow obtained a beautiful carved ivory speci men, and Van Valin found an identical one at 866 J.

The pattern, represented on a number of the Point Barrow sherds of pots and on the bottoms of lamps, consists of a set of concentric ovals, deeply incised. Halves of the same figure trail off both ends of the paddle. A similar ivory paddle in the Peabody Museum at Harvard860 has an even more elaborate pat tern formed by several sets of concentric circles and spirals. The Washington State Museum also has two plain bone paddles from northern Alaska, undecorated, but with similarly grooved handles. A modern paddle with plain handle and ungrooved striking surface comes from the vicinity of Cape Smythe in northern Alaska.861 Pottery with the Birnirk type of paddled decoration is known from a late Birnirk culture site near Cape Prince of Wales and has also been found, with textile impressions on the inside, at as yet undated sites on the Kobuk River which flows into Kotzebue Sound.862 Birnirk-type pottery is well represented in the collections obtained from prehistoric Eskimo or Chukchee graves at Puoten Bay near East Cape, Siberia. The designs here appear on the exterior of cooking pots with conical to rounded bottoms and slightly constricted mouths.863 They are also found on the exterior of large shal low, conical-bottomed lamps, and thus could not have been visible when the lamps were in use.864 There is a similar lamp with the exterior showing a textile (?) impression.865 The series of 859 U of PM 29-80-1 and 29-98-1; de Laguna, 1940, PL 1,1. 860 PMH 62769, provenience unknown; de Laguna, 1940, PL I, 3. 861 AMNH 60/8481. 862 Cape Prince of Wales (Personal communication from Henry B.

The ware varies from thick clumsy pottery with coarse gravel or broken rock temper to finer pottery with sand temper, and includes some thick pottery with sparse rock and feather temper.

This Birnirk like pottery may be of the same age as the Birnirk sites at Point Barrow or at Cape Prince of Wales, but it may be later, perhaps represent ing a peripheral survival of Birnirk tradition. The paddled decorations on Birnirk pottery are thus found to be much more elaborate than those of the Old Bering Sea culture. They may have lasted on longer in Siberia than on the Alaskan mainland. The simple stick-paddled decorations on recent and proto-historic pot tery in Alaska have kept closer to the Old Bering Sea type of decoration. The few sherds of pottery found at Canadian Thule culture sites are like the ancient Alaskan pottery in ware, and since the culture as a whole is so closely related to the Birnirk, we can as sume that the Thule pottery is descended from the Birnirk. Mathiassen found three sherds at Naujan on Repulse Bay. He writes of these:866 The body of which the vessel is made is clay mixed with gravel; a certain stratification is visible and the shard is inclined to flake horizontally [i.e., parallel to the surface], presumably owing to the manner in which it was made; the vessel has been made in the hand out of a lump of clay and not built up of strips. Owing to its loose consistence the vessel is very liable to crumble and this is presumably the reason why so little of it remains. The sherds were covered with a dark brown crust, probably of food. One rim sherd is from 1.1 to 2 cm thick. Chemical analysis showed a mixture of calcareous and ferruginous clay, micaceous sand, and gravel containing 19.8 per cent calcium carbonate. The clay had leaf im pressions (due to accident or intention?) and contained about 3 percent of organic matter, probably from humus. "The whole chemical composition of the sample showed that the vessel cannot have been subjected to any actual baking operation." Another sherd was found at the older site of Malerualik in King William Land.867 It is 1.4 cm thick, and ... is of a dark, gravelly, rather loose clay body, of similar consistence to the pieces from Naujan (than which it is, however, darker) and to earthen vessels from the Mackenzie district, brought home by Knud Rasmussen [see our page 230]; this vessel has scarcely been properly baked, merely dried. 866 Mathiassen, 1927,1, pp. 66 f., PL 27,1-3. 867 Op. tit., I, PL 84, 12, p. 318.</page><page sequence="242">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 235 The modern Central Eskimo do not make pottery but they may have preserved something of the tradition in the manufacture of glue. This is described as a mixture of blood, clay, and dog's hair, applied warm, and then dried or baked like cement over the flame of a lamp.868 Certainly pottery was not important in the Thule culture. Even at Malerualik, the oldest and westernmost of the known Thule sites in Canada, there were strong evidences of contact with the Dorset culture, and soapstone was the most important material of which pots and lamps were made. Thus in Canada, as at the mouth of the Tanana in Alaska, we find the last survival of pottery that we can trace back to the Old Bering Sea ware. But, whereas in Canada pottery was abandoned altogether, in the Bristol Bay-Norton Sound area it under went a renaissance, developing the situla shape for pots, smoothed surface and incised decora tion for pots and lamps. Just what was the date of that renaissance we cannot determine with out more archaeological work, but I shall at tempt to show the source from which were de rived the characteristics that give southern Eskimo and Tena pottery its distinctive ap pearance. Of one thing we can be sure, the impulses responsible for the renaissance of southern Es kimo pottery did not reach Norton Sound from Bering Strait, for we have shown that as we go north along the Alaskan coast resemblances to the peculiar southern ware become fewer and fewer. If we cross to the Asiatic side of Bering Strait we find that the Chukchee and Koryak pottery is of Eskimo type, but lacks the fea tures distinguishing southern Eskimo pottery. Thus the modern Maritime Chukchee and Siberian Eskimo pottery resembles the modern St. Lawrence Island vessels in shape and finish.869 This pottery was not baked. It was smeared with reindeer or seal blood, sometimes mixed with ochre, and was dried before the fire. Then the vessels were filled with oil and allowed to stand for several days, so that the oil might soak in and render the vessel less brittle.870 Of the archaeological pottery from 868 Hough, 1898, p. 1032, from Lyons. 869 Bogoras, 1904r-1909,1, pp. 184 ff., Figs. 103,104.

The material from the older graves at Puoten Bay gives us some clue as to the type of prehistoric pottery. Intermediate in shape between the conical-bottomed cooking vessels of Old Bering Sea, Birnirk, and Punuk type and the modern rectangular vessels with suspension lugs are some large bowl-shaped vessels, with rounded bottoms, and without means of suspension.871 The later (?) pots from the same site preserve the rounded bottoms, but become squared at the top and add suspen sion lugs at the four corners. These lugs are formed by poking a finger into the clay from the inside of the pot so that the wall is bulged. The interior pit is filled with a plug of clay, and a horizontal hole is poked through the knob with an awl.872 A lamp, intermediate in shape be tween the round, conical bottomed lamps of Old Bering Sea-Birnirk-Punuk type and the modern oval-rectangular lamp with bridges, is also found at the Puoten Bay site. It preserves the rounded to conical bottom, lacks bridges, but is of an oval-rectangular shape.873 None of these modern or protomodern pots and lamps have paddled decoration. The surface on some has been partially wiped smooth, but the gravel temper projects. The Koryak no longer make clay pots or lamps, although they once did so.874 Excava tions at Baron Korff's Bay, on the east coast of the Chukchee Peninsula, have yielded Koryak pottery. There were fragments of rectangular pots with outside lugs at the corners, i.e., the modern Chukchee and St. Lawrence Island type, and thinner sherds of other shapes.875 Jochelson describes the ancient Koryak pot as being conical-bottomed, baked hard, and cov ered with twined basketry impressions. One particular vessel had a diameter of 27 cm. at the rim and a height of 27 cm. The walls were from 0.4 to 0.8 cm. thick.876 Jochelson excavated some semisubterranean Koryak houses at the mouth of Nayakhan River and on the coast between there and the Gishiga River. He writes:877 871 WSM 10086, Grave 34 (de Laguna, 1940, Fig. 6, 6). 872 WSM 10018, Grave 19 (de Laguna, 1940, Fig. 6, 5), 10090, Grave 37, and 10026, toy pot, Grave 20. 873 WSM 10050, Grave 27 (de Laguna, 1940, Fig. 6, 4). 874 Jochelson, 1905-1908, II, pp. 637 ff. 875 Bogoras, 1904-1909,1, pp. 186 f. 876 Jochelson, 1928, p. 76. 877 Jochelson, 1905-1908, II, p. 639.</page><page sequence="243">236 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 All the potsherds found by me are made of coarse clay, containing fine gravel and pieces of quartz. They are quite thin (4-12 mm.), so that their manufacture has little in common with that of the thick and clumsy clay lamps and unbaked quadrangular kettles of the modern Chukchee and Asiatic Eskimo described by Bogoras. The potsherds found in the excavations are black with soot and fat, and were evidently well baked, as they remained strong and hard, although they had been lying in the wet soil. He figures a conical-bottomed, barrel-shaped vessel, with a height of 24 cm, and a rim di ameter of 21 cm. The maximum diameter was about one-third of the distance below the mouth, and the walls were from 0.4 to 0.8 cm thick. He says of it:878 The pot is moulded with the hand, and the outside bears all over it the impressions of close-woven twined basketry. . . . Evidently this impression was made by taking a piece of twined fabric in one hand, and pressing it against the moist pot, the twined woof being placed so that the lines run at right angles to the rim. In some fragments of pots the impress of this woven fabric is very distinct. Thus, among the Koryak, as among the Chukchee, there seems to have been the same development of pottery types from conical bottomed pots of Old Bering Sea-Birnirk Punuk shape to rectangular pots with sus pension lugs of modern St. Lawrence Island type. Collins compared the Old Bering Sea pottery with the ancient Koryak ware.879 The chief difference seems to have been that the Koryak pots had textile impressions. It may well be that textile-decorated pottery ought to belong to the Old Bering Sea culture since it has been found at Cape Nome and Point Hope. Jochelson describes the Neolithic pottery from Lake Baikal in Siberia as "egg-shaped pots with a conical bottom," thin porous walls, quartz sand and gravel temper, and bearing traces of basket-work or of the application of stamps. They were furnished with handles or holes under the rim.880 Thus we see that northern Siberian pottery has relationships only with northern Eskimo pottery. To find anything comparable to the southern Eskimo type we shall have to turn south to Kamchatka and the Kuriles. Schnell881 recognizes three archaeological 878 Op. tit., II, p. 639, Fig. 165 a. 879 Collins, 1937 a, p. 346. 880 Jochelson, 1928, pp. 28, 30. 881 Schnell, 1932, pp. 60, 62. He also (p. 62) mentions areas in Kamchatka: (1) the interior near Kurile Lake, near the southern tip of the penin sula, (2) the east coast, and (3) the west coast at Kavran and Kulki rivers. All archaeological types found by Jochelson and by the Swedish expedition are the same for these three areas, with the exception of pottery. Jochelson dis tinguished between a southern and a northern type of pottery. The southern type was found in regions 1 and 2, the northern in region 3. Schnell has three types of pottery: Type I "coarse undecorated pots with ears inside"; Type II "also a coarse pottery without ears but with four or five stripes surrounding the rim." Both of these together correspond to Jochel son's southern Kamchadal ware, and both are found on the east coast (region 2) and probably at Kurile Lake (region 1). Type III (Jochel son's northern type) is "a finer pottery dec orated with dots and lines and occasionally with impressions of baskets or ropes." It is found on the west coast near Kavran and Kulki rivers (region 3) and Schnell also reports it from the east coast (region 2). The southern Kamchadal pots of Type I882 are round, shallow, flat-bottomed vessels with flaring sides, furnished on the inside with three (or four?) pierced suspension lugs. Similar pots are reported from the northern Kuriles, Sak halin, and Hokkaido. Torii and Jochelson believe that these were an aboriginal Ainu type, copied by the Kamchadal, but Munro and Schnell think they are all copies of imported Japanese iron kettles.883 Jochelson unfor tunately does not describe his specimens in detail, though we gather that the ware was very similar to that made by the Eskimo. Pots were made without a wheel, were not coiled or basket-moulded, although some show impres sions of basketry or textiles. "It seems that the vessels were worked from a single block of clay and beaten into shape." They were tem pered with sand, gravel and sable-tail hairs. It is not certain whether they were intentionally prefired or became baked as a result of use. The Kamchatkan pots seen by Carl von Ditt mar in 1851-1855 were small clay vessels. "The clay crumbled under the hands, it had evi differences in the shape of stone lamps, but these seem to me to be insignificant. 882 Schnell, 1932, PL XV, 1; Jochelson, PL 17, 1, 3; PL 18, (republished, de Laguna, 1940, Fig. 8, 6). 883 Torii, 1919-1921, PL XXXIII, p. 195; Jochelson, 1928, p. 75; Munro, 1911, pp. 195 f.; Schnell, 1932, p. 64.</page><page sequence="244">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 237 dently been badly (if at all) baked."884 These remarks seem to apply specifically to the south ern pottery (Schnell's Types I and II). Schnell says of a vessel of Type I:885 The ware, which is black above and brown below, scales off very easily. The tempering material is coarse sand, which gives the vessel a very rough surface. The walls are 1 cm thick. Jochelson describes northern Kamchadal pottery (Schnell's Type III) as consisting of small vessels, evidently fired, bearing impres sions of baskets or cords, and also decorated with dots, lines, zigzags, etc. Suspension holes were made near the rim with an awl.886 Al though there is a localization of the two or three types of pottery, Schnell concludes that there is no chronological difference between them and that no hard and fast distinctions should be made. The sites where they have been found range in age from the eleventh to the middle of the eighteenth centuries.887 Some of the Type I pots with suspension lugs and some of the Type II pots of similar shape but without lugs are decorated on the inside or the outside with grooves and ridges quite similar to those inside the Yukon pots.888 This type of grooving is also found on some ancient Koryak pottery.889 We ought also to note that small knobs, such as we saw on the rims of some Yukon pots and lamps, tend to occur just above the suspension lugs on the rims of the Kamchadal Type I pots,890 and may even be found on some of the decorated vessels of Type III.891 It is, however, the decorated northern Type III ware which interests us the most. While none of Jochelson's or Schnell's sherds of this type are complete enough to tell us the shapes of the pots except that some seem to have had 884 Jochelson, 1928, pp. 72 f. 885 Schnell, 1932, explanation of PI.

XV, J, with dot decoration, from southeastern Kamchatka. flaring rims, specimens from western Kamchat ka, published by Nakayama and presumably of the same type, have pointed bottoms and are covered with textile prints. Other sherds in his collection have grooved rims.892 Jochelson's specimens from the Kulki River on the north west coast of Kamchakta are covered with the impressions of twined textiles, on which the decorations have been superimposed. The lat ter were made with a cord (?), or with a shell with scalloped edges (?), producing wavy lines. The designs consist of (1) two, four, five, or six horizontal lines with a row of vertical or oblique spur-like dots below, (2) three lines with a row of spur-like dots below and above, (3) double bands of three lines each, con nected at intervals by vertical bands of three lines, the spaces between containing four short horizontal lines.893 Apart from the textile printed background and the wavy character of the superimposed lines, these designs are very similar to those of the Bristol Bay-Norton Sound pottery. However, the sherds from Kav ran River are so very like this southern Eskimo and Tena pottery that they seem to be indis tinguishable from it. The surface of the pot is smooth, and the decoration consists of incised lines and dots. One specimen has ridges (inside or out?), quite like those of the Yukon pots. The incised designs are (1) four horizontal en circling lines, (2) three horizontal encircling lines with a row of angular dots below, (3) a horizontal line with a row of oval dots below and three horizontal lines below that.894 The pottery from Kavran River bears such a striking resemblance to the southern Alaskan pottery that it would be rash to deny a connec tion between them. As Schnell has shown, this northern type of pottery is also found in south eastern Kamchatka. We have already men tioned this southern sherd with knobs on the rim. It has a smooth surface and a decoration consisting of a row of dots just below the rim, from which are looped several curved lines of dots.895 Pottery with incised lines and dots is not found north of Kamchatka, and the only exam ple of ancient Koryak ware resembling the decorated Kamchadal pottery is the one sherd 892 Nakayama, 1934, PI. 5, 1, 2, 3; (with grooved rims) Fig. 19,2, PI. 5,4. 893 Jochelson, 1928, PI. 19 A; republished, de Laguna, 1940, Fig. 8,8. 894 Jochelson, 1928, PI. 19 B; republished, de Laguna, 1940, Fig. 8, 9. 896 Schnell, 1932, PL XV, 3.</page><page sequence="245">238 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 with grooves and ridges, which we have al ready mentioned. Thus, while the underlying basis for all of the eastern Siberian pottery, probably from the Neolithic to modern times, is the same as that of all the Eskimo and Tena pottery, the links connecting Kamchadal with southern Eskimo and Tena pottery must lie in some direction which we have not yet ex plored. These two decorated wares seem to be too late in both Kamchakta and southern Alaska to have had any connections in the Bering Sea area, for there we have been able to trace back the modern pottery to an Old Bering Sea horizon without finding anywhere the traits peculiar to the southern styles. Before dis cussing the problem of how the Kamchadal and southern Eskimo pottery are related, let us try to discover the origin of the decorative features of the Kamchadal pottery. Jochelson896 believes that the Kamchadal learned the art of pottery making from the Kurilian Ainu. The latter are, in turn, sup posed to have acquired it from their relatives farther south; at any rate, their pottery is strongly influenced by southern Ainu ware. While the relationships of the various Kurilian types to the Ainu pottery of Hokkaido and to the Ainu (Jomon) and prehistoric Japanese (Yayoi) wares of Honshu remain obscure, there is no doubt that pottery styles traveled north from Honshu. Torii897 envisages the movement as a series of invasions from the south, by which successively dispossessed groups of Ainu moved north. He seems to suggest that the aboriginal Ainu of Hokkaido were the carriers of pottery to the Kuriles. Schnell898 holds a similar view. In the third or fourth century a.d., the South Kuriles became acquainted, probably for the first time, with the potter's art, probably through the influence of the im migrating Hondo-Ainu [Honshu Ainu], who were com pelled by the advance of the proto-Japanese to leave their old dwelling places, as a result of which not only ware but also decoration and form came to be closely associated with the jomon [prehistoric Ainu] pottery of Hondo. In the course of the succeeding period the pottery of the Kuriles became isolated from the Hondo jomon pottery and both the form and the ornamentation of the vessels become stereotyped. When eventually reproductions of the proto Japanese yayoi pottery reach the Kuriles, doubtless via Hokkaido, the old style of pottery must have seen its best days and is incapable of leaving its mark upon the new ceramic elements. Ultimately even these latter had, as I 896 Jochelson, 1928, p. 70. 897 Torii, 1919-1921, pp. 191 ff. 898 Schnell, 1932, p. 58. have pointed out above, to make way for the metal ware imported from Japan. Doubtless this complex problem would be much clearer if we understood better the relationships between the Honshu Ainu (Jomon) wares and the prehistoric and historic Japanese wares (pre-Yayoi, Yayoi, and Yamato). Schnell distinguishes three types of Kurilian Ainu pottery: C, B and A. Type C is the ear liest, being that which developed from the Usude, or late Jomon pottery of the Honshu Ainu, made in Kwanto between a.d. 200 and 400. Type B is the later outgrowth of Type C; Type A is the Kurilian imitation of the proto Japanese Yayoi ware, which was originally made in southern Japan, and was carried into northern Honshu with the Japanese conquest, about the end of the tenth century. It is this late Type A ware which bears the most striking resemblances to Kamchatkan and southern Eskimo pottery. Yet these same features can be traced back into earlier Ainu wares, so that I do not believe the break between Types C-B and Type A is as complete as Schnell would give us to understand. Schnell describes Type A ware as being black throughout, with a few red or brown streaks. It is poorly fired, but dense. The tempering is sel dom seen (because the surface is wiped smooth?). The vessels have a situla shape, and are ornamented with strips of clay, and incised and stamped lines and dots. The rim is plain, but occasionally has a few projecting knobs. About 20 per cent of the sherds have repair holes, as contrasted with the 10 per cent in the earlier Type B pottery, and none in Type C or in Honshu Ainu pottery.899 (In this respect the Type A pottery is like that of the Eskimo.) The most recent pottery I consider to be type A. Its ware differs entirely from all other Ainu pottery, seeing that in most cases it is absolutely jet black in the fracture. It makes black or brownish-black lines on white paper, and apparently therefore contains a good deal of carbon, a fact that recalls the above-quoted [see below] description of the Ainu method of mixing chopped-up herbs with the clay. The nature of the Japanese Ainu ware does not justify the assumption that grass was an ingredient in the clay mixture, nor does the nature of either the B or the C Kurilian pottery. It would appear, therefore, that the pot tery that was manufactured up to the time when the Japanese export of iron pots and suchlike ousted the Ainu potter's industry was of the same consistency as ceramic type A. Further, it should be pointed out that the Ainu drawing published by Torii. . . shows a vessel of the same situla-form that is actually the most common in the A pot 699 Op. tit., pp. 54,56 f.</page><page sequence="246">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 239 tery. This simple drawing cannot however provide any definite proof, while it should be remembered that the tradition quoted originates in the Northern Kuriles, of whose cerematic conditions we know hardly anything at all. The shapes of the Type A pots have no con nection with those of the Types B and C wares, or with the Honshu Jomon pots, according to Schnell. On the other hand, they have parallels in the Proto-Japa nese yayoi pottery. ... It seems, therefore, certain, I think, that there is a connection between the A type and the yayoi pottery, but when this cultural loan took place it is impossible to say.900 The passage from Torii to which Schnell re fers is the description of pottery making on the northern Kuriles, given by an Ainu.901 To make their pottery, our ancestors used clay which they tempered with sand and finely chopped grass, called "nok kanki," making of it long rolls which they coiled up, one on top of the other, on a flat bottom, also of clay, as you see in this drawing. These rolls were called in our language earthrings. This done, they filled the vessel with water [?], and put it over the fire to dry it. When the water was com pletely evaporated, it was properly cooked . . . Only women made pots. Skill in making pots consisted solely in preparing the chopped grass, [because it might be chopped too fine]. This use of organic temper links the Type A pottery of the Kurilian Ainu with that of the Eskimo and the northern Siberian tribes. The coiling technique suggests that described from St. Michael by Nelson. The latter presents a puzzling problem, for with the exception of a single Old Bering Sea sherd with neck coils, coiled pottery is strikingly absent from the Eskimo. The shape of the pot sketched by Torii's informant is just such a situla as we might find in the Bristol Bay-Norton Sound area. Pots of this shape, excavated in the Kuriles, have a somewhat smaller flat bottom and a somewhat wider flat-rimmed mouth than do most Yukon pots.902 Also made in the same ware are a small flat-bottomed, straight-sided cup,903 a pitcher with a handle and a spout shaped like an ani mal's head,904 and a flat-bottomed vessel with 900 Op. tit., pp. 57 f. 901 Torii, 1919-1921, p. 188 (my translation), and Fig. 57. 902Hirako, 1929, frontispiece Fig. K, 9, and 11 (?); Schnell, 1932, Pis.

"It may be that this vessel indicates the existence of some relation between A and B." Other vessel shapes from the Kuriles are the flat-bottomed pots with suspension lugs inside and sometimes with knobs on the rim, like the Kamchadal Type I pots,906 and what Torii refers to as dishes. There are also pointed oval lamps, of undescribed ware (probably Type A?), but these last will be discussed in the Section on lamps. The situlas of Type A ware may be plain or ornamented. The decoration may consist of knobs on the rim, of small bosses on the shoul der, of applied straight or wavy ribbons of clay about the neck and shoulder, and of simple in cised designs on the upper part of the vessel. These incised designs consist of the following elements: round dots in lines or bands; dotted or broken lines, sometimes alone, sometimes following straight incised lines; plain straight incised lines; zigzag lines; X's, inclined V's or chevrons, and short diagonal lines. One or two of these elements usually encircle the neck and shoulder of the pot. Occasionally we find a specimen on which lines and dots form a band of triangles or rectangles around the upper part of the vessel.907 The shapes of the pots, the knobs on the rim, the dot-and-incised-line decorations all show marked similarities to the Norton Sound-Bristol Bay pottery, while the applied strips of clay on the outside are anal ogous to the strips forming ridges on the inside of southern Eskimo and Tena pots. The style of decoration of the Ainu vessels is, however, much freer. The other wares from the southern Kuriles do not show such similarities to southern Es kimo or Kamchadal pottery. The Type B ware is sand-tempered (?), with a rather rough sur face, and is reddish brown with black streaks. The pots are flat-bottomed, but bell-shaped with flaring mouths, sometimes oval in outline, the rim often rising to low ear-shaped peaks or knobs. The whole surface is decorated with rings, curves, straight bands, etc., of cord-im pressed lines or lines of angular dots, which are 905 Schnell, 1932, PL VII, 3 and description of plate. 906 Cf.

The rim may be decorated with strips of clay, dented or incised with angular depressions.908 The flat bottoms, the knobs or ears on the rim, the in cised dots and lines (even though they follow flowing patterns), and the applied strips of clay are all elements which I believe were taken over from this Type B ware into the later, stiffer Type A pottery. The eared rims suggest the scalloped rims of Eskimo pottery from the Yukon to Point Hope. There is also one curious pattern, the spoked-wheel design, which occurs on the side of a Type B pot. The lines seem to have been made with a brush, or possibly with a comb-shaped tool.909 The parent Type C ware, from which this B ware is derived, is "brown with black flames, and the tempering sand is slightly visible on the surface." The pots have a round, flat or slightly concave bottom, practically vertical sides, and a smooth undecorated mouth, or a rim with ears. The surface is covered with textile im pressions, over which are designs made by im pressed cords, and bands of applied clay bearing angular dots. One pot has a slightly concave bottom on which is a spoked-wheel design of cord prints.910 Apparently these Kurilian types were also known from Yezo or Hokkaido. Hitchcock pub lishes a group of Hokkaido Ainu pottery. Though many shapes are represented, most of the pots are flat-bottomed, and there are some that are situla-shaped. One of these is decorated on the neck with two parallel incised lines with a row of dots between. We should imagine that this pottery is of Type A.911 I examined some sherds from the island;912 they are tempered with rock, containing obsidian (?), and some grass (?). The rim rises to scallops or ears. The surface has been wiped with a bundle of twigs (?), and the design of lines of string impres sions runs around the rim and also forms loops. If these sherds really contain grass temper, then they should probably be classed with the Type A ware, even though they are grayish in 908 Schnell, 1932, Pis. VIII, 2; IX, 1, 2; X, 3, 4; p. 54. 909 Op. tit., PL VIII, 2. 910 Op. tit., Pis. VIII, 3, XI, 6, 7, pp. 54 f.

Torii mentions another type of pottery from Hokkaido. The Ainu who immigrated to Hok kaido from Honshu imported Japanese pots, but if too poor to own any, "they took the bark of the birch, and after giving it the shape of a pot, covered this utensil with a crude sheath of clay which they dried in the fire." These make shift pots were used for cooking.913 We have already mentioned the flat-bottomed, shallow vessels with straight flaring sides and suspen sion rings inside, that resemble the imported iron pots and that are like the Kamchadal, Kurilian, Sakhalin and Japanese pots. The description of the bark pot covered with clay suggests the type of pot molded over a bark form described by Andrew Pilot for the Koyukuk, although the bark form was re moved from the Koyukuk pot. However, this similarity may not be significant, since we found no parallels to the Koyukuk method in Alaska or in Asia, and Andrew Pilot's statement itself could not be verified. When we come to Japanese pottery the dif ficulty of making adequate comparisons with northern pottery becomes very great. This is largely due to an embarassment of riches, for we are confronted with a multitude of pottery types, Ainu and proto-Japanese, and perhaps even others, ranging in age from about 300 B.C. to a.d. 900 or later, each with local varia tions. Unfortunately, the material has been published chiefly in Japanese, and the ab stracts in English, German, or French are too brief and generalized to be of much value. Moreover, there seems to be a great difference of opinion with regard to the definition, nomen clature, dating, and relationships of these types. There is an unfortunate tendency to illustrate only the most highly decorated specimens, while for this study we ought to deal with their simpler and less pretentious companions. It is, therefore, with considerable misgivings that I attempt to point out features in Honshu pot tery which are similar to northern Ainu Kamchadal and Bristol Bay-Norton Sound wares. Schnell has taken the Jomon Usude ware as the parent type from which the Kurilian Type C pottery was derived. This Usude ware was made in Kwanto, or central Honshu, by the 913 Torii, 1919-1921, p. 191 (my translation).</page><page sequence="248">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 241 Ainu between a.d. 200 and 400.914 But from the examples of Jomon wares that he illustrates, I should pick the earlier Atsude pottery from the mountains of northern Honshu as having more in common with the Kurilian pottery. This Atsude ware was made by the Ainu from about 200 B.C. to a.d. 200 and is described as "thick reddish-yellow or reddish-brown, oc casionally painted red, and the surface is rough from the grains of quartz in the tempering sand." The vessel walls average 0.9 cm in thickness. There are flat-bottomed vessels with tall sides that bulge to a certain point, are con stricted, and flare again at the mouth. The rims are brought up into ears, scallops and elaborate knobs. The body is covered with textile impres sions, over which the design is made. The decorations are mostly restricted to the upper part of the vessel and consist of elaborately applied ribbons of clay, as well as string-im pressed patterns, even including what looks like a variant of the spoked-wheel design re peated around the sides of the pot.915 All of these are features which might have become simplified in the northern Ainu pottery. There are a number of sites yielding Jomon Ainu pottery which give hints of this transition. Unfortunately, I do not know how the material should be classified, and can only guess that it is relatively late. Thus, some of the so-called "cylindrical pots," found chiefly in northeast ern Honshu and probably related in some way to the Atsude ware, approach the situla in shape. The rims are scalloped or rise to ears, the bodies are marked with the prints of fabrics or of cord-wound sticks and are decorated with fillets of clay.916 Late Jomon pottery from Uki in the Province of Hizen has notched, scalloped, or eared rims, and while the surface is textile marked, the decorations may consist of bands and lines of impressed dots, bands of incised crosshatching and of inclined V's or chevrons, and applied ribbons of clay. Most of these de signs, however, form complex spiral patterns.917 Among the sherds from Imosaka in Echigo Province, most of which are decorated with corded-stick impressions, there is one with smooth surface and a simple decoration of en 914 Schnell, 1932, p. 57; cf. p. 42 for dates. 915 Op. tit., p. 30, Pis. II, III, 1-3, and Fig. 7 (repub lished, de Laguna, Fig. 8,15-17). 916 Hasebe, 1927, PL IV, 2, 3, 4, 7. 917 Hamada, Komaki, and Shimada, 1926, (2), figs, on pp. 80, 81, 82. circling lines and dots.918 This last is very close to the simplest Kurilian Type A pottery, and is even more similar to Kamchadal and south ern Eskimo pottery in decoration. Pottery from the Omori shell heaps near Tokyo, the exact chronological and cultural position of which I do not know, except that it must be late to judge by the presence of vessels with high stands, is somewhat similar to the Atsude.919 It is coarse and unevenly baked, and the walls are 0.6 cm thick. The bottoms are flat, the rims plain, notched, undulating, or brought up into points and knobs. Some of the knobs are complex in shape, some are modeled to suggest faces.920 Impressions of matting or of textiles are common. The decorations are, on the whole, quite complex. Some of these are very similar to the designs found on Hopewell pots, that is, there are areas filled in with hatching produced by corded-stick or even with roulette (?) impressions, outlined by broad grooves. Applied bands of clay are com mon and these are often notched. Morse de scribes them as "wreaths of clay put on in bands, and ornamented with finger squeezings," which produce a pie-crust effect.921 Among the wealth of shapes and decorative patterns, how ever, we can cite some which suggest the sim pler northern styles. Thus, some of the grooved or ridged rims have profiles quite similar to those on Yukon pots.922 A number of the vessels are situlas, and one even has an incised line with a row of round dots below it around the shoulder.923 Among the sherds found at the Orimo'to shell heaps in Musashi Province, also near Tokyo, there are some with smooth sur face, and the designs include patterns of dots and lines, produced by forked sticks, and of small circles, apparently made by pressing the end of a hollow tube into the wet clay.924 These also would suggest affinities with the north. All of the Japanese pottery which we have been considering was made by the prehistoric Ainu, who formerly lived in northern Honshu, north of the Lake Biwa line. We have not dealt with the pro to-Japanese or Yayoi ware. The oldest of the Jomon (Ainu) and of the Yayoi 918 Yahata, 1936, Fig. 2, 4. 919 Morse, 1879, p. 78, cf.

There are, however, a few sites in southern Honshu and Kyushu which take us back into the Neolithic, that is, to a period prior to 200 B.C. They do not show clear connections with either the Japanese Yayoi or with the Ainu, although it has been argued that they exhibit cultural pat terns ancestral to the one, or to the other, or to both. These sites are: (1) Ko, in Kawashi Province, west of Lake Biwa, (2) Tsukumo, in Bitchu Province, southern Honshu; and, on Kyushu, (3) Ibusuki and (4) Idzumi, in Sat suma Province, and (5) Torodoki, in Higo Province. Because these sites may yield clues to the origin of Jomon pottery, it may be well to consider briefly the various wares which have been found in them. At Ko, below strata containing Iwaibe and Yayoi pottery, there has been found pottery with textile prints, better made than Atsude but cruder in decoration. Schnell believes that it may have been ancestral to the Atsude, and suggests for it a date of about 400 B.C. The in habitants, who are described as Ainu-like, are claimed by Koganei as the ancestors of the Ainu, by Hamada as the ancestors of the proto Japanese.925 Tsukumo has Iwaibe pottery on the surface, Yayoi below, and, in the third and lowest layer, three kinds of Neolithic ware. One of these is brown and is marked with mat and cord impressions; unfortunately it is not compared with Jomon or Ko textile-impressed pottery. The second ware is dark, polished, with parallel lines incised on the rim; and the third is dark brown, very coarse, and is without decoration except for low molding and peaks or ears on the rim.926 Ibusuki has two culture-bearing strata. The younger contains typical Yayoi pottery and another ware, interpreted by Schnell as a sur vival of the pottery found at the neighboring site of Idzumi. This second type is decorated with bands of applied clay around the rim, on which are impressed rings and lines. In the second, or lower layer were found vessels with peaked or eared rims and incised curvilinear crooked decorations. In rare cases, textile im pressions take the place of the incised designs. 925Hamada, 1918; 1920; Liang, 1930, p. 64; Schnell, 1932, pp. 31, 40. 928 Kiyono, Shimada, and Hamada, 1920; Liang, 1930, pp. 63 f. Liang considers that the oldest pottery from Tsukumo and Ibusuki is ancestral to the Jomon, and places the Neolithic Ibusuki material as the older of the two.927 The site of Idzumi, near Ibusuki, contains some of the pottery found in the lower layer at Ibusuki, but the bulk of the material is of the second type found in the upper Yayoi layer at Ibusuki, although it is perhaps of an earlier form. I do not know whether it is really pre Yayoi in date. These vessels have high stands and are decorated, mainly on the rim, with nar row bands of clay and incised designs consisting of bands of short vertical or oblique lines, "herring-bone" (V-shaped?) lines, hatched pat terns and bands of wedge-shaped dots. This is perhaps the type shown by Schnell in his Figure 7 as "Stamp-ornamented pottery." Liang says that the decoration is "quite in the Man churian [Neolithic] fashion."928 At Torodoki, the last site, below a few Yayoi sherds, there occurs a dark brown or black ware, decorated with incised designs, mostly in horizontal lines, with applied wavy bands of clay, and with pinched finger and nail impres sions.929 In these southern sites, we thus find what may be the prototypes of both the Jomon and Yayoi pottery, but we are unable to evaluate the hints. Certainly these various Neolithic wares already contained the decorative ele ments and devices later employed on Jomon pottery. Whereas Schnell dates Ko from about 400 B.C. and lower Ibusuki from about 300 B.C., Liang places these sites in the following order, beginning with the oldest: Torodoki, Idzumi, Ibusuki, Tsukumo, and Ko. It is not clear, however, whether he is considering only the Neolithic layers, which interest us the most, or the total span of culture represented by all the layers. However, his scheme does bring together, as very early, the incised wares, and groups together as later the cord-marked wares of the last two sites. He believes that the period represented ranged from before 2000 B.C. to 1000 B.C. (!), which he takes as the beginning of the Yamato or Iron Age (Iwaibe ware), fol lowing Munro's chronology. He finds justifica tion in this extreme dating by comparisons with the Neolithic pottery of China, Manchuria, Mongolia, Indo-China, and Turkestan, but 927 Schnell, 1932, p. 41; Liang, 1930, pp. 63 f. 928 Liang, 1930, pp. 62 f. 929 Op. tit., pp. 61 f.</page><page sequence="250">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 243 fails to allow sufficient time for the spread of cultural influences.930 While we may not agree with Liang's dating, his discussion of this Neolithic pottery from southern Japan is very interesting. He writes:931 This looks as if two lines of influence had reached the Japa nese archipelago in Neolithic time, one from the adjacent mainland from northern Korea, carrying string impres sion, stamped design, and more regular patterns, and the other from the south carrying up from southeasternmost Asia, through the chain of Islands to Kyushu, and southern Korea, the plain incised pottery. In Formosa, for example, sherds have been found with grooved andridged exteriors and with incised chevrons, XXX's, and round dots, and in the Ryukyu Islands with rows of pits and grooves along or under the rim.932 Liang says again:933 So far as we can judge from the existing material, there were in the latter half of the Neolithic period two basic types of ceramic in the Far East: the string impressed pot tery in the north, forming the basis of Chinese, Manchu rian, and Mongolian wares, and the plain pottery, centering in the southeastern extremity of Asia. At the time of Hsi-Yin culture [2500-2000 B.C.? in China]?which may be identi fied with Andersson's Yang-Shao culture?a painted pot tery flourished on this base of string impressed pottery, and stretched clear from Kansu in the west to Fengtien in the east. But before this time, the string impressed pot tery (without painted pottery) had already moved east and met the plain pottery, which migrated north into Korea and Japan, where in both lands, the northern part was then dominated by the former [i.e., in Japan the tex tile- and string-impressed Jomon Ainu wares] and the southern part by the latter [i.e., in southern Japan, the pre-Yayoi "stamp-ornamented pottery" of Schnell?]. To ward the end of the Neolithic period, the stamped-incised pottery with its hollow foot and high stand arrived in Mon golia and Manchuria, whence it expanded toward the southwest and the southeast. But just at the time when it reached Honan, the Neolithic period came to an end in North China, therefore its influence was manifested only in the Japanese pottery [i.e., the proto-Japanese Yayoi ware of 200 b.c.-a.d. 200]. ... As for the stamped-incised pottery of Mongolia, it had most likely come from the west around the northern border of the Gobi desert into this mountainous area of Kingan and Yinshan. The influence of the same pottery seems to have reached Anau at about the same time, and given it the incised pottery of Culture III [1500-1000 B.C.]. The stamped-incised pottery of the Mon golian-Manchurian Neolithic has some fea tures that are strikingly similar to the Yukon pottery. It was, however, coiled; and coiled pottery was common in the Chinese and Mon 930 Op. tit., Table 10, pp. 73 f. 931 Op. tit., p. 65. 932 AST-J, vol. XLI, PL III; Komaki, 1927, PL X a. 933 Liang, 1930, pp. 75 f. golian Neolithic.934 The coiled ware of the Kurilian Type A pottery was probably derived from it. In Manchuria we find not only flat bottomed vessels, but even pots of situla shape.935 The ridged and grooved rims seem to be produced by applied strips of clay, and the profiles are remarkably similar to those of the Yukon pots, though Torii does not indicate which is the inside and which the outside of the sherds he illustrates.936 In both Manchuria and eastern Mongolia designs are incised or made with small carved stamps.937 A miniature pot from a late Neolithic-early Bronze Age cairn in Manchuria would be, if one removed the handle, a typical Yukon vessel?situla shaped, and decorated with two incised lines and a row of angular dots encircling the neck.938 Pottery from Port Arthur in Manchuria is decorated with incised lines and strips of ap plied clay in bands and circles. There are pat terns of horizontal incised lines, alone or in composition with other elements, such as ver tical angular dots, XXXX figures, and chev rons.939 The pottery made by the Neolithic Tong Hou of Mongolia is made of clay without tem per, is coiled, polished with the hands or with a pebble, set on a mat to dry (thus producing textile prints on the flat bottom), and finally dried in the open air or beside a fire. The pro files of the rims (flat, rounded, thickened, grooved on top, and with grooves and ridges on the outside) are not unlike those from the Yukon.940 Some of this pottery, like that found in eastern Mongolia, Manchuria, and Japan, is coarse, fragile, and brown in color. Decorations are of three kinds: (1) incised with a stick; (2) pressed with a wooden stamp?known from Manchuria, Korea, Sakhalin, and Iron Age Iwaibe ware imported from Korea into Japan; known from China in Han times, if not earlier, and in protohistoric times at Anau;941 (3) textile-decorated, cord-marked, or decorated with a wooden paddle, which Torii called "Iwaibe Neolithic ware."942 The straight-line 934 Bishop, 1933, p. 398; Torii, 1913-1914, p. 50; Liang, 1930, p. 60 note 23. 936 Torii, 1913-1915, Fig. 21,18; Fig. 26. 936 Op. tit., Fig. 22. 937 Op. tit., p. 41; Liang, 1930, p. 58. 938 Torii, 1913-1915, Fig. 41. 939 Op. tit., PL XIV. 940 Torii, 1913-1914, pp. 49 f., Fig. 48. 941 Op. tit., pp. 58 ff. 942 Op. tit., pp. 61, 89 f., PL VIII, 62, 63, 68.</page><page sequence="251">244 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 decorations, incised or pressed with a stick, (type 1), such as were used all over eastern Mongolia, and were introduced from Korea into Japan by the prehistoric Japanese proper, were also made by the Barak, a Mongolian group south of the Solon and Daurians on the Amur, the Koreans, the southern Manchurians, the Primorks of Siberia, and the Ainu of Sak halin. Torii believes that these were copies of the natural markings on birch bark vessels.943 I think it more likely that they were patterns derived from wood carving, while the stamped designs on northern Siberian birch bark ves sels, on the other hand, may have been derived from the designs stamped on pottery (type 2).944 Among the simple designs on Neolithic Mongolian ware (mostly of type 1) we may note: (1) bands of angular dots, (2) groups of double dots made by a split stick, (3) groups of angular or oval dots made with a stamp, (4) a broken zigzag line with a straight line below it, and (5) various combinations of lines and dots.945 All of these simple patterns find their analogies in Ainu, Kamchadal, and southern Eskimo and Tena pottery. As we have learned, this stamped and in cised pottery was introduced into Japan from Korea, and influenced the development of true Japanese (Yayoi and Iwaibe) pottery. It is from the Japanese ware that Schnell believes the Kurilian Type A pottery was copied, but we should not exclude the possibility that the Kuriles received influences coming more di rectly from the mainland. We might note, for example, that while organic temper is not men tioned (to my knowledge) from any of the Honshu Japanese and Ainu wares, or from the earlier Kurilian pottery, it is a characteristic of the Kurilian Type A, and it is known from Mongolia. Thus Torii reports that the present day Mongols of King-han make pottery by coiling, later polishing it with the hands or with a stone, but instead of true clay they take the fine dust of the desert, mixed with dry herbs and ox dung. From this they manufac ture ovens, pots, and stands for metal (?) saucer-shaped lamps.946 Some of the Type A shapes and decorations seem to be more like the Mongolian-Manchuria examples than like the Japanese. 943 Op. tit., pp. 61 f., 64 f., 68. 944 Cf.

Even in the Chinese Neolithic we can find, I believe, the prototypes of some of the features that we found in southern Eskimo pottery. Thus at Hsi-Yin Tsun in Shansi, Liang de scribes an unpainted coarse gray ware,947 tem pered with sand and occasionally with vege table matter, such as reeds, etc. The surface is scraped and smooth, and may be left plain or may be decorated with string impressions, hori zontal lines and grooves near the top, or even with applied wavy bands of clay. The rims are rounded, or bulging, or sometimes bulged with a groove at the top, and are thus quite similar in profile to those on the Yukon pots. The bot toms may be flat or slightly concave. The hori zontal grooving, the rows of "dimple or pit decoration" inside and outside some vessels of this gray and of other plain wares from the site again remind us of southern Eskimo and Tena pottery.948 Similar ware?coarse, thick-walled, with mat and string impressions and incised patterns,?is known from Fengtien and Kan su.949 Liang believes the Yang Shao pottery of Honan to be related to the Hsi-Yin pottery, except that it is a little later and has been influ enced from the east.950 One of the pots from Yang Shao is flat-bottomed, rather tall and slender, bulges to a shoulder, and is then con stricted to flare slightly towards the mouth, and thus reminds us of the situla shape. It is of brownish brick red, related to the coarse gray ware of Hsi-Yin, is handmade, with basketry impressions on the lower part, the upper part scraped smooth.951 A pot from Kansu, dating from the Sha Ching (or Copper Period between the Yang Shao and the Shang Bronze Age), would be, if one omitted the loop handle, quite like a Yukon situla, although more slender and graceful.952 Apparently these proto-situla shapes of the aboriginal Chinese-Mongolian-Man churian string-impressed pottery survived after that pottery had become replaced in Mongolia and Manchuria by the stamped-incised pottery coming from the west. Liang dates the contact between these two types as near the end of the Yang Shao, or about 2000 B.C.953 Some Chinese Neolithic vessels had flat or 947 Liang, 1930, pp. 10 f. 948 Op. tit., Pis. 16 and 17, p. 30. 949 Op. tit., pp. 55 f. 950 Op. tit., pp. 52 f., 55. 961 Andersson, 1923, PL XV, 7, p. 28. 9*2 Bishop, 1933, p. 398, PL IV, 1, 2. 963 Liang, 1930, p. 75.</page><page sequence="252">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 245 concave bottoms, others rounded and conical bottoms,954 like the pottery of the Neolithic Siberians of Lake Baikal, the ancient Koryak, Chukchee, and northern Alaskan Eskimo. I believe that all this northern Siberian and Es kimo pottery belongs to the same large group as does the Neolithic Chinese-Mongolian-Man churian pottery. But whereas the rounded- and conical-bottomed vessels remained dominant in northern Siberia and northern Alaska until relatively late, flat-bottomed, situla-shaped pots, enriched with incised decorations and elaborately modeled rims, traveled north along the chain of the Japanese-Kurile archipelago to Kamchatka, and reappeared in simplified, ster eotyped form in southern Alaska. We have been able to trace a continuous movement from the Asiatic mainland through the islands as far as Kamchatka, but no farther north or east. How did these influences cross to Alaska? So far we have not considered Eskimo pottery south of Bristol Bay. It is so rare that specimens can be counted on the fingers. At the prehis toric site of Hot Springs, Port Moller, on the Alaska Peninsula (probably Eskimo, but near the Aleut boundary), Weyer found "a nondescript fragment, no larger than a thim ble, of red, sandy clay, which may have been baked."955 In the uppermost layer of the Eskimo site at Yukon Island, in Kachemak Bay, a de posit probably representing the last stage of Eskimo culture in that area prior to the Ta naina invasion, I found two fragments of what may have been a lamp or a large vessel with slight curvature. The surface is so roughly smoothed that the tempering material, coarse sand or gravel, is visible on the surface. The amount of temper is excessive, the ware is black, crumbly and not very hard, with a lami nated structure. It has been slightly baked, or perhaps dried by a fire. The ware appears to be intermediate between that of the Tena and the ' Birnirk.956 Jacobsen dug at an abandoned In dian site on Kachemak Bay, which he calls Soonroodna, and which represented the Eski mo-ized culture of the Tanaina just prior to (?) and just after the coming of the Russians. Al though I have not been able to identify the site with certainty, I think it is probably the one I visited in China Poot Bay, although I did 954 Bishop, 1930, p. 389; Liang, 1930, p. 38. 955 Weyer, 1930, p. 263. 966 de Laguna, 1934, p. 68, PL 29,1. not find any pottery there.957 In both the upper and lower layers Jacobsen found "a number of small pieces of earthenware cooking pots, of the same kind that are now used on the Yukon."958 Unfortunately this description is not more specific. In view of the rather close rela tionship between the Tanaina of Cook Inlet and the lower Tena of the Yukon and Kusko kwim it is not surprising that they made similar pottery. Curiously enough, Osgood's Tanaina informants knew nothing about pottery.959 Dr. Birket-Smith and I found no pottery in Prince William Sound, but one of our Chugach in formants mentioned baked clay beads and toy animal figures. The Chugach used to frequent Wingham and Kayak Islands on summer hunt ing trips, and we may therefore consider as of Eskimo manufacture the objects found by Bering's expedition on these two islands. Steller describes a pottery object found by Khitrov in a house on Wingham Island. Unfortunately Khitrov himself fails to mention it in either his journal or log. According to Steller this was "a hollow ball of hard-burned clay, about two inches in diameter, containing a pebble, making a noise when the ball was shaken, which I re garded as a toy for small children."960 The Eyak Indians of the Copper River Delta told us nothing about pottery, but Colonel Aber crombie who visited them in 1884 saw them smoking tobacco in homemade elbow-shaped pipes, apparently sand-tempered and unevenly dried beside a fire.961 Regardless of what inter pretation we put upon these pipes, they repre sent the southernmost extent of pottery on the Northwest Coast. I am indebted to Dr. Robert F. Heizer for a note about pottery on Kodiak Island. He writes (May 3, 1939): When I was on Kodiak several years ago, it seemed to be an accepted fact that at Alitak Bay there were quantities of potsherds in the sites. ... It was a thick (J to J inch), black, shell tempered, crumbly pottery. The shapes (from hearsay) are mostly a large jar, olla form, probably used for cooking or storage. If correctly identified, such shell tempering is, as far as I know, unique for Eskimo pottery, and I am unable to offer any explanation for its occurrence. 967 Op. tit., pp. 21 f. 958 Jacobsen, 1884, p. 372 (my translation). 959 Osgood, 1937, p. 77. 960 Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, pp. 348 f.; Steller in Golder, vol. 2, p. 53 and note 101. 961 Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, pp. 76 f., Fig. 6.</page><page sequence="253">246 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 I have already published a description of a large cooking pot from Three Saints Bay, Kodiak Island.962 The shape is a modified situla, the ware is tempered with an excessive amount of flat pebbles, ranging up to 1.5 cm in size, the color varies on the surface from buff to dark gray or black, and in the interior of the wall from buff to bright brick red. The surface is wiped smooth and is fired quite hard, though the paste itself is rather crumbly. The smooth surface, the color of the ware, the degree of firing, and, to a lesser extent, the shape of this vessel indicate that it should be classed with the Norton Sound-Bristol Bay pottery, and thus proves that at one time this southern Es kimo pottery was found as far south as Kodiak Island and Kachemak Bay. On Atka, one of the more remote of the Aleu tian Islands, Jochelson found "half of an un baked clay lamp, which fell to pieces when touched. This was the only trace of Aleut pot tery."963 Dall had previously found on the same island a "lamp carved from unbaked clay."964 The latter, however, we can hardly call pottery, since it was neither molded nor modeled. Jochel son thinks the Aleut lacked pottery "possibly as a result of the absence of clay."965 Dall, how ever, says that "a good quality of fire-clay" is found on Umnak Island.966 Clay was sometimes used in building up the sides of the stone frying pan, suggesting that the Aleut had either a very primitive or a degenerate and vestigial knowl edge of pottery.967 Although pottery is so rare in southwestern Alaska, it is only here that we can hope to find the links between the southern Eskimo and Tena style and that of the northern Ainu and Kamchadal. The Aleutian Islands present themselves as the only route by which these influences could have traveled to Alaska. I have already pointed out that Jochelson's archaeo ological material from these islands all comes from sites near the present shore, while both Petroff and Veniaminoff report that the oldest sites are on the hillsides, at former beach 962 de Laguna, 1939 b. I have only recently been able to examine the potsherds collected by Hrdlidka from southern Kodiak sites. The ware is very similar to that of the south ern Eskimo and Tena. The neck of one pot, a modified situla, is grooved and ridged outside. 963 Jochelson, 1925, p. 28. 984 Dall, 1877 b, p. 80, and Fig. 15021. 966 Jochelson, 1925, p. 122. 988 Dall, 1870, p. 478. 987 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, p. 104. levels.968 Thus the fact that Jochelson found no pottery at the sites which he explored is not conclusive proof that the Aleut had never known it, and Jochelson himself keeps an open mind about the possibility of finding some.969 The pottery in Kamchatka which resembles the southern Eskimo-Tena pottery dates from the eleventh to the eighteenth centuries; the Kurilian Ainu Type A ware, which is also like our southern Alaskan pottery, probably was made during the same period, since the proto Japanese Yayoi pottery that influenced its de velopment spread to north Honshu at the end of the tenth century. Thus, I would expect to find similar pottery, either local imitations or traded pieces, on the Aleutians about the end of the first millennium a.d. or the beginning of the second. It is at about this time, i.e. at the be ginning of Kachemak Bay III, a cultural stage represented all over southwestern Alaska, that we find many traits of similarity between the Pacific Eskimo-Aleut and the Kamchadal Ainu, which argue trade between the two areas.970 Certainly the imported pottery left little trace of its passage, probably because it intruded into an area that had never had pot tery before, and where food was cooked by means of hot stones in baskets or wooden ves sels. Poorly-made pottery had little chance to compete with highly developed basketry and woodworking techniques, and so vanished from southwestern Alaska, except from Kodiak Is land, where it lasted on until the time of the Russian conquest. As Jochelson says, lack of suitable clay may have played a role, also. In the Norton Sound-Bristol Bay area, where pot tery had doubtless been established for a long time, the new style of pottery was the more readily adopted since the situla shape was not very different from the flat-bottomed straight sided vessels inherited from Old Bering Sea times, and because the incised patterns re sembled the traditional decorative art for bone and ivory. The new style apparently did not travel much above the mouth of the Koyukuk, indeed was typical only of the valley below Nulato, and it was not able to supplant the earlier paddle-decorated vessels north of Bering Strait. Perhaps it might have been able to make 968 de Laguna, 1934, pp. 218 f. 969 Jochelson, 1905-1908, p. 642. The concrete-like pot tery from early levels on Amaknak Island (Quimby, 1945 b) is quite different from anything we have discussed, and seems only to complicate the problem. 970 de Laguna, 1934, pp. 216 ff.</page><page sequence="254">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 247 more of an impression north of Norton Sound, had not the northern Eskimo pottery been transformed in protohistoric times by the intro duction of soapstone pots from the east, and had not the coming of the white man with his iron kettles halted the development of Eskimo pottery. I do not believe that the sherds which Jacobsen and I found in Kachemak Bay were derived directly from the imported pottery, for if they were, I should have found such pottery in the Kachemak Bay III sites that I explored. I believe that they are much later in date, and were introduced into Kachemak Bay by the Tanaina, who either learned the art or traded the pottery from their relatives on the Kus kokwim. We have thus endeavored to trace all Es kimo pottery back to a common basic ware, and to the shapes characteristic of the Old Bering Sea-Birnirk-Punuk. This common Eskimo pot tery seems to be related to the crude rock- and organic-tempered wares of northeastern Asia. In northern Alaska and northeastern Siberia we find the prehistoric pottery consisting of rounded- or conical-bottomed pots, with straight or barrel-shaped sides, and rough sur face decorated with textile and paddle im pressions. This type of decoration reached its culmination in the elaborately paddled ware of the Birnirk. This was succeeded in protohis toric times by rectangular, flat-bottomed pots with suspension lugs, copied after soapstone pots introduced by the Thule return from Canada. In the south, Old Bering Sea ware and shape seem to have lingered only in marginal areas, while in the Norton Sound-Bristol Bay region the old pottery (as yet unfound) under went a renaissance in late prehistoric times be cause of the introduction of new shapes and decorative styles from the Kuriles and Kam chatka. Before abandoning the subject of Eskimo pottery it would be well to ask whether it has any relatives on the North American conti nent. In order to see what pottery we shall have to consider, I append a list of its occurrence in northern and western Indian areas. Pottery Among the Northern and Western Indians Makah: Make no pottery (Swan, 1870, p. 48), but for pipes they "seem to prefer a clay bowl, to which they affix a stem made of a dried branch of the pubus spectabilis," from which the pith is removed (p. 27). Coast Salish: Quinault: "Pipes were made of a kind of clay which hardened on contact with the air. The only one of native manufacture which I saw was of a pattern not very different from an Irish clay pipe. A lizard repre senting a guardian spirit was carved in low relief at the juncture of bowl and stem." (Olson, 1936, p. 137.) In pre-European times " 'winter berries' or 'shot berries' were smoked in an elbow (angled) pipe carved from the hard blue clay to be found near natural gas wells" (note 55). "A clay figure resembling a pheasant was placed on a log and nooses of nettle fiber or elk sinew placed on either side at a distance of about two and one-half feet. The male pheasant, thinking the figure another bird, approached to fight or mate, and was caught" (p. 50). Interior Salish: Thompson: Pipes were sometimes made of "white clay." (Teit, 1898-1900, p. 300.) Middle Columbia: "Pipes were occasionally made of antler, wood, and clay." (Teit, 1928, p. 125.) Okanogan: Made holes in clay as emergency cooking pots, and may also have made clay pipes. (Ray, 1932, note 14.) Colville: A sherd of real fired pottery has been found in their territory. (Ray, 1932, note 6, pp. 40 f.) Sanpoil and Nespellem: "At least one type of clay pot, always supplied with an outer covering of fish skin, was made and utilized in former times. It was not used for cooking, but solely for carrying water." It was made of white clay from the Columbia River banks, without any admixture except water. It was molded in a form, either a hole in the sand or a cooking basket, which was peeled off before the pot was completely dry. These vessels were not fired, but were only dried in the sun. They were elliptical in cross section, taper ing gradually from top to bottom. Clay was also modeled for dolls' heads or for the ring used in the dart game, but was not used for pipes. (Ray, 1932, pp. 39 f.) Kutenai: Made real fired pottery. (Ray, 1932, note 6, pp. 40 f.) Shoshoni of Snake River, Central Idaho: "The artifacts include a type of pottery hitherto unrecorded in this region, and it differs in form from the pointed base vessels of the Paiute to the south. It is a plain, coarse ware, with flat bottom and with a rim of greater di ameter than the base. Shaped like an inverted trun cated cone, it is devoid of neck or shoulders, but is provided with a flange around the base." (Ray, 1932, p. 131 quoting Schellback). A pot from the Snake River near Boise, Idaho, has a flat bottom, and sides that flare to the plain rim. It has a rather fine sand temper, and is built up by patch-coiling with flat strips that do not quite encircle the vessel (WSM 2-564). This pottery may represent an isolated extension of Southwestern pottery. Catlow Valley, southeastern Oregon: Archaeological (?) pot tery vessels. (Heizer, 1937, map in Fig. 4.) Athabaskans of Chetco River, southwestern Oregon: Made clay pipes and figurines. (Heizer, 1937, map in Fig. 4.)

Foothill Yokuts-Mono: Represent northernmost group of California pottery makers. Pottery found archaeologi cally in the Sacramento Valley. (Ray, 1932, p. 129.) Plains Athabaskans, Sarcee of Alberta: Made cooking pots of clay tempered with limestone (?) burned to powder, twigs, and horse hair (formerly dog, caribou, or buf falo hair?). The clay was kneaded and hollowed out by hand, dried in the sun, and was "baked black by fires applied both inside and out." The vessels were clumsy, flat-bottomed, cylindrical pots, with bucket-like handles of wood or antler, fastened to holes in the rim. They also made pipes, trays, and toy animal figures. (Sapir, 1923, pp. 248-252.) Archaeological pot tery from Red Deer River, Alberta, has fabric or cord markings. That from Long Lake, Alberta, has a notched rim (p. 252.) Northern Algonkians Cree, Ojibway, Menomini; especially Blackfoot: Cook ing pot made of mud, tempered with sand. Molded over a greased rawhide bag filled with sand. When the pot is shaped, the sand is poured out and the bag removed. The pot is then filled with fat and cooked over a fire. It is tested by boiling water in it. It is suspended by a cord around the rim. The pot would further harden through use. They also made pipes, cut from blocks of hard clay, rubbed with fat, hardened over the fire and through use. (Wissler, 1916, pp. 66, 70.) Manitoba: Archaeological pottery from Lake Wanipigow had rounded and flat bottoms. (Fewkes, note 97.) Archaeological pottery from Red River was molded (over a form?), and showed a laminated structure. The bottoms were shaped by hand. Were made by Siouan or Caddoan groups. (Fewkes, 1937, pp. 145 f.) Woodland pottery has been found in Manitoba north of Lake Winnipeg. (McKern, 1937, p. 142.) Siouan: Mandan-Hidatsa (typical of upper Mississippi and Great Lakes): "The vessel is worked out from a single block of clay, then beaten into shape with a paddle, fired, rubbed with grease, and coated with a solution of boiled maize." (Wissler, 1916, p. 70.) Caddoan Pawnee: Made vessels in the Mandan-Hidatsa method (Wissler, 1916, p. 70.) Of the examples cited, the clay pipe bowls made by the Makah, Quinault, Thompson, Middle Columbia Salish, Okanogan, Atha baskans of Chetco River, Northern Paiute, and Klamath are probably not true pottery, for where the information is specific we find that the bowls are carved, not molded or modeled. Wissler has compared the pottery of the northern Algonkians, Mandan-Hidatsa and Pawnee with that of the Eskimo because it is worked from a mass of clay, paddled, and soaked with fat for firing. Because of these points of similarity he believed that the Es kimo-Chukchee and upper Mississippi-Great Lakes pottery areas were probably once con nected somewhere west of Hudson Bay.971 The prehistoric Pawnee and Siouan pottery pub lished by Strong from Nebraska does not seem to resemble Eskimo pottery very closely, except that it is grit (rock) tempered and paddled. The shapes are quite different.972 The earlier pottery in Nebraska does not seem to resemble Eskimo ware any more closely than the latter Nebraska types. Strong says definitely that the Upper Republican (prehistoric Pawnee) pottery was not treated with oil, although a bright red hematite stain was sometimes put on the inside of pots before firing.973 Some of the pottery of the prehistoric Nebraska culture (prehistoric Sioux) seems to have been boiled in maize (?) oil, and on it white slips are occasionally found.974 I doubt whether these few points of resemblance are significant enough to establish a connection with Eskimo pottery?at least, any connection more intimate than there might be between Eskimo pottery and that of many Indian groups. Sapir, on the other hand, suggests the possi bility of a relationship between Eskimo and Sarcee pottery. The greatest points of differ ence are the use of burned stone for tempering the Sarcee pottery, as contrasted to sand or gravel for the Eskimo, and the use of a handle for the Sarcee pots. The shape of the flat bottomed, straight-sided Sarcee pot, on the other hand, is closer to that of Eskimo pots than is that of the globular bowl of the upper Missis sippi-Great Lakes pottery. I know of only one pot from the north that approaches in shape the latter pottery. This is a rather small vessel from the Eskimo or Chukchee of Siberia, shaped like a goldfish bowl.975 Sapir writes:976 It is natural to look upon the pottery of the Blackfoot and Sarcee country as but a marginal outpost of the more in tensive pottery culture of the Mississippi Valley and the western Great Lakes. Is it not at least possible, however, that the old Sarcee pottery, of which the Indians retain such a clear tradition, is the survival of a northern type that is historically connected with Eskimo ware or that it represents a compromise between northern and eastern streams of influence? The early habitat of the Sarcee was at the headwaters of the North Saskatchewan and Athabaska Rivers. It is by no means a foregone conclusion that the Eskimo 971 Wissler, 1916, p. 71. In the third edition (1938, pp. 66 ff.) he merely suggests this as a possibility. 972 Strong, 1935, pp. 58 f., 64 ff., 79 ff., 82 ff., 129 ff. 973 Op. tit., p. 247. 974 Op. tit., p. 251. 976 WSM 884. 976 Sapir, 1923, pp. 252 f.</page><page sequence="256">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 249 pottery area is geographically disconnected from the south ern area. That the present Athabaskan tribes north of the Sarcee (aside from Alaskan peoples close to the Eskimo) know or seem to know nothing of pottery proves little. He also discussed the Athabaskan words for cooking vessel. Presumbly the Athabaskan term originally referred to a pail-like or kettle-like receptacle of bark, only secondarily to ODe of clay. And yet can we be sure its primary meaning was not "clay pot"? If it was, we could understand why it was lost in the Pacific dialects, for a term for clay cooking vessel would not be readily used for one of twined basketry, while a term for a bark vessel conceivably might be. Ad mittedly, however, this is a tenuous argument. Whether or not there is any relationship be tween Sarcee or upper Mississippi pottery and that of the Eskimo and Tena can only be deter mined on the basis of archaeological work in the as yet unexplored northern Athabaskan area. If pottery-making was a trait that extended continuously from Alaska to the upper Missis sippi it must have been at a very early time, and we would probably find that we should have to compare Eskimo pottery with a far wider range of Indian pottery types than we suspect at present. Wissler and Sapir have raised problems for future research, but our present data is insufficient to suggest the answer. LAMPS The stone lamp with human figure in the bowl, found on the Khotol just below Old Fish Camp (PL XXI, J), is a typical specimen of the Kachemak Bay III culture.977 Petroff has made the assertion that the Eskimo once lived within 40 or 50 miles of Nulato, that is, in the Kaltag-Khotol area, but were driven south by the Indians.978 Aside from the finding of this lamp, I can find no support for this statement. However, the lamp may well have been traded, since it is small and easily carried, unlike the three large lamps with human figure from Fish Creek, on Cook Inlet, and Kenai Lake. If traded it must have been derived from Cook Inlet (or possibly Kodiak Island), for these are the only localities where such lamps have been found,979 although plain oval stone lamps have been reported from as far north as St. Michael.980 While most of the lamps in the Tena area were of pottery, Andrew Pilot stated that stone 977 de Laguna, 1934, p. 66, PL 28. 978 Petroff, 1884, p. 5. 979 de Laguna, 1934, pp. 177 f., note 189; Hrdlicka, 1932, Fig. 97. ?8&lt;&gt; E. W. Nelson, 1899, PI. XVIII, 6. lamps were sometimes used on the Koyukuk. Unfortunately we have no means of knowing whether these were simply emergency forms of no particular significance, or whether they represented a regular, though probably not very common, item of Koyukuk economy. The only stone vessels which we found were nat urally hollow stones, with but slight shaping, and we cannot prove that any of these were lamps (PL XII, 4 from Kateel, PL XXI, 2, 4 from Anvik Point, and an unillustrated speci men from Bonasila). In any case, these Koyu kuk stone lamps must be recognized as occupy ing the extreme edge of the southern stone lamp area. In a previous discussion of the stone lamps with human figure, of which there are some seven examples,9811 emphasized the resemblances between certain of their decorative features and those of ancient stone bowls from the Coast Salish area. These were the encircling groove outside below the rim, the human face in front of the bowl, and the type of features of the human figure in the bowl (embracing the bowl in the Salish carvings). A few decorative fea tures on the three larger lamps, however, are non-Salish. These are the three groups of raised elements on the rim (at the back and at the two sides), appearing as bear's heads on the Kenai Lake lamp and the Juneau lamp from Fish Creek, and as simple knobs on the New York lamp from Fish Creek. The small animal's head on the rim of the Kodiak lamp is similar. On the three large lamps there are elements in low relief on the inside and outside, correspond ing to the three groups of projections on the rim. On the Kenai Lake lamp and on the New York lamp from Fish Creek, four sets of festoons in low relief connect these outside figures. Now the making of this type of relief decoration on a hard stone vessel requires an amount of labor disproportionate to the effect achieved. One wonders why the Eskimo should have hit on just this form of decoration. Both the knobs on the rim and the festoons are, how ever, characteristic of prehistoric Ainu pottery 881 Three small lamps without external decoration: Khotol River; Yukon Fox Farm III, Kachemak Bay (de Laguna, 1934, PL 28); and of unknown provenience in the museum at Sitka (PL 70, 1); three large lamps with ex ternal decoration: two from Fish Creek, Cook Inlet, one now at Juneau, the second (PL 70,2) at the Museum of the American Indian, and the third from Kenai Lake, Kenai Peninsula, now in the U of PM (PL 69); a small lamp with human figure, on its back, not sitting up as on the other lamps, and an animal's head at the lip end, from Uyak Bay, Kodiak Island, now at the USNM. (Cf. pp. 177 f.)</page><page sequence="257">250 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 from the Kuriles and from Japan, where they were easily made by applying lumps and bands of clay to the vessel walls. On some occasions (we have already cited examples from the Kuriles and from the vicinity of Tokyo), the knobs on the rim or the spout of a vessel might be shaped like an animal's head or a face. I suggest, there fore, that the appearance of such decoration on the stone lamps proves that their makers actu ally saw pottery with this type of decoration, even though they chose to copy it in stone, not in crude clay. Their more northern relatives in the Norton Sound-Bristol Bay area copied the pottery styles in pottery, but simplified the decoration into knobs on the rim and plain bands of clay around the inside of the pot. If I am right in ascribing these particular features of the decorated stone lamps to Ainu influence, then that influence must have reached Alaska in the Kachemak Bay III period, a date which fits those established for the related Kurilian and Kamchadal wares. These decorated lamps must have been cere monial in function. The thanksgiving ceremony of the Maritime Chukchee and Asiatic Eskimo in honor of Kere'tkun, the deity controlling sea-mammal hunting, suggests a possible use. In the Siberian ceremony, "A big lamp filled with the choicest oil is lighted," and is set in a special place in the house. Kere'tkun is supposed to enter, and, taking his place on the lamp, to wait for the sacrifice. He is represented by a small wooden image (Fig. 279), which is put on the lamp and remains there till the end of the ceremonial.982 The Chukchee make a sacrificial fire opposite the lamp. The Asiatic Eskimo substitute for the fire another big lamp; or they sacrifice to Kere'tkun on the lamp where he has taken his place. After the ceremony, which includes the eating of a whole reindeer, cooked over the lamp with the image, the little figure is burned.983 Does this not suggest that the Cook Inlet Eskimo may have had a somewhat similar practice, and that they chose to carve their deity permanently in their ceremonial lamp? The use of two lamps by the Asiatic Eskimo may explain why a small, rather plain lamp was found with the decorated lamp on Yukon Is land.984 982 Bogoras, 1904r-1909, II, p. 397. 983 Op. tit., II, p. 398. For a complete description of the ceremony, cf. pp. 392-399. 984 de Laguna, 1934, p. 66, PL 25, 2. It would be rash to speculate on how the lamp from the Khotol River was used. That lamps had some ceremonial function for the Tena is suggested by their use in the kashim ceremony honoring the recently deceased (see Chapter IV). Petroff mentions that a stone lamp was used for the same purpose by the Norton Sound Eskimo.985 The problem of the relative ages of the stone lamp and the pottery lamp in Eskimo culture has been argued many times. To date, the champions of the priority of the stone lamp have been Hough and Birket-Smith, and of the pottery lamp, Mathiassen and Collins.986 Since Collins is the last writer on the subject, and has not only summarized the arguments of his predecessors but has been able to use the more recent archaeological data, it will be well to consider his position: Pottery lamps are the only kind found in the Old Bering Sea-Birnirk Punuk cultures, and are therefore the original Eskimo type. The Thule lamp was made of stone, perhaps under Dorset influence, and the modified modern Central Eskimo descendant of the Thule stone lamp was introduced into northern Alaska along with the return of the Thule culture from Canada. Pottery is wide spread in early anfl primitive horizons in north ern Eurasia, and the pottery lamp itself has been found in the Danish Ertebolle culture, so the pottery lamp was probably the original type brought by the first Eskimo into Alaska. The stone lamps of southwestern Alaska, the Northwest Coast and Kamchatka form an ex tension of a stone-vessel, non-pottery area in 985 Petroff, 1884, pp. 130,131. 986 Hough, 1898, p. 1038: The Yukon-Kuskokwim clay lamps seem to be intruded into a stone lamp area, or rep resent the substitution of clay for stone. "The shape of the Yukon type, the absence of a definite wick edge or Up, and the method of burning by a wick brought up at the side relate them to the lamps of eastern Asia, or the simple dish lamps of diverse ages and peoples." Birket-Smith, 1929, II, pp. 100 ff.: Distribution of the stone lamp on both sides of the pottery lamp proves it to be the older type. The naturally hollow stone is the oldest form of Eskimo lamp, then came the oval-shaped lamp, and finally the crescentic lamp with long wick edge (pp. 189 ff.). The bowl-shaped lamp for illumination belongs to the Ice hunting stage and can be traced back to the Upper Paleo lithic of Europe. Mathiassen, 1930 c, p. 598: "The lamp is an Asiatic ele ment introduced into America by the Eskimo, probably at first as a round or oval clay vessel, later on made of soap stone." Collins, 1937 a, pp. 341 ff.</page><page sequence="258">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 251 North America. The stone lamp developed in western North America and was carried from there around the North Pacific into Asia, where it intruded into a pottery-making region. This argument is very persuasive, but whether or not it can be taken as conclusive depends on whether one takes the presence of the pottery lamp in the Old Bering Sea culture as more significant than the stone lamps of the Kachemak Bay and Dorset cultures, and this in turn depends on the evaluation of these three cultures as clues pointing back towards an original Eskimo culture. It is quite possible that the first people whom we could have recog nized as Eskimo possessed lamps of both stone and pottery and that an exclusive choice was made by later Eskimo groups. Or Eskimo cul ture may have been formed by groups some of whom had stone lamps, others pottery lamps, and others again (like the Ipiutak Eskimo) no lamps at all. I doubt whether the evidence we possess today is sufficient to solve the prob lem. In any case, a satisfactory solution must take into account the fact that the Old Bering Sea pottery lamp lies within a northern pottery area that stretches far beyond the Eskimo, that the Dorset stone lamp lies within an area of prehistoric Eskimo and Indian soapstone ves sels, and that the stone lamps of southwestern Alaska lie within a still wider area of stone vessels that stretches south to California, the Southwest, and even into Mexico. One difficulty has been our almost uncon scious assumption that use of pottery and use of stone for vessels are mutually exclusive, and that development of either technique was bound to act as a barrier against introduction of the other. We need only see the magnificent pottery of the Hohokam and their equally fine stone vessels to realize how proficiency in ma nipulating both materials can develop simul taneously to technical perfection. Among the Kurilian Ainu, as we shall see, exactly the same type of lamp was made in both stone and pottery, and they also made pottery cooking vessels and stone mortars. Perhaps at the pres ent time, it would be more fruitful to discuss the shapes of Eskimo lamps than to speculate upon the material of which they were originally made. Hough has explained the variations in the shapes of Eskimo lamps as due to environ mental causes such as temperature (climate), amount of light (latitude), available types of fuel supply and of materials for manufacture. In contrasting the narrow wick lip of the oval Kodiak lamp with the long wick edge of the modern Central Eskimo lamps, he says: "This seems to be due to the smaller need for light in the south, where the arctic night is not so long. However, Asiatic or other influence to the west may be the cause." The long crescent shaped modern Central Eskimo lamps on the other hand are adapted to the rigors of the Canadian Arctic, and are "the result of an attempt to devise a vessel with a long, nearly straight wick edge combined with a reser voir."987 Mathiassen sets up the following sequence of lamp types: round or oval pottery lamps, brought into America by the first Eskimos, then made in the same shape in both stone and pottery; then the stone Thule lamp, a rounded half-moon with a row of knobs across the straight wick edge, the rounded shape being derived from the older round pottery lamp; soapstone vessels (and I assume that he in cludes both lamps and cooking pots) did not belong to the earliest Thule culture (in Alas ka?), but superseded pottery vessels only when the Thule culture became established in Cana da; finally we have the longer half-moon shaped soapstone lamps of the modern Central and Greenland Eskimo, developed from the Ca nadian Thule lamp, but lacking a row of knobs or a ridge. The interior is instead plain, or may have a partition across the back; and this is the type recently introduced into northern Alaska from the east.988 In this discussion of lamps, as well as in his discussion of cooking pots, Mathiassen puts an emphasis upon the influence that the material has upon the shape. Rounded forms result from the use of pottery, and rounded stone vessels are copies of pottery prototypes. Birket-Smith989 has pointed out the dangers of this assumption. One further consideration needs discussion, and that is the use to which the lamps were put?for light, heat, cooking. Birket-Smith writes:990 Within the Eskimo region there are two places where no blubber flame [in a lamp] ever burns under the cooking pot: the Barren Grounds and Alaska south of Kotzebue Sound, including the Aleutians. This is not due to lack of blubber or fat in these areas, or to an abundance of drift wood for open 987 Hough, 1898, pp. 1033, 1038, 1040. 988 Mathiassen, 1930 a, pp. 89 ff. 989 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, p. 104. 990 Op. tit., II, pp. 99 ff.</page><page sequence="259">252 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 fires, nor is it due to a lack of the lamp itself in these areas. Cooking over fires, which is the only generally diffused form of cooking among the Eskimos, is obviously the oldest form;. . . originally the lamp only served the purpose of illumination and only later has acquired its dominating position as the center of domestic life. The oval and round lamps of southern Alaska and the still cruder naturally hollow stone lamps of the Caribou Eskimo are primitive both in shape and in function; the modern Central Eskimo and Greenland lamps with long wick edge have developed with the use of the lamp for cooking. Recent archaeological evidence supports this position. In all of Alaska, from Point Barrow to Prince William Sound, the prehistoric Es kimo cultures have failed to reveal any cooking pots with means of suspension so they could be hung above the lamp. The lamps, themselves, with one or two possible exceptions which we shall presently mention, have no long wick edges, and so could not have produced enough heat to cook a pot, even were a suspended pot available. The first pots suspended above lamps appear in northern Alaska with the proto historic return of the Thule culture^. These are the rectangular soapstone vessels imported from the east, or the local copies made in clay. At the same time, as far as the archaeological evi dence from St. Lawrence Island and from Puoten Bay would indicate, the larger lamp with two bridges and two long wicks supplants the round Old Bering Sea-Birnirk-Punuk lamp. The development of the lamp for cooking and of the suspended cooking pot could not have taken place in Alaska; we must look to the east. If we disregard the two lamps of unbaked clay from the Aleutian Islands and the two potsherds, which may have been fragments of a lamp, from Kachemak Bay, all the lamps in southwestern Alaska are of stone. The domi nant form is a pointed oval, with a place cut away at the narrow end for a wick. On some lamps a medial groove runs down the center of the bowl to direct the flow of oil to the wick. Variations in the outline range from almost round to the squarish shapes that are some times found on the Aleutian Islands. Pointed oval stone lamps were made by the Tlingit (although they are sometimes in the shape of an animal or fish), by the Chugach, prehistoric Eskimo of Kachemak Bay II and subsequent periods, Tanaina of Cook Inlet, Eskimo of Kodiak Island, Aleut, and Eskimo of the Alaska Peninsula.991 The most northern examples are a stone lamp from St. Michael and a modern pottery specimen from St. Lawrence Island.992 There are also two crude stone lamps from Puoten Bay, Siberia, made of boulders with small, deep rectangular-oval wells.993 Although the Koryak made round (?) lamps of stone, pottery, or bone, these were sometimes equipped with a lip for the wick.994 Unfor tunately, the only lamp from Kachemak Bay I is a small round hunter's lamp,995 but I think it safe to assume that the full-sized lamps of this period were oval, like those of the later stages of the culture. The lamps of the Dorset culture are of two types: oval, and scoop- or plate-shaped. Like all the elements of the culture, they are small as compared to analogous specimens from other Eskimo groups. The oval lamps are generally narrowed at one end where the wick rested, and one specimen from Coats Island in Hudson Bay even has a medial groove to direct the oil to the wick. Other specimens are so small that they may be only toys.996 Larger, deeper oval lamps of sandstone, soapstone, and gneiss are known from the Dorset culture of Newfound land.997 The smaller, shallower oval lamps have also been found in Newfoundland, for Patterson describes soapstone specimens that are only 2 or 3 inches deep and 3 or 4 inches wide. "Some have a small groove in the upper edge, sup posed by some to be intended for a wick," i.e., a wick lip.998 Erik Holtved has also found small oval soapstone lamps at Dorset sites in the Thule district of northwest Greenland.999 These oval Dorset lamps are so similar to the oval lamps of southwestern Alaska, even to such features as the wick lip and groove to direct the flow of oil, that we must admit some 991 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, p. 190; de Laguna, 1934; pp. 63 ff., 145 ff., 176; Osgood, 1937, PL 11 A, B. 992 E.

If they are related, then they must be very old, just as old as the Old Bering Sea round, conical-bottomed pot tery lamps. The oval stone lamp thus seems to take its place among the ancient elements link ing the Dorset with the ancient Eskimo cul ture in southwestern Alaska. Furthermore, these small Dorset lamps could certainly have been used for no other purpose than to furnish light, and it is, therefore, natural to compare them with the modern Caribou Eskimo lamp of naturally hollow stone which was used for lighting alone. Is it possible that the latter is a degenerate form of the neatly made Dorset lamp? Such degeneration of workmanship can be paralleled by other examples of poor crafts manship from the Central Eskimo. We have already said that the round pottery lamp of the Old Bering Sea, Birnirk, and Punuk cultures has survived in a modified form in the round saucer-shaped lamps of the Norton Sound-Bristol Bay area. What is the relation ship of the round conical-bottomed lamp of northern Alaska and eastern Siberia to the oval lamp of the Dorset and southwestern Eskimo cultures? Did both types belong to an original Eskimo culture? Did both come as independent and unrelated traits to different early Eskimo cultures? Was one the original Eskimo form from which the other was derived? I doubt whether the data at present available is suf ficient to solve this problem. Certainly the Old Bering Sea lamp is the less specialized of the two. Hough has written:1000 The simplest lamps, not makeshifts, and definitely used over great culture areas of the world are mere saucers with no footing for the wick, which is brought up to the rim at any place, where it hangs insecurely. This was the uni versal lamp of China and Japan [and of the Old Bering Sea culture]. It is of very ancient origin, perhaps the most ancient lighting vessel designed by man, at a period of culture when his needs required a house light. Perhaps the original model was a shell of smooth outline. There were endless hints that the wick should have a groove at least in which to rest, and this step was taken by most of the lamp -using world. Actually the oldest known lamps are those of the Upper Paleolithic of Europe. They are made of stone and have a variety of shapes ranging from that of a naturally hollow stone to partially shaped round or ovoid (often with a handle-like projection) and semi-circular forms. The particular shapes seem to be largely 1000 Hough, 1929, p. 53. fortuitous, and there is no evidence that any one shape was established.1001 If Hough is cor rect and the circular form was the first es tablished shape, then the Old Bering Sea lamp is truly primitive, and the oval Dorset and southwestern Alaskan lamps represent a more recent specialization, although not necessarily a specialization made by the Eskimo them selves. Collins believes that pottery lamps belong to the ancient Ice-hunting horizon, and cites pot tery lamps from an ancient site on the Ya-mal Peninsula in northwestern Siberia and pottery lamps from the Danish Mesolithic (Ertebp'lle) culture as evidence of the extreme age of this type.1002 The shape of the Ya-mal lamps is un known to me, but the Erteb^lle lamps (5000 to 3000 B.C.) are a pointed oval.1003 Are the lat ter, therefore, local specializations from a round prototype, the shape of which was pre served in Alaska? Or is the Old Bering Sea lamp degenerate in shape, and do the Dorset and southwestern Alaskan lamps preserve in stone the oval shape first to be established for ancient lamps? There is still a third possibility, and that is that the oval Eskimo lamps were derived from a source distinct from the northern Ice-hunting culture area. Hough has published pointed oval lamps of stone and pottery from Ceylon and from Kashmir, India.1004 On some of these, the narrow wick end is elongated into an open spoutlike projection. This same open spout is found on round pottery lamps from Buddhist shrines at the Chinese site on the lower Tarim River, near Lop Nor, in eastern Turkestan, dating from a.d. 260 to 330.1005 It is from oval lamps with an open spout, Hough argues, that the spouted lamps of classical antiquity were developed. In pottery and metal a true spout could be made?at first open, like that of a pitcher, later closed, like that of a teapot? because with these pliable materials it was easy to bend in the sides of the open dish.1006 We might note that pointed oval, shell, stone and metal lamps, with or without an open 1001 de Saint-Perrier, 1926, Figs. 10, 12-16; Institut de PalSontologie Humaine, Paris, E-1920-2. 1002 Collins, 1937 a, pp. 343, 348. 1003 Mathiassen, 1935; Clark, 1936, Fig. 53, 5. 1004 Hough, 1929, PL 2 a, 7-10; PL 41 b, 10-13 (India), PL 54, 9-11 (Ceylon).

What appear to have been oval stone lamps, sometimes with carved sides, and with a hole at the rear end, have been found in prehistoric sites in Japan.1009 Oval lamps of both stone and pottery, furnished with holes in the rear, were made by the ancient and modern Ainu of the Kuriles.1010 Torii describes the stone lamps. They had the shape of a tiny boat, with a kind of handle pierced by a hole, which enabled the lamp to be set on top of a stick stuck in the ground inside the house. One could thus carry it around here and there in the hut, without danger of tipping it over. Some of the oval or "sad-iron" shaped stone lamps of the ancient Kamchadal had similar holes. I have already compared these to the hunter's lamps of the Aleut, in which case, how ever, the hole was used to suspend the small lamp from the hunter's belt (at least during historic times).1011 I suggest, therefore, that the pointed oval lamp reached the Eskimo from the North Pacific area and was perhaps ultimately derived from southeastern Asia, or even from farther west. It must have come long ago to have been present in both the Dorset culture (in Canada and Greenland) and in the Kachemak Bay II (and I?) culture. Fur thermore, it was not confined to the Eskimo but traveled down the Pacific coast, for we not only find it among the Tlingit but also among the Lillouet, who used it for the salmon ceremony, but usually made it so ornate that the oval shape was obscured.1012 A typical ex ample with charred wick lip from the southern 1007 Woolley, 1934, p. 283, PL 101 a (shell), Pis. 173 a, 240 (metal), p. 183, PL 182 a (stone).

I. Smith, 1913, PL IV, "mortar or anvil," but shaped like an oval lamp. California coast is in the Santa Barbara Mu seum. I would place the oval lamp, therefore, among the elements of the ancient North Pa cific continuum. It is possible that the. high wooden stands, characteristic of the Bristol Bay and Norton Sound area, are related to the hole and stick stands of the Ainu (and Kamchadal ?), and to the handles and stands commonly associated with Asiatic lamps. Collins informs me that the Koryak lamp stand1013 is identical with that used by the Nunivak Island Eskimo. These stands, however, must have diffused much more recently, presumably during the circum-Pacific culture drift. Collins, on the other hand, argues that the pointed oval lamp of stone was invented in southwestern Alaska and was thence intro duced into Kamchatka and the Kuriles via the Aleutian chain. The presence of pottery at all of the known prehistoric sites in Kamchatka and its absence in the Aleutian Islands would itself tend to preclude the idea of a west to east movement (from Kamchatka to the Aleutians), for if this had occurred, it would seem that pottery would have been introduced into the latter region.1014 However, this argument loses its force when we remember that these lamps were made more often of stone than of pottery on the Asiatic side of the North Pacific, and there is no reason why the lamp of stone (without pottery) should not have come from Asia to southwest ern Alaska. Furthermore, the prehistoric sites in Kamchatka with pottery all date from the eleventh century a.d. and later, and if the Kamchadal, as we have suggested, learned the art of pottery-making from Kurilian Ainu, and the latter in turn acquired this art only in the third or fourth centuries a.d., then pottery was probably not present in the Kurilian-Kamchat kan area at the time that the oval lamp ap peared in Eskimo culture, for we must date the Kachemak Bay I and Dorset cultures at least to the beginnings of the Christian era, if not earlier. And furthermore, we can hardly ascribe the oval lamps of India and Ceylon to a south western Alaskan origin. Thus, while I am con vinced that there were cultural exchanges back and forth across the Aleutian Islands 1000 years ago, I believe that these could have af fected only the ornamentation of lamps or the i?'3 Jochelson, 1905-1908, PL 37. 1(&gt;14 Collins, 1937 a, p. 348.</page><page sequence="262">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 255 stands used with them, not the primary shape of the lamp itself. I have mentioned that plate-like or scoop shaped lamps were also known from the Dorset culture. These are shallow, roundish or oval vessels, generally larger than the oval lamps proper, with one of the edges flattened out, either along one of the longer sides or across the narrower end, to allow for a long wick. These lamps are known from Cape Dorset, from Home Bay in southeastern Baffinland, from Coats Island or Mansel Island, from Mc Leland Strait near Labrador, and from New foundland.1015 These lamps seem to be a special ized form derived from the smaller oval lamp and adapted for a long wick. Among the Eskimo, therefore, the pointed oval lamp developed in a direction opposite to that which occurred in the Old World, where the wick lip narrowed into a closed spout. The presence of suspended stone pots in the Dorset culture gives us the clue. These pots are rectangular or square, with flat bottoms and flat, flaring sides, and are thus hard to distinguish from modern Central Es kimo pots. Those from the Canadian Arctic are pierced for suspension above the lamps,1016 while those from Newfoundland usually lack means of suspension, although a few have holes or lugs on the outside.1017 Presumably in New foundland, which is heavily timbered, there was no need to hang the pot above a slow blub ber lamp, and these pots were all placed on open fires. We might note that the modern Caribou Eskimo soapstone pot, which is flat bottomed and rectangular in shape, has an un pierced lug at each end, not for suspension but to facilitate lifting it from a heather fire.1018 Should we credit the Dorset or the Thule cul ture with the invention of the long-wicked lamp and the stone pot hung above it? I should be inclined to favor the Dorset since it was the first to flourish in the untimbered Canadian Arctic, while the Thule Eskimo came from a 101*NMC IX-C-415, 920 (Cape Dorset), IX-C-1121 (Home Bay; de Laguna, 1940, Fig. 5, 2), IX-C-432 (Coats or Mansel Island), IX-A-581 (McLeland Strait), Wintem berg, 1939-1940, PL XVI-1, 20, p. 319, "the bottom plates of compound pots" (Newfoundland). 1016 Cf.

The Thule lamps and pots would, therefore, have been loans from the Dorset culture. We must remember that even at the earliest and westernmost of the Thule sites, that of Malerualik in King William Land, unmistakable Dorset trade pieces are found.1019 The crude oval stone lamps found at Thule sites1020 are enlarged copies of the small Dorset lamp, and the semicircular shape of the typical Thule lamp was derived from the expanded oval of the larger Dorset cooking lamp. We should notice a difference between Thule and Dorset cooking pots. The former are often rounded or oval in outline, with slightly rounded bottoms, and Mathiassen ascribes the shape to a round pottery prototype.1021 It may well be that they represent a compromise between the old Alas kan cooking pot and the straight-sided, flat bottomed Dorset pot. In any case, it was the latter which eventually became dominant in the modern Central Eskimo culture. A con siderable number of the Thule pots lacked means of suspension and must have been used on open fires. In summer these would have been heather fires kindled outdoors, in winter they may have been fires of bone and blubber in doors, for Mathiassen mentions small fireplaces in the kitchen-annex or in the main room of the Thule house.1022 Whence came the Dorset stone pot? I have already pointed out similarities with the soap stone pots of the New England Woodland In dians, and with those of the Orient focus on Long Island, and have suggested that the In dian vessels may have been derived from the Eskimo, since soapstone pots are lacking in the Archaic horizon.1023 However, not only are soap stone pots found far south of what we might legitimately claim as the sphere of Eskimo in fluence, but the northern Laurentian sites where that influence was strongest have yielded only a very few sherds of soapstone. It is true that the Orient focus has a wealth of stone vessels: square, rectangular, oval, and round, with and without lugs, and with notched rims,1024 but we lack any comparable finds from the area between Newfoundland and Long Island. 1019 Mathiassen, 1927,1, PL 82, 3. 1020 Op. tit., II, p. 99. 1021 Op. tit., II, pp. 103 ff. 1022 Op. tit., II, p. 132. 1023 de Laguna, 1940, p. 62.

Ritchie.</page><page sequence="263">256 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 Whether there is any connection at all between Dorset and Northeastern Indian stone pots is, therefore, uncertain. It is possible that they are independent and parallel developments, al though this, too, is not a completely satisfactory theory since it takes no account of the striking parallels in shape between the Newfoundland and Orient vessels. We might then argue that the Dorset pot was evolved from something similar and perhaps even related to the Aleut "frying pan." This is described by Birket Smith: The primitive cooking pots of the Aleut were most peculiar, something between a pot and a pan, consisting of a hol lowed-out slab of stone, or a bottom and lid of stone and sides of clay.1025 Let us leave the Dorset stone pot and return to the Thule lamp. This is a rounded half moon shaped soapstone vessel with a row of knobs or a ridge across the front. The wick was held in place between the front edge and these projections. Mathiassen has tried to explain the rounded back as an inheritance from a round prototype, but I believe that it was derived from an oval prototype, specifically the ex panded oval Dorset lamp. If we accept this latter hypothesis we shall have to explain the origin of the knobs or ridge, and we must also account for the presence in Alaska and Siberia of Thule-like lamps. The following discussion will attempt to deal with both of these. The Thule-like lamps found in the west are of two types: those which merely have the semi circular shape and are without knobs, and those which have knobs or a ridge. Let us consider the former first. Plain lamps of Thule outline, but without knobs, are found in Arctic Alaska, Kotzebue Sound, Cape Darby, Norton Bay, and St. Michael.1026 These seven or eight known specimens are all of stone, with the exception of the last, which is of pottery. We do not have any reason to suppose that any of these are old; indeed two of the lamps from Kotzebue Sound and one from Norton Bay are of soap stone, and we know that this material must have been imported from the Coronation Gulf area. However, while most of the trade in soap stone lamps was in protohistoric and modern 1026 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, p. 104. 1026 Arctic Alaska (WSM 886), Kotzebue Sound (Hough, 1898, PL 12, i), Cape Darby (Op. tit., PL 12, 2; E.

Nelson, 1899, PL XXVIII, 12), St. Michael (Op. tit., PL XXVIII, 11). times, the majority of the lamps so obtained were of modern Central Eskimo type, that is, they are much longer and narrower than the Thule lamps, and, as we shall remark again, they also have a partition or step at the back.1027 These lamps were imported because the de scendants of the Thule Eskimo who returned to northern Alaska in recent times preferred them to the round pottery lamps made in Alaska, presumably because not only were the latter more fragile, but they were poorly adapted for cooking because they had no place for a long wick and had never been in tended for such a use. The only dated example from Alaska of a stone lamp with the rounded Thule shape (but lacking knobs) is a fragment from Kachemak Bay II or sub-Ill, made of local stone.1028 While the lamps previously cited may be recent importations, or copies of these, the Kachemak Bay lamp is too early to be explained by influence from the protohistoric Thule return. It may be fortuitous, or it and some of the northern examples may indicate that prior to the return to Alaska there was some contact with Thule peoples in the east, contact responsible for introducing a modifica tion of the Thule lamp, minus its knobs or ridge. We must, of course, find dated specimens of this same type in northern Alaska before we can settle this problem. If we turn to Siberia we will find, surprisingly enough, some sandstone lamps which are not only Thule-like in outline, but equipped with knobs or a divided ridge across the front. Hough has published what may be a prehistoric speci men and reports that Nordenskiold saw them in use. There are two specimens of this type in the Washington State Museum, but of un certain age.1029 The typical modern lamp of the Maritime Chukchee and Siberian Eskimo is, however, not only larger, but has a rounded rectangular outline. It is almost always of pot tery, less commonly of stone. The lamp used for light has one ridge, that for cooking two.1030 The same types of pottery lamps, with one or 1027 Compare the modern Copper Eskimo lamp (Jen ness, 1922, Fig. 8), modern Mackenzie Eskimo lamp (Hough, 1898, PL 10), modern imported lamp obtained at Point Barrow (Op. tit., PL 11), modern copy in wood with tin to protect the wick edge, from Puoten Bay, Siberia (WSM 10088). 1028 de Laguna, 1934, PL 29, 7. 1029 Hough, 1898, PL 17, p. 1052; E.

I have already mentioned (the previous section, on pottery) that one of the pottery lamps from Puoten Bay is of modified Old Bering Sea-Birnirk-Punuk type. It is oval, not round, and lacks ridges. I believe that it is a type transitional between the old round pottery lamp and the modern rounded-rec tangular lamp with one or two ridges. If its typological position can serve to suggest its age, we ought to place it as very late Punuk or very early protohistoric. But what is the re lationship between these modern Chukchee and Eskimo ridged lamps of pottery and the Siberian Thule-like sandstone lamps? Collins believes that the ridges on these mod ern pottery lamps were copied from those of the Siberian lamps, and suggests that the lat ter were in some way related to the Canadian Thule lamp or to the prototype of the Thule lamp. He inclines to the belief that the Siberian lamps with one ridge are copies of the Thule lamps, "in view of the fact that the wick ledges in general seem to be a late feature, but the alternative [that the Siberian lamp is a copy of the Thule prototype] should not be ruled out until archaeological data are available for northern Siberia."1031 The stone Thule-like lamps may, therefore, be due to cultural in fluences from Canada dating from a slightly earlier period than that which brought the modern Central Eskimo soapstone lamps. (However, the Siberian lamps might be the prototype of the Thule lamp. In this case, the expanded oval cooking lamp of the Dorset cul ture would have to be explained as copies of the Thule lamp. I prefer the former theory.) The lamp of the Reindeer Chukchee, how ever, seems to be much more primitive than any of the Maritime Chukchee types except the archaeological Birnirk lamps. It was used only for light, was of pottery or soapstone, round in outline, and had a single knob or a short divided ridge in the center of the bowl.1032 Let us con sider other lamps with knobs. In addition to the Siberian examples already cited and the Ca nadian Thule lamps, knobs are sometimes found at the rear of oval stone lamps in southwestern Alaska. It is these knobs which have become elaborated into human figures or whales.1033 One 1031 Collins, 1937 a, p. 346. 1032 Bogoras, 1904-1909,1, pp. 184 f., Fig. 102 b. 1033 de Laguna, 1934, PL 24, 2 (Kachemak Bay III with round saucer-shaped pottery lamp from the Bristol Bay-Norton Sound area even has a small ornamental knob in the center of the bowl.1034 The original function of the ridges and knobs in Thule lamps was apparently to support the wick.1035 On modern Central Es kimo lamps the step or partition across the back, derived from the Thule knobs or ridge, serves only to hold unmelted blubber or "to regulate the flow of oil to the wick and to pre vent any sudden wash of oil carrying away the wick line."1036 On a few of the modern imported lamps at Point Barrow, the partition was used as an extra wick edge, and this is true also of a modern St. Lawrence Island lamp with a single ridge.1037 In the Greenland lamps with a ridge or row of knobs set well back from the the wick edge, in the modern St. Lawrence Island and Siberian lamps with one or two ridges, and in the southwestern Alaskan oval lamps with one or two knobs at the rear, the wicks were laid against the rim and the knobs and ridges served only to hold back the blub ber. In none of these did the knobs serve their primary function of supporting the wick. If we are to explain the knobs in Eskimo lamps, we must, I believe, turn to the pricket lamp of Asia. This is a round saucer-shaped lamp with a spike in the middle on which the wick was impaled. It is known from tombs at Loyang, China, dating from 400 B.C. or perhaps earlier, and also from Japan.1038 The pricket candle sticks of China, Japan, and Europe are also related forms.1039 Just when these wick-knobs were added to Siberian and Eskimo lamps it is difficult to say, but were they not a feature of the lamps carried by the original Thule Eskimo from Alaska to Canada? Were they not there transferred to the expanded oval cooking lamp taken over from the Dorset culture? Is the round lamp of the Reindeer Chukchee with a knob or divided ridge in the middle the sur vivor of the original Alaskan Thule prototype? two knobs), pp. 177, 179; Jochelson, 1925, PL 18, 2, 7 (Aleut with a single knob). 1034 WSM, Gudmundson Collection, exact provenience unknown; de Laguna, 1940, Fig. 5, 4. 1036 Mathiassen, 1927, II, p. 100. 1036 Hough, 1898, p. 1034. 1037 Op. tit., p. 1051, PL 15, 4; Mathiassen, 1927, II, p. 100. 1038 Information from James Mellon Menzies; Hough, 1929, PL 48, 1. 1039 China (Op. tit., PL 12, 4), Japan (PL 13, 1, 2), Europe (PL 12, 1, 2; PL 13, 3).</page><page sequence="265">258 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 I suggest the following history of Eskimo lamps. The round, conical-bottomed pottery lamps of the Old Bering Sea, Birnirk and Punuk cultures were derived from the Arctic Ice-hunt ing horizon. The oval stone lamps of southwest ern Alaska and the Dorset culture were derived from the North Pacific cultural continuum. To the round pottery lamps of the north, central knobs were adopted from the Asiatic pricket lamps, and these were carried east towards Canada by the Thule emigrants from Alaska. This proto-Thule lamp was, however, aban doned before the time of the earliest known Canadian Thule sites, and the Canadian Thule Eskimo took over a modified form of the Dorset scoop-shaped lamp, to which they added a row of knobs or a ridge. The scoop-shaped lamp had been developed by the Dorset people from the small oval lamp in response to the need for a cooking lamp, and its development was ac companied by that of the suspended stone pot, an item also taken into the Thule culture. Thule-like stone lamps, with or without ridges, appeared in Alaska and Siberia as a result of cultural contacts with Canada, shortly before the protohistoric return of the Thule Eskimo. When the latter movement occurred, the mod ern Central Eskimo soapstone lamp had al ready been developed and it was introduced into northern Alaska. It was also accompanied by the suspended stone pot. In Siberia and on the Bering Sea islands the shape of this pot was copied in pottery. The appearance of the Cen tral Eskimo lamp for cooking stimulated the old round pottery lamp of Alaska and Siberia to adopt a rounded-rectangular shape and to take over one or two ridges from the earlier Thule-like lamps. At a period corresponding to the Punuk, the knobs traveled south and ap peared sporadically on southern Eskimo lamps. The only lamps preserving into modern times the characteristics in shape and function (light alone) of early Eskimo lamps are the round clay saucer-shaped lamps of the Bristol Bay Norton Sound area, the naturally hollow stone lamps of the Caribou Eskimo, and the oval stone lamps of the Aleut and Pacific Eskimo and their neighbors. Some of the southern lamps gained new decorative elements from the pottery style which came to them from the Kamchadal or Kurilian Ainu. Thus the stone lamps with human figure have knobs on the rim and festoons in low relief around the sides; the Norton Sound-Bristol Bay lamps added plain knobs on the rim and an incised decoration in the bottom. The spoked wheel pattern was taken over from cooking pots and was probably the more popular as a lamp deco ration because the "spokes" resembled the medial groove for oil in the bottoms of the more southern oval stone lamps, with which the Yukon Eskimo were probably familiar. ART The only examples of representative incised designs were the pictures of a man and birds on the scapula scrapers found at the Old Fish Camp (Fig. 24 and PL XV, 25, 26). While rep resentative art is characteristic of the Canadian Thule culture and of the parent Alaskan Thule stage,1040 the incised pictures are almost invari ably silhouettes, filled in with hatching, and are not simple outlines like the prehistoric Tena figures. Perhaps the lines drawn across the body of the man (Fig. 24, 1) are in imita tion of the Eskimo style. Curiously enough, there is one Dorset engraving of a seal, exe cuted in crude outline.1041 Since it is the only example of realistic incising from the Dorset culture, and since the other incised designs from Iglulik where it was found are in a hither to unknown style, we are unable to assess the significance of this one specimen. The fact that the Dorset and Tena drawings are all crude produces an apparent similarity in style be tween them which we must be careful not to over stress. The closest resemblances to the Old Fish Camp engravings can perhaps be found among the Peel River Kutchin. While Osgood does not mention scapula scrapers from these In dians, he states that they practiced scapuli mancy with caribou or moose shoulder blades on which they drew a trail map or "little pic tures of caribou." No examples are illustrated, unfortunately, but the outline pictures which the Peel River hunters drew in the snow as a guide to the game they had killed are remark ably similar in style to the Old Fish Camp en gravings.1042 We should not dismiss the pos sibility that the Tena scrapers have had some connection with scapulimancy, although the complete specimen (PL XV, 26) shows no evi dence of having been subjected to heat, and the second (PL XV, 25) is too fragmentary to tell us anything. Since scapulimancy is a trait 1040 Mathiassen, 1927, II, p. 121; Collins, 1937 a, p. 266, note 18. 1041 Rowley, 1940, Fig. 3 d, pp. 495 f. 1042 Osgood, 1936, pp. 26, 92.</page><page sequence="266">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 259 typical of the Snowshoe complex1043 we might have expected to find evidence of it among the Tena. Comparisons might be made between the outline engravings and the paintings on mod ern Tena coffins and on some of the objects illustrated by Osgood from the Ingalik. The paintings, however, are in silhouette. The style of the engravings is somewhat similar to the rock paintings in red outline made by the Coast and Interior Salish, but there is little similarity between the latter and the Tena paintings on wood. Perhaps the bone knife said to have been found in one of the graves at the Arvilla gravel pit, Red River Valley, North Dakota, was most similar to the Tena scrapers with their deco rations. Jenks writes of this specimen: The missing knife is also said to have had a design on one side, depicting the head of some large mammal, and, on the other side, of a flying bird. These pictures were drawn by incised lines.1044 Although no close resemblances to the Old Fish Camp engravings have been cited, it is probable that there is some connection between these and Eskimo representative art. As yet, we do not know the origin of the Thule realistic designs. Representative engravings are lacking in Birnirk and Punuk art and appear in Old Bering Sea (and in the closely related style of Ipiutak) only as highly conventionalized fig ures suggested or hinted at by the patterns of the elaborate and sophisticated non-representa tive design elements. In discussing modern Alaskan art, Collins finds that the art of the Eskimo north of Norton Sound is distinguished from that of the Eskimo to the south by the presence, among other features, of representa tive figures.1045 In this respect, Tena art may show a possible relationship with northern Alaskan Eskimo style. The sandstone boulder with a few lightly pecked lines suggesting the eyes and mouth of a human face (Fig. 23) is so crude that we hesi tate to mention it as an example of representa tive carving. It is even cruder than the only example with which it can be compared: the !043 Hallowell, 1926, p. 158; Cooper (1936, p. 31) however, reports that it is lacking among the Athabaskans of the Pacific drainage area; Osgood (1940, p. 451) reports it absent from the Ingalik. 1044 Jenks, 1932, p. 456. "? Collins, 1937 a, p. 288. stone from Kachemak Bay I, slightly carved to suggest a human head.1046 Both of these might perhaps be taken as peripheral manifestations emanating from the Northwest Coast. The bone carving of a mouse (PL XIV, 40) is not only so crude but so badly preserved that it is impossi ble to compare it with any particular art style. Small carvings of animals have, however, been found in practically every Eskimo culture, ancient and modern, although the style has differed from culture to culture. The wooden masks and the wooden carvings at modern Tena graves are obviously related to contem porary carvings made by the neighboring Es kimo.1047 The hook-shaped owner's mark on the "Es kimo" arrowheads from Fox Creek (PL XXVI, 4, 9) were compared with similar marks on arrowheads from northern Alaska and from the Canadian Thule culture (see above, "owner's mark," under "Bone Arrowheads"). It was suggested that these marks may have de veloped from simple and unstandardized de signs on Old Bering Sea heads, and that they are now found in northern Alaska because of the strong Thule influence there. Farther south in Alaska these marks have developed into elaborate representational carvings, functioning as inherited amulets. Again, it would seem as if the closest parallels to the Fox Creek marks were to be found among the northern Alaskan Eskimo. A number of decorative elements or motifs were used by the Tena. The round bored dots on a Tena belt buckle (PL XIV, 33) dit once suggest Eskimo art, where dot designs are com mon. They are especially prominent in the art of the modern Central Eskimo, where other design elements are but meagerly repre sented.1048 The arrangement of dots on the Tena specimen reminds one of an ivory speci men from the Thule culture which Mathiassen compares with the hair ornaments worn by the Southampton Island women.1049 Similar dot de signs are also found among the Interior Salish, Aleut, and the prehistoric Indians of the south 1046 de Laguna, 1934, PL 52, 8. 1047 de Laguna, 1936 c; and Chapter IV of this book. 1048 de Laguna, 1932-1933, II, p. 77. 1049 Mathiassen, 1927,1, PL 30, 23, p. 73; cf.

One has the impression that they are older in Eskimo art than are round bored dots. The latter became important only in the period when Early Punuk art was developing (before the introduc tion of the compass-drawn dot-and-circle into Punuk art). Here, however, dots always ap peared as minor elements within a well-in tegrated design.1056 Longitudinal lines bordering rows of barbs were discussed in connection with the develop ment of the slender barbed point (see "Bone Arrowheads"), and it was suggested that they had been derived from the deep undercutting of barbs on Old Bering Sea arrowheads. Short transverse lines in groups (Pis. XIV, 46; XV, 24; XVIII, 1) belong to Kachemak Bay II and III, to Prince William Sound, and to Salish art, but are not very common in 1050 Salish (H. I. Smith, 1900, Fig. 377), Aleut (Jochelson, 1925, Fig. 70), California (Gifford, 1940, figs, on pp. 214 ff. and 219 ff., cf. pp. 233 f.). 1051 Baba, 1934, frontispiece, 5. 1062 de Laguna, 1932-1933, II, p. 78. 1053 Collins, 1937 a, p. 288. mm de Laguna, 1934, p. 210; Birket-Smith and de Laguna, field notes, 1933.

Note a similar use of dots by the Ingalik (Osgood, 1940, frontispiece). Eskimo art as a whole.1057 In Punuk art they appear as bands of evenly spaced, deeply in cised lines, not free, but always attached to a formal design.1058 Short lines, often in groups, are however, characteristic of Dorset art. They may be horizontal, that is, at right angles to the long axis of the specimen, or oblique, and sometimes occur in meaningless arrangements of horizontal, oblique, and vertical.1059 We also find transverse lines in groups in Old Bering Sea Style l.1060 This type of decoration must, therefore, be regarded as an ancient Eskimo feature which has died out everywhere but in southwestern Alaska and on the Yukon. "The simple spurred line is another very im portant element of modern Eskimo art that goes back to the Old Bering Sea period."1061 It belongs also to Thule, Dorset and Salish art.1062 Lines with vertical spurs on one side (PL XIV, 22, Fig. 24, 5) are especially common in Thule and modern northern Alaskan art, whereas lines with long slanting spurs were more common in Old Bering Sea Style 1 and Dorset.1063 Lines with short vertical spurs are, however, known in Old Bering Sea Style 1, Ipiutak, and Dorset, as well as from Kachemak Bay and Prince William Sound,1064 Apparently the size and direction of the spurs was more variable in former times than at present. Lines with oblique spurs on one side (Pis. XIV, 30, XVI, 13, Fig. 24, 1, 2, 3), occur not only in Old Bering Sea Style 1 and Dorset art, but also in Prince William Sound. Curved lines with spurs on one side (PL XXII, 8) belong to Old Bering Sea Styles 1 and 2, Ipiutak, Punuk, Dorset, Kachemak Bay III, and Prince William 1067 de Laguna, 1934, p. 209. Quimby (1945 a, p. 76) finds that transverse lines in groups of three are a characteristic of early Aleut art which has lasted on into a relatively late period. 1068 Collins, 1937 a, p. 287; de Laguna, 1932-1933, II, p. 87. 1069 Jenness, 1925, Fig. 8 e, f; Mathiassen, 1927, I, PL 62, 8-11, 15; Rowley, 1940, Fig. 3 b, e. 1060 Collins, 1937 a, Fig. 6,1, cf. 2 and 3; Rainey, 1941 a, Fig. 4, 4; Fig. 5, 6; Fig. 6, 8. 1081 Collins, 1937 a, p. 287. 1062 de Laguna, 1934, p. 209. 1083 de Laguna, 1932-1933, II, p. 85; Collins, 1937 a, p. 289.

The line with alternating vertical spurs on both sides (PL XXII, 8, Fig. 24, 6) is at home in Punuk, Thule, Birnirk, and modern Alaskan art, especially north of Norton Sound. In the Punuk and Thule such lines are generally com bined to produce bands of lines with alternating internal spurs, as on the Tena specimen.1066 This element was prominent in a grave find from Prince William Sound, where the design had a tendency to merge with the line crossed by ver tical spurs.1067 It is not found in the Old Bering Sea culture, though a design of Style 1 and another from Ipiutak, composed of double lines with alternating spurs on the outer sides, are rather similar.1068 On the whole, this element is not very important in Eskimo art. The line with alternating oblique spurs on both sides (PL XIV, 22, Fig. 24, 5, 6) is not very common in Eskimo art, although the related motif of the line with alternating groups of oblique spurs is found in modern Eskimo art of the Norton Sound and Bristol Bay area.1069 A much more common element is the line with paired oblique spurs on both sides (not repre sented in our collections but illustrated by Os good), which is found in Dorset, Thule (?), Birnirk and modern art in the Norton Sound Bristol Bay region, but is not to my knowledge known from the Old Bering Sea.1070 The related double line with paired spurs is found in Old Bering Sea Style l.1071 Grouping of spurs (Fig. 24, 1, 3), whether 1065 Old Bering Sea (Collins, 1937 a, Fig. 6, 7, 8; Fig. 15, 13: Rainey, 1941 a, Fig. 26,3; Fig. 35, 6), Ipiutak (Rainey, 1941 b, Pis.

Although examples are known from northern Alaska, Collins finds this feature especially characteristic of Punuk art and of modern incising in Norton Sound and Bristol Bay. It is also found in Prince William Sound. It appeared as far back as Old Bering Sea Style 1 and the Ipiutak.1072 The double line with alternating internal spurs (PL XIV, 23, 41, Fig. 24, 4, 6) was occa sionally found in Old Bering Sea and Ipiutak art, but was much more common in the Punuk. In old Alaskan art it was never as stereotyped as in modern Alaskan and Thule usage. This design reached the peak of its popularity in the Canadian Thule culture and in modern (especially northern) Alaskan art, and also enjoys a wide distribution in Eurasia. It is found in British Columbia, but not on the Aleutian Islands, in Kachemak Bay, or in Prince William Sound.1073 It does, however, occur among the Tanaina,1074 so perhaps it was only by chance that we did not find it in south western Alaska. It may have occurred in Dorset art, if the decorated needlecase from Button Point can be considered Dorset.1075 Dorset in fluence, at any rate, is shown by the large X that crosses the design at one end of the tube. Although the bulk of the material from this site is Dorset, it did yield some Thule specimens, so we cannot be sure about the origin of the needlecase. The ladder pattern with oblique cross bars (PL XVII, 8) was "much more frequently em ployed in Punuk and modern [Alaskan] art than in Old Bering Sea art."1076 It is not present in the Dorset, and I could find only one exam ple (with vertical bars) from the Thule culture, although it is found on the Belcher Islands in Hudson Bay.1077 It occurs in Prince William Sound, among the Aleut, and among the pre historic Salish, and so ought to have been found in Kachemak Bay.1078 The ladder with vertical and with oblique bars is also found on the 1072 de Laguna, 1932-1933, II, p. 88; Collins, 1937 a, p. 288, Fig. 8; Rainey, 1941 b, PL III, 1. 1073 de Laguna, 1932-1933, II, pp. 95 f.; 1934, p. 210; Collins, 1937 a, pp. 287 f.; Rainey, 1941 b, PL III, 2. 1074 Osgood, 1937, Fig. 32 c.

The Y-figure (PL XXII, 8) is rare in Punuk art, common in Thule art and in modern Alaskan art north of the Peninsula, and is also present in Prince William Sound and Kache mak Bay. I speak here of the simple Y that occurs alone or that stands growing from a line, and distinguish this from the larger Y-shaped figure of Punuk art which is almost invariably connected at the ends of the prongs and at the base with other parts of the design.1080 The ellip tical ivory pendants from the Belcher Islands commonly have a row of Y's along a bordering line.1081 Mathiassen thinks that the Y is de scended from the common Alaskan tree figure, or Y with central prong (PL XVII, 8). Collins, on the other hand, believes that the tree figure was developed from the y.1082 The tree figure is now common in northern Alaska and is also found in Prince William Sound, but has not been found in any of the archaeological cul tures in northern Alaska, except for two speci mens from Okvik. One of these is an ivory doll or figurine with an atypical tree figure with very long stem incised on the body. The other is a harpoon support for a kayak on which typical tree figures have been engraved.1083 The har poon support has been, up to the present, known only from protohistoric and modern northern Alaskan culture. In view of the mixed character of the collection from Okvik it is very doubtful that the presence of this speci men proves that the harpoon support and the typical tree figure were known to the Old Bering Sea culture, especially since the design as a whole on the specimen is not particularly char acteristic of any period and so gives us no clue as to the date. While the relationship of the tree figure to the Y thus remains uncertain, the archaeological evidence by and large confirms Collins' theory that the Y was the earlier. A few Dorset carvings suggest an approach to the tree figure, but their resemblance to the Alaskan motif is probably fortuitous.1084 1079 Gifford, 1940, Type B 4 on p. 205. 1080 de Laguna, 1932-1933, II, pp. 91 f.; 1934, PL 26, 3; cf.

I suspect that the cross hatched bands in Prince William Sound are due to Northwest Coast influence, and that most (all?) of the modern northern Alaskan exam ples are of Russo-Siberian introduction, since they appear almost exclusively on snuff tubes.

It is surprising that one element of Punuk origin which is highly developed among the modern Alaskan Eskimo, especially in the Norton Sound-Bristol Bay region, is not found in Tena art at all ex cept in the designs figured by Osgood from the Ingalik. This element is the compass-drawn dot-and-circle. We may conclude that on the whole, Tena art is old-fashioned in some re spects, and in others shows affiliations with modern northern Alaskan Eskimo style. Here we cannot do better than to quote from Collins' illuminating discussion of Eskimo art: It appears, therefore, that modern Eskimo art is to be ex plained as the result of simplification or degeneration; that from the rich reservoir of the prehistoric art it has selected Distribution of Tena Art Elements Old South- Modern Element Bering Ipiutak Punuk Thule Dorset west Northern Sea Alaska Alaska iw realistic engravings 1.

In the latter region we find an art style based on i*87 Collins, 1937 a, pp. 287 f. Punuk elements: nucleated concentric circles, often with spurs attached to the periphery; straight, deeply incised lines, either single or in bands; pairs of spurs attached to lines; detached dots; and Y figures. The close resemblances between Punuk art in its later phases and the modern geometric art of southwestern Alaska (Bristol Bay to the Yukon) indicate that we are dealing with two aspects of the same general art style. The differences between the two are mainly in the organization of the design. In the modern art the design elements are usually detached, or if con nected, are repetitive. In early Punuk art, as in Old Bering Sea, there is usually a continuity of design and very often a studied arrangement of the elements in relation to surface contours. The modern art of southwestern Alaska [Bristol Bay to the Yukon] may, therefore, be regarded as a dis integrated form of Punuk art. From Norton Sound northward we find a simpler style of geometric art, based largely upon the use of the spurred line, usually in the form of the alternate spur design. The Y figure and the simple nucleated circle are also present, but there is no evidence of the bands of parallel lines or the more elaborate concentric circles that are typical of the region to the southward. At Norton Sound, which is the dividing line, there is a blending of the two styles, the northern style predominating. Correlated with these dif ferences in geometric art is the wide-spread occurrence in the northern region of the well-known pictographic art. This distinction between northern and southern art is consistent with a general dichotomy of modern Alaskan Eskimo culture, which is manifested in a number of im portant culture traits, and which extends even to lin guistics and physical characteristics. As the writer has pre viously suggested, this is a condition which might be ex</page><page sequence="271">264 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 plained on the assumption that there had been a return migration of Thule peoples to northern Alaska within the past few centuries, subsequent to the original eastward spread of the Thule culture.1088 This northern Alaskan style and the Cana dian Thule culture art style (which "differs in no way from the northern style of modern Alaskan art") might well have developed, Col lins suggests, from Old Bering Sea Style 1, "with its profusion of straight lines and spurs."1089 On the whole I concur with this opinion, though I question whether Collins has not perhaps drawn too sharp a distinction between northern and southern Alaskan art, and bracketed the former too closely with Thule art, since there are some elements: the grouping of spurs, the tree figure, the ladder, and the line with paired spurs on both sides, that are typi cally Alaskan and are also non-Thule. Collins further points out important re semblances between Dorset art and Old Bering Sea Style 1 in the use of straight lines, long oblique spurs, short detached lines, and the carving of mammal heads with ears in relief.1090 To this we can also add lines with short verti cal spurs, crosses, X's, and angular dots in a line. He has also noted the presence in south western Alaska, south of the Alaska Peninsula, of a number of elements belonging to Old Bering Sea Style I.1091 However, the unpublished mate rial from Prince William Sound, which is much fuller than that from Kachemak Bay, suggests that a closer comparison might be made be tween it and Dorset art. Unfortunately we found little in Kachemak Bay I that was deco rated, but I should imagine that the art of that period included those simple elements of Old Bering Sea Style 1 and Dorset that are found in Prince William Sound and Kachemak Bay III. Other elements in the art of this area are of Punuk derivation: dot-and-circle, some times with several concentric circles and often with spurs, stiff metal-cut lines, and round bored dots on a line.1092 The bone ornaments for Aleut hunting hats and helmets, with "panels of curving, petaloid shape," suggest the more advanced Old Bering Sea forms of Styles 2 and 3 1093 1088 Op. cit., pp. 288 f.; cf. de Laguna, 1932-1933, II, p. 87. 1089 Collins, 1937 a, p. 289. 1090 Ibid. 1091 Op. tit., p. 290. i092 de Laguna, 1934, pp. 210 f. See the discussion of this position in Quimby 1945 a. ww Collins, 1937 a, p. 290. Both Collins and I have been impressed with the Eskimo-like character of ancient and mod ern incised art of the southern Northwest Coast Salish. I quote again from Collins: On the basis of the present evidence, therefore, we would be justified in accepting the view expressed by Boas that the geometric ornamentation of the southern British Co lumbia tribes represents a survival of an older art style and that to the northward "we are dealing with the gradual intrusion of ever fuller animal motives into a well-estab lished conventionalized art."1094 Undoubtedly the closest comparison could be made between Salish designs and those of the ancient Pacific Eskimo. The designs of the latter represent, like the Old Bering Sea Style 1 and the Dorset, local forms of an ancient sub stratum underlying Eskimo art, a substratum which we must extend into the Salish area. As in southwestern Alaska, so in southern British Columbia, Punuk influence is found in the ap pearance of the compass-drawn dot-and-cir cle.1095 But all the influence in styles has not gone from the Eskimo to the Salish. Borrowing in the opposite direction has introduced the V or chevron into Kachemak Bay III art,1096 and bands of crosshatching and of "braided" elements (double lines enclosing triangular areas with hatching in alternate directions) into the art of Prince William Sound.1097 Collins has also explored the distribution of spurred lines and of the double line with alter nating internal spurs in northern Eurasian art, in Kamchatka, in the Amur region, and on the Kurile Islands, that is, in parts of eastern Asia "where northern influences have been the strongest."1098 In these areas the Eskimo-like elements are widely distributed and play an important part except where they have been pushed into minor roles by the development of newer and more elaborate designs. In no place, however, do they enter into as elaborate and fluid a style as that characteristic of Old Bering Sea art. I have also compared Eskimo art with that of the Upper Paleolithic of western Europe and with the Maglemosian, but was unable to discover whether or not we should be justified in trying to trace an historical connection be tween them. A number of motifs are common 1094 Op. cit., p. 292, quoting from Boas. 1095 de Laguna, 1932-1933, II, pp. 80 ff.; 1934, p. 218. 1096 de Laguna, 1934, p. 210, discussed in connection with the carved stone lamps with human figure in the bowl. 1097 de Laguna, 1932-1933, II, p. 99; Birket-Smith and de Laguna, field notes, 1933. 1098 Collins, 1937 a, pp. 293 ff., 296; cf. de Laguna, 1932 1933, II, passim.</page><page sequence="272">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 265 to Eskimo and Paleolithic art: the dot, spurred circle, short transverse lines, line with spur on one side, the line with paired oblique spurs (but not all of its abbreviations, such as the Y, tree figure or arrow figure, etc.), and the ladder pattern. To this list we can add elements common to Eskimo and Maglemosian art: line with alternating spurs on both sides, and the double line with alternating inter nal spurs. However, important differences in style distinguish the use of the elements in Paleolithic art from their use in Eskimo art, the former style being fluid and experi mental, the latter being conventionalized and rigid, even degenerate.1099 However, my con clusions were based chiefly on Thule and modern Alaskan art. In a number of cases, I found close similarities to Paleolithic art, not only in the choice of motifs but in their arrange ments, in the designs represented by Mathias sen's find at Button Point in northern Baffin land. At that time I believed that this was only a local school of Thule art,1100 but now that this material is known to be typical of the Dorset culture, the whole matter must be viewed in a new light. Collins again raises the question of a possible relationship between Paleolithic art and that represented by the Old Bering Sea Style 1 and Dorset. To this I would add the hypothetical style of Kachemak Bay I as suggested by southwestern Alaskan material. He points out that "the rather scratchy ornamentation" of Old Bering Sea Style 1 and Dorset "resembles in a general way the equally variable line and spur designs of the Paleolithic," and that in both Europe and in the Eskimo world "the older style is more generalized, more variable, whereas the later style has become fixed and formalized."1101 When we know more about the content and range of ancient Eskimo art in the three widely separated but related Eskimo cultures (Old Bering Sea 1, Dorset, and Kachemak Bay I), and when we have available a similar knowledge of Siberian Paleolithic art, this question could again be discussed with profit. Collins finds that Old Bering Sea Styles 2 and 3?the Old Bering Sea art with which we are most familiar and which we take as most typical of that culture?was of local Eskimo development, but that some of the motifs and inspirations may have been Asiatic. 1099 de Laguna, 1932-1933, II, esp. pp. 99 f., 103. 1100 Op. tit., II, p. 85. 1101 Collins, 1937 a, pp. 295 f. On the basis of the information at present available it would not seem unreasonable to anticipate that either in China or somewhere in the coastal area between Manchuria and Bering Strait?perhaps in the Amur Valley?there will yet be discovered an art which may have possessed more fea tures in common with both Old Bering Sea and Shang and which may provide us with the source from which the two styles may have derived at least some of their common elements.1102 Ipiutak art is perhaps slightly closer to Shang style than is the Old Bering Sea art itself. In his discussion of the possible relationship between Old Bering Sea Styles 2 and 3 and Northwest Coast art, Collins finds that al though certain superficial resemblances exist, "they have so few elements in common and are so different in spirit and apparently in motiva tion that it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that they represent separate growths." In Old Bering Sea art the elements of the design are primarily geometric, and "only secondarily are given the appearance of life forms," while in Northwest Coast art (and I would add in Shang art) the elements themselves are pri marily representational.1103 However the styles of all three share some of the same principles by which these elements are combined into a design. These involve the breaking up or disintegration of animal figures into conventionalized parts, with a recombina tion of these parts into a formal pattern. (The process is seen in reverse in Old Bering Sea art.) The same element is also frequently rein terpreted as parts of two different animals at the same time. Adams has pointed out these parallels between Northwest Coast and Chinese Bronze Age art, but denies any historical con nection between the two.1104 A much fuller dis cussion has been ma&lt;le by Creel, from which we quote:1105 One of the most distinctive characteristics of Shang decorative art is a peculiar method by which animals were represented on flat or rounded surfaces. It is as if one took the animal and split it lengthwise, starting at the tip of the tail and carrying the operation almost, but not quite, to the tip of the nose. Then the two halves are pulled apart and the bisected animal is laid out flat on the sur face, the two halves joined only at the tip of the nose. The head still appears to be one head, for there is only one nose, and the two eyes appear to be looking more or less straight forward. There are two jaws, one on each side, but if one looks at the whole head together they seem merely to be the two sides of the mouth. But there are two necks, one on either side, and two bodies. If one covers either half of the strange double beast thus formed, he 1102 Op. tit., p. 300. 1103 Op. tit., p. 292. 1104 Adams, 1936. 1106 Creel, 1937 b, pp. 248 f.</page><page sequence="273">266 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 will find that either half, beginning from the middle of the shared nose, appears to be a complete beast as seen from the side. The Shang craftsmen went much further. In what is possibly their favorite design we find that the whole head appears to be that of an animal, possibly bovine, with two bodies, one stretching away on either side. If we cover one-half of this creature the remaining half is a dragon, with tail held high. But if we look closely at the tail we see that it has a crest, and that its point is the beak of a bird of which even the eye may be present; from this aspect what was first the foot of the bovine animal and later of the dragon now appears to be the foot of the bird. Sometimes the artist went even further and made of each horn a little dragon in its own right. . . . In studying Shang design I have constantly been aware of the feeling that this art had great resemblances, cer tainly in spirit and possibly in detail, to that of . . . the Northwest Coast Indians. . . . Certainly there is great similarity of feeling. He mentions the splitting and spreading out of the whole animal, "in a manner quite like that of the Shangs," and also the same treatment of the head alone. Such use of the split head only was also common with the Shang designers. . . . The Northwest Coast Indians also make a great deal of use of extra heads, beaks, and eyes, added on the plain surfaces of larger animals, in a way reminiscent of, though not identical with, the Shang practice. The many isolated eyes used by the Northwest Coast designers recall most forcibly their similar use in Shang art, and cause one to wonder if there was some magical reason for this which was possessed by both peoples. It must be said, however, that in none of the cases available to me in Peiping is the eye of the Northwest Coast art a Mongoloid, "slanting" eye, like that common with the Shangs. But there is a distinct similarity in the fact that the Northwest Coast eye very frequently tends towards the rectangular in shape, while the pupil frequently and the whole eye oc casionally has a like form in Shang design. I have no intention of trying to explain these similarities at present, what has been stated is fact?as such, it must have some explanation. ... To North America particularly the way for cultural transmission seems to have been open to some degree. And preliminary reconnaissance of the art of these areas justifies the hope that careful research in these directions may not prove unfruitful. In another publication, while discussing the similarities between ancient Chinese and mod ern Northwest Coast art, Creel states: These are the only two areas in the world in which this technique is used, according to my present information. This may be another indication of the Pacific affinities of Shang civilization.1106 Collins also wisely reserves judgment as to whether Northwest Coast art is related to either that of the Old Bering Sea Eskimo or to that of Bronze Age China. I doubt whether there could be any direct relationship between Old 1106 Creel, 1937 a, p. 122. Bering Sea and Northwest Coast styles, for if there had been, I should have found some trace of it in southwestern Alaska. However, in view of the strong Asiatic stimulation which has been in part responsible for the development of Northwest Coast culture, I should be surprised if we could not trace to some North Pacific Asiatic source much of the inspiration that has brought about the flowering of modern North west Coast art.1107 In other words, the latter may be a much later phenomenon, parallel to Old Bering Sea Styles 2 and 3, and both of these contain something which may ultimately be traced back to the dawn of Chinese civiliza tion. Both Punuk and Thule art are conventional and stiff as compared with ancient Alaskan art. Punuk art is in part a degenerate descendant of Old Bering Sea Styles 2 and 3, but Collins agrees with me that the fully developed Punuk style was produced under Siberian influence that introduced iron in small amounts for incis ing straight narrow lines and making the mechanically perfect dot-and-circle.1108 Before these changes had completely revolutionized Punuk art, we can see a transitional period in which the round bored dot became dominant, the short transverse lines became bands of transverse lines, and these, together with Y shaped elements (not, I think, to be confused with Thule or modern Alaskan detached Y figures) were blended into connected pat terns. All of these features are found in northern Eurasian art styles. At the same time, the double line with alternating internal spurs, which had appeared but rarely in Old Bering Sea art, was developed to a new importance under the impact of the imported Siberian styles. Although Thule art may have been derived in large part from Old Bering Sea Style 1 by a process of simplification and degeneration, simi lar to that which links Early Punuk art to Old Bering Sea Styles 2 and 3, here too we find evi dence of Siberian influence. In Thule art there is also the development of the round bored dot (but it stands alone, and is not attached to lines or enclosed within triangular spaces, as in 1107 For example, Montandon (1937, pp. 164 f., PL 19) points out similarities in design composition in Ainu cloth ing and Chilkat blankets, and believes that Northwest Coast art is related to that of the Ainu. 1108 de Laguna, 1932-1933, II, pp. 79, 82 f.; Collins, 1937 a, pp. 301 ff.</page><page sequence="274">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 267 Punuk art) and there is also the rise to a posi tion of great importance of the double line with alternating internal spurs. In both Thule and Punuk art straight lines are used as bor ders, but the latter still retains something of the Old Bering Sea use of space-filling designs. Thule art received less from Siberia than did the Punuk, the main difference being that it failed to adopt metal-cut lines and the dot-and circle. This was probably due to the fact that it developed on the northern fringe of the area reached by these Siberian influences, and be cause it was carried into Canada while Punuk art was still being developed. Furthermore, Thule art was characterized both in Alaska and in Canada by representations of men and ani mals, while these are lacking in Punuk art. The small Thule silhouette figures are so dif ferent in style from the outlined suggestions of animal forms found in Old Bering Sea Styles 2 and 3 that we cannot see any connection be tween the two. On the whole, I do not think that we can say that Thule art was descended from any style that we have yet found, though its beginnings must have been linked to the Old Bering Sea Style 1 of St. Lawrence Island. Once established in Canada, Thule art was probably influenced to some extent by Dorset art, but as yet we can only guess what hap pened. We can conclude that, on the whole, Tena art is more like modern northern Alaskan art than like the modern art of the Yukon-Bristol Bay area, while at the same time it has pre served a few simple but exceedingly ancient elements that have died out almost everywhere else. In a few respects it exhibits a local style and also reflects modern Siberian influences. We can also say that the various modern styles of Eskimo art can be explained on the basis of four ancient and related styles: Old Bering Sea 1, Dorset, ancient southwestern Alaskan, and the still more hypothetical proto Thule. These have developed further as a re sult of mutual interaction and as a result of foreign stimulation, from Siberia, the Asiatic North Pacific, and the American Northwest Coast.</page><page sequence="275">CHAPTER X FINAL CONCLUSIONS THE BUILDING OF TENA CULTURE IN ATTEMPTING to analyze the various elements which belong to Tena culture we have purposely allowed ourselves to digress in order to discuss the possible origin and develop ment of a number of traits that were only poorly represented in Tena culture, or even of those which we found no further up the Yukon than Fox Creek. But now we must return and try to place together the Tena elements in some sort of order. I must confess that my dis cussion has been perhaps too much from the point of view of Eskimo culture and not enough from the point of view of northern Athabaskan culture. This is in part the result of a personal bias, and in part because the literature is far fuller on Eskimo than on Athabaskan material culture and technology. On the other hand, it will by this time be quite evident that the Tena have been very strongly influenced by their Eskimo neighbors. The fact that some of the Eskimo elements in Tena culture are themselves old Eskimo traits, while others are quite new, would indicate that borrowing has been going on for a long time, and that consequently the Tena have probably been living on the Yukon in contact with the Eskimo for a considerable period. We have, in fact, found nothing to in dicate that the Tena had come to the Yukon from any other area. (Naturally our finds throw no light at all on the origin of the Athabas kans.) Unfortunately there was no archaeologi cal clue as to whether the Tena-Eskimo boundary had shifted, though we cannot imagine it to have been always stable. On the other hand, certain types found within the present territory of the Kutchin (pottery, double-ended splitting adzes) might suggest that in former times the Tena lived farther up the Yukon; but these finds may indicate only that the lower Kutchin have borrowed the types in question. It is with some hesitation that I shall at tempt to show from what sources and strata of culture have come the elements now found in Tena culture. My estimate of the age and posi tion of any given trait must depend on what is known about its distribution, both among living tribes and in archaeological horizons. Naturally it was impossible to examine all areas, or even to comb all the literature for even those areas within which I have sought for in formation. Moreover, too few areas have been archaeologically explored, and even where the archaeological sequence seems to be well known, fresh discoveries, like that of the Ipiutak Eskimo culture at Point Hope, may demand reversal of long-cherished points of view. The following hypothetical scheme can best serve if it clearly states the problems that face us and perhaps suggests new directions for research. In this analysis I follow in the main the scheme of cultural stratification outlined by my former collaborator, Dr. Kaj Birket-Smith. The earliest of these is the "Ice-hunting culture," or rather, "cultures," since he has made clear that he does not consider this ever to have been a uniform culture. "It is incredible," he has written, "that an absolutely homogeneous cul ture should ever have prevailed over the whole circumpolar region. There will certainly always have been differences owing to local adaptation, just as it is most probable that an element has at times only reached one of the borders simul taneously with its already having made way for a new one elsewhere. [In this respect] a term [such] as ice-hunting culture is merely an ab straction, an expression meaning that a certain common basis must be assumed to lie under the building up of the culture everywhere in the circumpolar region."1 He has also stated that "in view of the fact that certain elements in the ice-hunting culture have a western diffusion in North America, this may be a hint that some day it will be possible to distinguish between earlier and later layers in that culture."2 We are still unable to say what were the various local aspects of this "culture," or what elements belong to its various temporal stages, though I believe we are now a little closer than we were in 1929. Birket-Smith took as a criterion of antiquity the wide present-day distribution of a trait in native circumpolar culture, plus its antiquity at the relatively few sites that had been ex 1 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, p. 216. 2 Op. tit., II, p. 215. Cf. Collins, 1937 a, p. 382. 268</page><page sequence="276">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 269 cavated when he wrote. Since the publication of his monumental work on the Caribou Eski mo, further archaeological finds have been made, some of them in critical areas. This means that in a number of cases we have ar chaeological hints of the age of the types in question, but in almost as many cases the prob lem seems to have been made more complicated rather than simplified. Birket-Smith has taken the inland-dwelling Caribou Eskimo of the Canadian Barren Grounds as the purest modern representatives of the Ice-hunting "culture," and considers the other Eskimo groups as representatives of a later adaptation to the Arctic coast, an adapta tion that took place in the Central Eskimo area.3 In other words, he sees the Ice-hunting culture as originally an inland way of life, adapted to frozen lakes and streams, not to the frozen sea. Hatt had a rather similar picture of this ancient hunting stage, but he thought of it as coastal, reserving the term "inland culture" for the later Snowshoe hunting stage. Both Mathiassen and Collins have followed Hatt's notion that the more ancient culture was coastal in character.4 This disagreement as to whether the ancient culture which gave rise to the origi nal Eskimo way of life was coastal or inland in nature is due in part to the fact that Birket Smith, Mathiassen, and Collins have taken different Eskimo groups (Caribou Eskimo, Thule, Old Bering Sea) as representatives of the oldest Eskimo stage. It is not my intention to attempt to decide the conflicting claims for antiquity: the Caribou Eskimo have as yet no archaeology; the Old Bering Sea cannot stand alone as the oldest archaeological Eskimo re mains. But I suspect that part of the difficulty is because the Ice-hunting "culture" may have had both inland and coastal aspects, and that these were of local rather than of chronological significance. Eskimo culture, if we are ever able to analyze it thoroughly, may prove to be a mixture of elements from a number of these local aspects, some coastal, some inland, some Eurasian, some North American in origin.5 I have already suggested in the course of this book that we may have to introduce a still further modification of the Ice-hunting culture, as Birket-Smith originally conceived it. He saw 8 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, p. 226. 4 Hatt, 1916; Mathiassen, 1927, II, pp. 196-201; Collins, 1937 a, pp. 381 f. 6 See the additions Collins suggests to Birket-Smith's list of traits (Collins, 1937 a, p. 382). this ancient pattern from the point of view of the Caribou Eskimo, a people far removed from the crossroads between the Old World and the New, so that the perspective which he obtained was one in which the elements from the two continents appeared blended. It was in the area of Bering Sea and the North Pacific that this cultural intermingling must have taken place, long before these ancient elements reached the Canadian Barren Grounds. Not only was it difficult from his point of view to see what traits were American and what Asiatic in origin, but the whole perspective was necessarily an Arctic one. When Collins looked at the problem from the Old Bering Sea culture on St. Law rence Island, he stood between the two con tinents, and so gained a new outlook, but it was still Arctic. The lower Yukon and southwestern Alaska from which we have attempted to sur vey the scene is not only close to the meeting ground between Asia and America, but it is also definitely sub-Arctic, and from here we have been able to catch the reflections of two cul tural streams, one primarily Arctic, the other North Pacific. The bulk of the elements as signed by Birket-Smith to the Ice-hunting horizon are shared by both streams, but others we can tentatively place in one or the other of these two great cultural continua. In moving from central Canada to St. Lawrence Island and thence to the lower Yukon we have, therefore, gained three different per spectives. We have still to go to Asia to see the cultural series from the other side. As yet our landscape appears rather flat and lacks that three-dimensional character which it should have if we are to understand it thoroughly. My criteria, therefore, for distinguishing between an Arctic and a North Pacific phase have been obtained primarily from Alaska, and here the two cultural streams have undoubtedly inter mingled even in the earliest times of which we have any record. Without a better knowledge of the archaeology of northeastern Siberia and of the Japanese archipelago and Kamchatka, my theories must remain vague, speculative, and subject to grave error. The bulk of the Ice hunting traits I dare not assign to either cul tural continuum, and if I label some as Arctic and others as North Pacific, this does not imply that they originated in either area, but only that they seem to have traveled through these areas between the two continents, or that they were particularly characteristic of one region or the other. In other words, we seem to sight</page><page sequence="277">270 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 some primarily on the shores of Bering Sea and others along the great island arc that fringes the North Pacific between Japan and Puget Sound. In the classification of Tena traits, given below, I have divided the most ancient ele ments into several categories: (List 1) earlier Ice-hunting traits, and (List 2) later Ice-hunt ing traits. The latter have a more limited dis tribution, being especially characteristic of the American Arctic and Northwest and northern Asia. Within each group I have indicated the few that seem to belong specifically to the Arc tic and North Pacific groups. Lastly there are (List 3) ancient Eskimo traits. These may also belong to the Ice-hunting horizon. For those elements which form part of the North Pacific cultural continuum and which may have originated below the sub-Arctic belt, say in southeastern Asia, the term "Ice-hunt ing" is a misnomer, even though they became thoroughly acclimated to the north. We should properly reserve that expression for the traits which originated in the boreal regions, but until we are able to segregate the northern from the more southern elements it is safer to use the classic designation. The second great cultural stage, represented by List 4, is that which Birket-Smith has classed as the "Snowshoe culture." This con tains not only new elements, absent from the earlier Ice-hunting culture, but includes a num ber of the earlier traits which were taken over into the newer complex. Some of these were modified in the process. Hatt and Hallowell have discussed and enumerated a number of the typical Snowshoe traits,6 and Collins has suggested the addition of others which appeared in Alaska in the Punuk stage.7 Again, I feel that we may be dealing here with a cultural stage that had several layers or several local expressions, even though the Snowshoe com plex is much more homogeneous than the Ice hunting. Thus the additional traits listed by Collins (together with plate armor, which did not spread far in North America) were adopted by the Eskimo from a warlike Siberian Snow shoe culture. 6Hatt, 1916; Hallowell, 1926; Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, pp. 518 f. 7 Collins, 1937 a, p. 382: blunt bird arrow, wrist guard, sinew-backed bow (?), bird bola (?), crooked knife(?). The blunt bird arrow and sinew-backed bow may, however, have been present in the Old Bering Sea, cf. our Chapter IX, pp. 208, 209, 210, note 618. The third important complex (List 5) is the "circum-Pacific culture drift." There can hardly be any doubt that the general direction of this drift has been from Asia, more particularly from the Lower Amur region, towards North America. In particular instances, however, it may be exceedingly difficult to de cide whether an element originated on the Asiatic or American side of the ocean, for we must not forget that the favorable geographical conditions of the American Northwest Coast give it every opportunity of developing into a cultural center, at least of secondary rank compared with the Asiatic side.8 After discussing a number of these traits, as they appear in Eyak culture, Birket-Smith con cludes: It is striking that none of the here-mentioned circum-Pa cific traits has been carried along the Arctic coast with the eastward'spread of the Thule culture, but on the other hand this does not necessarily mean that the circum-Pacific culture drift reached Alaska after the eastward migration of the Thule Eskimo, for it may have followed a southern route (over the Aleutian Islands ?) which did not bring it into contact with the Thule culture farther north. This is an important problem which must wait till more informa tion is at hand.9 I believe that this spread of culture did follow the Aleutian route and that it occurred at the beginning of, or during, the period character ized by the Kachemak Bay III culture, that is, after the Thule culture had moved east. I be lieve, further, that the impact of this Asiatic culture stream (or rather of those elements in it that turned south) was in large part responsi ble for stimulating the growth of northern Northwest Coast culture. This circum-Pacific drift was undoubtedly complex. Some ele ments affected primarily the southern Eskimo and not the Northwest Coast Indians, others the Northwest Coast and not the Eskimo, ex cept in certain cases of rediffusion from the coastal Indians. Either there were particular cultural and geographical reasons for this dis criminating reception, or else the drift consisted of two or more rather distinct complexes that traveled separately and took rather different routes after reaching American soil. I have al ready pointed out the curious circumstance that so many of these elements seem to have passed through Aleut territory without leaving any trace of their passage. List 6 comprises a number of traits which the Tena received from the Northwest Coast or adjacent areas (southwestern Alaska or the 8 Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, p. 520. 9 Op. cit., p. 529.</page><page sequence="278">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 271 Plateau). Here I have suggested a division into earlier and later groups. Two additional types seem to come specifically from the Pacific Eskimo. List 7 includes those items which the Tena have copied from the modern or protohistoric Alaskan Eskimo. In some cases, the trait is shared only with the Norton Sound-Bristol Bay group. List 8 comprises four local recent types. List 9 mentions only a few items introduced in modern times as a result of Russian expansion. List 1: Ice-hunting Traits (1) Single-pole gable roof. This is derived from the ridged tent (or two-sided lean-to). The center of distribution is now on the North west Coast, from which the Tena probably re ceived it, and it is there associated particularly with the plank house. The latter was introduced or stimulated by the circum-Pacific culture drift. (Cf. Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, p. 519.) (2) Semisubterranean house with entrance tunnel, taken from the local Eskimo, perhaps not very long ago, although this type is itself of great antiquity. (3) Dome-shaped dwelling with roof made of bent poles. (4) The pit cache, found among the Alaskan Eskimo, Tanaina and other western Atha baskans, Indians of the southern Northwest Coast, the Southwest, Southeast, Northeast, and the Plains (Mandan, Pawnee, etc.), Fort Ancient aspect, the Koryak, Kamchadal, Tungus, Yakut, Samoyed, etc., and apparently of Paleolithic age in Europe. (5) Inhumation. I have already suggested that inhumation and the pit cache may be re lated. (6) Planing adz. Found as an ancient and common Eskimo type, known from the north ern Athabaskans, from the Northwest Coast and Plateau to California, in the Northeastern Woodlands, and in northeastern Asia, going back to the Chinese Neolithic, where several thick forms suggest the prototype of the later splitting adz. (7) Elbow-handle for the planing adz, prob ably descended from a handle like the Lyngby type of adz-ax-pick. It is ancestral to the socketed adz of the Eskimo and to the T shaped handle of the Northwest Coast splitting adz. It is an ancient Eskimo type, dating back to the Ipiutak, Dorset, Birnirk, and ancient Pacific Eskimo horizons, and is also found on the Northwest Coast, is widespread and an cient in the Northeastern Woodlands, and in Asia dates back to the Neolithic of Siberia and China. (8) Original prototype of the club-pick, al though the particular Tena types seem to be later descendants (see below). (9) Bone wedge. This is merely the northern (Arctic) form of the more widespread wooden wedge. It is an ancient and common Eskimo type, and is also made by a few northern Atha baskans, and by the Kamchadal, Ainu, and probably by the Neolithic Siberians and Man churians. (10) Chipped leaf-shaped blade with tang. If we consider the shape alone and not the style of flaking we find this to be an ancient common Eskimo type (with few exceptions), made also by the northern Athabaskans, the Indians of the southern Northwest Coast and Plateau, by the Chukchee, Koryak and Ainu. Although my study has failed to exhibit what must have been its very great distribution, I feel that it must belong in the Ice-hunting horizon. (11) Stiletto. Found among the Chugach (and probably an ancient Pacific Eskimo type), the Central and Greenland Eskimo (suggesting a Dorset origin, since it is not a Thule element), some Athabaskans, and in the Archaic and Iroquois cultures of the Northeast. This is probably a North Pacific type. (12) Ulo. An ancient common Eskimo type, (except for the Ipiutak and original Dorset), also found on the Northwest Coast with exten sions on the Plateau, in California and in the Southwest, and with large extensions from the Eskimo in the Northeast. In Asia it belongs to the mainland: Chukchee, Koryak, Kamcha dal, Neolithic China, Manchuria and Mongolia, and from there to Neolithic Korea and Japan, extending to the southern Ainu. It seems to be specifically Arctic. (13) Plain dorsal handle for the ulo. (14) Ulo-shaped scraper. This dates back to the Folsom and Pinto Basin cultures in North America and is found practically all over the western, western central, southwestern, and Arctic parts of the continent. There are also extensions of the distribution in the North east. I do not know its distribution in Asia, but we may assume that there it has an equally im pressive antiquity. (15) Chipped end scraper. Probably dates</page><page sequence="279">272 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 back in an uninterrupted sequence to the Paleo lithic. (16) The scraper made of a split long bone (or sharpened long bone) with a longitudinal cutting edge, or edges ("beaming tool"), and the related scapula scraper, with longitudinal edge, may be taken as a single type. It has a great antiquity in North America, being found among the ancient Pacific Eskimo, Old Bering Sea, Dorset, and other more recent Eskimo, some Athabaskans, some Plateau Indians, and was probably used on the Northwest Coast be fore textiles were highly developed. It is also found in California, the Plains, Southwest, Northeastern Woodlands (dating back to the Archaic), and in the Hopewell culture. In a later, more specialized form it is common in Northeastern Asia. It probably dates back to the Ice-hunting horizon though it was taken over and used extensively by the Snowshoe hunters. (17) Bone arrowhead without barbs or in serted blade. The particular type used by the Tena is especially like that of the Kachemak Bay III and Chugach Eskimo. Similar forms seem to be especially characteristic of the North Pacific, since we have found them on the south ern Northwest Coast, among the Ainu, and in Bronze Age China (?). However, they are also known farther north: among the Chukchee, modern Bering Strait Eskimo, transitional Thule-Central Eskimo, sites on the Kola Peninsula in Siberia. They have been found in the Northern Coastal culture of the American Northeast. (18) Slender barbed point. The Tena speci mens show a considerable variety of styles, although the fundamental type belongs to ancient Alaska (Old Bering Sea, Ipiutak, Pacific Eskimo) and to the southern Northwest Coast. It is, moreover, only one form assumed by the more widely distributed barbed bone arrow head, the prototypes of which probably are derived from the Upper Paleolithic via the northern European Mesolithic or an analogous Asiatic stage. (19) Barbed bone point for multipronged dart, arrow or leister. This belongs to the an cient Eskimo, especially to the Dorset and southwestern Alaska, and has been largely sup planted in the American Arctic by the Eskimo bird dart. It is also found on the southern Northwest Coast, Northwest Plateau, and in the Northeast. It is now rare in Northern Asia (cf. Birket-Smith, 1929, II, pp. 152 f.). It has probably survived on the Yukon because this area is peripheral to that in which the bird dart is dominant. The invention of the latter is re sponsible for leaving the multipronged dart conspicuous in the North Pacific. (20) V-shaped compound fishhook. Although this has previously been listed as a Northwest Coast trait (Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, p. 522), I believe now that it is much older. In its simple generalized form it is found in Kachemak Bay I, Old Bering Sea, Punuk, Thule (as a gull hook), modern Central and Greenland Eskimo cultures. It is also known from the Eyak and northern Athabaskans, the southern Northwest Coast, Northwestern Pla teau, California, Northeast, from the Koryak, and (with a stone shank) from Neolithic Si beria. It is ancestral to the Punuk hook with many points, to the Northwest Coast halibut hook with curved shank, and to the hook with barbed barb. The latter specialized form is known from the Pacific Eskimo, Northwest Coast, and from southeastern Hudson Bay (with a stone as well as a bone shank) where it has probably survived from the Dorset culture. This form probably belongs to the North Pacific. (22) Ice pick. An ancient and universal Eskimo type, shared by the northern Atha baskans. Though lacking (?) from the Ipiutak, it seems to be an Arctic Ice-hunting type. (23) Shovel, especially for snow. Arctic. (24) Wooden spoons and dippers. The Tena forms are, however, like modern Bristol Bay and Norton Sound specimens in style, betraying Northwest Coast influence in painted decora tion. (25) Wooden dish. The same remarks apply. (26) Twined grass mats. I believe that this trait is of great antiquity, although we unfor tunately lack specific archaeological informa tion about it. I would assume it to be North Pacific rather than Arctic. It is found among the Pacific and Bering Strait Eskimo, Tanaina, Northwest Coast Indians (in wool), Indians of the Northwestern Plateau, Oregon, Plains, and in the Hopewell culture of the upper Missis sippi. It is also made by the Chukchee (?), Koryak, Kamchadal, and Ainu. The oldest specimens are twined upward from left to right. The Tena and Pacific Eskimo mats are old fashioned in this respect. (27) Pendants. Ancient and almost univer sal. (28) Buttons and toggles. Arctic ?.</page><page sequence="280">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 273 (29) Wooden hook for trap or snare. If asso ciated with the deadfall, this is probably an Ice-hunting trait (cf. Birket-Smith, 1929, II, p. 209), but identification of the Tena specimen is uncertain. Archaeological examples are lack ing for comparison except from the Old Bering Sea and Chugach Eskimo. (30) Composite comb. The North American center of distribution lies on the Northwestern Plateau. It is the older Athabaskan type, and is found among the Aleut (suggesting that it is an ancient Pacific Eskimo-Aleut type), and among the East Greenlanders (suggesting that it belonged to the Dorset Eskimo, since the Thule comb was made in one piece). It is really of great antiquity, to judge by its distribution in South America and in other parts of the world. From our point of view we may class it as North Pacific. We cannot discuss the top, since identifica tion of the Tena specimen is uncertain. We do not know the function of the bird bone tubes: if for needlecases, drinking tubes, or beads, they are probably Ice-hunting types. The leaf shaped flake is universal and is undoubtedly ancient, but the Tena specimens are too little specialized to make discussion profitable. In humation in the house may be geographically conditioned, since this is likely to be the only thawed spot in winter where inhumation is pos sible. If due to choice, it may reflect either the North Pacific continuum or the circum-Pa cific culture drift, since it is practiced by the Ainu, Aleut, some Athabaskans, and some In dians of the southern Northwest Coast and Northwestern Plateau. Lamellar flakes (if we can claim them as Tena) are known from the upper Tanana, Fairbanks on the middle Ta nana, the Old Bering Sea and Dorset cultures, and may belong to an ancient flintworking technique related to that of the Epipaleolithic of Mongolia. We also find them in Kamchatka, Turkestan, Korea, Japan, and among the Ainu of Hokkaido. They may be North Pacific rather than Arctic. List 2: Later Ice-hunting Traits These are particularly characteristic of the American Arctic and Northwest and of north eastern Asia, and most seem to be of Old World origin. (1) Grooved stone club head. Belongs to the ancient Pacific Eskimo, Northwest Coast, Plains, Southwest, California, and to the Chukchee and Koryak. It belongs to the North Pacific continuum ? (2) Socketed planing adz with bone haft. (The haft was found only at Fox Creek, but the small size of the planing adz blades found at Tena sites suggest the use of the haft.) This is an ancient common Eskimo type, also found on the southern Northwest Coast, in north eastern Asia probably dating from the Chinese Neolithic, and in Europe dating from the Mesolithic. It seems to be an Arctic trait. The original form of the haft probably had a socket for the blade and a hole for the handle (Old Bering Sea, hypothetical Chinese Neolithic, European Mesolithic, Salish); later forms had a groove for the lashing and a flattened place to fit the top of the handle (Old Bering Sea, Ipiu tak, Dorset, Pacific Eskimo, Salish). Holes for the handle lashing are an Arctic Eskimo (Thule, Punuk) development, reintroduced into mod ern Alaska from Canada, and this is the modern Yukon type. The Yukon does not seem to have been affected by the degeneration of the bone haft which was produced by the influence of the elbow handle of the simple unsocketed adz and which resulted in the substitution of a bed instead of a socket to hold the blade (Old Ber ing Sea, Punuk, modern Bering Strait, Pacific Eskimo). (3) Leaf-shaped slate blade with tang. An ancient and almost universal Eskimo type, known from the Old Bering Sea (lacking in the Ipiutak), Dorset, and Kachemak Bay III cultures, and modern Eskimo cultures. It is found widely distributed on the Northwest Coast and in the northeastern areas affected by Dorset influence. It seems to have been made formerly in Siberia (?), in Neolithic China and Indochina, Mongolia, and Manchuria, from which it spread to Korea and the proto-Japa nese, but not to the Ainu. In Europe it dates from the "Arctic Stone Age" of Scandinavia. It is an Arctic type. (4) Leaf-shaped slate blade without tang. This is a closely allied form that appears spo radically with the blade with tang. The Tena variant is the "Halibut Cove" type with straight sides, and this seems to have appeared independently at a number of places: Old Bering Sea ?, Kachemak Bay II, southern Northwest Coast, northern California, Man churia, etc. It is also an Arctic type. (5) Triangular slate blade. The fundamental type has flat or facetted surfaces and a straight base. It is an Arctic type, found among the</page><page sequence="281">274 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 Birnirk, Thule, Dorset, and late Punuk Es kimo, but is rare among the Pacific Eskimo. It is also made by the Northwest Coast In dians and the Chukchee. It dates back to Neo lithic China, and seems to have spread via Manchuria and Korea to Japan. The grooved surface and the concave base are two inde pendent features which may appear sporadi cally. For the former there may have been two centers: one, Eskimo-Northwest Coast, the other, Asiatic. The common Tena form with both concave base and grooved surfaces is an accidental type resulting from the combination of these two features. It is probably not very old in Alaska. (6) Detachable barbed bone heads. These may not be very common among the Tena. They belong to the Dorset, Thule (rare), and ancient Aleut-Pacific Eskimo cultures, and in modern times are common in southern Alaska as far north as Bering Strait. They are also made by some northern Athabaskans, Indians of the Northwest Coast and Plateau, southern California coast; in the Northeast they date back to the Laurentian aspect, probably as a result of Eskimo influence. A few have been found on the Plains, probably derived from the Northwest Coast and Plateau. They are known from the Kamchadal (rare), Ainu, Japanese, and Koryak. They seem to belong to the North Pacific continuum. In Europe they date back to the Mesolithic and late Upper Paleolithic. The examples found at Fox Creek in general reflect, the southwestern Alaskan types, al though the ridge around the tang is a local feature, and the central line hole and conical tang suggest modern northern Alaskan types. Presumably the Tena forms were similar. Heads with barbs on one edge and heads with barbs placed asymmetrically on both are probably only variations of the same funda mental type that have appeared independently in different regions at different times, although the form with barbs on one edge is commoner and may be the older. (7) Fish spear with central prong and two barbed side prongs. This is an old common Eskimo type dating back to the Old Bering Sea (?), Ipiutak, Dorset, and ancient Pacific Eskimo cultures (although it is now lacking among the Aleut). It is used by the Atha baskans, Indians of the Northwest Plateau and California, but is not common on the North west Coast, perhaps because of the develop ment there of the fish trap. It is also used in the Northeast. The Aleut, Pacific Eskimo, California Indians (?), and the Ainu used a barbed bone barb on the side prong, but the plain barb dates back to the Neolithic of Si beria. The Tena type reflects the most primi tive Eskimo form. While it is impossible to assign the plain barb to either the Arctic or North Pacific phase of the Ice-hunting culture, the barbed barb (not used by the Tena) seems to have been an element of the circum-Pacific culture drift. (8) The bow drill and/or cord drill are com mon and ancient types in Eskimo culture, with the exception of the Dorset. They are primarily Arctic elements. The hand drill is the most uni versal form of drill, but the bow drill probably came from Asia to North America via Bering Strait before the Old Bering Sea and Ipiutak cultures were established and after Dorset cul ture had begun to develop. The bow drill also belonged to the Northwest Coast, and from there and from the Eskimo was diffused to a few Athabaskan and Plateau tribes. The hand rest for the drill is an old trait, common to the Eskimo and to northeastern Asia, although it is not found among the Tena. It belonged to the Old Bering Sea culture and was the exclu sive type in southwestern Alaska. Made of stone, it is typical of the Bristol Bay and Nor ton Sound Eskimo, Aleut, Kamchadal, and the Neolithic inhabitants of Japan and Manchuria. The stone rest may have entered the New World with the circum-Pacific culture drift. In any case, it has been combined with the Es kimo mouthpiece of bone to produce the bone mouthpiece with stone inset used by the Bristol Bay-Bering Strait Eskimo and the Tena. (9) Bone dagger. This belongs to the Punuk Thule-Kachemak Bay III horizon, and is found also among modern Alaskan Eskimo, Northwest Coast Indians, Athabaskans and Northwestern Plateau tribes. It is character istically Arctic. It also occurs in the Northeast (Northern Coastal and Point Peninsula) and in a form transitional between the stiletto and dag ger is found in the Hopewell and Laurentian cultures. It dates back to the Neolithic in Si beria. Some Ipiutak swords (?) may represent a more direct and earlier importation from this source than do the Punuk daggers. (10) Wooden dish with inlays. This is known from the Old Bering Sea and Kachemak Bay III cultures (the inlay only, in the latter), modern Bristol Bay and Norton Sound Eskimo, and the Northwest Coast. It is possible that</page><page sequence="282">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 275 this type of decoration was derived from the Chinese Bronze Age. There were, of course, other centers of inlay work in North America. Inlaying in the Arctic-Northwest Coast region may be related to the fastening on of button like ornaments, as was practiced in the Old Bering Sea, Dorset, and modern Greenland Eskimo cultures. (11) Painting of implements. In a simple form this was practiced by the Old Bering Sea Eskimo and possibly by other groups from which no archaeological data has survived. The high development of this art among the Tena and modern Alaskan Eskimo must be referred to rather recent influence from the Northwest Coast Indians and Pacific Eskimo. This influ ence may also account for the presence of this trait among other Athabaskans and on the Plateau. It is hard to say to what degree paint ing was practiced in ancient times, but we should probably class it among the traits of the later Ice-hunting horizon. (12) Coiled basket. This is an old and common Eskimo type, dating back almost cer tainly to the Punuk-Thule and perhaps to the Old Bering Sea and Dorset. It is made by the northern Ainu, Koryak, and Kamchadal in Asia, and the distribution on the American continent (Eskimo, Plateau, California, South west) would indicate that the coiled basket is older than the twined basket of the Aleut and Pacific Eskimo and the Northwest Coast In dians. (13) Twined bags. Among the Eskimo, these date back to the Punuk culture at least. We cannot be sure of the extent to which the pres ent distribution of this trait among the In dians has been influenced by the development of twined basketry on the Northwest Coast. (14) One-piece comb. This is known from the Old Bering Sea and from modern Arctic and eastern Eskimo cultures, although it is lack ing from the ancient Aleut-Pacific Eskimo, and from the original Dorset. The later Dorset peoples probably took it over from the Thule Eskimo, since some of the combs of the North eastern Indians reflect Eskimo styles. It is also found on the Northwest Coast and has spread to some extent to the Athabaskans and Plateau tribes. It is widely distributed in northeastern Asia and dates back to the Bronze Age of China and to the Mesolithic of Northern Europe. It is an Arctic trait. (15) Pottery, paddled, patch-modeled, tem pered with gravel and/or organic matter, mixed and smeared with fat. This type of ware is found among the ancient Eskimo north of the Alaskan Peninsula (with the exception of the Ipiutak at Point Hope), among the pre historic Kodiak Eskimo, the Neolithic Sibe rians, the Chukchee, Koryak, Kamchadal, Ainu, Neolithic Mongolians, Manchurians, and Chi nese. It may be related to European Mesolithic pottery. It is, however, lacking among the Ipiutak, Dorset, and (except for a few sherds of relatively recent date) Pacific Eskimo, and the Indians of the Northwest Coast and Pla teau. It may not be as old in North America as most of the traits included in this list, although I would class it as an Arctic Ice-hunting ele ment. The shapes made in this pottery include the round lamp, and the cooking pot with rounded (less often flat) bottom and straight or barrel-shaped sides. With the exception of a few specimens from the Upper Tena, the par ticular shapes and finish of Tena pottery re flect more recent styles. The round lamp may be more recent among the Tena than the cook ing pot. (16) Stone mortar. This is found on the Northwest Coast, Plateau, California, and in the Northeast. Among the Eskimo, it is known from Kachemak Bay III, and though diffused in recent times as far as St. Lawrence Island and the Yukon, it is a rare and atypical trait. In Asia, the stone mortar is known from the Chuk chee, Koryak, Kamchadal, Ainu, Japanese, and Neolithic Mongolians. The distribution sug gests the relatively recent circum-Pacific cul ture drift, although stone mortars seem to ante date this movement on both continents, so I tentatively class them as North Pacific. It is possible, of course, that we are dealing with several centers which have coalesced. We must also remember that wooden mortars may have been used in areas from which we have no re port and where they have disappeared without leaving a trace. The distribution of the stone mortar can hardly be understood without in cluding that of the wooden utensil. (17) Oval lamp. Although it is known from the Dorset and ancient Aleut-Pacific Eskimo, it is only rarely found as far north as the Yukon and Bering Strait. Its southern distribution in cludes the Tlingit, some Plateau and southern Californian tribes. In Eurasia, it is known from the Chukchee, Koryak (?), Kamchadal, Ainu, Neolithic Japanese (?), and from India, Ceylon, the Royal Tombs of Ur, and the Danish Meso lithic. This is a North Pacific trait.</page><page sequence="283">276 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 List 3: Ancient Eskimo Traits These traits have obviously been borrowed by the Tena from the Eskimo, although we must not assume that all this borrowing took place at the same time. While the traits have a great antiquity in Eskimo culture, and are for the most part typically "Eskimo," we must not credit the Eskimo with having been the originators of them in every case, for a good number of the elements are also at home in other old cultural contexts. (1) The cribbed roof. This is especially as sociated with the kashim in the Bristol Bay and Norton Sound area, and with houses in Norton Sound, and has been adopted by the Tena for both kashims and houses. The cribbed roof, especially as used with the kashim, sug gests the kiva of the Pueblo area and this ar gues for the antiquity of this type of roof in North America. I have pointed out the reasons for believing that a knowledge of cribbing was essential to the development of the snow house of the Thule and modern Central Eskimo. Among the Tena and their immediate Eskimo neighbors the cribbed roof has survived be cause it is so well adapted to a large structure like the kashim. The winter snow house of the modern Central Eskimo represents a speciali zation in another direction. The Tena have probably borrowed the cribbed roof in rela tively recent times. (2) The toggle harpoon head with open socket and medial spur. This is an ancient Eskimo type, dating back to the Dorset and Kachemak Bay I cultures, and appears in the Old Bering Sea in an elaborated form. The Tena probably owe their use of this type to contacts with the Pacific Eskimo, among whom it survived for a long time. Open socket har poon heads probably belong to the Ice-hunting culture. The type with medial spur may have to be assigned to the North Pacific phase, al though it is still unknown from Asia, because some Ainu closed heads have the medial spur. (3) The rather long, slightly curved scraper handle. This is probably an ancient type, be longing to the Old Bering Sea (?), Thule (?), and Kachemak Bay III cultures. I suspect that fuller archaeological data would establish it in the Dorset and in the earliest periods of the Pacific Eskimo-Aleut cultures. It now sur vives especially in the Bristol Bay and Bering Strait areas, from which the Tena obtained it. Other Athabaskan and Plateau scraper handles are straight. The curved type may, of course, be older than we now suspect. (4) Ground slate scraper blades. These are known from the Thule, Kachemak Bay III, modern Alaskan Eskimo, and proto-Japanese cultures. They probably represent an old Eskimo type, since the adz-like scrapers of the Old Bering Sea and Dorset Eskimo may be considered as specialized variants. (5) Knife handle with blade slit in the edge at the end. This is the primitive form from which the prototype of the handle for the crooked knife was developed (see List 4, Trait 5). The straight handles of the Old Bering Sea and Dorset cultures are local variants of the original primitive form. It is also found in Kamchatka and was probably known in Neo lithic China. Perhaps this simple type of knife handle belongs to the Ice-hunting horizon, but our information is not complete enough to date it. The use of side blades is a Mesolithic trait. (6) Single-edged slate knife blade. This is an ancient Eskimo type, known from the Old Ber ing Sea (lacking in the Ipiutak), Birnirk, Thule, Punuk, Kachemak Bay III (not earlier ? and not found among the Aleut), and from modern Eskimo cultures. Its appearance in the North east suggests that it belongs to the Dorset cul ture. It was made by the prehistoric Japanese (and Ainu ?), and probably belonged to Bronze Age China. Again we may be dealing with an element of the Ice-hunting horizon. (7) Bone mouthpiece for the bow drill. This is, of course, lacking in the Dorset culture which had no bow or cord drill. It was present in the Old Bering Sea culture but developed es pecially in the Thule-Punuk stage and was car ried east by the Thule migration. The Tena are one of the few non-Eskimo peoples to have benefited by this invention. (8) Knobs in lamps. We have suggested that these were derived from the spike in Asiatic pricket lamps. They are found in a few lamps of the Pacific Eskimo and Aleut, in the typical Thule lamp, and probably occurred in the proto-Thule lamp (like that made by the mod ern Reindeer Chukchee). The development of these knobs into carved figures was done by the Pacific Eskimo under Northwest Coast influ ence in the Kachemak Bay III period. The lamp with human figure in the bowl, found on the Khotol, was certainly traded from the Eskimo. (9) Longitudinal lines on slender barbed points. These appear first in the Ipiutak and in</page><page sequence="284">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 277 Kachemak Bay I, and seem to have developed as decorative reminders of the undercutting of barbs, as found on Old Bering Sea arrowheads. This feature of Tena art has affiliations pri marily with the Pacific Eskimo and Aleut, among whom slender barbed points are plenti ful. (10) Incised decorations. Tena art as a whole has an old-fashioned Eskimo character. The non-representative elements have their closest analogies in modern northern Alaskan art. This in turn is based upon Thule art, and Thule style is an Arctic Eskimo development of simple units which are not only very ancient among the Eskimo, but which in many cases must be considered as characteristic of Ice hunting decorative style. Tena art must have borrowed much from Eskimo art when Thule and Punuk styles were developing. I cannot believe that there could have been much bor rowing in later times, for in that case Tena style would surely have become infected with the compass-drawn dot-and-circle which is ubiquitous in mature Punuk art. The presence - of pictographic incised elements in prehistoric Tena art also suggests an early contact with nascent Thule style. List 4: Snowshow Culture Traits In addition to the snowshoe itself, moc casins, fringed garments with porcupine quill decorations, smoking of meat and skins, bark cradle, etc., and other items not represented in our archaeological collections, Tena culture contains a number of traits that should be as signed to this horizon. (1) Tipi. This was used by the Tena. In ad dition, the pyramidal roof of the semisubter ranean winter house is a later development from the tipi. (2) Sinew-backed bow with strengthening braces. This apparently entered Alaska from Siberia with the Punuk culture (but may have been earlier). The piece used by the Tena for reinforcing the bow is of Punuk type. (3) Blunt bird arrow. While this may date from the Old Bering Sea, it is typical of the Punuk and modern Alaskan Eskimo. It may have been used by the Alaskan Thule Eskimo. It is known from the Athabaskans, Northwest Coast and California (?) Indians, Chukchee, Koryak, Ainu, Ostyak, Samoyed, Yukaghir, and Finns. (4) Beaver tooth knife. This is probably the prototype of the curved blade of the crooked knife. Tooth knives are used by the Atha baskans, Eyak, Indians of the southern North west Coast and Plateau, but rarely by the Pacific and Bristol Bay-Norton Sound Eskimo. They are ancient and almost universal in the Northeastern Woodlands, and were also used by the ancient Ainu. Elsewhere in Siberia tooth knives have been replaced by the crooked knife with metal blade. (5) Curved knife handle with blade slit in the edge at the end. This is probably the proto type of the handle used with the crooked knife. It appeared in the Punuk-Thule stage and has lasted into modern times among the Bering Strait and northern Alaskan Eskimo. (6) Bark-stripping wedge. It is known from the Kachemak Bay III Eskimo, Athabaskans, Indians of the Northwest Coast and Plateau and by the Eskimo on the Yukon. (7) Bark-stripping knife. This is used by the Ainu, Yukaghir, Bristol Bay-Norton Sound Eskimo, Athabaskans and Indians of the southern Northwest Coast and Plateau. It is probably a trait that developed together with the bark-stripping wedge. (8) Leg bone scraper with transverse edge. It is found in the Thule culture, among the modern Norton Sound-Bristol Bay Eskimo, the Athabaskans, Indians of the Northwest Coast and Plateau, the Plains and the Northeast. The related form, made of a scapula with transverse edge, was not represented in our Tena collec tions, although it is known from the Kachemak Bay II and III, Birnirk (?), and modern Bering Strait Eskimo, etc. (9) Scapulimancy. This was a Snowshoe cul ture trait, although we are not sure that it was practiced by the Tena. (10) Bark or fiber nets. These were made by the Norton Sound-Bristol Bay Eskimo, the Athabaskans, Indians of the Northwest Coast, Plateau and California, by the Koryak, Yuka ghir, Goldi and lower Amur Tungusians, and probably belonged to the Snowshoe culture, but may be older, since they date back to the Mesolithic in Europe. These nets are used with wooden or bark net floats and unworked (sometimes worked) stone weights. The use of bone weights by the Tena, Alaskan Eskimo, Chukchee and Koryak simply reflects the ex tensive use of bone for all purposes among these northern peoples. (11) Folded bark vessels. (12) Birch bark canoe. This is a specializa tion of the open skin boat, coordinate with the</page><page sequence="285">278 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 skin kayak. The partially decked bark canoe of the Tena is probably the original Athabaskan type. List 5: Traits of the Circum Pacific Culture Drift Most of these are of Asiatic origin, though a few developed in the New World. Some of the Asiatic traits traveled directly through southern Eskimo territory to the Tena, others were re worked and elaborated on the Northwest Coast before spreading north. (1) Four-post roof. This probably developed in the New World from a braced tipi. It was used, especially with the semisubterranean house, by the ancient Hohokam, Mogollon (from Pueblo or Hohokam culture?), and by the Basketmaker-Pueblo peoples in the Southwest, by the early Plains Indians, and by Indians in Oregon and on the Plateau. Among the Eskimo, it was used by the Kodiak (?), late Punuk (from the Chukchee), modern Bristol Bay-Ber ing Strait groups, and in modified form ap peared among the Mackenzie Eskimo. From America it apparently passed to the ancient Chukchee, Koryak, Kamchadal, and Gilyak, and was probably used by the prehistoric Ainu. (2) Elevated storehouse or box cache. Origi nally a dwelling, later a summer house, and finally a storehouse, this type of structure traveled up the Pacific coast from southeastern Asia, appearing among the Ainu, Gilyak, Amur tribes, Koryak, Yukaghir, Ostyak, etc. It is now used by the Eskimo from Norton Sound to Bering Strait, and by the Tanaina, Atna, Eyak, Tlingit, and some Plateau tribes. It probably did not last long in southwestern and southeastern Alaska because the large houses there made extra storage space superfluous. (3) Elevated coffin. This is closely related to the elevated storehouse. It is used by the Bris tol Bay and Norton Sound Eskimo (among whom it spread from south to north), by the Athabaskans and Indians of the Northwest Coast and Plateau. In Asia we find it among the Yakut, Yukaghir, Tungus, and other Amur tribes. (4) Coffin set above ground. This is probably only a variant of the elevated coffin, and is found especially in the Bristol Bay and Norton Sound area, and in scattered instances as far north as Point Hope. It also occurs among the Tanaina, Aleut, and northern Northwest Coast tribes. (5) Gravehouse, and dugout used as a coffin. The dugout is lacking among the Tena, al though they sometimes used a bark canoe as a coffin. These are also variants of the elevated coffin, and are found on the Northwest Coast and Plateau, and among the Ainu, Yakut, and Amur River tribes. The dugout of the North west Coast and Prince William Sound Eskimo probably belongs to the circum-Pacific drift (cf. Birket-Smith and de Laguna, 1938, pp. 380, 519). (6) Pole set up by the grave. This is prob ably of New World origin but in any case be longs to the circum-Pacific drift. It is used by the Pacific and Bristol Bay-Norton Sound Eskimo, northern Athabaskans and Algonkians, Indians of the southern Northwest Coast, Pla teau, and Plains, and by the Ainu and Amur River tribes. This record of its distribution is, however, probably not complete. (7) Animal or human images placed at graves. These were probably associated in ori gin with guardian spirits. They are known from the Tungus and Amur tribes, and in the New World are especially developed on the North west Coast. In a simpler form they are used by the Eyak, Athabaskans and Indians of the Plateau, and by the Eskimo of Bristol Bay and Norton Sound. It is difficult to determine how much of their present distribution on this continent was the result of a direct diffusion from Asia and how much was due to a second ary diffusion from the Northwest Coast. These carvings are not to be confused with the small human figures used by the Aleut, although both types may have influenced each other to some extent. The Aleut figures are copied from those of the Ainu and apparently represented origi nally the slaves killed to accompany the dead master. We may consider them as belonging to a later phase or to a special complex of the cir cum-Pacific drift, since they are obviously re lated to slavery and slave-sacrifice. This slavery complex influenced the Aleut-Pacific Eskimo and the Northwest Coast Indians, but not the northern Eskimo or the Tena. (8) Cremation. With the exception of a few very doubtful instances, this practice is un known from the Eskimo. It was common among the Athabaskans, Eyak, tribes of the northern Northwest Coast and part of the Plateau, the Chukchee, Koryak, and Gilyak. It reached Japan together with Buddhism about a.d. 700, and this date may indicate the beginning of the circum-Pacific drift. There</page><page sequence="286">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 279 were, of course, other independent centers of cremation in the New World. (9) Mummification. We are less certain than in the case of cremation that this was practiced by the Tena. It is, in any case, an element of the drift, and is practiced by the Ainu, Aleut Pacific Eskimo and some Northwest Coast Indians. (10) Grass mats for shrouds. These are re ported from the Ainu, Norton Sound-Bristol Bay and Aleut-Pacific Eskimo, and the Tena, but may have a wider distribution. (11) Adz-like hunting or war pick. The adz like double- or single-bladed pick of the Tena, Chugach and northern Northwest Coast In dians represents a specialization which took place on the Northwest Coast, when the primi tive club-pick of the Ice-hunting horizon was transformed under the stimulus of the Asiatic battle-ax and ax-pick on the one hand, and under the influence of the developing North west Coast splitting adz on the other. The Asiatic types in question can be traced back to the war-axes of the Siberian and Chinese Neo lithic. Other Northwest Coast types are co ordinate with the Tena adz-like hunting pick in development but did not spread to the Tena. The hunting pick was later carried back to Japan. (12) Stone saw. This seems to have been carried from the Neolithic of Mongolia and Manchuria to Japan, the Ainu, the Aleut Pacific Eskimo of the Kachemak Bay III hori zon and to the southern Northwest Coast, with extensions onto the Plateau. Other methods for sawing stone used by the Alaskan Eskimo may be older, or may be adapted from the stone saw. There was probably also an independent Mid dle American (?) center for the stone saw, with diffusion to the Southwest and California. (13) Some features found on daggers, espe cially the spirals on the handles of the Atha baskan-Northwest Coast native copper dag gers, are so similar to features on the Ordos bronze daggers as to suggest diffusion from Asia. (14) Paddle-shaped wooden shovel. This im plement is used by the Tena, Chugach and some Athabaskans, and while related to or influenced by the digging stick of the Northwest Coast and Plateau, it is probably of Asiatic origin, since it seems to have reached Japan from southeast ern Asia. (15) High stand for the lamp. This is used by the lower Tena, the Bristol Bay-Norton Sound Eskimo and Koryak, and may be re lated to the hole-and-stick stands of the Ainu. The hole for suspending the hunter's lamp (Aleut, but not Tena) is certainly related to the hole used with the stick-stand on Ainu and Kamchadal lamps. (16) Pottery complex. This involves cooking pots with a situla shape, and smooth surface ornamented with designs of incised dots and lines and applied ribbons and knobs of clay, and has been traced back through Kamchadal Ainu pottery to that of Neolithic Mongolia and Neolithic China. (17) Styles of coiled baskets and trays. Some of the stylistic features of the lower Tena coiled basketry are shared by the Bristol Bay Norton Sound Eskimo, Koryak, Ainu and Kamchadal, and they suggest influences that may have spread with the circum-Pacific cul ture drift. (18) Use of coal for black paint. This is known from the lower Tena, northern North west Coast Indians, and the Koryak. (19) Blue glass beads of the Cook type. These may have been an article of pre-Russian trade from Asia, but we cannot be certain until a comparison of Alaskan specimens has been made with those found on Asiatic sites. Since the Tena lay on the edge of the ter ritory affected by the circum-Pacific drift they failed to get many of the most important and typical traits. (I have already mentioned the stone hand rest for the drill, cf. List 2, Trait 8.) List 6: Northwest Coast Traits From the Northwest Coast and adjacent areas the Tena have derived a number of items. (1) Gable roof with twin ridgepoles. This de veloped on the northern Northwest Coast from two lean-to's built together in Plateau style. The impetus to building the plank house prob ably dates from the circum-Pacific culture drift, and the gable roof with twin ridgepoles is younger than the gable roof with a single ridge pole (Eyak and southern Northwest Coast). The roof with two ridgepoles is built by the Chugach, Tanaina, and possibly by the Bristol Bay-Norton Sound Eskimo (for summer houses). (2) Single-bladed splitting adz with T-shaped handle. This is a relatively recent development on the Northwest Coast from the planing adz. It has been copied by the Pacific Eskimo (late Kachemak Bay III), Eyak, Tanaina, and in</page><page sequence="287">280 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 terior Athabaskans. It has spread only to a slight extent among the Eskimo north of the Alaska Peninsula, so we may assume that it reached the Tena via their inland neighbors. Independent developments of a similar nature have been noted from the American Northeast and Southwest, and from northeastern Asia. (3) Intermediate type adz with elbow handle. This has only a scattered distribution and probably represents the influence of the splitting adz on the planing adz. (4) Stone chisel. The crude stone chisel of the Tena is perhaps related to the stone chisel used by the Chugach, Northwest Coast and some Plateau Indians for woodworking. (5) Painting of utensils. This art has un doubtedly been stimulated by the Northwest Coast. Many of the patterns used by the lower Tena and their Eskimo neighbors are clearly in Northwest Coast style. (6) Wedge-shaped tang for slender barbed points. This is a non-Eskimo feature, but oc curs on weapons of the southern Northwest Coast, modern arrowheads from Bristol Bay and Norton Sound, and on Ainu arrowheads. We may ascribe its occurrence among the southern Eskimo to Northwest Coast influence, though it may be an old feature that was re tained in a few places in spite of the develop ment of the typically Eskimo conical tang. (7) Dentalium shells. These are known to have been traded from the southern Northwest Coast. (8) Imbrication. The simple imbrication or beading found on the rims of birch bark baskets made by the lower Tena suggest the same kind of decoration found on the coiled baskets of the Plateau. (9) Barbed slate blade with tang. This de veloped from the plain slate blade with tang in at least three independent centers: southern Dorset(?)-Northeastern Woodland, Man churia-Korea-Japan, and Pacific Eskimo Northwest Coast. The Tena type is derived from the last area. It may be older than some of the other traits listed here, since it appears in shell heaps of the Kachemak Bay II Eskimo and prehistoric Salish, and has had time to spread to Arctic Alaska, although it is rare in the north. (10) Grinding slab. This is found among the Pacific Eskimo, and tribes of the Plateau and the area south of the Northwest Coast. It is rare among the modern Bering Strait Eskimo. (11) Metal bracelet and ring. The modern iron bracelet and ring of the Tena and their Eskimo neighbors are probably patterned after aboriginal copper ornaments made by the Pa cific Eskimo (in late prehistoric times), the Athabaskans, Eyak, and Northwest Coast Indians. (12) Use of baked clay for red paint. This was practiced by the Kachemak Bay III Es kimo and southern Northwest Coast Indians. It may have had a wider distribution than my information suggests. (13) Red pictographs. The report of such paintings from the upper Tena suggests the pictures of the Pacific Eskimo, one set from Norton Sound, and the numerous examples from the southern Northwest Coast and Pla teau. Of these traits, the gable roof with twin ridgepoles, splitting adz and intermediate type adz, stone chisel (?), painting of implements with Northwest Coast designs, trade in den talium shells, metal bracelet and rings are probably of later origin, or at least appear later in the north. On the other hand, the wedge shaped tang for slender barbed points, imbri cation, barbed slate blade, grinding slab, burn ing of clay for paint, and red pictographs may be earlier. As we have seen, it is impossible to say that the Northwest Coast was the exclusive center of origin for a number of these traits; some of them must be assigned to the North west Coast and southwestern Alaska, and a few seem to be particularly characteristic of the Plateau (imbrication, grinding slab?). In addition, two types were certainly derived from the Pacific Eskimo: (14) Harpoon socket piece in two parts. This is typical of the Pacific Eskimo and dates back to Kachemak Bay I. (15) Lamp with human figure in the bowl. This is peculiar to the Kachemak Bay III cul ture, although we can see in this type the in fluence of the Asiatic knobs in the bowl (List 3, Trait 8), and the influence of the Northwest Coast in the carving, while the decorations in low relief on the side were inspired by Ainu pottery, introduced with the circum-Pacific drift (List 5, Trait 16). List 7: Modern Alaskan Eskimo Traits A number of traits have been copied by the Tena from their Eskimo neighbors, presumably</page><page sequence="288">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 281 in recent times. They may be purely local Eskimo types, or may be shared by most of the modern Alaskan tribes. (1) Small round saucer-shaped pottery lamp. The Tena lamp with a spoked wheel design in the bottom (reminiscent of the medial groove in Aleut-Pacific Eskimo stone lamps) is identi cal with the Norton Sound-Bristol Bay Eskimo lamp. It is, as far as we know, quite modern, although it must be considered as a modified survival of the Old Bering Sea lamp. (2) Mouthpiece for bow drill with stone in set. This is also a Bristol Bay-Norton Sound type, and represents a recent combination of the ordinary bone mouthpiece of the Eskimo (List 3, Trait 7) with the stone hand rest which was probably introduced into southern Alaska by the circum-Pacific culture drift. (3) Netting shuttles. The Tena specimens are identical with those used by the modern Alaskan Eskimo, and seem to represent a proto historic trait introduced from Siberia. It has spread down the coast as far as the Klamath and inland to the Athabaskans adjacent to the Northwest Coast. (4) Net gauge with handle. This is of Si berian origin, adopted by the Bristol Bay-Ber ing Strait Eskimo in protohistoric times and taken over from them by the Tena. (5) The variety of Tena skin dressing tech niques represents a complex formed by adding Kachemak Bay III and Bristol Bay-Norton Sound methods to those of the Snowshoe cul ture. (6) Woman's belt of caribou jaws. This is probably a modern Eskimo type, and is dis tributed from Bristol Bay to Arctic Alaska. (7) Bone buckle with one hole. While like some Ainu specimens, the Tena example is especially similar to modern local Eskimo ones. Of course, buckles, buttons, or toggles in some form are a universal and ancient Eskimo trait (cf. List 1, Trait 28). (8) Wooden boot sole stretcher. This has ob viously been adopted from the local Eskimo along with the Eskimo boot. In fact the ward robe of the Tena shows evidence of wholesale borrowing from the Eskimo, so that we are here dealing only with one item of a skin-dressing and clothing complex. The Tena boot sole stretcher resembles most closely a protohistoric one from St. Lawrence Island, suggesting that the borrowing of this type was recent. On the other hand, the boot sole stretcher may be an old type in Eskimo culture (cf. Aleut? and Greenland specimens) and should perhaps have been mentioned in List 3. (9) Boot sole creaser. This is a specialized implement, independently invented in six teenth century Greenland and modern Alaska, probably as a result of the stimulus given to sewing by the acquisition of metal needles or metal for drilling needle eyes. The awl-like form of the Tena creaser is like that of the modern Alaskan Eskimo from Bristol Bay to the Arctic coast. (10) Bone bag handle. The Tena specimen, though plain, is like the modern Bristol Bay Norton Sound Eskimo types. (11) Finally, we ought to include the whole complex centering around the kashim, since this was taken over by the lower Tena almost in toto from the Eskimo. Only a few elements of the complex have reached the Koyukuk and middle Yukon. This complex includes the use of the kashim as men's club house, guest house for visitors, sweat bath house, and auditorium for masked dances. The masks and other para phernalia for the dances, the occasions on which they are held (chiefly honoring the souls of dead persons or dead animals), and the type of dance performed are almost identical among the lower Tena and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Eskimo. We need mention only such details as the use of the fire-pit as a "stage door," and the burning of an oil lamp in memory of each dead person honored, (de Laguna, 1936 c; Petroff, 1884, p. 130). List 8: Local Traits These are presumably of recent origin. (1) Pyramidal roof for the house. This was perhaps independently invented from the tipi both on the Plateau and on the Yukon. The Tena share this type of roof with the Eskimo of Bristol Bay. (2) Double-bladed splitting adz. This was invented by the Tena (and their nearest Kutchin neighbors ?) from the single-bladed splitting adz which reached them from the Northwest Coast. (3) Eel hook. This is used by the lower Tena and the Yukon Eskimo. (4) Bow with wooden string guard. This is used by the upper Tena, Kutchin, and other Athabaskans. It is received in trade by some of the Northwest Coast tribes, but on the northern coast has yielded ground to the sinew backed bow. The age and place of origin of the bow with wooden guard is uncertain, although</page><page sequence="289">282 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 we can class it as a northwestern Athabaskan type. List 9: Traits of Historic Origin Among the very numerous traits of historic origin among the Tena we need mention only a few. (1) Inhumation under the gravehouse. This is due to a degeneration in the function of the gravehouse. We have noted it among a num ber of tribes, among some of whom it has been brought about by Christian influence, and among others by a possible conflict between the gravehouse and an older practice of in humation. Probably both factors were opera tive among the Tena. (2) The cross, cupola, fret-work ornaments and gable roof of the gravehouse. These were probably introduced by the Russians. The picket fence around the grave may have had the same origin. (3) Set bow. This hunting device is unknown to any North American tribes except the Tena and the Eyak, and was introduced to them by the Russians who were familiar with its use in Siberia. (4) Birch bark box with interlaced side and pegged-in wooden bottom (as well as the in cised design of bands of oblique crosshatching) is of Siberian manufacture, traded in modern times to the Bering Strait-Bristol Bay Eskimo, and by the latter to the Tena. (5) The light built-up sled, of which the Tena made a number of different models, for heavy hauling, quick journeys, trap line visits, etc., and the dog team to pull the sled have been taken over from the local Eskimo. This type of sled is derived from the Siberian rein deer sled, not the simpler runner sled previously used by the Eskimo, and is rather new in Alaska, having been introduced on St. Law rence Island only within the last two hundred years (Collins, 1937 a, p. 340). The Tena did not acquire the sled dog until still later, I be lieve, because a folktale collected at Koyukuk mentions only hand-drawn sleds among the Tena (corroborated by our informant), al though in the story a boy who crosses the ocean lives there with a friendly giant who uses caribou as dogs to draw his sled. This story would indicate that the Tena were familiar with the (Eskimo) use of dogs, although they did not use them themselves, and that they had even heard of Siberian reindeer traction. It would be difficult to make mathematical comparisons between the numbers of traits enumerated in these lists, for the items men tioned are not equivalent in value. These lists can give us little more than a general notion of the relative strength of the influences re sponsible for the building of Tena material cul ture. Moreover, I think that the list of Snow shoe culture traits is really too short, for many possible traits that ought to have been in cluded are embodied in perishable materials, not represented in our collections, and I have not attempted a distribution study of eth nological Tena material items. It will also be noted that a single item of Tena culture may have been listed several times. Thus, the type in its basic form may have belonged to the Ice hunting horizon, and later have undergone several modifications; in this case the basic type and its modifications will all have been listed, each under its appropriate heading. Ob viously, it would be dangerous to attempt to equate these items. ADDITIONAL TRAITS AT "ESKIMO" SITES ON THE YUKON It will be remembered that a number of types were found only at the supposedly Eskimo sites at Fox and Ghost Creek. These have been analyzed in the previous chapter, and for the sake of completeness are enumerated below in lists comparable to those used for the Tena traits. List 1: Later Ice-Hunting Traits (Cf. List 2 in the previous Section.) (1) Bone haft for the adz. While we are not sure that the bone haft for the socketed adz was used by the Tena, a specimen of modern Alaskan type was found at the "Eskimo" site of Fox Creek and is discussed in List 2, Trait 2 of the previous section. (2) Harpoon head with closed socket and two opposed lateral spurs. This may have been used in pairs with a double-foreshaft leister harpoon. It is a Dorset type (with rectangular socket), which has spread (after adopting the round socket) to the modern Central and Greenland Eskimo, and to the Beothuk. The Ainu have both open and closed socketed heads with lateral spurs; the open socketed form is known from the protohistoric Siberian Eskimo and from the Lapp Iron Age. The harpoon heads of the Northwest Coast and Plateau,</page><page sequence="290">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 283 made in two parts, are probably related to the prototype of the one-piece head with two lateral spurs. The specimen found on the Yukon lies on the periphery of the southern area in which these double-spurred heads are common. These heads are associated with the double-foreshaft harpoon, and I would assign both the harpoon and the heads to the ancient North Pacific cultural continuum. (3) Detachable barbed heads: barbed on one side, or barbed asymmetrically on both edges. The center of elaboration of these detachable barbed heads is in the Aleut-Pacific Eskimo area, so that from our point of view they might be classed as North Pacific traits. The head barbed on both edges has a more limited dis tribution than that barbed only on one, and may be more recent. The Fox Creek specimens reflect modern northern Alaskan styles (cf. List 2, Trait 6 in the previous section). (4) Barbed arrowhead with blade. The type in general is ancient, although the particular Yukon form is local and recent. (It is reported from the lower Tena.) List 2: Ancient Eskimo Traits (Cf. List 3 in the previous section). (1) Notch on the slender barbed point. This notch is found on Aleut, Kachemak Bay I and III, and Salish specimens. It appears in an ornamental (degenerate) form on the side prongs for bird darts of the Old Bering Sea, Birnirk, and Punuk cultures, and on Birnirk harpoon heads. (2) Plain detached conical tang for arrow heads. This dates back to the Old Bering Sea culture (where, however, it is rare), and is also found on arrowheads of the Birnirk, Thule, modern northern Alaskan and Prince William Sound Eskimo, and on Ainu and northern Northwest Coast and California In dian specimens. The Yukon tangs have re mained unaffected by the more complicated forms of the conical tang introduced into Alaska by the protohistoric return of the Canadian Thule culture. (3) Ice pick. One of the specimens resembles especially a type found in the Old Bering Sea, Punuk, Thule, and Kachemak Bay I and III cultures. The ice pick itself I have assigned to the Arctic phase of the Ice-hunting horizon (cf. List 1, Trait 22 in the previous section). List 3: Thule Eskimo Traits A few types fall into a classification which I did not suggest in discussing Tena specimens. These are Eskimo types that characterize a Thule horizon in particular, although they may also be shared with other cultures. (1) Bone edging for shovel blades. This originated in the Birnirk, was carried east by the Thule culture into Greenland, but still sur vives at Point Barrow. (2) Small bone mountings. These probably originated in a Birnirk-Thule horizon (perhaps representing a survival of the Ipiutak), are but most highly developed in Greenland. The Yu kon specimens may represent survivals in Alaska from an early period, or they may be due to fresh stimulation from the return of the Canadian Thule culture. (3) Owner's mark. This was developed in the Thule culture from the unsystematic designs on Old Bering Sea arrowheads. They are now char acteristic of modern Alaska, due to the Thule return. The Fox Creek examples resemble more closely the simple northern Alaskan patterns than those which have been so highly developed in the Bristol Bay and Bering Strait areas. (4) Adz haft with holes for lashing to the handle. As mentioned in List 1 of this section, the haft itself is old, but the type with holes for lashing is an Arctic (Thule-Punuk) variant. The particular form found at Fox Creek seems to be the modern northern Alaskan type, rein troduced by the Thule return. List 4: Traits of the Circum-Pacific Culture Drift (Cf. List 5 in the previous section.) (1) Peg-shaped bone arrowhead with blade. The particular type is characteristic of the Aleut-Pacific Eskimo (Kachemak Bay III horizon), the Kamchadal and Ainu. Arrow heads made by the modern Chukchee and by the Bronze Age Chinese seem to be copies of the same basic pattern. Barbless arrowheads with inserted blades in general, however, prob ably date back to the Ice-hunting culture. List 5: Modern Alaskan Eskimo Traits (Cf. List 7 in the previous section.) (1) Detachable barbed head with central line hole and conical tang. These details are modern northern Alaskan traits. The conical tang has been taken over from the arrowhead. On the other hand, the ridge around the tang is local. (2) Arrowheads with flat broad blade-like</page><page sequence="291">284 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 points. This shape is typical of protohistoric and modern Alaskan specimens. (3) Knife-like boot sole creaser. The use of the small bone knife (itself probably an Ice hunting element) as a boot sole creaser is prob ably a recent Alaskan Eskimo adaptation. (4) Ice pick. One type of ice pick at Fox Creek is a local and probably a recent type, THE BUILDING OF ESKIMO CULTURE When I first began to write this book I be lieved that we could assume a basic common Eskimo culture, an ancient ancestral pattern from which all modern Eskimo cultures were derived. This ancient common substratum has never been found, to be sure, and those who have speculated about it have not been in complete agreement with each other about either its form or its place of origin. Archaeo logical discoveries have not offered any solu tion, though they have, of course, given us specific items that must be explained. It was logical to assume that the present diversities in Eskimo cultures were due to the spreading out of the Eskimo across the whole northern rim of the continent and into Siberia, neces sitating local adaptations to coastal and inland environments, to forest, barren ground, open sea and solid sea ice. This involved a total range from 50 degrees north latitude (Newfound land) to over 80 degrees (Ellesmereland and Greenland) at the time of the Eskimo's great est expansion. Some groups lived in almost com plete isolation for a long time; others were in constant contact not only with Eskimo neigh bors, but with foreign peoples, and so were subject to outside influences. These factors might be thought sufficient to have created the differences between present Eskimo groups, and we might even think of these differences as being relatively recent. One had only to go back, therefore, into the past to find the first Eskimo culture, the common foundation from which the present divergent cultures had sprung. This culture ought to have embodied those traits which archaeology has revealed as ancient, and those which ethnology has sug gested as old because they are common to all Eskimo today. Unfortunately, as we go back into the past we find that cultural diversities were perhaps even more striking 2,000 years ago than they are today. The Dorset culture flourished in the eastern Arctic and sub-Arctic, the Old Bering Sea at Bering Strait and vicinity, Kachemak Bay I on the Gulf of Alaska, and on the Arctic shore of Alaska the Birnirk culture was be ginning to emerge from what I believe was a fusion between Old Bering Sea influences and some simple northern Eskimo culture as yet undiscovered. Later, when the Thule culture swept across the Arctic from Alaska to Green land, absorbing and over-riding the Dorset, a much greater cultural uniformity was created than had ever been known before. However, one might still argue, as I had assumed, that by analyzing the similarities between Old Ber ing Sea, Birnirk, Dorset and Kachemak Bay I, it would be possible to gain an insight into the original culture from which these had sprung. A number of traits, as I have shown, were shared by all of these; a number of elements, in spite of differences in form, point back to a common prototype. However, in other cases it was impossible to equate the forms character istic of these cultures. Thus the round pottery lamps of the Old Bering Sea-Birnirk-Punuk group of cultures do not seem to be related to the Kachemak Bay-Dorset oval stone lamps. Although both types of lamps, as lamps, could perhaps be referred back to some ancestral form (cf. Paleolithic lamps) this was not an Eskimo lamp. Within the Eskimo cultures it is impossible to derive either the oval stone lamp from the round pottery lamp, or the lat ter from the former. On the contrary, it seemed as if the two types of lamps had come from dif ferent sources. Yet I did not question that the Eskimo had always had some kind of lamp; it seemed, indeed, more reasonable that the origi nal Eskimo should have possessed both varie ties, rather than neither. The same difficulties apply to many other items of Eskimo culture, though perhaps the problems are less clearly posed than in this instance. The extraordinary discoveries made in 1939 near Point Hope, Alaska, by the joint expedi tion of the Danish National Museum and the University of Alaska have seriously upset our notions of what an ancient Eskimo culture ought to be. Here Rainey and Larsen found, at Ipiutak, a site of square sod and wooden houses with central fireplaces. "Among the most striking features of the Ipiutak culture," read the original announcement, "may be mentioned the absence of slate blades, lamps, and pottery, including numerous new and unusual forms. Of some fifty implement types recognized in the collection, about one-half are characteristi</page><page sequence="292">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 285 cally Eskimo, about one-half are new."10 Al though the "un-Eskimo" character of many of the Ipiutak types has been exaggerated, the culture remains strikingly divergent from "or thodox" Eskimo standards. Is this the original Eskimo culture for which we have all been seeking, or is it only another early Eskimo culture which must be fitted into the solution in spite of its puzzling originality? The particular problems encountered in this study and the challenge presented by the anom alous Ipiutak culture have forced me to re examine the basic assumptions that I formerly held. I now believe that we must think of Eski mo culture in the same way that we think of the Ice-hunting "culture," not as one culture that is or ever was uniform, but rather as a series of more or less similar ways of living that have always exhibited local differences. Furthermore, these local differences must have been greater in earlier times than at present. In other words, these former "Eskimo cultures" were not only less like each other but were even less "Eskimo-like" than those of today. Collins has written:11 Just as the somewhat circumscribed Old Bering Sea cul ture, with its rather numerous local elements, is of con siderably greater antiquity than the much more wide spread Thule culture, it will doubtless be found that other relatively local cultures?but probably of a generalized Eskimo character?formerly existed along the northern coasts of Eurasia before these regions were subjected to the leveling influences of the more mobile inland groups [snow shoe hunters]. He mentions in particular the "old Eskimo like culture" excavated in western Siberia at the mouth of the Ob river.12 Collins is here speak ing about the Ice-hunting stage, but these re marks apply with equal validity to the more specific problem of the Eskimo. For the southern Alaskan Eskimo?espe cially the Aleut-Pacific Eskimo?Birket-Smith has suggested the hypothesis that these people were originally non-Eskimo in physical type, language and culture, and that they became more or less assimilated to the typical Eskimo pattern in these three respects because Eskimo from the north spread over their territory and 10 American Antiquity, V; 3, 1940, p. 233. 11 Collins, 1937 a, p. 382. 12 Op. cit., p. 383. intermingled with them. "... originally in the sub-arctic regions from the Yukon and south wards there has been a population which was different, somatically, linguistically, and cul turally, from the Eskimos, and only in the course of time became Eskimoized."13 While I am unable to subscribe entirely to this par ticular hypothesis in its present form, I believe that it suggests a new and fruitful approach to the whole Eskimo problem, especially when taken in conjunction with the attitude ex pressed by Collins in the passage quoted above. Can we not say that all Eskimos were origi nally in the cultural sense "non-Eskimo," and have "only in the course of time become Eskimoized?" The "Eskimo-like" groups to which Collins refers would represent peoples whose cultures had been only partially molded to that style of pattern we recognize as Eskimo. We must not think of Eskimo culture as having been built up of various layers piled one above another on top of a once-uniform substratum (though, of course, there has been such a piling up of complexes in particular areas). "Eskimo culture" is rather a sort of pattern that has emerged from a number of distinct cultural be ginnings that have grown more and more alike. Perhaps all that these beginnings shared in common were a certain proportion of the ele ments of the diffuse and varied Ice-hunting horizon. I have already suggested that the greatest dichotomy lay between the western Arctic group (represented by the Old Bering Sea-Birnirk-Thule-Punuk group) and the an cient North Pacific group with which the Dor set in the eastern Arctic was mysteriously linked. Many cultural complexes have reached these various Eskimo groups from a number of sources, at first enriching only the particular group which received them, later spreading to other "Eskimo" groups as well. The Old Bering Sea, the Dorset, the Kachemak Bay I, and the Ipiutak cultures represent, therefore, only four different approaches to "Eskimo culture." No single modern Eskimo tribe of today can be said to have a culture that is completely "Eskimo"; no single group in the past can be hailed as the original Eskimo; no one restricted area claimed as the home of Eskimo culture. 13 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, p. 229; cf., 1936, pp. 180 f.</page><page sequence="293">APPENDIX ANALYSIS OF YUKON POTSHERDS Donald Horton FIFTY-FIVE sherds from sites in the Yukon Valley, and five sherds from Birnirk culture sites at Point Barrow excavated by Van Valin and Hopson, were subjected to a limited tech nological analysis, consisting of a microscopic study of clays and inclusions, analyses of quan tity and size of mineral inclusions, and retiring of sherd fragments. No chemical analyses were made. Mineral inclusions were identified only in thin section. The general objectives of the study could be attained without calling on all the available refinements of the analytical method. The main task was considered to be a recon struction of the pottery-making techniques, and corollary to this, to show how, if at all, the sherds differed from one site to the next. The sample of sixty sherds, selected as typical from several hundred, was on the whole satisfactory for these aims, although there was a necessary variation in the number of sherds from each site. In some cases, the small size of the sherds made it impossible to section more than one or two. In other cases, an adequate sample of six to twelve sherds was available. Since the valid ity of conclusions drawn from technical study depends significantly on the sampling, an itemized sampling list is given below to make clear the statistical basis of our work.

Barrow (PI. XXVII, 3) bears a catalogue number?1350?which is completely erroneous. Although the sherd is very similar to the Birnirk material, and is ac companied by a label which reads "Pt. Barrow," doubt must be cast on its provenience. F. de L.] DESCRIPTION OF YUKON SHERDS Because of the fundamental similarity of the Yukon sherds, it is possible to give the results of our study in the form of a comprehensive description of the whole series (55 sherds). Color.?Where sherds have been partially oxidized, the oxidized portion is usually one surface and about half of the underlying fabric. The unoxidized remainder of the fabric and the opposite surface are generally of one color. It is not necessary, therefore, to distinguish between fabric colors and surface colors. One hundred seventy-three colors (Ridgway) were recorded. The range is from 13" (Orange Cinnamon) to 19'"" (shades of gray) and black. The typical colors are 17"" (Drab), 32 per cent of colors observed; 17'" (Wood Brown), 11 per cent; 18"", 9 per cent. The characteristic grayness of the colors is shown by the fact that 6 per cent are 5 prime hues; 66 per cent, 4 prime; 17 per cent, 3 prime; and only 10 per cent, 2 prime. The latter are the few oxidized surfaces, typically 13" and 14". Refired color.?On retiring half an hour at 1000?C. in an oxidizing atmosphere, vitrifica tion began to develop in many of the sherds, so the colors obtained may not be regarded as the maximum oxidation colors. They range from 9'm (Carob Brown) to 17"'k (Olive Brown). The typical refired color of the more refractory clays is 13" (Orange-Cinnamon), 41 per cent of the sample. Hardness.?Range: 2-5. Average: 3.4. The average is probably high because scratching tests made on surfaces which were greasy or soaked with pitch were difficult to interpret. Thickness.?Range: 5 mm to 23 mm. Average: 10 mm. Strength.?No tests made. Most of the sherds are weak enough to be broken easily in the hand. Fracture.?The fracture is irregular, "blocky." The clay of the fabric is not uniform in texture; there is a noticeable lumpiness due in part to the inclusion of weathered and soft rock frag 286</page><page sequence="294">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 287 ments which break with the clay, and in part to an original lumpiness of the clay itself. The characteristic fracture is shown in the photo graphs (Plate XXVII, 1, 2). There is occasional lateral fracture or spalling parallel to the sur faces as shown in Plate XXVIII. Surface Finish.?There is no slip or wash. All of the sherds are undecorated. The surfaces are generally irregular in contour, though some what smoothed. None are polished. The smoothing instrument occasionally left faint parallel striations. The best smoothed surfaces have shallow shrinkage cracks (these may be seen by close examination of Plate XXVII, 2). The nonplastic inclusions are slightly exposed on many of the surfaces. The outer surfaces (as indicated by the general profile of the sherds) are better smoothed and it is these which show partial oxidation. The inner sur faces are generally coated with a crust of car bonized material up to 1 mm in thickness. This is frequently a black, resinous material with glossy luster, which burns strongly with thick black smoke. A sherd with comparatively rough surface, from Bonasila, is shown in Plate XXVII, 1. The sherd with smoothed sur face (PL XXVII, 2) is from Anvik Point, and is more typical of the Yukon sherds. Inclusions.?Feather temper is found in a ma jority of the sherds. Most of the feathers have been carbonized, but clear impressions have been left in the sherd fabrics. Plate XXVIII shows such a feather impression in a sherd from Kateel. The feathers vary in size and quantity. Presumably they vary in kind, but no attempt has been made to determine the species of birds from which they were obtained. Feather temper is apparently lacking in sherds from Anvik Point and in one or two from Bonasila. Grass and hair, which have been mentioned as tempering materials in adjacent areas,1 were not observed in our sherds. Mineral inclusions vary in character and quantity according to the site. They are best identified in thin section, because of the general darkening of the fabrics and inclusions. Quartz and feldspar grains are the least obscure in the hand specimens. The most prominent mineral inclusions are fragments of basalt, microlitic and trachytic effusive rocks, obscurely devitrified glass, tuff fragments (PL XXIX, 2), diabase, plagioclase 1 Collins, 1937 a, p. 167. feldspars which are frequently phenocrysts with traces of devitrified glass selvages (PL XXX, 1), quartz, chert, quartzite, shale, bi otite, calcite, calcitic sandstone, orthoclase, occasional ferromagnesian minerals, and clay concretions. These inclusions, especially the effusive rock fractures, are so varied in character that it would not be profitable to describe them. A careful comparative study showed that the assemblage of rocks and minerals is slightly dif ferent for each site. A characteristic of these associations is that the feldspars are mostly fresh, while the igneous fragments are altered to a greater or less extent. The feldspars are mostly oligoclase at the upriver sites?Tanana, Kateel, and Kaltag?but predominantly an desine further south. On retiring, the devitrified igneous materials in several sherds from Bonasila became com pletely fused and formed globules of slag. Clays.?The sherds from each site differ in re fractoriness and refired color. Vitrification ac companied by slight bloating occurred in sherds from eight of the sites (Kateel, Kaltag, Lower Kaltag, Old Fish Camp, Blackburn Slough, New Grayling, Bonasila, Hall's Rapids). Under the microscope, several of the fabrics appear to be bentonitic. Although none of these clays shows a refractive index under that of balsam, they contain an abundance of more or less altered tuff fragments of low index. Plate XXX, 2 shows a small portion of the matrix of such a sherd from Kaltag, photo graphed in ordinary light at a magnification of about 360 diameters. In many of the sherds, especially from the upriver sites, the groundmass contains an abundance of silt of unusual character. The grains are of nearly uniform size and rounded to subround in shape. They show the typical brush extinction of spherulites. Although they may be fragments of chert, in which such spherulitic structures frequently occur, identi cal spherulites were observed in rock fractures of undoubtedly effusive character in several sherds. The spherulites are thought to be de rived from devitrified lava. The fine white particles which form the groundmass in the photomicrograph, Plate XXX, 1, are spheru lites of this sort. Texture.?Those textural features due to the presence of feather temper are chiefly a slight lamination of the fabric, and, in transverse section, porosity due to feather quills. The tex</page><page sequence="295">288 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 tures are in the main a function of the larger mineral inclusions. The average volume of mineral inclusions is 27 per cent. Range: 13 per cent to 36 per cent. Average grading: (Shepard's Scale) Very Fine and Fine 14 per cent Medium 8 per cent Coarse 3 per cent Very Coarse 2 per cent Maximum grain size: occasional grains of gravel size (up to 6 mm). Volume of visible inclusions: Average 13 per cent. Range: 9 per cent to 21 per cent. The sherds are characteris tically sparsely tempered. Analyzed according to site, sherds from 7 sites are moderately tempered (15 per cent to 30 per cent visible inclusions) and from 8 sites sparsely tempered (less than 15 per cent visible inclusions). It must be remembered, of course, that these fig ures do not take into account the feather tem per, which it is impossible to measure micro scopically by the thin section method. If the feathers are taken into account, it is safe to say that all of the sherds should be classed as moderately or even abundantly tempered. The emphasis of the grading is on grains of medium size. The scattering of coarse and very coarse grains contributes to the irregularity of the texture. Shape of grains: The felspars are typically angular and subangular (cf. PL XXX, 1). A few are rounded. These were evidently rounded as phenocrysts rather than by abrasion or weathering, since some well-rounded grains were observed which still retained margins of the microlitic matrix in which they occurred. The igneous rock fragments are typically sub angular to rounded. DESCRIPTION OF POINT BARROW SHERDS2 Color.?Range: 13"'m (Bone Brown) to 21"" (Grayish Black). Typical: 17""m (Chaetura Black) Refired Color.?Range: 7' to 13". No character istic color was developed in this small sample. Slight vitrification was evident. Hardness.?Range: 3.5 to 4.5. Average: 3.9. Thickness.?Range: 14 mm to 19 mm. Aver age: 17 mm. In certain sherds which were not included in the sample for analysis there is a striking variation in thickness; in one sherd a variation from 12 mm to 30 mm. 2 These include one sherd of doubtful provenience. Strength.?The sherds are weak. Some tend to crumble or flake off in the hand. Fracture.?Characteristically laminated or scaly (cf. PL XXVII, 4). Surface finish.?There is no evidence of slip, wash, or decoration. Unflaked surfaces show evidence of smoothing. Mineral inclusions gen erally protrude slightly (cf. PL XXVII, 4). Inclusions:?There are faint traces of a sub ordinate amount of feather temper in a major ity of the sherds. The mineral inclusions are predominantly chert, shale, quartz, quartzite, and obscure fine-grained material of sedi mentary or effusive origin. Clays.?The clays are obscured by dark color and presence of carbon. None are clearly ben tonitic, although, as noted above, they have a tendency to slight vitrification on retiring to 1,000? C. Texture.?One sherd (PL XXVII, 3) must be considered separately because of its extraor dinarily coarse texture.3 The grains of chert and quartz with which it is tempered are subangular or subrounded and have an average diameter of 4 mm. (pebble size), and a maximum diameter of 10 mm. It was not feasible to measure the volume of these inclusions in thin section. Measurements made on the surface of the sherd gave the approximate volume of visible inclu sions as 20 per cent. Of the other four sherds (PL XXVII, 4) three were analyzed. The average volume of inclu sions is 30 per cent (moderately to abundantly tempered). Grading: Fine 6 per cent Medium 9 per cent Coarse 13 per cent Very Coarse 1 per cent The grains are subangular with corners rounded to subrounded. Plate XXIX, 1 is a photomicrograph of a sherd of this group taken with low magnifica tion to show the shapes of inclusions, relative grain size, and the opaque carbonized matrix. The inclusions shown here are grains of chert. DISCUSSION The clays and mineral inclusions of the Yu kon and Point Barrow sherds vary with the site, evidently reflecting differences in local geological conditions. We are led to the con 3 This sherd is of uncertain provenience and age.</page><page sequence="296">de laguna] PREHISTORY OF NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA 289 elusion that the pottery was manufactured locally at each village. There is no evidence of trade in pottery between villages nor is there any evidence of ceramic intrusions from areas which lack the characteristic assemblage of minerals and rock types found in the sediments of the Yukon drainage system. The sherds were examined for evidence of coil or ring construction, but no indications of the method of construction were observed. A few sherds showed spalling, or cleavage, which may be evidence that the vessels were modeled. Since spalling may just as well be attributed to expansion due to rapid firing and entrapped steam, this conclusion is hardly justifiable on a purely technological basis. It is known, how ever, that the modeling technique was practiced in the area. In addition to feathers, which are clearly a tempering material, some sand is present in all the sherds. In most cases it is difficult to decide whether the sand was added as additional tem per or whether it occurred naturally in the clay. Those which contain the fewest very coarse and coarse grains (Kateel, Kaltag, Hall's Rapids and New Grayling) may have contained sand of fine and moderate grades originally. The others contain from one per cent to five per cent of very coarse grains such as one would hardly expect to find in a natural clay. Whether natural in the clay or added by the potters, the mineral grains are evidently de rived from uncrushed river sediments. The feld spars are angular or subangular, but the softer rock fragments are typically subrounded or round and these frequently show signs of weathering. According to the statements of Dr. de La guna's informants,4 feathers were added, but only one mentions adding sand. (He also men tions the addition of bears' hair. No hair temper was observed in our sherds.) One informant specifically mentions finding clay and sand al ready mixed. On the other hand, we found, in examining a sample of blue clay from Nulato, which according to Dr. de Laguna was used for pottery making, that this clay contains only the finest silt and none of our sherd fabrics begins to approximate it in fineness of texture. It seems quite likely that the potters of Nulato must have added sand to their clay, and it is our opinion that this was the method of preparing 4 See p. 141. the paste at least at Old Fish Camp, Blackburn Slough, Bonasila, Anvik, and Frank Fox's place. Experimentation with clays from the Yukon might show whether or not the feather temper played any real ceramic role, but we have not been able to undertake this work. The addition of organic material is generally supposed to increase the porosity of the ware and thus aid the escape of steam and other gases. But the Yukon sherds seem to be weakened rather than strengthened by the included feathers, which seem to increase the tendency of the fabrics to split or flake off parallel to the surface. The addition of grease, mentioned by Mrs. Albers, or fish oil, mentioned by Knox's mother-in-law, may have added to the plas ticity of the paste and would certainly have contributed by carbonization to the darkening of the fabrics. Although the sample of Point Barrow sherds is so small that comparisons must be made with reservations, the analysis gives the impression of a different pottery technique. The average thickness of Point Barrow sherds is 17 mm, which is only slightly less than the maximum thickness measured on the Yukon sherds. Traces of feather temper are present, but the predominant temper is coarse sand and gravel which is clearly an artificial admixture. The texture is fairly uniform and extremely coarse. The tempering material was evidently selected with some care and added in standardized quan tities. Very little oxidation is evident. All of the Point Barrow sherds were fired under strongly reducing conditions. Two sherds from Bonasila, one of which is shown in Plate XXVII, 1, are somewhat simi lar to the Point Barrow sherds in quantity of inclusions, coarseness of texture and completely dark fabric. A sample of consolidated gravel or con glomerate obtained at Point Barrow contains grains of .coarse sand and gravel identical with those used in tempering the Point Barrow pot tery. They are lightly cemented in a fine sandy matrix. The potters evidently removed the coarse sand and gravel particles from the ma trix before adding them to the paste. Our analysis of the Point Barrow sherds cor responds in a number of particulars with the description of St. Lawrence Island sherds given by Collins,5 especially with respect to their 5 Collins, 1937 a, loc. cit. We cannot agree with Collins (p. 167) that the dark color of the sherds is due to an original</page><page sequence="297">290 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 3 extraordinary thickness (.5 cm to 2.7 cm), crumbly or flaky texture, black color, coarse sand and gravel temper ("particles up to the size of a kidney bean"). The fine grass temper described by Collins does not occur in our sherds. black clay, little fired. Dr. de Laguna's informants, for instance, refer to blue and white clays used in pot making, although the Yukon sherds are generally dark if not black on at least one side and part of the core. Blackening is here due undoubtedly to firing in a smoky reducing atmosphere and perhaps to the addition of blood or grease (which seems to have been a characteristic trait of the pot-making technique in this area). The slight oxidation of the sur faces mentioned by Collins may be produced by exposure of the pot to the atmosphere before it has cooled or by accidental drafts during the firing or even possibly by sub sequent exposure to an oxidizing atmosphere in the cooking fire. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The analysis was carried out as part of the work of the Ceramic Laboratory of the Uni versity Museum, W.P.A. Project 14753. All of the Project workers took some part in the task. Special acknowledgment is due Mr. Joseph Berman who identified the mineral inclusions in thin section. The laboratory apparatus used by the Proj ect was obtained through the kindness and co operation of Dr. Edward Watson, Chairman of the Department of Geology of Bryn Mawr College, and Dr. Frederick E. Ehrenfeld and Mr. A. W. Postel of the Department of Geology of the University of Pennsylvania. The photomicrographs were made by Mr. Reuben Goldberg, photographer of The Uni versity Museum.</page><page sequence="298">BIBLIOGRAPHY List of Abbreviations in Bibliography AA American Anthropologist, published by the American Anthropological Association AAA-M Memoirs of the American Anthropological Asso ciation A Ant American Antiquity, published by the Society for American Archaeology AAR Annual Archaeological Report, Appendix to the Report of the Minister of Education, Toronto AMNH American Museum of Natural History, New York City -AP Anthropological Papers -B Bulletin -GLS Guide Leaflet Series -HS Handbook Series -MJ Memoirs, Jesup North Pacific Expedition Ant Antiquity, Gloucester, England AST-J Journal of the Anthropological Society of Tokyo BAE Bureau of American Ethnology, Washington, D.
