<plain_text><page sequence="1">SIGNIFICANT POINTS OF COMPARISON BETWEEN THE BIBLICAL CRITICISM OF THOMAS AND MATTHEW ARNOLD By Eugene L. Williamson, Jr. THIS PAPER had its origin in three main considerations: (1) my observation of the many references to Thomas Arnold's ideas and works in Matthew Arnold's familiar correspond? ence; (2) my recognition of many striking paral? lels in the Biblical criticism of the two men; and (3) my gradual realization that the great wealth of scholarship about the Arnolds contained no de? tailed attempt to indicate the precise nature of Matthew's indebtedness to his father's ideas about the Bible. The unlikeliness of any unique indebtedness is, of course, patent when one con? siders the wide diffusion of liberal religious ideas in mid-nineteenth-century England and, more particularly, when he remembers Matthew's ex? pressions of interest on various occasions in the work of Spinoza, John Smith (the Cambridge Platonist), S. T. Coleridge, C. C. J. Bunsen, Renan, Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, and Benjamin Jowett.1 Nevertheless, the inherent probability of at least a contributory influence, a predisposition to accept similar ideas from other sources, ap? peared to justify a comparative study of the criticism of the Arnolds. This criticism is best understood as an attempt to avert a great danger which both father and son perceived. Both were struck by the inade- quacy of contemporary Anglican religious apologetic faced, as it was, by the rationalism of continental Biblical scholars and historians and the materialism fostered by the proliferation of the sciences at home and abroad. By the last quarter of the eighteenth century, German orientalists and classical scholars had begun to point out internal inconsistencies in the Scrip? tures which seemed to suggest that they were no more free from error than any other ancient work. From about 1800, German critical his? torians subjected the alleged fulfillments of Biblical prophecy to tests which indicated that some "prophecies" were interpolations made by pious hands after the fact. From about 1830, ad- vances in geological investigation and theory sug? gested that natural processes followed a course incompatible with Biblical accounts of the Crea? tion. Finally, during the first forty years of the century, progress in the sciences of biology, medicine, and physics engendered such a respect for the idea of natural "laws" that the evidence for miraculous suspensions of these "laws" was subjected to much closer scrutiny than previ- ously.2 One result was a revolution in men's attitudes toward the Bible. So conservative was British clerical opinion, however, that as late as 1841 Connop Thirlwall could observe that there was not a single English theological journal which did not "studiously keep its readers in the dark as to everything that [was] said and done in German theology."3 Again, John Henry Newman's well-known re- mark that Dr. Arnold was perhaps not a Chris? tian was provoked by Arnold's having made critical inquires into certain books of the Old Testament.4 On the whole, the attitude of the English clergy tended to be one of "hostility to changes which nothing could prevent."5 To the Arnolds this extreme conservatism seemed dangerous in a time when it appeared that apologists would be unable to retain the loyalty of the masses as they gradually became aware of the findings of the scientists and scholars. Between 1825 and 1842, the elder Arnold be? came increasingly alarmed by the work of Ger? man "higher critics" of the Bible whose writings in his judgment betrayed the lack of balance in their lives and philosophies.6 He was almost 1 William Robbins, The Ethical Idealism of Matthew Arnold (London, 1959), Ch. iii, "Major Formative Influences," pp. 55-70.

These are supplemented by essays in the EnglishmanJs Register (1831), a preface on the study of theology, and a note on "atheism" in Sermons, volume in (1834), and notes on "rationalism" and "inspiration" in Christian Life, Its Course, Its Hindrances and Its Helps (1841). These works were principally devoted to the accomplishment ot two main purposes: (1) the forcible assertion that the Bible was not his? torically discredited because it was sometimes erroneous and, in the technical sense, unin- spired; and (2) the demonstration that the pri? mary value of the Bible was really independent of critical and scientific considerations. Matthew Arnold's major writings about the Bible amply reflect the views of his father. One can find many striking aspects of St. Paul and Protestantism, Literature and Dogma, God and the Bible, and Last Essays on Church and Religion which lend force to Matthew's poignant remark to Arthur Stanley that Dr. Arnold's death in 1842 cut off the "sole source of information" of his family.8 Over thirty years later, he wrote to the son of Dr. Arnold's closest friend in words of equal poignancy: "How delightful for your father to have lived to see your great success in your . . . profession."9 Along with the many appreciative references to the elder Arnold's work in Matthew Arnold's letters, the parallels suggest that Matthew greatly profited from the example before him of a man who, in the words of Basil Willey, "com- bined the deepest religious convictions with an accessibility to the light of modern ideas . . . rare indeed in English clergymen of his day."10 Certainly Matthew was appreciative of the historical acumen which the elder Arnold manifested in his notes to an edition of Thucy- dides (1830-35), his History of Rome (1838-42), and his Oxford Introductory Lectures on Modern History (1842), and brought to bear on the prob? lems of Biblical interpretation. Some five years before the decade which Matthew devoted to writings about religion, he suggested that his father's great contribution to English religion was in "bringing such a torrent of freshness [to it] by placing history and politics in connection with it."11 A few years later, he observed that the elder Arnold's "historic sense" saved him from the provinciality of other English clergymen of his day and enabled him to become "wonder- fully . . . European" (Works, xiv, 189). No doubt Matthew's projected account of the "impulse which [Thomas Arnold] gave to the life and thought of the generation which felt his influence" (Works, xiv, 200) would have in? cluded a description of Dr. Arnold's work as a Biblical interpreter, for the son stated elsewhere that his father (along with S. T. Coleridge) ministered to the spirit of the age in "the explod- ing of the old notions of literal interpretation in Scripture, and the introducing of a truer method of interpretation" (Works, xiv, 210). That Matthew believed further advocacy of this "truer method" to be necessary may be seen by six aspects of his religious criticism which mark it as the full development of principles sug? gested by Dr. Arnold: (1) rejection of the idea of plenary Biblical inspiration; (2) emphasis on the ethical rather than the metaphysical significance of the Bible; (3) validation of religious doctrines by the teachings of Christ; (4) reference to ex? perience (the "experiential test") as demonstra- tion of the efncacy of Christian teachings; (5) distrust of anthropomorphic conceptions of God's nature; and (6) considered employment of humanistic learning in Biblical interpretation. Although, as we have said, there is no reason to suppose that Matthew was uniquely indebted to his father for these principles, we do know that Dr. Arnold's sermons in which the teachings were prominently set forth were to Matthew, "the most delightful and satisfactory to read of all his writings."12 At the very least, therefore, it would appear that Matthew's willingness later to accept the same ideas from other sources was fostered by Dr. Arnold's work.

The rejection of the doctrine of the plenary inspiration of the Bible was a major feature of the elder Arnold's criticism. He explicitly stated his opinion as early as 1829 in a letter to the his- torian Henry Hart Milman: "It is a mere want of Faith which impotently longs for the assur- ance of an imagined inspiration, and cannot be satisfied with the moral probability which exists in a human narrative when supported by the ordinary laws of evidence."13 Again in his essay "On the Right Interpretation and Understand- ing of the Scriptures" (1832), Dr. Arnold main? tained the historical truth of the Biblical books at the same time that he admitted that their inspiration in the technical sense was question- able: It is only the inspiration of the books of the Scripture, and not their general truth, and far less the truth of the revelations recorded in them, that is, or can be, affected by the great majority of objections, critical, scientific, historical, and chronological, which have been brought at different times against various parts of the Bible. By the eagerness with which they have been urged and repelled, one would imagine that our Christian faith depended upon their issue, whereas in fact it has been wholly unconcerned in the dispute.14 Matthew Arnold's attitude on the same point may be illustrated briefly from Literature and Dogma: recognition of the liability of the New Testament writers to make mistakes, both of fact and argument, will certainly, as we have said, more and more gain strength and spread wider and wider. The futility of their mode of demonstration from prophecy . . . will be more and more felt. The fallibility of that demon? stration from miracles to which they and all about them attached such preponderating weight, which made the disciples of Jesus believe in him, will be more and more recognized. (Works, vn, 141) From comparison of the criticism of both men we can see that Matthew also shared the convic- tion of Dr. Arnold that the ethical rather than the metaphysical significance of the Bible was to be emphasized by the interpreter. In a sermon published in 1834 the elder Arnold expressed his view as follows: "O that we would know and re- member to search the Scriptures, not for truths, but for lessons; not for doctrines to be used al? ways and by all persons, as eternally and uni- versally true; but for medicines fitted to our own particular want" (Sermons, in, 356). Indeed, Dr. Arnold defined the word "doc? trine" itself not as "truth" but as "efficacy as a means of moral good." From his Biblical studies he concluded that the scriptural idea of doctrine involved a "mixture of direct precept with the revelation of facts or characters calculated to produce a certain moral effect."15 Significantly, his discussion of the apparently inexplicable pas? sages of Scripture turns on the ability of the interpreter to "know what to do with a passage, what lesson [he] ought to learn from it."16 In the preface to God and the Bible, Matthew wrote approvingly of his father's suspicions of "formal and technical" metaphysical specula? tions by theologians: "Dr. Arnold, who had a sound historical instinct, could tell at once, from the warnings of this instinct, that theology, which is a series of conclusions upon the history in the Bible, had apprehended that history all wrong; that it was faulty, therefore, in its very base, and so could not be a true theology, a science of the Christian religion, at all" {Works, viii, xxvii). Matthew's agreement with his father's view that the Bible's chief value was that of a guide to conduct is patent in the following paragraph from Literature and Dogma: A system of theological notions about personality, essence, existence, consubstantiality, is artificial reli? gion, and is the proper opposite to revealed; since it is a religion which comes forth in no one's consciousness, but is invented by theologians .... The religion of the Bible . . . is well said to be revealed, because the great natural truth that urighteousness tendeth to life," is seized and exhibited there with such incomparable force and efficacy. (Works, vn, 50-51) For both men, the crown of the Biblical ethic was to be found in the personality and teachings of Jesus. The elder Arnold was intent that Christ "as set forth to us fully in the Scriptures" be put at the center of religion.17 Observing that most men had a tendency to some particular "idol," fanaticism, or superstition in religious matters, Dr. Arnold urged the testing of religious opinions 13 Frances J.

He suggested that in comparison to the worship of Christ, attachment to estimable but lesser ob? jects such as truth, justice, charity, and benevo- lence would be recognized as spiritually inade- quate.18 For this reason, he found particular com- fort in the fact that all surviving teachings of Jesus were available in the "one small volume of the four Gospels." From these might be gathered a "full specimen" of Christ's teachings.19 He further observed that from close attention to the "direct practical precepts" of Jesus as expressed in the parables and the Sermon on the Mount, Christians might expect to clear up the confu- sions which had arisen because of doctrines "supposed to be deduced by a fair process of reasoning from certain expressions in the Scrip? tures."20 Matthew Arnold's view can be seen in the following evaluation of the logia of Jesus: "how admirably fitted are Jesus Christ and his pre? cepts to serve as mankind's standing reminder as to conduct,?to serve as men's religion. Jesus Christ and his precepts are found to hit the moral experience of mankind, to hit it in the critical points, to hit it lastingly; and when doubts are thrown on their really hitting it, then to come out stronger than ever" (Works, ix, 189- 190). Yet another significant point of comparison between the Biblical criticism of the Arnolds is the appeal by both to experience (the "experi- ential test") as demonstration of the efficacy of Christian teachings. Dr. Arnold wrote of "an ex- perimental knowledge of [their] power and living truth" (Sermons, n, 379). In other words, he urged the trial of the truth of the main teachings of Scripture in everyday life as a means of "possessing the earnest of the Spirit" (Sermons, ii, 426). On another occasion he expressed his confidence that such a trial would lead to an in? creasing ability to apply Biblical teachings to the whole range of human experience.21 He observed that if the existence of God were assumed as an instrumental concept, experience would "con- vince us every day more and more that we as? sumed its truth justly" (Sermons, in, 208). Matthew Arnold's employment of the same form of persuasion is apparent in the following passage from Literature and Dogma: "if on the other hand, they ask: 'How are we to verify that there rules an enduring Power, not ourselves, which makes forrighteousness,??we may answer at once: . . . by experience! It is so; try it!" (Works, vn, 325). Again, Matthew had some precedent in his father's work for his distrust of anthropomorphic conceptions of God's nature. Thomas Arnold had clearly warned against "pushing too far our no? tion of God's personality." According to Dr. Arnold, the danger was that men might be in- fluenced by their own impressions of human personality when thinking of God and thus might be led into error about God's will for them. For this reason, the elder Arnold maintained that one ought not to think of God in human terms and should not "inquire into the relations of the Divine nature except toward its own works" (Sermons, iii, 403). Although he disapproved of "pantheistic doctrines" such as the idea of "a constitution of things favouring virtue, and dis- couraging vice, and requiring men, as parts of the great whole to act in conformity with it, and to support its tendencies," he did recognize that such doctrines were merely, as he put it, "the strong recoil of anthropomorphism" (Sermons, iii, 397-398). Matthew Arnold's more extreme views can be seen in his celebrated definitions of God in Literature and Dogma and in God and the Bible: the Eternal, not ourselves, that makes for righteousness. (Works, vin, 26) the stream of tendency by which all things fulfil the law of their being . . . (Works, vn, 42) Especially in the second definition, Matthew op? posed religious anthropomorphism with an ap- proximation to the "pantheistic doctrines" re- pudiated by Dr. Arnold. Finally, the Arnolds were alike in their in- sistence on humanistic learning as a requisite to sound Biblical interpretation. The elder Ar? nold was convinced that he who would make clear the teachings of the Bible must necessar? ily possess the historical tact required to dis? tinguish the essential from the accidental in Scripture. Since Dr. Arnold believed that few British clergymen had the culture needed prop- erly to perform their function as Biblical in- terpreters, he urged that less time in clerical education be given to controversial theology and more to exegesis and humanistic studies. His advice to prospective theologians was that they should study not only the Scriptures and the philological and antiquarian works required 18 Christian Life . . .

Williamson, Jr. 543 to interpret them but also the master pro? ductions of secular literature. The latter were to prevent interpreters from "viewing the Scrip? tures themselves through the medium of ignor? ance and prejudice, and lowering them through . . . perverse interpretations." Thucydides, Plato, Cicero, and Aristotle were to be studied as a "means of keeping the mind fresh and com- prehensive." In addition, Dr. Arnold recom- mended a thorough knowledge of history as a source of political wisdom and as another means "to arrive at the truth as it is in Christ." Such an education would be required, he thought, to provide the culture needed to understand "pro- found and difficult writer(s)."22 By means of such training the "wary handling Scripture calls for" would be possible and the errors consequent to any "single or partial view of it" could be avoided (Sermons, ni, 355-356). Matthew Arnold's opinions were in much the same vein. In Literature and Dogma he proffered as the best means of assuring sound Biblical interpretation, cidture, "the acquainting our? selves with the best that has been known and said in the world, and thus with the history of the human spirit": To understand that the language of the Bible is fluid, passing, and literary, not rigid, fixed, and scientific, is the first step toward a right understanding of the Bible. But to take this very first step, some experience of how men have thought and expressed themselves, and some flexibility of spirit, are necessary; and this is culture. (Works, vn, xii, xiv) In the preface to his final work of religious criticism, Last Essays, Matthew Arnold gave utterance to the conviction which most surely marks him as the intellectual heir and creative disciple of his father: "I am persuaded that the transformation of religion, which is essential for its perpetuance, can be accomplished only by carrying the qualities of flexibility, perceptive- ness, and judgment, which are the best fruits of letters, to whole classes of the community which now know next to nothing of them, and by pro- curing the application of those qualities to matters where they are never applied now" (Works, ix, 174). These words epitomize the "attempt con- servative and attempt religious" comprised by St. Paul and Protestantism, Literature and Dogma, God and the Bible, and Last Essays. The greater genius and literary gifts of Matthew should not prevent us from seeing that to a considerable de? gree, this attempt was an outgrowth of Dr. Arnold's teachings. Although we are unable to state with certainty that Matthew was uniquely "influenced" by his father on any given point, the overwhelming probability is that either by direct borrowing, or by predisposition to accept similar ideas from other sources, the son was strongly indebted to Dr. Arnold, who, according to Matthew, not only found his own way but "carried so many others with him . . . and saved them, if they would let him, along with himself" (Works, xin, 56).
