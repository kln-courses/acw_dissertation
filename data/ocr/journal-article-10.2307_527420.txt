The Analysis of Gen. 12:6-17:27.$1| [The subjects treated in this section are,--(1) Abram in Canaan; (2) his sojourn in Egypt; (3) separation from Lot; (4) war with Chedorlaomer and meeting with Melchizedek; (5) his vision and the prediction of the Egyptian bondage; (6) birth of Ishmael; (7) the solemn covenant accompanied by circum- cision.] A. The Element of P. i. VERSES ASSIGNED TO P. 13:6 (K. and S., 6b = J), llb-12a; 16 :1 (K. and S., lb = J), 3, 15sq. (Kitt., 16:la = J; Well., Del., 16:1 = J); 17:1-27 [;7*t, in v. 1, for 090 8 = R]. 2. SYNOPSIS OF CONTENTS. "Abram and Lot settle together in Canaan; but the land is too small for their possessions. Hence they separate; Abram remaining in Canaan, Lot dwelling in the 'cities of the plain."' [Here belongs 19:29, in which P mentions, in passing, that, at the destruction of these cities, God saved Lot for Abraham's sake.] "Ten years later, Sarai, being childless, gives Hagar, her Egyptian slave, to Abram for a wife. A year afterwards, a son is born, whom Abram names Ishmael. Thirteen years later, God makes a covenant with Abram, promising that he shall become the ' father of a multitude of nations,' on account of which he is named Abraham. (Sarai also is changed to Sarah.) The promise is to be fulfilled through Isaac. Ishmael also is to be great, begetting twelve princes, and becoming a great nation. This covenant is to find expression, on Abraham's part, in the rite of circumcision, which is to be perpetuated among his seed forever. Accordingly, Abraham circumcises himself, Ishmael, and all the male servants of his household.'' * THE ALLEGED FACTS AND CONSIDERATIONS OF THE PENTATEUCHAL ANALYSIS PRE- SENTED AND CRITICIZED BY Profes0ors Harper (of Yale) and Green (of Princeton). ? The answer to certain criticisms made and certain positions taken by Professor Green in the April number, will be reserved until all the historical matter has been considered. $ This article will be continued in the October HEBRAICA. Professor Green's reply will appear in the January (1890) HEBRAICA. 11 In the work of collecting and classifying the facts of the analysis, I desire to acknowledge my very great indebtedness to the assistance rendered me by Mr. Samuel Weyler, New Haven, Conn. ?

(1) Just as (a) the story of creation led up to the announcement of the Sabbath, and (b) the story of the deluge culminated in a covenant with Noah and the law of bloodshed, so (c) this section brings us to the covenant with Abraham, and the institution of circumcision. [The entire story, including "Sodom's destruction," is told in seven and a half verses, while nearly the whole of ch. 17 (at least 20 verses) is given to the covenant and circumcision.] (2) This covenant is the third of a series; and P's systematic arrangement becomes further apparent, in that (a) the Sabbath is simply made holy; bloodshed is forbidden, and the rainbow appears only as a sign of the covenant (7 J"P y t1, t), while circumcision is more strongly emphasized, being per se the cove- nant ('n9"? 7  , 17:10, and )Y71f53 r1'73 rr') , 17:13); still further, in that (b) the Sabbath, as an institution, is dismissed with but half a verse, 2:3a; bloodshed (omitting 9:4, the blood of animals, and the account of the rainbow, closely connected with the covenant) takes two verses, 9:5,6; but circumcision (purely the law) occupies five verses, 17:10-14. (3) The dates are consistent and consecutive, 12:4b; 16:3,16; 17:1,17,24,25. * That is, words which have already been cited in connection with chs. 1-12: 5; see HErBRAICA, Oct., '88, p. 64; also pp. 22-3, 32-3, 43-4, and 52-3. t In all these cases, God reveals himself by this name, or the patriarchs speak of such a revelation. The presentations are consistent with, or conform to, Ex. 6:3.</page><page sequence="3">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 245 2) Chronological and statistical, as seen in (1) his mentioning the exact age of Abram with every event, 12:4b; 16:16; 17:1,24; (2) giving the age of others besides Abram; (a) Sarai's, 17:17, (b) Ishmael's, 17: 25; (3) naming the date in 16: 3. [Note that all these dates are consistent and consecutive.] 3) Generic. (1) Abram arrives in the "land of Canaan " [cf. J = 0D)J "iy 'IVl 0)@] 12:5; (2) Abram and Lot have "great possessions" [cf. J: "Abram was laden with cattle, silver and gold;"' "and also Lot ....had sheep, oxen and tents"] 13:6; (3) Abram dwells in the "land of Canaan," a very indefinite desig- nation [cf. J = '! thy)], 13:12. 4) Rigid and stereotyped, as seen (1) in the expressions (a) 090 'l'r7, 17:7,8; (b) Jl1' 1fl~ , 17 : 7, 13,19; (c) 9h? f7J 1', 17 : 7,8,9,10; (d) 9')' ". 93, 17:2,7,10,11; (e) tfl 0190 O j? , 17:23,26.

He then moves to the mountains, and builds another altar. Now a quarrel arises between the herdmen of Abram and Lot (who accompanied him, as recorded in 12:4a), and so Abram proposes a friendly separation. Accordingly, Lot chooses the 'fertile plain of the Jordan,' becoming a neighbor of the wicked Sodomites; while Abram settles among 'Mamnre's oaks.' But a famine compels Abram to go to Egypt. Here Sarai's extraordinary beauty becomes a source of anxiety to Abram, lest the Egyptians kill him. They represent themselves as brother and sister; and Sarai is taken to Pharaoh's harem. But Yahweh sends plagues upon the king and his household. Pharaoh thus discovers that she is married, and so he restores her to Abram, and sends them away in peace. After that, Yahweh appears to Abram in a vision, repeats the promise (often made before), that Abram's descendants are to be as 'innumerable as the stars.' A covenant is made by passing through the pieces of bisected victims. But Sarai, still childless, recommends Hagar, her handmaid, to Abram, in the hope that children may thus be raised up. Hagar, at the prospect of raising up an heir- sole heir, in fact--to Abram, naturally becomes elated, and begins to treat her mistress slightingly. Sarai punishes her so severely that she runs away. But an angel orders her back, at the same time promising her a son, whom she is to call Ishmael." 3. THE LANGUAGE OF J. 1) OLD WORDS. 2) NEW WORDS.

(1) No particular system; while the covenant between Yahweh and Abram is recorded, it is neither the climax, nor the all- important fact of the narrative. It is connected with no institution; and the promise made then, is only one of many repeatedly made by Yahweh, in his familiar intercourse with the patriarchs. (2) On the other hand, though his stories are quite independent, the transition from one to another is smooth and easy. 2) It abounds in story and tradition. (1) Cause of separation between Abram and Lot (13:7sq.); (2) episode of Sarai in Egypt (12:10-20); (3) trouble between Sarai and Hagar (16:4-6); (4) Hagar's meeting with the angel (16:7-12). 3) It is vivid, poetic and dramatic, in (1) the abundance of brief conversations, as (a) between Abram and Sarai (12:11b-13); (b) Pharaoh and Abram (12:18,19); (c) Abram and Lot (13:8,9); (d) Sarai and Abram in giving Hagar [in this case the contrast is very marked between P and J. The former tells the fact, "And Sarai took Hiagar," etc.; the latter brings out the fact through a family conference between husband and wife (cf. 16:2 with 16:3); the difference being the same as between an annalist and a novelist]; (e) Sarai's report of Hagar's misbehavior, and Abram's reply (16: 5,6); (2) the fact that these conversations are marked as much by artistic skill as by deep insight into human nature; e. g., (a) the way in which Abram approaches a disagreeable subject: "Behold, I know that thou art a fair woman," etc. (12:11); (b) the way in which he dismisses Lot: "Let there be no strife between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we are brethren. Is not the whole land before thee ? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me," etc. (13:8,9); (c) the pathos of Sarai's words: "Behold now, Yahweh hath restrained me from bearing; go in, I pray thee, to my handmaid; it may be that I shall be builded by her;" (d) the natural pride of Hagar at the prospect of becoming the mother of Abram's heir; (e) the prompt and emphatic charge made by Sarai to her husband; (3) the beautiful touches of description: (a) the way in which an Asiatic monarch treats a fair woman (12 : 15),-she is noticed, praised, taken; (b) the description of the fertility of the "plain of Jordan," "like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt" (13:10); (c) the description of the * These are in so far characteristic of JE, that they cannot go with P, any more than a law- yer's digest should use Miltonic expressions.</page><page sequence="6">248 HEBRAICA. future " child of the desert," "he shall be a wild-ass of a man ! " (16:12); (d) we almost see the slaughtered animals when we read, " and the birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and Abram drove them away" (15:11). 4) It is anthropomorphic. (1) Yahweh appears often and familiarly (12:7; 13:14; 15:1-4 and 17); (2) Pharaoh's plagues come directly from Yahweh (12:17); (3) Yahweh's angel (it would scarcely be proper, from a human point of view, that Yahweh himself should appear to a slave) holds a long conversation with Hagar even; (4) in Hagar's mind at least, there seems to be no distinction between an angel and Yahweh himself (see 16:13, t Og? $1 9 (1); (5) the covenant is made by Yahweh's passing between the victims (in the same way as men made a treaty; cf. 21: 27-30); (6) Yahwehl is seen in the form of a burning flame (15:17); ef. Ex. 3:2, "the burning bush." 5) It abounds in historical and geographical references. (1) "The Canaanite was then in the land" (12:6); (2) " having Bethel on the west "and Ai oi the east" (12:8); (3) "the Canaanite and Perizzite dwelt then in the land" (13:7); (4) "the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners" (13:13); (5) "as thou goest to Zoar" (13:10); (6) "by the fountain in the way to Shur" (16:7); (7) "it is between Kadesh and Bered" (16:14); (8) the origin of the name 8'1 'fl (16:14). 6) It is individual rather than generic. (1) Abram arrives not in Canaan, but at the particular "place of Shechem ;" (2) the location of his tents are exactly described; (3) Lot pitches his tent toward Sodom; (4) Abram's address is "Mamre's oaks;" (5) the covenant is made, not simply "' on that very day," but "when the sun went down, and it was dark" (15:17); (6) the promised land is bounded by the river of Egypt and Euphrates (15:18); (7) the angel finds Hagar at a particular fountain (16:7).* 5. MATERIAL OF P AND JE.+ This may be considered under three heads: 1) Repetition, or duplicate accounts. (1) Both P and J tell of Abram's arrival in Canaan (P = 12:5b; J = 12:6); (2) both mention Lot as going with Abram (J = 12:4a; P = 12:5a); (3) according to both they subsequently separate (J= 13:lla; P = 13:llb); (4) according to both, God appears to Abram, after the separation, and makes a covenant with him (J = 15:1,9-11,17sq.; P = 17:1-4,10); (5) both relate HIagar's union with Abram, and Ishmael's birth (P = 16:1,3,15; J = 16:1),2,4,11); (6) both record God's promise to Abram for multitudinous pos- terity, and through Isaac (J -= 12:2; 15:4sq.; P = 17:2b,6,19). * All these, from another point of view, indicate vividness of description. ? For the sake of convenience and brevity, the "material" and the "theology" of both P and J (or JE) are presented together. ? Incorporated by R with P. ? While there is some doubt whether these verses are J or E, for the purpose in hand it does not matter, since we are comparing the priestly vs. the prophetic.</page><page sequence="7">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 249 2) Differences in presentation of material. (1) The language and style, both of which have been considered in detail elsewhere; (2) P does not know of any fam- ily quarrels; e. g., Abram and Lot separate for lack of room simply [cf. 36:7, where, according to the same writer, Jacob and Esau also separate merely for lack of land]: and Sarai has no difficulty whatever with THegar; but J, on the other hand, is evidently interested in the "domestic differences " of the patriarchs; (3) P says nothing about Sarai's connection with a foreign court, while the pro- phetic writers give two such accounts, possibly three (12:10-20; 20; and also 26:6-12, where Rebekah is, perhaps, only substituted for Sarai, or, if this is the original, Sarai is but a different and expanded version of Rebekah, see Well., p. 320 and note); (4) P locates Abram in j7-f fl N; J, in   ' ji; (5) Lot settles, according to P, in ppi t' ; but according to J, in 17-', -D ; (6) P, consistently, makes Abram, the father, name Ishmael (16:15); J, as usual, leaves it with the mother (16:11); (7) P makes rnmuch of circumcision, J omits it entirely. 3) Inconsistencies. Not only do there seem to be two accounts, and these to be differently presented; but they are inconsistent, one with the other. The story of Abram's visit to Egypt (12:10-20), besides other considerations,-such as (1) the fact that it is a story; (2) its diction; (3) its fluent style (all of which bear the imprint of J),-is (4) inconsistent with P's dates; this will appear from the fol- lowing considerations: ch. 12:4b makes Abram 75 years of age when leaving Haran (or, which is the same, on entering Canaan), and 17:17 tells us that Sarai was ten years younger than Abram; the journey to Egypt took place after their settling in Canaan (probably after Lot had left them, since he is lost sight of in the Egyptian story*), that is, when Sarai was over 65 years old; that a woman at such an age, however attractive, could so charm the Egyptian court as to endan- ger her husband's life, is inconceivable. Sarai died at the age of 127. She would therefore be past middle life; but it must be remembered that longevity does not distribute itself equally to all periods of life; it is rather an addition at the end. It is further to be noted that at the age of 90 she is described (18:11,12) as exceedingly old; and the giving birth to a son at this age is understood to be miraculous. 6. THEOLOGY OF P AND J. 1) (1) According to P's representation, God is exalted far beyond man's reach, as seen in the fact that (a) God appears only on most important occasions, when he is about to make a covenant; (b) even then he emphasizes his almightiness, ty 'f 93; (c) when he appears "Abram falls on his face" (17:3,16); (d) the covenant consists only in words, a promise and a command: God is present, but * The last clause in 13:1 is probably to be assigned to R. If it were original, Lot would most naturally come after ifti .</page><page sequence="8">250 HEBRAICA. not visible. (2) J, on the other hand, represents Yahweh as familiar with and near to man; e. g., (a) he appears, in person or through an angel, quite fre- quently; (b) he punishes Pharaoh, " for Sarai's sake" (12:17), personally; (c) he sends his angel to restore Hagar to her mistress; (d) to ratify the covenant, Yahweh "passes through the victims" as a "smoking furnace and flame of fire" (15:17). 2) (1) P, persistently and consistently, mentions neither altar nor offering, even at the making of a covenant, while (2) J tells of many altars built (12:7,8; 13:18), and specifies the victims slaughtered for the covenant. 3) (1) The great central thought in P's story, to which all the rest is subor- dinate and introductory, is the institution of circumcision, God's covenant being imprinted on the very flesh of his chosen one and his seed. (2) From J we would never know of circumcision as an institution; and so far as this particular writer* is concerned, even its existence as a custom would seem to date from Moses' day; cf. Ex. 4:25. See Well., p. 340 and note. C. Chapter 14 (= E ?). 1.

The Elamite, accompanied by three other kings, marches against the rebels, among whom are the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah. The latter are utterly routed and their pos- sessions carried off as booty by the victorious party. They carry off also Lot and his goods. A fugitive brings the news to 'Abram, the Hebrew,' who immediately arms 318 of his trained men, and with the aid of three allied chieftains, pursues the conquerors, and rescues, not only his relative, but also the people of Sodom and their property. On his return, Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of the 'most high God', brings forth bread and wine, and blesses the Hebrew hero, who reverently gives him a tithe of everything. The offer of the king of Sodom that Abram should retain the restored goods and return only the people, is magnani- mously and proudly rejected by the patriarch, who accepts only a portion for the men who were his confederates." * J, as distinct from E; the latter has some reference to circumcision in Jos. 5:2, etc. + No critic claims 14, as it stands and entirely, for E.

MATERIAL. 1) Strange phenomena. (1) The chapter presupposes 13:11,12, in that it mentions Lot as dwelling in Sodom (v. 12), but gives no impression of Sodom's wickedness, related in 13:13, or in chs. 18, 19. (2) Abram, so much afraid of being killed by the Egyptians, according to 12:12, appears here as a hero who risks his life for a nephew-not his wife-and conquers the combined forces of four mighty kings. (3) It describes Abram as "the Hebrew," as if he had never been heard of before; the appellation itself, a strange one. (4) The same applies, though with less force, to Mamre being described as the Amorite. (5) It contains * The few doubtful verses in 15 may be disregarded for critical consideration. t All these points are so obvious as to require no illustration.</page><page sequence="10">252 HEBRAICA. many glosses by a later hand; as (a) 7137 89 (vs. 2, 8); (b) 7 1 D' 'h1 (v. 3); (c) i'fi..

(6) It refers to Jerusalem (D f in v. 18 = O',yV1'), priest, tithes, and priestly blessing, thus presupposing, at least, Deuteronomy. (7) The names of nations, in vs. 5-7, coincide with those in Deut. 2:10-12,20. (8) 7"j, $3@8 and K7 , used elsewhere as names of places, appear here as names of people. (9) There is not the slightest allusion to the strange story here told, in anything that follows it. 2) Inferences. (1) It must be from a late hald, probably = R, who was acquainted with all accounts and vocabularies. (2) The original source of the legend cannot be determined dogmatically, since the characteristics are not deci- sive. Hence critics differ widely, as indicated on p. 250 and note; some laying more stress on one set of facts; others, on another. Remarks. (1) At first sight, this chapter is strongly against the analysis, since critics differ so radically as to its source. (2) But are there not as many difficulties in the way of the view which makes it a part of a complete narrative ? With the exception perhaps of (6) and (7), none of the difficulties enumerated above under 5. 1), p. 251 sq., can be satisfactorily answered. (3) The whole story is so isolated from what precedes and follows, that it can be left out of account entirely without interfering with our inquiry. (4) From another stand-point, it only confirms the critics' position as to the "liberties of R." 6. THEOLOGY. 1) It glorifies Jerusalem and its priesthood, and justifies the latter's claim to tithes. 2) It has some peculiar titles for the deity. 3) Otherwise, there is nothing decisive, except it be pIp in v. 22.

MATERIAL.* 1) Remarks. (1) P has but little material in this section, practically nothing but the transaction of the "cave of Machpelah;" 19:29 (the parenthetical state- ment about Sodom's destruction) really belongs to the preceding section; while the account of Isaac's birth has been considerably modified by R, 21:1-5. (2) The principal narrative (ch. 23) is very unique, the other documents knowing nothing about it. Hence, neither comparison nor contrast is possible. That it is P, has been shown clearly under "Language " and "Style." (3) The few verses in 21, which are unmistakably P, fall in very naturally with ch. 17. Isaac was promised (17:16,19), Isaac is accordingly born. And, of course, P will tell us about the child's circumcision and the father's age (21:2-5). 2) The following points, though strictly belonging to the last section, must be noticed here, because the comparison with J could not have been satisfactorily made before taking up the latter's material: Notice, then, (1) as compared with J, we find the following duplicates in the promise of Isaac : (a) according to both, God appears to announce Isaac's birth (P=17:16,19; J=18:1-14); (b)the announcement is received with laughter (P = 17:17a; J = 18:12); (c) the incredulity is due to Abraham's and Sarah's extreme age (P = 17:17b; J = 18:11,12); (d) according to both, Isaac is to be born just a year after promise (P = 17:21b; J = 18:10,14). (2) As compared with J, we find the following duplicates in the story of Sodom's destruction. The single v. 29 of ch. 19 contains (a) the fact that the "cities of the plain" were destroyed (= J in 19:24,25), and (b) the rescue of Lot (= J in 19: 16-23); (3) there are also the following differences in the announcement of Isaac: (a) according to P, it is Abraham who laughs (17:17a) (which probably accounts for naming the child Isaac (17:19), the whole presentation being consistent with P, who invariably makes the father name the child); while in J it is Sarah who laughs; (b) according to P, Abraham is too old to beget a child (17:17); while from J it would seem that Sarah's age was foremost in mind and the difficulty in the case (18:11b,12b,13b). (4) As to Lot's deliverance, we must note, (a) according to J, he is saved for his own goodness (cf. the whole story about his hospitality; but especially 18:16, I y , ~f' l )h T); while P says it is for Abraham's sake (18:29); (b) according to J, Lot is sent away before the destruction begins (so the whole presentation, but particularly 18:22-24); but P tells us he was sent out "from the midst of the catastrophe " (18:29). (5) As compared with E, ch. 20 is incompatible with Sarah's age, as given in 17:17 [cf. (4) under 3), p. 249, last section; the remarks made there are applicable here, but with greater force, since there Sarah was only 65 years, while here she is 90].t * Hereafter, the material will be considered (1) under P, where the priestly narrative will be compared with JE, and (2) under E, where E will be contrasted with J. It will not then be necessary to discuss "material" under J. t A consideration of ch. 20, in the light of J's account in 18:11,12, will be found, under E's "Material."</page><page sequence="13">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 255 3) It has already been indicated that the various accounts about Isaac's birth, given in 21:1-7, while clearly composite in character, have as yet found no satisfac- tory analysis. The difficulty is an insignificant one. 6. THEOLOGY.* 1) Here again, the small amount of material in this section compels us to draw our comparisons from previous sources. 2) The announcement of Isaac is made by God, according to P, in a formal revelation (17:19). Cf. with this J's extreme anthropomorphism (18:1-15). 3) According to P, God destroys the cities directly; according to J, he uses natural means, "sulphur and fire," which probably means volcanic action and lightning. 4) P remembers to tell us about Isaac's circumcision; JE, as usual, knows nothing of such an institution [cf. 3) (2), p. 250]. 5) The whole story of Abraham's purchasing a burial place, is P's way of making the patriarch legally hold property in the "land of Canaan," and it is only this writer who takes care to gather Sarah, Abraham, Isaac, Rebekah, Leah and Jacob into it [cf. 25:9; 49:29-32; 50:13]. The other writers do not refer to it. B. Element of J. 1.

SYNOPSIS. "Yahweh and two angels appear, in the form of three men, to Abraham at 'Mamre's oaks.' He receives them very hospitably. Yahweh, as spokesman of the guests, announces that when the season revives, Sarah shall have a son. Sarah, overhearing this remark behind the door, laughs at the idea that at her extreme age, Abraham also being old, she should become a mother. Yahweh takes her to task for doubting his promise. She, abashed, says, 'I did not laugh;' but Yahweh insists that she did laugh. Then the guests depart, and, as Abraham accompanies them, Yahweh tells him confidentially of the fate that awaits Sodom. Abraham pleads for the doomed city, reminding Yahweh that there may be some good people in it for whose sake the entire place ought to be pardoned. He begins with the possibility of fifty just men; but as Yahweh listens to his * This heading also will be treated hereafter in the same way as "Material" (cf. note at the bottom of the preceding page).</page><page sequence="14">256 HEBRAICA. pleading he comes down to ten; and even for that number Yahweh promises to save Sodom. Yahweh then departs, and Abraham returns home. Meanwhile, the two angels (who started for Sodom when Yahweh and Abraham began their earnest conversation) arrive at the city gate, where Lot receives them politely and invites them to spend the night with him. With some reluctance, they accept his offer, and enter his house. Before they retire, the Sodomites surround the house, and vigorously demand of Lot the surrender of the strangers. Lot steps out to them, locking the door behind him; he begs the mob to respect the right of hospitality, offering even his two innocent daughters to be treated by the rabble at its pleasure, provided they do not disturb his guests. But the blood- thirsty crowd, accusing him of continually playing the judge, rush forward to break in the door. At this point, the angels interfere: they take Lot into the house, close the door, and smite the crowd with blindness. They then instruct Lot to remove all his near relatives from the city; but his sons-in-law laugh at his fears. And so, at daybreak, the angels urge him to take his wife and two daughters and flee for his life to the mountain. Lot prefers to run to Zoar; is granted also this. He reaches this place of refuge, just as the sun appears above the horizon. Yahweh causes brimstone and fire to rain over the doomed cities, and they are utterly destroyed. Lot's wife casts a glance backward-which was forbidden-and becomes petrified. But Lot is afraid to remain even in Zoar; so he hides himself in a cave with his two daughters. These, thinking that the whole world perished in the destruction, decide to perpetuate the race by inter- course with their father, whom they bring, for two successive nights under the influence of wine, and thus accomplish their end. This explains the origin of Moab (from the elder daughter) and Ammon (from the younger). A year after, Isaac is born; and Abraham praises God. Just then, Abraham learns that his brother Nahor (whom he had left in Mesopotamia) has raised up quite a family, among others, Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel, the youngest son of eight." 3.

(1) Study the picture of hospitality presented in Abraham's treatment of his guests: (a) he runs to meet them, 18:2; (b) he entreats them (hJ- g), as a personal favor to him ('I~) jl tin g NJ DN), not to pass by him, 18:3; (c) they are asked to recline under a tree, 18:5; (d) he makes them feel that they will not be a burden to him, "I will fetch a morsel of bread to stay your hearts," while intending to make a banquet; (e) he prepares the meal with all possible speed, "Abraham hastens to Sarah, and tells her to make ready quickly. He runs to the herd.... and his servant makes haste to dress the calf," 18:6,7; (f) everything is done from a full hand; Sarah is to take three seahs (= 75 -- lbs.) of fine flour (no three men, or even angels, could consume so much in one meal); "he takes a whole calf," 18:6b,7b; (g) he waits on them in person, 18:8b. (2) Abraham's plea for doomed Sodom is terribly earnest: (a) he appeals to God's justice: "Wilt thou destroy the righteous with the wicked ?" "Shall not the Judge of all the world do right ?" (vs. 23,25); (b) he humbles himself now that he is asking a favor (which is in touching contrast to his customary famil- iarity with Yahweh). (c) But as his request is granted, he persists till he comes down to ten. (3) We have a most graphic description of a mob: The entire popu- lation of Sodom, young and old, surround Lot's house; they cry out to him, "Where are the men who have come to thee to-night ? bring them out to us, that we may abuse them," etc. (4) Not less picturesque is the rescue of Lot's family by the angels. (5) Note the master - touch in vs. 27,28: Abraham returns to the spot where he entreated God's mercy, and seriously surveys the plain; but he sees it is all turned into smoke. 4) Stories. The entire section is a collection of stories: (1) angels' visit to Abraham; (2) attitude of Sodomites towards strangers; (3) Lot rescued; (4) the fate of his wife; (5) Lot's daughters in the cave. 5) Anthropomorphism. (1) God and two angels pay Abraham a visit; (2) they all look like ordinary men; (3) they eat a dinner; (4) Yahweh disputes with Sarah about her laughing: she says "I did not;" he insists "You did;" (5) Abraham's bargaining for Sodom; (6) Yahweh cannot conceal anything from Abraham, since the latter is to become great, 19:17,18; (7) Yahweh goes down to Sodom to inspect its condition, 18:21; (8) human-like action of the angels in</page><page sequence="17">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 259 Sodom; (9) Lot and his family are instructed "not to look back," and his wife actually loses her life for so doing, because Yahweh does not wish man to see His operations (cf. 2:21). 6) Religious instruction (= prophecy).

SYNOPSIS. "........ From there Abraham moves to the South Land, and takes up his abode in Gerar. He introduces Sarah as a sister, and King Abimelech takes her to his court. God informs the king, in a dream, that she is a married woman, and commands him to restore her to her husband, who is a prophet and will pray for him. Abimelech sends for Abraham, and reproaches him for his act of decep- tion. Abraham offers, as an excuse, self-defense, and also the fact that Sarah is a half-sister of his. Abimelech not only restores Sarah, but gives handsome presents to Abraham, and invites him to make his home wherever he pleases. At the prayer of Abraham, Abimelech and his household are restored. [At Isaac's birth] Sarah says, God has made her a laughing-stock; all who hear (of her giving birth to a child) will laugh. (This probably suggested the name Isaac.) When the child is weaned, Abraham makes a great feast. Ishmael makes sport; at Sarah's request, Abraham banishes the boy and his mother. He is promised, however, that while Isaac shall be his seed, Ishmael will become a nation. The mother, with the child in her arms, wanders in the desert of Beer-sheba; the water fails. In despair, she drops him beside a shrub and sits at a distance because she cannot see him die. An angel calls encouragingly; God points out to her a well of water. She relieves his thirst and he lives. God watches over the boy; he becomes a great hunter, dwells in the wilderness of Paran and marries a wife from Egypt. "Abimelech seeks an alliance with Abraham; the latter reproves the former because of a certain well which had been violently taken away. After a denial on</page><page sequence="18">260 HEBRAICA. the part of Abimelech, the covenant is entered into. The place is called Beer- sheba, the well of the oath. Abimelech then returns to Philistia. "God commands Abraham to sacrifice Isaac, his only son, on a mountain in Moriah. Abraham immediately sets out, and reaches the place within three days. The altar being prepared, and Isaac bound, he proceeds to offer him as a sacrifice. But an angel calls down from heaven and informs him that it was only a trial of his faith. Abraham then espies a ram caught by its horns in a bush; this he offers up instead of his son. He, with his attendants, returns to Beer-sheba." 3.

STYLE. Before taking up in detail the characteristics of E's style, the following anticipatory remarks deserve notice: (1) Being prophetic, we may expect him to be in the main like J; (2) with P, however, he has almost nothing in cornm- * J and E, both being prophetic, have a great deal in common in vocabulary as well as in style. Hence many words hitherto considered as J, are really JE, and may be called here OLD, though E, as such, appears here for the first time. + See J, this section. $ See under "special characteristics" of this author, following page. ? Cf. J using 8fl-Dt quite frequently.</page><page sequence="19">THE PENTATEUTJCHAL QUESTION. 261 mon; his use of D** is only apparently like P, for E continues to use this term for deity throughout his narrative, while P would use Ofi even in Genesis, were it not for the question of consistency with his statement in 6:3; (3) the prophetic traits are often more intensely exhibited in E than in J; (4) this writer's material is fragmentary, as we find it, there being no complete or contin- uous story,-a fact due, in large part, to the similarity of his material to that of J, the two being easily blended, or one substituted for the other: (5) the follow- ing special characteristics have been noted and may be stated in general terms by way of introduction: (a) the exclusive use of 090 8; (b) the occasional use of the plural form of the verb with the name of God (cf. 20:12; 35:7); (c) the fre- quent occurrence of dreams, especially as revelations from God (cf. 20:3,6: 28:12; 81:10,11,24; 87:5-8,9,10; 40:9-11,16,17; 41:1-7); (d) frequent reference to angels, as God's representatives, "calling down from heaven" (21:17; 22:11); (e) repetition of proper names in calling (cf. 22:11; Ex. 3:4); (f) statements respecting three days' journey (cf. 22:4; Ex. 3:18; 8:23; 15:22; Num. 18:33); (g) references to the existence of "strange gods" in the families of the patriarchs (cf. 31:19,24; 85:4; Josh. 24:2); (h) the special interest exhibited in places and traditions of northern as over against southern Israel. 1) He is interested in geography and archeology.t (1) Abraham dwells between Kadesh and Shur, 20:1. (2) Hagar wanders in the desert of Beer-sheba, 21:14. (3) Ishmael makes his abode in the desert of Paran, 21:21. (4) His wife is from Egypt, 21:21. (5) Origin of the name "Beer-sheba," 21:31. 2) He is vivid and descriptive,t as seen (1) in his method of presenting mate- rial by means of conversation: (a) God and Abimlech, 20:3-7, in which four points are indirectly brought out; (a) details of the way in which Abimelech came to take Sarah, 20:5; (p) the testimony of God himself to Abimelech's inno- cence, 20:6; (y) the representation of Abraham as a prophet, 20:7a; (() God's threat that he will avenge Abraham, if his wife is not returned, 20:3b,7b. (b) Abimelech and Abraham, 20:9-13, informing us of (a) Abraham's motive, v. 11; (p) why she was called sister rather than something else, v. 12; (7) their standing agreement as to the mode of deception, v. 13. (c) Abimelech and Abraham's alli- ance, 21:22-30, disclosing (a) Abraham's prosperity, v. 22b; (p) that Abimelech's servants, without his knowledge, robbed Abraham of a well, vs. 25,26. (d) Minor talk: (a) Abimelech's offers to Abraham and Sarah, 20:15,16; (p) Sarah asking Abraham to banish Hagar and her son, 21:10; (7) God's instruction on this point, 21:12; (6) Angel to Hagar, 21:17b,18; (e) God directing to sacrifice Isaac, 22:2; (C) Abraham leaving his servants behind, 22:5; (ii) Isaac and Abraham in refer- ence to the victim, 22:7,8; (0) angel to Abraham, 22:12. (2) In the use of circum- stantial clauses: (a) "for she is a man's wife," 20:3; (b) "having done deeds unto * See p. 265, and of. p. 22 (No. 1 of this vol.). t It will be noticed that these headings are the same as under J.</page><page sequence="20">262 HEBRAICA. me tihat ought not to be done," 20:9b; (c) "putting it on her shoulder, etc.," 21: 14; (d) "since neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, etc.," 21:26b; (e) " while I and the boy, etc.," 22:5; (f) "seeing thou hast not withheld, etc.," 22:12; (g) "caught in the thicket by its horns," 22:13. 3) He is highly dramatic. (1) In not telling us all the facts at once, but keep- ing us in suspense till the denouement is fully developed, as seen (a) in omitting any motive or reason for Abraham's action in calling Sarah a sister (20:2a), that it may all be explained later (cf. vs. 11,13) ; (b) in not assigning any reason for Abime- lech's taking Sarah to his court, the reader being allowed to infer, from v. llb, that her beauty must have been so great as to endanger her husband's life; (c) in withholding the result of Abraham's trial till we reach v. 12. (2) In working up toward a climax; note (a) in the story of Hagar's banishment (21:14-17), how our sympathies are more and more enlisted: she starts out with scanty provisions, and the child upon her shoulder; she is lost in the desert; the water fails; the unfortunate mother drops the child, and flees from the spot, that she may not see his dying agonies; but just as she breaks out in despairing tears, the angel's voice calls out from heaven; (b) in offering up Isaac, how gradually the reality of the transaction grows upon one: Abraham starts out on a journey with his son and servants; at a little distance from the appointed place he dismounts, and walks alone with Isaac; the latter is made to bear the wood that is soon to con- sume him; in blissful ignorance, he asks, "Where is the victim ?" Abraham answers evasively, "The Lord will provide;" the spot is reached, the altar built, Isaac bound, put on the altar, the knife lifted,-and then the angel interferes. (3) In selecting a central figure, and grouping all the events about it, e. g., (a) in the 20th chapter, Abraham is the principal actor; Sarah is mentioned as the " woman " (v. 3), "the man's wife" (v. 7); it is Abraham who causes her to be taken to court (v. 2); it is because he is a prophet that she is to be returned (v. 7); the king blames him (not Sarah) for the deception and its consequences; the rewards or presents are given to Abraham; at his prayer, Abimelech's family is relieved; (b) in 21:10-21, Ishmael is the hero; Sarah wants Hagar banished; but the emphasis, after all, is on "her son," for he is not to be heir with Isaac; in the sufferings that follow "the child" is continually emphasized, and heaven itself opens rather to the innocent cry of the boy than to his mother's heart-rend- ing tears; (c) in oh. 22, it is again Abraham (not Isaac, strange to say) who is the principal actor; his every movement and word are carefully recorded-from the "saddling of the ass" to the "lifting of the knife." (4) In keeping one great theme before him, whatever the details. The selection of characters, though apparently strange, is due only to the selection of thought. What the prophet really wants to tell us is, that God will take care of his own, whatever be their afflictions and trials. Hence the subject is Abraham, his troubles about Sarah, Ishmael and Isaac, and how all things "worked together for good" for him who trusted God.</page><page sequence="21">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 263 4) He is prophetic (furnishing religious instruction). He teaches us, e. g., that (1) God is interested in human affairs; (2) He watches over those that trust in Him; (3) upright men (heathen even, 20:4,6) are providentially kept from moral evil; (4) He hears the prayer of the righteous (20:7,17); (5) He hears the cry of the innocent (21:17), and (6) provides for them even in the desert (21:19); (7) the good man is prosperous, and his favor is sought after by others (21:22, 23); (8) true faith goes calmly to its task, and attends to the minutest details of duty even when a catastrophe is impending. 5) He abounds in stories. The whole material (chs. 20-22) being nothing but a collection of stories. 6) He possesses certain peculiar * characteristics. (1) God's appearing in dreams, 20:3,6; (2) a plural verb with Elohim, 20:13; (3) angels calling down from heaven, 21:17; 22:11; (4) "three days' journey," 22:4; (5) repetition of proper name, in calling a person, 22:11. 5. MATERIAL. 1) Duplicates. (1) Chapter 20 seems to be but a different version of 12:10- 20t; the general resemblance is striking, since in both (a) Abraham represents her as a sister; (b) the motive being fear for his life; (c) Sarah is taken to a foreign court; (d) God interferes in her behalf; (e) the king as well as his entire house- hold suffer; (f) the foreign prince blames Abraham (note the similarity of the lan- guage:'"  J n'tY t 12:18, and `I) vy ,D 20:9); (g) Sarah is then restored; (h) Abraham receives a bonus. (2) 21:10-21 seems to be a modification of 16:5,14, the points of contact being (a) Sarah's dislike to Hiagar and her offspring (potential or actual); (b) treatment of Hiagar in such a way that she leaves (vol2un- tarily or forcedly); (c) conversation in the desert with an angel; (d) his promise that she shall have a great future for her son; (e) a well in the desert. (3) 21:22- 31 is essentially the same as 26:26-33, since in both (a) Abimelech is king and Phichol a commander in chief; (b) they come because of the patriarch's prosperity; (c) they desire and obtain a covenant of peace; (d) the event takes place in Beer- sheba; (e) the name of the place is in some way connected with "seven." 2) Differences. These stories, while having resemblances enough to show that they relate to the same event, nevertheless vary enough to indicate their literary independence; note (1) in ch. 20, as compared with 12:10-20, the following differ- ences in details: (a) E places Sarah in Abimelech's court at Gerar (20:2), J takes her to Pharaoh in Egypt (12:15); (b) according to E, the suffering or disease of the king and of his house is to prevent him from sin (18:6 in connection with 17); but J refers to it as punishment (12:17); (c) the king of Gerar invites Abraham to stay in his country (20:15), but Pharaoh sends him away (12:19b-20); (d) E mag- * i. e., not in common with J. t The consideration of 26:6-11, in this connection, will be taken up later (cf. p. 272 sq.).</page><page sequence="22">264 HEBRAICA. nifies Abraham as prophet and intercessor; J has nothing about this. (2) The two accounts of Hagar's banishment present the following differences: (a) accord- ing to E, she is driven out (21:14); J says she was so treated that she fled (16:6); (b) according to E, she leaves Abraham's house with Ishmael on her shoulder; according to J, the child is still unborn; (c) in E, Ishmael is the cause (21:9); in J, Hagar herself is to blame; (d) in E, it is Abraham himself who sends her away (21:14); in J, her treatment is left to Sarah (16:6); (e) according to E, she is treated more humanely (21:14) than she is in J's story (16:6); (f) in E, the angel calls down from heaven (21:17); in J, he meets her on the road (16:7); (g) in E, she finds the well (21:19a); in J, she is found at the well (16:7,14). (3) The consid- eration of 21:22-31 must be deferred till we reach its parallel, 26:26-33; but the principal differences are, (a) for Abraham (in 21) Isaac is put (in 26), (b) differ- ent circumstance for Beer-sheba. 3) Inconsistencies. Not only is E distinct in language, style, and manner of presentation, but also his material is incompatible with previous accounts of both P and J. (1) As compared with P, (a) ch. 20 cannot be reconciled by any possi- bility of interpretation with Sarah's age as given in 17:17. That which is said here of Sarah could not possibly be spoken of a woman ninety years of age. Still further, (b) 21:14-20 is unnatural when compared with 16:16; 17:24,25. In these latter passages Ishmael is thirteen years of age when Isaac is promised; hence is fourteen when the latter is born. Ishmael is banished after Isaac is formally weaned (21:8-10). The feast of weaning did not take place before the child was three years old. Ishmael was, therefore, seventeen years of age. Now, why or how should Hagar carry such a lad on her shoulder? (v. 14). Why should he be so helpless when cast down under the bush ? (vs. 15,16). Why should the angel instruct the exhausted mother to "lift up the boy"? (v. 18). Then (2) ch. 20 is not less out of harmony (a) with 18:11,12 (J's statement that Sarah was very old). It needs no elaboration; and (b) if this incident at Gerar is simply another event by the same writer as the author of 12:10-20, is it conceivable that Abraham, after his experience in Egypt, would repeat the same deception at Gerar, especially at a time when Sarah's condition was so critical ? The material, then, without reference to other considerations, is irreconcilable with that of either P or J; it must be from a different source, and the argument becomes much stronger when we find that just this material, so much out of harmony with what has gone before, has linguistic peculiarities which also distinguish it from the other writers. 4) It is, however, evident that E's matter begins very abruptly; "And Abra- ham moved thence...." Whence ? There undoubtedly existed a full history of the patriarchs by the author. [Cf. Jos. 24:2, where the rdsumd begins with Terah.] Perhaps R did not have all of this story. Perhaps the early material was so similar to that of J as not to require repetition. The only thing which appears certain is that we have a new writer.</page><page sequence="23">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 265 6. THEOLOGY. 1) In general, this author's view of God's relation to man is about midway between P's stiff superiority and J's aggravating anthropomorphism. We notice (1) God is interested in human affairs, and yet he does not "come down" to find out things; (2) he appears neither formally nor visibly, but in dreams; (3) his visits are frequent, but hardly familiar; (4) angels are employed; but instead of walking about on the highways, they "call down from heaven."' 2) It is nevertheless true that his conception resembles J's more than it does P's: (1) altars and sacrifices are as old as the patriarchs; there is even the possi- bility of human sacrifice in their day. (2) God employs natural means (sickness, for instance, to prevent intercourse between Abimelech and Sarah). (3) He indeed reveals himself to, and is interested in, a heathen prince; but Abraham is his favorite. 3) His monotheism is not so strict even as that of J: (1) He uses b"" exclusively; (2) occasionally even with a plural verb.

"Abraham, having completed 175 years, dies, and is buried by Isaac and Ish- mael in the cave of Machpelah, near Sarah. God's blessing is then transferred to Isaac. [Ishmael having raised up twelve princes (all of whom are given by name), passes away at the age of 137.] When forty years of age, Isaac marries Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel from Paddan-aram; and he is sixty years old, when they (Esau and Jacob*) are born. Esau, at forty, marries two Hittite women, who are a source of displeasure to Isaac and Rebekah. Isaac accordingly instructs Jacob not to take a wife' from the daughters of Canaan,' but to go to Paddan-aram and marry one of Laban's daughters. 'And thus E1-Shaddai will bless thee and make thee an assembly of nations; and Abraham's blessing will be transferred unto thee and thy seed.' Jacob leaves, as directed, for Paddan-aram. Esau, seeing how dissatisfied Isaac is with Canaanitish women, takes, in addition to his wives, a daughter of Ishmael."' * The names have to be supplied from a diffterent account which R has inserted.</page><page sequence="24">266 HEBRAICA. 3.

As usual, P knows nothing of family difjiculties. (1) Jacob gets his blessing simply because he leaves home; there is no cheating or rivalry between him and Esau. (2) Jacob leaves home simply because his parents do not wish him to marry in the neighborhood; no hatred on the part of Esau, no fear on Jacob's part. 3) Omissions. We find nothing in JE about (1) Abraham's death, (2) Sarah's death, (3) Ishmael's death. Some critics* think the first, at least, existed, but was omitted by R. 6. THEOLOGY.

Being old and prosperous, Abraham adjures his steward not to take a wife for Isaac from the Canaanites, but from his own family. The servant takes a solemn oath to comply with these conditions, and sets out for Aram-naharaim, to the city of Nahor (Abraham's brother). Then follows a long and detailed description of the interview with Rebekah and her return with the servant to become Isaac's wife. Isaac takes her to the house and marries her. He moves to Gerar, where Yahweh appears to him and renews his covenant made with Abraham. Rebekah he represents as a sister, fearing lest the people may kill him because of her beauty. After some days, Abimelech, the king of Gerar, notices that the relations between Isaac and Rebekah are too familiar to be merely fraternal. He reproves him for a misrepresentation which might have led to sinful consequences; but issues a proclamation to his people to let this man and wife alone. Isaac devotes himself to agriculture, and is so successful that he arouses the jealousy of the king. He is thus compelled to move to the valley of Gerar, where his servants find a spring; the shepherds of Gerar, however, contest their right to its use. The same thing is repeated at their second attempt to procure water; but when the third well is dug there is no trouble. From there Isaac goes to Beer-sheba, where Yahweh appears and comforts him; he builds an altar. King Abimelech and his commander-in-chief, Phichol, come to him, and desire to make an alliance with him, which he accepts. Then his servants find a well which he calls Shebah; hence the name of the place, Beer-sheba. Rebekah being childless, Isaac prays to Yahweh, who hears him, and Rebekah conceives. Twins are to be born, who will continually strive for supremacy, but the elder will be subject to the younger. In the fullness of time, the first child comes out red and hairy, and they call it Esau; the other comes out holding his brother by the heel, hence his name Jacob. As they grew up, Esau became a hunter; while Jacob was a shepherd. Isaac loved Esau, but Rebekah preferred Jacob. "Once, when Jacob was boiling pottage, Esau comes in from the chase very tired, and requests some. Jacob says, 'Sell me your birthright for it.' Esau replies, 'I am at the point to die; what profit shall the birthright do to me ?' Jacob makes the bargain sure by an oath, and gives the pottage to his brother, who, having satisfied his appetite, departs, despising his birthright." * Ch. 27 will be considered by itself, p. 273sq.</page><page sequence="27">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 269 3.

It is-1) Free and flowing. (1) There is not found a formal statement in the entire narrative, although the aim, of course, is the same as that of P, viz., to describe the origin of Jacob and Esau and their relation one to another. We may note (a) how gracefully Rebekah is introduced (ch. 24); (b) how the whole future history of Israel and Edom is summed up in the few words of the oracle (25:23); (c) how the character of the two boys is depicted in a story (25:29-34); (d) how thrilling is the manner in which Jacob obtains his blessing; and (e) how, after all, this is only the writer's method of sending him to Aram. (2) There is order, to be sure, in this material, but no system. We feel from the very start (25:23) that Jacob is the hero; still Esau is kept in sight. He appears as a side- light all along, and is at last brought into reconciliation with his brother (32: 4sq.). (3) The transition from one topic to another is easy, scarcely noticeable; e. g., (a) ch. 24 begins with Abraham, but we are soon lost in Isaac's courtship by proxy; (b) a step changes Rebekah's girlhood into maternity, and thus, naturally enough, we are introduced to Jacob, the most important of all the patriarchs. 2) Full of stories. These may merely be indicated: (1) Abraham's servant and Rebekah (24); (2) Rebekah's hard maternity (25:21-23); (3) Esau and Jacob as children (25:24-28); (4) Jacob gets the birthright (25:29-34); (5) Rebekah in Gerar* (26:6-11); (6) Isaac's experiences in Philistia (26:12-33); (7) Jacob obtains the blessing (27:1-40); (8) his flight to Laban (27:41-45). 3) Dramatic, poetic, picturesque. Only a few out of many points may be cited : (1) the presentation of material through conversation; e. g., (a) Abraham's ideas on intermarriage, as well as his utter separation from his birthplace, could not be more emphatically expressed than in the solemn talk between him and his serv- ant (24:2-9); (b) the servant's talk; his prayerful soliloquy, his inquiries of Rebekah, and her artless answers, his direct and pointed story to her parents; (c) the business-like speech of Laban and Bethuel, Laban's welcome (v. 31), the acceptance of the proposal (vs. 50,51), the effort to detain Rebekah (vs. 55-58); (d) Jacob's bargain with Esau (25:29-32); (e) the account of the blessing, lsaac and Esau (27:1-4), Rebekah and Jacob (vs. 6-13), Jacob and Isaac (vs. 19-21), Esau and Isaac (vs. 31-40), Rebekah's last words to Jacob (vs. 42-45). (2) Hluman nature depicted: (a) The servant in his prayer shows a calm confidence that Yahweh will "act kindly" to his master; (b) as soons as he learns the parent- age of the girl he feels confident of success, and thanks Yahweh; (c) Laban's hospitality, unbounded-but due to the rich character of the gifts bestowed upon his sister; (d) business before pleasure; for the servant refuses to eat till he has told his errand; (e) the servant's story is a masterpiece of simplicity and shrewd- * Here the order of the chapter is followed.</page><page sequence="29">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 271 ness: he touches but briefly on salient points, but is careful to tell just what would attract his listeners, and to omit what would arouse their prejudice or ridicule. Note how he expands Abraham's possessions; "flocks and cattle, and silver and gold, men-servants, maid-servants, and camels and asses" (24:35); Isaac's providential birth, " .it 't'" " (v. 36); Abraham speaks of his "land and birthplace" (v. 4); the servant invariably speaks of the closer family ties, "my family and my father's house" (v. 38); he omits the injunction "not to take Isaac back ;" (f) the rough humor of Esau is characteristic: "I am going to die anyway, what profit shall the birthright do to me ?" (25:32); (g) the sly invent- iveness of Rebekah. (3) Descriptive touches: (a) time of day; cf. "at the time of evening" (24:11); "in the morning" (24:54); "at the even-tide" (24:63); "the same night" (26:24); "they arose early in the. morning" (26:31); (b) manner of action, as seen in "let down thy pitcher that I may drink" (24:14); "with her pitcher on her shoulder" (24:15); "she let down her pitcher upon her hand" (24:18); "she emptied her pitcher and ran again" (24:20); "he stood by the camels at the fountain" (24:30); "he ungirded the camels, and gave, etc." (24:32); "I put the ring upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands" (24:47); "that I may turn to the right hand or to the left" (24:49); "he lifted up his eyes and saw" (24:63,64); "looked out at a window" (26:8); "take thy weapons.... go out to the field, and take me venison" (27:3); "lifted up his voice and wept" (27:38). (4) Dramatic coincidences: "Before he had done speaking, Rebelcah came out" (24:15); Isaac is out in the field, when Rebekah arrives (24:63); Rebekah hap- pens to hear Isaac's instructions to Esau (27:5); Jacob was yet scarcely gone out, when Esau came (27:30). (5) Words and actions indicative of character: (a) the faithfulness of Abraham's servant is seen in his prayer (24:12-14); his thank- fulness to God for his success (24:26,27,52); his desire to return immediately (24:54,56); (b) the character of Rebekah is clearly presented: she is kindly, offer- ing her service to a stranger (24:18,19); active, for she hastens and runs (24:18, 20); direct and explicit, in answering questions (24:24,25,58); modest, veiling her face when first meeting Isaac (24:65b); pious, going to seek God in trouble (25:22b); ingenious, looking for every favorable opening for her favorite son (27: 6-10; 11,15,16; 42-45). 4) Characterized by puns. (1) Esau, because hairy; (2) Jacob, because hold- ing the heel; (3) Edom, because of the red pottage; (4) j)rSb *ITn, (26:8); (5) Rehoboth, because God made broad (26:22); (6) Esek, because they had trouble with him (26:20); (7) Beer-sheba, because of the "seven." (8) Esau bitterly remarks that "Jacob is well named, because he had supplanted him" (27:36). 5) Prophetic. (1) God guides the servant in making a right choice of the woman who is to be Israel's mother; (2) Abraham had faith to believe that God would do so; (3) readiness to serve is the sure sign of a right heart; (4) Isaac's prayer is answered; (5) God watches over Isaac and Rebekah, though they have</page><page sequence="30">272 HEBRAICA. foolishly exposed themselves to danger; (6) Isaac prospers in spite of trouble with the Philistines, because Yahweh is with him; (7) in spite of imperfections of the patriarchs, God works out his great plans through them. 5. MATERIAL. 1) Under J, as such, we have to consider only ch. 26, of which vs. 6-11 are claimed to be a duplicate not only of ch. 20 (= E), but also of 12:10-20 (= J). (1) In a comparison with ch. 20, the points of contact are, (a) the place, Gerar; (b) the king, Abimelech; (c) a patriarch representing his wife as a sister; (d) because of fear for his life on account of his wife's beauty; (e) Abimelech, on discovering the deception, blames the patriarch for his conduct; (f) the patriarch explains that he acted in self-defense. (2) Noticeable diff'erences are, (a) according to E it is Abraham and Sarah; according to J, Isaac and Rebekah; (b) E makes the danger of the woman acctual; J, only possible; (c) according to E, Abimelech learns the fact of her true relation to the patriarch by God's appearing in a dream; but in J he finds it out casually, by looking through the window; (d) consist- ently enough, J omits the part about presents given to the patriarch, the infliction of disease on the king and household, and the prayer of the patriarch for their restoration. 2) When compared with J's other account, (1) few and feeble points of con- tact are to be noticed, as (a) a patriarch and wife sojourn in a strange land; (b) they represent themselves as brother and sister; (c) the king of the land,on learn- ing the deceit, censures the husband, who pleads self-defense as an excuse. (2) The points of divergence, on the other hand, are many and marked: (a) in ch. 26, the place is Gerar in Philistia; in 12, Egypt; (b) here it is Rebekah and Isaac; there, Sarah and Abraham; (c) here the women is never separated from her hus- band; there she is actually taken to the Egyptian court; (d) Pharaoh discovers the reality by plagues; Abimelech, by observation; (e) the Egyptian naturally makes recompense; the Philistine has no occasion to do this; (f) Pharaoh sends the deceitful couple out of his borders; Abimelech issues a proclamation " not to touch the man and his wife."* 3) The following remarks may be included here: (1) It is highly improbable that the three accounts before us are of three different events; for it is unreason- able to suppose that Abraham would repeat such a disastrous experiment, or that Isaac would not have profited by his father's double experience. (2) The ques- tions which relate to the age of the venerable women concerned in the stories, increase the difficulties enormously. (3) It will be noticed that J's stories have practically nothing more in common than the palming off a wife for a sister; while E's anecdote closely resembles both of the others. In other words, E is the connecting link: from the story of Rebekah and Abimelech (ch. 26) there was * Isaac is dismissed from Gerar, but later and for a diferent cause (26:16).</page><page sequence="31">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 273 developed the story of Sarah and Abimelech (ch. 20), which in turn became that of Sarah and Pharaoh (ch. 12). (4) It is well to remember that even if Moses was the author of these stories, they are not the records of an eye-witness, but received traditions, which, passing from mouth to mouth, necessarily underwent certain changes and modifications from generation to generation. These varied versions often became in the course of time independent stories, if the changes became too essential and too great to look at them as mere variations of the same theme. This seems to explain the double story of J. (5) Ch. 26 bears all the marks of originality: (a) it is the briefest; (b) it is the simplest; (c) it contains nothing supernatural; (d) it has nothing strange in it; (e) there is no attempt at edifica- tion (or undeserved glorification of the patriarch). 4) It is also to be noted that vs. 26-33 are a duplicate of 21:22-32 (= E): (1) for points of resemblance, see under "Material," p. 263; (2) for points of differ- ence, see "Material" on p. 263-4. But in addition, the following points may be mentioned: (3) in ch. 26, Isaac receives his would-be allies very coldly at first, and hints that they have not treated him well; while Abraham is very ready to make a treaty; (4) with Isaac, they remain over night; (5) Abraham gives Abim- elech seven sheep; (6) the first two points, viz., the names of the king and chief commander, being the same, and the different origin assigned to Beer-sheba, seem sufficient to make the stories come from different authors. But add to these the minor points of difference enumerated above, and note the fact that the first story uses tC~ , while the second has Vt , and the case becomes still more clear. C.

SYNOPSIS* OF CHAPTER 27.t "Isaac, being old and blind, calls his favorite son, Esau, and tells him to take some game and prepare it according to his taste, and in return he will give him his final blessing. Rebekah, overhearing the conversation, calls Jacob, her son, * The synopsis here given takes no notice of its composite nature. t The few other doubtful verses of E may well be disregarded, since they contain only the names of Keturah's children, which she bore to Abraham. *6</page><page sequence="32">274 HEBRAICA. and informs him that Esau is about to receive the paternal blessing. She com- mands him to go to the flock and get two young kids, and she will prepare them for his father. He will take them in, and receive the blessing. Jacob objects that the blind father may feel him, and thus discover that he lacks the hair char- acteristic of Esau's skin, and, if thus caught, he will be cursed rather than blessed. His mother assures him that she will assume the responsibility of the curse, if he will only do as she bids him. He complies. (The remainder of the story may be passed over.) By this deception Jacob secures the patriarchal blessing; Esau is indignant and determines to kill Jacob. Rebekah sends him away to her brother in Haran, where he is to remain till Esau becomes calmer, when she will send for him." ERemark. The language and style of ch. 27 were considered underJ, since the prophetic writers are so similar in these respects as to make it impossible, in this case, to discern their elements, except in so far as " Material " is concerned.] 5. MATERIAL OF CHAPTER 27. 1) The composite character of this story is evident, because (1) VfT occurs three times (vs. 7,20,27), b*)t is found in 28. (2) Unnecessaryeven inexplicable, repetition occurs: (a) vs. 18,19 tell of Isaac's asking Jacob, "Who art thou, my son ?"' and of Jacob's replying, "I am Esau, thy first-born ;" (b) in vs. 21-23, Isaac, still incredulous, feels Jacob, and is satisfied that it is Esau, "and so he blessed him." The whole matter, then, is settled. But in v. 24, Isaac asks again, "Art thou my son Esau ?" and Jacob says "I am."' Then in v. 26, Isaac says, " Draw near and kiss me, my son," and then he blesses him, saying, "The smell of my son is like the smell of a field which the Lord hath blessed;" (c) in vs. 33, 34, Isaac tells Esau that somebody else got the blessing, and Esau cries bitterly and asks to be blessed also; in vs. 37,38, we have the same thing repeated: Isaac enumerates the blessings bestowed on Jacob, and says, "What now can I do for thee ?" Esau replies, "Bless me too, my father !" and lifts up his voice and cries. These facts are sufficiently similar and at the same time different enough to warrant the conclusion that R has combined two accounts. 2) It is true on the other hand that it is not possible from these duplicate statements to make two complete and consistent stories. The introductory part (vs. 1-14) and the conclusion (vs. 41-45) are probably drawn from one of the sources, or else are so thoroughly combined, that their distinctive marks are obliterated. 3) This chapter, it must be confessed, furnishes a strong argument against the analysis not only because of the lack of agreement among the critics, but also because it is impossible to make out two accounts; but the case is not so bad if only the work of R is admitted. Similar work has often been found; yet here he seems to have treated his original materials more freely than usual.</page><page sequence="33">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 275 XII.

Brief and broken as the material is, it still bears the imprint of P in that it is verbose and repetitious; e. g., (1) 29:24b adds nothing; (2) so 29:29b can be omitted without loss; (3) all that is needed of 31:18a is )fV pg J* t, and the last two words of the verse might also be left out, so that only eight words out of twenty-one are necessary. 5. MATERIAL. In this case, what is to be said may best be put in the form of remarks. 1) It is evident that we do not have three complete accounts of Jacob's sojourn in Laban's house; and yet, if there existed separate documents, each must have contained some account of Jacob's marriage with Leah and Rachel and with their servants. But 2) It must be remembered that whatever may have been the modus operandi of R, he never records a duplicate account of simple facts.t In this case, why should he narrate three times, in as many words, that Jacob married such and such women ? It would be the height of absurdity to do this. He accordingly takes the fullest and most satisfactory account, which here happens to be from E. * There being but few verses, and some of these doubtfuL, no new words are found, and but four old words. t This will explain such an omission as the birth and naming of Esau and Jacob from P's story before 25:26b.</page><page sequence="34">276 HEBRAICA. 3) Yet 31:18 (the only verse which bears the undoubted stamp of P) not only can be omitted, since it is practically a duplicate of v. 21a, but is entirely out of keeping with the general tenor of the story. (1) Four expressions are unmistak- ably characteristic of P, being such as occur repeatedly in his material. (2) Its very repetitious character breaks in on the smooth, graceful style of the narrative as a whole. (3) After the prophetic writer has told us of Jacob's determination to return to his "native land" (v. 13), and that he was encouraged by his wives to obey the divine command, he would scarcely insert in 18b the utterly useless words "to come to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan;" especially when the exciting episode about teraphim occurs in the next verse (19). 4) As usual, P knows nothing about family troubles: Jacob went to Paddan to get a wife; he returns after accomplishing his purpose, but not because of Laban's ill-treatment. 6. THEOLOGY. The absence of the theological element is quite conspicuous: (1)The daily life of the patriarchs (with the exception of a few special and formal theophanies) is barren of all religious worship. (2) This is especially noticeable in the case of Jacob: he leaves home to seek for the wife who is to be the mother of Israel; he sojourns many years in the land from which Abram was by special command sent away; he marries according to the instruction of his parents, and begets the chil- dren who are to become the tribes of Israel;-still no sacrifice or offering is made to God for his providential care, not even a prayer is addressed to the Deity. (3) Nor does God, on his part, descend to take part or interest in human affairs; He gives no encouragement to Jacob as he leaves thome, nor does he send any word to him to return. B.

Yahweh renews to him the promise of numerous descendants, and assures him of His constant presence. On awaking Jacob feels that Yahweh is in that place, and so he names it Beth-E1.* He then notices flocks around a well, which is covered with a great stone requiring the strength of all the shepherds to move it. On learning that they are from Haran he inquires for Laban. He is told that Rachel will soon be there with her father's flocks. When she appears, Jacob removes the stone, waters her cattle, and intro- duces himself. Laban, hearing of his arrival, receives him cordially; but he must marry the older daughter before the younger can be given him. [So he marries them both.]t Yahweh, seeing that Leah is not so much loved as her sister, makes her fruitful, while Rachel remains childless. Leah gives birth to Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah. Rachel offers Bilhah to Jacob, and Dan and Naphtali are born. Then Leah gives Zilpah to Jacob, and Gad and Asher are born. Reuben finds some mandrakes, for which his mother secures Jacob's attentions for a night.... Zebulun is then born; [but Godt] also opens Rachel's womb, and Joseph is born. Now Jacob's wish is to return home; but Laban desires him to stay. Jacob reminds his father-in-law of his faithful work as a shepherd, and that it is time to do something for himself and family. A bargain is finally made that Jacob shall remain as shepherd, and get such lambs as may be spotted. Laban removes all such sheep of the flocks left in Jacob's charge, and separates them from him by putting them in his son's care, at a distance of three days' journey. But by a trick Jacob succeeds in securing so many spotted lambs that he soon becomes rich. Laban's sons begin to murmur that Jacob is getting all their father's property. Yahweh advises Jacob to go back to his father's home, and so he steals away. But Laban overtakes him, and demands an explanation of his strange conduct. Matters are explained, and a stone-heap is erected as a witness between them. Jacob then sends messengers to Esau to greet him. They return with the announcement that Esau is coming with an army of four hundred men. Jacob is greatly frightened, and divides his camp in two, so that, if Esau destroys one, the other may escape. He then offers a fervent prayer reminding Yahweh of His promise of innumerable posterity. He rises in the night and takes his family * Cf. P's version, 35:6,9-15. ?

He notices that Esau and his men are coming; he places each mother with her children separately, Rachel and Joseph in the safest position (i. e. hindermost), while he himself takes the most perilous station, going foremost. He approaches Esau in great humility, falling seven times on the ground; next the servants and their children do the same, also Leah and her little ones, and finally Joseph and Rachel. Esau is finally induced to receive the present sent him, and he offers to proceed together with Jacob. The latter refuses this and other favors; so that Esau returns to Seir, while Jacob goes to Succoth." 3. LANGUAGE. 1) OLD WORDS. (1) ~iir (28:13,16,21; 29:31,32,33,35; 30:24,27, 30; 31:3,49; 32:10.

(2) Man is on familiar terms with his Creator, as seen in the fact that (a) Jacob promises service to God simply for services rendered by God to him (28:20-22[--= E]); (b) Yahweh distributes his blessings, as it were: Rachel, beautiful and beloved, is barren; while Leah, homely and disliked, is fruitful (29:31); (c) God comes to Laban to tell him not to maltreat Jacob. (3) Jacob fights and conquers an angel*(?) (32:25-28). 6) Religious instruction. (1) God watches over his children (28:13-15). (2) "Heaven's gate" is wherever a devout heart locates itself (28:17-18 [= E]). (3) The despised of man is often favored of God (29:31).

SYNOPSIS. "On his way, Jacob puts up for the night in a certain place, where he dreams of steps reaching to heaven, on which God's angels go up and down. Jacob feels it must be a holy spot; and so in the morning he makes the stone upon which he rested his head in the night, a pillar, and pours out libations upon it. He names the place Beth-el; and vows that, if God will watch over him, he will establish His worship in this place and will give Him tithes of all his possessions. He then proceeds to the land of the sons of the east. [He comes to Laban*] and spends a month with him, at which time Laban proposes to pay him for his labor. Now Laban has two daughters; Leah, the elder, has weak eyes, but Rachel, the younger, is very beautiful. Jacob is in love with the latter, and offers seven years of labor for her hand. Laban is satisfied, but at the end of this time he substitutes Leah for Rachel. When Jacob discovers it in the morning, he demands Rachel. Laban agrees to give her also at the end of the week, provided Jacob will serve seven additional years. He does so; Rachel remaining the favorite. Rachel being childless, envies her fruitful sister, and feels that she must have children, or die. She gives her servant Bilhah to Jacob, and Dan and Naphtali are born. Leah gives birth to two more children, Issachar and Zebulun. Then God remembers Rachel, and gives her Joseph. Jacob now proposes to take his family and depart from Laban, but the latter wishes to retain him at any cost. They finally agree that Jacob shall have a share in the flocks. He sees, however, that Laban's attitude toward him has changed; he calls Rachel and Leah to him in the field, narrates to them all his grievances, and also that an angel has told him in a dream to go home. The women, natu- rally enough, join with him and encourage him to leave; he departs without * This must be supplied from J.</page><page sequence="40">282 HEBRAICA. telling Laban. In addition, Rachel steals her father's teraphim. Hie crosses the river and flees toward Mt. Gilead. On the third day, Laban learns of the depart- ure, pursues with some friends, and on the seventh day overtakes Jacob at Mt. Gilead. But in a dream, God warns him not to treat Jacob unkindly.* Laban asks Jacob to explain why he led away his daughters like war-captives, and did not permit their father to bid them farewell; and, further, why he stole his (Laban's) gods. Jacob explains his sudden departure as due to his fear of Laban, and declares that the person in whose possession the gods shall be found, shall die. Though searched for, they are not found, because Rachel had put them in the camel's furniture and sat upon them. Laban failing to find them, Jacob blames him severely for his unjust suspicions, and reviews briefly all the past wrongs which he had endured. Laban proposes peace, and a heap of stones is raised up, which neither of them is ever to pass with evil purpose toward the other. They take an oath, and Jacob makes a sacrifice upon the mountain, and invites the company to a solemn feast. After spending the night here, Jacob proceeds on his way. Meeting a host of angels, he names the place Mahanaim. He then sends messengers and presents to Esau, instructing them to salute him and to tell him of his coming. DI)uring the night he sends all his household across the river, and, remaining alone, a man wrestles with him till morning; unable to overcome him, he dislocates Jacob's hip-bone. Hence Jacob becomes Israel; and the angel blesses him. Though lame, he goes forward to meet Esau. The meeting is a pileasant and affectionate one. Jacob introduces his family, and asks his brother to receive his present." 3. LANGUAGE. 1) OLD WORDS. (1) 1 (28:11; 31:54). (2j)73 D~tn (28:18; 32:1).

STYLE.$ Here may be added some of E's special characteristics, as seen, e. g., in 1) His use of dreams as a mode of God's revelation: (1) 28:12; (2) 31:10,11; (3) 31:24. 2) The frequency of the appearance of angels to men: (1) 28:12; (2) 31:11; (3) 32:2; (4) 32:25sq. 3) The mention of strange gods in patriarchal households, 31:19,24. 5. MATERIAL. Though in this section J and E are interwoven, we note the following: 1) Duplicates. (1) Jacob's vision in Bethel [E = 28:12; J = 28:13-15]; (2) v. 17 [= E] is parallel to v. 16 [= J], and is a clumsy addition which one writer would not make; (3) 31:51-53 is an inexplicable repetition of 31:48-50; (4) v. 24, in ch. 32, is unnecessary, to say the least, after v. 23; (5) both tell of some arrangements between Jacob and Laban about wages [J -- 30:31-34; E -- 31:7,8]; (6) there is some dissatisfaction with Jacob's gain [J 3 31:1; E = 31:2,5]; (7) both relate an attempt on Jacob's part to reconcile Esau [J = 32:4-6; E = 32:14b- 21]. 2) Differences. (1) E, as usual, calls the vision a dream; J, while represent- ing it in the night and in sleep (v. 16), speaks of it as a real theophany. (2) In E the principal feature is the angels, ascending and descending; in J it is Yahweh's promise. (3) The Ephraimite, naturally enough, makes the most of Jacob's consecrating Bethel, and regarding it as God's house (vs. 17,22); J, on the * "'Arair 2ey6jtevov. t "Ar. 2ey. in this sense. * Cf. also Style under J., pp. 278-280.</page><page sequence="42">284 HEBRAICA. other hand, represents the patriarch as almost surprised (note pg in v. 16) to find Yahweh in that place, and so he simply names it Beth-el. (4) According to J, Jacob asks for the "spotted and dotted, etc." at one time, and Laban freely grants it [30:31-34]; according to E, Laban offers one after the other to get the better of Jacob [31:7,8]. (5) J consistently makes Laban's sons murmur against Jacob [31:1]; but E makes Laban himself act meanly [31:2,5,43]. (6) According to J, Esau answers Jacob's messengers with an army; from E it would appear that he (= Esau) came for the purpose of reconciliation as requested by Jacob [cf. 32:7 and 33:1-3 (= J) with 33:4 (=-- E)]. (7) To all these must be added the differ- ence in the name of the Deity. 3) Inconsistencies. Jacob's extraordinary anxiety about the encounter with Esau as depicted by J [32:8-13], is incompatible with E's account of his power and courage in combating a heavenly being [32:25-29]. True, Esau came with 400 men, but Jacob also had numerous slaves [3Q:43], and had people enough for two camps [32:8]. Besides, if naturally heroic, instead of dividing his forces that some might escape, he would have concentrated them that he might resist.* 4) Omissions. That there are such is evident. They can be classified as fol- lows: (1) Such statements of fact as (a) Jacob's marriage; (b) the birth of his chil- dren; (c) motive and mode of Jacob's flight,-all these are, strictly speaking, told but once. But we must remember (a) that both prophets are very likely in such matters to agree, at least substantially, and (b) that R could not fail to see the identity of such stories (the case being quite different with the stories concerning Sarah and Rebekah, as sisters), and so he joined them together; leaving, how- ever, the variations in a rather unsatisfactory form. This wvill also account for (2) the omission of connecting words and phrases which the analysis naturally brings to light. 5) Remarks. (1) The individual variations of critics, touching this section, many and arbitrary as they may be, are due to special considerations. They are unanimous as to the existence of an analysis. (2) This section, it is universally admitted, is very unsatisfactory: (a) the duplicates and differences relate wholly to details, not to general narratives; while (b) the omissions are many and important. (3) If it were necessary to rely wholly on this section, no critic would claim an analysis. But when (a) the preceding material, (b) the material which follows, and (c) the legal argument (not touched upon as yet, but to be discussed later on) show the existence of an analysis, the facts enumerated above con- cerning this material fall into line without difficulty. (4) Whatever difficulty may attend the separation of J and E, the writer P, as opposed to both of them, is always distinct and decisive. * The massacre of Shechem [ch. 84 = J] is in full accord with J's presentation here: Jacob's family do not dare an open fight, but entrap the simple natives by a device (34:13); moreover, when Simeon and Levi accomplish the slaughter, Jacob is afraid lest surrounding tribes attack and destroy him.</page><page sequence="43">THE PENTATEUTCHAL QUESTION. 285 6.

Dinah is seen by Shechem, the son of Hamor, the prince of the land; and he asks his father to get her for him as a wife. Hamor accordingly makes a proposition of intermarriage and commerce to Jacob's family.

It is worthy of note that this writer has already practically exhausted his historic vocabulary.

This is simply legal precision); (5) "God appeared to Jacob again when he came from Paddan-aram," 35:9; (6) "These are the sons of Jacob which were born to him in Paddan-aram,"s 35:26; (7) "Kiryath-arba, that is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned," 35:27; (8) to guard us against making a mistake in counting Jacob's sons, we are told that they were twelve, 35:22b; (9) note also Isaac's age, 180 years, 35:28. 2) Stereotyped.

(b) The pillar and sacrifice by a patriarch, which is a theological incongruity for P, therefore most critics assign it to R; but Dill. explains it as a fact so firm in the tradition that even P was compelled to insert it. (2) P's material, though slightly altered by R, is still-as shown above by "language" and "style "-quite distinguish- able; and, generally speaking, it accords well with his purpose. (3) The dupli- cates are quite full, only one important missing link occurring in ch. 34, where the circumcision scheme has to be supplied in J from P's account. But it is no more than natural that, having given it so fully in P, R, in combining the two stories, omitted one account. (4) As usual, R, in reconciling different versions of the same event, and blending them into one, leaves behind him traces of his work. 2) Duplicates and dif'erences. Ch. 34 discloses, not only by its language and style, but also by the material itself, that it is a combination; e. g., (1) v. 6, Hamor coming to talk to Jacob is hardly in keeping with v. 5, Jacob's knowledge of the outrage; (2) nor does it go with v. 8, where Hamor speaks with them (not Jacob); (3) v. 7 does not fit in; if it were in its proper place, it would have some introductory clause, as t")j'g 0'y [cf. 27:5a,30 (second clause); 29:9; 24:15a, etc]; (4) vs. 8-10 have one proposition; (a) made by Hamor, (b) with no offer for any insult inflicted, (c) referring to intermarriage and commerce; while (5) vs. 11,12 have quite another proposition; here (a) Shechem speaks, (b) he asks for a favor, willing to give any dowry or gift ("i, cf. Ex. 22:15,16), (c) he wants Dinah, without any reference to future alliances; (6) it is impossible that the writer of ch. 17, who made circumcision the holiest institution of pre-Mosaic times, should make the patriarch himself use it here for such an immoral purpose; hence, v. 13 cannot be from the same pen with vs. 14-17; (7) after v. 25b, 26a is meaningless; for surely, if they slew every male, they killed the offender and his father; and (8) strangely enough, when we put these opposing parts together, we get two different presentations, each throughout consistent with P and J respect- ively: P does not know about dificulties in patriarchal affairs, and holds circum- cision in great sacredness; while J knows little or nothing about circumcision as a rite, and is full of romantic adventures in the lives of the patriarchs. Still further, (9) 35:9-15 (except 14?) is but a different presentation of 32:25-28 ? 28: 11-19; in other words, the story here is based on three different traditions: (a) E's strange incident which ended in Jacob's receiving the name Israel; (b) J's renewal of God's promise to Jacob; (c) the theophany at Luz which gave it the name of Beth-el, from JE; but (10) note that the narrative here is very different in its details; since (a) it all happens on Jacob's return from Paddan-aram; (b) there are no angels, either to dream of or to fight with; (c) no significance is attached to the new name of Jacob; (d) the promise here is almost copied from ch. 17, while that of 28:13,14 resembles closely 13:14,15. (11) The story here</page><page sequence="46">288 HEBRAICA. certainly does not presuppose the former stories. (a) Did Jacob name Bethel twice ? (b) did God change Jacob's name twice ? What necessity for such action ? How is it that they do not refer, at least, to the first occasions ? 3) Ill-fitting juxtapositions: (1) We have pointed out some of these in chi. 34, where the verses do not follow consecutively. But (2) ch. 35 is by far more remarkable in this respect: (a) if all of ch. 35 is from one writer (whether Moses or some one else), the theophany of vs. 9-15 is a mere continuation of vs. 1-7; then v. 8 becomes out of place,* while vs. 14,15 become a mere repetition of v. 7. (3) Could there be anything more strange than to place vs. 22b-26 after 22a ? (4) In the case of ch. 36, the disorderly arrangement of material is very conspicuous: (a) vs. 2,3 enumerate three wives, thus, Adah, Aholibamah and Basemath, the order (though not the names) corresponding with 26:34 and 28:9, Ishmael's daughter being the last. But in v. 10, the sons of Adak and Basenmath are confusedly con- sidered together, while Aholibamah's offspring come only in v. 14; and this new order is persisted in through vs. 15-19; (b) v. 8b is as harsh a repetition of v. 1 as could be inserted in this place; (c) v. 10b is an inconvenient combination; we should expect the last clause to come after the first clause of v. 13; (d) vs. 15- 18 are evidently a confused (see below under inconsistencies) repetition of 11-14, adding nothing but q to each name; but in former genealogies (cf. ch. 10) it is assumed that each name is the head-of-family, without going over the ground; (e) vs. 40-43 should most naturally come after v. 30, while 31-39, the successions of kings, should come last of all, since it reaches down to a later date historically; (f) what is to be said of the presence of vs. 31-39 themselves? Could Moses possibly have written them ? Does not v. 31 clearly show that it was written at least after the time of Saul or David ? 4) inconsistencies. (1) 35:10 declares Jacob's mew name to have been given him in Bethel; 32:28, at Peniet. (2) Jacob names Bethel, according to 35:15 when coming from Mesopotamia; according to 28:19-when going to it. (3) According to 35:23-26, Benjamin (like all the other children) was born inr Pacddcn-ararn; according to 35:16-18, his birth took place on the way near Ephrath. (4) 35:27-29 makes Isaac still alive on Jacob's return from Mesopotamia; while 27:1,2,4,7,10 emphasizes his being on his death-bed when Jacob left home, at least twenty- five years earlier.t (5) But Isaac's age is troublesome in another direction; viz., Isaac was sixty, when the twins were born (25:26); he was then scarcely over 100 when Esau married (26:34); but this marriage, according to 26:35, 27:46, and 28:1-9, was the occasion in connection with which Jacob left home. But * The Massorites felt it, and put a flflPD after it. + The calculation is a simple one: seven years service, before marrying Leah (29:20-25); Leah gives birth to six sons and one daughter before Joseph's birth (29:31-30:22) which would at least require ten years; hence at Joseph's birth, Jacob was at least eighteen years away from home. On leaving Laban, moreover, 31:41 tells us, he was twenty years with Laban. When meeting Esau, Joseph is old enough to understand the situation (he bows to Esau), in fact going before Rachel, being at least ten years old.</page><page sequence="47">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 289 Isaac lived 180 (35:28). In other words, (a) Isaac was but past middle life when Jacob left; why, then, consider him near death ? (b) Jacob was away from home, according to these figures, about 80 years; but where was he for sixty years, after leaving Laban ? and how could Joseph be but seventeen years (37:2a) after Isaac's death, if born while Jacob was still with Laban ? P's figures do not seem to go with the prophetic stories. (6) How many wives did Esau have, and what were their names ? [26:34 and 28:9, cf. 36:1-2, etc.] (7) According to 36:6-8, the separation of Esau and Jacob takes place as follows: after Isaac's death; for lack of room; Esau leaving Jacob to go to Seir; but according to 27:41-44, it is before Isaac's death; because of Esau's hatred, or Jacob's deceit; Jacob departing from Esau to go to Haran. (8) 32:4 says that Esau was already in Seir before Jacob reached home; but 36:8 locates him in Seir only after Isaac's death, i. e., after Jacob's return home. Can these difficulties be more easily explained.upon the supposition of a single writer. than of at least two ? 6. THEOLOGY. 1) P relates the transaction at Shechem only (1) to glorify circumcision, show- ing how firmly Jacob's family insisted upon it; (2) to exemplify the aversion of the patriarch for intermarriage with Canaanites (in the broad sense). 2) God's appearance to Jacob is, as usual, formal and distant. 3) 35i:13-14 are probably R's attempt to harmonize (?) P with JE, or (with Dill.) they are the only exception to the absence of sacrifice in pre-Mosaic times. B. Element of J. 1. VERSES ASSIGNED. 33:18b; (18a = P2) [no other critic gives it to J.

They receive the horrible tidings with mingled sorrow and anger, and when Shechem proposes to do whatever they will ask of him, if only they will let him have their sister, they demand of him deceitfully [that he and all the people be circumcised*].
