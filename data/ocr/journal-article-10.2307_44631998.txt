The side of the vehicle should perform two functions when an accident occurs. It should prevent the occupant from being ejected and it should provide a survivable impact environment for the occupant in the vehicle. Both of these functions will be examined in this paper. The accident that brings a motor vehicle occupant into contact with the side of the vehicle is a very complex event. An under- standing of the event and the development of possible remedies for the injuries that occur involves all elements of the accident picture including accident characteristics, vehicle characteristics and human tolerance to injury. A thorough examination of accident data is required to determine what element of a vehicle interacts with the occupant and contributes to the death and injury. It is also important to know crash conditions such as speed, impact point, striking object, etc., and for the vehicle it is important to know the weight, structure, stiffness, interior design, etc. For the occupant, parameters such as seating position, height, weight and age have an effect on injury. This paper discusses the state-of -knowledge in each of these elements and describes three approaches that can be used to develop a safety performance standard. Each approach consists of a sequence of steps that lead to a procedure for evaluating the safety characteristics of the side of a motor vehicle. The three approaches considered lead to a full-scale test procedure, a subsystem test procedure, or an analytical procedure and are described in Tables 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The use of an analytical procedure for safety evaluation is conceptual at this time and - ABSTRACT - Collision related injuries associated with the side of passenger vehicles are a major part of the price of motor vehicle accidents. Three methods for evaluating the crash-related safety characteristics of the sides of motor vehicles are examined. One method uses a full-scale crash test for the evaluation of performance. A second method uses subsystem, or component, tests and the third method relies on analytical procedures for the evaluation. An outline of the steps in the development of each method is presented and the status of the development is discussed. Supporting information on the injury tolerance of the thorax, abdomen, head and pelvis is provided along with discussion of test devices, test procedures and vehicle modifications. 1001 0096-736X/83/9101-1001$02.50 Copyright 1983 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">1002 A.

However, it is a possible approach and is included here because it contains many elements that are also useful in the other approaches . A cursory review of Tables 1, 2 and 3 reveals that there is ample opportunity for information from one approach to be used in either of the other two although each approach to development of a standard is described as a self-contained sequence of events. For example, the use of computer models of crash dynamics that are an integral part of the third approach can be very helpful in both approach one and approach two. Theoretically, any of the three approaches can be applied to any specific safety problem. However, in practice one approach may be more viable than the others for any given problem. The remainder of the paper will be devoted to a discussion of side impact occupant protection in the context of the three approaches presented above. The first step in any of the approaches is to identify the problem in sufficiently quantitative terms. Since this step is common to all three approaches, it is addressed in the first section. Similarly an understanding of human tolerance to injury is fundamental to all three of the evaluation procedures. For this reason, a section on injury tolerance is included after the section on problem determination. This is followed by a separate section on each of the evaluation procedures and the approach to their development. A separate section on ejection through side doors is included after the sections on the three approaches. PROBLEM DETERMINATION The injuries associated with the side of a vehicle can be conveniently divided into three main groups. One group consists of injuries to the torso (shoulder, chest, abdomen and pelvis) of the victim that result from contact with the vehicle interior. The collision conditions which produce serious and life-threatening injuries in this group usually involve damage to the side of the occupant compartment. The second group consists of the head injuries caused by contact with the window frame, roof rail and pillars. Injuries in this group result from a wide range of types of collisions. The third group of injuries associated with the vehicle side are those caused by contact with objects outside the vehicle after the occupant has been either partially or completely ejected through a side door or window. The collision conditions that produce ejections and the injuries in this group often involve rollover. The details of the problem are described in several references, including 1, 2 and 3, and are not repeated here. INJURY TOLERANCE CHEST - The NHTSA side impact program has concentrated on thoracic injury countermeasures. Extensive programs of cadaver and dummy testing have provided data in sled conditions and in full-scale crash test conditions.</page><page sequence="5">CRASH PROTECTION 1005 The data from the NHTSA program has led to the conclusion that accelerations of the dummy thorax can be used to estimate injury. The test procedures and some results are discussed in References 4 and 5. The data from the NHTSA program are summarized in Table 4. Figure 1 shows the relationship between injury, as measured by the number of fractured ribs, and acceleration at the first thoracic vertebra (Tl). Figure 2 shows the relationship between the thoracic injury as expressed on the 1976 AIS scale and the number of fractured ribs. The values of AIS discussed in Figures 1 and 2 are treated as if the AIS scale was a system of cardinal numbers even though it is in fact only Table 4 Results of NHTSA Cadaver Test Program Test Condition Age LUR** Tl** T]y ★* No. Fractured AIS and Number* Ribs 76 15 mph Rigid 76T003 (13.5) 53 82 12 H-80-01 1 27 123 93 1 2 H-80-01 4 60 106 146 3 3 H-80-01 7 38 92 76 6 3 WSU-488 (17.) 58 92 69 7 4 WSU-490 50 48 38 10 3 H-80-01 3 33 7 3 20 mph Rigid 76T010 84 168 98 13 4 76T011 69 145 158 16 4 77T089 66 249 124 88 9 5 77T092 45 158 95 82 15 4 H-80-024 24 124 125 139 0 0 H-81-002 57 119 102 133 14 4 H-81-004 56 128 124 135 16 4 H-81-006 37 83 25 mph Rigid 76T009 75 435 200 20 5 15 mph MCI pad 76T029 67 56 50 3 3 15 mph APR pad WSU-484 50 57 51 53 20 mph MCI pad 76T034 62 108 86 18 4 76T039 72 56 35 9 3 20 mph 6" pad 77T095 77 123 85 11 4 77T098 71 165 118 105 13 4 20 mph APR pad WSU-487 (21.) 54 73 49 57 53 WSU-489 44 40 80 53 H-80-018 21 69 61 0 0 H-80-020 26 52 31 20 mph Fiber- glass pad H -80-02 1 29 118 56 0 0 H-80-023 41 125 110 88 8 3 H-81-011 43 00 25 mph MCI pad 76T042 58 98 59 15 4 * 76 and 77 - University of Michigan ** LUR - Left Upper Rib WSU - Wayne State University Acceleration, in G's H - University of Heidelburg Tl - Upper Thoracic Spine Acceleration T12 - Lower Thoracic Spine Acceleration a system of ordinal numbers. This treatment allows the data to be analyzed with regression analysis and similar techniques. This is done with full recognition that fractional values of AIS do not have a direct relationship to specific injuries. These results of the cadaver test program form a basis for interpreting the response of anthropomorphic dummies.

The APR results are summarized in Figures 3 and 4 (6, 7).* ABDOMEN - Biomechanics knowledge of injury mechanisms for the abdominal viscera needs to be addressed before performance criteria for the entire torso can be established. Some progress has been made in relating injury to abdominal deflection (8, 9) as shown in Figure 5. PELVIS - Injuries to the pelvis are usually caused by a direct impact.

The data from two recent programs which have exposed the pelvis of cadaveric subjects to a lateral impact are presented in Figure 6 (10, 11). The experiments in Reference 10 consisted of a series of increasingly severe impacts to each subject. The series of tests stopped when there was a noticeable fracture in the pelvic area. The value of acceleration used in Figure 6 for these experiments (denoted by an X) is from the test prior to the one causing fracture. This value is used to avoid the effect of fatigue which might be reflected in the acceleration of the test that produced a fracture. The numerical value shown for each of the cases from Reference 11 is the AIS level of the pelvic injury.

This line, which can be considered to be a threshhold criteria, is expressed by ACCEL = 125 - 1.1 Age. This equation shows that the level of injury is related to both age and acceleration. This age effect needs to be considered when estimating the benefits that would result from a design change. HEAD - The development of performance criteria that can be used to estimate lateral impact head injuries is in a preliminary stage. Results of one cadaver test program are shown in Figure 7 and Table 5 (12, 13). Figure 7 from Reference 12 shows the relationship between head acceleration and internal pressure for both frontal head impacts and for lateral head impacts. Reference 13 suggests that for frontal impacts an internal pressure of 24-35 psi corresponds to an injury of AIS 3 or 4. This reference also suggests that pressures above 35 psi correspond to injuries of AIS 5 or 6.

Since the frontal and lateral characteristics have not been proven to be equivalent, the overall relationships in Table 5 are tentative at this time. The results of another lateral head impact program which used cadavers is shown in Figure 8 (14) . The data from these two studies indicate the threshold for injury from lateral impacts is substantially higher than for frontal impacts. However, there are also data from tests being conducted by the University of Pennsylvania indicating the reverse (15). In this program primates are sustaining long duration unconsciousness when exposed to lateral impacts. This type of long duration unconsciousness has not been evident in the frontal impacts. Because of this contradictory finding in two programs there is a need for more research into lateral head injuries caused by impacts. This research should include a detailed study of side impact accident cases involving head injury. FULL-SCALE APPROACH DUMMY - One of the cornerstones of a full-scale crash test procedure for evaluating occupant protection is a dummy which can be used as a surrogate for the occupant. The dummy must contain instrumentation that provides signals for use in predicting injury. The body regions that appear to be most commonly injured in side collisions are the chest, abdomen, head and pelvis. From biomechanics program conducted to date the following observations are made about the capability of predicting the level of injury from responses of a dummy. One step in the development of relationships between dummy response and predicted injury is to run tests with dummies under test conditions 90 i 1 1 1 1 O O O 75 - 4/5 4/s a/s ^ o - ¿/i o A ° * G 60 ~ E 0 45 - - 30 - - IC Numerical values are AIS for tests by Got et al, 22nd Stopp conference. 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 50 1 00 1 50 200 250 ACCELERATION G's Fig. 8 - Head AIS relative to acceleration and age (From: Ref. 14)</page><page sequence="8">1008 A. BURGETT AND W. BRÜBAKER for which cadaver data exists. Such a program has been run for chest injury and is described in Reference 16. This program included a series of four different test conditions using two different dummies. The four tests were: a 15 miles per hour test against a rigid wall, a 20 mph test against a surface covered with 140 mm of padding that was developed by the Association Peugeot-Renault (APR), a 20 miles per hour test against a surface that was covered with 3 inches of fiberglass honeycomb that was developed by the NHTŚA Safety Research Laboratory and a fourth test at 20 miles per hour against a rigid surface. One of the dummies was developed for NHTSA by the Highway Safety Research Institute of the University of Michigan (HSRI) and the other was developed by APR. A summary of the results of the test program are shown in Figure 9. In this figure the rectangular area with shading represents the cadaver data. The boundaries of the area are one standard deviation of injury and acceleration from the mean of the subjects for the test condition. Acceleration is in G's and level of injury is represented by the number of fractured ribs. The triangular symbol is the value of acceleration for the APR dummy and the square symbol is the value of the acceleration for the HSRI dummy. From Figure 9 it is concluded that neither dummy nor any one signal from either dummy is clearly better than the other when all tests are included. For this reason, all three signals, upper rib, upper spine or lower spine on either dummy are considered viable predictors of injury. The relationships for these three signals are: AIS = 1.1 [-5.2 + 0.18 AGE + 0.032 ACCEL LUR ]¡/2 AIS = 1.1 [-4.1 + 0.178 AGE + 0.041 ACCEL T1 V'f- AIS = 1.1 [-6.5 + 0.22 AGE + 0.040 ACCEL T12 Y'2 AGE Age of the victim ACCEL Acceleration, in G's LUR Left upper rib (4th rib on the impacted side) T1 First thoracic vertebra T12 Twelth thoracic vertebra AIS Injury on the 1976 AIS scale fā-CADAVER DATA ±1tf A-APR DUMMY □-HSRI DUMMY 15 MPH RIGID 20 MPH APR PAD 20 MPH 20 MPH RIGID FIBERGLASS PAD 20 9^ 20 Ct 20 20 __3f NFR NFR NFR NFR 11 1 il LUR ACC 300 LUR ACC 300 LUR ACC 300 LUR ACC 28 lì 28 Ī 28 20 ^ NFR Pia NFR NFR ^ NFR p T J ACC 380 T 1 ACC 300 T1 ACC *00 T1 ACC 300 20 C A 20 ň l 20| C NFR ^ NrR NFR NFR ^ T12 ACC 300 T12 ACC 300 T12 ACC 300 T12 ACC 300 Fig. 9 - Dummy acceleration/Cadaver acceleration and number fractured ribs</page><page sequence="9">CRASH PROTECTION 1009 Additional data for confirming relationships for estimating injuries can be obtained from reconstructions of real accidents. Prediction of injuries from dummy acceleration response has been demonstrated in an accident reconstruction of a Pontiac striking a Toyota in a 90° impact with both cars moving (17). In this accident from the National Crash Severity Study the victim was age 45 and suffered thoracic injuries of AIS 4. The predicted value of AIS obtained by applying the previous equation for T1 to the dummy acceleration from the reconstructed accident is 3.5. Therefore, the calculated AIS levels for other test programs may have to be increased by a 1/2 to bring predicted values into line with real accidents. The accident reconstruction program consisted of three tests over a range of impact speeds. The results of the accident reconstruction testing are shown in Table 6. An abdominal section for a dummy that incorporates the relationship in Figure 5 is being developed at the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO). The characteristics of this device are shown in Figure 10. A research program is necessary to develop countermeasures for abdominal injury. TEST PROCEDURES - When a full-scale crash test is used for developing improved vehicles, the test should represent real world conditions. The best test would be one representing a range of the real world accident conditions. NHTSA has developed a moving barrier impactor which is being used in the evaluation of safety performance. The NHTSA moving barrier that exists today is shown in Figure 11. It has a honeycomb face with stylized bumper and weighs 3,450 lbs. (18). The similarity between the barrier stiffness characteristics and the front of a medium sized automobile can be seen in Figure 12 (18). The direction of motion and orientation of the barrier accounts for all of the motion between two vehicles in the simulated event. Thus, in operation the struck vehicle is stationary. The Committee of Common Market Automobile Constructors (CCMC) has also developed a mobile deformable barrier as a test tool for lateral collisions. The CCMC barrier is flat faced, without bumper simulations, and is faced with rigid urethane foam.

Resolution of the difference is an important consideration as the development of a test procedure is completed. PERFORMANCE OF EXISTING VEHICLES - As part of the program for development of design modifications that reduce chest injuries, a series of tests of unmodified vehicles was run (20, 21, 22). The results of crash tests of unmodified vehicles are used to form a baseline for comparison with results of full-scale crash tests of modified vehicles. The results of the tests of unmodified vehicle are summarized in Table 7. In this table the spinal acceleration at T1 has been used to predict the thoracic injury level for a 45 year old victim, using the equations presented previously. In the tests using a barrier, the struck vehicle was stationary while the barrier was moving in a "crabbed" fashion. The estimated levels of injury for the tests in Table 7 are centered around AIS 3.

( 20 ) ( 21 ) ( 22 ) for further discussion of this simulation) COUNTERMEASURE DEVELOPMENT - The NHTSA program for side impact improvement has included a project for modifying a 1976 Volkswagen Rabbit. The structural modifications included improved door beams and door beam to door connections, engaging the rocker panel with tabs on the door bottom, and modifications to the A and B pillars. A roll bar concept was used to upgrade the B pillar. The purpose of this concept was to reduce the amount of collapse of the B pillar (20). Four inches of padding at the thorax and five and one-half inches at the pelvis was also installed in the structurally modified vehicles, Figure 13 (22). Four comparative tests were run as part of the evaluation of these modifications. The tests used the previously described barrier and simulated a condition where the struck vehicle was traveling 15 mph, the striking vehicle was traveling 30 mph and the impact angle was 60°. One pair of tests used the HSRI dummy and the other pair used the APR dummy. Dummy responses to impact are shown in Table 8 (22). The acceleration of the upper spine data has been converted to predicted thoracic injury level and is presented in Figure 14a and 14b. This figure shows that the preliminary results of tests under these conditions with the modified structure and additional padding produces a positive reduction in thoracic injury level. The vehicle modifications also included padding in the pelvic area as can be seen in Figure 13. The corresponding pelvic accelerations for the four tests are shown in Table 8. A comparison of these values of pelvic acceleration with the injury relationship presented in Figure 6 shows that victims of all ages would be expected to suffer pelvic fractures under the baseline conditions. However, this same comparison shows that only victims that were more than 55 years of age would expect pelvic fractures in the modified vehicles . There was a project to design and fabricate producible padding materials suitable for thoracic protection. The padding was for installation in a modified VW Rabbit structure. From this study it was concluded that it is feasible to mass produce door padding materials in the thickness range required at costs of no more than $5 per door. The prototype samples fabricated for this study demonstrated the concepts and material properties of the final products. All four materials supplied for this study (Ensolite, Ethafoam, GTR and Fiberglass) were shown to be mass producible in the required configuration (23). ESTIMATION OF BENEFITS - The estimation of benefits with the full-scale approach is very straightforward. The first step in the procedure is to run a series of crash tests to provide data for comparison of performance of modified vehicles to unmodified vehicles. One possible matrix of such tests for evaluation of torso injury is shown in Table 9. The</page><page sequence="12">1012 A. BÜRGETT AND W.

In Tests 6.2 and 6.3 the struck vehicle was a VW Rabbit with modifications to the side structure and with side interior padding. results of these tests are then used as the basis for relationships between estimated injury and impact conditions. For example, the matrix of tests presented in Table 9 will provide a basis for developing an expression such as: AIS thorax = a + b (X) +c (V) + d(0) + e(W) Where a, b, c, d and e are coefficients based on test results. and X is the impact point V is the impact velocity 0 is the impact angle W is the weight of struck vehicle Additional testing for other conditions, such as rigid objects, would provide a complete coveragi of accident conditions. With expressions such as the one for thoracic injury in multivehicle collisions and other similar expressions for each type of injury in modified and unmodified vehicles, estimates can be made of expected injury for the fleet of vehicles on the road when exposed to the real world crash conditions. Similarly, estimates can be made of injuries which would have occurred if the fleet of vehicles had been modified. Comparison of these estimates, with and without vehicle modifications, provides the benefit estimates for a particular full-scale test.

This has been discussed earl i er . The identification of test conditions in a subsystem approach is more involved than it is in a full-scale approach. In a full-scale test</page><page sequence="14">1014 A. BURGETT AND W. BRUBAKER it is only necessary to identify which crash conditions produce injuries. A select set of these are then developed into certification crash conditions. However, in the case of subsystem tests, it is important to know the impact conditions between the various parts of the victim and the parts of the vehicle. This means knowing impact points, speeds and angles of occupant body parts relative to parts of the automobile. It is also important to take into account any intrusion that may be occuring during contact with the occupant. Since this level of detail is generally not available in accident data files it is necessary to look elsewhere. Full-scale crash tests under proper conditions are one source of occupant impact conditions. Another source is simulations of crashes using computer models of occupant kinematics. Some work has been done on the identifi- cation of proper subsystem test conditions but much remains to be done. The most significant work to date is probably that done by General Motors (24, 25). Another element in subsystem tests is the test devices. In general, the test devices will be similar to human body parts for those tests which directly simulate occupant impacts. At the present time, the most advanced equipment for head impact tests is the device designed by General Motors (25). This is shown in Figure 15. A similar device has been designed by SRL as part of the NHTSA pedestrian impact program (26). Test devices for chest injury are typically simplifications of thoracic sections of anthropomorphic dummies. Two such devices are the one developed by SRL as part of a padding development program, Figure 16 (27, 28), and one being designed by General Motors (25). A major feature of tests of chest injury potential is Fig. 15 - GM head impact device (From: Ref. 25) Fig. 16 - SRL padding development test device (From: Ref. 28) the treatment of the door. In full-scale tests, door motion and intrusion are automatically included. This is not the case in subsystem tests. One approach to this problem is demonstrated in Figure 17 showing a sled test set-up at TRC (28). In this procedure the simulated door has a stiffness characteristic related to the stiffness of a door that has been damaged by a crash. Presently, there is no suggested subsystem test procedure or test device for abdominal injury. However, one procedure with the potential of reducing abdominal injuries would be one which measures the stiffness of armrests. There is also no suggested subsystem test procedure at this time for pelvic injuries. The existing FMVSS No. 214 - Side Door Strength, test is a subsystem test indirectly addressing torso injuries. The standard specifies side door strength requirements for passenger cars, minimizing the intrusion hazard in side impacts. In this procedure, a rigid steel cylinder or semi-cylindrical test device, Figure 18, is pressed statically into the door structure (29). This test helps prevent intrusion and penetration, especially for oblique collisions. Variations of this test have been proposed by General Motors (24). The subsystem approach assumes a sufficient number of tests are performed on any given vehicle to guarantee that one form of injury is not increased in sever i ty when providing reduction in another form of injury. For example, a test for structural strength might produce a harder interior surface. This could increase the injury level for occupants even though the increased strength eliminated some ejections. The interaction of all countermeasures should be considered. There are two basic ways to calibrate subsystem tests. One way makes use of biomechanical data in much the same way as it is used to calibrate dummies in the full-scale</page><page sequence="15">CRASH PROTECTION 1015 Fig. 17 - Side impact sled buck (From: Ref. 28) approach. In this approach to calibration, the subsystem test device, such as a head form or a deformable thoracic simulator, would be exposed to the same impact conditions as cadavers or other suitable human surrogate. The acceleration, deflection or other appropriate response on the test device would then be compared to the level of injury that the test produced on the human surrogate. The relationship between injury and test device response could be used to evaluate vehicle designs. The second way to calibrate a subsystem test would use the results of accident reconstructions instead of biomechanics data. In this approach to calibration, accidents in which the victim received the type of injury that the subsystem test addresses would be selected from accident files. The results of tests using the subsystem test device under conditions similar to each accident would be compared to the level of injury experienced by the accident victim. The relationship that results from this comparison of test device response and injury level can then be used in evaluating the injury mitigation potential of vehicle designs. The accident data approach to calibration can be used for both direct injury test procedures, such as an A-pi 1 1 ar/head impactor test, and indirect procedures, such as the current FMVSS No. 214.</page><page sequence="16">1016 A. BURGETT AND W. BROBAKER Fig. 18 - FMVSS No. 214 - Side Door Strength - test device The main application for subsystem testing to date has been the development of interior padding. Vehicle interior work using static and dynamic testing has produced padding materials and design concepts that are very promising for the reduction of injury (28). The main purpose of the component level padding tests was to identify viable padding materials for thorax protection and to eliminate extensive dynamic sled tests and full scale crash tests with the less efficient padding materials. The mini-sled thoracic impactor for this early work is shown in Figure 16. The estimation of benefits from subsystem tests is more involved than it is for full-scale tests. This is because the full-scale test conditions are directly relatable to accident conditions. However, subsystem test conditions are one step removed from accident conditions. Because of the indirect link between test conditions and accident conditions, additional steps are necessary when estimating benefits. A hypothetical example of estimating benefits for a head impact subsystem test is described in Appendix A to demonstrate the procedure. No actual benefit estimates are currently available for a side impact subsystem test. ANALYTICAL APPROACH At this time, and for the foreseeable future, there are no analytical procedures that are a feasible means for directly evaluating vehicle safety. However, many of the elements of the approach to developing an analytical procedure are useful for supplementing the development of full-scale and sub-system test procedures. A discussion of the steps that would be followed if the state-of-the-art were more advanced also provides perspective for the other two approaches. The steps to development of an analytical procedure are outlined in Table 3 and will be discussed in the order presented there. The information needed for problem determination with this approach is the same as needed in the other two approaches. The development of computer based mathematical models is the cornerstone of this approach. These models are used to simulate the interaction of vehicle and occupant during a crash. To be a self-contained approach to vehicle evaluation, the models must be capable of simulating vehicle and occupant responses with a great deal of fidelity.</page><page sequence="17">CRASH PROTECTION 1017 Finite element models such as the WRECKER program (30) for vehicle structural response, the model developed by the Franklin Institute Research Laboratories for thoracic response (31) and the model developed by the Naval Civil Engineering Laboratory for head response (32) have the potential for providing the necessary level of fidelity. Models such as these have three characteristics which have inhibited their development and use. One characteristic is the limitation of most finite element models in simulating conditions that involve large values of strain and non-linear behavior of the simulated structure or body part. The second characteristic is the need for detailed information on structural characteristics. For models of human anatomy, information on resilience, mass-density and connections for living tissue are needed. For models of vehicle structures, information on strength of materials used, energy absorption characteristics, and welding or fastener characteristics are needed. The third characteristic is the cost of operating these models. In some cases the cost can be as high as the cost of running a full-scale crash test. Because of these limitations use of analytical procedures for definitive evaluation of safety is not practical at this time. Simpler models than those just described can be used to implement the concept of Step 2 in Table 3 but with corresponding reduction in fidelity of response. For example, models such as those described in Reference 33 have been used to estimate patterns and trends of impact conditions and injuries. An intermediate level of sophistication of occupant model is represented by the HSRI 2-D (34) and the Cal span 3-D (35) which can be used to study occupant kinematics. An intermediate level of structural model is the SMAC program (36) which can be used to simulate crash dynamics of colliding vehicles. Before any of these models can be used for design analysis they must be validated. The validation and calibration of computer models is more of an art than it is a science. Validation requires the judicious comparison of the results of simulations using a model and responses obtained from appropriate full-scale or subsystem tests. Models of crash victims need cadaver data and data from tests with volunteers for complete validation. In its purest form the analytical approach to design or development of injury reduction countermeasures would rely entirely on the results of computer simulation for all elements of the design. This would require models possessing an extreme level of fidelity as well as describing very minute details of the design. A general approach to application of analytical procedures would begin with the problem determination as described earlier. Then, based on crash conditions identified from accident data, simulations of vehicle dynamics would be performed using SMAC or a similar model. This would establish the dynamic environment for the occupant. A study of occupant kinematics using the HSRI 2-D, Cal span 3-D or similar model would be the next step, using the vehicle dynamics from the first study as input. The details of the interaction of the vehicle and occupant under local impact conditions determined from the kinematics study would then be studied with finite-element models. For the reasons described earlier this is not feasible at this time and may never be. The evaluation of benefits for the pure analytical approach would proceed along the same general lines as described for full-scale or subsystem tests except the responses and injury predictions would come from computer simulations instead of tests. Likewise, the evaluation of construction costs and other effects could be based on the design drawings rather than being based on actual vehicles. In practice, the evaluation of both benefits and costs would be a combination of analytical studies and examination of test results. EJECTIONS The preceding sections have described the role that the side of a motor vehicle plays in determining the level of injury for occupants who are not ejected. The side is also a major route of ejection. Therefore, design features may have an effect on propensity for ejection. There are two basic questions that need to be addressed when discussing ways of reducing ejection. These are: "What is the pay-off of preventing ejection?" and, "What changes to the sides of vehicles are necessary to realize some, or all, of the potential pay-off?" The answer to the first question is mainly found in accident data. The answer to the second question can be developed through any of the three approaches described in this paper. A review of accident data shows that rollover accidents are a major source of ejections and associated injury (1, 37). The accident data also shows that for those accidents where there is only rollover, i.e., there is no horizontal impact, the victims are much safer if they are not ejected. Although rollovers are involved in many ejections there are also ejections that are not associated with rollover or are associated with rollovers after a horizontal impact. For these types of accidents the victim often receives serious injuries due to contact with the vehicle interior prior to being ejected (Reference 1, 37). Under these conditions, prevention of ejection will eliminate injuries due to contact with exterior objects but will not reduce the injuries caused by contact with the vehicle interior. All types of accidents and all sources of injury must be considered when</page><page sequence="18">1018 A. BURGETT AND W. BRUBAKER evaluating the potential pay-off of preventing ejection. The development of design changes that will reduce ejections through the side of vehicles can follow two paths. One is to focus on conditions contributing to ejection and attempt to correct deficiencies. At the present time there are no specific programs for pursuing this path. The other path is to combine consideration of ejection with consideration of protection for victims who remain in the vehicle. This approach provides for evaluation of a countermeasure over the entire spectrum of injuries - both ejected occupants and those remaining within the vehicle. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS A review of the preceding discussion reveals that the development of a standard includes activities that are applicable to more than one of the approaches. For example, full-scale crash testing is an integral part of the first approach but is also necessary for calibrating subsystem test procedures. Likewise, the development and use of computer models is essential in the third approach but models are also very helpful in either of the first two approaches. Activities in any of the three approaches can contribute to a better understanding of vehicle safety performance. In recent years the emphasis of the NHTSA side impact program has been on the development of a full-scale test procedure for use in reduction of chest injuries. This emphasis has led to the development of a new deformable barrier which can be used to simulate car-to-car collisions, the development of at least two dummies with special design features for use in side impact testing, the acquisition of a large bank of data on injury tolerance and several vehicle modifications which have potential for reducing chest injuries. Most of these elements of the program are nearing completion at this time. This same work has also provided a basis for full-scale tests of pelvis protection. Performance criteria and dummy measurement capability of abdominal injury are under development. The next step will be the development of vehicle interior designs for abdominal injury reduction. Subsystem or component tests are in the early stages of development. As work progresses, the interaction of test conditions and methods for estimating benefits will need special attention. Prevention of ejection may be possible but even if ejection is prevented there may not be a reduction in level of injury because of the intensity of crashes that produce ejection.

Appendix A A Simplied Hypothetical Example of Benefits for a Head Impact/ A-Pillar Subsystem Test This example begins by analyzing the injuries received by a hypothetical group of 1,000 victims of head impacts into A-pillars. The group is assumed to contain only drivers who hit right side A-pillars. The analysis then compares these injuries to the predicted injuries that would occur if the A-pillars meet the requirements of a subsystem test. The difference between the actual injuries and the predicted injuries is the basis for estimates of benefits. The example is further simplified by assuming that all variances are zero. The first step in the analysis is to scrutinize accident data to determine what accident conditions are producing the injuries. For purposes of this example, it is assumed that sufficient data is available to determine values for the number of vehicles involved (one or two), the point of impact, the magnitude and direction of the relative velocity between the subject vehicle and either the rigid object or another struck vehicle. The second step uses the information on impact conditions to develop a series of computer simulations using an appropriate mathematical model of kinematics. It is postulated in this hypothetical example that the results of the simulations show the victims hit the A-pillar with a velocity which is the same as the delta V of the subject vehicle. It is also found that at the time of head impact with the A-pillar the head is essentially traveling along the intersection of a horizontal plane and a vertical plane between the driver's seating reference point and the impact point on the A-pillar. The results of the simulation provide the answers to two important questions: namely, "What were the local impact conditions when the head struck the A-pillar?" and "What should be the approach angle for a subsystem test utilizing a head-form which is propelled into the A-pillar?" The postulated results of the simulations can be combined with the delta V information from accident data to provide the relationship between injury and crash conditions, shown in Figures A-l and A-2. The relationship between velocity and injury level is used for purposes of illustration and may be substantially different than the real relationship. Using the results of the accident data analysis and the kinematics simulations, the next step is to conduct subsystem tests of existing A-pillars. The test consists of impacting the A-pillar with a head form. Based on the postulated simulation results, the head form is propelled along the line formed by the intersection of a horizontal plane and a vertical plane through the A-pillar and the driver's seating reference point. The postulated results of these tests are shown in Figure A-3. The results of the subsystem tests can be combined with the results shown in Figure A-2 to provide a relationship between level of head injury and head form acceleration. This is shown in Figure A-4. The information in Figure A-4 can also be presented without the intermediate variable as shown in Figure A-5. The next step is to consider the effect of a proposed change in vehicle design. For this example, it is assumed that the following requirement is imposed on all vehicles: "When impacted at 20 mph under the previously described conditions, the acceleration of the head form must be less than 100 g." If all vehicles are built to the limit of this requirement it can be expected that A-pillar characteristics would be as shown in Figure A-6. The results presented in Figures A-5 and A-6 can be combined as shown in Figure A-7.

If the crash test conditions of side impact accident has been described previously, researches dealing with injury tolerances are still in progress. GENERAL REMARKS CONCERNING INJURY TOLERANCE The value of a physical parameter associated to an injury occur ing depends from many parameters which are not always known. To minimize the influence of these parameters, there are some guidelines to apply in the researches which are aimed to determine injury tolerance levels : the first one is to choose parameters which are directly connected with the injury mechanisms, the second one is to try to associate the values obtained to parameters which could explain the differences, and thus scale and validate the results ; such parameters could be age, bone conditions, anthropometry, etc... Injury tolerance values are mainly based on the results of cadaver tests, but the cadavers are not able to reproduce all human living injuries, even if they are severe. CHEST - This paper indicates that the tolerance is related to thoracic acceleration and to age. From other studies it has been reported that the number of rib fractures is related to tho- racic deflection. At this stage, the question NFRr A 1 5 . * * * 10 * . * * * 5 t 0 5 10 15 Fig. 1 - Calculated versus recorded number of fractured ribs is : is an acceleration related criteria more suitable than a deflection related one, or the contrary ? This paper proposes to use the value of thoracic acceleration at T1 ; this is based on the the statistical analysis of 30 cadaver tests, and T1 acceleration was recorded in 13 of them. The comparison between the cal- culated number of fractured .Jibs (NFRC) and the recorded number of fractured ribs (NFRR) shows a large difference between the two para- meters values for individual cases. The pro- posed relationship does not take into account the bone conditions, whereas it has been de- monstrated that this parameter has a great influence on the tolerance (1). The second proposed tolerance criterion is the thoracic deflection ; this parameter seems more suitable as it is related to injury mechanisms. The proposed relationship between deflection and number of rib fractures is based on the results of cadaver tests, but the comparison between dead and living animals has shown that the thorax stiffness is about 80 higher in dead subjects (2) as indicated on figure 2. 8.

BURGETT AMD W. BRUBAKER To define a protection criterion, it is necessary to know the acceptable level of injury severity, which could be for the thorax the number of fractured ribs. The value of 7 fractured ribs has been proposed, but this number seems too higher because the risk of severe or fatal intrathoracic injuries increa- ses quickly with the number of fractured ribs. PELVIS - The tolerance of the pelvis is ex- pressed as a function of age and acceleration. The question for the pelvis tolerance should be : is an acceleration related parameter more suitable than a force related one, or not ? Analysis of published results giving the values of these 2 parameters according to the occuring of pelvic fractures shows a great scatter for both parameters ; nevertheless the impact force seems more directly related to injury mechanisms than the acceleration. THE HEAD - The head tolerance is not well known, and it seems that if an acceleration related parameter seems to be, according to the present knowledge of human tolerance a possible des- criptor of direct impact head injury risk, some head injury seems to be caused by other mecha- nisms, and an accident reconstruction (3) have shown an extensive head injury (AIS 4) asso- ciated with a very low head acceleration ( 3ms = 25 g's HIC = 100). This injury seems to be due to a rotational acceleration caused by a large bending of the neck, through the window area. SIDE IMPACT DUMMY - In complement to the program of comparison of HSRI and APR dummy responses, a comparative testing program is in progress in Europe. This program includes full scale tests and component tests of 4 available side impact dummies (HSRI, APR, MIRA and ONSER) . This program would end before the end of 1982 and would propose specifications for a suitable side impact dummy. TEST PROCEDURES - Different works have been carried out recently to developp mobile defor- mable barriers which would represent the "average" of a selected car population. Table 1 gives the main characteristics of these several barriers. The value of ground clearance is much different from one barrier to another, and the value of this parameter has to be chosen care- fully, because it has a great influence on the result of a test and on the possible solution to improve the side impact protection. For example, a low barrier should allow to use the side seal of the cars as a structure re- inforcement, whereas a high barrier obliges to pass most of the energy through the doors. This means also that lowering the front end structures would help to improve side impact protection. THE PROBLEM OF COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN FRONT AND SIDE - The compatibility between front and side cars is important, and has been analysed pre- viously (4, 5). This compatibility concerns the relative stiffness between front and side NHTSA CCMC UTAC TRRL FIAT WEIGHT (kg) 1566 950 915 1190 900/2300 WIDTH (mm) 1676 1550 1400 1500 1830 HEIGHT (mm) 559 490 410 600 700 GROUND CLEARANCE (mm) 330 300 380 200 170 SHAPE OF FRONT FACE flat 4 bumper flat flat + bumper flat flat THICKNESS OF DEFORMABLE 483 400 500 560 200 ELEMENT (mm) MAXIMAL CRUSH (mm) 350 300 360 420 TOTAL FORCE (KN) 150 220 175 90/320 Force 200 mm crush d® for 300 mm crush 490 350 205 320 TABLE 1 : COMPARISON OF MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF MOBILE DEFORMABLE BARRIERS</page><page sequence="25">CRASH PROTECTION 1025 and the relative vertical distribution of rigid elements ; in practice the struck car would be stiffer than the striking one at each contacted area. A full scale test system would allow to test this compatibility by testing both side impact protection and frontal stiffness distribution with the same barrier, whereas com- ponent side impact tests do not allow it. However component tests would complete the re- sults of a full scale test by checking the energy absorbtion capacity of car elements which were not hit during the test, but which could be struck by a specific body area in a hightly different crash condition. For example, this would concern the roof sides which could be struck by the head. Theoritically an analytical approach would allow to check the compatibility between front and side, but the model necessary to do this work has to be validated with test results. Fiat has proposed to use an analytical method based on the results of tests with a deformable barrier (6). CONCLUSIONS - Works necessary to developp side impact protection testing procedures are still in progress or have just been completed and have not yet been evaluated. A great part of this work is or has been conducted in the EEC biomechanics program and the evaluation of the final reports of this program (except the dummy comparison) is still in progress. These results would complete the results reported here, especially in the field of tolerance criteria, dummy development and crash simulation. REFERENCES 1 .

Goleta, CA I have two comments on the paper itself : 1) I was pleased to see the addition of research injury criteria as a func- tion of age since our studies have shown that the driving population is advancing in age. 2) I am concerned with the continuing use of a 60 degree impact mode which our studies have shown has no signifi- cant correlation with the accident files . I would also like to add for the record, the results to date of the MIV program. The Modified Integrated Vehicle pro- gram has as its goal the improvement of the crash survivability of a current production five passenger vehicle without affecting its usefulness as a transportation device. The primary focus of the effort to date has been to explore the performance of a set of preliminary design concepts to protect nearside occupants in side impact accidents. Major accomplishments include: 1. The development of door impact pad having reasonable contours with respect to human factors considerations (comfort, convenience, roominess). 2. The development of vehicle struc- tural modifications that, in similar</page><page sequence="26">1026 A. BURGETT AND W. BRUBAKER collisions, reduced door velocities, vehicle crush and intrusion within a total weight budget of roughly 13 pounds (6.0 kg. ) . 3. A preliminary design for a side impact protection system that, although not fully developed, has demonstrated a significant reduction in virtually all dummy response measures with the average reduction being 25 percent. It is believed that refining this prototype design will result in reductions aver- aging 25 percent for side measures and 25 to 50 percent for all dummy response measures in the side impact mode. 4. Preliminary analysis indicates that anticipated performance improvements if developed and demonstrated for all vehicle classes in volume production and if implemented by 1985, would by 1995, result in the saving of 2,300 lives per year and the elimination of 6,500 severe injuries per year consid- ering only nearside occupants. This projection assumes injury reduction in accidents ranging from 0 to 35 mph Delta-V. If the same level of protec- tion were assumed to be provided for far-side occupants, additional fatali- ties and injuries could be prevented. K. -H.

Mackay Accident Research Unit Dept. of Transportation and Environmental Planning The Univ. of Birmingham, England THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PAPER, which illustrates how accident data, combined with reproductions of collisions and comparisons of dummies with cadavers, can increase our knowledge of bio- mechanics and allow a rational approach to optimum crash protection. The definition of a side impact in design terms is not entirely clear. The mass, speed, angle of approach, and the geometrical and stiffness characteristics of the bullet car are important, and the mass and zone struck on the target car are clearly relevant. Accident data have still to give a clear guide as to what are the most important character- istics, in frequency terms, of those parameters which define a side impact. It is worth noting that in choosing protection criteria for the chest the effects of age in the population at risk is taken into account. This approach ought to be applied to all body regions (including the head) in all impact types when the necessary biomechanical knowledge becomes available.</page><page sequence="27">CRASH PROTECTION 1027 J. W. Melvin Highway Safety Research Institute Univ. of Michigan Ann Arbor, Ml The nature of the side impact problem is somewhat different than the familiar problem of frontal crash protection. Biomechanically , the human body behaves quite .differently in the lat- eral direction in comparison to the forward di- rection. The asymmetry of the body and its re- sponse with respect to lateral loading are fac- tors that contribute to this difference. Vehicle factors that complicate the problems include the asymmetric nature of side impacts, the relative lack of lateral crush distance of the vehicle, and the close proximity of the occupant to the deforming side structure. Thus, approaches to reducing side impact injuries and deaths may not involve the reapplication of the techniques used in frontal crash injury mitigation but, rather, involve the development of a new understanding of the biomechanical and vehicular crash factors at play in side impact. The development of full-scale crash test procedures must reflect real-world crash condi- tions. The paper discusses a moving barrier impactor that simulates car-to-car side impacts. In an analysis of side impact data, O'Day and Kaplan (SAE 790736) found that, although two- thirds of non- fatal side impact injuries involve car-to-car impacts, two-thirds of the fatalities involve impacts with trucks and fixed objects, not cars. Consideration of such factors will influence the analysis of countermeasure effec- tiveness as well as the test conditions. Patrick M. Miller MGA Research Corp. Buffalo, NY The paper addresses three methods which for evaluating crash-re I ated safety char- acteristics of motor vehicles during side collisions. These are full scale crash tests, component or subsystem tests, and analytical procedures. Each of these methods are important to the problem and should be viewed as complimentary rather than as com- petitive or alternative approaches. The use of sophisticated biomechanical dummies and crash testing procedures are absolutely necessary in order to develop the research necessary to provide a proper under- standing of the problem. However, a dis- tinction between research and promulgation of safety standards needs to be more fully con- sidered. The techniques necessary for the conduct of a research program may be too complicated for safety standards compliance testing. In the case of side impact, it might be more appropriate to base safety standards on component or subsystem type tests rather than complicated dummy perfor- mance criteria. Hence, both types of testing should be viewed as essential to providing a satisfactory solution to the role with each having a more specific rather than that suggested in the paper. The overal I situation with respect to side impact is perhaps more critical than indicated in the paper. The only side impact standard in existence is related to door impact beams and was put into effect about 10 years ago. Since then, there have been no significant changes in side impact perfor- mance. On the other hand, front and rear impact protection has been significantly upgraded. Yet, as considered in the paper, a substantial body of information related to side impact injury pattern has not been developed. Certainly, some of this knowledge should be appropriate towards the almost immediate consideration of improvements in side interior surfaces which are a signifi- cant contributor to chest injuries. The paper does not seem to address, at least directly, the role of the front structure during side impacts. Clearly, a reduction in the initial front structure stiffness would have the potential to reduce the requirements for the side structural strength. The trade-offs between front and side structure ch ar acter i st i es deserve further attention and front structural collapse char acter i st i es should be an integral part of any side structural research program.</page><page sequence="28">1028 A. BURGETT AND W. BRUBAKER Jacques Provensal Régie Nationale des Usines Renault France The conclusions presented in this paper make it possible to evaluate the considerable progress which has beeri made in understanding side impacts, both in biomechanical terms (dummies, injury criteria) and in terms of spe- cifying the tests carried out and the target performances. Two important considerations deserve further study : : although the solutions implemented in the modified vehicles are far from optimal, it is possible to envisage a first estimate of the relation between weight increases and improvement of performances with dummies . a)findings based on dummies : the figures presented in table VIII (ref. 4) reveal that a gain of half of an AIS point has been made for the 45-year-old occu- pant. A detailed calculation of the number of fractured ribs in relation to age, presented in Figure I, shows that the modifi- cations to the impacted vehicle afford a reduction by one class OCCUPANT AGE ?«U 20 I 30 I ! » ho I 60 I 70 Ty '5 '7 '9 '9 '10 'l2 'K IIK1Mnn? u 00 m ' m' ni ' XX rg' h ' u IIK1Mnn? 00 INJURY REDUCTION USING APR DUMMY F^I'O I 30 Uo « SŪ I I 70 85 Mom|:D īsi Xv^ X? x^O Xj1 'l3 y ('J M0Dp X'XX g ' g' g' INJURY REDUCTION USING HSRI DUMMY r: 1 ^ NFR O r: X ^ 1 ^ T AIS CHANGE ^ X / AIS NUMBER^1 (1976) FIG I NUMBER OF RIB FRACTURES DURING SIDE IMPACT of severity of injury (AIS ^ 3 &gt;AIS^ 2) for occupants under 30 years old. The improvement, although positive, is relatively marginal. With respect to the pelvis, the reduction in severity of lesions is more significant. However, the acceleration measured on this body segment is difficult to interpret. There is a signi- ficant difference, for example, between the measurements made on the APROD dummy and those made on the HSRI dummy ( 117g - 79g, table VIII, ref. 4), even though the pelvises are virtually iden- tical. The difference is proba- bly due to the presence or absence of an arm, but this remains to be specified, b) Incidence on the vehicle: Although the paper does not mention the weight gain required to obtain the indicated perfor- mances, we have made an estimate of the weight penalty under the following hypotheses : - structure : average weight (ref. 5) : 28,71bsx2 = 581bs - paddings : weight = 121bs Total - 70 lb s Vo = 30 MPH ryr ^ ^ STAND STILL TYPE STRIKING STRUCK CHEST YG PELVIS YG OF TEST VEHICLE VEHICLE 3 ms 3 ms BASELINE A A 36 91 MODIFIED braking A 33 69 STRIKING ATTITUDE MODIFIED STRUCTURE A 30 49 STRUCK padding MEASURED ON PART 572 DUMMY FIG II EFFECT OF TWO COUNTERMEASURES ON OCCUPANT REPONSES DURING SIDE IMPACT</page><page sequence="29">CRASH PROTECTION 1029 On the basis of this sum, we used the approach already intro- duced in the document (6), which provided us with an overall total of 2001bs accompanied by an ove- rall increase in width of 200mm (8 inches) ; clearly, these two factors combined will translate as a deterioration of the vehicle's fuel consumption figures. The comparative figures (reper- cussions on the occupant, the vehicle, accurately reflect the difficulty of protection in side collisions ; the occupant's nearness to the side panel provides a far less favorable initial situation than in the case of a front impact . This observation, in our opinion underscores the need to take into account all the possible factors for improving the present side impact situation. We have already shown (table VII) that a modification to the distribution of the impacting vehicle's stiffnesses in itself may bring improvements as significant as those provided by an improvement in the side body of the impacted vehicle. It is thus rather troubling to observe that the moveable deformable barrier imposes stresses so much greater than those that are met with during a car- to-car impact ( Figure II, ref. 4). This could yield a cost/benefit ratio that will be far from optimal. : In addition to the f uturi~~activi ties called for in the context of the working program (table IX, for example), we feel it is indis- pensable to raise the fundamental question of the test's repeatability. Compared with the situation today in the area of front impacts, the side impact procedure is more prone to scattering . . due to the use of a moveable deformable barrier ; . due to scatter effects which may come from the vehicle's side body, effects whose repercussion s may prove greater than in front impact . These factors, which are a fundamental component for the validation of the proposed precedure, must be investi- gated. REFERENCES 1 - The role of the side of the motor vehicle in crash protection. A.

BROBAKER B. Richter Volkswagen werk AG Wolfsburg, West Germany I WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT also on the "counter- measure development" part of this paper which addressed extensive modifications of the side structure and the padding of a 1976 Rabbit. Volkswagen has carried out a couple of studies of this kind, from which the Experi- mental Safety Vehicles Nò. 1 and 2 are best known. All these vehicles performed very well in regard to occupant safety as far as current dummies are accepted as human surro- gates. The results were always very similar: high costs, a decrease in comfort and an in- terference with vehicle operation. Especial- ly when non-automotive related companies are modifying the padding of production cars, sometimes it is not kept in mind that for in- stance there has to be sufficient space also for the 95 percentile male or that extensive padding may prevent the seat to be fully moved on its guide rails. Furthermore, in this particular case we have also to face another problem related to the dummy used for testing. In fact, when an APR dummy is used on such a modified vehicle we notice a decrease of vertebrae and pelvic accelerations and at the same time an increase of the LLR acceleration. What I want to express is this: All those effects have to undergo careful exami- nation in order to achieve a reasonable trade-off. John Versace Ford Motor Co. Dearborn, Ml THERE IS A LOT OF INTEREST in side impact safety both in NHTSA and in the industry. In fact, a group of MVMA and NHTSA researchers have already started to collect the main facts about side impact safety so as to eventually define a research program on side impact test methods. This paper anticipates that effort and outlines a basic sequence: from accident data to injury criteria to test procedures to hypothetical solutions and finally to a study of the potential benefits which each of them might provide. This framework was applied in this paper to each of three approaches , to full scale tests, subsystems tests, and analytical procedures . Biomechanical Data. The various approaches to side impact countermeasure development outlined in the paper all require the ability to associate injury levels with impact test response data. The basis for this association is the research relating the impact response of crash dummies to cadaver injuries. Existing data are insufficient and too variable to establish a reliable relationship, so the estimates of countermeasure benefits on the basis of these data (page 9, Table 8, Figure 14) must be taken to be provisional and directional at best, rather than definitive. The inadequacy of the biomechanics base can be seen, for example, in the relationship of Figure 1, which summarizes test data on cadaver chest damage (in terms of the number of fractured ribs) and the associated acceleration on a vertebra. The regression formula given in the paper tends to predict the number of ribs broken, knowing the cadaver age and the acceleration, but it accounts for only 36 percent of the total variance in chest injury. And of that 36 percent accounted for, nearly all of it is due to the age of the cadaver, indicating that the number of ribs broken mainly depends upon bone condition. Because of this biological factor, it is understandable that any attempt to predict cadaver response from dummy acceleration readings will be even more prone to indeterminacy, as Figure 9 shows. This is frustrating and should be a sign that a new approach to the subject may be in order. Full-Scale Testing. Because of the great expense of running a sufficient number of tests to adequately cover the spectrum of pertinent conditions, there is often more interpretation of individual crash tests than may be justified. For example, in the section on estimation of benefits and in Table 9 we see an attempt to assess the differences in thorax AIS between a modified and unmodified vehicle in only 4 pairs of crash tests in which the impact point, velocity, angle, and weight of the struck vehicle are made to vary. This much confounding of variables will produce confusion as to what is causing what, not to mention the further distortion caused by the random variability in these kinds of tests. There are ways to reduce the number of tests required through a proper application of the principles of experiment design, but not down to the barebones level of the scheme presented in Table 9.</page><page sequence="31">CRASH PROTECTION 1031 One of the differences between the European and American full-scale impacter is the weight, 3450 lbs. vs 2094 lbs. That is a very large difference, but a harmonized compromise might not be too difficult to achieve. A mathematical simulation of side impact is likely to show that the weight of the impacting vehicle less sensitively relates to occupant response than do other design factors • Is There A Future In Dummy Testing? The paper clearly favors full-scale tests and gives reasons why they are more relevant than component tests. I'd like to suggest the opposite, that the authors1 criticisms of component tests are really their strengths. The paper says that the estimation of benefits from subsystem tests is more involved than it is for full-scale tests because the full-scale test conditions are directly relatable to accident conditions. The paper goes on to say that subsystem test conditions are one step removed from accident conditions. That is true, but its significance is exactly the other way around: full-scale tests are one step removed from the injury mechanisms. Subsystem tests should be derived from injury mechanisms and therefore should result in a more direct indication of benefits. The emphasis has been on reproducing the circumstances of the accident rather than on reproducing the circumstances of the injury. The injury comes from striking things inside the car. We can learn what those are. The thing about this series of papers today is that they are telling us, in detail, what it is that vehicle occupants are being hurt by. Now I really do not believe there is that much new in those results. The ranking of ACIR injury sources at Cornell 20 years ago looked much the same, if much less detailed. But during these years of FMVSS-oriented thinking, we may have gotten ourselves off onto a tangent that confuses the relative importance of the first collision and the second collision. The appendix to this paper is the most interesting part of it. Even with all the problems we will have in trying to quantify the relationships , it establishes a kind of working direction as we explore how to devise and evaluate test methods for their potential safety impact. Indeed, most of the papers in this series have quite interesting and provocative methodologies. Richard A. Wilson Environmental Activities Staff General Motors Corp. Warren, Ml It is encouraging to see the broadening of viewpoint represented by this paper's discussion of the com- ponent/subsystem test approach. Under- standably, this paper focuses on the full-vehicle test method of promoting vehicle improvements for side impact because this is the method in which NHTSA has invested its efforts to date. The new cooperative effort between NHTSA and MVMA should yield a fuller comparison of the advantages and dis- advantages of both methods. The discussion related to Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 comes to the conclusion "that accelerations of the dummy thorax can be used to estimate injury." Other evaluation methodolog ies , such as measuring chest deflection, should be pursued as additional indicators of thorax injury potential. Figure 5 is characterized as indi- cating "progress has been made in relating injury to abdominal deflec- tion...." Figure 5 gives only force versus deflection. No injury assess- ments are given. The paper makes a correct assess- ment that criteria for estimating lateral impact head injury severity are in a preliminary stage. However, con- trary to the authors' statement, it is not likely that a detailed study of side impact cases would be beneficial in obtaining such an understanding of human tolerance. Accident analyses provide little information on the speci f ic initial conditions which pro- duce injuries. They do provide an insight into the performance of interior vehicle components and are an important consideration for assessing vehicle design performance or for de- veloping appropriate test procedures. Figure 7 shows a relationship between peak brain pressure (calculated with a math model) and peak head ac- celeration. The authors note (Table 5) that peak brain pressure can be used to assess the severity of brain injury. If this is so, then the curves of Fig- ure 7 indicate that peak head accelera- tion can also be used to assess brain injury. This implication is not con- sistent with the available biomechanics</page><page sequence="32">1032 A. BURGETT AND W. BRUBAKER data for frontal impacts which indicate that brain injury is dependent on both the magnitude of the acceleration as well as the time duration. It would appear that the math model of the head/brain needs to be improved so that it can predict a time dependency. Also, the head impact analysis in this paper is different than the analysis used by Fan and Jettner in Paper #3. Some reconciliation or combination would seem in order. The crash test dummy has been cited in this paper as a "cornerstone" for evaluating occupant protection in a full-vehicle crash test. Unfortunate- ly, the kinematics of current dummies in full-vehicle side impact testing provide very little evaluation of head impact to the various interior struc- tures in the vehicle. This seems to be a serious shortcoming for a "corner- stone." The adequacy of the two leading side impact dummies (APR and SID) is being assessed by the Human Biomechanics and Simulation Subcommit- tee of SAE. While no report has yet been issued, the Subcommittee has indi- cated concern regarding the durability and the injury prediction capability of both devices. The AIS formulas related to Figure 9 cannot be valid over all ranges of accelerations. Consider that the formulas yield the implausible predic- tion of a finite AIS for zero accelera- tion. An indication of the valid ranges would be helpful. The various sections in the paper which describe the estimation of bene- fits using a full-vehicle test approach appear to greatly oversimplify a very complex field situation. For example, it stretches the point to say that one accident case and three test recon- structions provide enough data "for confirming relationships for estimating injuries "N Also, it does not seem reasonable that one full-vehicle test can hope to "represent real world con- ditions", much less represent "a range of the real world accident conditions." Finally, to say that four tests of two vehicle conditions will provide enough data so that "estimates can be made of expected injury for the fleet of vehicles on the road when exposed to the real world crash conditions" does not seem justifiable.</page></plain_text>
