According to legend, Deminán and his three brothers - quadruplets ripped from the womb of their mother, Itiba Cahubaba (Bloodied Aged Mother) - mated with a female tortoise. Their children were the first inhabitants of the Caribbean islands and ancestors of the Taino, who lived there when Christopher Columbus arrived in 1492. Mine is no psychedelic journey induced by hallu- cinogenic drugs during a cohoba ceremony. My expe- rience among the Taino is quite real, the result of a visit to New York City's Museo del Barrios new per- manent exhibit Taino : Ancient Voyagers of the Caribbean. My canoe is a painted one, adorning the floor of the exhibition entrance; my guide is a script provided by curator Dicey Taylor. And Deminán Caracaracol? He is here, too, in the form of a ceramic effigy found in a Dominican Republic cave in 1916. The Taino, who had col- onized all of the Caribbean by a.D. 1200, suffered mightily in the wake of Columbus and his fellow colonists who conquered Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Jamaica, and other islands. Whole villages were wiped out by Old World diseases, warfare, and forced resettlement near mines and plantations. By the early sixteenth cen- tury, nearly all the Taino of the Bahamas had been removed to provide labor for Spanish interests in Hispan- iola, itself largely depopulated after contact. Within a few decades, all traces of Taino life had vanished. What did survive has come down to us in the form of commonplace words like bar- beque, canoe, hammock, and tobacco. The twentieth century saw a resur- rection of the Taino as historians and archaeologists tease information from archival sources, some of which date www.archaeology.org 67</page><page sequence="2">I 3 •S jS I I •5 i 5/5 i I 8 ř jb V E co 3 § 3 S ü3 ì 3 O U ť ¡2 e 3 from the 1490s, and from recently excavated sites. Analyses of Taino rituals recorded by early Spanish church officials have revealed a belief system as complex as any in the Americas, complete with a three- tiered cosmos and col- orful myths to explain the origins of humanity, fire, weather patterns, and time. Exquisitely carved stone and wooden duhos ; spatulas fashioned out of bone or wood and used to induce vomiting, an act of ritual purification; ceremonial stone axes; intricately carved stone and shell amulets; stone collars decorated with anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, and enigmatic patterns; and z emisy repre- sentations of gods and ancestors imbued with magical power, provide exhibit-goers with some inkling of what being a Taino may have meant. As art, the nearly 125 objects on display reveal a style quite different from better- known (and more often exhibited) Pre- columbian objects from Mesoamerica, the Andes, or even the southeastern United States. Taino art is unique, reflecting a tropical island people who fished the surrounding waters; culti- vated a host of garden crops, including manioc, corn, and sweet potatoes; and hunted and collected the islands' ter- restrial bounty. A quick glance at the face of a bat carved on a bone amulet can soon become a lengthy stare as one is drawn into the Taino psyche. Indeed, I had to take two trips through the show, one to learn about the Taino, a second to admire and appreciate their craftsmanship. Ancient Voyagers is not a high-tech exhibit, nor is it burdened by too much verDiage. mere are no bells and whistles, no interactive attractions for overactive visitors. But 1 like that. The Taino themselves domi- nate this show. Conceived as a sequel to the muse- ums highly successful temporary exhibit Taino : Precolumbian Art and Culture from the Caribbean , which had a six- month run in 1997-1998, this new installation gives the Taino a permanent presence in New York. For a people who gave us our word for "hurricane," the whirlwind Big Apple is a fitting venue. There is no catalog for Ancient Voy- agers , but an illustrated brochure and video will soon be available. The muse- um's gift shop does offer copies of the catalog from the 1997 exhibition, which contains a dozen informative articles by Taino scholars along with lush color photographs of Taino objects, including many on display in the current exhibi- tion. Topics include history and daily life of the Taino, along with informa- tion on social and political history, shamanism, and the Mesoamerican- related ball game played by Taino elites. There- also are articles focusing on duhos , stone collars and belts, zemis , symbolism, and beliefs, as well as translations of some of the Spanish documents that provide contemporary observations of the Tainos. An elegant statement on a sophisticated people, Ancient Voyagers is a fitting tribute to those eclipsed by history. ■ El Museo del Barrio ♦ 1 230 Fifth Avenue New York City 212-831-7272 Jerald T.

Many of their burial mounds still dot the Eurasian landscape, holding within them clues to the lives, beliefs, and A artistry of these ancient ^ people. Some of the most spectacular artifacts to Wà come from these sites V c were unearthed a decade § c e i ago at a Sarmatian burial e ground just outside the village of I Filippovka in southern Russia. I Here, 17 mounds were excavated by the Russian Academy of Sci- ences. Though the site had been { looted m antiquity, many artifacts survived, includ- ing those found within a single burial mound known as kurgan 1 . Within two treasure pits and lining the entryway of the burial chamber were 26 ornately carved wood deer, each two feet high and covered in gold and silver leaf. The deer are among more than 200 fifth- and fourth-century b.c. treasures showcased in The Golden Deer of Eura- sia : Scythian and Sarmatian Treasures from the Russian Steppes at the Metro- politan Museum of Art. In addition to the Filippovka material there are mag- nificent gold objects - many of them well-known, such as a comb with a battle scene and a vessel depicting Scythians - on loan from the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. Some of ' these were included in the (exhibition of in the 1975. Scythians From at the the Lands Met (exhibition of the Scythians at the Met in 1975. ^ But viewer beware! Not w all that glitters has been properly excavated. Also on display are several unprove- I nienced items from the Mets own collection, among them a ram's headed silver rhyton and two gold appliqués in the form of lions, purportedly from Iran. Nonetheless, the objects presented in the exhibition are stunning. The Golden Deer of Eurasia is accompanied by a catalog with excava- tion reports and discus- sions of the history and archaeology of the region. Following its closing at the Met on February 4, The Golden Deer of Eurasia will travel to the Palazzo Reale in Milan, where it will be on view until May 1 . - AMHS</page></plain_text>
