<plain_text><page sequence="1">"OVER TROUBLED WATERS": THE MEANING OF THE TITLE PONTIFEX JUDITH P. HALLETT Harvard University "Do whatever steps you want if/ you have cleared them with the pontiff" . . . Tom Lehrer, "The Vatican Rag," That Was The Year That Was (Reprise Records I965) The Latin title pontifex appears to derive from pons, "bridge", and facere, " to make," meaning-quite literally-" bridge-maker."I Yet ever since at least the first century B.C. learned men have questioned and even disputed the widely accepted derivation of pontifex from pons. Their reason: the huge discrepancy between the paltry tasks and pres- tige implied by the term " bridge-maker" and the important duties and status accorded Rome's chief religious functionaries in historical times. After all, we hear from Dionysius of Halicarnassus (2.73.2) that the head of the pontifical college, the pontifex maximus, had a number of weighty responsibilities; Livy (I.2o.5) and Plutarch (Numa 9.4-5) enumerate several of these tasks: expounding and interpreting divine will; direct- ing sacred rites-both public ceremonies and private sacrifices; teaching what was requisite for worship of the gods and preventing any de- parture from established custom; supervising the Vestal Virgins. In the following discussion, I would like first of all to review the age-old controversy over the meaning of the word pontifex and hope- fully confirm the popular belief that the title signifies nothing more and nothing less than "bridge-builder." Next, I will try to establish that II have adapted the phrase "over troubled waters" from the song title "Bridge Over Troubled Water" by Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel, and from the record album of the same name (Columbia Records I970). This paper was first delivered on Novem- ber 3, I969, at one of the Harvard University Dow Classical Luncheons. I would like to thank Professors Gregory Nagy, Zeph Stewart, Sheila Dickinson and Katherine Geffcken for their assistance and encouragement.</page><page sequence="2">220 JUDITH P. HALLETT [1970 it is possible to reconcile the discrepancy between the literal meaning of the pontifex's title and the nature of his official duties. We know of other instances in Greco-Roman society where a functionary's name, awarded in recognition of his earliest tasks, was retained long after his responsibilities had altered and increased drastically; we can easily prove, moreover, a connection between the pontifex maximus and the main- tenance, both physical and spiritual, of one Roman bridge even in the period of the empire. Thirdly, and most important, I want to con- sider the etymology of pons, by relating the word to its Indo-European cognates. From a study of the oldest cognate, Vedic Sanskrit pacnthdh, we can conclude that the root from which pons derives-and hence the term pons itself-is fraught with magical implications. Finally, I hope to show that the wooden pons sublicius, tended by the pontiffs and reputedly-in form if not in chronology-the oldest Roman bridge, was revered as if it possessed supernatural qualities. Such an observa- tion in turn suggests that a bridge-maker was indeed a personage of awe-inspiring powers, one to whom it was altogether natural to assign ponderous spiritual responsibilities as the machinery of the Roman state religion developed. The controversy over the etymology of pontifex begins with a state- ment made by Varro in De Lingua Latina 5.83. He reports that Quintus Scaevola, consul in go B.C. and pontifex maximus thereafter, derived pontifex from posse, "to be able" andfacere, as if the term were a syncopation of potentifex. Varro then goes on to say that he himself plumps for a derivation from pons, inasmuch as the pons sublicius was initially built and frequently repaired by the pontiffs and since they perform elaborate sacrifices on both sides of the Tiber in connection with their task of bridge-maintenance. Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the next author to delve into the issue, sides with Varro, noting that the pontifices still keep up repairs on the wooden pons sublicius (2.73.I). He quickly adds, however, that the pontiffs have jurisdiction over the most important matters, thereby implying that he, like Scaevola, found the label " bridge-builder " somewhat misrepresentative and demeaning. Two centuries later Plutarch (Numa 9.2) joins the ranks of dissenters by lightly dismissing the pons etymology (to gelo6menon to6n onomaton) in favor of that fromposse. So convinced does he feel of the posse deriva-</page><page sequence="3">Vol. ioi] "OVER TROUBLED WATERS 221 tion, in fact, that he actually distinguishes between those scholars who take posse in its sense of" to be able" and those who interpret it to mean " to be possible," since the pontifex is only assigned possible functions. He does admit, however, that-at least according to those who accept the pons derivation-the pontiffs performed sacrifices of the greatest antiquity and the most sacred character at a bridge over the Tiber; he also mentions the fact that the custody and maintenance of the bridge belonged to the priesthood, ostensibly because the Romans deemed the demolition of this wooden bridge not only illegal (ou themiton) but actually sacrilegious (eparaton). Both of the other subsequent writers who discuss the derivation of pontifex-Servius, quoting the Salian songs (ad Aeneidem 2.I66), and John the Lydian (De Anno et Mensibus 3.21) support and express no open reservations on the pons etymology. Nevertheless, the words ofJohn the Lydian reflect some confusion over the correct derivation. Granted, he initially asserts that the Roman appellation pontifex for a high religious official finds a ready parallel in ancient Athens, where all those who interpreted traditional rites and had charge of all sacred offices were named " bridge-men" (gephyraioi), because on the bridge over the Spercheius river holy rites were per- formed in Pallas' honor. But he then proceeds to associate the pontfices with the praxiergai, whose title means "perfecters," and derive pontifex from "power in deeds" (dynatou in ergois). The link between pontifex and posse, originally forged by Scaevola or an etymologist of earlier date, apparently remained so strong in his mind that he could blatantly contradict himself without the slightest compunction. Modern scholarship-hopefully more scientific than ancient spec- ulation-almost without exception comes down on the side of Varro and others who derive pontifex from pons and facere. In the fourth edition of Traite' de Grammaire Compar6e des Langues Classiques (Paris I966), for example, A. Meillet and J. Vendryes state that the word pontifex consists of the ancient suffix fex (laterficus, as in munificus), to be translated first, and ponti, accusative-in function if not ultimately in form-of pons.2 Compounds of similar formation abound in the Latin language; the two most obvious parallels are aurifex and carnifex. Yet in spite of considerable linguistic evidence and in defiance of 2p. 432.</page><page sequence="4">222 JUDITH P. HALLETT [1970 general scholarly opinion,3 at least one highly respected etymological handbook questions the derivation of pontifex from pons by sug- gesting that it may be purely a "popular etymology."4 Thus the debate over pontifex still continues, its flames fanned by those unable to reconcile the discrepancy between etymological form and official function. Two important facts, however, aid one in effecting such a reconcili- ation. First of all, it is possible to cite several other situations in Greco- Roman society where a functionary's name, which was granted in recognition of his earliest activities, was retained long after his respon- sibilities had been augmented and revised. The teichopoioi in Miletus were technically called wall-builders, but by historical times they were concerned with financial matters. Rome's treasurer, the quaestor, had abridged his title from that of murderer-hunter, quaestor paricidii, his original role. Furthermore, the Roman aedile, once only in charge of Ceres' aedes on the Aventine, eventually widened his sphere of interest to include leadership of the plebs and organization of games.5 To the above list of officials, who still kept their original names centuries after their tasks-and correspondingly, their status-had increased, one might also add the gephyraioi alluded to by John the Lydian. Un- fortunately, we have only one other ancient reference to these Greek religious officials, a totally useless one in Herodotus 5.57; from what we can gather, though, their responsibilities appear to include far more than mere sacrificing in the whereabouts of a bridge. In the second place, we have it from several good sources-Varro, Dionysius, Plutarch and the Salian chants quoted by Servius-that even in the imperial period the pontifex maximus maintained a formal con- nection with one particular Roman bridge, the ancient, all-wooden pons sublicius, a structure for all practical purposes replaced in I79 B.C. bv the nons Aemilius. which snanned the Tiber on stone arches. Varro 3 The three fullest discussions-and most ardent defenses-of the pons etymology in twentieth century Anglo-American scholarship appear in R. J. Kent, CP 8 (1913) 3 I7-26; F. A. Wright, CR 35 (1921) i55; L. A. Holland, Janus and the Bridge (Rome I961) 332-34, all discussed further below. Other contemporary supporters of the pons derivation include L. R. Palmer, The Latin Language (London I961) 35 and R. M. Ogilvie, A Commentary on Livy I-V (Oxford I965) Ioo and 138. 4Emout-Meillet (the same Meillet who authored Traite' de Grammaire Compare'e), Dictionnaire Etymologique de la Langue Latine (Paris I95I) 521. 5 I have taken these three examples from P. Kretschmer, Glotta I0 (I920) 2I2,.</page><page sequence="5">Vol. ioI] OVER TROUBLED WATERS" 223 and Servius both argue that the pontiffs had originally built the pons sublicius. Lending credence to their word, moreover, are the testi- monies, theirs and those of Dionysius and Plutarch, that the pontifices both kept up repairs and performed annual sacrifices on the bridge. The nature of these sacrifices, as related to us by Dionysius (I.38.3), suggests that great importance was attached to them: " On the Ides of May the pontifices, accompanied by the Vestal Virgins, the praetors, and whichever other citizens are lawfully entitled to be present at the rites, throw from the sacred (i.e., the Sublician) bridge into the current of the Tiber thirty effigies made in the likeness of men, which they call Argei." We should not forget, either, Plutarch's assertion that the Romans thought demolition of the pons sublicius to be utter sacrilege. On the basis of extensive ancient evidence, then, we may conclude that the Sublician bridge was carefully tended by the pontifices and thus invested with a certain religious significance. An investigation of those words in kindred languages sharing the same Indo-European root as the Latin word for bridge, pons, should provide us with an answer to the next logical question: exactly what did the term used to describe this unusual object originally imply? The Indo-European cognates of pons include Vedic-Sanskrit panthah, classical Sanskrit pathya, Avestan pantao, Old Slavonic potf, Old Prussian pintis, Greek pontos and Armenian hun. Different languages, however, use these words in different senses: Indo-Iranian, Slavic and Baltic to mean road" or 'path,' Greek to mean ''sea,' Armenian "ford," and ofcourseLatin-quiteuniquely-tomean"bridge." Notsurprisingly, scholars have attempted to search the most venerable works in the most ancient of these tongues, the Sanskrit Vedic texts, for a clue to the original connotations of the word. Earlier in this century, Roland J. Kent expounded in considerable detail the thesis that since the word panthah often means "path to the gods" in the Rig Veda, the Latin term pons must also signify the way by which an offering reaches the gods and the pontifex therefore merits authority in holy matters by reason of his creation of networks of communication between heaven and earth 6 6 In "The Vedic Paths of the Gods and the Roman Pontifex," cited in note 3 above. Kent admits to have been originally influenced by the views of several igth century German scholars, notably A. Walde, who, in Gr.-Lat. etym. Wortb. i (I877) 383 states: " pontifex Pfadbereiter, der zum Pfade der Goitter leitet".</page><page sequence="6">224 JUDITH P. HALLETT [I970 His article has enjoyed high scholarly esteem, yet its weak argumenta- tion opens it up to justifiable criticism. For one thing, although the word panthah does appear in the Rig Veda I75 times, according to Kent's own count it only seems to mean "pathway to the gods" in approximately two dozen of these instances. Kent actually goes so far as to propose a broad definition of panthah based on all I75 of its occur- rences in the Rig Veda-" the word applies to any kind of path, physical or figurative, on earth or in air "-but then blithely ignores this obser- vation to tout the specialized sense of" path to the gods" as that belong- ing to Latin pons. In the second place, he himself translates panthah as "path to the world of the dead" and "path to the home of the blessed" in a few passages where he is attempting to prove that the word means "path to the gods." Thirdly, Kent not only maintains that pons initially signified "path to the gods" in Latin, he also puts great weight on the fact that a compound adjective pathikr't, "path- making," is applied to religious figures in the Rig Veda-Brhaspati and Indra-and connects this word with the Latin pontifex. But he fails to consider that nowhere in Latin do we find an attestation of pons in the sense of "path"-or, for that matter, anything other than "bridge." Such shoddy reasoning makes his ultimate conclusions-that after the meaning of pons in Latin changed from "path" to "bridge," the tasks of bridge maintenance were assigned to the pontifex in order to strengthen what wrongly appeared to be the significance of his title- sound all the more untenable. A recent article by IEmile Benveniste, however, provides us with further information on the connotations of the Vedic word panthah;7 it thereby helps explain why the Latin cognate pons may have conveyed the idea of a magical object and subsequently have been attached to an artifact supposedly replete with supernatural powers. Concerned over the variety of senses expressed by the different Indo-European cognates ofpons, and convinced, like Kent, that one could unearth the primordial meaning of the word by studying the implications of the Sanskrit manthdh- Benveniste has first distinguished panthah from other Vedic 7 "Problemes semantiques de la reconstruction," Prob!?mes de Linguistique Gejne'rale (Paris I967) 296-98. Benveniste does not specifically refer to Kent-though his con- tentions refute Kent's resoundingly; he does not, moreover, make any connection between the meaning of pons and that of pontifex-hence my discussion.</page><page sequence="7">Vol. ioi] OVER TROUBLED WATERS 225 terms for road and then formulated a general definition of the word and its nuances on the basis of all its appearances in ancient Vedic texts, Padnthdh is always differentiated from words for known, certain, well- trodden paths: ydna, the road of souls toward their abode; marga, the path of wild animals; adhvan, a beaten track; rathya (cf. Latin rota), a chariot road. Benveniste's definition, here quoted in full, indicates that it describes treacherous, touch-and-go situations :8 " Ce qui carac- terise le pacnthdh est qu'il n'est pas simplement le chemin en tant qu'es- pace a parcourir d'un point a un autre. II implique peine, incertitude et danger, il a des detours imprevus, il peut varier avec celui qui le parcourt, et d'ailleurs il n'est pas seulement terrestre, les oiseaux ont le leur, les fleuves aussi.9 Le padnthdh n'est donc pas trace "a l'avance ni foule regulierement. C'est bien plutot un ((franchissement)&gt; tente "a travers une region inconnue et souvent hostile, une voie ouverte par les dieux a la ruee des eaux, une traversee d'obstacles naturels, ou la route qu'inventent les oiseaux dans l'espace, somme toute un chemin dans une region interdite au passage normal, un moyen de parcourir une etendue perilleuse ou accidentee". The word pacnthdh, then, is more general and magical in its implica- tions than Kent would have us believe. Its connotations of peril and mystery carry far more weight than the sense of communication with the divine.IO If the word pons retains the ideas housed in padnthdh, it would follow that a pons provides a way of overcoming and competing 8 Benveniste refers to-and draws quite heavily on-P. Thieme, Der Fremdling im Rig Veda (Leipzig 1938) 110-17, which gives numerous specific examples of how widely the term pdnthdh can be applied. One interesting point made by Thieme, though neg- lected by Benveniste, involves the language used to describe the paths of Soma, a hal- lucinogenic plant, the juice of which was imbibed to facilitate communication with the gods. When the juice's physical properties are being emphasized and the liquid's destiny is unclear, its paths are referred to bypdnthdh. The word cognate with English way and German Weg (adhvan) is employed when the juice's ideal and divine nature is stressed, because the juice's spiritual power and ability to reach the gods are well- known. Such a use of pdnthdh, of course, completely destroys Kent's theory. 9 So, as Thieme (see above, note 8) remarks, do the winds, stars, and sun-when they journey through a haze of unforeseen meteorological obstacles! 10 We must also reject the theory of F. A. Wright (above, note 3) that the "pontifices were responsible for providing a passage through the religious boundary whereby deal- ings with the outer world are possible." It is an attractive idea, insofar as it takes into account the entire sphere of other worldly powers rather than merely anthropomorphic gods (as Kent's does); Benveniste's observations, however, show that communication was doubtless only a part of the pontifex's function.</page><page sequence="8">226 JUDITH P. HALLETT [I970 with numinous powers;II the bridge-maker must have originally gained the reverence of his fellow citizens by reason of his ability to create a concrete, tangible artifact which enables one to cope with dangerous, uncertain, otherworldly situations. In short, he possessed power not unlike that of the gods in the Rig Veda, who can make as well as have a pa'nthah. The sacrifice of human forms from the pons sublicius in the festival of the Argei may thus function as a token apology for competition with the river spirits, the effigies in this case representing the lives which the waters would have taken if left unchallenged.12 Furthermore, the information available regarding the form of the pons sublicius affords us additional proof that the ancient Romans deem- ed the bridge allegedly constructed by the pontifex an awesome object. According to Dionysius (3.45.2) I3 and Plutarch (Numa 9), religious rules required that the bridge be fastened together by wooden bolts exclusively; the use of iron nails was absolutely forbidden. Though some might argue that the absence made the bridge more easily destructible in the event of an emergency attack,14 the care continu- ously bestowed upon the pons sublicius-even after it had been super- seded in its function by the pons Aemilius-and Plutarch's remark that demolition of the bridge was deemed sacrilegious suggest another reason for the prohibition: a religious taboo against iron, a super- stition widespread throughout the Mediterranean world up until the earlv 7th centurY B.C.* when the vons sublicius was reputedlv "I As a pons is a crossing device in perilous situations, so its Greek cognate pontos originally refers to perilous crossing conditions, retaining the " dangerous circumstances" sense of Vedic Sanskrit pdnthah just as pons retains its "magic creation" sense. In Homer-as opposed to thalassa, which signifies coastal or well-known waters-pontos is applied to the open sea, the places where man-eating fishes dwell, the ocean with un- known limits (cf. the epithets apeiritos, apeirdn and ichthyoeis at Od. IO.I95, n. I.350, Od. 3 . I 58). Frequently it serves as a synonym for the perilous Euxine sea in Herodotus (i.6o; 7.I47). The supematural connotations possessed by pontos in these archaic or archaized passages strongly suggest that the word pons initially had similar implications as well. I2 Such is the theory of Sir J. G. Frazer, in volume 4 of his commentary on Ovid, Fasti V. 62I-62 (London I929) 9I-I09. For another explanation of the Argei's signifi- cance, see Holland (above, note 3) 313-31. '3 Whose statement that the pons sublicius was constructed without brass or iron simply reflects confusion over why wooden beams alone held the bridge together. "4 Holland (above, note 3) 335 and Pliny (Nat. Hist. 36.I00) for example.</page><page sequence="9">Vol. IOI] "OVER TROUBLED WATERS 227 built.15 The ban against iron was meant to retain the sanctity of an object or an individual; its application to the pons sublicius places the bridge in the category of holy items. The existence of such a taboo on the chief product of the pontifex's craftsmanship no doubt paved the way for his ascendancy from the role of enabling people to tread safely to that of heading the state religion. i5 From the Old Testament one can cite two instances where iron was interdicted from a holy building: I Kings VI.7 (on the temple of Solomon) and Exodus XX.25; at Odyssey I6.294 we hear an explanation for the common fears about iron which circulated after its introduction, that the metal itself casts spells on a man. Examples of the taboo in Roman religious practices abound. A bronze plowshare alone could be used in the practice of colonia, city-founding (cf. Servius ad. Aen. 5.75 5 and Plutarch Romulus 11.2). The Arval Brethren were compelled to atone for the use of an iron axe or pruning knife (Acta Fratrum Arvalium, ed. Henzen, 22 and I28 ff.). When a person in iron chains entered the house of theflamen Dialis, he had to be released and his bonds drawn up via the impluvium to the roof and out to the street (cf. Gellius IO.I5.8; Servius ad. Aen. 2.57); in addition, the flamen's hair could only be cut with a bronze knife (cf. Servius ad. Aen. i.448; Macrobius 5.19.13; John the Lydian, De Mens. 1.13 I).</page></plain_text>
