<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Blessed Is the Tsaritsa's Womb": The Myth of Miraculous Birth and Royal Motherhood in Muscovite Russia ISOLDE THYRET U nder the influence of nineteenth-century Russian chroniclers of Muscovite court life, such as I. E. Zabelin, modern scholars generally have depicted the women of the Muscovite tsar's family as politically powerless individuals condemned to a shad- owy existence in the terem. The resulting popular image of Russian royal women as meek and enduring figures, which is embodied by Sergei Eisenstein's interpretation of Anastasiia Romanovna in "Ivan the Terrible," has long prevented historians from approaching the tsaritsy as persons with such human qualities as ambition, intelli- gence and a sense for opportunity. By focusing on one major aspect of the Muscovite tsaritsy's lives, their role as mothers of the future rulers, and by studying the royal women's own interpretation of this role, we can not only illuminate these qualities but also gain a new understanding of the status of the Muscovite tsaritsy and the cultural principles which determined their lives. As in medieval western societies where political power was concentrated in the hands of a ruling elite, the social position of Muscovite noblewomen was largely defined by their reproductive function.2 In anticipation of an heir men often dis- I wish to express my appreciation to Elizabeth Wood, Eve Levin and the anonymous readers for their insightful and beneficial comments, and to the International Research &amp; Exchanges Board and the Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian Studies in Washington, DC, for their financial assistance, which supported research for this study.

From 1526 to 1530 the Muscovite Grand Prince Vasilii III maintained a written correspondence with his second wife, Elena Glin- skaia, to monitor her physical condition. Once he sent her an icon of the Transfig- uration of the Lord to protect her health.3 Infertility posed a particularly grave threat to a noblewoman's social position. The example of Solomoniia Saburova, Vasilii's previous wife, shows that a grand princess's inability to give birth could lead to divorce or forced tonsure. Nevertheless, a study of the Muscovite tsaritsy's socio- religious activities in the sixteenth century suggests that the royal wives, who strug- gled with infertility, infant mortality and the pressure to produce a male heir to the throne, did not simply acquiesce in their fate, but actively sought to gain control over the reproductive issue by promoting a powerful myth that accorded them the role as receptacle of divine grace during the conception of the future ruler. When Sofiia Paleologue, a niece of the last Byzantine emperor, became Ivan III's wife, her future as Russian grand princess was by no means assured, since Ivan had a son from his previous marriage to Mariia of Tver'. The death of this son, Ivan Molodoi, in 1490 led to a struggle between the deceased prince's son, Dmitrii, and Vasilii, Ivan III's son from his marriage to Sofiia. The second Sofiia chronicle states that during the period of Ivan III's confusion over the choice of his successor Sofiia tried to promote her son's fortunes to a point where she was even accused of sorcery.4 Although Ivan III chose Dmitrii as his heir in 1498, Sofiia could claim vic- tory in the following year when Ivan III granted Vasilii the rule over Novgorod and Pskov, foreboding Dmitrii's eventual removal from power in 1502.5 Sofiia's support for her son cannot be explained simply as an act of motherly love; after all, Dmitrii's survival would have meant the loss of her role as tsar mother. Sofiia's recognition that her fate was inextricably linked with that of her son's, and her consequent resolve to do everything possible to assure his success, is evident in the inscription and iconography of a shroud she donated to St. Sergius in 1499: In the year 1499 this tapestry was made during the reign of the Grand Prince Ivan Vasil'evich of all Russia and his son, the Grand Prince Vasilii and the archbishop and metropolitan Simon, with the deliberation and at the order of the tsarevna of Constantinople and grand princess of Moscow, Sofiia, [the wife] of the grand prince of Moscow. She prayed to the life-giving Trin- ity and to the miracle-worker Sergius and affixed this tapestry.6 3 Arkheograficheskaia komissiia, Pis'ma russkikh gosudarei i drugikh osob tsarskago semeistva (Moscow, 1848), vol. 1, no. 1, p. 3.

Filatov have treated this inscription as evidence of the Rus- sian appreciation of Sofiia's Byzantine imperial connection, which provided Ivan III with a new dynastic dimension.7 Although the inscription mentions Sofiia's Byzantine background, its message focuses on Sofiia's liturgical actions of praying and leaving a gift at the miracle-worker's shrine. The tapestry thus not only advertises Sofiia's imperial background but states Sofiia's acceptance of St. Sergius as a holy intercessor. Given her foreign background and her struggle with the influential native family of her husband's first wife, it stands to reason that she might have sought the support of one of the protector saints of the Muscovite grand princes. According to the vita of St. Sergius of Radonezh, the saint had blessed Dmitrii Donskoi before his battle against Mamai and thus expressed his support for the Muscovite ruling dynasty al- ready during his lifetime.8 After St. Sergius's death the grand princes of Moscow continued to maintain good relations with the Trinity Sergius Monastery. In 1424, Vasilii Dmitrievich donated a shroud embroidered with the figure of St. Sergius to cover the saint's tomb.9 Pilgrimages to the saint's relics by Muscovite rulers were customary by 1446, when Vasilii II was captured by his rival Dmitrii Shemiaka while worshipping at St. Sergius's shrine.10 His successor, Ivan III, sought the saint's intercession for his cause before embarking on his campaign against Novgorod in 1477.11 Although the images on the tapestry of 1499 have been studied by M. V. Shchep- kina, the significance of the shroud's iconographic program with regard to Sofiia's dynastic politics has so far escaped scholars.12 The composition of the tapestry re- sembles that of an icon with scenes from the life of a saint.

In the late eighteenth century the centerpiece was replaced, but the remaining images were not affected by the res- toration. See T.

Svirin, Drevnerusskoe shit'e (Moscow, 1963), 59-61, the unusual raised knots in Sofiia's tapestry are a feature of fifteenth-century Italian embroidery. Since Sofiia Paleologue was raised in Rome, it is possible that she was exposed to the prevalent embroidery techniques there.

The corners show seraphs and cherubs, a special sign of holiness. The upper border from left to right depicts St. John Chrysostom, the Virgin Bogoliubskaia, the Old Testament Trinity, John the Baptist in the Desert, and the Apostle Timothy. The bottom row features SS. Peter and Aleksii, the Appearance of the Virgin to St. Sergius, and the Archangel Gabriel together with St. Basil of Parion. The right bor- der shows the Annunciation, and below it, the Ascension of Christ. The correspond- ing images on the left are God the Father Enthroned and the Descent of the Holy Spirit. 13 The images of the tapestry are grouped around a central axis defined by the depictions of the Old Testament Trinity and the Appearance of the Virgin to St. Sergius. Both themes not only invoke an association with the Trinity Sergius Mon- astery, to which the tapestry was donated, but also represent incidents of humanity's visitation by the Divine. All the images to the left of the axis express the theme of intercession. The Virgin Bogoliubskaia addresses Christ in a petitionary pose. In the Annunciation the Archangel Gabriel brings the Virgin the news of her conception, which denotes the union of the spirit and the flesh. The image thus refers to the Mother of God as a bridge between the spiritual sphere of the Divine and the physical world of man. The pivotal position of the Virgin is also stressed in the iconography of the Ascension, which shows the Mother of God remaining behind with the apostles in the physical world, while Christ is carried up to heaven by two angels. The intended beneficiary of the Virgin's intercession is represented by the figure of John Chry- sostom, who is one of Ivan III's name saints.14 Sofiia Paleologue's effort to connect the theme of intercession with the Mus- covite grand prince is underscored by the inclusion of the metropolitan saints Peter (1308-26) and Aleksii (1354-78) in the group of images located to the left of the central axis. As Gunther Stokl points out, the practice of Muscovite rulers to petition these two Russian miracle-workers along with the Virgin for political success had become regularized only during the 1470s.15 The intercessory scheme, with its focus on the Russian ruler's political well- being, is juxtaposed to an eschatalogical scheme expressed in the images to the right of the central axis. The death of John the Baptist, who is called the Forerunner in the Orthodox tradition, points to the Arrival of the Kingdom of Heaven. The proph- esied union of Christ and his father is manifest in the image of God the Father En- throned. The Descent of the Holy Spirit demonstrates human participation in the 13 An early Russian example of the image of God the Father Enthroned, which was known in By- zantium since the eleventh century, is found in a Novgorodian icon from the late fourteenth/early fifteenth century. In 1550 the Stoglav affirmed the legitimacy of depicting God the Father in anthropomorphic form. See L. S.

The location of Ivan's second name saint, Timothy, next to John the Baptist implies, like the intercessory scheme on the left, that the eschata- logical theme is closely connected with Ivan III.16 The choice of the iconographic composition of the Descent of the Holy Spirit elucidates the purpose of the associa- tion of the Muscovite ruler with the Kingdom of the Spirit. Instead of depicting the Virgin standing among the apostles, an image that would have corresponded neatly to the iconography of the Ascension on the left, Sofiia selected the exclusively Byz- antine composition of a crowned king standing before the door of the sacrificial altar and holding a cloth with twelve wheels, which represent the peoples to whom the apostles preached in their tongues.17 The implicit meaning of the outpouring of Di- vine Grace on the royal figure, who is often associated with King David,18 is clarified by the appearance of Vasilii III's name saints, the Archangel Gabriel and St. Basil of Parion,19 immediately below the image of the Descent of the Holy Spirit. By mak- ing her son Vasilii the receiver of Divine Grace and associating him with the king figure of the Pentecost image, Sofiia stated the claim that Vasilii was the rightful, divinely blessed successor to the grand princely throne, and that this notion was supported by the Muscovite rulers' protector saints, the Virgin, SS. Peter and Alek- sii, and St. Sergius. Sofiia's tapestry thus seems to represent one of the earliest man- ifestations of the Muscovite theory of the divine origin of the Russian ruler's power, which was formulated by Iosif of Volokolamsk in the 1510s.20 The inscription "with the deliberation and at the order of the tsarevna of Con- stantinople and grand princess of Moscow, Sofiia," declares Sofiia the designer of the message of the tapestry of 1499. Her selection of St. Sergius as an intercessor for her cause displays both the Byzantine princess's political shrewdness and her sense for the power of religious symbols in Muscovite Russia. Undoubtedly she was aware of St. Sergius's reputation as an intercessor for the Muscovite dynasty. The fact that Vasilii III had been baptized at St. Sergius's shrine made the saint a likely candidate for becoming his special protector.21 The inclusion of SS. Peter and Aleksii in the tapestry shows her ability to manipulate a recently established religious tradition to advance her dynastic claim. If Sofiia wanted to assure the continuity of her own line, she could advance her claim significantly by emphasizing the special relationship be- tween Vasilii and the dynasty's protector saints. The notion that Vasilii's selection as heir to the Russian throne was sanctioned by divine providence strengthened the 16 PSRL 25:323, 27:281, 12:40. 17 Louis Reau, Iconographie de l'art chretien, 3 vols.

The Sokrashchennyi letopisnyi svod 1493 g. mentions only Basil of Parion (PSRL 27:281). Basil of Parion, who is commemorated on 12 April, was bishop of the town of Parion in the Propontos during the reign of the iconoclast Leo the Isaurian (717- 740).

When after twenty years of marriage her childlessness threatened to lead to divorce, Solomoniia sought every means available to "loosen the knot of her womb."23 During an inquest in 1525 her brother, Ivan Iur'evich, admitted that she had engaged many sorceresses and sorcerers to cure her infertility with pagan magic.24 One year before her husband divorced her because of her infertility, Solo- moniia participated in a pilgrimage to Volokolamsk and Mozhaisk, presumably to implore the local saints to grant her offspring.25 Solomoniia then seems to have made a last effort to avert her fate by donating a tapestry as a liturgical gift to St. Sergius. The compositional alterations of Solomoniia's embroidery, which in icono- graphic detail is modeled after the tapestry of 1499, reflect a conscious shift from Sofiia's theme of the divinely approved heir to the Russian throne to the notion of the blessed womb of the tsaritsa.26 The tapestry's central image depicts St. Sergius's vision of the Virgin Mary and the cross of Golgotha. The apostles Peter and John stand behind the Virgin.27 On the right a kneeling St. Sergius is crossing himself before the Virgin, while St. Nikon watches from the door of a building. An inscrip- tion identifies the donors and the purpose of the gift: Have mercy, o Lord, on the pious Grand Prince Vasilii Ivanovich, lord of all Russia, and his pious Grand Princess Solomoniia, and their towns. Grant them the fruit of the womb. This tapestry was made in the year 1525, in the nineteenth year of his reign.

In 1524 the abbess Elena Devochkina and eighteen sisters were brought from the Suzdal Pokrov Monastery to Moscow to supervise the construction of the Novodevichii Monastery (Zimin, Rossiia na poroge novogo vremeni [Moscow, 1972], 294-95). 24Akty istoricheskie, sobrannye i izdannye arkheograficheskoi komissiei, 5 vols.

The upper row of images from left to right features the Annunciation, John Chrysostom, Metropolitan Peter praying be- fore the Virgin Mary, the Old Testament Trinity, John the Baptist praying in the Desert, the Archangel Gabriel, and the Birth of Christ. The images are organized symmetrically around the central subject, the Old Testament Trinity, so that the praying John the Baptist corresponds to the praying Metropolitan Peter, and the Archangel Gabriel is juxtaposed to the figure of St. John Chrysostom. The image of the Old Testament Trinity, whose literal meaning refers to the three angels' predic- tion that Abraham's wife Sarah would bear a child in spite of her old age, also links the border scenes of the Annunciation and the Birth of Christ.28 The bottom row from left to right features the Birth of the Virgin, the Encounter of Joachim and Anna at the Golden Gate, SS. Peter and Aleksii, the Philosopher Eleazar, the seven Maccabee brothers and their mother Solomoniia,29 Basil of Parion and Leontii of Rostov,30 the Encounter of Zakhary and Elizabeth, and the Birth of John the Baptist. The central image of the Maccabee family functions as an axis around which the various depictions of conjugal encounters, birth scenes and saints are grouped. As in Sofiia's shroud, the themes on the tapestry's right and left borders em- phasize the power of the Divine Spirit. The selected motifs, the dispensation of Di- vine Grace at Jesus' baptism, Christ's becoming spirit during the Ascension, his unity with the Father on the royal throne, and the dispensation of the Holy Spirit during Pentecost, all emphasize Christ's divinity.

In 1514, Vasilii III founded a church in Leontii's honor (PSRL 6:254, 13, pt. 1:18-Nikon chronicle). In the same year Vasilii donated a shroud with Leontii's image to the saint. For a description of the embroidery and its inscription see T. V. Nikolaeva, Proiz- vedeniia russkogo prikladnogo iskusstva s nadpisiami XV-pervoi chetverti XVI v., Arkheologiia SSSR, Svod arkheologicheskikh istochnikov, no. E 1-49 (Moscow, 1971), 72. The Muscovite chronicle compilation of the late fifteenth century includes Leontii of Rostov in the group of the special protector saints of the Muscovite grand princes. The chronicle notes that Dmitrii Shemiaka invoked the miracle-working metropolitan saints of Russia, Peter and Aleksii, the miracle- working bishop Leontii of Rostov, and the miracle-working hegumen Sergius, when he made a truce with Vasilii II in 1448 (PSRL 25:269). The passage confirms St6kl's suspicion that the metropolitan saints' reputation was based not only on their function as "midwives of the Muscovite realm" but also on their ability to work miracles ("Staat und Kirche," 491). Clearly the grand princes' patron saints were defined as miracle-working religious men, regardless of their rank. Moreover, Gail Lenhoff's recent observation that St. Leontii was invoked in letters of Muscovite metropolitans from 1451 corroborates Stokl's argu- ment that the cult of the patron saints of the Muscovite rulers was driven by the ecclesiastical hierarchy. See Gail Lenhoff, "Canonization and Princely Power in Northeast Rus': The Cult of Leontij Rostovskij," Die Welt der Slaven 37, no. 1-2 (1992): 359-80; and Stokl, "Staat und Kirche," 489.</page><page sequence="8">486 Isolde Thyret the petition of the Muscovite ruler family is reinforced by the image of the Trinity, after which St. Sergius's monastery was named. The figures of SS. Peter and Aleksii and the remaining saints were intended to serve as subsidiary intercessors.31 Whereas Sofiia's embroidery focuses primarily on the relationship of the Mus- covite rulers to the Divine, the tapestry of 1525 emphasizes the connection between the royal mother and the divine blessing of the future ruler. All of its corner images depict a biblical example of a miraculous conception or a miraculous birth: the An- nunciation in the upper-left corner; the Birth of Christ in the upper-right; the Birth of the Virgin and the conjugal embrace of her parents, Joachim and Anna, in the lower-left corner; and the embrace of John the Baptist's parents, and John's birth, in the lower-right corner. The association of the myth of divinely inspired birth with the donors is established by the depiction of Vasilii III's and Solomoniia's name saints, the Archangel Gabriel and the mother of the Maccabees.32 Solomoniia's iden- tification with the mother of the Maccabees illuminates the tragedy of her situation. The image of the proud mother of seven sons seems to reflect the grand princess's hope that she might still be able to bear a child. She may have realized, however, that it was already too late. According to the Old Testament apocrypha, the "mother of the seven" lost all her sons when they decided to follow the philosopher Eleazar into martyrdom. The mother herself did not escape death.33 The notion of the Muscovite tsaritsa's ability to conceive miraculously, ex- pressed in Solomoniia's tapestry, is particularly striking in view of the fact that me- dieval Russian hagiographers seldom employed the theme of miraculous birth. In the early fifteenth century Epifanii Premudryi first used it in his vita of St. Sergius of Radonezh to underscore the significance of this greatest of all Russian saints. St. Sergius is said to have cried out three times in his mother's womb during the Sunday liturgy.34 During her pregnancy, the mother of the metropolitan saint Peter had a vision in which she saw herself carrying a lamb, out of which grew a tree with many flowers.35 The theme of miraculous birth also occurred in the Russian hagiographic literature translated from the Greek, notably in the short vita of St. Theophanu, wife of the Byzantine emperor Leo VI (886-912). The vita, a copy of which was included 31 According to the Letopis nachala tsarstva, which dates from the early 1550s, Vasilii prayed to SS. Peter and Aleksii for offspring. See PSRL 29:16; and Slovar' knizhnikov i knizhnosti Drevnei Rusi. Vtoraia polovina XIV-XVI v. pt. 2:20-21. 32The association of the Maccabees with Solomoniia Saburova is also evident in an icon of the church of the Procession of the Life-Giving Cross in the Suzdal Pokrov Monastery. The icon, which is now located in the Suzdal Historical Museum, depicts the Maccabee brothers between Eleazar and their mother.

Solomoniia may well have been familiar with the Theophanu leg- end and used it to strengthen her own dynastic position. Although Solomoniia's plea to St. Sergius for offspring remained unanswered and Vasilii III condemned her to end her life as a nun in the Suzdal Pokrov Monastery, the tsaritsa's fertility myth was not forgotten.38 In order to sanction its approval of Vasilii's divorce, the church sought to emphasize Solomoniia's consent in the matter in the Tale of Solomoniia's Tonsure, which appears in the chronicle of the Pafnut'ev Borovskii Monastery and the Synodal copy of the Tipografskaia chronicle, both com- posed in the 1540s at metropolitan Daniil's court.39 The tale compares Solomoniia with Sarah, who renounced her conjugal rights for the sake of the continuity of Abraham's dynasty, thereby putting the tsaritsa into the tradition of the holy women of the Bible. Solomoniia's incapacity to bear offspring is side-stepped through the claim that she had been chosen by the Divine Spirit for spiritual, rather than physical motherhood: In the year 1526 when the pious Grand Princess Solomoniia, as the Sarah of old, saw the infertility of her womb, she implored the Grand Prince Vasilii Ivanovich of all Russia that he order her to take the veil. The tsar and lord of all Russia did not want to fulfill her wish .... Seeing that the lord was not disposed toward her request, the grand princess implored the most holy archbishop of the city of Moscow, which was saved by God, the metropolitan of all Russia, Daniil, that he petition the lord to comply with her wish, for the Holy Spirit had sown a seed of wheat in her heart that the fruit of virtue might grow.40 The expression "the Holy Spirit had sown a seed of wheat in her heart that the 36Tsentral'nyi gosudarstvennyi arkhiv drevnikh aktov (TsGADA), Moscow, f. 381, no. 163, fols. 100-O10v. I am grateful to Eve Levin for bringing this text to my attention. The original Greek short vita, which is based on an earlier long version, is first attested in a manuscript from the late tenth/early eleventh century. The first Slavic texts stem from the fourteenth century, when the patriarch of Bulgaria, Evtimii, composed an office for St. Theophanu. The textual basis of the office is unclear. See Emil Kaluzniacki, ed., Werke des Patriarchen von Bulgarien Euthymius (1375-1393) (1901; reprint ed. London, 1971), xcii- xcviii. 37TsGADA, f. 381, no. 163, fol. 100. Kaluzniacki points out that the Greek version of the short vita compares Theophanu's mother only to Samuel's mother, whereas the Slavic manuscripts add the reference to the Virgin's mother (Kaluzniacki, Werke, xciii, n.1). 38 According to Sigismund Herberstein, who visited Moscow in the early sixteenth century, Solo- moniia did not easily accept her fate.

In spite of her physical infertility Solomoniia was still considered "fruit- ful" in a spiritual sense. The Pafnut'ev Borovskii chronicle even heightened her spir- itual aura by claiming that she requested her husband's permission to leave Moscow because her social ties interfered with her desire to live an ascetic life.41 The chron- icler's emphasis on Solomoniia's personal piety even led him to retract the previous comparison of the grand princess with Sarah. Instead he equalled her to Anna, the mother of the Virgin: For the Christ-loving [Solomoniia] did not imitate Sarah but Anna, the wife of Joachim, the man of God. For Sarah because of her infertility ordered Abraham to take Hagar, his slave, [as his wife], but Anna untied the knot of her infertility through fasting and prayer, and conceived the Virgin Mary in her womb, and by this act gave birth to the immaterial light, the queen. The pious and Christ-loving grand princess and nun Sofiia did not untie the knot of the infertility of her womb, but she betrothed herself in faith to Christ, the bridegroom.42 Under Metropolitan Makarii (1542-63) Muscovite ecclesiastics further devel- oped the theme of the tsaritsy's blessed womb in the Stepennaia kniga to underscore the divinely inspired position of the Russian ruler, a notion designed to bolster the tsar's claim to the leadership of the Orthodox world after the fall of Constantinople in 1453.43 This chronicle, which was composed in the 1560s at the metropolitan's court, linked the hagiographic topos of miraculous birth with the Muscovite tsaritsy, starting with Sofiia Paleologue.44 According to the chronicle, Sofiia gave birth to Vasilii III with the help of St. Sergius of Radonezh after producing only daughters for many years.45 During a pilgrimage on foot to the Trinity Sergius Monastery to implore the saint for male offspring, Sofiia suddenly encountered St. Sergius. The saint, who held a baby boy in his arms, hurled the infant into Sofiia's lap and dis- appeared. The bewildered princess searched for the baby in the folds of her gown, but to no avail. Sofiia continued her pilgrimage and prayed at the shrine of St. Ser- gius, fully confident that the saint had listened to her plea. From that time on her womb was blessed, and after the appropriate time she gave birth to the future heir to the throne on 25 March, the very day of the Annunciation of the Virgin.46 41Begunov, "Povest' o vtorom brake Vasiliia III," 116.

Its principal actors are Sofiia, who sought the saint's in- tercession for a son, and St. Sergius, who granted the princess her request. By fo- cusing on Sofiia rather than on her child the story allots to the royal mother a crucial role in the issue of succession. The heightening of Sofiia's prestige through the myth of miraculous conception is evident in the story's emphasis on her giving birth to Vasilii on the feast of the Annunciation. Whereas the earlier chronicles only mention Vasilii's birth date and refer to the feast day of his patron saint, Gabriel,5? the Ste- pennaia kniga stresses Vasilii's birth on the day of the Annunciation and equates Sofiia's experience of miraculous conception with the Virgin's.51 The Stepennaia kniga also connects the theme of miraculous birth with Ivan IV's mother, Elena Glinskaia. Elena, who married Vasilii III in 1525,52 faced a problem similar to that of her predecessor, Solomoniia: during the first four years of her mar- riage she was unable to conceive.53 Makarii's typikon for the Novgorod Holy Trinity Monastery from the late 1520s contains instructions for regular prayers for Vasilii's and Elena's fertility: And on Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and on all holidays, one should also sing the liturgy and pray to the Lord God, the Immaculate Vir- gin and the great miracle-workers for the health and salvation of the Lord Grand Prince Vasilii Ivanovich, autocrat of all Russia, and that of his noble and Christ-loving Grand Princess Elena, that God might send them the fruit of the womb, children.54 Glinskaia accompanied her husband on arduous pilgrimages to distant monas- teries to beseech the saints for help in reversing her barrenness.55 In 1528, Vasilii 47Filatov, "Ikona s izobrazheniem siuzhetov iz istorii russkogo gosudarstva," 280. 48PSRL 12:191, 21, pt. 2:555. 49Ibid. 13, pt. 1:99 (left column); P Stroev, ed., Spiski ierarkhov i nastoiatelei monastyrei rossiiskiia tserkvi (St. Petersburg, 1877), 138. 50See, for example, PSRL 25:323, 27:281, and 12:190 (left column-early copies of the Nikon chronicle). 51 Ibid. 21, pt. 2:555, 12:191 (right column). According to the Orthodox calendar (Old Style) the Annunciation, a fixed holiday, was celebrated on 25 March. The following day, 26 March, was the feast day of Archangel Gabriel. See E. I.

Without producing an heir the princess played no role in the shaping of the ruling dynasty which the chronicle sought to glorify. 54AI 1, no. 292:531-32. 55 PSRL 21, pt. 2:606. 489</page><page sequence="12">490 Isolde Thyret and Elena journeyed to Vologda, Beloozero, Kirillov and the Ferapontov Monas- tery.56 The Stepennaia kniga compared her eventual delivery of Ivan IV to the mi- raculous birth of such famous biblical figures as Isaac, the prophet Samuel, Samson, John the Baptist, and the Virgin Mary.57 Elena Glinskaia was perceived as a mediator of God's grace to the future ruler: When he was conceived in the womb of his mother and the time of birth was close, his God-loving mother, the grand princess, then asked a fool-in- Christ named Dementii: "What will I give birth to?" Being a holy fool, he said: "Titus, a large mind."58 The reference to Titus proves that the episode does not predate Ivan's birth, since it implies knowledge of his birthday.59 On the other hand, the story of Elena's consultation with the fool-in-Christ underscores the fact that the tsaritsa had reason to be concerned about producing a son. Whether or not the story corresponds to a historical incident, its very existence contributed to the development of a myth which propagated the tsaritsa's special relationship to the Divine. The myth linked the rev- elation of the divine will and the mystery of childbirth in the figure of the royal mother, who thus became a key factor in the development of the ruler mystique of her son. Once the myth of the divinely inspired conception of Russian rulers had been established, it could be used to shield the royal wives temporarily from the pressures of having to produce male offspring. The value of such a socioreligious mechanism is significant in light of the enormous problem of infant mortality in medieval Rus- sia.60 Even a fertile queen mother could never be sure one of her sons would succeed to the throne. In the periods between pregnancies, when the fate of the tsaritsa and that of the realm hung in the balance, the myth of royal miraculous birth provided a reprieve for the tsaritsa since it maintained the hope that God and the saints could still grant her a child. This hope in turn could inspire her to regain control over her life by engaging in pious activities, such as alms-giving and pilgrimages, in order to assure the support of the supernatural. The value of the myth of the tsaritsa's blessed womb can be observed in the case of Anastasiia Romanovna, who failed to produce children in the first two years after her marriage to Ivan IV in February 1547.61 The tsaritsa's pilgrimage on foot to St. Sergius's shrine in the fall of 1547 may have been a sign of her concern.62 When after 56Ibid. 6:265. 57 Ibid. 21, pt. 2:605.

For a detailed discussion of the causes of infant mortality in the medieval West see Shulamith Shahar, Childhood in the Middle Ages (London: Routledge, 1990), 121-61. According to Shahar's estimate, out of 1,000 infants in preindustrial Europe, 200-300 died before their first birthday, and only 500 reached the age of 5 (p. 149). 61 PSRL 13, pt. 2:453 (Tsarstvennaia kniga). 62 "On Friday, September 14, on the day of the Elevation of the True Cross the pious tsaritsa and Grand Princess Anastasiia went on foot to the life-giving Trinity Sergius Monastery to pray" (ibid. 29:56).</page><page sequence="13">"Blessed Is the Tsaritsa's Womb" over one and a half years the marriage still was not blessed with a child, Anastasiia walked again, unaccompanied, to the saint's shrine on 14 September 1548.63 Al- though the chronicles do not state the reason for Anastasiia's act, the fact that she went alone and without a carriage suggests that her pilgrimage was of a petitionary nature, which required the display of particular humility. In view of St. Sergius's reputation as an agent of miraculous conception it is likely that Anastasiia sought his support in this matter. The events surrounding the birth of Ivan's and Anastasiia's first child on 10 August 1549 reveal that the royal couple had entertained the hope for a miraculous conception. On the Saturday after the delivery of a baby girl, Ivan founded a church in the names of Joachim and Anna, the parents of the Virgin, at the Novodevichii Monastery. On the next day he dedicated the church and baptized his daughter there in the name of Anna.64 This ceremonial act clearly compares the delivery of the royal baby girl to St. Anna's miraculous conception of the Virgin. Anastasiia's worries about producing an heir to the throne did not end with the successful delivery of Anna. The baby died in infancy, and the same fate befell Anastasiia's first son, Dmitrii.65 Dmitrii's death, according to the vita of St. Nikita of Pereslavl, grieved the royal couple deeply and revived its concern about a suc- cessor.66 Chapter 19 of the vita states that the royal spouses "came to Rostov and visited all the miracle-workers of Rostov there. They prayed at the honorable shrine of St. Leontii with great zeal, imploring God for offspring for the succession of the realm."67 In view of the depiction of St. Leontii in Solomoniia's tapestry, the royal couple's appeal to him is not surprising. The connection of the miraculous birth 63 The tsar followed Anastasiia on horseback six days later. The incident is mentioned in all the major chronicles. See ibid. 29:56, 13, pt. 1:156-57 and 13, pt. 2:459. The chronicles also report a trip by the royal family to St. Sergius's shrine on 21 June 1548 (ibid. 29:56 and 13, pt. 1:156). 64 Ibid. 29:57, 13, pt. 1:158, 13, pt. 2:459-60. Possibly, the construction of the church of the Con- ception of St. Anna in the Suzdal Pokrov Monastery, which was commissioned by Ivan in 1551, is also connected with the birth of the tsarevna Anna. See A. Milovskii, Suzdal, trans. Cynthia Carlile (Moscow, 1981), 52. 65 Anna died on 17 March 1551 (PSRL 13, pt. 1:161). Another daughter, Mariia, also died in infancy (ibid. 21, pt. 2:651). Dmitrii Ivanovich was born in October 1552. The circumstances of his death in June 1553 are controversial. The Nikon chronicle simply mentions Dmitrii's death on the way back from the royal couple's pilgrimage to Kirillov (ibid. 13, pt. 1:232). According to the vita of St. Nikita of Pereslavl, Dmitrii died from an illness on this trip (ibid. 21, pt. 2:651). Kurbskii connects the tsarevich's death with a crossing of the river Sheksna (Andrei Kurbskii, "Istoriia o velikom kniaze Moskovskom," in Pamiatniki literatury Drevnei Rusi. Vtoraia polovina XVI veka, ed. L. A. Dmitriev and D. S. Likhachev [Moscow: Khudozhestvennaia literatura, 1986], 272). Less reliable seventeenth-century accounts of the event concur with Kurbskii, but differ with regard to the details. According to Isaac Massa, the baby slipped out of his mother's hands into the water when she tried to hand the tsarevich to her husband (Isaac Massa, A Short History of the Beginnings and Origins of These Present Wars in Moscow under the Reign of Various Sovereigns Down to the Year 1610, trans. G. Edward Orchard [Toronto, 1982], 7). In his Vremennik, Ivan Timofeev maintains that a nursemaid accidentally dropped the baby into the water.

Peter, Aleksii, Iona, Sergius of Radonezh, and Nikita of Pereslavl during this pilgrimage.68 Anastasiia's eventual pregnancy was attributed to St. Nikita of Pereslavl, at whose shrine the tsar and tsaritsa had prayed: And from there they came to Pereslavl. There they were at the healing grave of the blessed Nikita and crossed themselves at his true chains and prayed for offspring, without doubting and with faith, with tears and a contrite heart, and they addressed St. Nikita as a hopeful intercessor before God. The kind God with his servant's prayers immediately took the sorrow from their hearts and caused them to be joyful as if he had brought them a hope- ful message. On that day they went into the town of Pereslavl and joyfully rested in their royal house, and there the tsaritsa conceived in her womb.69 Timofeev maintains that the royal visit to St. Nikita's shrine occurred on the return from Beloozero.70 According to Kurbskii the royal couple set out on their pilgrimage three or four weeks after Easter.71 Ivan Ivanovich's birth on 28 March 1554 implies that he was conceived in late June or early July 1553, which falls within the chronological boundaries of the trip to Kirillov. The child was baptized by Met- ropolitan Makarii and his future successor, Afanasii, at the shrine of the miracle- worker Aleksii in the Chudov Monastery, where Afanasii was protopop at the time.72 The connection of the two ecclesiastics with the royal baptism and Aleksii's relics, and Afanasii's authorship of chapter 19 of the vita of Nikita of Pereslavl,73 make the two men major promoters of the myth of the tsaritsa's blessed womb. The tsar's family continued to foster the cult of St. Nikita in the years following the tsarevich's birth. In the fall of 1557, Ivan IV, Anastasiia, and their son Ivan undertook a pilgrimage to the saint's shrine. The royal couple richly endowed the monastery of St. Nikita, ordered the building of walls around the monastic complex, and urged the introduction of the cenobitic life.74 The myth of St. Nikita's blessing of the royal womb survived Anastasiia Ro- manovna. Ivan IV's second marriage to Mariia Temriukovna also suffered from problems of infertility. In March 1563, two years after her marriage, Mariia finally gave birth to a baby boy, Vasilii, but the child died within two months.75 Her preoc- 68 Ibid., fol. 23v. Stokl points out that since the 1470s the metropolitan saint Iona enjoyed the same reputation as the miracle-workers Peter and Aleksii ("Staat und Kirche," 490).

Chapter 19 is also included in the said chronicle. Since Afanasii was born in Pereslavl, it appears that he was responsible for linking the myth of the tsaritsa's miraculous birth with one of his hometown saints (see Slovar' knizhnikov i knizhnosti Drevnei Rusi.

After distributing alms among the monks, she asked the abbot to pray for the health of the royal family. Then the tsaritsa added, "And foremost you must implore the Lord God, his pure Mother, the great Russian miracle-workers, and the blessed miracle-worker Nikita that God may give us the fruit of the womb for the succession of our realm."77 The story seems to have been based on a historical incident. According to the nineteenth-century historian K. Tikhonravov, a white stone plate on the porch of the church of the martyr saint Nikita in the Nikitskii Monastery commemorated the ded- ication of the church on 14 May 1564. The inscription mentions that the tsar, who attended the celebration with his wife Mariia and his son Ivan, sang the liturgy in the church and donated three villages to the brothers at a banquet. The tsar and his son also prayed at St. Nikita's tomb and placed tapestries on it. The hegumen then accompanied the two to the monastic gate. Mariia Temriukovna is said to have left separately.78 The incident demonstrates Mariia's familiarity with the notion that St. Nikita could inspire the miraculous conception of royal offspring. It is conceivable that Met- ropolitan Afanasii, who accompanied the royal family on the trip to Pereslavl, brought the myth to her attention.79 Afanasii had prepared Mariia Temriukovna for her baptism before her marriage to Ivan.80 Since he had also been Ivan IV's confessor, it is possible that he continued to be involved with her religious instruction.81 Mariia's interest in the cult of St. Nikita lasted for several years; one of her pilgrimages in December 1565 included another visit to Pereslavl.82 The period from Mariia's death in 1569 to the end of Ivan the Terrible's reign in 1584 was marked by great dynastic turmoil, resulting from Ivan's numerous un- canonical marriages and the violent death of the tsarevich Ivan. Little is known about Ivan IV's later spouses, all of whom concluded their lives in a monastery. With the exception of the last wife, Mariia Nagaia, none produced children. The church, which rejected all of Ivan's later unions, was not likely to view these women as vessels of the Divine.83 However, the vita of Kornilii Komel'skii, which was composed in 1589 by the monk Nafanail, proves that the myth of the tsaritsa's blessed womb survived 76Ibid., 383. 77BAN, Sobranie Petra Pervogo, A 37, fols. 37-37v. 78 K.

His wife Irina, like her prede- cessors, took recourse to the myth of miraculous royal birth to buy time and instill a sense of confidence that a successful pregnancy was still possible. In July 1585, Fedor Ivanovich urged his wife to attend the translation of St. Sergius's relics to a new shrine and to pray to the saint for children. Irina willingly consented and un- dertook the pilgrimage to the Trinity Sergius Monastery on foot.90 Irina's belief in Sergius's ability to inspire miraculous births is also pointed out by Giles Fletcher: The Empress that now is hath many vows to St. Sergius, that is patron there, to entreat him to make her fruitful, as having no children by the Emperor her Husband. Lightly every year she goeth on pilgrimage to him from the Moscow on foot, about eighty English miles, with five or six thousand women attending upon her, all in blue liveries, and four thousand soldiers for her guard. But St. Sergius hath not yet heard her prayers, though they say he hath a special gift and faculty that way.91 The Trinity Sergius Monastery played a major role in perpetuating the notion that St. Sergius would be able to bring about Irina's pregnancy. The inscription on an icon depicting the Appearance of the Virgin to St. Sergius, which the monastery's cellarer, Evstafii Golovkin, painted in 1588, contains a prayer for the health and fertility of the royal couple.92 Another icon of St. Sergius by Golovkin, dating from 1591, was dedicated to the saint to implore him to grant Fedor and Irina health and offspring.93 84 The date of the vita is included in Tulup's chet'i minei, in GBL, f. 304.

It is possible that the reference to Elena's birth with the help of a saint was designed to underscore the legitimacy of the Rurikide dynasty in 1589, when Russia under Fedor Ivanovich faced another dynastic crisis. On the other hand, Nafanail might have used the theme to elevate the saint's prestige. 90 PSRL 29:218 (Aleksandro-Nevskaia chronicle).

Suddenly an angel of God appeared and announced to her that God would grant her a child. This story in the apocryphal gospel of James 1-4:2 enjoyed great popularity in medieval Russia.96 Patriarch Iov also encouraged Irina to emulate Hannah, the mother of the prophet Samuel, who conceived miraculously as a result of her steadfast prayers.97 Most of all, however, he urged Irina to put her faith in the Virgin Mary, who was known to help women with fertility problems. She could intercede with Christ on Irina's behalf and make her a "fertile vine" in her house.98 According to the Aleksandro-Nevskaia chronicle, Irina indeed implored the Virgin directly to in- tercede for her fertility: And you, all-merciful and generous strong supporter of the Christian race, tsaritsa and mistress, mother of the heavenly tsar and Lord, immaculate Mother of God, hear the prayer of your servant, pray to our Christ God, who was born from you, that he will give us the fruit of the womb with your intercession and prayers, my mistress.99 The appearance of the myth of the blessed royal womb in Muscovite Russia is thus closely connected with the precarious dynastic position of the tsars' wives, which was dependent on their reproductive ability. To achieve greater social stability the tsaritsy in the sixteenth century sought to shift the attention from the child as the desired product to their own bodies, where the mystery of childbirth and the will of the Divine were revealed. By emphasizing a special relationship between the royal mother and the supernatural, the tsaritsy fostered a mystique which elevated the prestige of both the queen mother and the future ruler. In the process the tsaritsy exploited the flexibility of the myth with regard to the agent of their miraculous conception. In their hopes to produce an heir to the throne they compared them- selves to biblical women who had experienced a miraculous conception. Some of 94The unpublished letter is contained in a miscellany of the Tolstoi collection, GPB, O.IV 17, fols. 10-29v. The miscellany contains documents pertaining to the transfer of the reign from Fedor Ivanovich to Boris Godunov via Boris's sister Irina. Feodosiia Fedorovna was born in 1592, three years after Irina's marriage to Fedor Ivanovich (S. F Platonov, Ocherki po istorii smuty v Moskovskom gosudarstve XVI- XVII vv. [Moscow, 1937], 153). She died in January 1594 and was buried in the Monastery of the Ascension in the Kremlin.

Moreover, the royal wives expanded the cult of the miracle-working protector saints of the Muscovite grand princes by adding a new specialization, the protection of the royal womb, to their repertoire of powers. In addition to their traditional role as supporters of the tsar's political success, these saints were now appreciated for assuring the continuity of the ruling dynasty. The affirmation of a holy man's capacity to inspire miraculous births by the tsaritsy added a new, gender-specific dimension to the saint's cult. The myth of the tsaritsa's ability to conceive miraculously appealed particularly to the Muscovite ecclesiastical leadership, which sought to portray the Russian ruler as a divinely blessed leader of the Orthodox world. Ecclesiastics, notably Makarii, Afanasii and Iov, became the primary promoters of the spiritualization of the tsar- itsa's role. As priests and confessors they participated in royal baptisms and provided spiritual instruction to the tsar's family. These duties allowed them both to become acquainted with the Muscovite queens' idea of miraculous conception and to rein- force their belief in the myth. The literary expression of the notion of the tsaritsa's blessed womb in such works as the Stepennaia kniga helped anchor the myth in the Muscovite cultural consciousness. We gain a better understanding of the status of the Muscovite tsaritsy if we inquire into the meaning of their existence and the construction of this meaning. A study of the tsaritsy's role as mothers in the sixteenth century shows that although the royal women's social position was endangered by political demands for an heir, they were able to develop methods of coping with their task. By promoting the cult of saints who displayed sensitivity toward the tsaritsy's fertility concerns, the Mus- covite queens gained some control over social expectations and enhanced their own dynastic legitimacy and image. In this context the tsaritsy's devotion to the miracle- workers not only followed the customary pattern of patronage of saintly intercessors, but also represented a way for women's self-definition.</page></plain_text>
