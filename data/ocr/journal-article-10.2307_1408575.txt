<plain_text><page sequence="1">Christian Faith, and Religion, in Eric Voegelin's Work Gerhart Niemeyer This article examines three important texts in which Eric Voegelin discusses the Christian Faith. While it is true that one finds no personal confession of faith in Voegelin's works, one nevertheless finds there an extraordinary openess to the experiential truth expressed in Christian Symbols. The gentle reader may have noted that the word "Christianity" is missing in the title, and may have wondered whether there is a reason for this. There is, indeed. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, Christianity is a term used with several meanings: (1) the whole body of Christians; (2) the religion of Christ, the Christian faith; (3) state or fact of being a Christian; (4) ecclesiastic jurisdiction. Since discussing Eric Voegelin's views on these and related realities demands that we distinguish and conceptualize with great philosophical discipline, we would do well to avoid such ambiguous notions. We begin, then, by noting that Voegelin's thoughts about Christian faith are one thing, and his position on Christian religion, or any organized religion, another; focusing our attention first on the Christian faith, in Voegelin's work. Moreover, for the purpose of this article, we are not focusing on all parts of Voegelin's work that deal with the nexus between faith and reason, or religion and philosophy. One can deal with these questions objectively, scientifically. We are more interested with passages from which some inferences may be possible about Voegelin's own experiences, and beliefs, regarding Jesus Christ and his Church. Therefore, while fully acknowledging the great power of such texts as "The Gospel and Culture," "Immortality: Experience and Symbol," "Response to Professor Altizer's 'A New History and a New but Ancient God,"' also "The Beginning and the Beyond: A Meditation on Truth,"2 I shall concentrate on 1.

The later essays, "Immortality," and "The Gospel and Culture" contain no new texts relevant to our question. The September 1943 letter to Schuetz is found in the German version3 while the American version4 has a chapter, "Remem- brance of Things Past" that was specially written for this book. Here Voegelin mentions his motives at the time of the letters: The answer I attempted in 1943 emerged from long years of occupation with Husserl's phenomenology, and equally long years of discussion with Alfred Schuetz about its merits and limitations....Our discussions came to a head when, in the summer of 1943, I was at last able to obtain a copy of Husserl's Krise der Europaeischen Wissenschaften.... In this essay, Husserl elaborated on the motivations of his own work by placing it in the context of a philosophical history. In his conception, the history of man's reason had three phases: (1) a prehistory, of no particular interest to the philosopher, ending with the Greek foundation of philosophy; (2) a phase beginning with the Greek Urstiftung, the primordial foundation of philosophy, that was interrupted by the Christian thinkers but then renewed by Descartes, and reached up to Husserl; and (3) a last phase, beginning with the apodiktische Anfang, the 'apodictic beginning' set by his own work, and going on forever into the future within the 'horizon of apodictic continuation' of his phenomenology.... I was horrified because I could not help recognizing the all-too familiar type of phase construction in which had indulged the Enlightenment philosophes and after them, Comte, Hegel, and Marx ... with the purpose of abolishing a 'past history' of mankind and letting the 'true history' begin with the respective author's own work. I had to recognize it as one of the violently restrictive visions of existence that, on the level of pragmatic action, surrounded me from all sides ... in the form of Communism, National Socialism, Fascism, and the Second World War. Voegelin's decision is put separately, in a two-sentence para- graph: "Something had to be done. I had to get out of that 'apodictic horizon' as fast as possible."5 3.

Voegelin's letter of September 1943 was his first step of the "getting out" he mentions above. He dwells on the manhandling of history: "(Husserl's) relevant his- tory of mankind consists of the Greek antiquity and the modern time since the Renaissance. Hellenism, Christendom, the Middle Ages-an unimportant period of more than two thousand years- are a superfluous interlude; the Indians and the Chinese (Husserl puts them in quotation marks) are a slightly ridiculous curio at the periphery of the earth-disk, in the center of which stands Western man - man as such."6 Here we have one of the two or three powerful motives for Voegelin's philosophy of order: his sarcastic language indicates blazing anger at a view that excludes from the history of the human mind more than two thousand years as if they had never happened. That period embraced such men as Dionysius the Areopagite, John Scotus Erigena, Anselm of Canterbury, Siger of Brabant, Thomas Aquinas. In his work Voegelin did indeed bring these men, their historical period and their thought, to our attention. In that same letter, however, he begins this endeavor by showing that Descartes, Husserl's Urstifter, primordial founder of philosophical newness, or new philosophy, had some of his roots in the Christian Middle Ages. "The meditation of Descartes," he said, "is not as staggeringly new as Husserl believes. Descartes's meditation is in principle a Christian meditation in the tradi- tional style; one can even classify it more precisely as a medita- tion of the Augustinian type, as it has been conducted hundreds of times in the history of the Christian spirit since Augustine. The anonymous author of the Cloud of Unknowing has formulated the classical theme of meditation as well as any other thinker: 'It is needful for thee to bury in a cloud of forgetting all creatures that ever God made, that thou mayest direct thine intent to God Himself.' The annihilation of the world's content per gradus from the bodily world to the soul's and so to attain the point of transcendence at which the soul, in Augustine's words, can turn its intentio to God,-that is the purpose of meditation."7 He adds later: "In the transcendence of the Augustinian intentio the I is certain of God and of itself (not in a dogmatic sense, but in the 6. Anamnesis (German), p. 22 7. Ibid., p. 33 ! ! I / 93</page><page sequence="4">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS mystical sense of transcendence into the ground)."8 Similarly Voegelin, in the New Science of Politics (1952), shows that not only Descartes but also Hobbes wanted to be a Christian thinker: Into this somewhat empty vessel of a political society Hobbes pours the Western-Christian civilizational content by letting it pass through the bottleneck of sanction by the sovereign representative." He speaks of "Hobbes' intention of establishing Christianity ... as an English theologia civilis in the Varronic sense." The attempt is flawed, though: "When (Hobbes) treats Christianity under the aspect of its substantial identity with the dictate of reason, he shows himself as oddly insensitive to its meaning as a truth of the soul as were the Patres to the meaning of the Roman gods as a truth of society.9 Eric Voegelin has not left any autobiographical statements about his religious faith. We can therefore do no better than to examine his language, as he deals in general with Christian religion. In the above texts, he (a) corrects Husserl by pointing out that Descartes's (Third) Meditation is a classical example of a Christian meditation. (b) He quotes, with strong approval, the Cloud of Unknowing which fourteenth-century work by an unknown author is the probably most eminent text of Christian mysticism. (c) He acclaims the ideas of St. Augustine, the highest ranking Christian thinker of antiquity. (d) When he speaks of the human "certainty of God and of itself (not in a dogmatic sense but in the mystical sense of transcendence into the ground (of being)," he uses a spiritual and a philosophical concept bespeaking a close relation between man and God, while (e) he calls Christian faith "a truth of the soul." This is Christian language, and the only thing that keeps us from attributing Christian faith to Voegelin is that at no point does he use such language in an auto- biographical context. Is one not moved to the conclusion that the author of these remarks, if he is not himself a Christian, is at any rate no despiser of Christian belief, as were the protagonists of the Enlightenment? Later, in volume four of Order and History, Voegelin begins to speak of "the Beginning" and "the Beyond" as the dimensions of non-thingly reality (in contrast to the cosmos), and insists, in this context, that the myth is the only symbol available to man when he needs to speak about experiences of 8.

So necessary is then the myth, that to destroy a myth should be considered a criminal activity. These insights into experiences of divine presence, and the human countermovement they require, must be borne in mind as we turn to Voegelin's letter to Schuetz of January 1953.10 In 1952, Voegelin's New Science of Politics was published. Schuetz's reaction was wholly negative: "I thought that you merely wanted to trace the immanent evolution of the transformation into immanence within Christian philosophy and from the Christian viewpoint. But further reading showed me-perhaps mistakenly-that you take your stand wholly on Christian doctrine."" Schuetz's objection then probes even deeper: "(In the New Science) it is clearly stated that the origin of gnosticism finds its explanation in the vacuum that Christianity, in the course of dedivinization, created by eliminating civil theology. ... You then say that gnostic experiment in civil theology is fraught with various dangers. The first is the tendency of gnosticism to replace, rather than complement, the truth of the soul. When gnosticism became openly anti-Christian, the truth of the open soul was destroyed wherever gnostic movements spread. ... Here I simply cannot follow you. Why should not a gnostic philosophy make possible an open soul and access to the existential truth? ... Why there cannot be, or have been, a metaphysics that preserves the open soul even without Christian eschatology?"12 Voegelin replied: "Essentially my concern with Christianity has no religious grounds at all." Here he seems to say, 'but I am not a Christian!' As for his work, he continues to point to the "impossible" omission "of the 1500 years of Christian thought and Christian politics" in historiography and philosophy. "Whatever one may think of Christianity, it cannot be treated as negligible." Then Voegelin enumerates three "very significant achievements which should not be neglected." And this philosopher, who has just remonstrated that his work "has no religious grounds," takes several pages to praise, in the most 10.

One should bear in mind that Voegelin's distaste for dogma has been stated often and with vigor. One cannot help feeling that a strong personal conviction has manifested itself here. The next item, in Voegelin's mind, anno 1943, is the problem of the myth. Again, Voegelin's anger was excited by the modem tendency to read Plato without Plato's "deliberate myths." He moves into the problem through the chapter "On the Theory of Consciousness" which he wrote soon after the September letter. Since processes transcending consciousness are not experienceable from within and since for purposes of characterizing their structures we have no other symbols available than those developed on the occasion of other finite experiences, there result conflicts of expression. These are, if not the only one, still the most important root of the formation of myths. A mythical symbol is a finite symbol supposed to provide 'transpar- ence' for a transfinite process. Examples: a myth of creation, which renders transparent the problem of the beginning of a transfinite pro- cess of the world; an immaculate conception, which mediates the expe- rience of a transfinite spiritual beginning; an anthropomorphic image of God, which finitizes an experience of transcendence; speculations about the pre-existence or post-existence of the soul, which provide a finite formula for the beyond of birth and death; the fall and original sin, which illuminate the mystery of finite existence through procre- ation and death, and so on."13 In other words, the areas of non-thingly reality which Voegelin mentions can be intellectually ordered only by myths, but these myths have a decidedly rational function in that they provide an acceptable order through views of ultimate realities, which in turn makes possible rational thought on realities of nature and society. None of the quoted passages from Voegelin's works amounts to a confession of Christian faith on the part of Eric Voegelin. Yet, if one remembers that these are scholarly texts (even the letters) one must be profoundly astonished at the inner freedom with which Voegelin can speak of God and Christian dogmas. Let us remember the type of statements which for more than a century have defined the attitude of scholars toward such realities: "No 13. Anamnesis (English), p. 21 f. 96</page><page sequence="7">CHRISTIAN FAITH AND VOEGELIN intelligent man in this age of the world will for a moment maintain that there is any truth in Christianity"; "The attitude of the college toward the modem spirit of inquiry, proposes to be guided by reason rather than by faith"; "It is all a 'mere prejudice,' so we might as well rid ourselves of prejudice as of religion." (I take the quotations, which are fully representative, from an article in First Things.4) Against this general background, Voegelin's manner of speaking about Christianity sounds almost like a Christian sermon. All the same, it is no personal confession of faith. If it were that, it would look out of place in a scholarly work and have had no effect whatever on contemporary scholarship. What is does convey is Voegelin's denial of a hostile quarrel between faith and reason. Christian dogmas are myths but so is a concept of the "I." Consciousness is capable of transcending itself and nature, and concepts regarding "the transcendence" are needed for the fundamental "certainties" which undergird judgments about immediate and concrete realities. There does seem to be a restless curiosity regarding Voegelin's personal faith which is likely to obscure a full awareness of Voegelin's enormous achievement in having restored to science the ability rationally to look on God, myths, and dogmas of faith. The great letters between Schuetz and Voegelin obviously are based on the assumptions of scholarly search and findings, the limit of which bars such content and form as would be germane to a sermon. Thus, if Voegelin, particularly in the 1953 letter to Schuetz, appears to treat Christian faith with the full understand- ing of one who shares it, one may at times wonder whether professional detachment has not put any permanent obstacles in the way of faith. One should remember Goethe who, without being a Christian, could say: "Let the natural sciences grow in ever wider expansion and profundity, and the human mind enlarge itself as much as it wants, it will never get any higher than the loftiness and ethical culture of Christianity, as it glistens and shines in the Gospels!"15 14.

III 97</page><page sequence="8">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS The last paragraph of Israel and Revelation, however, looks somewhat different in this respect. Its relevant part reads as follows: A prayer of such intenseness as the Nunc dimittis of Luke 2:29-34 cannot be explained as literary reminiscence; it belongs to the tradition of the Deutero-Isaiah. And the preoccupation with the problem of the Suffer- ing Servant is attested by the story of Acts 8: The Ethiopian eunuch of the queen, sitting on his cart and reading Isaiah, ponders on the pas- sage: "Like a sheep he was led away to the slaughter." He inquires of Philip: "Tell me, of whom is the prophet speaking? of himself, or of someone else?" Then Philip began, reports the historian of the Apostles, and starting from this passage he told him the good news about Jesus.'6 Voegelin, habitually, used the King James version of the trans- lated Bible. When we check there the "History of the Apostles," we find these words: "Then Philip opened his mouth, and begin- ning at this Scripture, preached Jesus to him" (Acts 8: 35). Should we conclude then that of "the good news of" was Voegelin's own initiative, or that he, at this point, was working with a different translation? Both are possible. If the former should be the truth, we would have here another manifestation-which, indeed, would be a very important one-of Voegelin's own feelings. One might then be inclined to ask: "Of whom does Voegelin speak, of himself or of some other man?" We have covered the three areas in Voegelin's work which I have characterized as loci classici regarding the topic of the Christian faith in Voegelin's writings. Volume four of Order and History, however, contains Voegelin's treatment of the Fourth Gospel (in the "Introduction"), and the Letters of St. Paul, in chapter 5. We must briefly look at these passages, for volume four (The Ecumenic Age) occupies a place of its own, prominent not only among the five volumes but among all other books of Voegelin. The "Introduction" is a 58-page essay that essentially corrects all hitherto conceived views of the history of philosophy, including that of Eric Voegelin himself. It covers the vast stretch of time from the beginning of the Persian Empire until the end of the Roman Empire, a period of imperial conquest and the 16. Order and History, vol. I, Israel and Revelation (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1956), p. 515. 98</page><page sequence="9">CHRISTIAN FAITH AND VOEGELIN syncretistic spirituality that developed under its political pressures. Voegelin has characterized it as a period in which the awareness of divine order generally contracted into personal experience, while the creator-god evolved into the redeemer- god. If we have not dealt with these passages before, it is because Voegelin's emphasis here is more on his own theoretical concepts than on the content of the Christian faith. He has named this entire process "the loss of balance between the Beginning and the Beyond." Voegelin clearly saw the difficulties emerging from this development, since "there is no language in the abstract by which men can refer to the hierophanic events of the noetic and pneumatic differentiations, but only the concrete language created in the articulation of the event." The mystic experiences are the real core, the language articulating the experiences must be taken at face value; the difficulties begin with the creation of language to meet other needs, either those of institutionalized religion, or those of a political whole. The difficulties left their permanent results in history: "A new intellectual game with imaginary realities in an imaginary realm of thought, the game of propositional metaphysics, has been opened with world-historic consequences that reach into our own present." Among other consequences was the creation of the term religio by Cicero, also the "further development of Scripture, as when (Israel) superimposed the word of Scripture over the word of god." Voegelin is fully aware that his superimposition was practically needed for protection "against the pressure of competing wisdom in the multi-civilizational society." The undesired legacy, however, is, in Voegelin's eyes, "the separation of symbol from the concrete experience of God (which) can degenerate into a word of man that one can believe or not." Finally, Voegelin notes "the expansion of the Word from the immediate experience of the Beyond to the mediated experience of the Beginning," through which, Voegelin observes, there could, and did, develop a misunderstanding of man's "imaginative ability ... as a power to bring the Beginning under the control of consciousness." In these brief remarks about the character of Voegelin's great "Introduction" to volume four one can discern Voegelin's ac- knowledgment of the experience of God and its inevitable link I 99</page><page sequence="10">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS with rational reasoning. One feels that Voegelin understands because he shares this experience. It is the sharing, by one present mystic, of the experiences of other mystics. It is the awareness of the reality of God's presence, in variegated forms, across centu- ries and millennia. It is the emphasis, by a mystic philosopher of today, of the full height and width of the reality human con- sciousness has tried to comprehend. This is all that can be said about Voegelin's faith, in the context of the "Introduction" to The Ecumenic Age. If this strikes the gentle reader as too abstract, let him acknowledge that Voegelin, at no time and no place, has ever critically diminished the full reality of Jesus Christ. There is, besides the Introduction, another place in volume four of Order and History, where Voegelin deals with Christianity: chapter 5, "The Pauline Vision of the Resurrected." It so happens that I wrote an extensive critique of volume four,17 of which the part dealing with chapter 5, has been widely reproduced. Even though my criticism, were it written today, would be somewhat milder, I shall simply reproduce the 1976 text: The treatment strikes me as unsatisfactory on a number of counts. The title is misleading, since 'the vision' is the entire "speculation" of St. Paul as analyzed by Voegelin, leaving out of consideration the single, brief vision on the road to Damascus which was Paul's en- counter with the person of Jesus Christ.... Apart from the problems of "the historical Jesus," the facticity of Jesus himself separates Chris- tian theology as a type from all myths and philosophical specula- tions. Since Voegelin points out that Plato's myth was an alethinos logos, a true story, he should have allowed a special category also for St. Paul's story.... Christianity ... was born from spiritual amazement about a particular person Jesus, his deeds, teachings, and such claims as that men in order to gain their lives must lose them for his sake, that it will be he whom men will face in the ultimate judgments, that there will be a new covenant with God in his blood, that he would die to free humanity from sin, that he alone had full knowledge of the Father. Christian theology, then stems ... from the question which Jesus himself put: 'Who do you say I am?" ... Voegelin allows that Paul shows that man is a creature in whom God can incarnate himself. St. Paul, however, reflects on what it means that God did incarnate himself in one particular man at one particular time. His speculations are about the consequences of this 'mighty deed' of 17.

This may be the proper place for some personal episodes which would not be mentioned if Eric Voegelin's language on these occasions might not possibly throw some light on the question of this article. When the above quoted critique of volume four appeared, an American professor and friend of Voegelin's attacked me, in Voegelin's presence. Voegelin rejected his sharp words, saying: "Let it be; this is a personal problem." Could Voegelin have meant that his personal problem was an inability to embrace the Christian faith with a personal surrender? Furthermore when I, four years later, was ordained a priest in the Episcopal Church, Voegelin called me and congratulated me with some remarks among which the word, "admiration," was particularly striking. If he "admired" my ordination would that not be the reaction of someone who recognizes that he, personally, could not have taken such a step? Finally, ever since I got to know Voegelin, in 1947, I have heard him speak of himself as "a Christian," later with the qualification, "a pre-Reformation Christian," and still later, as a "pre-Nicaean Christian." The meaning of "pre-Reformation Christian" is clear. "Pre-Nicaean" can only be a Christian of the age in which great dogmas were evolved without the action of any church council. This last qualification expresses Voegelin's uneasiness about "propositional metaphysics," and "propositional theology." Human knowledge of things can, and must be put in the form of propositions. Regarding that reality which consists not of things, however, insights stem from inner-based experiences and can be represented only by language the experience itself has generated or, otherwise, by a kind of myth assimilable to other symbols of faith and knowledge. The temptation to mistake such insight for a proposition about things must be strongly resisted. Let us now see to what conclusions the above findings may justifiably lead us. First, "the problem of God" does not seem to Voegelin to be more-or-less of a problem than the reality of one's neighbor. The divine reality as such neither requires nor is com- prehensible though analytical argument: "Drawing on Israelite, Christian, and Hellenic sources, the symbolization of the struc- 101</page><page sequence="12">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS ture can be concentrated in the formula: The divine reality, the theotes of Colossians 2:9-that moves man's consciousness from the Beyond of all cosmic contents, from the epekeina in Plato's sense-also creates and sustains the cosmos from its Beginning, from the bereshit in the sense of Genesis 1:1."18 In other words, not the reality as such but rather the symbolization of the reality contains difficulties. Attention is drawn to the fact that this real- ity is not subject to discovery, or verification by the senses, like things are. It is a matter of inner experience. If not by all, the experience by some has found acceptance as epiphany by the many. "In this [i.e., the Israelite background] environment, the primary experience of the cosmos has been shaken at an early date by Moses' experience and symbolization of divine reality as the 'I am' of the Thornbush Episode. The experience brings the deeper stratum of divine reality, its absolute Being, into immedi- ate view."19 This reality content of the inner experience also applies to Christian faith: "The god who spoke to Moses in the Thornbush now speaks through the mouth of man to other men.... The 'I am' in Jesus, on the other hand, reveals itself as the living presence of the word in a man ...(it will) for every man who responds to its appeal, dissolve the darkness and absurdity of existence into the luminous consciousness of participating in the divine word."20 Voegelin puts himself into sharp contrast with so many contemporary philosophers or historians who seek to put Christianity on the same plane as other great religions by not mentioning Jesus as the core of Christian faith. Even here does Voegelin not mean to say: "I believe." Yet, in all his work he has not with such deep and correct understanding presented the substance of any other religion. One should also insist that here, as in all other similar passages, there is no trace of a nominalistic, psychoanalytical, or sociological explanation of this, or other spiritual phenomena, in Voegelin. Nor does he leave the matter as a series of historical phenomena of which each may be as good as any other. In other words, there is spiritual truth, even though it cannot be something 18. Order and History, vol. IV, The Ecumenic Age (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1974), p. 9. 19. Ibid., p. 12. 20. Ibid., p. 14. 102</page><page sequence="13">CHRISTIAN FAITH AND VOEGELIN found attained by measurement or experiment. Light on this problem can be found in philosophy as well as in religion: "(Plato) is aware of the limits set to the philosopher's exploration of reality by the divine mystery of the noetic height and the apeirontic depth. Since the philosopher cannot transcend these limits but has to move in the In-Between ... the meaning of his work depends on an ambiance of insight concerning the divine presence and operation in the cosmos that only the myth can provide. Plato's answer to the predicament is the creation of the alethinos logos, the story of the gods that can claim to be true if it fits the cognitive consciousness of order created in the soul of man by the erotic tension toward the divine Beyond."21 Voegelin's insight here is cast in the form of his own concepts, of which one can only say, "why have they been missing for so long?" The first one, the "In- Between," of course stems from Plato's Symposium, but no thinker before Voegelin has tried to give it common coinage. "In-Between" is certainly the character of human existence where it is matter of spiritual experience, and awareness of this fact will then justify such symbols of truth as "the myth." Clearly, Voegelin sees reason and faith as a continuum. Again, there are myths conveying truth, and there are other myths, for example, the Nazi myth of race as the key to human character. The criterion of mythical truth is provided by a consciousness filled with the loving tension toward God. Who, understanding this Platonic formula, could reject it by the argument that it did not come from the Bible? Possibly one might object that "the loving tension toward God" is an inner phenomenon that cannot be tested by other people. But Voegelin provides also an outside criterion present in public life: "The immediate presence of the movements in the soul requires the revelatory language of consciousness. This is the language of seeking, searching and questioning, of ignorance and knowledge concerning the divine ground, of fertility, absurdity, anxiety, and alienation of existences, of being moved to see and question, of being drawn toward the ground, of turning around, illumination, and rebirth."22 In other words, the experiences and the language of symbolization alike are right if both fit the "In-Between" situation of man. Any language that 21. Ibid., p. 11. 22. Ibid., pp. 17-18. I 103</page><page sequence="14">104 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS ignores this condition, as it trumpets certainties and denies ignorance and conversion, cannot be a voice from the "In- Between" human soul. Those who still, at this point, are impatiently waiting for a judgment on Voegelin's personal confession of faith should be sent to the four o'clock session of tattling and gossiping, where they will undoubtedly hear something that for a time will satisfy their idle curiosity.</page></plain_text>
