<plain_text><page sequence="1">Amphibians and their Ways by H. Rucker Smyth; 292 pages; $6.50; The Macmillan Company, 1962. Not many writers are able to deal entertainingly and accurately with biological subjects. George Gaylord Simpson, Marston Bates, and Rachel Carson are among the gifted few. But if biologists find it difficult to abandon their technical jargon and shift to a style acceptable to the general reader, amateur naturalists with literary am bitions seldom write in terms acceptable to the biologist. Unsophisticated readers eager to learn something about frogs and salamanders will conceivably appreciate the chatty, unpretentious, personal style a Connecticut housewife employs in this book. Amateur naturalists may not be disturbed when they read that during the courtship of salamanders "it is the male's object to make himself ir resistible to the female." The student of animal behavior, however, may wince at this, or shudder to note that the male "may even invite her to a dance if that is the accepted thing with this particular species." In the ponderous rhetoric of the specialist the female salamander responds to visual or olfactory stimuli, but in the less inhibited lingo of Mrs. Smyth, the female must be " in a re ceptive frame of mind" if she is to pick up the packet of sperm that will fertilize her eggs. As an enthusiastic amateur naturalist Mrs. Smyth probably read the dozen authoritative books on amphibians she lists with other references in a short bibliography. Unfortunately, some of these were written several decades ago, and Mrs. Smyth evidently does not realize that what a competent authority writes one year may be outmoded the next. Consequently, a fair amount of the information in Mrs. Smyth's account is THE ONLY independent journal of opinion in the field, and by far the oldest in the U.S.A. THE ONLY magazine that offers more than reviews? comparisons! THE ONLY pocket-size high fidelity publication that in cludes authoritative articles, careful reviews of hi-fi equipment, the most scrupulous coverage of classical releases, and special columns on spoken word, jazz, pop and folk music by recognized specialists. THE ONLY magazine of its kind that can be obtained solely by subscription in most cities.

Anyone familiar with the literature will be amazed to note that at times she raises questions when she should have provided answers. There is no reason why a housewife who is familiar with the local amphib bians, especially if she has Mrs. Smyth's enthusiasm for her subject, and who has access to a good library, might not write a good book. It might be more readable than one written by the harried specialist. Mrs. Smyth would have been more prudent, however, had she asked someone with the insight and understanding of the specialist to read her manuscript. Readers undisturbed by her anthropomorphic phraseology will be distracted if not puzzled when they read that an eel-like salamander has "external gills and lungs.'7 They may bog down completely when she adds that the same salamander has "four toes, ranging in size from 6 to 36 inches." It is inexcusable for any book to be so liberally sprinkled with such egregious errors. With more knowledgeable and judicious editing the text might well bave provided information with con siderable appeal to the amateur naturalist.?Charles M. Bogert</page></plain_text>
