<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sisters in Spirit: Mormon Women in Historical and Cultural Perspective. Ed. by Maureen Ur- senbach Beecher and Lavina Fielding Ander- son. (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1987. xxi + 281 pp. $21.95.) The immediate effect of this collection of es- says and poems by faithful Mormon female scholars is to gainsay the egregious sentiments of one Rodney Turner who concurred with the</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 1321 doggerel asserting that women were merely "'doormats.... they keep their men from go- ing in with Muddy feet to God."' These profes- sional historians, theologians, counselors, and teachers have deeply mined the rich primary sources of their past to produce compelling in- tellectual and social history. What is simultane- ously impressive and disconcerting about these scholars is that their conclusions are well argued but demure ones that imply a tacit acceptance of the patriarchy of which they are willing and devoted constituents. Moreover, publication by the University of Illinois Press, rather than un- der the imprimatur of their own institution, illustrates that their scholarly opinions are still undervalued by the Latter-day Saint male hi- erarchy. A unifying theme in these essays is that "sisterhood" a bond between Mormon wom- en forged by common history, experiences, and goals - has persisted, with change, through time. Piqued by previous questions that emerged in informal meetings, these benevo- lent critics rediscovered what they consider to be their radical past. Present Victorian models for their behavior and purpose in the Mormon church not withstanding, Carol Cornwall Mad- sen, Linda King Newell, Jill Mulvay Derr, and Linda Wilcox found women's roles in the early Mormon church not only centered in the home and child care; they were equally involved in religious leadership, sacred ritual, and in sup- portive networks for their own sex. They ascer- tained inJoseph Smith, the original Mormon, a person who stressed male and female equali- ty. He created the Nauvoo Relief Society in which women were "ordained" and "set apart" as leaders, and to which he turned over the "key" of authority to minister. Some of these women functioned as priestesses in Mormon temples and participated in both charismatic and ritu- al healings. Smith and other Mormon leaders also articulated an anthropomorphic godhead that implied a Heavenly Mother as well as Fa- ther. More than this, polygamous marriages in- advertently contributed to broad, supportive networks in the Mormon community, develop- ing strong women who ran businesses and farms and who worked with and for the suffragist movement. In the last third of the nineteenth century the Latter-day Saint church, then seeking Vic- torian respectability, forsook its earlier practices and espoused a centralized, bureaucratic, male priesthood as the instrument to that end. In that context, the Mormon woman became the dutiful wife who was expected to regard mother- hood as her raison d'etre. Other disparate themes supportive of this one emerged in the essays. Joleen Edmunds Rockwood observed in the ancient metaphori- cal texts of Genesis 1-3 a figurative Eve who was one equal side of Haazdam (Humankind). The cursed figure in the story was not Eve, but the serpent. In a related survey of literature sa- cred to Mormons, Melodie Moench Charles con- cluded that "the most attractive scriptural con- cepts of women have yet to be incorporated into Mormonism." Linda Wilcox depicted twentieth- century Mormon leaders J. Reuben Clark, Jr., and Ezra Taft Benson extolling the virtues of home, motherhood, and housework for women in words and values that recapitulated the nine- teenth-century "Cult of True Womanhood"' a transcendentalization of the mundane. The crucial point elicited by these authors is contained in the foreword drafted by Jan Shipps, one of the non-Mormon deans of Mor- mon history: "the question of the full extent of free agency in Mormonism.... While LDS men may be free so that in Adam's fall they did not all sin, LDS women continue to suffer the curse of Eve and consequently are consigned the tasks connected with eternal motherhood." This conclusion is well illustrated by Sisters in Spirit. The writers ingenuously document a Mormon past in which their earlier sisters oc- cupied more dynamic and vital positions in their church and culture, ones that were preempted by an allegedly benevolent patriarchy. The via- bility of that patriarchy is evident in the reti- cence of these writers to make even stronger, more poignant judgments about their past and present. Nonetheless, it is the most significant book of its genre in Mormon history to appear in recent years. To most non-Mormon histori- ans, it may seem that these writers have merely documented the obvious; to Mormon histori- ans, this book represents a courageous and need- ed effort and is evidence that sisterhood lives still.
