<plain_text><page sequence="1">FOREORDAINED FROM ALL ETERNITY The Mystery of the Incarnation According to Some Early Christian and Byzantine Writers BOGDAN G.BUCUR Introduction In his Handbook of Spiritual Counsel, Nicodemus Hagior ites (1749-1809) published an addendum titled "Apology for My Note on Our Lady the Theotokos in the Book Unseen Warfare? wherein he argues forcefully that God foreordained the Incarnation from eternity, indepen dently of the Fall.1 The Handbook itself is also quite clear about this idea. Drawing on Maximus the Confessor's^/ Thalassium 60, Nicodemus writes, "[The Incarnation] is the end toward which all the creatures were from the beginning destined and created in time_This is to be understood in the sense of the preceding will of God and not in the sense of the subsequent will of God. God cre ated the essences of the beings with this end in mind_ This is the mystery that describes all the ages and which reveals the great will of God that preexisted infinitely all the ages."2 It is not the purpose of this paper to discuss Nicodemus's own theological argumentation, or that of other post-Byzantine authors quoted in the "Apology," such as George Koressios or Elias Miniates. I note only that Nicodemus expresses his confidence of speaking in full accord with the witness of Scripture (he refers to Proverbs 8:22, Colossians 1:15, and Romans 8:29) and the patristic tradition.3 Some modern scholars, however, consider the idea of the Incarnation as foreordained from all eternity to be nothing more than a theologoumenon?a fascinating idea perhaps, but quite an isolated doctrine in certain Byzantine authors, if not a peculiarity of Maximus the Confessor. John Meyendorff, for instance, sees Maximus s doctrine of the "Incarnation as a precondition of the final glorification, independent of man s sinfulness and corrup tion" as "the major and, apparently, the only exception" in Byzantine theology.4 According to Georges Florovsky, "the problem of the relation between the mystery of the Incarnation and the original purpose of Creation was not touched upon by the Fathers... systematically," Maximus being "the only Father who was directly concerned with the problem."5 More recently Jean-Claude Larchet stated the same opinion: "[N]i Jean Damasc?ne, ni Nicholas Cabasilas, ni Gr?goire Palamas n'ont cette conception. Aucun P?re oriental pr?d?cesseur ou contemporain de Maxime ne semble avoir affirm? cat?goriquement que l'Incarnation aurait eu lieu m?me si le p?ch? n'e?t pas existe. 0 I dedicate this work to the Rev. Dr. Doru Costache, my former teacher at the University of Bucharest, whose seminar on Maximus the Confessor remains my most beautiful memory of those study years. I am indebted to my Doktorvater at Marquette University, Fr. Alexander Golitzin, for his patience, trust, and constant encouragement. Many thanks are also due to Dr. Paul Blowers, who took the time to read a draft of the section on Maximus, and provided helpful criticism. I remain, of course, solely responsible for all errors. 1 "The mystery of the incarnate dispensation of the divine Logos... comes before all creation, and... was preordained before the preordain ing of the salvation of all who are being saved. Do you see that God made man in His own image for this reason, that man might be able to accom modate the Archetype through the Incarnation?" The quotation is taken from P. Ncllzs, Deification in Christ: Orthodox Perspectives on the Nature of the Human Person (Crestwood, NY, 1987), 218, 230. Unfortunately, the "Apology" has been excluded from the English translation of Nico demus's Handbook of Spiritual Counsel, "for practical reasons." See P.

BucuR There are, on the other hand, a number of older studies by scholars such as Iren?e Hausherr or Adh?mar dAl?s, which claim that, by viewing the Incarnation as essentially unrelated to the Fall, patristic writers such as Irenaeus of Lyon, Maximus the Confessor, and Isaac of Nineveh were proponents of the "Scotist" position avant la lettre? In the words of Hans Urs von Balthasar, "there is no doubt that Maximus... would have placed himself on the side of Scotus, without a second thought, in the [later] scholastic controversy: not redemption from sin, but the unification of the world in itself and with God is the ultimate motivating cause for the Incarnation and, as such, the first idea of the Creator, existing in advance of all creation."8 Von Balthasar acknowledges, however, that "the presuppositions of that scholastic controversy, which begins with an order of being?a world free from sin?that is only possible, never historically real, is far from Maximus s thought."9 What one finds in Byzantine theology is therefore not Scotism before Scotus.10 There exists nevertheless in Byzantium a strong and well-represented tradition, shared by Maximus with sev eral other outstanding theologians, which does, indeed, view the Incarnation of the Word as the fundamental mystery of creation, conceived by God before all eternity. In what follows, I shall focus on Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, Maximus the Confessor, Isaac of Nineveh, and Nicholas Cabasilas. I shall also point to other writers, such as Gregory Palamas, Symeon the New Theologian, or, earlier still, Jacob of Serug, Tertullian, and Irenaeus of Lyon, who hold views on the Incarnation congenial with that of Maximus. My overall thesis is that the Max imian view is not an "exception" but rather a doctrine shared by significant early Christian and later Byzantine writers, which stretches back to the very beginnings of Christian thought. Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite There are at least two elements that are particularly relevant to the theme under discussion: first, Pseudo Dionysius's speculation on unities and differentiations in God; second, his discussion of the interplay between God in complete transcendence, "beyond being," and the outpourings in which God gives himself away unceas ingly for the life of the world. Regarding the first element: after establishing that all names are predicated about God in his unity, not about distinct Persons {DivineNames 2.1), and following a series of general statements about the distinction between a a and a a e a {DivineNames 2.2-3), Dionysius understands that a more complex discussion is necessary. Therefore, after reaffirming the fundamen tal distinction (the e e refer to the divine , the a e to the divine , Divine Names 2.4, PG 3:64oD), he introduces the following crucial explanation: "There are specific unions and differentiations which are peculiar to either the union or differentiation that has been spoken about."11 Thus, as Eugenio Corsini and John D.Jones have observed,12 Pseudo-Dionysius distinguishes not only between e e and a e , but also between what is united and what is differentiated within each of these. We obtain four cases: Borodine, who argued the opposite view in her fundamental study, "La doctrine de la 'd?ification' dans l'Eglise grecque," RHR 4 (1931): 1-32. 7 According to Adh?mar d'Al?s ("La doctrine de la r?capitulation en Saint Ir?n?e," RSR 6 [1916]: 185-211, at 191), even though Irenaeus "a ouvert la voie o? devait plus tard marcher l'?cole thomiste," in some of his statements "nous reconnaissons les futures positions de l'?cole sco tiste." Ir?n?e Hausherr ("Un pr?curseur de la th?orie Scotiste sur la fin de l'Incarnation: Isaac de Niniv?," RSR 22 [1932]: 316-20) extended the debate to Isaac of Nineveh. 8 H.

Divine differentiation 2.1. "what is united in the divine differentiation," and, finally, 2.2. "what is differentiated in the divine differentiation." The subdivision between what is united and differenti ated within each of the two fundamental categories is secondary: the subcategories (united unity, differentiated unity, and, respectively, united differentiation, differ entiated differentiation) do not override the category established by the primary distinction between what is united and what is differentiated. Pseudo-Dionysius makes this very clear when he says that "it is not permis sible either to divide what is united or to confound what is differentiated."13 Earlier {Divine Names 2.3, 640BC), Dionysius had presented the same scheme differently. There are two unities and two differentiations: the first unity pertains to "whatever... is of the preeminent denial," that is, the divine being beyond being; the second unity is "every thing pertaining to causality: good, beauty, being," and so forth. As for the two differentiations, the first one refers to God as Trinity, the second to "the all-complete and unchanged constitution of our Jesus as well as all that which refers to the essential mystery of his love for humankind." The scheme would be the following: . "What is united" i.i. "what is united in the divine unity"; 2.1. "what is united in the divine differentiation" ; 2. "What is differentiated" 1.2. "what is differentiated in the divine unity"; 2.2. "what is differentiated in the divine differentiation." The advantage of this earlier scheme is that it offers some information on the otherwise shadowy "differentiation within the divine differentiation." Pseudo-Dionysius has in mind not only the differentiation of the proodos in a variety of gifts: the mystery of Christ's philanthropy is very clearly a reference to the Incarnation, and "the constitution of our Jesus" could very well refer to the hypostatic union.14 In this case, the Incarnation would be seen as part of the grand movement of divine differ entiation: as One is to Trinity, so is the divine procession to the Incarnation. Let us turn now to the second element of relevance to our theme, which is that Pseudo-Dionysius's Christology is developed within the larger framework of transcendent and immanent divinity. As Alexander Golitzin notes, both procession and return are "concentrated ... spe cifically in the second Person of the Trinity."15 Christ abides "beyond beingly" ( e ), beyond all things ( a e a) in his divinity,16 transcendent and immovable on his throne {Epistle 9:3,1109C). At the same time, however, inasmuch as he is the "thearchy," "ray," "providence," and so forth,17 he is the active cause of being and well-being of all,18 and bestows on created beings?angelic minds and humans alike?fragrance, happiness, nourishment, divine pleasure,19 and most divine inspirations.20 This christological framing of both procession and return leads to the conclusion that Pseudo-Dionysius views the economy of the Incarnation as, essentially, a continuation and restoration of the general eternally foreordained process by which the world is increasingly brought into communion with God. It is helpful to con sider the use of the terms "thearchy," "providence," and "theophany." introduction to Pseudo-Dionysius Areopagite: The Divine Names and Mystical Theology (Milwaukee, 1980), 34. 13 Divine Names 2.2, PG 3:64oA ( a e a a a e e e a a e a e ). 14 For a pertinent argumentation of the fundamentally Christian character of a a, see A.

DOP 62</page><page sequence="4">202 I Bogdan G. BucuR Pseudo-Dionysius generally uses "thearchic" for Gods "energetic" presence in the world.21 The term, however, is also used in speaking about the death of Christ, so that the "thearchic" economy of the Incarna tion expresses the eternal "thearchic" movement of the divine outpouring.22 As for "providence," the Dionysian view is that "the of each are held in the divine procession and there fore that created being mirrors providence_"23 But "providence" very clearly can be used as a christological title: "the divine hierarch, standing before the holy altar, hymns the... sacred theurgies of Jesus, our most divine Providence."24 In Divine Names 11.5 (953AB), the text speaks of "the providence of Jesus" making "that peace which is ineffable and was foreordained from eternity and which reconciles (a a a a ) us to him self." The lines immediately preceding and following the fragment describe this "peace" as a result of Christ's philanthropy, consisting in the reconciliation with the Father, brought about through Jesus Christ in the Holy Spirit.25 Yet "philanthropy" and "reconciliation" are terms that point unmistakably to the concrete event of the Incarnation.26 The Corpus Areopagiticum identifies "The-One Who-Is," who spoke to Moses, with Jesus.27 In Epistle 9.1 (1105A), God's intelligible providences are defined as his gifts, appearances, powers, attributes, allotments, abodes?in short, all biblical theophanies. In conclusion, under the wrappings of his sophisticated philosophical language, Pseudo-Dionysius espouses the traditional understanding of Old Testament theophanies as Chris tophanies.28 From the passages just analyzed, I conclude, in agree ment with Golitzin, that "for Dionysius, Gods Provi dence and the created nature that it sustains and draws to itself both presuppose the Incarnation," so that "the Incarnation is... the result?we might almost say the inescapable result?of that movement of God that weaves together all the Dionysian universe."29 This view will be echoed by Maximus the Confessor, who can therefore hardly be seen as a theological "exception." Framing the matter more broadly, and also anticipating what will be evident in Maximus, Ysabel de Andia formulates the fol lowing conclusion: "au centre de la mystique de Denys, il y a un myst?re de Jesus' {Epistle 3.1069B)? Le reproche fait ? Denys de ne pas faire de place au Christ n'est pas fond?: l'ensemble des textes cit?s montre que le Christ est principe et fin de toutes choses."30 It is usually assumed that the association of God ad extra with the second Person of the Trinity is a specific feature of second- and third-century authors such as Irenaeus or Origen, and that it was later advocated, in a hardened subordinationist version, by Arian theology.31 21 In Celestial Hierarchy 13.4 (PG 3:305!^), the initiatory angel teaches Isaiah that the work of purification along the hierarchy occurs by the thearchic "works" ( a ea a e e e a ) gradually manifested along the different levels of the hierarchy. In Epistle 1 (PG 3:io68A), in order to explain how the transcendent God, ? a e a, is also ea a ... a a a a a , Ps.-Dionysius says that "divinity" and "goodness" should be considered as a a a a e (Epistle 2, PG 3: 69A). In other words, "thearchy" and "agathar chy" stand for God's deifying gift of Himself to the world. Cf. Ecclesias tical Hierarchy 7.3.7 (PG 3:56iCD), where "thearchic" is used for God's economy?his love of humankind and his ordinances. 22 ea .. . ... a a (Ecclesiastical Hierarchy 3.2.7?

The main arguments are concentrated in nn. 7-9. In Celestial Hierarchy 1.2,121A ( ' a e a e a a e a a a e e ), the participle v can be read either as reinforcing "light" (the fatherly light, the true one), or it can be treated in its own right, which would result in translat ing: "Jesus, the fatherly light, the Existing One." According to Perczel, this second reading is supported by the Syriac manuscript tradition, by stylistic arguments, and by the occurrence of the same construction in Epistle , PG 3 065A. 28 This view went unchallenged until Augustine, and it remained as traditional in Eastern theology and liturgy as the doctrine of created theo phanies became to the post-Augustinian West.

Maximus the Confessor In the case of Maximus the Confessor, the centrality of the Logos in virtually all areas of theological reflection is much clearer.33 Indeed, Maximus's thought revolves around the divine Logos by whom and in view of whom the entire cosmos was created, subsists, and advances toward transfiguration and deification. It is in the Logos that creation finds its unity of origin, movement, and purpose; at the same time, it is the Logos that founds the diversity of creation.34 Maximus sharply contrasts himself with the Ori genists, who were envisaging a pr?existence of beings in God and were taking movement and diversity to be results of a premundane Fall.35 In his Logos theology Maximus stresses the idea of creation ex nihilo?6 while, on the other hand, he makes it clear that it is not the creatures but their particular logoi that "preexist" in the unique divine Logos. This "pr?existence," however, does not mean that the logoi subsist in a distinct way. The expression "logoi of the creatures" is another way of saying that all creatures have the One hypostatic Logos as their principle and cause. Developing the Ps.-Dionysian theme of the One multiplied out of goodness in his ordering, illumining, and trophic "outpourings," Maximus speaks of the same Logos, who, in himself, is utterly transcendent, yet whose goodness is revealed and multiplied in all things.37 It is in this sense that "the one Logos is many logoi and the many logoi are One."38 The pr?existence ascribed to the logoi is different from that of Origen's "minds," because it does not refer to the created beings themselves; neither do Maximus's logoi preexist within the divine essence. They are rather conceived of as volitional thoughts, at the level of divine energies.39 Strom. 7.10.58; Excerpta 10.6; 12.1), the Logos is the face ( ) of the Father. For Origen (e.g.,/?. 1.38; Princ. 1.2.3)tne Logos is "God's hypos tasized immanence" (Golitzin, Et Introibo, 274). Later, in the fourth century, Eunomius [Liber Apologeticus 24) will advocate a similar posi tion, viewing the Son as the Father's "solidified energy" (Golitzin, Et Introibo, 287). 32 Golitzin, ibid., 288 (for his examples from the Cappadocians, see 293-96); idem, "'The Demons Suggest an Illusion of God's Glory in a Body': Controversy on the Divine Body and Vision of Glory in Some Late Fourth, Early Fifth Century Monastic Literature," Studia Monastica 44 (2002): 13-43,at 14- The same argument, though less developed, appears in Lossky, The Vision of God, 2nd ed., trans.

This is evident in the incomparable differ ences among created things. For each is unmistakably unique in itself and its identity remains distinct in relation to other things. He will also know that the many logoi are the one Logos (e a ) to whom all things are related and who exists in himself without confu sion, the essential and individually distinctive God, the Logos of God the Father_" (Ambigua 7:1077c [54]). 35 See the classic study by P. Sherwood, The Earlier Ambigua (Rome, 1955), as well as P. Blowers, "The Logology of Maximus the Confessor in His Criticism of Origenism," in Origeniana Quinta, ed. R. J.

In the course of the monothelitic and monoenergetic debates, the distinction between divine essence and divine will and operation/ energy was applied to the christological issue at stake (see H.

BucuR The overarching framework for Christian cosmol ogy is the triad e - - a , which, as Poly carp Sherwood has definitively proved, Maximus developed in order to counter the Origenistic triad a - - e .40 The progress from "image" to "likeness" translates as ascent from being to well being (e e a , the locus of ascetic-mystical life) to ever being (ae e a ).41 This movement is also an ascent to and abiding in ones own particular source, a a a a?a e e a e .42 As Maxi mus explains, "[ ]here is no end toward which he can be moved, nor is he moved in any other way than toward his beginning, that is, he ascends to the Logos by whom he was created and in whom all things will ultimately be restored."43 The purpose of this movement is, in Maxim ian language, the coincidence of "the mode of existence" ( a e ) with "the logos of nature" ( e a , e );44 in another perspective, it is the coincidence of deliberate will ( a ) with natural will ( a ). Since the human being is a "laboratory" ( a ) of sorts, or the "natural link" ( e ) between the extremities of creation,45 its ultimate becom ing also implies the transfiguration of the entire created world.46 With the Fall, the fertile distinctions of creation have hardened into painful antagonisms. Having become enslaved to a mode of existence ( a e ) opposed to its e , humanity is no longer able to fulfill its destiny and, consequently, its responsibility toward the cosmos. Yet, given Adams "logomorphic" constitu tion, God's "great counsel" with regard to humanity and the world cannot be broken by the Fall; the realization of the likeness is inherently contained in the divinely established "image of God." Maximus describes the work of restoration by the term a a e a a ("recapitulation"), the same term he uses to describe the "law" governing created being: "For we believe that a logos of angels preceded their cre ation, a logos preceded the creation of each of the beings and powers that fill the upper world, a logos preceded the creation of human beings, a logos preceded every thing that receives its becoming from God_This same Logos whose goodness is revealed and multiplied in all the things that have their origin in him, with the degree of beauty appropriate to each being, recapitulates all things in himself (Eph i:io)."47 The first thing to note about this passage is its cosmologica! rather than soteriological same Dionysian-Maximian tradition and clearly affirms that the thele mata are not to be thought within the divine essence (Defide ortho doxa 2.2). Gregory Palamas sees himself as a continuation of the preced ing theology. For an overall exposition of this theological tradition, see D. Bradshaw, Aristotle East and West: Metaphysics and the Division of Christendom (Cambridge, 2004). 40 See Maximus, Ambigua 7, PG 91:1067-1101. 41 See Maximus, Ambigua 13, PG 9 .1116 ; Ambigua 157, PG 9i:i392A.

Heinzer's very helpful overview of its previous patristic use, in his Gottes Sohn als Mensch: Die Struktur des Menschseins Christi bei Maxi mus Confessor [Freiburg, 1980], 30-58), but in Maximus it functions almost exclusively to express relations of the human and divine in the restored and deified creature. Sherwood (The Earlier Ambigua, 179) also remarks that "it is borne out by the not infrequent use o? logos as referring to natural contemplation and of tropos to the virtues" (e.g., Ad Thalas sium 22, PG 9o:32iB;^?/ Thalassium 37, PG 90:38560; Ambigua 144, PG 91:13810-1384 A). The idea of is sometimes (e.g., Ambigua 101, PG 91:1289c) expressed by "logos of being how" ( e a ). From Ambigua 41 on, the principle of e a appears as , in order to distinguish it more clearly from the e a (see Hein zer, Gottes Sohn als Mensch, 132). 45 Maximus, Ambigua io6, PG 91:1305. For a comprehensive study on this topic, see the excellent article by P. Arg?rate, " e a a : El hombre como mediador en el pen samiento de M?ximo el Confesor," OCP 66 (2000): 317-34. 46 In Ambigua 106 (PG 91:13050) Maximus presents a series of divi sions ( a e ) that make evident God's intended plan for creation. Each new division follows from the immediately preceding one: 1. uncreated created; 2. Within "created": intelligible-sensible; 3. Within "sensible": heaven (sky)-earth; 4. Within "earth": Eden-rest of the world (oikoumene); 5. Within "Eden": Male-female. These divisions could be termed "fer tile distinctions," i.e., distinctions that found a relation between their respective terms, a relation meant to result in the overcoming of the dis tinction. They "express the limited character of creation, which is indeed the very condition of its existence; at the same time, they are problems to be resolved, obstacles to be surmounted on the way towards union with God" (Lossky,Mystical Theology [n. 9 above], no). God's "original plan" for humans was that they climb up the subsequent levels of division, over coming in themselves the respective limitations. Finally, "there remain ing nothing outside himself but God alone, man had only to give himself to Him in a complete abandonment of love, and thus return to Him the whole created universe gathered together in his whole being. God himself would then in His turn have given Himself to man, who would then... by grace possess all that God possesses by nature" (ibid.). 47 Maximus, Ambigua 7, PG 9i:io8oA [55]: A?yov a a a a e a e e , a a a a e , a , " a e e e a a? ... a a e a e a a a DOP 62</page><page sequence="7">Foreordained from All Eternity | 205 thrust. Maximus refutes the Origenistic interpretation of a fragment from Gregory of Nyssa, and posits instead that the particular logoi are fixed in the unique Logos. Thus, he uses a a e a a to describe the "rationality" of created being and its natural movement toward the divine purpose.48 But Maximus also applies a a e a a to the work of Christ, stressing in this way the idea that redemption is nothing more than a restoration of the natural, original movement of creation. The process by which the Logos reunites the funda mental distinctions of creation constitutes an antithetic parallel to what has been described as the "original plan" of humanity, and is described in the final part oiAmbigua 41 (PG 91, col. 1305) and in Ad Thalassium 48: by his virginal birth, Christ bridges the division between male and female (cf. Galatians 3:28); by his death and resurrec tion, he breaks down the barrier between Paradise and the world (cf. Luke 23:43); he then ascends and presents to the Father the entire creation recapitulated in himself. In Christ, however, all natural divisions of creation, as well as the fundamental division between the created and the uncreated, have been overcome. At this point it is helpful to introduce one of the fundamental texts of the Confessor: "This mystery was known solely to the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit before all the ages_Christ was foreknown not as what he was in himself by nature, but as what he manifested when, in the economy of salvation, he subsequently became human on our behalf. For truly he who is the Creator of the essence of created beings by nature had also to become the very Author of the deification of creatures by grace, in order that the Giver of well-being might appear also as the gracious Giver of eternal well-being."49 An anonymous scholiast synthesizes the above by noting that the hypostatic union has been preconceived.50 Indeed, if Christ is foreknown not a a , as divine, but a ' a , in his taking on human nature, it follows that the latter is part of God s original design for mankind. Moreover, it is the Logos who becomes incarnate because of his unique relation to humanity: he is the "demi urge" that granted "being"; it was fitting, therefore, that he be also the "effector" (a ) of "ever-well-being" or deification. Thus, in light of Maximus s theory of the "stages" of created existence, the hypostatic union appears as the necessary cause of ever-being. "[H]e showed that we were created for this, and also that God s good purpose for us from before the ages did not suffer any renewal what soever according to its proper logos, but rather came to be realized by means of another, newer mode, introduced later on? And this, as we all believe, is the mystery of the most mystical advent of God to humankind."51 In this passage, for which I have given my own trans lation, the Incarnation appears as the new manner of real izing the pre-eternal destiny allotted to humankind. What I find crucial is the affirmation that the newness of the Incarnation, in comparison to what would have happened if Adam had not fallen, is situated at the level of tropos, not logos. It is, in other words, the Incarnation of the Logos that restores Adams original movement toward perfec tion. This fits well with Maximus s use of a a e a a to describe both the Incarnation and the rationality of created beings, so that the work of Christ appears as the restoration of this natural movement. Without thereby undermining the historical Christ-event, Maximus sees the death and resurrection of Christ as the full embodi ment of the universal law divinely inscribed in creation. The primordial sin, grave as it was, could not have affected the logos of created existence. This is precisely the mean ing of the following affirmation: "The mystery of the Incarnation of the Word contains in itself the meaning of all the symbols and all the enigmas of Scripture, as well as the hidden meaning of all sensible and intelligible cre ation. He who knows the mystery of the Cross and the Tomb knows also the essential principle of all things. Finally, he who... finds himself initiated in the mystery of the Resurrection, apprehends the end for which God created all things from the beginning."52 a a a a a a e e e e a e , a e ea a a a a a e a a e . 48 Ibid., col. 1080. 49 Maximus, Ad Thalassium 60 (PG 90:624 [127-28]: e a a a a a a e a ... e e a a ' a , a ' 6 e a a ' a ' a e e e . e a a a a a a a a a a e a e e e , a e e a a a ae e e a a . 50 a ' a e e a a a e a a e a (PG 90:625, scholion a'). 51 Maximus, Ambigua 7, PG 9i:io97B-D: e e a a e e e a , a a e a a a a e e a e a ' a a a , e e a ' a a e a a e ... a a e a e a , a e e e , . 52 Maximus, Gnostic Centuries 1.66, PG 90:1108.

BucuR To say that the hypostatic union is essentially unaf fected by the Fall does not mean that the latter did not affect the union at any level. As the text quoted above {Ambigua 7, PG 91, col. 1097B-D) makes clear, it is not the logos of the "most mystical advent to humankind" that is modified, since it represents the very purpose of creation; it is the tropos of the Incarnation that is determined by the corrupt existential status of human kind. This is also the interpretation offered by Dumitru St?niloae.53 That Maximus viewed the Incarnation as part of Gods design, independently of the Fall, seems to be the majority position in scholarship.54 Jean-Claude Larchet proposes a different interpretation. The Incarnation is, he thinks, "li?e indissociablement au salut et donc au p?ch? de l'homme, et la chute de l'homme ?tait donc pr?vue avant les si?cles, donc avant m?me sa cr?ation."55 According to this view, the Incarnation is Gods new mode of granting deification to humankind, a goal that could have been achieved "autrement que par le biais de l'Incarnation," if Adam had not fallen.56 Larchet thinks ??&amp;tAd Thalassium 60 never affirms that the union between God and humanity could be accomplished only by the Incarnation; moreover, we have a confirma tion of the opposite in Ambigua 41, where the project of overcoming the distinctions of created being does not mention the necessity of the Incarnation.57 But this is an argument from silence: nothing excludes the Incarnation from the "project" described in Ambigua 4i. The general scheme of Maximus's Logos-theory and anthropology, as expressed in the passages quoted above, and the reception of these texts would rather suggest the "traditional" interpretation. More specifically, the scholion to Ad Thalassium 60, although not by Maximus,58 shows at least that somebody?certainly more than one single learned theologian?was reading Maximus in a certain way. This reading, which Larchet believes to be a mis interpretation of Maximus, was continued by Nicholas Cabasilas59 and Nicodemus Hagiorites, both of whom view the hypostatic union as the original aim of creation. To quote an almost hymnic passage from Ad Thalassium 60, "This is the great and hidden mystery; this is the blessed end, on account of which all things are bound together; this is the divine and foreknown purpose, con ceived before the beginning of beings."60 Interestingly, Larchet's interpretation of the passage in Maximus applies quite well to certain statements made by Symeon the New Theologian. In his Ethical Discourses, the entire economy of redemption, from Adam to Mary, is presented as the history of the preparation of a pure "portion" of humanity, which Christ then assumes in the Incarnation. It is true that God's decision to bring about the restoration of humanity "through birth into the flesh of the only begotten" is placed in eternity, "before the world." Yet, unlike Maximus, the New Theologian explains this fore-ordination as dependent on God's foreknowledge of the Fall.61 He transposes the "usual" 53 "Sin has given to this Incarnation the character of extreme kenosis, to the Cross its bloody and redemptive character, and to the Resurrection its character of victory over death. Without sin, there would have been an Incarnation, a Cross, and a mystical Resurrection, in the sense that created existence as such, even if it had reached apatheia, would have had to receive God in itself in a more perfect way (Incarnation), to rest from its natural movements and necessities (death), and to be resurrected for an exclusively divine activity (deification). The Logos in his humanity would have been our forerunner on this path. Therefore, Christ's mys tery was established from eternity... but sin has modeled its execution in a new way" (D. St?niloae, Filocalia sfintelor nevointe ale desav?rsirii [Bucharest, 1948], 3:496 n. 471). 54 Aside from the scholars already noted (Florovsky, Lot-Borodine, Lossky, von Balthasar), see also A.

This was first noted by Iren?e Hausherr in the article I mentioned in the introduction. Here is one of the crucial passages, drawn from Isaacs Centuries on Spiritual Knowledge. Since the Centuries have not yet been translated into English, and only Italian and French translations are available,631 quote Hausherr's very literal Latin rendering of the Syriac: Non alia de causa fecit Deus hoc, nisi ut amorem quern habet, notum faceret mundo; ut... mundus in amorem eius captivaretur_Nequ?quam ut a peccatis nos redimeret, neque propter quidquam aliud fuit mors Domini nostri, sed tantum ut mundus sentiret amorem quem habuit Deus erga creationem. Si hoc est mysterium oeconomiae Domini nostri, ut a Servitute peccati nos redimeret, ergo si non pecca tores fuissemus, locum non habuisset adventus Christi... privati fuissent nomini et angeli tota hac luce et scientia. Gratias ergo decet nos rependere peccato, quippe quia propter illud omnia haec bona accepimus.... Et hoc quo, si in justitia perstitis semus, digni habiti non essemus, hoc ipsum dedit nobis peccatum!64 For Isaac, the motive of the Incarnation should be sought not in the remission of sins but in Gods desire to communicate his overflowing love for the world. The Incarnation is precisely what makes this love visible and draws humankind into returning love for love.65 A differ ent view is unthinkable to the bishop of Nineveh, who points out that it is absurd to think of the manifestation of Christ as a fortunate result of the Fall.66 On the con trary, for Isaac the Incarnation is a crucial development in Gods providence for human and angelic creation alike. In his Homily 28, he writes the following concerning the angels: "Before Christ's incarnate coming, the theoria of the intellect and vision, whereby the order of the celes tial beings is moved, was not within their [the angels'] power, so that they could penetrate into these mysteries. But when the Word was made flesh, in Jesus a door was opened unto them, as the Apostle says."67 The advent of Christ allowed the angels to have access to the mysteries. Since it would make no sense to speak of a restoration of the angelic access to the mysteries, it appears clear that the Incarnation is primarily a positive gift, hence a fulfillment of God's purpose in creating. Even more interesting is Isaac's contention that dis cernment of the true reason for the advent is possible only through spiritual maturity and contemplative reading of Scripture.68 The connection between the Incarnation and Adam's Fall is, according to Isaac, only the outer, common message of the Scripture. With spiritual advancement one is led to deeper insight and to the understanding that the death and resurrection of Christ did not occur for the redemption of our sins, but in order to manifest God's love for his creation. Pedagogically, as it were, both positions are correct, and Scripture does at times speak in "weak" language (i.e., a language that is inadequate to its object) in order to benefit the readers. Nevertheless, Isaac insists, the true significance of the Incarnation greatly surpasses the reference to our sins, since both creation 62 Cf. Cyril of Alexandria, Thesaurus 5, Assert. 15 (PG 75H96AB). As part of God's eternal plan for humanity, drafted before creation, Christ is laid as a foundation to humankind so that, in the event of the Fall, the restoration of Adam would be possible. 63 P.

BucuR and redemption manifest the same unique economy of divine love.69 Nicholas Cabasilas It has been noted that "in analyzing the nature of the spiritual life, Nicholas Cabasilas makes at the same time a particularly penetrating study of the true nature of man."70 It is noteworthy that his anthropological vision is developed along the same lines?christological, liturgi cal, mystical?as that of Maximus the Confessor. The fundamental assumption governingCabasilas's anthro pology is the traditional belief in Christ as the image of God and paradigm of the human being: 71 It was for the new man ( a a a ) that human nature was created; It was not the old Adam who was the model ( a a e a) for the new, but the new Adam for the old; The first Adam is an imitation ( a) of the second, and has been fashioned in accordance with His pattern and image ( a a a e e a e a); The Savior first and alone showed to us the true man, who is perfect on account of both character and life_Such is the true definition of the human being ( a ),72 which God had before his eyes ( ? ... ? e ) when he fashioned him [Adam]. By this final end I mean a life without d?filement_We must regard Christ as the arche type ( a e a ) and the former Adam as derived from Him. So then, for all these reasons humankind strives toward Christ by nature... not only because of His Godhead,... but because of His other [i.e., human] nature as well. To love anything beside Him... is a turning aside from the foundations laid in our nature from the beginning ( e rfj e e a a a ).73 Jesus Christ is the eternal idea, icon, pattern, form,74 archetype of the human being, its ontological "hypoth esis" and "definition." For this view I will henceforth use the term "christomorphic anthropology." Because he constitutes the pattern of both original humanity and the restored human being, "humankind strives toward Christ by nature... not only because of his divinity... but because of his other, human nature as well." A crucial implication of Cabasilas's christomorphic anthropology is the fact that the Incarnation of the Logos appears as the original destiny of mankind: "such is man s true goal, and it was with a view to this end that God fashioned him. By this final end I mean a life without defilement, when his body has been purified of corrup tion and his will delivered from all sin." Yet such a life is rooted in Christ's "outpouring" into the world, as a fragrant myron that imparts incorruption.75 It is therefore the hypostatic union, by which the distance between Godhead and humanity is overcome, that corresponds to the end that God had in mind when he fashioned Adam.76 Gregory Palamas In his Theological Chapters, Gregory Palamas states that human nature has been created with a capacity for "both knowing and receiving God"; more concretely, it is not only capable of receiving God through struggle and grace ( e e ' a a a ), but also capable of being united with God in a single hypostasis 69 Ibid. 4.84, 4.79. 70 Nelhs, Deification, 115. 71 All quotations are taken from Life in Christ 6.91-97. The Greek is from the critical edition: Nicolas Cabasilas: La vie en Christ, Livres V- VII, ed. and trans. M.-H. Congourdeau, SC 361 (Paris, 1989). The English translation is that of C. J. DeCatanzaro, Nicolas Cabasilas: The Life in Christ (Crestwood, NY, 1974), 190-91, with occasional emendations. 72 DeCatanzaro has "such is man's true goal." 73 DeCatanzaro has "turning aside from the first principles of our nature." 74 In baptism we are remodeled according to the blessed form ( ... a a e ), and "stamped" ( e ) in view of "this blessed form and shape (e a a e e e a )" {Life in Christ 2.11, 2.34;see also 2.44). 75 Life in Christ 3.3; 3.5. These remarks are strongly reminiscent of Dio nysius's discussion in Ecclesiastical Hierarchy (e.g., 4.3.4, PG 3:4770), where Christ manifests himself as myron to the entire hierarchy. If we admit that Cabasilas has a clear idea of the Ps.-Areopagitic doctrine, he is implicitly equating the cosmic outpouring of Christ with the "out pouring" of the Incarnation. 76 Life in Christ 3.5.

Another fragment, quoted by Nico demus, seems to anticipate Cabasilass christomorphic anthropology, discussed above: Even the original creation of the world was established for Him ( ? e e) who is baptized here below as son of man but is acknowledged by God from above as the only beloved Son ... even the original creation of man, when he was fashioned in the image of God, took place on His account, that man might be able some day to accommodate ( a ) the Arche type. And the law decreed by God in Paradise was on His account ( ' a )_Nor is this all_The angelic natures and orders and the heavenly degrees, have also from the beginning had as their final end the dispensation of the Incarnation ( ea a ).78 Palamas affirms that the future "accommodation" of the Archetype (i.e., the Incarnation) is the final reason for creation. It is important to note that Gods purpose for creation, including the hierarchies of angels, is the "the andric dispensation" made possible only in Christ.79 It is clear that the idea of the Incarnation as mystery foreseen from eternity is rooted in a specific anthropo logical view, affirmed both by Palamas and, even more emphatically, by Nicholas Cabasilas. Both authors speak of Christ as "model" or "paradigm" of humanity, so that not only the restored humanity but also the old Adam is viewed as being "in Christ." Both authors hold, in short, a christomorphic anthropology. In what follows I will argue that, far from being a late development in Byzantium, this view has venerable roots in earlier tradition. Christ as the Prototype of Adam in Early Christian Thought In this section I present two brief passages from Cabasilas and three texts that seem to provide a similar type of christomorphic anthropology. Nicholas Cabasilas, Life in Christ: To him [God] who has all things before his eyes ( a ) before they exist, the first Adam is an imitation ( a) of the second, and has been fashioned in accordance with His pattern and image ( a a a e e a e a)? Such is the true definition of the human being ( a ), which God gazed upon ( ? ... ? e ) when He fashioned him.80 Tertullian, On the Resurrection of the Flesh: Remember that God was wholly concerned with and given unto it [the clay]... in his love, which was dictating the lineaments of the imprint {liniamenta imprimis). For, whatever form the clay would take on {limus exprimebatur), it was Christ that God had in mind {Christus cogitabatur): namely, that he was to become man, the Word was to become flesh (which is what the clay, the earth was at that moment). For this had been the address {praefatio) of the Father to the Son, "Let us make man in our own image and likeness" (Genesis 1:26). "And God made man" ... "After the image of God did he make him" (Genesis 1:27), in other words, of Christ. For the Word is also God, who being in the image of God, "thought it not robbery to be equal to God" (Philippians 2:6). Thus, that clay which was at that moment putting 77 Palamas, Chapters 24.1 have used the text and translation of R. Sinke wicz, ed., Saint Gregory Palamas: The One Hundred and Fifty Chapters; A Critical Edition, Translation, and Study (Toronto-Leiden, 1988). 78 Gregory Palamas, Sermon on the Epiphany, as quoted by Nellas, Deification ( . 1 above), 230. 79 Nicodemus turns this theandric dispensation into "the mystery of the incarnate dispensation of the divine Logos" ( a e a ), and explains the "accommodation" of the Archetype by means of an expansion that includes an explicit reference to the Incarnation: "do you see that God made man in His own image for this reason, that man might be able to accommodate the Archetype through the Incarnation ( a a a a e a e )?" (Nellas, Deification, 228, 230). This is certainly not an over-interpretation of the text; nevertheless, as I have shown in the section dedicated to Maximus the Confessor, "theandric" and "incar nate" are not necessarily equivalent, since the latter includes not only the divinely established " e , but also the a e intro duced by the Fall. 80 Cabasilas, Life in Christ 6.12.92, 95.

For this cause he said "Let us make man in our image" (Genesis 1:26), in this [same] likeness in which Mary gave birth to the Only One. The Father willed to send him in to the world as a man, and drew beforehand his form, the Great Image, in Adam (591); The one who showed himself as a man was the same [as] the one [whom] the prophet [Ezekiel] saw again in the form of God (566); The Son of God wanted to become a man, and it was for this reason that Ezekiel saw him as a man (575); That likeness of a servant that he assumed within the womb (Philippians 2:6) was whispered on the wings of the heavenly being. Before he was to become what he became in latter times, he willed to show, in a great wonder, how he would become [it] (57s).82 Byzantine Hymnography O Thou who hast fashioned Eve from Adam's side Thy side was pierced and from it flowed streams of cleansing With Thy hand Thou hast fashioned Adam from the earth and for his sake Thou hast become by nature man and wast of Thine own will crucified.83 Thou, O Christ, with invisible hands hast fashioned man in Thine image and thou hast now displayed the original beauty in this same human body formed by Thee.84 Lo, the time of our salvation is at hand. Make ready, O cave; the Virgin draws nigh to give birth_for Christ comes in His love for mankind, to save the man He fashioned.85 Each of these fragments has a different intentional context. Tertullian is interested in highlighting the nobility of the body, so as to defend the Incarnation.86 Jacob of Serug seeks to convince his audience, seduced by apocalyptic traditions of ascent to the heavenly throne, that the enthroned Glory of God is manifested fully in the Incarnation, so that the Enthroned One is revealed in the Incarnation and accessible in the Eucharist of the Church.87 The hymns' insistence on the coexistence of glory and kenosis in Christ illustrates the extensive and masterful cultivation of antithesis, parallelism, and para dox typical of Byzantine hymnography.88 Significantly, the christological framing of creation and providence 81 Tertullian, On the Resurrection of the Flesh 6.3-5.

It is notable that all the passages quoted above share the imagery used by Nicholas Cabasilas, namely that of God fashioning Adam while having before his eyes the incarnate Christ. Tertullian and Jacob of Serug even employ the same combination of biblical references, Gen esis 1:26 and Philippians 2:6, even though Jacob never read Tertullian. This is certainly a very old tradition in Christian ity, since we find it in Irenaeus of Lyon, who represents one of the major influences on Tertullian,89 and who was himself indebted to Theophilus of Antioch.90 With the rapid dissemination o? Against Heresies throughout the Empire, much of Irenaeus's theology became part of the bedrock of later mainstream Christianity East and West.91 It comes as no surprise, then, that Irenaeus is the first patristic writer to be labeled a Scotist avant la lettre. As far as the problem under discussion is concerned, one of the relevant passages is: "[A] Paulo &lt;typus futuri&gt; ( ) dictus est ipse Adam (Romans 5,14), quoniam futuram circa Filium Dei humani gen eris ( a ) dispositionem in semetipsum ( a ) fabricator omnium Verbum praeformaverat ( e e ), praedestinante Deo ( a e ) primum animalem hominem videlicet ut a spiritali sal varetur. Cum enim praeexisteret salvans, oportebat et quod salvaretur fieri, uti non vacuum sit salvans."92 It is perhaps easier to start with the second sentence. "Salvans" here obviously refers to the Savior, Christ, but "salvation" is not taken in the sense of redemption from a negative state, but in the sense of "leading to perfection"?that is, as we shall see, to full humanity. The meaning of Ire naeus's words is the following: inasmuch as the One who saves [in his capacity of spiritual Adam, who saves the fallen Adam] pre-existed [as the eternal Logos], the one to he saved had to he created, too Adam is typus futuri because the Logos prefigured in him the future perfect mankind that would be mani fested in the Incarnation: "even before being the typos of a regenerated mankind, Christ is the prototype of a perfect mankind."94 Therefore, the Incarnation seems not so much Gods saving response to the Fall of man, but rather the original destiny of mankind, premeditated from all eternity. It is true that the text above provides no explicit christological affirmations.95 Nevertheless, Irenaeus's christomorphic anthropology and Logos-centered cos mology, as well as his soteriological views (God becoming man, so that man could become God) can only confirm the conclusions of the text analysis. More than a simple creation of God, Adam enjoys a special ontological condi tion, due to the fact that he is made in Gods image: not God s image, however, but rather in the image of God, i.e., structured in relation to?through, in, and unto the divine Logos, the true image of God.96 From the very moment of creation, therefore, humanity is intimately linked to 89 This influence is particularly evident in On the Resurrection of the Flesh, On the Flesh of Christ, Against the Valentinians, and On the Prescription against Heretics. See J. Alexandre, Une chair pour la gloire: L'anthropologie r?aliste et mystique de Tertullien (Paris, 2001), 165 and . . 90 See F. Loofs, Theophilus' von Antiochien "AdvenusMarcionem" und die anderen theologischen Quellen hei Irenaeus, TU 46 (Leipzig, 1930). Loofs's assertions, however, that Irenaeus was only an inept compiler of older theological traditions which he was not even capable of under standing correctly (432-34), have not convinced the scholarly commu nity (B. Altaner, Patrologie [Freiburgim Breisgau, 1938], 79; J. Quasten, Patrology, 3 vols. [Utrecht-Brussels, 1950], 1:290). 91 Colin Roberts {Manuscript, Society, and Belief in Early Christian Egypt [London-New York, 1979], 53) mentions an "early fragment... of Irenaeus's treatise Adversus Haereses that reached Oxyrhynchus not long after the ink was dry on the author's manuscript." Irenaeus's the ology is both "archaic," in the sense that it often echoes what is conven tionally called "the theology of Jewish Christianity," but also extremely relevant for later theological authorities.

BucuR the Logos, so that the Incarnation of the Logos, far from being an event "alien" to human nature, represents the fulfillment of its profound mystery. Another Irenaean passage may provide more clarity: "Propter hoc enim Ver bum Dei homo, et qui Filius Dei est, Filius hominis factus est, ut homo... fiat filium Dei. Non enim aliter percipere incorruptelam et immortalitatem nisi aduniti fuissemus incorruptelae et immortalitati. Quemadmodum autem adunari possemus incorruptelae et immortalitati nisi prius incorruptela et immortalitas facta fuisset id quod et nos, ut absorberetur quod erat corruptibile ab incorrupt ela et quod erat mortale ab immortalitate, uti filiorum adoptionem perciperemus?"97 This text speaks of deification as the rationale of the Incarnation. No mention whatsoever is made of the Fall. The demonstration is constructed not on the negative conception of being rescued from the Fall, but on the positive idea of acquiring the divine gifts of incorrupt ibility and immortality. Indeed, for Irenaeus, the Fall seems not so much the loss of a certain original perfec tion as the interruption of what ought to have been his original path, his growth unto perfection.98 In another text, drawn from the Demonstration of the Apostolic Preaching, the Fall is mentioned only after the rationale of the Incarnation is presented in similar terms: "He united man with God and wrought a communion of God and man, we being unable to have any participation in incorruptibility if it were not for His coming to us, for in incorruptibility, whilst being invisible, benefitted us nothing: so He became visible, that we might, in all ways, obtain a participation in incorruptibility."99 As John Behr notes, "The apostasy rendered the creature who had been created for immortality mortal; it did not transform an originally spiritual Adam into a merely psychical' being.... The Incarnation of the Word is thus central to the accomplishment of the divine economy, and although perhaps conditioned by the apostasy, the Incarnation was certainly not occasioned by it."100 In conclusion, according to Irenaeus, the goal inscribed in humanity's very being at the moment of creation can be accomplished only in Christ. But whence does Irenaeus receive this doctrine of Christ as the arche type of Adam? Second Temple Roots The thesis of scholars associated with the so-called reli gionsgeschichtliche Schule (Richard Reitzenstein, Wilhelm Bousset, later Rudolf Bultmann and his disciples)?that the high Christology of certain New Testament passages ought to be read against the background of allegedly older Gnostic "Urmensch" speculations of Iranian origin?has now been discarded as a scholarly myth.101 Both Gnos tic and "mainstream" Christian doctrinal speculations are more likely to have resulted from creative reworking of traditions inherited from earlier Jewish tradition, at times in conjunction with influences from the larger Hellenistic culture. Scholars of Second Temple Judaism have demon strated that "the Anthropos-figure in Gnosticism appears to derive from the divine Glory in Judaism."102 According to Gilles Quispel, the theme of God s manifestation as anthropomorphic Glory?that is, Man and Glory?can be traced from Ezekiel103 to later prophetic (e.g., Is 40:$), and apocalyptic (1 En 46.1) works, and they remain para digmatic for the articulation of cosmologica! and visionary 97 Irenaeus, Adv. haer. 3.19.1. 98 Cf.

The "heavenly Man" is also crucial for the Herm?tica, where Jewish themes are known to figure prominently.109 Of course, the treatment of the idea of "heavenly Man" as "image of God" varies in the respective groups. In the Alexandrian diaspora, the connection with Middle Platonic doctrine was inevitable.110 Consequently, "for Hellenistic Jewish mystics like Philo, the figure of man on the divine throne described in Genesis, Exodus, Ezekiel, Daniel and the Psalms... was also understood as the ideal and immortal man."111 Philos reinterpretation of the heavenly Anthropos follows a pattern of programmatic "spiritualization" or "psychologization" of apocalyptic motifs that occurs, for instance, in his treatment of the "watchers" myth.112 Nevertheless, Philo sometimes uses the designation "Man" for the Logos and, as Jarl Fossum tells us, "frequently identifies the divine image after which man was created as the Logos."113 New Testament writings (e.g., Colossians 1:15) instead, followed by both mainstream Christianity and dualistic groups, "continued the original Jewish tradition about the divine Glory, the man-like form of the essentially invisible Godhead appearing in throne theophany visions."114 This should not mean, however, that Christians simply continued to use such Second Temple imagery. Christian exegesis is also profoundly revolutionary: the belief in the incarnation of the Logos, and the centrality of Christ's death and resurrection, oper ate a spectacular "bending" of the apocalyptic framework and engender a new symbolic world.115 Nevertheless, many of the building blocks of this new symbolic world are inherited from Second Temple Judaism. Moreover, despite the very different doctrinal frame work, both dualistic and non-dualistic writings of the early centuries of the Christian era are using Jewish and Jewish-Christian midrash on Genesis, as exemplified, for instance, by the wordplay between ("light") and 6 ("man").116 Gnostics "are known to have hypostasized 104 Here, Quispel notes the esoteric speculations of the Shiur Qomah: "The extent, dimension, form or body of God is identical with his Glory.... Form, Adam, Body, Glory are interchangeable and refer to the mani festation of God" (Quispel, "Ezekiel 1:26," 3). See also the recent study by S.

Haer 1.29.2). In a number of writings found at Nag Hammadi, we read of the Man or Son of Man, or "Geradamas"?a term that, accord ing to Quispel ("Ezekiel 1:26," 4) may abbreviate "Geron Adam," thus, Adam Qadmon: On the Origin of the World 108.8-9; Letter ofEugnos tos 76.19-77.6; Apocr.

He is also called... Adam Kasia, Secret Adam, or Adakas Ziwa, Adam the Kabod. The fact that this first emanation is both celes tial Man and Glory shows that this Mandaean speculation has Israelitic roots and ultimately goes back to the first chapter of Ezekiel" (Quispel, "Ezekiel 1:26," 3). 108 "When the evil tried to penetrate into the realm of Light, God decided to go down himself and fight against it. Thereupon he called forth the Mother of Life. And she in her turn evoked the Primal Man [in Syriac nasa kadmaya - Hebrew Adam kadmon]. He goes forth to combat against darkness, is overpowered by the hostile powers, but later returns to the world above from which he originated" (Theodore bar Konai, Liber Scholiorum 11, cited in Quispel, "Ezekiel 1:26," 7). 109 In Poimandres 1.12?F., God generates a son, the Anthropos, who is androgynous, both Light and Life. The Anthropos "has the image (e ) of God," and manifests God's beautiful form ( a e ), and the bodies of humans will be fashioned by Nature accord ing to the e of the Anthropos. 110 Fossum ("Colossians i.i5-i8a" [n. 102 above], 188) notes the very probable connection, in the theological thought of Alexandrian Juda ism, between e a in Parm 130C, a e a inEzek.i:26 (LXX). 111 A.

Bucur the divine image in Gen. 1:26 as a heavenly Man."117 Among authors affiliated with mainstream Christianity, one of the most spectacular pieces of Christian midrash on Genesis is found precisely in Irenaeus. In his Demon stration Irenaeus undertakes to prove the pr?existence of the Son by quoting Genesis 1:1 in a distorted Hebrew transliteration {BaresitbaraElovim basan benuamsamen thares) of which he offers the following translation: "the Son in the beginning; God created heaven and earth."118 It is highly probable that Irenaeus was quoting, not the Genesis text, but rather a Jewish-Christian midrash in Hebrew or Aramaic, and an already existingtranslation? both incorporated in the same document.119 Obviously, since Irenaeus was himself using and pass ing on such Christian traditions?and it is significant that the quotation occurs in the Demonstration, a pro foundly traditional piece of catechetical writing?one may assume that speculations on Genesis 1:26 and Christ as the prototype of Adam must have been widespread, perhaps even part of catechetical instruction, in the sec ond and third centuries. Even though the last two sections seem to have strayed from the topic of this article, the material dis cussed in these pages was crucially important to under standing the views on the Incarnation that found their mature expression in fourteenth-century Byzantium. It should now be clear that the christomorphic anthropol ogy of Nicholas Cabasilas can boast of venerable roots in Christian tradition. Conclusions This study was prompted by a question that Florovsky raised with respect to Maximus the Confessor and the motive of the Incarnation: "What is the actual weight of the witness of St. Maximus? Was it more than his private opinion... ?"1201 hope to have furnished enough evidence to substantiate a positive answer to the latter question. In my judgment, which echoes that of numerous scholars, the Confessor believes that the Incarnation is essentially unrelated to the Fall, but is rather an expression of the primordial mystery of creation. One important element in Maximus s thought is the theological connec tion between the cosmic presence of the Logos and the incarnated Logos. The Confessor uses this link to affirm explicitly that the Incarnation was inscribed in the very design of creation, and that it represents the fulfilment of God s creative purpose. This view finds an important antecedent in Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and is echoed, albeit without the conceptual apparatus, in Isaac of Nineveh's Centuries. There is, then, a second element that supports the idea of the Incarnation as a mystery divinely predestined from eternity. It is a view of human nature that can be termed "christomorphic anthropology," inasmuch as it presupposes Christ as the prototype both of the Adamic Tertullian identifies Christ the Logos with the primordial light (Adv. Prax. 7.1); cf. Clement, Paed 1.6. For a discussion of the wordplay, see J. Fossum, "Jewish-Christian Christology and Jewish Mysticism," VChr 37 (1983): 266-67; A. DeConick, Seek to See Him: Ascent and Vision Mysticism in the Gospel of Thomas (Leiden-New York-Cologne, 1996), 22. 117 Fossum, "Colossians i.i5-i8a," 201. In the myth of Satornilus (Hip polytus, Refomn. haer. 7.28.2), the angels decide to create man in imita tion of the shining image that appears from above. It is interesting that they exhort one another saying: "let us make man after the image and likeness" ( a ' e a a a ' ). "Image" seems to constitute an entity in itself. A text espousing a similar variation of the Gnostic creation myth (Origin of the World) has a more detailed description of the manifestation from on high: as soon as the demiurge proclaims his uniqueness, a "light appears, a likeness of man, which was very beauti ful." We can, thus, conclude that the Gnostics hypostatize the "image" and identity it with the heavenly Anthropos. 118 Irenaeus, Dem. 43. According to the punctuation, "Son" could either be the object of a sentence ending with "God" ("a Son in the begin ning God created; then heaven and earth") or the subject of a sentence ending "beginning" ("a Son in the beginning; God then created heaven and earth").

For a detailed study to justify this choice and exe gesis of the passage, see pp. 289-98. Behr's translation, while deliber ately leaving the sentence unpunctuated, in order to preserve the ambi guity, agrees with the solution in SC 406 (see Irenaeus of Lyon, On the Apostolic Preaching, 109 n. 121). 119 This midrash may well have been part of a testimonia-collection, since right after the mysterious Hebrew passage, Irenaeus offers two composite quotes: the first one (Ps. 109.3 + 7l-l7)t0 De found, with the same wording, in Justin's Dialogue 76 and a fictitious one, quoted also in Lactantius, De div. inst. 4.8.1.

This view forms an important trajectory in Christian thought, uniting later Byzantine authors, most notably Nicho las Cabasilas, to earlier Byzantine hymnography and to patristic writers such as Jacob of Serug, Tertullian, Ire naeus, and stretching even further back to the very begin nings of Christian thought. Maximuss understanding of the Incarnation as related essentially to the moment of creation and not to the Fall can therefore hardly be an exception (no matter how "major" an exception) in patristic and later Byzantine theology. When, in the eighteenth century, Nicodemus Hagi orites reaffirmed this tradition, defending it against "cer tain learned men, who occupy themselves particularly with sacred theology," his confidence that he was speaking in full accord with the witness of Holy Scripture and the patristic tradition is striking.
