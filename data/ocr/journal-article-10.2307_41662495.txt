Dr. Harland, Professor of Archaeology at the University of North Carolinat has excavated their settlements and devoted most of his professional career to their study. Here he sums up the present extent of our knowledge of the middle-bronze-agé civilization of the Miny ans. LIFE IN A MlNYAN VILLAGE By J. Penrose Harland ABOUT brews were the time migrating that Abraham from Mesopotamia and the He- brews were migrating from Mesopotamia down into Palestine, the southern part of the Balkan peninsula was experiencing an invasion by a people from the north, an Indo-European people whom we may identify as the first of the Hellenes or Greeks to enter the land which they were destined to make famous. Because the distinctive type of fine gray pottery which they introduced was first found at Boiotian Orchomenos, the legendary home of the people the Greeks knew as Minyai, we may call this pot- tery "Gray Minyan" ware, and its makers the "Minyans." Gray Minyan pottery is found at digs in conjunction with the polychrome Kamares ware of Krete, which in turn has been found at several sites in Egypt in contexts dated in the time of the twelfth dynasty, ca. 2000-1800 B.c. The entrance of the Minyans upon the scene may ac- cordingly be placed in the twentieth century B.c. The Minyans found the new land inhabited by a non-Indo-European race akin to the peoples of</page><page sequence="2">Summer iç48 95 southwestern Asia Minor. That the invasion was not accomplished without a struggle is attested . by the numerous settlements which were destroyed around the beginning of the twentieth century. Excavations at numerous sites show a layer of ash separating the remains of two distinctively dif- ferent civilizations. The former inhabitants were not exterminated, but seem to have been assimi- * lated. Thus a mixed culture must have resulted, in which the Hellenic strain was clearly dominant. The Minyans spoke a dialect of Greek akin to Aiolic, which we may call "Arkadian," taking the name from the region where this dialect survived into the classical period. Embedded in the Greek language, however, we find many survivals from an older tongue,, particularly words ending in - nthos o ť-ssos, names of places or objects, such as Korinthos 'Corinth,' sminthos 'mouse,' Parnas - sos, kyparissos 'cypress tree,' and other examples. We attribute these words to the earlier people who were absorbed by the Minyans. Lack of evidence prevents us from visualizing the appearance of the invaders, but one may imagine them to have been a fairly tall race and it is possible that at least some of them were light-haired. In the Homeric epics one reads of the blond Achilleus and others with " xanthos " hair. Did these blond warriors enter the scene of history now, or with a later invasion of Hellenic people? Or did the blond-haired folk come in with both waves of invaders from the north ? A word, before we get down to business, about chronological terms. As a result of their investi- gations, archaeologists have divided the "prehis- toric" period in the Aegean area into the Neo- lithic (New Stone) Age and the Bronze Age. Metal - at first copper and then bronze, an alloy of copper and tin- appears to have come into use around 3000 B.c., a little before that date in Egypt and possibly a little later on the ifiainland of Greece. On the basis of ethnic and stylistic changes, the Bronze Age in the Aegean has been divided into Early, Middle, and Late periods, the dividing points being taken at the approximate dates 2000 and 1400 B.c. The Dorian Invasion (ca. 11S0 B.c.), and the subsequent introduction of iron into general use, inaugurated the Iron Age. Further, to differentiate and to localize the three civilizations which developed contemporane- ously in the Aegean area, that of the Bronze Age on the islands (the Kyklades) has been called the "Cycladic," that of Krete the "Minoan" (after . • the legendary King Minos of that island), and that of Hellas, the mainland of Greece, has been termed the "Helladic." Previous to Sir Arthur Evans' excavations at Knossos in Krete, this main- land civilization was called "Mycenaean" after the site of Mykenai, where Schliemann's ex- cavations in 1876 revealed to the world the early civilization which is reflected in the Homeric epics. The term "Mycenaean" is still used by some to designate the "Heroic Age," particularly the Late Helladic period, after ca. 1400 B.c. In this article, the "Minyan Age" is to be equated with the Middle Helladic period, ca. 2000-1400 b.c. Dwelling-places The Minyans seem to have introduced a new type of house into the land. The previous type, with flat roof and rectangular plan, is superseded by a curvilinear house, hairpin-shaped in plan and with a hooped roof, that is, a roof formed by bending over two rows of saplings, which form the side walls, and tying them together overhead (Figs. 1 and 2). Perhaps they interlaced small branches and twigs in the rows of saplings and in time smeared wet clay over and in the twigs, thus producing the wattle-and-daub hut (Fig. 3). In time, as they became more settled, a more permanent type of construction would evolve. The curved walls would be straightened and made parallel, and would be built of sun-dried brick resting on a raised base of stones. The stone foundation, projecting a foot or more above ground, would keep the dampness from under- mining the brick made simply of dried clay. In- cidentally, the Greek word for a brick, plinthos , betrays its pre-Hellenic origin. Then, too, the curving hooped roof would give way to a ridged roof with straight rafters running Up to the ridge- pole. The curved or apsidal end seems to have survived awhile, but the apse was difficult to build and in time it gave way to a straight back to the building. Thus was developed the megaron , the oblong building with entrance at one short side or end of the structure, which came to form the main element of the Helladic or Mainland palace. The great Late Helladic ("Mycenaean") palaces, though ultimately descended from the northern type of house exemplified by those found in Troy II, are directly derived from the Minyan house.</page><page sequence="3">Figure 2.

BRANCHES AND TWIGS WERE r INTERTWINED BETWEEN THESE SAPLINGS AND PERHAPS CLAY WAS DAUBED Ì OVER IT. IN TIME, THE CURVED END WAS SQUARED OFF AND A RIDGED ROOF REPLACED THE HOOP ROOF; THE TYPICAL MEGARON, THE OBLONG. HOUSE, RESULTED. (RECONSTRUCTION BY DR. L. B. HOLLAND.) 96 ARCHAEOLOGY The disposition of the rooms of the Minyan house was along the axis of the building, one be- hind the other, although in time additions would be made to the side. Rooms could be set off by walls of sun-dried brick or of wood or by curtains made of skins or cloth. A regular feature of the northern type of house was the fixed hearth, situated in the main room of the house. At first this served both for heat- ing and for cooking, though doubtless, as today, the baking would be done in outside ovens. The hearth would be raised several inches above the level of the floor and made of clay or of stones^ set in clay. How to get the smoke out of the house was a problem and it is questionable whether a satisfactory means of getting rid of it was ever devised. Possibly a hole was left at the top of . each gáble end of the building; but "Homer" speaks of the smoky and sooty ceiling beams or rafters, and perhaps it is best to assume that the Minyans too looked up at sooty rafters. The floors of early houses are assumed to have been of beaten or tamped clay, such as are found at many sites. The furniture must have been characterized by its scantiness, one might say by its absence. There may have been a simple framework of wood which served as bed, couch, and seat, although many may have slept on a level with the floor or at most on a raised bench of clay or stones. There may have been rude seats of .wood although likely as not these early people squatted on the floor or sat on a log or tree trunk. One may doubt the existence of tables but there may well have been chests made of wood to hold the few extra clothes or coverings. There were undoubtedly coverlets or blankets, woven by the women, which were either kept in chests or spread out on the bed or couch in the more imposing houses of the early Minyans. The interior walls of the house may have shown ; the surface of the sun-dried bricks or the walls may have been covered with a coat of clay, ap- plied in liquid form, or even by a whitewash. It is possible that the walls were decorated with the man's arms and hunting paraphernalia or trophies. Pottery A special branch of the furniture was the earth- enware equipment or pottery, which would as- tonish the average modern by reason of its great variety in shape, size, and decoration. The ex- cavator of a bronze-age site is struck by the array of vases and pots found in the ruins of a house; they range from the coarsest cooking-pot to the thin-walled jar, from the immense pithos or storage-jar to the delicate and tiny cup. There are vessels for water, wine, oil, and grain, cooking- vessels, shallow bowls, deep bowls, saucers, cups, ladles, even what may be called fruit-stands. What these people lacked in wooden furniture, they made up for in variety of ceramic ware. The fine Gray Minyan ware was made of a well levigated clay which when fired took on a dark or a light gray color. These highly polished vases, with thin walls and angular shoulders and rim, seem to have been derived from metal proto- types. I have seen no reproduction which does justice to this excellent pottery. In time, Gray Minyan gave way to a ware of similar shape and fabric but yellow in color, re- sulting from technical improvements in the kiln which raised the firing temperature. It is this</page><page sequence="4">Figure 3. Wattle-and-daub hut near Gravia in central Greece. Note at the end of the hut the SUN-DRIED BRICKS.

Summer iç48 Yellow Minyan which, following contact with the Minoans of Krete, after ca. 1800 B.c., came to receive the dark-on-light decoration of the Mino- ans and thus illustrates the fusion of the Helladic and Minoan cultures. From then on, down into the sixth century B.c., the dark-on-light style of decoration prevailed in vase and other paintings. It must be emphasized that there is no question at all of a Minoan conquest of the mainland of Greece. The shape remains Helladic (or Miny- an) ; only the form of decoration is derived from Krete, and that influence is to be explained by trade intercourse. Another characteristic ware which we would find in the Minyan house is the mattpainted pot- tery which was largely used for domestic pur- pqses, but there are some thin-walled pieces with miniature decoration which might pass also as works of art. About the time that Gray Minyan was giving way to Yellow Minyan, a polychrome mattpainted ware came into vogue, red being added to enhance the decoration. In the more pretentious houses, more -probably in the later period of the Minyans (after 1600), one might also see vessels of copper or bronze. While the domestic vessels and storage jars are usually found assembled in one room, some of these finer vases may well have been on exhibit when not in use. In addition, one might see terra- cotta figurines of deities, household gods they might be called; and small images, or venerated objects, of stone might be seen in a recess in the wall or placed elsewhere in the house. In any house, of any age, there would be loomweights and spindle whorls of terracotta, and out of doors, just as in Greece today, there would be women with the distaff, spinning, and also apparatus for carding and skeining and weaving. Probably the loom would be indoors, though some weaving to- day is done out in the open. Cloths and Clothes This brings us to the subject of dress and here we have only indirect and for the most part late evidence. But since, among primitive peoples, customs and methods change slowly if at all, per- haps one may be justified in using the evidence con- cerning dress found in the Iliad, and the Odyssey. In some opinions, these Homeric poems reflect substantially the civilization of the Late Helladic period, ca. 1400-1150 b.c., the period immedi- ately following and, for the most part, continuing the Minyan or Middle Helladic civilization. The dress of the Minyans was presumably very simple, consisting of a shirt-like undergarment and, worn over it, a sleeved cloak which reached almost to the knees. In winter a great cape or an oblong piece, similar to the himation of classical times, may have been worn. Sandals of leather, or worked oxhide, completed the attire. The woman's clothing was probably little different from the man's except that the dress would reach to the ankles. It is difficult to imagine, even this early, the absence of such jewelry as rings, brace- lets, necklaces, and hair ornaments. In an early Middle Helladic grave at Zygouries, a string of rock-crystal beads accompanied the deceased, who, at the dig, was called "Queen Zyxie," but who in the formal report of the excavations became a mere numeral. The material of clothing was doubtless wool. Of course, goat's hair and even skins of animals might also have been used, especially by the men</page><page sequence="5">Figure 4. Aphidnai, a "Minyan" site in Attica, from the south. (Photograph by J. P. H., 1921.) 98 ARCHAEOLOGY and for winter wraps. Though linen is mentioned several times in the Homeric poems, one may ques- tion its use before contact with Egypt or with Krete was established, in the eighteenth or seven- teenth century. One must imagine colored gaf- ments, for no doubt the woolen cloth was dyed. The so-called purple murex, which yielded colors ranging from red to purple, has been found in heaps in Krete as early as the Middle Minoan II period, that is, as early as 1800 b.c. It has been suggested thàt merinthos, the word for cord, string, or line, may have meant flax. At any rate, here is another non-Hellenic - or pre- Hellenic - word which had been taken over by the Hellenes early enough to appear in the Iliad. Husbandry The daily life of the Minyans must have been largely taken up with the all-important, all-absorb- ing activity of providing food for the family and livestock. Hellas, by the very nature of the land, has always been a poor country and man has had to work hard to extract a living from the soil. There is evidence that wheat, barley, and millet were grown back in the Bronze Age, the better land being sown with wheat. As for vegetables, our Minyans probably raised onions and leeks, beans, peas, lentils, and kinds of vetch. Possibly acorns formed part of their diet. Certainly they had been eaten by the previous population, to judge by the pots of acorns found in houses at Nemea. Incidentally, several Greek names for fact that the names for 'cucumber* and 'pump- vegetables, plants, and fruits are of pre-Hellenic origin, for instance erebinthos 'chick-pea.' * The kin' are non-Hellenic may be of some significance. In an orchard, but growing wild, one might see the apple, pear, the fig, and pomegranate. The word for the wild fig, olynthos , betrays by its form its non-Hellenic origin. Of great importance to these early people was the olive tree, for it pro- duced not only a food but also a cooking-oil, fuel for lamps, and also, probably this early, the soap for the people. In each house would be found simple oil lamps, as well as storage jars of olive oil. Each house may have had its own olive press nearby, or in some localities there may have been communal presses, or one man might have rented the use of his press to his neighbors, in exchange for a share of the yield. Since there is no evidence that the vine was brought to Hellas from elsewhere, it may be as- sumed to have been indigenous, and hence would have played a prominent part in the economy of the Minyans. It would seem that the "Mediter- ranean triad, " the grain, grape, and olive, formed the main staples in the diet of these early peoples as well as in the classical period. Bee-keeping is another occupation which we may with reason associate with the early peoples in Hellas. This would satisfy the need for sweets - sugar was not known - and also provide bees- wax. Honey is mentioned in both the Iliad and the Odyssey . One may add that there were me- dicinal and aromatic plants, probably wild, and also such edible seeds as poppy and sesame. Salt, so necessary to man and cattle, was probably ob- tained from sea water. Though one would hardly credit the flower garden to the Minyan household, there were wild flowers throughout the land, just as today. The traveler in Greece knows what a paradise this land is for the botanist and horticulturist. The lily was probably indigenous, but the tulip and rose, though mentioned early, may have been later imports. Other flowers mentioned in the epic poems are the crocus, violet ( ?), and hyacinth. The -nthos end- ing of the latter betrays its pre-Hellenic origin, as does narcissus.. The women probably worked in the fields, plow- ing, breaking up the clods, sowing, reaping, just as is the practice in the modern Greek countryside. H. J. Rose has attributed this custom, not to the laziness -of 'the men, but rather to the fact that agriculture was early associated with magic; it</page><page sequence="6">Figure 5.

Summer iç48 was the women who bore children and they alone would know how to make the earth bear the crops. Also, it would be the women who would be seen at home making flour, by grinding the grain on a saddle quern with a stone grinder ; and, of course, the baking in the outdoor oven would be managed by the women. Another occupation of every landholder was the care of livestock. Cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs were raised for what they produced as much as for meat. It is doubtful if cattle would be slain for meat unless on the occasion of sacrifice, and we may be sure that the common man rarely of- fered up so important a member of his family. The ox was the chief beast of burden, for plow- ing and transport. The oxhide would ultimately be put to good use but it is doubtful if the ox was slain just for this product. Cows furnished not only milk but cheese made from the milk,, and it appears from the Homeric poems that cheese was a common dish on the daily menu. Sheep and goats were kept for the wool and goat's hair, al- though the lambs and kids might be killed for meat. The donkey was doubtless used as much as to- day for transport of man and burdens. The horse does not appear in Greece until around 1600 B.c. This animal, the "mountain-ass" of the Baby- lonians, which was first domesticated in Central Asia, did not reach Krete until the Late Minoan period, in the sixteenth century; the horse appears on the Shaft Grave stelai at Mykenai close to 1600 B.c. The writer found the skull of a horse in a context at Nemea which may not be dated later than the fifteenth century. The mule was another beast of burden and draft animal. It is men- tioned numerous times in the epic poems. In one passage, it is called the "mountain- ( animal ) The goose seems to have been the only kind of fowl which would be seen around the house, al- though the dove, duck, crane, heron, swan, and other birds are mentioned by "Homer." The chicken was a late-comer to Hellas, introduced probably in the seventh century B. c. Hunting should be mentioned in any enumer- ation of the activities of the men of the Bronze Age. Though man had ceased to be primarily a hunter after he had settled down to an agricul- tural life, he still continued to hunt. Since hunt- ing had as its aim for most men the getting of meat, one would hardly class hunting as a sport. Among the animals hunted were the wild boar, deer, wild goat or ibex, wolf, and rabbits. Ducks and the other birds, mentioned above, would also be game for the hunter. The Minyan hunter probably had a hunting hound or two, and, armed with a spear or javelin and a long knife, or some- times with bow and arrows, would go out for game as often as occasion demanded or circum- stances permitted. There would be a watchdog around the house, but no cat; the latter did not arrive in Greece until the sixth century B.c. Fishing was another activity engaged in by our Middle Helladic man, although it might better be labelled as a diversion. Fish would be as common a food for the man of Chios as it was infrequent if not strange in the inland home of the Arkadian. But certainly fishing and fish receive a good deal of attention in the Homéric poems. Men fished with line and with net, with sinkers or weights of lead or stone. The Fisherman Vase, found at Phylakopi in Melos, which may be dated before 1600 B.c., shows us men walking along a beach each carrying a fish in either hand. Besides fish, other creatures of the sea were sought after and eaten, such as oysters, crabs,, sea</page><page sequence="7">Figure 6. The site of Asine on the south coast of the Argolid.

The making of this dye probably came to be a specialized industry, the work of one man and his family in a locality. The occupations previously mentioned were for the most part those of every man, carried out in every individual's home, that is, farming, raising livestock and other domesti- cated animals, making flour and baking bread, making cheese, keeping bees, spinning and weav- ing, and gathering olives and pressing them for oil; and we may include here, since the results ended up at the individual home, hunting and fish- ing. Trade and Industry However, some skills were developed which took time to master. A long apprenticeship of son working with the father must have become neces- sary for the working of metal. At first every man may have struggled by himself with the tenacious material in order to create usable tools. But it was soon found that this was a skill for the special- ist, and gradually the skilled artisan or craftsman makes his appearance in the land and ultimately in every large community. Probably the people came to associate a certain magical power or talent with the craftsman and this skill remained in the pos- session of the family, to be passed on down from father to son. The importance of the metal worker in the Bronze Age is indicated by the term applied to this craftsman even after iron had come into general use ; the village smith was still called Chalkeus 'Bronze-worker.' In the larger villages, it is possible that the dyer and the potter were specialists who gave up farm- ing and other food-obtaining pursuits in order to have time to fill all the orders brought to them. The worker in precious metals would find sufficient employment at the court of a noble or king. Other trades may have followed, such as leather-work- ing. Thus we may trace the rise of independent industry, apart from the occupations carried out at the individual homes. This brings about the beginning of trade, whereby the smith makes a mattock in return for so much wheat flour or olive oil. The storekeeper and huckster has not appeared. In the first place, there was no coinage in the Bronze Age, in the middle of which the Minyans made their appearance; without this convenient medium, trading as an independent calling could hardly exist. It seems às if the ox was the unit of value when two parties were conducting a trade ; so many bushels of grain, for example, or a fine in- laid sword, would be reckoned as equal in value to an ox. In time we find in Krete an ingot of metal moulded in the shape of a stretched oxhide. So trade there was, in our Minyan village, but it did not exist as a livelihood for an individual. Many centuries were to elapse before true coinage was invented. Just as the specialist arose in industry, so we find the bard and the seer developing professions which necessitated, or shall we say permitted, their abstention from the manual labor which oc- cupied their neighbors. According to the Homeric poems, the profession of bard was an old one, and the same is true of the seer. But the rise of the independent bard and seer postulates the</page><page sequence="8">Figure 7. The "Aspis" at Argos.

Summer iç48 101 rise of wealthy nobles and of kings. Such a condition of society seems to have existed among the Minyans of the time of the Shaft Grave Dynasty at Mykenai, but a visit to a typical Miny- an village of the twentieth or nineteenth century B.c. would have found the bard or seer able to give only spare time to this agreeable avocation. The same may be said of the village healer who was to become the physician of the classical period. While some people always would have recourse to the magician of the tribe, shaman or medicine-man, a body of common-sense medical lore would ultimately develop among a people and become the common property of all. In time some old woman or some man would come to be looked upon as a reliable doctor and a rude though often efficacious system of therapeutics would develop. Physicians are mentioned in the Iliad, but that would seem to reflect a more advanced state of society than we may be justi- fied in claiming for the Minyans. One occupation which might be mentioned is that of shipbuilder. Though many foreign im- ports on the mainland may be credited to the coming of ships with wares from Egypt, Krete, and the Eastern Mediterranean, it is only reason- able to suppose that the Minyans themselves early turned to the sea. As often pointed out, the sea is a highway, not a barrier, and the island in the distance would lure the adventurous and the curi- ous to row or sail over to investigate. We must remember that the building of the "Argo" and the Voyage of the Argonauts in quest of the Golden Fleece was associated with the Minyai and with Minyan Iolkos; and this was dated by the ancient Hellenes even before the Tro- jan War. Then, too, the colonization of the dis- tant island of Cyprus by the Arkadian-tongued Minyans from the mainland, as early as 1400 B.c., presupposes a long period of shipbuilding and sea- faring. One by-product of overseas trade developed into a lucrative calling: piracy. This was quite a respectable profession; after all, pirates stole from foreigners. And so it was not considered an insult to be asked if one were a pirate. "Strangers,. who are you?'* asks Nestor of Telemachos* u Whence do you come over the watery ways? On some trading enterprise or on adventure, just as pirates, do you wander over the sea. . . . ?" Minyan Society So far we have been discussing the Minyan as an individual. But it is obvious that, regard- less of how primitive, or, better, how simple life is, there must be some form of government and laws in every community. It is probable that early there was not what we call personal property in relation to land. The clan possessed a tract of land and each family had its own farm, and olive grove, and vineyard. The pasture-land may have been common to the clan and each family may have had the right fo graze its animals on a por- tion of it. As the growing population crowded the land, disputes must have arisen, and soon judges would have had to be appointed, for in time the chieftain or king could not, or would not, take on the much .too frequent obligation to settle disputes. We may deduce from the great wealth found in the Shaft Graves at Mykenai, those royal</page><page sequence="9">I02 ARCHAEOLOGY burials of a Minyan dynasty ruling from ca. 1700 to 1500 B.c., that the Minyans had kings. Since in an early stage of civilization conservatism is the rule and few radical changes come about, we may use the Iliad to throw light upon the govern- ment and society of the early Minyans. Probably we are justified iit assuming a rule by a king who was primus inter pares , a king who chairmanned a group of associate kings and who assembled around him the elders of the tribe or community. Doubtless the different kin^s varied in ability and power; one would be strong enough to concen- trate great wealth in the hands of the royal house- hold, another might become a mere figurehead. But we may assume that a limited monarchy was the form of government in the Minyan Age. In addition to the council of elders, there would develop a popular assembly made up of men of suitable age and capable of bearing arms. The number of officers required to conduct the duties of government would depend on the size of the kingdom or tribe. The king may have been called basileus this early;. this term is non-Hellenic and, to judge by the Homeric poems, pre-Dorian, that is, it was introduced before the last wave of in- vaders, about 1150 B.c., whom we know as the Dorians. It survived down into classical times, for example at Sparta and Argos, to mention two notable states. It survived even in non-monarchi- cal Athens in the title of a religious official, the Archon Basileus. The basileus combined the offices of civil gov- ernor, Commander in war, and earthly representa- tive of the divinity. As such, he was also judge, or chief justice among several judges. The laws,* which were in reality the accepted customs of the state or tribe, were believed to have been given by the gods to the king. W orship As to Minyan religion, we must have recourse to later evidence ; but among people recently emerged from a nomadic or migratory existence, changes in religious beliefs are apt to be trivial or at most additional. We may therefore reconstruct something of the beliefs and ritual of the Miny- ans from later analogies in archaeology and the . epic poems. On the basis of such evidence, we may assume that the religion of the Minyans was polytheistic and anthropomorphic : many gods, all thought of as in the image of Man. All primitive peoples worship a fertility god and an earth-mother god- dess, and, completing the triad, the son by their union, the vegetation, thought of as a youth. Foremost among all Hellenic peoples was the great sky- and heaven-god whom they called Zeus. Though he came to be thought of as the king of the gods, the hurler of the lightning bolt and the sender of rain,, he was after all primarily the fer- tility god who with the earth-mother brought about the continuance of the human, race, the live- stock, and the annual appearance of the crops. As for his consort, whether she was known in the Minyan period as the mother or earth-mother (which is the translation of Demeter) , or whether each locality had a special name for her, is indeter- minate. The Hera of the Argolid, the district containing such famous states as Mykenai, Tiryns and Argos, eventually won out over Dione, Danae, Alkmene, and a host of others who were local earth-mother goddesses. They came to be identi- fied with the wife of Zeus and in certain localities retained leading positions; others, such as Athena and Aphrodite, lost their original character and came to preside over other interests. As yet there was no statue of the deity and so no temple-building was needed to house it. There was doubtless some sacred tree or stone or other object which became charged with the spirit of the deity when invoked. The various sanctuaries or holy places were out in the open, at most sur- rounded by a hedge or fence or stone wall. In the house there were probably figurines of the deities who were close to the family and could be counted upon - it was hoped - to look after the welfare of the household. . From the fact that personal objects and vessels with food were placed in the graves, we know that these early Minyans believed in an after life; but what they thought this life was like, we do not know. Probably they had merely vague ideas about a life beyond, a colorless existence of the kind indicated in the Odyssey , in which Achilleus is made to say that he would prefer being a laborer on the poorest farm to being king over the dead. In discussing a civilization, its art should be mentioned, but for the earliest Minyans we have little evidence for any but the art of the potter. Perhaps we are to visualize decoration on objects which have not been discovered, or on materials</page><page sequence="10">Figure 8. The shaft graves at Mykenai. Encircled by THE DOUBLE RING-WALL OF UPRIGHT SLABS WERE THE GRAVES OF THE RULING HOUSE AT MYKENAI IN THE PERIOD BETWEEN 1700 AND 1500 b.c. Five were discovered by Schliemann in 1876 and a sixth SUBSEQUENTLY BY StAMATAKIS. THE SEVERAL THOUSAND OBJECTS OF GOLD FOUND IN THESE GRAVES SHOWED THAT HOMER WAS JUSTI- FIED in calling Mykenai "rich in gold." Objects of silver, BRONZE, VARIOUS STONES, CLAY, SHELL, AMBER, ETC., WERE ALSO FOUND ACCOMPANYING THE NINETEEN BODIES BURIED HERE. NOTABLE AMONG THESE FINDS ARE THE BRONZE DAGGERS INLAID WITH GOLD, SILVER, AND BLACK NIELLO, WHICH DISPLAY A REMARKABLY HIGH* DEGREE OF ARTISTIC SKILL. {J. P. H. PHOTO.) Summer iç48 103 such as wood and cloth which have perished. At the peak of Minyan civilization, however, we have the amazing wealth and artistry of the contents of the' six Shaft Graves at Mykenai. The thousands of objects of gold, silver, bronze, terracotta,, stone, semi-precious stones, wood, shell, amber, and other materials elicit admiration from all who have seen them. Special mention must be made of the bronze daggers inlaid cunningly with gold, silver, and black niello. The life and movement depicted on these daggers, masterpieces not merely of Hel- ladic art but of the art of all time, make the be- holder agree with H. R. Hall, that veritably these people could paint with metal. There is no evidence of writing among the Minyans. It is hard to conceive of a people carry- ing on so extensive a commerce in gold, amber, ivory, and other exotic products, with outsiders, and particularly with Egypt and Krete, both of which had established systems of writing, without being able to write themselves ; but nothing more than potters' marks has been found. Social Life The life of the Minyan has been pictured as austere, one of unremitting toil and duty. How- ever, man became industrious through necessity, and, human nature being essentially the same in all ages, man is ever ready to relax when the neces- sity disappears, even momentarily. We may safely assume that the normal Minyan left his work when circumstances permitted. We must also bear «in mind the close connection between re- ligious functions and social entertainment. To the Hellenes of all periods the holy day has been a holiday. Our Minyan villager may not have had a day of rest every seven days but, scattered through the year, were easily fifty days on which he could claim a holiday because of some religious function. There were the birth of a child, the coming of age of his neighbor's son, the marriage of a rela- tive, the death of a friend with the funeral games, and the numerous festivals and sacred days asso- ciated with the gods. There were happy as well as "brave men before Agamemnon"; our Minyan may not have found life all beer and skittles, but he probably did not allow himself to become a sullen slave to physical needs and duties. The Minyan seems to have been a humane and peaceful fellow. After taking the land from the "Indians" of his day - always a justifiable act from the point of view of the conqueror - the Miny- an seems to have lived a peaceful life. There was no need of walled towns and no indication of warfare; no concentration camps, nor murder of non-combatants. On the whole, the writer of this pro-Minyan article, if offered the choice of living in the twen- tieth century B.c. or the twentieth century A.D., would be inclined to say, "I'll choose the former and live with the more civilized Minyans. Of course, I want to take along with me some books, chocolate, and Crane's plumbing, and it is to be understood that I am to be exempt from all man- ual labor on any farm. The final condition is that I am to be appointed for the duration the bard of the village - but who would listen to me, playing a musical instrument?"</page></plain_text>
