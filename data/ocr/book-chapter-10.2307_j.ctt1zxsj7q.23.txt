<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Joseph Brodsky’s “To My Daughter” (A Reading) Chapter 19 Joseph Brodsky’s “To My Daughter” 391. (A Reading) 1 Chapter 19 Joseph Brodsky is a bundle of contradictions. This statement might be pro- blematic if he were a philosopher, but his consistent incons istency makes  perfect sense to those studying his primary sta tus — that of poet. Stoic  toward the arbitrariness of the world order (or disorder), deeply melan- cholic (if not corrosively skeptic al) about “human nature,” yet passionately  bel ieving in language’s ontological priority as the only thing (note this  word) in human existence approaching a genuine God-term, Brods ky  could be maddening in the sheer outrageousness, the “demanding-the  m aximum-and-the-hell-with-the-rest” quality, of his metaphorical thinking.  But that is what poets, especially great poets, do — they challenge our  cognitive, emotional, aesthetic and metaphysical constants with their  sprung logic. And Brodsky could do this with the best of them, including  his teachers Mandelstam and Tsvetaeva, whose own metaphorical thinking  and contrary, “vert ical” argumentation the younger poet extended not only  into the texture of his verse but also into that of his prose essays. As Lotman, following Jakobson, has suggested with his charact eristic precision,  there are only two ways to make meaning (“new information”) out of lan- guage: either we can assert a similarity between two different things or we  can assert a difference between two things taken to be similar.2 In both ca- ses, however, we are dealing with a process akin to rhyme — the coexistence  of similarity within difference. But poets and poetry, roughly speaking, begin  by scaling the metaphorical axis, which means that they are drawn to see  the sameness in items or ideas that most of us would not choose to link up  otherwise. This accounts for both the inspiring “shock of recognition” (this  is really bold and fasci nating) and the deflating “realization of improbability”  (this is more ingenious than it is real) that often go with our responses to  poetic, that is, metaphoric logic. Along the so-called metonymic axis, on  the other hand, the one we generally associate with novelistic thinking,  there is “contiguity,” which is to say there exists an a priori attitude toward  things and ideas which before now we might have seen as “alike” by virtue  of their proximity in time and space but which now we begin to distinguish  among and to see as “nuanced,” as different. Operating in his primary mode  (which is only a tendency), the novelist will give you five differ ent names for  1 Originally appeared 2 See Iurii M.

Neither of these viewpoints ever “wins,”  but it is important to realize before turning to Brodsky’s conc rete practice  as a poet that everything he believed in and dedic ated his life to (and, while  he often went on record as saying that he would prefer if we didn’t mention  it, suffered for) relates to the “truth” of poetic thinking. Poets live in heroic  simultaneity, since few people would be willing to stake their lives on the  proposition that a window is an eye; it is simply too hard, too risk-laden,  to believe in this as a way of being in the world. It is far easier to live in a  world of prosaic distinction, where everyt hing is both part of something  else, either prior in time or adjac ent in space, and a “logical” extension of it. But let us return to the “matter” (Brodsky’s pun, as we shall see) at hand.  In order to understand a Brodsky poem, it is cruc ial to understand first  something about his thinking, or, as he would have said it, “vector.” He  himself might have denied this or argued something to the effect that the  poem “speaks for itself,” but here I think he is being as ever the contrarian:  Brodsky, at least the Brodsky of his later years, is not very understandable  “on his own.” His metaphors have coalesced into a kind of “syst em,” but  one whose verbal layering and retrieval, whose archaeo logy if you will, is  consistently non-rational, paradoxicalist, fragmentary (both in image and  method), and defiant of any explanation from origins. In this respect, his  poems need his essays, his essays need his poems, and even then the  reader needs to come to his words with a certain amount of additional  informat ion in tow. His words always make us think, and that is good, but  it is even better if we have enough information so that our thinking is at  least on the right track. For example, here is a sent ence from Brodsky’s  late essay “A Cat’s Meow”: “Now, matter, I believe, comes to articulate itself  through human science or human art presumably only under some kind of  duress.”3 This statement is, I would argue, completely incomprehensible  to most non-specialist readers. How can matter, which whether organic or  inorganic is as far as we know pre-conscious, come to articul ate itself, i.e.  to perform a conscious act? How can it experience duress? In what sense  does matter articulate itself through scie nce or art? In short, these words  seem intentionally riddling, too clever by half, arch, and possibly insincere —  3 Joseph Brodsky, On  Grief and Reason: Essays (New  York: Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux,  1995), 310. </page> <page sequence="3"> Joseph Brodsky’s “To My Daughter” (A Reading) i.e. made for effect rather than for their truth value. However, as I will try  to demonstrate in the remainder of this essay, these words make perfect 393. sense in the context of Brodsky’s “voice zone,” prior his tory, and the larger Chapter 19 Russian lyric tradition that gave him his start. They even make sense, albeit  highly idiosyncratic, in terms of the Anglo-American tradition (Auden, Lowell,  Frost, Hardy, etc.) that he eventually made his own. Not only are these  words not insincere, they are an article of faith, incredibly “hot” while giving  every appearance of being maximally cool (metaphorical thinki ng, as we  have been saying, forces powerful differences into cohabitation), and the  “reason” (or Logos) underlying the belief that allows the poet to keep his  love alive in that most vulnera ble of all positions — when the dying father  has to say goodbye to the baby daughter who will never know him outside  of some “wooden” words. Let us begin with the poem itself, published by Brodsky in the Times Literary  Supplement on 2 December 1994: To My Daughter4 Give me another life, and I’ll be singing 1 in Cafe Rafaello. Or simply sitting 2 there. Or standing there, as furniture in the corner, 3 in case that life is a bit less generous than the former. 4 Yet partly because no century from now on will ever manage  5 without caffeine or jazz, I’ll sustain this damage, 6 and through my cracks and pores, varnish and dust all over, 7 observe you, in twenty years, in your full *ower. 8 On the whole, bear in mind that I’ll be around. Or rather, 9 that an inanimate object might be your father, 10 especially if the objects are older than you, or larger. 11 So keep an eye on them always, for they will no doubt judge you. 12 Love those things anyway, encounter or no encounter. 13 Besides, you may still remember a silhouette, a contour, 14 while I’ll lose even that, along with the other luggage. 15 Hence, these somewhat wooden lines in our common language. 16 There are certain skeletal “facts” about this poem that one should have in  mind before taking the first step toward understanding or “interpreting”  it. First of all, these verses are, as the title says, written to the poet’s  daughter — Anna Maria Alexandra, who was born on 9 June 1993, to  Brodsky and his wife Maria Sozzani. Thus at the time of this writing, the  little girl, named in honor of Anna Akhmatova and Brodsky’s parents  4 After its initial ap- pearance in TLS, “To My Daugh ter”  was then col lected in Brodsky’s  book of verse So Forth: Poems,  published posthu mously in  1996 by Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux  (New York). </page> <page sequence="4"> RussianR Leiatdeirnagtu Rreu:s Bsiacnk gWrroituenrds,  RFeoaredginrogu Tnhde,m selves and Others Reading Russian Writers Reading  Creative Cognition Themselves and Others (Maria and Alexander), was a year and a half old, while the father had little  394. more than a year to live (Brodsky would die of longstanding heart prob- PART III lems on 28 January 1996). Second, the poem is, technically speaking, written in a cadence that could be  called a loose heroic hexameter, one which Brodsky would be familiar with  from both the Russian and the English: most lines have six metrical stresses  (exceptions: II. 1, 2 and 10), the anacrusis (the unstressed syllable[s] leading  up to the first stress) “wanders” here (cf. the Russian hexameter should have  zero anacrusis), the intervals between metrical stresses are normally one  to two syllables (typical for the Russian), and the clausula (the unstressed  syllable[s] following the last stress) is constantly one syllable (also typical for  the Russian). While the Russian practice of hexameter use avoids rhyming,  Brodsky’s English practice here does not: instead of unrhymed femin ine  endings (the “heroic” or “Gnedich” expectation), we have rhymed ones,  deployed in a sym metrical, 4-quatrain scheme of aabb (the exception  being I. 12). Brodsky’s rhymes are often not “pure” but slant and quite in- ge nious. His use of enjambment, especially in the poem’s opening lines, is  striking, and begs to be “semanticized” in the context of slipped metrical  stresses. Likewise, his use of intonational pauses (the “caesura”) skips  around in this poem, which is more typical for English practice, while it would  have remained in one place (i.e. it would have been part of the meter) in  Russian. We will return to these formal issues, and most pointedly to that  of English versus Russian hexameter, in a moment. And third, in terms of diction or stylistic register, this poem is as “matter-of- fact,” as implicitly “unlyrical,” and as apparently stripped bare of high culture  (often Brodsky’s trademark else where), as is its primary theme of furniture  and inorganic “thingness.” The only factual curiosity in the poem, other  than the speaker’s tendency to project himself into the future not only as  deceased but precisely as an “inanimate object,” is the refer ence to Cafe  Rafaello. There is indeed such a place in Manhat tan, on 7th Avenue South,  near where Brodsky, himself clearly a product of a century that could not  manage without caffeine or jazz, once lived in Greenwich Village. The Italian  resonances in its name would not be lost on a poet who had written so  much about and “to” Venice, Rome, antiquity, classical poets, thinkers and  statesmen, and who was now contemplating his own demise and entry into  history from precisely this location. These facts are what we need to get started on the poem. But they don’t yet “mean.”  And in this respect, it is the “typical” critic’s move from the one to the other,  </page> <page sequence="5"> Joseph Brodsky’s “To My Daughter” (A Reading) from the inanimate/descriptive (the “form” of a hexameter or a chair) to the  animate/conscious (these things’ inner illumination through an unexplained 395. and unexplainable use of language), that the poet in Brodsky always resisted. Chapter 19 Even when he spoke about others’ verse, say Frost’s or Hardy’s in On Grief and  Reason, he always minimized the bio graphical element (all the while giving  his students or his read ers enough to ground his statements in something)  and tried to show how poetic language worked from the inside. So “To My  Daughter” doesn’t mean, doesn’t become a poem, because the speaker is  soon to die and his daughter is starting life, or because the Cafe Rafaello is  near his old home in Greenwich Village. Nor does the knowledge alone that  his words are framed in hexa meters make his poem mean either, although  this is, technically speaking, closer to the truth. Facts, and biographical  facts a fortiori, do not “cause” meaning (the — to Brodsky — much-detested  explanation from origins); they merely give it a place to be born. How these  facts become meaning is through language. Thus, such vintage Brodsky “one- liners,” already familiar to readers of Less than One, as “to make a long story  short, a poet shouldn’t be viewed through any prism other than that of his  poems”; or “it is language that utilizes a human being, not the other way  around”; or “The last bastion of realism, biography is based on the breath- taking premise that art can be explained by life”; or, if “what critics do” is to  “subordinat[e] literature ... to history,” what poets do is the opposite.5 In a word, Brodsky had a romantic view of the poet, but one that he tempered  with large doses of adoptive democratic spirit, irony and humor (another  paradox). He shared with Tsvetaeva her disdain for the critic as the poe`te  manque ́, the one whose defi nitions and terms inevitably fail because they  can never get to the vantage of the other. The poet was special, but not  because he was uniquely endowed in a way he could take personal credit  for or enjoy or use in and as “life.” Rather, he was nothing more or less  than the site where language, in its mythical role as some thing older and  greater than the State or History (note the explana tion from origins doing  flips over itself here), brought meaning to life. A poem that succeeds is,  therefore, according to Brodskian sprung logic, literally an inanimate life  form. By the same quirky token, poetic language is permanent, but not  because it can be preserved on papyri or computer disks. It is so because  it is the intersection of the finite and the animate, i.e. the human being, on  the one hand, and the infinite and the inanimate, i.e. matter per se, on the  other. Don’t look for meaning in anyone’s life, includ ing the poet’s; human  history is hopelessly anthropomorphic and solipsistic; better, as the poet  5 Brodsky, On Grief and Rea- vive whether published or not: be- istential process; it uses thinking for  son, 315, 333, 85, 313.

Note that the stress here is  not language’s vague anthropomor phic immortality (Yeatsian birds keeping  drowsy emperors awake, etc.) but precisely its character as materiality, as  something that has outgrown human pain but is able — indeed fated — to  contain it. Rather than the miracle of Christian Logos, the word-become- flesh, it is, again quite literally and along a trajectory that Brodsky repeated  obsessively in his mature verse, the flesh-become-word, or, to use another  familiar metaphor, the poet become his own “part of speech.”7 But where, finally, do Brodsky’s views on poetic language, as opposed to the  poetic locutions themselves, come from? And if language is the God-term,  then what, if any, is its creed? The answers to these questions provide a  segue back into “To My Daughter” and its enigmatic meaning. Brodsky  saw a poem’s prosodic manifold as a virtual memory bank whose contents  could be drawn upon to invoke an entire tradition. This was especially  true of his work as a Russian lyric poet: in general, the Russians have  been much more aware of the links between the history of a prosodic form  and its semantic and thematic “aureole” than have their English-speaking  colleagues. For Brodsky, as for Mandelstam before him, Mnemosyne (mother  of the Muses) and the memory of — “musing” about — prior poetic forms  each of which allows one to say certain things in a certain way are syn onyms  or at least collateral hypostases. Such is “history” from a poet’s point of  view and such is the notion Brodsky has in mind when he writes of poetic  language as “restructured time” and as possessing, despite its indifference  to human tragedy, the attributes of a “personality” or a (Mandelstamian)  soul/psyche. In any event, when the poet once said goodbye to another  child, his son Andrei, in a poem that was written on the eve of his exile to  the West, the form that he invoked in “Odysseus to Telemachus” (“Odissei  Telemaku,” 1972) was blank verse (unrhymed iambic pentameter). The form  had an interesting Russian genealogy that went back to various instances  in Zhukovsky, Pushkin, Ogaryov, Blok, Gumilev, Khodasevich, Knut, Akh- matova and Brodsky himself (e.g. “A Halt in the Wilderness” (“Ostanovka  v pustyne,” 1966).8 Its thematics, established (as so much else) irrevocab- ly when Pushkin rewrote Zhukovsky’s “Perishability” (“Tlennost’,” 1816),  itself a rather pale translation from the German (Hebel), into the great  6 Brodsky, On Grief and uncollected essays, reviews, 8 My comments here owe  Reason, 109. and interviews.

But it was with Chapter 19 the startling fusion of the lyrical and the prosaic (the unrhymed quality, the  simpler, more straightforward diction, etc.) that Pushkin set the semantic  and thematic “tone” for the form on Russian soil. Moreover, the longer  “breath” of the line, a concept dear to both Mandelstam and Brodsky, had  in this case not only the more obvious “Shakespearean” associations (i.e.  the source for blank verse models in Pushkin). In Brodsky’s “A Halt in the  Wilderness,” for example, the return motif had definite classical or “antique”  markings as well — what had once been a Greek Orthodox Church (with  its potential links to both Hellen ism and Christianity) had now become a  modern “concert hall”; thus Pushkin’s affirmation of mortality and of the  necessary ascendance of youth has turned in Brodsky into something ironic  and skeptical — the ghastly Sovietism kontsertnyi zal. And simi larly, the  application of a classically stylized biography in “Odysseus to Telemachus”  is meant both to show (not without a certain irony) the ancient in the  modern and to foreground the poet’s culture and sophistication in an  otherwise barbarous state. The Greeks, Circe, Poseidon, Palamedes, Oedipus,  etc. — these are the refer ence points out of which the poet constructs his  tale of betrayal and exile, and his method has clear antecedents in the  high modernist tendencies and neo-classicist display of such exemplars as  Mandelstam, Akhmatova and Tsvetaeva. But here the return to the scene of  the action is not a homecoming but a pause before banishment. The Brodsky who writes “To My Daughter” is a very different creature, however.  Or to be precise, he is the same Brodsky, but he has moved so far along  his original “self-estranging”9 trajec tory as to be virtually unrecognizable  to all but his most persis tent readers.10 Thus, instead of a high modernist  “martyrological” biography (the poet — Mandelstam and Akhmatova — as  Christ or Mary figures) that once implicated him (the “Christ child”11), the  eschewal of biography altogether as a category of poetic understanding;12  9 Cf.

Or simply sitting there. Or standing there, as furniture in the corner,  in case that life is a bit less generous than the former. What, now that we have come this far, could they possibly mean? To begin with,  that the poet knows his days are numbered but that were he to be granted a  stay of execution (“another life”), he would nevertheless choose to return to  these familiar surround ings and to his role as singer.15 Singing and returning,  taken together, imply the notion of rhyme, or poetic echo. The openi ng two  lines are, for this reader, terribly poignant and already storing up a lifetime of  meaning because they implicate a return as inanimate matter — language —  even as they hint at, with the “falling-off” of their repeated enjambments  (“singing / in” and “sitting / there”) and the insufficiency of their metrical  stresses (5 instead of the soon-to-be-established hexametric 6, with only  4 realized in I. 2),16 the arrival of death itself. So painful is it for this poet to  get a full “breath,” so weak is this heart that skips beats, that by the time  his language stabilizes into a pattern (I. 4),17 “he” will no longer be there.  He will, instead, with the help of the caesural (i.e. temporally refining) “or’s,”  be turning into something, or some thing: from “singing” poet, to “sitting”  bystander, to furniture “standi ng” in the corner.

The next stanza projects the poet’s new status as “dead-wood” into the future: Chapter 19 Yet partly because no century from now on will ever manage  without caffeine or jazz, I’ll sustain this damage, and through my cracks and pores, varnish and dust all over,  observe you, in twenty years, in your full ower. It is important that as Brodsky is saying goodbye to his daughter, he is doing so  in terms of a new-world urban culture that he has made his own and that is  hers by birthright — New York, a cafe atmosphere, the stimulation of caffeine,  the improvisation of jazz. This is a culture that, for better or worse, does not  look back (“no century from now on”) and seems to thrive on free and open  forms. What is left out of course is the dialogue between father and daughter  that will never take place. For what possible need could there be for poetry,  for Mnemosyne and her prosodic memory bank, in this atmosphere? The  “damage” here is thus not only to the eventual petrification of the poet’s  memory as man and father, but to his language, which is not “native,” not  completely “fluent.” It, Brodsky’s English-language verse, is in some crucial  sense inorganic: it will have to strain through the wages of time and a  palpable artificiality, “through my cracks and pores, varnish and dust all over,”  with their fusion of human and inhum an wounds, in order to be present at  the very organic bloss oming of the daughter’s young adulthood (“in your  full flower”). Given all this, how is it then that the poet will not only not mind  that he has died but that he has become furniture, and neglected, if not  downright abused, furniture at that? At this point, it might be helpful to recall that Brodsky comp leted several essays  at the same time he wrote “To My Daughter,” all of which shed considerable  light on this and the following quatrains.18 Of these, perhaps the long  Hardy piece, “Wooing the Inanimate,” is the most germane. Hardy turns  out to be a remarka bly congenial figure to Brodsky, and the fact that the  latter was thinking about this “pre-modern” near the time of his death is  by no means coincidental. Hardy’s status as autodidact, along with his  compensatory passion for reading Greek and Roman classics, were definitely  Brodsky’s.19 So too were the “predominance [in Hardy] of the rational over  18 For example, “Wooing and Reason, p 299–311), 19 On Grief and Reason,  the Inanimate: Four Poems by Brodsky’s talk on the sources 321.

The  last Hardy poem that Brodsky discusses is “Afterwards.” The teacher here  has presumably saved the best for last: it is this poem, written near the  end of Hardy’s life, that serves as a kind of “exegi monumentum” — what  will be left behind after the poet is gone. Hardy has mapped his absence  onto the four seasons in their natural habitats (Hardy was as much a nature  poet as Brodsky was urban), each presented in a quatrain that ends (both  Hardy and Brodsky are famous for their “punch lines”) with an enigmatic  statement about how this disappearance might be registered as either  meaning or non-meaning. The “overall sensation,” as Brodsky says, is  suffused with the “future perfect tense.”23 But it is Brodsky’s comments  on the interrelationship of form to meaning that is most apposite to our  discussion of “To My Daughter”: These twenty hexametric lines are the glory of English poetry,  and they owe all that they’ve got to hexameter.24 The good  question is to what does hexameter itself owe its appearance  here, and the answer is so that the old man can breathe more  easily. Hexameter is here not for its epic or by the same classi- 20 For example, Brodsky ple, ““An aged thrush, frail, gaunt, own work, see Bethea, Jo-  would have felt great affinity for and small, / In blast-beruffled seph Brodsky, 68–70. what he calls Hardy’s “eye/ear/ plume” [a line from Hardy’s 23 On Grief and Reason,  mind-boggling stanzaic designs poem “The Darkling Thrush”] is, 367–8. unprecedented in their never- of course, Hardy’s self-portrait. 24 Calling Hardy’s lines  repeating patterns” (On Grief and Famous for his aquiline profile, “the glory of English poetry”  Reason, 319–20). with a tuft of hair hovering above demonstrates once again how  21 Brodsky, On Grief and a bald pate, he had indeed a bird- willing Brodsky was to go against  Reason, 319, 322, 331, 332, 333, like appearance   — in his old age critical commonplace (i.e. Hardy’s  348, 361. especially, judging by the available stature as an interesting but not  22 The connection be- photographs” (On Grief and Rea- “great” pre-modern) if the latter  tween “birdlike” and “bardlike” son, 330).

On the subconscious level, this comfort 401. translates into the availability of time, into a generous margin. Chapter 19 Hexameter, if you will, is a moment stretched, and with every next  word Thomas Hardy in “Afterwards” stretches it even further.25 This gloss on “Afterwards,” is, I submit, the point of departure for Brodsky’s  poem, or vice versa: either way, Brodsky was thinking about Hardy’s death- defying hexameters set in nature as he devised his own set in a Manhattan  coffee house. The “generous margin” that the hexameters give is precisely  what is needed in case that life is a bit less generous than the former.  They are the breath the (prematurely) “old man” in Brodsky is looking for.  That Hardy’s, and English-language verse’s, hexameters rhyme, while their  Russian counterparts do not, shows Brodsky making the bold (that is, self- estranging) gesture of immortalizing himself in a formal pattern that was  not his to begin with.26 Everything he says about the formal character of  Hardy’s “auto-elegy” could be said about his own: “the stressed words  here are two and three syllables long,” “the unstressed syllables play the  rest of these words down with the air of a postscript or an afterthought,”  the caesuras are “bravely shifted,” etc.27 In fact, “Afterwards,” with “all its  peregrin ation of stresses,” its “self-referential metaphor” of “an interrupted  yet resuming sound,” and its “thirst for the inanimate,” could be called an  extended rhyme partner to “To My Daughter.”28 And as strange as it may  sound, “Give me another life, and I’ll be singi ng / in Cafe Rafaello” is a kind of  translation, transposed into Brodsky’s new world idiom, of the late Victorian  “When the Present has latched its postern behind my tremulous stay,” the  first line of “Afterwards.” With this lengthy aside, we are now ready for the third stanza of Brodsky’s poem: On the whole, bear in mind that I’ll be around. Or rather, that an inanimate object might be your father, especially if the objects are older than you, or larger.  So keep an eye on them always, for they will no doubt judge you. One might not make so much of the formal aspects of Brodsky’s verse here if  he himself had not drawn attention to similar issues in Frost and Hardy.  In the entire poem, there are only three lines (1, 2 and 10) in which the  number of metrical stresses is fewer than 6 (the hexametric expectation).  The line “that an inanimate object might be your father” is one of them:  _ _ _ * _ _ * _ _ * _* _ . Indeed, in this line not only are the metrical stresses  fewer (5, with the first being omitted), but the actual number of fulfi lled  25 On Grief and Reason, 27 On Grief and Reason,  366. 367, 370. 26 Note that Brodsky 28 On Grief and Reason,  changes Hardy’s rhyme scheme 373.

Why? Because these are  PART III the parts of the poem where the theme of metamorphosis — man/father  to furniture/inanimate object versus child/daughter to “in full flower” —  comes most palpably to the surface, where the father reaches out to  the daughter first from “this side” of the change, i.e. as he senses the  “petrification” coming on, then from the “far side,” after he has already  become the inanimate object and is no longer recognizable, except in  the “wooden” language itself.29 As Brodsky says at the end of the Hardy  essay, in a statement repeated verbatim in “A Cat’s Meow”: “language  is the inanimate’s first line of information about itself, released to the  animate.”30 If the daughter would like to know who the father was and  where “he” is now, she should ponder these lines.31 For he is passing on to  her what might be termed the “long view,” the sense that it is not we who  judge and possess the world (“things”), but the other way around (“for they  will no doubt judge you”). “To put it perhaps less polemically,” concludes  Brodsky in “A Cat’s Meow,” “language is a diluted aspect of matter. By mani- pulating it into a harmony or, for that matter, disharmony, a poet — by and  large unwittingly — negotiates himself into the domain of pure matter —  or, if you will, of pure time — faster than can be done in any other line of  work.”32 This is what the poet means when he says, in his typical offhand  way (e.g. “on the whole”), that he will “be around.” Why “judge you” is the  only non-rhyme in the poem is a tantalizing puzzle. My guess is that while  inanim ate matter, including the particles that were once her father, will  one day judge Anna Maria Alexandra, the speaker of these lines cannot yet,  while he is still alive, include her in this ontol ogical echo-chamber, where  birth inevitably leads to its rhyme partner, physical dissolution and death.  That is not yet thinka ble, and thus she, so animate and vulnerable, is not  yet part of this process. The judgment that is literally in the phrase has not  been, as it were, poeticized — its clock has not begun ticking. Brodsky ends his poem with the self-deprecating wit that has always been  his special signature as a poet. Hardy’s “Afterwards” concluded with lines  invoking one of Brodsky’s favorites, John Donne and his famous “and  therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee”: And will any say when my bell of quittance is heard in the gloom, And a crossing breeze cuts a pause in its outrollings,  Till they rise again, as they were a new bell’s boom, “He hears it not now, but used to notice such things?” 29 Note that Brodsky 30 On Grief and Reason, “Ideally, perhaps, the animate  returns to the same caesural 311, 374; my emphasis. and the inanimate should swap  use of “or” (“Or rather”) in the 31 Cf. the following places”; “For the only opportunity  preceding line (9) that he had excerpts from “A Cat’s Meow”: available for the animate to swap  used in the opening lines (2 and 3) “what human inquiry indeed places with the inanimate is the  of the poem. boils down to is the animate former’s physical end: when  interrogating the inanimate”; man joins, as it were, matter”;  </page> <page sequence="13"> Joseph Brodsky’s “To My Daughter” (A Reading) The question in Hardy shows his irony, his pessimism, his willi ngness to take,  in his phrase, “a full look at the worst.” The bell is, to repeat, the “self- 403. referential metaphor,” the notion of “interr upted yet resuming sound,” that Chapter 19 is the poet’s principal legacy — his poetry itself. But will anyone notice the  bells’ tolling, and if they do, will they link them with the consciousness  that first pondered them and gave them verbal form? Brodsky was clearly  a reader who heard the tolling of Hardy’s bells, and so now he looks for an  analogous listener in his own posterity: Love those things anyway, encounter or no encounter.  Besides, you may still remember a silhouette, a contour,  while I’ll lose even that, along with the other luggage.  Hence, these somewhat wooden lines in our common language. The Hardian irony is there, the sense that what the poet was as a human being  and what he lived for could possibly be lost entirely — no one may notice the  sounding bells that were his consciousn ess.33 This inanimate-to-animate  encounter with his beloved offspring may, after all, not take place, since  there may not be enough left of “him” — or the particles that were once him,  the “even that” — to register her animation on his total lack of it. But despite  all that, he urges gratitude and willing sacrifice: “Love those things anyway.”  Her remembering, if she can manage it after all the years, would be a return  on the level of life (her domain): the “silhouette” or “contour” of a small  child’s murky memories of a departed father. His return, however, is the  more heroic, since he knows beforehand that he will have lost everything and  have joined ontological forces with his final rhyme pair: luggage/ language.  Still, he celebrates. The “hence” is the “explanation” we have been waiting  for. His response to becoming “luggage” is the slightest shift of breath, and  the last word — “language.” The puns, the ability of the words to say two or  more things at once, in “these somewhat wooden lines” and “in our common  language” give the reader parsing them after the poet’s death the feeling  that he is still with us. For these lines are wooden, in the sense that they  are intentionally flat (unlyrical) and at the same time they are not: their lack  is full of love, pain, feeling.
