<plain_text><page sequence="1">Wounds In Medieval Mongol Warfare: Their Nature and Treatment in The Secret History, with some notes on Mongolian Military Medicine and Hygiene. SOPHIA C. KASZUBA SCIENCE AND MEDICINE LIBRARY, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO. In the West, military medicine in the Middle Ages shows that theory was often stronger than practice. The theory was based on observation, and on the knowledge handed down from Greek and Arab medicine, but the practice was curtailed by the inability to prevent pain, or the infection of wounds. Lieutenant-Colonel Fielding H. Garrison, in his Notes on the History of Military Medicine, writes: ... while there was a remarkable upward trend in the thirteenth century and much was eventually accomplished in military surgery and preventive medicine, anatomy, physiology and pathology were almost non-existent ....1 The West in the Thirteenth Century, however, had a few physicians who were well ahead of their time. Henri de Mondeville, the physician to King Philip the Fair of France, wrote in a treatise on surgery in A.D. 1316 recommending an essentially modern treatment for wounds of the large intestine: He advised that if the large intestine were wounded it should be sutured - 'as furriers sew a skin/ The wounded intestine should then be replaced in the abdominal cavity and the abdominal wall sutured. He saw wounds of this sort, sutured and closed immediately, heal in a short time with a single dressing.2 But this level of expertise in a physician was unusual. During the Middle Ages and the feudal wars, most physicians were attached to courts or nobles. The</page><page sequence="2">60 Mongolian Studies, 1996 soldier, even if he did get medical attention, died from his wounds more often than not. Rarely could he hope for treatment from so expert a physician as Mondeville. Even illustrious military leaders, who received medical attention, died. King Richard I of England died at the siege of Châlus, in A.D. 1199, after an unskillful arrow extraction from his shoulder.3 Edward I, however, recovered from an arrow wound in A.D. 1272, when an army surgeon excised his wound.4 In the Byzantine Empire, after the reign of Justinian I (A.D. 527-565), the army was organized on essentially modern principles, and included a Medical Corps: In his treatise on strategy the Emperor Mauritius (582-602) introduced a kind of sanitary formation for his cavalry, consisting on 8-18 unarmed deputati, assigned to every detachment of 200 to 400 men, in addition to physicians. This [sic] sanitary personnel, later called scribones, followed the fighting columns at a distance of 200 feet in order to bring the severely wounded out of danger during an engagement....5 Other armies in the West, while they had attached physicians, appear not to have had this equivalent of an ambulance corps. The treatises of the period on military medicine deal frequently with arrow wounds. In his textbook, Mondeville gives three general rules for the extraction of arrows: the physician should first examine the "position of the arrow, its degree of visibility, its composition in wood or metal, its size, the possibility of poison on it, the advisability of enlarging the wound, the location of the wound, and the complications of dirt and pebbles carried into it .... The second rule is to extract as delicately and swiftly as possible, and the third is to staunch the flow of blood."6 In a series of 1,262 miniatures that accompany the Troubadour Songs in Praise of St. Mary, commissioned in the Thirteenth Century by Alfonso the Learned of Castile, there are six pictures that tell the story of a wound and a recovery. A knight has been shot in the neck by a bolt from a crossbow. Surgeons attend him in home surroundings. The bolt resists extraction. His head is bandaged to staunch the bleeding. He clings to a pillar in pain. An innovation is tried: the physicians attempt to fire a crossbow in reverse in order to remove the imbedded projectile. This fails. The wounded knight is then helped to the shrine of St. Mary. While he sleeps, she cures him miraculously.7 It is worth giving Garrison's list of wounds and disabilities incurred in the Crusades, because these would be similar to the medical conditions suffered by all fighting armies of the period, including the Mongol armies. He lists: blows to the skull, incised wounds from slashing, puncture wounds by spear or arrow, heat</page><page sequence="3">Kaszuba 61 stroke, dysentery, and typhus.8 Also, there would be fractured limbs, and sometimes, burns. Before examining the Secret History, and attempting to extrapolate military medical practices among the Mongols in the Thirteenth Century, I should mention one more aspect of battle wounds, true for medieval medicine, as well as for modern medicine. This is the effect of shock on the wounded victim. Squadron Leader D. Stafford-Clark, Senior Medical Officer of the Royal Air Force, in talking about air crash victims in World War H, defines shock as "a state of temporary mental and physical collapse induced by severe mental or physical disaster."9 The victims feel ill, cold and thirsty. Stafford-Clark cautions that "it is shock - or hemorrhage - that kills in the first three hours, rather than the particular lesion, no matter where or what the lesion is. Treat shock first and the patient will be given the best possible chance of being saved later on."10 The wounded patient in shock should be made to rest, kept warm and free from pain, and, if conscious, given fluids and reassurance.11 In examining the Secret History, we find a total of fourteen or fifteen direct references to the injury of men and the death of horses. There are four references to horses being struck by arrows; four, or possibly five, arrow wounds inflicted on men who recover;12 one sword wound; two fatal poisonings (one of these being Tolui's drinking of poisoned wine, in order to sacrifice his life for Ögödei); one fall from a horse, resulting in a fever; and two broken spines, both fatal, caused in wrestling matches.13 The general health and physical condition of the Mongols in the Thirteenth Century must have been magnificent. Their nomadic way of life, the climate, their hunting and sports, wrestling and horseracing, all contributed to a strong physical type of great stamina. Maiskii, during his travels among the Mongols in 1921, commented on their "strength and good health, which he attributed to the operation of natural selection: 'Under the hard conditions of Mongol life all the weak die in the cradle; only the stronger, sounder natives survive/ They were hardy, endured surgery well, and recovered quickly from wounds and other injuries."14 The medieval Mongol armies were capable of incredible physical feats. From the Secret History we learn that, during the wars in Cathay, Jebe and his army, resorting to a ruse, retreated from Tung-ching for six days' march, but then, changing horses, "rode back across the six days' march in one night, surprising the enemy outside their walls."15</page><page sequence="4">62 Mongolian Studies , 1996 The picture of Mongolian military medicine that emerges in the Secret History is extremely sketchy, but it is apparent that common sense hygienic rules for armies were followed. The nature of Mongol nomadic life had already effected, in its everyday organization, some of the principles that were advocated for armies assembled for wars in the West and in Islam. Rhazes, or ar-Razi (A.D. 860-932), one of the great clinicians of the Baghdad Caliphate, wrote recommending that: Camps should be pitched in summer on hills and high places, tents being directed towards the north wind, with plenty of air-space between tents. Animals should be kept as far from the tents as possible .... Sick cattle should be kept far from the camp, ....16 These were natural rules of the sort which the Mongol army, whether stationary or moving, followed as a matter of course. Juvaini called the Mongol forces "an army after the fashion of a peasantry," and "a peasantry in the guise of an army."17 It is not clear from the Secret History what, if any, provision was made for the formal assignment of a special unit of men or women to the task of removing the dead and wounded from the battlefield. The special an da pledges between individuals, and the bonds created by communal life in general, may have rendered unnecessary a formal ambulance corps of the sort found in the Byzantine army. In any case, the wounded and dead were surely removed from the field by friends or relatives, or by soldiers belonging to the same units as the victims. In the Secret History, Chinggis, wounded in the neck by an arrow, is cared for by Jelme. When Khuyildar is wounded, his warriors rally to protect him, and later carry him off the field. Similarly, when Senggüm is felled by an arrow to the face, the Kereyid army withdraws to guard him. Boroghul spends the night after a battle helping the wounded Ögödei, and next morning rides back with him to camp on a single horse.18 We can picture the Mongol army riding out to battle from its nearby camps. Riasanovsky quotes Fragment 19 of the Great Jasagh, in which Chinggis "ordered women accompanying the troops to do the work and perform the duties of the men, when the latter were absent fighting."19 After the battle, the wounded would be collected and returned to camp for treatment and rest. When Ögödei is brought in, Chinggis orders his wound to be cauterized. Ong Khan orders his son, Senggüm, to be carried back to the tents, as he must be tired and weak. In camp, the wounded were quite likely cared for by the women of their respective families, at least to the extent of being made comfortable. The Secret History does not mention bone fractures, but these must have been very common. According to Jagchid and Hyer,</page><page sequence="5">Kaszuba 63 the Mongols were extremely capable in the setting of broken bones.20 Probably the women, also, knew this skill as an aspect of practical medicine. The shaman, most likely, was called in later to attend to the more seriously wounded or those with complications, after practical emergency medicine, or "patching-up," had not worked. He or she would then attempt a supernatural intervention, seeking assistance from guardian or helping spirits.21 From the Secret History , it is apparent that arrow wounds were the most frequent injuries sustained by the Mongols in battle. Majno states that: A million years ago, as now, a wound implied three major medical problems: mechanical disruption, bleeding and infection. Nature is prepared to cope with all three; but man can help, even with simple means.22 When Chinggis is wounded in the neck by an arrow, Jelme sucks the blood from the wound from sunset to midnight, swallowing what blood he can, and spitting the rest on the ground. Chinggis is unconscious during this time. When he revives, he says he is thirsty. Jelme thereupon raids the nearby enemy camp looking for mare's milk, but is able to bring back only curd, which he mixes with water. Chinggis drinks, recovers his energy, and sits up. He then asks Jelme why he did not spit the blood further away.23 This incident affords us an opportunity to examine several aspects of the medieval Mongols' practical knowledge of wounds and healing. In an 1954 article, Francis Woodman Cleaves deals with the practice of healing arrow wounds by placing the victim inside the open belly of an ox or other draught animal.24 This remedy, however, is not mentioned in the Secret History. Harry Jackendoff, in a textual analysis of some aspects of the Secret History mentions Chinggis' neck wound, but does not deal with it in medical terms.25 Certainly, the high incidence of arrow wounds must have given the Mongols much experience in dealing with so common an injury. Garrison cites Cabanès on the treatment of such wounds in the West: Punctured wounds from spears and arrows occasioned but little bleeding, whence fatalities from internal hemorrhage were common. This was the rationale of cupping, leeching and wound-sucking in such cases, and wound-sucking was also associated with the idea of poisoning of wounds by weapons ....26 Jelme sucks the arrow wound in Chinggis' neck. When Ögödei is wounded in the neck, Boroghul sucks his wound also. In both cases, this treatment is carried</page><page sequence="6">64 Mongolian Studies, 1996 on for hours. I asked Dr. Aron Rappaport, a physician of my acquaintance, what could be the practical purpose of this practice. Dr. Rappaport's answer was that this natural treatment had the effect of preventing an air embolism, an explanation supported by research in the medical literature. In this last connection, I quote from several sources on modern clinical medicine: "Stab or gunshot wounds to the chest or neck can cause air embolism."27 "Air embolism may occur when any large vein is opened."28 "Acute management of venous air embolism is crucial to prevent large numbers of air bubbles from reaching the pulmonary arterioles where they can cause mechanical obstruction, vasoconstriction and capillary leakage."29 "Management" of the wound means closing off the communication between the outside air and the venous circulation, that is, occluding the wound. This is exactly what suction is able to do. Failure to do so leads to death from venous pulmonary embolism. Although the medieval Mongols could not have known the theory behind the practice of sucking wounds, it was an established treatment with them, probably based on sound observation of more frequent recovery when wounds were occluded in this way. Another reason to suck the wound would, of course, be to remove any poison or other debris in the injured tissue. But the prime effect of this form of treatment is to prevent death from air embolism. As we have seen, Chinggis is unconscious for a while. When he recovers, he asks for something to drink. This request, along with Jelme's previous treatment of the patient, shows that Chinggis has been suffering shock. After he drinks, Chinggis asks why Jelme did not spit the blood he was unable to swallow further away. Jelme replies that he was afraid to leave even for a second, because the wound was so very bad. Chinggis' question about the blood, far from being a mere piece of soldier's humour, seems to contain a supernatural element. Blood is a sacred fluid, at least among those of noble origins.30 Thus, we note that Ong Khan swore an oath of fidelity to Chinggis Khan by pricking his little finger and filling a small cup of birchbark with his blood, which he then sent to Chinggis.31 Jamugha alludes to this belief also in his request to be killed without having his blood spilled.32 According to shamanic doctrine among the Buriat, man has three souls. The lowest soul, also shared by the animals, is an invisible copy of the skeleton. The third or highest soul is called, on death, to the highest Tengeri, while the second soul is invoked in the curing of illness.33 The second soul has the capacity to leave the body and live in the world; it can transform into a flying thing, as a wasp or bee, and can undertake</page><page sequence="7">Kaszuba 65 activities of which its owner is unconscious. In its original state it is anthropomorphic, and its seat is in the organs of the trunk of a man: the heart, liver, lungs, also the larynx, and the blood as well.34 Shamanic medicine, as opposed to the practical or emergency medicine we have so far mentioned is the only other medical practice referred to in the Secret History. The influence of Chinese medicine and alchemy, and of Tibetan medicine, and their relation to Mongolian medical practice is too vast a topic to be dealt with here. It is worth noting, however, that Li Chih-Chang, journeying with his master, the Taoist Adept Ch'ang-Chun, when the latter was summoned to the court of Chinggis Khan, records that Ögödei had a Chinese physician, one Chang Ching- hsien, also called Lung-Kang.35 Shamanism among the Mongols is itself an enormous subject, and one well beyond the scope of this paper, except as it was applied to medical practice in the Secret History. There are several incidents involving shamans in the Secret History, but they appear in a clearly curative role only once, when Ögödei suffers a stroke and is in a coma. Shamans are called to cure him. They divine from the entrails of animals that the land and water of China are angry at the Khan. Propitiation is made by the return of captives, cattle, and food, but more entrail reading shows that this is insufficient appeasement. The shamans then pose the question of the sacrifice of a member of the Imperial family. As they do so, the Khan wakes from his coma and asks for water. This is seen as an omen that the suggested propitiation is the right one. Tolui offers up his life for that of Ögödei by drinking wine which is, presumably, poisoned. Ögödei thereupon recovers.36 It is essential to examine one last medical case history: the injury, fever, and eventual death of Chinggis Khan. During the Tang'ud War of A.D. 1226, while Chinggis Khan is hunting, his mount, called "Earth-Red Gray," bolts and throws him to the ground. The nature of the Khan's injuries is not clear. The Secret History states that he was in great pain, and that during the night he developed a fever which lasted for some days. He apparently recovered during the summer. In the following year, however, after successfully besieging the city of Dörmegei and later defeating the Tang'uds, Chinggis returned to Mongolia and died.37 The Secret History does not relate any further details of Chinggis Khan's medical or physical condition or death. Juvaini says "he was overcome by an incurable disease arising from the insalubrity of the climate."38 Boyle, the translator of Juvaini, mentions that one modern authority, Haenisch, has suggested that the fever may have been typhus.39 Typhus was certainly a common enough disease in</page><page sequence="8">66 Mongolian Studies , 1996 armies. While the Secret History mentions no epidemics, Juvaini, in speaking of the campaign against Jelal-ad-Din, says that: "On account of the insalubrity of the climate the greater part of the soldiers fell sick and the strength of the army declined."40 The Merck Manual defines typhus as: "A variety of illnesses manifested by sudden onset, a course of fever of one to several weeks, headache, malaise, prostation, peripheral vasculitis, and in most cases, a characteristic rash."41 The disease is caused by minute microorganisms called rickettsias and transmitted to man by the bite or attachment of lice, fleas, ticks, or mites. Typhus has an incubation period of from one to two weeks, and its symptoms include chills, headache, fever, and malaise. If Chinggis died of typhus, he must first have contracted it subsequent to his original fall from his horse and the fever that followed. Quite likely, the first illness permanently weakened his health, probably because of internal injuries, and he may later have caught typhus at Dörmegei and not been able to overcome it. References 1.
