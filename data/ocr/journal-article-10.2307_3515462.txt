GEORGE PEMBERTON, and TOM SAUNDERS The Ichnology Research Group, 1-26 E.S.B, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta T6G 2E3, Canada H. EDWARD CLIFTON CONOCO Inc., 600 North Dairy Ashford, Houston, TX 77252-3197 PALAIOS, 1999, V. 14, p. 352-374 Detailed analysis of modern and Pleistocene deposits at Willapa Bay, Washington concentrated on identifying ich- nological and sedimentological characteristics of five estu- arine subenvironments. These include: (1) intertidal flat de- posits, which are typically thoroughly bioturbated by a somewhat diminutive suite of various vertical and horizon- tal shafts and burrows that are locally cross-cut by robust crustacean dwellings; (2) unburrowed to rarely burrowed tidal creek point-bar deposits, which are sporadically bur- rowed by minute Gyrolithes, Skolithos, Cylindrichnus, Planolites, Palaeophycus, and rare bivalve equilibrichnia; (3) fluvially- through tidally-influenced main point-bar de- posits, which are sporadically bioturbated with vertical traces superimposed upon inclined heterolithic stratifica- tion; (4) well to thoroughly bioturbated bay deposits, bur- rowed by relatively robust forms of Ophiomorpha, Teichi- chnus, Skolithos and bivalve equilibrichnia; and (5) locally bioturbated channel-bar deposits, typically displaying ro- bust bivalve equilibrichnia, rare Ophiomorpha, and deep- penetrating Skolithos. Traces from both the modern and ancient deposits display a marked reduction in size and di- versity in the upper estuary. Ongoing research at Willapa Bay confirms the validity of the brackish-water model and provides data that potential- ly improve our understanding of these deposits. Our find- ings suggest that strong textural controls are overprinted by salinity stresses; commonly vertical deposit-feeding struc- tures, made by infauna that are mining and/or stoping or- ganic-rich laminae, are present; and there is a potential for the presence of large diameter crustacean burrows in brack- ish deposits. This research emphasizes ichnologic variabil- ity due to autocyclic changes and climatic variability, and urges caution when integrating ichnologic and sedimento- logic data into a genetic stratigraphic model. INTRODUCTION Research Rationale Ichnology has been employed widely to assist in identi- fying brackish-water deposits. Several notable core stud- ies underscore the utility of ichnology when applied to an- cient estuaries (e.g., MacEacher et al., 1992; Pemberton and Wightman, 1992). However, there is a marked paucity of outcrop and actualistic studies in the recent literature. Copyright c 1999, SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology) This is particularly unfortunate as the recognition of lat- eral variation and the identification of key subenviron- ments provide the tools needed for resolving complex geo- metric problems, predicting compartmentalization of po- tential reservoirs, and identifying pool-edge indicators in the subsurface. Outcrop-based studies and an under- standing of modern estuarine processes may provide some of the solutions to these complex geological puzzles. Pleistocene outcrops at Willapa Bay present a unique opportunity to integrate ichnologic data into a well-docu- mented sedimentologic and stratigraphic framework (Clif- ton and Phillips, 1980; Clifton, 1982; Anima et al., 1989), thereby allowing a focus on ichnologic variation in brack- ish-water deposits. The modern bay provides an excellent analog for comparison to the ancient deposits and reveals complexities inherent to incised valley fills (IVF). These complexities present problems with tractable solutions that can be applied to the rock record. This paper focuses on the ichnologic characteristics of five subenvironments: (1) intertidal flats; (2) intertidal point bars; (3) fluvially- through tidally-influenced main point-bar deposits; (4) subtidal, laterally-accreted mid- channel tidal bars, and; (5) quiescent central bay deposits. Both modem and Pleistocene examples are utilized, lend- ing insight into the taphonomy of traces in IVF. Studies at Willapa Bay were also designed to test whether archetyp- al ichnofacies could be consistently applied to ancient es- tuaries and bays. The aim of this research is to establish whether predictable exceptions to the ichnological brack- ish-water model are present in moder bays and how they might enhance the interpretation of the rock record. The Brackish-water Model In general, salinity-stressed trace fossil suites are dis- cerned by the identification of a few ichnological charac- ters (Pemberton and Wightman, 1992). The initially ob- served patterns (Pemberton et al., 1982) include: a low di- versity of trace forms and suites dominated by a single ichnogenus; overall diminutive traces; simple marine forms, constructed by trophic generalists; vertical and hor- izontal traces common to the Skolithos- and Cruziana-ich- nofacies; and locally prolific trace densities. These criteria are outlined in Pemberton et al. (1982) and were the result of extensive comparative modern-ancient studies through- out the 1970's. The origin of these studies can be traced back to the 0883-1351/99/0014-352/$3.00 352 RESEARCH REPORTS</page><page sequence="2">MODERN AND PLEISTOCENE BRACKISH-WATER DEPOSITS 353 1950's and the early developmental stages of modern ich- nology. Researchers including Schafer, Seilacher, Re- ineck, Dorjes, and Hertweck developed a framework for ichnological research that was rooted in modern observa- tions (actuopaleontology). Although the original research primarily focused on defining burrow architecture and un- derstanding taphonomic processes, substrate texture was soon recognized as a controlling factor in trace distribu- tion. This recognition translated into the archetypal (sub- strate-controlled) Seilacherian ichnofacies (Seilacher, 1967). Although much of the North Sea data were collect- ed in brackish environments, a set of criteria to identify brackish deposits had yet to be developed. Seilacher (1963) noted that "the activities controlling trace morphology are related to the sedimentary facies, however, they are inde- pendent of salinity." Seilacher also stated that the identi- fication of a species, whose salinity range might be estab- lished, would provide the most direct solution towards the identification of estuarine strata. Unfortunately, a (bur- rowing) taxon that might provide such an ichnological so- lution has not been put forward. Early work in the North Sea was supplemented with data gathered from estuaries along the Georgia coast in the early 1970's (Howard and Frey, 1973,1975; Dorjes and Howard, 1975). Though the significance of estuarine IVF's in the rock record essentially was unrealized at that time, the work of Howard and Frey (1973) provided a valuable database from which the brackish-water model evolved. A number of physico-chemical parameters were documented in this earlier work (Howard and Frey, 1973). They includ- ed salinity, oxygen content of the water column, substrate textural relationships, temperature, and pH. Of these fac- tors, salinity and texture were consistently associated with particular ichnocoenoses, the physical character of which could be compared to the rock record. Although this paper focuses on the ichnological signa- ture of salinity stress, it is recognized that other factors in- fluenced the trace fossil assemblage as well. Examples of other stresses include low oxygen contents in the water column, turbidity, and high sedimentation rates. Setting Willapa Bay, located in the southwest corner of Wash- ington (Fig. 1), is separated from the Pacific Ocean by the North Beach Peninsula, a 27-km-long spit derived from sand transported from the mouth of the Columbia River. Five river systems discharge into Willapa Bay, from the south, east, and north margins, complicating facies distri- bution within the estuary. The bay is sheltered from oce- anic waves by the North Beach Peninsula and Willapa Bar, a set of shoals at the bay mouth. Also, Willapa Bay is a mesotidal estuary with a tidal range of 2 to 3 m. Tremen- dous water exchange occurs in the bay, and the tidal prism, which exceeds 700,000 m3, comprises about 45% of the bay's total volume (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1975). This volume is by no means constant. The maxi- mum exchange occurs during spring tides, whereas neap tides proffer a much smaller tidal prism. The bay becomes somewhat 'stagnant' with the neap tides, affecting the food-resource, oxygenation, and salinity levels on a monthly and yearly basis (L. Bennet, pers. comm., 1997). FIGURE 1-Location map of Willapa Bay, Washington. The right frame details Goose Point and the Palix River, an area of focused modern and ancient ichnological study. Longer-term climatic patterns, such as El Nino, have a similar effect. Sediment accumulations at Willapa Bay are siliciclastic. The lower estuary is dominated by sandy deposits, gener- ally upper fine- to medium-grained, and the upper estuary is characteristically muddy (80% finer than 6 phi). An analysis of the heavy mineral fraction of the modern and Pleistocene deposits was completed by Luepke and Clifton (1983). They found that sediment has been transported into the bay from both fluvial and tidal processes. Pleisto- cene deposits at the north end of the bay may have origi- nally been derived from glacial outwash (Luepke and Clif- ton, 1983). Pleistocene terraces are exposed along the northern, eastern, and southern margins of the bay. The deposits have been informally separated into an "older" and a "younger" terrace set (Clifton and Phillips, 1980). Younger Pleistocene deposits were deposited between 100,000 and 200,000 years before present (Kvenvolden et al., 1979); the older strata have not been reliably dated. The younger Pleistocene strata have been divided into 5 units (I through V; Fig. 2). Unit I is primarily a muddy ac- cumulation that has been interpreted to indicate deposi- tion in intertidal and uppermost subtidal environments (Clifton et al., 1989). Both intertidal flat and intertidal creek point-bar deposits have been identified in Unit I. Unit II, in contrast, is comprised mostly of sand. Clifton et al. (1989) compared this to the central channel of the mod- ern bay. Unit III is typically muddy and contains abun- dant organic detritus. Locally cross-cutting Units I and II, Unit III has been interpreted as being primarily alluvial and is indicative of a basinwards shift of facies (Clifton et al., 1989).

An even older, third terrace set is present at the bay (not shown on schematic), the stratigraphy of which is poorly understood. Units I through V indicate the stratigraphic divisions as delineated by Clifton and Phillips (1980). These units are interpreted to represent chronostratigraphic divisions, although they are identified on the basis of lithologic characteristics (lithostratigraphic). Unit I is primarily mud- dy. Unit II erosionally overlies Unit I and is comprised primarily of sand. Unit III is represented by a woody and muddy channel fill; it truncates Units I and II. Unit IV locally truncates Units I, II, and II. It represents a primarily sandy accumulation of bay deposits. Unit V locally truncates Units I through IV, and is characteristically muddy. Modified from Clifton et al., 1989. Pleistocene deposits is Unit IV. It outcrops almost contin- uously from Goose Point to Pickernell Creek (Fig. 1), ex- cept where it is truncated by Unit V. Unit IV is lithologi- cally variable, consisting of two facies types: unstratified fossiliferous muds and stratified mud and/or sand (Clifton et al., 1989). Locally, unstratified sand and fossiliferous sand are observed, particularly in the vicinity of John- stone Beach. The ubiquity of the oyster Ostrea lurida in Unit IV reflects that it was deposited subtidally and, based on further sedimentologic and stratigraphic evi- dence, was probably deposited partly in the trough of a broad bay and partly in tidal channels (Clifton et al., 1989). Unit V is a channelized deposit typically containing gravelly beds and unstratified and stratified mud. Rhyth- mic sedimentation patterns suggest tidal influence; an ab- sence of burrowing, however, reflects deposition accompa- nied by extreme salinity stress. Unit V is primarily fluvial (Clifton et al., 1989). Although the complex stratigraphy of the older Pleisto- cene terraces has yet to be deciphered, many examples of subtidal through supratidal deposits have been identified in these strata (Clifton et al., 1989). Both the younger and older terraces, then, provide the database with which dis- crete subenvironments can be characterized. These data are bolstered by research carried out in the moder bay. Methods Outcrop data were gathered through detailed logging of 27 sections throughout the Pleistocene deposits. Samples of Pleistocene outcrop were removed and slabbed for de- tailed analysis. Slabs were polished by rubbing them against a piece of flat, expanded-metal grating while im- mersed in water, and subsequently radiographed using a Hewlitt Packard cabinet X-ray system (Faxitron series). The ichnologic data, particularly the radiographic plates, were obtained in "core-sized" format, to aid in the subsur- face identification of the different depositional environ- ments. Modern deposits were studied using a variety of meth- ods, including trenching, shallow coring, box coring, resin casting, SCUBA, and radiographic analysis. Resin casts were produced with two media; polyester resin for more robust burrows (&gt; 5 mm diameter) and polyurethane cast- ing resin (Castmaster 2000) for diminutive burrows (gen- erally &lt; 5 mm diameter). The comparatively low viscosity of polyurethane resin allowed penetration of burrows less than a millimeter in diameter. In the absence of diagenetic processes that emphasize a trace's architecture, burrow architectures in modern and Pleistocene deposits have been interpreted as indicative of common ichnofossil morphologies. For example, vertical traces are Skolithos-like, and large diameter crustacean burrows with thickened pellet-lined walls are Ophiomor- pha-like. Although largely interpretive, this facilitates communication of this data in a more standard ichnologi- cal framework. MODERN AND ANCIENT DEPOSITS AT WILLAPA BAY, WASHINGTON Common Tracemakers at Willapa Bay A number of organisms leave distinctive traces in the sediments of Willapa Bay. Figure 3 details some of the most common burrowers, many of which display a strong preference for muddy or sandy substrates, although much overlap is evident in substrate selection (Fig. 3). The bur- row architectures are varied and many are potentially analogous to common trace fossils. The most common trac- es include Skolithos- and Gyrolithes-like burrows, which are made by a number of burrowers including Saccoglos- sus (an entrepneust), maldanid polychaetes, Heteromastus (a capitellid polychaete), and more rarely Nereis (Fig. 3). Cylindrichnus-like burrows also are constructed by mal- danid worms, whereas terebellid polychaetes commonly construct a Rosselia-like structure at the ends of their parchment-lined u-shaped burrows. This latter observa- tion confirms Masakazu's (1995) speculation that terebel- lids might construct such structures. Planolites and Pa- laeophycus structures typically represent the work of the polychaetes Nereis or Nephtys (Fig. 3); sections of Saccog- lossus or Heteromastus burrows may invoke a similar in- terpretation. Decapod crustaceans, such as Upogebia pug- ettensis and Callianassa californiensis, commonly con- struct Thalassinoides- or Ophiomorpha-like burrows (Fig. 3). Diplocraterion and Arenicolites structures are utilized by the spionid worm, Polydora, and the amphipod Coro- phium. Figure 3 indicates which burrows are transient, or oc- cupied for a short time, and which are used by the organ- ism for much of its life cycle. More transient burrows are relocated often and, although the trace itself may have lower preservation potential, their producers potentially bioturbate the substrate to a higher degree. The illustra- tion therefore relates taphonomic considerations to the burrowing assemblage. 354 GINGRAS ET AL.</page><page sequence="4">MODERN AND PLEISTOCENE BRACKISH-WATER DEPOSITS mud u O. o 41 a 0 0 N a a N Ft 0 0 ft ed a 12 a N r.j F; (U .1.

Detailed are general trace configurations and empirical esti- mates of the substrate texture they inhabit. Classification of ambient versus opportunistic assemblages is based on observations at Willapa Bay and may vary in other locations. The distinction between early and late ambient assemblages alludes to the order in which organisms move into an unexploited substrate. The semi-permanent and ephem- eral axis alludes to taphonomic characteristics, such as the presence of a burrow lining and depth in the substrate. Intertidal Flat Deposits Modern Tidal Flats Modem intertidal flat deposits are typically character- ized by distinctive ichnocoenoses. Upogebia-, Callianassa-, terrebellid-, Saccoglossus-, maldanid-, and bivalve-domi- nated communities are common. Inevitably, a host of worms and bivalves, notably Heteromastus, Nereis, Coro- phium, Nephtys, and Macoma sp., are also present in am- bient assemblages. A terebellid-dominated assemblage is idealized in Figure 4, indicating relative distributions and generalized depths of penetration in these deposits.

The burrowers shown represent the dominant tracemakers present in an ambient intertidal mudflat at the bay. Terebellid poly- chaetes are shown. However, maldanid polychaetes, mud shrimp, or various bivalves may occupy their niche. The depth to the dashed line is 15-25 cm. that contain Macaronichnus (Clifton and Thompson, 1978). In muddy deposits, permanent and semipermanent burrows are stained orange by a thin oxide coating. Bur- rows observed in sandflats with a shallow redox disconti- nuity are similarly discolored. Scanning electron micro- scopic analysis indicates that Fe, Mg, and Mn are enriched in this zone, and that the degree of enrichment is variable. Oxide burrow halos are not observed in unconsolidated sediments that have passed into the historical record, and no analysis has been carried out to determine whether the metal enrichment associated with the lebensspurren per- sists below zones of active colonization. Biogenic reworking on the intertidal flat is extensive. Radiographs of cores retrieved from both sandy and mud- dy intertidal flat deposits show that, as the sediment pass- es into the historic record, primary sedimentary struc- tures are all but obliterated (Fig. 5). In muddier deposits, a vestigial lamination may be preserved (Fig. 6). Below sediment depths of 10 to 20 cm, sandflat deposits are char- acterized by the absence of physical sedimentary struc- tures. An exception to this is the presence of lamination produced by rapidly aggraded run-off channels (Fig. 7A). Resulting ichnofabrics are typically dominated by crusta- cean burrows, or appear massive (ichnofabric index, i.i. 6) due to extensive biogenic reworking. Physical sedimentary structures, though rarely pre- served, generally include current- and wave-generated ripple lamination, starved ripple lamination (particularly in muddy accumulations), and low-angle to horizontal pla- nar lamination. Bedding is horizontal and characteristi- cally thin (cm scale). Organic detritus comprised of terres- trial plant debris, and marine kelp and algae is dissemi- nated throughout muddy deposits; sandflats have very lit- tle macroscopic organic material preserved into the historic records (microscopic organic material present in- terstitially, or adhering to the sand grains was not as- sessed). Although striking lateral variability exists between the upper, middle, and lower intertidal zones, they are com- plex and not easily summarized.

Only vestigial lamination, represented by changes in grain size preserved in the bioturbate tex- ture, is present. Trace fossils characteristic of these deposits are Cy- lindrichnus (Cy), small Planolites (PI), Palaeophycus (Pa), Rhizocor- allium (Rh), and a stoping structure. The overall fabric is the result of abundant Planolites, Gyrolithes, Palaeophycus, and possibly Trichi- chnus almost completely reworking the sediment. highest in the lower intertidal zone, which is consistently dominated by burrowing shrimp, most commonly Calli- anassa or Upogebia. Other burrowers include thread- worms, Nereis, Nephtys, and various bivalves, notably Mya, Macoma, and Crypatoma. Subtidal organisms, such as Dungeness and sturgeon, venture into this zone during the high tide. Their search for food is documented by local- ly abundant feeding pits, which give the lower intertidal a pitted appearance. Traces generated by shrimp commonly extend 60 cm into the substrate and constitute the domi- nant component of the observed ichnocoenose. The middle intertidal zone is distinguished by medium- to large-sized burrowing bivalves, including Macoma bal- thica and Tresus nuttalli. Burrowing worms such as Nere- is, Nephtys, Saccoglossus, Heteromastus, lugworms (par- ticularly in sand-dominated flats), and terebellid poly- chaetes are typically present, generating an array of trace forms. Grazing fauna, such as the barrel snail (Rictatus punctocaelatus), are more common, and burrowing shrimp are absent to common (up to 110 individuals / M2) and un- evenly distributed in this zone. Trace assemblages in the upper intertidal zone exhibit a lower trace diversity and include notably smaller forms. An exception to this is the presence of raccoon feeding pits. These are holes (15 cm diameter) dug into the substrate in their quest for the small, but abundant bivalves present. Pleistocene Tidal Flat Deposits Ancient intertidal flat deposits at Willapa Bay are com- paratively scarce. Where complete sedimentary succes- sions are observed, they cap subtidal units, such as estua- rine point-bar or channel bar deposits. As with the modern, Pleistocene intertidal flats are re- worked extensively and their bedding is massive to crude- ly defined by continuous horizons of silt- and sand-filled burrows (Fig. 6). Primary sedimentary structures are rarely preserved, but may include planar bedding, graded laminae, ripple and starved ripple lamination. Organic de- tritus is locally abundant, including wood fragments and transported rhizomes. Burrows are typically small (1 to 4 mm in diameter) and biogenic disruption is pervasive. Dis- crete burrows are locally discernible and are commonly limited to the ichnogenera Skolithos, Arenicolites, Gyroli- thes, Cylindrichnus, Planolites, and Palaeophycus. In out- crop, Skolithos, Gyrolithes, Planolites, and Palaeophycus are evenly distributed; Arenicolites and Cylindrichnus are sporadically distributed, generally in closely spaced pack- ages of 2 or more trace fossils along bedding surfaces. Crustacean burrows are present sporadically, attaining notable abundance (&gt; 80/m2). These traces are comprised of relatively large (&gt; 1 cm in diameter) Thalassinoides. Crab burrows also are abundant locally, typically infilled with a crudely laminated, passive infill. Where present, the crustacean burrows overprint the background biotur- bate texture and typically represent the deepest tier of mudflat burrows. Ancient sandflat deposits are most common in the older Pleistocene strata at Willapa Bay. Two examples include the Pleistocene exposure adjacent to the Bruce Port histor- ical marker on Highway 101 and the outcroppings near Pickerell Creek (Fig. 1). At these locations, massive to crudely bedded sand is intercalated with rare mm-scale mud beds. The deposit is intensely cross cut by silt- and sand-filled run-off channels (Fig. 7). Bioturbation consists primarily of medium- to large-sized bivalve traces (equili- brichnia and Siphonichnus), medium-sized Ophiomorpha and Thalassinoides, passively-infilled crab domiciles, and diminutive Planolites and Skolithos. As a whole, smaller trace fossils are absent, probably due to extensive rework- ing of the deposit by larger burrowers and preservational bias in coarser-grained clastic deposits. In summary, both moder and ancient mudflat deposits are characterized by relatively small burrows and high de- grees of bioturbation. The physical sedimentary character is commonly destroyed, although silt- and sand-filled bur- rows are concentrated along planar horizons and may be indicative of original bedding surfaces. Pleistocene sand- flat deposits are comparatively rare, and are dominated by somewhat larger traces, notably those made by bivalves and crustaceans. This compares favorably with the mod- em sandflat, which, except in the upper intertidal zone, is almost completely colonized by Callianassa sp. and, local- ly, relatively robust bivalves. As with the modern, Pleisto- cene sandflats exhibit poor preservation of smaller traces. Interpretation of Tidal Flat Deposits Burrowing intensity in intertidal flat environments lends a distinctive aspect to their associated deposits. Strongly burrowed fabrics (i.i. 5 or 6) are the product of low sedimentation rates and high rates of biogenic rework- ing on the intertidal flats. Lead-shot tracer experiments conducted over one year indicate that low sediment-aggra- MODERN AND PLEISTOCENE BRACKISH-WATER DEPOSITS 357</page><page sequence="7">'7V 13 SVHONIO 89c r- -r?? c ''13f-- r ,, 41 2 ii - ? i- ;C' -1?i' ?I ??. rC 1 t..

(A) Intertidal flats, cutbanks, and point bars near the Bone River at Willapa Bay. Intertidal flat bedding (i.f.) and point-bar bedding (p.b.) are visible in the cutbank. Progradation of the intertidal flat over the point bar allows reworking of the upper portion of the point-bar deposit. (B) X-ray image of modern intertidal point bar, from about the middle of the point bar. The degree of reworking may be high, but vestigial lamination is more apparent than in intertidal flat deposits. The burrows are almost exclusively comprised of small Planolites, Palaeophycus (Pa), Skolithos (Sk), and Gyrolithes (Gy?). No large burrows are present. dation rates (&lt; 1 cm/year) are characteristic of the tidal flats. This precludes the possibility that the weakly lami- nated to burrowed (locally massive-appearing) bedding re- sults from neap/spring tidal cycles; the fabric most likely results from seasonal variations in rates of bioturbation and is akin to the seasonal bundles noted by Dalrymple et al. (1991) at the Bay of Fundy. Thorough bioturbation in sandy deposits suggests that the rate of biogenic rework- ing (by deposit feeders) in sandy deposits is higher than in muddy substrates (Swinbanks and Luternauer, 1987). To- tal organic carbon contents are significantly higher in muddy (6.7 to 7.8%) compared to sandy intertidal flats (1.8 to 3.2%). This comparatively limited resource in sandy de- posits requires that greater amounts of substrate must be processed more rapidly by the resident infauna. Calli- anassa, for example, is an aggressive deposit feeder pre- sent in the sand flats at Willapa Bay. Empirical observa- tions on modem tidal flats, and aquarium studies conduct- ed at Willapa Bay clearly indicate that these shrimp chur great quantities of sand at depths of 10 to 40 cm as they sieve sand grains through their mouth parts. Overall, there is a general trend towards more robust burrows in the lower intertidal flat. This pattern is direct- ly controlled by the duration of inundation, which governs the amount of oxygen available to burrowing organisms. Infauna inhabiting the middle and upper intertidal zones are subject to additional stresses, such as salinity stress from discharging groundwater and rainfall, dessication, and predation (Cadee, 1998). The ichnologic contrasts be- tween the upper, middle, and lower intertidal zones are gradational, but distinct enough that they may be utilized as facies edge-indicators. Modem and Pleistocene deposits are remarkably simi- lar in many respects. Both are strongly bioturbated and exhibit a paucity of physical sedimentary structures. Planolites, Palaeophycus, Arenicolites, and Skolithos in an- cient deposits form ichnofabrics similar to fabrics from the modem (Figs. 5B, C, and 6). Certain trace fossils, such as Ophiomorpha, Thalassinoides, and Cylindrichnus, are morphologically similar to burrows made by the modern tracemakers, Upogebia, Callianassa, and maldanid poly- chaetes. No example of Rosselia has yet been documented FIGURE 7-Various sandflat perspectives. (A) Pleistocene sandflat deposit intercalated with laminated, lens-shaped, silty runoff channels. Large bivalve traces are present, and locally, the animal's siphonate passage is visible. Adjustments to sediment influx are visible below the bivalves indicated by the dashed black rectangle. A magnification of this zone is inset lower left. The bivalves appear to have ascended in pulses, likely in relation to variations in sediment-accumulation rates. The persistence of silty substrate increases upwards, possibly due to progradation of the intertidal flat. (B) Radiograph of ripple cross-laminated sand with abundant Paraonis spirals (black arrows). The spirals are connected to the surface with thin vertical shafts, which are visible near the top of the image. Paraonis and other threadworms disrupt sands and are capable of generating a form of diffuse, cryptic bioturbation. (C) Ophiomorpha eroding out of an intertidal cutbank. These burrows are the result of sand shrimp (Callianassa californiensis) colonizing the sand flat. Their capacity for overturning the substrate is evidenced by the undulatory appearance of the sandflat. Sand ejected from the burrow is reworked into small hummocks and ripples during the high tide. A subaqueous dune is visible in the background. Shrimp burrows are visible on these migrating dune forms as well.

Stratal thickness in the Pleistocene is variable, but generally 1-to-2.5-m-thick packages are preserved. The thickness of modern deposits ranges from a few centimeters, above wave-ravined Pleis- tocene firmground, to more than 2.6 m. Rare physical sedimentary structures preserved in both modern and Pleistocene intertidal flat deposits are consis- tent with processes observed to operate in the area. Ripple and starved ripple lamination result from low- to moder- ate-energy tidal currents and wind-generated wave ac- tion. Winter storm tides are possibly represented by thick- er laminae sets. Abundant organic material has been transported from both terrestrial and marine sources. Transportation agents include tide- and wind-generated currents. Terrestrial organic material is delivered to the bay by fluvial sources (Cadee, 1998). Marine kelp and al- gae are derived from the bay (growing in situ) and come into the bay via the bay inlet (Cadee, 1998). Rare preservation of intertidal flat deposits may be due to their tendency to be removed by the rapid meandering of intertidal creeks (Clifton and Phillips, 1980), or truncat- ed by channel or ravinement processes due to allocyclic changes in base level. In the moder, intertidal deposits clearly pass into the historic record. This is particularly true in muddy sub- strates in which meander rates are relatively slow (Fig. 8). Conversely, in somewhat sandy flats, robust intertidal communities are truncated by rapid intertidal creek mi- gration, biasing the intertidal record towards the deepest- tier traces. The rapid meandering of tidal creeks in sandy substrates is, however, countered by high rates ofbiogenic reworking. Sandy intertidal flat deposits reflect this bal- ance, preserving completely bioturbated horizons interca- lated with run-off channels that appear to have rapidly ag- graded and, thus, were spared biogenic eradication (Fig. 7A). Ravinement due to changes in base level may also ex- plain the overall paucity of preserved intertidal flats in the Pleistocene deposits. In subducting tectonic regimes, ac- commodation space is gradually reduced due to plate flex- ure, followed by sudden increases (potentially meter- scale) of accommodation space during megathrust earth- quakes (Atwater, 1987; Atwater and Yamaguchi, 1991). Along the Washington coast, tectonic adjustments due to plate flexure have been demonstrated to occur every 300 to 700 years throughout the Holocene (Atwater, 1987; At- water and Yamaguchi, 1991); no Pleistocene data is avail- able. Gradual relative sea-level rise followed by a sudden lowering of relative sea level should have the following ef- fects on intertidal flat deposits: the intertidal and supra- tidal facies prograde, forming a thin, shallowly dipping bed; this bed is increasingly susceptible to erosion as pro- gradation continues; and the thin deposit is easily eroded by first- and second-order tidal channels following sudden relative sea-level rise. All of these factors markedly reduce the overall preservability of intertidal deposits. Point-bar Deposits Modern Tidal Creek Point-bar Deposits Modern intertidal flats are commonly truncated by com- plex networks of meandering intertidal creeks, particular- FIGURE 9-Schematic detail of an intertidal point-bar assemblage (substrate is muddy sand to sandy mud) at Willapa Bay. The burrow- ers shown represent the dominant tracemakers present in an intertidal point bar at the bay. The lower, more stressed portion of the point bar has the highest preservation potential (below the dashed line). A leg- end for the biogenic structures is present in Figure 3. ly in substrates with notable silt or mud content. Associ- ated with these channels are numerous point-bar deposits (Fig. 8A). Depending on the texture of the intertidal flat sediment, these point bars may have a high preservation potential. Dominantly muddy flats inhibit the rate of channel meandering, limiting the distribution of point bars, whereas sandy substrates are rapidly reworked by the sand-flat biota. Intermediate substrates therefore proffer the greatest likelihood of passing intertidal point- bar deposits into the geologic record. Modern intertidal point bars at Willapa Bay typically are burrowed by an extremely low-diversity assemblage of diminutive infauna (Fig. 8B). Threadworms, such as the capitellid polychaete Heteromastus, are among the most common burrowers. Heteromastus burrows consist of ver- tical shafts 10 to 30 cm deep, with numerous horizontal to subhorizontal branches. The terminus of the burrows gen- erally ends in a Gyrolithes-like coil, the axis of which is ori- ented randomly. Other tracemakers include Nereis, the small amphipod Corophium, and juvenile bivalves. The re- sulting trace suite is a low-diversity assemblage composed of diminutive vertical and horizontal burrows. This as- semblage grades into the intertidal flat assemblage over 2 m on smaller point bars (fourth-order channels) and up to 8 m on larger point bars (first- or second-order channels). Figure 9 illustrates the gradational relationship between the intertidal point-bar and tidal flat ichnocoenoses. The assemblage observed in modern intertidal point bars is superimposed on inclined, relatively well-laminat- ed sediment indicative of cyclic deposition. The degree of bioturbation may be such that laminae are completely dis- rupted by small traces (Fig. 10), although planar lamina- tion, graded bedding, and ripple lamination are observed locally. Bedding is primarily defined by muddy and silty to fine-grained sand laminae. The deposit is rich in organic detritus (TOC between 5 and 8%; 4 samples measured) and, locally, woody debris. Lower contacts in these depos- its are always sharp to erosional, and typically a 5-to-10- cm-thick shelly lag has accumulated immediately above the contact.

Small Skolithos (Sk), Arenicolites (Ar), Planolites (PI), and Palaeophycus (Pa), are present in moderate to high abundance. Some of the mottling is likely due to the presence of small, deformed Gyrolithes, although none are clearly discernible on this illustration. Original bedding is destroyed by these small burrows. This example may come from high- er on the point bar than the modern example detailed in 8B. monly burrowed with a diminutive, low-diversity suite of trace fossils. Common lebensspurren observed include Skolithos, Diplocraterion, Palaeophycus, Planolites, and Gyrolithes. Rarely, passively-infilled crustacean burrows, similar to those made by Hemigrapsus in modem deposits, are present. Deformed Gyrolithes appear to cross cut the other trace fossils and represent the deepest tier of bur- rowing, possibly near the basal terminus of longer Skoli- thos-like burrows. Ancient intertidal point bars can be traced approximately 5 to 15 m across the outcrop. How- ever, these exposures provide sections oblique to the chan- nel axis, and rarely exceed one meter in thickness. There is lateral variation, with small Gyrolithes and Skolithos present near the toe of the point bar, and larger trace forms (Planolites, Palaeophycus, and Skolithos) more abundant in the upper portions (Fig. 10). The Pleistocene sedimentary structures are comparable to those described herein from the modern tidal creek point bars, except that the overall degree ofbioturbation is higher in the Pleistocene strata (Fig. 10). Pebbles and wood debris overlie the sharp lower contact of these depos- its; disarticulated bivalve shells are present locally, but not with the ubiquity of analogous modern environments. Pleistocene intertidal point-bar deposits are, therefore, characterized by low-diversity, diminutive trace fossil suites. The degree of bioturbation is low to high (increas- ing upwards), and primary sedimentary structures are preserved locally. Modern intertidal point bars are analo- gous in every respect, except that the overall degree ofbio- turbation in the modern is somewhat lower and a basal shell lag is not typically present in the Pleistocene depos- its. Modern Fluvially- and Tidally-Influenced Main Channel Point-bar Deposits The main channel point-bar depositional environment is common at Willapa Bay. Due to their association with fluvial tributaries, they exhibit notable ichnological, chemical (most notably salinity), and textural variability. As the major supply of coarser clastic detritus comes into the bay through its inlet, sandy deposits tend to be situat- ed near the lower reaches of the estuary. The upper reach- es, on the other hand, are typically characterized by silt and mud. In the upper estuary, salinity fluctuations and low background salinities contribute to extreme salinity stress (Fig. 11). Figure 11 outlines the different burrowing taxa (diversity) and quantifies dimunition of trace forms, as the point bars are traversed in an up-estuary direction. In the lower reaches of the Palix River (stations 1 and 2), 12 burrowing taxa are commonly observed. Typical bur- row diameters range between 3 to 15 mm. At station 4, only 7 taxa are noted, with average burrow diameters fall- ing between 1 and 3 mm. Station 5 is characterized by 5 common burrowers, all of which produce burrows less than 2 mm in diameter. Muddy point bars typically exhibit low-diversity assem- blages that are comprised primarily of diminutive traces. Trace makers include Heteromastus, Corophium, Nereis, juvenile Mya, and Hemigrapsus. The resulting ichnoco- enosis is strongly tiered and consists of shallow Arenicoli- tes, moderate-depth (- 1-10 cm) siphonate passages, and deep-penetrating (up to 28 cm) Skolithos and Gyrolithes (Fig. 12). Radiographs of modern deposits indicate that the deepest-tier burrows overprint shallow burrows and are preferentially passed into the historic record (Fig. 13). Physical sedimentary structures include planar lami- nation, graded bedding, and starved ripple lamination (Fig. 13). Bedding is primarily defined by mud and silt laminae, although fine-grained sand laminae are present locally. The deposit is rich in organic detritus, with TOC measurements falling between 6 and 9%; wood clasts are abundant throughout the point-bar deposit. In situ, artic- ulated bivalve shells and imbricated, disarticulated valves along bedding planes are rarely present. The lower contact is erosional and, commonly, a woody, shelly lag has accu- mulated in the channel adjacent to the point bar. Sand to muddy sand deposits exhibit a more diverse as- semblage of tracemakers (Fig. 13).

Population densities are variable (0 to 247 burrow openings/m2, the mode in burrowed zones is 80 openings/m2), although generally the highest densities are present in the upper subtidal zone. Nereis, Nephtys, and various threadworms are present in moderate abundance (no population count), typically extending from the middle intertidal facies down into the subtidal channel facies. Tube-dwelling maldanids (a polychaete worm) are present in subtidal zones, and are most abundant (&gt; 500 individ- uals/m2) where a significant component of interstitial mud is present (Fig. 13). Locally, robust Mya and Macoma sp. are present; however, their distribution is patchy. Juve- nile bivalves are more common, with population densities ranging from absent to almost 600 individuals/m2 (extrap- olated from 25 cm2). The consequent trace assemblage is variable and shows distinct zonation down to the channel thalweg (Fig. 14). Traces include Ophiomorpha-, Skoli- thos-, Gyrolithes-, Monocraterion-, Siphonichnus-, Rosse- lia-, Planolites-, and Palaeophycus-like burrows (Figs. 14, 15). Some of the traces are relatively large (4-12 mm di- ameter), particularly the maldanid and terebellid tubes, and Callianassa burrows. Pleistocene Fluvially- and Tidally-Influenced Main Channel Point-bar Deposits Pleistocene subtidal point-bar deposits contain variable trace assemblages that appear to be, at least in part, tex- turally controlled. Dominantly muddy or silty accumula- tions are characterized by low-diversity suites of small trace fossils. Most commonly, deformed Gyrolithes, Skoli- thos, Planolites, Palaeophycus, and Arenicolites comprise the trace fossil assemblage. Rare Ophiomorpha and Thal- assinoides are present locally. Large, passively-infilled burrows, interpreted to represent the dwelling structures of robust crustaceans (such as crabs) and are therefore comparable to Psilonichnus, are rare to locally moderate, and are typically observed along the lower portions of the point-bar deposit. Overall, the degree of bioturbation is low, and traces are sporadically distributed. Physical sed- imentary structures include planar lamination, graded bedding, starved current-ripple lamination, and local cur- rent scours. Organic detritus is abundant, particularly woody debris. Bivalve casts are present locally and some bedding-plane exposures show excellently preserved Lock- eia (Fig. 15A). Sandy subtidal point bars, such as those present in old- er Pleistocene outcrops near the Bone River (Fig. 15B), contain a more diverse array of lebensspurren. The suite is similar to the assemblage in muddy subtidal point bars, with the addition of moderately abundant Cylindrichnus and Monocraterion. These traces tend to occur in clusters of 3 to 5 shafts. Also, Ophiomorpha and Thalassinoides are most commonly observed in the sandier units. Passively- infilled, unlined burrows (attributed to a Hemigrapsus- like trace maker) are locally common. Physical sedimen- tary structures include abundant flaser, wavy, and lentic- ular bedding. Bedding is defined by abrupt changes in grain size (silt to fine- or medium-grained sand), indica- tive of seasonal changes in sediment supply (Clifton et al., 1989). Organic detritus is comparatively less abundant, although unbored wood clasts are observed locally. The lower contact of these deposits is erosional and is typically demarcated by intraformational rip-up clasts, pebbly lags, and concentrations of woody or shelly debris. In summary, the Pleistocene deposits at Willapa Bay are comparable to the modern deposits. Sedimentological and ichnological similarities are particularly clear when deposits of like texture are compared. Interpretation of Point-bar Deposits Subtidal and intertidal point-bar deposits represent the dominant facies present in the Pleistocene record at Wil- lapa Bay. Trace fossils in these deposits lend insight into the distribution of physical and chemical stresses that were manifest in the ancient bay. Although it is difficult to assess precisely which physico-chemical parameters most influenced the ancient burrowing community, the modern bay deposits provides an analog in which some of the var- iables are estimable. Trace fossils in muddy point-bar deposits are sporadi- cally distributed and degrees of bioturbation vary between unburrowed to locally moderate. With the exception of rare Ophiomorpha and Psilonichnus, the trace fossils are diminutive, ranging between 1 and 3 mm in diameter and I - - 362 GINGRAS ET AL.</page><page sequence="12">MODERN AND PLEISTOCENE BRACKISH-WATER DEPOSITS 363 FIGURE 12-Different scales of view for muddy, main channel point bars.

These traces are similar to those observed in other brackish-water deposits (Howard and Frey, 1973, 1975; Pemberton and Wightman, 1992). Several parameters may have played a role in limiting the size and diversity of burrowing infauna. They include low- er levels of salinity or fluctuating salinity, oxygenation stress, turbidity stresses, rapid rates of sedimentation, and thermal stresses. Salinity is strongly correlated to di- munition of infauna and overall reductions in diversity (Fig. 11). Salinity fluctuation and overall low salinity ap- pear to place limitations on the size of burrowing fauna in this environment. Contrasting burrow assemblages in sandy versus muddy substrates are due to two factors; dif- ferent substrates are exploited in strikingly different man- ners, and sand and mud present dissimilar taphonomic barriers. This relationship is similar to Dorjes and How- ard's (1975) observation in the Ogeechee Estuary on the Georgia Coast. They found that 6 estuarine biofacies ex- hibited similar distributions as five mapped sedimentary facies. This is partly attributable to passive links between salinity and texture. The authors noted "physical energy and the salinity probably (our italics) play major roles in determining similarities between the physical and biogen- ic records." Extracting ancient relative salinity stress from the rock record is therefore a daunting, but resolvable challenge. Furthermore, a strong behavioral dependence on substrate texture implies that ichnologic changes with- in similar lithofacies provide more information than com- paring trace assemblages between lithofacies. Muddy Pleistocene point-bar deposits at Willapa Bay exhibit very similar ichnologic characteristics to their modern counterparts. They are locally unburrowed, al- though a stressed suite of trace fossils is usually present. The ichnologic suite is indicative of the salinity extremes and sedimentation stress to which the infauna was ex- posed, and is relative to its location in the ancient estuary. In modern deposits along the Palix River, for example, the trace assemblage changes markedly over just 2 km (Fig. 11), from a relatively robust sand-dwelling assemblage to a stressed, mud-dwelling assemblage. Remane and Schlie- per (1971) showed diversity of brackish species is consis- tently lower with reductions in salinity down to 5 ppt. This concentration represents a trough in the Remane Curve as freshwater species are increasingly abundant below 5 ppt.

Taphonomic considerations also are reflected in the pre- served trace fossil assemblage. Most of the observable traces are filled with silt or fine-grained sand, and tend to descend from the coarser-grained laminar components of the point-bar deposits. They are typically deformed due to syn- and post-depositional compaction of the sediment. Deep-penetrating burrows (&gt; 25 cm) descend into some- what compacted mud, and are less likely to undergo se- vere post-depositional deformation. These traces over- print the more subtle and deformed shallow traces, lend- ing an even more impoverished appearance to the trace assemblage. This bias is exaggerated because shallowly tiered traces are more vulnerable to erosion and may be removed by scouring currents. The deep burrows have the greatest probability of being passed into the historical re- cord (in this case, the Skolithos- and Gyrolithes-like bur- rows of Heteromastus, and the Thalassinoides-like bur- rows of Neotrypea). A notable contrast between sandy and muddy point bars is the presence of decapod burrows (Thalassinoides and Ophiomorpha) in sandy deposits, and their marked ab- sence in muddy deposits. This is due to fundamental be- havioral differences between sand shrimp and mud shrimp. Sand shrimp (Callianassa) process sand continu- ously, and its burrow is therefore dynamic, or typically shifting (Swinbanks and Lutenauer, 1987); hence, bur- rows are maintained easily in environments characterized by rapid rates of sedimentation. Another decapod, the shrimp Upogebia pugettensis, prefers muddy environ- ments. Upogebia differs from Callianassa in that it re- quires a permanent domicile (Swinbanks and Lutenauer, 1987; Dworshak, 1988). Maintaining a permanent and static domicile in a rapidly aggrading sedimentary envi- ronment is comparatively energy-demanding. The pres- ence of mud shrimp on active point bars is therefore miti- gated. In other words, the presence of shrimp burrows in a muddy deposit is indicative of colonization not on the point bar proper. In fact, decapod burrows in muddy deposits are most likely to occur within tidal flats, tidal channels, or in bay deposits (discussed later). In contrast, shrimp burrows are common in sandy point-bar deposits, as sand shrimp are not necessarily restricted to depositional envi- ronments characterized by slower rates of sediment ag- gradation. Some of the physical and chemical stresses exerted on runoff-creek (intertidal) point bars have an effect similar to that observed in main channel (subtidal) point bars. That said, intertidal point bars aggrade at a rapid rate and their ichnologic signatures are notably subdued by high sedimentation rates. Differentiating intertidal from sub- tidal point bars in outcrop is relatively simple, due mostly to the lateral relationship that intertidal point bars have I 364 GINGRAS ET AL.</page><page sequence="14">MODERN AND PLEISTOCENE BRACKISH-WATER DEPOSITS 365 FIGURE 14-Schematic representation of subtidal point bars and their relationship to intertidal flat deposits. This schematic is based on a muddy sand substrate and details a section along the Palix River (approximately at station 2, Fig. 11). At this location, the subtidal channel intersects ancient Pleistocene deposits and Upogebia pugittensis has colonized the firm substrate. The maldanid zone and Callianassa zone are those most observed in Pleistocene deposits at Willapa Bay. This is due to their fortuitous location, which maximizes preservation potential. with intertidal flat deposits. In cored successions, the cor- rect identification of these facies is more subtle. With re- spect to intertidal point-bar deposits, key criteria present at the core-scale include: inclined bedding, dipping be- tween 5? and 15?; the presence of a diminutive suite of traces, including Gyrolithes, Planolites, and Skolithos; a sharp lower contact that overlies strongly bioturbated in- tertidal flat deposits; a trace assemblage that potentially grades upwards into an ambient intertidal flat ichnofacies characterized by somewhat larger traces, higher degrees of bioturbation, and an increased diversity of trace fossils; and an accumulated thickness of less than 4 m (in meso- tidal estuaries). It is equally important to note that inter- tidal point bars are not likely passed into the historic re- cord if the substrate is primarily muddy or sandy. Inter- mediate substrates offer a compromise between meander rate and the rate of biogenic reworking that enhances the likelihood of their passage into the rock record. Sandy, Laterally Accreted Mid-Channel Tidal Bars Modern Tidal Bars Mid-channel tidal bars are prominent features of the main tidal channels in the lower estuary. They are char- acterized by rapidly shifting, medium- to coarse-grained sand and are subject to reworking by strong tidal currents. There is an overall paucity of burrowing, although several notable trace makers persist in this energetic environ- ment. Burrowers observed in this environment include: shallowly tiered, thick-shelled cockles; rare deep-burrow- ing bivalves, such as Tresus nuttalli; deep-penetrating, vertical Cerebratulids. Patchily distributed, deep-pene- trating Callianassa, Nereis, Nephtys, and various thread- worms are also present in variable densities. The result- ing trace assemblage consists of bivalve equilibrichnia, Si- phonichnus, robust Ophiomorpha and Thalassinoides, Skolithos, and rare Palaeophycus. The deepest-penetrat- ing burrows proffer the greatest likelihood of preservation in these deposits, which suggests the historical record is dominated by Ophiomorpha, Skolithos, and deep-seated bivalve traces. Bedforms include linguoid current ripples superim- posed on subaqueous dune forms. The larger-scale bed- forms are locally superimposed upon laterally-accreted, clinoform sets. Clinoforms dip gently (up to 10?) perpendic- ular to the dominant flow direction. The bedforms ob- served do not necessarily reverse from flood to ebb tide, as these bars are typically ebb- or flood-dominant (Clifton et al., 1989). Pleistocene Tidal Bars Pleistocene mid-channel tidal bar deposits exhibit many of the same sedimentological characteristics noted in the modern deposits. An excellent example is present at the South Bend Section (Fig. 16), where the overall degree of bioturbation is low (i.i. 1 to 2). Nevertheless, sporadically distributed Ophiomorpha, Thalassinoides, Teichichnus, Palaeophycus, and Siphonichnus are present throughout the section (Fig. 16B). These are of intermediate size, typ- MODERN AND PLEISTOCENE BRACKISH-WATER DEPOSITS 365</page><page sequence="15">366 GINGRAS ET AL. FIGURE 15-Pleistocene sandy, subtidal point-bar deposits.

(B) Radiograph of Pleistocene subtidal point-bar deposit at Willapa Bay. Note the overall similarity of this plate to Figure 13B. Skolithos (Sk), Diplocraterion (Di), Planolites (PI), and Palaeophycus (Pa) are present. Psilonichnus (Ps) is interpreted to represent the ancient burrow of a Hemigrapsus-like tracemaker. ically about 9 to 15 mm in diameter. Also common throughout the deposit are small, branching, sandy tubes of threadworms (Fig. 16C), possibly analogous to the cen- tral shaft of Paraonis spirals observed in the modem bay (Fig. 7B). The physical sedimentary structures include sharp- based, meter-scale clinoforms (Fig. 16A), and locally abun- dant trough crossbedding and ripple lamination (Fig. 16). Silt drapes over current-ripple lamination are common lo- cally, forming flaser to wavy bedding. Rare tabular cross bedding and upper-flow-regime planar lamination are also present. Flow directions measured from trough cross- stratified beds are typically perpendicular to the dip direc- tion of the clinoformed master bedding surfaces. Organic detritus is virtually absent; wood and shell fragments are rare. Rare heavy minerals, usually augite or magnetite, are present along the toesets of the clinoforms. Clinoformed packages have an erosional base and exhibit a gradual fin- ing upwards trend; they range in thickness from 3 to 4.5 m. Interpretation of Sandy Channel Bars Of the Pleistocene deposits present at Willapa Bay, sandy channel bars lend themselves best to an archetypal (i.e., Seilacherian) ichnofacies classification. The presence of Ophiomorpha, deep-penetrating Skolithos, Thalassino- ides, Teichichnus, and abundant threadworm tubes (Fig.16C) are indicative of the Skolithos Ichnofacies. The Skolithos ichnofacies is associated with rapidly shifting substrates in moderate to high-energy hydraulic regimes. This interpretation is supported by the physical sedimen- tary structures, which include current ripples, trough cross bedding, planar-tabular cross bedding, and upper- flow-regime planar bedding. These structures typically are superimposed on, and are indicative of current direc- tions perpendicular to, the laterally accreted clinoforms. The energetic nature of this depositional environment strongly biases the trace fossil record towards deep-seated traces. This is due to reworking of the upper portions of the substrate by storm- and tidal-currents, which effec- tively remove all evidence of biogenic activity in the shal- low portions of the substrate. The aforementioned trace fossil suite reflects this taphonomic bias, particularly the preserved Ophiomorpha, Thalassinoides, and Skolithos. In light of this, the pervasive occurrence of threadworm tubes is somewhat enigmatic. Their preservation, howev- er, is typically on aggradational surfaces, and is indicative of a 'conveyer belt' colonization strategy (Bromley, 1996). The presence of a robust Skolithos ichnofacies and the various sedimentary structures present constrain the lo- cation of this depositional environment relative to the con- figuration of the ancient bay. The potential subenviron- ments are further narrowed by the requirement for nutri- ent-rich (probably marine) water and a paucity of fine- grained clastics. All of the required physico-chemical parameters are most closely met in main tidal channels, in a location more or less proximal to the estuary mouth. In this area, tidal channels are subject to less salinity stress and therefore would be conducive to the development of a healthy Skolithos assemblage. Tidal channels also are subject to great variability in flow regime and to signifi- cant storm reworking, as is indicated by the suite of phys- ical sedimentary structures. Finally, the strong tidal cur- rents and geographic proximity to nutrient-rich marine water would have the ability to deliver a food resource to bay fauna dependent on marine organics. Subtidal, Quiescent Bay Deposits Modern and Pleistocene Subtidal Bay Deposits The present configuration of Willapa Bay is dominated by large tidal channels. Quiescent deposits, sheltered from tidal currents and wave energy, are rare in the modern bay. An exception is the area just southeast of Grassi Is- land (Fig. 1).

Robust polychaetes (Nereis, Glyceria, Nephtys) and bi- valves are also commonly observed, although their popu- lation densities were not assessed. A number of smaller threadworms are ubiquitously distributed throughout the substrate. The most conspicuous traces include Ophiom- orpha- and Thalassinoides-like burrows, which overprint a mottled fabric comprised of horizontal and subvertical deposit-feeding structures. Pleistocene deposits are similar in many respects. Large Ophiomorpha and Thalassinoides are common, crosscut- ting a suite of smaller deposit-feeding trace fossils, such as Planolites and Teichichnus (Fig. 17). Locally, Psilonichnus- like burrows, interpreted to represent the domiciles of bur- rowing crabs, are the dominant crustacean burrows (Fig. 17). Siphonichnus and bivalve adjustment traces are spo- radically distributed and locally absent. The degree ofbio- turbation is typically moderate to high, and primary sedi- mentary structures are commonly obliterated. Where the physical sedimentary structures are preserved, they con- sist of horizontal lamination, wavy lamination, and low- amplitude ripple forms. These ancient accumulations are generally muddy, although sandy deposits are present in Units 2 and 4. Wood and shell debris is dispersed sporadi- cally. Articulated bivalves may be present; most abundant are the shells of the native oyster, Ostrea lurida, which form lenticular beds locally. These in situ oyster beds are most abundant in strata that, uncharacteristically, are rarely bioturbated. Interpretation of Subtidal Bay Deposits Although quiescent bay deposits are relatively uncom- mon in modem Willapa Bay, sheltered accumulations in the present bay configuration are similar to some Pleisto- cene deposits observed in outcrop. The most distinctive bay deposits are those that are burrowed conspicuously with various crustacean burrows. These include an array of Ophiomorpha, Thalassinoides, and Psilonichnus that are generally (but not always) exclusive of each other. These relatively robust burrows overprint an assemblage of deposit-feeding traces predominantly consisting of Planolites and Palaeophycus. Bivalve traces and subverti- cal Skolithos are also locally present. This mixed trace as- semblage does not lend itself to archetypal ichnofacies classification. Rather, it suggests various ethologies are employed in this environment and that food resources are abundant in both the substrate and the water column. The mixed assemblages at Willapa Bay are comparable to ichnocoenoses observed in core by Beynon et al. (1988) in the Cretaceous Grand Rapids Formation of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. Beynon et al. (1988) noted that gross ethologies (suspension- vs. deposit-feeding) oc- curred together in what they interpreted as a salinity- stressed depositional environment. The paucity of physical sedimentary structures in qui- escent bay deposits indicates sedimentation rates were relatively low. Low sedimentation rates also suggest that the benthic community did not persist in the estuary's tur- bidity maxima. Somewhat perplexing is the presence of thin oyster beds in laminated, unburrowed, fine-grained sediment. The oyster, Ostrea lurida, is only moderately tolerant of turbid FIGURE 17-Radiograph of Pleistocene quiescent bay deposit. Note the large burrows cross cutting the small-burrow-mottled background fabric. Larger burrows include those of shrimp (Ophiomorpha, Op) and crabs (Psilonichnus, Ps). Gyrolithes (Gy), Planolites (PI), and Palaeo- phycus (Pa) are also shown. conditions and, compared to certain burrowing poly- chaetes, is not particularly hardy. Laminated and unbur- rowed silt and mud reflects mainly turbid conditions. The presence of a turbid water column is contradictory when juxtaposed with in situ oyster beds. Ostrea lurida (and other oysters) are primarily filter feeders and are over- whelmed by exceptionally turbid water. The absence of trace fossils indicates extreme physico-chemical condi- tions were present when these strata were deposited. Ul- timately, the question becomes, if oysters are present, why are the traces of their stalwart invertebrate associates not evident? All of the evidence implies that the deposition of I 368 GINGRAS ET AL.</page><page sequence="18">MODERN AND PLEISTOCENE BRACKISH-WATER DEPOSITS 369 laminated silt and mud was intermittent, allowing lentic- ular oyster beds to develop in channels and protected bays. Perhaps this is indicative of shifts of the bay's tur- bidity maxima. Such a shift would likely have to endure several seasons to permit colonial oyster growth. Burrow- ing might have been inhibited by the development of oys- ter beds, which precluded the development of an infaunal community below their densely packed shells. This rela- tionship is certainly reflected in the modem bay, where in- fauna is notably sparse below well-developed mounds of Crassostrea. The protected bay is among the variable depositional environments preserved in the Pleistocene strata at Wil- lapa Bay. Variability results from differing degrees of tidal or fluvial dominance, various bay configurations, the state of bay-fill aggradation, the nature of the sediment supply and decade- or century-scale weather patterns. These ob- servations underscore the problematic nature of identify- ing similar depositional environments from core and wire- line datasets. DISCUSSION Variability in Estuary Deposits Although most researchers agree that the stratigraphy and sedimentology of estuary deposits is complex, little consideration is given to the significance of facies changes in IVF. Both modern and Pleistocene deposits at Willapa Bay show a great degree of variability resulting from changes in sediment supply, magnitude of the tidal prism, and changing chemical conditions in the moder and an- cient bay. Many of these factors are linked to climate var- iability. At San Francisco Bay, historical records show that the shoreline position, salinity, and bay-fauna cycles are remarkably variable (Peterson et al., 1995). This vari- ability is expressed on the annual-, decade-, and century- scale, and might be linked to climatic patterns and recent anthropogenic effects. El Nifio, for example, can be related to changes in estuary salinity. With each El Nifo / South- ern Oscillation event (ENSO), streamflow along the west- ern U.S.A. changes dramatically (Ely et al., 1993). Fluvial input into estuaries changes with streamflow. Storm ac- tivity along the Pacific northwest also increases with ENSO. Salinity measurements in San Fransisco Bay ap- pear to be altered due to ENSO cyclicity (as much as 8 ppt near the mouth of the bay; Peterson et al., 1995) on short- and long-term trends. ENSO cyclicity has been exceeding- ly variable historically. Anderson (1990) documented cy- cles of 90, 50, and 22 to 24 years, during which ENSO events are more frequent. Anderson et al. (1992) suggest- ed that the effects of El Niino are evident in Pleistocene de- posits off the coast of California. In core extracted from this area, 'varved' sediment is punctuated by bioturbated zones. Their interpretation (Anderson et al., 1992) is that bioturbated horizons represent conditions of warmer sur- face water and increased dissolved oxygen in the water column during El Nifo events. Laminated zones represent cooler La Nifia conditions where oxygen levels were de- creased due to upwelling and increased oxygen consump- tion, which was associated with increased planktonic pro- duction. The effects on marine biota may, then, be pro- found. This illustrates that El Ninfo conditions persisted in the Pleistocene, and that its effects on the marine ecology at that time probably influenced marginal marine sys- tems, such as the ancient Willapa Bay. It is unknown how much climatic variability is neces- sary to have a significant effect on estuarine biota. Very few long-term studies exist and most focus on seasonal variability. At Willapa Bay, no historical salinity, oxygen, or temperature records exist for the past 30 years. A num- ber of anthropomorphic changes can be noted, however. They include: the damming of the Columbia River, which conceivably reduced the magnitude of the freshwater plume entering the Pacific Ocean just south of Willapa Bay; increasing denudation of the forests adjacent to riv- ers that empty into the bay; the introduction of east coast species, such as Spartina (a round grass); and increased levels of nutrient-rich pollutants from farmland and hous- ing adjacent to the bay. Among other things, these chang- es influence that amount of sediment influx into the bay, decrease the duration of freshettes (rainwater runoff) in the bay, and alter the distribution of ecospace for the plants and animals living in the bay. Sudden changes in the rock record result from a natural variability that is inherent to estuarine systems. The sen- sitivity of biota to subtle changes in bays and estuaries make trace fossils useful indicators of change that is in- trinsic and extrinsic to the depositional system. This is only true, however, if facies changes are persistent, map- pable, and can be placed in a genetic framework. Assessment of the Brackish Water Model The ichnology of brackish-water deposits has been char- acterized by previous researchers (Pemberton et al., 1982; MacEachern et al., 1992; Pemberton and Wightman, 1992; MacEachern and Pemberton, 1994). Key ichnologic criteria include a diminutive assemblage of traces and a low diversity ofichnogenera. Also, trace fossils such as Gy- rolithes, Skolithos, Planolites, Cylindrichnus, and Palaeo- phycus, are common in these deposits. Combined with valuable physical sedimentological data, the general mod- el has been applied with notable success in both core and outcrop. One of the finest examples of a Cretaceous brack- ish-water deposit is the McMurray Formation in the West- ern Canadian Sedimentary Basin of Alberta, Canada (Pemberton et al., 1982; Mattison et al., 1989; Ranger and Pemberton, 1992; Pemberton and Wightman, 1992). De- tailed analysis of its ichnology, sedimentology, and stratig- raphy have allowed high-certainty interpretation of this unit as an estuarine IVF (Wightman and Pemberton, 1997). Like the McMurray Formation, Pleistocene depos- its at Willapa Bay are important because they represent another example of trace fossil assemblages in a probable brackish-water deposit (Clifton and Phillips, 1980; Clifton, 1982; Anima et al., 1989). Generally, the brackish-water model applies equally well in the moder and Pleistocene deposits at Willapa Bay. Diminutive examples of typical brackish-water forms are present in low-diversity assemblages in every deposi- tional environment, except sandy, laterally accreted chan- nel bars. The notable exception to the aforementioned pa- rameters is the potential presence of robust crustacean traces overprinting typical brackish-water assemblages (Fig. 11).

In these situations, it is appropriate to consider the size and diversity of the primarily worm-burrowed back- ground assemblage as being indicative of salinity stress. Why is the worm-burrowed suite apparently more sensi- tive to fluctuating and lower levels of salinity? This relates primarily to the evolutionary means by which the animal responds to reduced or fluctuating salinity. Salinity stress is coped with through physiologic, anatomical, morpholog- ical, and ecological innovation or through behavioral ad- aptation (Spaargaren, 1979, 1995). These strategies pro- vide different adaptive landscapes for animals living in brackish-water environments. Dimunition is an example of morphologic adaptation. Decreasing size in response to salinity occurs for two rea- sons: it is advantageous for the organism as it allows the animal to change its surface area to mass ratio quickly and 'fine tune' the rate at which osmotic transfer occurs; and, in environments that are characteristically extremely brackish (approaching 5 ppt), animals expend large amounts of energy maintaining a concentration gradient (Spaargaren, 1979), sacrificing growth. An excellent ex- ample of dimunition was provided by Remane and Schlei- per (1971) with bivalve species from the North Sea. They showed systematic reductions in body length correlated almost linearly with lowering salinity. Five species of bi- valve in particular (Mytilus edulis, Mya arenaria, Mya truncata, Cardium edule, and Macoma balthica) were as much as 35% smaller than their original size where com- paring salinity levels of 35 ppt versus 5 ppt. As with all ideals based on natural systems, there are exceptions to dimunition. This depends on where an animal falls on its brackish adaptive landscape. Some animals actually in- crease body size slightly with decreasing levels of salinity. Female copepods, for instance, have been shown to re- spond in such a manner (Miliou, 1996). Most likely, dimunition of trace fossils as observed at Willapa Bay is a result of population dynamics as opposed to true morphologic adaptation. Powell and Stanton (1996), working at Copano Bay, Texas, separated the size- frequency distribution of bay populations into small- and large-size classes. They noted that under resource- stressed conditions the two size groups responded quite differently. Typically the large size class reached some fraction of their species optimal size (true dimunition). Smaller-size organisms typically attained full growth for the species (Powell and Stanton, 1996) and their biomass was essentially unchanged. Conceivably, this relationship is similar to the salinity-stressed assemblages illustrated in Figure 11. The consistently smaller (worm) burrow di- ameters are species-specific. At station 1 and 2, robust ter- ebellids make the largest annelid burrows; the largest common worm burrows at station 3 are excavated by Sac- coglossus; and Heteromastus perforates the muddy sub- strate at Stations 4 and 5 (Fig. 11). Interestingly, Hetero- mastus is also present at stations 1 through 3 and is iden- tical in every respect (including size) to those observed at Stations 4 and 5 (Fig. 11). These data suggest that, al- though the burrowing population is comprised of increas- ingly smaller organisms, the individual species are not en- during size reduction. In contrast, Upogebia and Callianassa have repeatedly been shown to modulate their burrow environment by ir- rigating their burrows when chemical conditions in the water column are most amenable (Thompson, 1967; Thompson and Pritchard, 1969; Swinbanks and Luter- nauer, 1987; Dworshak, 1988). Parameters such as oxy- genation, salinity, and pH are buffered by the volume of water in the burrow, which can be sealed during rain and run-off (Spaargaren, 1979; Rickets et al., 1985; Swinbanks and Luternauer, 1987; Spivak et al., 1994). Behavioral in- novations make physiological adaptation less relevant. The advantages of deep burrowing and maintaining a vol- ume of water amenable to an organism's respiratory re- quirements are enjoyed by several burrowers, including Callianassa, the fiddler crab Uca crenulata, large bi- valves, and to some extent Arenicola (Rankin and Daven- port, 1981; Rickets et al., 1985). Maintaining a stable bur- row environment does not completely protect infauna from the rigors of fluctuating physico-chemical conditions. Szedlmayer and Able (1996) studied patterns of habitat use by fishes and decapods in southern New Jersey. They found that seasonal temperature, percent silt, and salinity were the key factors influencing the distribution of several types of fish and the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus; no size data were recorded. Although large crustacean burrows contradict the orig- inal tenets of the brackish-water model, their presence in a sedimentary deposit should not alone dismiss the possi-</page><page sequence="21">372 GINGRAS ETAL. bility of a brackish-water origin. In fact, large (&gt;lcm di- ameter) Thalassinoides and Ophiomorpha cross-cutting a low-diversity suite of diminutive trace fossils can be typi- cal of brackish deposits. Ultimately, the familiar appeal to consider the ichnofabric (or ichnofacies) as a whole is reit- erated. Many studies have successfully integrated ichnofacies into tripartite estuarine models (Pattison, 1992; Mac- Eachern and Pemberton, 1994; Buatois et al., 1997). Other researchers have noted a general mixing of ethologies that are not particularly well suited to classification into Sei- lacherian ichnofacies (Pemberton et al., 1982; Beynon et al., 1988). Excepting depositional environments proximal to the bay mouth and, locally, in quiescent bay deposits, no excellent examples of the Cruziana and the Skolithos ich- nofacies have been noted in modern or Pleistocene depos- its at Willapa Bay. Application of Seilacherian ichnofacies may depend, in part, on the degree to which wave or tidal processes are manifested in the bay. Wave-dominated es- tuaries, for example, proffer the abrupt energy gradients required to provide discrete, predictable facies segregation (Reading and Collinson, 1996). In contrast, tide-dominat- ed estuaries transmit tidal energy to the upper estuary, distributing energy more evenly in the bay. Willapa Bay exchanges 45% of its volume daily (U.S. Army Corp. of En- gineers, 1975) and is best classified as a mixed to some- what tidally-dominated estuary. SUMMARY Both modern and Pleistocene deposits at Willapa Bay are interpreted to have been deposited under primarily brackish conditions. An important exception to this is sed- iments that were deposited near the bay mouth. The sedi- mentological and ichnological characteristics of five depo- sitional environments are considered in this paper: (1) in- tertidal flats; (2) intertidal point bars; (3) fluvially- through tidally-influenced main point-bar deposits; (4) subtidal, laterally-accreted mid-channel tidal bars, and; (5) quiescent central bay deposits. Each environment can be discerned from the others on the basis ofichnologic data (Table 1). Intertidal flat deposits are typically thoroughly bioturbated by a somewhat diminutive suite of shafts and burrows that are locally cross-cut by robust crustacean dwellings. Tidal creek point-bar deposits are sporadically burrowed by minute Gyrolithes, Skolithos, Cylindrichnus, Planolites, Palaeophycus, and rare, small, bivalve equili- brichnia. Fluvially- through tidally-influenced main point-bar deposits are sporadically bioturbated with ver- tical traces that are superimposed upon inclined hetero- lithic stratification. Moderately to thoroughly bioturbated bay deposits are normally burrowed by relatively robust forms of Ophiomorpha, Teichichnus, Skolithos and bivalve equilibrichnia. Finally, mid-channel tidal bar deposits typically display robust bivalve equilibrichnia, rare Ophiomorpha, and deep-penetrating Skolithos; this as- semblage is indicative of the Skolithos ichnofacies. Of the environments considered, point-bar and intertid- al flat deposits are the most variable laterally, and are therefore the most useful paleogeographic indicators at Willapa Bay. Both of these depositional environments are characterized by striking changes (and fluctuations) in sa- linity and kinetic energy from the lower to the upper es- tuary. Textural changes can be linked to changes in the hydraulic energy and are generally evident in transects from the lower to upper estuary. At Willapa Bay these de- posits in the upper estuary are dominated by mud and sandy mud. Sedimentation in the middle and lower estu- ary is dominated by the deposition of fine- to medium- grained sands. Trace assemblages present in the upper es- tuary are generally extremely stressed and are dominated by a low diversity suite (less than 5 major burrowing fau- na) of small (&lt;2 mm diameter) burrows. Although the brackish-water model applies to deposits at Willapa Bay, it is not archetypal. Furthermore, there is some question as to whether Seilacherian ichnofacies can be utilized to best describe these deposits. In general, the sedimentological and ichnological characteristics of Willa- pa Bay are similar to other brackish-water deposits. Although ichnofabrics at Willapa Bay are generally comprised of diminutive ichnofossils, large diameter crus- tacean burrows locally cross-cut these fabrics. There is some question as to the nature and mechanisms by which dimunition (commonly observed in these deposits) occurs. We suggest this is a reflection of population composition as opposed to true dimunition. If tested and proven else- where, these additional characteristics should also be in- corporated into the brackish model. Most importantly, data presented herein may help ge- ologists resolve facies distribution and identify deposition- al environments in the subsurface. A better understand- ing of these systems from modern- and outcrop-based studies will ultimately help delineate ancient estuaries.
