Mais elle ne saurait le combler. (Before him, man encounters Nature; he has a grip on her, he attempts to adapt her to his desire. But she cannot fill his needs.) --Simone de Beauvoir, Le Deuxitme Sexe (1949) Art is a counterpoint, a standard against which unruly nature is measured, controlled. -Susan Griffin, The Eros of Everyday Life (1995) n the preface to his Briefe Discourse of the True Use of Charact'ring the Degrees of 1614, Thomas Ravenscroft praises his fellow composer John Bennet by explaining that he could easily believe that Bennet "had somwhat more then Art, even some Naturall instinct or Better In- spiration, by which, in all his workes, the very life of that Passion, which the Ditty sounded, is so truely exprest, as if he had measured it alone by his owne Soule."' Aside from its fashionable homage to Neoplatonism, Ravenscroft's statement emphasizes a reflexive continuity between the nat- ural, human, and divine realms whose centrality to early modern musical discourse merits reexamination. The dominant epistemology of the era considered music a branch of "Natural Philosophy," the broad inquiry into the nature of the visible and invisible universe that blended what we would today recognize as the studies of nature and culture.2 It is therefore not Previous versions of this paper were read at the Biennial Conference on Baroque Music, Ed- inburgh, 1994; and the National Meeting of the Renaissance Society of America, Blooming- ton, 1996. 1.

To a people for whom past, present, metaphor, physical reality, myth, and nature were not en- tirely separable, producers of ordered sound from diverse nations, eras, al- legorical traditions, and even species were drawn together by numerous philosophically informed thinkers on the basis of their musical behaviors. However, two distinct conceptual strands in these works provide a link between musicians as seemingly disjunct as wild songbirds and elite court composers: in a world in which speech and random noise constituted the auditory norm, musical ability signaled some sort of exception. And, perhaps inevitable in an intellectual milieu that had consciously absorbed classical and Scholastic categories of nature and morality, the most praise- worthy musicians were those whose auditory products suggested the order and perfection of the inaudible harmonies of heaven. At first glance, early modern English writers appear to have considered musicians in either natural, historical-allegorical, or modem human con- texts, according to the genre, discipline, or intended audience for any given work. As with other intellectual constructs of the period, such categories were fluidly linked to an ordered universe in which most things were be- lieved to signify others through a complex series of webs between the past and the present, and the visible and invisible worlds. Historically, the very nature of matter has been a cultural notion in the West, continually rede- fined by the shifting powers of perception and imagination to generate new concepts of physical reality.3 Renaissance and early Baroque thinkers chose not to sort the world's behavior into dichotomous categories of mundane and magical; to them, there was no need to distinguish between phenom- enologically ordinary and extraordinary objects of inquiry, or what we would consider today as scientific or cultural approaches to reality.4 Ob- jects and events from any one plane of existence or historical moment il- luminated all others. By this means the unfamiliar became tangible and comprehensible through analogy, and the ordinary held the possibility of in our Language (London: John Legatt, 1616), sig. M2, in which music is literally defined as an aspect of natural philosophy. This seminal vernacular dictionary, the second ever published in England, was reprinted no fewer than twenty-four times between 1621 and 1775. 3.

English writers often positioned musical practices from the natural, human, and celestial realms so that they mutually reflected each other for moral or didactic purposes, or cast light on the divine plan that governed all. They praised or damned living English musicians through painstaking comparisons to their continental colleagues, their mythological forebears, or their natural antecedents. They presented more exotic music makers in culturally familiar terms. Writers were less concerned with time, place, materiality, and musical accessibility than with reinforcing their pur- poses with a full arsenal of familiar intellectual tools. The result was an aesthetic and historical web through which distant mythological figures like Arion attained comprehensibility as humble English musicians who earned court patronage, court composers like John Johnson metamor- phosed into abstract conceptual embodiments of order, and the armies of the Bee King played martial pipes and horns on their daily watch. Philosophies of Nature and the Languages of Man By the end of the sixteenth century, Western intellectual inquiry had reached a cognitive crossroads. Most fields continued to grant primary au- thority to specific venerated thinkers of the past and to established tradi- tions of received wisdom. But many had also begun to admit what modern minds accept as empirical data and scientific rationalism. Such evidently contrasting and often internally contradictory systems as Aristotelian es- sentialism, Christian mysticism, Hermetic and Neoplatonic magic, Scho- lastic logic, and the foundations of scientific experimentalism often blended in ways that may seem improbable or contradictory today, particularly in descriptions and attribution of causality within the natural world. Human knowledge held various purposes and offered many keys to its diverse adherents: the ecstatic contemplation of eternity, a clear glimpse into the invisible world, the rational control of unruly Nature, a retreat to the per- fection of the vanished past, or the careful maintenance or radical disrup- tion of the established social order, among others. Michel Foucault perhaps most concisely describes the internal logic of this epistemological labyrinth, founded on principles of interpretation across evident and hidden bound- aries: To us, it seems that sixteenth-century learning was made up of an unstable mixture of rational knowledge, notions derived from magical practices, and a whole cultural heritage whose power and authority had been vastly in- creased by the rediscovery of Greek and Roman authors. Perceived thus, the learning of that period appears structurally weak: a common ground where fidelity to the Ancients, a taste for the supernatural, and an already awakened awareness of that sovereign rationality in which we recognize ourselves, con- fronted one another in equal freedom. . ... To know must therefore be to</page><page sequence="4">4 Journal of the American Musicological Society interpret: to find a way from the visible mark to that which is being said by it and which, without that mark, would lie like unspoken speech, dormant within things.5 In spite of what seems at first a contradictory muddle of ancient and modern cognitive methodologies, the natural philosophy and related dis- ciplines of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were largely based on principles of resemblance between the diverse elements of an ordered universe through which one could read beyond obvious, visible signs and discern underlying truths.6 An eclectic compendium of received wisdom principally considered Nature a paradoxically symbolic and artificial realm through which to justify and explain the human position in the cosmos.7 Semiotic systems of classification of this sort remain subject more to human cultural concerns and a passion for symbolism than to hard scientific rea- son,s and thus tend to regard language as the principal bridge between things seen and unseen, or apprehended and comprehended. "Language," says Foucault with particular reference to the end of the Renaissance, must, therefore, be studied itself as a thing in nature. .... [For] language stands halfway between the visible forms of nature and the secret conve- niences of esoteric discourse .... it is a secret that carries within itself, though 5.

It is at the same time a buried revelation and a revelation that is gradually being restored to ever greater clarity.9 Numerous Renaissance and Baroque thinkers remind us repeatedly that language and music formed an intellectually inseparable continuity of rhetorical persuasion. The former provided rational content and the latter served as an extra-rational channel for memory or affect. This conception of the world, which gradually broke down between the end of the Renais- sance and the Age of Enlightenment, acknowledged that language, as a representation of the interconnectedness of things through analogies, lit- erally held the universe together. The power of words rendered visible the invisible, and conversely reembodied tangible entities in metaphor. 0 The world of nature, in which nightingales sang sweetly and bees produced their own form of esoteric discourse, lacked humanly comprehensible words. Bestial rhetoric often remained inaccessible to human ears. The an- cient Greeks, whose musical marvels the Renaissance and early Baroque sought so carefully to recapture, generally reserved grave moral suspicion and affective disdain for the disordered sounds of the wild and those who would emulate them. But sometimes they described the aesthetic purity and clarity of human singers in terms of the most melodious natural crea- tures.11 The Christian theology that had absorbed these ideas had long taught that humanity was created of the same matter and process as visible, cor- ruptible Nature, destined to return to the same gross ash and dust. Yet after death, human beings alone of all mortal creatures could shed this dross and perhaps return to the eternal harmony of the Divine. Christianity thus es- tablished a broad gulf between humanity and the base Nature that guarded incomprehensible secrets, leaving civilized society surrounded by a threat- ening universe full of uncontrollable passion and animal instinct, with which it could communicate only through a hieratic system of signs and 9.

Since their brutish descendants remained in the primitive world of nature while Adam's fallen sons eternally sought their vanished divinity through the complexities of rational knowledge, the songs of the wild had to be more primeval than the complexities of human language. Nature spoke the ungovernable speech of passion and primordial messages left over from the Creation, whereas civilization spoke an everlasting language of reason and abstract concepts, transliterable into enduring written form.i3 The West has long held that the irrationality of sound severed from linguistic sense destroys accepted beliefs and significations, and loses its close tie to transcendence and theology. It additionally borders on the unconscious, the psychotic, and the wild sensuality of animal pleasure.'4 As Foucault reminds us, early modern philosophers were especially certain that the sounds made by voices provided only a transitory and precarious transla- tion of the true divine language. "What God introduced into the world was written words," he explains of late sixteenth-century thought; "Adam, when he imposed their first names upon animals, did no more than read those visible and silent marks.... the written had always preceded the spoken, certainly in nature, and perhaps even in the knowledge of men."'5s Therefore men of knowledge and education were required to interpret natural music and transcribe it into its enduring written form. These elite thinkers were also duty bound to point out that the music of the intui- tive natural musician, whether beast, woman, or "common minstrel," was 12.

When we turn to accounts published in early modem England, we see a variety of attitudes and treatments of natural musicians, as well as a re- liance on both the received wisdom of earlier thinkers and fresh personal observation. Nevertheless, commentaries almost always relate the subjects to the familiar modem human world, with its written language, its notated music, and its cultural institutions. No less an authority than Plato had codified the fact that all young creatures, and all who have perception of order, harmony, and rhythm, are naturally drawn to the precise movements of body and voice that constituted ordered music.16 His simple idea be- came central to Western attitudes toward music, government, and living entities over the next thousand years and more. During these long centuries of intellectual change, it was expanded, glossed, and reencoded toward a multiplicity of intellectual and didactic ends by countless writers. By the sixteenth century, the English theorist who speaks at greatest length of an- imalian response to music emphasizes the most humanized responses of those he categorizes as dwellers on land, air, or water, and demonstrates their particular susceptibility to the highest artifice of human instrumental music.7 Specific studies and creative products likewise emphasize anthro- pomorphic facets of natural music, or attempt to improve on the limited forms found among wild creatures and habitats. Natural Histories and Music To begin at the bottom of the bestial hierarchy, both Edward Topsell, in his Historie of Serpents (1608), and Charles Butler, in his Feminine Monar- chie (1609), clearly derive part of their interest in bees from Pliny's Natural History, which remained one of the principal sources of information about animals well into the seventeenth century.'8 Topsell's work, however, is firmly grounded in the anecdotal tradition of received wisdom, whereas Butler's incorporates a more experimental mode of observation. Such fas- cination with the music of bees has a longstanding place in Western culture, for bees uniquely straddle the worlds of domestic and untamed animals in the tradition of husbandry, and additionally possess so many "home- endearing qualities" that seem to reflect the human world.'9 Furthermore, these little humming creatures who embody summer and sweetness for the human imagination perfectly represent the fact that, for millennia, our 16.

"Bees have also their Ambassadours and Orators," he tells us, sent with commission or authority, and put trust to deale in their Princes affayres, their old beaten Souldiers, their Pypers, Trumpetters, home- winders, Watchmen, Scour-watches, and Sentinels.... Their Pipers and horn-blowers doe aedere Ziggon, as Hesychius saith (the Englishmen terme it Sing) and that they make to be the watch-word and privy token for their watch and ward, sleepe, and daily labour.21 This final observation is, of course, particularly reminiscent of the manner in which Topsell's contemporaries and their sources describe the musical pastimes of the human watchmen and manual laborers. Here these activ- ities are perfectly reflected within a miniature apiarian kingdom. The hu- man world remains the model for ordered labor and its political end.22 Topsell additionally hears among his musical insects a "solitary, mourne- full, and peculiar kinde of voyce, as it were of some trumpet" to signal revolt when members of the state protest against their king's tyranny, cruelty, or violent rule, and seek a new domicile.23 Following the death of a just monarch, however, they mourn him in a manner strikingly similar to the royal court of any early modern nation, complete with great public bewailment by senators and aldermen, and soft funereal laments before the ruler's body: But a good King they never forsake, and if any time he pine and fall away by reason of sicknes, any plague or murren, or through old age, all the meaner sort do make mone, the whole route and multitude of Senators and Alder- men do greatly bewaile him ... filling the whole house with sorrowfull hum- mings &amp; laments, and gathering themselves by heapes about the carkasse of the dead King, they doe with great noyse tragically mourne for him.24 In a work first published only a year after Topsell's, Charles Butler, country parson, grammarian, music theorist, and beekeeper, heard and saw a slightly different world within the beehive. Not only did Butler correctly 20. Ibid., 137. 21. Edward Topsell, The Historie of Serpents (London: William Jaggard, 1608), 68. 22.

Unlike Topsell, Butler abandons the traditional union of allegory and perception through which the former had described a perfect anthropomorphic political state in miniature, complete with its expected military trumpeters and court musicians. Instead, he fa- vors what his senses apprehend. He deciphers the activity and communi- cation of the beehive not with a traditional natural historian's didactic sense, but with a musician's technical vocabulary. In this manner, he trans- forms the secret language of the bees into the most esoteric of human dis- courses, raising it from the arcane, shifting words of the Book of Nature where Creation had left it, to enduring, comprehensible form. His original treatise transcribes specific sounds associated with precise behavior in the bees' life cycle so that they can be studied, understood, and reproduced by human means. Butler's queendom of busy domestic workers contrasts sharply with Topsell's princely court of diplomats and militiamen. Instead of adhering to elite classical models of natural history, Butler follows a pragmatic West- ern tradition of animal husbandry through which beekeepers have long centered discussions of apiarian gender on family and household.25 Even his understanding of the social position of bees' music moves from the masculine world of public statecraft and defense to the private world of feminine domesticity. His narrative shifts from observation of the men of another species to improvement on simple feminine art. After the first publication of 1609, with its brief, literal transcription of insectoid buzzing (Ex. 1), the composer saw fit to improve on the limited musical power of his domesticated females. Accordingly, he enhanced it with the pleasing harmonic and melodic dimensions of a four-voice mad- rigal. The Feminine Monarchie is perhaps most famous among modern mu- sicologists and performers for its inclusion of a four-part bees' madrigal, or melissomelos, in the editions of 1623 and 1634.26 The public performances described by Topsell are thereby recast into the most private of human musical genres (Ex. 2). The natural language of the insects is given not only notational permanence in this madrigal, but also the increased intellectual challenge and precision of text, harmony, and greater rhythmic and me- lodic complexity. This primordial noise has metamorphosed into the high- est human artifice through the composer's modern madrigalian aesthetic and the rhetorical specificity of text; at the same time, he has noted the foundation of such musical artifice in base nature. 25.

JANhus Through such means, the entomologist-composer has transformed the simple sounds of his tiny winged females from the practical but barely com- prehensible signals he had first notated into domestic decoration and witty wonder for human entertainment. No longer the natural philosopher observing the public customs of a manly state in miniature, he functions</page><page sequence="11">Nature, Culture, Myth, and the Musician 11 instead as the imperial explorer refashioning a simple effeminate product for consumption by his own culture. Lest the quaint and simpleminded original distract too much attention from the composer's exquisite finished artifice, Butler reminds any performer or reader that his are the more im- portant notes, the truly outstanding and memorable aspects of the piece. As he explains, his polished melissomelos serves as a brief example of perfect compositional technique. "In the later editions the music is so elaborated," observes Gerald Hayes in his classic article on Butler and the music of the bees, "that without a reference to the first edition our author might be thought to credit the bees with a power of composition worthy of an ac- complished musician."27 The first three strophes of text extol the merits of what Butler allegorizes as a fine "Amazonian" monarchy. This opening section further distances the listener from the world of bees through its third-person narrative voice and unremarkable madrigalian style. At this point, the clear English words disintegrate into a humanly incomprehensible buzzing complete with in- sistent harmonic dissonance, which the composer-poet had "thought good here to pricke downe, that you may see in [these sections of the madrigal] all these particulars of [the bees'] Naturall Art."28 Butler at last completely frames this natural noise with the high artifice of four-part counterpoint and human words because his "dull hearing could not perfectly apprehend" and thus forced him "to make up that, as I could."29 "In this melissomelos, or Bees Madrigall," he tells us, "Musicians may see the ground of their Art. ... And if any man dislike the harshnesse of the Seconds and Sevenths, which now and then hit among them; he sheweth himselfe no experienced Artist. ... So that if Musicke were lost, it might be found with the Muses Birds."30 Butler sets the texted sections in mundane madrigalian fashion, devoid of the word-painting and unexpected harmonic shifts that charac- terize the most expressive examples of the genre, governed by the rhythm of the English words. In contrast, the composer leaves the "naturall art" passages relatively static in rhythm and harmony, colored only by the harshly exotic intervals he describes in his entomological narrative, for the incomprehensible speech of the bees lacks all complexities of the English language or rules of madrigalian part writing (Ex. 2). The work thus be- comes a human celebration of the music of another order, a triumph of artifice over the Nature that inspired it, tied ultimately to the muses who govern art and unruly nature at the behest of Apollonian order. 27.

Butler's passing reference to the avian kingdom serves as a reminder that the similarities between the musics of humans and birds especially fascinated thinkers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, who anticipated modem theories that bird song must have had some role in the creation and evolution of human music.3' The keenly observant Francis Bacon quickly dismisses bees from his con- sideration of musical creatures because of the involuntary, nonvocal nature of their rather dull buzzing. Instead, he informs us with great authority that "we know Nothing, that can at pleasure make aMusicall, or Immusical Sound, by voluntaryMotion, but the Voice ofMan, and Birds," and goes on to demonstrate that the uniquely shared ability of birds and children to learn speech suggests that pedagogy involves the physical transmission of spirits between teacher and pupil, "one of the highest secrets in Nature."32 Singing, winged birds, with their particular social rituals, nesting habits, and ability to soar beyond terrestrial confinement, exerted endless fascina- tion for a people steeped in an allegorical habit of mind that particularly emphasized the power of language, hidden similitude, and the metaphys- ical position of humanity between earth and heaven. The learned and de- vout author of the anonymous Praise ofMusicke (1586) reminds his reader that Nature taught the fowler that he could best subdue these tasty crea- tures "so far out of his reach &amp; jurisdiction" through their inborn delight in his songs, even as he instructs the same reader to "learn by their ex- a[m]ple, what thy duty is &amp; ought to be in grateful singing of psalms and songs to him that made thee."33 Pierre Boaistuau's eclectic compendium of early modern knowledge, Theatrum Mundi (1566?), translated from its original Latin and French into English, typically credits swans and night- ingales to have been the original teachers of music to humanity. The night- ingale in particular, he tells us, must have had some master musician as a teacher, for the bird sings an amazing variety of songs with almost excessive obstinacy. "What man is there," he asks his reader, "be he never so blockish or dull spirited, that doth not marvel, and that is not ravished with an un- speakable delectation, hearing ye melodie that proceedeth from the Night- ingale, and howe such a shrill and harmonicall voice may issue out of so little a trunke." 34The little bird's song is richly sensuous, enchanting, and uncontrolled, emanating from a perfect, primal instrument, the author 31.

Like the purest, most affective celestial or human music, the nightingale's exquisite natural song ravishes the spirits of any who hear it "even to the heavens," just as the spirit of his master-teacher had implicitly imbued his voice. With only a single voice and minuscule body, the mar- velous avian sings treble, mean, and bass, moving from simple plainsong to the spontaneous display of virtuosic beauty.35 The language with which Boaistuau immortalizes the tiny creature's song is almost identical to the most sensuous descriptions of musical affect, and of specifically feminine musical excess, by the religious and mystical writers of the era.36 For Boaistuau, then, the irrational utterances of nature's most melodious rhet- orician carry the same power as any higher form of harmony but without the specific intellectual content that would make them fully comprehensible or divine. It thus remains to his human pupils to transcend his wild mel- odies and sing comprehending praise to their common Creator. Boaistuau's phenomenal little bird, who would sooner die than cease his melodious paean to his invisible teacher-creator, belongs to a long and mul- tifaceted European iconographical tradition that connects his unusually musical species to extraordinary human expressions of ecstasy or pain, ranging from the erotic to the theological.37 Medieval and early modern commentaries most often wavered between the contrasting extremes of Pliny's joyous marvel, whose unceasing song rendered the bird a more valuable commodity than a page or bond-slave, and Ovid's darkly tragic Philomela, transformed into the solitary nocturnal singer only after suffer- ing the repeated horrors of rape, mutilation, and abuse beyond human en- durance. In this case, the creature becomes a Christianized symbol of the faith and transcendence of earthly pain and sorrow. He represents the no- ble man who praises God with all his courage, stepping beyond the rational use of content-laden human language to sing psalms and songs to his Maker with every instinctual fiber of his being. He is the living image of the greatest love of all, embodied in Christ.38 35. Ibid., sigs. C5v-C6v. 36.

Commonly</page><page sequence="20">20 Journal of the American Musicological Society The nightingale's extraordinarily expressive and highly arousing voca- lise, here correctly identified as the song of the "Cock-Bird" of his species, became a symbol of orgasmic sexual pleasure as often as of divine rapture.39 Perhaps the most famous early modern English example of this sort is Shakespeare's seductive image from Romeo and Juliet of the nightingale singing in a pomegranate tree, in which Juliet describes to her beloved the bird identified with the male organ singing against a rounded fruit fril of glistening seeds and a tufted terminus.40 We see the same sort of image reversed in gender and graphically transformed into a sparrow, the avian most often associated with lechery, in John Bartlet's musical setting of five stanzas from George Gascoigne's "Of All the Birds That I Do Know." The poet had originally written "in prayse of a Gentlewoman, whose name was Phillip," and the setting subtly reinforces the idea of a lively and attractive plaything under superior mastery.41 As in many early seventeenth-century English lute songs, the vocal range of this one remains within a single oc- tave, and the declamation of its strophic text follows the particular rhythms of the language (Ex. 3). Bartlet divides the piece into two sections, opening in a bright G major as the narrator fondly describes the bird, and modu- lating to D major for a refrain that culminates in the creature's own utter- ances. The sparrow's ecstatic cries complete each stanza at the midpoint of the octave, the D pitch that cleverly serves at once as her tonic and her keeper's dominant. Her syllables are mere nonsense, her simple wild music grounded and given aesthetic interest by a rollicking accompaniment that follows a rather predictable but highly artificial series of modulations to return from the D major that opens her section to the G major of the Called the Naturall Historie (London: Adam Islip, 1601), 285-87; Rowland, Birds with Hu- man Souls, 106; and Kate Van Orden, "Sexual Discourse in the Parisian Chanson: A Libid- inous Aviary," this Journal 48 (1995): 2. 39.

Not unlike Butler's fanciful musical por- trait of his "Muses Birds," the vocalization of Bartlet's sparrow is melodi- cally and rhythmically static, introduced by a narrative text with greater melodic and rhythmic interest. She remains as musically simple and distant from her frame as possible within confinement. Yet she is gathered in and given context only by the skillful use of harmony, part writing, and a more highly developed aesthetic than that of her own voice. Again, we see the natural female musician bounded by the triumph of human intellect and</page><page sequence="24">24 Journal of the American Musicological Society artifice, transformed into a curious commodity for the enjoyment of the composer's species. Here, she becomes the tamed performer removed from her wild habitat and domesticated for the private pleasure of her keeper. Her D major is completely framed by his G, her artless twittering rendered truly musical only by the well-crafted harmony assigned to the performers' choice of lute, viol, orpharion, or other singers.42 Neither fully the sparrow elevated into human surroundings nor the woman reduced by her keeper to orgasmic chirping, the avian voice only realizes its musical potential through the composer's art. In the apt words of Francis Bacon, instructing the early modern engineer and natural philosopher, "Nature betrays her secrets more fiully when in the grip and under the pressure of art than when in enjoyment of her liberty."43 The same is clearly true for his musical con- temporaries such as Bartlet, whose clever ayre molds a wild creature of Nature to human desire through musical art. The Triumphs of Artifice Musical avian and lute confront each other quite differently in Richard Crashaw's Musicks Duell, usually considered an adaptation of a Latin poem of 1617 by Famiano Strada, but with some particularly striking parallels to a section of canto 7 of Giambattista Marino's lushly sensual L'Adone.44 The poem narrates the tale of competition between the most exquisite music of the natural world, again embodied in the nightingale, and the highest artifice of the lute.

Unlike Marino's poem, with its eroticized imagery of the manly little bird's seductive power and his bond with the lovesick lutenist, Crashaw's places his unstricken human musician and nightingale into complete and immediate adversity from which we know instantly that the former will emerge the victor. Crashaw's bird lacks the latent threat to auditory sense implicit in Marino's ravishing Italian equivalent, "la sirena de'boschi, il rosignuolo." Instead, the little English singer is a tidy domestic who merely serves as "The sweet inhabitant of each glad Tree, /Their Muse, their Syren, harmlesse Syren shee." Thus from Crashaw's opening lines her power to seduce and destroy is diminished.46 The nightingale imitates the lute's music, moves beyond it with her ex- traordinary range and skill, and the two performers become embroiled in a struggle for musical superiority. Both coax treble and bass from their instruments. Both evoke the sounds of all human instruments of music and arouse all passions, one by one, with mythic proportion. Each performs more movingly, more exquisitely, and with more virtuosity turn by turn, until the lute's music finally renders her mute: At length (after so long, so loud a strife Of all the strings, still breathing the best life Of blest variety attending on His fingers fairest revolution In many a sweet rise, many as sweet a fall) A full-mouth Diapason swallows all. This done, hee lists what shee would say to this, And shee although her Breath's late exercise Had dealt too roughly with her tender throate, Yet summons all her sweet powers for a Noate Alas! in vain! for while (sweet soule) shee tryes To measure all those wild diversities Of chatt'ring strings, by the small size of one, Poore simple voyce, rais'd in a Naturall Tone; Shee failes, and failing grieves, and grieving dyes.

Unlike Marino's little feathered stand-in for the tragic Adonis, she receives neither tears nor written epitaph from the player of the fatal instrument.48 Despite the highly erotic imagery and more subdued sexual metaphors retained in Crashaw's language, his work is not about transfigurative love and sacrifice as is Marino's. It is more nearly a sensualized fable of martial triumph. The English poem becomes a tale of dominance and superiority with faint echoes of Ovid's gentle Philomela, who had been forcibly si- lenced by the sword of her physically superior rapist. Crashaw's sweet woodland siren is indeed harmless, and the lute, epitome of human musical artifice and manufacture, most powerful. Charles Butler, in the music theory treatise published over a quarter cen- tury after he first transcribed his bees, emphasizes that the voice is a work of nature, while musical instruments are works of art.49 Although the con- servative Butler considers the voice to "far exceede all these woorks of Art," the more progressive Crashaw has his lutenist's fingers coax music from the depth of his mechanistic instrument while his inborn voice remains sensibly mute during this contest between Art and Nature.so0 The same fatal musical contest is recounted in a young gentlewoman's midcentury manuscript lute-tutor as an illustration of "the Enthusiasmes and Ravisments of the Lute" and the concomitant superiority of the divinely assisted "Art of man" over "the woonders of nature." Yet her lutenist is assigned no gender, and her nightingale is a cocky male. In this way, the female instrumentalist is subtly invited to share in a form of musical power that overcomes the in- nate shortcomings of her body and her traditional connection to the nat- ural world.51 Carolyn Merchant, in her seminal study of gender, ecology, and the scientific revolution, points out that this era of mechanical domi- nance over nature ushered in a new metaphor of the sort we see here in a musical context. "Rational control over nature, society, and the self was achieved by redefining reality itself through the new machine metaphor," she explains of the period in which Crashaw wrote his poem, and in which Nicholas Brady's Ode on St. Cecilia's Day, set by Henry Purcell, praised the saint's "wond'rous machine," the organ, at its culmination. "Moreover," continues Merchant, "as a conceptual framework, the mechanical order had associated with it a framework of values based on power."52 Here, we see the crafted musical apparatus, the artificial instrument, attain superiority over the spiritually activated voice. By this means we are further reminded that the human mechanical genius is the opposite of the passionate and the 48. Marino, L'Adone, 89. 49. Butler, The Princples of Musik, 95. 50. Ibid. 51.

The castrato's more naturalistic aesthetic paral- lel, too, had a place within this framework. Where his voice sang the praise of God in sacred service, the natural woman's voice was silenced as non- sensical or languorously seductive. Where he embodied the noble hero of the stage, she played the victim, trophy, chattel, or enchantress. Yet the audiences and composers maintained a particular fascination with, if not fetishization of, the female virtuoso singer, the tame siren or captive night- ingale whose soprano parts and operatic roles often suggested even the barest constraint of passionate excess by composer, instruments, or other singers. Nature and Culture, Women and Men As demonstrated overtly by Topsell, Boaistuau, and Crashaw, and perhaps more subtly by Butler's necessary translation of his queendom's transitory music into superior and everlasting human form, past thinkers who studied the visible world most often imposed culturally accepted dualities of qual- ity, gender, and hierarchy onto the world of nature. In the words of mod- ern biologist Bonnie B. Spanier: When scientists look to nature, they usually bring with them their socio- political beliefs about what is natural. ... Within the ubiquitous paradigm of binary gender and male superiority, scientists have, for example, used male designations to name any species, misidentified the largest bee in the hive as the King Bee, and undervalued female lions as hunters. Thus, in what is con- sidered scientifically objective biology, the male is clearly held up as the nor- mative sex, with the female as a deviation from the norm.54 From the earliest codifications of classical thought through twentieth- century philosophies of science, the Western imagination has not only gen- dered Nature female. It has often subsequently pitted her against the manly achievements of civilization and culture as we see done so wittily in Bart- let's and Butler's music. Culture has long served as the creative subject and finished object for man's aspirations, while raw nature has remained both 53.

Traces of such attitudes remain to this day, particularly in the foun- dations of the humanities and social sciences.57 Like Woman, cosmological Nature has thus traditionally consisted of what higher Reason left behind, the dank, physical pull of the earth and its wild creatures, heavy with the corruption of sensual knowledge and emotion. Even her very passions have been considered unhealable manifestations of her naturalness, while de- structive earthly phenomena have borne her metaphorical likeness. She generates imperfect, mortal, and often ungovernable products of the same faulty physical materials. Meanwhile Man, in a tribute to his Maker's clean creative capacities, builds order out of chaos with the powers of his mind. Women thus belong to nature in ways that men do not, and culture achieves its highest value as a triumph of manly artifice.58 Creativity and 55.

Such works most often imitate nature in ways that are clean, witty, pristine, and controlled, subsuming it tidily within the tech- nical triumph of artifice as in Butler's little Melissomelos. Such ideas circulated widely and in virtually every medium at the dawn of modernity, when the budding disciplines of experimental science and the tonal system in music offered two of many possible models for the control of unruly materials. Robert Fludd's mystical-alchemical "Mirror of the Whole of Nature and the Image of Art" (1617) stands in marked categorical contrast to Bacon's metaphorical vise to press the secrets from nature (Fig. 1). Yet the underlying idea that passive, wild Nature must be bound, delimited, and controlled for mankind's benefit remains the same. Here, Fludd presents her as a radiantly beautiful virgin, chained by her right wrist to the God for whom she serves as proximate minister over the corruptible, subcelestial world. The mystery of the Creator remains eso- terically embodied in the Word, familiar Nature in the form of sumptuous female flesh. Her exquisite body, offered to the viewer's prurient gaze in a way that God's abstract opacity is not, is described in the accompanying text as nourishing all creatures from her bosom, the true Sun on her breast, Moon on her belly, and her heart giving light to the stars and planets. Thus Fludd draws greatest attention to her sexual and emotional attributes.59 This highly eroticized being, we see and are told, has a helper, the Ape of Nature we call Art, whom she commands by another chain. We also see that she does not pull his chain short and taut with the strength and vigor with which her own is wrenched by God, and that he works industriously with both hands as she stands passively before all creation. Fludd explains that Art has not arisen directly from Nature, but from human ingenuity. This industrious simian figure holds dominion over improvement in the con- centric natural realms of the liberal arts, including music; of art supplanting nature in the animal realm, including apiculture; of art assisting nature in the vegetable realm; and of art correcting nature in the mineral realm.60 Thus is bounteous, fertile Nature controlled from two directions. Her supposed hierarchical inferior and imitator, Art, elevates her simple prod- ucts to their most useful and ingenious, as we have already seen in Butler's and Bartlet's music. Likewise, we learn elsewhere that Music is either the daughter of God and Nature, or a beautiful virgin fit to wed men's hearts and ears. We see further images of Nature, with whom music has a special 59. Robert Fludd, Utriusque cosmi maioris scilicet et minoris metaphysica, physica atque tech- nica, 2 vols.

Alternately pure and debased, beneficent and destructive, they remain objectively beyond the inherent moderation and perfection of manly experience.62 "Man seeks in woman the Other as Nature and as his fellow being," begins Simone de Beauvoir in one of the most famous observations of twentieth-century social thought and a summation of thou- sands of years of Western attitudes. "But we know what ambivalent feelings Nature inspires in man," she continues, and reminds us further that this highly feminine Nature is paradoxically both man's enemy and his ally: he exploits her but she crushes him, and she is both the source of his being and the realm that he subjugates to his will. She at once embodies that which opposes his spirit and the spirit itself, the finite, the whole, the supreme reality in which he is rooted and engendered as are animals and plants. In the end, woman sums her up in the mingling, conflicting forms of Mother, Wife, and Idea.63 It is no accident that women's traditional roles have been related to their physiological positions as "natural" beings, or that manly power springs most strongly from its greatest distance from feminine na- ture and "natural" femininity. At no point has this struggle for dominance from which spiritual and intellectual Man must emerge victorious been more vital than on the threshold of modernity. As European women lost their physical connec- tion to the holy Mother of God under the influence of the Reformation, and were persecuted in greater numbers as witches, they were considered increasingly prone to the same passion and violence as wild, uncontrollable Nature.64 Disorderly, sensual Nature was forced to submit to the questions and experimental techniques of the new science just as women remained subject to male authority. The cunning of science and the brute force of its machines revealed nature's secrets, their mission to exploit her cast in the language of male-dominated heterosexual conquest. Nowhere was this more true than in England.65 Just as humanistic disciplines in the West have been founded on the artificial and highly gendered distinction between nature and culture, early modernity particularly emphasized a social order 62.

The era's au- thorities likewise disproportionately circumscribed women's works within the similar inferiority and transience of popular culture.66 Anthony Gibson firmly grounds his learned treatise, A Woman's Worth, Defended Against all the Men in the World, on the early modern cultural tradition of inversion, through which women could be assigned imaginary power over men as a means of reinforcing or subverting the status quo. Significantly, the book devotes considerable space to both music and the natural world. Borrowing from the French Sieur de Faucheron on whose similar work his own is based, Gibson uses the rhetorical technique of paradox to vindicate women of the evils most often credited to them.67 In so doing, the author sometimes includes double paradoxes whose topsy- turvy logic reverses itself at midpoint, returning the careful reader to the very argument he was attempting to refute. The result is a work that, more often than not, appears at first glance to be curiously progressive in its at- titudes toward women. But in the end it rests firmly on a bed of traditional misogyny. Gibson's work considers divine and mortal women in as many contexts as possible within the natural, human, and vanished golden worlds, of which the arts represent a significant number. Its substantial musical por- tion opens with a statement that women's voices are naturally harmoni- ous.68 Female musicians are therefore immediately circumscribed within the primal, uncontrolled world of nature where scientific and philosophical systems of classification had placed all of their gender since the days of Aristotle. Furthermore, the author's subsequent emphasis on wild, elemen- tal female musicians who are neither human nor animal, and on mysteri- ously learned women with unfathomable musical secrets, evokes the primal Western myths of the fantastical bird-women, sirens, shamanesses, and wild nymphs who discovered music at the intersection between savagery and civilization. From this dreamlike, half-forgotten state, music remained to be perfected by men both mortal and divine.69 Women and beasts are 66.

And music is a libidinal product of body until prop- erly controlled by manly restraint.70 Gibson of course reiterates the familiar commonplace that men first learned music from birds. But according to his account, which invokes the authority of the great Caesar, women had initially been taught music by the gods. "Men's tunes were learnde from the Birdes chattering on trees," he assures us, "but the voice of women came from the Gods themselves."7' In keeping with the author's overt intent and with the work's general tone of inversion and misrule, women are thus paradoxically granted the impossible: a divinely privileged superiority to men. A careful reading of Gibson's flawless rhetoric and brilliantly counterintuitive logic, however, ultimately leads to the conclusion that women must therefore have shared the same divine "master musicians" as the "Birdes chattering on trees." These winged creatures later imparted their simple art to the men who perfected it. In case his point is at all unclear to the reader, Gibson intro- duces the fantastical tale of how Alexander the Great discovered a myste- rious woman in the exotic East who "could accommodate the varieties of her voice, to the severall noates of all kindes of birdes, and that with such exceeding dexteritie, as theye which sawe her not, could make no difference from the verye thing it selfe."72 Eve's descendants thus join other witless noisemakers, leaving only men to have progressed beyond their incompre- hensible avian preceptors. By linking women at once to the divine realm, from which they have obviously fallen, and the natural, Gibson renders them even more alien to the intermediary world of men. The topos of the mysterious natural woman musician, whose primal powers are closer in all senses to beasts' or gods' than to men's, becomes a unifying subtext throughout Gibson's discussion of music and musicians. Within Gibson's binary system of opposition, women's music belongs to the same instinctual realm as that of beasts, whereas men's is enduring artifice that needs to be trained with care. To thinkers of Gibson's era, as Foucault explains, the voice itself was "merely the female part of language," stripped of all the intellectual power of the written word and the proper masculine key to esoteric discourse.73 As The Praise ofMusicke notes, music 70.

Gilbert and Susan Gubar, No Man's Land: The Place</page><page sequence="34">34 Journal of the American Musicological Society reaches its most sublime only when it progresses beyond nature to art, as indeed Butler demonstrates so beautifully with his melissomelos.74 There- fore, in defending the primeval power of women's voices, Gibson subtly reminds his readers of their inferior status in the grand scheme of things, in which a woman's voice in the original Garden had cost Man his im- mortality, and in which the most enduring verbal expressions emerge from manly artifice. For the early modern English thinker, such simple vocal musicality re- emphasizes the widespread idea that women's oral communication was considered inherently metalinguistic, beyond or estranged from the ratio- nal intellectual aspects of true language.75 Even removed from the world of paradox and mind-play, women's voices and innate musicality occupied the strange spaces beyond and between ordinary masculine art and dis- course. William Austin, in his earnest defense of women, HaecHomo ('This She-Man"), recalls the commonplaces behind Gibson's biting satire by reiterating that women's natural skill in music, "especiall in voyce," is so far superior to men's "that all they are said but to Faine, that seeke to imitate it."76 Without the need to double back on his own clever logic, Austin not only informs his readers of women's commonality with birds as sources of musical pleasure to men. He emphasizes their particular position be- tween vocal sense and nonsense in their role as teachers of language to pre-rational infants. "For from their voyce men learne to frame their owne," he explains, "to be understood of others. For in our infancy, we learn our language from them. Which men (therein not ingratefull) have justly termed our Mother tongue.'"" Again, women's vocality, reaching from the pre-rationality of infantile utterance to a "skill inMusicke" that reflects their "modesty, gentlenesse, and sweetnesse," remains to be perfected and rendered most comprehensible and practically useful by adult men.78 Feminine lan- guage is an unformed, incomplete discourse, just as women's bodies fall short of masculine physical perfection.

Mary herself served as a vital link between the principle of divine transcendence and the fallen natural world, but yet remained a passive principle in the miracle of redemption. The incorrupt- ible earthly body within which the ultimate Word was made flesh, she is likened to a heavenly nightingale in Henry Hawkins's devotional Caroline emblem book, Parthenia Sacra, one of the most important English Catholic recusant works of the seventeenth century. Hawkins's lush fusion of sym- bolic imagery and the sensuously meditative language of the Counter- Reformation emphasizes allegorical transformations of the Virgin against the background of "this great rich Magazin of nature."79 Now a blooming flower, now a singing bird, gushing fountain, or some other spiritually eroticized facet of the physical world, Hawkins's protean Mary belongs fully to an ancient tradition connecting the Mother of God to all the fertile bounties of the earth and to the early modern view of Nature as benevolent mother.80 Within "the mysterious and delicious garden" of the work, Mary serves as the ultimate reminder of Beauvoir's observation that, in the West- ern tradition, woman is remolded nearer to man's desire the more highly developed Nature is within her, and the more rigorously it is confined.8' The ideal woman, the untouched Mother of God, incorporates all benef- icent, luminous, life-affirming aspects of the natural world, perfectly con- fined and controlled by divine grace. The musical section of the book, spun out from the naturalistic image of the nightingale perched on the Marian symbol of an oak branch (Fig. 2), emphasizes that early modem aesthetic reception had as much to do with mind as body. It remained a process through which the internal faculties of reason received external informa- tion through bodily processes ultimately governed by "the Powers and Faculties of the Soule."82 Sound and its highest representation in music become particularly appropriate to the Mother within whose body the im- material became corporeal when we recall that, as Bacon explains, sound is "one of the most Hidden Portions of Nature ...

The bird is consequently rendered a particularly apt emblem for Mary in an era that delighted in multiple levels of metaphor, and allegories of allegories.84 As Hawkins shows, the avian harmony of Nature merely reflected pure spiritual harmony, in which it is God who plays the human instruments he tunes, and in which the soul truly magnifies the Lord through its pure, inaudible song.85 Hawkins first presents the earthly avian as ingenious artificer, first masculine, then feminine, "tuning a 1000 Canzonets, and sweetly cutting the ayre with repetitio[n] of a hundred thousand," merrier than a Parisian composer of branles, more intellectual than any composer of motets, and more melancholy than "Dowland himself" in "al his Plaints and Lachry- mies." The little bird, singing most sweetly through the darkest moments of Nature's deepest silence, is capable of extraordinary power and virtuos- ity, he explains. Not unlike Boaistuau and Crashaw, he attributes to her the sound of all instruments, "a thousand Quiristers, and as manie Violins," and all four voice-parts in her ceaseless song. She is a true wonder whose tiny body houses a powerful, sweet singing soul as she harmonizes with the 83. Bacon, Sylva Sylvarum, 63. 84. Hawkins, Parthenia Sacra, 142. 85.

"Whence so artificious and so perfect a knowledge of musick, so in- genious a modulation, so gratful a tone to the eares[?]" asks the author in wonder at this exquisite creature of eternal spring. But the soul lies far beyond the ears, and even her midnight vigil over the most fertile aspects of the natural world cannot bring her to perfection, unlike one peerless holy virgin, the nightingale of God. Hawkins positions Mary's pure, spiritual voice not only above this little avian's, but far beyond the merely mortal musics of Orpheus, Amphion, Arion, and even the no less legendary Orlando di Lasso and Luca Maren- zio.86 By elevating the Virgin above the earthly nightingale, the author cleverly disconnects her from the tradition in which the tiny nocturnal singer emblematized the woman of fleshly pleasure, reminding the reader instead of the bird's symbolic association with the soul, self-sacrifice, and the greatest love of all. She is not stuck with a phallic "prick" like her pro- fane homologue, but wounded by a thorn that pricks her heart as she sings alleluias among angels.87 She is similarly beyond the compound horrors of Ovid's hapless Philomela, who was given her song of darkness only after great violence, mutilation, and revenge. The incomparable Blessed Virgin, Hawkins tells us, simply serves as a glorious conduit for the unaltered harmony of heaven. Her entire being, untouched, unresisting, noninteractive, functions as a perfect instrument for magnification of the Lord. In comparison to Mary's exquisite voice with its eternally concordant song of divine grace, the earthly nightingale is but a babbler.88 The uncontrolled sensuality of Boaistuau's enchanting warbler belongs to an inferior, graceless state removed from holiness. Like Gibson's natural women, Hawkins's heavenly nightingale-virgin has been given her melodious message directly by God, who had also once created the incomprehensible little singer of terrestrial treetops. The comparison between the Blessed Mother and the sylvan singer serves as a subtle re- minder that, were it not for the intervention of God at the point of original sin in her creation, Mary would, like an ordinary woman, be but another earthbound babbler whose seemingly pleasant voice lacked reason, order, or true spiritual harmony. Hawkins closes his avian tribute to the Blessed Virgin by reemphasizing this very point with an evocation of Eve as dis- obedient nightingale, expelled from paradise to mourn like the tragic Phil- omela of classical mythology, redeemed only when her Maker beheld a properly "servile Mayd," a "Nightingale with an exulting strain" (Fig. 3). 86.

They apparently recognized what Claude LIvi-Strauss and his successors have pointed out: music and myth, sometimes consid- ered related discursive forms and similar cultural constructs, could similarly mediate between the mundane and the transcendent, the past and the present.89 More recent historians of science and culture have discovered the same of the seamless blend between myth and natural history, where in the West the exuberant hybrid beings on the margins between untamed and civilized space are so often musical, and where gender plays such a central role. "Myths," explains historian of science Ludmilla Jordanova, are ever-present exemplifications of beliefs so deeply entrenched that enquir- ing about their origins seems fruitless. Although myths can be vehicles of ideologies, they are much more than this, in that, as stories about human doings, they are overtly powerful and emotionally dense. ... myths are per- petually put to work in different, historically shifting ways.90 Just as nature often blended into myth by way of the multifaceted ex- egetical traditions of the late Renaissance and early Baroque, myth, in turn, shaded into history, as Hawkins's linkage of Lasso and Marenzio with the greatest musicians of antiquity implies. To the early modern mind, natural history, natural philosophy, humane learning, and the speculative realm of mythico-religious thought were not always as separable as they have since become. The same hermeneutics, based on the metamorphic nature of di- vinely given signs, influenced nearly all areas of intellectual inquiry.91 This sort of thinking, which gradually died out during the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, further blurred lines between intellectual disciplines 89.

According to early modern English thinkers, these individuals tend to be the most subtle, brilliant polymaths of the past. They are such powerful figures as Tubalcain, Mercury, and Pythagoras, also associated with other precise forms of knowledge that bridge the arcane and the practical.93 They were at once considered mu- sicians, technicians, philosophers, and rhetoricians, founders of the civi- lized arts. Theirs was the ordered science of music that first elevated humanity above primeval chaos and brutality, and which, on a metaphor- ical level, extended to the harmonious unity of the body politic. As Thomas Cooper defines Amphion in his Latin-English dictionary, "Amphion. A man which with naturall eloquence, brought rude and wilde people to a civile form of living. And (as some suppose) first found harmony."94 Sir Philip Sidney links Linus and Orpheus to Amphion in this regard, further explaining that not only did the first two devise the pen, the means through which sounds become enduring ideas, but all three drew people "with their charming sweetnese the wild untamed wits to an admonition of knowledge."95 Again, learned men dominate wild, untamed elements through their mas- tery of music and its intersection with language. Even such "natural elo- quence" as Cooper attributes to Amphion is pressed beyond Nature into the service of culture. Such positive musical influence over the savagery and inferiority of un- tamed, corruptible Nature was most often considered a male prerogative. The manly personifications of civilized virtues were, as in the modern But- ler or Bartlet, given greater license to recast the songs of the elements into enduring form for the benefit of themselves and their votaries. The only major classical goddess to whom musical invention was ascribed in any English source, for example, was Minerva, the virginal personification of wisdom, born of the head of her heavenly father. Yet her music is clearly 92. See Peter Burke, The Renaissance Sense of the Past (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1970), 105; Arthur B.

She was considered inventress of flute, pipe, or recorder, a rude instrument closer to its natural state than the heav- enly harp of Apollo or the perfect lute of the industrious Mercury. As any schoolboy knew, where Apollo governed the seven planets with the seven strings of his harp or lyre, and Mercury inspired superhuman diligence with his lute, Minerva had cast away and cursed her impractical pipe for distorting the performer's visage. The instrument later was not only repu- diated by her own city of Athens, but also became associated with the beastly Pan, the tragically foolish Marsyas, and the libidinal Bacchus and his wild followers.96 English philosophers and philologists regarded the classical muses as passive conduits for divine male order and creative energy. These nine demi-goddesses awaited the intellectual touch of masculinity to bring them fully into the creative service of human achievement. They were allegorical embodiments of the Western tradition of reading Woman's procreative as- pect as a male-assisted creative ability. As with Mary, the inward harmony that was often represented as musical activity thus depended on complete submission to the higher male power that would spark gestation of his ideas and thus bring them to fruition. Seventeenth-century classical phi- lologist George Sandys, for instance, explains that the gender of these symbolic figures arises out of the analogical extension between women's procreative capacity and men's intellectual creativity. The muses, he tells us simply, "are said to be women, in regard of the pregnancy of knowl- edge.""97 The influential late Renaissance mythographer Vincenzo Cartari 96.

He adds that they were simply "framed unto young virgines of beauteous and youthfull aspect, habited as wandering and silvane Nimphs, with diverse- shaped instruments in their hands, melodiously playing and with a soule- ravishing touch continually playing: and from these all the liberall sciences acknowledge their being."98 Thus the nine muses attain separation from the wild, uncivilized cries of feminine Nature. They have merely been given the superficial appearance of exquisite woodland demi-goddesses, claims Cartari. They ravish the soul, rather than the flesh, properly, decorously, and in the name of the civilized arts, with artificial instruments spilling from their open mouths in place of natural voices.99 Apollo himself, as famous for his erotic exploits with favorites of both sexes as for his more intellectual pursuits, was not merely the mentor and conductor of the harmonious muses. According to many of those who placed the muses under his watchful guidance, his was a higher, more ab- stract music, and a more directly constructive influence on the created uni- verse, preventing, as one seventeenth-century English sage explained, the metaphorical dissolution of Nature's harmony into dissonance.'00 Apollo thus stood as order personified, enemy and opposition to chaos and dark- ness. As Thomas Cooper explains him to those English readers who would learn brief, useful tags from Latin culture, "Apollo ... is counted God of musike, phisike, poetrie, and shooting: and hath by Poets given him a triple name and power. In heaven he is called Sol, in earth Liber pater, in hell Apollo. Heflourisheth alwaye with perpetuall youth."'0' In short, he not only united all things harmonious into a single allegorical personage, but be- came the powerful, ordered link between the complexities of the earthly realm and the over- and underworlds. The intellectual divisions between didactic moral tales of ancient musi- cians and the modern biographies of literate art-composers were no more clear-cut than between natural and allegorical practitioners of the practical 98.

From theoretical and philosophical per- spectives, the fact that ancient musicians left no evident means to reproduce their music remained less important than their exemplary ability to dom- inate the unruly aspects of Nature and humanity. The legendary Arion, for instance, who particularly captured the imagination of a seagoing people, epitomized the man whose ordered, artificial music tamed the unruly ele- ments and brought wild sea creatures under human influence. He was most frequently portrayed as a virtuous professional musician, often under royal patronage, whose harp or lyre captured the hearts and moved the spirits of all but the most murderous creatures of earth and sea. His was an almost Orphic power to restore order, harmony, and proper human mastery over both the natural world and the criminal impulse.'02 In contrast, by demot- ing the musical portions of the Catholic mass to a superstitious cater- wauling of felines in four-part disharmony, the satiric prose writer William Baldwin furthered Reformation propaganda through his sly linkage be- tween the Roman liturgy and the incomplete, incomprehensible, and purely temporal songs of savage beasts. Participants in such twilight gath- erings merely turn from the divine world of ordered harmony to the wild cries of nature and its filthy leavings.103 Such diverse writers as Hawkins, the encyclopedic polymath Francis Meres, and courtesy writer Henry Peacham the Younger additionally emphasize that legendary greatness and musical genius knew no temporal boundaries. In their writings they celebrated the power and immortality of the greatest musicians, who transformed music, musical culture, or the arts in general, and moved the listener beyond the gross limits of the physical world. Accordingly, the names and musical achievements of Orpheus, David, Henry VIII, Alphonso Ferrabosco, and Claudio Monteverdi were all considered worth knowing, even if the music of only two of them re- mained available for modern audiences and performers. The highly artifi- cial works of all these seminal art-musicians were civilizing influences, the ultimate forms of order, mastery, and domination over earthly chaos. Like lengthy biblical lists of foreign names associated with great deeds, which had been upheld by the famous and were still to be emulated, even com- monplace books went from miraculous masters of past music to their mod- ern heirs. "As Greece has these excellent Musitians," begins Meres, mixing figures from what we would classify as myth, legend, and history, Arion Doceus, Timotheus Melesius, Chrysogonus, Terpander, Lesbius, Simon Magnesius, Philamon, Linus, Stratonicus, Aristonus, Chiron, Achilles, Clinias, 102.

Thomas Mud, sometimes fellow of Pembrooke Hal in Cambridge, M. Edward Johnson, Master Blankes, Master Randall, Master Philips, Master Dowland, and Master Morley. 104 For a writer like Meres, the ability to render aesthetic judgment remains unimportant, and all that matters is the reported greatness of human mem- ory, yesterday or today. The implication is obvious: through the enduring, notated music of such composers as Taverner, Tye, Tallis, or Byrd, the modern performer or auditor could participate in the musical miracles of the past, and rise equally above mundane nature. Similarly, Peacham praises the legendary abilities of music to enhance the human spirit and quality of life by citing the most famous musicians of classical myth, the biblical David, the prophetess Miriam, the historical Sappho, and, on the authority of Erasmus, King Henry VIII of his own nation. Only then does he go on to English, German, Italian, and Spanish masters whose music he had actually seen, heard, and performed. Among these latter, in the same manner as Hawkins, Peacham promiscuously mixes assorted ancient Ro- mans, Macedonians, and the muses as his way of granting the highest au- thority to such modern men as Ferrabosco, Monteverdi, Morley, Rore, and Victoria.'05 The greatest ordered minds of music have inherited similar abilities to move the listener, even if media and styles may have altered. As these writers imply, musicians ranked among those early modern ar- tisans who occasionally rose to the status of courtier or higher, principally through patronage and the privileges it conferred.'06 Some of these same individuals achieved immortality through a cultural imagination that in- variably sought links between literal and allegorical, past and present, mundane and celestial. As Hawkins, Meres, and Peacham imply, the finest contemporary musicians metamorphosed into modern mythological fig- ures who embodied the art's perfection as well as their ancient forebears had. Some, such as John Johnson, lutenist to Queen Elizabeth, were ele- vated to the level of icons. In a unique manuscript copy of his Emblems, dedicated to the famous music lover and patron of the arts the earl of Leicester, Geoffrey Whitney immortalizes Johnson as Apollo's modern successor (Fig. 4). Whitney bor- rows the image from Andrea Alciati's widely circulating pan-European book of emblems, but has replaced the original epigram of "Foedera" or "Alliances" with the praise of modern music.

This sounding modern music with all of its aesthetic familiarity metamorphoses yet again into the realm of metaphor, transformed poetically into Apollo- nian order and the harmony of a vanished world. Thus does the reflexive leap from intellect to sensation reverberate back, uniting past and present, temporal and eternal, and the harmonies of body, body politic, and eter- nity. By likening Johnson to Apollo for the power and majesty of his lute playing, Whitney raises his contemporary to mythic status and subtly praises the harmonious power of his performance.08s Even as the accom- panying verse praises Johnson for the extraordinary lute playing that Apollo himself commends, the emblem replaces the long-vanished lyre with a five-course lute and open music book, turning the god into the mod- em English music best represented by Johnson. His instrument, like that of Crashaw's lutenist, speaks for him until it comes to embody all of his capacities, extending the eloquence of his voice and amplifying even the rhetorical gestures of his body. In greatest possible contrast to Hawkins's similarly metamorphic emblem of the nightingale-Mary, the royal lutenist literally becomes the sound of his instrument and the imprint of his nota- tion, playing laudable modern music eternally through the Apollonian realm. To an early modern English mind, his lute was as much a symbol of courtly male dominance and display as her nightingale was of feminine receptivity.'09 Where she serves as the epitome of feminine music, the ven- triloquized voice of God sounding from fertile earth to heaven, he becomes the perfect everlasting unity of masculine creativity and artifice. She perches in fleshly form on an acorn-encrusted branch, while his enduring instru- ment and the concrete product of his musical mind lie enthroned on plush cushion. Her body is the dainty feathered bird's, her instrument the voice of God coursing through her perfect little throat. His busy fingers have been assumed into the incorruptible lute that was their tool, his written notes enduring where hers decay with utterance. The circle from nature through allegory, mythology, history, and reli- gion to current human life reaches full closure with Peacham's reference to William Byrd as the rarest and most wondrous avian of all, the phoenix, ancient symbol of Christian faith and constancy, and as much the bird of Christ as the nightingale was of Mary."11 The Jacobean Protestant com- mentator further elevates the older Catholic composer to heavenly grace by 108.

Likewise, Lady Grace Sherrington Mildmay, a devout Puritan, explains in her memoirs that, as a young woman, she improvised five-part settings of psalms and prayers to her lute as an aspect of godly meditation. Here, she clearly demonstrates the Puritan belief that devout women retained a direct, pre-rational tie to God by serving, like Hawkins's Catholic Virgin, as a musical vehicle for his voice.112 To return to Ravenscroft's image of the literate art-music com- poser John Bennet as a musician gifted by nature or a higher source, it was the man who, like the allegorical Apollo, could perfect the hidden music of the natural world through human artifice and point the lowest entities of the natural realm toward the divinity that still left its mark on man whose music became immortal. Abstract In sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England, music was often consid- ered an aspect of natural philosophy, the general study of natural and cul- tural phenomena that had been inherited from classical antiquity and the Middle Ages, but was undergoing rapid metamorphosis into more modern fields of science, technology, and the arts. Against this background, many writers began to invoke machine metaphors and the triumph of cultural products over raw nature and Nature's corollaries in the form of women and animals. Older epistemologies of magic and metaphor, which had also incorporated gendered ideas of artifice, perfection, nature, and creation, informed these emerging ideas. The result on the one hand was a practice of secular musical composition that included sounds from the natural world as feminine novelties to be bounded and improved by stylistic arti- fice. On the other was a documentary allegorization of music that drew from chronicle history, mythology, natural science, religion, and politics to demonstrate the moral and aesthetic superiority of music and musicians that elevated natural elements into enduring musical artifice. 111.
