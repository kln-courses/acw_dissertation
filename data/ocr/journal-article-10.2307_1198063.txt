<plain_text><page sequence="1">RECENT BOOKS the essay. The appendixes, drawn principally from the Boswell Papers, have consider- able value for scholars, though these documents afford no more than an extremely limited insight into the larger aspects of the subject in hand.-W. K. JORDAN. STEWART, H. F. The Secret of Pascal. London: Cambridge University Press; New York: Macmillan, I94I. x+io8 pages. $I.25. In the three chapters of this book the author of The Holiness of Pascal (I915) returns to the great French thinker with increased intimacy and unchanged admiration. In the Provincial Letters Pascal is discovered to be a lover of truth and a careful logician as well, while his Jesuit opponents exemplify the generalization that "strict veracity, though a Christian, has not always been an ecclesiastical virtue." For Pascal, as a moralist, the antinomy of man's weakness and greatness is solved by reference to the Christian doctrine of nature and grace. He was an ascetic who, like a desert monk, "neglected the ordinary decencies" of personal cleanliness. Yet his social creed was "almost conventional," and he had "a Shakespearean contempt for the crowd." Stewart calls his third chapter "Pascal as Poet," but the reference is mainly to the warmth and vividness of his prose in the Pensees. The author illustrates this by comparison with passages from Arnauld and Descartes in which by contrast he finds a quality of "cold light." Alike in passages apparently unpremeditated and in those marked by laborious effort, Pascal is a rhetorician. He cultivates and appreciates the pleasure of eloquence and employs "all the devices of rhetoric." The real secret of his lasting appeal is that in his hands French prose became "the most perfect vehicle of lucid and persuasive speech since the days of Plato and Demosthenes." This is superlative language, surely, from a scholar of Dr. Stewart's attainments. Since Plato and Demosthenes there has been a good deal of "lucid and persuasive speech." At any rate, Dr. Stewart has followed his appreciation of Pascal's "holiness" with an admiring exposition of his literary genius.- JOHN T. MCNEILL. WHALE, J. S. Christian Doctrine.

The principal of Cheshunt College, Cambridge, writes with characteristic clarity and timeliness an introductory outline in eight chapters of the main articles of the Chris- tian faith.-E. E. AUBREY. WIEMAN, REGINA WESTCOTT. The Family Lives Its Religion. New York: Harper's I941. ix+236 pages. $2.00. The central drive of this stimulating book is "to show how the family can discover the way of God and secure the values of life found therein" (p. 49). How, then, may one discover the way of God within the family relationship? By means of "creative inter- action," says Mrs. Wieman. By creative interaction she denotes a mode of mutual fel- lowship within the family circle that results in the growth, modification, and enrichment of valuings. In this community of valuings, God is the "interweaving of our deepest and greatest interests." Phrased otherwise, "God is the Creativity of life which speaks to us through this creative interaction." On the basis of this conception of God, the author unfolds a fascinating picture of the way in which the family may live its religion. The wedding, for example, is conceived as but the initial event in a process of marriage that requires a lifetime for its fullest realiza- tion. At every moment in that process it is complete commitment to the "Creativity of God" that gives the fellowship of marriage its deepest meaning. With each new bond that is formed between husband and wife, with each richer valuing that takes place, God creatively reveals himself. 339</page><page sequence="2">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION In this matrix of spiritual, God-centered community, children absorb the values of the family and become partakers in the process of religious living. How to enrich appre- ciations, how to budget the family resources, how to balance freedom and discipline, how to have fun-these and other elements in a well-rounded family experience are treated with rare insight and skill. The principles and ideals discussed are rendered unusually vivid by numerous well- chosen illustrations drawn from actual family situations. The text also outlines some splendid procedures by which parent-groups may direct and evaluate their own religious living. All in all, the book makes a real contribution to our understanding of the basic problems of the modern home. In one important respect, however, the book seems to me to recommend a doubtful procedure. Since in her view little children are unable to "experience God directly," Mrs. Wieman believes that it is unwise for them to be encouraged to use the term God in their devotions (pp. II3, 197, 2II). Prayer, she says, "is a mature expe- rience," and therefore the child's petition should be addressed not to God but to his parents, who, as a sort of mediator, will seek to draw the child "into creative interaction with them" (p. 213). The child of this age will "remain absent from family prayers until he has a fair understanding of what God is and how He works in this world of ours" (p. 216). For him, the parents "should develop a number of nonreligious rituals"! Now that seems a strange conclusion for one who holds that God, the "Creativity of life," is real and present in every "creative interaction." To be sure, the child's possi- bilities of interaction are very limited, but there is no reason on that account for saying that he cannot be religious within the frame of his own experience and ability. And if the child is capable in some degree of religious response as a member of the family com- munity, then why deprive him of the use of the central category of faith-God? True enough, the child will likely envisage God in anthropomorphic terms, but that in itself will be no necessary handicap, except as those who nurture him fail to help him recon- struct his ideas of God in the process of further growth.-H. SHELTON SMITH. 340</page></plain_text>
