<plain_text><page sequence="1">Die Meissner Porzellantiere im 18. Jahrhundert. By Carl Albiker. 126 pp. + lxxxviii pl. Berlin (Deutscher Verein ffir Kunstwissenschaft). RM. 20. This book is very welcome as the first publication of the Verein to be devoted to original research on the sub- ject of German porcelain. Professor von Falke's general survey of the porcelain figures, published ten years ago, has remained until now the only contribution made by the Society to the study of this characteristically German branch of art. The book is a comprehensive survey, including eques- trian figures and even those works (such as the Swan Service) in which animal motifs are used only incident- ally. The separate treatment of this subdivision of the subject of Meissen figures is perhaps justified by the interest taken in animals at that time, an interest which gives the whole group a characteristic Baroque flavour. The title naturally calls to mind first of all the large figures of animals made for the Japanese Palace in Dresden for Augustus the Strong, and a large part of Dr. Albiker's valuable Introduction is devoted to a dis- cussion of the relative merits of the two modellers, Gottlob Kirchner and Johann Joachim Kaendler, who were chiefly responsible for these. The reputation of the latter is now like all long-established reputations commonly the subject of critical abuse, and it has become the fashion to praise the work of his predecessors at his expense. Dr. Albiker is at pains to show how profoundly the two artists differed in their aesthetic of sculpture. Kirchner's outlook was a survival of the medieval one by which an animal was the symbol or embodiment of a virtue or a vice, or a mere myth, something more or less anthropomorphic; the technique of working out such concepts in sculpture naturally stressed a life which gave form from within, in which external details mattered little. Kaendler, on the other hand, belonged to the modern world; his work was based on the observation of natural species, and according to Dr. Albiker he worked from externals inwards, making truth to nature his chief concern. Stated in this way the superiority of the former attitude is, of course, indis- putable ; a work of creative art must be superior to a mere copy of the literal facts of appearance. But this is not to state the case fairly. It is not a case of the rela- tive merits of two conceptions of sculpture, but of two sculptors working in different modes. The earlier mode may be more favourable to creative work; the latter may produce a merely dull naturalism. But artists remain of the same stature whatever the prevailing mode may be, and this aspect of the matter is commonly overlooked by the partisans of Kirchner and Kaendler. Kirchner was an indifferent modeller with a very un- certain feeling for mass, profile and movement; his use of porcelain was timid and he was unaware of the significance of glaze. The freedom allowed by his con- ception of sculpture availed him not at all. Kaendler, on the other hand, though tied by the prevailing " scientific " notions to a literal fidelity to the facts, was so gifted as a sculptor that his figures achieve a life 237</page><page sequence="2">The Literature of Art of their own, a vitality that is independent of mere naturalism and is, indeed, often obscured by it. This sculptural vitality is evident enough from the admirably reproduced photographs in this book. Not only the Japanese Palace animals, but the long series of smaller figures, notably dogs and birds, modelled by Kaendler in the course of the four and a half decades of his activity at the Meissen factory, are evidence enough of his rank as a creative artist. The book is valuable for its wealth of information regarding the names of modellers and the dates of modelling obtained from the factory archives ; in dealing with these Dr. Albiker has had the advantage of help from Professor Erich H6sel, himself a modeller of animals at the factory and a devoted student of its records. Information is lacking only for the period 1748-63, for which the archives were destroyed in the Seven Years War. Much of this information is newly pub- lished and may considerably alter received opinions about certain famous works. Thus (for instance) the beautiful Nereid in the Swan Service, for long ascribed to Eberlein, is now put down to Kaendler himself. The dates and ascriptions cannot however be accepted without some reserve. Thus the odious Monkey Band is now stated to have been modelled by Kaendler and Reinicke between August 1765 and February 1766. But some of the set were copied at Chelsea and offered in the sale catalogue of March I756. Perhaps the work done in 1765 was in preparation for a re-issue of the models. They must have appeared earlier; it is inconceivable that they originated at Chelsea and were copied at Meissen. Another unsolved problem not discussed by Dr. Albiker is created by the record of the traveller J. G. Keyssler, who visited Dresden in October 1730 and saw some Meissen porcelain animals actually in the Japanese Palace ; but only one original model is now ascribed to a period before 1731. w. B.
