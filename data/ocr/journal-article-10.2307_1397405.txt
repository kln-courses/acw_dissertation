<plain_text><page sequence="1">A. L. HERMAN Indian Art and Levels of Meaning' THE PURPosE OF this paper can be stated quite briefly: to raise the question as to whether the discipline of Indian aesthetics can be analyzed by the metalanguage of semiotic (the general theory of signs); or, more precisely, can a particular theory of Indian art, which we will define, be discussed, analyzed, or described in terms of the language of semiotic? The paper is divided into two parts. Each part undertakes to ask a specific question and to supply a specific answer. The first question is, "What is Indian aesthetics ?" and, precisely, "What is the nature of the sign-system of that discipline?" The second question is, "Are the sign processes of Indian aesthetics related to semiotic and, if so, in what manner ?" In essence, then, we are going to talk about the relationship of two metalanguages: Indian aesthetics and semiotic. By "Indian aesthetics" we will mean that language which discourses upon the object language of Indian art, and particularly that discourse concerned with the meaning and interpretation of works of Indian art. "Art" can be subdivided into sacred and profane art, or hieratic and secular art, or magic and amusement art.2 These two kinds of art can be further defined within the context of a particular cultural tradition. That is, we will define sacred art in terms of "traditionalism," and then claim that all other art which is not of this tradition is secular, or profane, or amusement art.3 Sacred art is defined only 1 Grateful acknowledgment is made to Charles Morris for a number of helpful criti- cisms of this paper. 2Reference may be made to a similar terminology in R. G. Collingwood's The Prin- ciples of Art (Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1938), Parts IV and V, where Collingwood discusses "Art as Magic" (our "sacred art" with some modifications) and "Art as Amusement" (our "secular art" with further modifications). Collingwood's "Art as Representation" (Part III) and "Art as Imagination" (Part VII) may also apply to secular and sacred art, respectively, but for our purposes "Art as Magic" and "Art as Amusement" illustrate adequately enough the kind of delineation we are proposing. 3 On another level, this dichotomy is false and misleading unless one keeps in mind that there is no antagonism between these two kinds of art, as most Western critics might assume. That "other level" is the level of the traditional way of regarding kinds of art, that is, art in a "traditional" culture. Stella Kramrisch says of such a dichotomy: "The 13</page><page sequence="2">14 A. L. HERMAN within the tradition from which it grows and in which it has its being and significance; and the subject matter of that art is God; i.e., sacred art is about Brahman or the Divine Ground in some form or other of its being. We might refer to such art as "transcendental." "Aesthetics" can be delineated according to a schema borrowed, in part, from Harold Osborne. Osborne notes four kinds of aesthetic theories, of which the last, transcendentalism, will be discussed more fully later. These four theories are as follows: 1. Naive Emotionalism W Se W/ is the work of art Se/ is the emotion aroused in the spectator The excellence of the work of art is assessed by either (1) the agreeableness, or (2) the intensity of the emotion aroused by it in the spectator. 2. Expressionism AE WEe- Se AE/ is the emotion experienced by the artist WEe/ is the work of art embodying the artist's emotion, together with the emotion the viewer will experience Se/ is the duplicate of the artist's emotion aroused in the spectator The success of a work of art is judged in terms of the similarity be- tween AE and Se. The value of the work of art is judged in terms of the moral rating accorded to the duplicated emotion Ee (the artist's emotion and the viewer's emotion). 3. Transcendentalism Traditional transcendentalism (the use of "traditional" here is far different from the term "traditional" we shall employ later, and it should be noted we are merely following Osborne's own concepts here) as it is usually advocated is represented diagramatically as follows : art of India is neither religious nor secular, for the consistent fabric of Indian life was never rent by the Western dichotomy of religious belief and worldly practice." The Art of India (New York: Phaidon Publishers, Inc., 1954), p. 10. It will be necessary to keep the above statement in mind when interpreting what we are saying about sacred and secular art: Distinction does not mean opposition.</page><page sequence="3">MEANING IN INDIAN ART 15 AER WEe SeR R/ is the real essence AER/ is the artist's emotion which mediates knowledge-by-acquaintance of R WEe/ is the work of art embodying the artist's emotion, and the viewer's emotion SeR/ is the duplicate of the artist's emotion in the spectator, mediating to the spectator knowledge-by-acquaintance of R The excellence of any work of art is judged by the extent to which the spectator achieves--or feels that he achieves--a revelation of ultimate reality through contemplation of the work of art. 4. Transcendentalism (cont'd) Refined transcendentalism is represented as follows: AER SeR AER/ is the sign for the work of art which arouses in the artist an emotion which mediates to him knowledge-by-acquaintance of ultimate reality SeR/ is the sign for the work's arousing in the spectator a similar emotion which mediates to him also knowledge-by-acquaintance of ultimate reality The excellence of the work of art is judged by the extent to which the artist or the spectator achieves---or feels that he achieves-a revela- tion of ultimate reality through contemplation of the work of art.4 Our criticism of Osborne's system, as here presented, rests upon his rather naive (and undefined) use of "emotion" in all cases of profane as well as sacred art. "Emotion" cannot be accepted as an adequate concept to describe the inner condition of the artist or the spectator in both hieratic and secular art. Both "E" and "e" would have to be refined in some sense, certainly, in order to be at all usable in the Indian theory of aesthetics. Consequently, we will employ the following schema to define a fifth possible aesthetic theory (a 4 Harold Osborne, Aesthetics and Criticism (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1955), pp. 200-201, with modifications.</page><page sequence="4">16 A. L. HERMAN kind of "refined" refined-transcendentalism, if that is possible). We will call this "Indian traditionalism." It would schematize somewhat as follows: Brahman (1) (4 (4) Sacred Artist Worshipper Work (3) Unlike Osborne's schema, "Indian traditionalism" makes no mention of emotion, and what signs it does employ and what reactions (interpretants) it conjures up we shall discuss shortly. Further, the schema of "Indian tradition- alism," by exhibiting two sets of double arrows between the "sacred artist" and "work" (artifact), on the one hand, and between the "sacred artist" and "Brah- man," on the other, indicates or signifies the process of creativity arid the direction of movement of that creativity. In addition, the schema illustrates that this creativity is a relationship in time in terms of priority between the artist and the artifact and the artifact and the artist, and also a similar relation- ship obtains (though whether this is a temporally describable one or not is, or at least has been, debatable) between Brahman and the artist and vice versa, in the following order: (1) Brahman inspires the artist in some manner through some kind of sign process. (2) The artist embodies the sign in the artifact. (3) The artist then views the work of art and tests it in this final form, (4) by determining whether it "reminds" him of Brahman (the termi- nology seems excessively cumbersome at times) and is the proper sign vehicle for this "recognition." In the same manner the worshipper repeats only the latter set of relations, (3) and (4), in which the sign in the artifact signifies Brahman. Ananda K. Coomaraswamy seems to be saying something like this when he states : The maker of an icon, having by various means proper to the practice of yoga eliminated the distracting influences of fugitive emotions and creature images, self- willing and self-thinking, proceeds to visualize the form of the devatd, angel or aspect of God, described in a given canonical prescription, sadhana, mantram, dhydna. The mind "pro-duces" or "draws" (akarsati) this form to itself, as though from a great distance. Ultimately, that is, from Heaven, where the types of art exist in formal operations;... the form thus known in an act of non-differentiation, being held in view as long as may be necessary, is the model from which he proceeds to execution in stone, pigment or other material.5 5 The Transformation of Nature in Art (New York: Dover Publications, 1956), pp.</page><page sequence="5">MEANING IN INDIAN ART 17 The relation of the artist to the artifact and to Brahman is described in quite similar terms by Benjamin Rowland, and the relation of the artist to his traditional culture is borne out by the phrase below ". .. the artist already knows from experience...": In Indian art-practice the artist is enjoined to become one with the object to be portrayed in a self-induced state of trance. It is then that the image of the deity appears as a reflexion in his mind, conditioned, of course, by those forms and canons which the artist already knows by experience. In fashioning his icon from the mental image the artist employs that most ancient of Indian philosophical sciences: the method of yoga or ecstatic meditation.6 It seems entirely possible that a similar rigorous training is needed for the viewer or worshipper, if he too is to "make use of" the icon as the sacred artist intends it to be used. Again, the cultural tradition must supply this background of "conditioned" experiences or rules, if that intention is to be realized even in the worshipper, and the importance of such a tradition cannot be stressed too much.7 The tradition provides the vocation for the artist and the occasion 5-6. See also pp. 174-177, where Coomaraswamy develops the Western parallel to this theory of "in-spiration." 6 The Art and Architecture of India (London: Penguin Books, 1954), p. 8. 7 We ought to say something at this point about the use of the term "tradition," as it is employed throughout this paper. Rene Gu&amp;non says of the "traditional culture": "We have just seen that in civilizations of a traditional character, intellectual intuition lies at the root of everything; in other words, it is the pure metaphysical doctrine that is es- sential, and all else is connected with it, either consequently or by way of application to the various orders of contingent reality. Not only is this true of social institutions but also of the sciences, that is to say of knowledge bearing on the domain of the relative, knowledge which, in such civilizations, cannot be regarded otherwise than as a mere de- pendency and as a sort of prolongation or reflection of absolute or principal knowledge. Thus a true hierarchy is always and everywhere preserved." The Crisis of the Modern World, A. Osborne, trans. (London: Luzac and Co., 1943), p. 61; cf.

(London: Luzac and Co., 1953), passim. Stella Kram- risch is apparently referring to such a traditional hierarchy when she says: "Every aspect of this [Indian] life is incorporated into a known hierarchy of values in the physical, psychological and metaphysical realms. In this ordered body of values, each member with its own particular function is placed in accordance with a transcendental Norm." Op. cit. p. 10. Marco Pallis in Peaks and Lamas (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1949), which book, he claims, has for its subject the ". . . contrasts between two paths, the path of Tradition and the path of those who have cut themselves adrift from Tradition" (p. 394), defines "tradition" as follows: "... an effective communication of principles of more- than-human origin, whether indirectly and at several removes, through use of the forms that will have arisen by applying those principles to contingent needs, or else immediately, after an 'exhausting' of whatever makes for formal restrictions of any kind, including the human individuality itself" (p. 323). Pallis then remarks of the opposite, non-tradi- tional culture: "A traditionless existence, whether for a single individual or a whole group, is one in which the presence of the Bodhisattva passes unnoticed, in which the naldjorpa [meaning "obtainer of tranquillity," according to Pallis] is without honor, in</page><page sequence="6">18 A. L. HERMAN for the viewer: the artist's purpose is defined in terms of his vocation, or sacred calling, through or by means of the tradition. The subject matter of the artifact is prescribed in terms of the tradition insofar as the tradition dictates the one and proper goal for all members of the culture, and that goal here is moksa. Finally, the effect upon the viewer, in terms of expectations, meaning, inter- pretation, and function is precisely limited in the same sense by this tradition: In India, the ultimate aim of life is Release (moksa), and art is one means of at- taining this aim.8 ... Indian art, which art, be it remembered, is essentially re- ligious in content-i.e., not necessarily dogmatic, but always concerned with reali- ties... .' The purpose of Indian art, like all traditional art, is primarily to instruct men in the great first causes, which, according to the seers, govern the material, spiritual and celestial worlds.10 From the point of view of both the artist and the viewer, then, both persons become worshippers when they meditate on the work (cf. Osborne's items (3) and (4), above). According to the Upanisads, an act of worship is a non- naturalistic event in which the worshipper and that which is worshipped be- come identified in some sense. Thus the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad states: "So whoever worships another divinity believing 'He is one and I another,' he knows not."" Sacred art must somehow be explained in terms of this identification of worshipper (artist or viewer) and Brahman. The meaning of such identifi- cation will carry us into a discussion of sacred symbols and the artifact itself as a symbolic medium. Let us begin with the concept of sadt.rya. "Sa.rlya" means "visual or intellectual correspondence," or ". .. the condition of embracing in itself things of a manifold nature which are distinct which mankind, refusing to listen to any talk of self-abandonment, is abandoned to its own devices, as the very name of 'humanism' so obviously confesses" (p. 324). It is in this tradition that the individual is trained or "conditioned" for non-formal knowledge and the task that lies ahead.

And yet, strangely enough, it is the asser- tions of the Church on these very issues which become heterodox when compared to the greater orthodoxy of a more catholic tradition. An interesting aesthetic can be wrung from the Western mystical assertions, but, since this paper is concerned with Indian or at least non-Western aesthetics, we can but mention it here as "interesting," and then move on.</page><page sequence="7">MEANING IN INDIAN ART 19 from itself," or, more briefly, the condition of "identity in difference," as defined by the Nylya-Vaidesika.12 This "visual correspondence" is not appar- ently merely the relation between the individual thing imitated and the imitation (Brahman and the image of Brahman, for example), for the Hindus want to say that what is imitated is the idea or species of the thing ". .. by which it is known intellectually, rather than the substance of the thing as it is perceived by the senses."13 Thus Asian art as a whole, according to this theory, is not a matter of mere representationalism. A Chinese source states that the art work must reveal "... the operation of the spirit in life-movement" (Hsieh Ho) and "by means of natural shape represent divine spirit," just as for Thomas Aquinas art was an imitation of Nature in her manner of operation, natura naturans.14 This relation between the sign and the object signified will draw us now into a discussion of the nature of the sign language in Indian aesthetics. The Indian wants to employ seemingly non-natural categories in discussing his art, and we will have to come as close as the metalanguage will permit in delineating this object language. We will have to use a more familiar language than sIdrlya, or visual correspondence, between the object (Brah- man) and the imitation in the icon. What we are really looking for, it would seem, is a certain level of meaning in which this icon will admit of sad.riya, and in which Indian aesthetics can be significantly defined. The real problem comes in trying to find the proper categories to define that level of meaning. For Indian aestheticians and philosophers want to speak about that art in quite foreign categories (i.e., unfamiliar concepts). Lawrence Binyon, for example, says of Asian art as a whole: "Pictorial design uses a language which speaks to something in our inner nature beyond the reach of words"15 and Coomara- swamy states: "The Indian or Far Eastern icon, carved or painted, is neither a memory image nor an idealization but a visual symbolism, ideal in the mathematical sense. The 'anthropomorphic' icon is of the same kind as a yantra, that is, a geometrical representation of a deity, or a mantra, that is, an auditory representation of a deity."16 Nor is this the only way of speaking of Indian art, curious as this speech may be. We referred earlier in this paper to a dichotomy between sacred and profane art and defined sacred art in terms of a "tradition," and later showed in what manner these elements were bound together in the schema of "Indian 12 Quoted in part from A.

L. HERMAN traditionalism." We stated, in other words, that there were levels of art and consequently different levels of interpretation and meaning, all prescribed by the tradition in some quite formal manner. It is suggested, therefore, that the levels of meaning in Indian art, those levels carefully prescribed by tradition, can be described in four categories of meaning assigned to sacred scripture by Augustine, Aquinas, and Dante. These four categories of meaning can describe the levels of any situation reputedly "sacred" in nature, i.e., sacred scripture in the West or sacred art in the East. It will be our task to determine later whether these four categories of mean- ing can be adequately accounted for in any semiotical way. The following statement from the Summa will serve to start our catalogue of meaning. Aquinas states: I answer that, The Author of Holy Scripture is God, in Whose power it is to signify His meaning, not by words only (as man also can do), but also by things themselves. So, whereas in every other science things are signified by words, this science has the property that the things signified by the words have themselves also a significa- tion. Therefore that first signification whereby words signify things belongs to the first sense, the historical or literal. That signification-whereby things signified by words have themselves also a signification is called the spiritual sense, which is based on the literal, and presupposes it. Now this spiritual sense has a threefold division.... Therefore, so far as the things of Old Law signify the things of the New Law, there is the allegorical sense; so far as the things done in Christ, or so far as the things which signify Christ, are signs of what we ought to do, there is the moral sense. But so far as they signify what relates to eternal glory, there is the anagogical sense.17 Dante mentions these four meanings in his Convivio, and we might quote the meanings here of the first and the last: The Scriptures can be understood and ought to be expounded according to four senses. The first is called the literal.... The fourth is called the anagogical, that is to say, which surpasses the senses (souvraseno); this occurs when one ex- pounds spiritually a Scripture which though true in the literal sense, also signifies the higher things belonging to the eternal glory, as one may see in the Psalm of the prophet where it is said that when the people of Israel departed out of Egypt, Judaea was made holy and free. Although this was clearly true according to the letter, the spiritual meaning is no less true, namely, that when the soul departs from sin, it is rendered holy and free in its power.s8 We suggest that these four levels of meaning are parallel to the Modes of 17 Basic Writings of St. Thomas Aquinas, Anton C.

These modes of signifying may best be described by the uses to which the modes themselves are put, and summarized as follows: 1. The Designative Mode: in which the task of language is (a) to convey true in- formation about the actual and existing universe (scientific); (b) to explore an imagined universe (fictive) ; (c) to designate the steps the community is committed to taking with respect to certain kinds of performed or unperformed actions (legal); (d) to describe the world views of the philosophers (cosmological). 2 The Appraisive Mode: in which the task of language is (a) to weigh certain ac- tions and give information regarding the preference accorded these actions by certain persons or groups (mythological) ; (b) to cause the interpreter to give preferential place in his behavior to what is signified (aesthetic and poetic); (c) to incite (or inhibit) those actions appraised by some group as favorable or unfavorable (moral); (d) to appraise systematically the appraisals themselves (critical). 3. The Prescriptive Mode: in which the task of language is (a) to inform inter- preters how to attain certain goals (technological); (b) to call out approval of the in- stitutional organization of society as a whole (political); (c) to prescribe that behavior which is to be given precedence over all other behavior and in terms of which all other behavior is to be assessed (religious) ; (d) to organize prescriptors and yet be prescrip- tive in character itself (propagandistic and methodological) (pp. 123-150). 4. The Formative Mode: in which the task of language is (a) to give illustrations of formative-informative discourse (logico-mathematical) ; (b) to induce valuations of ascriptors by the use of formative ascriptors themselves (rhetorical); (c) to incite actions by the use of formative ascriptors (grammatical and pedagogical); (d) to organize a whole body of formative ascriptors, thus giving a wide orientation to behavior (meta- physical) (pp. 168-178). The types of discourse are tabulated by Morris (p. 125) as follows: Ssse Informative Valuative Incitive Systematic Mode Designative Scientific Fictive Legal Cosmological Appraisive Mythical Poetic Moral Critical Prescriptive Technological Political Religious Propagandistic Formative Logico-mathematical Rhetorical Grammatical Metaphysical Some of the concepts introduced in the preceding section may need clarification: Interpreter. An organism for which something is a sign (p. 350). Sign. Roughly: something that directs behavior with respect to something that is not at the moment a stimulus (p. 354). Ascriptor. A sign complex (or combination of sign complexes) in which something is signified. . .. Accordingly, ascriptors may be designative, appraisive, prescriptive, or informative (pp. 345-346). Formative Ascriptor. A compound ascriptor such that the denotation of one or more of the component ascriptors (called the antecedent ascriptors) is, because of the signification of the ascriptor, a sufficient condition for the denotation or lack of denotation of the remaining component ascriptor or ascriptors (called the consequent ascriptor), and hence, for the denotation or lack of denotation of the compound ascriptor itself. Forma- tive ascriptors are accordingly analytic or contradictory (p. 348). (The preceding definitions are taken, with minor alterations, from Morris' "Glossary," pp. 345-356).</page><page sequence="10">22 A. L. HERMAN Thus a painting, let us say, of Kr4rsna playing a pipe and sporting with the gopis (milkmaids) exhibits on one level a picture of an historical incident: Lord Krsna, incarnated from the god Visnu, born on earth and here grown to manhood, plays with maidens of his neighborhood. That is the literal inter- pretation. The painting "means," in one sense of the term, the subject matter of the painting. On the moral level of signification, the painting describes a cer- tain pattern of a man's behavior in his environment, and, insofar as the painter represents these actions in such an atmosphere, he seems to say: Such behavior is good; and we might say that the painting on such a moral level of interpreta- tion states: Do the same actions as this man and lead a good life, i.e., by pipe playing, dancing, sporting with the gopis, and so on. However, insofar as one sees Krsna as God incarnate as the symbol of God, and identifies this play with God's play (l~l) in the world, and the flute and the dance in their symbolic forms as the sport (lila) of God in the world, one turns to the allegorical inter- pretation of the painting. At this allegorical level, there is an injunction to perform certain kinds of actions insofar as one is God or Brahman, and not simply man. There is, consequently, a kind of prescriptive atmosphere about the allegorical level in which the injunction "Do thou as God" is spoken loudly and clearly. It differs from the previous state in that the level of behavior is different: man is not called upon to act in a certain moral way, but, as Nietzsche stated, "Man has received the order to become God." The "Do thou" should for this reason be changed to "Be thou like God." The level is different, further- more, for the level of incitement is different. The object of incitement here is not the sentient being but the supernatural being; the Self, or Atman, is being charged with some order or other: man is not merely told to be good; he is told to become like God. This seems to express adequately the basic difference between the moral and the religious life; between "Do thou good" and "Be thou Godlike." The fourth category, the anagogical, is not so easy to characterize. It does not easily lend itself to metalinguistic analysis, and consequently one cannot transpose it into the categories of semiotic without feeling some trepidation and uneasiness.20 What we are working with here, on all four levels of meaning, is the problem of the complexity of meaning of certain "descriptive" terms whose complexity and generality increase as we move from the literal inter- pretation of meaning up to the anagogic. P. Schaff and J. Herzog in an il- lustration of the four levels of signification point up the increasing abstraction 20 William York Tindall uses "symbol" as we are employing "anagogical": "But the symbol remains, calling for explanation and resisting it. Though definite in itself and generally containing a sign that may be identified, the symbol carries something indeter- minate and, however we try, there is a residual mystery that escapes our intellects." The Literary Symbol (New York: Columbia University Press, 1955), p. 11.</page><page sequence="11">MEANING IN INDIAN ART 23 which is involved in these categories: "Jersualem is literally a city of Palestine: morally the believing soul, allegorically the church, anagogically the heavenly Jerusalem."21 However, the anagogic and the allegorical do not point to any naturalistic objects. They do not signify natural objects (i.e., "publicly observable objects") in any sense of the word. The moral and the literal can usually be accounted for in terms of ostensive natural or behavioral designations. For this reason, we would like to introduce a distinction that will define the levels of discourse, and the methods of discourse, which separate the natural from the non-natural levels just discussed. Let "sign" stand for the vehicle of meaning and all that semioticians understand by that concept, and let it apply to the natural levels of discourse involving the literal and moral modes of discourse. Let "symbol" stand for the method and vehicle of signification employed on the non-natural levels, i.e., on the allegorical and anagogic levels. We will be following here the practice of a number of critics in employing such a distinction. This will save some intellectual embarrassment later when we realize that the significa- tion of the anagogic cannot be stated in words, i.e., it is not an object of study in the same sense that the others are, though we shall maintain that it is, how- ever, still an "object of study," and that its symbols have "meaning" for someone. The following is a rather lengthy description of the dichotomy which we are proposing. It is taken from Carl Jung's Psychological Types: The concept of symbol should, in my view, be strictly differentiated from that of a mere sign. Symbolic and semiotic interpretations are entirely different things .... Every view which interprets the symbolic expression as the best possible formula- tion of a relatively unknown thing which cannot conceivably, therefore, be more clearly or characteristically represented is symbolic. . . . The explanation of the Cross as a symbol of Divine Love is semiotic, since Divine Love describes the fact to be expressed better and more aptly than a cross, which can have many other meanings. Whereas that interpretation of the Cross is symbolic which puts it above all imaginable explanation, regarding it as an expression of an unknown and as yet incomprehensible fact of a mystical or transcendent, i.e., psychological character, which simply finds its most striking and appropriate representation in the Cross.22 And Alan Watts uses similar language in making the same distinction: To understand this parallelism [Watts is juxtaposing Christ, the Second Adam, to the first Adam] one must remember that true symbolism, as distinct from allegory, 21 Webster's New International Dictionary of the English Language (2nd ed., unabridged; Springfield, Mass.: G. &amp; C. Merriam Company, 1960), under "four senses (of Scripture)," p. 998. 22 Psychological Types, H. Godwin Baynes, trans. (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company, Inc., 1924), pp. 601-602.</page><page sequence="12">24 A. L. HERMAN is not consciously constructed; it is the best intelligible representation of interior and unconscious contents, or inspirations of the Holy Ghost, which at the time of the symbol's production cannot be grasped in any better way.23 This rather removes the anagogic from the arena of ordinary conversation. But many of the Indian aestheticians seem to have done this already. It is easy to confuse the upper levels of such discourse, the allegorical and the anagogic, and we must remember that these levels often appear intertwined and as one. One critic in particular, Heinrich Zimmer, describes an experience on view- ing a work of Indian sacred art and then comments on the experience. The symbols in the sculpture24 are interpreted in what may be described as an anagogic manner: Some years ago I paid a visit to the Mus6e Guimet in Paris to see this work of art which the museum had then just acquired. I was already familiar with its myth. And as I stood before it, suddenly there dawned on me an awareness of something which I immediately recognized as characteristic of other Hindu monuments and symbols--a peculiar phenomenon of style-an aesthetic effect which I have en- countered nowhere except in certain of the most remarkable and significant Hindu Creations. I should like to call it "the phenomenon of the growing, or expanding, form." Zimmer goes on to discuss this "expanding form": "This piece of sculpture might be said not merely to commemorate or signify a mythical event, but actually to exhibit the process of its taking place. In this respect, this piece of sculpture is more like a motion picture than a painting."25 Zimmer then comments on this experience: Indian symbols of art voice the same truth as Indian philosophy and myth. They are signals along the way of the same pilgrims' progress, directing human energies to the same goal of transmutation: Our task, therefore, as students of Indian myth and symbol, is to understand the abstract conception of India's philosophical doc- trines as a kind of intellectual commentary on what stands crystallized and unfolded in the figures and patterns of symbolism and art, and, conversely, to read the symbols as the pictorial script of India's ultimately changeless wisdom.26 This "phenomenon of expanding form," we will argue, is one kind of ex- perience which symbols convey. It is important to note that Zimmer has this experience in an area in which he is considered an expert, i.e., he is not un- 23 The Supreme Identity (New York: Pantheon Books, 1950), p. 155. 24 Heinrich Zimmer, Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization, Joseph Campbell, ed.

Thus, of the Origin of the Lingam, he says, "I was already familiar with its myth." In this sense Zimmer is "in the tradition," a member of the community where the rules for the production and interpretation of the symbols are known. In this same respect, there are ob- viously what Morris calls "post-language symbols" attached to the experience of viewing the sculpture. We wish to raise the subject of post-language symbols here and discuss it further later on in this paper. The familiarity with the myth, the involvement in the tradition via a kind of scholarly sympathy, and the awareness of the kind of work being done in that tradition necessitate the presence of post-language symbols.27 If this interpretation of the phenomenon of expanding form is an anagogic interpretation, and one can see that none of the other three types of meaning can quite meet this experience of "something actually coming to pass," then we may proceed, assuming that this inadequate look into an experience which may be interpreted in the anagogic mode is a hint as to what the entire level is concerned with. However, we would not admit that such an experience as Zimmer's is mystical in the full sense of that term, i.e., where some feeling of 27 Cf. Signs, Language and Behavior for all quotations. For Morris, post-language symbols are substitutes for original signs. They are "dependent on language for their appearance," and yet they allow the organism a measure of autonomy and self-stimulation independent of the environment (p. 197). Morris, like G. H. Mead, feels that such symbols allow for a greater measure of "self-conditioning," a fact which "the existing doctrines of the 'conditioned response' failed to account for" (p. 197). These symbols are not language signs (since "they do not serve as signs to other organisms when they are signs to their interpreters" [p. 46]), but they are rather new signs, "since the original sign was a sound, while now no sound is uttered" (p. 47). But not only are sounds the instances for post-language symbols being produced; Morris argues that marks on paper may also be the occasion for such symbols and the signs in "the highly developed fine arts" are "in a large sense of the term 'post-linguistic' " (p. 196). These remarks serve as a bridge between Morris' post-language symbols and Indian aesthetics. Another point about the post-language symbols is that it is the environment itself (the tradition in a culture, as we have argued) and the individual which are the stimuli for these symbols. "In this way language [spoken, written, and 'artistic'] continually en- larges the domain of signification within the individual's environment. The perceived en- vironment has taken on a signification it could not otherwise have" (p. 48). Some of the concepts introduced in this footnote may need further clarification: Signification. "To have signification" and "to have a significatum" are synonymous with "to signify." To signify is to act as a sign in a process of semiosis. A sign is said to signify (but not denote) its significatum, that is, the conditions under which it denotes. All signs signify; not all signs denote (p. 354). Language sign. A sign that is a member of a lansign-system (p. 350). Lansign-system. A set of plurisituational signs with interpersonal significata (having the same signification to a member of interpreters) common to members of an interpreter- family, the signs being producible by members of the interpreter-family and combinable in some ways but not in others to form compound signs (p. 350). Symbol. A sign that is produced by its interpreter and that acts as a substitute for some other sign with which it is synonymous.... There are pre-language, language, and post- language symbols (p. 355). The preceding definitions follow rather closely Morris' "Glossary" (pp. 345-356).</page><page sequence="14">26 A. L. HERMAN identity between the viewer and Brahman is experienced. That, as we have pointed out, is the goal of "Indian traditionalism"; but, it may now be added, the anagogic seems in some sense to deal with that goal. Thus, whether or not Zimmer's experience of "expanding form" can be legitimately interpreted on the level of the anagogic, we will proceed on the hypothesis that it can, since none of the other three levels of meaning can quite fully account for such an encounter. In another work, Zimmer discourses at greater length on the symbols them- selves. He would seem to be agreeing with Jung's definition of symbol when he says: "For true symbols have something illimitable about them. They are inexhaustible in their suggestive and instructive powers."'2 Zimmer proceeds to show that such symbols cannot be reduced to a systematic interpretation, for the intercultural meaning and significance of these symbols is constantly changing. These symbols also possess the ability to alter and augment per- sonalities, for the images and symbols of myth and art possess some kind of "transforming power": "The discoverable contents of the widely distributed images keep changing before his [the scientist's and scientific psychologist's] eyes in unceasing permutations, as the cultural setting changes throughout the world and in the course of history."29 Zimmer warns that, once we begin to systematize these symbols and feel certain about their "proper" interpretation (as, for example, with our allegorical and anagogic levels of interpretation of symbols), ".. . we deprive ourselves of the quickening contact, the demonic and inspiring assault that is the effect of their intrinsic virtue."30 Zimmer describes the effect of these symbols on a receptive mind as, significantly enough, "converse with the gods," wherein one is flooded with divine and fructifying waters, and he states that man can be "instructed, rescued perhaps, and even spiritually transformed" by these symbols.31 In one sense, then, we are dealing with symbols which transform. As with some ancient rite, it would appear that coming in contact with the symbol, in the proper tradition and under the proper conditions, changes the viewer or participant in some sense. Ernst Cassirer uses a similar kind of language and approaches Zimmer's meaning when he writes: But there is one intellectual realm in which the word not only preserves its original creative power, but is ever renewing it; in which it undergoes a sort of constant palingenesis, at once a sensuous and a spiritual reincarnation. This regeneration is 28 The King and the Corpse (Washington: Pantheon Books, 1948), p. 1. 29 Ibid., p. 2. 3so Loc. cit. 31 Loc. cit.</page><page sequence="15">MEANING IN INDIAN ART 27 achieved as language becomes an avenue of artistic expression. Here it recovers the fullness of life; but it is no longer a life mythically bound and fettered but an aesthetically liberated life.32 In this sense, symbols are the vehicle of liberation; and there may indeed be levels of liberation, for we would want to argue that allegorical symbols may also "liberate" in some sense of that concept, though ultimate liberation can exist only in the anagogic use or interpretation of symbols. The symbol aims beyond itself; it points outside itself to the ultimate, and in doing so carries the worshipper along. This purely functional aspect of the symbol (and this "functionalism" would apply to both allegorical and anagogical symbols) is referred to by D. T. Suzuki when he states: "The point is to realize that all that is expressible by symbols or letters is secondary, that they are no more than mere tracks.... What is important is to reach the ultimate substance by means of those tracks or symbols."33 And Benjamin Rowland employs the term "symbol" in a similar manner when he speaks about its "success" in art as a kind of vehicle: "The icon is, indeed, a diagram meant to express a definite religious concept, and never intended as the likeness or replica of anything on earth. The symbol is perfect in proportion to its ability to communicate the ultimate truth that it embodies.""34 This ultimate truth is obtained via the anagogic meaning of the symbol wherein one is raised above the symbol itself. This property of "beyondness" belongs to symbols alone. Philip Wheelwright employs "symbol" in the sense we have defined above, arguing that symbols possess ". .. the property of being more in intention than they are in existence."35 These symbols, he continues, are "ideally transcendent" in that they point beyond themselves and invite consideration. In this connection, Wheelwright makes an interesting distinction between ex- pressive symbols, which stand for something transcendent and are presented for some sort of rational consideration, to which he juxtaposes (perhaps too strong a word) associative stimuli, which may be changed into symbols and expressive symbols. Now, there may be levels of what Charles Morris calls post-language symbols, and these post-language symbols may be directly linked (the language is purposely vague) to the anagogic level of meaning. But the post-language symbols, if they are to provide a clue to the anagogic, i.e., mystical, level of meaning, cannot conjure up associations of a purely natural- istic sort. Therefore, Wheelwright's distinction between associative stimuli, on 32 Language and Myth, Susanne K. Langer, trans.

L. HERMAN the one hand, and symbols of the transcendent order, on the other, may be important for the reason that it points to possible levels of association, and perhaps to levels of post-language symbols. He states: Finally, a symbol should be distinguished from an associative stimulus. ... And since the stimulus merely acts upon the observer by the propulsion of psychic as- sociation and is not taken by him to stand for anything it does not have the status of a symbol.36 But associative stimuli have the virtue of being transformable into symbols: As- sociative stimuli are further interesting because of the ways in which they can be developed, through the arts of poetry and painting, into deeply expressive and sharable symbols.37 We might tentatively say that post-language symbols, arising from a kind of (cultural?) associationism, may explain the "psychology-of-impact" of many symbols, but that insofar as they are mere associations, i.e., mere psychic associations, and thus invitations to action rather than invitations to con- sideration, they constitute a rather "low level" of post-language symbol. The higher level of post-language symbols, we will argue, are meanings attached to symbols which are "built in" ("conditioned," perhaps, though one does not wish to commit oneself totally through a terminology to any particular doc- trine; hence the difficulty here with the language), "built into" the individual by the traditional culture, as we have argued above. These symbols, as in art, are prescribed by the culture, and the post-language symbols are built up in that culture. Here again levels of post-language symbols are met, and it is important to remember that these symbols are not merely of the allegorical type, where meaning can be explained or explained away through words. Such a traditional culture could be shown to exist in Tibet, and the traditional ap- proach to the symbols can be explained through the notion of post-language symbols in operation in that culture. Further, the same structure which under- lies the traditional culture of Tibet essentially underlies the traditional culture of India. "Painter" in Tibetan means "writer of Gods," and this defines the function of the artist in Tibet, i.e., a person who by the use of colors, postures, and gestures established by a rigid tradition reveals the road to liberation to this Buddhist people. Marco Pallis, in his Peaks and Lamas, defines one aspect of this traditional culture in terms of the purpose of their formal art: All the arts are in some measure interchangeable as aids to memory or supports of the same doctrine: they are all called upon to play their part according to circum- 36s Op. cit., p. 22. 37 Ibid., p. 23.</page><page sequence="17">MEANING IN INDIAN ART 29 stances. That is why, though purely decorative features may be varied to taste, the ritual elements are never altered. To change the emblematic color would seem queer and eccentric as well as presumptuous; indeed such an idea could hardly enter anybody's head.38 The rigidity of the art form (the rigidity of practically all the institutions, per- haps) is one of the elements of a traditional society, where the rules, laws, traditions, and what may be referred to in Morris' terms as the "systemic use of language" are brought into play. This rigidity of the artistic discipline in Tibet is further described by Rowland: "It was impossible for the artist to depart from specifications or to rely at all on experience or experiment."39 And this all-embracing rigidity is applied to all aspects of the culture. Pallis con- tinues his description of the tradition: Tradition... embraces the whole of a civilization in all its modes and departments, and tends to the obliteration of all antitheses such as "sacred and profane," even "creator and creation." A truly traditional civilization has its roots fixed in a doc- trine of the purely metaphysical order. This doctrine gives to the whole a principal or sufficient cause. The other constituents of the Tradition, whether ethical, social or artistic, down to the most petty activities of daily life, all derive their authority from this doctrine, to be exercised in their prescribed spheres. Ideas of a meta- physical order are the cement which binds every part together. The mechanism by which the Truth is made to circulate through the body is the Tradition from Master to pupil, which stretches back into the past and reaches forward into the future.4o We have argued that from such a formed and rigid society post-language symbols of a uniform and consistent nature can be built up on the anagogic level, and, as a matter of sheer conjecture, we have tried to explain this level of meaning in terms of these expressed symbols. Since the sacred art of Tibet, as well as that of India, exists, supposedly, for one purpose only, to prepare the worshipper for metaphysical realization, we can see another area where the prescriptions and rules of the traditional society apply, i.e., to the end or pur- pose of life itself. What could be more all-embracing or all-inclusive, then, than these rules of what Morris calls the "formative mode of discourse," ap- plied to the absolute direction of one's life toward nirva.na or moksa.a 38 Op. cit., p. 350. 39 Op. cit., p. 6. 40 Ibid., p. xvii.</page></plain_text>
