<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RELATION OF GOD TO MAN IN THE HEBREW SCRIPTURES THE rabbinic maxim, "Only in the relationship of man to God can Fear and Love be united," might serve as a fit text for Professor Hempel's' stimulating and illuminating study. With a complete mastery of the vast literature on the Bible, and with an unusual understanding for the problems of comparative religion, the author pursues his investigations into the origin and development of the prophetic teachings. He accepts Moses as the living founder of the people of Israel and their religion, but proceeds to show how much in the prophetic word can be best understood against the background of pre-Mosaic tradition which certainly remained alive among the people. He devotes the first book to an interesting description of the element of reverence in Judaism, and shows how it was altogether compatible with the sense of Divine nearness equally emphasized in the prophetic word. From this point he proceeds in his succeeding books to a detailed analysis of the con- ception of Divine omnipotence, a discussion of the biblical conception of prophecy, a most fascinating summary of the metaphorical and anthropomorphic allusions to God, and finally an appreciative under- standing of the relation of God to the individual. "The greatest offering that Israel made to God," he says describing the prophetic historiography in one of his many succint, pregnant and stimulating sentences, "was the sacrifice of its pride in its own past in order to justify Him and His righteousness."(p. 124) Even the reader who is not well acquainted with the problems of Bible criticism will find the book readable and suggestive. With such readers in mind, the author gives all biblical passages in translation and carefully omits the use of any but Roman characters. The book may well serve not only as a handbook on its own problem but is excellent introduction to general biblical theology. Gott und Mensch im Alten Testament.

There were thriving Jewish communities in all parts of the Roman Empire many years before the destruction of the Jewish state in the year 70. In a letter to Caligula, cited by Philo, King Agrippa mentions Jewish colonies3 in "Egypt, Phoenicia, Syria in general and especially that part of it which is called Coelosyria, and also in the more distant regions like Pamphylia, Cilicia, the greater part of Asia Minor as far as Bithynia, and the furthermost corners of the Pontus; and in like manner in Europe, in Thessaly, Boeotia, Mace- donia, Aetolia, Attica, Argos, Corinth, and the most fertile parts of the Peloponnesus." He proceeds: "And not only is the mainland full of Jewish settlements, but also the most celebrated islands, Euboea, Cyprus and Crete. I say nothing of the lands beyond the Euphrates, for all of them-except a small portion-Babylon and the prosperous satrapies around that land, have Jewish inhabitants." It is natural to suppose that these settlements were built up by Jewish merchants traveling about in various parts of the world. Georg Rosen, Prussian consul in Palestine for fourteen years in the third quarter of the nine- teenth century, developed a new hypothesis, according to which the Jewish Diaspora was built up large through converts to Judaism, primarily from among the Phoenician traders. This daring theory was described by him in a manuscript which in the course of his wander- ings was destroyed. He immediately began to re-write it from memory, but died before he could complete it. His son, Friedrich Rosen there- upon undertook the study, and in 1921, obtained the co-operation of Professor D. Georg Bertram of Giessen, to help him put the work in final form. The authors divide their argument into three parts. The first part is devoted to a description of the community of interests, language, fundamental religious ideas, ceremonial institutions, and race between the Jews and the Phoenicians. It then proceeds to show that ancient Israel regarded its religion as universal, and that conscious 2 Juden und Phonizier.

The third part is devoted to a collection of whatever facts are known about Jewish and Phoenician settlements in various parts of the world, and evidence is cited to show that an amalgamation between them was likely. Through the course of their argument, and particularly in the first part, the authors show much ingenuity and erudition, and offer many suggestive and illuminating remarks. But with regard to theory itself the verdict of the reader at the end of the column, can hardly be more enthusiastic than: "Interesting but Not Proven." The many facts marshalled only indicate the possibility, hardly the probability, that the Jewish Diaspora consisted mainly of Phoenician proselytes. And yet as is so frequently true with books proposing novel theories, even the skeptic reader is thankful for the facts accumulated and some of the sub-theories advanced.
