[". . . language reflects the order of thought, and . . . the order of thought reflects the nature of the world ". " Here then, is the value of metaphysics, its value and its truth. The world must be seen from as many of its perspectives as our human capacities will allow. . . . But understanding of it will end in dualisms, dualisms which contain no real discord, but which represent rather a suspended judgment, a question and a search."] Bertram Morris. Beauty and Nature. [States that esthetic value is put into a work of art by the author. Discusses whether nature " possesses value in itself . . . or whether as esthetically indifferent, nature may be charged with esthetic significance only by us ". Says the discussion shows " the identity between esthetic enjoyment of nature and of art ".] J. S. Boughton. The Sacra- mental Concept of Virtue. [Objects to the division of moral virtues into means and ends. Suggests instead that a moral virtue be considered as ' sacramental', i.e. as a trait of conduct which (1) testifies to the funda- mental fact of a unique relation among persons, and (2) reveals an addi- tional element of worthiness in one or more of the persons so related.] 25. Abstracts of papers to be read at the 37th annual meeting of the eastern division of the American Philosophical Association, Princeton University, Dec. 1937. 26. Dickinson S. Miller. Is There Not a Clear Solution of the Knowledge Problem ? [Goes through various objections to the views (1) that objects themselves are present to consciousness, (2) that knowledge is due to images given in consciousness representing objects. Holds himself that knowledge is " the mere presence of images to consciousness ". Since image and object are the same to consciousness, " the principle that renders knowledge possible is the identity of indiscernibles ".] xxxv. (1938) 1. Mary E. Clarke. Cognition and Affection in the Experi- ence of Value. [Discusses in detail two theories to account for the parts played by cognition and affection in experiences of value, which rest on the supposition that value judgments are objective. Suggests that "the primary value concept is not ' good ' but ' better' ", and that till we know better " how to estimate comparatively the resultant goodness of objects having different ' good-making ' qualities ", arguments for the objectivity of good remain inconclusive.] 2. George N. Belknap. Objective Value. [" A theory of objective value holds that, when I say ' A is good', I mean unequivocally what I say ". It " agrees that value occurs in a relational situation, but holds that the relation is internal, that it makes a qualitative difference in its terms, and that value is that difference ".] Newton P. Stallknecht. Protagoras and the Critics. [Attacks the insistence of Boas on the multivalence of works of art. Claims that " it is only when the features of a work of art or a natural object are seen as compresent that genuine esthetic enjoyment is possible". Appreciation of any separate feature of a picture or poem, he says, is (1) not esthetic appreciation,</page><page sequence="2">402 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. (2) not appreciation of the poem or the picture.] Leo Abraham. Acquaint- ance, Description and Empiricism. [Believes in an empiricism which rests on the principle of syntactic reducibility, namelv " A person can refer to entities which are not complexes of his data; but the signs he employs in referring to such entities ultimately consist exclusively of signs referring to his own data ". Seeks to distinguish this from the view that " Every entity to which a person can refer must be one with which he is acquainted, or else consist exclusively of entities with which he is acquainted ". This he holds leads to a paradoxical phenomenalism, confusion of which with his empiricism has often been the cause of bringing discredit on the latter.] 3. Frederick Anderson. Metaphysics as a Science. [Traditional Em- piricism, the scientific way, failed because its supporters attempted to make a certain system of it. Modern empiricism, the sincere, honest and diligent observation of the facts, can never hope for certainty, only for increasing probability. " To any one who demands more than this dubious assurance we can only reply, ' Friend you ask for better bread than is made from wheat '."] Waynex A. R. Leys. Types of Moral Values and Moral Inconsistency. [Shows from the Basutos and Fijians that there are both immediate and instrumental values; and from the Marxists and Fascists that there are absolute values. Further that no ethical theory alters the fact that we are sometimes subject to conflicting duties.] Dorothy Walsh. The Poetic Use of Language. [" Poetry ... says inclu- sively what it means and means exclusively what it says." " Non-poetic language, on the other hand, never means merely what it says, and never says all that it means."] 4. Bruce Waters. Positivistic and Activistic Theories of Causation. [Seeks to show the purely verbal nature of various criticisms of Hume's theory of causation. Says that " Successful predic- tion is the single criterion for judging a causal relation ", and that " the productive theory of causation seems to rest upon a confusion between art and science ". " 'The philosopher endows nature with his own feelings and keeps alive the anthropomorphic tendency that he ascribes to primitive man."] Marjorie Glicksman. A Note on the Philosophy of Heidegger. [Supports with examples the thesis that " Heidegger's philosophy is unique only in its rampant misuse of language and in its own emphatic claim to uniqueness ".] 6. Charles E. Whitmore. The L6cus of Novelty. [" On the whole, this survey of the possible relations of novelty is not calculated to persuade us that it is a convenient idea."] Jared S. Moore. The Significance of the Egocentric Situation. [Applies Mll's methods to " call attention to the superior position which idealism, whether theistic or non-theistic, holds over realism in the comprehensiveness of its view of reality ".] Y. H. Krikorian. An Empirical Definition of Consciousness. [Says that we can be conscious of the experiences of others in the same way that we are conscious of our own.

[Supports the view that "This apple is sweet" alone, is non-significant; the significant predication implied by it in its ordinary use is " This apple is sweet for all normally constituted individuals ". This is perspective realism, which allows the reality of secondary qualities, and stands on the dictum that</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 403 'Only the real can condition the real, and the real can be real only as it is conditioned ".] Ralph W. Erickson. Planck's Concept of Causality. [Examines Planck's attempt to maintain the Law of Universal Causation in face of the facts of modern physics. Says that it is based upon an alogical belief in the rational order of nature. Planck holds this belief because it has been found in the past to lead to scientific discovery. Erickson considers Planck's view of causality to be inconsistent with free will.] PIILOSOPIY OF SCIENCs. IV, 4 (Oct., 1937). V. C. Aldrich. Descartes' Method of Doubt. [Public lecture delivered in 1937 at the Rice Institute in honour of the tercentenary of the appearance of the Discours de la Methode.] R. G. Tugwell. On the Troublesome " X ". [ " X " is the c" creative experience " or inventiveness. The article outlines a policy for promoting and regulating " creativeness . c; We have reached a stage of technology at which the likelihood of good results from inventiveness is almost wholly dependent upon social control. If we refuse to extend control and continue to rely on self-interested exploitation of new dis- coveries we shall suffer the penalty we deserve."] M. Black. Vagueness. [Points out that in a carefully defined sense all empirical terms are used vaguely. Within an appropriate range there is no definite point at which the application of a symbol is abruptly refused in favour of its negative. Vagueness is distinguished from generality-the application of a symbol to a multiplicity of objects; and from ambiguity-the association of a finite number of meanings with the same phonetic form. Vagueness is illustrated by the difficulty of distinguishing in a continuously varying band of colour the positions where one colour ends and another begins. This feature of language has tempted philosophers, notably Russell, to suppose that logic strictly applies only to abstract systems where symbols are ' precise', and not to empirical propositions. The awkwardness of such a view may be remedied, it is urged, by noting the 'frequency' (a defined term) with which a symbol is applied by the users of a language. A propositional function OX is then reinterpreted to mean +(x, c) = " 0 is applied to x with consistency c ". The laws of logic can be reformulated accordingly. It is argued that "deviations from the logical or mathe- matical standards of precision are all-pervasive in symbolism; that to label them as subjective aberrations sets an impassable gulf between formal laws and experience and leaves the usefulness of the formal sciences an insoluble mystery." And it is the purpose of the constructive part of the paper to indicate in outline an appropriate symbolism for vagueness by means of which deviations from a standard can be absorbed by a re- interpretation of the same standards in such a way that the laws of logic in their usual absolutistic interpretation appear as a point of departure for more elaborate laws of which they now appear as special or limiting cases. An experiment is given to illustrate the method in action.] R. B. Lindsay. A Critique of Operationalism in Physics. [Is mainly concerned with the views of P. W. Bridgman as set out in Logic of Modern Physics, 1927, and The Nature of Physical Theory, 1936. Defines operation- alism as the view that no term used in physics is meaningful unless it denotes some definite operation which can be performed in laboratories. The attraction which operationalism exerts upon physicists is founded upon the conviction " that no contradictions can ever arise in actual physical situations ". Thus the adoption of operationalism is held to be a means of excluding unfruitful (and especially philosophical) disputes</page><page sequence="4">404 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. from the physical sciences. Lindsay demonstrates by a number of con- vincing examples drawn from recent advances in physics that in the interpretation of experiments disputes still arise. A more serious objection is that the specificity of physical notions required by the defined version of operationalism excludes the use of certain general terms such as potential energy or the magnetic field. " What We are insisting on is the right, which has indeed justified itself repeatedly in the past, of using in the construction of theories, concepts which are not defined directly in terms of laboratory operations." Lindsay favours an interpretation of physical theories which allows terms to have the kind of meaning associated with " implicit definition " within the framework of a system of postulates. His remarks upon the use of mathematical methods, on mechanical models and the verifiability of statistical statements are illuminating. (It is doubtful whether Bridgman would defend the extreme form of " opera- tionalism " attacked in this article.)] E. 0. Sisson. Symbolic Logic and " Embedding Language." [" Embedding language " is the language of common discourse, within which the specialised systems of logistic symbols find interpretation. Current expositions of logistic symbols, exemplified by Russell and Whitehead's Principia, Lewis and Langford's Symbolic Logic, and Carnap's Abriss der Logistik, are held to be defective in omitting explanations of primitive terms. " If it be said ... that all ' explanations ' must begin with unexplained words, the answer is that the enquiry must begin on the level of the widest and clearest general understanding, namely the 'embedding language '." The method is illustrated by critical dis- cussion of the uses of proposition and assertion in the works mentioned above. (Unfortunately the author's own doctrine of the reverse and obverse of symbols is based upon a dangerously misleading metaphor.)] E. V. Huntington. The Method of Postulates. [The distinction between postulates and self-evident truths, the abstract character of a deductive system, and the part played by definitions in such a system, are among the topics discussed in this excellent, popular but precise, account of postula- tional method.] Discussion (Correspondence). Reviews and Notes. V, 1 (Jan., 1938). C. E. Bures. The Concept of Probability. [Discusses, in a summary way, arguments for and against various theories of prob- ability in the light of recent work. Favours a frequency interpretation and urges that even opposing views involve a tacit identification of prob- ability and frequency. Thus Ramsey, who sets up an axiomatic system concerning degrees of partial belief, uses, in his definition of " degrees of belief ", the " preference " of a subject (for one of several presented alternatives). This involves, the argument runs, a veiled appeal to the Principle of Indifference which can, in turn, be established only on the basis of observed frequencies. Somewhat similar objections are brought against Keynes' theory: the circularity in his definitions of probability is an unobjectionable feature of his system, considered as an axiomatic elaboration of the formal properties of the probability relation. When probability is applied, however, reference has to be made to judgments of irrelevance based upon a principle of indifference and so, once again, upon judgments of frequency. Bures makes no contribution to the solution of the knottiest problem in a frequency interpretation, the difficulty of de- fining a limiting frequency in a series whose terms are not generated by means of a mathematical law. He refers, however, to recent work by Nagel, Lindsay and Margenau which may provide a solution. Reference is also made to Reichenbach's form of the frequency theory and to an earlier paper by Nisbet which appeared in MIND in 1926.] H. Reichenbach.'</page><page sequence="5">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 405 On Probability and Induction. [A detailed reply to the critical review by Ernest Nagel of Reichenbach's Wahrscheinlichkeitslehre in MIND (1936, pp. 501-514).] E. Nagel. Some Theses in the Philosophy of Logic. [A short, but very clear and well-expressed, statement of the fashionable pragmatic view of the function and nature of logic. " Researches in pure logic within the last fifteen years show a marked tendency to reinstate the ancient but neglected view that the subject-matter of formal logic is discourse, that propositional forms are forms of discourse, and that principles of inference are ways of effecting a transition from one piece of discourse to another. We are beginning to see more clearly than ever that it is not at all necessary to go behind discourse in order to clarify or 'justify' the operation of logical principles, and to recognise that in conductino, logical researches we are not exploring the anatomy of Pure Being, but clarifying, refining and amplifying a specifically human instrument." There is no advantage in supposing, as naive correspondence theories do, that " the traits of the instrument (language) are simply distorted versions of the traits of the material upon which it works." Since there are various alternative analyses of discourse, " the view that there is such a thing as the basic logic, the real implication relation . . . is seriously mistaken, and in fact not easily compatible with the discovery (or invention) of the untold multiplicity of logical calculi ". The principles of logic are " rules by means of which the meanings of our terms is explicated and a transition is effected between various groups of statements ". They are thus " conventional " in being concerned with linguistic usages, but they are not arbitrary, " not in the sense that they are fixed by the structure of a reality antecedent to inquiry, but in the sense that they are shaped and selected by the instru- mental character of discourse, by the goals of inquiry and discourse ". A similar function is assigned to scientific theories.] S. Skulsky. A Theory of Time. [Hopes to reconcile philosophical controversies about the nature of time by propounding yet another theory. (This short paper is written in a pleasantly conciliatory tone; it needs expansion before the value of its suggestions can be decided.)] R. H. Dotterer. Indeterminisms. [Distinguishes various forms of determinism and explores their bearing upon ethical questions. The "indeterminacy " admitted by recent physics does not seem to have any important bearing upon the problems of ethics. " Free will)" must be admitted to involve determination and to be inconceivable without it. On the other hand, the conception of moral responsibility presupposes the kind of indeterminism that is in- volved in a pluralistic view of the world.] 0. N. Hillman. Ifmile Meyerson on Scientific Explanation. [A clear summary with ample quota- tions. Respects Meyerson's magnificent researches in the history of science, but does not agree that " the mind's preference for identity in time " thereby revealed is sufficient to establish the contention that explanation is identification.] W. Moore. Structure in Sentence and in Fact. [Considers various interpretations of a view attributed to Wittgenstein that " in order that a certain sentence should assert a certain fact there must . . . be something in common between the structure of the sentence and the structure of the fact ". Dissents from this view, but arrives at an unhelpful conclusion.] D. D. Lee. Conceptual Implications of an Indian Language. [Description of the grammar used by the Wintu tribe of California.

Reviews and Notes. V, 2 (April, 1938). Editorial. Where Is " Philosophy of Science"? [A report on the progress of the periodical during its first four years of life.] P. W. Bridgman. Operational Analysis. [Makes a reply to Lindsay's critique of operationalism in Philosophy of Science (Oct., 1937) an occasion fQr a comprehensive statement of Bridgman's views. Emphasises the descriptive intention of Bridgman's work; it is concerned with analysing methods already used successfully by physicists, does not wish to set up any philosophical theory of the properties which must necessarily be part of every successful method. Physicists are found to be mainly concerned with " activities ", either " in the perception and recognition . . . of sense impressions, or in the performance ... of deliberate physical manipulation or of deliberate thought ". " Operations " as used by Bridgman must be understood as identical in meaning with this wide sense of " activities ". The word " operation " is not to be used in a sense so narrow as to exclude the " mental " operations of symbolising or thinking. Identification of " operation " with laboratory manipulation is the source of widespread misconception of operational technique. " It seems to me that the most superficial examination of what we do in any situation, even a situation which we might perhaps describe as predominantly 'physical', shows at once that 'mental' operations are involved, and further that no sharp distinction is possible between 'physical' and 'mental' operations." (The attention paid to "mental" and "verbal" operations in the re- mainder of this article is in line with the increasing emphasis in Bridgman's later work upon the theoretical aspects of science. The wide use of " operation " thereby involved smudges the outlines of what its more enthusiastic defenders have conceived " operationalism " to be. But criticism is disarmed by the modesty of Bridgman's pretensions.)] A. F. Bentley. Physicists and Fairies. [An investigation, in Bentley's usual picturesque style, of the ways in which distinguished writers in Philosophy of Science are bamboozled by their own abuse of the word " concept ".] F. S. C. Northrop. Causality in Field Physics in its Bearing upon Biological Causation. [Laws in theoretical physics are expressed in terms of the relations between the " states " of a system at various times. In order to specify such a " state " we need to assign values to a set of numerical variables, e.g., to the " positions " and " momenta " of a number of " particles " constituting the system in question. Suppose the values of all these variables have been assigned for a time to. If there is a mathe- matical formula by means of which the values of all the variables are uniquely determined for every subsequent time t(t &gt; to), we have what Northrop describes as a " necessary connection " between states. Causality in theoretical physics involves (1) a definition of the state of a system at a given time, and (2) the existence of a relation of necessary connection between the states of a system at different times. Northrop compares the definitions of state in quantum mechanics with those involved both in classical particle theory and classical wave theory. He attaches particular importance to the observation that the definition of state needed in classical wave physics is expressed in terms of " retarded potentials ". In order to specify a field of force completely, at a given time to, whereas the relevant values of the potential function at the point of observation</page><page sequence="7">IHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 407 are those taken at to, the relevant values of the potential function at all other points in the field must be taken for previous times ti(ti &lt; to). It follows that " there is no meaning in field physics, either theoretical or operational, to simultaneity of action of the forces at all the points in the field at the present time to". On the other hand, " Quantum Mechanics does not prescribe the use of retarded potentials in its definition of state. This entails that it admits a meaning for the relation of every point in the spatial field of force of nature at any present instant of time and, hence, returns to the Newtonian concept of causal action of past upon future for a given observer by way of the whole spatial field of force of nature in the present." Return to the Newtonian concept of simultaneity in quantum mechanics is held to be responsible for the difficulty of reconciling that subject with relativity theory. Northrop applies these considerations to biology by speculating whether organisms are electro-magnetic systems susceptible to description in te'rms of field physics. Some interesting experimental work by Burr, Lane and Nims is produced in evidence. Since 1935 " tens of thousands of observations have been made on different forms of life, from the egg of Amblystoma, a few millimeters in length, to the gross bodies of dogs and monkeys and men ". Species, it is claimed, are found to show distinctive and stable systems of potential differences.] D. C. Williams. Induction and the External World. [Short reply to an article by E. J.

Lundberg. The Concept of Law in the Social Sciences. [Reply to an article by E. Bisbee, " Objectivity in the Social Sciences ", Philosophy of Science (1937). Argues that " the apparent difficulty of applying the methods of natural science to sociological phenomena flows not from any intrinsic characteristics of sociological data, but from the retention in the latter field of postulates long since repudiated in science."] R. Bierstedt. The Meanings of Culture. [Discusses four typical interpretations of culture: " (1) culture as the veneer of refinement, taste and comity which covers the most jagged surfaces of our barbarian ancestry; (2) the higher ex- pressions of group life, such as art, religion, science, literature and philosophy; (3) all forms of group life . . . and (4) the organic unity or dynamic ethos of a social group in its growth and development ". Favours the last of these, which " can clearly and distinctly be defined as a group of people sharing common knowledge, belief, art, law," etc. The advantages of this definition are explained in detail.] V. Lowe. Mr. Miller's Inter- pretation of Whitehead. [Defends Whitehead against Miller (see " Purpose, Design and Physical Relativity ", Philosophy of Science, 1936). Whitehead " did not introduce teleology into his philosophy by appealing to scientific findings; and it is foolish to try to make him do so, if one has the idea of teleology at heart. For nothing can discredit this idea more than appearing to draw it out of the hat of relativity theory."] Reviews and Notes. REVUE DE ME'TAPEYSIQUE ET DE MORALE. 43e Annee, N0 3, Juillet, 1936. P. Janet. La Psychologie de la Croyance et le Mystibisme (premier article). [Begins by pointing out that " belief " (a) is not a phenomenon limited to religion, but present throughout life and the basis of all action, and (b) is not necessarily due to the presence of " truth " in the believer's mind: " it is not truth which produces belief, but belief which produces the appearance of truth ". Analysing, next, the " constitution " of belief, Janet defines it as an attempt at adaptation to reality in order to make</page><page sequence="8">408 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. action more effective. This is best seen in the act of making another believe something-an act which consists mainly of words inducing the other to accept certain promises and commandments awaiting future fulfilment. These verbal promises and commands, accepted by the believer as bases for action, may extend from the visible to the invisible world. The essential thing is the heightened energy of action, the con- fidence of success, the courage to battle against odds, which result from the attitude of belief. Janet likens it, quaintly, to drawing on one's credit at a psychological bank. Of course, the attitude has its dangers, to combat which men seek to rest their lives, not merely on beliefs private and personal, but rather on beliefs held in common with others; and, above all, on beliefs not purely sentimental, but experimental and rational. However, both these kinds of belief bring their own satisfaction, and neither can wholly serve as substitute for the other. Rational beliefs, in the form of " seience ", dealing with general principles, tend to starve the emotions of the individual, which are more adequately satisfied by religious beliefs. This is the general context in which Mysticism has to be studied. It is a mistake to identify mysticism with belief in general, and an even greater mistake to identify it with belief that is merely sentimental or false. Again, it is wrong to hold that every mystic is mentally abnormal. Some mystics have exhibited pathological phenomena, but others have been perfectly sane. Further, Mysticism is not the same thing as religion: there are mystics " outside of any religion ". (To be continued.)] E. Forti. La Nature de l'Ewotion. [A study of the phenomenology of emotion, from the standpoint of the psychology of behaviour (comportement), provided " behaviour " is understood as the behaviour of a conscious subject. Hence, the task is to distinguish and describe the forms and nuances of emotion on the plane of feeling, accessible to introspection, and also on the planes of its manifestation and expression in bodily action, and in imagination and thought. The author offers the following definition of emotion: " Emotion is an instinctive reaction, breaking in upon behaviour which is intelligent and well-adapted, reduced thereby to the initial phase of its course of manifestation, and accompanied by an increase in the internal discharge and the psychological reverberation ". In other words, the instinctive reaction, coming into conflict with a dominant behaviour-set, suffers a reduction to its incipient stages of bodily expression, but the energy thus baulked takes the form of a heightened disturbance of feelingf with prolonged after-effects. The phenomenological analysis which follows, proceeds within this general framework. It is marked by many acute observations, e.g., the distinction of four kinds of fear (frcayeur, 4pouvcante, crainte, peur); the distinction between the momentary gust (bouiffte) of an emotion and a fit (acces) of the " same " emotion; the distinction between various forms of " emotive behaviour " ; the phenomenon of " secondary " emotion, etc. In conclusion, the author connects his phenomenological analysis with Heymans' classification of types of character according as they are emotive-active or emotive-inactive, and again according as their "emotivity " is primary or secondary. The eight types which result are: the nervous; the sentimental; the choleric; the passionate; the sanguine; the phlegmatic; the amorphous; and the " apathic ".] J. Kraft. Defense de l'Aufklaerung. [The essence of Aufklaerung is a challenge, in the name of Perfection, to all beliefs, institu- tions, traditions; to everything relative which pretends to be absolute; to everything temporal which claims to be eternal. It is the challenge to the good in the name of the better; hence, the spirit of reform, of progress.</page><page sequence="9">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 409 The libre esprit, the man who is aufgeklaert, has detached himself sufficiently from the worship of things as they are to perceive that no embodiment of the good answers fully to its own inherent ideal. From this point of view, the author replies to Hegel's criticism of the Auf7claerung as having striven merely after " the vulgar ideal of utility ". Aufklaerung is opposed to dogmatism in religion and absolutism in politics. Spinoza was a supreme example of the spirit of Auflclaerung.] J. Picard. Syllogisme categorique et Syllogisme hypothetique (suite etfin). [Continues his criticism of attempts to reduce categorical propositions and syllogisms to hypothetical proposi- tions and syllogisms, with special reference to the theories of Meyerson, F. H. Bradley, Bertrand Russell, Spaier, H. Poincare. The argument culminates in the assertion that "the categorical judgement, founded upon the intuition of certain relations, is more primitive and more funda- mental than the hypothetical judgement, which is always an inference more or less mediate ". On the way to establishing this conclusion, he defends " judgements of inherence " (as distinguished from judgements in which an individual is affirmed to be a member of a class, or an attribute to be a part of an essence) and thereby the subject-attribute relationship; he criticises Russell's theory of classes as logical fictions, affirming that there are " real classes ", finite or infinite, composed of individuals and indistinguishable from the ensemble of these individuals; he defends the 4c concept" as a " system of relations objectively given in intellectual intuition ".1 Varite's: E.

The former relate how he first came to realise that he had ceased to believe in the Roman Catholic religion; the latter defines his attitude to religion in general, under the influence of Renan. F.

[Two letters from Schelling to Ravaisson, belonging to the years 1838 and 1839, respec- tively; five letters from Quinet to Ravaisson; two letters from Ravaisson to Quinet; and a number of short extracts from some thirty further letters exchanged between Quinet and Ravaisson. The annotation has been very well done and the numerous allusions to people and books, etc., are well explained by M. Schuhl.

Schelling's first letter contains interestingf comments on Aristotle, whom he praises for his contribution to "negative " philosophy (in Schelling's language = rational thought, as apprehending only appearance, in distinction from "positive " philosophy which reaches reality). In both letters Schelling complains of the lengthy delays (from two to five months) in letters reaching him at Muenchen from Paris.] P. Janet. La Psychologie de la Croyance et le Mysticisme (suite). [The first section of this second instalment of the article deals with what Janet calls the " preparatory scepticism " of the Mystics, i.e., with the denial of the evidential value of all sense-perception and thought, and the systematic effort to emancipate the mind from its bondage to these, in preparation for the direct and immediate reception of the Divine into the soul. This attitude is illustrated from Jean de la Croix's La Nuit obscure: even the use of language is to be avoided. Miracles, visions, ecstasies, fastings, etc., are all to be rejected: let " Nothing " be the sole object of thought. To know God one has to rid oneself of all human knowledge. Janet connects this attitude, on the one hand, with the Pseudo-Dionysius and Plotinus, and, on the other hand, traces it in utterances of Nietzsche, Tolstoi, Gogol, and others, and even in the less exaggerated forms of anti- intellectualism in thinkers like Meyerson and Bergson. All these thinkers, however, cling to certain beliefs (croyances) as necessary to their " psycho- logical equilibrium"; and the fact that these beliefs are in conflict with logic, or, at least, are not logically demonstrable, only leads these thinkers to belittle logic. They value the " sentiment of mystery " which is pro- duced by the conflict between reason and faith. Janet confesses that he was once inclined to regard this sentiment of mystery as the essence of religion. But he now rejects this view because " to the genuine believer there is nothing mysterious in the universe ": God explains all for him. This point is further elaborated in the fifth section of the article. The true Mystic is not content with the mere negations of scepticism: he negates only to make room for a positive affirmation on a higher plane. All modern thinkers sympathetic to Mysticism make this claim for it (e.g., William James, Boutroux, Bergson). Some, like Richet, are thereby even led into sympathy with Occultism. This brings Janet to a discussion of the pathological and abnormal states incidental to the ecstasies of some Mystics. On the Mystic explanation of these, that the soul which has emptied itself is then filled with God, Janet makes the biting comment that modern epileptics, whose minds are most thoroughly emptied, are left regrettably unfilled by God; and he gives a medical explanation of these states as based on nervous exhaustion. If it is said that patho- logical states are not essential to Mysticism, then no special claim should be made for the alleged " revelations " received in these states. In fact, such claims are not part of the experience itself: they are subsequent rationalisations and interpretations of it. The final section of this instal- ment deals with " intuition ". The claim to intuition, in the sense of divine inspiration, is a commonplace (banal) among mental patients; nor are the contents of these inspirations necessarily true or good or beautiful. In a sense, the poet and the scientist, too, are " inspired "; but the Mystic's inspiration professes to be what the scientist's never is, viz., immediate. absolute, and from God. These claims are not to be taken at their face value: the critics of "intuition" have compelled even those thinkers who, like Bergson and Le Roy, claim to employ intuition, to admit that the content of intuition may be mistaken, and that its value has to be assessed by subsequent reflection.

L'Astrobiologie et la Pensee de l'Asie: Essai sur les origines des Sciences et des Thelories morales (suite). [The ninth instalment of this mammoth article treats of Christianity as a mysterv religion, in the doctrines of which the author stresses the influences of astro-biology, and, in general, of Eastern religion and culture. Of St. Paul he says that he strove to refashion, in symbolic form, the unity of the scattered ideas which sprang, on the one hand, from solar or astro-biological religions, and, on the other hand, from agricultural cults of salvation and immortality. Here is another typical utterance: " In the European Middle Ages, the spirit of Asia and more especially of Persia achieves a kind of revenge over the spirit of Greece and of Alexander ". Above all, the author traces these influences in St. Augustine's City of God, in his Confessions, in his doctrines of grace and predestination. Not for nothing had St. Augustine been a Manichaean for nine years before his conversion to Christianity. His conception of original sin and deliverance, by God's grace are echoes of Chaldean astro-biological doctrine.] Etudes Critiques: L. Febvre. De Spengler 'a Toynbee: Quelques Philosophies opportunistes de l'Histoire. [Toynbee is only another Spengler, a brilliant amateur who loves to paint large canvasses, full of "sickly errors and of illusions " which betray a " poison of the spirit "! Both Spengler and Toynbee are like magicians who cause the most impossible rabbits to appear from crazily-constructed hats. In other words, they read philosophical formulae into the facts of history, which they carefully select or distort to suit the formula. Toynbee's criticisms of what he regards as the uninspired fact-grubbing of the average historian is like Don Quixote attacking imaginary wind- mills. A Study of History is full of large and vague generalisations which either are so vague that they fit anything and everything, and therefore explain nothino; or else gain a spurious sort of support from the trick of jumbling facts together without regard to the anachronisms committed: " telescoping Assurbanipal into Saint Louis and Sesostris into Lenin ".

[Discusses Maxime Leroy's Intro- duction a' l'art de gouverner against the background of the record of two famous discussions, in the Societe Fran9aise de Philosophie, between Simiand and Seignobos, in 1906 and 1907, concerning the question whether, and what, the statesman can learn from history. Gives, incidentally, an interesting discussion of Cournot's view of the place of accident or chance in history. Ends with the plea that the historian is entitled to go beyond a mere dispassionate ascertainment of facts by passing judgement on the facts from the point of view of his ideals, " with' his noblest feelings ".] Notes: D. Baumgardt. Maimonide huit cents ans apr s 8a nai8sance. [European civilisation received its two most powerful impulses from the Greeks, on the one side, and from the Jews, on the other. The former contributed reason and science, the latter faith and religion. Maimonides strove to synthesize and reconcile these two conflicting heritages, being at once a "radical rationalist and an infinitely believing Jew ". His influence on Albertus Magnus, St. Thomas Aquinas, and Master Eckhart, all of whom quote him freely and often, was very great. But, in the days of Maimonides the conflict was fought out around problems of theology and cosmology: the conception of God as creator and his relation to the world. At the present day, once again there is a conflict between knowledge and faith, but now the conflict rages rather around questions of " moral metaphysics " The efforts in modern Europe to build a new social order of greater justice, to organise economic relations so as to realise ampler human values-these</page><page sequence="12">412 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. efforts rest on "acts of pure faith, not on acts of knowledge ".] R.

[The true character of abstraction is a question of first-rate philosophical importance. The human mind is not simply creative, and the starting-point of its knowledge is always a concrete reality given in presentation. Its demand for know- ledge can only be realised by attaining metempirical values, the necessary, the universal, the transcendental, the transcendent, and these are not to be found in the intuition of the concrete datum, but have to be reached by abstraction. To attempt to find a foundation for them in the experi- ential starting-point is to empty them of their content; to deduce them from a subjective a priori compromises their objectivity. It may be argued, then, that if abstraction is no more than analysis of the concrete datum, we are committed to empiricism; if it is regarded as a genuine " con, struction " of metaphysical values, we fall into subjectivism.

[It is a misconception to look for the source of Hamelin's philosophy either in French writers or in post-Kantian Germans. The influence of French thinkers on his work is secondary; he was all but completely ignorant of all the Germans except Kant and Leibniz. The 'source' of his thought is to be found in Kant. His object is to eliminate all that is incompatible in Kant with " idealism," and, in particular, to replace Kant's account of space and time as forms of intuition by making them pure constructions of the intellect. In spirit he is aiming at the same kind of correction of the Critique which Kant was attempting in the Opus postumum. Of Fichte Hamelin knew very little, and, in spite of apparent resemblances, his " dialectic " differs fundamentally from that of Hegel; it does not exhibit itself in history, the realm of the contingent.] A.
