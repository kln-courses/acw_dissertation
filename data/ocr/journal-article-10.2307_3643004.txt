<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MADRA CAY DELTA ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT, FIRST PRELIMINARY REPORT Geomorphological survey and borehole sampling of the Altlnova coastal plain on the Aegean coast of Northwest Turkey1 By K. LAMBRIANIDES, N. SPENCER, S. VARDAR and H. GUMUS In 1995 a new series of multi-disciplinary investigations were initiated by the authors into diachronic human occupation of the coastal plain at Altinova, between Ayvalik and Dikili on the Aegean coast of northwest Turkey (Fig. 1). Altmova lies approximately halfway between the much better-known (and cer- tainly more intensively investigated) archaeological regions of Troy to the north and Bayrakli/Izmir to the south (Fig. 1). Through the plain flows the Madra Cay, and during the Holocene the river's depositional activity has created a large delta clearly visible on most maps as a projection outward into the Lesbos Channel (also known as the Mytilene/Midilli Strait), with the port of Mytilene and the marina of Thermi lying directly opposite (20 km. away) on the island of Lesbos (Fig. 1, P1. XXII(a)). Altinova's iskele, located in a sand-spit which forms a natural marina, has developed into a modern holiday resort with 5 km. or more of holiday villas along its sandy beaches. Since the early twentieth century, almost no attention has been paid to the material remains of the Altinova region, a particularly unfortunate circumstance given that the area is located in a position of potentially great cultural signifi- cance from earliest times until the present day. The substantial, but still largely unexplored, remains of Late Chalcolithic-Early Bronze Age (henceforth LCH/EBA) date near Altinova together with the proximity of the offshore island of Lesbos, where the EBA site of Thermi is located on the island's east coast, emphasises the strategic location of Altinova between the cultures of the Anatolian interior and those of the Aegean since early prehistory (Lambrianides 1995, and see below also). The overall aim of the project is to understand the region's economy and way of life from the Bronze Age to the twentieth century. Three main ap- 'This project represents a collaboration between members of the Institute of Archaeology at Oxford, University College London and the Ege University in Izmir.

We would like to acknowledge the help given by Dr. Yasar Ersoy (Archaeology Department, Ege University, Izmir) and Dr. Fikret Yilmaz (History Department, Antalya University) during the 1995 season. Mr. Tuncay Timarci provided a very efficient, skilled and friendly drill-team for the duration of the work. Thanks are also due for the warm welcome and cooperation afforded to the team by the direc- torate of Balikesir Archaeological Museum, the Vali and sub-Vali of Bahkesir, the Kaymakam at Ayvalik and Altinova, and the Muktar of Bahqelikoy, together with the local police and Jandarma units in the Ayvahk/Altlnova area. For logistical support we are grateful to the British Institute of Archaeology in Ankara, especially to Mrs. Giilgiin Kazan and Mr. Keith Jordan, and Dr. Geoff Summers offered much practical advice. The research was made possible by the generous grants from the Institute for Aegean Prehistory (INSTAP) (New York), the Leverhulme Trust (London), the British Institute of Archaeology in Ankara (London/Ankara), the British Academy (London), the Wainwright Fund (Oxford), the Craven Committee (Oxford) and the Meyerstein Fund (Oxford).</page><page sequence="2">GOKEE ADASI (IMBROS) Kum Tepe Poliochni Ballkesir !~ Z ' BOZCA ADA (TENEDOS) AGIOS EUSTRATIOS LESBOS Yortan Akhisar 0 Eresos Marmara Golii &lt;3 AEGEAN SEA , iZMIR 40 60 80km I .I., Fig. 1.

First, to conduct geomorphological research in order to elucidate the nature of environmental change in the region over the period of human activity, reconstructing the local environment in different phases of the past. Second, to relate this palaeo-environmental data with the various phases and patterns of human settlement from prehistoric times to the present day as discerned from archaeological survey. Third, to examine the external relations of the communities occupying this region in their wider Aegean and Anatolian context at significant times during their history. The 1995 season of fieldwork was devoted entirely to geological and geo- morphological studies of the delta. A series of deep boreholes were drilled in the delta in order to map out the palaeogeography and geomorphology of the coastal plain, laying the foundation for the archaeological, anthropological and historical studies planned for the following seasons. Thus, the geomorphological survey of the delta in 1995 represents the beginning of our attempt to under- stand the evolution of human settlement and diachronic land use in the region and to correlate the various phases of human activity here with the changing coastal environment of the delta during the sea-level fluctuations and climatic variations of the Holocene. This part of the study will continue in parallel with the archaeological work in future seasons. 1. PREVIOUS WORK IN THE REGION The present-day municipality of Altlnova, a large and expanding group of inter-linked villages surrounded by fertile fields, is located c. 15 km. south of Ayvallk on the delta of the Madra Cay.2 Very little previous study of the Altlnova coastal plain has been carried out and what little is known archaeolog- ically derives principally from a series of topographical studies in the late nine- teenth and early twentieth centuries together with one small sounding carried out in 1949 by Kili; K6kten (1949).3 Mapping and investigation in the region began in the early nineteenth cen- tury with Colonel Leake (1824) whose work provided the basis for the later sur- veys and maps of Heinrich Kiepert and William Ramsay (Wagstaff 1987: 33) (and no doubt Albert Philippson and Otto Berlet also). Ramsay (1890: map fac- ing p. 104), Kiepert ([undated]; 1879; 1885; 1889a; 1894; 1894a; 1898; 1908), Philippson (1910: general map) and Berlet (in Conze et al. 1912: pl. I) all fol- lowed Leake in attempting to locate historically-attested ancient sites in the area (see Appendix), with the latter three authors associating these sites with the locations of known ancient remains on some of their maps. It is unfortunate, however, that the Madra Cay delta was on the periphery of nearly all of the more detailed regional-scale research in Northwest Anatolia during the later nineteenth century which focused upon either the Troad to the north or the region of Pergamum to the southeast (for a summary of the early work in the Troad, see Cook 1973: 14-51; and for the environs of Pergamum until the 1912 Altertiimer regional survey see, Lolling 1879; Fabricius 1886; Conze 1887; Conze and Schuchhardt 1899; Wiegand 1904; Dorpfeld 1910: 395-400; Conze et al. 1912). Moreover, later researchers (such as Leaf) noted that in some areas the accuracy of the work by the early surveyors left a lot to be desired, with sec- 2The population of Altlnova in 1990 was 8469, State Institute of Statistics, 1990 Census of Population: Administrative Division (Ankara 1991) Balikesir p. 6. 3The other main interest in the region focused upon an extended debate concerning the region's classical geography, discussed in detail here in the Appendix at the end of the article. 169</page><page sequence="4">ANATOLIAN STUDIES tions of their maps being inaccurate at best or even "quite wrong" (Cook 1973: 44, 49-51, esp. 49 n.2). In the Madra Cay delta itself three sites were reported after the nineteenth and early twentieth-century explorations: at Assar-Kaya (near Salihler); Kosakly-Tepe (or "Agios Ilias", between Salihler and Makaron Ciftlik); and at a low hill known in the early twentieth century as "Mal-tepe", said to be Fig. 2.

To the north, the only other ancient remains before one reaches Ayvahk were those beyond the edge of the delta at Catmak, 6 km. north from Altinova, where remains of late Roman date were reported (Kontis 1978: 66, citing Wiegand 1904: 262 and Sakkaris 1920: 275). Schuchhardt stated that antiquities had been marked on the hill of "Assar- Kaya" (c. 1 km. north-northwest from modern Salihler) by Kiepert, but in 1899 the former scholar could find no trace of remains there, only on a foothill to the west known as "Taschagyl" (Schuchhardt 1899: 144, 146). Today one of the peaks north of Salihler is still called "Asarkaya", but the only nearby toponym of Ta$agil is that associated with a low knoll 1 km south-southeast from the modern Salihler village. Whether, therefore, the remains marked by Schuchhardt on his "Taschagyl" hill to the west of Salihler (as on the early map of Berlet in Conze et al. 1912: pl. I) are to be equated with the modern toponym still requires clarification.4 Moreover, Schuchhardt unfortunately did not elabo- rate on the precise nature of the remains he saw, and the simple labelling of the presence of antiquities on the maps of Philippson (1910: general map) and Berlet (in Conze et al. 1912: pl. I) (followed by Meyer 1925: map 4, labelled "Karene") remains the sole published record. The most impressive site in the region lay further south, the acropolis of Kosakly-Tepe, located between Salihler and Makaron Ciftlik (or "Makaronia"),5 "half an hour northeast of the latter place" (Schuchhardt 1899: 144; Philippson 1910: 93; see also R. Kiepert 1909: 3 and Dorpfeld 1929a: 174). Dorpfeld (1928: 139) clarifies that this is the same hill also labelled "Agios Ilias" by some early cartographers (eg. Berlet in Conze et al. 1912: pl. I), and the "small house" reported on the summit by Schuchhardt (1912: 122) was reason- ably suggested to have been the remains of the eponymous chapel by Dorpfeld (1928: 142) rather than an ancient structure. Around the oval summit were stretches of walling, including a particularly fine piece of "Attic" masonry of trachyte and limestone blocks on the south side (Schuchhardt 1912: 122) and to the north an ancient springhead (Schuchhardt 1899: 144-5; 1912: 111, 122; Philippson 1910: 93; Dorpfeld 1928: 139, 142; 1929a: 180). Schuchhardt (1899: 145) also reported pottery sherds, amongst which were red pieces, a number of "Rhodian amphorae", handles, roof tiles and a terracotta figurine fragment. When Dorpfeld visited the site he classified the material as being "all from the Greek and Roman period" (1928: 142; 1929a: 180), presumably meaning, there- 4Schuchhardt twice mentions Kiepert as the source of the claim that remains existed on a hill named "Assar-Kaya" in this area (1899: 144, 146), stating that Kiepert equated these remains with ancient Attea (ibid.: 146). Unfortunately, Schuchhardt fails to indicate to which of (H.) Kiepert's maps (or R. Kiepert's geographical commentaries) he is referring, and on all of the H. Kiepert's maps we have been able to locate it is Karene which seems to be marked at TaSagil/Assar-Kaya, not Attea (see Appendix). However, in (R.) Kiepert's commentary on his father's Formae Orbis Antiqui (1909: 3), the author support's Schuchhardt's claim, reaffirming that his father once placed Attea at Assar-Kaya, although on which of H. Kiepert's maps or topographical discussions this association is published is not stated. With regard to Schuchhardt's suggestion that it was Kiepert who was the source for the claim of antiquities existing on the Assar-Kaya hill, it is also important to note that on the (unnamed and undated) commentary to H. Kiepert's Formae Orbis Antiqui Map 9 (1894: 9, notes p. 3, s.v. Karene) it is stated that the source of information for the remains at this east edge of the plain was not autopsy but a visit by Colonel von Diest. 5In the early twentieth century, the area known today as Makaron Ciftlik (4.5 km. north of Kabakum on the Aegean coast) was a Greek village named Makaronia. Originally, this coastal estate had belonged to a Turk from Mytilene named Kolaksizoglou (at which time it was also called by the Turkish name it possesses today), but by 1914 the whole area had been acquired by the Ilioupolis brothers and was a village populated by c. 100 Greeks (Chondronikis 1929: 203). 171</page><page sequence="6">0 Cli) C1 tTI tr] Fig. 3.

On the west side, a hol- low was suggested possibly to represent the location of the site's theatre (Schuchhardt 1912: 122). The location of the third site, "Mal-tepe", is of particular interest because it lies in the area central to that where one part of the present project's 1995 field- work was focused, namely between Altlnova and the iskele marina on the north side of the Madra Cay (Fig. 2). The bare details about the finds made here are recounted by Schuchhardt who described Mal-tepe as a smaller, flatter hill [than Kosakly-Tepe] between Altinova and the Skala, without building remains, but surrounded by fields of sherds. From the hill are supposed to come stones, coins, and a bronze strigil with the inscription Oe66&amp;opo Oapup?i'; ?ico(irqanv) which we saw in May 1886 in the Tschiftlik of Hassan Bey [c. 6 km. southeast from Altmova]6 (Schuchhardt 1912: 122; for the site of Mal-Tepe see also Leaf 1923: 268; Meyer 1925: 106 and map 4; Dbrpfeld 1928: 149; Robert 1962: 174 and n. 3). The only such "low hill" today in the area where Mal-tepe was marked on contemporary maps (Philippson 1910: general map; Meyer 1925: map 4; Dorpfeld 1928: figs 32-3; 1929a: map 3) seems to be the mound known today as Yeni Yeldegirmentepe, found by this project in the Madra Cay delta near Altinova (see Figs 2-3). Another noteworthy addition to the region's scholarship particularly rele- vant to the present project was Dorpfeld's crude argument for geomorphological change in the coastal region of the Madra Cay delta at Makaron Ciftlik (Dorpfeld 1928: 138-44 and figs 32-3; 1929: map 1; 1929a: 179-80 and map 3). The former presence of a peninsula on this now almost completely flat coastline was proposed by D6rpfeld to support his argument for the location of the ancient city "Atarneus below Pitane" at Makaronia which, he suggested, should lie on just such a promontory in this area (ibid., both references, and see Appendix). In order to account for this (now-invisible) peninsula, Dorpfeld gave the following explanation: on the north and south sides of the low limestone ridge which extended down to the shore at Makaronia from the Kosakly- Tepe/Agios Ilias hill (some 4 km. inland), two bays had once existed; formerly, therefore, the Makaronia ridge been a peninsula jutting out into the Aegean Sea; these bays were later filled by the deposits from two rivers, the Madra Cay in the north, and an old branch of the Kaikos to the south (which, Dbrpfeld sug- gested, had entered the sea north of modern Dikili and the Kara Dag promon- tory), thus resulting in the present flat coastline (ibid.). There are many problems with D6rpfeld's classical geography of this coastal area (see Appendix), but this early appreciation that the coastline of the delta's low-lying regions may have changed is noteworthy. The debate concerning which ancient sites attested in the literary sources should be matched with the already-detected ancient remains in the delta area continued into the late 1920s, with Dbrpfeld continuing to propose his (quite radical) reconstruction, despite the strong objections which began to be raised against it (Buisson 1917; Meyer 1925: 106-07; Dorpfeld 1928; 1929; 1929a, and see Appendix). 6In the more detailed publication of this inscription, the second word is shown as being "Toapaoes" rather than "OapToe?6" (Conze and Schuchhardt 1899: 201). 173</page><page sequence="8">ANATOLIAN STUDIES Prehistoric Studies at Altlnova The first attempt to study the prehistory of the delta was made in 1949 by Kili9 K6kten, whose declared aim was "to find the nearest site on the mainland to Thermi on Lesbos apart from Troy" (1949: 815) (see Fig. 1). His brief account of the excavation (ibid.: 813-31) described a sounding on the north slope of a mound called Kaymaktepe by K6kten, located "very near the Ayvallk-Dikili-Bergama highway close to the municipality of Altinova, which lies on the delta facing Lesbos" (ibid.). Fragments of black-burnished pottery were noted, some decorated with white paint, for which Kokten cited parallels in the ceramic horizons of Troy I-II, and which he considered in general as belonging to "the Chalcolithic and Bronze Age of Western Anatolia" (ibid: 831). The importance of Kaymaktepe to the prehistoric phase of occupation in the region is clearly demonstrated by considering K6kten's report in a little more detail. His brief investigation comprised a 2 x 4 m. sounding down to a depth of 3.58 m., exposing three ceramic horizons (ibid: 816): a top horizon of 0.91 m. containing Greek and Roman pottery; below this stratum, a horizon in which K6kten reported pottery "comparable to the Copper Age of North, Central, and Eastern Anatolia" (but with no further details, ibid.); and a bottom level (0.45-0.50 m. thick) consisting of packed ash, clay and sand and "much more typical and pure examples of Copper Age pottery" (ibid.). At this level there were also found remains of a mud wall (0.60 m. wide), perhaps forming the corner of a room, and a "stone-paved floor" (ibid.). According to Kokten, the lowest level at Kaymaktepe can best be com- pared to the EBA ceramic repertoire of Western Anatolia. It contained black burnished pottery with white-painted linear decoration and rim profiles (ibid: pl. XCVI, fig. 10), which are strongly reminiscent of Thermi Class A and B.7 A simple lid without decoration, but with a central vertical handle is also illus- trated (ibid.), a shape common at both Troy I (Blegen et al. 1950: fig. 232: 36.678) and Thermi (Lamb 1936: pl. 27). White-painted decoration is character- istic of both coastal and inland sites of northwest Anatolia in this period, and Kokten compares his finds at Altinova with those from many other sites visited during his wide-ranging survey of 1949. He found similar pottery in pithos buri- als at inland sites in the province of Balikesir (Kokten 1949: 816-7, pl. XCI, map 1): at Babakoy (near Bigadiq), at Kepsut, Boztepe, Orenkoy/Ivrindi, and at the cave site of Karanlik near Havran, which lies in the river valley inland from Edremit. This material is comparable to that from the Yortan cemetery near Gelenbe in the Baklr Cay valley.8 The majority of the wares and shapes at all these sites is typical of the black, brown and red burnished material of Troy I and Thermi Class A and B, thus providing a clear link between the Altinova coastal plain, the island of Lesbos and many other parts of Western Anatolia during the EBA (Kokten 1949: 817). A thorough search for the site of Kaymaktepe carried out in 1989-1991 (Lambrianides 1990; 1992; 1992a) could not locate any mound in the vicinity bearing that name, but the research did reveal the existence of two tells near the Madra Cay known today as Yeni Yeldegirmentepe and Huiyucektepe (see 7Compare Lamb 1936: figs 26, 28, 29 with Kokten 1949: pl. XCVI, fig. 10. The bowl profile in K6kten row 2 is closer to Thermi Class B or C bowls (Lamb 1936: figs. 28-9), with smoother curves; K6kten's row 3 bowl profiles have the thickened rim of Kumtepe Ib or Trojan Shape A6, which are usually seen as occurring earlier in Troy I or Thermi Class A, often decorated with white-paint. 8For ceramic parallels at Yortan see Kamil 1982: pls and figs, passim; for other sites in the Bahkesir Province, ibid., figs 89-91. 174</page><page sequence="9">THE MADRA CAY DELTA Fig. 3). Both mounds exhibit prehistoric pottery similar to that described by Kokten and also the signs of substantial recent human interference (see Section 3 on the 1989-91 fieldwork below). Htiyiicektepe in particular, where old, over- grown holes are visible, could well be Kaymaktepe, but there are no official records of any systematic investigations here and no reliable evidence to support this possibility.9 In short, if Kaymaktepe does still exist as a mound, none of the local people questioned recalled the name and either it has been destroyed by the new (re-aligned) Ayvalik-Dikili-Bergama road built since K6kten's work in 1949, or the change in its name has been lost in time. Since K6kten's death, his fieldwork notebooks, the pottery and all other finds from Kaymaktepe have disappeared and cannot be found in any museum nor in his archives in Ankara University (Prof. Yalqlnkaya, pers. comm. 1990), leaving many questions about the site and its material unanswered. Seeher's recent reassessment of K6kten's work (Seeher 1987a: 549) emphasised the great importance of the material from Kaymaktepe illustrated by K6kten (1949: pl. XCVI, fig. 10). Seeher (ibid.) identified two of these sherds (Kokten 1949: pl. XCVI, fig. 10, row 3) as pattern-burnished on the inside surface (thus agree- ing with Lloyd and Mellaart 1962: map IV). According to Seeher, pattern-bur- nish belongs to the Northwest Anatolian-Aegean coastal horizon of "Be$ik- Sivritepe-Gtilplnar-Kumtepe Ia" (1987a: 549). Of these two sherds, however, the one on the right (K6kten 1949: pl. XCVI, fig. 10, row 3) has a convex profile characteristic of the incurving rim bowl common in late Troy I and Thermi Class A and B (Lamb 1936: figs 26, 28-9). The sherd on the left in Kokten's illustration has a rolled or thickened rim profile, which normally belongs to the Kumtepe Ib-Ic or Early Troy I horizon and Thermi I. Furthermore, this rim is also decorated with sets of parallel diagonal grooves, a feature that is again common in Troy I (Blegen et al. 1950: fig. 234) and Thermi I-IIIa (Lamb 1936: pl. XXX). Seeher's analysis therefore demonstrates rather well how useful it would be to find more examples of the two sherds illustrated by K6kten from Kaymaktepe in order to analyse quantitatively the various combinations of ceramic traits normally regarded as derived from three different horizons in the Troad: Kumtepe Ia, Ib, and Troy I.10 According to official records, there has been no further archaeological field- work in the Altinova plain between 1949 and the investigations begun by the present authors. Surface surveys were, however, carried out in the Baklr Cay valley adjoining the southern edge of the Altinova-Dikili coastal plain by Driehaus in 1955. Driehaus discovered twelve sites between Pergamum and the coast (Driehaus 1957: 76, map), of which the most northerly, Ba$antepe, lies on the southern edge of the Madra Cay delta (Fig. 2). Driehaus described the 1.5 m. high mound of Ba$antepe as lying 1.5 km. from the coast 2.5 km. northeast from Dikili, 150 m west of the Bergama- Ayvalik road and 3 km. from the Bergama-Dikili-Ayvalik junction in the direc- 9After consultation with many landowners and local officials during the 1995 season, it is possible that the mound of Huiyficektepe may have been known previously as Kaymaktepe. Enquiries revealed that the only other mound in the vicinity (Yeni Yeldegirmentepe) has been known by the same name for at least two generations, whilst local cadastral officials in Altinova thought that Htiyticektepe may once have been known by an alternative name. l?This phenomenon apparent at Kaymaktepe, where some single sherds exhibit features else- where found only in distinct strata, is paralleled at a number of other sites in the region. Meri; (1993) noted such "hybridisation" in the Neolithic ceramic styles in the Gediz valley, and at the site of Prophitis Ilias in central Lesbos some EBA sherds combine shapes typical of Thermi Class A wares with fabric treatments from earlier periods (Lambrianides 1995; Spencer 1995a: 24 [site 112]; Lambrianides and Spencer forthcoming). 175</page><page sequence="10">E Autlt ok NRis b; Absotout Retotini TOPTULLAR - Sediments , tovation O epth 0 .. : ;.:*.'-; t NEBATi TOPRAK (liltli kumlu) Sondy solt - KARALA$MA Conttinen tat stoage -Om. 2 .'.'-- T SiLTLi KUMLtU Kit Ctaywith silt and and - _, _ .

Driehaus also noted fragments of "milky-grey to reddish" Troy VI wares (ibid.; French 1969: 69), and some early Hellenistic pieces (Driehaus, ibid.). Four years after Driehaus' survey, in 1959, French made a brief visit to the delta area and informed Bayne (1963: 109 and n. 182) that at Makaron (iftlik he had seen a scatter of second millennium grey wares, an observation later mentioned (without any further detail) in French's published study of the prehis- toric sites of the Akhisar-Manisa region (French 1969: 69).1 It is noteworthy, however, that Bayne, who at this time carried out detailed fieldwork in the area for his study of the Middle Bronze Age-Early Iron Age grey ware pottery and obviously had access to the results of French's fieldwork also, stated that after Makaron Ciftlik "north of this no sites are known until the Edremit plain" (Bayne 1963: 109). Obviously, therefore, Bayne had neither found nor been told of other relevant prehistoric sites in the Madra Cay delta, and the only remains he does mention north of Makaron Ciftlik were unspecified historical ones which he did not have time to visit (ibid.: 228-9, presumably referring to the sites found during the early German work discussed above and in the Appendix).12 2. GEOMORPHOLOGICAL STUDIES The first geomorphological research in the delta was carried out by Erol (1975) who drilled a single bore-hole down to a depth of 38 m near the shoreline of the delta in a water well of the Ankara University property, c. 4 km. north of the mouth of the Madra Cay (Fig. 3). His findings suggested that the delta had been affected several times by fluctuations in relative sea-level during the Holocene, during which three separate fluvial stages were sandwiched between three marine transgressions, as depicted in his borehole stratigraphy (Erol 1975: cross-sections 1-2) (Fig. 4). At the bottom (at a depth of 36 m.), evidence was found of a fluvial- lagoonal phase, from which Erol inferred that sea-level had then been c. 36 m. lower than at present and that the shoreline was to the west of (ie. further out at sea than) the present-day coast. Above these strata, at a depth of 22 m., there was evidence of a second fluvial-lagoonal phase, indicating that sea-level had risen from 36 m. up to 22 m. below its present level, but was again west of its present-day location and therefore still further out at sea than the present coast- line. At a depth of 17 m., there was evidence of a third fluvial-lagoonal phase, suggesting that the sea had risen to this level and was still to the west of its pre- "The presence of antiquities at Makaron Ciftlik was confirmed in 1995 by the owner of the nearby Orhan Bey Ciftlik. Moreover, an ancient block at Orhan Bey Ciftlik inscribed with a late- antique inscription and Byzantine cross was said to have originated from the former site. 12Whether Bayne was aware of the excavation at Kaymaktepe, or simply considered the mate- rial at the site to be all of an earlier date to that on which his study was focusing (the Middle Bronze Age-Early Iron Age) is not clear. It may be noteworthy, however, that even in his intro- duction concerning the EBA in the region under study (Bayne 1963: 6-19), no mention is made of the work by K6kten. 177</page><page sequence="12">ANATOLIAN STUDIES sent-day position. Thus the overall sequence from 36 to 17 m. indicated that the sea-level at the Madra Cay delta had risen from a former time when it had been at a much lower level, but that marine fluctuations had taken place to the west of today's shoreline. Perhaps the most significant findings, however, came above 17 m., where the stratigraphic core consisted of "pure marine sands and marine shells" (Erol 1975: 31), showing clearly that a major marine transgression had taken place across the present-day coastline, during which sea-level rose from 17 m. to 6 m. and removed or replaced any terrestrial/fluvial deposits. This transgression appears to have stopped when sea-level was still 6 m. below present (a pause in the transgression attested in Erol's stratigraphy by a mixture of marine and fluvial sediments and swampy, lagoon like conditions). After studying this sequence, Erol concluded that during the transgression the coastline must have moved "c. 4-5 km. inland and to the east of the present one" (ibid: 31) (Fig. 4). Subsequently, after this phase, there was yet another regression of the sea, in which the coastline moved west once more (presumably due to the depo- sition of large amounts of terrestrial deposits by the river, creating heavy alluvi- ation on the delta). In 1988 Olgen completed a study of the surface of the Madra Cay delta while research assistant to Erol, noting the flow rates of the river, the possible effects of this process on alluviation in the delta, and the steep gradient of the river (which rises c. 1300 m. to its source in the Madradagi range) (Olgen 1988). The latter fact means that in seasons of heavy rain the total quantity of sedi- ment brought down by both the river and downwash can be considerable (ibid.), and the delta is now 7 km. wide from the foothills to the sea with a surface covered by a thick layer of terrestrial (alluvial-colluvial) silty sand deposits. Mean annual rainfall for the years 1964-1980 was estimated by Olgen to be c. 600 mm., of which 80% tended to fall during November-March, and the river's mean annual flow for 1964-1981 was found to have fluctuated consider- ably, from a very low 0.7 million cubic metres to a maximum of 8 million cubic metres (ibid.). The steep valley walls observed in the upper reaches of the river today suggest that there has been substantial down-cutting into the river bed during past times in its descent to the coast. This phenomenon has been observed to take place during periods of falling sea-level as during the Last Glacial Maximum c. 17,000 BP (van Andel &amp; Shackleton 1982). In very simpli- fied terms, the type and quantity of sediment brought to the coast by a river varies with sea-level changes due to the effect on stream erosion and transport capacity: i.e. lowering sea-level increases the down-cutting by a river into its valley and the steeper angle of flow allows the transport of coarser material (Inman 1983: 1-2). Conversely, rapid sea-level rise (as in the Early Holocene) slows the flow of a river, transforming such stream-cut valleys quite quickly into alluvial traps as the gradient decreases (ibid.; Eisma 1978).3 3. THE 1989-1991 INVESTIGATIONS IN THE MADRA CAY DELTA The studies of 1989-1991 (Lambrianides 1990; 1992; 1992a; 1995) had the overall aim of integrating the geomorphological and archaeological work by 13The caveat to this over-simplified model of the relation between fluctuating sea-levels and river flow is that the base level at each juncture of the river with its landscape must be taken into account. In the case of the Madra Cay, the base levels are: first, where the steep gradient of the upper river meets the piedmont at the rear of the coastal plain (6-7 km. from the sea); the second base level occurs where the foothills meet the coastal plain; and the third base level is the meeting point of the river mouth with the sea. 178</page><page sequence="13">THE MADRA CAY DELTA examining the formation of the delta, the fluctuations in relative sea-levels and coastlines, and the effect of environmental changes on human settlement in the area. Surface Survey Exploration of the delta's surface located four possible mounds or tells with evidence of occupation in many periods of antiquity, although the chronological focus of the 1989-91 work was specifically upon the LCH/EBA periods. (a) Yeni Yeldegirmentepe lies north of the river, in the province of Balikesir, 2.5 km. from the coast and 1.5 km. from the village of Altinova (Figs 2-3). A water-pumping station has been built on the mound (Pls XXII(b-c)), destroying part of it and exposing large quantities of pottery together with some pieces of bone and Cardium sp. (sea-)shells in certain places. Amongst the pottery are many clearly handmade wares with shapes diagnostic of the Thermi and Troy I period. Later wares, including Archaic to Roman, Byzantine, Islamic and Early Modern glazed sherds could also be seen on the mound and in the surrounding fields. Of these ceramics, only the EBA sherds have been examined more closely, and we offer some preliminary observations upon these. Easily recognisable amongst the assemblage were pieces of polished or bur- nished grey, beige, reddish-brown, bright red and jet black wares, and footed bowls or parts of cooking pots with parallels at Poliochni Black, Thermi I-II and Early Troy I.14 Some bowl profiles with thickened inside rim also seen here were reminiscent of Troy Shape A6 (Blegen et al. 1950: fig. 234). Inevitably, the most common form was the inverted rim bowl (Troy Shape A12), both with and without lugs; some rims were sharply inverted, others curved in more smoothly and appeared closer to Thermi Class B or C and Troy Shape 16; beak-spouted fragments suggest the presence here of the common jugs known from Thermi, Troy and Yortan (eg. Lamb 1936: fig. 26: Jugs 1, 5). A loop handle with paral- lel incised lines running diagonally along the strap recalls those at Thermi (Lamb 1936: pls XIV-XV) and in the Baklr Cay valley (Driehaus 1957: fig. 4.1-23); a bowl with a pronounced internal ledge round the inside of the rim, perhaps a lid-rest, also has parallels in the Baklr Cay valley (ibid.: fig. 4.4, 8; cf. Blegen et al. 1950: fig. 223a, Shape A14); a range of convex bowls with incurved rims, some with a horizontally pierced lug handle either on or below the rim, similar to those at Ba?antepe (Driehaus 1957: fig. 2.11-31); a high- necked jar with everted rim similar to those at Giimiiuova-deresi near Bergama (ibid.: fig. 1.20, 25). A few "red-washed" sherds (perhaps reminiscent of Troy II) were noted also, two basket-shaped vessels common at Troy (Blegen et al. 1950: fig. 223b, D3, D9, D10, D11), and anthropomorphic pots (face urns, perhaps), suggesting that Troy II and later material might not be entirely absent here. Cardium sp. shells were often found mixed with the sherds, perhaps suggesting the existence of food middens accumulated here by the inhabitants of the mound over a long period of time (a hypothesis consistent with the clusters of Cardium sp. shells found at a number of depths below the delta's surface in the 1991 borehole, see below and n. 16). A single stone hammer was also noted. (b) Hayiicektepe is found on the south side of the river c. 4 km. from the coast, opposite the village of Bah9elik6y (Figs 2-3). Sherds seen on the surface here suggest a very similar range of ceramic material to that found at Yeni '4Cf. Thermi (Lamb 1936: fig. 26, Class A tripod cup); also Early Troy I (Blegen et al. 1950: fig. 233: 35.644). 179</page><page sequence="14">ANATOLIAN STUDIES Yeldegirmentepe, and on the tell there are also two small, but pronounced, knolls which seem to represent the location of refuse middens, each containing large numbers of Cardium sp. shells and more ceramic fragments. (c) Pandir Tepe lies in fields on the eastern edge of the delta (across the main asphalt road), c. 3 km. east from Altlnova near the village of Bahqelikoy, and very close to the higher land (Figs 2-3). It is a compact mound at the point where the flat plain begins to slope up into the foothills of the Madradagi. This mound is of particular interest in view of its position on the inland edge of the delta, close to where the river emerges from the hills into the plain. (d) Kazan Tepe is located on the southern edge of the delta, c. 6 km. south- east from Hiiyiicektepe (Figs 2-3). A close inspection of the cultural material was not included in the permit, but evidence seen on the surface suggests that it belongs to the same pattern and phase of EBA settlement as the other three mounds. The findings of the 1989-91 survey taken together with K6kten's evidence from Kaymaktepe suggest, first, that settlement at Altinova may have begun in the Middle-Late Chalcolithic phases termed by Seeher (1987a) the "BeSik- Sivritepe-Giilpinar-Kumtepe Ia horizon", continuing into the EBA. Middle- Late Bronze Age remains have been discovered here (Bayne 1963: 20-153; French 1969), as well as Archaic, Classical, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman/Medieval and some nineteenth century material, which will be exam- ined in detail in future seasons. Second, it appears that this part of coastal Northwest Anatolia and Lesbos may have shared a particularly close material culture. The ceramic parallels between the mounds in the delta, those in the Bakir Cay valley (Driehaus 1957), and several EBA sites in Lesbos (Lambrianides 1995; Spencer 1995a: fig. 3) sug- gest the possible existence of a cultural "koine" in the region, especially in EB2.'5 It may well be that the EBA settlement in the delta area at Altinova developed as a continuation of that established in the Baklr (ay valley (for example, at Ciftlik Tepe and a second site known as Yeni Yeldegirmentepe fur- ther south, Driehaus 1957: figs 4-5), and that this pattern then developed onto the east coast of Lesbos (where there are four certain and another three possible EBA sites, Lambrianides 1995; Spencer 1995a: sites 2, 11, 24, 27, 240, 242, 244 and fig. 3). One possible route for this initial diffusion of the EBA culture to the east Aegean could have been along the Baklr Cay valley from the interior (see Fig. 1). Sub-Surface Study The 1991 borehole was drilled in the fields on the western edge of the mound of Yeni Yeldegirmentepe, with datum point 7 m. above present sea-level and 6 m. below the top of the mound (see Fig. 3). This borehole provided a stratigraphic column of 11 m. and suggested two different environmental phases below the delta's present surface (Lambrianides 1992; 1992a) (Fig. 5). '5A number of shapes and styles of decoration are particularly common throughout the region: inverted rim bowls, horizontal tubular lugs (a number with ribbed decoration), jars with collar necks, footed pots, funnel necks and pots with incised/herringbone decoration (cf. Lamb 1936; Kikten 1949; Blegen et al. 1950; Driehaus 1957; Lambrianides 1995). Equally striking also is the disappearance of this widespread ceramic horizon (after EB2) from Lesbos, Altinova, the Bakir (ay, Akhisar-Manisa and Balikesir, apparently leaving each of these regions isolated from each other (a phenomenon also to be investigated by the present project). 180</page><page sequence="15">THE MADRA CAY DELTA The upper phase, from the surface down to a depth of 6 m., consisted of coffee-brown silty sand, indicating terrestrial (alluvial and colluvial) deposits either brought down by the river or by downwash from the mountains. The lower phase, starting below 6 m. consisted of much darker and much finer sandy particles (Lambrianides 1992; 1992a), in which the very fine texture of deposits suggest a swampy environment compared to the coarse terrestrial particles of the levels above (Fig. 5). The most significant details of the stratigraphy are first, a significant con- centration of Cardium sp. shells at a depth of 4.5-6.3 m. (not found higher up) (ibid.), indicating the formation of shell middens near the site of Yeni Yeldegirmentepe at some stages of its occupation.16 Second, at a depth of 6.3-6.7 m., some badly broken ceramic fragments mixed with sand, more Cardium sp. shells, and pebbles. Two sherds from this latter level were identified, one as a prehistoric handmade ware, and the other as Roman, casting doubt on whether any of the sherds found here were in situ. Nevertheless, the overall bore- hole stratigraphy below 6 m. seemed to indicate an active, fluctuating environ- ment in the lower phase, with both fluvial and marine processes involved. Further down, at a depth of 6.7-9.0 m, there was only very fine black sand and silt (without any cultural material). This phase suggests the existence of a more coastal-marine or swampy environment. At a depth of 9.0-9.5 m. was an unusually greasy, plastic and sticky mixture of fine sand, silt and clay reminis- cent of swampy, muddy and organic conditions (dark green to black), forming a lens surrounded by clean sand above and below. Beneath this layer was a fur- ther metre of clean and loose sand, occasionally with broken stones, and at 10.5-11.0 m. (the bottom of the borehole) a dense concentration of pebbles, sand, Cardium sp. shells and some ceramic fragments (which could have fallen from higher up). 7 Subsequent investigations by Kayan (pers. comm.) nearer to the coast in 1992 suggested that the marine invasion of the delta reached c. 2-3 km. inland, as far as the edge of Yeni Yeldegirmentepe, in which case this mound would have been on the shoreline when it was occupied in the EBA. Kayan estimates that this transgression by the sea probably occurred during the maximum exten- sion of the Holocene transgression c. 6000 years ago, and that subsequently allu- vial deposits on the delta, not only by the Madra Cay but also by other small streams from the mountain, continued to cover the lower (near-coastal) part of the delta. This process may also explain why sherds were found down to a depth of 6 m, since this was the location and the depth at which the sea and the coast met c. 6000 years ago,18 and the phase of settlement associated with the Middle- Late Chalcolithic in this region may have began as a fishing camp, particularly as the shell remains found in the borehole are believed to relate to shell middens and cannot be natural deposits. '6According to Kayan, who has carried out additional drilling, these shell remains in the bore- hole relate to middens and cannot be taken as indicators of palaeo-tides or former littoral condi- tions because of the lack of coastal sediments in the stratigraphy. 17An allowance has to be made for the reworking of the deposits as a result of the shifting channels typical of a deltaic situation. '8This date of c. 6000 years B.P. is often regarded as the approximate beginning of the LCH- EBA ceramic tradition on the East Aegean coast. For recent discussions of the absolute chrono- logy in this region see Mellink (1992) and Manning (1995) (absolute dates are still awaited from the present project's 1995 analyses). 181</page><page sequence="16">Deptn: I I 0ovr AO 1991- Surf. elev.: 900 cii' Drill type .

THE 1995 GEOMORPHOLOGICAL SEASON The overall aims of the 1995 season were threefold. To clarify previous coast- line positions in the delta; to develop significantly previous palaeogeographic analysis of the area by sinking boreholes near both Yeni Yeldegirmentepe and Htiyucektepe (thereby analysing for the first time the delta's geomorphology on the south side of the Madra Cay in addition to that to the north); and to begin reconstructing the past environment during all periods of human occupation. The first two aims were largely met, and for the achievement of the last remaining objective detailed laboratory analysis is currently being carried out in the Geography Department at the Ege University in Izmir on the soil samples obtained. The work also obtained much additional information, however, estab- lishing stratigraphic profiles for both sides of the river in addition to that between the mounds. Furthermore (as will be clear from the following account), substantial deposits of cultural material were found distributed in the delta, sup- porting the conclusions of earlier scholars that there has been near-continuous human settlement on this coastline since early prehistoric times. In this initial season, a geological survey was carried out also by Dr. Hasan Gumiiu of the col- laborative team from the Geography Department of the Ege University in Izmir, mapping geological faults and bedrock boundaries in the delta together with those areas in which there exist old land surfaces (such as Neogene formations) where future surface survey work might prove fruitful. From 12th September until 1st October two series of boreholes were sunk at several locations on each side of the Madra Cay (see Fig. 3, P1. XXII(c)), obtaining stratified cores of the depositional events that have taken place on the delta during the Holocene. On the south side of the river three deep boreholes were drilled, seeking to reach bedrock (see Fig. 3). Borehole 1 (Fig. 6) was carried out on the edge of the artificial mound of Htiyticektepe (see above and footnote 9) and produced interesting results. Below 4-5 m. of terrestrial deposits (comprising topsoil, sterile earth and sands, the lat- ter both present-day and ancient) a cultural layer was encountered c. 2 m. thick which contained some badly damaged ceramic fragments, small pieces of char- coal, and marine shells, all indicating human activity and possibly a (now- buried) refuse midden. Further down (from 6.2-7.3 m.), a 1 m. layer containing charcoal and burnt soil with some pulverised shell residues was encountered, and below 7.3 m a thick layer of pebbles and larger blocks of broken andesite extended down to 10 m where drilling became very difficult and was discon- tinued. This bottom layer indicated that the borehole had reached broken bed- rock material. Two points are particularly noteworthy. First, that the sub-surface cultural material from Borehole 1 comes from a location well beyond the edge of the present surface scatter of ceramics on the mound, indicating that underneath the present alluvial deposits the mound's diameter is even greater than would be apparent simply from surface archaeological work. This finding therefore emphasises the value of the current project's methodological approach of employing augur survey of cultural deposits in areas subject to significant allu- vial deposition. And a second, potentially highly significant, finding is the cul- tural layer of charcoal, burnt soil and shells immediately above bedrock, strata which are lower than any ceramic deposits in the borehole. These lowest cul- tural levels could be part of an aceramic occupation on the mound and the 1996 fieldwork program will investigate this exciting discovery in greater detail as well as establishing a full stratigraphy for the mound of Hiyiicektepe. 184</page><page sequence="19">THE MADRA CAY DELTA Borehole 2 was sunk approximately 1 km. south-southwest from the first just above (ie. inland from) the 10 m. contour line (see Fig. 3). Drilling revealed a substantial 10 m. thick section of swamp/marine deposits from 6.3 m. to a depth of 16.3 m., indicating that between Boreholes 1 and 2 there must be a series of interdigitating layers of swampy/coastal/marine conditions, alternating with fluvial/terrestrial deposits. Additional drilling in 1996 will be carried out in this area between Boreholes 1 and 2 in order to clarify the precise point of inter- action of these deposits. It is clear already, however, that in this part of the delta there had been several fluctuations in the diachronic relationship between the deposition by the sea and the river, probably due to repeated changes in relative sea-level during the Holocene. Thus, from the combined findings in Boreholes 1 and 2, it is possible to conclude, first, that the mound of Hiiyiicektepe was based on a protruding knoll of bedrock which had been near a swamp or shallow marine/coastal environ- ment.19 A working hypothesis to explain the choice of this knoll as a location for settlement by the prehistoric settlers would be that such a protruding piece of bedrock may have offered one of the (perhaps very limited) stable areas in the delta suitable for habitation at a time when the coastal environment was partic- ularly vulnerable to sudden change. However, detailed laboratory analysis of the samples from these layers is needed to determine the exact character and age of this marine/coastal phase before such models can be substantiated. The second conclusion is that below the cultural levels there is a deep layer of transported bedrock material (ie. disturbed andesite), and below this undisturbed bedrock. The geological survey of the study area clarified that on the south side of the river (ie. underneath Hiiyticektepe) volcanic rocks form the delta base, whereas to the north of the river in the area of Altinova and Yeni Yeldegirmentepe (see below) there are sedimentary limestones underlying the alluvial deposits. Borehole 3 was drilled c. 1.3 km. south-southwest from Borehole 2, creating a straight line of three boreholes which could be used to create the profile of geomorphological developments on the south side of the Madra Cay (see Fig. 3). The findings from Borehole 3 confirmed the stratigraphic pattern from Borehole 2, with a large section of marine/swamp deposits between 6.9 m. and 16.8 m, indicating that on the south side of the river the profile basically consists of: topsoil, terrestrial and cultural material (c. 0-7 m.); marine and swampy material (c. 7-17 m.); terrestrial deposits (decomposed-solid bedrock) (below c. 17 m.). The north section of the Madra Cay delta is similar in general terms to the south section, but in the past there seem to have been stronger incursions by the sea. This phenomenon may be due to the effect of strong north-south littoral drift in the strait between the island of Lesbos and the Turkish coastline which has affected beach formations on both sides of the channel. Preliminary analysis of the core samples indicates that the sea certainly appears to have reached fur- ther inland to the north of the river, although more detailed laboratory work is required to confirm this observation. Borehole 4 (see Fig. 7) was sunk on the edge of the large (but unfortunately greatly disturbed) mound of Yeni Yeldegirmentepe (approximately 50 m. further away from the mound than the 1991 borehole). A water pumping station has been constructed on this mound (P1.

Ground water level of the cultural material, but there are still clear signs of a dense multi-period ceramic scatter and shell deposits. A high terrace on the northwest side of the mound suggests the destruction of its edge and dense scatters of sherds, tile and bone are strewn in a cotton field. Remains of a burial at Yeni Yeldegirmentepe had been reported some years before, and it is particularly noteworthy that when drilling work was conducted on the mound during the construction of the pumping station, large deposits of human bone were found at a depth of between 15 m. and 32 m., indicating a significant burial complex, very possibly of early (prehistoric) date. The findings from Borehole 4 (see Fig. 7) again indicated, as with Borehole 1, that the sub-surface distribution of cultural deposits extended much further away from the mound (50m. in this instance) than was apparent from the present-day ceramic scatter visible on the surface of the field. As Fig. 7 shows there are three main phases in the 21 m. of stratigraphy found in the core.2d From the surface down as far as 10 m. a mainly terrestrial/fluvial environment is attested; from 10-17 m. a predominantly marine environment is indicated; and finally, below 17 m., there is a basal terrestrial environment dating probably to the beginning of the Holocene. Thus, working from the base upwards, we have the pre-Holocene basement on which is deposited early Holocene terrestrial sed- imentation: there then comes a layer of marine deposits 7 m. thick, indicating the main period of marine transgression, which reached inland to this mound (c. 2.5 km. from the present shore). The marine regression appears to begin at c. 12 m. in the borehole stratigraphy and a swampy, coastal flood-plain environ- ment predominates at c. 12-10 m. Above this phase human occupation occurs in the form of charcoal, burnt soil and sherds at c. 7.5-4 m. Borehole 5 was sunk c. 2 km. further southwest, only 200 m. from the present coastline near the property of Ankara University (see Fig. 3), and found 20Absolute dates for each of these three phases, by C14 and OSL (optically-stimulated-lumi- nescence), are being obtained from the cultural and sedimentary material in the borehole. 187</page><page sequence="22">ANATOLIAN STUDIES a number of interdigitating deposits of terrestrial and marine/swamp material. This borehole was very close to the previous deep sounding by Erol in 1975 (see Section 2 above), and it was from this sounding that Erol established his basic model for marine transgressions in coastal Western Anatolia during the Holocene. The results of Erol's work have always been in dispute, however, especially since the later coastline work by Kayan at the Be$ik Bay near Troy and on the Datqa peninsula, and the opportunity to re-examine the geomorpho- logical sequence of the Madra (ay delta with the more advanced analytical and dating techniques now available was considered to be of crucial importance. Borehole 5 reached a total depth of 27 m. and the general sequence of depo- sition was as follows: topsoil and terrestrial (mostly sandy) deposits (0-6 m.), underlain by a whole series of interdigitating strata comprising swamp/marine/ old beach deposits and terrestrial material (6-22 m.). Amongst these levels there appeared to be three separate periods of marine/swamp deposition. Underlying these was a continuous terrestrial layer from 22 m. to 27 m. at which point the drilling was terminated.21 Borehole 6 was drilled very close to the north bank of the river with the intention of investigating in greater detail the past relationship between the river and the sea, reaching a depth of 37 m. in total. After an initial 4-5 m. of sand, clay and silt deposits, the core was dominated by extensive deposits of swampy/ marine material which continued in one unbroken sequence down to 25 m. Amongst the marine material were found organic remains, large numbers of shells and, at a depth of 19 m., a piece of wood.22 After a short interlude of ter- restrial deposits between 25 m. and 29 m. there was more marine/swampy mate- rial between 30-34 m., underlain by a final terrestrial level including large pebbles. The results from this borehole suggest that there had been strong marine incursions on this side of the river, a finding which was borne out by the stratigraphy in Borehole 7. The location chosen for Borehole 7 was near the present 10 m. contour on a direct line between the two cultural mounds in the delta (Htiyiicektepe and Yeni Yeldegirmentepe), c. 1 km. northwest of the river. The choice of this particular drilling spot was designed not only to create a profile of the delta between the two mounds (Fig. 3), but also because the findings in the previous boreholes had prompted a working hypothesis that the present 10 m contour would be a guide to past shorelines (Fig. 8). The findings of Borehole 7 appear to be consistent with this reconstructed palaeocoastline, although they are not sufficient to prove its existence. This borehole produced evidence for a swampy zone underneath the layers of topsoil and terrestrial deposits. Below this topmost 4.5 m. of purely terrestrial deposits were found several strata of swampy/marine deposits interdigitating with terrestrial/fluvial material (from 4.5 m. to 20 m.). As with Borehole 6, the results from the present borehole supported the model of a marine transgression reaching as far as 2 km. into the delta on the north side of the river by the time of the middle Holocene, when the rapid rise in relative sea level at BeSik Bay in the Troad and at Dat9a on the west coast of Anatolia is generally agreed to have slowed or stopped (Kayan 1988: fig. 4; 1991: fig. 5), although this has yet to be proven for the Altinova area. 21A notable find from this borehole was c. 10 grams of slag at a depth of 11 m. (probably not in situ). Although no further details are available at the present time, analysis may shed light upon metalworking activity in the delta. 22The organic remains discovered in this borehole are currently under analysis in the Ege University in Izmir and will be presented in a later report. 188</page><page sequence="23">THE MADRA CAY DELTA I s / I Ankara University Site AEGEAN B\ SEA 0 3 kms Palaeogeographic map of the Madra 4ay delta BH3 I Fig. 8.

SUMMARY AND PROSPECTS Combining the evidence of all seven boreholes, it is tempting to reconstruct a palaeocoastline that may have existed in the middle Holocene, as shown in Fig. 8. In this reconstruction, the site of Yeni Yeldegirmentepe, represented by Borehole 4, would most probably have been located on the shoreline when it was occupied in the EBA. According to the same reconstruction, the site of Hiiyiucektepe (which now lies c. 4 km. from the sea), represented by Borehole 1, would also have been much closer to (but not actually on) the shore when occu- pied. Both mounds may have been settled originally as coastal habitation sites on the edge of swamps and lagoons, giving them access to fertile fields as well as marine resources. Huiyiicektepe may have been chosen because as a protruding knoll of bedrock it gave a stable base to those seeking to live in this coastal zone, and the widespread scatter of prehistoric sherds suggests that it was a location which proved popular with early settlers. The location of Yeni Yeldegirmentepe is reminiscent of the promontory sites common in the EBA both in Anatolia (eg. Mitten 1968: 6-10; Mitten and Yiigrum 1971: 191-5; 1974: 22-32) and the Aegean (Renfrew 1972: fig. 14.15, pl. 14; Coleman 1977: pl. 47a-b).

Analysis still to be carried out during 1996 will utilise the cultural material found in the boreholes (shell and charcoal) for C14 analysis in order to establish absolute chronologies for both the geomorphological sequences revealed in 1995 and for the archaeological deposits that will be uncovered in 1996. The project will employ OSL (optically-stimulated-luminescence) dating of the sediments. In 1996 the fieldwork will comprise archaeological survey in addition to further geomorphological work, with the aim of verifying the reconstructed palaeocoastline shown in Fig. 8 as well as the aim of defining in greater detail the stratigraphy of both mounds. Archaeological fieldwork will be started also, elucidating the spatial patterning of surface artefacts on the mounds in addition to a detailed examination of the wider, regional settlement patterns by surveying in the foothills at the back of the Madra Cay delta. In this survey, special refer- ence will be made to those areas where the 1995 geological survey detected exposed Neogene formations, representing land surfaces of great antiquity. 6. APPENDIX: THE CLASSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF THE MADRA CAY DELTA (Fig. 9) The extended debate since the early nineteenth century among cartogra- phers and topographers concerning the location of particular ancient sites in the Madra Cay delta demands a brief review of their analyses and conclusions, which is presented here as a supplementary discussion. The two best-documented ancient sites said to be in the general area of the Madra Cay delta were Atarneus and Attea, together with three more minor set- tlements of Karene, Malene and Astyra. Another site, Herakleia, lay just beyond the northern edge of the delta (possibly at Catmak, see p. 171 above), above which was another Mytilenean village, Koryphantis, and a polls named Kisthene (both northeast from modern Ayvalik, see Str. 13.1.51; Wiegand 1904: 260-62 and general map; Sakkaris 1920: map at end; Leaf 1923: 254, 266-7 and general map; Meyer 1925: 106-7 and map 4; D6rpfeld 1928: fig. 32; 1929: map 1; Kontis 1978: figs 4, 6, 8, 21-30). To the south, the nearest sites were two on the north- ern side of the Kara Dag (ancient Kane) promontory south of modern Dikili, Lysimachea and Kane (Pliny, NH. 5.32; cf. Conze et al. 1912: 118 and pl. I; Buisson 1917: 9). Atarneus ('Arapvevg) Atarneus is attested from the time of Herodotos (8.106.5) as the mainland city under the control of the Chians (said by Pausanias [4.35.10] to have been given to them by the Persians in return for handing over the Lydian Paktyes). Concerning its location, the ancient sources give many indications, although none allow a secure placing on a modern map. Strabo (13.1.67) listed the site as being south from the Mytilenean peraea villages (or komai) of Koryphantis and Herakleia, lying between Attea (see below) and Pitane. Skylax (98) indicated a similar sequence, cataloguing among the Greek cities in Mysia and Lydia, first, Adramyttium; second (further south), the Lesbian peraea; and third (further south still), that of the Chians, including the polls of Atarneus, before Pitane and the Kaikos River.23 And lastly, there are two further passages in Herodotos. 23A disputed passage in Xenophon (Anab. 7.8.8) gives similar general indications for the loca- tion of Atarneus, south of Adramyttium but north from the Kaikos plain. However, the phrase including the mention of Atarneus is sometimes omitted (as in the OCT). 190</page><page sequence="25">THE MADRA CAY DELTA Fig. 9. The Classical geography of the Madra Cay delta. Triangles = modern towns/villages, circles = ancient sites. Countours at 200 m. (Nigel Spencer). The first (Hdt. 6.28.1-2) clarifies that the plain of Atarneus lay directly opposite the town of Mytilene on the east shore of Lesbos (Spencer forthcoming), whilst the second (7.42.4) indicates that for a traveller heading north along this coast from the Kaikos River in the fifth century B.C., one passed Mount Kane on one's left and then went through the territory of Atarneus before reaching the city of Karene, the Plain of Thebe and Adramyttium (in that order). Other details, less informative geographically, include that of Herodotos (6.29.2), noting that a city named Malene was in the Atarneitan territory (see below); another of Pausanias (4.35.10) stating that the warms springs of Astyra "opposite Lesbos" were in the land of Atarneus (see below); Xenophon's (Hell. 3.2.11) and Diodorus' (13.65) comments that the site was in a naturally strong, fortified position; Pliny's reference (HN. 5.32, 37.56) that in his time the city qua city (oppidum) had ceased to exist, surviving only as a pagus; and a number of apparently derivative late/post-antique citations noting simply that Atarneus was a city (a polis or polichnion) in Mysia opposite Lesbos, some of which suggested 191</page><page sequence="26">Table 1: The ancient sites of the Madra Qay delta: summary of modern identifications.

'Aapva; Suda, s.v. 'ATapve?q). The attempts of modern scholars to locate the ancient city began with Leake (1824: map), who placed Atarneus on the south edge of the delta at mod- ern Dikili (followed by Kiepert 1879: maps 2-3, 9; [undated] maps 4-5; and Ramsay 1890: map facing p. 104). Lolling, who reviewed both the historical and archaeological evidence for the site (1879), agreed that Atarneus should be sought in this area, suggesting that the literary references to Atarneus gave no room for doubt concerning where the city and its territory should be located: opposite Mytilene in the area of Dikili, a place in constant contact by ship with Smyrna, Mytilene and Ayvalik, and at a strategic exit point of the plain on the main road towards Pergamon, Soma and the upper Kaikos plain (ibid.: 5). Lolling focused upon the nearby ancient and Medieval ruins on the promi- nent hill of "Kale-Agili", 4 km. northeast from Dikili (ibid.: 6-9). Both Lolling, and a number of other scholars who have since visited this hill, reported remains comprising long stretches of Medieval and ancient fortification walls (the latter including sections of polygonal and isodomic masonry); a possible sanctuary; a cistern; architectural blocks; and dense scatters of sherds including large num- bers of Hellenistic pieces, grey ware sherds with grooved and "scratched" deco- ration (some of which were compared by Dorpfeld with those he had examined from Troy VI), and some painted Archaic fragments (ibid.; Conze and Schuchhardt 1899: 144; Dorpfeld 1910: 395; 1928: 150; 1929a: 182-84; Conze et al. 1912: 119-22; Leaf 1923: 327; Bayne 1963: 228). Lolling's initial identification of Kale-Agili was followed on the numerous (slightly revised) subsequent maps of Kiepert (1885: section 5; 1889a: maps 4-5; 1894: maps 4-5; 1894a: maps 7-9; 1908: maps 7-9), that of Philippson (1910: general map), in the Altertimer team's regional survey (Conze et al. 1912: 59, 119-21 and pl. I), in Buisson's detailed discussion (1917: 17-21, esp. 18 n. 34), by Leaf (1923: 327, with slightly less confidence), Meyer (1925: figs 4-5), Bayne (1963: 228 and fig. 16) and Magie (1975: 41 and n. 19 p. 794). Dorpfeld, however, proposed a radically different classical geography for this coastline (1910: 395-9; 1928; 1929; 1929a), largely through his siting of ancient Pitane north of Kara Dag (ibid., all references), even though the presently-accepted location of Candarll had already been accepted universally by Kiepert ([undated]: maps 4-5; 1879: map 5; 1894: map 5; 1894a: maps 7-9; 1908: maps 7-9), Conze and Schuchhardt (1899: 144), the Altertimer team (1912: 99-100), Buisson (1917: 21-24) and Leaf (1923: 329; cf.

The consequences for Dorpfeld's more northerly location of Pitane were numerous: he was forced to push Atarneus further north also, onto the hill of Kosakly-Tepe/Agios Ilias northeast of Makaron (iftlik instead of the Kale-Agili site further southeast (D6rpfeld 1928: 138-9), associating the latter site with the Attalia of the Peutinger Table (ibid.: 149-51 and figs 32-33; 1929: 64-5 and map 1; 1929a: 182-4 and map 3); Karene therefore disappeared from where some had placed it hitherto (on Kosakly-Tepe/Agios Ilias, see below), and to precisely where it should be moved remained unclear (1928: figs 32-33; 1929: map 1; 1929a: map 3); the ancient site of "Atarneus below Pitane" was placed at Makaron Ciftlik, meaning that the coastline in this latter area had to be seriously remodelled (1910: 395-99; 1928: 140-44; 1929a: 179-80 and see p. 173 above) and substantial licence taken with Strabo's text (ibid., esp. 1928: 140 and 1929a: 179-80). For good measure, D6rpfeld even renamed the Madra Cay as the ancient Euenos rather than the previously-(and presently-)accepted name of the Gryllios, thereby locating Homeric Lyrnessos in the vicinity at the edge of 193</page><page sequence="28">ANATOLIAN STUDIES the Madra Cay delta (1910: 399; 1928: 144-8; 1929: map 1; 1929a: 181-2 and map 3; contra this association of the river with the Euenos see Kiepert 1879: map 9; 1889: 301-03 and pl. 5; 1894a: map 9; 1908: map 9; Philippson 1910: general map; Conze et al. 1912: pl. I; Buisson 1917: 24-7; Sakkaris 1920: map at end; Leaf 1923: 307, 325, 332; Kontis 1978: figs 4, 6, 8-30). Given that D6rpfeld's geography for the area has been widely rejected (see esp. Buisson 1917; cf. Robert 1962: 172 n. 6),24 the most logical location for the site of Atarneus pending further research remains the hill of Kale-Agili. First and foremost, this placing fits with the general indications given by the literary sources: a naturally-strong position, opposite Lesbos, on the route from the Kaikos north towards Adramyttium, south of the Lesbian peraea, but north from Pitane and Mount Kane. Second, the archaeological remains on the Kale- Agili hill of a fortified city of Archaic-Hellenistic date, are broadly in agreement with the dating of the city suggested by the historical texts. And third, such a location (rather than Dorpfeld's proposed site further north) quite simply also allows a much more reasonable spacing between the other sites known to be in Madra Cay delta (which were all extremely cramped in Dorpfeld's reconstruc- tions, 1928: figs 32-33; 1929: map 1; 1929a: map 3). Attea ("A rea) The ancient site of Attea is attested solely by Strabo (13.1.51) and in Menippus of Pergamum's Periplus (Robert 1962: 173 and n. 7, citing Mfiller 1855: 564 1.15).25 Its name was associated by some early commentators with "At(t)al(e)ia",26 a city mentioned by Pliny (NH. 5.126), Stephanus of Byzantium (s.v. 'ATrdXata) and listed in this general area in Peutinger Table and the Ravenna Cosmography (Kiepert [undated]: maps 4-5; 1879: maps 3, 9; Radet 1887: 169; Conze and Schuchhardt 1899: 145-6; Leaf 1923: 268; Dorpfeld 1928: 149-51, figs 32-33; 1929: map 1; 1929a: 182-4 and map 3; Robert 1962: 172-3). Some scholars cited as support of Strabo's reading (Attea) a number of coins of Roman Imperial date bearing the legend "ATTAITQN" or "ATTAEITf2N" (Biirchner 1895: 2154-5; Leaf 1923: 268, 328; Dorpfeld 1928: 149; 1929a: 181), but Robert (1962) showed conclusively that this coinage could not be associated with a site on the Mysian coast. The city which minted the coins, argued Robert, had been "Attaos", lying inland between Melde (ancient Miletopolis) and Balikesir (ancient Hadrianoutherai), probably near Makestos in the eastern part of the Balikesir plain (ibid.: 192-94, 411-13). The scholar admitted, how- ever, that the inland location for the origin of this coinage was an entirely different problem to that concerning the identification of Strabo's and Mennipus' coastal city of "Attea" (ibid.: 174), and it is upon the latter issue which we focus here. The evidence from Strabo's text (13.1.51) gives the following order of sites on the Mysian coast (from north to south): the Mytilenean villages of Koryphantis and Herakleia, Attea, Atarneus, Pitane and the mouth of the 24Dorpfeld's classical geography elsewhere in the Aegean was equally erroneous. eg. The Troad (Cook 1973: 43, 89, 111 n. 6, 170 n. 2, 172-4, 196), and in the Peloponnese, where Dorpfeld located Nestor's Pylos at Kakovatos in Elis rather than in Messenia at Ano Englianos (Spencer forthcoming, a). '5Robert (loc. cit.) cited Muller as his source for Menippus' text, despite the fact that Muller preferred to read "Aigaea" rather than "Attaea". For the reading of "Attaea" here see Diller 1952: 147-50, 163-4 (where Mennipus' writing is dated to the Augustan period). 26Ramsay (1890: 105) equated Attea with the "Tianai" or "Tiarai" of the Notitiae and Hierokles. 194</page><page sequence="29">THE MADRA CAY DELTA KaYkos, suggesting a location for the city on the coast in the Madra Cay delta, possibly towards its southern end (see Cook 1973: fig. 2 for Strabo's reconstruc- tion). Menippus' description indicates a similar general position for Attea, with the heading of one section reading "Voyage from Kan(n)e or Attaia to Adramyttium" (quoted in Robert 1962: 173; cf. Diller 1952: 156). Wherever one decides that Atarneus should be placed (see above), the com- bined evidence from both texts indicates that Attea should lie at some point in the Madra Cay delta between the Sarmosak promontory (near to which Koryphantis and Herakleia appear to have lain) and the Kara Dag (Mount Kane) promontory (on the south coast of which ancient Pitane is to be found). This conclusion immediately leaves only a finite number of ancient sites near the coast so far discovered which can be equated with Attea: the Mal-Tepe (possibly modern Yeni Yeldegirmentepe) knoll near Altinova; that of Hiiyiicektepe nearby, on the south side of the Madra Cay; the remains on the "Assar-Kaya"/ Ta$agil hill reported by Schuchhardt; and the Kosakly-Tepe/Agios Ilias acropo- lis. Of these sites, Mal-Tepe/Yeni Yeldegirmentepe was that proposed for Attea originally by Biirchner and accepted by Conze, Schuchhardt and Dorpfeld (Btirchner 1895: 2155; Conze et al. 1912: 111, 122; Dorpfeld27 1928: 149 and map 1; 1929a: 181 and map 3).28 It is important to remember also that the pre- sent project's 1995 work has shown that at some point during antiquity it seems both this tell and Hiiyiicektepe were coastal or near coastal sites (see above), as the texts of Menippus and Strabo demand. Heinrich Kiepert (1894: map 5; 1894a: maps 7-8; 1908: maps 7-8), his son Richard (1909: 3) and Philippson (1910: 93 and general map) placed Attea further south, however, northeast from Makaron Ciftlik on the Agios Ilias/Kosakly Tepe hill,29 a location favoured by Sakkaris (1920: map at end), Leaf (1923: 268, 328-9) and Meyer (1925: 106 and map 4) over the Mal-Tepe site. Until the present project's more systematic archaeological fieldwork has been completed, it is difficult to support decisively one proposed location for ancient Attea over another. The literary texts indicate that the site lay in the Madra (ay delta, north of the Mount Kane (Kara Dag) promontory, with Herakleia to its north and Atarneus to the south. In this area, perhaps the most likely ancient site already known (if Atarneus is to be associated with Kale- Agili) would be the next site to the north on the Kosakly-Tepe/Agios Ilias hill, but further exploration is required before this can be confirmed since other important sites may as yet lie undetected. The three remaining ancient sites in the region, Karene, Malene and Astyra are difficult to pin down geographically since all are less well-attested. Karene (Kapr4vR) In the early fifth century B.C. a polls of Karene lay on the route north from the Kaikos to Adramyttium (Hdt. 7.42.4). The city later gave help to the Ephesians (Ephor., 126.5; St.Byz. s.v. B?vvca and Kotpivr) and may have been 27Originally D6rpfeld seems to have placed Attea elsewhere, possibly at Kosakly-Tepe, but the precise location on the map in question (1910: fig. 10) is unclear. 28In the earlier survey by Schuchhardt (Conze and Schuchhardt 1899: 146), it is probable that the site equated with Attea is Mal-Tepe, but is impossible to be sure because the author simply refers to remains "1.5 hours from Atarneus" as the location of this ancient city without offering a precise location. 29For the suggestion that H. Kiepert had once equated Attea with the remains at "Assar- Kaya" further north see. n. 4. 195</page><page sequence="30">ANATOLIAN STUDIES among those attacked by Antiochus in 190 B.C. (Meyer 1925: 106-7),30 but had disappeared by the Roman Imperial period, at which time Pliny (NH. 5.32) listed Karene as one of those cities in the area (between Atarneus and Kisthene in Pliny's sequence) which had ceased to exist. Some of the early German sur- veyors equated the site with the acropolis of Kosakly-Tepe (Conze et al. 1912: 111, 122; Dirpfeld 1928: 139), but there remains no positive evidence for this association and Kiepert's suggestion (1879: maps 2, 9; 1889a: map 5; 1894: map 5; 1894a: maps 7-9; 1908: maps 7-9;31 followed by Meyer 1925: fig. 4) that it may lie further north near modern Altlnova and the Madra Cay (presumably on the Assar-Kaya/"Taschagyl" site already discovered by the late nineteenth cen- tury), is just as likely. Malene (Ma2,r4vr7) Malene is attested only once, by Herodotos (6.29.2; cf. Leaf 1923: 328), where it is named as a place within the territory of Atarneus (probably meaning, therefore, that it was a dependent settlement within the lands of the latter polis). Dorpfeld (1928: 132-6 and figs 32-3; 1929: map 1; 1929a: 178 and map 3) fol- lowed Thraemer in editing the name to "Malea", stating that Herodotos' word "Malene" was a term for the chora of a town known by the shorter name (in the same way as "Astyrene" was the term for the territory of "Astyra"), and placed Malea on the coast at Dikili (ibid.). Lolling (1879: 6) accepted the Herodotean form, arguing that Malene must lie on or near the shore near Kabakum or Makaronia, and although Kiepert originally located the site further inland near the Kale-Agili site (1879: map 9), later, like Lolling, he proposed a coastal location (Kiepert 1894a: map 9; 1908: map 9). Subsequently, Conze and Schuchhardt (1899: 145) rejected an association of Malene with the Agios Ilias/ Kosakly-Tepe acropolis, disbelieving that such impressive remains could be linked with Herodotos' obviously minor site, and in their later synthesis made no attempt to find a location for the site in the delta, concluding that the name was a corruption of nearby Karene (Conze et al.: 1912: 111 n. 1). Astyra ("Aarcvpa) Pausanias (4.35.10) spoke of a place32 named Astyra with warm springs opposite Lesbos in the area of Atarneus, the latter phrase making clear that this particular toponym was to be placed opposite the east coast of Lesbos, a differ- ent Astyra to that near Adramyttium further north (for which see Kiepert 1889: 297-9 and pl. 5; Leaf 1923: 254, 317-8, 321, 325 and general map; Bayne 1963: 274 and n. 320; Cook 1973: 267, n. 2 and fig. 2; for the Astyra lying opposite [ie. east from] Lesbos see Leake 1857: 13-4; Leaf 1923: 327). Lolling (1879: 6, 9-10) placed the more southerly Astyra in the vicinity of Dikili where hot springs were apparent, although the scholar also noted more springs in the foothills to the north (where Astyra was placed by Kiepert 1894a: map 8; 1908: map 8), whilst Meyer (1925: 107 and fig. 4) associated this town with the land of an Astyra mentioned in a territorial dispute arbitrated by Pergamum. 30Meyer's conclusion (1925: 107) that the "Crene" of Livy's text (37.21.4), if equated with Karene, must mean that the latter lay north of Attea, is difficult to follow. 31Kiepert (loc. cit., all refs.) always expressed the location of Karene with doubt ("?") on his maps. 3From Pausanias' text, it is unclear whether or not an actual settlement existed at the spot. 196</page><page sequence="31">THE MADRA CAY DELTA Abbreviations APA American Philological Association BAR British Archaeological Reports JFA Journal of Field Archaeology HSCP Harvard Studies in Classical Philology BIBLIOGRAPHY Andel, Th. van and Shackleton, J. 1982.
