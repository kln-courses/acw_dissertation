<plain_text><page sequence="1">TEST EXCAVATIONS AT THE LAKE JACKSON SITE JOHN W. GRIFFIN THIS PAPER gives the results of test ex- cavations conducted at the Lake Jackson site, Leon County, Florida by the Florida Park Service during the months of April and May, 1947.1 During this time systematic excavations were made in a portion of the village area lying in the vicinity of the large mounds for which the site is well known. These excava- tions were preliminary in nature, and it is hoped that they will be followed by more def- initive study. LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION The majority of the site is located on Lots 472, 473, 474 and 475 of Section 10, T 1 N, R 1 W, but Mound 1 lies north of this area, and Mounds 6 and 7 are east of the area in Section 11 (Fig. 36). The site is on the west side of McGinnis' Arm, the southern arm of Lake Jackson, about four and a half miles north-northwest of the center of the city of Tallahassee. Lake Jackson occupies a broad basin, which it does not always fill, and which it sometimes overflows. In the summer of 1948 Lake Jackson rose to heights which flooded U. S. Highway 90 west of the lake, but left the mounds and village area, which one would suspect would be subject to floods, quite dry. The location, then, was well chosen. To the west of the site bluffs rise rather sharply from roughly 100 feet above sea level to over 200 feet. It is in the half mile or less between these bluffs and the lake, on relatively level ground, that the site is located. The site is dominated by five large mounds, the arrangement of which may be seen in Figure 36. Mound 2 is the largest, measuring approximately 300 feet in diameter, with a pentagonal summit plateau almost exactly 100 feet across, is approximately 30 feet high. There are suggestions of a ramp on the east side of this mound. The other mounds are 1The writer wishes to thank E. M. Murphy, Jr., for his help as Field Assistant during the excavations, and Miss Lois Watkins, who acted as recorder during a por- tion of the time at the site. Mr. L. K. Ireland, owner of the portion of the site on which we worked, was most cooperative, and to him our hearty thanks are due. The site is numbered Ln 3 in the Florida Park Service survey. smaller, and like the large mound are flat topped. All of them apparently are capped with red clay mantles. At the present time the greater portion of Lots 472-475 are planted in pecan trees, al- though forest trees cover Mounds 2, 3, and 5, border the creek, and fill the area west of Mound 4. The summit and east side of Mound 4 have been cleared of vegetation. Mound 6 is in a clump of trees, but the area in Section 11, and to the north of the lots mentioned above is in improved pasture for dairy purposes. The planting of the pecan grove naturally disturbed the village area. PREVIOUS EXCAVATIONS There is considerable evidence of pot-hunt- ing activity at this site. Most of the mounds have holes dug into the tops, and there is a large trench gashed into the south side of Mound 2. The surface and the stream bed are combed regularly by boys from Tallahassee, but the site is so large that the damage to it has been comparatively slight. In 1940 Gordon R. Willey visited the site as part of the survey of the northwest Florida coast conducted under the joint auspices of Columbia University and the National Park Service by him and R. B. Woodbury. Two pits, 3 by 3 meters each, were dug in the loca- tions shown in Figure 36. Information on these test excavations is available. (Willey, 1940, and 1949, pp. 95-99; Willey and Woodbury, 1942, p. 247 ff.) EXCAVATIONS Our own excavations were largely confined to the village area but certain tests were also conducted on the mounds. These will be sum- marized below. Mound 2. In the large gash on the southern side of Mound 2 a face was cleared from the summit plateau to the depth of five feet nine inches. The section revealed by this clearing was: Surface to 1'5"-Humus and clayey humus; 1'5" to 2'3"-Red clay (mantle); 2'3" to 4'3"-Mixed and banded loads of clay, loam and sandy loam (fill); 4'3" to 5'0"-Light clay (mantle); 5'0" to 5'9"-Black muck to base of face (fill). Thus there are obviously two build- ing stages represented in the face which was 99</page><page sequence="2">MOUND 1 CA. 500' N.

A humus layer had ac- cumulated over the last mound surface. Mound 4. The summit plateau of Mound 4 was cleared of brush, the area was staked out in five-foot squares, and the thin humus layer was shoveled off to reveal the hard-packed and sun-baked red clay mantle. The purpose of this clearing was to determine, if possible, the floor plan of the structure which had stood atop the mound. Seven possible post holes were discovered, but they gave no indication of plan. Deeper cutting, which might have been more successful, was not attempted be- cause of the hardness of the clay and the shortage of time at our disposal, the work being the last done during the investigation. The humus was thrown back over the cleared area. Village Area. A total of 87 five-foot squares was excavated in the village area of the site (Fig. 36). These were preceded by a series of small test holes to locate areas in which the cultural material seemed to be concentrated. All squares were excavated in arbitrary six inch levels, and the material so catalogued. In general the physical stratigraphy in the village area consisted of about 18 inches of dark loam atop white sand. Plowing, plant- ing and aboriginal pitting had seriously dis- turbed the occupation level or levels. In most cases it was impossible to distinguish pits until they appeared as intrusions into the undis- turbed levels of white sand or clay. All of these factors made any analysis of stratigraphy difficult. Future work at the site may, how- ever, be more successful, now that certain of the problems involved are recognized. Certain features, aside from dark pits with refuse material in them, did occur at the site, although none of them told a very lucid story. In two places rather large areas of white marly clay, with charcoal-flecked upper surfaces, were found. At first it was suspected that these were house floors, but they no longer re- tained enough form to definitely establish them as such. One, in squares 50L17 and 55L17, was about 3'6" by 7'0" in size, and had three potential post holes on its southern and eastern margins. The other, in squares 50L6 and 50L7 was approximately 5 feet square. The nearest possible post holes were about 10 feet away in square 40L5. A third area, heavily flecked with burned clay and charcoal about one foot beneath the surface, was of a size to suggest, a small house. This area, roughly rectangular, virtually cov- ered six squares, and was about 10 by 15 feet in size. The squares involved were 45, 45R1, 45R2, 50, 50R1, and 50R2. The relation of these various areas to the ceramic picture at the site will be discussed in a later section of this report. In two places, squares 65L5 and 75L5, small areas of charred rush were discovered. Whether this represented basketry and/or matting is not known. Throughout the excavations areas of charcoal, dark pits, burned clay flecks, and po- tential post holes were found, but in no case could any interpretation be placed upon them that would illuminate problems of structure and use. Presumably the plowing, plant- ing, and pitting mentioned earlier had been too extensive to permit adequate preservation of information. It was noted, however, that the charcoal and burned clay flecking usually oc- curred about one foot beneath the surface. South of the -5 line a series of test pits were put in at intervals all the way to square -150L9 (Fig. 36). All of these were either completely or relatively sterile, and con- tained sand rather than the darker loam. These tests may be summarized as follows: Square -25L9, 15 sherds-Sand to base of level 3 (18"); -50L9, no sherds-Sand to base of level 3; -75L9, 4 sherds-Sand to base of level 3; -100L9, no sherds-Sand above, clay at 18"; -125L9, no sherds-Sand above, clay at 12"; -150L9, no sherds-Sand above, clay at 8". It will be noted that these squares have practically no cultural materials, are not heav- ily tinctured with organic materials, and that the farther south one goes, the nearer the clay is to the surface. Willey's Pit 1 was located about 200 feet east-southeast of square -150L9. As it hap- pened, this test was relatively sterile. His consolidated level of sandy clay with charcoal flecks, found at .45 meters (about 16"), prob- ably corresponds to the clay mentioned in the squares excavated by us. It will be remem- bered that under this level Willey found clean white sand and then more clay with traces of charcoal. Our own tests did not continue downward to check this feature. The relative sterility of these test squares, both Willey's and our own, suggests an area with little or no actual occupation.

It is suggested that this was a plaza area on which debris was not permitted to accumulate. Further testing at the site would probably establish more fully the village plan. FOOD REMAINS Food remains were scarce at the Lake Jack- son site, and the few bones which were found were in poor condition. Undoubtedly the soil at the site was not conducive to good preserva- tion. Deer bones were by far the most nu- merous finds, but a few bird and turtle bones were also found, as was a small amount of badly disintegrated freshwater (?) shell. The Fort Walton Period is known to extend into early historic times, and the references to intensive maize agriculture contained in early accounts of the region may be applied to the Fort Walton Period with little possibility of error. The evidence from the site is sufficient to indicate that hunting supplemented agri- culture in the economy. ARTIFACTS Clay pipes. One nearly complete clay pipe and fragments of fifteen others came from the excavations. The nearly complete pipe (Fig. 38, 21), of equal arm type, is decorated with a rather elaborate design of small sharp punc- tations. The bowl section is rounded, while the shank is squared. Inside measurements of the bowl give a diameter of 18 mm, and a depth of 33 mm. Most of the other pipes were apparently about the same size and shape, although none of them show any sug- gestion of square shanks or bowls. Figure 38, 22 is a portion of an incised pipe bowl. Fig- ure 38, 18 is a scored bowl fragment, and Fig- ure 38, 20 is a portion of a pipe shank with some decoration and a lug, and may have come from the previous pipe or one similar to it. Figure 38, 19 shows a portion of a plain bowl with a lip lug reminiscent of those on vessels of Lake Jackson Plain pottery. Figure 38, 23 is the most atypical fragment of the lot, and is apparently part of a pipe of a quite dif- ferent type than those described above. The size of all of these pipes is small when compared with pipes from Weeden Island burial mounds. On the basis of size and quantity of pipes at this site it is suggested that smoking was not bound solely to the cere- monial aspects of life. Clay and stone discs. Nineteen clay discs, fashioned from potsherds, were found, three of which had very smooth edges (Fig. 38, 30). In size they range from 23 to 50 mm. in di- ameter, with the majority around 40 mm. Eleven similar discs of limestone occurred, dif- fering mainly from the clay ones in thickness. Whereas the clay discs averaged about 8 mm. in thickness, the stone ones range from 13 to 25 mm., with an average at about 20 mm. In diameter the stone discs range from 30 to 45 mm. One of the specimens has an incised groove across one face (Fig. 38, 29). Another, fragmentary, specimen was part of a perforated "doughnut-like" disc. Presumably these discs were gaming pieces of some kind. Discs of this kind occur in other Fort Wal- ton Period sites in northwest Florida, and also occur in the later Leon-Jefferson Period (Smith, 1948, p. 316). They are widespread in the Southeast at such sites as Charlotte Thompson Place and Thirty-Acre Field on the Alabama River (Moore, 1900, pp. 323 and 341), and the Nacoochee Mound in Georgia (Heye, Hodge and Pepper, 1918, pp. 72 and 80-82, P1. 43 and 51). They are undoubtedly related to the more finely finished stone spec- imens usually thought of as the discoidal com- plex associated with Middle Mississippi mani- festations. Projectile points. Chipped stone artifacts were rare, as for that matter were all artifacts. One complete and nine fragmentary specimens were found. The four examples which dis- close some evidence of form are shown in Figure 38, 24-27. It will be noted that no small triangular points were found, Figure 38, 27 being the closest approach to that form. Stone celts. Six fragments of greenstone celts were found. They were too incomplete to permit a description of celt form. Grinding stones. Seven fragments of flat sandstone grinding stones were found. These specimens have at least one very smooth sur- face, which tends to become concave on the more used examples. Sharpening stones. Five pieces of sandstone were found which displayed sharpening grooves, usually several on the same specimen. One would expect these to have been used for sharpening bone tools, but no bone tools were GRIFFIN] 103</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY found at the site. However, bone was poorly preserved at the site and tools made of it may have disappeared. Shell objects. An object of shell, 44 mm. long, 25 mm. wide and 15 mm. thick, with a bi-conoidal perforation, was found in the ex- cavations (Fig. 38, 28). A portion of a conch columella with a cut end was also found. In- cluded here, although not of shell, is an un- worked fossil crinoid stem. Lead bullets. Two lead bullets were found at the site. One of these was a musket ball found nine inches beneath the surface in one of the test holes. It measures approximately caliber .58, a common mid-nineteenth century size. The other is bullet shaped, about the same caliber, and possibly came from a nine- teenth century powder and ball paper cart- ridge. Both are almost certainly later in time than the aboriginal occupation, and deserve notice only because they were the only historic objects found beneath the surface. There was very little 'later debris on the surface of the site. POTTERY The following descriptions of pottery from the Lake Jackson site are based on 8,272 sherds, of which 7,771 came from the exca- vations in the village site. Inasmuch as Wil- ley's publication on the Florida Gulf Coast (Willey, 1949) contains pottery type descrip- tions, those defined by him will not be given in detail here. The comments in this section will serve mainly to identify the types as we see them at Lake Jackson and to note varia- tions, or "sub-types," utilized in the analysis of the Lake Jackson material. The vast majority of the sherds are tem- pered with rather coarse grit, although some sand tempering also occurs. The ware tends to be coarser and more contorted than in earlier periods in the area. The few examples of shell tempering are, of course, not to be included in these comments. Fort Walton Incised. The name was first applied and a brief description given by Wil- ley and Woodbury, and three sub-styles were noted (Willey and Woodbury, 1942, p. 244). A more complete description has been given by Willey, and sub-style 3 of the previous de- scription has been dropped and made into an- other type, Point Washington Incised (Willey, 1949, p. 463). In general the type description fits the specimens from Lake Jackson. It may be noted that the vast majority of the sherds so typed from the Lake Jackson site were of rectilinear figures filled with punctates, and that stylized anthropomorphic or zoomorphic figures with punctations sparingly used were not present, although it must be recognized that these would be more difficult to recognize on sherds than on vessels. For our purposes, two divisions were made in this type. Sub-type A consists of those sherds in which punctates fill incised outlines. In addition sherds covered with punctates, but with no bordering lines visible, were classed as Fort Walton Incised A on the assumption that they were most probably background fill- ing, an assumption strengthened by the appar- ent absence of any over-all punctated types. A representative sample may be seen in Figure 37, 11-15. Sub-type B consists of sherds in which the design is executed solely by incision (Fig. 37, 17-18). In the major sample of 7,771 sherds there are 211 of sub-type A and 13 of sub-type B. Safety Harbor Incised. The brief descrip- tion in Willey and Woodbury (1942, pp. 244- 245) covers both Safety Harbor Incised and Pinellas Incised as they are now defined by Willey (1949, p. 479). The few sherds, only 21 out of the sample of 7,771, that are classi- fied as Safety Harbor Incised from Lake Jack- son are at the sand tempered end of the paste range given by Willey. In some instances it is difficult to distinguish between Safety Harbor Incised and Fort Walton Incised, and there may be some error in our classification. Sherds from the site are shown in Figure 38, 6-7. Pinellas Incised. Pinellas Incised as defined by Willey (Willey, 1949, p. 482) has a paste range like that for Pinellas Plain and Safety Harbor Incised. That is to say it ranges from a compact sand tempered paste, through one with medium-coarse sand, to a clayey, pos- sibly temperless, paste that is laminated and crumbly. Pinellas Incised at the Lake Jack- son site is of the coarsely tempered variety, and there is none of the clayey variety. In fact, in many instances the paste is indistinguish- able from Fort Walton Incised, although taken as a whole the Pinellas Incised inclines toward a more contorted paste and a lumpier surface, i.e., is generally cruder. 104 [2, 1950</page><page sequence="7">TEST EXCAVATIONS AT THE LAKE JACKSON SITE FIG. 38.

GRIFFI N ] 105 1 8;</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY For purposes of analysis we divided this type into three sub-types based on design. The number of sherds in each case is of the 7,771 sample. Sub-type A, 72 sherds, has a single line arcade encircling the vessel, with punc- tations bordering the arcade (Fig. 37, 1-2). Sub-type B, 191 sherds, has parallel lines en- circling the vessel rim (Fig. 37, 4-7), and is sometimes combined with sub-type A (Fig. 37, 3). Lip notching is frequent and lugs-and handles as on Lake Jackson Plain are not uncommon. Sub-type C, 23 sherds, has volutes and miscellaneous motifs, with some of the volutes pendant from lines as in sub-type B (Fig. 37, 8-10). Lake Jackson Plain. A brief description oc- curs in Willey and Woodbury (Willey and Woodbury, 1942, p. 245), and a fuller one in Willey (Willey 1949, pp. 458-460). The ma- jority of the Lake Jackson Plain sherds from the Lake Jackson site are coarsely tempered, contorted and lumpy surfaced. In this respect they are very like the paste of Pinellas In- cised at this site, and somewhat unlike Fort Walton Incised. This is important since Wil- ley's over-all type description has Fort Walton Incised with the same paste as Lake Jackson Plain, and also has Safety Harbor Incised with the same paste as Pinellas Incised. Lake Jackson Plain is defined on the basis of rim sherds and appendage sherds; associ- ated body sherds are placed in the residual plain category. In our analysis four sub-types were used, as follows: Sub-type A. 21 pinched rims (Fig. 37, 19). Sub-type B. Characterized by nodes placed on the rim, 45 sherds (Fig. 37, 20). Sub-type C. Characterized by han- dles, both loop and strap, and some with nodes on the handle, 74 sherds (Fig. 37, 21- 23). Sub-type D. Notched lips and miscel- laneous features, 52 sherds (Fig. 37, 24-30). Lake Jackson Fingernail Impressed. This is a tentative type based on six sherds, which, however, are all from different vessels. The paste is the coarse, lumpy kind noted above for Lake Jackson Plain and Pinellas Incised. The decoration consists of large punctations applied with the fingernail and tip of the finger, and cover the entire area of each sherd seen. On one specimen an incised line is seen at one edge. Two of the sherds are rim sherds, one has a flattened lip and the other one is sharply rounded. The sherds would seem to indicate rather deep vessels with slightly outflaring rims. Specimens of this tentative type are shown in Figure 38, 14- 15. Marsh Island Incised. Willey has named this type and given a brief description of it, based on very limited data (Willey, 1949, p. 466). The following description is based on Willey's remarks and 102 sherds from the Lake Jackson site. The ware characteristics are as in Lake Jackson Plain. Decoration is by in- cision, fine to medium-bold in sub-types A and B and bold in sub-type C. These sub-types are divided as follows: Sub-type A. Filled tri- angles and sometimes chevrons, 16 sherds (Fig. 38, 2-3). Sub-type B. Vertical parallel lines, 20 sherds (Fig. 38, 1). Sub-type C. Di- agonally placed parallel lines, 66 sherds (Fig. 38, 4-5). Sub-types A and B have the design confined to a band on the upper part of the vessel; in sub-type C this may extend farther down on the body. Open bowls and am- phoras with some neck constriction and slight- ly flaring rims are forms suggested by the sherds. Several rim sherds decorated on the inside suggest either plate forms or flaring rims. Rims are either outflaring or incurving de- pending upon vessel shape, and most rims are thinned although the opposite does occur. Loop handles are present in sub-type C. Alachua Cob-marked. There were ten sherds from the site which may be classified as Alachua Cob-marked, a type defined by Goggin (Goggin, 1948, p. 3). Six of these vary from the type description in having yel- lowish-tan outer surfaces. One specimen has a strap handle, sharply angled (Fig. 38, 9). Red-filmed sherds. No type name is given the nine sherds which displayed red filming on one of their surfaces. One of these was apparently painted on the outside, the re- mainder were very definitely painted on the inside. The paste is like that of the majority of the sherds at the site. Check-stamped pottery. A total of nine check-stamped sherds was noted. These are all marked with rectangular checks with the lands on the long side of the rectangles more prominent than the cross lands (Fig. 38, 13). Check size ranges from 2 to 7 mm. in the long dimension. The four rim sherds in the group have the stamping applied diagonally to the lip. 106 [2, 1950</page><page sequence="9">TEST EXCAVATIONS AT THE LAKE JACKSON SITE Jefferson Stamped. Three small sherds of Jefferson Stamped type C were found (Smith, 1948, p. 317, P1. 32h). There was also one Jefferson-like, rim sherd. Brushed pottery. There were six sherds with brushed outer surfaces. Some of these are similar to, but not identical with, Chat- taboochee Brushed as now defined (Bullen, 1950, p. 103). Shell tempered pottery. Twelve sherds of shell tempered pottery were found at the site. Ten of these were plain and two were incised. One of the incised sherds is marked with a single straight line. The other has a straight rim with lip notching, and the apparent globu- lar body has parallel diagonal incised lines (Fig. 38, 8). These sherds may probably be classified as Pensacola Plain and Pensacola Incised (Willey, 1949, pp. 463-464). Miscellaneous decorated. There were over 150 sherds which were grouped into a cate- gory of miscellaneous decorated. Almost all of these are specimens in which fragmentary incised lines are visible on the sherd, but which cannot be placed in any type because of the incomplete nature of the evidence. Four of the more unusual examples are discussed here. Figure 38, 11 shows a finely incised sherd on a compact, fine sand tempered paste with flecks of mica visible on the surfaces. Figure, 38, 17, on a Fort Walton paste, is a por- tion of a bottleneck decorated with wavy lines. Figure 38, 16, on a coarse paste like Lake Jackson Plain and Pinellas Incised, is dec- orated with rows of hollow reed punctations. Figure 38, 10, on a sand tempered paste is somewhat reminiscent of Aucilla Incised of the Leon-Jefferson Period (Smith, 1948, p. 317). Residual Plain. In this category are grouped the vast bulk of sherds from the site. These are the plain body sherds of the types men- tioned above, particularly the more numerous types. The paste range covers that of the types Fort Walton Incised, Pinellas Incised and Lake Jackson Plain. DIVISION INTO CERAMIC GROUPS As analysis was undertaken it soon became apparent that there was little chance of ver- tical stratigraphy being disclosed by the tests. The plowing, planting and pitting had churned the deposit to the extent that stratig- raphy, if it had existed at the site, had become obscured. Therefore, an attempt was made to examine the materials from the point of view of horizontal distribution. A comparison of the two decorated types which occurred with the greatest frequency, Fort Walton Incised A and Pinellas Incised B, led one to suspect that they might not be contemporaneous. The paste of Fort Walton A tended toward the fine end of the range, while Pinellas Incised B tended toward the coarse. Nodes and handles, present on Pinel- las Incised B, were absent on Fort Walton In- cised A, while the opposite held true for the long folded rims. Lip notching was present on the Pinellas sherds, but not on the Fort Walton. With this suspicion of non-contem- poraneity in mind, an analysis was run with the two types serving as a basis. The contents of each excavated square in the village area were examined, and the numbers of the two types noted. It was found that there was great variation in the percentage ratio of the types to each other in these various squares. Expressed in terms of the percent of Fort Walton Incised A to a total combining Fort Walton Incised A and Pinellas Incised B, the following was found to be true: Number of Squares No. Ft. Walton A No. Pinellas B Percent of Ft. Walton A 0-19 20-39 40-59 60-79 80-100 11 14 23 19 15 1 35 64 61 50 18 77 63 30 3 This analysis, when plotted on a map of the excavated area as in Figure 39, suggested that there was some horizontal grouping of types in the ground since there were blocks of con- tiguous squares with similar type ratios. When this observation was made the various pot- tery types for each square were tabulated and grouped in five columns on the basis of the ratio of the two most common types. The results of this tabulation are given in Table 9. The percentages under the number of sherds in Table 9 are the percentage of that type found in each of the columns. It will be immediately noted that Fort Walton In- cised A and Pinellas Incised B disclose reversed trends, but this is to be expected since they are the types on which the table is based. Of more significance are some of the other types which show an association with these two types, and these will be discussed below. GRIFFIN ] 107</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY TABLE 9.

Associated rather strongly with Pinel- las Incised B are the types Pinellas Incised C, Lake Jackson Plain B and D, and Marsh Is- land Incised C. The rest of the types do not give clear cut suggestions of association. We have, therefore, tentatively defined two groups of pottery types from the Lake Jackson site which disclose some evidence in the form of horizontal distribution of being non-con- temporaneous complexes. A word of caution, to be reiterated later, may be inserted at this point. These groups are abstracted from the mass of material, and are not necessarily mu- tually exclusive; i.e., they do not necessarily represent two successive occupations with a time interval between. In fact, it seems more probable that what we have done is to abstract two points on a continuum. In either case, the evidence given above does not suggest which of the groups is earlier or later in time, and for a discussion of this we must pass on to another type of analysis. TYPOLOGICAL SERIATION Fort Walton Incised A, with its incised out- lines and punctate filling, resembles the tech- niques of Weeden Island Incised of the pre- ceding time period. It can be regarded as a descendant of this earlier type, and it will be remembered that it possesses the folded rims which are also found in Weeden Island pot- tery. Marsh Island Incised A and B, which correlate with the Fort Walton Incised A pot- tery, are quite obvious descendants of the type Carrabelle Incised of the Weeden Island Pe- riod. Of the entire group correlating with Fort Walton Incised A, Pinellas Incised A would seem to be the most divergent, but closer examination discloses a possible Weeden Island prototype. It will be remembered that Pinellas Incised A is characterized by punc- tate bordered arcades around the vessel. In certain Weeden Island Incised vessels figured by Moore we see arched areas repeating around the vessel, usually filled with cross- hatched or herringbone incision (Moore, 1901, Fig. 63; Moore, 1902, Figs. 29, 69, 75, 264; Moore, 1918, Fig. 4).

In summary, we can readily derive all of the types definitely associated with Fort Walton Incised A from Weeden Is- land types. On the other hand, neither Pinellas Incised B nor the types associated with it can be so de- rived. Certain of the types show a good re- lationship to one another, however. The same treatment of notched lips, nodes and handles occurs on Pinellas Incised and Lake Jackson Plain types, as well as on Marsh Island C. Pinellas Incised B and C may well be out- growths of the general tradition of Pinellas In- cised A. Marsh Island C may be an out- growth of the other Marsh Island Incised types. Looking at the period which follows Fort Walton we see some continuity into Leon- Jefferson times. Some of the Leon-Jefferson Period pottery called Fort Walton Incised by Smith (Smith, 1948, P1. 32 e) is really a con- tinuation of Pinellas Incised A. Aucilla In- cised (Smith, 1948, p. 317, P1. 32 a-d) appar- ently comes out of the Pinellas tradition, and some of the Lake Jackson Plain rims and lips remind one of the Jefferson rims. If one is looking for a time direction in the data suggested by the groups of pottery types, the obvious relation of one group to the earlier Weeden Island Period, and the greater simi- larity of the other group to the ensuing Leon- Jefferson Period would suggest that Fort Wal- ton Incised A and its associated types are earlier than Pinellas Incised B and its asso- ciated types. The few sherds collected during the clear- ing of the top of Mound 4 give some slight supporting evidence for this postulated se- quence. These sherds were one Pinellas In- cised A, one Pinellas Incised C, one Lake Jackson Plain B, one Lake Jackson Plain C, one miscellaneous incised, and four residual plain. This small group of sherds tends to- ward the postulated late end of our range, with the possible exception of the Pinellas In- cised A. EVIDENCE FROM OTHER SITES There is some evidence from other sites which suggests that the temporal interpreta- tion derived from typological seriation is the correct one, but it must be remembered when discussing these sites that they, like Lake Jackson, may not represent merely one end or the other of the time range, but may, rather, be mixed, a condition unlikely to have been noted in the excavations of C. B. Moore, from whom our data comes. The cemetery near Point Washington con- tained relatively little Fort Walton Incised A compared to other Fort Walton Incised and Point Washington Incised. There is also a Lake Jackson Plain D vessel. European goods were found at this site (Moore, 1901, pp. 472- 496). At a mound at Bear Point on Perido Bay, just across the state line into Alabama, Moore found no punctate filled Fort Walton Incised. The pottery is mostly Point Washington In- cised or non-punctated Fort Walton Incised. A considerable amount of trade goods was found at this site, including a coin identified as having been struck between 1521 and 1550 (Moore, 1901, pp. 423-432). Moore's mound near Chipola Cutoff con- tained both Weeden Island and Fort Walton materials. The Fort Walton material seems to be about equally divided between types as- sociated with both ends of the Lake Jackson range, and possibly covers the same time range as the Lake Jackson site. Some Euro- pean trade material was found at this site (Moore, 1903, pp. 445-466). At the Marsh Island site Moore found the bones of an infant in a Marsh Island Incised A vessel, covered with a Marsh Island Incised C vessel. A bracelet of sheet brass encircled each humerus. Other historic materials oc- curred with burials in the top portion of the mound; the lower portion was Weeden Island (Moore, 1902, pp. 274-281). Materials from a site in the St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge have been described by both Goggin and the author (Goggin, 1947 and Griffin, 1947). This site contains con- siderable European material. Only a few sherds giving indication of time period were found in the surface collections. Some of these indicated a possible Santa Rosa-Swift Creek and/or Weeden Island occupation, which would be too early for the historic goods. Four sherds of incised pottery were found which can be attributed to the Fort Walton Period; two of these are rather non- descript and the other two, called Fort Walton Incised in earlier reports, are in real- ity Pinellas Incised B.

Walton Incised sub-type A and Pinellas Incised sub-type B to each other. A rim sherds are also present. While the evi- dence is inconclusive and meagre, this site would seem to show an association between European goods and the late end of our range. At Jolly Bay Moore found very little Fort Walton Incised A, but Pinellas Incised B and C seem to have been rather common (Moore, 1901, pp. 459-465). No trade goods were found, but the site would seem to be toward the late end of the Lake Jackson range. The Fort Walton site itself yielded no trade goods. At this site there is a consider- able amount of Fort Walton Incised A, which with a Pinellas Incised A vessel would indi- cate the earlier part of our time range. In lesser quantity Pinellas Incised B and C were found (Moore, 1901, pp. 435-454). These scanty data would seem to indicate that in general the Fort Walton Incised A vessels are rare in sites containing trade goods, and that, conversely, Pinellas Incised vessels are rather common in these situations. This may be taken as supporting the postulation based on typological seriation. SUMMARY OF LAKE JACKSON SITE Analysis revealed that two groups of pot- tery types could be isolated at the Lake Jack- son site, although the division was not clear cut, and it was not possible to place all types in one group or the other. It is postulated that we have actually abstracted two points on a cultural continuum, rather than having iso- lated two distinct superimposed manifesta- tions. Unfortunately it is impossible to assign the few artifacts recovered to one or the other of these groupings, although in some cases they do add to the known complex for the Fort Walton Period in general. The site itself gives evidence of a large vil- lage possessing pyramidal mounds built in stages, and there is evidence of a plaza area between some of the mounds. No evidence of house form was recovered. Other sites discussed contained European trade goods in a context similar to the late end of the Lake Jackson time range, but no historic goods were found at Lake Jackson. Before attributing a prehistoric date to the site, how- ever, we should remember that Moore's infor- mation, as well as that from the St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge, comes from burial sites, whereas the Lake Jackson information comes from a village site excavation. It is entirely possible that in early contact days material might find its way into burial places and not appear in the village debris. The pos- 110 [2, 1950</page><page sequence="13">TEST EXCAVATIONS AT THE LAKE JACKSON SITE sibility that the Lake Jackson site extends into the historic period is particularly interesting in view of the fact that it is, on other grounds, one of the candidates for identification as Inia- hica, the chief village of the province of Apa- lachee, where De Soto wintered in 1539-40 (Swanton, 1939, p. 158). The Lake Jackson site is by far the largest in the area, which in- creases the possibility that it may have been the major Apalachee village of De Soto's time, but positive identification cannot be made at this time. THE FORT WALTON PERIOD The Fort Walton Period was defined by Willey and Woodbury in 1942, and covered the late prehistoric and early historic sites on the northwest Florida coast which follow the Weeden Island Period in time (Willey and Woodbury, 1942). Since this definition of the period, Hale G. Smith has defined the Leon- Jefferson Period in the same area to cover the sites of the Spanish mission era (Smith 1948). In terms of dating at present em- ployed Weeden Island ends at approxi- mately 1450 A. D. Fort Walton extends from this date until 1600 or later, and Leon-Jeffer- son runs from 1600 or 1650 to at least 1704, the date at which most of the settlements in the area were either destroyed by the British and their Creek Indian allies, or were aban- doned by the occupants because of the in- roads of these invaders. Of course, these datings must not be taken as absolute. Rather, the picture seems to be one of culture change in a more or less con- tinuous manner, with the archaeological pe- riods abstracted from the stream of change. Fort Walton is set apart from Weeden Is- land not only by different pottery types and artifacts, but by a series of more fundamental changes in the cultural tradition. Agriculture became more intensive, villages became larger, burial in mounds was largely abandoned and cemetery burial took its place, large earthen pyramidal mounds were constructed, and in general we see differences which reflect pro- found social and cultural changes. The source of these changes is to be found in the adjacent parts of the Southeast in the cultural tradi- tion which we know as Middle Mississippi. So long as we considered Fort Walton as a single block in the chronological chart, the differences between it and Weeden Island ap- peared to represent a rather sharp break, as compared for example with the differences between Weeden Island and the preceding Santa Rosa-Swift Creek Period. In fact, the break was almost sharp enough that move- ment of peoples into the area could be postu- lated without difficulty. The major contribution of the excavations at the Lake Jackson site was the suggestion of successive stages within the Fort Walton Period. As we have seen, the pottery of the earlier part of the time range can be derived from Weeden Island types, under the influ- ence of Mississippian ideas, and the later stage can be at least in part derived from the ear- lier, with perhaps stronger influences from Mis- sissippian centers at this time. A process of culture change can, therefore, be deduced from the Fort Walton data from Lake Jack- son. The transition from Fort Walton to Leon- Jefferson is not so well known, but we may suspect that it too is the result of continued culture change, perhaps accelerated by Span- ish missionization. At least it is certain that in the Tallahassee area most of the villages were occupied by lineal descendants of the Indians present in De Soto's time. A few sherds of Leon-Jefferson types were found at Lake Jack- son. While this paper has suggested stages within the period at the Lake Jackson site, caution should be exercised in extending the results to other sites any distance away. Lake Jack- son is in the territory of the Apalachee, which extended from the Aucilla River to the Och- lochnee. West of this latter river were several other Indian groups, and while, culturally, they seem to have been rather closely related, there may be areal differences which at the mo- ment escape otir notice. East of the Aucilla River lies Timucua territory, and the detailed picture in this area remains to be worked out. With the information contained in this paper at our disposal it should be possible to return to the Lake Jackson site with some knowledge of the conditions to be expected, and to work toward the solution of other problems which will result in fuller knowledge of the Fort Walton Period.2 2 See Willey, 1949, pp. 452-470, for an excellent sum- mary of the Fort Walton Period which appeared subse- quent to the preparation of this paper.

Florida Park Service Gainesville, Florida November, 1949 AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE BENHAM FALLS RESERVOIR, OREGON DOUGLAS OSBORNE 1 FEW of the smaller proposed or authorized reservoir sites examined by River Basin Sur- vey teams in the Northwest have yielded archaeological sites suitable for excavation. In 1This paper is published with the consent of the Smithsonian Institution. I wish to thank Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., for granting this permission. The pro- posed reservoir was surveyed during the last days of June and the first week of July, 1948, by George Coale (University of Southern California), Francis and Harry Riddell (University of California) and the writer, all employed by River Basin Surveys. The work was done in accordance with the "Memorandum of Understanding between the Smithsonian Institution and the National Park Service," approved October 9, 1945. The survey parties were aided by maps supplied by the U. S. Forest Service Office, Bend, Oregon. some of them, however, the surveying parties have found extensive surface indications and made collections which are in themselves worthy of study and reporting. The Benham Falls Reservoir is in this latter class; indeed, it is the only reservoir area in which no sites were found which warranted excavation and yet which exhibited extensive evidence of abori- ginal use and yielded a fair surface collection. Consequently the data which resulted from the survey work are sufficient to justify their being made generally available. This is seen to be doubly true when it is recalled that no previous work has been done in the area. This region under study lies in Deschutes County, some 18 miles south of Bend.
