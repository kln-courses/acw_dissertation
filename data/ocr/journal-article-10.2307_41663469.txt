<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SCULPTURE OF THE HELLENISTIC AGE, by Margarete Bieber, xii, 232 pages, 714 figures. Columbia University Press, New York 1955 $17.50 The progress of archaeology into more specialized fields has left few modern, comprehensive yet scientific histories of later Greek and Roman art written in English. In Roman archae- ology our best general histories, those of the late Eugenie Strong, were writ- ten thirty or more years ago. Miss Bieber has added another laurel to her , i SYMBOL of the BEAST The Animal-Style Art of Eurasia Dagny Carter. Newly-published, absorbing ,&lt;rhis hook h a vd¡uMe account of the vividly distinctive animal- contribution in this style art which flourished for thousands of hitherto little explored years among ancient Siberian tribes before £e¡¿ jts provocative being modified by the anthropomorphic art and challenging subject forms of Buddhism and Christianity. Clearly ^as never before been outlining what is known of the life and cul- presented as ture of these peoples, the book reaches into comprehensively in one prehistory to clarify the meaning and origin volume ' " of this art. Brilliant illustrations bring to A1£ , ' c , life the most important objects found to Professor TAlfred A1£ , of SfmoQy&gt; c , date - many of which are strongly reminis- Professor of cent of many contemporary art trends. 48 ills.; York Hr ^ü' ' ^ew 204 pp. 71/4 X 10y4. $8.50 York University Through Bookstores or from: L== THE RONALD PRESS COMPANY • 15 E. 26th St..

Besides twelve chapters which pre- sent Hellenistic sculpture from its an- tecedents in the fourth century B.c., through the traditional arrangement of geographical "schools" and rococo trends in the third and second centuries B.c., and into the classicism of the cen- tury before Augustus, the book con- tains a Chronology of Historical Facts and Dated Works of Art, an extensive Selected Bibliography, a full Index, and a List of Plates in which titles by subject groupings and all photograph sources are given. These features are mentioned because they serve to make the book a veritable encyclopedia of scholarship in this field during the cen- tury since Johann Gustav Droysen coined (1833) the word "Hellenistic," meaning late Greek. In a short review of such an impor- tant work it is perhaps petty to com- ment on the quality and labeling of the photographs. If every scholar withheld his publishable material until better photographs became available, a book such as Miss Bieber' s would be subject to even longer delays in appearing. However, even the casual critic will be struck by the superiority of many of the illustrations and the inferior, dated quality of others. For example, Figures 54, 56 and 57 show the Fogg Art Mu- seum Meleager in the old Hunt Hall setting rather than in the present build- ing, constructed nearly thirty years ago. It seems a shame that Replica C (Bulle) of the so-called Pothos of Skopas, with its alien head, appears as Figure 62, rather than Replica A, also in the Uffizi Gallery, or Replica D, dis- covered just before the war in Rome, in the Via Cavour. The Vatican-Uffizi- Duncombe Park mastiff (Figure 660) is hardly a "bulldog." Miss Bieber' s other writings of re- cent years have revealed her great in- terest in the treasures of American mu- seums, especially the smaller Classical collections (Cleveland, Princeton, To- ledo, etc. ) , in relation to the better known show-pieces of Europe. This in- terest is manifest in the number of American examples which are included in her new book. American collections continue to increase their holdings of major masterpieces in the Hellenistic field. The heretofore conjectured head of Achilles in the Achilles and Penthe- silea group, reconstructed by Giuseppe Lugli from scattered fragments (pages 79f.) is probably represented by a head which passed recently from London to the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, California. The head suits Lugli's re- construction admirably. The Getty Mu- seum has also acquired a fine though headless replica of the so-called Tro- phos in Florence, a standing woman in a pose which led Arthur Milchhöfer to include her at the left of his reconstruc- tion of the celebrated Niobid groups in Florence and elsewhere (Bieber, Figure 263). The Metropolitan Museum now displays the handsome and somewhat enigmatic bronze rider in elephant-skin cap and cloak (Figure 298) suggested as Demetrios of Bactria but perhaps representing Alexander the Great as he appears on coins struck by Ptolemy Soter, who ruled Egypt in the name of Alexander's son towards the end of the fourth century b.c.
