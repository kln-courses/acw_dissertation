<plain_text><page sequence="1">1. Wooden box with ivory inlays found in Shaft Grave V at Mycenae. Late Helladic I. By HELENE J. KANTOR IVORY CARVING IN THE MYCENAEAN PERIOD "Three beds, inlaid with ivory, with their foot- boards. . . . One chair of ebony, inlaid with ivory, with footboard." "One ebony (?) footstool inlaid with figures of men and lions in ivory. . . . One footstool inlaid with a man and a horse and an octopus and a griffin ( ?) in ivory." So run inventories written on clay tablets during the thirteenth century b.c. The beds and chair were part of the dowry of a Syrian queen, Akhatmilku, recorded by a scribe writing in Akkadian in the city of Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra), on the coast of Syria opposite Cyprus. The footstools are listed in inventories from the Mycenaean palace at Pylos. Such texts are an important complement to the actual finds of carved ivories, for these are frequently either fragments or elements iso- lated from their original setting. The inventories allow us to reconstruct in imagination the luxurious palace appointments of which ivories were often an important part. Such furniture as well as small objects entirely of ivory were some of the most precious possessions of both Mycenae√°ns and Syrians. To us, too, the ivory carvings are of great value for their intrinsic beauty, but their significance is not therewith exhausted. Since they are often elaborately decorated in varying styles, they pro- vide invaluable evidence for differentiating the schools of decorative art which flourished around the eastern Mediterranean in the later second millennium b.c. and for tracing the complex cultural exchanges characteristic of that period of internationalism. The raw material came from the East, perhaps partly from Nubia and Somaliland by way of Egypt, but for the most part from Syria, where elephants lived until about the ninth century b.c. Ivory became available in the Aegean area very early. In Crete it was already being carved in the Early Minoan period (3000-2000 B.c.). Ivory working became a well established Minoan craft whose products provided a background for the develop- ment of ivory carving on the mainland of Greece. Un- fortunately, relatively few Minoan ivories contemporary with the Mycenaean period are known. Our knowledge of Mycenaean ivory carving is very uneven. From a period of 150 years, ca. 1350-1200 B.c., a time of intense Mycenaean expansion yet also of deep- felt threats to Mycenaean society, come many ivories, but there are only a few pieces with figure carving from the preceding 250 years. This is caused purely by the acci- 14</page><page sequence="2">2. Ivory pyxis from a chamber tomb on the slope of the Areopagus in Athens. Late Helladic III A. 3.

Late Helladic III A. dents of discovery, yet it means that our story is out of proportion. The final chapter can be written in great detail, while the earlier chapters can hardly be distin- guished, much less filled in. Thus, what is here called the "early stage" of Mycenaean ivory carving is probably not a single unit but a more complicated sequence of several phases, possibly with contrasting stylistic tend- encies. It covers the period of Minoan and Mycenaean confrontation, beginning around the end of the seven- teenth century b.c., when, with the inrush of Minoan influence, Mycenaean culture was formed; it continues through the time of Mycenaean aggrandizement in the fifteenth century, during which the Minoan cities them- selves seem to have fallen into mainland hands; and it ends in the fourteenth century, when there was a tre- mendous expansion of Mycenaean connections with the eastern Mediterranean. The early stage of Mycenaean ivory carving (ca. 1600-1350 B.c.). From the formative period of the six- teenth century come the ivory inlays of a wooden box found at Mycenae; they are carved in the form of dogs whose vividly rendered motion seems derived from the Minoan tradition for vigorous animal movement (Figure 1). Considerably later are two pyxides from Athens. The pottery found with them dates the deposit to the earlier fourteenth century, but it is possible that the pyxides were made somewhat earlier. On the smaller one, tricurved arch friezes border three tightly packed rows of nautiluses (Figure 2), while on the larger one, deer fall prey to griffins (Figure 3). For the source of this iconog- raphy we must look to Crete. Although by this time all the elements had been well acclimatized in Greece, they are part of the pictorial tradition borrowed from Minoan art. Thus, the original source for the tricurved arch frieze is the much more irregular rockwork of seventeenth and sixteenth-century Minoan landscape paintings, while the nautiluses also derive from the marine motives of Minoan murals and pottery. More complicated is the lineage of the griffins, which are also adopted from Minoan art. But this composite creature was not indigenous to Crete. Like the sphinx, it is at home in the Orient. It was undoubtedly one of the motives transported to Crete by Syrian textiles and other decorated objects during the course of the Oriental con- tacts which served as a catalyst for the great surge of 15</page><page sequence="3">4.

(Middle Minoan III B - Late Minoan I A) . The Minoans acclimatized their borrowed monsters, decking them out with wing shapes, crests and plumes that remained characteristic for Minoan and Mycenaean renderings of these creatures. Thus, although the griffin is an Oriental creature, its appearance in Greece is not a sign of direct influence from the East; it came by way of Crete. Many stylistic features of the pyxis in Figure 3 are Minoan, but they appear in somewhat altered fashion. The tree and rockwork are reduced to . minor filling elements and provide no impression of an enclosing setting. Rather the tree seems to take its character, wind- swept and contorted, from the violence of the animals. The rendering of rapid movement and, specifically, of the flying gallop is characteristically Minoan, but the ferocity of the animal conflict so vividly expressed here is approached in Crete only on an occasional gem. Some details of the pyxis seem significantly un-Minoan. The griffin on the left is markedly unorganic, its hindquarters dissociated from the forequarters by the massive wing. Such dismemberment seems alien to Minoan art, which succeeded in combining even disjecta membra into weirdly coherent monsters. Furthermore, the modeling of the animals' bodies in broad planes and the relatively abstract patterning of forms on this pyxis are already to be found on certain works of the formative Mycenaean period (Late Helladic I). These are abstracting tenden- cies that fit in with what is known of Middle Helladic decorative art, but not with Late Minoan work.

Late Helladic III B. tnemely simplified, while on the plaques of a gold- paneled wooden box (Figure 4) the Minoan style of animal movement is combined with Helladic geometri- cization of forms. Much less extreme but still clear ex- amples of patterning - note for example the treatment of the lions' heads - occur on sword pommels (Figure 5). The treatment of the forelegs as massive, almost in- flexible appendages is similar to that on the large Athens pyxis, although on the latter they are even less articulated than on the animals from the Shaft Graves. These, despite the differences in the species and poses of the animals and the disparity in date, provide an analogy for the Athens pyxis. From an early fourteenth-century context is another small carving with representational scenes, a wooden pyxis lid found at Saqqara in Egypt (Figure 6, left). Since Mycenaean pottery was being extensively imported into Egypt at this time, we will assume the piece to be Mycenaean, although it must be remembered that even objects found on the mainland of Greece may sometimes be imports from Crete or at least made by Minoan artists. In marked contrast with the Athens pyxis, the animals appear here in a landscape setting that gives a rather realistic, even anecdotal, character to the whole. The result is that, despite some resemblance between the modeling of the bodies and the poses of the animals, the total effect of the two works is very different. The closest parallel for the composition of the Saqqara lid occurs on a gold drinking cup from the early four- teenth-century tholos at Dendra, near Nauplia, where marine rocks form the frame for octopuses (Figure 6, right) . Although the individual motives are different, the strong affinity of the decoration of these two objects is clear. Both compositions, together with the cattle scenes on the well known Vaphio cups of the fifteenth century, are clearly descendants of the Minoan naturalistic tradi- tion for rendering animals in their habitat. This tradition reached its high point in Middle Minoan III murals but remained powerful in succeeding periods. On the main- land of Greece it was an influential counterforce to the austere Helladic tendency toward abstraction. The later phase of Mycenaean ivory carving (ca. 1350-1200 B.c.) In this period a new problem arises. The late fourteenth and the thirteenth century were a time of particularly intensive Mycenaean connections with the East, where colonies had already been estab- lished. Now a crucial question is the interaction between Mycenaean and Eastern art. This is no longer a matter of second-hand Oriental influence mediated by the Minoans, out of direct connections. The intense trade and the movements of craftsmen mean that even less than before is provenience a criterion of place of manufacture.

Frequently they can be assigned to the appro- priate school only by stylistic features. Among the different traditions are various Oriental ones as well as the purely Mycenaean one, and an intermediate group m which Oriental and Mycenaean characters are blended in varying degrees. Among the ivories from Greece itself and from Delos are a large number of miniature columns whose use is uncertain; perhaps they may have adorned furniture in a fashion now made vivid by the detailed descriptions on some of the Pylos tablets. Strips with triglyphs, S- spiral bands, spirals with flowers, and figure-8 shields are carved in relief. These small-scale renderings of typical features of Aegean architecture or architectural ornament have so far been found only on Greek main- land sites or Delos and provide no problem. They are obviously purely Mycenaean works, as are small ivory or bone inlays such as the "sacral ivy" leaf, lilies, murex and snail shells, and dolphins. Cockle shells and shields were cut out in the round, while the nautilus motive of the smaller Athens pyxis recurs on reliefs from Mycenae. Mycenaean also are various ivories with geometric and plant motives found in the East. In Palestine, a palace at Megiddo has yielded a hoard of ivories datable to the thirteenth century, save for an exception or two. The tricurved arch frieze seen on the small Athens pyxis (Figure 2) and the Saqqara lid (Figure 6, left) recurs on fragments of a box from Megiddo (Figure 7, above). Its lid seems originally to have had figured decoration in relief, so abraded as now to be unrecognizable, but the tricurved arch network of th√® background remains. Two rectangular plaques from the Megiddo hoard are cov- ered with "sacral ivy" friezes (Figure 7, below). This plant motive had a long history going back to Minoan origins and remained popular throughout the Mycenaean period. The form in which it appears at Megiddo is paralleled with remarkable closeness on a gold cup from Dendra (Figure 8) dated to this period (Late Helladic III B). There can be no doubt that the plaques and th√© box from Megiddo (Figure 7) are imports. When more complex motives are involved, attribution to Mycenaean or Oriental craftsmen may become difficult. Animal themes. The Megiddo hoard included rec- tangular plaques, presumably from a box. Each has the same decoration, a couchant griffin, and one is almost per- fectly preserved (Figure 9, A).

First of all, their shape is the same as that of the Megiddo ivy plaques and others from Mycenae and Deiras in Greece. Such plaques continue a type already established in Greece in the sixteenth century. The hex- agonal wooden box from Shaft Grave V at Mycenae was adorned by gold pieces of this shape - apparently a My- cenaean specialty (see Figure 4). Mycenaean also is the arrangement of the couchant creature with its great out- spread wings that admirably fill the upper part of the plaque. The same composition, with sphinxes instead of griffins, occurs on plaques from Mycenae (Figure 9, B). Similarly posed sphinxes and griffins are frequent on a variety of Mycenaean works such as a seal-stone from Menidi (Figure 9, C), where the head of the griffin points upward, as at Megiddo. A third and particularly important Mycenaean feature is the modeling of the Megiddo griffin plaques. It is of great subtlety, demand- ing shifting light to bring out all its details. Within a very small compass there is a considerable variation of planes. Analogies for various details of this modeling may be found in Mycenaean ivory carvings, but an even more striking parallel is the Lion Gate relief of Mycenae (see page 49). There many of the same features recur, such as the modeling of the hindquarters and of the powerful paws and legs, with the joint indicated by horizontal ridges. The Megiddo griffins represent the same school of carving that produced the monumental relief. The importance of such ivories is considerably increased when we realize how closely they resemble 19</page><page sequence="7">12. Ivory comb from Megiddo. Thirteenth century B.c. 13.

As yet, examples of My- cenaean sculpture and large-scale relief are exceedingly rare, and we cannot be certain whether the small carv- ings or the large-scale ones developed first - the char- acteristic plasticity may well be a heritage from Minoan relief. The relationship of small and large carvings is reminiscent of that between Mycenaean pictorial pottery and mural painting, except that the latter was clearly the leading craft, not paralleled in complexity by the vase painters. In contrast, some of the ivories rival monu- mental relief in quality and detail. The Megiddo griffins, though their quality is not often reached, are typical of the thirteenth-century Mycenaean animal style. Many pieces can be related to them. Some relief plaques from Mycenae have running lions and opposed sphinxes, but a plaque from Delos showing the capture of a griffin by a lion (Figure 10, B) is probably the closest parallel, even though modeling is here trans- lated into patterns on a flat plane. A semicircular line with flame-like projections renders the musculature of the hindquarters* while all the relief of joints, muscles and tendons of the legs is represented by outlines. The plaque with opposed sphinxes from Mycenae is inter- mediate between those from Megiddo and Delos. Char- acteristic of all this group is the breaking up of broad surfaces into facets, either by the shifting light and shadow of relief or by analogous linear patterns. Typical also is the emphasis on organic detail. Such features are in marked contrast with those of the Athens pyxis : com- pare, for example, the organic paws and legs of Figures 9, A and 10, B with the unarticulated ones of Figure 3. It can hardly be doubted that the typical features of the later Mycenaean ivories, like those of the earlier "land- scapes" shown in Figure 6, were derived from Minoan art. Perhaps the tendencies discernible in some of the Mycenaean ivories - to reduce relief to linear ornamental detail and to arrange the figures in symmetrical, tectonic fashion - were specific mainland developments, some- what analogous to the treatment of Minoan plant and marine motives in Mycenaean pottery. The Mycenaean animal style is also represented by a number of fragmentary incised plaques from Delos. On one, a bull is for once having the better of his fray with a lion (Figure 10, A). Here, too, the details, including the characteristic trefoil ear of the lion, are Mycenaean, with one exception, the whorl of hair on the lion's hind- quarters. This is an Oriental motive with antecedents traceable to Egypt in the third millennium b.c. By the middle of the second millennium it had spread from Egypt to Western Asia. Its appearance on the Delos plaque is an indubitable sign of Oriental influence ; at pres- ent it is a unique example of the adoption of an Oriental detail in an otherwise completely Mycenaean work. Inextricably linked with the Delos plaques are various fragmentary incised examples from the Megiddo hoard (Figure 11). The rendering of the animals is exceed- ingly close to that on the Delos plaques. For example, the flame elements and "braiding" on the hindquarters of the lions reappear; even the man fighting the ramp- ant lion has a Mycenaean cast. The Oriental "hair star" is also present. Two other plaques from Megiddo, though identical with those in Figure 11 in the delicate, sure quality of the incision and in some details, are far more Oriental in character. Here, then, is a series of closely related plaques, c√≤viously the product of a single workshop, yet some of them are Mycenaean in flavor and others Oriental. Within this group no precise line between Mycenaean and Oriental traditions can be drawn; it is a bridge between them. Presumably it was the Syro-Palestinian craftsmen, not subject to the disci- pline of a coherent national style of art, who were able to follow Mycenaean prototypes so closely, rather than the reverse. Such hybrid works have not as yet been found on the mainland of Greece, while in the Orient there exist other carvings, made by Orientals, yet reflect- 21</page><page sequence="9">18.

Ivory Carving continued ing the Mycenaean animal style. Not only was there a considerable vogue in Western Asia for imported My- cenaean ivories, but also for local imitations. On one of the Delos plaques (Figure 10, B) the lion seizes his prey with a compelling stroke of the forepaw, of which only the claws are shown in front view. This unusual and specific feature recurs on an ivory comb from Megiddo (Figure 12). Other features on the comb - the contorted pose of the dog, the collapse of the wild goat's forequarters while his hind legs are still in the air, and the Aegean scale and foliate-band borders - prove that it is Mycenaean. Analogous in general are plaques in relief with contorted victims and swiftly pouncing aggressors from Mycenae and Delos, but a particularly good parallel for the comb's tightly woven composition occurs on a panel from Spata (Figure 13). Its scheme is very close to that of the two Megiddo plaques (Figure 11, center and right), while they in turn have a striking parallel on a gold-plated harness element from the tomb of Tutankhamen (Figure 14) . However, though the motive is the same, the difference in the treatment is indicative of Oriental and Aegean prefer- ences. In Figures 11 (right) and 14 the predators merely stand on top of their victims, as often in Egyptian art of the New Kingdom, while the lion of the Spata plaque leaps with hind legs trailing behind him. In contrast to this typical Aegean emphasis on movement, the other two pieces are static, an important reason for ascribing the plaque in Figure 11 (right) to an Asiatic rather than a Mycenaean hand. The olive-tree ivories. An iconographie detail, a pin- nate-leaved olive tree or its branches, distinguishes a whole series of ivories, so far found only in the Orient. Nonetheless, the sources for the motive are Aegean. Al- though the olive grows in parts of the Near East, it was 22</page><page sequence="10">almost never represented there (the olive branch in a mural at Amarna is exceptional), but Cretan murals of the seventeenth century show bull-grappling scenes amid a setting of olive trees. Fifteenth-century continuations of such landscapes occur on the Vaphio cups which, whether or not they are of Minoan manufacture, cer- tainly represent the Minoan tradition of naturalistic landscape. A fragment of relief from the thirteenth- century "Treasury of Atreus" at Mycenae preserves part of a charging bull in front of an olive tree (Figure 15, left). [See restoration on page 51.] As in the case of the Lion Gate relief, this work, too, is closely related to ivory carvings. A fragment of a cosmetic box from Mid- dle Egypt shows a similar scene (Figure 15, right), in which the thick tree trunk, the details of the bull and the pebbly terrain are all Mycenaean in character. Though presumably not itself Mycenaean, the piece is a strik- ingly faithful imitation. Another carving still near in style to Mycenaean work is part of a gaming board from Enkomi (Figure 16), showing two bulls couchant be- neath an olive tree. This work also incorporates a num- ber of un-Mycenaean features and is a product of the mixed culture of Cyprus; it belongs to the very end of the thirteenth century or the early twelfth century b.c. The fidelity to Mycenaean prototypes still seen here in the rendering of the bulls is lost in Syro-Palestinian works such as the Megiddo comb and an ivory gaming board also from Megiddo (Figure 17). Still more dis- tant from Mycenaean originals is an ivory ointment vessel from Egypt (Figure 18), on which only the olive tree remains as an indication of Mycenaean connection. Both the ivories with animal themes and those with olive trees indicate that the ivory carvers of Western Asia were considerably influenced by Mycenaean works, so much so that we can distinguish a whole Mycenaean- izin g class of Oriental ivories in the thirteenth century. They form a series of transitional works between the Mycenaean and Oriental extremes. So well established did this school become that it was not destroyed when the period of intense international relations was brought to a close by the migrations beginning at the end of the thirteenth century. Ivories having the same patterning of the bodies of animals and also pinnate-leaved trees (Figure 19) reappear in the ninth and eighth centuries B.c. The ability of the Mycenaeanizing tradition to sur- vive in Asia during centuries when all traces of the My- cenaean pictorial tradition died out in Greece itself testifies to the strength of Mycenaean influence in the thirteenth century. Ivories with human figures. The repertory of My- cenaean ivory carvers included human figures, although these were not so common as animal motives. There are warriors' heads from Mycenae, Spata and Cyprus, and a warrior with spear and shield from Delos (Figure 20). He has exaggeratedly bulging muscles and an extremely thin waist. The differences between him and the war- riors combating griffins on mirror handles from Cyprus (Figure 21) are clear. The latter are hybrid Mycenaean- Oriental works and have close descendants in North Syria in the first millennium b.c. Women, too, appear in ivory. Outstanding is the group from Mycenae, two seated women with a young boy (Figure 22). In style of dress, pose and modeling the work is descended from Minoan prototypes. Though the stylistic affinities of the group are clear, its meaning is not. There are no attributes to lift the figures above the mortal world or to prove that they represent god- desses with a divine child, as has been suggested. In relief there are antithetically arranged figures of women on mirror handles from Mycenae, as well as three important interrelated works: two cut:out plaques from Mycenae and a pyxis lid from a thirteenth-century tomb at Ras Shamra. The seated woman on the first plaque is Aegean in all respects, in costume, vigorously bent limbs and bulging muscles (Figure 23, above). Again there is no basis for identifying her either as woman or goddess. The second plaque shows a standing woman, once flanked by two animals leaping toward the foliage in her hands; the foreleg of one animal is still preserved on the left (Figure 23, below). A more com- plete version of the same motive occurs on a Ras Shamra lid (Figure 24). Since practically every element on it is Mycenaean, it has often been taken as a Mycenaean carving. However, there are some noteworthy discrepan- cies between it and normal Mycenaean works. On the two Mycenae plaques the seated and walking postures are sharply distinguished, whereas on the Ras Shamra pyxis lid they are confused. Although seated on an in- curved altar base, the figure is rendered in practically the same pose as on the plaque in Figure 23 (below). Furthermore, although in the Aegean area the altar base is a well known motive, there no one sits upon it. Ac- cordingly, it seems likely that the Ras Shamra lid is an Asiatic work closely imitating Mycenaean conventions. The relationships here, however, are still more com- plicated. A figure in human form holding vegetation de- sired by animals is Oriental rather than Aegean. In Mes- opotamia, from the beginning of historical times, this motive represents the theme of animal life supported by the fertility of plants. In a cult relief from Assur of the fourteenth or thirteenth century the concept is clearly expressed: a god - mountain below, anthropomorphic above - holds a leafy branch in each hand, while two others grow from his body, supporting a rampant, 23</page><page sequence="11">22.

To complete the summa- tion of life-giving elements, the god is flanked by two , female figures holding vases with flowing streams of water. This theme became known in Syria, where it is exemplified by a seal found (but not necessarily made) at Tell Judaidah (Figure 25). Here the two goats leap to- ward the branches held by a cross-legged god, who is ac- companied by genii bearing flowing vases. This is the imagery, with the god transmuted into a goddess, that is exemplified by the plaque from Mycenae in Figure 23 (below) ; the Ras Shamra pyxis lid represents but the return, in Mycenaean dress, of a religious concept at home in the East. Conclusion. With the discovery that the language written by the Mycenaeans is Greek, conclusions as to their character, previously indicated by archaeological evidence, have been completely vindicated. In this per- spective we can now speak of two Greek Orientalizing periods, the familiar one of the late eighth and the seventh century and the earlier "Achaean" period of the late fourteenth and the thirteenth century. The later phase brought a flood of Oriental features into Greek art. In the earlier period, in contrast, much influence also went in the opposite direction. The Mycenaeans' closest foreign connections were with the Asiatic littoral of the Mediterranean; naturally it was the decorative arts of these areas, not the long entrenched national styles of Mesopotamia and Egypt, that were most receptive to Mycenaean influence. On Cyprus and in Syria and Pales- 24</page><page sequence="12">25. Impression of a cylinder seal found on the surface of Tell Judaidah in the plain of Antioch.

Brai'dwood and the Oriental Institute. tine the example of Mycenaean art resulted in a Myce- naean-influenced school of decorative art, now best represented by ivory carvings and a few works in other materials. This tradition became so well established that it survived the dark ages and re-emerged as an important North Syrian school of ivory carving in the early first millennium b.c. Such ivories were among the Oriental objects which, imported to Greece in the eighth and seventh centuries, reintroduced there the imagery that had been a joint possession of both Orientals and My- cenaean Greeks in the Late Bronze Age. When Oriental influence becomes clearly manifest in a Mycenaean ivory it is a matter of theme, not of style. As far as style goes, Minoan and Mycenaean art, despite all internal variations, displays a marked coherence which places it on a level with the national styles of Egypt and Mesopotamia. However, a great deal of My- cenaean iconography was originally Oriental, but had reached Greece indirectly as part of the Minoan heritage. Despite the intensity of Oriental connections in the thirteenth century, we have recognized among the My- cenaean ivories of that period only one clear case of direct borrowing from the Orient (Figure 23, below). It is a religious theme providing evidence pertinent to questions made particularly topical by the decipherment of the Linear B script. In Greece there was clearly great inequality in continuity between different phases of cul- ture. While Mycenaean representational art became extinct, religious and legendary traditions (which form the basis for the Homeric poems) continued during the dark centuries after 1200. Tablets from Pylos show that many Classical Greek, gods, including even Dionysos, were already known in Mycenaean times. This striking demonstration of the continuity of Greek religious tradition places in a new aspect those components of it which are of Oriental origin (such as, for example, Hesiod's famous Theogony) . Instead of entering Greece during the Classical Orientalizing period, such features could have traveled west and been incorporated in Greek tradition as early as the Mycenaean period. The problem is to demonstrate the extent to which this actually oc- curred. Since there is as yet relatively little exact evidence, it is of some significance that the Mycenaean ivories include a theme corresponding to an important Meso- potamian religious concept. It seems unlikely that such a motive - or the bronze statuettes of Syrian warrior gods found at Mycenae, Tiryns and Delos - could have come unaccompanied by some knowledge of the concepts and stories behind them. The ivory objects - combs and mirrors, small caskets and parts of furniture - which were once treasured by Mycenaeans and Orientals alike do much to resurrect the periods and peoples from which they have come down to us. These small carvings show the themes which captured the imagination of their makers. They help to chart the strength of Mycenaean trade and of Oriental delight in the exotic products of the West. They also contribute their share to the definition of the extent and character of Oriental contributions to Aegean civilization. Bibliography: Barnett, R.
