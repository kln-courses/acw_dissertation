<plain_text><page sequence="1">Numen, Vol. XXIX, Fasc. 2 "LINGA" AS LORD SUPREME IN THE VACANA-S OF BASAVA R. BLAKE MICHAEL Among his earliest memories, dreams, and reflections, C. G. Jung relates a fascinating dream from his fourth year. Playing in a beautiful meadow, he discovered a dark, stone-lined hole and a set of stairs leading down into the earth. Descending the stairs and pushing aside a green brocade curtain, he peered curiously through an archway into a dimly lit vaulted chamber. On a raised platform in the center, stood a magnificent golden throne covered by red cushioning, surrounded by red carpeting, and supporting upright a massive column. Though the column resembled a tree trunk, it was composed of flesh and had as its capital a rounded head, faceless and hairless, marked only by a single unmoving eye which cast a bright aura upward. Terrified that the object might come down from its throne, and, wormlike, creep over to devour him, the young dreamer was not in the least comforted when he heard his mother's voice calling from outside the chamber, "Yes, just look at him. That is the man-eater!" Much later, reflecting on this haunting childhood dream, Jung recognized the hole as a symbol of the grave and death, the meadow and the green curtain as the verdant and fertile earth, the red carpeting and cushioning as blood, the crowning aura as the shining root of phallic imagery (Gk. cpkX6~: shining, bright), and the column as an anatomically correct and obviously erect male genital organ. For his own reflections upon matters psychological as well as matters theological, that dream phallus became and remained a symbol of the "God 'not to be named' " whose terrifying aspect at least equalled his benign face.I Both the narrative structure and many of the symbols ofJung's dream had found archetypical expression centuries earlier in the great fifteenth-century Virafaiva dialectical text, the Suinyasa.m- pddane. That text narrates the wanderings of the great saint Allama Prabhu, his own spiritual progress, and his encounters with other</page><page sequence="2">" Lifiga" as Lord Supreme 203 spiritual seekers. In one such encounter, having met and instructed the farmer Goggayya, Allama continued wandering about in Gog- gayya's fields. There he came upon the entrance to a concealed chamber. Entering and looking about, Allama detected the glow of a single flame bathing the visage of an accomplished yogin, who sat meditating in the full-lotus position, unmoving and unblinking, Animisa. On Animisa's palm was a small stone symbol which he contemplated with perfect concentration and composure. Enrap- tured by the aspect of this perfected master and obsessed with the need for a similar accomplishment on his own part, Allama besought Animisa to instruct and initiate him. When the latter remained unresponsive, Allama recognized the spiritual identity of himself and his idol and promptly initiated himself by seizing the symbol from Animisa's palm. His joy at that somewhat irregular initiation was interrupted by the immediate demise of Animisa whose corporeal form disintegrated as he became merged with the formless void.2 Certain similarities between these two events cannot escape note. The wandering about in verdant fields, the descent into the caverns of the earth, the glow from the solitary lights, the encounters with the rigid and erect column and unmoving yogin, the threatened violence by the "man-eater" upon the boy, and the disintegrative impatience of the novice toward his new-found master-all these elements readily suggest psycho-sexual interpretations of fertility, the mother's womb, the blinding emission, the erect phallus, the castrating female, and the impatient young parricide. This impetus toward a psycho-sexual interpretation of these materials-especially of the Virafaiva tale-is at first strengthened by a rudimentary knowledge of Virafaiva belief and practice in which the object of contemplation held in the palm is a small stone called "liniga". In Kannada, the colloquial language of Virafaiva poetry, as in Sanskrit, the word "linga" often refers to the penis or, more specifically, to the phallus of Lord Siva. Western reactions to the phallic connotations of the term "li-ga" have been two-fold. The nineteenth-century Christian missionaries and European civil servants who served in India were quick to ex- press their surprise, disgust, and horror at the liiga cult in general and at the Virafaiva-s' emphasis on the liiga in particular. They</page><page sequence="3">204 R. Blake Michael saw nothing but crude vulgarity in what was, to their eyes, the licentious celebration of fertility and promiscuous sexuality.3 More recently, psychologists of religion and others influenced by psycho-sexual theory have viewed the veneration of li~iga in a less negative light. Perceiving that there are common psycho-sexual forces behind the religious expressions of various cultures and that the symbolic connotations of the liiga extend beyond mere anatomy, they have often evaluated the liniga cult more positively. In fact, they have frequently displayed a genuine appreciation for the creativity of symbolic expression and for the depth of psychological insight evidenced by the veneration of liltga.4 Significantly, the word "li7iga" itself has two sets of meanings which correspond to both the literalist missionaries' horror and the symbolic psychologists' delight at the object's veneration. In Kan- nada, as in Sanskrit, the word means both (1) "the penis, Siva's genital organ, the phallus," and (2) "a mark, a sign, a token, an emblem. "5 The matter of priority between these two sets of mean- ings has generated debate and research which, unfortunately, ends in a seemingly insoluble etymological puzzle.6 For present pur- poses, the attempt to unravel this etymological tangle can be avoid- ed. What is of importance here is that the dual connotations of the word, derived from whatever root(s) it may be, must be noted. Even if the term's primary reference is to the male organ of pro- creation, the dual nature of the word's meanings requires that it must refer not only to the anatomical organ itself but also to what is symbolized by that organ. The term must, at the very least, carry meanings of creative capacity in active exertion. In other words, it must refer to the phallus as a functioning organ and not simply to the penis as an anatomical object. Probably, this assertion, though it may have been problematic for Victorian missionaries, poses little problem for the sophisticated modern reader. It is worthy of note, however, that even this understanding of the meaning of "li~ga" in its symbolic functional sense rather than in its literal anatomical sense fails to do justice to the connotations which Virasaiva-s themselves derive from the term. They are likely, as does Swami Shri Kumar, for example, to refer to "li1ga" as symbolic of the "the presence of God, not in the far off</page><page sequence="4">" Lifiga" as Lord Supreme 205 heavens but in the very cells of the human body"; or as "the image of Infinity"; or as "the self-existent truth".7 Another contem- porary Virafaiva, S. C. Nandimath, points out a traditional inter- pretation of linga as "the Brahman from which all beings are born, by which those that are born live, and in which they enter after death; therefore it is the cause of absorption and production." He points to an etymology of the word, perhaps fanciful from a linguistic perspective but all too potent from a religious one, in which the word derives from the two roots -/li, meaning "to absorb", and /gam, meaning "to go out, to issue forth".8 Hence, for him as for other Virafaiva-s, "linga"-emission and absorption joined together-is the unifying entity in the universal process of becoming and passing away. Linga is then, in some sense, the reali- ty behind that process. Elsewhere, M. R. Sakhare has explained the linga differently, but in a way which similarly reflects a divine and cosmic sense behind the term and the symbol. He has noted that the linga representation most commonly found in Saiva temples as well as the type worn about the body by Virafaiva-s do not accurately represent a penis anyway. They are rather, as he sees them, stone cylindrical col- umns topped by hemispherical domes. The hemispherical dome he sees as the dome of heaven above reaching to the horizon. The sym- bol as a whole represents the basic nature of the universe and does so with the highest degree of abstraction, formalism, and non- anthropomorphism possible. Hence the linga symbolizes the very nature of the cosmic order in which humans live. The linga is the fundamental basis, the essential nature, the metaphysical principle, of the cosmos. It is the parabrahman.9 It is this last assertion which seems to pose the most difficulty for those who earnestly attempt to understand the nature of Virasaiva religious experience. It is easy enough, in the present century at least, to comprehend that the linga points to something other than mere anatomy. It is easy enough to accept that linga is a sign of all that is entailed in the notion of masculine creative and procreative capacity. It is less easy, however, to understand that the linfga can be a sign of some ultimate cosmic reality. More difficult still is the final Virafaiva claim that not only is linga a symbol for the cosmic ultimate, but also it, in some sense, IS the cosmic ultimate. "Not</page><page sequence="5">206 R. Blake Michael only is linga a symbol for the Lord," say the Virafaiva-s, "but also and most basically linga IS Lord!" The difficulty of grasping this point is likely to arise when reading works such as Swami Lingananda's Emblem of God where he at- tempts to distinguish between linga as the Absolute Lord and is.talinga as the small concrete symbol which serves as the object of veneration for Viraiaiva-s. Particularly difficult to grasp is his assertion that Liniga is the highest Thing, the Absolute, the Parasiva, the universal Soul, the Supernal light; Lifiga is the Energy, the immaculate, impartite, formless, peerless Principle without attributes. Lifiga is Existence-Consciousness- Bliss.10 Unfortunately, such descriptions by modern Virafaiva-s tend to engender the nagging suspicion that all this cosmological talk is but the product of recent apologia. The impression lingers that these are but the words of some modern apologist, stung by Western charges of idolatry, who is attempting to answer those charges by making an artificial distinction in the tradition's use of language and attributing meanings to the term which previous generations of believers had not intended. The persistent retort to such apparently artificial apologetics seems to be, "Yes, yes, I know the lihga sym- bolizes the transcendent and all that, but isn't it REALLY and BASICALLY just a symbol and a phallic one at that?" The suspicion that these interpretations of the lifiga as the Supreme Absolute are but recent apology proves misplaced however, when careful attention is turned to the vacana-s (a sort of devotional prose poem) of Basava, the reputed twelfth-century founder of the movement. Born to an orthodox Brahmin family of Bagevaidi in approx- imately C.E. 1105, Basava grew up with a strong dose of traditional Brahmanical values and staid orthodox religiosity. On the occasion of his investiture with the Brahmanical sacred thread, however, the twelve-year-old surprised his family and community by refusing to complete the ceremony. Arguing that true religiosity was to be found in personal and internal piety, he rejected all the forms of religious formalism which his parents' tradition promoted. Fleeing his parents home, Basava went to Kappad.i KI udala Safigama where he entered into intense meditation at the temple of Lord Siva</page><page sequence="6">" Lifiga" as Lord Supreme 207 located at that sacred confluence of the Krsna and Malaprabha rivers. Eventually his efforts were rewarded by an intense personal experience of Siva's presence within himself and thenceforward he symbolized that presence by wearing on his person not the Brahmanical sacred thread but a small linga (the is.tali~ga of later Lifigayata practice). Basava's political fortunes began to rise after he married Gaigamrbike, the daughter of Baladeva who was prime minister at the Kalachurya court in Kalyd.na, seat of government for Bijjala, the usurper of Ch.lukyan authority. Himself offered a prominent position at the court, Basava and his family moved to Kalyana, but he did not abandon his intense Saiva piety. Rather he used his posi- tion at court to organize and protect the growing band of ardent Saiva-s who shared his intense pietism and who venerated not only his leadership but also the Kannada prose poems, or vacana-s which he composed." If any single body of literature provides insight into the tradi- tional Virasaiva understanding of linga, it must be these vacana-s; and already here in these twelfth-century sayings is found a cosmic and transcendent meaning for the term "li~iga". Upon investiga- tion of these sayings it becomes obvious that lifiga not only sym- bolized the Supreme Absolute but also, in many ways, WAS that Absolute within the fideistic vision of traditional Viragaiva-s. This claim acquires validity from a careful scrutiny and classification of Basava's uses of the term "li7iga" in his vacana-s. First, it must be admitted that there are vacana-s in which, at least in most translations, Basava seems to refer to worship of the li7iga and to specify that the worship should be daily, dawn performance of prostrations, arati, and even song and dance. Of what use is life for one Who does not get up at dawn And gaze intently on Siva's li ga? What good can his life be For a walking zombie A living corpse? O Lord of the Meeting Rivers . -Basava12</page><page sequence="7">208 R. Blake Michael Basava then does not seem to reject all forms of ritual whatsoever. His rejection of the Brahmanical sacred thread is simply rejection of cold, liveless, and empty ritual formalism. On the other hand, ritual based on active and lively spiritual awareness is to be per- formed as a great aid in Saiva piety. In fact, Basava occasionally goes so far as to specify what substances (water, bilva leaves, etc.) should be used in making offerings during the course of wor- shipping the li'iga. '3 Basava also insists that the duty of each faithful Viragaiva is to be always and continually in contact with lihga. For example, he praises the transforming nature of contact with lifiga. Touched by the lodestone Iron becomes gold. Touched by the liriga Sins depart the soul. O Lord of the Meeting Rivers. -Basava14 At one level this insistence on li~iga's power might seem to indicate that Basava held to a highly ritualistic and almost magical view of the sacred power of inanimate objects. It might seem to indicate that Basava not so much rejected ritual formalism as substituted a new symbol-the lifiga-for the older one-the sacred thread. This claim is erroneous, however; for carefully analyzed and properly understood, the vacana clearly shows that Basava's concern for constant contact with the li7iga means not only, and not even primarily, contact with the stone lihga emblem. Touch with the lihga is rather an utterly transforming contact with an object which is not mere stone just as the lodestone is not mere stone. Elsewhere, this contact is described as union with a transcendent reality (bhavaliiga) or with an inner and enduring presence in the heart (pradnali-ga).15 In other words, contact with li-iga means a continual and abiding contact with something other than a mere stone object. Basava proceeds to describe two aspects of lifiga as it is available to human experience and understanding. In the first place, whatever li7iga may finally be said to be, it is not solely an inanimate abstraction; rather it is a source of comfort and aid-an active dispenser of salvific grace. They talk of the three-fold Grace; what is what? Pure is the lifiga's grace;</page><page sequence="8">" Lifiga" as Lord Supreme 209 Perfect is the ja-rgama's; And well-known is the guru's. Show me those for whom these three are one, O Lord of the Meeting Rivers. -Basava16 Thejangama and the guru are two types of personal spiritual leaders within Viragaivism. That lihga is included with these two living, breathing dispensers of grace seems to indicate that lifiga too is an active provider of salvific grace. For Basava then li7iga would appear to be not, or not simply, an inanimate amulet but, or but also, an active agent for the spiritual perfection of the worshipper. Secondly, besides being actively participant in the soteriological process, li7iga is, sometimes, a personalized and personified agent. Rather than being merely an inactive object, it is an agent of salva- tion which is perceived in a wholly personal way and which should not simply be indicated as "it" but also as "He" or "She".'7 For example, lihga, is described as a tireless worker toiling for the salva- tion of human beings. Measuring and measuring, one may grow tired, But does the yardstick grow tired? Walking and walking, one may grow weary, But does the roadway grow weary? Drilling and drilling, one may give out, But does the drill bit give out? The devotee ignorant of the Truth grows tired, But does li~iga grow tired? Lifiga's work is without wages. O Lord of the Meeting Rivers. -Basava '8 This portrait of the personified lihiga actually performing labor and doing so for the joy of accomplishment rather than for remuneration is even more graphically depicted outside the corpus of Basava's vacana-s.'9 In the fifteenth-century Sfunyasarmpddane, for example, is the story of Nuliya Candayya, a reed cutter and rope maker. One day, while cutting reeds, Nuliya lost his is.taliiga into the water. Casting aside any concern for ritual prescriptions in favor of personal piety expressed through work, Nuliya went on about his business. The lihga, in a comically delightful episode, sprouted arms and legs and chased after Nuliya imploring him to take it back. He agreed to do so, but only on the condition that the</page><page sequence="9">210 R. Blake Michael linga itself continue to perform its assigned daily tasks of cutting reeds and making ropes.20 This later tradition reflects a rather peculiar vision of li-ga, but it serves to indicate that liriga was perceived to be not simply an in- animate stone object. Rather liriga could be seen as wholly personal and fully active. When coupled with the previous image of lihga's activity as dispensation of salvific grace, a portrait emerges of a per- sonal agent active in the salvation of humankind. It is for that reason that Basava can speak of a liiga which works tirelessly and without remuneration. His notion that liriga is a per- sonal and personalized agent, actively concerned about and involv- ed in the salvation of human beings seems none other than the idea of God as the divine Lord (iUvara). This surmise is confirmed by several vacana-s from Basava in which lin-ga is addressed in the vocative, sometimes in apposition with other titles or words for the Lord. O Lifiga, is it my fault that I was born? O Lifiga, pray, for former births Grant your forgiveness! ... O Lord of the Meeting Rivers. -Basava21 And why should you, O Lord of the Meeting Rivers, all-virtuous lin-ga, Look so for sin in me? -Basava22 Such invocations hardly seem addressed to an impersonal and in- animate object. On the contrary, they reflect an image of li'iga as a sentient being, aware of and judgmental toward human actions and shortcomings and capable of graciously forgiving human faults and weaknesses. In fact, the appositive construction, brings "lihga" in- to parallel and apparent identity with the term of divine address which Basava uses throughout his vacana-s-namely, "kuCdala saigama diva, Lord of the Meeting Rivers." As such, liniga appears to be a name or term of address for supreme divinity. This salvific role of lifga as a personalized and personified Lord., as saguna brahman, is further demonstrated by Basava's insistence that one must have faith in or trust in liniga; that is one must take refuge in the Lord. He who knows the Gfta is not wise; The master of words, is not wise;</page><page sequence="10">" Lifiga" as Lord Supreme 211 He only is wise who has faith in lifga . He is wise who takes refuge in Our Lord of the Meeting Rivers. -Basava23 Once again li-fga appears not as a mere inanimate object but as a locus of trustworthy power. Furthermore, it appears again in parallel with kuidala sa7igama deva so that the refuge and faith one reposes in the Lord of the Meeting Rivers is indistinguishable from the faith one entrusts upon liiga. Note also that lifiga here is specifically contrasted to such inanimate objects as "words" and scripture. Its active role in the spiritual life is exactly what those in- animate religious objects cannot match. Such faith or trust in liniga leads to a recognition of the transform- ing power of lifiga as the abiding inner presence of a metaphysical reality. The transforming power of this metaphysical reality is ex- pressed by Basava in the image of an outer glow occasioned by that inner presence. Liiiga can be seen shining on the believer's face; The Lord, unblinking, abides in the believer race. ... O Lord of the Meeting Rivers. -Basava24 Hence liiga cannot be seen merely as a concrete cult object for it is also an active power in the spiritual life of the devotee. It is, in some real sense, a spiritual entity which becomes, within the inner life of the devotee, a spiritual infection and does not remain merely an external bodily affectation. As the vacana indicates, when the liniga is truly present it not only shines on the external body but also abides as Lord within the believer and company of believers. The transforming potency of the li~ga which Basava seems to intend here and elsewhere hints at that term's reference to something which is not only transcendent and supra-empiric but also indefinably abstract. In fact, the ineffability of the lifiga's nature and of its power finds rather clear expression in Basava's vacana. Earth, water, fire, and ether are within the supreme lifga Which is the foundation and the origin. Liiiga is the incomprehensible Having no beginning, no middle, no end . O Lord of the Meeting Rivers. --Basava25</page><page sequence="11">212 R. Blake Michael Obviously, Basava's understanding of linga is not confined to a mere amulet suspended on the body of the devotee. Encompassing within it the very elements of which all material existence is com- posed, it pre-exists, supports, and extends beyond the finite limits of material existence. In fact, it extends beyond the very capacity of human comprehension with its beginning, middle, and end unavailable to human imagining. In this sense, lihga, for Basava, connotes not a mere phallus but the unfathomable pillar of light ('yotirlifga) which Saiva tradition often utilizes to indicate the eternal, infinite, and characterless omnipotence of Lord Siva.26 By insisting on the indescribability and immeasurability of lifiga, Basava seems to indicate its incomparability to any object or con- cept except the uncharacterized absolute, the nirguna brahman. Elsewhere, Basava makes more explicit the inadequacy of human wisdom-whether "divinely revealed scripture" (sruti) or "natural human logic" (tarka)-for understanding, grasping, or indicating the true nature of liga's absoluteness and otherness. He says: Not knowing how to explain it, The Veda-s quake and tremble Because liiiga is inexplicable. Not knowing how to encompass it, The Sdstra-s finally proclaim, That the lirga is inconceivable. Not knowing how to reason it out, Logic is driven witless Because liriga is beyond thought. Not knowing how to proceed, The Agama-s become bogged down Because liriga is unattainable. Neither men nor angels can see it as it is. Only the true devotee is fit For our Lord of the Meeting Rivers. -Basava27 Thus negating several of the means of valid knowledge-sruti, smrti, and the entire science of tarka-Basava portrays liniga as beyond the ken of finite epistemology. The obvious comparison from orthodox tradition is to the indescribable absolute of Upanisadic thought, the non-objectified essence of being, the nirguna brahman. In fact, that non-objectifiable essence is specifically described as other than the usual states of human knowing. It is formless, bodiless, infinite, and incommensurable, as Basava declares in a vacana.</page><page sequence="12">" Lifiga" as Lord Supreme 213 The states of great liriga are nothing but the names of liniga. Lifiga is other! It is neither formed nor formless. Liniga is other! It is not associated with a body. Liniga is other! It is far beyond even the greatest matter. There is no comparison to the position Of our Lord of the Meeting Rivers. -Basava28 In fine, for Basava, li~iga can not be confined to a mere bodily amulet, nor to a mere phallic representation. Rather it is, in some sense, eternal, infinite, characterless, and incomparable to any ob- jectified or conceptualized human knowing. It, quite simply, can be seen as it truly is "neither by men nor by angels." It is wholly within itself, the Unseen Seer of Upanisadic metaphysical specula- tion-i.e., the nirgutna brahman. Basava's vacana-s, then, are seen to refer often and clearly to liniga both as a personal divinity, directly involved in human salvation and known to humans by His/Her gracious attributes (saguzna brahman) and also as some sort of indescribable, transcendent, metaphysical absolute (nirguna brahman). Far from being a simple stone object, li~iga is, for Basava, both a symbol and, in some ge- nuine sense, the reality of a transcendent absolute. In other words, li-iga may accurately be referred to not only as "it" but also as "He" or "She" and as "IT"-that ineffable reality behind phenomenality.29 A sincere recognition of the centrality of this transcendent quality of li-ga in Basava's vacana-s leads to a reconsideration of those vacana-s where Basava seems to be referring to the stone lifiga image in the palm. Close scrutiny reveals that in many, though admittedly not in all, of those cases the word "lifiga" is accompanied by a qualifier which allows Basava to specify that in this case he intends the concrete object on the palm. When Basava intends the object on the palm as a concrete focus of veneration, he is likely to refer to the "liniga on the palm" (kaiyalli li7iga) or to the "li-ga on the body" (a-gayyolagana liiga) or to the "trappings of lifiga" (liniga ldiichana).30 In fact, where many translators have retained the word "liiga" in their renditions of the vacana-s, closer scrutiny often reveals an entirely different word, particularly when there seems to be straightforward reference to the focus of objective worship. Com- monly used words are "karasthala", which means primarily "the</page><page sequence="13">214 R. Blake Michael hand" or "the place in the hand"; "kuruhu", a word meaning "mark, sign, token, characteristic"; "laiichana", meaning "mark, sign, token, spot, stain, stigma"; and "kavaca", which means primarily "armour, a coat of mail" and secondarily "an amulet, a charm '.*31 Unfortunately, many translators-primarily Western educated or influenced Indians-have not been sufficiently meticulous in observing this distinction.32 Having elected to retain the word "linga" in their translations from Kannada, primarily into English, they have rather assumed that such near synonymns to "liriga" could be rendered by the word "liniga" itself with no attention to subtle theological issues. By and large such translation efforts have been acceptably accurate and certainly valuable, but they leave room for misinterpretation on what is, for Basava at least, a crucial theological point. Their value as hermeneutical device, though not their beauty as literary expression, is thereby critically marred. When more careful attention is paid to these distinctive usages, Basava's vacana-s are seen to refer often and clearly to lihga both as an indescribably transcendent metaphysical absolute (nirguna brahman) and as a personal divinity, directly involved in human salvation and known to humans by His/Her gracious attributes (sagutna brahman). When Basava intends less transcendent reference to the concrete object venerated upon the palm of the Virasaiva, he seems capable of utilizing either a qualifier or an entirely different word in order to make his meaning clear. Seen in this light, claims by modern Virasaiva-s, such as Swami Lingananda's, prove to be founded not simply upon apologetic desires but upon the claims of the Virasaiva tradition from its beginnings. Both Lingananda's assertions that linga is "the Ab- solute ... formless, peerless ... without attributes," and his descrip- tion of lifiga as "Parasiva" and as sacciddnanda33 are but reiterations of what faithful Virasaiva-s have been saying about liriga from the earliest days of that movement. Furthermore, his effort to distinguish li7iga as absolute principle from the li7iga of worship (istaliiga) no longer appears an artificial device utilized for apologetic purposes, but finds sanction within some of the earliest expressions of the movement's faith.</page><page sequence="14">"Lifiga" as Lord Supreme 215 Far from being a construct of a later, more philosophical, more Sanskritized, or more apologetically inclined age, the idea of "liga as Lord Supreme" was known already to Virafaiva-s of Basava's time. Any effort to understand the Virafaivism of the present MUST take that fundamentally transcendent meaning of the term into account. Yet, what is most surprising about the Virasaiva understanding of liiga is not that it has reference to a transcendent reality but that Westerners, particularly those influenced by psycho-sexual theories of religious symbolism, have had so much trouble grasping the Virasaiva-s' point. The difficulty is especially confounding when set against the sim- ple but almost unanimous testimony of Hindus, Virasaiva and others alike, that liiga has for them no phallic connotations. For ex- ample, the eminently qualified scholar of comparative religion, K. L. Seshagiri Rao, has averred that during the first quarter century of his life he must have visited hundreds of Saiva temples and venerated liiga thousands of times. During that time not once did any idea of liiga as phallus occur to him. It was only later, when reading Western authors on comparative religion, that the phallic connotation was suggested to him, irreparably destroying his sim- ple, but genuinely Hindu, vision of lihga as symbol of supreme divinity.34 In light of such unanimous testimony, the point should not be so hard to grasp. Of course, none of this argument is meant to ignore or deny the apparent wealth of psycho-sexual reference throughout Hindu mythology. In many Hindu myths, it is well-high impossible to overlook the phallic connotations of the liniga symbol. What is intended is a stern reminder that most religious symbols function on many levels of meaning. Just as the fabled auto-erotic use of the crucifix should not detract from the ultimate, transcendent reference of that symbol for Christians, so too should the phallic potency of the liiga symbol not detract from its ultimate, transcen- dent reference in the hearts and minds of pious Hindu-s-Saiva-s in general and Vira'aiva-s in particular. The common difficulty in grasping this crucial point becomes utterly baffling when placed beside the obvious observation that, for the patron saint of psycho-sexual interpretations of religious symbols-that is, for Jung himself-the sub-terranean ithyphallus</page><page sequence="15">216 R. Blake Michael of his dream was not simply a sexual symbol but also a theological one. His young mind associated that hidden object described by his mother's statement "That is the man-eater" with his fears of the robed and hidden Catholic priests. Describing those priests by the phrase "That is a Jesuit", he further connected the word "Jesuit" with the word "Jesus" and arrived at a potent, if somewhat muddled, equation of "the dark Lord Jesus, the Jesuit, and the phallus [as] identical." Unfortunately many of his followers and others influenced by his thinking have either failed to grasp his point here or have interpreted it as an utter reduction of the transcendent to the anatomical. Jung's own richer interpretation of this symbolic identity better accords with Vira"aiva notions.35 For, more than mere anatomy, more than generativity, more even than a concrete symbol of some other reality, "lifiga", for Virasaiva-s, refers also, even primarily, to the transcendent perceived both as inanimate absolute and as personal Lord. So it was in Basava's time and so it is for Virasaiva-s of the present. Ohio Wesleyan University, R. BLAKE MICHAEL Delaware, Ohio 43015 1 C. G. Jung, Memories, Dreams, Reflections, ed.

Kittel, A Kannada-English Dictionary (Mangalore: Basel Mission Book &amp; Tract Depository, 1894), s.v. "liiiga". 6 There are two main parties in the etymological dispute. One led by Przyluski argues that the word is non-Indo-European and derives from the Austro-Asiatic</page><page sequence="16">" Lifiga" as Lord Supreme 217 root vkal which yields the Sanskritized form ldiigalam, meaning both "penis" and "plow". The other party lead by Burrow argues that the word is Indo-European in origin and derives from the prefix ni- plus the root Vaiij, yielding first nyanga, then niiga, and finally liriga and meaning "sign, mark, token". On this tangled and relatively unenlightening debate see Manfred Mayrhofer, Kurzgefasstes etymologisches W6rterbuch desAltindischen (Heidelberg: Carl Winter, Universitiitsverlag, 1967), s.v.

Angadi (Dharwar: Suyidhana Sugrantha Maale, Jaganmata Ak- kamahdevi Ashrama, 1973). The distinction between the Absolute (lifga) and the object of worship (is.talifiga) is made explicit on p. 20; the quotation occurs on p. 35. 11 The most comprehensive account of Basava's biography taking into con- sideration both the legendary and the epigraphical evidence, is P. B. Desai, Basavesvara and His Times, with a Foreword by D. C. Pavate (Dharwar: Karnatak University, Kannada Research Institute, 1968). Though Basava is the most widely accepted candidate as a founder of the movement, there are serious counterclaims and denominational disagreements. For more on these disputes, see R. Blake Michael, "Foundation Myths of the Two Denominations of Viragaivism: Virakta-s and Gurusthalin-s," Journal of Asian Studies XLII.2 (1983 February). 12 The best edition of Basava's vacana-s is Basavannanavara Vacanga.lu, ed. R. C. Hiremath, with a Foreword by A. S. Adke (Dharwar: Karnatak University, 1968) [hereafter abbreviated BV (K)]. The translation of preference is Vacanas of Basavanna, Taralabalu Granthamnle-2, ed. H. Deveerappa, trans. L. M. A. Menezes &amp; S. M. Angadi, with an Introduction by Sivakumara Sivacarya (Sirigere: Annana Balaga, 1967) [hereafter abbreviated B V(E)]. The vacana quoted is BV 157: (K), p. 70; (E), p. 52. This translation and others, unless noted, are by the present author.

Most con- venient is probably A. K. Ramanujan, "The Six-Phase System (Satsthala Siddhanta)," pp. 169-174 in Speaking of Siva, ed. &amp; trans. A. K. Ramanujan (Baltimore: Penguin Books Inc., 1973).

As Siva and consort Sakti are subsumed under a more abstracted, a-sexual, metaphysical conception, so are the masculine and feminine aspects of the linga symbol subsumed under a conception of the undif- ferentiated and omnipotent linga, as both male and female. Compare, for example, the Siva Mahdpurd.a, Vidyeivarasamhita 16:94-95 &amp; 106-107. Beyond the gender identification of the divine, there is also the gender identification of the ascetic or of the mystic who seeks a unitive state with the lord. On this point, see Carl Olson, "The Saiva Mystic and the Symbol of Androgyny," Religious Studies 17.3 (1981 September): 377-386. '8 BV 113: (K), p. 53; (E), pp. 37-38.

That vacana, however, is not contained in the standard collections of Basava's writings. 20 Nuliya Candayya's story appears in its entirety in the Suinyasarmpddane [of Gilfiira Siddhaviranaryaru] chap. 14; vol. 4, pp. 127-192. The tale and its implica- tions for the Virasaiva sense of vocation is discussed by R. Blake Michael, "Work as Worship in Virafaiva Tradition," in Journal of the American Academy of Religion.

Amidst much repetitive panegyric, the Siva Mahdpurdna, for example, describes Lord Siva in em- bodied form as the highest form of divinity with qualities (sakald) and Lord Siva in linga form as the highest form of divinity without qualities (niskald) (Vidyeivarasamhita 5:9-13). In fact, Siva's superiority over the gods is asserted to be his possession of such a qualityless mode as highest brahman (Vidyeivarasamhita 5:14). Worship of this qualityless mode of Siva as liriga is particularly prescribed for those who find lower forms of ritual distasteful (Vidyeivarasamhita- 18:56). 30 These phrases occur respectively at BV 108: (K), p. 51; (E), p. 36; at BV484: (K), p. 190; (E), p. 156; and at BV 106: (K), p. 50; (E), p. 35. 31 These words occur, for example, at BV647: (K), pp. 259-260; (E), p. 214; at BV743: (K), p. 297; (E), pp. 244-245; at BV206: (K), p. 87; (E), p. 67; at BV948: (K), p. 394; (E), p. 319; at BV 3: (K), pp. 2-3; (E), p. 3; at BV 192: (K), p. 82; (E), pp. 62-63; and at BV 224: (K), p. 94; (E), p. 73. 32 Most prominent among such translators have been teams working under the direction of Professor L. M. A. Menezes of Karnatak University, Dharwar.</page><page sequence="18">"Liiiga" as Lord Supreme 219 Overall their translation efforts have produced beautifully readable and acceptably reliable poetry of a high order.
