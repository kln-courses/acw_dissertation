<plain_text><page sequence="1">Letter from the Secretary-Treasurer To All Members of the Association: The Executive Committee of the Pacific Division of the American Philosophical Association cordially invites you to attend the 81st annual meeting of the American Philosophical Association, Pacific Division. The meeting will be held at the Westin St. Francis in San Francisco, California, from Wednesday, April 4 through Sunday morning, April 8, 2007. 1. Meeting Location and Special Attractions The APA Pacific Division will meet at the St. Francis Hotel on Union Square in the heart of San Francisco. The hotel is located on Powell Street, between Post and Geary, facing Union Square. The address is 335 Powell Street, San Francisco, California 94102-1875; telephone is 415-397-7000; and fax is 415-774-0124. One of the handful of classic and historic deluxe hotels in San Francisco, the Westin St. Francis has its own cable-car stop and a view overlooking Union Square. The St. Francis is the site of the high-end restaurant Mina. Mina is a two star Michelin restaurant and also is the Wine Spectator's pick for best San Francisco restaurant. Securing your reservation in advance is advised. Call 415-397-9222 (give name and dates of meeting for convention rates) or go to the Pacific Division page on the APA website for a hotel reservation form. The St. Francis remains a favorite stop for afternoon tea, and the lobby bar, The Onyx, expands the locations where philosophers can enjoy each other's conversations. The hotel is within walking distance of Chinatown, the theater district, Yerba Buena Center, and the Museum of Modern Art, and of several smaller museums, as well as dozens of San Francisco's finest restaurants and the new Westfield Center, the largest mall in the U.S. West. (See restaurant and attractions list in this Proceedings.) North Beach is a few minutes ride away on the cable car that stops in front of the hotel. For those of you who are museum goers, the Museum of Modern Art, within easy walking distance from the hotel, has a major exhibition of Picasso and his influence on American artists scheduled during the APA meeting dates. And a short ride on the bus from the corner in front of the hotel down Geary Street, or a one-station ride on BART (two blocks away down Powell Street) brings you to the Civic Center?featuring the Symphony, the Ballet, and the home of the Asian Art Museum. During the APA meeting dates, the Asian Art Museum has special exhibitions of the paintings, sculptures, and other objects of the princely state of Mewar in India and of Japanese baskets and sculptures. The newly rebuilt deYoung Museum in Golden Gate Park also</page><page sequence="2">2 Proceedings and Addresses of the APA 80:3 invites a visit, not the least in order to join the debate about its architecture. The Palace of the Legion of Honor's extensive European and sculpture collection, and its world famous print collection, are always worth a visit. In addition to these large museums, San Francisco has many small ones, including at least five within easy walking distance of the hotel. (See the list of San Francisco museums and galleries in this Proceedings^) For those aspiring to ascend speedily to the heights, five glass elevators zip up the 32-story tower in the Westin St. Francis at 1,000 feet per minute. Get in, press the 32 button, and soar upwards at about one floor per second as Coit Tower, the Financial District, and the Bay Bridge rush into view. The downward plummet is even more thrilling, especially for those who dare to press themselves against the glass and look down as they hurtle toward Union Square. (If this description doesn't appeal to you, ask for one of the hotel's plentiful supply of lower floor rooms.) Plan to spend some extra days in San Francisco. A list of museums, galleries, theaters, concert halls, restaurants, and clubs can be found in this Proceedings. If you are interested in taking a day trip to the Wine Country or Monterey, or heading for skiing in Tahoe, call the concierge at the St. Francis for booking advice. Reservations - A hotel reservation form can be found on the Pacific Division page of the ARA website, and in this issue of the Proceedings. Reservations can be made by calling 415-397-7000. We urge you to make your reservations very early to assure that you obtain the ARA convention rate of $179 for a single or double room. 2. Travel Information Driving: (Dial 511 for latest traffic information) - From the South: Take 101 North to 4th St. exit onto Bryant St. Continue 1 block and turn left onto 3rd St., which becomes Kearny St. Cross the Market St. intersection at Geary and turn left onto Geary.

Here is a list of shuttles, with phone numbers: Advanced Airport Shuttle (650-504-6641), Airport Express (415-775-5121), American Airporter Shuttle (800-282-7758 or 415-202-0733), Bay Shuttle (415-564-3400), Lome's Airport Shuttle (415-334-9000), M &amp; M Luxury Shuttle (415-552-3200), Pacific Airport Shuttle (415-681-6318), Peter's Airport Shuttle (650-577-8858), Quake City Shuttle (415-255-4899 or 415-621-2831), San Francisco City Shuttle (888 850-7878), and SuperShuttle (415-558-8500).

The SFO BART station is located on the Departures/Ticketing Level (Level 3) of the International Terminal, on the Boarding Area G side of the terminal near the Berman Reflection Room. BART is also easily accessed from any terminal by riding SFO's AirTrain to the Garage G/BART Station stop. There is no charge to board AirTrain. Take BART to the Powell Street Station in San Francisco and walk two short blocks to Union Square. BART also provides a direct connection from SFO to Caltrain at the Millbrae station. BART is wheelchair accessible and all travel information is provided both by loudspeaker announcement and electric billboard. From Oakland Airport, you also can BART to San Francisco by taking an AirBART shuttle to the Collesium/Oakland Airport BART station, and then the subway to the Powell Street Station in San Francisco. As at San Francisco Airport, there are numerous shuttles to San Francisco. In the City: The Powell Street Cable Car stops in front of the hotel. MUNI Buses 2, 3, 4, and 38 do so as well. Two short blocks away at Powell and Market, BART will take you to various parts of the City and to the East Bay (Oakland and Berkeley).

Recommendations (including self-nominations) for commentators and session chairs also are encouraged. These all should be sent to the 2008 Program Chair, Mark Wrathall, at 4085 JFSB, P.O.
