<plain_text><page sequence="1">ORNITHOLOGICAL LITERATURE 327 ON THE WING: THE LIFE OF BIRDS: FROM FEATHERS TO FLIGHT. By Bruce Brooks. Charles Scribner's Sons, New York. 1989:192 pp., numerous photographs. $40.00.-Before reading or discussing this book, one should take note of Brooks' introductory statement (p. xiv): "This book should not teach anyone to feel secure in a comprehensive knowledge about birds. It should teach us all to be delighted that we can never find out enough." What follows this introduction is not an ornithology text, nor is it in any way a reference work or book of instruction. It is a book meant to instill wonder, not knowledge. Brooks does this with great gusto. The book is filled with anecdotes about the biology of birds: anatomy and physiology, primarily relating to flight; reproduction, including nesting and parenting; and a chapter on "Birds and Man: Whose World Is This?" This last chapter is somewhat different from the usual plea for conservation. Brooks makes the usual com- plaints about decimation from habitat destruction, hunting, and the illegal pet trade. He then points out at length the efficiency of birds in controlling agricultural pests, citing examples of avian responses to insect outbreaks, saving crops, and the quantity of weed seeds and rodents consumed by birds. An aside on the last page is about how an ovenbird (probably the Rufous Hornero [Furnarius rufus]) ended an epidemic of Chagas' disease. He also brings up the important role birds have played as inspiration, especially in music. He contends that, without birds, our lives would be poorer, not just for the loss of birds to watch and listen to, but for the absence of their effect on our other aesthetic pursuits. As is typical of a companion book (to the Public Broadcasting System's television series Nature), "On the Wing" has a highly readable text illustrated with numerous high-quality, often spectacular, photographs. As is also typical of the genre, the text can be frustrating to an expert in the field because of inaccuracy due to oversimplification. One must realize that, in order to present information at a level comprehensible to the lay reader, an author must gloss over details and complexities to an extent that can leave the reader with the feeling that life is simple, straightforward, and well-understood. Unfortunately, this book goes beyond the usual level of inaccuracy. For example, Brooks states that there are about 8800 species of birds in the world, as compared to about 4000 species of mammals and 7500 species of all other vertebrates combined (p. 3). One must assume that he means amphibians and reptiles, since there are well over 100,000 species of fish. Later, when discussing nesting, Brooks includes Mourning Doves (Zenaida macroura) and hermit hummingbirds (Phae- thornis spp.) among the passerines (p. 97, 107). These and other statements are not over- simplifications; they are simply incorrect. Another difficulty that authors of natural history books must contend with is the temp- tation toward anthropomorphism, especially when discussing evolution or behavior. In his zeal to express the wonder of ornithology, Brooks doesn't even try to resist that temptation. As an example, in describing the use of hymenopteran nests by some birds, he states (p. 104), "In a few cases, this is because the insect builds a strong structure of mud or papier- mache and the bird envies its snugness." His descriptions of bird anatomy are far more teleological than can be excused as "writing for a lay audience." He regularly refers to evolved structures and behaviors as if the birds consciously decided to adopt them, with statements like (p. 5) "If Archeopteryx needed only to keep warm, why didn't he grow hair and the layer of fat that usually supplements a fur coat?" and (p. 82) "The upper leg renders a service to the foot, without which the bird would never be able to relax on a perch." While it can be difficult at times to express evolutionary results without sounding a bit teleological, Brooks has gone beyond that degree, and the book's credibility suffers as a result. The PBS Nature series has a deservedly high reputation for quality, in its subject matter, its photog- raphy, and its scripts. While its anecdotes are certainly interesting and informative, this book does not live up to the standards set by other segments of that series.-'ROBIN K. PANZA.</page></plain_text>
