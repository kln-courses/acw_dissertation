<plain_text><page sequence="1">Isabel Stearns The Apparent Amphiboly of Peirce's Reality Kant's section on the "Amphiboly of Concepts of Reflection" (A270, B326) in the Critique of Pure Reason criticizes Leibniz for erecting "an intellectual system of the world," and for not regarding "the con- ditions of sensible intuition which carry with them their own differ- ences, ... as original." Peirce may be differentiated from Leibniz in not a few ways, among which are the following: 1) Leibniz maintains the principle of the Identity of Indiscern- ibles. According to Peirce, space evades that law by providing dif- ferentiation of things that are numerically alike (3.612-613, 1911; cf. 1.501, ca. 1896). 2) Leibniz holds, according to Kant, that there is "absolute in- wardness." For Peirce, inwardness is often nonabsolute (see 7.438, ca. 1893). 3) Leibniz holds that there is no direct outwardness between the finite monads. Peirce has a place for outwardness in his theory of perception and the percipium (7.629, 1903).1 But Peirce can be interpreted in such a way that his thought leads to an amphiboly like the one that Kant describes. Peirce's apparent amphiboly of reality is readily detected in his con- flicting and ambiguous usages of the term reality in his philosophy. I believe that this ambiguity is to some extent realized by Peirce him-</page><page sequence="2">Isabel Stearns 81 self. As we may say that Aristotle holds that Being may be said in many different ways; so Peirce shows himself aware that there are dif- ferent and, in a sense, interrelated meanings of the Real. Sometimes, he says that "metaphysics teaches us that there is a succession of orders of reality" (1.501, ca. 1896); sometimes he speaks of a "threefold force of reality" (7.669, 1903); and sometimes of "imperfect" and "devel- oped reality" (8.300, 1904). I would like, first, to suggest that, where his metaphysics is con- cerned, Peirce might be regarded as like Plato, Plato did not believe that a completely written Platonic philosophy would ever be possible. Peirce, like Plato, at the outset of his cosmology, declares that it is not to be taken literally, as a temporal development (6.214, 1898). Like Plato, he sometimes presents his metaphysical thought in myth and metaphor. His philosophy as a whole is one of abductive hints, rather than of a completely developed organic system. Thus, it may be un- just to criticize Peirce for not providing the metaphysical system which, by the very nature of his thought, he could not provide. His philosophy, like his synechism, is always developing, and, as in his tychism, fresh hints appear which seem to disrupt the continuity of his achievement. The fact that he thought of his philosophy as of the nature of a complex sign seems to suggest that the object to which the sign points can be only provisionally presented (5.1 19, 1903; cf. 4.550, 1906). I should like to explore Peirce's treatment of reality in relation to his categories, to his cosmic theory of reality, to his theory of Mind as at work, and to his theory of the nature of God. Naturally, I can deal with each of these subjects only very partially. I shall then conclude with some remarks on the amphiboly of reality as it appears after these topics have been discussed. Concerning the categories as such, I shall be especially brief. First- ness, as such, is a mere may-be for Peirce (1.304, ca. 1904), known through its abstraction from Secondness, sensuous, conjectural in its modal character. Peirce is quite emphatic that "the substance of a dream is not real" (6.453, l9°fy&gt; but that the fact of the dream is real if it was dreamed (ibid.). Indeed, he says that there is a vast difference between the most vivid dream and reality (5.239, 1868). Nevertheless, in his threefold force of reality, the dream does seem to have some, however fugitive, reality, even if only as a mere tone of life (cf. 7.667- 668, 1903; also 4.580, 1906). Peirce finds himself in a special difficulty</page><page sequence="3">82 The Apparent Amphiboly of Peirce's Reality here; on the one hand, dream cannot be refused its idiosyncratic and delusive character; on the other hand, dream is feeling, and from the plasticity of feeling, reality may be said to evolve (cf. 6.138, 1892; 6.194 if., 1898). Such feelings are qualities (6.197, 1898) for Peirce. Secondness is sometimes called reality by Peirce: "Reality, like every other quality, consists in the peculiar sensible effects which things partaking in it produce" (5.406, 1878). Or, "the Second . . . meets us in such facts as ... reality, result" (1.358, ca. 1890). Second- ness is reality as existent, external, insistent (7.659, 1903; 1.325 [un- dated fragment]). Yet, elsewhere, Peirce opposes the existence of Sec- ondness very sharply to the reality of Thirdness (5.107, 1903). The existence of Secondness is that of action-reaction; it is not to be taken as law in the sense of Thirdness. Peirce even speaks of Secondness as imperfect reality, as contrasted with the developing reality of Third- ness (8.300, 1904). It should be noted that Peirce does speak of dif- ferent types of existence as Secondness. Thus, one finds him distin- guishing (8.330, 1904) between the Second as a Re f erate and the Sec- ond as a Revelate. Thirdness as reality is significative, as the taking of habits, indeed, as a formative law permitting of exceptions which in its turn requires Secondness as its sheriff (7.532 [undated]). Thirdness appears some- times to signify that ideal perfection of knowledge which belongs to a community of thinkers and, yet, is independent of them (5.356, 1868; 7.336 [undated]). But this conception of Thirdness as a goal, in the sense of an ideal harmony of thought (5.384, 1877), seems ac- tually to be an ideal limit, which is never completed. As the limit itself, it can be reinterpreted as a certain Secondness of real things, independent of our opinions about them (ibid.). (We may, indeed, cognize such Reals without knowing that we cognize these Reals, and thus these Reals are not incognizable.) Yet since we never reach this ideal goal (namely, the harmony of all our thoughts) the reality of Thirdness consists in the reality of "would-be's" or potentialities (1.213, 1902; 2.664, 1878, with correc- tions 1893; 5.312, 1868;2 5.408, 1878;3 8.284, 1904; 8.330, 1904; 6.327, ca. 1909). The ideal is destined (6.610, 1893; 4*547» 19°fy onty as a tendency which permits of tychistic exceptions. The nature of the cosmic evolution is discussed mythically by Peirce in materials contained in Volume VI of the Collected Papers. There Peirce posits an origin, a germinal nothing (6.217, 1898),</page><page sequence="4">Isabel Stearns 83 which because of its germinal nature is not just an absolute nothing. It would seem that this origin, which he speaks of elsewhere as an intensity of consciousness (6.265, 1892), must, in some sense, be at least quasi-real. However, he refers in Volume I to the tendency of the universe to become less and less dreamy, and more and more real (1.175, ca- 19°5)« From this germinal nothing emerge qualities (6.220, 1898) of the nature of feelings (6.198, 1898) which are, of course, Firstnesses (ibid.). In their emergence, however, is the fact of their being over against one another and their ground (6.203, 1898); this is the Secondness of their existence. They, then, may develop in such a way as to take on patterns of habit (6.204-205, 1898), but to this patterning exceptions may always occur (6.207, 1898). Here we have at work both Peirce's synechism and his tychism, but we may say that the synechistic habit-forming is real in a more important sense; for, in this we have the universe, so far as it may be claimed to be devel- oping patterns or forms. It is tempting to think of the cosmic development of reality as ex- ternal as a whole; whereas, Peirce's ontological psychology is, rather, internal in character. Quite often, Peirce appears to think in terms of a macrocosm-microcosm analogy, but such a statement of analogy in his thought is misleading, in that the supposed two sides of the analogy are so directly connected with each other. Peirce, indeed, in one passage speaks of "feeling as nothing but the inward aspect of things, while mind, on the contrary, is essentially an external phe- nomenon" (7.364, 1902). In a very early passage Peirce refers to the spiritual mediation between minds (7.591, ca. 1867). One mind is con- tinuous with another by virtue of the synechistic character of each. Our spiritual consciousness is most real in the sense that it may tran- scend individual body-manifestations (7.574-577, ca. 1892), Peirce refers to the depth of consciousness of knowledge forced on us from without by nature's mind and to the depths of the inward aspects of "our" mind on the surface of which we float (7.557-558, ca. 1893). At the same time, there is an element of spontaneous originality (7.389-390, ca. 1893) in the development of "our" thought. Even in the case of the lower animals, Peirce says only that "performance is determined [by Instinct] in almost all its details'* (7.378,? 1902; my italics). Similarly, Peirce holds that even in the work of bees and crystals, thought develops (4.551, 1906). The mind is able to form "skeleton sets" of ideas (7.392, ca. 1893;</page><page sequence="5">84 The Apparent Amphiboly of Peirce's Reality 7.426, ca. 1893; 7.427, ca. 1893) in terms of various clusters, which it elicits from its depths through various forms of connection. Ideas from without act so as to bring to the surface of consciousness certain ideas from within the mind. Here, in mind's play with its ideas, a suggestion of Gestalt theory may be found. We have a "comparative freedom" (7.426-427, ca. 1893) in the formation of these sets, which strongly suggests the "gentle force" of habit-taking in the universe as a whole. Peirce states in one passage (6.60, 1892; cf. 1.211, 1902): "My hypothesis of spontaneity ... by thus loosening the bond of necessity, . . . gives room for the influence of another kind of causation, such as seems to be operative in the mind in the formation of associa- tions. . . ." We may, indeed, relate Peirce's view of the individual mind to his view of the universe by means of his conception of the two-sided consciousness, both ego and nonego (7.531 [undated]). He himself says that "we start out on our travels from our home . . . the parish of percepts" (8.261, 1905), and thus, from the very beginning, we are, as it were, out in the world. One could, more fancifully, see in his metaphor of consciousness and the bottomless lake (7.554 [undated]) a relation to the extreme of the germinal nothing from which the universe has its limiting origin. As reality is created in the universe through the formation of habits; so reality is created by our mind through the formation of appropriate sets or clusters of ideas. The possibility of such action appears to rest on the deep affinity between "our" mind and the universe, and this is held by Peirce to be a source, giving us at least a degree of trustworthiness in our synthetic infer- ences concerning the universe (cf. 2.693, 1878). In time, all inappro- priate ideas would come to be "weeded out" (7.668-669, 1903), but, of course, there is no end to this time sequence. The potential unity of the minds of the community is brought about more and more through the process of agapastic final causation (6.307, 1893). In a discussion of Peirce's metaphysical treatment of reality, one cannot ignore his conception of God (2.532, 1893),4 but here there is the utmost difficulty in formulating his views. This is primarily be- cause Peirce thought of his conception of God as the "infinitely in- comprehensible" (6.466, 1908). Any attempt to prescind or render this conception precise would involve one in contradictory antino- mies (6.496, ca. 1906). Still, some beliefs concerning the nature of God have a greater trustworthiness than others do, although they go be-</page><page sequence="6">Isabel Stearns 85 yond any "logical" warrant (ibid.). Peirce considers God not only as the Alpha and Omega of his universe, but also as continuously cre- ative in relation to it (6.505, ca. 1906). It should be noted that Peirce explicitly denies that God is immanent within the universe (5.496, ca. 1906). As the origin of the universe, God appears to be a transcendent, infinite reality, which is always creating the universe. This is indi- cated by Peirce, inter alia, in his emphasis on the meaning of the statement in Genesis that God said, "Let there be Light" (2.341, ca. 1895). Light is not only an intention of God's mind, but comes about. Thus God creates what Peirce would call a dynamical object (8.314, 1909).5 Peirce states categorically, however, that although God is real, God cannot be said to exist. "Exist" is to be used in its strict philosophical sense of "react [ion] with the other like things in the environment. The real, on the other hand, holds its characters on such a tenure that it makes not the slightest difference what any man or men may have thought them to be . . ." (6.494-496, ca. 1906). Generally, Peirce tends toward an anthropomorphic conception of the Deity, although in one passage he gives a rather sharp criticism of such an anthropo- morphic conception (6.199, 1898; See also 547n, 1903; 1.316, 1903; 5.536, ca. 1905; 6.502, ca. 1906). Accordingly, Hartshorne holds that Peirce distinguishes between critical and uncritical anthropomorph- ism.6 On the other hand, Peirce says that "all reality is due to the cre- ative power of God" (6.505, ca. 1906). God is the creator of all three universes of experience (6.452, 1908). Indeed, he says that the out- ward mind is the creator of our "inwardly seen mind," which may not be altogether independent of it (7.558 [undated]). Peirce (5.107, 1903) makes a somewhat qualified statement about the nature of God: "Analogy suggests that the laws of nature are ideas or resolu- tions in the mind of some vast consciousness, who, whether supreme or subordinate, is a Deity relative to us." He says that this "purely philosophical hypothesis" is "a support to the imagination," but questions whether it is of scientific service. Religion for Peirce is, indeed, "a sort of sentiment, or obscure perception," even a "deep recognition" of the Absolute to which the individual is relative (6.429, 1893). One could speculate still further that there might be a sense in</page><page sequence="7">86 The Apparent Amphiboly of Pence's Reality which God as agapasm would anticipate Whitehead's superjective nature of God. Whitehead states in Process and Reality: "The 'super- jective' nature of God is the character of the pragmatic value of his specific satisfaction qualifying the transcendent creativity in the various temporal instances/'7 Hartshorne gives such an interpreta- tion of Peirce's God as Thirdness in his essay, "Peirce's One Con- tribution."8 If, however, one argues that there is such a facet to Peirce's thought, one finds oneself in some obvious difficulties in respect to Peirce's conception of man's relation to God. If God is defined as infinite, as in the definition of him as "infinitely incomprehensible" (op. cit.), how could he possibly develop agapastically? One can understand what Hartshorne's reply to this question would be. However, Peirce stipulates (4.68, 1893): "For it is a degraded conception to conceive God as subject to Time, which is rather one of his creatures." It may be of interest in this connection that Peirce observes (8.330, 1904) that "there seem to me to be strong arguments to prove that temporal causation ... is an action upon ideas and not upon existents." On the other hand, Peirce says (7.572, ca. 1892): "A man is capable of having assigned to him a role in the drama of creation, and so far as he loses himself in that role - no matter how humble it may be - so far he identifies himself with its author" (see also 1.615, 1903). In view of these passages, one might decide that Peirce intends to hold that God and man are co-authors in the drama of creation. If it were possible to think of Thirdness as having in a certain sense a non- temporal basis, a basis which could be provided, for example, by the Firstness of Thirdness, one would then be able to reconcile these passages. Also, according to Peirce, time evades the "law of logic" (1.501, ca. 1896), and one might say that this very evasion could be a deficiency to be overcome, as man reaches toward his ultimate ideal. What, then, is Peirce's amphiboly of reality? On the one hand, reality is taken to be equivalent to the summum bonum (5.443, 1905), a "process of evolution whereby the existent comes more and more to embody those generals which were said ... to be destined, which is what we mean by calling them reasonable." Here we have a process, the end or ends of which are sometimes spoken of as being settled, and yet this end is also treated as a limit which can never be reached. On the other hand, reality is here and now, in greater or lesser measure, even in a dream. This amphiboly can be solved, if at all,</page><page sequence="8">Isabel Stearns 87 only by Peirce's significant metaphysical distinction between reality as final causation, which is comparatively free to guide (7.426-427, ca. 1893), and reality as efficient causation (7.532 [undated]), the "aggressive" sheriff, without which the court is powerless. Reality, then, as final causation, Thirdness, or agapasm, requires efficient causation as its instrument. It is dependent on the existential factor of Secondness for its fruition. Is, however, Secondness, which is treated by Peirce as an haecceity, ontologically capable of giving Thirdness the support which it requires? Is it not too brute, abrupt, and transitory to be an effective condition of the bringing about of Thirdness? This is the question of those, like Boler, who hold that Peirce has given no metaphysical account of the nature of individuals and that he could not, because of the strong idealistic tendencies of his thought. It seems to me, however, that it is quite possible to reinterpret Peirce as holding that individuals are never completed processes (in significant relation to one another but not subsumed by one another), processes which are complex, and require for their explication all three categories of Firstness, Secondness and Thirdness. I have argued that there is a basic imaginative originality (7.647, 1903) in the activ- ity of any mind, as Peirce develops this in his "Philosophy of Mind." Furthermore, even though the mind possesses this imaginative orig- inality, it is also capable of a process of increase of self-control in its use of its imaginative clusters of ideas, and this increase of self-control is the key to man's rationality. What Peirce really posits is a funded- ness in the building of man's habits in relation to one another which constitutes him a person and gives him a certain unification and stability in his conduct with reference to an aesthetic ideal (4.539- 540, 1906; 5.533, ca. 1905).9 It is a matter of wonder to me that Murray Murphey and Charles Hartshorne in their treatment of Peirce's theory of the continuum have seemed to stress the "Kanticity" and not the " Aristo telici ty" of the continuum (6.122, 1892; 6.166, 1903; cf. 8.113, 1900). In that the continuum contains its own limits, can it not be said, thereby, to contain in some sense its own "boundednesses"?10 If so, there could be different types of "boundednesses," which could be actualized in the process of creation, as the continuum becomes determined. The continuum need "dissolve" into Thirdness only if it is thought of in terms of its "Kanticity" alone.</page><page sequence="9">88 The Apparent Amphiboly of Pence's Reality It is interesting in this connection that Peirce (4.118, 1893) in re- ferring to the importance of Klein's naive view of the line and tan- gent, states that "absolute exactitude cannot be revealed by experi- ence, and therefore every boundary of a figure which is to represent a possible experience ought to be blurred. If this is the case, it is both needless and useless to talk of infinitesimals." He also (4.68, 1893) speaks of selves as "vicinities." Later, he says (4.172, 1897): "It is only actuality, the force of existence, which bursts the fluidity of the gen- eral and produces a discrete unit." Later still (4.542, 1906) he ob- serves: "That conception of Aristotle which is embodied for us in the cognate origin of the terms actuality and activity is one of the most deeply illuminating products of Greek thinking." Undoubtedly, Peirce has used the "Dedekindian cut" in his treat- ment of limits, notwithstanding his criticism11 of it (4.593, 1908). Yet, as Murray Murphey points out, there was a definite element of so- called intuitionism in Peirce's thought. We have already seen that he finds considerable importance in Klein's "naive" view. Thinking in these terms, we see that the notion of boundedness becomes more important than that of a precise Dedekindian cut. Such a bounded- ness may be blurred for common sense, but it is nonetheless impor- tant as a boundedness. I believe that Peirce has different types of boundedness and is de- veloping a metaphysical doctrine with reference to the actualization of the continuum. Further, I believe that Hartshorne's "surgical ex- cision" of Peirce's actualized possibles12 would be catastrophic for Peirce's metaphysics. Acts of conduct are such complete actualized wholes. We can, as Boler says, have completed acts, potentially divis- ible although not actually divided.13 The individual determines him- self through his actions and still, as habit, has a potential incomplete- ness which is never fully determined. I would even venture to sug- gest that Peirce in his conception of the blurred boundednesses has anticipated Whitehead's theory of extensive abstraction. Thus, although an apparent amphiboly of reality is to be found within Peirce's writings, in these writings we may also find some very suggestive clues as to its solution.
