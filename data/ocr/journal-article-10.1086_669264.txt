      <p>In the later years of his life, probably in the mid-1250s, Gonzalo de Berceo composed what may have been the penultimate work of his vast oeuvre—the <italic>Poema de Santa Oria</italic>.<sup>1</sup> In this 205-stanza vernacular poem, which Berceo claims to have translated from a Latin original written by the saint’s confessor two centuries earlier, the young recluse Oria experiences three mystic visions before her death: one of the reward that awaits her in heaven; the second of the Virgin Mary, who visits Oria in her cell to reassure her of that heavenly reward; and the third of the Mount of Olives, where she beholds other heavenly beings of great beauty. In the first vision, the basis of this study, three virgins guide Oria upward to heaven where she witnesses processions of the saints, hears the voices of God and of Christ, and gazes upon an ornate chair promised to her after death by its beautiful guardian, Voxmea. The most enigmatic figure of all of Berceo’s poems, Voxmea, dressed in a gown on which are sewn the names of the Christian faithful, has been interpreted by some as the personification of Lady Wisdom found in the Old Testament and in works of antiquity, and by others as either the voice of God or the church. Though Berceo obviously was influenced by classical and early medieval personified images of such abstract concepts as philosophy and theology, in Voxmea he created a separate personification that, in my opinion, represents none of the above.<sup>2</sup> Based on the context in which she appears and the few words that she speaks, Voxmea personifies faith. This is made manifest in the gown that Voxmea wears as well as in her words of encouragement and warning. Through Voxmea, Oria receives the promise of a place among the Christian departed, and her words exhort the recluse to persist in her ascetic life of prayer and devotion.</p>

         <title>The Presentation of Voxmea</title>
         <p>Oria’s first vision begins in quatrain 30, immediately following a short introduction in which Berceo indicates the day and approximate hour at which the vision takes place: the third night of Christmas, which is the Feast of Saint Eugenia, and just after matins when Oria “quiso dormir un poco” (desired to sleep a little) (29c).<sup>3</sup> Three virgin martyrs “de grant auctoridat” (of great authority) (30a)—Agatha, Eulalia, and Cecilia—lead Oria’s soul up a column that “a los Cielos pujava” (thrust into the Heavens) (41c) and that delivers them into a “marabilloso prado” (marvelous meadow) (47c) worth more than “un rico regnado” (a rich kingdom) (47d). In the midst of this field stands a tree into which Oria and the three virgins climb and from the top of which they encounter “en el Cielo finiestras foradadas” (open windows in the sky) (49c) through which they enter the celestial court. There Oria sees processions of canons and bishops, as well as a chorus of virgins, some of whom she recognizes. As the processions file by and Oria continues her heavenly tour, she notices the previously mentioned chair:<disp-quote>

                  <verse-line>En cabo de las vírgenes, toda la az passada,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>falló muy rica siella de oro bien labrada,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>de piedras muy preciosas toda engastonada,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>mas estava vazía e muy bien seellada.</verse-line>

                  <verse-line>non podrié en est mundo cosa seer tan clara,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Dios sólo faz tal cosa que sus siervos empara,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>que non podrié comprarla toda alfoz de Lara.</verse-line>

                  </attrib>
               </verse-group>
               <p>[At the end of the virgins’ procession, all the line passed, / she saw a beautiful chair of gold well wrought, / covered with very precious stones, / but it was empty and well sealed. // She saw on the chair a very rich tapestry; / nothing in this world could have been so luminous; / Only God, who protects his servants, could have made such a thing, / which could not be bought with all the properties of Lara.]</p>
            </disp-quote>In the following quatrain Berceo introduces the figure of Voxmea, the beautiful guardian of the gold chair just described: “Una dueña fermosa de edat mancebiella, / Voxmea avié nombre, guardava esta siella” (A beautiful lady of youthful age, / Voxmea by name, guarded this chair) (82a–b). This introductory description lasts only one quatrain, however, for the following lines return the reader to descriptions of the heavenly environs. Quatrains 83–85 present a series of “sanctos hermitaños” (holy hermits), of whom Oria recognizes four; in quatrains 86–88, the martyrs “vestidos todos de vermejón” (all dressed in red); and in quatrains 89–90 the “apóstolos” seated on their thrones, as well as the “evangelistas.”</p>
         <p>After the enumeration of these celestial inhabitants, Oria turns her eyes back to Voxmea and to the golden chair that, at this point, she still does not know is reserved for her. Voxmea’s gown, one of the most mysterious images of the poem, becomes a focal point:<disp-quote>
               <verse-group>
                  <verse-line>Vistié esta manceba preciosa vestidura,</verse-line>

                  <verse-line>era sobreseñada de buena escriptura,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>non cubrió omne vivo tan rica cobertura.</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Avié en ella nombres de omnes de grant vida,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>que servieron a Christo con voluntad complida,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>pero de los reclusos fue la mayor partida,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>que domaron sus carnes a la mayor medida,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Las letras de los justos de mayor sanctidat,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>parescién más leíbles, de mayor claridat;</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>los otros más so rienda, de menor sanctidat,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>eran más tenebrosas, de grant obscuridat.</verse-line>
                  <attrib>(93–95)</attrib>
               </verse-group>
               <p>[This young woman was wearing a beautiful dress, / more precious than gold, more so than pure silk; / it was covered with fine writing; / no man alive has ever worn such fine garments. // On it were written the names of people of worthy lives, / who served Christ with all their heart, / but the recluses made up the greatest part, / who disciplined their flesh in the greatest of ways. // The letters of the just of highest sanctity, / appeared more legible, of greatest clarity; / those of lesser importance, of lesser sanctity, / were more unclear, of great obscurity.]</p>
            </disp-quote>Berceo here foreshadows the actions that Oria will take upon waking from her heavenly vision. She notes that the recluses comprise the majority of the names on Voxmea’s gown, and the names of those who died in a higher state of grace appear more clearly than the rest. In the dialogue that follows this description, Oria inquires as to the owner of the chair guarded by Voxmea, and the latter responds,<disp-quote>
               <verse-group>
                  <verse-line>Todo esti adobo a ti es comendado,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>el solar e la silla, Dios sea end laudado,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>si non te lo quitare consejo del pecado,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>el que fizo a Eva comer el mal bocado.</verse-line>
                  <attrib>(98)</attrib>
               </verse-group>
               <p>[All of this that you see is intended for you, / the room and the chair, God be praised, / if sin’s guidance does not take it from you, / which led Eve to partake of the damning morsel.]</p>
            </disp-quote>That is, as long as Oria remains faithful, guarding herself from the temptations of the devil, the chair and the space in which it sits will belong to her in the afterlife. Oria is, as one would expect, overwhelmed with happiness and begs to be allowed to remain in heaven, at which point both God and Christ, through disembodied voices, tell Oria that her time to die has not yet come and that she must return to her earthly body for a while longer.<sup>5</sup> Very shortly following this exchange, Oria’s first vision comes to an end as the virgins who had accompanied her at the beginning carry her back down the column to the cell in which she lives.</p>
         <p>This summary of Oria’s first vision presents the figure of Voxmea as “purely functional” and “never individualized,” and her conversation “either answers Oria’s questions or describes and explains things to Oria and to the reader.”<sup>6</sup> In fact, Voxmea does little more than stand motionless, responding only when asked to do so. Whereas Berceo indicates the colors worn by such figures as virgins and martyrs in the celestial processions—“cosas eran angélicas con blancas vestiduras” (angelic beings they were, with white vestments) (50b), “una grant compaña, / en bestiduras albas” (a great company, / in white vestments) (55a–b), “semejavan vestidos todos de vermejón” (they all appeared dressed in red) (86c)—he gives no physical description of Voxmea other than that she is beautiful, young, and wearing a robe covered with writing, the principle feature that differentiates her from everyone else that Oria encounters. The names written on her gown represent the saints, of whom the recluses make up the majority. Their levels of holiness are differentiated by clarity of legibility: those of great sanctity are recognized by the large clear letters used in the writing of their names, whereas the names of those of lesser sanctity are written much less clearly.<sup>7</sup> Foreshadowing the poem’s end, Voxmea admonishes the recluse to remain in her path of holiness, the reward for which will be not only the chair and her physical presence among the holy but also, we must presume, the appearance of her name in clear letters on Voxmea’s gown. We will return to this topic later.</p>

      <sec id="sc2">
         <title>Berceo’s Possible Influences</title>
         <p>There are several possible influences on Berceo’s creation of the figure of Voxmea. Throughout the Middle Ages, images of Greek and Roman deities and mythological figures were reappropriated in various ways to represent the virtues, the trivium and quadrivium, the deadly sins, time, the four seasons, and a host of other abstractions.<sup>8</sup> Likewise, the Old Testament books of Proverbs and Sirach provided personified images of wisdom where, as Celia Deutsch points out, “Lady Wisdom’s most dominant role is that of a teacher, a public role ordinarily associated with males.”<sup>9</sup> Thus, late antique and medieval writers and visual artists had at their disposal no lack of personified imagery from which to choose in the creation of their works.</p>
         <p>Of the early church fathers who employed personification in their writings, Augustine of Hippo (354–430), whose works Berceo assuredly knew, is probably the most well known. In book 8 of his <italic>Confessions</italic> (ca. 398), for example, where Augustine describes the sexual torment that he experienced during his conversion, he depicts Lady Continence, who came to guide his spirit: <disp-quote>
               <p>I had turned my eyes elsewhere, and while I stood trembling at this barrier, on the other side I could see the chaste beauty of Continence in all her serene, unsullied joy, as she modestly beckoned me to cross over and to hesitate no more. She stretched out loving hands to welcome and embrace me, holding up a host of good examples to my sight. With her were countless boys and girls, great numbers of the young and people of all ages, staid widows and women still virgins in old age. And in their midst was Continence herself, not barren but a fruitful mother of children, of joys born to you, O Lord, her Spouse.<sup>10</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>The image of the virgins and of the “great numbers” of people surrounding Continence, as well as the “host of good examples,” all find their parallel in the throngs of virgins and other saints that Oria sees in heaven and in the names written on Voxmea’s gown. Likewise, in her words of encouragement to Augustine, Continence ends her conversation with words similar to those used by Voxmea in her conversation with Oria: “Close your ears to the unclean whispers of your body, so that it may be mortified.”<sup>11</sup> The allegorical figures that Augustine encounters are, for the most part, females. He proves himself a masterful creator of feminine imagery, for the figures most important to his spiritual development are his mother Monica, a central character in the <italic>Confessions</italic>, and female personifications of the teachings of the church. Robert O’Connell contemplates “the powerful orchestration of the woman-image” in Augustine’s works: “when tracked through all its sinuous turnings, it reveals not only Augustine’s imaginative affirmation of the feminine quality in God, it strongly suggests that many, if not all his imaginative characterizations of God have crystallized, constellated about the varied meanings and images suggested by a single, multivalent Latin word: <italic>fovere</italic> [to caress, to care for].”<sup>12</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Another allegorical work of immense influence from its time of composition (the 520s) onward, and most likely known by Berceo, was <italic>De consolatione Philosophiae</italic>, written as Boethius awaited his execution. Lady Philosophy, “the fullest philosophical development of the female personification of wisdom in early medieval thought,”<sup>13</sup> leads the embittered protagonist through a series of conversations that ends in his acceptance of God’s providence, thus discontinuing his complaints against Lady Fortune, whom at the beginning of the book he blames for his pitiable state. Boethius presents Philosophy as a woman of “awe-inspiring appearance, her eyes burning and keen beyond the power of men” and as one who “possessed a vivid colour and undiminished vigour.”<sup>14</sup> He tells us that her clothes “were made of imperishable material, of the finest thread woven with the most delicate skill.…On the bottom hem could be read the embroidered Greek letter Pi, and on the top hem the Greek letter Theta. Between the two a ladder of steps rose from the lower to the higher letter.”<sup>15</sup> This description lays the foundations upon which later medieval writers would create personified figures of great beauty. Compared to other writers of the time—Martianus Capella, for example, who dedicates extensive passages to the physical descriptions of allegorical figures in his <italic>De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii</italic>—Boethius simplifies the clothing, placing emphasis on the Greek letters embroidered on Philosophy’s gown, and pointing to the importance of the word as the instrument through which divine wisdom (theta) is reached by means of earthly knowledge (pi).<sup>16</sup> The symbolic ladder connects the two in a way that evokes the mystical union of the divine with the human soul. During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, Boethius’s work, particularly his depiction of Lady Philosophy, achieved great renown among Christian writers, Berceo most likely among them.<sup>17</sup> Jacqueline Beaumont has listed many of the most important copies of and commentaries on Boethius’s work, explaining that “with the twelfth century, the study of <italic>De Consolatione Philosophiae</italic> begins again to gather momentum” thanks possibly to the “huge, comprehensive, academic and highly intelligent” commentary written by William of Conches at the beginning of that century and copied for widespread distribution almost immediately.<sup>18</sup> John Marenbon suggests, “[The] <italic>Consolation</italic> was more influential in the Middle Ages even than Boethius’s other works, and its pattern of influence is rather different. The commentaries, textbooks, and <italic>opuscula</italic>  were studied intensively in the earlier Middle Ages and were among the texts that shaped twelfth-century thinking; from 1200, their importance diminished. The <italic>Consolation</italic> enjoyed a similar fortune up to the end of the twelfth century (though it was more widely read and had a distinctive literary influence). Its popularity did not, however, grow less after 1200.”<sup>19</sup> Thus, of the works of Boethius, it was the <italic>Consolatione</italic> that enjoyed a continuous readership, as Marenbon goes on to explain, from its appearance in the sixth century to well beyond the Renaissance. As noted, the monastic library of Santo Domingo de Silos owned two volumes of Boethius’s works, but we also know that the <italic>Consolatione</italic> had reached other parts of the Iberian Peninsula well before Berceo’s time.<sup>20</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Another text that Berceo may have known is the anonymous tenth-century Provenzal “Poëme sur Boece” that appeared in northern Iberia by way of the pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela. A troubadour’s rendering of the life of Boethius, the “Poëme” presents the unnamed feminine visitor as a radiant figure dressed in the most beautiful of gowns. She holds the keys to paradise, and those who have faith in her teachings should not fear death:<disp-quote>

               <p>[She is so beautiful that she brightens the whole palace; / the place in which she enters is of great clarity; / there is no need for a fire to light it; / she is bright enough for forty towns.…/ Beautiful is the woman, with such a brilliant face / that no man can hide from her countenance, / not even those across the sea. / They can covet nothing in their hearts / the thought of which she cannot see: / he who in her has faith, shall not worry about his death.…/ She holds the keys to Paradise herself, / those who love her, she welcomes as her friends].</p>
            </disp-quote>The author describes her dress as having been made by the woman herself, with the Greek letters and ladder sewn onto it, as described in Boethius, and constructed of love and faith: “Bel sun li drap que la domna vestit: / De caritat e de fe sun bastit” (Beautiful are the gowns that the woman wears: / Of love and of faith are they made) (199–200). Perched on the embroidered ladder of her dress are a hundred thousand birds, those closer to the theta being a brighter color than those below. The poem goes on to explain that the ladder was created with alms, faith, and love—“Cals es la schala? de que sun li degra? / Fait sun d’almosna e fe e caritat” (What is the ladder? What are the steps made of ? / They are made of alms and faith and love) (216–17)—and that the birds represent people. Those at the top of the ladder are of the greatest faith and have given up worldly desire, whereas those toward the bottom once had great faith but now “fan perjuris e grant traicios” (commit perjury and great treachery) (236).</p>
         <p>Despite the fact that the author of the “Poëme” based this work on the <italic>Consolatione</italic>, the personified figure remains nameless, and much of the poem has been reworked into a more Christianized discourse. Due to Boethius’s imprisonment and impending death, the only virtue left to him is faith in the woman’s teachings. This is foreshadowed in lines 150–57 of the “Poëme,” where the narrator contends,<disp-quote>
               <verse-group>
                  <verse-line>Bos xristias qui cre perfeitament</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Deu la paterna lo rei omnipotent,</verse-line>

                  <verse-line>E sanctum spiritum qui e bos omes desend,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Que qu’el corps faca, eu li vai l’arma dozen:</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Bos christians, qui aital eschala s te,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Cel no quaira ja per negu torment.</verse-line>
               </verse-group>
               <p>[Good Christians who believe perfectly / in the paternal God, king omnipotent, / and in Jesus, who is of such great goodness, / Who redeems us through his sweet blood, / And the Holy Spirit who into good people descends, / Whatever the body does, he follows with teachings for the soul: / Good Christians who have achieved that height, / from there will never fall to damnation.]</p>
            </disp-quote>Thus, even before the beautiful figure appears to Boethius, the narrator compares the lives of the faithful to a ladder—those who believe perfectly in the Trinity should not fear eternal torment, for they have climbed the heights of spiritual perfection and have come near to the divine.</p>
         <p>Considering that Berceo had access to the works of Boethius and Augustine, possibly knew some version of the “Poëme sur Boece,” and may have studied either at Palencia or at one of the northern Iberian cathedral schools where he would have read such texts as those of Martianus Capella and others like it, he had a wide range of imagery from which to choose in the creation of Voxmea.<sup>22</sup> The main difference between Berceo’s figure and previous descriptions is the manner in which their gowns are decorated. However, as we will see, indications throughout the text lead us to believe that Berceo did, in fact, have at least Augustine and Boethius in mind when creating Voxmea.</p>

         <title>Voxmea and The Holy Trinity</title>
         <p>In her 1992 edition of the <italic>Poema de Santa Oria</italic>, Isabel Uría Maqua says of Voxmea that “dado el carácter simbólico de la escena, podría representar la voz de Dios: <italic>Vox Mea</italic>, en cuyo caso podría ser la que guía a Santa Oria” (given the symbolic character of the scene, she could represent the voice of God: <italic>Vox Mea</italic>, in which case, she could be the one who guides Saint Oria).<sup>23</sup> Terry Mount is of the same opinion, asserting, “Voxmea means ‘my voice’ in Latin; therefore, this woman is the spokesperson for God, or perhaps God’s (or Christ’s) voice personified.”<sup>24</sup> This cannot logically be true, however, and Uría Maqua retracted part of that interpretation in her 2004 study <italic>Mujeres visionarias</italic> : <disp-quote>
               <p>Teniendo en cuenta el abundante uso de los símbolos que se hace en este poema y el carácter simbólico de la propia escena, es tentador pensar que Voxmea simboliza la Voz de Dios, <italic>Vox Mea</italic>. Pero a esta sugerencia se opone un hecho, y es que, cuatro coplas después de las palabras que Voxmea dirige a santa Oria, el propio Dios responde.…Por tanto, no tiene sentido que Voxmea represente la Voz de Dios cuando muy poco después las palabras del propio Dios no coinciden con las de ella e incluso las contradicen.<sup>25</sup>
               </p>
               <p>[Keeping in mind the abundant use of symbols in this poem and the symbolic character of the scene itself, it is tempting to think that Voxmea symbolizes the Voice of God, <italic>Vox Mea</italic>. But opposing this suggestion is the fact that, four stanzas later, God himself responds.…Consequently, it does not make sense that Voxmea represents the Voice of God when very shortly afterward the words of that same God do not coincide with, and even contradict, hers.]</p>
            </disp-quote>The contradiction to which Uría Maqua refers is God’s unconditional promise of Oria’s return to heaven after her death, which opposes Voxmea’s statement that Oria’s return is dependent upon her continued faithfulness to her religious devotion—God’s promise is firm, but that of Voxmea is subordinate to future action on Oria’s part. Thus, as Uría Maqua suggests, we cannot interpret the figure of Voxmea as the voice of God: her words contradict those of God and, at the same time, he does not require a physical medium through which to speak, a personified image that stands corporeally in his place. As verses 103c–d state, Oria hears God perfectly without needing to see him: “fablólis Dios del Cielo, la voz bien la oyeron, / la su Majestat grande, pero non la vidieron” (God spoke to them from the Heavens, the voice they heard well, / that of his great Majesty, but they could not see it).<sup>26</sup> I would extend Uría Maqua’s explanation further to include the Son of God who, like the Father, in quatrain 105 speaks to Oria in the form of a disembodied voice:<disp-quote>
               <verse-group>
                  <verse-line>Como asmava Oria a su entendimiento,</verse-line>

               <p>[As Oria thought this over, / she heard Christ speak within this good place, / but she could not see him despite her desire, / for she had not yet reached such worthiness.]</p>
            </disp-quote>As with God, Berceo has no need to represent Christ visually to Oria since his voice indicates his presence. If not for those voices, however, we could accept Voxmea as a figure of either God or Christ: throughout the Bible, God makes himself known through his voice, and the Gospel of John tells us that God’s Word “was made flesh and dwelt among us” (1:14) in the form of Jesus Christ. Even more, Voxmea’s warning to Oria in quatrain 98 that the recluse will be judged by her future actions could be interpreted as the words of the Christ who sits in judgment of humankind at the end of days. We know, however, that this cannot be true. If Voxmea’s words contradict those of God, rendering null her personification of him, the same holds true of Christ who, as the second person of the Trinity and One with God, cannot contradict the words of the Father.</p>
         <p>Considering them real “persons” with voices, Berceo has little need to represent God or Jesus in the form of allegorical figures, which in his works are normally restricted to incorporeal beings or abstract concepts.<sup>27</sup> For the unlettered listener, indeed even the more educated readers, such personifications “appeal to the affective and sensible parts of the soul, consequently adhering firmly in memory.”<sup>28</sup> I would argue, the contradictory statements notwithstanding, that presenting God or Jesus in the form of Voxmea would actually confuse and perhaps disconcert the reader or listener. The fact that Oria cannot see God and Christ reflects not the need for such a figure as Voxmea to represent them visually but rather a belief, common to medieval theologians, that the faces of God and Christ cannot be looked upon until the soul has separated for eternity from its earthly body and has experienced its “day of birth to the new life of heaven.”<sup>29</sup> In <italic>City of God</italic>  22.29 (ca. 426), Augustine explains the vision experienced by those in full communion with God after death: <disp-quote>
               <p>Now just think, when God will be “all in all,” how much greater will be this gift of vision in the hearts of all! The eyes of the body will still retain their function and will be found where they now are, and the spirit, through its spiritual body, will make use of the eyes.…What is meant is that in heaven eyes can see realities that are immaterial. It is the kind of vision that may have been given to holy Job even while he was in his mortal body, when he said to God: “With the hearing of the ear, I have heard thee, but now my eye seeth thee.”…It was the Divine Master who said: “Blessed are the pure of heart, for they shall see God.” Hence, no Christian reading these words in a spirit of faith has any doubt that, when God is to be seen, it will be by the eyes of the heart.…The truth is that we shall draw near to God by faith, which is a power to see which is not in our body, but in our mind.…We shall see Him in a way different from the way in which His “invisible attributes” are now seen…and we must rely more on the eyes of faith, whereby we believe, than on the eyes of the body, whereby we see the beauty of the material universe.<sup>30</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>One will notice the emphasis that Augustine places on the sense of hearing and on faith. Though while still in human form the spirit may perceive God audibly, as does Oria, the direct sight of him can only come when the spirit, through faith, leaves the body and reaches the level of sanctity that permits it to understand God in all his perfection.<sup>31</sup> Isidore of Seville concurs: “Moses saw through an angel or other creature the back of God’s glory. And Peter and the other disciples witnessed the divinity of Christ shining through the human body; if they had perceived divinity through its very self, it is impossible that they could afterwards continue to live in the flesh.”<sup>32</sup> Since Oria’s soul is still attached to her body, she has not yet reached the “merecimiento” (worthiness) necessary to experience the “divinity through its very self,” and God does not allow her to perceive him in both audible and visible forms. Following these teachings, Berceo remains within the limits of orthodoxy by presenting God’s majesty not in anthropomorphic form but rather as an omniscient presence that is recognized through God’s own immaterial voice.</p>
         <p>Common among medieval Christian writers was the personification of God and Christ through the female figure of Wisdom. Such is the interpretation that Simina Farcasiu makes of Berceo’s Voxmea: “[The] figure of  Voxmea is the figure of Wisdom. The phrase ‘vox mea’ occurs only once in the Vulgate, in Proverbs 8:4: ‘O viri, ad vos clamito, et vox mea ad filios hominum.’ The detail of Voxmea’s ‘preçiosa vestidura, / Mas preçiosa que oro, más que la seda pura’ (91ab) manifests the same symbol as Oria’s name.… Thus Voxmea and Oria, through their names, are identified with Wisdom; they are, symmetrically, prefiguration and hagiographic fulfillment of the Word of God.”<sup>33</sup> Farcasiu does not develop the Voxmea/Wisdom connection in any detail; Uría Maqua objects that “decir que Oria y Voxmea se identifican con la Sabiduría a través de sus nombres es muy forzado” (to say that Oria and Voxmea are identified with Wisdom by way of their names is very forced).<sup>34</sup> I agree with Uría Maqua on this point. For the medieval Christian writer, Wisdom would not be a “prefiguration” of the Word of God but rather God himself in either the first or second person of the Trinity. Justin of Caesarea (2nd century), for example, described Jesus as the incarnation of divine wisdom, the <italic>logos</italic> “that had been active in the world throughout history.”<sup>35</sup> Emily Francomano points out that the <italic>Glossa ordinaria</italic>, the most widely read commentary on the scriptures in the Middle Ages, links wisdom directly to Christ when it declares, “Sapientia, id est Christus.”<sup>36</sup> In <italic>City of God</italic> 8.1, Augustine contends, “I may add that, since divine truth and scripture clearly teach us that God, the Creator of all things, is Wisdom, a true philosopher will be a lover of God.”<sup>37</sup> Thus, representing the voice of Wisdom as separate from that of God or Christ is theologically inconsistent. If Voxmea represents Wisdom, that is, the divine <italic>logos</italic> that emanates from God through Christ, then why represent the latter two through their own words in the same scene in which Voxmea appears? Alternately, if Voxmean represents God’s wisdom, why allow her words to contradict God’s promise to Oria?</p>
         <p>If Voxmea represents neither the Father nor the Son, and by virtue of that cannot represent Wisdom, then what about the Holy Spirit? As an incorporeal being, the Holy Spirit requires an allegorical form when represented visually. This form does not, however, imply personification, for the most common symbol of the spirit is a dove, four of which we see in the <italic>Poema de Santa Oria</italic>. Uría Maqua’s careful analysis of the doves in the poem clarifies that those carried by the three virgins who guide Oria toward heaven “son símbolos de sus almas, y la blancura sobrenatural de las palomas simboliza su pureza” (are symbols of their souls, and the supernatural whiteness of the doves symbolizes their purity).<sup>38</sup> The fourth dove, which flies upward in quatrain 44, guiding Oria toward paradise, “no representa su alma, sino el Espíritu Santo, que la conforta y le da fuerzas durante su ascensión a los cielos” (represents not her soul but the Holy Spirit, that comforts her and gives her strength during her ascent into the heavens).<sup>39</sup> Guided by the Holy Spirit, Oria does not require the help of the angels who come to the aid of the other three, for it is the presence of the Holy Spirit that allows her entrance into the great garden of paradise.<sup>40</sup> Because the Holy Spirit has appeared to Oria in the form of a dove, it is unlikely that Berceo would have chosen another symbol with which to represent it later in the narration.</p>

         <title>Voxmea as the Church Personified</title>
         <p>Another interpretation of the Voxmea figure that differs slightly from those already explored, but that still links her to Christ, is that of Anthony Lappin. In his critical edition of the poem, he asserts: <disp-quote>
               <p>Vox Mea is not an angel or a saint or any usual dweller in the heavenly realms. She is described as having three attributes: her name, her clothes, and her sex. Each of these attributes points toward her being identified as the heavenly Church. Her name, “Vox Mea,” means “My Voice,” retained as Latin by Berceo when rendering the rest of Munno’s Latin text into Romance. The presence in heaven of a figure named Vox Mea immediately calls to mind Christ, the incarnate Son of God, the “Word of God spoken by the Father’s mouth.” We may link Vox Mea to Christ. (36)<sup>41</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>Explaining that the New Testament and patristic writers, as well as the eighth-century Spanish Beatus of Liébana, identify the Old Testament figure of Wisdom with Christ, Lappin says that “Vox Mea, then, represents the Church which is the Body of Christ, the voice which transmits the Word of God, and which allows that Word to be heard, God to be perceived” (37). As personification of the church, Voxmea thus represents the bride of Christ who promises Oria a “sharing in the spiritual marriage with Christ at her death as one of the Church in heaven, one of those who are saved” (39). Furthermore, as “bearer of authority,” Voxmea “speaks for Christ” because she “is his voice,” both when Oria inquires about the chair and when she expresses a desire to stay in heaven (39). Lappin concludes his discussion of Voxmea with a contradictory commentary on the necessity of Voxmea in the vision: “The voice of Christ is not conterminous with Vox Mea, the Church. The latter is the Word incarnate, the Body of Christ, since, just as a word, to be pronounced, requires a voice, so the Word of God, to be revealed, required a human body” (41). Because Oria appeals both to God and to Christ after Voxmea tells her that she must return to her earthly body, Lappin believes that the recluse has reached a spiritual state that allows her to supersede the church as mediator and to communicate directly with the divine.</p>
         <p>On the one hand, Lappin states that both Christ and Voxmea are the Word of God and that both represent the body through which God’s word has become incarnate. On the other, despite the fact that both God and Christ speak directly to Oria, Lappin seems to believe that God’s message must be transmitted to her through Voxmea, who speaks as representative of the godhead, the church eternal whom, as he states, Oria wishes to “bypass or go beyond” (41) in a way that is, he says, “surprisingly Protestant” (43). If we are to accept the first point, that both Christ and Voxmea are the incarnate Word of God, then we equate the one with the other, fusing them into one person with two representations in the poem. Based on what has already been said, this cannot hold true since the unity of the two precludes two separate and even contradictory messages. The second point, Voxmea as personification of the church, is a more complicated argument and one that we must discard based on textual evidence. It is true that sacred tradition accepts the church as the metaphorical body of Christ on earth, the official authority through whom God gives his directives, but this body does not require a “human body” to be perceived or to be followed. I would argue that in heaven, just as on earth, Oria continues to be in the church, and that Voxmea represents the virtue of faith that has kept her there and will continue to do so upon her death. From a purely architectural point of view, we know that medieval monasticism considered the monastery and the church as representations of heaven on earth.<sup>42</sup> In Oria’s first vision, one has the impression that she has, indeed, entered a large Gothic abbey or church. Following the dove of the Holy Spirit up the ladder into the <italic>locus amoenus</italic> of colorful flowers and the great green tree—the metaphorical cloister—Oria passes through “finiestras foradadas” (opened windows) (49) into the court of heaven where, as if painted on a massive retable, she is able to see the various levels of the court and the inhabitants of each one.<sup>43</sup> Additionally, light inundates the entire scene, brighter at the top, as if pouring in through the tall windows that characterize Gothic structures.<sup>44</sup>
         </p>
         <p>At various moments in the <italic>Poema</italic>, Oria demonstrates not a parting from the “voice” of the church but rather a participation in it. She does not show a desire to supersede the authority of the church, as Lappin suggests, but to respect it and to allow its teachings and traditions to strengthen her spiritually. From the beginning we know that she follows the directive to confess her sins, for the text that Berceo claims to translate was written by Oria’s own confessor, Muño, as stated in quatrain 7:<disp-quote>
               <verse-group>
                  <verse-line>El qui lo escrivió non dirié falsedat,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>que omne bueno era, de muy grant sanctidat;</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>bien conosció a Oria, sopo su poridat,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>en todo quanto dixo, dixo toda verdat.</verse-line>
               </verse-group>
               <p>[He who wrote it would not speak falsely / since he was a good man, of very great sanctity; / he knew Oria well, he heard her secrets; / in all that he said, he said complete truth.]</p>
            </disp-quote>From an early age, indeed “Desque mudó los dientes, luego a pocos años” ( Just a few years after she had lost her first teeth) (19a), Oria takes up the dress “de los monges calaños” (similar to that of the monks) (19c) and dedicates her life to reading the Hours and praying. Likewise, as a symbolic act of unity with the church, at the end of her life Oria “fizo cruz en su fruente, santiguó su mollera” (made a cross on her forehead, blessed the top of her head) (179d). She then dies in the company of the abbot, Pedro, and the “monges e hermitaños, un general conviento” (monks and hermits, the entire convent) (181c), who dress her body in the habit of her order before burying it (182).</p>
         <p>Oria’s first vision also gives us vivid details of the role of the church’s authority in her spiritual formation, for the people that she encounters in heaven are, for the most part, figures of ecclesiastic power. She sees bishops in “casullas de preciosos colores” (chasubles of beautiful colors) (61a), carrying their staffs and chalices; a chorus of virgins (66); hermits (83); martyrs (86–88); and the apostles and first evangelists (89), of whom her guides say:<disp-quote>
               <verse-group>
                  <verse-line>Éstos son nuestros padres, cabdiellos generales,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>príncipes de los pueblos, son omnes principales,</verse-line>

               <p>[These are our fathers, our general leaders, / princes of the people, men of great importance, / Jesus Christ was pope, these the cardinals, / who ripped from the world the deadly serpents.]</p>
            </disp-quote>Through these descriptions Berceo underscores the importance of the ecclesiastic order that Oria should accept as guidance in her own spiritual formation. Thus, it is improbable that either Berceo or Muño would have created a personification of the church whose words the recluse feels she can trump by appealing to the Lord. The church of the faithful is made present through both the physical structure of heaven, as Oria sees it, and in the assembly of the faithful who have been allowed entrance into that place: “<italic>Church</italic> is a Greek word that in Latin means <italic>assembly</italic> since it calls all people to come to it.”<sup>45</sup>

         <title>Voxmea as Faith Personified</title>
         <p>Quatrain 25 of the poem tells us that Oria is a “vaso de caridad” (vessel of charity), “templo de pacïencia e de humilidat” (temple of patience and of humility), “luz” (light), and “confuerto” (comfort) to those around her. In sum, she embodies the life of faith to which the New Testament Christians aspired, as recounted in Hebrews 11, 1 Peter 1, and 2 Corinthians 5. Not having come to the end of her life, however, and soon to face grave illness that will test her “pacïencia”—she begs to be allowed to die in order to ascend to heaven—Oria must encounter the personified Faith in her first vision in order to receive the spiritual counsel that her soul requires in order to be able to see God in his fullness after her death. It is to Faith that the dove of the Holy Spirit leads Oria in her journey toward heaven, and itis the message of Faith that she must carry with her upon awaking and during the days left to her on earth. Her faith that she will indeed receive what has been promised to her underscores all of her words and actions upon waking.<sup>46</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The author of the letter to the Hebrews tells us, “Faith is the realization of what is hoped for and evidence of things not seen. Because of it the ancients were well attested. By faith we understand that the universe was ordered by the word of God, so that what is visible came into being through the invisible.”<sup>47</sup> Thirty-four verses follow in which the author enumerates acts of faith, from the Old Testament to his own time, listing names and showing how each received his or her just reward because of that faith. The following chapter, which serves structurally as the conclusion to the faith lesson, opens with “Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us rid ourselves of every burden and sin that clings to us and persevere in running the race that lies before us while keeping our eyes fixed on Jesus, the leader and perfecter of faith” (Heb. 12:1–2). In this passage we see the faithful gathered around Continence in Augustine’s <italic>Confessions</italic>, as well as the names on the gown that Voxmea wears. We find another parallel in Berceo’s liturgical commentary on the <italic>Sacrificio de la Misa</italic>, where he describes the vestments of the priests of the Old Law as inscribed with “los nomnes de los padres, prophetas principales, / e los nomnes derechos que son patrïarchales” (the names of the fathers, principal prophets, / and the legitimate names of the patriarchs) (109b–c) and the vestments of the Christian “prestes ordenados” (ordained priests) as decorated with the names of the “apóstolos e mártires” (apostles and martyrs) (115c–d).<sup>48</sup> In stanza 238 of this liturgical guide, Berceo says of the saints named on the vestments: <disp-quote>
               <verse-group>
                  <verse-line>Non serién en la missa cutiano ementados</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>si non fuessen de Dios de coraçón amados;</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>mas amáronlo ellos e fueron d’Él laudados,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>son en la sancta missa por testigos clamados.</verse-line>
               </verse-group>
               <p>[They would not be mentioned at daily Mass / if they were not loved in God’s heart; / since they loved him and were praised by him, / during the Mass they are called as witnesses.]</p>
            </disp-quote>One should note here the word “witness,” which links the New Testament teachings to the names that appear on Voxmea’s gown and to the inhabitants that Oria encounters in heaven. The three virgins who accompany Oria to heaven are martyrs, as are those in the procession in the upper levels of heaven (quatrains 86–88). Beatus of Liébana tells us that the term “martyr” signifies those who have died as witnesses to the faith, who “suffered for testifying for Christ and fought to the death in favor of the truth,” and that there are, in fact, two types of martyrs—those who suffer “public torment” at the hands of their enemies and those who voluntarily suffer “in the hidden virtue of their soul.”<sup>49</sup> Following Beatus, we should consider as martyrs the recluses who comprise the majority of the names on Voxmea’s gown, a sign to Oria that her suffering through faith will end with her name added to the list displayed there.</p>
         <p>Berceo also describes Voxmea’s gown as “más preciosa que oro” (more precious than gold) (93b), which finds its parallel in the lesson on faith from 1 Peter. There, the apostle exhorts the first Christians to remain faithful in their belief, despite possible sufferings, for the end result will be salvation: <disp-quote>
               <p>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who in his great mercy gave us a new birth to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you who by the power of God are safeguarded through faith, to a salvation that is ready to be received in the final time. In this you rejoice, although now for a little while you may have to suffer through various trials, so that the genuineness of your faith, more precious than gold that is perishable even though tested by fire, may prove to be for praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ. (1 Pet. 1:3–7)</p>
            </disp-quote>We see these verses reflected both in the material from which Voxmea’s gown is made and in the chair that she guards. The salvation that is “ready to be received” and in which the faithful rejoice is to be found not only in Oria’s eventual arrival in heaven for eternity but, more specifically, in the chair about which Berceo comments, “bien fue felix la alma por la que estava” (happy was the soul for which it was there) (92d). Oria indeed rejoices in quatrains 99 and following, having learned immediately beforehand that the chair and everything she sees there will be hers as long as she remains faithful in her service to God. This service will include the “various trials” mentioned in the letter from Saint Peter about which Voxmea forewarns Oria—“de tornar as al cuerpo, yazer emparedada” (you must return to your body, lie within your walls) (100d)—and that God himself repeats later—“aun ave un poco el cuerpo a lazrar” (your body must still suffer a while longer) (104c). Though this saddens Oria, the promise made to her by God will later bring about the joy that she shows throughout the rest of the poem as well as the desire to return to the chair guarded by Voxmea. This desire finds inspiration in other verses from 1 Peter: “Although you have not seen him, you love him; even though you do not see him now yet believe in him, you rejoice with an indescribable and glorious joy, as you attain the goal of your faith, the salvation of your soul” (8:9).</p>
         <p>In his <italic>Soliloquies</italic> (ca. 387), Augustine expounds on the nature and effects of faith in a way that we see illustrated in Oria’s actions after she awakens from her heavenly vision. Augustine writes, <disp-quote>
               <p>Now the eyes of the soul are fit when she is pure from every fleshly taint, that is, when all desire of mortal things is purged and far away, which task Faith alone is, at the outset, equal to. For this cannot be made manifest to a soul marred and diseased by lust, since unless sound she cannot see, nor will she apply herself to the labor of making herself sound if she does not believe, that, when so, she will be able to see…even while the soul is in the body, although it may behold most fully, that is, may apprehend God, nevertheless since the senses of the body serve in their own proper office, though they may cause doubt, they cannot cause delusion, and that which opposes them and believes rather that which is contrary to them to be true, so far, be called Faith.<sup>50</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>Fearing the loss of the chair and of the joy of heaven promised to her by God, Oria sets to work to ensure that her name will appear among the faithful on Voxmea’s gown. Berceo informs us that Oria “non dio en sí entrada a nulla vanagloria” (did not allow any form of vainglory to affect her) (114b) and that “non fazié a sus carnes nulla misericordia” (she showed her body no mercy) (114d). In quatrain 115 Berceo tells us that Oria, in order to remain faithful,<disp-quote>
               <verse-group>
                  <verse-line>Martiriava las carnes dándolis grant lazerío,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>cumplié días e noches su ministerio,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>jejunios e vigilias e rezar el salterio;</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>querié a todas guisas seguir el Evangelio.</verse-line>
               </verse-group>
               <p>[Martyred her flesh with great pains, / day and night she fulfilled her ministry, / fasts, vigils, and prayed the Psalms; / she wanted in every way to follow the Gospel.]</p>
            </disp-quote>Oria purges her soul of what she believes to be its diseased state, the sin trapped within, in order to “apprehend God” in the way that Augustine delineates. She castigates herself physically and mentally through fasting, continued prayer, and possibly self-flagellation. Like her mother, who earlier in the poem “martiriava sus carnes” (martyred her flesh) (21c), Oria does whatever possible to protect her “senses of the body” from falling into the devil’s snare. As O’Connell observes, “Faith is depicted as grounding, motivating the task of self-purification” that forces the believer to turn her gaze inward upon herself in order to prepare the soul “to ascend the disincarnate steps toward that light” that is Christ.<sup>51</sup> Through these acts of faith, Oria becomes a martyr (indicated not only by Beatus but also by Berceo’s use of the verb “martiriava”), thus cleansing herself and joining her soul to Christ’s suffering.</p>
         <p>Comparing Voxmea’s gown to that worn by the personified figure of the anonymous Provenzal “Poëme sur Boece,” we find several similarities that support the idea of Voxmea as a personification of faith. We know from line 200 of this poem that the brilliant gown has been made of love and faith and that the ladder embroidered on it was made with alms, faith, and love. Faith is, then, one of the primary elements of the figure’s essence. Even more, like the degrees of brilliance or obscurity with which the names of the faithful are written on Voxmea’s gown, the birds on the gown in the “Poëme” symbolize degrees of faith through their placement and color. Besides the details of their gowns, we also see a parallel in the message that each of the personifications pronounces. The “Poëme” figure states that those who grow in faith will climb the ladder toward union with the divine, though she also points out that those souls who falter in their faith fall farther down the ladder. In like manner, Voxmea encourages Oria in her works of faith but also warns her of the consequences of giving in to temptation. Though Berceo does not put the keys of the kingdom of heaven into Voxmea’s hands, as the Provenzal poet does with his figure, the guardianship of Oria’s chair does seem to give Voxmea a degree of authority over the soul of the recluse. Through her final words, however, Voxmea puts that authority into the hands of Oria herself by way of her future decisions and acts of faith. Faith is the voice of the personal spirit—Oria’s own inner <italic>vox mea</italic>—that she must confront and accept, and that guides her along the mystical and ascetic path toward the rewards that await her. The dove of the Holy Spirit leads her upward; God and Christ make promises to her; the virgins encourage her; Voxmea warns her and admonishes her to stay her course of faithfulness. Ultimately, the voice of personal faith that Oria carries inside—the voice of her own desire not only to believe in but also to obey God’s commands, the voice that prevents her from falling into temptation—is the voice to which she must listen. This is the lesson that Continence teaches Augustine, that Philosophy teaches Boethius, that Voxmea gives to Oria, and, quite possibly, that Berceo—in the last years of his life—wished to give his reader.</p>
