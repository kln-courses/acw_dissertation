<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ideograms: Pound/Michaux Richard Sieburth I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN by evoking a translation that never saw the light. In his obituary memoir of Ezra Pound, Guy Davenport notes that during his final years in Venice il miglior fabbro, having abandoned his Cantos as a colossal botch, having edged further and fur ther into silence, was nevertheless contemplating a translation of Henri Michaux's Idéogrammes en Chine. Pound's health was failing, as was his confidence in the word, and apparently after a few false starts the project was set aside. It was left to a younger American poet, Gustaf Sobin, to complete the task—with the result that Michaux's Ideograms in China was finally made available to English-speaking readers in 1984, pub lished, appropriately enough, under the Poundian imprint of New Direc tions as a latter day complement (so the blurb reads) to Pound and Ernest Fenollosa's classic study, The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry.1 Literary history is of course filled with such failed encounters— dialogues abandoned en route, aborted conversations—but it seems to me that the juncture of Pound and Michaux, however tenuous, however mute it might have been, is especially resonant, for here was Pound at the dusk of his career circling back to beginnings, returning once again to the ideograms he had first learned to haruspicate in 1913 with the aid of Fenollosa's manuscript on the Chinese character, and returning, more over, in the company of a French poet whose own graphic and literary work had since the late 20s been engaging the gist and gesture of Chinese ideogram with an intensity and an originality matched by few other artists of the 20th century. A translation of a French poet's meditations on Chinese calligraphy —the configuration is typically Poundian (think of the first Canto, a translation into Anglo-Saxonized English of a Renaissance Latin version Henri Michaux, Idéogrammes en Chine (Paris: Fata Morgana, 1975); Ideograms in China, trans.

And if Michaux's French prose poetry acts as a mediator in this transaction between East and West, Chinese and English, this too is another memory of beginnings, a trace of the China Pound first dis covered in French guise—whether it be via Pauthier's versions of Con fucius or via Judith Gautier's Livre de jade whose delicate chinoiseries Pound would extend into the haiku-like condensations of the Imagist lyric or the poems of Cathay (1915). Pound's China, a realm where Mencius speaks to Mussolini and Confucius converses with the Adams dynasty in an idiom that blends the civic apothegms of the Encyclo pedists with the hermetic evanescence of a Mallarmé, is an imaginary kingdom as quirky as any of those to be found in Michaux's Voyage en Grande Garabagne. I take Pound's late, silent dialogue with Michaux's Idéogrammes en Chine as a final, failed gesture toward this imaginary China—a last visit to the Empire of Signs (to use Barthes' term) or (if one prefers Genette) a belated Voyage en Cratylie. Blanchot observes in an essay on Michaux and Borges that one of the tasks of criticism is to render all comparison impossible.21 would there fore like to proceed by simply juxtaposing, rather than explicitly com paring, Pound's and Michaux's encounters with the Chinese character, in the hope that such a juxtaposition might tell us something about larger issues involving modernism, Cratylism, and the poetics of the sign. I use the term juxtaposition deliberately because it is fundamental to what Pound calls the "ideogrammic method," a method that underlies both the formal and didactic design of the Cantos. Pound called his poetics "ideogrammic" because he followed the sinologist Fenollosa in believing (rightly or wrongly) that the sense of individual Chinese characters was visibly generated by the juxtaposition of their graphic (or graphemic) components. Fenollosa writes, for example: The ideograph "to speak" is a mouth with two words and a flame coming out of it. The sign meaning "to grow up with difficulty" is grass with a twisted root. ... In this process of compounding, two things added together do not produce a third thing but suggest some fundamental relation between them. For example, the ideograph for a "messmate" is a man and a fire. (pp. 8-9) The key term here is relation, for as Fenollosa writes elsewhere in this same essay (predicting the structuralists): "Relations are more real and 2.

Raymond Bellour (Paris: Ed. de L'Herne, 1966), p. 80. 16 Fall 1986</page><page sequence="3">SlEBURTH more important than the things they relate" (p. 22). Which Pound foot notes: "Compare Aristotle's Poetics: 'Swift perception of relations, hall mark of genius.' " Such "swift perception of relations," associated by Aristotle with the intuition of metaphor, is what a poem like Pound's 1913 "In a Station of the Metro" is out to record and instigate. The original printing empha sized the intervals that punctuate the poem, each semantic or rhythmic cluster functioning as a discrete, autonomous character, three characters to each line: The apparition of these faces in a crowd: Petals on a wet, black bough. This technique of ideogrammic juxtaposition, still relatively simple and straightforward in Pound's "Metro" haiku, is applied at a number of levels in the Cantos. Only the scale of the units thus placed in relation changes, ranging from single words or tag phrases to complete lines or blocks of lines to entire Cantos or sequences of Cantos. Rather than explicitly articulating the syntactical (or narrative) connectives between the items thus juxtaposed, rather than subordinating one to another (hypotaxis), Pound instead situates his material side by side on the same flat surface as equivalent units of design (parataxis). Pound's paratactic disposition of seemingly unrelated particulars has of course been fre quently compared to modernist practices of collage or assemblage, but it's worth emphasizing that he conceived of his poetic method not only in the context of avant-garde experiment, but as a recovery of something profoundly traditional or archaic—after all, both the compound graphic and semantic structure of the Chinese character and the perfected para taxis of classical Chinese poetry seemed proof enough that other lan guages, other grammars of art were indeed possible.3 Sergei Eisenstein, for one, came to similar conclusions about the unexplored linguistic possibilities of cinematic montage after studying Chinese ideograms, as witnessed by the title of his 1929 essay, "The Cinematographic Principle and the Ideograph," a text roughly contemporary with Michaux's first graphic experiments with those imaginary alphabets or rebuses he would later term "compositions d'idéogrammes" or "dessins cinématiques."4 3.

Vol. XXVI, No. 3 17</page><page sequence="4">L'Esprit Créateur Pound, Eisenstein, Michaux—a critical ideogram comprised of three names working in three different media, here assembled merely to indi cate the extent to which the Chinese character, from the time of Leibniz all the way up to Sollers, has tended to speak primarily to Western eyes (and this despite the fact that 90% of Chinese characters are in fact phonetic compounds). The Imagist Pound was delighted to find in Chinese a language of signs so pictorially suggestive that his friend the French sculptor Gaudier-Brzeska could pick up a Chinese dictionary and effortlessly read the forms of many radicals at sight. Pound's mentor Fenollosa, steeped as he was in the American Transcendentalist tradi tion, encouraged his conviction that Chinese was a perfect natural language since it represented not sounds, but rather the "visible hiero glyphics" of Nature itself. Take, for example, Fenollosa's gloss on the Chinese sentence "Man sees horse." Λ 1 But Chinese notation is something much more than arbitrary symbols. It is based upon a vivid shorthand picture of the operations of nature. In the algebraic figure and in the spoken word there is no natural connection between thing and sign: all depends on sheer convention. But the Chinese method follows natural suggestion. First stands the man on his two legs. Second, his eye moves through space: a bold figure represented by running legs under an eye. . . . Third stands the horse on his four legs. . . . Legs belong to all three characters: they are alive. The group holds something of the quality of a continuous moving picture, (pp. 8-9) If one wanted to translate Fenollosa's analysis into Jakobsonian terms, one could say that according to this account, the poetic function of Chinese is foregrounded by the visual form of the signifier itself: one can actually see how the axis of selection (the legs the three characters have in common) has been projected onto the axis of combination. For Fenollosa the Chinese character is intrinsically poetic in another sense as well, for it bears "its metaphor on its face" (p. 25): the sign for sun glows like a sun, the sign for tree grows like a tree, and when you com bine the two, entangling the sun radical in the branches of the tree, you have represented East. One need only leaf through Genette's Mimolo giques to recognize Fenollosa's mirage of a non-arbitrary, fully moti vated language as a familiar avatar of Cratylism. Indeed, commenting on Claudel's 1898 "Religion du signe" (included in Connaissance de l'Est) and his later Idéogrammes occidentaux (1926), Genette observes that the 18</page><page sequence="5">SlEBURTH Chinese logogram has tended to play the same role in 20th-century Cratylism that the Egyptian hieroglyph played in the 19th.5 Fenollosa's picture theory of Chinese, however, does not merely rest on the assumption of a one-to-one correspondence between the sign and what it represents; rather, he is more concerned with groups or systems of signs, with signs in relation, in movement, in process.6 Hence the emphasis on Chinese as a cinematic "moving picture," on Chinese word order as a "transference of power" from agent to object, and hence the insistence that Chinese is composed not of nouns, but of verbs: A true noun, an isolated thing, does not exist in nature. Things are only the terminal points, or rather the meeting points, of actions, cross-sections cut through actions, snapshots. Neither can a pure verb, an abstract motion, be possible in nature. The eye sees noun and verb as one: things in motion, motion in things, and so the Chinese conception tends to represent them. (p. 10) "Things in motion, motion in things"—the mimology proposed here is based less (to use Peirce's terminology) on the iconic resemblance between the sign and what it represents than on an indexical relation of causality or contiguity between the two. Indeed, if Fenollosa or Pound consider Chinese the ideal medium for poetry, it is because its characters actually mime or respond to the very processes of Nature in a language whose signs are visibly patterned by the primal energies of the elements (much as, in Peirce's example of the indexical sign, the wind causes the weathervane to register its direction). Answering to a natura naturans, a nature in process, in the making, Chinese writing thus becomes a scrip tura scribens, a writing in and of process. Fenollosa's post-Romantic insistence on energeia over ergon ("the verb must be the primary fact of nature," "the cherry tree is all that it does") not only had a great deal to do with Pound's own drift from estheticism into activist politics (a poet is all that he does, however grievously he might err in the process), but it Gérard Genette, Mimologiques, Voyage en Cratylie (Paris: Seuil, 1976), p. 338. It should be pointed out that the mimological mirage of the Chinese ideogram as a "picture" of natural process is perhaps less crucial to Pound's actual handling of poetic language in his Cantos than it is to his economic theory, whose major obsession turns on the issue of the accurate "monetary representation" or the faithful "money picture" of available goods. Not the least of the Cantos' many paradoxes lies in the fact that while the poem's central concerns involve the fate of political or economic representation in the modern world, its actual linguistic texture is best described not in terms of mimesis but rather as semiosis, signs interpreting other signs. Michaux's meditations on the Chinese character are, as will be seen, informed by a similar oscillation between the notion of representation on the one hand, and that of signifi cation on the other. Vol. XXVI, No. 3 19</page><page sequence="6">L'Esprit Créateur also served to shape his conception of the Cantos as a kind of gigantic Action Poem—not an autonomous textual artifact, not a noun, but a verb, an ongoing enactment of individual and collective process, a per formative experiment open to whatever might at the moment be at hand, including its own incompletion or eventual ruin. I have deliberately borrowed the notion of an Action Poem from the vocabulary of modern art history (it was Harold Rosenberg who was the first to speak of Action Painting7) because it provides an obvious bridge to Michaux—poet, painter, actor, in short, inscriber of actions or agons on canvas or page, performer of dramatic events that invite reading as signs, traces of movement, vestiges of gesture. Scholars of Michaux con cur in emphasizing the centrality of le geste to his entire work—whether it be the onomatopoetic vocal gesticulations of Michaux's "nonsense" verse or the calligraphic pantomime that is a trademark of his drawings.8 Michaux describes as follows the process recorded in Mouvements, a series of some 1200 sheets of ideogrammic signs enacted in encre de Chine over the course of 1950-51: "C'étaient des gestes, les intérieurs, ceux pour lesquels nous n'avons pas de membres mais des envies de mem bres, des tensions, des élans et tout cela en cordes vivantes, jamais épaisses, jamais grosses de chair ou fermées de peau" (Henri Michaux, op. cit., p. 69). Gestures incarnating, dramatizing something beyond or before the body, gestures realizing themselves in or as signs, the sheer generation or proliferation of which allows Michaux to leave words behind: C'est précisément au contraire pour m'avoir libéré des mots, ces collants parténaires, que les dessins sont élancés et presque joyeux, que leurs mouvements m'ont été légers à faire même quand ils sont exaspérés. Aussi vois-je en eux, nouveau langage, tournant le dos au verbal, des libérateurs . . . une écriture inespérée, soulageante, où [on] pourra enfin s'exprimer loin des mots, des mots des autres. (Henri Michaux, op. cit., p. 71) To which one might juxtapose Julia Kristeva's essay on gesture in Semiotikë which addresses gestuality as an instance of sheer production, sheer expenditure, in other words, as a semiotic practice that puts into question not only the conventional communicative function of verbal language, but more crucially the phonocentric priority generally 7.

Le système sémiotique des Dogon [Kristeva's semiotopia now migrates from China to Africa] qui finalement semble être plutôt un système séman tique scriptural que verbal, repose ainsi sur l'indication: apprendre à parler pour eux, c'est apprendre à indiquer en traçant, (p. 35) This revisionary Derridean myth of origins, which stages the anterior ity of écriture (writing, tracing, drawing) to speech, brings us to Michaux's own Fables des origines, to quote the title of one of his earliest books (1923). In his semi-autobiographical Emergences-Résurgences (1972), he tells the origin story of his own career as a writer-painter. In the beginning was the line, the trace, the parcours and division of space: Moi aussi, un jour, tard, adulte, il me vient une envie de dessiner, de participer au monde par des lignes. Une ligne plutôt que des lignes. Ainsi je commence, me laissant mener par une, une seule, que sans relâcher le crayon de dessus le papier je laisse courir, jusqu'à ce qu'à force d'errer sans se fixer dans cet espace réduit, il y ait obligatoirement arrêt." This is line as sheer process, having no other motive than its own explora tory traversal of the field of the page. This nomadic, somnambulistic line, a kind of seismographic indicator of the aleatory psychic and physical vectors that have converged on the page, is Michaux's own ver sion of surrealistic automatic writing. But having given himself over to line, to pure parcours or trajet, Michaux soon finds himself confronting signs. Pages emerge covered with imaginary alphabets (which he calls "des sortes de pictogrammes" or "idéogrammes"), their squiggles and strokes arranged into furrows of writing. 9.

[£-/?] Vol. XXVI, No. 3 21</page><page sequence="8">L'Esprit Créateur Here is Michaux's retrospective account of these Alphabets or Narra tions which he drew/wrote in 1927: Plus tard, les signes, certains signes. Les signes me disent quelque chose. J'en ferais bien, mais un signe, c'est aussi un signal d'arrêt. Or en ce temps je garde un autre désir, un par dessus tous les autres. Je voudrais un continuum. Un continuum comme un murmure, qui ne finit pas, semblable à la vie, qui est ce qui nous continue. ... Je veux que mes tracés soient le phrasé même de la vie, mais souple, mais déformable, sinueux. (E-R, 13) On the one hand, Michaux's move from the single unbroken line into a series of signs embodies an attempt to discover a kind of language or semiotic system that goes beyond (or before) the conventionalized marks of writing or pictorial representation—a series of signifiants without signifiés (or rather, whose signifié would simply be the desire to write, to draw, to inscribe, to sign), a purely private alphabet that would free him from having to speak (or paint) like anybody else, a succession of signs that one might term /rf/ograms (somewhat on the order of the neologistic idiolect he was experimenting with during this same period in the poems of Qui je fus). On the other hand, Michaux's discovery of signs is, as he notes, also an encounter with a certain kind of blockage or stoppage, for as the continuous line breaks up into a sequence or grouping of signs, an impetus is lost, a fixity sets in—"un signe, c'est aussi un signal d'arrêt." Such stasis or arrest of course goes directly counter to Michaux's desire to embody a continuum, a durée, an unbroken murmur of motion —and the fact that he titles these imaginary alphabets or pictograms Narration indicates just how far this aesthetic of continuity lies from Pound's ideogrammic poetics of parataxis which aims instead at pul verizing the syntagms of narrative, at erasing transitions, at opening up intervals and gaps via a constructivist technique of collage or jumpcut montage that serves to isolate the individual sign or groups of signs thus juxtaposed. Michaux, by contrast, wants to surmount such segmenta tion, to eliminate the problematic space in between by the sheer rapidity of his parcours across it. His mescaline writings and drawings of the 50s, for example, register a state of flux where there is virtually no intervening vacuum between images or traits, but rather a plenum of uninterrupted pulsations and oscillations.12 Similarly, if Michaux's poetry favors prose lineation over le vers (and a prose, moreover, that is often narrative in 127 See Malcolm Bowie, Henri Michaux: A Study of His Literary Works (Oxford: Claren don Press, 1973), pp. 161-63. 22 Γ ALL l^OU</page><page sequence="9">thrust), it is largely because he is after a fluidity, a métonymie continuity or kinesis that will somehow enact the ongoing pulse or tempo of l'élan vital. Michaux's early ideogrammic drawings, he tells us in Emergences Résurgences, led to an impasse or échec which caused him to abandon painting altogether for a number of years. It was only in the course of his travels to the Far East in 1930-31 that he suddenly recognized what he had been looking for in his earlier explorations of lines and signs: Mais c'est la peinture chinoise qui entre en moi en profondeur, me convertit. Dès que je la vois, je suis acquis définitivement au monde des signes et des lignes. Les lointains préférés au proche, la poésie de l'incomplétude préférée au compte rendu, à la copie. Les traits lancés, voltigeants, comme saisis par le mouvement d'une inspiration soudaine et non pas tracés prosaïquement, laborieusement, exhaustivement . . . voilà qui me parlait, me prenait, m'emportait. La peinture, cette fois, sa cause était gagnée. (E-R, 16) In Un Barbare en Asie, Michaux's 1933 travelogue of this same journey, he had similarly underscored the importance of this semiotic encounter with the exotic, for in China he discovered a tradition of painting, writ ing, and theater that was at once concrete and abstract, material and immaterial, stable and fluid, a tradition, in short, grounded not in mimesis, not in la copie, but rather in the art of signification: Le Chinois possède la faculté de réduire l'être à l'être signifié (quelque chose comme la faculté mathématique ou algébraïque). Si un combat doit prendre place, il ne livre pas le combat, il ne le simule pas. Il le signifie. Cela seul l'intéresse, le combat lui-même lui paraîtrait grossier.13 Or as Michaux will later put it in Idéogrammes en Chine: "Ne plus imiter la nature. La signifier. Par des traits, des élans." Trait, as Barthes remarks, is a term shared both by the graphic arts and by linguistics.14 It suggests a kind of diacritical marking that is fundamental to the Chinese conception of wen, a character that signifies a conglomeration of marks, whether these be the veins of stones or of wood, the strokes that connect stars into constellations, the tracks of animals on the ground, or finally the art of writing, of literature, and of social courtesy.15 Un Barbare en Asie (Paris: Gallimard, 1933), pp. 156-57. It might be noted in passing that this book was later translated into English (New York: New Directions, 1949) by Sylvia Beach, friend of Pound and publisher of Joyce.

Vol. XXVI, No. 3 23</page><page sequence="10">L'Esprit Créateur Michaux's 1931 visit to the Empire of Signs, according to his own account, verified his vocation as an adept of wen, as an adventurer in that semiotic no-man's-land that exists somewhere between (or perhaps before) visual and verbal language. An entire strand of Michaux's graphic œuvre shows his drawing or painting constantly moving toward the territory of writing. His early Alphabets or Narrations of 1927 will resurface in the rebuses of Epreuves, Exorcismes (1945), the ideogram mic élans of Mouvements (1951), the serial gouache bestiaries of 1952, the India and sepia ink canvases of 1961-62, the gouache calligrams of 1965-66, or the anthropomorphic acrylics and aquarelles of the 70s. But if the graphic so often tends toward the graphemic in Michaux, the reverse is also true, perhaps nowhere more so than in the 1956 mescaline drawings of Misérable Miracle in which the horizontal lettering of actual words on the page gradually disintegrates into a series of unintelligible vertical or transversal strokes that resemble the gibberish penmanship of a Saul Steinberg or the unreadable tags of a subway graffiti artist. Michaux's explorations of the process whereby drawing or painting translate into writing and vice versa (to which one should also add his many books in which the illustrative relation of text to image is virtually reversible) prepare his 1971 return to China in Idéogrammes en Chine, a late mellow meditation on his own career in and amongst signs, an ars poetica that reads like an autumnal episode in the adventures of Mon sieur Plume. Idéogrammes en Chine was initially written as an intro duction to Leon Tchang's La Calligraphie chinoise,16 The text therefore presents itself in the form of a commentary or, to quote the title of Michaux's book on Magritte, En rêvant à partir de peintures énig matiques (1972), as a revery inspired by the samples of Chinese cal ligraphy that intersperse his French text and which provide the themes on which his commentary will play its variations. Just as Michaux takes Magritte's paintings and turns them into stories, so Idéogrammes links its visual pre-texts into a chronicle evoking the genealogy and evolution of Chinese writing. Its overall plot may be summarized as follows: 1) writing at its origin, 2) the loss of origin, 3) the recovery of origin via etymology, 4) writing-as-representation moving toward writing-as signification, and 5) the return, via abstraction, to Nature and origins. 16.

As in the Fenollosa-Pound essay on the Chinese character, a Cratylis tic nostalgia haunts Michaux's meditations on calligraphy. After a brief introductory section which registers the inevitable bewilderment of the Western eye upon first encountering a page of Chinese calligraphy ("traits dans toutes les directions," "des griffures, des brisures," "gribouillis"), Michaux passes beyond this stage of originary confusion to evoke the dawn of Chinese writing in the Chou Dynasty, the mythic era of ku-wen bronze inscriptions: Il y eut pourtant une époque, où les signes étaient encore parlants, ou presque, allusifs déjà, montrant plutôt que choses, corps ou matières, montrant des groupes, des ensembles, exposant des situations. Il y eut une époque. But this "lisibilité primitive," this Golden Age of "le réel originel, le concret et les signes qui en étaient proches," is succeeded by a period in which "le goût de cacher" and "le plaisir d'abstraire" invade writing, as the stolid chisel of the bronze or stone engraver gives way to the nimble brush of the calligrapher. An age of increasing abstraction and conceal ment, an age when writing loses its open, public face to become an elite secret shared by the scribal initiate. Michaux's cadences grow noticeably elegaic: S'abstraire l'avait emporté. Être mandarin l'avait emporté. Disparus, les archaïques caractères qui émouvaient le cœur. Disparus, les signes sen sibles qui comblaient leurs inventeurs, qui émerveillèrent leurs premiers lecteurs. Disparue la vénération, la naïveté, la poésie première... Coupés les ponts avec l'origine... Disparus, les caractères "sentis," penchés sur la réalité... With the sign thus increasingly alienated from its natural model, the aura of the written character as ritual object or event now recedes: "La religion en l'écriture reculait. L'irréligion d'écriture commençait." Sacred gives way to secular scripture. But in this world of the Fall, where writing now functions as an agent Vol. XXVI, No. 3 25</page><page sequence="12">L'Esprit Créateur of exclusion and concealment, there is nonetheless hope of redemption: as scholars piously regather the ancient characters into indexes (circa 120 A.D.), a first etymological dictionary (the Shuo-wen) is born, restoring words to their origins, resurrecting the characters from their tombs of abstraction. At this etymological juncture Michaux's text suddenly soars into a Whitmanesque (or Borgesian) catalogue of this rediscovered pleni tude, as he inventories the wealth of a world filled with things, events, signs: pleine de lunes, pleine de cœurs, pleine de portes pleine d'hommes qui s'inclinent qui se retirent, qui s'en veulent, qui font la paix pleine d'obstacles pleine de mains droites, de mains gauches de mains qui s'étreignent, qui se répondent, qui se lient à jamais These anaphoric "pleines de" continue for two pages, a familiar variant on one of Michaux's favorite modes—the abécédaire, the bestiary, the taxonomy, the serial proliferation of signs. This profusion is made pos sible by an etymological perspective that resituates (or remotivates) the sign in relation to its source—as Fenollosa remarked, poets proceed by "feeling back along the ancient lines of advance," a process particularly evident in Michaux's own ideogrammic drawings and paintings which are in a sense etymologies of gesture, enactments of their own origin, mimings of the moment at which signs, not yet fully bearers of sense, begin to come into being. This explains, I think, why Michaux's allegorical history of the ideo gram should now move from etymology into the next stage, the develop ment of calligraphy, the sign in (or as) action. The increasingly stylized strokes of the calligrapher represent for Michaux a further (and higher) retreat from iconicity, from resemblance: Longtemps, le Chinois avait, comme en d'autres domaines, subi le charme de la ressem blance; d'abord de la proche, puis de la lointaine ressemblance, puis de la composition aux éléments ressemblants. Barrière aussi. Il avait fallu la sauter. Même celle de la plus lointaine ressemblance. Course sans retour. Ressemblance définitivement en arrière. Les Chinois étaient appelés à un autre destin. Abstraire c'est se libérer, se désenliser. Abstraction, associated earlier with secrecy and concealment and serving the hegemony of a scribal elite, now re-emerges as a religious ascesis or 26 Fall 1986</page><page sequence="13">SlEBURTH gnosis. Ritualized into the art of calligraphy, this action writing/painting completely dematerializes the world into a condition of pure speed, pure flight, pure mind: "Le destin du chinois dans l'écriture était l'absolue non-pesanteur." But if calligraphy enables the material body of the sign to be transfigured into pure spirit, the very activity of this scriptura scribens nonetheless plunges us back (by a kind of dialectical reversal) into the immanent energies of a natura naturans. Freed from imitating nature, signs may now signify it, respond to it, take part in its wen: Ne plus imiter la nature. La signifier. Par des traits, des élans. Ascèse de l'immédiat, de l'éclair. Tels qu'ils sont actuellement, éloignés de leur mimétisme d'autrefois, les signes chinois ont la grâce de l'impatience, l'envol de la nature, sa diversité, sa façon inégalable de savoir se ployer, rebondir, se redresser. Comme fait la nature, la langue en Chine propose à la vue, et ne décide pas.... Caractères ouverts sur plusieurs directions. Equilibration.... La calligraphie, son rôle médiateur, et de communion, et de suspens.... Calligraphie auprès de laquelle, plus simplement, on se tient comme auprès d'un arbre, d'une roche, d'une source. At the end of this long detour through China, Michaux thus rediscovers a modernist version of the ancient dream of Cratylus, a semiotopia in which all his works, all his gestures, all his tracés will bespeak "le phrasé même de la vie."
