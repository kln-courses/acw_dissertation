<plain_text><page sequence="1">Prophetic Concealment in a Biblical Type Scene BRIAN BRITT Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Blacksburg, VA 24061 In several scenes of prophetic commission or recommission, particular emphasis falls on the silence or concealment of the prophet. Considering the obvious paradox of a silent or covered prophet and the general scarcity of bio- graphical detail in the Bible, these episodes have often puzzled scholars or escaped their attention.1 Those who take note of the veil of Moses and the mantle of Elijah tend to associate these coverings with cultic practices.2 Taking Moses and Elijah as models, I identify prophetic silence or concealment as part of a type scene of prophetic crisis and commission (or recommission). Moses wears a veil in Exodus 34, and Elijah's face is covered in 1 Kgs 19: 13. But the two texts share a number of other elements that appear in other prophetic narratives, including theophany, danger, fasting, the prophet's face, rival proph- ets, and silence. In Ezekiel, the prophet's face is covered at one point, and at other times he is commanded to be silent and restrained (Ezekiel 12 and 3-4). Many of these elements appear in Amos 8:9-14; Exod 33:7-23; 1 Samuel 28; 1 Kings 18; Mie 3:7; and Ezekiel 3-4. Does the resemblance reflect the imitation of Exodus by 1 Kings or a common prophetic tradition? What emerges from this 1 Johannes Lindblom ( Prophecy in Ancient Israel [Philadelphia: Fortress, 1965] 68) notes the scarcity of such narrative detail. Hugo Gressmann {Mose und seine Zeit: Ein Kommentar zu den Mose-Sagen [FRLANT 18; Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1913] 246-51) and others associate the veil with traditions of cultic masking. Gustav Hölscher {Die Profeten: Untersuchungen zur Religionsgeschichte Israels [Leipzig: Hinrichs, 1914] 145-47; cited in Lindblom, Prophecy in Ancient Israel, 68) attributes Elijah's mantle to traditions of prophetic garb. 37</page><page sequence="2">38 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 64, 2002 analysis is a scene of variable type in which, among other things, the prophet is concealed (or restrained) at a moment of danger and theophany. My analysis supports and extends Theodor Seidl' s suggestion that Exodus 33 and 1 Kings 19 share a common prophetic tradition of crisis and recommissioning. The biblical focus on prophetic concealment and silence may point back toward cultic dimen- sions of ancient Near Eastern prophecy, and by making silence, crisis, and con- cealment typical, these scenes contribute to biblical conceptions of prophecy and revelation.3 My thesis, then, is that Exodus 32-34 and 1 Kings 19 both come from a vari- able-type scene in which the prophet is concealed or restrained at a moment of danger and theophany.4 In my analysis, "prophet" is defined broadly as one to whom Yhwh speaks.5 The four elements of the proposed type scene are as fol- lows. First, the prophet faces a crisis, usually because the people have broken the covenant. A theophany comes next, followed by the third element, the commis- sioning or recommissioning of the prophet. Finally, a new divine plan is given and it takes effect immediately. Along with these basic four elements, the type scenes also include references to food or fasting, rival prophets and mantic practices, and the concealment or restraint of the prophet. Other elements appear frequently as well, as table 1 on pp. 20-21 shows. In formal terms, this type scene represents common narrative elements viewed synchronously; the elements are mixed and matched with varying uses and meanings. In thematic terms, the type scene enacts the commission or recom- missioning of a prophet, often by reference to the covenant. This essay introduces the type scene in a preliminary way, casting the net widely, and discusses only one of its minor elements: prophetic concealment or constraint, an element that indi- cates not only divine displeasure but also the dynamic relationship between con- cealment and revelation in divine-human communication.6 I must qualify the thesis, however, by stressing how scarce narrative and biographical detail about biblical prophets can be. Sustained characterization is rare in biblical tradition, and its purpose always extends from the individual to 3 Theodor Seidl, "Mose und Elija am Gottesberg: Überlieferungen zu Krise und Konversion der Propheten," BZ 37 (1993) 1-25, here 4. 4 My concept of type scene matches more or less Robert Alter' s idea ( The Art of Biblical Narrative [New York: Basic Books, 1981] 50), borrowed from Homeric scholar Walter Arend, that "there are certain fixed situations which the poet is expected to include in his narrative and which he must perform according to a set order of motifs - situations like the arrival, the message, the voyage . . . and some half-dozen others." 5 See Lothar Perlitt, "Mose als Prophet," EvT 31 (1971) 588-608. 6 A complete study of all the elements would go beyond the scope of this essay. Because of my interest in notions of communication and revelation, the element I pursue here is prophetic concealment or restraint. The proposed type scene may have roots in ancient Sagen , but my analysis, unlike traditional form criticism, operates synchronically at the level of the received text.</page><page sequence="3">PROPHETIC CONCEALMENT 39 collective religious concerns. The cases of the present type scene appear more as sketches than complete portraits, and the patterns linking them are thus fragmen- tary. A second qualification is that the type scene varies considerably from case to case, in terms of both context and meaning. Such variation is not unusual in the study of folklore, however. Susan Niditch notes: "With its emphasis on per- formance, folklore leads away from notions of rote borrowing, wooden adapta- tion, and scholastic redaction. . . . Instead we look to composers at home in a tradition, weaving tales out of familiar narrative threads or audiences who identify with the same set of cultural assumptions."7 More importantly, these variations represent the distinctive biblical texts and messages in which they appear. Given such variation, the analytical value of a pattern such as this type scene is admit- tedly modest. Alexander Rofé observes: The search for the purpose of a story and its place in the history of the type, together with comparison with kindred material, can give us a clue to its classification. But very little is thereby said about the unique artistic nature of that story. The description of this distinctive element of the literary work - when we are confronted with such - can be obtained only by close reading of the work itself.8 I. Comparable Analyses of Narrative Patterns I am not the first to observe some of these patterns. The present type scene may be seen as a variation or elaboration of Norman Habel' s form-critical analysis of call narratives, which includes the five elements of divine confrontation: intro- ductory word (corresponding to crisis and theophany in my terms), commission, objection, reassurance, and sign (loosely corresponding to divine plan in my terms).9 It also builds on Burke Long's observation that 44 4stock scenes' involving lament- ing, petitioning prophet and divine answer with patterns of reporting theophany, especially as seen in the Mosaic traditions, have shaped this text." 10 Robert Cohn identifies the following fivefold pattern in 1 Kings 17; 18; and 19: announcement, 7 Susan Niditch, Underdogs and Tricksters (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1987) 146.

The type scene partly overlaps the Canaanite-based pattern Frank Cross describes as the "council of the gods," in which the prophet serves as messenger to the people from the divine council of El (in Canaanite religion) or Yhwh. Prominent examples are 1 Kgs 22:5-28; Psalm 82; Isa 6:1-12; and Second Isaiah. Elements of this pattern include the calling of the prophet, divine judgments, and covenant lawsuit.12 While the mythical substrate of the divine council does play into some cases of the type scene, my analysis lies more at the canonical level of biblical tradition, at which prophetic commission and communication emerge as prominent literary and religious concerns. Another grouping of similar traditions is Dorothy Irvin' s "episode of sending the saviour."13 Irvin includes Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Job with Moses in her list of examples. Nonbiblical sources include Enuma Elish, Baal and Yam, Bel and the Labbu, Anzu, Telepinu, and Keret. Irvin lists seventeen elements in this episode, including the statement of a problem; the meeting of the divine assembly; the calling of a hero; scenes where the hero demurs and is then reassured; wonders worked by or for the hero; and, after instructions, the hero's departure, a conflict, and its outcome.14 The type scene bears close resemblance to Mesopotamian stories of heavenly ascent. Geo Widengren identifies eleven elements in this pattern, including ascent to heaven and entrance into a heavenly palace; rituals of purification, anointing, robing in royal or heavenly garments; transfer of heavenly book or tablets to the seer; and sending forth with a commission to instruct the generation.15 Although the Mesopotamian texts involve the heavenly enthronement of a king, the parallels 11 Robert L.

Eckhard von Nordheim ("Ein Prophet kündigt sein Amt auf [Elia am Horeb]," Bib 59 [1978] 153-73, here 159-60) and Long (I Kings, 196-97) divide chap. 19 into different but similar units. 12 Frank Moore Cross, Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic (Cambridge, MA: Harvard Univer- sity Press, 1973) 186-88. 13 Dorothy Irvin, "The Joseph and Moses Narratives," in Israelite and Judaean History (ed.

An incomplete example is the following passage from an enthronement hymn: Shamash and Adad to their assembly [called him] . . . Shamash and Adad on a great golden throne [placed him], to inspect oil on water, the secret of Anu, [Enlil and Ea, they taught him].

There are two main differences, however, between these other typologies and mine: first, mine is restricted to biblical prophecy (broadly conceived), which excludes most king-figures and scenes of heavenly ascent that would suggest any kind of apotheosis. Second, the present type scene is more detailed and specific than many of the others - those of Habel and Cross, for instance. Simply stated, this type scene points out patterns within the already well-established patterns of commissioning (or recommissioning) the prophet. The more broadly one draws the circle of traditions, the less specific their patterns become. In other words, there are more similarities between Exodus 34 and 1 Kings 19 than there are between all the biblical examples of the type scene; and these, in turn, have more in common with each other than they do with nonbiblical patterns. Before turning to the structure of the type scene, I wish to introduce the element of concealment or restraint, especially by means of garments. II. Prophetic Garments Most prophetic concealment or restraint is accomplished by a garment: a veil, mantle, cloak, or the cords or netting that bind Ezekiel. For Samuel and Elijah, the mantle is a symbol of their prophetic office, just as priests have their own professional dress (see Exodus 28). The garments may be traditional modes of prophetic dress, whether they come from Canaanite cultic practices associated with the worship of Baal or from bedouin tradition.17 The motif even appears in the Qur'an, where Muhammad is wrapped in a cloak (Suras 73-74). There may have been other physical markings - on prophets' heads or hands, for example (see 1 Kgs 20:35; 2 Kgs 2:23 [tonsure]; Ezek 9:4; Isa 44:5; Genesis 4), 18 but the evidence here is sketchy. Another possible association of the garments and concealment is the heaven- ly garments of Mesopotamian tradition. Heavenly garments appear in the Slavonic Book of Enoch, Third Enoch, the Apocalypse of Abraham, the Ascension of Isaiah, some Mandean texts, and in Exodus Rabbah .19 Whether these garments have a common narrative ancestry with the garments of our type scene goes beyond the scope of this article, but two quick observations are warranted. The purpose of heavenly garments would seem antithetical to the veil and mantle, which are appar- ently meant to conceal and protect. Nevertheless, there is a Samaritan tradition of 16 Widengren, Ascension of the Apostle, 21. 17 See Lindblom {Prophecy in Ancient Israel , 66), who adduces evidence from 2 Kgs 1:8; Isa 20:2; Zech 13:4; Gen 3:21; and Matt 3:4. 18 Lindblom, Prophecy in Ancient Israel , 67. An important analogy is the turban worn by priests, mandated in Exod 28:4; the same term (DS325D) describes a kingly turban in Ezek 21:31. 19 See Schultz, "Angelic Opposition," 291-94.</page><page sequence="8">44 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 64, 2002 Moses' veil that presents it as a sign of heavenly glory rather than a concealment: "You [Moses] . . . who dwelt in the cloud and wore the shining light for which was prepared a great veil from on high to magnify it."20 Second, even if the purpose of these garments is different, this variation does not rule out some inter- connection. My purpose is not to link the type scene to traditions of prophetic dress or heavenly garments, but only to suggest a possible connection. As my analysis of the type scene will show, the concealment or restraint of the prophet, whatever its literary origins may be, highlights crises of the covenant as well as the process of divine revelation. III. 1 Kings 19 and Exodus 34 Most scholars see the Elijah narrative as written in the tradition of Moses. In a recent article, Jörg Jeremias summarizes the common threads: the forty days and nights, the cave, the use of the term in narratives of the theophany, the succession narrative, and its apparent timing in the morning.21 But Theodor Seidl sees them as sharing a common prophetic tradition that includes crisis, theophany, dialogue, and recommissioning.22 James Nohrnberg raises the possibility that Moses is portrayed to imitate Elijah.23 And Joseph Blenkinsopp cites the sugges- tion that the succession narrative of Elijah and Elisha influenced the commission of the seventy elders and the succession of Moses and Joshua.24 Without deciding the historical order of the Moses and Elijah stories, I wish to point out several links between the two narratives and other cases of prophetic concealment or restraint in times of crisis. This pattern includes not only Moses and Elijah but also Ezekiel, Jeremiah, and, more incidentally, Amos, Micah, Samuel, Isaiah, and Zechariah. Although biblical prophets are those who deliver divine messages through words and actions, there is considerable attention paid to when they do not communicate the divine message. These episodes of prophe- tic concealment and silence are even more striking in light of how little we are told about the prophets' lives and actions in the first place. With the possible exception of Jeremiah, biblical prophets are not three-dimensional literary charac- ters; their job is to perform the role of prophet, and their personal fate, when it does emerge in the narrative, always reflects or contrasts the fate of Israel and its 20 Memar Markah 6.11, cited in Linda Belleville, Reflections of Glory: Paul's Polemical Use of the Moses-Doxa Tradition in 2 Corinthians 3.1-18 (JSOTSup 52; Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1991) 51.

The episodes of prophetic silence and restraint described here must have to do, therefore, with matters of covenant and revelation generally. IV. The Type Scene The proposed type scene changes the frame of reference for studying the stories of Moses and Elijah; the standard assumption is that the Elijah story derives from the Moses story. But when the frame of reference is expanded through the synchronic category of the type scene, then we can posit a type scene that includes the elements I am about to describe. Elijah is no longer derived only from Moses, but from a well-established set of elements - a type scene - that gives the audience a frame of reference. The advantage of this proposal, I suggest, is that it helps explain how the Moses story is extraordinary - a variation on the type scene - even though it appears to have influenced the story of Elijah. The elements and patterns of the type scene can suggest a literary norm against which the various instances were created. Here is a brief description of the type scene as it unfolds in 1 Kings 18-19 and Exodus 32-34: 1. The prophet faces a crisis and danger because of a rebellious people. Having defeated the prophets of Baal, Elijah must flee for his life to the desert. In Exodus, Moses complains that the people are faithless after he destroys the golden calf. Both prophets consider their own death. Only a reaffirmation of the prophet's commission and the covenant can overcome this crisis. 2. The second element of the type scene is a theophany. In the case of Elijah and Moses, this occurs at Sinai/Horeb. The details of the two scenes - the passing by ("13S7) of God as the prophet sits in the cleft of rock, the forty days, the dialogue between God and prophet - are all well documented. The nature of a theophany also requires the concealment of the prophet's face during and after the appearance of God. 3. The third main element is the commissioning or recommissioning of the prophet. The moment of negativity, concealment, and silence must be overcome. This requires not only the theophany, which tends to be one-sided and awesome, but also a dialogue between God and the prophet. This dialogue, repetitive and brief, leads to a new affirmation of the prophet's task and an immediate plan of action.25 For Elijah, instructions to anoint kings of Syria and Israel and the commis- sioning of Elisha follow immediately. Moses, for his part, receives a second set 25 The problem here is how to interpret the repetitions: are they scribal interpolations or literary devices? Three scholars who find meaning rather than scribal duplication in this episode are Klaus Seybold, "Elia am Gottesberg," EvT 33 (1973) 3-18, here 6-7; Uriel Simon, Reading Prophetic Narratives (trans. Lenn Schramm; Indiana Studies in Biblical Literature; Bloomington/Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1997) 215-17; and Peter Höffken, "Einige Aspekte des Textes 'Elia am</page><page sequence="10">46 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 64, 2002 of law tablets, punishes wrongdoers, and returns to the people with a shining face and a veil. In both cases, a reaffirmation of the covenant is implied: the sin of idol worship is punished, and those who observe the covenant are promised survival under the prophet's authority. 4. Immediately following the third element is the enactment of the new divine plan. Without delay, steps are taken to return the prophet to the role as mediator between God and people, and the narrative moves on. This sometimes involves the continuation of a physical journey: back to Israel, back into battle, or back to the work of mediating between God and people. So far, most scholars recognize these patterns as the imitation of the Moses narrative by the Elijah narrative. I would add two new suggestions to this founda- tion: first, that several other narratives fit the description of this type scene, and second, that the concealment, restraint, or silence of the prophet is an important and distinctive element of the type scene. The form and meaning of specific cases of the type scene vary, but there are several elements that establish their common typology. Complete cases of this type scene number at least five: (1) Exodus 3-4; (2) Exo- dus 32-34; (3) 1 Kings 17-19; (4) 1 Samuel 28; (5) Ezekiel 3-4. In addition to the four basic parts of the type scene outlined so far, other details appear in many cases: fasting or food miracles,26 rival prophets, theophany with elements of fire, cloud, rock clefts or caves, the mention of the prophet's death, and the presence of a successor or assistant to the prophet (see table 1). But in almost every case there is a reference to the concealment or silence of the prophet, though some of these passages are brief, such as the "famine of words" described in Amos 8:11. These secondary elements sometimes come to the foreground, for example, in the fascinating encounter between the "man of God from Judah" and the old prophet of Bethel in 1 Kgs 13: 1 1-34. When the prophet of Bethel tricks the other man into breaking his fast, the man from Judah is killed by a lion. But instead of gloating on his victory over a rival prophet, the prophet of Bethel mourns him and reports the incident to Jeroboam, who disregards the story's ominous implications for his own irreligious behavior. What begins as a story about rival prophets becomes a tale of prophetic reconciliation (albeit post-mortem) and a criticism of a wicked king. Mentions of food in the type scene can relate to fasting, sacrifice, divine provision, or divine displeasure. Despite this clear variety, these food-related Horeb' - 1 Könige 19," BZ 42 (1998) 71-80. See also the methodological reflections in Rofé, "Classi- fication of the Prophetical Stories," 427-40. 26 As Widengren points out ( Ascension of the Apostle, 3, 129-38), ritual eating and drinking also appear in the Enuma Elish. See also Exod 24: 1 1 .</page><page sequence="11">PROPHETIC CONCEALMENT 47 elements all reinforce the main concern in the type scene for the prophet's commu- nication about the covenant. Cohn links food in 1 Kings 17-19 to divine sponsor- ship.27 Fasting can indicate pious observance (Jonah 3:5-7). In some cases, the prophet is fed miraculously (Judges 6; 1 Kings 18; Ezekiel 3-4), at other times after a fast (1 Samuel 28; 1 Kings 13), and sometimes as part of a symbolic action (Ezek 12:18-19). Food can also punish covenant violation. The wrongful feasting before the golden calf (Exod 32:6) gives rise to the punishment of drinking the burned calf ground into water (32:20). Complaints about food, typical of the narratives of the wandering (Exodus 16 and Num 20:5), motivate the miracle-turned-plague of the quails in Numbers 11. Like other examples of the type scene, a covenantal crisis becomes personal for the prophet, who contemplates his own death (Num 11:15). The subsequent theophany and the miracle of the quails lead to divine provision as well as divine punishment. Meanwhile, two rival prophets appear on the scene, and in the next episode (Numbers 12) Moses faces two additional rivals - Miriam and Aaron - who challenge his uniqueness. The divine response, that Moses "is entrusted with all my house" and that God speaks to him "face to face," redoubles the message of most cases of the type scene: that the prophet's role is to commu- nicate, to reveal the divine will with respect to the covenant. The type scene does not prove so precise that it has its own vocabulary, but there are a number of terms common to many instances. The most striking is *"QX7, which has already been noticed as a typical word in theophany episodes (see table l).28 Other frequently appearing terms are (1 Sam 28:14) and mitt (1 Kgs 19:13, 19; 2 Kings 2; Jonah 3:6; Zech 13:4), both words for cloaks or robes; the face (D"05D) of God and the prophet, sometimes covered or shielded OnO) and sometimes revealed (Exod 3:2-12; 33:20-23; 34:8; 1 Kgs 19:13; 19:10-25; Micah 3; Isaiah 6; Ezekiel 3).29 A. Literary Analysis of 1 Kings 19 In 1 Kings 19 fasting, commission, crisis, dialogue, and theophany are the key elements. The lingering questions about the chapter are its literary history, the meaning of the theophany with its threefold denial and Hpl HQDH Tip, and why the question-and-answer dialogue are repeated. I will address these questions in turn. As to the text's literary history, there is general agreement that the Elijah traditions come from a distinct body of legend that is later refashioned in the image 27 Cohn, "Literary Logic of 1 Kings 17-19," 346. Denise Dick Herr ("Variations of a Pattern: 1 Kings 19," JBL 104 [1985] 292-94) concurs with Cohn and adds the suggestion that variations in the narrative pattern of 1 Kings 17-19 are also meaningful. The absence of food in chap. 19, she proposes (p. 293), indicates that divine contact surpasses the divine sponsorship indicated by food.

Carlson, Cohn, and Rofé argue that chaps. 17-19 are nevertheless related, especially on a thematic level.31 As for the unity of chap. 19, there are several distinct accounts of the chapter's component parts, more often dividing the chapter into vv. 1-3, 4-8, 9-13, 14-18, and 19-21 - although, as Long observes, there is no consensus on how these parts are divided or which might be primary or secondary.32 The problem of unity emerges in chap. 19 from the repetitions between vv. 4 and 5 and vv. 5 and 7, and especially from the repeated question in v v. 9 and 13, a doublet which some see as a resump- tive repetition ( Wiederaufnahme ) indicating multiple sources,33 while others treat it as a thematically significant repetition.34 While the history of the text remains an object of critical debate, there is a growing preference to consider the meaning of the chapter (and even chaps. 17-19) as a literary unity. My analysis shares this approach.35 The second issue is the theophany itself; and without venturing yet another creative reading of this episode, let me point out how central that element is in the text. It is framed by the repeated question-and-answer dialogue (vv. 9b- 10 and 13b- 14), introduced by scenes of crisis and flight, and followed by a set of 30 Odil Hannes Steck, Überlieferung und Zeitgeschichte in den Elia-Erzählungen (WMANT 26; Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener Verlag, 1968); Rudolf Smend, "Das Wort Jahwes an Elija: Erwägungen zur Komposition von 1 Reg xvii-xix," VT 25 (1975) 525-43.

Seybold ("Elija am Gottesberg," 7-8) shares this view, and Cohn ("Literary Logic of 1 Kings 17-19," 343) regards the repetition as a second opportunity to answer God. Robinson's view ("Elijah at Horeb, 1 Kings 19:1-18," 522) is similar. 35 See especially Carlson, Rofé, and, most recently, Vorndran ("Elijas Dialog mit Jahwes Wort und Stimme," 423-24), who proposes that the artistic and thematic value of chaps. 18-19 lies in the contrast there between the word of God received on Horeb and the fire of God on Mt. Carmel.</page><page sequence="13">PROPHETIC CONCEALMENT 49 instructions to the prophet (vv. 15-18). Quite clearly, the theophany is the center- piece of the episode:36 "Now there was a great wind, so strong that it was splitting mountains and breaking rocks in pieces before Yhwh, but Yhwh was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but Yhwh was not in the earthquake; and after the earthquake a fire, but Yhwh was not in the fire; and after the fire a sound of sheer silence" (1 Kgs 19: 1 lb-12). This appearance of God - perhaps part of an anti-Baal polemic, as Cross and Jeremias have suggested - is distinctive and impressive for what it is and what it is not.37 Presence and absence, affirmation and negation go hand in hand in the scene, forming a poetic reflection on reve- lation. As for Elijah's cloak, it covers the prophet during the theophany, but it also represents his prophetic office: it becomes a token of Elisha's commission imme- diately afterward (cf. Exodus 4) and in the miraculous ascent of Elijah in 2 Kings, where the mantle parts the waters; hence, the garment serves to conceal and to reveal. The theophany creates a dynamic of presence and absence through the "voice of sheer silence" and through the use of the cloak. Despite the theophany, Elijah concludes by repeating his complaint, whereupon Yhwh directs him to anoint new kings over Aram and Israel as well as his own successor, Elisha, who will replace him. How do the elements of the type scene operate here? The crisis facing Elijah is that he fears for his life; his journey to Sinai leads to a theophany similar to those of Exodus; Elijah is recommissioned and given the divine plan to choose a succes- sor and to anoint kings in Israel and Syria. The repeated question-and-answer sequence of vv. 9-10 and vv. 13-14 frames the astonishing theophany scene, which itself is comprised of repetitions (where Yhwh was not) and concealment. What- ever our moral interpretation of the passage may be, there can be little doubt that divine-human speech and theophany are the featured elements of this version of the type scene. The other elements of the type scene, such as the food miracle and rival prophets, all build to this breathtaking encounter. B. Literary Analysis of Exod 34:29-35 Exodus 32-34 is exceptional among other scenes of theophany in Exodus. The three chapters are generally viewed as a whole and have generated less debate on documentary sources and unity than 1 Kings 17-19.38 In Exod 3:6 Moses hides his face, "for he was afraid to look at God." And while Moses and the elders do 36 For a similar analysis, see von Nordheim, "Ein Prophet kündigt sein Amt auf," 153-73. 37 Cross, Canaanite Myth , 194. 38 Lothar Perlitt {Bundestheologie im Alten Testament [WMANT 36; Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neu- kirchener Verlag, 1969] 204-16) argues for the original unity of the chapters, as do Brevard Childs {The Book of Exodus: A Critical, Theological Commentary [OTL; Philadelphia: Westminster, 1974] 610) and R.

After that moment, only Moses continues up the mountain, where he sees the fiery appearance of God. In Exodus 32-34, by contrast, Moses speaks to God "face to face, as one speaks to a friend" (33:11, though cf. the contrary implication in 33:21).39 Unlike Exodus 3 and 24, where mountain-and-fire theophanies express divine initiative and command, Exodus 32-34 centers on a crisis of human making. The golden calf and its aftermath place Moses in the central role of punisher, mediator, and numinous (quasi-divine) figure. The idol worship ignites the anger of God and Moses, and they both impose severe punishments. As intercessor for the people, Moses contemplates his own death (32:32) and asks to see the glory of God (33:18). Finally, Moses' appearance itself changes in a way that frightens the people; he has become a quasi-divine figure to the people. Following the scenes of the golden calf and the reinscription of the tablets, the veil episode is part of the reordering of the community and the renewal of the covenant.40 In terms of the type scene, the crisis of the golden calf leads to the theophany and Moses' recommissioning (Exod 33:7-23), followed by the divine plan and its implementation (Exod 34:1-35). The veil episode falls into the last element of the type scene. But on a small scale, the episode replicates the type scene in part, like the literary phenomenon of mise-en-abyme.4i The frightening and miraculous transformation of Moses' face and its subsequent concealment by a veil constitute a kind of theophany. Just as the face of God is usually off-limits to Moses (with the exceptions of Exod 33:11 and Deut 34:10), so the face of Moses is sometimes off-limits to the people. Like the Mesopotamian stories of heavenly ascent, the episode presents a person transformed by contact with the divine. A number of texts (e.g., Num 6:25; Eccl 8:1; Pss 31:17; 67:2) describe divine favor idiomatically as causing the face to shine ("P3Ö TNil).42 While these parallels may not bear directly on Moses' transformed face, they offer suggestive evidence that theophany and divine enlightenment can appear on the human face. The entire episode concerns revelation and covenant between God and people through the mediation of Moses; the episode of the veil compresses these issues into a stunning narrative of speech, concealment, and revelation. By dwelling more on how revelation takes place than on what is revealed, the episode calls as well, though he argues that the veil episode later serves to introduce the Priestly material beginning in chap. 35. 39 The phrase is repeated in Deut 34:10. 40 Thomas Dozeman, God on the Mountain: A Study of Redaction, Theology, and Canon in Exodus 19-24 (SBLMS 37; Atlanta: Scholars, 1989) 172. 41 See Lucien Dällenbach, The Mirror in the Text (trans.

The episode is thus predominantly about revelation in speech and writing. The veil serves to set apart prophetic speech, and the veil suggests (1) the routinization of theophany and (2) a dynamic of revealing and concealing. The famous problem of Moses' shining or disfigured face has overshadowed the equally vexing issue of the veil or mask.43 Hugo Gressmann and others have traced the veil back to cultic mask traditions, though others have noted how the text's present form rules out such a reading.44 In all the discussion of these obscure references, though, there has been little analysis of the text's literary structure and even less attention to the veil. An exception is Thomas Dozeman's recent proposal that Moses wears two masks: the shining light, which he terms a "mask of concretion," and the veil, which is a "mask of concealment." Doze- man places the veil episode (Exod 34:29-35) at the pivot between a pre-Priestly tradition and the Priestly redaction that follows immediately with its specifica- tions for the construction of the tabernacle (Exodus 35-40). Dozeman concludes that the veil episode constitutes a kind of masquerade, that is, an ambiguous text that reflects several layers of interpretive tradition.45 My analysis complements Dozeman's by examining the literary surface of the text. The purpose of the veil is not obvious. Unlike in other scenes of a theophany, there is no respectful or protective barrier between Moses and Yhwh (cf. Exod 19:18-25; 24:15-18). Nor does the veil divide the speaking prophet from people. The text clearly states that Moses removes the veil when he speaks with Yhwh or the people. Unlike Parson Hooper in Nathaniel Hawthorne's "The Minister's Black Veil," Moses wears the veil when he is not performing his duties. The biblical narrator implies that the veil is designed to counteract the Israelites' fear of Moses' transformed face; but since the veil is removed when Moses addresses them, the fear would be allayed only some of the time. The narrator makes it clear that the veil is worn when Moses is "in his capaci- ty as a private individual," as Nahum Sarna puts it,46 or off-duty, so to speak. It divides times when Moses performs as a prophet from other times. The veil is thus a temporal rather than a spatial barrier, separating sacred from profane. If the veil allays the people's fear, it does so by dividing and ordering time, not by hiding a frightful visage. When he wears the veil, there is no prophecy, no divine revela- tion (cf. Ezekiel 3-4 and Elijah). The covered prophet is a silent prophet. 43 For a thorough review of the literature, see William H. Propp, "The Skin of Moses' Face - Transfigured or Disfigured?" CBQ 49 (1987) 375-86, here 375 n. 1. 44 Gressmann, Mose und seine Zeit, 246-47. For evidence that the horns of 1 Kgs 22: 1 1 are part of a habitual prophetic costume, see Paul E.

Theophany, speech and writing, and return (34:27-28) 2. Shining face (IW pp) linked to speech- (in« TQ-Q) (v. 29) 3. Shining face (TIX7 pp) seen (v. 30) 4. Speech (vv. 31-32) 5. Veil (iTlOD) linked to speech (vv. 33-34) 6. Shining face (T1X7 pp) seen (v. 35, echoing v. 30) 7. Veil (mOO) linked to speech (v. 35, echoing vv. 33-34) The turning point in the episode comes when Moses puts on the veil in v. 33. Like the theophany in 1 Kings 19, the veil lies at the center of the episode, framed before and after by speech. The shining face and the veil are arguably secondary, however, to the ongoing speech between Moses, God, and people; the veil serves mainly to allow Moses to continue the communication that was interrupted by the people's fear of his transfigured face. The veil and the shining face are, however, interwoven with speech, a juxtaposition that suggests they are intrinsic to the process of revelation. C. Other Instances of the Type Scene The status of the prophet mirrors the status of the covenant. Concealment reflects the majesty of a theophany and the tension between revelation and con- cealment in ancient Israelite religion. Other instances of the type scene illustrate its range of meanings and contexts. The commission and reforms of Gideon in Judges 6 instantiate the type scene; and even though he is not a professional prophet, he is the focus of divine-human communication in a covenantal context. Before Gideon is chosen to deliver Israel from Midianite oppression, a prophet reminds the people that God brought them out of slavery and defeated the Egyptians, and he ascribes the crisis to Israel's failure to follow the covenant. When the angel first approaches Gideon, he gives a different interpretation of the Midianite crisis, also in covenant terms: "Did not Yhwh bring us up from Egypt? But now Yhwh has cast us off, and given us into the hand of Midian" (6:13). And before Gideon begins the military campaign, he assumes prophet-like roles and responsibilities: he prepares a sacrifice, builds an altar, destroys a shrine of Baal, and obtains signs from God (the wet and dry fleece) that he will indeed deliver Israel from Midianite oppression. The work of Gideon in the wake of the prophet's message blurs the boundary between warrior and prophet. The main elements of covenant - crisis, theophany, commission, and divine plan - are clear in Judges 6. Once the political situation is explained as a covenant crisis, Gideon receives his commission from the angel. The scene echoes other prophetic commissions: in the standard denial of personal ability, Gideon protests</page><page sequence="17">PROPHETIC CONCEALMENT 53 that he and his clan are too weak to deliver Israel, and God answers that he will be with him. Echoing Exod 33: 1 1, Gideon laments that he has seen Yhwh's angel "face to face." A dramatic theophany occurs when fire consumes Gideon's offerings of meat, cakes, and broth. Though Gideon is never concealed, he realizes what has happened only when the angel vanishes: "And the angel of Yhwh vanished from his sight. Then Gideon perceived that it was the angel of Yhwh" (6:21-22). Disappearance highlights a theophany; concealment gives rise to revelation. Gideon then receives instructions, a divine plan, directly from God regarding sacrifice and the destruction of the altar of Baal. Gideon's role, like that of others in the type scene, puts his life at risk, and he conceals himself by the darkness of night. Some cases invert the elements for new purposes, such as the scene in 1 Samu- el 28 where Saul summons Samuel through the woman of Endor. In this case, the crisis concerns not a prophet and the covenant but the personal misfortune of a failing king. Still, all the elements of the type scene are here: Saul seeks counsel from Samuel during a military crisis with the Philistines; in a kind of theophany (or at least hierophany), Samuel appears to Saul with the magical assistance of a witch; and Samuel is wrapped in his characteristic mantle (1 Sam 15:27).47 Saul, too, is concealed, or at least disguised, at the time, a fact that leads to the witch's fear that Saul will catch them in this illegal act of necromancy. The story does not reassure or recommission a prophet, but on a more general level it fits the pattern of the type scene by reaffirming the covenant. Because Saul has disobeyed God, he and the Israelites will suffer defeat and death. The woman of Endor provides the only reassurance to Saul by encouraging him to eat (recall the other inappropriate fast in Saul's career, 1 Samuel 14). The elements of fasting and dialogue, so prominent in the Moses and Elijah narratives, occur here as well. Like Moses and Elijah, Saul embarks on his theophanic experience without food; and, like Elijah, he is given food as a source of comfort and reassurance (1 Sam 28:20-25). For one who faces certain and immediate death, this is small comfort, to be sure; but the feast is enough to calm Saul and move him into the fourth phase of the type scene, the plan of action. As unlikely as it seems, then, the humiliation of Saul at Endor follows the formula of the type scene quite closely.48 The crisis, dialogue, "theophany," and plan of action are all present. The prophet Samuel appears wrapped in a mantle (b^SJQ), much as Elijah does with his mantle (ITHN). The main difference is that 47 Although it does not compare the episode to others, the closest literary analysis of 1 Samuel 28 appears in Jan Fokkelman, Narrative Art and Poetry in the Books of Samuel: A Full Interpretation Based on Stylistic and Structural Analyses (4 vols.; SSN 20, 23, 27, 31; Assen, NL: Van Gorcum, 1981-93) 2. 596-622. For other references to the mantle, see 1 Sam 2:19; 15:27; 18:4; and 24:5. 48 The range of meanings among different instances of a type scene illustrates the literary potential of variations on themes. While Jeremiah and Jonah both resist and complain about their prophetic duties, the effects are quite different: the former evokes the disaster of divine punishment and exile, and the latter is rich with satire. The story of Adam and Eve includes many of the same</page><page sequence="18">54 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 64, 2002 Saul is not a prophet, but that may be precisely the point: for the king who once upstaged Samuel (1 Samuel 13), the question "Is Saul also among the prophets?" (1 Sam 10:12) is answered here with a resounding "No." In the cases of both Saul and Elijah, concealment coincides with an inter- ruption, a breakdown in their work: Elijah is afraid and even suicidal, and Saul has difficulty contacting his prophet; and when he finally does, the message is primarily that God's favor has left him and that God has nothing further to say. If we can say that Saul's end is tragic,49 then perhaps we can say that Elijah, who fails to live up to the example of Moses or even to fulfill the commission he was given in 1 Kings 19, is tragic to some degree as well. The covering of Moses' face by a veil is different: it comes after a theophany and some kind of transfiguration, at times when he speaks neither to God nor to the people. A fourth text, an oracle against false prophets in Mie 3:4-8, echoes the episode of Saul's consultation: Then shall they cry unto Yhwh, but he will not hear them; he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings. Thus says Yhwh concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth and cry Peace: and he that does not put into their mouths, they even prepare war against him. Therefore, night shall be unto you, that you shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that you shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them. Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips, for there is no answer of God. But truly I am full of power by the spirit of Yhwh, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin. In a curse similar to the one in Job 3, Micah inveighs against false prophets and the leaders who heed them. Although it is not a narrative, the passage reasserts the prophet's power during a crisis of the covenant and over against false prophets. In this case, it is the false prophets who are silenced: the mouths are wrapped (iTDS7) just as Samuel is wrapped (also PIÜX7) at Endor. Other details link the Micah passage to 1 Samuel 28: rare terms for witchcraft (DOp, Mie 3:11; 1 Sam 28:8), as well as the return of strength (TO) to the main character (1 Sam 28:22; Mie 3:8). Two other cases of the type scene contain ironic or humorous elements: the stories of the reluctant prophets Jonah and Balaam. Whereas the irony of Saul's elements as the story of Balaam, but the humor of the latter is broader and more often recognized than that of the former. See George Savran, "Beastly Speech: Intertextuality, Balaam's Ass and the Garden of Eden," JSOT 64 (1994) 33-55. See W. Lee Humphreys, The Tragic Vision and the Hebrew Tradition (OTB 18; Philadelphia: Fortress, 1985); and J. Cheryl Exum, Tragedy and Biblical Narrative : Arrows of the Almighty (Cam- bridge/New York: Cambridge University Press, 1992).</page><page sequence="19">PROPHETIC CONCEALMENT 55 story lies in the fact that he is not a prophet but a doomed king, Jonah and Balaam draw irony from foreign parties.50 The story of Balaam turns on the premise that a foreign prophet commanded to curse Israel nevertheless blesses them; his story (Numbers 22-24) thus reverses but preserves the type scene. Here the crisis lies with fealty to the Moabite king Balak rather than to the covenant of Yhwh. In a combination of theophany, recommission, and divine plan, Yhwh speaks to Balaam several times during the story (Num 22:12, 20; 23:4-5, 16; 24:2), and the appear- ance of the angel, which causes Balaam to bow to the ground, hiding his face (22:31), also has a clear theophanic element. The scene of the donkey and the angel (22:22-35) restrains Balaam on his journey to carry out the prophetic task commanded by Yhwh (22:20). Still more amusing is the fact that for each of his four oracles, Yhwh and Balak both commission (or recommission) Balaam to speak as they command. Minor elements of the type scene here include Balaam's mention of his own death (22:10) and the incidence of words from the root 13X7 (22:16, 26). Jonah runs away from his commission to the people of Nineveh and experi- ences a theophany in the shape of a storm as well as in the direct speech of God. The concealment of the prophet inside a great fish, and later in his booth and under the bush outside the city, underlines the unusual command of prophecy to a foreign nation as well as the prophet's reluctance to fulfill it. Jonah's near death in the sea (2:5-7) and his wish for death as he sits in the hot sun (4:3) represent elements of danger and death in the type scene, even though the danger arises from Jonah and God, not from enemies of the prophet. The episode of the bush (ļ^p^p» 4:6-10) contains familiar covenant language (4:2; see Exod 34:6-7) and may even allude to the broom tree (Drn) in 1 Kgs 19:4-8. Despite his unusual task and his intransigence, therefore, Jonah constitutes a religiously and literarily familiar example of the type scene. The type scene appears in a number of other places, most notably Ezekiel 3- 4, where the glory ("DD) of God appears to the prophet, after which the prophet is apparently silent (3:15, or DD1I27Q; cf. Ezra 9:3) and is actually re- strained by heavy cords (OTTOS? [4:8], a term that also describes cords or chains on the priestly breastpiece [Exod 28: 14; 39: 15]); his tongue is also attached to his palate to prevent him from prophesying. Walter Eichrodt summarizes the con- fusion generated by this passage as follows: "We are forced to this conclusion [that 3:16-21 is an interpolation] by the hopeless contradiction between the statement in v. 26 that Ezekiel was struck dumb at the commencement of his career, and God's command that he is not to be held back from carrying out his commission in full (2.4ff. and 3.4ťř.)."51 Instead of suggesting that Ezekiel's silence indicates 50 See Rofé's comparison between the two stories, along with the stronger parallel between Jonah and the "man of God" in 1 Kings 13 ( The Prophetical Stories, 166-81). 51 Waither Eichrodt, Ezekiel: A Commentary (OTL; Philadelphia: Westminster, 1970) 75-76;</page><page sequence="20">56 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 64, 2002 a textual addition, I propose that it fits into this type scene of prophetic commis- sion. As elsewhere in Ezekiel, notably chap. 12, in which the prophet performs a symbolic action of carrying his baggage with his face covered, the scene occurs during a crisis: the people are exiled from home and reluctant to hear the oracles of the prophet. The restraining and silencing of the prophet take place during his commission. In addition to this concealment and silencing, the scene includes a theophany, dialogue with God, the hiding of the face of God and prophet, and a divinely given plan of action. V. Concealment, Silence, and Restraint In Exodus 34, Moses apparently conceals his face to overcome the Israelites' fear of his changed appearance. The episode counts as only part of the type scene, but it condenses the issues of covenant and revelation into a brief narrative. In 1 Kings 19, however, Elijah wraps himself in his mantle out of fear and respect for God's presence. The purpose of Elijah's action is closer to that of Moses' action in covering his face on his first encounter with God (Exodus 3). Yet the Elijah scene clearly resembles Moses' experience on Sinai in many respects. If Exodus 32-34 and 1 Kings 19 are both cases of the proposed type scene, then what accounts for the divergence in the element of concealment? The difference between the two scenes may reflect the difference between Moses and Elijah. As several commentators have pointed out, Elijah does not seem to measure up to the example of Moses. In a passage on prophets, the Mekilta of Rabbi Ishmael interprets 1 Kgs 19:16 as an expression of divine displeasure with Elijah,52 who, unlike Moses, does not plead for his people but only remains silent.53 Elijah's replacement by Elisha may indicate a divine decision that Elijah should retire. Elijah readily gives Elisha the prophetic mantle that he had just wrapped around himself on Mount Horeb. Bernard Robinson, following von Nord- heim and Gregory, even goes so far as to call Elijah egotistical and hubristic.54 As a prophet who leaves his land, his people, and his mission, the Elijah of chap. 19 resembles Jonah as well as Moses.55 Jerome Walsh contrasts 1 Kings 19 and Exodus 34 as follows: whereas Moses puts his focus on the people, Elijah concen- trates on himself and speaks harshly against the people. Moses requests the theophany, whereas Elijah does not. Both scenes include a theophany and divine commandment, but Elijah expresses the wish to quit (Exod 33:15-16; 34:9).56 see also Habel' s confusing explanation in "Form and Significance of the Call Narratives," 313. 52 Mekilta De-Rabbi Ishmael , vol. 1 (trans.

Moses himself becomes a source of awe: the people see him and become afraid (34:29-30; cf. 1 Kgs 19:3, where manu- scripts differ on whether denotes seeing or fearing). Moses has transcended the level of an ordinary prophet, but the element of concealment, which is com- mon in stories of theophany, takes on a unique purpose in Exodus 34. Whether or not the mOD was originally a kind of cultic mask, the veil of Moses serves here to set him apart from the people when he is not performing the function of prophet. The veil of Moses marks him as an off-duty prophet. Still, the conceal- ment of both Moses and Elijah indicates a theophany as well as a crisis, and the pattern appears in Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Micah, Amos, and others, including the prophet Muhammad (see table 1). Because the type scene includes the elements of crisis and theophany, the meaning of prophetic concealment is always dual. The prophet is concealed because of divine displeasure, but also because he is in the presence of God. The veil of Moses and the mantle of Elijah separate sacred from profane, but they also indicate the suspension or withdrawal of the prophet and his divine message. The elements of the type scene do not march in lockstep, but they form a constellation-like pattern that adds interpretive value because of their associa- tions.57 Elijah wraps himself because it is expected in a theophany; but when he gives the same garment to Elisha in 1 Kgs 19:19, it becomes clear that Elijah has entered semi-retirement. The veil of Moses, which protects not the prophet but the people, draws meaning from its apparent variation from the standard use of con- cealment. The story of Saul at Endor likewise draws its irony and poignancy from its divergences from the formula. VI. Discussion and Conclusion Discourse and dialogue are separated from the theophany in these texts: the still small voice (HpT PTDDI bip) does not give instructions to Elijah. Silence as well as concealment is the proper response to a theophany.58 Speech and dialogue tend to follow the silence. Whatever the origins of this type scene may be, and whether the concealment of the prophet has roots in cultic masks or in heavenly garments, biblical tradition links the form directly to Israelite concerns about covenant, prophecy, and the nature of revelation. Since the type scene begins with a crisis of the covenant, its 57 See Carol Stockhausen {Moses' Veil and the Glory of the New Covenant: The Exegetical Substructure of II Cor. 3,1-4,6 [AnBib 116; Rome: Biblical Institute Press, 1989] 57), for example, who diagrams overlapping terms and elements of the "text-complex" behind Exodus 34 and 2 Corin- thians 3. 58 For an eloquent discussion of silence and revelation in 1 Kings 19, see Benjamin Sommer, "Revelation at Sinai in the Hebrew and in Jewish Theology," JR 79 (1999) 437-49.</page><page sequence="22">58 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 64, 2002 resolution depends on divine-human communication. How God appears and speaks to the prophet, and how the prophet responds, are theological rather than bio- graphical matters, even if the prophet is the focus in the text, because the focus of the text is the covenant and revelation, not the personal life or experience of the prophet. Nor is prophetic concealment simply a narrative detail to enrich the story. Instead, the prophet is concealed sometimes to indicate the danger of a theophany (as in Exodus 3), sometimes to emphasize divine displeasure (as in Ezekiel 3 and Isaiah 6), and sometimes, as in the case of Exodus 34 and 1 Kings 19, to indicate that revelation requires moments of concealment and silence. The concealed prophet reflects a basic dynamic (or paradox) of revealing and concealing, just as the religion of ancient Israel pitted an invisible god against visible ones. The concealed prophet can represent both the silent displeasure of God and a quality of God's revelation. At the same time, the accounts preserve anthropomorphic mythical elements, like the clefts of rock and the face of God, and show no effort to spiritualize these events.59 Revelation entails concealment, I suggest, not only in the sense that presence implies absence, but also as words both communicate and fail to do so, or as certain silences do not seem to communicate but do so, nevertheless. When Israel turns away from God, the prophets of God withdraw. Before they return, they must be fortified by a theophany, a dialogue with God, and a renewed sense of mission. The concealment and silence of the prophet mean two things together: the fear of God warranted by the theophany and a withdrawal from prophetic speech at a moment of crisis. In the type scene sketched here, the silence of the theophany and the silence of the prophet's withdrawal are inseparable.60 59 See Joseph Blenkinsopp's criticisms of homiletic interpretations of the episode {History of Prophecy in Israel, 72-73). 60 A version of this paper was presented to the Pentateuch Section of the SBL at the convention in Boston in 1999. 1 wish to thank the members of the Virginia Tech Interdisciplinary Reading Group for their helpful comments on this essay: Jane Aiken, David Burr, Ann-Marie Knoblauch, Amy Nelson, and Darleen Pryds.</page></plain_text>
