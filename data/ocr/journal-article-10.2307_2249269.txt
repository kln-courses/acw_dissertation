<plain_text><page sequence="1">V.-CRITICAL NOTICES. Essays in Philosophy. By JAMES WARD. With a Memoir of the Author, by OLWEN WARD CAMPBELL. University Press, Cam- bridge, 1927. Pp. vii, 372. 16s. THIS volume, edited by Profs. Sorley and Stout, contains a memoir of Ward by his younger dauighter, Mrs. Campbell, and a collection of twelve papers written by him, which are for the most part, not ' essays' in the ordinary sense, but addresses and public lectures, and which range in date of composition from 1879 to 1924. Four of the papers have not been previously published, some of the others though published are not perhaps readily accessible, and one is out of print. The collection, therefore, will be valuable to all who are interested in Ward's philosophical teaching, especially as a number of the papers expound his views upon a topic with which, in his larger works, he had no occasion to deal-the nature, method, and present trend of philosophy generally. But the book will also be valuable in a wider way, for it makes an excellent informal intro- duction to philosophy, and might well be commended as such to the beginner and the general reader. I ought perhaps to add that, with few exceptions, the papers were not meant for either class of reader, but for audiences of a more or less academic character. To describe the papers, as the editors do in the Preface, as ' popular ' is therefore, even with the qualification ' as the author would have used that word,' rather misleading: they are popular only in the sense in which all spoken addresses or lectures must endeavour to be so. I need hardly say, they are full of instruction and sugges- tion for all students of philosophy. I will first say a little about the Memoir. Ward's life falls into two sharply contrasted parts. During the last fifty years of it, his life was that of a philosophical teacher at Cambridge, in Trinity College and as a University Professor. But he came late to the University, having already taken a lengthy course of study for the ministry in a Nonconformist college, and also held a pastorate for a year in Cambridge. During the latter part of this time he had passed through a painful intellectual struggle in which his religious views had been much broadened and changed. A year spent after his college course in study in Germany, first at Berlin and then at Gottingen to hear Lotze-" the year," he says in a letter of later date, " in which I grew most "-had at least hastened the process of change, and in the end he felt his position to be untenable and,</page><page sequence="2">JAMES WARD, Essays in Philosophy. 479 in spite of urgent appeals, resigned his charge. Having once made the break and turned away to seek a new career, " he buried his past "-so completely indeed, that " to the larger number of those who became his friends in later life " his earlier experiences "remained utterly unknown ". But Mrs. Campbell takes the significance of her father's life to lie very largely in its having been a spiritual adventure, " a voyage of discovery, where the traveller sets out with no other guide than the pointing compass of his own soul, for an unknown land, and after many conflicts, obstacles, and inevitable losses, arrives at his goal ". She is there- fore led to dwell upon the first part of his life and " the formative experiences of his life and character," and this involves a certain amount of detail as to family history and the personal experiences -and hardships of Ward's early life. This somewhat difficult part of the memoir is very well done. We get a vivid sketch of the environment in which Ward's early life was spent, and of the difficulties, aggravated by frequent ill-health, with which he had to struggle. The account of the mental conflict through which he passed in his transition period throws, of course, much light on the direction and aims of his subsequent philosophical thinking. To take a single instance, we can see from his later writings that he had a strong interest in, and wide knowledge of, natural science, but we learn from the memoir that he had even considered seriously whether he should not make science his life-work. It seems too, that he would have been fully justified in doing so, for Michael Foster was so impressed by his promise in scientific w6rk as to say of the philosopher that he was " a physiologist spoiled ". Ward's whole endeavour in later life to show that natural science is not in- compatible with a spiritual philosophy may be regarded as having its source and impulse in the earlier conflict between his scientific leanings and his religioius convictions. Throughout the memoir, and more particularly in the difficult first part of it, one feels that Mrs. Campbell has sought to present a true and faithful picture of the incidents of her father's life and the traits of his character and temperament; and the reader will often be impressed, I think, by, her sympathetic understanding of her father's attitude to the problems of his life. In a letter in which Ward is reflecting on the experiences of his critical transition period he says " I simply feel that here as elsewhere there is good in evil, though not so much as to make me cease to wish that the evil had not been. Perhaps though when the end of all comes it may prove true that evil has been the parent of a larger good . . . only so far I am not conscious that such evil as I have known and done has proved this for me." "It was in this spirit," Mrs. Campbell says, "with its typical mixture of pessimism, resolution, and hope, that Ward turned to his new life . . . being sustained only, as he said, by' faith in light to come'." This brief comment seems to characterise very aptly the habitual attitude of mind -in which Ward confronted life's pro- blems, not only in their personal, but also in their philosophical aspect.</page><page sequence="3">480 CRITICAL NOTICES: In the account of the latter half of Ward's life one would have expected his writings and his academic work to be dealt with pretty fully. That this expectation is somewhat disappointed is not, of course, Mrs. Campbell's fault: she explains that she "can only speak with the greatest diffidence of any matter connected with his work," and acknowledges assistance from Prof. Sorley in the passages that describe her father's works and philosophical ideas. But it is not merely the writings that are in question; they can speak for themselves. We are told that from 1882 onwards Ward " took an active part in College and University politics," but we hear practically nothing about this side of his activity. Again the references to his work as a teacher are very meagre, nor is there any description, such as the recollection of his intimate friends in Cambridge might have supplied, of his informal philosophical talk or of his views on subjects outside philosophy. It seems a pity that the editors have not seen their way to supplement the more personal memoir in these directions. The memoir is accompanied by two portraits, reproduced from photographs, one showing the full face, the other the side face. The former is given as the frontispiece of the volume. It is a very striking portrait, but the photograph 'would appear to have been taken at a time when Ward was feeling ill and depressed, and I cannot think the selection of it as the chief portrait in the volume a happy one. We are told that Ward's "thoughts and not his conflicts were expressed in old age upon his face, the harmony and beauty of which increased with years," but the portrait would suggest the very reverse of all this, for it has a look of oppression, melancholy and even suffering. The other portrait, though not so striking in itself, is more likely to produce the right general impression. Of the twelve papers in the volume nine at least may be grouped about three main topics: (1) the nature, method, and present tendencies of philosophy; (2) the contrast and relation between ' the realm of nature ' and 'the realm of ends'; (3) faith- or the religious factor in action and thought. Five papers and part of a sixth are concerned with the first of these topics; the Adamson lecture on "Mechanism and Morals " and part of another paper with the second; and the first and the last paper with the third. The re- maining three papers are the Sidgwick lecture on " Heredity and Memory," the Academy lecture on "Kant" and an unpublished paper on " Einstein and Epistemology ". Practically half the volume, then, consists of papers that deal with philosophy and philosophical method either generally or with special reference to present-day conditions; and two of these papers have not been previously published. A paper on " The Progress of Philosophy " (published in MIND, 1890) seeks to show that " philo- sophy, as regards its history and development, does not differ in genere from the body of the sciences" and that "allowing for differences of subject-matter, it has advanced about as much ". An</page><page sequence="4">JAMES WARD, Essays in Philosophy. 481 -unpublished paper on " The Difficulties of Philosophy " begins with a suggestive comparison between the difficulty of determining physical magnitudes, when great exactness is required, and the difficulty of analysing and defining philosophical concepts. In the former case all sorts of precautions have to be taken, and any one factor is found to be implicated indefinitely with others. Similarly when we start to analyse a concept like change, we find ourselves entangled at once in discussions about time and substance and cause, and are led on indefinitely from one difficulty to another. Hence the futility in philosophy of such Cartesian rules of method as those which tell us to divide our difficulties and proceed step by step. With this insistence on the mutual implication of philo- sophical problems we may connect another contention of Ward's both in this paper and in his Presidential Address to the Aristotelian Society (1919, reprinted here), viz., that in philosophy the maxim to begin, at the beginning' is useless and worse than useless. For the plain fact is here we are in the middle; and, however we may deceive ourselves, we can begin only where we are, and can at best but try to get to the beginning." Hence in pbilosophy a synthetic or deductive method is not possible. " The problem that the universe sets us is an inverse problem." Hence again Ward's objection to philosophies of the Absolute that claim to speak from an insight into the nature of that transcendent unity, and on the strength of such supposed insight call in question the very realities of our finite experience from which we must after all start. " There is for us no absolute standpoint." The necessity of being clear about our standpoint and its implications and consequent limitations is another guiding principle of philosophical method for, Ward. 'The problem of 'orientation,' as he liked to call it, is referred to both in connection with the difficulties of philosophy and in a paper 'called " Philosophical Orientation and Scientific Standpoints ". Our philosophy, however -far it attempts to reach in speculation, must still be worked out from the point of view of our own human ex- perience and human life. Our ultimate interpretations of the world must still be anthropomorphic. But before philosophy can attempt its ultimate task of interpretation, it has the prior task of trying to bring the standpoints of the different sciences into relation with each other. For philosophy is no mere ' fusion' of the sciences; and when differences of standpoint are ignored or slurred over, only confusion and error can result. Statements valid enough under the limitations of one standpoint are taken to be true without qualifica- tion. The physical sciences, e.g., may seem to involve a virtual ,denial of the reality of life and mind. Here, of course, we are brought to the second main topic of the volume. We approach it ag,ain from another side in the unpublished paper on " The Present 'Trend of Philosophical Speculation " (written in 1903). Here the main tendencies of present-day philosophy are said to be the follow- ing: a tendency on the whole towards an idealistic or spiritual philosophy, with an emphasis on the volitional or practical aspect</page><page sequence="5">482 CRITICAL NOTICES: of experience; a recognition of the importance of history with its categories of worth or value; a reaction against Absolutism and towards pluralism; a faith in progress that avoids the extremes both of optimism and pessimism. Obviously Ward must have regarded his own philosophy as being in harmony with the main tendencies of present-day philosophical thought. The main aim of his philosophy was to show how 'the realm of nature' can be interpreted from the point of view of ' the realm of ends'. This philosophy is outlined for us in the present volume in the Adamson Lecture and in the paper on " Philosophical Orientation ". As it is the theme of the two sets of Gifford Lectures and familiar to all students of philosophy, there is no need to say anything about it here. I will merely remark that the Adamnson Lecture is probably the best short and comprehensive statement we have of Ward's philosophical doctrine about nature and its relation to mind. As regards Ward's view of faith the two main points are these. First, faith itself is conceived as a more or less blind venture. And taken in this sense it is not even peculiar to man. Of the world of living beings in general we can say that at every stage " action is in advance of experience ". With a sort of " instinctive trustfulness " the living being experiments with the possibilities open to it. At the human level, man's faith may set before him ideal conceptions, but they are conceptions not known to be true yet cherished and acted upon. Second, by thus venturing in advance of experience, an ascent to higher levels may be achieved, and the faith will then be justified. And at the human level, Ward seems to have thought that, by trusting their religious impulses, men may some day develop a higher kind of insight, some sort of mystical God-con- sciousness which will transcend the ordinary forms of our present experience. This is not a mere casual or fanciful suggestion, it is referred to even in the Psychological Principles, but I must simply pass it over. Ward likes to illustrate the venture of faith by the text which says that Abraham " went out, not knowing whither he went ". On one occasion this part of the text is quoted by itself. But obviously this part of the text taken by itself leaves out the very thing in which Abraham's faith consisted. A mere adventurer might go out " not knowing whither he went ". But Abraham went out in obedience to a call, and the object of his faith was the divine call. Religious faith as conceived by the theologian is in truth a totally different thing from the faith of which Ward speaks: it is not any mere " spirit of hopeful adventure " but an intense convic- tion of the reality of its object. But the fact is, that of faith in the theologian's sense Ward had not any left. In' a letter from Ger- many in his critical year he speaks of himself as " admitting the ethical worth of Christianity but uncertain as to anything else in it "; and in a letter of 1873 he says, " The doubting phase is pretty well passed for me now. I reject the whole system of Christian dogma from beginning to end and rationalise the history." Such</page><page sequence="6">BERNARD BOSANQUET, Science and Philosophy. 483 attenuated religious ideas as he retained seem to have become for him speculative hypotheses of greater or less probability rather than assured convictions. In Ward's philosophy we might indeed see a sort of philosophical analogue of religious faith in the intense con- viction with which he asserted the reality and spontaneous activity of the self or human spirit. The human self and its activity were facts to be accepted as such, for Ward did not profess to have aany metaphysical insight into their nature. But their reality and cen- trality in experience were also truths to be maintained against all attempts, whether from the naturalistic or the absolutist side, to deny or minimise them. And they were the foundation of Ward's whole philosophy. They furnish the clues for the interpretation of all our objective experiences, they make pluralism a necessary starting-point of philosophy and an inevitable aspect of experience, they suggest the pampsychism which would da away with the dualism of matter and mind, and finally they point towards the theism which is the speculative completion of philosophy.
