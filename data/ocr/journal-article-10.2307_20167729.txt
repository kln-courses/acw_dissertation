<plain_text><page sequence="1">A private rebel Brice Marden FRANCESCO CLEMENTE "We are in danger of forgetting the language which all things and events speak without metaphor, which alone is copious and standard." A hundred and fifty years ago, a prophet of America set on a walk through New England, hoping to gain the physical endurance and contentment which would have made him "a cousin to the pine and the rock." Henry David Thoreau wished "to make an extreme statement, for there are enough champions of civilization." Brice Marden is an artist who shares this wish, which betrays a prophetic, libertarian longing for solitude: The qualified solitude of a private rebel, an American. To the question Thoreau raised, on which language alone is spoken without metaphor and is copious and standard, Marden answers: the language of nature. If nature is everything not formed by human intention, then Marden aspires to the language spoken in that fearful and paradoxical place where the relentless greed of human intention climaxes by erasing itself. Only by erasing itself can human intention confer to certain objects their singular monumentality. The overturned columns of a Doric temple, the miniature torso of a Cycladic figurine, a Chinese philosopher stone, a Marden drawing: The monumental, here, is not to be found in a finite measure but in an infinite distance. An unmeasurable distance, filled with silence and dismay, and littered with human artifacts, separates nature from the consolations of self-knowledge. On this distance are trained the eyes of the sculptures of Praxiteles, dear to Marden, and his paintings have the opaque luminosity of their gaze. Form arises from the eclipse of human intention. In his search of the language of nature, in his search of form, Marden accepts the world as a Presocratic cosmogony, where "things are not separated from one another nor cut off with an axe," where "things come out of one another," and where "there are seeds of all things, with all sort of shape and color." Thus, the paintings of Brice Marden expose space as the untainted medium, where the transformation of things is taking place, beyond the reach of humanist sentimentality. Abstraction means, for Marden, to abandon the comforts of anthropomorphic space and expose space as pure medium. The paintings of Brice Marden become thus the cousins of the pine and the rock, fulfilling Thoreau's longing for a language of nature. They can do so because they are images of things seen in statu nascendi.The paintings of Brice Marden are images of states of change. * "What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence." If we were to obey Wittgenstein's injunction, we would not speak about Brice Marden's work: A work that is nothing less than the image of a metaphysical construct. M?rden's restraint, like Wittgenstein's injunction, illuminates the active valence of silence. For Brice Marden, as for Wittgenstein, to be silent about metaphysics opens the door to a correct embrace of techniques. Does, in turn, a correct technique open a vista on the metaphysical world? Yes, but neither Wittgenstein nor Marden would allow himself to say it. It could be argued that the fundamental questions about human experience, formulated by the Presocratic philosophers in Greece and Taoists in China, are still standing today in the stark clarity of their elegant despair. The solitude fostered by mass democracy leaves us at ease to ask questions originated three thousand years ago by the hermits who wandered in the mist of Cold Mountain, or among the olive groves of Mt. Parnassus, or, more recently, the oaks and ailanthuses on the banks of Waiden Pond. These ancient questions about human experience did not lead to metaphysical answers, but to techniques, prescriptions for action. Brice Marden's painting techniques are grounded in a rigorous use of reason as a bridge to unreason. This is why he is equally comfortable in the company of the ancient Greek who says: "I know that I don't know" and of the ancient Chinese who says: "I don't know that I know."

Courtesy of the artist. true reason is inclusive?it is discursive awareness of the grotesque and the sublime realms, which reason cannot reach. Realms ruled by intelligences cool and unsympathetic that are the true agents of harsh human actions and cataclysmic world changes. Since the dawn of time, the achievement of the artists who are dearest to Marden has been to open the door onto this vain world of powers and principalities, to expose and diminish its obscure force. Zurbar?n did so in his feverish misuse of Christian iconography, generating pure form through the sheer weight of his grays and his white. Pollock did so, retreating in a fearless world of chance and monumental physical ity. And so did a supremely secular artist like C?zanne, his insect eye trained on the remains left over by the death of God and Man. "I am nature," said Pollock, making manifest the extreme statement, hinted at by Thoreau, in his quest for transcendence. The hollow ring of Pollock's boast reveals the tragic chasm opened by modern reason when it added a predicate to the bare "I am" claimed by the mystics of the ancient worlds. Zurbar?n, C?zanne, but also Lao-Tze and Herodotus: Brice Marden traces his lineage timidly, painfully, as he is only too aware of belonging to a "late" age, a sentimental age, whose lone and macabre distinction is to come "after." "And olive trees blown white in the wind": Pound's line illuminates the mutability of color. Color is ever changing, as it bathes in light and time, and human emotion. Brice Marden shares with the Presocratic philosopher, with theTaoist sage, a vivid longing for the essence of things. To Marden color is essence. Color is</page><page sequence="4">250 RES 51 SPRING 2007 Figure 3. Brice Marden, Study for Epitaph Painting #4, 1998. Kremer ink and collage on Lanaquarelle paper, 41V4 x 571/2 in. Courtesy of the artist. the impassive mirror, reflecting the fading in time of light and emotion. It reveals the material constancy of nature, illuminating the immaterial variables of experience. The Aegean sea is bluer than any other sea. Marden has often boarded the flight that from the west enters the blue sky, blue land, blue water of the Aegean. The density of its light erases the traveler's memories and expectations. He is left alone to face a vast opaque mirror, a reservoir of color, impervious to the accidents of history and topography. To Marden, the sea is the model of an ideal plane: A plane that is like the earth of old, which stood flat and reassuring in the center of the moving stars, reflecting their tremulous course in the vicissitudes of its inhabitants. The sea is the model of the surface of Brice Marden's paintings, a surface that is both reflective and absorbent, soft and hard, yin, "the overcast," and yang, "something shone upon." For Marden, to paint Pound's olive tree "blown white in the wind" means to paint knowledge in action. "Primitive" humans are familiar with this type of knowledge, which cannot be described but only acted out. Marden's paintings are documents of knowledge in action. They are not a description of the olive tree but a vector of its essence. Color as essence in action will be in turns, deep, soft, evasive. Above all, it will always be weighty, because its weight will turn it into a thing, and not a description. Color, the essence, absorbs the rectangle, the plane, the picture, the structure, and reduces all of these incidents to one, necessary thing, the painting. A Marden painting is never a simulacrum, is never the empty shell of the real thing. It is a palladium, the living duplicate of the real thing, built to capture its soul in an effort to protect its integrity. The search for the essence of things implies a desire to protect them.

Courtesy of the artist. impassive, cool, limited operations of the magus, the artist, imply an infinite affection. Time is the subject matter of the paintings of Brice Marden. Change is the visual cipher of his language. Concealment is his technique. Time, change, concealment are the three legs of the tripod, which Marden built. In the fire of this tripod, the ordinary man, artist or viewer as he may be, experiences a transmutation. He becomes a mischievous ghost, serene, as he is at rest, in the warmly organic cocoon of an eternal now. The hexagrams of the / Ching, the book of changes, aim at synchronizing psychological and cosmic time. Marden's paintings are comparable to exagrams, both in structure and intention. The exagrams illuminate the garbled and shifting filaments of the past, to discern among them only those strings that can be woven into a new web: the web of a vital and plentiful future. Past and future: Marden, suspended between these two interminable vistas, is bound to take his time in observation, as the slightest move will tip the balance and precipitate him from the enigma of the past in to the vertigo of the future. The texture of the hexagrams is like a fine lace of precarious balances. The numbers one, two, and three flow into each other. They overlap only to separate again. Lines either are interrupted or run intact. Monads are split in couples and reunited. Couples collapse in the embrace of triads. The one limps in the two. Two tips over in three. The concise structure overflows with meaning, and we are reminded of harmonic scales, of notes heard and not played.</page><page sequence="6">252 RES 51 SPRING 2007 The paintings of Brice Marden, too, resonate of more colors than we are shown. Each painting is parted in one, two, or three planes. Each plane plays his physical and emotional weight against the other, generating visual and emotional overtones, a proliferation of meaning, provoked and not described. One, two, three, many: Each panel of a Marden image is painted over many a time. And each time, the new, uniform mantel of paint erases the earlier one. But, unlike the abstractions of the New York School, the Marden's paintings are never unfinished. The final, visible layer of color that is chosen expresses always a ruthless determination, a merciless clarity, foreign to our age: The fearsome clarity of the will. Conversely, in secret, underneath the conquered surface of each plane, are buried innumerable layers of paint. These are sediments of discarded emotional states. Set below Brice Marden's horizon, they sink toward the ever receding origin of their representation. Showing and concealing: the later Marden paintings obey the same laws of universal growth as the early ones. One, two, three, many: We witness again the efficiency and serenity of this simple progression. One: to draw a line. Two: to ostensibly erase it. Three: to draw a new line, its weight and place determined by the old one, and by the portions of it that were erased. Many: a proliferation of cascading spaces. Never spiraling nor radiating. Rather, a centripetal movement, like the filling of a cup; a fluid movement bouncing again, from the center, toward the edge. Borrowing the words of Henri Michaux about the Chinese, Brice Marden is "subject to the charm of resemblance, at first, and then to a distant one, and finally to the composition of resembling elements." But resemblance is an obstacle as well, it has to be overcome, all similitude has to be abandoned forever. To Marden, "like nature, language does not draw any conclusions of its own, but lets itself be read." The language of nature: if in the early paintings of Brice Marden nature spoke a language of measures, in the later ones she speaks a language of miracles. Suspended between order and miracle, we regard these paintings as if we saw a waterfall reversing its course, or a tree twisting its roots in the sky, or a rainbow abandoning its arched shape, to pour its colors in our veins. In the later Marden paintings, a web of affirmations and denials defines beauty as an accident of growth, marred by conflict and pain. The suffering is implicit in the language of nature, when instead of simply saying with the mystic, "I am," she says, "I am again." Even if Marden is too elegant and worldly a man to ever admit it, his works document his surrender to these two most discredited notions, so closely bound: conflict and beauty. Thus, having earned the right to borrow the words of the Taoist sage, Brice Marden can say of his paintings: "Beside my undivided attention to them I did not venture to use any arts. I have heard the saying 'after all the carving and chiseling, let the object be to return to simplicity.' I was a child who has no knowledge; I was extraordinarily slow and hesitating; they grew like springing plants themselves." Kirk, G. S., Raven, J. E., and Schofield, M. The Presocratic Philosophers.
