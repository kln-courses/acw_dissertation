<plain_text><page sequence="1">Punishment,Punishment, Human and Divine, by the Rev. W. C. de Pauley, B.D., Senior Moderator, Trinity College, Dublin, Professor of Systematic Theology, St John's College, Winnipeg. (S.P.C.K., !925.) The first part of this book is taken up with a painstaking study of the theories with regard to punishment held by Plato, Plotinus, St Augus tine, St Thomas Aquinas, and Grotius; together ' with the necessary theological background in each case' (p. v). All this is 'by way of illustration' of the central theme of the book: ' that punishment is</page><page sequence="2">314 THE journal of theological studies a complex conception cortiposed of three elements—namely, retributive, reformative, and deterrent'. The series of illustrations thus provided, however, leaves upon the reader an impression of disjointedness, and he is so long detained ■in 'theological background' that he is in danger of losing sight of the main subject which he has been invited to study. At length, in chapter vi, Mr de Pauley comes definitely to an exposi tion of the view of punishment which has been in his mind throughout. But here his argument would probably have been much clearer if he had kept the order of his title and considered first human punishment and then divine punishment. The whole idea of punishment belongs primarily to human society, and the application of the idea to the rela tion between God and man involves an anthropomorphism which may easily be carried too far. Moreover, Mr de Pauley's exposition is still too much taken up with 'theological background', and is somewhat over-burdened with quotation. The result makes rather heavy reading. Nevertheless Mr de Pauley's book is useful for reference, and the perse vering student will find in it some interesting things. One example must suffice : 1 The State deters and reforms by painful means, simply because no other means is possible to it; the retributive element is to be found in its right to punish, and never may this element be allowed to determine the degree of the penalty, else it is wrested from its sister element, and becomes revenge' (p. 207).
