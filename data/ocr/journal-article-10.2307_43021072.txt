<plain_text><page sequence="1">DAVID COPLAND MORRIS University of Washington-Tacoma Celebration and Irony: The Polyphonic Voice of Edward Abbey's Desert Solitaire Edward Abbey resisted being called a nature writer, but it is under that label that his classic Desert Solitaire is shelved in the bookstores. He says, "Much as I admire the work of Thoreau, Muir, Leopold, Beston, Krutch, Eiseley and others, I have not tried to write in their tradition. I don't know how. I've done plenty of plain living, out of necessity, but don't know how to maintain a constant level of high thinking" (Journey Home vii). One suspects that Abbey's fiercely independent soul feared being grouped with writers whose names carried connotations of ear- nestness, reverence, and perhaps even piety: "Our nature writers are such a sober, solemn, misty-eyed lot. Rhapsody, except in minute doses, is always hard to swallow" (Introduction xi). His protestations notwithstanding, I believe that in Desert Solitaire Abbey is indeed a nature writer; in the final analysis he is earnest, even pious (in the non-self-righteous sense of the word) toward the over- whelming, soul-filling source of value he finds in non-human nature. And he shares the nature writers' precious and triumphant resistance to the nihilism which pervades so much of modern life and literature. Thoreau asserts, "we are enabled to apprehend at all what is sublime and noble only by perpetually instilling and drenching of the reality which surrounds us" (399) . And elsewhere he claims, "Be it life or death, we crave only reality" (400). Abbey echoes him: "I am here not only to evade for a while the clamor and filth and confusion of the cultural apparatus but also to confront, immediately and directly if it's possible, the bare bones of existence, the elemental and fundamental, the bed- rock that sustains us" (6). Beside sharing this outward-looking focus on the natural world, Abbey constructs, like most nature writers, a powerful critique of the anthropocentrism, or overweening human pride, which seems to be at the heart of the environmental crisis.</page><page sequence="2">22 Western American Literature I would argue though, that while he is a genuine nature writer, he is perhaps unique among that species in subjecting the narrative voice which celebrates nature to a fortifying bath of irony. Abbey gains author- ity for his underlying celebratory vision of the western landscape by skillfully interweaving in Desert Solitaire the voice of the irreverent ironist with that of the celebrant. This ironical strain challenges the reverential vision by anticipating and expressing the secular doubt inherent in the postmodern cultural context in which Abbey and his readers find them- selves. In exerting this pressure on reverence, the skeptical and ironic voice toughens and tempers the profession of celebratory faith in Desert Solitaire . Whether one looks back toward writers like Muir and Jeffers, or across to Lopez and Eiseley, or Dillard, one finds a reverential feeling for wild nature. But none of these writers satirizes or undercuts his or her own worshipful voice. To be sure, there is satire and wit in all of them, but none of them calls into question his or her own reverential tone. All of them approach their subjects with a nearly undiluted moral earnestness and a corresponding unity of tone. While all of them are extremely compelling writers, none has access to the comic energy that gives Desert Solitaire's environmentalism its special force. It might be helpful to place Abbey specifically (albeit impressionistically) within the context of these major literary stylists who share essential features of his environmentalist vision. Muir' s almost superhuman exuberance in the presence of wild nature never seems to flag, and he can be exhausting for the reader who finds him at times too insistent and unaware that other humans might be constructed of slightly different stuff than he. One thinks of Muir's friend Jerome Fay, marooned with Muir one miserable and lonely night in an awesome snowstorm on Mt. Shasta. The experience was nearly fatal for both of them. Muir had overesti- mated Fay's mountaineering abilities in the same way perhaps he some- times overestimated his reader's ability to sustain a sense of wonder equal to his own. Robinson Jeffers' fierce, even sublime pantheism fuses with his bitter misanthropy to form a voice as bracing as a sharp salt wind off the cold, restless Pacific. But sometimes one longs for a modulating tone, a voice of human dimension. Admittedly, the banishment of this voice from Jeffers' verse helps give it its distinctive power. Nevertheless, how welcome it is after reading extensively in Jeffers to come across a little poem like the following.</page><page sequence="3">David Copland Morris 23 OCTOBER WEEK-END It is autumn still, but at three in the morning All the magnificent wonders of midwinter midnight, blue dog-star Orion, red Aldebaran, the ermine-fur Pleiades, Parading above the gable of the house. Their music is their shining, And the house beats like a heart with dance music Because our boys have grown to the age when girls are their music. There is wind in the trees, and the gray ocean's Music on the rock. I am warming my blood with starlight, not with girls' eyes, But really the night is quite mad with music, (v. II, 548) Jeffers here plays with, almost teases, his own dominant attitude and mood; the result is immensely appealing, like watching a lioness gently lick her cub. It is perhaps revealing that Jeffers left the poem out of his Selected Poetry . Did he see it as a moment of weakness, a frivolous footnote to his real work? Abbey was profoundly marked by Jeffers' poetry. A case could be made that Jeffers is the strongest influence on Desert Solitaire, stronger even than Thoreau. Abbey quotes Jeffers several times and there are many more intertextual interpolations apparent to those who know the poeťs work well. Indeed, Jeffers' "inhumanism" is like a steel reinforc- ing rod in the structure of Abbey's thought. Yet Abbey says in a late essay, "Like others, I admire Jeffers but I do not love him. He was not a wholly lovable man; not in his poetry: too grim, humorless, genuinely misan- thropic, his entrails consumed by some secret bitterness. He told the truth in his work and nothing but the truth (a rare thing in poetry) but did not tell the whole truth." {One Life, 72). After brooding for an hour during a pilgrimage to Jeffers' house in Carmel, Abbey says, "I feel the need for a different kind of outlook. I buckle myself into my motorcar and bear south again for the Big Sur coast. For Partington Ridge. For the spirit of Henry Miller" (OL, 72). Here is a clue to the character of Abbey's own work, for he somehow magically fuses Jeffers and Miller in his own writing. This is a major accomplishment, for while these two are both profoundly Dionysian, they represent opposite poles within that mode of sensibility. Though Abbey shares his Jeffersian inhumanism with Loren Eiseley,1 it would be hard to imagine two writers who sound so different. There is little of Henry Miller in the melancholy anthropologist. Eiseley* s half-love for easeful death can soothe and captivate a reader but one longs sometimes for the sound of brass to break through the</page><page sequence="4">24 Western American Literature mellow ensemble of oboe and bassoon. And one wishes occasionally, even while admiring the stoical strength, that a vulgar cry of protest would wrench itself from the text. There is a beautiful modesty and sincerity in Eiseley, but there is also something of the cleric, something repressed and at times even muffled - one finds nothing of this latter sort in Abbey. What Barry Lopez has to say in a laudatory essay about Abbey is instructive: "Writers, in my experience, can be courteous toward each other to a fault, especially in private; but they inhabit different uni- verses, and the will to remain in them is iron" (63). Lopez believes, however, that he and Abbey share "some unspoken sense of an opposi- tion to a threat, a definition of which we largely agree upon" (64) . What separates them is style and voice. Lopez's strength arises from beautiful modulation of tones in the middle register, a quiet and unforced sense of the dignity in his own character and in the unmolested natural world. His power is that of understatement, of restrained passion. Abbey rarely writes in that middle register, and there is almost never a sense of passion restrained - what he feels is given free reign. And Abbey has a problematic relation to the whole notion of dignity; he is not at all reluctant to play the buffoon, the tenderfoot, or to be the butt of the joke. The low comedy places his flights of lyricism and his caustic social criticism in a uniquely effective context. For the comic context suggests that to experience a reverence for nature one does not have to be - what is the word? - as "decorous," as "genteel," as "distinguished" as the personae of Lopez and Eiseley. Abbey is distin- guished, but the word doesn't suit him at all. One cannot imagine a banquet host introducing Abbey as "our distinguished speaker" but the phrase would fit Lopez or Eiseley quite well. Also, although I may be wrong about this, I can hardly imagine Lopez mentioning Celine as one of his favorite writers, yet the near-insane Frenchman is one of Abbey's literary heroes. Still, in fundamental spirit, Abbey always remains closer to Lopez's reverence than to Celine's nihilism. And finally, as for Annie Dillard, Abbey has said that though he recognizes her power as a stylist and generally admires her, her prose touches the sublimely reverent note too frequently for his taste. Of himself he says, "Some itch in the lower parts is always dragging me back to mundane earth among all you other denominators in the howling wilderness of American life" (JH, vii). You can hear some more of the</page><page sequence="5">David Copland Morris 25 sentimental good ol' boy, and also a more disagreeable sexism, in the following: Til never make it as a naturalist. If a label is required say that I am one who loves unfenced country. The open range. Call me a ranger. Though Tve hardly earned the title I claim it anyway. The only higher honor I've ever heard of is to be called a man. So much for the mantle and britches of Thoreau and Muir. Let Annie Dillard wear them now. (JH, viii) There seems to be an unpleasant linking of nature writing and effeminacy. One also wants to add that when a writer pursues the sublime as fearlessly as Dillard, and captures it as consistently as she does, she deserves the awe she inspires in some readers. In the view of many, an essay like "Total Eclipse" is as successful as it is audacious in its attempt at sustained evocation of the sublime. One feels in reading some of Abbey's comments on Dillard that he recognizes in her his strongest competitor as a stylist. She can do things he can't. For ex- ample, the mysterious lyric beauty of the first page of Pilgrim at Tinker Creek is beyond Abbey's range, open or otherwise. However, Abbey's suspicion that nature writers (including Dillard) lack, on the whole, a certain leavening vulgarity, and that this lack constitutes some kind of limitation, seems well taken. In my experience, a number of readers do have trouble connecting emotionally with Thoreau, Muir, Eiseley, Lopez or Dillard because they find them too rarified. Abbey's mul ti toned quality causes him to stand out from the writ- ers I have just discussed. The polyphonic voice of Desert Solitaire makes it difficult for opponents to identify and attack the center out of which Abbey's discourse flows; the multiple voices help defuse the resistance of the skeptical reader. (Although they have also in some cases confused the overly solemn one.) Because Abbey's celebratory tone bonds in Desert Solitaire to an ironic one which acknowledges the problematic status of a reverent attitude in the postmodern world, the book becomes an alloy of distinctive strength. One could identify several kinds of voices in Desert Solitaire and give them labels such as satirist, environmental advocate, lyricist, philoso- pher-scholar, buffoon-drunk, naturalist, storyteller. Sometimes they ex- ist in whole passages in pure forms and sometimes they are fused in intriguing hybrids. But there is a shiftiness in Abbey that makes him hard to pin down, a certain self-reflexiveness and doubleness. There are</page><page sequence="6">26 Western American Literature multiple voices within the book as a whole, and there is, in addition, often a rich instability within passages expressing a relatively pure voice. Here is a passage in which the satirist predominates. We need more predators. The sheepmen complain, it is true, that the coyotes eat some of their lambs. This is true but do they eat enough? I mean, enough lambs to keep the coyotes sleek, healthy and well fed. That is my concern. As for the sacrifice of an occa- sional lamb, that seems to me a small price to pay for the support of the coyote population. The lambs, accustomed by tradition to their role, do not complain; and the sheepmen, who run their hooved locusts on the public lands and are heavily subsidized, most of them as hog-rich as they are pig-headed, can easily afford these trifling losses. (35) There is great relish in Abbey's satirical attack. Without question, he is expressing a genuine anger over the way grazing has taken place on public lands. He is also offering an alternative to the senseless but widespread view that coyotes are somehow evil murderers. But there is something more in the passage, something of a Twain-like delight in exaggeration and reversal of expectations. This sense of fun runs against the moralizing content of the passage and gives it a chewy, cross-grained quality. There is an almost palpable distaste for assuming a posture of moral rectitude, together with an equally strong desire to either damn or convert those who would thwart righteousness. A similar tension exists when Abbey plays the role of sober environ- mental advocate. We seem to see him backstage taking off his cowboy hat, and then borrowing some fake horn-rimmed glasses and a pointer: Excluding the automobile from the heart of the great cities has been seriously advocated by thoughtful observers of our urban problems. It seems to me an equally proper solution to the prob- lems besetting our national parks. Of course it would be a serious blow to Industrial Tourism and would be bitterly resisted by those who profit from that industry. Exclusion of automobiles would also require a revolution in the thinking of Park Service officialdom and in the assumptions of most American tourists. But such a revolution, like it or not, is precisely what is needed. The only foreseeable alternative, given the current trend of things, is the gradual destruc- tion of our national park system. (65) In the context of his more free-swinging satire the somewhat stuffy restraint of this passage becomes rather amusing. Abbey says in an interview that he "prefers writers who can range over a whole scale of</page><page sequence="7">David Copland Morris 27 tones and voices, who can go from the burlesque to the bawdy to the sublime, poetical" {Resist Much, 36). Desert Solitaire has seemingly purely lyrical passages such as the following: Dark clouds sailing overhead across the fields of the stars. Stars which are usually bold and close, with an icy glitter in their light - glints of blue, emerald, gold. Out there, spread before me to the south, east, and north, the arches and cliffs and pinnacles and balanced rocks of sandstone (now entrusted to my care) have lost the rosy glow of sunset and become soft, intangible, in unnamed, unnameable shades of violet, colors that seem to radiate from - not overlay - their surfaces. (13) Beautiful, silky prose. But even in the middle of this lyrical flight there is a joke. However, because the joke is a serious one, the passage is even more textured. If the whole of Desert Solitaire can be taken as a medita- tion on anthropocentrism, then this joke can be seen as a many-sided probe of the issue. The phrase in parentheses quoted above - "(now entrusted to my care) " - pokes fun at the idea that any human could be so presumptuous as to feel that he was somehow the caretaker of the vast desert landscape - the whole thrust of the book is to evoke the otherness of the landscape and the value which inheres in it as other. But it is also a fact that humans have developed the capacity to destroy the land's beauty and integrity; therefore, it is indeed in Abbey's care. After all, as park ranger he represents society's small gesture toward protecting that value. A main preoccupation in the book, in fact, is the debate over what "care" really means. Abbey is perhaps at his best when he shifts radically from one voice to another, deliberately complicating the tone. The magpies and jays squawk among the pinyon pines, which are heavy-laden with clusters of light-green, rosin-sticky, fresh, fat cones - we'll have a good crop of pine nuts this year. A variety of asters are blooming along the road and among the dunes; with yellow centers and vivid purple petals, the flowers stand out against their background of rock and coral-red sand with what I can only describe as an existential assertion of life; they are almost audible. Heidegger was wrong, as usual; man is not the only living thing that exists. He might well have taken a tip from a fellow countryman: Wovon man nicht spraechen Kann , darueber muss man schweigen. [Whereof one cannot speak, one must be silent.] (278-79) A number of authors might have written this passage up to the mention</page><page sequence="8">28 Western American Literature of Heidegger - there things take a surprising turn. Abbey not only implies that Heidegger would naturally come to most readers' minds here, but he also flippantly suggests how obvious to him are the flaws in the famous philosopher's thinking. On one level, Abbey echoes the Twainian tone of small-town common sense challenging intellectual pretension; on another he seriously criticizes Heidegger's anthropocen- tric assertion of a sharp demarcation between human and other forms of life. He rejects Heidegger's claim of a human superiority which supposedly lies in a uniquely vivid form of being. But the rejection takes the form of the colloquially pkhrased advice that Heidegger might have done well to take a "tip" from Wittgenstein; the word choice suggests that the two might have been fellow golf pros. The whole performance evokes some thirties movie in which a character called "The Professor" gets wised up by the unlettered but street-smart protagonist. However, Abbey is far from unlettered. He evidently expects his reader to be familiar with Heidegger's technical notion of existence and to understand its anthropocentric bias. He also requires this reader to recognize the quote from Wittgenstein's Tractatus, and in the German. In addition, if I am not mistaken, he wants the quote to be read two different ways: 1) humorously, as a put-down of Heidegger's personal presumptuousness - as if Heidegger were one of ranger Abbey's obtuse tourists hopelessly blind to the reality in front of him; and 2) as an example in philosophy of the humble, reverential, and open-minded stance which is appropriate when contemplating the lim- its of language and the mystery in all existence. Abbey is by no means a know-nothing attacking philosophic inquiry; he does stress though that such inquiry must start in an accurate and sensitive account of experi- ence, an account which he feels Heidegger does not give. One of the funniest and most charming passages in Desert Solitaire, one which highlights Abbey's uniqueness as a nature writer, is the following. The cactus flowers are all much alike, varying only in color within and among the different species. The prickly pear, for example, produces a flower that may be violet, saffron or red. It is cup-shaped, filled with golden stamens that respond with sensitive, one might almost say sensual, tenderness to the entrance of a bee. This flower is indeed irresistibly attractive to insects; I have yet to look into one and not find a honeybee or bumblebee wallowing drunkenly inside, powdered with pollen, glutting itself on what must be a marvelous nectar. You can't get them out of there - they won't go home. I've</page><page sequence="9">David Copland Morris 29 done my best to annoy them, poking and prodding with a stem of grass, but a bee in a cactus bloom will not be provoked; it stays until the flower wilts. Until closing time. (28) The passage begins with what I would identify as conventional rhetoric. But with the phrase "You can't get them out of there" Abbey deliberately shatters the genteel, almost Longfellow-like tone constructed out of phrases such as "marvelous nectar." He then becomes a kind of barroom bouncer looking ruefully and knowingly at the patrons, understanding their psychology all too well; "Until closing time," is placed at the end with perfect timing and rhythmic emphasis. Through this whimsical anthropomorphism Abbey plays with the traditional rhetoric of nature writing. He also (seriously? - even sadly?) suggests a link between hu- man and non-human life in the form of ungovernable, ungenteel de- structive desire. Does the barfly in Abbey recognize the bee as his true Dionysian brother? When Abbey suggests, in a phrase quoted earlier, that he is unable to "maintain a constant level of high thinking" required of the "nature writer," he is less than completely truthful. His thinking on the relation of human to ņature is always penetrating and sometimes profound, but he does refuse to maintain the rhetoric or appearance of loftiness. There is high comedy and high seriousness in the following piece of dialog. Abbey and his friend Bob Waterman have camped in a remote wilderness area called The Maze. As they sit by their campfire, they ponder the question of naming the unnamed but visually striking geo- logic formations that stand out in the landscape before them. Why call them anything at all? asks Waterman; why not let them alone? And to the suggestion I instantly agree; of course - why name them? Vanity, vanity, nothing but vanity: the itch for naming things is almost as bad as the itch for possessing things. Let them and leave them alone - they'll survive for a few more thousand years, more or less, without any glorification from us. But at once another disturbing thought comes to mind: if we don't name them somebody else surely will. Then, says Waterman in effect, let the shame be on their heads. True, I agree, and yet - and yet Rilke said that things don't truly exist until the poet gives them names. Who was Rilke? he asks. Rainer Maria Rilke, I explain, was a German poet who lived off countesses. I thought so, he says; that explains it. Yes, I agree once more, maybe it does; still - we might properly consider the question strictly on its merits. If any, says Waterman. It has some, I insist. Through naming comes knowing; we grasp an object, mentally,</page><page sequence="10">30 Western American Literature by giving it a name - hension, prehension, apprehension. And thus through language create a whole world, corresponding to the other world out there. Or we trust that it corresponds. Or perhaps, like a German poet, we cease to care, becoming more concerned with the naming than the things named; the former becomes more real than the latter. And so in the end the world is lost again. No, the world remains - those unique, particular, incorrigibly individual junipers and sandstone monoliths - and it is we who are lost. Again. Round and round, through the endless labyrinth of thought - the maze. Amazing, says Waterman, going to sleep. (288-89) It is dizzying to trace the oscillation of Abbey's thought in this passage. Like a good inhumanist he sees the anthropocentric arrogance in the belief that naming is finally important, yet he feels the German idealist position is not without its truth. Good oY boy Ed agrees that Rilke' s unmanly financial arrangements undermine his authority as an epistemologist and metaphysician, yet philosopher Abbey finds this disqualification somewhat absurd. Abbey succinctly illustrates an important philosophic problem. Words seem to call the world into being, yet a preoccupation with the power of words to accomplish this awesome task causes us to lose the world again. And then we are lost. Abbey ends the whole thing with a frivolous pun as if the entire problem were a joke, which it may be. But it's also a joke that has attracted thoughtful minds since antiquity and which bears an important relation to the whole question of anthropocentrism and the human relation to the environment. Furthermore, Abbey is a writer and therefore shares with Rilke the fascination with words and their power seemingly to create worlds. He is also an ex-philosopher intrigued by the act of submitting the external world to rational analysis. One suspects that the anti-anthropocentric environmentalist in him feels guilty about his desires to play these potentially arrogant roles. Also, his working-class background, his American bias toward individualism and self-sufficiency, and his ma- chismo prevent him from fully embracing what Rilke represents. He is torn, but he presents his conflicts in a polyphonic comedy. Abbey exercises multiple voices, partly as a rhetorical strategy to disarm readers who might resist the environmentalist elements of his message, and partly as an expression of his own complex and sometimes contradictory feelings. After all, at the end of Desert Solitaire, he willingly sets out to resume the roles of social worker and barfly in Hoboken, New</page><page sequence="11">David Copland Morris 31 Jersey, a place where he spends six months of the year. A place, needless to say, which is the antithesis of the Utah wilderness. In an extremely interesting recent essay, Glen A. Love suggests: "Insofar as much contemporary literature - and criticism - has insu- lated itself from the biological and the natural world, nature writing seems to have responded to that lack, and to have provided a growing contemporary audience with that sense of an ecological reality-check which they do not find elsewhere" (203-204). He also says that the postmodernist literary climate has not been a hospitable one for nature writing, and this is generally true; however, Abbey combines the ecologi- cal reality-check with a postmodern linguistic playfulness. He is ex- tremely engaging when he undermines the boundaries of genre, deco- rum and discipline; he gains the power of the postmodern sensibility to question received meanings, but he shuns the porten tousness, empti- ness and mean-spiritedness of much postmodern work. He was indeed a solitary creature in the postmodern desert, but he adapted to the envi- ronment, located his niche, and thrived. NOTE 1. Eiseley wrote a couple of extremely perceptive reviews of Jeffers many years before the publication in 1957 of Eiseley's first major book, The Immense Journey. The pieces reveal Eiseley's profound engagement with the poet's "Inhumanist" perspective. The Sierra Club photobook Not Man Apart (1969) contains a foreword by Eiseley which displays his continuing fascination with Jeffers ' work and career.
