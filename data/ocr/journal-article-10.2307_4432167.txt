Xenophanes' Sun in the Theophrastean Doxographers Xenophanes evidently believed that the Sun was generated daily by the coalescence of bits on fire. This opinion is recorded in three II to III A.D. doxographies, all dependent on Theophrastos Physikai Doxai1). A?tios (2.20.3 = Xenoph. fr. 21 A 40 DK6) cites Theophrastos explicitly and states: ?? p???d??? ??? t?? s??a??????????? ?? t?? ???a? ??a?????se??, s??a???????t?? d? t?? ?????. Here there seems to be contamination2) from Herakleitos fr. 22 A 1.9 DK (where a?????? and ??a????as?? also occur together), for not elsewhere does ??a????as?? appear in Xenophanes, though it is common with respect to Herakleitos (frr. A 1.9, 11, A 11, and A 12 DK6); it does not scan and is probably Peripatetic in origin3). The s??-a?????e?? is more likely Xenophanes4), as it scans, and is 1) H. Diels, Doxographi Graeci (Berlin ?1879, 21929) for the dates; cp. also H. Diels, Lukrezstudien II, Sitz.ber. der Preuss. Akad. der Wiss. (1920), 2-9, cited within as "Diels (1920)/' 9. 2) G.S.

But Wilamowitz, Lesefr?chte, Hermes 62 (1927), 276 rightly rejects the final clause as a gloss. Otherwise neither noun nor verb is attested before Aristotle (e.g., Meteor. 1.3 [341a)], 2.4 [360b32], 2.8 [365b22]), in whom it is very frequent. Compare also ?????? in Herakleitos fr. A 14 and Empedokles fr. A 49, of similarly Peripatetic origin. The idea seems genuinely Herakleitean: cp. Kirk-Raven- Schofield 200-2, W.K.C.

Perhaps a sort of common denominator Urtext could be suggested for Theophrastos: ?. &lt; ??e?e &gt; t?? ????? ?? p???d??? a???????e??? ???es?a? ?a?' ???st?? ????a?. Xenophanes can not have written any form of p???d???^? none will scan (the other words in the reconstructed Urtext will). The last phrase is only in the second version, but seems likely. A further idea is found in the third version: [Plut.] Strom. 4 ( = fr. 21 A 32 DK.6): f?a? d? ?a? t?? ?????, ?? ?????? ?a? p?e????? p???d??? ??????es?a? ... t?? d? ????? f?s? ?a? t? dst?a ?? t?? ?ef?? ???es?a?.

Xenophanes* Sun on Trojan Ida Diels long ago filiated the five passages to be discussed below: he had linked Theophrastos to Epikuros and Poseidonios, Epik, to Pos. and Lucretius, Pos. to Diodoros of Sicily and Varr?, Varr? to Mela (Diels [1920] 8-9). He adds: "Aber die Ermittlung dieser sp?teren Tradition is nicht ganz sicher"6). I believe this can be made more certain by a close look at the texts (Epikuros, Poseidonios, Lucretius, Diodoros, and Mela). Epikuros writes in his letter to Pythocles (2.92)7): a?at???? ?a? d?se?? ????? ?a? se????? ?a? t?? ?st??? ?a? ?at? d?a??? ?e??s?a? d??as?a? ?a? ?at? s??s?? t??a?t?? ??s?? pe??st?se?? ?a? ?a?' ??at????? t?p??? ?ste ta p??e??????a ?p?te?e?s?a?

Epikuros writes of solar a?a??? and s??s??, but Bailey notes that he depends rather on Herakleitos fr. 22 A 12 DK6 (. A?tios 2.20.16) ??a??a voep?v t? ?? ?a??tt?? e??a? t?? ????? (Bailey, ad loe). I would add Herakleitos' ipsissima uerba (fr. 22 ? 30 DK6)*): p?? ?e????? ?pt??e??? ??t?a ?a? ?p?s?e????e??? ??t?a. There is nothing in Epikuros corresponding to the bits of fire, though of course he would be thinking of (collections of) atoms. Nor is the idea here properly one of coalescence, but of kindling and extinction: typically Herakleitean. Epikuros does not mention Ida. Diels' filia- tion was implicitly "Theophr. (Xenoph.)?&gt;Epik.": I would make it "Theophr. (Herakl.)-Epik."9) Poseidonios' words are lost but the thought is preserved in Str. 3.1.5 = Pos.

This is confirmed by the parallel in Kleomedes 2.1.89 (162.14-24 Z) - Pos. fr. 290a Th in part10): ? p?? a?t?? ? ????? s?e????e??? p???? ?p? t?? ??at???? pa?a???eta?; ???a ?a? ???a??f ??a?de? p?ste?sa?, ?? t??

Kleomedes makes it clear that the hiss is an "old wives' tale" of the Iberians, to be rejected. I have marked the parallels between Kleomedes and Strabo, showing the common source. But the hiss, the quenching (s?es/?-), and (in Kleomedes at least) the kindling (???ptes?a?) all point to Herakleitos (fr. 22 ? 30 DK6) or Epikuros, not Xenophanes. Xenophanes* coalescing sun would not hiss but scat- ter. In fact Kleomedes even cites Epikuros, direcdy after the passage quoted above (2.1.89 [162.25 ?]): ?a?ta ? ?e?? ?p??????? s?f?a ??e??e?. And if we compare the last three lines of the Kleomedes passage quoted above with the Epikuros passage above we see a precise parallelism of thought and construction: ? a?at???? ... d?se? ... d?a??? ... s??s?? ? a?at?????? ... ???ptes?a? ... d?se? s?????s?a? Thus we seem to have "Theophr. (Herakl.)?Epik. ? Strabo/ Kleomedes (Pos.)". Lucretius writes (5.660-5)11): 660 aut quia conueniunt ignes et semina multa confluer e ardor i s consuerunt tempore certo quae faciunt sous noua semper lumina gigni. quod genus Idaeis fama est e montibus altis dispersos ignis orienti lumine cerni 665 inde coire g lo bum quasi in unum et confie ere orbem. 10) L. Edelstein and LG. Kidd, Posidonius 2 vv. (Cambridge 1988), adloc. cite Kleomedes as parallel to fr. 119 EK; Jacoby FGrHist ??p???? likewise (plus Sen. QN 1.6). See Willy Theiler, Poseidonios 2vv (Berlin/New York 1982), ad loc. 11) VVm. Ellery Leonard and Stanley Barny Smith, T. Lucreti Cari De Rerum Natura (Ann Arbor 1942), cited within as Leonard-Smith, who cites Servius ad Georg. 1.247: ab ortu colligi scintillas et fieri orbem solis.</page><page sequence="5">XENOPHANES* SUN ON TROJAN IDA 303 (For the marking of the text, see below.) He goes on (666-71) to argue that the regular timing of the confluence of fire may be analogically understood by reference to flowering plants. (Leonard- Smith and Diels cite the Xenophanes fragment and Pomp. Mela.) This is the earliest mention of Ida in connection with Xenophanes* sun, but Diels argues convincingly that Ida may have been an observatory for Kleostratos, a contemporary of Xenophanes (Diels [1920] 5-6). This passage is clearly closer to Xenophanes than to Herakleitos?note (1) conueniunt, confluere, coire, conficere responding to (s??)a???????e???, (2) ign?s et semina multa and dispersos ignis responding to p???d???, and (3) tempore certo responding to ?a?' ???st?? ????a?. To none of these does Epikuros have explicit linguistic parallels; Herakleitos may have (3), if ??t?a be temporal12), but only that. Thus I would not filiate Lucretius from either Epikuros or Poseidonios (who follow Herakleitos) but would go back at least to Theophrastos. Lucretius seems to reflect Theophrastos once or twice (De Sensibus 61 at 1.358-69, idem 49, 65- 82 at 2.381-477, and Char. 16 on superstition at 5.1198-1202, see Leonard-Smith ad locc.)y and there is certainly nothing unlikely in Lucretius using Theophrastos' Phys. Dox. Moreover, other fragments of Xenophanes may be reflected in Lucretius: frr. 27,29, or 33 at 2.999 and 1.713 on Earth and Sea as sources of all things, and fr. 30 at 5.269-72 and 6.470-82 on the sea as the source of all waters. For fr. 30, note that Lucretius explicitly mentions amnibus 5.270 (to which compare Xenophanes* (&amp;?a? p?ta???), caput?that is, fons (which corresponds to Xenophanes' p???), and thirdly ad nubis augendas 6.473 (which corresponds to Xenophanes' ??fes??)? see Leonard-Smith, ad locc. Lucretius' use of Theophrastos' Phys. Dox. would also explain the numerous apparent citations of pre- Socrates (esp. Empedokles)13). Thus we have "Theophr. (Herakl.) ? Epik. ? Str./Kleom. (Pos.); Theophr. (Xenoph.)?'Lucr." In the second half we cannot rule Poseidonios absolutely out as an in- 12) M.

KEYSER termediary; as Diels points out, A?tios 2.20.3 has cited Poseidonios just before he cites Theophrastos for Xenophanes14). Diodoros of Sicily 17.7.5-7 writes of Ida15): ?d??? d? t? ?a? pa??d???? s???a??e? ???es?a? pe?? t??t? t? d??? ... ??as?a? d? t?? ????? et? ???t?? ??s?? a?at?????ta ta? a?t??a? ??? ?? ?????te?e? s???at? p??p??ta, ???a t?? f???a ?at? p?????? t?p??? ????ta d?espa??????, ?ste d??e?? p??? p?e?? ??????e?? t?? t?? ??? ??????t??, ?et9 ?????? d? s????eta? ta?ta p??? e? ???e???, ??? a? ????ta? t??p?e???? d??st??a ?a? t?t' ?d? t?? ????a? ?p??a???s?? t? fa????e??? t?? ????? ???e??? p??????? t?? t?? ????a? d???es?? ?atas?e???e? (p??p??ta Dindorf tet?a?????? MSS). There are some notable parallels to Lucretius which I have marked above in that passage and here: (a) to ??as?a? compare cerni (664), (b) to 2t? ???t?? ??s?? compare orienti lumine (664)?see Leonard-Smith ad loc., (c) to ?? ?????te?e? s???at? compare globum quasi... orbem (665), (d) to t?? f???a ... ????ta d?espa?????? compare dispersos ignis (664), (e) to p??? p?e?? compare ignes et semina multa ... ardorisf (f) to ?et' ?????? compare inde (665), (g) to s????eta? ... p??? e? ???e??? compare coire ... in unum (665), and (h) to ????ta? comparegigniy 662 (or conficerey 665). (In addition, to Epikuros compare ?at? p?????? t?p???.) But Diodoros is not translating Lucretius (a priori unlikely), for he adds two precise remarks not found in Lucretius: (1) ?ste d??e?? p??? p?e?? ??????e?? t?? t?? ??? ??????t?? and (2) the final passage ??? a? ????ta? ... ?atas?e???e?. Both are closely connected with the other Idan material and would not circulate separately, and would not have been invented by Diodoros. Thus there is a common source. Now above, I suggested "Theophr. (Xenoph.)? ?Pos. ? Lucr." (where Pos. is not necessary). The primary source of Diodoros 17 seems to have been Kleitarchos16), but he may have used others as well. Again one may suggest the ever-handy Poseidonios, but he is again not necessary?Diodoros could have read Theophrastos as well 14) See Diels-Kranz ad loe. (fr. A 40) and Diels (1920) 4, n.l. 15) Diels (1920) 7-8 derives from the section left out some interesting observa- tions on Xenophanes and Kleostratos. 16) E.

Moreover, as expected from the reconstructed Urtext of Theophrastos (Xenophanes) given above, ?????? and ??a????as?? are not paralleled here. Also, as suggested for Xenophanes (based on Pindar), we find that the bits of fire are described using the word spe??? (here the compound d?espa??????) and the word f???. Pomponius Mela 1.94-5 also describes sunrise from Trojan Ida18): speculantibus paene a media node sparsi ignes passim micare et ut lux adpropinquat ita coire ac se coniungere uidentur, donec magis magisque collecti pauciores subinde et una ad postremum//a m ma ardeant. ea cum diu clara et incendio similis effulsit cogit ac se rotundat et fit ingens globus. Mela displays parallels to both Diodoros and Lucretius (which are again marked): (a) to speculantibus ... uidentur compare ??as?a? and cerni, (b) to paene a media nocte... ut lux adpropinquat compare ?t? ???t?? ??s?? and orienti lumine, (e) sparsi ignes compare t?? f???a ... ????ta d?espa?????? and dispersos ignis, (d) to coire ac se coniungere compare s????eta? and coire, (e) to subinde compare ?et* ?????? and inde, (f) to una ... fiamma com- pare p??? e? ???e??? and in unum, and (g) to se rotundat ... globus compare ?? ?????te?e? s???at? and globum quasi ... orbem (note also fit, ????ta?, and gigni or conficere). Mela is twice parallel to D. S. alone: micare and a?t??a? ... p??p??ta, passim and ?at? p?????? t?p???. Moreover, in comparison with Theophrastos (Xenophanes), ?????? and ??a????as?? are again not attested, as expected from the reconstruction. Note that sparsi ignes is parallel to p???d??? and coire ac se coniungere to a???????e??? (the Latin reflexive se represents the Greek middle). Are the two co(n)~ prefixes here, the s??- in D. S., and the four co(n)- prefixes in Lucretius evidence of original s??-? 17) Kleitarchos may even have mentioned or cited Theophrastos?note the apparent confirmation of that in Pliny 3.57 (cited by Schwartz, Diodoros), and recall that Theophrastos and Kleitarchos' subject Alexander were both students of Aristotle. 18) Priscian DOT 528 and Solinus 11.4 also mention sunrise on Ida, but they refer to Cretan Ida, and only state that sunrise is visible there earliest.</page><page sequence="8">306 PAUL T. KEYSER (Mela has ignes ... collecti pauciores, implying that initially they were many, as in Lucretius ignes et semina multa ... ardoris.) I place these four parallels (Xenophanes, Lucretius, Diodoros, and Mela) in a table (see p. 310) for clarity. (Note that Diodoros and Mela omit any reference to ?a?' ???st?? ????a?; the explicit reference to Mount Ida in Diodoros and Mela falls just before the quoted texts.) III. Xenophanes' Sun: His Words? The extensive parallels I have argued are due to a common source, not a transmission Lucretius to Diodoros to Mela. Note the material common to Diodoros and Mela and absent from Lucretius, and the material in Diodoros unique to him and intimately connected with the Ida-vision. Now as Diels has shown, Ida is connected to Xenophanes himself (via Kleostratos), not to Theophrastos or Poseidonios (Diels [1920] 4-5, 6-8). It is most unlikely that either Theophrastos or Poseidonios invented the Ida- vision?what reason would they have had, unless Xenophanes himself already connected sunrise with Ida? Given all this, I would further argue that all the material concerning Ida must be from Xenophanes. To what extent then do these three passages (Lucretius, Diodoros, and Mela), the earliest extant versions of Xenophanes* thought, represent his words? I believe they may be quite close (though a complete verbal reconstruction is not possible). In a few cases I have suggested particular words (in the first column of the Table). First, Xenophanes' poetry was descriptive and imagistic, which is just what these are. Xenophanes' elegies describe in detail the preparations for a banquet (fr. ? 1), or contrast in detail the virtue of poets and athletes (fr. ? 2), while his hexameters (whence this fragment on the sun likely came) contain vivid criticism of anthropomorphic deities (frr. ? 14-16). Other images include fr. ? 17 ?stas?? d' e??t?? &lt;??????&gt; p?????? pe?? d??a, and three from his P. Phys. There is fr. ? 30 on the sea as the p??? of water and wind, fr. ? 32 on the rainbow:</page><page sequence="9">XENOPHANES' SUN ON TROJAN IDA 307 ?? t' TIptv ?a????s?, ??f?? ?a? t??t? p?f??e p??f??e?? ?a? f?????e?? ?a? ?????? ?d?s?a?, and fr. ? 38 on sweetness: e? ?? ?????? 2f?se ?e?? ????, p????? efas??? ???ss??a s??a p??es?a?. Secondly, and complementing this argument, are a pair of stylistic points concerning Mela and Diodoros. This sort of detailed description of natural phenomena is hardly characteristic of Mela's Chorographia, at least, as even he warns (1.1-2): Orbis situm dicere aggredior, impeditum opus etfacundiae minime capax (constat enim fere gen- tium locorumque nominibus et eorum perplexo satis ordine, quern persequi longa est magis quam benigna materia) ... dicam autem alias plura et exactius nunc ut quaeque erunt carissima et strictim. The problem of Mela's sources is unsolved, perhaps insoluble19). He surely used Cornelius Nepos' lost Chorography (Gisinger 2402), probably also Sallust's Historiae (Gisinger 2401, 5), and numerous Greeks have been detected, especially the ever-handy Poseidonios (Gisinger 2398- 2405). Although Herodotos (Gisinger 2370, 2385, 2404) and Hekataios (Gisinger 2369, 2385, 2404) have been suggested, no other Ionians have yet been recognised. But Mela himself gives us a clue that (for the circumfluent Ocean at least) he consulted the Physici (3.45): Sedpraeterphysicos Homerumque uniuersum orbem mari cir- cumfusum esse disserti Cornelius Nepos ut recentior auctoritate sic certior. This makes one think of Tha?es or Anaximander (as does Mela in his encomium on Miletus, 1.86)?or of Xenophanes20), who in fr. ? 30 expatiates on Ocean: p??? d' ?st? ???ass' ?dat??, p??? d' ??????? ??te ?a? ?? ??fes?? &lt; ?????t? ?e ?? ??????? 19) F.

I would note that Mela also emphasizes the role of Ocean, in 1.4 huic medio tena sublimis cingitur undique mari, and in 1.5 ambitur omnis Oceano quattuorque ex eo maria recipit. As to Diodoros, he is fond of paradoxe, but is certainly not original (in Book 17 he depends heavily on Kleitarchos, e.g.). Yet seven words in this passage occur only here (or rarely) in Diodoros, or are used here in a technical sense not found elsewhere in Diodoros. First, a?at???? only thrice elsewhere in Diodoros, twice of the Sun (15.18.3, 19.18.1, plus 3.8.6 of plants). Although d?aspe??? is com- mon, in Diodoros it is used of human action only and never of natural events21). The noun ?????? is rare and technical in the sense 'horizon', and elsewhere in Diodoros always means 'boundary' as of a region22). The verb ??????? is striking, as it is elsewhere poetic (Pindar, Archilochos, and the Attic tragedians) or Ionian, not being found in Attic prose, or elsewhere in Diodoros (cp. LSJ, s.v. for the characterisation). ???e??? usually means 'stature' (of per- sons), 'size' of objects, or 'greatness' of quality, while it is rare in the technical sense of 'magnitude' (LSJ, s.v. 1.1, 1.2, II, and III respectively), and in Diodoros is found with ????? only here. The absolute (i.e. without modal genitive or dative) use of p????? in the passive is rare and usually technical (LSJ, s.v., III.3, generally of time, or the moon), and the one possible parallel in Diodoros seems remote (16.93.1 of a theatre). Finally the precise t??p?e???? is found only thrice elsewhere in Diodoros (1.52.2, 2.48.7, 19.98.1) always geographical, and other such compounds (tet?a-, pe?ta- and ??a-) never. Of these seven words, four (??????, ???????, p?????, and t??p?e????) occur in the text of Diodoros just where he is not parallel to Mela or Lucretius. 21) Diodoros 1.28.1, 5.56.1, 11.12.6, 21.2, 61.6, 12.70.4, 14.57.4, 59.4, 15.3.5, 16.49.8, 55.4, 58.4, 17.35.1, 69.6, 19.53.4, 64.4, 20.30.2, 67.3, 34/5.2.2, 30. 22) Diodoros 2.16.7, 3.8.4, 10.3, 20.1, 12.82.3, 18.6.1, 3, 31.8.8.

(Diodoros), and sparsi ignes (Mela). In addition, all three passages emphasize that the multiple fires become one: in unum (Lucr.) p??? e? ???e??? (Diodoros), and una ... fiamma (Mela). This is neither logically nor stylistically necessary, since the verbs used of the coalescence would sufficiently imply that: conueniunt ... confluere ... coire (Lucr.), s????eta? (Diodoros), and coire ac se coniungere (Mela). Moreover, in none of the doxographies dependent on Theophrastos is unity emphasized. But such an emphasis on unity might well be expected from Xenophanes, who, though the Sun was no God (that is the point of his words, and compare fr. ? 26 (on the immobility of God), strongly emphasized Unity in his thought. Of God he writes that he is One (fr. ? 23, and A 30) and Whole (fr. ? 28); of Water that it all comes from Ocean (fr. ? 30)23). Both these points are embodied in the first column of the Table (Ida and the round form are as well). Now, it has been argued that after Cicero, Xenophanes' poems were not extant (Guthrie 1.367, n. 1), but even if that were certain, Lucretius could still have consulted them. Moreover, there was evidently more in Theophrastos than we have (note the numerous ? fragments of Xenophanes cited by late authors) and Xenophanes' verses on the Sun may well have been quoted and not merely paraphrased by Theophrastos. Another possibility (already alluded to) is Poseidonios, who in his famous P. Okeanou may well have quoted numerous early 'authorities' on Ocean. At any rate, Strabo, to whom we owe some 5/6 of our fragments of the work, often relies on or defends Homer's view of Ocean24). 23) On Xenophanes' emphasis on unity? see Guthrie 1.380. I would add that although Xenophanes nowhere in fr. ? 1 uses any form or derivative of e??, a feel- ing of simplicity and unity of mind is definitely communicated. 24) Compare Theiler frr. 1-79, where 55 pages out of 66 are from Strabo, or Edelstein-Kidd fr. 49-Str. 2.2.1-3.8 plus frr. 214-229, 246-9. The later editors are more sanguine in assigning specific fragments to P. Okeanou.</page><page sequence="12">310 PAUL T. KEYSER IV. Conclusion The attested fragments of Xenophanes on the Sun (A 32, 33.3, 40 DK) indicate that he believed that small bits or coals of fire came together to make the Sun anew daily. Lucretius and Diodoros report precisely the same theory, as does Mela in a very un-Melan passage. Those passages display verbal parallels to the postulated Urtext of Theophrastos* report of Xenophanes, and significantly omit words found in the later doxographical notices but which Table of parallels on Xenophanes* Sun Theophr.

Moreover, they are all three closely parallel to one another in such a way that a common source can be postulated. The technique of composition in this common source is similar to that of Xenophanes' poems. Both Lucretius and Diodoros may plausibly have used Theophrastos. But Mela at least is nowhere else seen as reading Theophrastos Phys. Dox., while he does seem to have used Herodotos and Hekataios, as well as the Physici. These last are cited in connection with remarks on Ocean not inconsistent with Xenophanes fr. ? 30. Taken together all this suggests that, while startling, it is not at all impossible that Lucr. 5.660-5, D. S. 17.7.5-7, and Mela 1.94-5 are freely translating Xenophanes on the Sun. I would add that these three passages are the earliest extant evidence (being earlier than the extant doxographies) for Xenophanes' Sun, and ought to be cited in discussions of the fragments25). 80309 USA Boulder, Colorado, U. of Colorado, Dept. of Classics 25) Neither Kirk-Raven-Schofield nor Guthrie cite any of them.
