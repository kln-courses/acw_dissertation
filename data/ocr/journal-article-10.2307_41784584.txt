<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RGVEDIC PHILOSOPHY OF THE BEAUTIFUL BY P. S. SA8TR1 (i) Fine Arks strive after the Beautiful and reveal it in their own ways. The measure of their excellence and their popularity directly dapend upon the degree of their manifestation of Beauty. Poetry being the crown of the Fine Arte, poetic Beauty is the quintessence of all higher aesthetic values. u All Beauty is in perception or imagination "t in the fixed and heightened intuitions of the genius which can record and interpret ' At the same time it is not purely subjective ; for Beauty is " that which has chara- cteristic or individual expressiveness for sense-perception or imagination, subject to the conditions of general or abstract expre* ssiveness in the same medium"8. Beauty demands harmony, regularity, unity, along with the characteristic expression for sense. It is abo/e all a creation, a ne*r individual expression in which a new feeling comes to exist *. Beauty, therefore, iß full of sugges- tion. It is objective. As Hegel would have it, Beauty is the Idea as it shows itself to sense4. The Idea as such is 4 the concrete world-process considered as a systematic unity " 5. The Idea finds the fullest non-sensuous expression of itself in the human intelligence. This Idea is unconsciously embodied in Nature, and consciously in Art, where it constructs for itself a more adequate representation equally aotual for sense. The formal principles of symmetry and balance, therefore qualify, rather than constitute, Beauty And the best material for Fine Art is the divine in any live-form ; in Nature, Mind is alive, while Nature is alive in Mind , or as Bosanquet would have it, the Finite Mind 1 B.

The ideal of Beauty exhibits calm and serene majesty, beatific enjoyment, and a* deedless and infinite self-repose* B. According to Croce, Art is the expression of impression, and expression is identical with intuition. * Expression is essential ; but it can only stand for feeling or Experience. 4 It oan just vibrate our heart and unite it with our thought so that we can pursue successfully " the atmosphere of infinite suggestion " '. Therefore the Aesthetie Enjoyment is " pleasure in the nature of a feeling or presentation, as distinct from pleasure in its momentary or expected stimulation of the organism " 6. (ii) It has been oft-repeated that Aesthetics in India has been confined only to Literature. But even a cursory glance into works like Sukra Niti, Visnudharmottara, MSnasära, will reveal that the Indian Genius carried investigations of Beautiful into all the Fine Arts systematically. Even in Sanskrit literature we ccme across references to painting and other Fine Arts, and to the Beauty of Nature. As a typical example we can take the grèat poet, K&amp;lidftsa, who while describing FärvatI observes : " Unmllitam tülikayeva citram sõryãmáubhir bhinnam ivãravindam babhüva tasyãè caturasraáobhi vapur vibhaktam navayauvanena " 7. Beauty is revealed through the painter's brush. It does not mean that it was non-existing prior to this. It was alive as the thought of the painter. The brush is only an instrument. But his thought is subjeotive , and Beauty is never perfect or oomplete in itself as long as it is associated with a human personality ; for Beauty is the Concrete Universal, the fact of the Universe. It is the spirit. i Principle of Individuality, Lecture X. * Hegel : Aesthetik, I. 237, 388 Etc., * Aesthetic ( Translation by D. Ainsle ). á Three Lectures on Aesthetic by Bosanquet, p. 37. 5 A. C.

Hence the poet compares her Beauty to the flower that blossoms when the rays of the sun touch it. Human associa- tion prevents the full manifestation of Beauty That is, unlike Hegel, Kãlidàsa finds, in Nature a true type of Beauty. Human form might be most beautiful, but it does not deny the possibility of its manifestation in Nature. On the other hand, the objectivity of Beauty implies that the finite personality should be lost in it *. There is Beauty in the Lotus and the rays only make it conscious of its purpose. But this Beauty is one, a concrete whole, a system. It is not an aggregate of Beautiful parts ; for Beauty beautifies the parts. s. Beauty is elusive and suggestive4. In other words, according to Kfilidãsa, Beauty is the creative act of the aesthetic consciousness of the Absolute. This he calls 4 Lalita Srsti 9 in Raghuvamsa ( 6. 37 ), and 4 Lalita Vijñana 9 in Malavikãgnimitra ( 2. 13 ). This very idea underlies his statement in Kumãra- Sambhava that Siva is " Naisthika Sundarah" (5.62) Beauty is spiritual. In these observations and others on the same subject, Kãlidàsa is faithfully interpreting the Upanisadic thought. In the Upani- sads the Absolute is spoken of as Sãntam, Šivam, Sundaram". Again we hear of the Absolute as " Sat, Cid, Ananda In the philosophical language Existence and Consciousness have a place, for they define the Nature of Reality. The Religious aûd the philosophic experiences are the higher ones where the Absolute is experienced. But when the Real is described as Ãnanda, we have every reason to conclude that according to the Upanisadic seers, Ãnanda or the Aesthetic experience is the third higher expereince 5. That is, the Upanisadic Absolute is Truth, Goodness, and Beauty. 1 Cf. 41 Mukham apy unnamitam na cumbitam tu " ( Säkuntala, 3.22 ). This is best annotated by Keats in his Ode on a Grecian urn : " She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss. For ever wilt thou love and she be fair 1 " , 1 Cf.

" Prabhä taralam jyotih " ( Säkuntala 1.21 ). 6 Jagannätha, therefore, is correct in interpreting * Raso val sah • in purely sesthetic terms.</page><page sequence="4">88 Atináis oj the Bbatidarkar Oriental Research Institute • The Upanisads represent the speculative, metaphysical and mystical aspects' of the vedic culture in to far as this culture is enshrined specially in Rgveda. Just as Eälidäsa is the finest representative of the vedic culture in the classical times, so does the Rgveda stand for the culture of that Age in its entirety. Of the two higher experiences symbolised *by " Sat " and " Oit " we have the best exposition in the philosophic and the Mystic hymns of Rgveda and in the wisdom of the Upanisads. Of the third higher experience symbolised by Änanda, we have the best exposi- tion in Taittirlya Upan is a d and in the aesthetic activity of Rgvedic seers. The seers of Rgveda took themselves justly to be poets of a very high order ' The perceptual and intuitive observation and apprehension of truth or Reality as Beauty constitutes the poetic experience. The Rgvedic poet beheld Beauty in his environment, in Nature that Gentle Mother of human life and existence. He experienced the Reality immanent in the Actuality as Beauti- ful. He realised that the human being conforms to the realisation of the eternal act of the will of the spirit So the Individual was felt to be Beautiful. He began recognising his aesthetic expe- rience and artistic creations to be the Copula between the Absolute and himself 8. Hence his songs became Beautiful. These songs manifest Thought, Reality or Spirit ; and consequently the Beauti- ful was identified with Reality, Absolute, Spirit, Thought. That this was the Rgvedic concept of Beauty can be proved, from a close study of the passages occurring in the hymns. There are many passages in Rgveda dealing with the concept of Beauty. Whenever a definite problem is attempted or an enunciation of a technical branch of knowledge is undertaken, we generally observe a new terminology cropping up. In the same way the Rgvedic seers employed certain technical words when they had to refer to the degrees of Beauty. Some of the words are : Psaras, Pesas, Apsas, Drs, Sri, Vapus, Valgu, Sriyas, Bhadra, Bhand, Caru, Priya, i See Proceeding*, AIÇC, NUJ, QJMS, ABORI. 8 Cf.

Pischel has examined the words Apsas , Pehas and Psaras to evaluate the Rgvedic concept of Beauty A more systematic attempt of the same was made by Oldenberg in his essay on u Vedic words for 4 Beautiful ' and * Beauty 7 and the Vedic sense of the Beautiful " 2. (iii) Oldenberg examined fourteen words of Rgveda having a bearing on Beauty. His contention can be briefly summed up as follows : - &lt;$ Drè and Šri refer to that which is pleasing to the view. Šriyas rests upon the body. ( 2. 10. 1; 3. 38. 4; 9. 94. 4). Bhadra means bearing happiness, and it represents an objeot or person whose sight brings gladness or joy. It is 4 pleasing possession. ' Bhand is closely associated with Bhadra. Cãru stands besides Priya , and mears delightful, lovable. Bhadra means that which bestows happiness, while Cãru is that which i? pleasing or that which creates a sensation of pleasure. Thus Cãru refers also to the beauty of apperance. Kalyãyia refers to the personal beauty of human or divine beings. Ěubh gives the idea of sslf-adornment, finery and display. It is an external attribute of the being. Vapus describes the brilliant, beautiful sights. There is the conception of wonder around this word as can be seen from its association with Citra and Darsata . Valgu denotes the springing or undulating motion in joy, and henee it brings forth the skilful, felicitous movement. Darsata , Rüpa, and Svãdu also refer to the physical perception. Rav&gt;va denotes the beautiful, something which is filled with well-being, satisfaction or which is connected with it. It can also referto the subject who experiences this state of mind. Vãma describes those things in the attainment of which one rejoices 1 Vedische Studien I. 308-318 ; II. 113-125 ; III. 195-198. s Originally published in Göttingen, 1918.

Citra also belongs to the realm of p8rcep tioD, though there is an inkling of the inner spiritual perception.1'' The enquiry here is considerably limited. At the same time it presupposes many things. Words like Svädu , Priya and Bhand have been interpreted in a way that is contrary to the spirit of Vedic Sanskrit. By no stretch of imagination can they be sepa- rated from the idea of denoting the Aesthetic consciousness or experience. Šubh and ériyas are relegated to the decorative parl- our, while in reality they speak of the stuff out of which the skein of Beauty is revealed. Citra and Darèata directly refer to the objectivity of Beauty, while Vapus connotes the idea of the sublime along with Yaksa , Oandharva and Adbhuta . Oldenberg likes to interpret in his own way for he proceeds on certain assum- ptions. As it has been shown previously,2 here also one can very well find his unwillingness to accept the Vedic passages at their actual value. And like Bloomfield, he too is not afraid of contradicting himself in the same paragraph. Having arrived at certain conclusions regarding the words, Oldenberg proceeds to examine the concept Of Beauty itself in Rgveda. His interpretation of the terms denoting Beauty is not only false and unacceptable, but contrary to the spirit of the Samhitã. Consequently his conclusions regarding the concept of Beauty in Jtgveda, based on his own false analysis, are, to quote Geldner, " a piece of Oldenbergian Phantasy. 99 He finds that the " life and beauty of the human form did not as yet appeal to the poets of the Rgveda. " There is here an " admiring joy in the beauty of nature. Beauty is given in its grandeur and in utter simplicity. There is " beauty of force and greatness, of swift motion, of light, of the milder charms of the dawn, of the victorious strength of the rays of the sun and the fire. Tue poet first saw " beauty in human form and in the appear- ance of the Gods that resembled human beings. lìe saw it again in nature and in the 4 works of human skill, above all in poetry, his own production. 9 There is a 4 fondness for rich adorn- ment. ' And finally, Oldenberg declares that there is no mention 1 Rïïpam 32. 98-115. &amp; See KUJ on the 1 Origin of Songs of Bgveda. *</page><page sequence="7">The fcgvedic Philosophy of the Beautiful §t of the word which denotes physical beauty in a manner which cannot be mistaken.1 Then follows another line of argument which can be summa- rised in the following words *• The conception of Beauty in Rgve- die times is not very great, since Beautiful is never placed in India on a par with the universal forces.8 The prefix 'Su-' in the words like 4 Supeàas ' only denotes 4 a very ancient expression of estimation of values, in which there is as yet no distinction bet- ween the practical, aesthetic, and moral appreciations8. ' Just as his comrade-at-arms, Winternitz, fondly held that the Rgvedic seer could not distinguish between an epic, a lyric and a ballad so did Oldenberg imagine that the Rgvedic concept of Beauty is deeply intertwined with the practical and moral values. There was no clear coception of Beauty, but only a hazy one where the senses enjoy a prominent place. 4 The Beauty of which the Vedic singer dreamt evidently contained a strong admixture of brilli- ance, pomp and ornamentation. ' Here possessions and wealth are included. It is 4 an imparting of Beauty ?.5 Before we examine these contentions, we should remember that the Rgvedic poet never endowed his deity, save the Maruts, with the human frame. And though Pargiter is enabled to postu- late the origin of Idols here, it is rather difficult to arrive at this conclusion. The Rgvedic seer is preoccupied more with the spirit behind the apperances; and to him "the more the universe is spiri- tual the more is it Real. " The occidental Vedic pandits err in many a way because of their refusal to understand this p.gvedic thought, because of their fondness to read Pantheism into the Samhitä. The seer talks of a vision and of an experience. He ena- bles us to comprehend it imaginatively. We cannot visualise the deity in a human shape ; nor can we know the actual form of the deity. Yet we do have the intellectual and imaginative feeling of Beauty. The most common limbs that are referred to are the hands, eyes, cheek and chin. At times the hair and the dress too i Bapam, 32. 116-119. « Ibid. p. 121. * Ibid. p. 113. 4 Some problems of Indian Literature. 6 RQpam, 32. pp. 101, 104.</page><page sequence="8">92 Annals oí the Bhandarkar Orientai Research Institute acquire prominence. All the same his preoooupation is not with the anthropomorphic deity, but with the transcendent and imma- nent spiritual Reality. Oldenberg's insistence on the superior Beauty of the human form is directly traceable to that influence of Hegel whose aesthe- tic has no place for Natural Beauty. Only since Turner, the European Mind began to attach greater significance to the Beauty of Nature ; and it is no wonder that Oldenberg treats the Beauty of Nature enunciated by the ßgvedic poet to be formal. It is that peculiar Hegelian insistence on the supremacy of the Concrete Universal as embodied only in the Individual. But Oldenberg exhibits lapses. He too nods like Homer, but without Homer's sublimity in doing so. At one place he tacitly assumes that the 4 life and beauty of the human form did not as yet appeal to the poets of the ßgveda. ' A few lines later he states forgetting this statement : The poet first saw ' beauty in human form and in the appearance of the Gods that resembled human beings ' ' He &amp;aw it again in Nature ' The consistency in these statements can be familiar only to Oldenberg, or to Bloomfield who spoke a similar language of self contradiction with reference to the Poetry and the Religion of Rgveda. The fact is that these occidental scholars are aware of the conceptions of the seers. But they do not want to admit these canceptions or to build them into a connected system. They alone know why they want to proceed in this way. In the same way does Oldenberg proceed in maintaining how every conceivable word refers only to physical Beauty or to the form ; and this discussion is given an epitaph by him in the words ; ' there is no mention of the word which denotes physical beauty in a manner which cannot be mistaken And yet he has taken pains to read into the Samhitä something which he is sure he can not find. Still he says that in the vedio concept of Beauty the senses alone are prominent. The next attack is on the concept of Beauty in the History of India as a whole. According to him the Indian Mind never considered Beauty as a universal force, but mixed it up with the practical and other forms of activity. This is a wilful distortion</page><page sequence="9">The Rgvedie Philosophy of the Beautiful 93 of truth. To take but one example the Upanisads speak of the Absolute as 1 Sat, ' 1 Cit, ' and ' Ãnanda. * These three respectively stand for Truth, Goodness and Beauty which alone are universal forces even according to Hegel and his followers. The Indian Mind seized upon this truth long long before the European Mind came to exist. And this fact has been sufficiently made clear in the pages of the present work. Hence arises the necessity to reinterpret the words examined by Oldenberg and others, so that one can formulate the ttgvedic concept of Beauty, ( iv ) The grand scenery presented by a huge mountain or a bewitch- ing valley thrusts itself upon the individual whether he wills it or not. Sometimes a finer perception can evoke this experience even when the presented object is too familiar, as in the case of the 4 Daffodils ' which made Wordsworth sing * " They flash upon the inward eye, Which is the bliss of solitude. " Awe and fear, wonder and astonishment, an inexplicable but enchanting Beauty and Love constitute our experience at this stage. Such is the sublime which is one of the profoundesfc Aesthetic experiences. In ßgveda this idea is expressed to a great extent by the words * Vapus 9 and ť Yaksa. 9 For example : " Avardhayant subhagam sapta yahvlh àvetam jajñanam arusam mahitvä àiéuam na jãtam abhyãrur aávã devãso agnim janiman vapusyan" ( 3. 1. 4 ) * The seven rivers developed Agni ; he was white at birth and grew red gradually 5 like mares running to thdir newly bom child, the gods were astonished at his birth. * Here the origin and development of Agni presents a process that includes the évolu- tion pf the red oolour from the white one, This in its turn gives</page><page sequence="10">94 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute rise to the idea of Fire coming out of water. Apparently this is contrary tô experience. And it is heightened by the fact that the Gods are compared to the Mares. The cumulative effeot is one of awe, fear, and reverence. It is sublime or Vapus, for a normal thing is seen as supernormal. Again, " Idam rapur nivacanam janãsaá caranti yan nadyas tasthur ãpah dve yad Im bibhrto mãtur anye iheha jäte yamyä sabandhö " ( 5. 47. 5 ). " The waters stand firm, but the rivers flow ; this secret knowledge is sublime ( Vapus ) ; separate from his mother, two support him, closely united twins. " The sun is hidden in the waters of the sea ; he rises from the waters, which represent the unfathomable law of Nature. Aditi, the mother of the sun, is invisible. Heaven and Earth are the twins which are sundered apart. But the poetic intuition comprehends Reality as all-inclusive. Heaven and Earth have a common origin. That is, they have their context only in the concrete coherent system of Reality. It is this Beality that is truly sublime. This sublimity rests upon knowledge, the knowledge derived from Experience. Then again another seer says : " Sa me vapuâ chadayad aàvinor yo ratho virukmãn manasä yujãnah " ( 6. 49. 5 ). The fact that the chariot of the Aàvins is yoked with the mind is a delighting Sublimity. A chariot requires only horses. But these gods have a chariot that employs thought instead of horses. It is only thought or Aesthetic Imagination which is Supreme Reason that can fathom Reality and comprehend the multiplicity as belonging to the system. The sublimity belongs to the nature of thought. Thought here is not discursive, but synthetic, since it yokes or unites the objects to form a system. Another poet observes : 41 Vapur nu tao oikituçe cid astu samftnam nfima dhenu patyamänam martesv anyad dohase plpäya sakrc chukram duduhe prènir udhah M ( 6. 66. 1 )•</page><page sequence="11">The Rgvedic philosophy of the Beautiful 9 J #&lt; One swells among mankind for milk, and Práni has milked her bright udder only once. But the general name of a oow is given to all. And even to the wise this will still be sublime ". Prsni is the heavenly cow and the Maruts are her children. She has milked her udder only when they were born. She alone deserves the name of a cow, since only her children fertilise the Earth. But we have many cows and thus the word ' cow ' is indis- criminately applied. Consequently, sublimity demands propriety or Aucitya ; it is based on the apprehension of the characteristic and the significant. Then again, " Tad in me chañsad vapuso vapustaram putro yajíñanam pitror adhlyati Jãyâ patim vahati vagnunã šumat pumsa id bhadro vahatuh pariskrtah 99 ( 10. 32. 3 ). 4 More sublime must seem to me. When the son duly cares for his parents' line, the wife attracts the husband. With a shout of joy the man's auspicious marriage is performed aright '. The individual learns the wisdom of his father and desires to preserve his family in order he might carry on the torch of learning and culture to the future ages. With this idea he marries. And marriage, therefore, aims not at physical or carnal lust, but at spiritual communion. In the language of Kathopanisad and Kalidasa's Dusyanfca, Marriage should not be based on Preyas, but only on Sreyas. When Sreyas becomes the enlivening principle, the institution of Marraige really becomes sublime. Sreyas is only another name for the spiritual factor in existence. As such, True sublimity is spiritual. These illustrations prove that Vapus in the Rgveda means sublimity. And sublimity means ( i ) Respect and fear for the spirit, (ii) Experience and knowledge of Reality ; (iii) Synthe- tic thought that comprehends the Heal as a coherent system ; (iv) Apprehension of the characteristic and the significant as one ; and ( v ) Perception of the spiritual in life. &lt;▼&gt; Yaksa is interpreted by von Roth as 4 a supernatural being, f ' spectral apparition. 9 Qrassmann takes it to mean ' those who</page><page sequence="12">$6 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute break forth quickly the flood of light, ' 'glittering meteor. ' Bergaigne gives 1 supernatural apparitions. ' Ludwig, after Sãyana, means * feast, 9 4 festival. ' Deussen states 4 Wondrous thing, ' 4 prodigy. ' Bloomfield and Oldenberg pre'er 4 spirit. ' Geldner observes that in some places Yaksa is something dre- aded or detested as sin, and in other places something pleasant to the eyes ; it is found in nature1 and in the breast of men.8 Ànd, therefore, he gives the following meanings : ( 1 ) Astonish- ment, Surprise, Curiosity ; ( 2 ) Wonder, Mystery ; ( 3 ) Wonder, Piece of Art, Magician ; ( 4 ) Sorcery, or Witchcraft ; ( 5 ) Encha- ntment, Transformation. ( 6 ) Trick, Imposture, Illusion; (7) Power of working Miracles, Miraculous Cure, Healthy Magic; ( 8 ) Object of wonder or Curiosity ; ( 9 ) Wonderful Creature ? ( 10 ) Festival ; ( 11 ) Prodigy in Nature8. Yaksa in classical Sanscrit is a semi-divine being of rare Beauty enjoying a love for Riches and pomp; that is, he is a contradiction in terms. He is both the Thesis and the Antithesis. Exactly in the same way does the Sublime remain, since it includes in itself the feelings of fear and respect. It is a strange or unique synthesis. And the Bgvedic Conception is not far from this, though a slightly different evaluation is offered to us in the Samhitä One seer observes : 4 Amõrã Viávà Vraanàvimã vã m na yãsu citram dadráe na yaksam ( 7.61 5 ). Something strange was perceived and this is described as Yaksa. A thing is strange only when it contradicts itself. Hence do we read : 44 Naksatram pratnam aminac carisnu Yaksasyädhyaksam tavisam brhantam " (10.88.13). The sun is called the A.dhyaksa or the over-lord of the Yaksa or the sublime which is supernatural. The sublime is itself the supernatural and the sun is the overlord of this sublime, for the 1 Atharva Veda 11. 6.4. * VSjasaneyl 8 arfa hi ta, 34.2, * Vediiohe Studien, III. pp. 126-143.</page><page sequence="13">The ßgvedtc philosophy of the Beautiful 97 sun is feared for bis beat and respected for bis warmtb and light. Again, " Mâ ta enasvanto yaksin bhujema Yandhismä viprah stuvate varütham " ( 7.88.6 ). Varuna is a Yaksin, besides being a May in ( 6.48.11 ) Varuna is the guardian of Rta, the spiritual principle of the Universe. He is Yaksin or sublime, because people are afraid of him as the cosmic Law ; they love him as the spiritual principle. That is, Varuna is the synthesis of the Good and the Right ; and hence a Yaksin and a Mäyin. Bfhaspati is a Yaksabhrt : " Asya áloko divlyate prfchivyãm atyo na yamsad yaksabhrd vicetãh 91 ( 1.190.4 ) Here also the Law of prayer is as abstract or as concrete as • Varuna. The Good and the Right are related in him as knowledge and Prayer. It is this unification that brings sbout the sublimity of Brhàspati, Still more sublime is the conception of the Beautiful and Romantic Maruts as sublime ; " Atyäso na ye marutat svañco Yaksadrso na áubhayanta maryäh Te harmyesthãh áišavo na áubhrã Vatsãso na prakrllinah payodbãh " (7.56.16 ). The Maruts are swift as horses, they deck purifying themselves ( áubhayanta ) like youths who are like a Yaksadrãas ". According to Geldner, here it means ' Youths at a festive gathering ' But " Yaksadráah " only means they are sublime and are objects of Experience and Knowledge. That is, sublimity is truly objective. It is only when its antithesis is associated with it that it becomes also subjective, only to transcend these subjective and objective values in the final synthesis, Thus Yaksa also denotes sublimity, but here it implies ( i ) self- contradictory in the sense that it çvokeç in the spectator a coq* 13 I Annals, B. O. E. 1. 1</page><page sequence="14">9? Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Instituto tradiotory or conflicting emotion ; ( ii ) Unification of fear and love; ( iii ) Synthesiß of Good md Right ; and ( iv ) Objective. ( vi ) The Gandharva protects the dwelling place of Soma, and the generation of the Gods ; he is Adbhuta or Sublime. " Gandharva ittbã padam asya raksati Pàti devãnãm janimãny adbhutah " ( 9.83.4. ). The fact that Gandharva is made to protect the Divine that sustains him, is the point of sublimity. That is, the sublime consists in the dissociation of the substantive and its adjective. The substantive rejects the Adjective for it does not fit into the context. The Gandharva represents the splendour and the majesty of the sun, along with the reposing calmness of the Moon. The oo-existence of splendour and quietude is inconceivable by thought ; but yet it is possible for it can be experienced. Hence he is Adbhuta ; he presents an inner discord, the violation of the principles of Objectivity and Individuality. The Gandharva is the guardian of Soma and the second husband of the virgins, though his ward is the first. That is, the sublime is beyond time and it does not change. Yet there is change within it. The wiáe lick with their thoughts the waters that are in the firm place of the Gandharva : " Tayor id ghftavat payo viprä rihanti dhltibhili Gandharvasya dhruve pade " ( 1. 22. 14 ) The poetic intuition licks or experiences the sublimity or Gan- dharva, only as long as the sublime is objective and unchanging. The seer moved in spirit and beheld the Gandharvap procee- ding with their V^yukeàas t " Apaàyam atra mapas* jagat)vftn vrate (JandhsrvSn api vftyukeéSn " ( 3 88, 6 ). The Viy.ukeéas ate an apparent impoesibility t but yet they agree with the intuitive apperoepfclcm. Ooneequently the sublime invol- ves a contradiction of the empirical fact only to ensure greater harmony and fuller riches»,</page><page sequence="15">The ftgvedic philosophy of the Beautiful 99 The moon is the divine Gandharva of the floods : 44 Apãm Gandharvam divyam nrcaksasarn somam visvasya bhuvanasya rajase " (9. 86. 36 ). And yet we are told at another place that the waters are in the firm place of the Gandharva. In other words the sublime is changeless though there is change within it Though the Gan- dharva is a lover, his path is Rta : 44 Agnir gãndharvlm pathyãm rtasya " (10. 80. 6) The unification of Love and Law is, therefore, another important feature of the sublime. This divine being inspires the thoughts so that we may distinguish truth from falsehood ( 10. 139. 5 ). And the seer moves across the paths of the Apsarasas, Gandharvas, and Mrgas, 44 Apsarasäm gandharvánãm mrgânâtn carane caran Kesl ketasya vidvãnt sakhã svãdur madintamah " (10.136.6). There he becomes the friend and enjoys the Aesthetic ecstasy. Here is the transport to higher realms along with fear and respect, the true definition of the sublime. ( vii ) Next we have to examine the words that refer to the various aspects of Beauty. First we have * Apsas ' Von Roth interprets 4 Apsas ' by 4 cheek * or 4 some other part of the body 9 ; Böhtlingk by 'forehead', or 'face'; Weber and Grassmann by 4 breast 9 ; Ludwig by 4 face ' 4 cheek ' and in 8. 45. 5, by 4 waist ' ; and Indian tradition by 4 form ' or 4 rüpa ' This word is applied to Usas twice in the text. In 1. 124. 7 WQ read : 44 Jãyeva patya uéatï suv&amp;sâh u§ã ha8reva ni rinite apsa^ • Like a well-dressed beloved in love to her lover, does U?as unmask her beauty ( apsah ) like a 4 hasrä Taking for granted that 1 hasrä ' and 4 Yo$ä Bhadrä ' refer to courtezans, Fischel first interpreted 1 Apsah 9 as 4 cheek % 4 forehead 'faoe'» 'oountenance' ' But here and in 1 Vedisohe Studien, I. 310.</page><page sequence="16">loo Annals of the ßhandarkar Oriental Research institute " Prati tvã áavasl vadad giräv apeo na yodhisat " ( 8. 45. 5 ), Säyana gave the meanings as ' Rüpa Daràanlya. ' ' Hasrä, only means ' a smiling maiden ' The other passage is : " Esa pratici duhit&amp; divo nçn Yoseva bhadrã ni riçlte apsah " ( 5.80.6 ). " Standing before mortals, this daughter of the Heavens unmasks her beauty (apsali) like a happy woman. " Bhadrã, need not be taken to mean ' lusty ' with Geldaer and Pisohe!. We have ' Dlrghãpsah ' as the epi;het of a cart, and ' Sahasrä- psah ' as that of the sacrifice i " Eatho väm miträvarunä dlrghãpsãh sy ömagabhastih süro nädyaut " ( 1. 122. 15 ). " Ãpo na maksü sumatir bhavä nah. sahasräpsäh pyfcanãsãn na yajãah " ( 9. 88. 7 ). Säyana interprets them as ' Ati vistata rüpa ' and " Bahu rüpa. " Here the Beautiful is comprehended as Extension or all-inclu- sive ; that is, Beauty is all-inolusive. There is nothing outside Beiuty. Ás such Apsah means only Beauty as objective. Like a smiling maiden usas unmasks her Beauty. This Beauty is not physical, but psycho-physical at the same time. It is ' Lävanya ' that is immanent and transoendent at the same time. ( viii ) The next word is ' Psoras. ' Hillebrandt, Ludwig and Benfey interpret it as ' food or ' meat * ; Von Roth as ' favourite dish ' ' enjoyment ' or ' feast ' ; Grassmann as ' meal ' ' repast ' feast ' or ' treat ' ; and Sãyaça as ' pãnlya ' anna ', 4 bhaksana ' and so on. We have ' Devapsarastama1 ' ' Madhupsaras8 ' ' Supsara- stama3 ' and other compound formations. The word ' Psara ' is found in 1 9. 104.5. " Sa no medãnSm pata indo devapsarS asi " 9. 105,5. 11 Sa no harírçãm pata indo devapsaras tamah M * 4. 33.3.

" ( 9. 2. 2 ) ; Ä&lt; Kadhã íãdhãma sakhäyah sfcomam mitrasy äryamnah mahi psaro varunasya " ( 1. 41. 7 ). Here we find the term associated directly with the inherent Beauty as revealed in the appearance or form or shape ; that is, beauty as relative to existence or expression is stressed here. Consequently 4 Devapsaras 9 is the 4 Divine expression of Beauty ' and 4 Supsarastama ' is the 4 best expression of Beauty.' And, therefore, in the Rk " Aaüta prsnir mahate ranãya tvesam ayãsãm marutãm anlkara te eapsaräso * janayantãbhvam ãd it svadhäm isirãm pary apaáyan" ( 1. 168. 9 ). it means the same. These passages, therefore, do not state simply the ' form ' or the 4 object 9 as Pischel thought. They indicate that Beauty, which is Reality or Truth, expresses itself through a finite medium. In this expression there are grades or degrees for it differs according to the medium selected. Thus Beauty is not purely abstract; for it has a reference to form with which it achieves a unity or Ananyatva. (ix) Following Pischel were we to interpret 4 Psaras 9 as 4 form ', then 4 Apsaras ' would mean 4 formless. ' Pischel, of course, draws a significant comparison in this connection with Vãyu who is conceived as Beautiful in the Samiitä1. 'Apsarasas' are the celebrated nymphs of Beauty and Loveliness. To imagine that they are 4 formless, ' as does Pischel, is to run contrary to Aesthe- tic experience. * Vediscbe Studien, III. 195-198.</page><page sequence="18">tùl Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Iustiiuu The Apsarasa is the ocean nymph (Samudriyâ apyâ yosâ) wedded to the Gandharva of the floods1. She smiles sweetly and supports her lover in the sublimest heaven8. Here we have evi- dently a subtle reference to the graceful and charming expression of Beauty that evokes feelings of love and life. Hence the Apsa- rasa here is the embodiment of objective Beauty. The Apsarasas fly like red kine and low like milch cows3. They fly like soared snakes in terror, and like chariot horses when the car touches them4. Here we are told that Beauty is just like a serpe ot in a way ; and Browning speaks of the ' Serpentining ' Beauty of a lady. That is, Beauty attracts human adoration, but discards mortal touch. It is this that constitutes spiritual Beauty. While Purüravas could not adore this sublime Beauty, the Ap3a- ras fled like the first dawn5, still flashing brilliant like the fal- ling lightning6. The Apsarasas are said to exhibit the Beauty of their bodies like swans. But the actual $k reads: " Yad ãsu marto amrfcãsu nisprk sam ksonlbhih kratubhir na priikte tã ãtayo na tanvah áumbhata svã asvãso na krllayo dandaáânãh " ( 10, 95. 9 ). The bodies of these damsels are purified, decorated or sanctified ( Sumbhata ) like those of the swans. Therefore they bite and nib- ble like horses in play when a mortal wooes these Immortals. 9} (*) Then there is the word ' èri ? which has been variously inter- preted. It is used as 4 auspicious or evoking respect 7 in classical » R. V. X. 10, 4 Etc., a R.V.X. 123. 5: 44 Apsarã jãram upa éisnryãçâ Yosã b.blî arti parame vy oman. " 3 R. V.

It denotes simply the Beautiful. It is interesting in Aesthetics to enquire the relation between the Beautiful object and its ornamentation. How is tbe decoration related to the decorated ? Before we decide this, we have to find out whether the so called 'decorated' requires any 'decoration.' Do the decorations actually beautify the object ? Or do the Beauti- ful obejects make the alamkaras Beautiful ? One poet observes that the rays make even the unlovely (asrlram ) look beautiful (supratlkam ) : 44 Yüyam gãvo medayathä kisam cid asrlram cit krnuthã supratlkam " ( 6. 28. 6 ). This is a significant verse giving us the opinion held by the seers of ßgveda on the relation between the Beautiful and its Alam- karas. Even that which is not Beautiful ( asrlram ) is made to appear Beautiful by the rays. In this hymn the word 4 gävah * does not mean 4 the cows, '" but 4 tbe rays of light of the dawns. ' Usas in Rgveda primarily stands for Aesthetic Beauty, and secon- darily for the Dance of consciousness or the Cosmic Dance. There- fore everything, even the Non-Beautiful becomes Beautiful in the realm of Fine Art. And Kãlidãsa echoed this idea when he naively observed J 41 yad yat sãdhu na, citre syãt kriyate tat tad anyathã. 1 It is not the Alamkãra that makes an object Beautiful. On the other hand, the Beautiful transforms into itself even the Alam- kiras. Therefore according to the Rgvedic seers, Beauty belongs to Fine Arts*, and outside the Fine Arts there is no Beauty. Hence do we read in * Sukra Niti Sãra * 44 Sãstra mãnena yo ramyah sa ramyo nãnya èva hi. 1 91 And Abhinavagupta observes s ' AbhijnãnasSkuntalam, 6.14. 1 Sukrânítisãra, 4. 4,104.</page><page sequence="20">ÎÔ4 Annals of the Btmdarkar Oriental Řesearch Institute " SarvänugrShakam hi é&amp;stram iti nyäyät tena nfitya èva rasä, no loke. K&amp;vyam oa Eãtyam èva 1 " Hence the Beautiful cannot be defined in terms of its Alamk&amp;ras. It is self-existent and eelf-subsistent. It is self-complete and all inclusive. It is the Spirit or Reality manifesting through expression or finitude, At the same time it is quite possible that a Beautiful object can be disfigured by ornamentation. This takes place when the decoration does not fit in with the decorated ; in the language of metaphysics when the substantive rejects the adjective. A gar ment can make a man unlovely ( aárlra) : " Aárírã tanur bhavati ruéatl päpayämuyä " (10. 85. 30). (xi) The vedic poets also speak of Alamkftras or the form of Beauty, the form which involves the relation between parts and the whole. A certain amount of artistic effort can be seen in a beautiful object. We are told that all kinds of Beauty ( Visvã árlh ) are decked ( pipiée ) on the bodies of the Maruts : " Nrmpã slrsasv ãyudhã rathesu vo viávã vah árlr adhi tanusu pipiáa " ( 5. 57. 6 ). Here the poet is referring more to the formal graces that stand as appendages, as the dress of an individual, and not as his skin. Hence hô is emphasising the point that the decorations made to the Beautiful are like the clothes one puts on. That is the Alath- kãras do not constitute the Beautiful, nor do they develop the Beautiful. In a word, they are not essential. Hence it is that a poet observes that a beautiful ornament enriches Beauty that is already inherent. " Šrestham vah peáo adhi dhãyi daráatam " ( 4. 36. 7 ). The inherent Beauty of an object is always objective and can be apprehended as such ( darsam ). The ornament ( peáah ) is simply tagged on to it. Another informs us s 1 Abhinava BhSratl.</page><page sequence="21">The Rgvtdìc Philosophy oj the Beautiful 105 " Surukme hi supeèasâdhi èriyfi vìrftjatah M ( 1. 188. 6 ). The bright and lustruous decorations clothe the Beautiful. But the Beautiful shines in itself ( Virá jatah ) or is 44 Svayam prakäsa" Beauty exists in itself ( Virãjatah ) and also for itself ( daráatam ) (xii) Valgu is from 4 valg ' meaning ' springing or undulating motion as applied to the horses, the monkeys, joyous people, the surging waves, the heaving bosom and the like. 9 Here is inten- ded a sort of * skilful and felicitous movement. ' 44 Brhaspatim yah subhrtam bibharti valgüyati vandate põrvabhãjam " ( 4. 50. 7 ). Here we pass to another interesting aspect of the Beautiful. The Beautiful is not simply 44 the seifexistent Pleasant, " or 44 the self- subsistent Emotional. 9 9 It is beyond Pravrtti or activity only in a transcendental sense. The Beautiful is active or an acti- vity. It constantly realises itself by virtue of the fact that it is sustained by the artistic and aesthetic movement (Valgu). It is undulating or ever active. In being active it is of the nature of consciousness. Cttra , Dariata , and Rupa also seem to convey something about the form of Beauty. But all these refer primarily to the objecti- vity of the Beautiful. 44 Srestham vah peéo adhi dhãyi. daráatam $9 (4. 36. 7 ). The Beautifual is an object that can be apprehended or realised. Its existence or manifestation does not depend upon the indivi- dual will. The awareness of Beauty depends only upon the acti- vity of the experiencing Individual. 44 Vãyav ã yãhi daráateme soma aramkrtãh ' ( 1. 2. 1 ). But in this statement the Rgvedic poet accepts a new feature of Beauty. He is referring to Vayu or the wind as the objective Beauty, and he is contrasting this Váyu which is Beautiful in itself, with Soma that is decorated ; that is, with the Soma that exists for something else. Consequently while the Alamkãras are 14 [ Annals, B. O. R, I. ]</page><page sequence="22">lo 6 Annals of the Bhandarkar Örtental Research institute only means to an end, Beauty alone io an end in itself and for itself. (xiii) Beauty bas a formal aspect beside a material one. The form is 4 Lãvanya, 9 while the content is 4 Bhãva. ' In Beauty we require * Bhãva Lãvany a Yojanã, p for they can be distinguished, but not separated. The form includes symmetry, harmony, balance and propriety. It should be the fitting vehicle conveying the thought. It should evolve a synthesis. That is, the content merges itself in the form, or loses itself in the form to appear. Thus the form comes to hide it. Hence it is said that * Art lies in concealing Art. ' The formal art consists of polish, artistic finish which should not appear to be the result of conscious endeavour. Though the poet * should load every rift with ore, 9 yet poetry should 'come' and appear 4 as naturally as the leaves of a tree. * This aspect of Artistic touch is conveyed by the word 4 Šubha. ' Maruts are the first and foremost possessors of áubha in ßgveda. But the Aávins are called ãubhaspatl. By itself 4 Subh 9 cannot be said to refer to the formal aspect alone. This word in classical Sanskrit connotes auepiciousness, and in the vedic it also refers to purity. As such it involves matter. Consequently when Maruts possess subha, it only means that they are auspicious, pure. These two qualities present a synthetic unity of content and form. And hence the Asvins, who are the great aestheticians, are said to be áubhaspatl. (xiv) Material possessions beautify the object or person owning them in the sense that they bring into prominence the latent or the potential Beauty. The Alamkäras constituting the formal side of art are no better than material possessions. They are finite or sensuous. They beautify in so far as they become proper or appropriate instruments manifesting the spirit of Beauty. Their 1 Cf. u Röpabiiedäh pramSçãoI bhãvalãvanyayojanam sãdfsyam varçikãbhanga iti cit ram sad aâga kam" ( JayamaògalS on VStsyäyana ).</page><page sequence="23">The ftgvedic Philosophy of the Bcautijul îo? Value lies in being proper media and nothing more. Now, Peias in Rgveda may be interpreted as formal decoration. Asvapesas and vãjapesas might actually support this contention. But the Bgvedic poets also speak of viávapeáas, sahasrâpsa and Hiranya- pesas. Here it is impossible to reconcile ourselves to the statement that the Rgvedic poets isolate the formal aspect, or that they insist on the form alone -, for Viávapešas plainly refers to the Beautifying of the whole or to the universal Beautifying. In either case it cannot be formal. Similarly sahasrâpsa can refer only to the innumerable ways in which Beauty is revealed. And Hiranyapesas has the proper meaning in Yäska who takes Hira- nya to signify 44 Hitaramanlya. 19 It is instructive and delightful, the spirit and the sense. Beauty is the synthetic unity of content and form. It is always more than the sum of its parts. The parts lose their sepa- rate or individual significance in the Beautiful object. They form into an integral whole, an organic system. The principle of Beauty is immanent in them. The form a« such, therefore, means the proper medium for the revelation of the Beautiful. That is, ornamentation or decoration acquires its significance by virtue of its characteristic medium-value or expression value. And yet the medium cannot be separated from its contents just as the sound which is the medium cannot be isolated from its mea- ning, and just as the body from the soul. The medium of expre- ssion and the content of expression have relation of Ananyatva. One poet of ßgveda observed - 4 The heroes come to the assemblies in Beauty ' : " Nrpeáaso vidathesu pra jätä abhimam yajñam vi caranta pûrvlh " ( 3-4-5 ). Here "Nrpeáas 4 has the meaning 4 Beautiful men ' and not 4 Beauti- fied men Again another says, * The song of the poet is pure thought ( Dhiyam ), and is sucipesasam ' 44 Eti pra hotä vratam asya mäyay- ordhvàm dadhânah àucipeêasam dhiyam " ( 1-144-1 ). The decoration acquires purity or is pure since it manifests the</page><page sequence="24">í 08 Annals of ibi Bhxtiidrk.tr Orientât Research institute purity of thought. And so we read, 4 Agni makes the sacrifioe assume varied Beauty ( purupeèasm ) by thought 9 K In the Naighanftika Peêas is read under the names of 1 gold 9 ( 1.2 ) and ' form 9 ( 3.7 ). And von Roth bas assigned the meanings of (i) * Object 9 4 form * ; ( ii ) * artistic figure, 9 4 ornament 9 4 fabric Varna, Vapus, Nirnig and Rüpa all refer to Rõpa or form of the object. Comparing the passages employing Pesas, and examining the forms Asv&amp;pesas, Vãjapeáas, Vlrapeáas, Nrpeáas, Rtapeáas, Visvapeáas, Šucipeáas, ťurupeáas, Hiranyapeêas and Supeéas, Pischel has arrived at the conclusion that Peáas refers to form, object, colour B. The latter literature no doubt uniformly employs Peáas to denote a sort of decoration or the external appearance or form of Beauty. Yet the foregoing usages reveal that Peáas denotes the synthetic unity of content and form. ( XV ) There are again passages to prove that the concept of Beauty in Bgveda demands this synthetic unity. We read 4 Thought is Beautiful in itself and so are its refinements It is 4Sukravarnam' 44 Eti pra hotã vratam asya mäyay- ordhvãm dadhãnah áucipeáasam dhiyam 9 9 (1-144-1). Thougt is éucipeáas. Is it decorated by purity ? or pure with decoration? Both meanings are wrong, for it refers only to the purity of Beauty. Moreover we read : 4 Indra brings Beauty to that which has none ' • 44 Ketum krnvann aketave peáo maryä apeáase sam usadbhir ajãyathãh 99 ( 1-6-3 ). The 4 apeàas 9 or the non-beautiful becomes beautiful by virtue of Indra's activity , i. e. the activity of the spirit. It is the spirit of Beauty alone that transforms everything into the Beautiful, because Reality or Absolute is itself the Beautiful as a poet says • 4 Varuna himself is the Beauty of the rivers ' • 41 Rãjã rãstrãnãm peéo nadlnãm " ( 7-34-11 ) 1 R.

They have their context or significance only in him. Varuna is 9tapeãas (5. 66. 1 )» while the Asvins are ßtapsü ( 1. 180. 3 ). Sta is not tbe Deity's decoration, ncr is the deity the decoration of Eta, tbe moral and spiritual principle ia the universe. The deity is 3eauty or Rta, or Beauty of Rta or Rta of Beauty. ( xvi ) Oldenberg interprets some words as referring to the form of Beauty. But a close examination will reveal that they refer to the contents also. They suggest the indivisible Unity and oneness of Beauty. Tbe Maruts, for example, are reported to have decorated ( pipišre ) their bodies with their golden natures like young suitors, sons of wealthy people. They set their lustrous Beauty ( áriye áreyãmsab) on their forms for glory : " VarS ived raivatàso hiranyair abbi svadhãbhis taovah pipiáre áriye áreyãmsas tavaso rathesu saträ mah&amp;msi cakrire tanusu " ( 5. E0. 4 ). Here the lustrous Beauty is set on their forms ; and this setting only refers to its manifestation or revelation ( Abhivyakti ). Hence another poet says : ' The look of Agni is the sweetest ( svädistha ) and Bbines like gold in Beauty ( áriye ). ' " Tava svädisthägne sam drstir id &amp; cid ahna id ä aktoh ériye rukmo na rocata upãke " ( 4. 10. 5 ). Beauty is not only the self existent, but also the active and obje- ctive present. The splendours ( áriyah ) of Agni are fair ( spãrba ) to see '• *' Spãrhã yasya áriyo dráe " ( 7, 15. 5 ). This perceptibility or cognizibility makes Beauty objective and suggestive, for Agni is fair to see. The perception suggests a train of Ideas ' In the pleasant ( spãrha) hues of Agni, effulgent Beauty ( Sriyah ) is visible ' •• " Tvam agne Mibbrta uttamam vayas t»ya sp&amp;rhe varça ft sariidrái sriyah " ( 2. 1. 12 ),</page><page sequence="26">no Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute The Rtus shine ( viräjatah ) ia great Beauty ( áriyâ ) with beauti- ful jewelled decorations ( surukmehi supeáasâ ) : "Surukme hi supeáasã áriyã virãjatah U9asãveha sldatãm " ( 1. 188. 6 ). With fair jewels and radiant Beauty ( Sukrapiáam ) the divine damsels are in Beauty ( èriyam ). &lt;ř Divye yosane brhatl surukme adhi sriyam áukrapiáam dadhãne 99 ( 10-110-6 ). The decorations do not add to the Beauty. They are themselves made Beautiful. As Kãlidãsa says in Sãkuntalam, " Kim iva hi madhurãnãm mandanam näkrilnäm #' 4 The Maruts are beautiful (cäravah ) like the elevated horn of the bull for beauty ( áriyase ) and like horses; they show themselves for Beauty ( áriyase ) like bridegrooms ' •• " Gaväm iva áriyase árngam uttamam süryo na caksü rajaso visarjane atyä iv asubhvaá cäravah sthana maryä iva áriyase cetathä narah " ( 5. 59. 3 ) Beauty constantly strives after Expression. This expression alone renders possible the fuller Aestheic experience. * The bodies of the Aévins shine with delightful beauty 9 ( spärhayä árlyâ ) î 44 Abhi vãm viávâ niyutah sacante spärhayä áriyã tanvä áubhãnã 99 ( 7-72-1 ). And 4 Beauty sits on every face ( anlkesu ) of the Maruts 1 : 41 Sthirâ dhanväny äyudhä rathesu vo' nlkesv adhi áriyah* ( 8-20-12 )• That is, the face alone is the powerful revealing medium, for it contains the two supreior senses or the two Aestbetio senses called the Eye and the Ear I See Bharata's N5$ya ¿Bstra : " Kr)4an!-yakam ioohlmo dpáyam áravyam oa yad bh&amp;vet &gt;' C f, Hegel'a Aestbetik : Einleitung, on the Aesthetic senses.</page><page sequence="27">The Rgvedic philosophy of the Beautiful lit Beauty, in these passages, is coDCeivd as a splendour, an efful- gence that gushes forth spontaneously and powerfully. It might be exprienced as a pleasant emotion; but it is, in reality, objective. To be apprehended and experienced, Beauty must be in the object of thought and of feeling. At the same time it is apprehended as one with its medium of révélation, for Art is the sensuous mani- festation of the Real !, or as Kãlidãsa said, 4 Lalita Vijñana2 ' ( xvii ) Oldenberg's list of words does not consist of the words for Beauty and Beautiful alone. Just as his Ãkhyânas comprised of dialogues, monologues, soliloquies and ballads, so do these words. There are certain words which refer to the aesthetic experience proper. Others speak of the object of Beauty as self-luminous. One such important word is Bhand. This Bhand refers to the luminous manifestation of Beauty in a finite form, through an object. A sort of radiance is felt. Night and Dawn shine ( ãbhandamãne ) with beautiful decoration : " Ã bhandamäne upäke nakfcosäsä supeáasâ yahyl rtasya mâtarã sidatam barhirä šumat " (1-142-7) In different colours they come near, smiling and shining: " Ä bhandamäne usasä upäke uta smayete tanvä virõpe " ( 3-4-6 ). The wise Agni is the beloved of many and yet he shines. 41 Ã viveáa rodasi bhõri varpasã purupriyo bhandate dhämabhi^ kavih " ( 3-3-4 ) The radiance is eternal, and ever fresh. Hence it is a characte- ristic of Beauty. The radiance emanates from the object and constantly beoomes new by creating or revealing itself &amp;t every moment s. 1 Hegel t Phil, dee Religion 3,8 Aestbetik. 8 MUavikHgnimltram, 2-13, ' Of.

The wife of Indra is Kaly fini, and there is joy for him in his home. " Pitur na putrah sicam ä rabhe ta Indra svãdisthayã girä saclvah " ( 3-53-2 ) The ladies that visit the festiva gathering are Kalyänyah and they are smiling. " Abbi pravanta samaneva yosãh kalyänyah smayam&amp;näso agnim " ( 4. 58. 8 ). Agni is Kalyãna and so are the waters and Soma : " Tram no agne pitror upastha ã devo devesv anavadya jãgrvih tanükrd bodhi pramatiá ca kãrave tvam kalyãnã vasu viávam opise 99 ( 1. 31. 9 ). "yäbhih somo modate harsate ca Kalyãnlbhir yuvatibhir na maryah 99 ( 10. 30. 5 ). ( xir ) Bhadrã as an Aesthetic term denotes delight and happiness. Beauty here is the union of the significant content with the cha- racteristic form which is well constituted and developed. So Usas is Beautiful ; she exhibits her form like a bride decorated by her mother. As such she is delightful ( bhadrã ) : 44 Susamkãáã mãtr mrsteva yosä ävis tanvam krause dráe kam bhadrã tvam uso vitaram vyuccha ( 1. 123. 1 1 ). 4 The delighter has come following the delightful dame ; the lover follows his sister. * Beauty as latent is spoken of here : " Bhadro bhadrayã sacamãna ãgãfc svasãram jãro abhy eti paáoât " ( 10. 3. 3 ). Beauty refers to the mind. It is a way of oonceiving, feeling and experiencing the object. Finally it is knowing for it is sustain- ed by cognition.</page><page sequence="29">The Rgvtdic philosophy of the Beautiful 1 1 J In some oases Oldenberg interprets Bhadrft as 'the indwelling spiritual force1. ' This contradict» his peculiar thesis of Rgveda exhibiting an elementary notion of Beauty. But as usual Olden- berg nods, and be speaks truth while nodding. A poet observes : " ubhe bhadre josayete na mene gftvo na vfisrâ upa tasthur evaih " ( J . 95. 6 ). ' The delightful wives tend Agni. ' Here it is not so much the indwelling force that is emphasized, as the characteristic expre- ssion of Beauty. They are delightful only when they are Beauti- ful. Similarly we read •* ' The Maruts are the bridegrooms having a delightful beloved ( Bhadra Jãnayah ) ; " Pará vlrãsa etana mary&amp;so bhadrajãnayah " (5. 61.4). Opposite to men, like a pleasing lady does Usas bend her forehead downwards. " Esâ pratici dubita divo nfn yoseva bbadrä ni rinite apsah " ( 5. 80. 6 ). With beautiful decorations were a lady to be pleasing ( Bhadrä ), she finds at once a friend herself among the people : " Bhadiâ vadhûr bbavati y at supeá&amp;h svayam s§ mitram vanute jane cit " ( 10. 27. 12 ). The poet wants a delightful and happy ( Bhadram ) inind, mental power, and energy : " Bhadram no api vätaya mano daksam uta kratum " ( 10. 25. 1 ). It is the delightful or the pleasing activity ( Bhadram Kratum) that he longs for : " Rtasya raémim anuyacchamSnä bhadram bhadram kratum asmäsu dbehi " ( 1. 123. 13 ). Agni is pleasing like an activity ( Kratur na Bbadrah ) 1 Eflpam. 32. 107. IS [ Annals, B. O. R.

This is, Beauty Bets in motion the Aesthetic activity, which is cognitive, affective and conative at the same time. It involves the sensations and images sustained by the continuity of interest and attention. It renders possible the intuitive apprehension of the poetic fact. Then alone can we have the ' satisfying imaginative experience1. ' ( XX ) Raçva signifies ' delight ' the experience of thè spectator. The same idea of rejoicing is again evident in Vãma. This enjoyment is a transcendental or spiritual ecstasy, a transport to higher realms of thought and experience. It is a direct and immediate experience of an objeot as united into a system with the subject. The lines like " Idam srestham jyotiçãm jyotir ftgSo citrah praketo ajainsta vibhvS " ( 1-113-1 ). Such lines show that the object of poetio experience is near at hand ; but the poet experiences a new birth. This perception of Truth as Beauty is the experience of the inner life of things, of the vital spiritual principle of the Universe. Svãdu conveys the nature of the poetio experience of the Beautiful. Sweetness is the prime characteristic of Beauty. Cãru on the other hand denotes the pleasant state of a pleasant object. The oblation is ' cáru priyatamam ' ¡ " Abhlm rtasya vistapam duhate prânimãtarah Cãru priyatamam havih " ( 9-34-5 ) Indra's might and Soma are pleasant : " Sa id vane namasyubhir vaoasyate cãru janesu prabruvãna indriyam " ( 1-55-4 ). " vaiávãnarãya matir navyasl suoih soma iva pavate cãrur agnaye " ( 6-8-1 ). • A. C.

Samveéane tanvas cfirur edhi priyo devSnSm parame jan i tre 11 ( 10-56-1 ). Agni is both Bhadrä and Cäru' The object is delightful, pleasing and dear: " Bhadrä te agne svanlka sarndrg ghorasya sato visunasya cäruh " ( 4-6-6 ). The seers speak of pleasant Beauty ( Sriyam Cárům ): " Adhi sriyam ni dadhuè cãrum asmin divo yad aksl amrtã akrnvan " ( 1-72-10 ). This represents the synthesis of the sublime and the comic which is the definition of the Beautiful. ( xx: ) When we observe that the flowing drops of Soma are beautiful like serpents, we lose the serene atmoshere of Beauty. 14 iksneyä atyä so na cãravo brahma brahma ye jujusur havir havih " ( 9-77-3 ) Here we enter the sphere of Beauty as creative aad active, as all- inclusive and expansive, as unity and diversity. It is the dialectic of Beauty. The being of Beauty is the Sublime. It has Becoming in its negation, the dissociation of content from the form. The Being and the Becoming have their final synthesis in Beauty. The nonsen8Uous Idea or the Real unites with the sensuous fact or medium or expression. When these two steps have Ananyatva then we have Beauty. This all-inclusive system of Beauty is apparent in Indränl who is described as ' Serpentining Beauty '. Lopa- mudrà eclipses all others in Beauty-Lupta M udrà. And Urvaál is as Srlharsa says, 4 uruvaslkrtavisvà ' 1 She harmonises every thing and hence she is Absolute Beauty. We are also told that the Viávedevas change their forms like serpents ( ehimäyäsah ). 8 1 Naisadhîya cari tarn, 5. 1 See 01denberg*8 interesting note on this word in his " Rgveda - Text Kritische und Exegetische Noten</page><page sequence="32">íi¿ Annals d/ tht Bhattáarkár Oritntal Rtstarch instituto " Viváe dévâso asridha ehimãyâso adruhah " ( 1. 3. 9 ). That is there are degrees of Beauty. These degrees are relative to their media, and to their oontexts. (xxii) Nature is Beautiful, and it provides a happy place for the Beauty of the Individual. The woman represents the perfection of Beauty. The Rgvedic poet saw Beauty in the human form. He wanted a Beautiful environment, in order that the Beautiful soul might have a harmonious development. So in the second stage he discovered Nature to be Beautiful. Th6 thesis is the human being. The fingers that kindle the fire and press the Soma juice are sisters, mothars, damsels. Àgni cares for each one like a dame at home ( 1. 66. 3 ), Yet he is the maiden's lover and the matron's lord ( 1. 66. 4 ). Still he is an aotive matron ( I. 79. 1 ). He is 'citro yad abhrãt ' ( 1. 66. 3 ) ' tvesa pratlkã ' ( 1, 66. 4 ), and 'éucibhrãja' ( 1. 79. 1 ). The preparation and the decking of altar is like a dame who dresses herself for her husband : " Ayam yoniê cakrmã yam vayam te jäyeva paty a uáatl suvãsãh " ( 4. 3. 2 ). A blameless dame is dear to her lord : " Anavadyä patijusteva nSrl " ( 1. 73. 3 ). The young maid does not repel her lover : " Na eml varante juvatiiB na áaryâm " ( 10. 178. 3 ). Agni kisses the youthful maiden '• " Re rib y ate yuvatim viápatih san " ( 10. 4. 4 ). The poet invites Indra like a bridegroom thinking of his consort : " Maryo na yosäm abhimauyamänah " ( 4. 20. 5 ). The cows sing in joy to Soma as a woman to ber lover : " Abbi g&amp;To anûsata y osa järam iva priyam " (9. 32. S). The songs are sung to Soma as a lover to his beloved ; " PriySm na jSro abhiglta iadu^ " ( 9. 96. 23 ),</page><page sequence="33">The Rgvtiiß Philosophy of the Beautiful ttj Like a young man with pleasant and fair damsels, Soma is delighted : " yabbib somo modate harsate oa kalyftnlbhir yuvatibhir na m ary ah " ( 10-30-5 ). The women that go to the festive gatherings ard examples of perfect Beautr. The dancers decorated themselves after the fashion of the Dawns. ( 1. 92. 4 )$ that is, they had natural Beauty. The women that go to the festive gathering decorate their Beauty ( 1. 112. 4), so that the iuherent Beauty might be manifest immed- iately. It is evident in these and similar passages that the form of the woman was taken as Ideal Beauty, however much Oldenberg and bin followers might object This perception is no mean achie- vement: for it is here that we find the key to unlock the mystery of Beauty as a manifestation of Reality, to the mystery of Brahman as Ãnanda. The woman's Beauty is partly sensuous and sensuous* ness is the characteristic of finitude. At the same time the Beauty of a woman is spiritual, for as Agastya and Lopimudrä remind us, and as UrvasI declares, marriage means the synthesis of Tapas and Käma. So is Kâlidâsa's Siva 'Naisthika Sundarah' ( 5. 68 X Thus Beauty is spiritual and sensuous. Hence tne Absolute is experienced in the realm of Beauty only mediately; as Àbhinava Gupta declares, it is ' parampirä pr&amp;pta, ' not 'säksät' or as the Advaita Vedänta observes it is'Savikalpaka jñ&amp;na* whioh suggests and leads us to Nirvikalpaka Jñ&amp;na. ( xxiii ) The Vedic seers felt the necessity of a Beautiful Universe for a Beautiful soul. And they accordingly felt the Beauty of Nature, % since Nature is the copula between the Absolute and the finite self. Väyu is preeminently Beautiful. He is not only Beautiful ( daráata ). " v&amp;yav S y&amp;hi darêateme som* aramkrt&amp;h " ( 1. 2. 1 ); but also supreme in that : " Ucathye vapusi yah svariluta " ( 8. 46. 28 ), His beauty is white ( àveta )¡</page><page sequence="34">íift Annals ùf thé Éhâtidarfor Oriental Rèseârch institute "uta é vetam vasudhitim nireke " ( 7. 90. 3 ). 44 Svetah sisakti niyut&amp;m abhiérlii " ( 7. 91. S ). Foremost of all the Gods he is Sucipã : he drinks the Soma juice most harmoniously, or enjoys it as an aesthetic experience. The sun has beauty of his own. The Qolden Savittìr is a oompanion of Usas in Beauty. The Maruts are highly Beautiful. They are lovers of ornaments and they love Rodasi who is their Beloved. Tne Aávins are the Aestheticians. They are lovers, and lovers of Beauty and of Love. They are the incarnation of Romance. Even Rudra and Varuna are said to be Beautiful. Rudra is compared to a youth, while Varuna embraces the nights : 11 Saksapah parisasvaje. " The picture of Usas is the most vividly drawn in Rgveda, and justice has been rendered by Oldenberg1. Usas is the prototype of all Beauty. Her characteristic activity is the exhibition or manifestation of her own Body ( 1. 92. 4. eto ). The dawns are compared to warriors (Dhrsnavah), to dancers (Nrtù ), to the waves of the waters ( apãrn na urmayah ), to the sacrificial posts ( ad h var esu svaravah ), to a group of cows ( gavSm na sargãh ) and the like. Usas is the mother, sister and beloved of the Sun. Her smile is a classic by itself. She is the very incarnation of Beauty. She is Immortality itself. She is the daughter of Heavens, the great gateway to the City of God. She is the mother of the Universe, the profound awakener of Humanity. Humanity is her guest. She dances the magnificent dance of consciousness. She reveals the 4 läsya ' of PârvatI as the classical literature repre- sents ; and PârvatI, we know, is the Sakti. She is, as Kälid&amp;sa understood hör correctly, the concept of Beauty. In the treatment of the Beauty of Nature, the Rgvedic poets offer us " a general impression in which limitless expanse, brilli- ance, tumult, storm, activity, and victory flash and heave helter- skelter; all the separate phenomena of Nature unite to form the picture of a mighty artistically constructed whole8 Here is 1 Eïïpam, 32. 116. Also see his Religion des Veda, p. 23?. • Oldenberg, Rapam, 33, 118,</page><page sequence="35">The Rgvedtc philosophy oj the Beautiful 119 Oldenberg once again contradicting himself. Having refused to accept the vedic theory of Beauty in Man and in Nature, he concludes much against his will that there is a profouud concept of Beauty. The concept of Ihauty in Rgveda is really a 'mighty, artistioally constructed whole It is a coherent system. It is the synthesis of the significant and the characteristic. ( xxiv ) The third stage in the Rgvedio concept of Beauty is the conviction of the seers regarding the Beauty in Fine Ârts, in Poetry. They valued their compositions as profound, delicious, sweetest, sincere, spontaneous and so on1. The fondness for rich adornment has been kept under the strict control of the demands of Aesthetic Beauty. They speak of artistic polish and refinement, but only in the interest of the poetic thought and experience; for poetry is not simple carving out or fabricating ( taks ) a song. It is giving birth ( jan ) to a poem. More appro« priately poetry is a creation ( řrj- ). At the same time it is under the stress of divine inspiration, in the spirit of Beauty that the seers compose9. To use Arnold's lines, the Rgvedio seers took Poetry to be a critioism of life fixed under the laws of Poetic Truth and Poetic Beauty. The words of the poet have a splendour ( Dyuti ) : " Dadhfimi te dyumatim väcam ftsan " ( 10-98-2 ) '• " Asme dhehi dyumatim v ficam Ssan " ( 10-98-3 ) '• They are variegted ( citrát ), pure ( suci ), and lustrous ( áukra ). A well understood word is to them what a well dressed beloved is to her husband ' : " uto tvasmai tanvam vi sasre Jâyeva patya uéatl suvfisãh " ( 10-71-4 ). The words are, therefore, Jyotiragrfth : " Tisro väcah pra vada jyotir agrfi yã etad duhre madhudogham üdhah" ( 7-101-1 ). They ate even Jyotlmsi : 1 8ee Proceedings AIOC ( Benaras Session ) * SeeQJMS.</page><page sequence="36">120 Annals oj the BbanJarkar Oriental Research institute " Pra hotre pûrvyam vacognaye bhar&amp;tá bjrhat Vipâm jyotlmsi bibbrate na vedhase " ( 3-10-5 ). The bidden thoughts spontaneously advance and shine in efful- gence : " GuhS satlrupa tmanft pra yac chooanta dhltayah Kanvã rtasya dhãrayã " ( 8-6-8 ). And thought comprehends everything *• " Tuviéusma tuvikrato Saclvo vlêvayã mate ft paprfttha mahitvanft " ( 8-68-2 ) Another poet observes : " kratuyanti kratavo brtsu dbltayo venanti ven&amp;h patay anty &amp; diéah na marditã vidyate anya ebhyo devesu me adhi kãmft ayansata " ( 10. 64. 2 ). " The will and thoughts within my breast exert this power, yearn with love and fly to all the regions round. None other comforter ig found save only these ; my desires are fixed upon the gods. " The poet utters wise secret speeches, and charming words of wisdom •* " Tvam cinnah áamyft agne asyft rtasya bodhy rfcaoit sv&amp;dhih Kadâ ta uktbft sadhamSdyäni Kadft bhavanti eakhyä grhe te " (4. 3. i ). He longs for advancement in wisdom ( 1. 138. 2 ). He speaks out his thought. This poetic thought is decked with Beauty - (Višva- peáesam dhiyam ) : " Evft te hari yojanft suvrkt Indra brahm&amp;ni gotam&amp;so akran Esu viàva peáamam dhiyam dhsh prâtar maksû dhiySvasur jagamyät " ( 1. 61. 16 ). This decorative thought is éueipeáasam or ornamented because of its purity, because of its Spiritual Nature :</page><page sequence="37">The Rgvedtc philosophy of the Beautiful I at " Eti pra bota vratam asya mãjlay- ordhvãm dadhãnah áucipeáam dbiyam •' ( 1, 144, 1 ). It is also Sukravarnam .• " Indhãno akro vidathesu dldayac chukravarnâm uduno y ansate dbiyam " ( 1. 143. 7 )• And the words that translate this thought in terms of Beauty are 4 pãvaka varnãli sucayah, ' : " Imã u tvã purüvaso giro vardhantu yã mama pãvakavarnãh šuoayo vipašcito abhi stomair anösata " ( 8. 3. 3 ). Thus the ßgvedic seer first beheld Beauty in Nature and in Himself. The Human Being is Beautiful, and therefore, requires a Beautiful environment. He realised that the epiiitual force exists behind and over and above Man and Nature, and that it is Beauty. The poetic songs are necessarily Beautiful since they are the result of divine inspiration. But the poetic experience cannot give us an immediate experience of Beauty, for it can only suggest. So the Rgvedic seer realised that the Poetic thought is Beautiful. In the last stage he realised that the highest representation of Beauty is Speechless Thought, while Poetry comes only next. By Speechless Thought he only meant that Thought or Reality is beyond the finite speech. Boauty speaks no language, no emotion. It is one of the highest experi- ences conducive to higher immediacy. Beauty is suggestive. Beauty alone can dispel 4 Nlhãra ' or ignorance that envelops the Finite-Infinite Individual because of its power of suggestion. This suggestion leads us to non-spatial and nontemporal experiences. Thus Beauty renders possible the Supra-relational and Supra-rational experience. And according to the Rgvedio seers too, Beauty alone can offer 41 an abiding satisfaction of an abiding self ' " 1 T. H. Green : Prolegomena to Ethic», 16 t Anna's, B. O, R. I. ]</page></plain_text>
