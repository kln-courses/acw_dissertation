<plain_text><page sequence="1">TYRTAEUS AND THE ART OF PROPAGANDA τ dh y Η. James Shey yrtaeus' elegy on arete is familiar to scholars who attempt to reconstruct the history of seventh-century Sparta, but the poem has not attracted the attention it deserves from literary historians and critics.1 Ulrich Schmid's analysis of the poem is limited, since he ap proached the poem as an example of a particular kind of priamel, the "Wertepriamel."2 This formal approach necessarily confined Schmid's investigations, for the most part, to the first nine lines of the poem which contain the priamel. Schmid's analysis leaves one with the unfortunate impression that the poem's artistry is contained in the nine lines of the priamel and that the rest of the poem may be left to the student of Greece's intellectual history.3 More recently, Bruno Snell has made a number of shrewd observations on the poem; but he evi dently wrote his monograph as a supplement to his Die Entdeckung des Gëistes (Hamburg 19482), and literary analysis lies outside the scope of his work.4 In what follows, I will examiné afresh how and for what purpose Tyrtaeus has constructed his priamel and especially how the priamel is related to the other thirty-five lines of the poem. I believe the elegy is paraenetic from first to last — a masterly piece of special pleading in which art and argument are inseparable.5 To understand the elegy on arete, we ought first review the nature of Tyrtaeus' poetry and recall the special set of circumstances which prompted him to write it. The Suda records that Tyrtaeus wrote five books of poems and classifies them as follows: 1) a poem called The Constitution, 2)exhortations in elegiac couplets, and 3) war songs. Of this considerable production only 150 lines (citations in ancient writers) and a tattered papyrus have survived. Few though they are, the fragments are historical documents of major importance.6 Mainly on Tyrtaeus' authority, we know that the Spartans fought and conquered the Messenians in a nineteen-year war under the leadership of Theo pompus sometime between 736 and 706 B.C. and that the Messenians were reduced to serfdom. Two generations later, sometime between the sixties and thirties of the next century (the Suda puts Tyrtaeus' floruit date at 640-637 B.C.), the oppressed Messenians revolted (frs. 4 and 5). It was during this second Messenian war that Tyrtaeus H. James Shey Arethusa Vol. 9 (1976) 1.</page><page sequence="2">H. James S hey composed his poems. The war songs were much admired in antiquity (Athenaeus, 14.630e), but have not survived. Two short fragments (2 and 3) declare the heroic origin of the Spartans (descendants of the Heraclids) and the divine origin of their constitution (a Delphic oracle). These may belong to the first poem mentioned by the Suda. The bulk of Tyrtaeus' extant work belongs to the second class of poems, the elegiac poems of exhortation which were written apparently when the Spartans were being hard pressed by the rebels. Fr. 1, the mutilated papyrus, may describe an actual battle. Frs. 6/7, 8, and 9 are now generally considered to be complete poems. Fr. 6/7, thirty-two lines, describes the misery of the exiled coward and urges young men to fight bravely in the front lines. Fr. 8, thirty-eight lines, was evidently written after a Spartan defeat: it reassures the Spartans by reminding them that they are the sons of Heracles and that Zeus is still on their side; there is a call to renewed courage and again a description of the coward's suffering; the poem ends with specific advice on hand-to hand fighting. Finally, the poem under discussion here probes the nature of arete and says that aretè is what makes a man brave in battle. For purposes of this analysis the structure of the poem may be considered quadripartite and its contents summarized as follows: 1. Lines 1-9. Tyrtaeus rejects a series of aretai in favor of θοϋρις άλκή (fierce fighting spirit). These lines, all one sen tence, constitute the "Wertepriamel." 2. Lines 10-22. Tyrtaeus explains his preference: άλκή is the areté most useful in war. The man who has this arete protects the whole community (Ξυνον δ' έσθλον τοϋτο ττόληι τε παντι' τε δήμω line 15) as well as himself. The lines also present a vivid description of a warrior in battle. 3. Lines 23-34. If a man dies fighting courageously in battle, he is mourned by the whole community; his name and that of his descendants will be honored. And finally he will win a kind of immortality. 4. Lines 35-43. But if a good warrior survives the battle and is victorious, he wins τιμή (usually translated as "honor," but see below).</page><page sequence="3">Tyrtaeus and the Art of Propaganda " Coda 43-44. An oblique exhortation (third person imperative) to strive for the perfection of this arete, i.e., άλκή. This analysis of the poem's structure articulates four carefully con trolled stages in Tyrtaeus' argument, which moves from negation to affirmation.7 Section one rejects the aretai which may compete with the aretë of άλκή. Section two extols the benefits which derive from dis play of courage in battle. Section three describes the "benefits" for the warrior who dies bravely. Section four enumerates the time which comes to the victorious warrior for the rest of his life. Section three has an obvious negative aspect (i.e., the death of the warrior) which is effectively muted, and in addition the whole section is firmly buttres sed by sections two and four, which defined the positive achievements of the brave warrior as a young man (line 14) and the rewards for the victorious survivor, especially in his later life. The opening lines of the priamel are emphatic, as if Tyrtaeus were replying to some assertions which had just been made concerning what is to be valued in a man (1-4): out' Sv μνησαι'μηυ out' iv λόγω ανδρα τιθει'μην οΰτε ποδών άρετής οΰτε παλαιμοσύνης, οΰδ' ει' Κυκλώπων μεν εχοι με'γεθος τε βιην τε, νικωη δε Θε'ων Θρηικιον βορεην .... In these hrst tour lines lyrtaeus shifts rhetorical gears three times. The first two lines are emphatically negative (anaphora of οΰτε four times), but prosaic. In the third line, he changes construction and uses the negative concessive clause which implies that his conclusion must be true even in the extreme case which the words οΰδ ' ει' intro duce: Tyrtaeus would not value the wrestler, not even if he were the equal of the Cyclopes in respect of size and strength. In line four, Tyrtaeus is even more emphatic and hyperbolic. Boreas, like the Cyclopes, represents an absolute in the physical universe, a con stant like the speed of light in modern astrophysics. By asking his readers to imagine a runner who is faster than Boreas, Tyrtaeus is asking them to contemplate the unimaginable.8 Once he has used the Cyclopes and Boreas as embodiments of the aretai mentioned in line two, he moves forward swiftly and elliptically with a series of mytho logical characters who are famous for the other aretai which he rejects (again note the emphatic anaphora of ουδέ in lines 3,5, 7, 9): Tyrtaeus</page><page sequence="4">H. James Shey would not value a man, even if he were more handsome than Tithonus, more wealthy than Midas and Cinyras, more kingly than Pelops, as eloquent as Adrastus (lines 4-8). The hyperbole of line four is sustained until line seven. With the mention of Adrastus, Tyrtaeus "shifts down" or lessens the emphasis: he would not value a man if he were the equal of Adrastus in respect of eloquence. But the lessening of empha sis is only temporary and serves to throw into sharp relief the conclu sion of the priamel: Tyrtaeus would not value a man, even if he had the reputation for every kind of areté except a fierce fighting spirit (ούδ' ει πδσαν εχοι δόξαν πλην θούριδος άλκής, line 9). The aretai which are rejected in the priamel may be arranged in a hierarchy according to merit or value. The archaic mentality may have considered all the "goods" or aretai of the priamel gifts from the gods, like physical strength and beauty,9 but all gifts are not of equal value and the value of some may be enhanced for the individual who possesses them, if by his own efforts he manages to increase his areté. For ex ample, the areté of size and strength may be perfected by exercise and discipline. Midas' gift of the golden touch is god-given, but in the real world the ability to acquire money implies a number of acquired skills like decisiveness, good judgment, and diligence. The same is true of the areté of acquiring political power. Certainly the myths detailing Pelops' early career show how a man may scheme and plan his way to power. The areté ofeloquence implies intellectual superiority in general. Even the powerful king must rely on the advice of his counsellors.10 The priamel reaches a climax when Tyrtaeus ranks the areté of άλκή highest in a hierarchy which is all-encompassing (ούδ1 ει' πδσαν εχοι δόξαν, line 9). The last two lines of the poem (quoted below) indicate clearly that Tyrtaeus believes that this is an areté which can be ac quired and indeed it is the purpose of his poem to help a man acquire it. The second section of the poem (lines 10-22) provides Tyrtaeus' reason for subordinating every conceivable areté to Θοϋρις άλκή (see summary of the poem above). Tyrtaeus replaces the Homeric ideal of the single hero fighting for his own glory by that of the patriotic war rior — a significant step forward in the development of Greek civiliza tion which Jaeger has described as the "der Politisierung des Heldenideals."11 But the aretai Tyrtaeus asks his countrymen to con sider less important than a fighting spirit are naturally very desirable. Tyrtaeus' main task is not to prove a proposition, but to win his audience's emotional acceptance of something which is naturally</page><page sequence="5">Tyrtaeus and the Art of Propaganda repugnant, i.e., the willingness of the individual to endanger his life so that the community may survive. More precisely, Tyrtaeus' task is to make his audience feel that the rejected aretai are less desirable than they really are or may seem to be.12 He accomplishes this in part by his careful selection of mythological exemplars in which the re jected aretai are embodied. In every instance, the mythological characters of the priamel possess aretai which cause harm to themselves or others, or which are unable to save them from harm, unhappiness, or bad reputation.13 Although Tyrtaeus refers to the Cyclopes as a group, one inevitably thinks of Homer's description of Polyphemus in the Odyssey. His size and strength are awesome, but the use to which he puts these gifts are barbarous. Without provocation, he seizes two of Odysseus' men on three separate occasions and kills them with the ease of a man killing young pups (Od. 9.289-290,311,344). The description of his canni balistic and drunken feasting is worthy of Euripides. But his arete cannot prevent Odysseus from outwitting and blinding him. At the end of Od. 9, he is a pathetic figure as he hurls boulders at the boasting and taunting Odysseus. The myth displays Polyphemus' great strength as lawless, revolting, and ultimately ineffectual. The most important myth concerning Boreas tells how he used his great speed to abduct the Athenian maiden Oreithyia (Ovid, Meta. 6.682-722). Boreas, who was tentatively anthropomorphic (in art sometimes represented with snake tails in place of feet), is identified as Thracian by Tyrtaeus. To ancient writers, Thrace was synonymous with barbarism and savagery, and myths connected with that place tend to include barbarous episodes (cf. the myths connected with Lycurgus, Diomedes, Polymestor, Tereus et al.). Ovid's account of the abduction of Oreithyia catches the natural savagery of Boreas' character. Tithonus' great beauty won him im mortality, but also the curse of extreme old age. According to an early version (Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite, 5.218ff.), Eos lost interest in Tithonus as he grew older; and finally, when he became so infirm that he could not move, she put him alone in a room secured with brazen doors, so that she would not have to listen to his mindless and eternal babbling. One myth concerning Midas is similar to the one about Tithonus, in that both were given gifts which became a curse. Midas' gift was the golden touch, but even the food and drink he touched turned to gold, so that he began to starve. The other important myth about Midas</page><page sequence="6">10 H. James Shey portrays him again as a foolish and ridiculous figure, whose faulty judgment of Apollo's musical ability earned him the ears of an ass (Ovid, M eta. 11.90-193). Cinyras, who is linked with Midas as a con spicuous example of one who has great wealth, appears in several unfortunate tales. One tells of his incestuous relationship with his daughter Myrrha or Smyrna (Ovid, Meta. 10.298ff.). Aphrodite caused her to fall in love with her father and she conceived Adonis by him when he was drunk. When Cinyras learned what had happened he killed himself. Another myth connects Cinyras with the Trojan War. Homer (Iliad 11.19-28) identifies him as a Cypriot who sent Agamemnon a magnificent breastplate, but, as there is no further mention of him, he evidently did not participate in the war. Another tradition says that Cinyras had promised to send fifty ships on the expedition to Troy. The flagship, commanded by Cinyras' son, was followed to sea by forty-nine toy clay ships and manned by toy clay sailors. The toy ships quickly dissolved and sank. It is clear what Tyrtaeus would have had to say about Cinyras' fighting spirit.14 As for Pelops, his identification as the son of Tantalus calls to mind the famous myth of Tantalus' hubristic act of dismembering Pelops and serving the pieces at a banquet of the gods. Pelops was reconstituted but Tantalus was consigned to eternal punishment in the underworld (Pindar, 01. 1.37-65 with scholia to 37; Homer, 0d. 11.582 592). The myths which tell of Pelops' rise to power are well known. They are filled with examples of his cruel, cynical, and murderous deeds. One murder, that of Myrtilus, brought a curse upon Pelops' descendants which could not be purified (Apollodorus, Ε pit. 2.8; Soph., Electra 508ff.). All of Pelops' acts of atonement were to no avail. The curse fell on his descendants to the third generation. Pelops' rise to power, then, was tainted by many acts which are in themselves repellent and disastrous in their consequences. The final mythological character mentioned in the priamel is Adrastus. Many commentators have puzzled over Tyrtaeus' selection of him as a type of eloquence. The usual exemplars are Odysseus and especially Nestor. Adrastus is not singled out as a great orator again until he is mentioned by Plato in the Phaedrus, 269a (and nowhere afterwards, as far as I can discover), where he is linked by Socrates with Pericles: τον μελι'γηρυν "Αδραστον ... η και Περικλε'α (cf. Tyrtaeus' words : γλώσσαν δ' 'Αδράστου μειλιχόγηρυυ εχοι, 8). Commentators conjecture that Tyrtaeus was thinking of Adrastus' role in the lost</page><page sequence="7">Tyrtaeus and the Art of Propaganda 11 cyclic epic Thebais, where he was portrayed as an eloquent speaker. There is solid evidence in Pindar that the Thebais gave Adrastus an eloquent funeral oration to speak over the Argives slain in the futile attempt to take Thebes.15 Speaking of the lost Amphiaraus, Adrastus says, "Ποθε'ω/στρατιδς όφθαλμόν έμας/άμφότερον μάντιυ τ' αγαθόν κα! δουρϊ μάρνασθαι" (01. 6.16-18). Since Adrastus was king of Argos and leader of the expedition, it is legitimate to suppose that the Thebais provided him also with ample opportunity to display his eloquence when the decision to attack Thebes was made. Snell conjectures (reference in note 13) that Tyrtaeus knew of a version in which Adrastus used honeyed words to persuade his sister Eriphyle to accept the bribe of Harmonia's necklace and decide in favor of the expedition. To Snell's suggestion I would add and stress the following detail in the myth: Adrastus presses for the expedition even though the seer Amphiaraus foretells certain defeat. Adrastus' irrational action is exposed and treated with withering scorn by Theseus in Euripides' Suppliants. After the defeat, Adrastus came to Athens with the mothers and children of the slain Argives to ask Theseus to help them to retrieve the dead and give them proper burial. In the first episode, Adrastus admits that he undertook the expedition against the warnings of Amphiaraus (θη. ουκ ήλθες, οος εόικεν, εύνοια θεών. Άδ. τό δε πλε'ον, ήλθον Άμφιαρε'ω γε πρός βι'αν, 157-158). This admission leads Theseus to speculate on the benefits man derives from the right use of reason and on the misfortunes resulting from its misuse. The speech ends with Theseus denouncing Adrastus for ignoring the warnings of the gods and for leading his people to destruction (229-31): ές 5έ στρατεκχν πάντας Άργει'ους άγων, μάντεων λεγόντων θεσφατ',είτ' άτιμάσας βία παρελθών θεούς άπώλεσας πόλιν . . . Athenian dramatists are no reliable guide for reconstructing the lost Thebais,16 but every version of Theban legend indicates that the Argive expedition was undertaken in opposition to the prophet Amphiaraus. I suggest that Tyrtaeus chose Adrastus as the embodiment of eloquence because the lost Thebais portrayed him using his powers of persuasion to lead his army to certain ruin. This interpretation is supported first by the "movement" by Tyrtaeus' priamel. As argued above, all the other mythological characters were selected because there was some thing repellent about them or the use to which they put their aretai.</page><page sequence="8">12 H. James Shey What Tyrtaeus needs in his priamel is someone whose eloquence is irresponsible and ruinous. Further support for this interpretation may be found in the passage from the Phaedrus quoted above, where Adrastus and Pericles are linked as men of great eloquence. To understand this passage, it is necessary to recall an earlier part of the dialogue where Socrates has just given a definition of rhetoric which is too broad for Phaedrus to accept. In mock amazement, Socrates asks Phaedrus if he is not acquainted with the rhetorical manuals written by Nestor, Odys seus, and Palamedes during their leisure hours at Troy. Phaedrus re plies that he is not, unless Socrates really means Gorgias and Thrasymachus, or perhaps Theodorus, when he speaks of Nestor and Odysseus (261a-c). Socrates and Phaedrus are playing a kind of guess ing game, called είκασι'αι 'comparisons.'17 Phaedrus quickly identifies the contemporary orators who can be compared with Nestor and Odys seus apparently to Socrates' satisfaction. A few lines later Socrates resumes the game by referring to Palamedes, but forestalls any attempt by Phaedrus to answer by supplying the answer himself: τον ... Έλεα τικον ΓΤαλαμήδην (261d). By identifying Palamedes as "Eleatic," he gives the game away - he is speaking of Zeno of Elea. Socrates in troduced the game in the first place because he knows what child like delight Phaedrus takes in his knowledge of mythology.1® Socrates continues the game for the same reason, but "short-circuits" Phaedrus' part in the game, perhaps because he is having a little wicked fun, teasing him with the prospect of a game which amuses him and then dashing his expectation. To return to the passage where Adrastus is linked with Pericles, it is obvious that Socrates is resuming the guessing game and that Adrastus represents some contemporary orator. All commentators have assumed that the disjunctive η και' excludes the alternative (cf. the Latin aut) and tentatively identify Adrastus as Antiphon.19 But η και' may be used like the Latin sive and I see no reason why Adrastus should not be identified with Pericles.20 As in the case of the refer ence to Palamedes, Socrates gratifies Phaedrus' fancy for mythology, but gives the game away before he has time to answer. We may trans late the phrase "the 'eloquent Adrastus' or Pericles if you will," meaning that Pericles is Adrastus' contemporary counterpart. The point of the comparison will become clear, I think, after a review of Plato's attitude towards Pericles.</page><page sequence="9">Tyrtaeus and the Art of Propaganda 13 In the Gorgias, Plato attacks Pericles with unrelenting bitterness. Socrates says that Pericles spoke words which pleased the Athenians, but led them to material and spiritual ruin (515e ff.). Pericles may be said to have been a good servant (διάκονος) to the people since he gave them what they wanted (ships, wall, etc.), but he was not a good states man. The aim of the statesman is θεραπεία, not διακονία. That is, he will give the people, not what they want, but what is good for them. Plato condemned Pericles especially, but sharply criticized three other great leaders of that age - Cimon, Themistocles, and Miltiades. The bitterness of the attack must have shocked readers of the Gorgias and public reaction apparently caused Plato to tone down his criticism of Pericles and the others.21 In the Phaedrus, which was written after the Gorgias, Socrates says that Pericles was the best orator that ever was (269e), but this is not a retraction of the highly critical evaluation of him in the Gorgias, since it was precisely his gift of oratory which permitted Pericles to lead the Athenians to ruin.22 I suggest that Plato equates Pericles and Adrastus for the same reason that Tyrtaeus selected Adrastus as a type of eloquence. Both the legendary King of Argos and Pericles eloquently voiced their imperialistic dreams, and ignoring clear signs of danger, they set their people on a course which led to their destruction. On this interpretation, Adrastus' funeral oration, which the passage in Pindar leads us to posit in the lost Thebais, is susceptible of ironic treatment — Adrastus mouthing plati tudes over the bodies of the men he had led to certain death. I am not saying that the lost epic would have treated the funeral oration ironi cally, but the possibility of ironic treatment was implicit in the myth, as Euripides shows us in the funeral speech he gives Adrastus in the Suppliants (857ff.).23 The parallel with Pericles here is obvious. What Plato thought of Pericles' funeral oratory is known from the parody which he gives Socrates to speak in the Menexenus. The aim of Tyrtaeus' poem is to inspire his audience with a fighting spirit and the first stage of his strategy is to make other competing and attractive values seem less attractive than they are to most men. The nine lines of the priamel, then, are hyperbolic and emphatically negative. The second stage of the argument is positive; it shows what results when a man possesses the areté of a fighting spirit. Apart from explaining the reason why a fighting spirit is the most valuable areté, lines 10-22 are generally given over to a vivid</page><page sequence="10">14 H. James Shey description of Tyrtaeus' ideal warrior. He dares to face the bloody slaughter and he moves in close for hand-to-hand combat (11-12). A man who can do this has true arete·. "Ηδ' άρετή, τόδ' αεθλον èv άνθρώ ττοισιν άριστον/ κάλλιστόν τε φε'ρειν γι'γνεται άνδρι υε'ω (13-14). The τόδ' αεθλον belongs to language of athletics and brings to mind the first two couplets of the poem in which the athlete's prowess in re jected. This is the first clue to Tyrtaeus' intentions for the rest of the poem. He will now emphasize the many goods which come to the brave warrior and he will do so in a way which suggests that the man who displays courage on behalf of the city will come to possess in some way all the aretai rejected in the priamel — not indeed to the degree in which the various mythological characters of the priamel possess them, but to a degree and in a manner possible for a man living in the real (i.e., as opposed to the mythic) world of seventh-century Sparta. This interpretation may seem contrived or too ingenious but the idea that courage is the foundation of all other aretai and somehow implies all other aretai is concisely put in Plautus' Amphitruo. Alcumena, of her husband's virtus (i.e., fighting spirit) says (648-53): virtus praemium est optimum;/ virtus omnibus rebus anteit profecto:/ libertas, salus, vita, res et parentes, patria et prognati/ tutantur, servantur:/ virtus omnia in sese habet, omnia adsunt/ bona quem penest virtus." Tyrtaeus is not anticipating anything so sophisticated as the Socratic doctrine of the unity of virtue proposed, e.g., in the Protagoras (just as Plautus is not reflecting any philosophical position). He is merely insinuating that, should his warrior subordinate desirable personal goods to the common good and strive for άλκή, the aretai of the priamel (rejected not in themselves, but in the fabulous exemplars which em body them) may naturally accrue to him to a limited degree. This is simply legerdemain, clever propaganda. Tyrtaeus' argument, then, is that the good warrior will display in battle all those qualities which characterize the good athlete - size, strength, quickness, competitive spirit, endurance.25 The warrior plants his feet and does not give ground (διαβας εν προμάχοισι με'νη / νωλεμε'ως, 16-17), language which might readily be applied to a wrestler since the object of one kind of wrestling (καταβλητική) was simply to throw the opponent to the ground.26 Tyrtaeus emphasizes that his warrior is to use his physical skill in cooperation with his comrades (19). In this</page><page sequence="11">Tyrtaeus and the Art of Propaganda 15 regard, he stands in contrast with Polyphemus, who lives alone and apart from the other Cyclopes. They come in answer to his distress call, but their help comes too late. Tyrtaeus' warrior never considers retreat: αισχρής δε φυγής έπί ττάγχυ λάθηται (17). Boreas is an obvious foil; he used his great speed to flee with the abducted Oreithyia — a shameful and barbaric act in the context of Tyrtaeus poem, whose general aim is to extoll the importance of preserving the polis with all its institutions, including that of marriage (see lines 19, 2&amp;-30, 34, where the warrior's family are mentioned). But Tyrtaeus' warrior must also have speed in order to seize the initiative in battle: Αϊψα δε δυσμενε'ων άνδρών έτρεψε φάλαγγας / τρηχει'ας (21-22). The next phrase in line 21 contains a metaphor which seems to be Tyrtaeus' invention — σπουδή δ' εσχεθε κϋμα μάχης. Again this is language taken from athletics. There were no swimming competitions, but swimming was a universal means of conditioning and the most elementary. To say that someone did not know how to swim was a way of saying he was a dimwit (Plato, Leg. 3.689d). Swimming had important military uses, one of the most celebrated recorded illustrations being the Spartan rescue operation at Sphacteria during the Peloponnesian War (Thuc. 4.26).27 And Tyrtaeus' warrior is eloquent: Θαρσύνη δ' επεσιν τον πλησι'ον ανδρα παρεστώς (19). The simple but effective eloquence of the Spartan warrior en couraging his comrades in the heat of battle contributes to victory, this in very pointed contrast to the eloquence of Adrastus, who urges his men to certain defeat. The third section of the poem describes the honor which comes to the warrior who dies bravely in battle on behalf of his city. When he falls, he brings glory not only to himself and family, but also to the community as awhole and to each ofits citizens: Αυτός δ' έν προμάχοισι πεσών φι'λον ώλεσε θυμόν / άστυ τε και λαούς κα! πατε'ρ' εύκλεί'σας (23 24). The dead warrior is accordingly mourned by everyone: Τον δ' όλοφύρονται μεν όμως νε'οι ήδέ γε'ροντες / άργαλεω τε πάθω πάσα κε'κηδε πόλις (27-28). If the phrase "both young and old" is formulaic for "everybody," the lines are repetitious.28 But here, I think, the νε'οι are the fallen warrior's comrades andthe γε'ροντες members of the august Gerousia, the body responsible for all decisions relating to the conduct of the war. In line 28, πόλις comes at the end of the verse and is emphatic. In these two lines Tyrtaeus is stressing that the mourning for the fallen warrior is official. At the same time he uses language</page><page sequence="12">16 H. James Shey which is expressive of deep personal grief.29 The mourning may be official, but it is not perfunctory. Finally the dead warrior wins imperishable glory for himself and his descendants, and thereby wins a kind of immortality (29-34): καΐ τύμβος και παϊδες iv άυθρώποισ' άρι'σημοι και παι'δων παΓδες καΐ γε'νος έξοττίσω. ούδε ποτε κλε'ος έσθλον άπόλλυται οΰδ ' δνομ' αύτοϋ, άλλ' ϋπο γης ττερ &amp;ν γι'γνεται άθάνατος, δντιν' άριστεύοντα με'νοντά τε μαρνάμενόν τε γης πε'ρι και παι'δων θοϋρος "Αρης"ολε'ση. The notion that the dead warrior brings glory upon all his descendants is in very pointed contrast with the fate of Pelops' descendants. Even more pointed is the careful way in which Tyrtaeus describes the kind of immortality he may expect. No man ought to expect to live forever as Tithonus' grotesque fate warns. Although a brave man dies a physi cal death (υπό γης περ έων), he wins the only kind of immortality possible in the real world. Section three is Tyrtaeus' attempt to supply motivation for the warrior, even if he should lose his life in battle. But death for the individual is clearly a kakon and this section is the weakest link, or negative aspect, in Tyrtaeus' argument.30 In Homeric society, the hero or the aner agathos had "built-in" motivation. He was the leader and defender of his own oîkos, a virtually autonomous group. When the Homeric warrior fought, he always fought in his own interest. Tyrtaeus is trying to transmute the Homeric ideal of the agathos into an ideal for every member of the polis. In effect, this section offers the simple Spartan warrior a chance to the same kind of immortality as the Homeric hero. In the fourth and final section, Tyrtaeus concludes his argument on a strongly positive note. Every warrior would naturally hope to escape death, and in another poem Tyrtaeus argues that the brave man has in fact a better chance of surviving (fr. 8.11 ff.). On this assumption, section four is the most important stage in Tyrtaeus' argument. The first reward for the victorious warrior is obviously the im mediate exultation in winning in a competition with the highest possible stakes: νικήσας δ' αιχμής άγλαόν εϋχος έλη (36). Secondly he is accorded time by everyone (37-42). πάντες μιν τιμώσιν όμως νε'οι ήδέ παλαιοί', πολλά 6έ τερπνά παθών έρχεται ει'ς Άιδην,</page><page sequence="13">Tyrtaeus and the Art of Propaganda 17 γηράσκων δ' άστοΓσι μεταπρε'πει, ού δε' τις αύτον βλάπτειν out' αίδοϋς οΰτε δίκης έθελει, πάντες δ' έν θώκοισιν όμως νε'οι οί'τε κατ' αυτόν εί'κουσ' έκ χώρης οί'τε παλαιότεροι. A number of scholars consider these lines repetitious or disjointed and have argued that some of the lines should either be deleted or trans posed. Most recently, B. A. van Groningen has argued that a conflation of two shorter versions of the Tyrtaeus passage accounts for the repetitions. Van Groningen summarizes the lines as follows: (1) Young and old honor him; (2) before the victorious warrior dies he enjoys a pleasant life; (3) in old age, he is preeminent over all and no one wishes to deprive him of aidos and dike', (4) everyone - the young, con temporaries, the older - gives place to him at public gatherings. Of the lines van Groningen says, "Tout ceci est étrange: la mention de la vieillesse vient après celle de la mort; où δε τις... έθε'λει ne fait que répéter τιμώσι; όμως νε'οι... παλαιότεροι reprend, en partie littérale ment, όμως νε'οι ήδέ παλαιοί'." Van Groningen thinks the repetitions show that there was one version consisting of lines 35-38 and a second consisting of lines 35-36 followed by 3&amp;-42.31 The problems which modern readers see in these final lines of Tyrtaeus' poem stem largely from their neglect of the full meaning of the verb τιμώσι in line 37. To translate it by 'honor' is almost always to be misleading. Adkins defines a man's time as his position on that scale at whose top are the immortal gods, at the bottom the homeless beggar. To timan a man is to move him further from, to atiman him to bring him closer to the homeless and the helpless, the man who is nothing. And time as a result commends and denotes all that dif ferentiates the way of life of a prosperous chieftain from that of a wandering beggar - property, status, prestige, rights ... .32 For the Greek, words of praise seem to have had very little to do with time. A man fought to defend, recover, or increase his time in the full sense of the word. He fights, therefore, for everything that makes survival possible in a hostile and competitive world. In fr. 6 / 7 (lines 3-10) Tyrtaeus describes vividly what it means to deprive a man of his time: την δ' αύτοΰ προλιπόντα πάλιν και πι'ονας άγρούς</page><page sequence="14">18 H. James Shey πτωχευειν πάντων εστ ' άνιηροτατον, πλοζόμενον συν μητρί φΐ'λ-Γ| κα! ποττρί γε'ροντι παισί τε συν μικρο"ΐς κούριδί^ τ1 άλόχω. ε'χθρος μεν γαρ τοΐσι μετε'σσεται, ους κεν Γκηται χρησμοσύν-g τ' εί'κων κα! στυγερ-g πενι'η, αίσχύνει τε γένος, κατά δ' άγλαον είδος ε'λε'γχει, πδσα δ' άτιμιη κα! κακότης έπεται.53 Adkins' discussion is based on the Homeric texts, but the values of Tyrtaeus' world are not far removed from those of Homer's, the only difference being that the Spartan warrior must see his time as inextri cably bound up with the fortunes of the polis. I see no needless repeti tions, therefore, in these last lines of the poem. Line 37 states a general proposition: everyone (yes, the "young and old" is simply formulaic here) will increase his time. The lines which follow elaborate and specify what sort of time the victorious warrior may expect. Tyrtaeus must be specific, since the aretè of the warrior is exercised on behalf of the polis and he will receive time which is consonant with the function and goals of the polis (as opposed, say, to the time offered to Achilles to return to the war). The victorious warrior will first enjoy πολλά ... τερπνά, personal pleasures and material goods. The phrase is deliberately vague be cause the warrior may expect only those material goods which can be offered by economically depressed Sparta in the seventh century — not the fabulous and unrealistic wealth which the priamel rejects in the persons of Midas and Cinyras. The phrase έρχεται εις Άι'δην has a special point because it stresses the essential fact that for the Greek time must be continuous. Time is not a transitory gesture of respect, but must include such necessary items as shelter, food, etc. As the victorious warrior grows old, he stands out among the astoi. I read δ' after γηράσκω v. It is omitted by Diehl and many other editors on the ground that lines 39-42 explain πολλά δε... παθών in line 38 (the epexegetic use of asyndeton). With one exception, all the MSS of Stobaeus (the source for this poem) have δ', and I think line 38 and those which follow are equally subordinated to the τιμώσι in line 37. Each new point elaborating this verb is marked by a continu ative δε'. Lines 38 and 39 add two new and related notions involved in the complex notion of time, that of status. Here the status is of a</page><page sequence="15">Tyrtaeus and the Art of Propaganda 19 particular sort - political status, as Prato (note ad loc.) argues: "se 1' ammissione alia Gerousia era presso gli Spartiani 'il preraio della virtu' (αθλον της αρετής Aristot. Pol. II 1270 b 22, νικητήριου της αρετής Plut. Lyc. XXVI 2), non v'e dubbio che essa dovessa spettare all'uorao valoroso che ... aveva offerto la sua vita per salvezza della sua citta."34 The Gerousia was a very powerful and elite group of twenty-eight. A man became elegible for office at sixty years of age (giving special point to γηράσκων, in opposition to van Groningen) and was selected by popular acclaim. A war hero would naturally be a popular figure and, Tyrtaeus suggests, may hope for election to this important office. The άστοΐσι would then refer to the war hero's col leagues in the Gerousia. In this context, the clause où δε' τις αυτόν/ βλάτττειν αυτέ αιδοϋς οΰτε δι'κης ε'θε'λει has a limited meaning and is not equivalent to τιμώσι, as van Groningen maintains. The clause means that no one can (έθε'λω with a negative virtually = δύυαμαι [LSJ, s.v., 1.2]) deprive anyone elected to the Gerousia of the rights and privi leges of that office, since at this time it was a "tenured" or life time appointment. finally, at public gatherings (εν Οωκοισιν) he is accorded the place of honor (εί'κουσ' Ικ χώρης) by everyone. It was customary for Spartan youths to step aside and give up their seats for their elders (Herod. 2.80.1), but this mark of respect is accorded Tyrtaeus' warrior even by his contemporaries and those who are older, giving precise meaning to the formulaic "young and old," to which van Groningen objects.35 The iv θώκοισιν is, I suppose, deliberately vague. It could refer to the Gerousia in council, but it could also refer to any public gathering. Wherever the warrior goes and whatever the occasion he is treated with respect and deference by all. These, then, are the benefits which the victorious warrior may win for himself. Implicit throughout this section is the more general and important idea that the warrior's display of valor in battle as a young man (line 14, quoted above) has results which benefit him for the rest of his life and are irreversible, this in contrast with the various mythological characters of the priamel whose aretai either brought un happiness or could not prevent it. After Tyrtaeus' carefully orchestrated argument, the final two lines of the poem carry tremendous impact: τούτης νΰν τις άνηρ άρετής είς άκρον ΐκε'σθαι πειράσθω θυμω μή μεθιείς ττολε'μου.</page><page sequence="16">20 H. James Shey Apart from Schmid's high praise of the first nine lines of this poem (see note 3) and Verdenius' favorable evaluation of fr. 6/7 (see note 33) critics have regarded Tyrtaeus' work as little more than versified historical documents.36 I think, however, that Tyrtaeus de serves a much more honored place in Greece's literary history. From a purely technical point of view, Tyrtaeus was an important innovator, as K. J. Dover has shown:37 Tyrtaeus did not inherit a tradition of hortatory elegiacs; he took one element out of many which existed in Ionian poetry, and by exploiting its possibilities created a new genre. There was nothing inevitable about this; had there been no Tyrtaeus, another individual might have developed a different element of Ionian poetry in quite another direc tion. As for the artistic merits of his work, if we knew nothing else about Tyrtaeus' craftsmanship other than what we see in the elegy on areté, I think he would have to be considered a major talent. And a large body of ancient testimony to the worth of his art lends support to this judgment. Jaeger has shown that his work has influenced Xeno phanes, Solon, Theognis, and that Tyrtaeus was well known and admired in fifth- and fourth-century Athens by Gorgias, Lysias, Isocrates, Hyperides, and Lycurgus.3' Plato quotes and paraphrases the elegy on arete, calling Tyrtaeus "ποιητα θειότοττε" (Leg. 1.629bff.) and later in the dialogue (9.858e) linking Tyrtaeus with Homer in a general condemnation of poetry.39 According to Dodds' axiom, to be called a poet by Plato was no compliment, but to be linked with Homer, even in condemnation, was. Wilamowitz has argued that after the third century, Tyrtaeus' work was all but lost, known only from snippets preserved in anthologies, such as that of Stobaeus.40 It is true, as he says, that little notice is taken of Tyrtaeus, but two fleeting references to his work, one in Horace and the other in Quintilian, lead me to think that he had considerable influence in Rome and that a considerable amount of his work must have survived into the Christian era. Horace knew enough of his work, at any rate, to be able to rank him with Homer: insignis Homerus/ Tyrtaeusque mares animos in Martia bella/ versibus exacuit (Α.Ρ. 401-403). It seems to me very unlikely that Horace would have said such a thing, if Tyrtaeus were known to him only by reputa tion or even from the few fragments which have been preserved in</page><page sequence="17">Tyrtaeus and the Art of Propaganda 21 anthologies. The reference in Quintilian points to the same conclusion. In his discussion of what Greek authors can be read with most profit, Quintilian excludes Tyrtaeus from his reading list. Rhetorically Quintilian anticipates an objection: Quid? Horatius frustra Tyrtaeum Homero subiungit (10.1.56). He goes on to explain that he has excluded Tyrtaeus and others, not because their work lacks merit, but because their work is not synonymous with perfection. Quintilian intended his book as a practical guide. There would be no point in his talking about Tyrtaeus unless a sizable amount of his work were available to his readers. At 12.11.27, Quintilian may again be speaking highly of Tyrtaeus (if the text can be emended): Neque enim si Achillis gloriam in rebus bellicis consequi non potest, Aiacis aut Diomedis laudem aspernabitur, nec, qui Homeri non fuerunt, [non fuerunt] TyrtaeiA1 Given the nature of Tyrtaeus' poetry and the bent of the Roman tempera ment, I am persuaded that these references reflect a long and ready acceptance of a substantial part of his work at Rome.42 Whatever Tyrtaeus' relationship to the Lycurgan reforms, it is certain that he played a major role in forging the legend of Sparta which has had immense influence on the intellectual history of Europe. The subject is vast and here I can only recommend Elizabeth Rawson's fascinating and valuable account. She shows, for example, that by an irony of history Tyrtaeus emerged in the Renaissance as the prototype of the artist using his talent to urge his countrymen to fight for freedom. Tyrtaeus was cast in this role because of a story told by Plutarch (Cleom. 2.3). Leonidas, Spartan king and hero of Thermopylae, when asked what he thought of Tyrtaeus, replied "'Αγαθός νέων ψυχας κακκανην," good at sharpening the courage of the young. In this way, Tyrtaeus became associated with the gallant Spartan stand against the invading Persians and shares in their glory and achievement. Forgotten is the fact that Tyrtaeus wrote to encourage the Spartans in war of naked aggression. In revolutionary France, [The] name [Tyrtaeus] stood in verse for all that Demos thenes represented in prose. Poets and musicians were both dubbed, or dubbed themselves with the coveted title.... Rouget de l'Isle, author of the Marseillaise, was thought to qualify particularly well by fighting for the republic ... as well as hymning it. It is perhaps owing to the popularity of the comparison now that nationalists struggles all over</page><page sequence="18">22 H. James Shey Europe in the next generations produce so many aspirants to the title of the new Tyrtaeus... ,43 In a later chapter Rawson, describes the Spartan tradition in Germany, ending with an analysis of twentieth-century laconism epitomized by Hitler.44 As she shows, the legend of Sparta can be used to support almost any political ideology, good and bad. She draws her account to a close with the following statement: ...[Sparta's] name will remain with us for some time yet, to symbolize in dramatic fashion some of the social and political possibilities always before us. It is, in fact, inappropriate to draw any conclusion from the history of the Spartan tradition, for the reason that it has surely not come to an end.45 For better or worse, Tyrtaeus' name should always be associated with the tradition he helped create. University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Notes 1 I cite the text of Carlo Prato's Tyrtaeus &lt;Lyricorum Graecorum quae extant) (Rome 1968). This edition has greatly improved the apparatus of E. Diehl's edition of the poem in Anthologia Lyrica Graeca, vol. 1 (Leipzig 1949 19523), and in addition provides a long introduction, all the ancient testi monia, a very detailed bibliographic section, and ample commentary. Those who have their Tyrtaeus in Diehl's edition will find that Prato's text of this poem differs from Diehl's in only three places. In line 1, Prato reads τιθειμην, του δ' in line 27, and 5' after γηράσκωυ in line 39. This last dif ference is important, I think, and will be discussed below (fr. 9DJt Prato 9). M. L. West's iambi et elegi Graeci ante Alexandrum cantati, vol. 2 (Oxford 1972) is also available, but is not nearly so useful as Prato's edition. There are two new commentaries in English: Douglas Gerber's Euterpe: An Anthology of Early Greek Lyric, Elegiac, and Iambic Poetry (Amsterdam 1970) and David A. Cambell's Greek Lyric Poetry: A Selection of Early Greek Lyric, Elegiac and Iambic Poetry (London and New York 1967). Most editors and commentators think the poem is complete and I proceed on that assumption. For external evidence for the unity of the poem, see Campbell, 176.</page><page sequence="19">Tyrtaeus and the Art of Propaganda 23 The "Wertepriamel" is a rhetorical figure in which the poet lists a series of items which people have always considered valuable and desirable (e.g., wealth, power, health) and then rejects them in favor of something which he considers to be the highest value. Cf. Schmid's fuller definition of the "Wertepriamel," Die Priamel der Werte in Griechischen von Homer bis Paulus (Wiesbaden 1964) ix-x. He discusses the elegy on arete on pp. 1-6 and refers to it very frequently throughout his book. For the priamel in general see W. Kroling, Die Priamel (Beispielreihung) als Stilmittel in der griechisch-romischen Dichtung (Greifswalder Beitrage 10; 1935). Schmid (above, note 1) 1, says of the priamel, "Nirgends ist die Werte priamel in so schlichter und doch so wirkungsvoller Form ausgefiirt worden wie hier, so dass man die Elegie geradezu als klassisches Beispiel einer Wertepriamel bezeichnen kann." Bruno Snell, Tyrtaios und die Sprache des Epos (Hypomnemata, Heft 22; Gottingen 1969). See especially Chapter 3, "Der Menschen Wege sind verschieden," 27-36, and passim. At one time, the authenticity of all the fragments of Tyrtaeus was doubted. The elegy on arete came under gravest suspicion, in large measure because it seemed too "philosophical" or abstract to have been written in seventh century Sparta. Hermann Frankel (Dichtung und Philosophie des friihen Griechentums [Miinchen 19622] 175) argues that ". . .sein [Tyrtaeus] Denken operiert mit runden, konkreten Szenenbildern, die entweder erfreulich oder abstossend sind." He footnotes this statement (175, n. 9) as follows: "Deshalb kann Fgt. 9, das in strenger Analyse die einzeln Komponenten eines komplexen Bildes auseinanderlegt und bewertet, nicht von Tyrtaios sein. . . ." Frankel's argument has been refuted by Snell (above, note 4) 27 f. The standard defense of the poem's authenticity is that of Werner Jaeger, "Tyrtaios iiber die wahre ΑΡΕΤΗ," Scripta Minora II (Rome 1960) 75-113 (=SPAW 23 [l932] 537-568). Those interested in a chronicle of the debate may consult Ε. N. Tigerstedt's detailed, but uncritical, account in The Legend of Sparta in Classical Antiquity ("Stockholm Studies in History of Literature" 9; Stockholm 1965) vol. 1, 44 ff. with the extensive notes on pp. 340ff. Tyrtaeus was no fledgling philosopher, and it is wrong to cast him in that role and read the poem from that point of view. The literature on early Spartan history is complex and frequently contra dictory. But however differently the sources are interpreted, all modern scholars are agreed on the importance of Tyrtaeus' fragments. See, for example, "The Sources," in W. G. Forrest's A History of Sparta 950-192 B.C. (London 1968) 15-17. There is an extensive and fairly up-to-date bibliography in Pavel Oliva's Sparta and Her Social Problems (Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences), trans, by Iris Urwin-Levitovâ (Prague and Amsterdam 1971) 324-335. For other views on the poem's structure see Gerber (above, note 1) 75, and Campbell (above, note 1) 176-177. I see in the poem a more refined structure than the bipartition assumed by others.</page><page sequence="20">24 H. James Shey ' Felix Jacoby, who thought that lines 3-9 were interpolated, objected to the change of construction in line three and argued further that "νικφη θε'ων v.4 wiederholt geradezu πόδων άρετή v.2," Hermes 58 (1918) 38. Jacoby's general views on the poem, developed during the debate over its authenticity, are no longer pertinent, but his charge of repetition has had a curious influence on Prato and Schmid. In an attempt to answer Jacoby, Prato offers a foreed interpretation that line 4 refers to a chariot race. Attributing the action of running to the driver instead of the horses (the only way to in terpret θε'ω on Prato's theory, a point he ignores) is a bold usage. At Od. 3.288, Homer says of a person on board ship "ίξε θε'ωυ," but the context makes the usage clear. After the πόδων αρετής of line 2, which clearly refers to running (cf. Pindar, Pyth. 10.23) and supplies all the context we have, one naturally envisions a footrace as he reads line 4. Schmid (above, note 2)2, does not cite Jacoby but he appears to have been influenced by the same argument as Prato: he says the πόδων αρετής must refer to "Weitsprung (nur er kann in v.2 neben θε'ων in v.4 gemeint sein). . . ." Instead of forcing an interpretation of line 4, Schmid prefers to force line 2. He also thinks that the Cyclopes in line 3 exemplify the aretal of the discus thrower and the javelin thrower insomuch as Polyphemus, in Od. 9, throws two great boulders at Odysseus' ship. But again, after the παλαιμοσύνης of line 2, one naturally understands line 3 as descriptive of those qualities useful to the wrestler. Size and strength were of particular advantage to wrestlers since there was no division in classes by weight, and success at the highest level of competition was possible only for big men. In early times, the ideal athlete was not the runner, but the wrestler, or the boxer, and the training of the athlete aimed at producing strength only (ή άρχαι'α [ sc. γυμναστική]... μόνην την ϊσχύν εγύμναζεν, Philostratus, Gym. 43 [ed. Kayser]). See Ε. Ν. Gardiner, Athletics of the Ancient World (Oxford 1930) 53ff., and H. A. Harris, Sport in Greece and Rome (Ithaca 1972) 21. Jacoby was right; verses three and four are repetitious, but very effectively so. For beauty as an arete, see Prato's note ad. loc. Od. 8.164-185 reveals a complex value system involving athletic ability, beauty, intelligence, and eloquence. Here beauty (φμή) is subordinated to brains (φρε'νες) and elo quence (άγορητύς). At II. 3.39-45, in Hector's criticism of Paris, beauty (καλόν είδος) is subordinated to άλκή. The passage in the Odyssey indi cates that athletic skill is more valuable than beauty, at least to Odysseus. Cf., for example, Nestor's and Odysseus' role in the Iliad and especially Polydamas' speech to Hector at II. 13.726-734. Midas,Cinyras, and Adrastus are themselves kings, but the point is that they are not famous for being kings. On the close relationship of δόξα and άρετή, see line 9 and Schmid (above, note 2) 6, with references. Jaeger (above, note 5) 94. See also his Paideia: the Ideals of Greek Culture, trans. G. Highet (Oxford 19452), vol. 1, 90ff. and C. M. Bowra's Early Greek Elegists ("Martin Classical Lectures" 7; Cambridge, Mass. 1935) 61-70. Jaeger and Bowra overrate Tyrtaeus' originality as a thinker and their views need qualification. See Campbell (above, note 1) 177-178 and below.</page><page sequence="21">Tyrtaeus and the Art of Propaganda 25 12 Tyrtaeus' connection with the so-called Lycurgan reforms remains mys terious. All we know for certain is that in the seventh century Sparta be came spartan and that Tyrtaeus played a major role in the political, social, and military changes (see Forrest [above, note θ] 40-60). If we can believe Plutarch's Life of Lycurgus (8ff.), which may derive from Aristotle, the Spartans were given over to the unbridled pursuit of luxury prior to the reforms — and personal pleasures — in short the "goods" rejected in Tyrtaeus' priamel, at least insofar as those goods are sought without regard for the goals and priorities of the polis. 13 Max Treu was the first to suspect how Tyrtaeus was using the mythological characters in his priamel (reference in Prato, note to line 3). Snell (above, note 4) 34-35, has come very close to seeing Tyrtaeus' intentions and his remarks are worth reporting rather fully: "Seine [Tyrtaeus'] Beispiele fur bestimmte Aretai sind iibrigens nicht gerade iiberzeugend, konnen nicht leicht jemandem verlocken. . .. Bei Homer gilt jemand etwas, wenn er 'gross und schon' ist, — demgegeniiber wird die Arete der Kyklopen anriichig. Fiir die Schnelligkeit nennt er nicht etwas den 'fussschnellen' Achill, sonder den Thraker Boreas, den halben Barbaren. . . . Tithonos ist ihm Muster der Schonheit, der als lacherlich zirpende Grille endete. Midas und Kinyras nennt er als reich; von diesem, dem Kyprier, wissen wir wenig, urn Midas stand es klaglich. Pelops als 'Koniglicher' stand den Peloponnesiern . . . naher, aber wenn er hier 'Tantalide' heisst, klingt Bedenkliches mit." Tyrtaeus' selection of Adrastus as a type of eloquence puzzles Snell: "Warum nannte nicht etwa Odysseus oder . . . Nestor?" This question shows that he does not completely understand what Tyrtaeus is doing with his priamel (a point I shall return to below), but Snell's instincts are right: "Allés in allem scheint nur so viel gewiss: Tyrtaios will nicht argumen tieren, sondern propagieren." 14 For information on Cinyras and the myth of the toy ships, see Sir James Frazer, Apollodorus: The Library ("Loeb Classical Library"; Cambridge, Mass. 1921) vol. 2, 179 with excellent notes. See also Frazer's Adonis Attis Osiris: Studies in the History of Oriental Religion (London 1906), Ch. 3, 17-33. The myths about Cinyras have about them an aura of decadence and depravity. He is credited, for example, with the introduction of sacred prostitution on Cyprus. 15 Thé fragments of the Thebais are available in T. W. Allen, Homeri Opera, Tomus V Hymnos Cyclum Fragmenta etc. (Oxford 1946) 112-114. Pindar knew the Thebais well and here follows the wording of the epic closely (Allen 114). Pausanias (9.9.5) says the Thebais was attributed to Homer by Callinus, elegiac poet and older contemporary of Tyrtaeus. The Thebais was closely connected with two other epics, the Oidipodeia and the Epigoni, and together they traced the bloody saga of Thebes from the beginning. All three epics were popular in fifth-century Athens and the Attic tragedians drew heavily on them for material for their dramas. The Thebais may have survived into the Christian era; since Pausanias' judgment, that the poem</page><page sequence="22">26 H. James Shey was inferior only to the Iliad, and the Odyssey, indicates that he had read at least substantial parts of it. There is every reason to suppose that Tyrtaeus and Plato knew the poem well. See G. L. Huxley Greek Epic Poetry from Eumelos to Panyassis (Cambridge, Mass. 1969) 39-50. 16 Bringing Adrastus to Athens as a suppliant, for example, must be an Athenian invention. Pausanias (1.43.1) says that Adrastus died on his way back to Argos with his beaten army. 17 On εικασία see E. S. Thompson's note on Meno 80c (London 1901) 112. In the Symposium, Alcibiades says he will praise Socrates δι'εικόνων (215ff-) by comparing him with Sileni and with Marsyas. Phaedrus is the πατήρ τοΰ λόγου in the Symposium and as such selects the topic for discussion and has the first speech (177ff.). The chief character istic of Phaedrus' eulogy on Eros is the richness of mythological allusion. At 180a, Phaedrus is delighted to be able to point out an error in Aeschylus' use of myth. 19 The case for identifying Adrastus with Antiphon seems to me very weak. I. Bekker's attempt to explicate the points of comparison is unconvincing: "Antiphon enim quum proditionis accusatus essent, quod reipublicae exitio legatus ad Lacedaemonios esset profectus et e castris navi hostili abiisset, atrocissima poena in ipsum constituta est, ut neque Athenis, neque in terra Attica sepeliretur, ipseque et omnes ex ipso nati infâmes essent. Causam dicere coactus, supplex ad Athenienses, ut olim Adrastus Argivus, tam admirabili eloquentiae vi perorasse traditur, ut nullus unquam melius capitis causam dixerit," Platonis Opera (London 1826), vol. 1, note ad loc. See also Plato, Phaedrus, ed., trans., comm., R. Hackforth (Cambridge 1952), 142, note ad loc. 20 On ή και used as the Latin sive, see examples in R. Kiihner-B. Gerth, Ausfiihrliche Grammatik des griechischen Sprache (Hannover and Leipzig 19043; repr. Darmstadt 1966), vol. 2, 11.538.2, and J. Denniston, The Greek Particles (Oxford 19592), 306. Heindorf (apud Bekker [above, note 19] note ad loc.), if I read him correctly, seems inclined to identify Adrastus with Pericles, but thinks that the και with the ή prevents that. 21 See Plato, Gorgias, ed. and comm. by E. R. Dodds (Oxford 1959), 28-29 and notes on 515b ff. 22 On Plato's attitude towards Pericles in the Phaedrus, see Hackforth (above, note 19) 149. In the Meno (93a ff. and 99b ff.) Plato does seem to be more guarded in his remarks on the great leaders of imperial Athens, but again I do not think Plato is really modifying the position he took in the Gorgias. As Dodds (above, note 21) 23, remarks the "... statesmen [in the Meno] are classed with diviners and poets (99c-d), which in Socrates' mouth is no compliment." On the date of the Meno, relative to the Gorgias, see Dodds, ibid. 23 D. J. Conacher, Euripidean Drama: Myth, Theme, and Structure (Toronto 1967) 106 ff. But cf. G. Zuntz's interpretation of Adrastus' funeral oration, The Political Plays of Euripides (Manchester 1955) 11 ff. 24 These lines of Plautus' read like a statement of the theme of Tyrtaeus'</page><page sequence="23">Tyrtaeus and the Art of Propaganda 27 poem, as I interpret it. The character of Tyrtaeus' poetry would have made him congenial reading for the Roman, on which see below. On the close relationship of athletics and ancient warfare, see Gardiner (above, note 8) 2, 9, 19, 28. The growth of athletics in Greece was largely due to the Spartans, who dominated competition at Olympia for 150 years. The Spartans were especially conscious of the military function of athletics (Philostratus, Gym. 19). For Sparta's early dominance at Olympia, see also Gardiner's Olympia: Its History and Remains (Oxford 1925) 89. 1 Philostratus Gym. (8) traces the history of athletics to heroic times. He says that various Argonauts were famous for this ability or that. Peleus was the best wrestler on the Argo (ε'κράτει δε απάντων πάλη) and therefore was considered the best warrior (πολεμικώτατόν τε νομισθήναι των ε'φ' εαυτού δια τε τήν άρετήν). I cannot find any evidence, however, that Tyrtaeus has used locutions in this passage or any other which have technical meanings in wrestling terminology. For a discussion of terms used in wrestling see Ε. N. Gardiner, Greek Athletic Sports and Festivals (London 1910) 372-401. Line 12 of Tyrtaeus (δήιων όρε'γοιτ' ε'γγύθεν ιστάμενος) sounds to me like the attitude a wrestler would take when addressing his opponent. Harris (above, note 8) 112-126. Tyrtaeus repeats the formula for young and old three times in this poem with slight variations: the other instances are, νε'οι ήδε παλαιοί' (37) and νε'οι of τε κατ' αυτόν ... of τε παλαιότεροι (41-42). The variations are generally seen as feeble attempts to avoid repetition but essentially line fillers. See C. M. Bowra (above, note 11) 51-52. For the meaning of νε'οι in this context, see W. J. Verdenius, "Tyrtaeus 6-7D. A Commentary," Μ η IV 22 (1969) 345-346. On the strong emotive connotations of όλοφύρομαι see J. Η. H.

Etymologically and philologically κήδω appears to denote the intense and emotionally painful grief one feels at the loss of a dear and valued member of one's immediate family. On this point, see Arthur W. H. Adkins, Moral Values and Political Be havior in Ancient Greece (New York 1972) 35-36. Theognis, Le premier livre, ed. with comm. by B. A. van Groningen (Amster dam 1966) 354-356. Theognis (1.935-938) gives a short version of Tyrtaeus (37-42). A. W. H. Adkins, " 'Honor' and 'Punishment' in the Homeric Poems," BICS 6 (1966) 29. Cf. Emile Benveniste, Le Vocabulaire des Institutions Indo-europeenes (Paris 1969) vol. 2, 42 ff. The decree of άτιμι'η could be leveled for any crime, but was used especially as punishment for cowardice in battle. See H. Michell, Sparta (Cambridge 1964) 44 with references. Verdenius, by the way (above, note 28) 340, has high praise for these lines: "[Tyrtaeus] achieved a general synthesis of</page><page sequence="24">28 H. James Shey of poetic form and content. . . . This poetic quality raises his work above the level of a merely practical purpose." 34 Cf. Prato's suggestion with Franz Kiechle's discussion of the Gerousia Laconien und Sparta (Vestigia: Beitrage zur alten Geschichte 5; Miinchen 1963) 142-143. In his review of Prato's edition and commentary (CR N.S. 20 [ΐ97θ] 50), M. L. West calls Prato's note on γηράσκω ν "acute." 35 This point is nicely made by Gerber (above, note 1) note ad loc. 36 Some estimations of Tyrtaeus as a poet (collected by Verdenius [above, note 28] 340): Harder, "[Tyrtaeus shows] nicht die gerinste Literarisierung, " and "Nicht Literatur, sondern wirklich gehaltene Reden;" Wilamowitz, "Der alte Tyrtaios ist eben kein wirklicher Poet." Similar pronouncements could be added to this list. 37 Archiloque, "The Poetry of Archilochus," ("Entretiens sur l'Antiquité Classique," X; Geneva 1964) 194. His valuable arguments are on pp. 190 195. 33 Jaeger, Scripta Minora, 99 ff. 39 Incidentally, Plato (Leg. 1.629ff.) shows exactly how seriously Tyrtaeus is to be taken as a thinker. If courage is the supreme virtue, then civil war must be the best war because such a war is more ruthless and bloody and therefore the best test of courage. Cf. Bowra (above, note 11) 70: "In his own way [Tyrtaeus] tried to find out a coherent explanation of man's place in the world." 40 U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Die Textgeschichte der griechischen Lyriker (Ahb. Gôtt. Ges. d. Wiss. N. F. Bd. IV; Berlin 1900) 97 ff. 41 Radermacher restores Tyrtaeus' name in this corrupt passage. Quintilian's most recent editor M. Winterbottom (Oxford 1970) does not restore Tyrtaeus' name and leaves a lacuna. Prato accepts Radermacher's restoration. 42 Since so little remains of Tyrtaeus, chances of spotting any direct influence of his work on Roman authors are mathematically slim. Nonetheless Locksley I. Lindo argues for the influence of Tyrtaeus on Horace Odes 3.2 (CP 66 [l971] 258-260) and Gerber (above, note 1) 78, draws attention to an article by I. Millân Gonzâlez-Pardo (Emérita 27 [1959] 153-158) who sees an adapt ation of fr. 9.31 in Vergil, Eel., 5.78, which is repeated in Aen. 1.609. For the influence of Spartan tradition on Rome see Elizabeth Rawson's excel lent The Spartan Tradition in European Thought (Oxford 1969) 95-115. Quellenforschung in Plautus, and particularly for the Amphitruo, is almost an intramural sport, but it appears that the emphasis on the theme of virtus in the play is due to political and military realities in Rome when the play was produced and therefore probably not in the original Greek models. (See G. Karl Galinsky, "Scipionic Themes in Plautus' Amphitruo," TAPA 97 [1966] 201-235). I suggest that Plautus may have had Tyrtaeus in mind when he wove this theme into his play (see above, note 24). 43 Rawson (above, note 42) 285. 44 Ibid. 332-343. 45 Ibid. 367.</page></plain_text>
