<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion I/1 PREHISTORIC GODDESSES: THE CRETAN CHALLENGE Marymay Downing The religion of prehistoric peoples on the Mediterranean island of Crete opens up promising new avenues of inquiry for religious studies. At a time when the discipline is consciously striving to correct the imbalance of androcentrism,1 the religion of the Cretans of the second millennium B.C.E. and earlier presents a unique opportunity. The anthropomorphic religious imagery in the archaeological record is so overwhelmingly female that any lingering tendency to center attention on the male image to the exclusion of the female simply falters.2 Instead, the data actually exhort us to think in gynocentric categories. I mean gynocentric categories in an almost Kantian sense. Like the categories of space and time, sexual categories provide the framework by which we perceive, and structure our perceptions meaningfully. Our perceptions have long been shaped by the social assumption that male ness is more significant than femaleness. In other words, the change we are invited to make in our thinking by the gynocentric religious imagery from prehistoric Crete is a very radical change. But it is a change that has not yet been fully appreciated. The challenge to think in gynocentric categories has not really been taken up. Few attempts to explain the gynocentric religious imagery, or to reflect on its significance, avoid androcentric or other limiting socioreligious assumptions. The first excavations to reveal this remarkable ancient civilization were made by Sir Arthur Evans in 1900. He uncovered the site of Knos sos, a major Cretan settlement that was inhabited from Neolithic times (the earliest radiocarbon dating is 6100 [? 150] B.C.E.) until approxi mately 1400 B.C.E., when the last of its magnificent palaces was destroyed.3 Evans is said to describe the religion that he found evidence 1 An example of this effort is Rita M. Gross, ed., Beyond Androcentrism: New Essays on Women and Religion (Missoula, MT: Scholars Press, 1977). 2 No account of prehistoric Cretan religious imagery is complete if it considers only the anthropomorphic imagery. Symbols like the labrys (the double-axe that has become a popu lar symbol for feminists and lesbians because it is never depicted in the hands of a male in Minoan Crete), the so-called horns of consecration, the pillar, the figure-eight shield, the sacral knot, etc., are not examined by this account, which makes no claim to be complete. 3 Dates used in this article are necessarily approximate. Details of the time and circum stances of Knossos' final destruction, for example, are the subject of considerable debate,</page><page sequence="2">8 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion for at Knossos as "a kind of monotheism" centered around a goddess who "creates and nourishes all things."4 Female monotheism did not lead Evans to think in gynocentric categories, however. For when he discov ered the famous Throne Room at Knossos with its single throne, he con cluded in androcentric fashion that it was meant for the priest-king, Minos. In this he followed the Homeric lead: "Knossos, spacious city where Minos reigns for nine years, familiar friend of mighty Zeus."5 The pre-Greek Cretan civilization thus acquired its widely accepted name, perhaps a misnomer, Minoan.6 Evans did not argue for the possibility that, like the symbol of the throne in Egypt and Anatolia,7 probable origins of Cretan immigration,8 the throne at Knossos might represent the Minoan Goddess, or have been intended for her priestess. Evans's priest-king hypothesis continues to be most popular, though it is rarely mentioned that it makes sense only for the final few centuries of the island's long history. Support for it is found in the seal impressions depicting a subordinate male god who appears late, and very rarely, in the Minoan record.9 Given his conspicuously smaller size, he has been some putting it at about 200 years later. The range of dates given for the island's earliest Neolithic settlements is even greater. Recent calibrations now push back radiocarbon dates as much as a millennium from earlier estimates. See Marija Gimbutas, The Gods and Goddesses of Old Europe, 7000 to 3500 B.C.: Myths, Legends and Cult Images (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1974), p. 14. Thus the roots of Crete's ancient civilization may reach back into the seventh or even eighth millennium B.C.E. (but see below, n. 6). 4 Martin P.

(New York: Biblo &amp; Tannen, 1971), p. 292. 5 Odyssey 19, 178-79. 6 Despite the island's long history, the name "Minoan civilization" is usually limited to the materially more impressive Bronze Age of Cretan society, after roughly 3000 B.C.E. It was during this period that the majestic "palaces" were constructed at several sites around the island. 7 Merlin Stone, When God Was a Woman (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1976), p. 96. 8 Probable origins are traced in a variety of ways. Linguistic and ethnographic connec tions are strong between Crete and Anatolia according to George Thomson, Studies in Ancient Greek Society: The Prehistoric Aegean (New York: International Publishers, 1949). Leonard Cottrell claims that artistic and symbolic connections can also be made with Anatolia and with Egypt. See his The Mystery of Minoan Civilization (New York: World, 1971), pp. 35, 61-62. Marija Gimbutas has most recently argued for symbolic and cultural connections with Europe as well in "Women and Culture in Goddess-Oriented Old Europe," in The Politics of Women's Spirituality, ed. Charlene Spretnak (Garden City, NY: Anchor Press, 1982), pp. 22-31. 9 Nilsson, Minoan-Mycenaean Religion, pp. 400-405; R. F. Willetts, Ancient Crete: A Social History From Early Times until the Roman Occupation (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1965), p. 128. The Linear B evidence of a Diktaian Zeus (di-ka-ta-jo / di we) lends support to the child-god hypothesis (Michael Ventris and John Chadwick, Docu ments in Mycenaean Greek [Cambridge: At the University Press, 1959], pp. 305-6), but Linear B too is late evidence. It records the language used by the Mycenaeans at Knossos</page><page sequence="3">Downing: Prehistoric Goddesses 9 interpreted as the son of the mother-goddess, a fertility god, like Adonis and Tammuz of other ancient religions, who died and was reborn in association with agricultural cycles. Proponents of the hypothesis contend that he was represented by a priest-king, "the adopted son on earth of the Cretan Mother-goddess."10 Evans thought that perhaps the gyno centric religion reflected older "matriarchal" times before "the great days of Minoan Civilization,"11 but most others imply that the island always had male politico-religious leadership, even before the appear ance in the record of the child-god. Occasionally, but rarely in the main stream literature, someone suggests that a woman might have sat on the ceremonial throne.12 Because prehistoric Cretan civilization is so ancient, another bias besides androcentrism has influenced interpretations of the archaeologi cal data: the ethnocentric bias implicit in most evolutionary theories of socioreligious development. When Minoan civilization was discovered, and the predominant femaleness of its religious imagery first reflected on, a theory of socioreligious evolution already existed which the Minoan evidence tended to confirm. Female preeminence in Minoan religion added support to the classical Greek references in myth and history which J. J. Bachofen had used to substantiate his argument that the spiri tual evolution of the human species began with women in their function as mothers.13 Bachofen's theory carried with it the view that the reli gions of matrilineal peoples, with their material base (in the physical nature of childbirth), represented a stage of spiritual confinement. The discovery of paternity, with its more tenuous physical link, opened up the metaphysical realm: "we shall now be able to ... give to the victory of the patriarchate its proper position in the history of mankind.... the triumph of paternity brings with it the liberation of the spirit from the ca. 1450 B.C.E. The earlier Minoan script, Linear A, has not yet been deciphered. 10 Willetts, Ancient Crete, p. 138. 11 Sir Arthur Evans, The Palace of Minos (1921-35; reprint ed., London: Hafner, 1964), vol. 3, p. 457. 12 Cottrell, Mystery of Minoan Civilization, pp. 43-44; Gerald Cadogan, Palaces of Minoan Crete (London: Barrie &amp; Jenkins, 1976), p. 61. I use the throne example only to highlight the tendency in mainstream scholarship to make androcentric assumptions about political and cultural structures regardless of gynocentric religious symbolism. As Ventris and Chadwick point out, no thrones have been found in other Minoan palace sites, and it is a late addition to Knossos as well (Mycenaean Greek, p. xxiii). Since the throne appears as late as the male images and the Mycenaean script, Linear B, there may be some corre lation. It could reflect the imposition by the Mycenaeans of a hierarchy in the final phase of the Minoan civilization, a hierarchy that may well have been male-dominated, as the militaristic Mycenaean society was (see below, n. 50). 13 Bachofen's Das Mutterecht (1861) is available in a selection of his writings translated from the German called Myth, Religion and Mother Right (Princeton: Princeton Univer sity Press, 1973).</page><page sequence="4">10 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion manifestations of nature."14 Jane Ellen Harrison was a classicist writing at the time of the first Minoan discoveries. She is much valued by feminist scholars today for her informative work on Greek religion, at least in part because she takes into account the gynocentric Minoan heritage. But Harrison's interpretive ten dencies sometimes conformed to the prevailing ethnocentric view in which the development of patriarchy was seen as progress in human evolution because it represented the triumph of civilized reason over primitive superstition. Harrison called one of the Knossos seal impressions "a stand ing monument of matriarchalism,"15 and predicted that prehistoric Crete would yield "no figure of a dominant male divinity"16 (her emphasis), a prediction that, as far as I know, still holds. She also, however, judged this earlier stage of evolution, with its survivals in Greek religion, to be reli giously unenlightened, superstitious, and based on magic. . . . the shift from matriarchy to patriarchy ... [in] spite of a seem ing retrogression, is a necessary stage in a real advance. Matriarchy gave to woman a false because a magical prestige. With patriarchy 14 Ibid., p. 109. 15 The term matriarchy used by Evans, Harrison, and others was perhaps an unfortunate choice. It carried many built-in ideas about power relations, causing so much controversy that much of the discussion among classicists became constricted by the imperatives of a narrowly drawn debate: to prove or disprove female domination, or the mirror image of patriarchy, in Minoan Crete. In recent years feminist classicists have participated in this debate. C. G. Thomas argued that Minoan women had "greater authority than men" in "Matriarchy in Early Greece: The Bronze and Dark Ages," Arethusa 6, no. 2 (1973): 173-95. Sheila K. Dickison responded in the "Forum" of a later issue (vol. 9, no. 1 [1976]: 119-20). Dickison rejected Thomas's argument on the grounds that female deities, exclu sively female rituals, and influential priestesses did not make classical Greece a matriar chy, a view that was shared by Sarah B. Pomeroy in "A Classical Scholar's Perspective on Matriarchy," in Liberating Women's History, ed. Berenice A. Carroll (Chicago: Univer sity of Illinois Press, 1976), pp. 217-23. (Without entering the debate, it is worth pointing out that classical Greek religion, while it had goddesses and exclusively female rituals, also had dominating gods, which Minoan religion apparently did not.) Pomeroy's position in this article and in her book Goddesses, Whores, Wives and Slaves (New York: Schocken Books, 1975) is one of laudable scholarly caution. She acknowledges her feminist bias and perhaps overcompensates for it. But in a debate thus far constricted by the "either matri archy or patriarchy" terms of reference, she has at least pointed the way out with her salient comment in "Selected Bibliography on Women in Antiquity," Arethusa 6, no. 1 (1973): 125-57: "There is, to be sure, a dearth of clear evidence establishing the matriar chy, but there is equally, as no reviewer pointed out, a lack of conclusive evidence prov ing the existence of patriarchy in Minoan Crete" (p. 134). Once we admit that Crete might have been neither, then "we are free," as Anne Barstow says, "to ask a more realis tic question about prehistoric societies, namely, did men and women ever relate in ways other than dominance/subjection?" See her "The Uses of Archeology for Women's His tory: James Mellaart's Work on the Neolithic Goddess at (natal Hiiyiik," Feminist Studies 4, no. 3 (1978): 8-9. 16 Jane Ellen Harrison, Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion (1903; reprint ed., London: Merlin Press, 1980), p. 497.</page><page sequence="5">Downing: Prehistoric Goddesses 11 came inevitably the facing of a real fact, the fact of the greater natural weakness of women. Man the stronger, when he outgrew his belief in the magical potency of woman, proceeded by a par donable practical logic to despise and enslave her as the weaker.17 Fortunately, the discipline has since become aware of the pitfalls of an evolutionary theory of religion which implies unilinear theological, philo sophical, or ethical progress over time. No longer need prehistoric gyno centric religious symbolism necessarily be implicitly inferior, less true, or less beautiful, simply because it occurred at an earlier point in time.18 Robert Bellah offers an evolutionary theory of religion as symbol sys tem in which he claims to avoid these value-laden implications. It may provide a helpful approach to the Cretan material. The stages of Bellah's theory are organized according to the increasingly "differentiated" sym bolization of, and complex relation to, the "ultimate conditions of human existence."19 Minoan religion seems to fit the second stage of his model best, a stage he calls archaic religion. He describes the shift from the first, primitive stage to the archaic stage in "the emergence of true cult with the complex of gods, priests, worship, sacrifice, and in some cases divine or priestly kingship."20 The Minoan archaeological record gives clear indication of all of these criteria. The record of the worship of anthropomorphic deities is in the distinctive "bell-shaped" shrine idols such as those found in situ in the Shrine of the Double Axes at Knossos.21 It is also in the many seal-impression scenes that depict an anthropomorphic deity receiving homage and offerings.22 There are also 17 Ibid., p. 285. The belief expressed here that women could hold political power only through magic and deception is also expressed through the myth of matriarchy in some South American societies discussed by anthropologist Joan Bamberger in her very influen tial article, "The Myth of Matriarchy: Why Men Rule in Primitive Society," in Woman, Culture, and Society, ed. Michelle Zimbalist Rosaldo and Louise Lamphere (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1974), pp. 263-80. Since the myth teaches "that women did not know how to handle power when they had it," Bamberger argues that "the myth of matriarchy is but the tool used to keep woman bound to her place. To free her, we need to destroy the myth" (p. 280). Sheila Dickison and others have found in Bamberger's argument a good reason for discouraging interpretations of Minoan women as powerful for fear of keeping the same sort of myth of matriarchy alive in our society. The term matriarchy is indeed inadequate (see above, n. 15), but I am afraid that such an attitude could equally well censor the possibility that Minoan women did know how to handle power without deception or force (such as men use). In fact, the long history of Crete's peaceful and thriving economy may have a great deal to teach us about power relations generally, not only those between the sexes (see below, n. 51). 18 See the chapter "Religious Evolution" in Robert N. Bellah, Beyond Belief (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1970), pp. 20-50. 19 Ibid., p. 22. 20 Ibid., p. 29. 21 Nilsson, Minoan-Mycenaean Religion, pp. 78ff. 22 Much has been derived from the extensive seal-stone collection of miniature scenes. Reproductions of many of these scenes can be found in Nilsson, Minoan-Mycenaean</page><page sequence="6">12 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion frescoes of ritual scenes, and the famous Hagia Triada sarcophagus showing altar rituals and animal sacrifice performed by a priesthood.23 All the ingredients of Bellah's archaic stage are there. It is difficult to describe this material without the actual imagery. Yet if this essay were illustrated, there is one remarkable feature that would not go unnoticed, though words can obscure it (unless the reader has taken up the challenge to think in gynocentric categories!). All the shrine idols are female.24 The probable deities of the seal impressions are, with rare exceptions, female, and in any case no "dominant male divinity" is depicted. Only females perform the altar rites and sacrifice shown on the Hagia Triada sarcophagus, though males have. roles as musicians and bearers of offerings. Ventris and Chadwick, decipherers of the Linear B script, add written confirmation, remarking that "the fact that women officiate connects with the preponderance of hiereiai [priest esses] at Pylos and Knossos."25 It is not clear whether Bellah was using masculine terms generically in describing archaic religion. He mentions women for the primitive stage of evolution: "their ritual life is to some degree separate and focused on particularly feminine life crises."26 However, women are not mentioned separately after that. Is this an androcentric oversight? Perhaps Bellah intended that either sex could be assumed for deities and priesthood at the archaic stage, like the gods, goddesses, priests, and priestesses of the ancient Greek religion he cites as an example. But if we make the deities preeminently female, it corresponds better to the archaeo logical record before the Greeks. An extensive record of female figurines exists throughout the Paleolithic and Neolithic ages "over a vast area of South-Eastern Europe and the Near-East including Crete."27 After approx imately 3000 B.C.E., the Bronze Age Minoan record shows some alterations in style and elaborations on the context but maintains the female as central. Prehistoric goddesses are most frequently understood as nature god desses, fertility goddesses, "earth mothers." These are motifs that clearly focus on this world. In contrast, the characteristic feature of the third stage in Bellah's model, historic religion, is the breakthrough to "an entirely different realm of universal reality, having for religious man the Religion; Thomson, Prehistoric Aegean; and Gertrude Rachel Levy, The Gate of Horn (London: Faber &amp; Faber, 1948), also published later as Religious Conceptions of the Stone Age (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1963). 23 Nilsson, Minoan-Mycenaean Religion, p. 427, fig. 196. The Hagia Triada sarcophagus is a very famous source of information about Minoan ritual and animal sacrifice. Repro ductions can be found in many publications. It is housed in the Herakleion museum. 24 Nilsson, Minoan-Mycenaean Religion, p. 400. 25 Ventris and Chadwick, Mycenaean Greek, pp. 281-82. 26 Bellah, Beyond Belief, p. 28. 27 Nilsson, Minoan-Mycenaean Religion, p. 290. See also Levy, Gate of Horn, and Gim butas, Gods and Goddesses of Old Europe.</page><page sequence="7">Downing: Prehistoric Goddesses 13 highest value" and implying "a derogation of the value of the given empirical cosmos." This is expressed by "world rejection" in the religious system.28 Bellah does not remark on it, but other writers have noticed that, in the Mediterranean region, a gender shift in the deities corre sponds historically to the rise of transcendental, world-rejecting religions. They usually explain the gender shift by an identification of women and female symbols with nature, together with the rise of a new conscious ness which sought freedom from dependency on nature. Rosemary Ruether, for example, suggests that mother-goddess worship reflects "a society directly interacting with and dependent on nature for survival."29 Then in the first millennium B.C.E., men entertain the possibility of freeing themselves from depen dency on nature altogether. They seek to master nature... by subordinating it and linking their essential selves with a transcen dent principle beyond nature which is pictured as intellectual and male. This image of a transcendent, male, spiritual deity is a projection of the ego or consciousness of ruling-class males, who envision a reality, beyond the physical processes that gave them birth, as the true source of their being.30 The nature/fertility motif does work in significant ways as a descrip tion of Cretan goddess imagery. However, it also has serious limitations which have not been generally recognized. A brief consideration of how the nature/fertility motif both works and does not work for the Cretan example of prehistoric goddess imagery should show that the usual under standing of ancient gynocentric religion, and the standard explanation for the advent of androcentric world-rejecting religion, are both in need of reassessment. They are not sufficient. They do not account for all the rele vant data.31 One way the fertility motif works is as an explanation for the frequent practice of leaving small female figurines in graves with the dead. They may have symbolized a faith in the goddess to transform death into new life. The shape and posture of the Neolithic figurines, suggestive of preg nancy and childbirth, invite such an interpretation. After approximately 3000 B.C.E., a slimmer, less literal style appeared, but I see no reason to 28 Bellah, Beyond Belief, p. 32. 29 Rosemary Ruether, New Woman, New Earth (New York: Seabury Press, 1975), p. 11. 30 Ibid., p. 13. 31 The archaeologist Marija Gimbutas also finds the maternal metaphor inadequate for Old European goddess symbolism: "It must be emphasized that from the Upper Paleo lithic onward the persona of the Goddess splintered in response to the developing econ omy, and the images of deities portray far more than the single maternal metaphor. Study of the several stereotypical shapes and postures of the figurines and of the associated sym bolism of the signs incised upon them clearly shows that the figurines were intended to project a multiplicity of divine aspects and a variety of divine functions" ("Women and Culture in Goddess-Oriented Old Europe," p. 27).</page><page sequence="8">14 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion suppose that their meaning in the funerary contexts changed.32 Faith in a goddess in the face of death may have been conceived by the ancient Cretans in quite simple terms, or in thealogically3 complex and profound terms, and the full range in between as well, just as reli gious beliefs vary among individuals, and over an individual's lifetime, in any society. I do not think we should assume at the outset that it was not complex, though that is the tendency of Bellah's evolutionary model. In (atal Hiyiik, a mainland Neolithic town in Anatolia (radiocarbon dates: 6385 [? 101]-5797 [? 79] B.C.E.), female imagery is also clearly associated with the cycle of life and death. In the many shrines uncovered at Catal Hiiyuk by James Mellaart,34 there are other religious symbols that are significantly similar to Cretan discoveries as well: the heads of horned animals most notably.35 But the female imagery, in some cases depictions of the human birthing process, in others simply molded sets of breasts, may be very informative about the way Neolithic peoples in both places felt about death. In (atal Huyiik excarnation was evidently practiced. Vultures from shrine wall-paintings of mortuary scenes sometimes come together with the breast imagery in startling ways. The classicist Emily Vermeule offers her interpretation: The female breasts molded in clay high on the walls of these shrines are clear symbols of the unity of life and death, of the obvious effects of the dead on fields and animals. The breasts promise the start of the life cycle with infant nourishment; and, when they on occasion conceal a vulture's beak or fox's jaw behind the red painted nipple, they also offer the instrument of ultimate recycling.36 32 The classicist Martin Nilsson has argued that these figurines were more likely representa tions of servants and concubines than goddesses, given to dead men as gifts to serve them in the next life (Minoan-Mycenaen Religion, pp. 293-94). However, unlike the Egyptians and the Mycenaeans, the Minoans never developed very elaborate burial practices, so Nilsson's interpretation of the figurines would entail some inconsistency that I think my own avoids. 33 Greek-wise readers will recognize the feminization of this term. Naomi R. Goldenberg recommends adoption of the term theaology by "scholars of feminist religion" in Chang ing of the Gods (Boston: Beacon Press, 1979), p. 96. Such gynocentric terminology is certainly appropriate here. 34 James Mellaart, Catal Hiiyiik: A Neolithic Town in Anatolia (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1967). 35 It is possible that the double-axe, a distinctively Minoan symbol, was also used at Catal Hiiyuk: "The shape of a butterfly emerges on Catal Hiiyuk frescoes (Mellaart 1967: Pi. 40) and is incised on European Neolithic pots.... These schematic butterflies are the proto types of the Minoan 'double-axes' which we find portrayed between the horns of a bull. The emblem of the Great Goddess in its origin has nothing to do with the axe; it antedates the appearance of metal axes by several thousand years" (Gimbutas, Gods and Goddesses of Old Europe, p. 186). 36 Emily Vermeule, Aspects of Death in Early Greek Art and Poetry (Berkeley: Univer sity of California Press, 1979), p. 40.</page><page sequence="9">Downing: Prehistoric Goddesses 15 The breast contains the vulture, not the vulture the breast. Life encloses death. Life comes after death. In Crete the relation between life and death might have been understood not only in terms of the human body providing nourishment for fields and animals, but also in terms of some form of rebirth symbolized by an image of the human female body left with the dead. The question remains: What form of rebirth? The breast is prominent in the female imagery of Minoan religion too. The "bell-shaped" idols in the shrines are identifiable as female only because they are anthropomorphic from the waist up. Female figures in the seal-stone scenes are typically bare-breasted, wearing only the char acteristically Minoan flounced skirt or, occasionally, nude. The famous faience snake-goddess figures share the same flounced skirt but with a bodice that exposes and lifts the breasts, accentuating their fullness. If the theory that connects snake symbolism with death is correct, then in the Minoan snake goddess the accentuated breasts are again associated with the cycle of birth and death. The strongest written evidence that supports a fertility-role interpre tation of Minoan goddess imagery is the Linear B evidence for Eilei thyia, the Homeric goddess of childbirth. Ventris and Chadwick suggest that Eleuthia (e-re-u-ti-ja) in the Knossos Linear B record is the same deity.37 The Cretan cave identified in Homer as hers has been examined by archaeologists, who found signs of ritual use from Neolithic to early Christian times. Etymological arguments have been made38 connecting Eileithyia, the Greek goddess of childbirth, to the Elysian Fields, the Homeric paradisical alternative to Hades,39 as well as to the Eleusinian Mysteries, from which the Greeks gained some comfort in the face of death,40 and which they recognized as having historical roots in Crete.41 If the etymological connection is there, once again birth is juxtaposed with death in such a way as to ease human anxiety in the face of death. 37 Ventris and Chadwick, Mycenaean Greek, pp. 310-11. 38 Nilsson records the arguments in Minoan-Mycenaean Religion, pp. 520ff., and p. 624, n. 18. 39 Odyssey 4, 561-69. Nilsson discusses these alternate visions of the afterlife in Minoan Mycenaean Religion, pp. 619ff. The contrast between them is an important theme also in W. K. C. Guthrie, The Greeks and Their Gods (Boston: Beacon Press, 1950). 40 The Homeric Hymn to Demeter when she establishes her rites at Eleusis says: "Blessed among men who dwell on earth is he who has seen these things; but he who is uninitiated and has no part in the rites has never an equal lot when he has died and passed beneath the dank darkness" (quoted in Guthrie, The Greeks and Their Gods, p. xiii). And from lines which Plutarch quotes from Sophocles we have: "Thrice blessed are those mortals who have seen these rites before they come to Hades, for to them alone is granted true life. Everything evil awaits the rest." 41 The Homeric Hymn to Demeter records the "story" that Demeter was brought from Crete to the mainland by pirates. Jane Ellen Harrison notes other Homeric and Hesiodic passages that connect Demeter with Crete (Prolegomena, pp. 564ff.), often in a birth or death context.</page><page sequence="10">16 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion The Minoan goddess promises new life, not only in the human sphere but in nonhuman contexts as well. The bare-breasted goddess is found with plants as well as with animals in the seal-stone scenes. She is closely associated with the sacred-tree imagery (a prominent feature of Minoan religious symbolism) and is shown seated beneath the tree's boughs receiving offerings of the harvest. She is also frequently shown with animals. Sometimes wild animals, like lions, flank her in the heral dic position. (Wild animals also appear as heralds of a birthing female in (atal Hiiyiik.) The griffins in the Throne Room at Knossos too are posi tioned on either side of the throne.42 This heraldic positioning of animals is usually understood to indicate divinity, as are gestures of veneration or offering by humans. Yet here the limitations begin to emerge in the nature/fertility motif as an adequate description of Minoan goddess imagery. Animal imagery is the one other context in which male anthropomorphic deities are found.43 (Already mentioned are the few instances of a child-god who is usually believed to have had agricultural fertility functions.) The adult male occurs much less frequently than the female in animal imagery, but he shares the heraldic pose indicating divinity. The Linear B record attests to animal husbandry in the Minoan economy, and the dispropor tionate tribute of male animals in the record probably indicates aware ness of the male reproductive role: being numerically more expendable, the male animal is more frequently sacrificed.44 It seems, then, that in the few cases where he does occur in Minoan anthropomorphic religious imagery, the male probably shares the nature/ fertility motif with the female. The most significant problem with the nature/fertility interpretation of female religious imagery of the Minoan palatial period is its limited scope. Certain imagery is simply ignored. Seafaring, for example, is a strong theme in the seal-impression collection which is overlooked by this interpretation. In this theme, the female is again preeminent. Evans called her the sea goddess.45 She is shown on ships crossing fish-laden seas or disembarking on shore bearing her sacred tree. She could be engaged in the extensive maritime trading attested to by the Minoan wares found all around the Mediterranean. Most people notice the fluid grace of the maritime life-forms that suffuse Minoan pottery and interior decorating and that give them their distinctive Minoan style. Quite 42 Animal imagery, like the other recurring symbols, deserves separate attention. Often, as in this example of griffins, the animals are fantastic. Animal and human forms are mixed, recalling the popular myth about the half-man, half-bull Minotaur. Animals are a strong feature of Egyptian religion as well. 43 Nilsson, Minoan-Mycenaean Religion, pp. 398, 400ff. 44 Ventris and Chadwick, Mycenaean Greek, p. 198. 45 Evans, Palace of Minos, vol. 2, pp. 249-52.</page><page sequence="11">Downing: Prehistoric Goddesses 17 naturally for an island people, the sea greatly affected Minoan life. A recently discovered and already famous wall-painting on Thera, an island to the north of Crete, gives an even more elaborate picture of sea travel in that era, and of the great speeds that Cretan sailing vessels could apparently achieve.46 For sailors, the winds would have been very important. Perhaps that explains the frequent appearance of the "priestess of the winds" (a-ne-mo-i-je-re-ja) as a recipient of dedications on the Linear B tablets from Knossos.47 Poseidon, the name of the later Greek god of the sea, is also mentioned on the tablets, but the male divine presence is typically sparse in the graphics. Minoan sea-goddess imagery tends to be passed over if one accepts the nature/fertility motif uncritically. It cannot be made to fit quite so well the function of magically inducing, or otherwise symbolizing, the birth-death-rebirth cycle which underlies the motif. The imagery may indicate concern for the life-forms in the sea (there certainly is aesthetic appreciation of them); but there is just as much concern with the sea as a means of navigation. Sea travel was undoubtedly an important infrastructure of the Minoan economy. Situated almost equidistant from Europe, Asia, and Africa, the Minoans traded with all of them. Finely crafted Minoan pottery with its distinctive shapes and decoration is found in all these lands. Nor was pot tery the only area of skilled craftsmanship and technological expertise that is revealed in the Minoan economic record. The Minoan economy was very diversified, with a strong technological base. The hydraulic engineering of the palatial period, providing indoor plumbing in complex architectural structures of several stories, is often hailed as the hallmark of a highly developed and technologically sophisticated civilization-which most people are amazed actually existed so long ago. A glimpse of the impres sion that Crete made even on the ancient world is preserved in the Homeric epithet, "Crete of a hundred cities."48 Just as remarkable as the technological expertise of their manufac tured goods and architecture, however, is the aesthetic sensibility that permeates everything they created.49 Nothing they made was made artlessly. There are a few features of Minoan art and technology that are particularly relevant to this inquiry and that have been commented on by others. In sharp contrast to the mainland Mycenaean culture, the 46 The painting, entitled "Frieze with the Fleet," is reproduced and discussed by the Greek archaeologist Christos Doumas in Santorini: A Guide to the Island and Its Archae ological Treasures (Athens: Ekdotike Athenon S.A., 1980), pp. 38ff. The island is known by both names, Santorini and Thera. 47 Ventris and Chadwick, Mycenaean Greek, p. 303-4. 48 Iliad 2. 649. 49 Jacquetta Hawkes expresses this aptly in the chapter titled "The Grace of Life" in Dawn of the Gods (New York: Random House, 1968).</page><page sequence="12">18 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion martial theme is absent.50 The Minoans did not use their technological knowledge or artistic expression for warfare. They built no defensive walls. They made no images of war.51 Instead, nature is the theme which imbues Minoan art and architecture with a life-affirming grace impossible to convey in words. Nor are natural images confined or subor dinated by the technology, as technology later, in a world-rejecting con text, is often said to "subordinate" nature. In fact, a visit to the Minoan section of Herakleion's museum is more likely to give the opposite impression. The nature imagery on the artifacts displayed is so bold that it often seems to overwhelm the objects it decorates. Is there some sig nificant relation between the gynocentric religious imagery of this tech nologically sophisticated culture and its apparent reluctance to use its technology to subordinate and destroy?52 The Minoans evidently attained an enviably peaceful and creative culture which took keen delight in the natural wonders of the world. As the sea-goddess imagery helps to show, however, it would be misleading to symbolize their attitude of world-acceptance by means of a goddess understood by the nature/fertility motif alone. The motif may have significantly contributed to world-acceptance through its influence on the Minoan attitude toward death. Still, exclusive emphasis on this sym bol leaves out too much. It conjures up images of helpless dependence on nature which wholly obscures the intelligent, creative, and cooperative relationship that the Minoans had with their world. 50 Nilsson, Minoan-Mycenaean Religion, pp. 410-12. Gimbutas draws the peaceful/ militaristic contrast between the two cultures in much broader terms ("Women and Cul ture in Goddess-Oriented Old Europe," pp. 29-30). She presents the Minoans as the last survivors of the peaceful and goddess-oriented cultures of Old Europe; whereas the Greek-speaking Mycenaeans were an example of the patriarchal and warlike Indo European cultures that emerged on the mainland following waves of immigration between ca. 4400 and ca. 2900 B.C.E. Like some other islands in the Mediterranean, Crete was able to preserve Old European traditions for nearly two millennia longer than the mainland. 51 Nilsson reproduces only one Late Minoan image which he says might be a war god dess (Minoan-Mycenaean Religion, pp. 349-50, fig. 160). There is no certainty, however, that the enigmatic objects she carries are weapons. Apparently Nilsson chose that interpre tation because, like many others, he could not understand the lack of militarism among the Minoans. Anthropologist Ruby Rohrlich-Leavitt offers a possible explanation for it in her article "Women in Transition: Crete and Sumer," in Becoming Visible: Women in European History, ed. Renate Bridenthal and Claudia Koonz (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1977), pp. 36-59, which is the most comprehensive feminist analysis of Crete to date. 52 Patricia Martin Doyle reveals the contemporary relevance of this question when she discusses Erik Erikson's belief that the current threat of planetary annihilation derives essentially from the exclusion of women from image-making. See her "Women and Reli gion: Psychological and Cultural Implications," in Religion and Sexism: Images of Women in the Jewish and Christian Traditions, ed. Rosemary Radford Ruether (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1974), p. 23.</page><page sequence="13">Downing: Prehistoric Goddesses 19 Another type of Minoan goddess imagery brings this out even more clearly: the "bell-shaped" idols of household and palace shrines. There may be some cases where temples, or separate structures "set apart to be the abode of the deity,"53 can be identified, but the more obvious pattern in the archaeological record is of shrines and/or their contents found on every site (undifferentiated from other buildings). This led Martin Nilsson to argue that "not only every palace but private houses too had a [religious practice] of some kind."54 Nilsson suggests that the female deity connected with this "domestic" religion and imaged in the shrine idol was the precur sor of the Greek Athena, who was the "divine protectress of the town in general. All her special functions can easily be deduced from this general function."55 One of Athena's specialized functions for the Greeks, of course, was warfare; but Nilsson ascribes this aspect to developments in the Mycenaean period, when the town that she protected was a fortress. Athena was also, significantly, the Greek goddess of handicrafts, an activity in which the Minoans were specialists, and perhaps a legacy of her Minoan roots. Whether the structures housing her shrines were once family dwell ings (as Nilsson and some others seem to assume), clan homes, or grand ceremonial centers and storehouses, they were also workshops where Minoans could continue production in textiles, ceramics, and other media, through the wet Cretan winters. The Knossos Linear B record of Mistress Athena (a-ta-na-po-ti-ni-ja), strengthens Nilsson's already widely accepted argument for Athena's Minoan origins.56 However, it must be remembered that Linear B is Myce naean, the script used in the last few centuries of the Minoan civilization at Knossos in Crete and at Mycenaean sites on the Greek mainland. Its pres ence at Knossos may represent a military domination there, given the mar tial character of Mycenaean culture. In any case, its use at Knossos may include the names of Mycenaean deities as well as Minoan ones. Athena may or may not have been the name the Minoans used. But whatever she 53 Nilsson, Minoan-Mycenaean Religion, p. 77. 54 Ibid., p. 110. 55 Ibid., p. 501. 56 Ventris and Chadwick, Mycenaean Greek, p. 311. "Mistress" (po-ti-ni-ja) is found by itself too. Some see in it the appropriate title for "the Minoan mother goddess" (Stone, When God Was a Woman, pp. 50-51). The masculine form, "master," may be the root of the name Poseidon (Guthrie, Greeks and Their Gods, pp. 98-99), which also appears on the Knossos tablets (Ventris and Chadwick, Mycenaean Greek, pp. 311-12). In later Greek, the term for "master" came to mean "husband," suggesting the explanation that Poseidon means "husband of Earth" (ibid., p. 309). Does the name Poseidon in the Linear B indicate that the Cretan child-god (Diktaean Zeus) also grew up to be the consort of the goddess, following the pattern used by George Thomson in The Prehistoric Aegean to describe the emergence of male gods? However, "Master of Earth" conveys the idea of a forced marriage, or patriarchal marriage, which the Mycenaeans might have imposed on the Minoans. Evolutionary and revolutionary interpretations both seem possible.</page><page sequence="14">20 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion was called, she seems to be connected with household activities that in the Minoan civilization included much fine craftsmanship. Perhaps the skilled manual work involved in Minoan craftsmanship offers some explanation for the particular anthropomorphic imagery of the shrine idol. In this case, the anthropomorphism is limited to the head, torso, and raised arms of the goddess on a bell-shaped base. Breasts are indicated, but only schematically, often less realistically than the head, arms, and hands, as if only a mark of identification without any relevant function. It is the raised hands and often crowned head that are emphasized by the form. There is little of the nature/fertility motif in the context of this god dess, whether we rely on the Linear B data or not. The context emphasizes the technical relationship of the human community with its environment: the buildings they built and rebuilt over the centuries, and, very likely, the crafts they practiced in them. If there is a significant relation between Minoan goddess imagery and the sophisticated but benign technology that expresses a basic atti tude of world-acceptance, it lies not simply in the valorization of nature symbolized by the sacred form of woman. The relation is much more complex. The female deity is also seen as the one who teaches how to use and transform the gifts of nature in technologically sophisticated ways. A common corollary of the association of woman with nature impli cit in the nature/fertility motif is the positive disassociation of woman with culture. In the familiar nature vs. culture dichotomy, woman is associated with nature, and man is associated with culture.57 Rosemary Ruether used this dichotomy when she assumed that men were always in control of culture, so that men were the image-makers of the prehistoric goddesses, not women. She therefore discounts any suggestion that the switch from gynocentric to androcentric religious images corresponds to any switch from female to male political rule.58 As shown earlier, Jane Ellen Harrison used the woman/nature vs. man/culture dichotomy too, but in a very different way. She allowed that the female religious symbol corresponded to women's cultural control, but she undercut the legiti macy of this control by calling it false and based on magic, revealing her assumption that women could not gain cultural preeminence in any legitimate way. The Minoan example challenges the usefulness of the woman/nature 57 For a critical examination of this idea, see Sherry B. Ortner, "Is Female to Male as Nature Is to Culture?" in Woman, Culture and Society, ed. Michelle Zimbalist Rosaldo and Louise Lamphere (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1974), pp. 67-87. 58 Ruether, New Woman, New Earth, pp. 6-11. Actually, the earliest evidence for male political rule in Crete is in the Linear B wanax (Ventris and Chadwick, Mycenaean Greek, p. 120).The Mycenaeans may have imposed such a system in the final centuries at Knossos.</page><page sequence="15">Downing: Prehistoric Goddesses 21 vs. man/culture dichotomy for prehistoric goddess imagery. The Minoan sea-goddess and goddess of technology clearly operate in the cultural realm (and neither boats nor buildings are magical mirages). They dem onstrate the need for modes of understanding goddess imagery that are more thoroughly gynocentric than the set of assumptions surrounding the nature/fertility motif.59 Another cultural setting of goddess imagery emerges if Linear B data are used together with later Greek sources (but keeping in mind the mixture of Minoan and Mycenaean elements in Linear B). The name Erinys (e-ri-nu) found on the Knossos tablets is possibly a singular form of Erinyes, the female avenging deities of Greek literature.60 Aeschylus tells an interesting story about the Erinyes which makes the Linear B evidence very intriguing. The last play of Aeschylus' trilogy, the Ores teia, tells the story of their transformation from divine avengers of matricide and preservers of matrilineal social values to preservers of the patriarchal household of the city-state of Athens. The change from a matrilineal to a patrilineal social context is, of course, relevant to this inquiry. The classicist George Thomson has made the case that the vari ous Cretan tribes recorded in Homer were matrilineal.61 However, I want to focus attention here on the role of the Erinyes as avenger deities, and therein as divine preservers of social justice. The Erinys of Knossos may have been a deity of justice. If so, this broadens still further the cultural reference of Minoan goddess imagery. Minoan goddess imagery is found in so many contexts that Martin Nilsson, one of the few who have studied it closely, concludes that it rep resents a plurality of goddesses instead of one goddess with many aspects. The question is important, and I think there are arguments to be made for both the monotheistic and the polytheistic interpretations.62 59 Others, including Marija Gimbutas and Merlin Stone, who have closely studied prehis toric goddess imagery, share this view. Christine Downing expresses it in The Goddess: Mythological Images of the Feminine (New York: Crossroad, 1981), pp. 14-15: "The goddess was not associated only with fertility, whether agricultural or human, but was also viewed as creatress of all; she was spoken of as prophetess, as inventor, healer, and war rior." She was not a warrior goddess for the Minoans, however, and this is an important point because it has become almost axiomatic that the warrior aspect was one of the attri butes of the prehistoric goddess. 60 Ventris and Chadwick, Mycenaean Greek, pp. 306-7. 61 Thomson, Prehistoric Aegean, pts. 1 and 2. He also calls them "matriarchal." 62 There are several names of goddesses and/or queens preserved in post-Minoan Greek references, for example. Not only are there Eileithyia, Demeter, Athena, and, perhaps, Erinys, but also Leto, Britomartis, Diktynna, and through them Artemis (whom Homer calls "Mistress of Wild Animals"-an apt title for some of the seal-stone scenes), and Europa, Pasiphae, and Ariadne (Nilsson, Minoan-Mycenaean Religion, pp. 523ff.). (One of these names might serve better as a source for naming the civilization than Minos.) On the other hand, there is the overlapping set of symbols which tends to blur the distinctions that might be drawn between goddesses in the graphics. And there is the propensity in</page><page sequence="16">22 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion Whether one or many, however, the Minoan goddess functions in signifi cant cultural contexts that previous explanations of her worship do not generally account for. The social and economic functions distinguished in this inquiry deserve more attention because we tend to approach the Cretan material with a limiting set of assumptions about what goddess imagery might signify, We have yet to develop a gynocentric frame of reference of sufficient scope to understand how goddess imagery can be so pervasive in a civilization of the socioeconomic complexity and tech nological expertise of Minoan civilization. While scholars struggle to find adequate responses to these data, many people in our own complex and technological civilization have already begun responding, religiously. Feminists have been ferreting out all the information that archaeologists and classicists have provided about ancient goddesses like Athena,63 reflecting on the significance of the goddesses,64 and incorporating them in the liturgies of neopagan religious rituals and celebrations that are part of the "modern Pagan resurgence."65 It may be helpful to find out what goddesses signify to these people today in our search for new and more comprehensive approaches to the Cretan material. the Knossos tablets to make dedications pa-si-te-o-i = pdnsi theoi'i, "to all the gods," a tendency which is again strong in Hellenistic times a millennium later (Ventris and Chad wick, Mycenaean Greek, p. 303). I find it interesting that the two articles dealing with ancient goddesses in a recent issue of Canadian Woman Studies/Les cahiers de la femme dedicated to religion (vol. 5, no. 2 [1983]) take differing positions on the strengths and weaknesses of polytheism. 63 See, for example, Charlene Spretnak, Lost Goddesses of Early Greece: A Collection of Pre-Hellenic Myths (Boston: Beacon Press, 1978). An interest in goddess imagery in general seems to be on the rise. The market is now supporting at least three multicultural reference works: Merlin Stone, Ancient Mirrors of Womanhood, in 2 vols. (New York: New Sibylline Books, 1979); Patricia Monaghan, The Book of Goddesses and Heroines (New York: Dutton, 1981); Barbara G. Walker, The Woman's Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1983). 64 Two excellent philosophical articles on goddess religion are: Carol P. Christ, "Why Women Need the Goddess: Phenomenological, Psychological, and Political Reflections," in Womanspirit Rising: A Feminist Reader in Religion, ed. Carol P. Christ and Judith Plas kow (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1979), pp. 273-87; and Starhawk, "Ethics and Justice in Goddess Religion," in The Politics of Women's Spirituality, ed.

The search for ancient goddesses may be in part an attempt to lend the new rituals "the authority of tradition itself," which is often lacking in new religious movements.
