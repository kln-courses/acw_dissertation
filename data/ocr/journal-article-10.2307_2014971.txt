<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Fields and Methods of Knowledge. RAYMOND F. PIPER and PAUL W. WARD. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. 1929. Pp. xxv + 398 + xl. Beginnings are not always prophetic of endings. From Lucretius, who saw no value in anthropomorphism, to Bowne, who saw no value</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 715 in atomism, is a far cry; but this book begins by exalting the scien- tific attitude of Lucretius as enlightening and emancipating and ends by commending the personalism of Bowne as affording the proper key to reality. The transition between the two emphases is effected by means of a "humanized logic," also designated as a "philosophy of science," in which knowledge is shown to be possible only as the experience of a knowing subject (pp. 287, 288). Intended as a textbook for courses in orientation and logic, this syllabus presents, in three parts, a survey of the sciences, logic, and "other philosophical disciplines. " The treatment of the sciences fol- lows, with slight modifications, the order suggested by Comte, in which the sciences "become more and more vitally related to human welfare" (p. 290). The introductory chapter on "The Background of Knowledge" is succeeded by chapters on mathematics, the physi- cal sciences, biological science, psychology, history, and the social sciences, written (with the exception of Chapters II and III) by Professor Ward. The primary aim is apparently not, as in the Introduction to Reflective Thinking, by Columbia Associates in Philosophy, to contrast barren and fruitful methods of dealing with typical problems in the various sciences; nor, as in Chapter XIII of Burtt's Principles and Problems of Right Thinking, to treat the principles of scientific progress historically; but to define the various fields of knowledge, to indicate their relations to each other and their respective subdivisions, to point out some of the fundamental prob- lems, concepts, and viewpoints treated in them, and especially to discuss the principal methods that have been found effective in their development. Most of the chapters in Parts II and III (save those on thinking, observation, verification, and ethics) have been contributed by Pro- fessor Piper. The approach to logic is made through Professor Dewey's analysis of reflective thought, the subjects of the various chapters including: thinking, observation, judgment and inference, induction, deduction, verification, discovery, statistical methods, and the organization of knowledge. Attention is given to such elements of formal logic as propositional relations, the syllogism, and the main fallacies, as well as to such doctrinal viewpoints as William James's "will to believe" (which is rejected) ; but the discussions-both here and throughout-are necessarily brief, so brief as to seem to re- quire supplementary reading by the student for purposes of clarifi- cation. The methodology employed in the expositions of the various sciences reappears in the sketches of ethics, esthetics, the study of religion, and metaphysics. Philosophically, the fundamental strains running through the book are pragmatic and personalistic, the theis-</page><page sequence="3">716 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY tic assumption in the latter supplementing the humanistic standpoint common to both. The self is the most important concept. It is not regarded as "an original datum" by Ward, who defines it, in his out- line of ethics, as "the organization of impulses and drives which becomes the core of the individual's character as it develops" (p. 312). According to Piper, "the real self [as distinguished from the empirical and historical aspects of the self] may be conceived as an intelligent, willing, valuing agent which acts through a long history in multifarious specific ways in connection with a definite physical organism" (p. 367) ; it is tacitly implied in science (p. 376) ; it is one of the general conditions and implications of all thought (pp. 218, 287); it is essential to ethical (p. 312), esthetic (pp. 317, 334), religious (p. 352), and metaphysical theory (pp. 364-68, 373). Thus religion is defined as "man's search for a more secure and abundant life in a precarious world in which God is the greatest fact" (p. 343) ; and reality is described as "a community of selves together with the common phenomenal order they construct and know under the stimulating control of a supreme cosmic mind" (p. 365). The former definition, of course, involves the rejection of non-theistic types of religion as the latter involves the rejection, made more explicit, of naturalism, dualism, idealism (excepting per- sonal idealism), and realism in metaphysics (these "isms" are out- lined on pp. 358-65). While the syllabus contains much of value to all who are inter- ested in the growing literature on the logic of reflective thinking, its main appeal is to those who desire a textbook that is favorable to positive religious faith in the Liberal Protestant sense. The physical appearance of the book is of the first order, as is the material pre- sented in this introductory text, when judged in the light of its pur- pose. Illustrations, reference readings, questions and exercises, and a complete index add to the value of the work. RICHARD HoPr COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY.</page></plain_text>
