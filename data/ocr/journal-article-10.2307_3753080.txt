<plain_text><page sequence="1">A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF MYCO- LOGICAL ILLUSTRATION (HIGHER FUNGI)' Louis C. C. KRIEGER (WII'H PLATES 24-31) Every taxonomist will admit that illustrations are essential for the identification of many plants, and especially in the case of the fleshy, perishable fungi. To be really serviceable, how- ever, a picture must be truthful. This seems self-evident, yet, if we make a survey of the available mycological illustrations from the earliest times to the present, we find that this quality of truthfulness was slow to develop. One of the causes of this is to be found in the freedom of the illustrator in following his imagination and another in the technical difficulties. Like children, the old herbalists felt free to add fanciful em- bellishments to their pictures of plants. Porta's cuts are a good example. But the palm for nature-faking illustrating belongs to one Dr. Seger, who published (1671) under the name, Anthro- pomorphus, a cut of a "geaster," the open exoperidium of which discloses some miniature men and women, all apparently glad to glimpse the world after their imprisonment within the tissues of the plant (Pi. 24). In order to outdo the advocates of priority in nomenclature, our friend C. G. Lloyd of Cincinnati (I9o6b), has proposed (jocularly, of course, and under the nom de plume, "McGinty") to adopt Seger's name, Anthropomorphus, for the much later Geaster of Micheli (I729). (In parenthesis I may say that a super-conscientious systematist, in Europe, is said to have complained of his inability to find the name of this authority, "McGinty," in the literature of botany.) Another figure of Seger's, a Xylaria-like plant, would make a good il- lustration in a gynecological book. 1 An illustrated paper read before the Botanical Society of Washington (D. C.), December 6, 1921. 311</page><page sequence="2">MYCOLOGIA Technical difficulties were no less obstructive. The only means at the disposal of the early herbalists was wood-engraving, and that art had only just reached the stage where a black line instead of a white one was produced in printing. Colored repro- ductions were entirely out of the question, as only some crude Italian prints from wood-blocks-initial letters, and the like- were known. There were no scientific artists in those days. The authors employed ordinary artists; and artists, as you may have learned from contact with them, are constitutionally opposed to being held down by plain, unadorned facts. Even Leonardo da Vinci, certainly a scientific man, as well as one of the greatest artists, could not resist giving an ornamental twist to his draw- ings of plants, drawings which, doubtless, were done for their botanic interest alone. Let us outline chronologically the development of the principal technical means as employed by the mycologists in illustrating their works, from Clusius (I60I) to Boudier (Igo5b). The first period, that in which wood-engraving was the chief means of illustrating, embraces the fifteenth and sixteenth cen- turies. The wood-engraving practised by the artists of the herbalists was, as already indicated, a crude, black-line engraving. An outline-drawing was transferred to the smooth wood-block. With sharp instruments the surface was cut away everywhere except under the lines of the drawing. When completed, the block was held for printing as if it were type. In a more com- plex, shade-rendering form, in which white- and black-line en- graving are intermingled, this ancient and most serviceable art persisted until displaced by the modern halif-tone, some time in the early nineties of the last century. The second period, in which steel- and copper-engraving played the principal r6le in mycological book-illustration, began late in the seventeenth century and lasted until well into the nineteenth.2 In method of procedure it resembled the white-line engraving of the wood-engravers. The highly polished metal plate was cut into with suitable instruments to raise what is technically known 2 As a means of artistic expression, it was used as early as the fifteenth century. 312</page><page sequence="3">KRIEGER: HISTORY OF MYCOLOGICAL ILLUSTRATION 313 as a burr. This burr retained the ink for printing after the surface of the plate had been wiped clean. It is of interest that, as early as the year 1514, we find the great engraver, Albrecht Diirer, seeking a means of lightening the labors of engravers on metal. He had noticed that the armorers of his time produced the depressed, ornamental lines on cuirasses by employing acid mordants. It occurred to this wonderful man that the lines of a drawing might, similarly, be bitten into the metal, and a print made from ink left in the depressions. Diirer thus became the inventor of the art of pictorial: etching, the process which, cen- turies later, made possible the half-tone and the tri-color print. His celebrated etching on iron, entitled "The Cannon," is here produced (P1. 25). Unless colored by hand-as was the practice from Paulet (1793b) to the time of the invention of lithography by the Bavarian actor, Alois Senefelder, between I820 and I83--en- gravings were issued without colors. But, contemporaneously with Paulet, Bulliard (I780) contrived a process by which the colors were printed on the engravings. Just how this was done, I cannot say. Very likely it was a revival of the early Italian wood-block color-printing.3 Color-printing, as we commonly know it, before the advent of the tri-color process, was not intro- duced until Senefelder invented lithography. The third period, the lithographic period, began at first with black-and-white printing, the color being added by hand as had previously been done with engravings. Fitch's figures, in Berke- ley's "Outlines" (I860) and in Sarah Price's "Illustrations" (1864), are fine examples of hand-colored lithography; while the Scotchman, Greville, has left us a splendid set of hand-colored copper-engravings in his "Scottish Cryptogamic Flora" (1823). It was not long before lithographers printed in colors. This accomplished, the way was clear for a satisfactory, as well as a more rapid, printing of fungus-pictures in their natural colors, the degree of excellence depending upon the artist who made the original paintings, and upon the lithographer who transferred the 3 Weinmann had used a similar process in his "Phytanthoza icono- graphia" (I737b), the first work in which color was printed on engraved plates by "a new method." See Burch, Colour Printing (IgIob), p. 66.</page><page sequence="4">MYCOLOGIA pictures to the stone. When tri-color printing came, these two possible sources of error were reduced to one, namely to the artist's original painting. Yet, it must be stated, though we gained in the objective rendering of a colored original through the use of the tri-color process, we also lost very materially, and this for two reasons. First, tri-color printing, in order to counteract a certain dulling of colors4 inherent in the process, sometimes employs highly fugitive coal-tar dyes. Secondly, in order to obtain the best re- sults in printing, the surface of the paper must be extremely white and smooth, qualities that are secured by applying a coat of chalk. When one considers these two serious handicaps, it becomes a question whether this otherwise commendable process should be employed in reproductions that are to adorn works of high scientific value. We use and enjoy today the illustrated books of our predecessors who printed with comparatively safe colors on most enduring paper: our successors, centuries hence, will, I fear, have no such permanent, pictorial records of the work done by ourselves. The other processes commonly used today in the reproduction of drawings and photographs, the zinc and copper line-engraving, the half-tone, and the heliogravure, need not detain us as all are familiar with the results. Of the two processes, however, the half-tone and the heliogravure, the former is much theless dur- able, for the reason that, as in the tri-color process, chalk-coated paper is usually the surface for the print. The mesh, present in all half-tone reproductions, may also be urged as an objectionable feature when a hand-lens examination for morphological details becomes desirable (PI. 26). As examples of most satisfactory reproductions of photographs of fungi, the heliogravures issued a few years ago by the late Prof. E. T. Harper may be cited (I913, I914a, b, I916). Let us now take a glance at the principal fungus-works of the past three hundred years. The very early herbalists paid little attention to the fungi, merely repeating what we find in the 4 The blue and yellow colors, being complementaries, make a gray-green rather than a pure green. 314</page><page sequence="5">KRIEGER: HISTORY OF MYCOLOGICAL ILLUSTRATION 315 ancient Greek and Roman writters, Theophra.tus, Nikander, Pliny, Galen, and the rest. When there are figures, they are almost without exception extremely poor and almost useless. The earliest published illustrations of fungi that serve us today with any degree of satisfaction in the matter of generic and, in many cases, of specific determination are unquestionably those of Charles de l'Ecluse (Carolus Clusius) published by him in I60I in his work on Hungarian fungi (I60o). They are un- colored wood-cuts, rather clumsily done, but, for all that, suf- ficiently well characterized where common well-known species are shown. Much better and more serviceable in taxonomic work are the original water-color paintings from which the wood- cuts were made. These water-color pictures, done by an un- known artist working under the direction of Clusius' Hungarian friend and patron, Boldizsar de Batthyany, were published for the first time in colored, lithographic reproduction by Batthyany's countryman, Dr. Gyula de Istvanffi (Igoob), just 320 years after they were painted, a circumstance which encourages me to be- lieve that my own plates, now reposing in the Farlow collection, may yet see the light of day. The Istvanffi volume embraces 89 plates-not 9I, as the title- page declares. One of Dr. H. A. Kelly's5 book-dealers in Europe wrote to Istvanffi to have him explain the discrepancy. Istvanffi replied that it was due to a typographical error which he could not correct. The colored plates are so good that Istvanffi recognizes 112 of the I17 figures represented; and Reichardt (I876c) distin- guished 47 genera and Io2 species. Especially noteworthy are the figures of Morchella esculenta (P1. I), Russula foetens (P1. 8), Russula nigricans (PI. I3), Russula virescens (PI. 40), Amanita muscaria (PI. 28), Amanitopsis plumbea (P1. 31), Lepi- ota procera (P1. 58. Reproduced here, in black-and-white, in P1. 27), and Polyporus squamosus (P1. I9). One figure, that of Russula foetens, is so well done that the upper surface of the pileus distinctly shows where a slug ate through the substance 5 Editor's Note.-Mr. Krieger is associated with Dr. Howard A. Kelly, of Baltimore, in mycological and scientific artistic work.</page><page sequence="6">MYCOLOGIA down to the level of the gill-attachments. Altogether, the figures are painted with a freshness of observation that indicates no mean ability on the part of the artist who painted them. With the exception of Dr. Seger's aforementioned, copper- engraved figures of the anthropomorphic Geaster and the queer Xylaria, nothing of consequence appeared until Franciscus van Sterbeeck published his "Theatrum Fungorum" (I675). For the most part this book is a mere curiosity. Its coppei- engraved, uncolored figures are copies after Clusius, Seger, and others; indeed, both the Anthropomorphus and the Xylaria of Seger appear in re-engraved plates. A few are based on water- color drawings of his own finds. I wish to call attention to one of these, his figure of "Locellus," on P1. 15, at the letter "C" (P1. 28, A in this paper). Much has been written on this figure by Kickx (I842b), and by Van Bambeke (I905a, 19o8). The latter is inclined to regard it as a representation of the lower part of the stem of Morchella crassipes. A rather long, lacu- nosely-furrowed object of ovoid shape is shown. To me it suggests Peck's genus Underwoodia, a most remarkable discomy- cete of which E. T. Harper gave some good photographs in the Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club (I918b. See my P1. 28, B). In order to establish whether the two are identical or not, one would have to examine Sterbeeck's specimen for the presence of the hymenial layer, but, as the specimen has been long since lost, a further discussion is futile and unprofitable. Leveille (1855), in his re-issue of Paulet, figures the plant in color, and calls it Clathrus locellus, a name that seems to have escaped the indexers. Antedating Van Bambeke, he, too, refers it to Morchella, but to Morchella esculenta. Other attempts to identify Sterbeeck's figures are those of Istvanffi (I894b, c, I895b, c) and Britzelmayr (I894a). The poor quality of these engravings is to be wondered at as good workmen on copper were becoming plentiful about this time, the latter part of the seventeenth century. The reproduc- tion of Rubens' pictures had called forth a swarm of them; Rem- brandt, the master-etcher, must have exerted some influence on those about him; and Swammerdam was at work upon his marvel- lous drawings of the internal anatomy of the may-fly, published later by Boerhaave (I737a). 316</page><page sequence="7">KRIEGER: HISTORY OF MYCOLOGICAL ILLUSTRATION 317 In the eighteenth century things began to brighten. The evil effects of the Thirty-Years War of the previous century were disappearing; the coffers of the kings and of the merchants were again filling with gold; the men of science thrived. Vaillant certainly looks prosperous enough in the portrait-engraving that forms the frontispiece of his "Botanicon Parisiense" (1727). But few fungi are figured in this work. Peziza acetabulum is well done, and so, perhaps, is Cantharellus cibarius. The figure of Amranita phalloides, on P1. I4, recalls the fact that Vaillant is the author of the first fairly clear description of this deadliest of all agarics. The engravings, which were done by Claude Aub- riet, are uncolored and very fine in execution; yes, too fine, for they show a finish that manicures and bedizens nature into a kind of studied artificiality which must have pleased the artificial people of his time. Two years later (I729) appeared the work of the great Italian, Pier' Antonio Micheli, who was the first to point out definitely that fungi have reproductive bodies or spores. With the excep- tion of Robert Hooke's drawing of the teleutospore of a Phrag- midium (I665) and Marsigli's demonstration (1714) of the origin of fungi from mycelia, there is little in the literature before Micheli to indicate that fungi were anything more than freaks of nature produced by spontaneous generation or by thunderbolts, spooks, and the like. Micheli's epoch-making " Nova Plantarum Genera " (I729) changed the views of mycologists forever. Prof. A. H. R. Buller, of the University of Manitoba, pays a glowing tribute to this investigator in a paper entitled, "Micheli and the Dis- covery of Reproduction in Fungi" (1915). In some plates, carefully copied by Prof. Buller from the originals, are shown gills, tubes, cystidia, basidia, and spores, of agarics and boleti. The gill-fungi, described and illustrated by Micheli, have been critically reviewed by his countryman, Martelli (I884b), in the Nuovo Giornale Botanico Italiano. Before proceeding, I would also call your attention to a curious drawing in Marsigli's work, the "Generatione Fungorum" (I714). One of the plates represents some agarics-apparently a species of Coprinus-growing from water in a flask, the neck</page><page sequence="8">MYCOLOGIA of which is corked up, in truly modern, pure-culture style, with a plug of some fibrous material (P1. 29). It was not until 167 years later that a similar observation was made, by Dr. Farlow. In I88I, this eminent mycologist published an interesting account of the growth of a Coprinus on the surface of water contained in a glass jar that had stood for two months in his laboratory (I88Ic). To my knowledge, these two cases are the only ones on record where Basidiomycetes were found growing in or on water. But, to continue. Micheli's "Nova Plantarum Genera" was followed by Battarra's "Fungorum Agri Ariminensis Historia" (755), a work that fell short of the standard set by Micheli. To quote Persoon (I818), "In Battarra's time, the science of mycology had not yet acquired the impetus it exhibited later," that is, during his own time, at the end of the eighteenth and the early part of the nineteenth centuries. In Germany, during the years 1762 to I774, Jacob Christian Schaeffer was issuing that milestone of illustrative mycology, his "Fungi of Bavaria and the Palatinate" (1762). The plates (hand-colored copper-engrav- ings) are not particularly good, but important as one of the orig- inal sources for the figures of many well-known species. Per- soon, in I8oo (1. c.), re-issued the work without change. 1761 saw the beginning of the extensive "Flora Danica" (1761) in which Vahl, Muller, and others described and figured new species. This work, and the "Flora of the Netherlands" (the "Flora Batava," I8ooa), are performances, by small coun- tries, which few larger ones have imitated. In 1788 appeared James Bolton's "An History of Fungusses growing about Halifax" (1788), a work with wretched, hand- colored engravings, but with much historical significance, as is proven by the appearance, only last year, of Sartory and Maire's interesting and learned paper on the "Interpretation of Bolton's Plates" (I92ob). A veritable flood of illustrated mycological works was let loose from then on. In France, from 1786 to I798, we have Pierre Bulliard's colossal "Herbier de la France" (I780), with 602 admirably executed, color-printed (!) engravings; and Paulet's 318</page><page sequence="9">KRIEGER: HISTORY OF MYCOLOGICAL ILLUSTRATION 319 "Traite des Champignons" (I793b), with very inferior plates. Sowerby, in England, was publishing, from I795 to I815, the "Couloured Figures of English Fungi" (I795), which, with Greville's later " Scottish Cryptogamic Flora" (1823), represents the best that Britain has produced in the line of fungous illustra- tions-Cooke's "Illustrations" (I88Ib) notwithstanding.6 It must be noted here that Bulliard's set often lacks plates 6oi and 602. These were re-issued by Raspail (I840); and Letellier (I829b) began a continuation of the "Herbier" by publishing, without text, a series of plates numbered from 603 to 7Io. Letellier's series is extremely rare, and the illustrations are inferior to those of Bulliard. Still worse is a series of 425 plates by Captain Lucand, I88I to I896, also intended as a con- tinuation of Bulliard (I88Id). Paulet's "Traite" (I793b) is almost never to be had with its plates. Leveille, in 1855, therefore, re-issued the 207 numbers, with no improvement in quality (I855). With the dawn of the nineteenth century-in I8oI-systematic mycology had its real beginning. All mycologists will recall that, in I900, certain gentlemen of a conservative turn of mind as- sembled in the city of Brussels to fix a starting-point for the nomenclature of the fungi. After hearing the report of a com- mittee (19Ioa, c, d), it was decided to take as a starting-point Elias Fries' Systema Mycologicum (1821). Two years before, at the I908 meeting of the Botanical Society of America held in Baltimore, one voice, that of Prof. Elias J. Durand (Igoga, b), was raised in favor of Christian Heinrich Persoon's "Synopsis Methodica Fungorum" (I80I). Working in an attic in a poor quarter of Paris, this genius with infinite labor sifted the litera- ture of the ages and, for the first time, brought order out of chaos. One hundred and nine years later, a Botanical Congress refused to recognize his great work. It is to be hoped that there will yet be a real International Botanical Congress which will deal with this subject with more reason and justice. e Mr. Carlnton Rea's "Monograph of the British Basidiomyceteae," .the publication of which has just been announced, will undoubtedly add further luster to British illustrative mycology.</page><page sequence="10">MYCOLOGIA Persoon's "Synopsis" does not contain any colored illustra- tions, nor are there many plates in his two "Icones" (I798, I803), but such as we find display fine taste and careful work- manship. Of about the same quality are the illustrations which ornament the work of the Rev. Lewis David de Schweinitz, the first Amer- ican mycologist. Born in Bethlehem, Pa., this minister in the Moravian church issued, in 1822, his "Synopsis" of North Carolina fungi (1822), with two hand-colored copper plates. Previously, while studying in Germany, he had published, to- gether with his master, de Albertini, a work on the fungi of a district in Germany called "the Lausitz" (I805). Twelve co- ored plates, done by himself, accompany this publication. Before the time of de Schweinitz, little had been printed on the fungi of our country. The Rev. Miihlenberg's catalogues of Lancaster (Pa.) plants (I793a, 1799) contain mere lists, and Gronovius' "Flora Virginica," published in I739 and I743 (1739), notes a few collections by Dr. John Clayton, among them, Lycoperdon solidum, the " Tuckahoe" of the American Indians. De Schweinitz's life and scientific labors have been recently treated with loving care and painstaking thoroughness by Drs. Shear &amp; Stevens (I917). But, whereas de Schweinitz's auspi- cious beginnings in the mycology of this country bore no immediate fruits comparable with his own work, Europe, by contrast, was putting forth some important publications, many of them classics. Italy gives us Giovanni Larber, whose work of 2I hand-colored plates (1829a) I have not seen; Domenico Viviani's "Fungi d'Italia" (I834), with 6o hand-colored lithographs of passable quality; and (1835) Carlo Vittadini's masterpiece, the "Descri- zione dei Funghi Mangerecci." This work of 44 colored, en- graved plates shows, by its incisive seriousness, kinship with the performance of Micheli, Vittadini's great predecessor. Across the line, in Austria, things were stirring, too. About this time, Krombholz's 76 hand-colored "Naturgetreue Abbild- ungen der Schwamme" (183I) appeared in parts from 183I to I847. The figures in this rather comprehensive book are toler- ably well drawn, but much too crowded on the page, and the colors 320</page><page sequence="11">KRIEGER: HISTORY OF MYCOLOGICAL ILLUSTRATION 321 are merely dashed on. It is a bad practice to crowd figures on the page. Reference becomes difficult, and the individuality of the plants represented is lost in the general jumble. The fourth decade of the new century offers, first, a work which I have not seen, Harzer's 80 plates, issued during the years 1842 to 1845 (I842a). Then, from England, in 1847, we get Badham's exceedingly well written, but poorly illustrated, "Treatise on the Esculent Funguses" (I847a), a later edition of which appeared in I864, edited by Frederick Currey (1. c.). The first edition of the "Treatise" has 21 colored plates; the second, only 12. England, during this period, had also a woman mycol- ogist, Mrs. T. J. Hussey, who presented to the world one of the most charming mushroom books known, her "Illustrations of British Mycology' (1847b), published in two series of hand- colored lithographs, 140 plates in all. The second series, com- prising the last fifty plates, is very scarce. As we approach the second half of the nineteenth century, the representation of the mere outward appearance of the fungi no longer satisfied-the internal, microscopic structures, the life histories, the phylogenetic, parasitic, and symbiotic relationships, were engaging the attention of mycologists. Such men as the Tulasne brothers, de Bary, Brefeld, de Seynes, and a host of others, arose. In great detail, and with surpassing skill, the Tulasnes studied and illustrated the external and the internal structures of the Hypogaei (1851), the lichens (1852), the Tre- mellineae (I853), and the gastromycetous groups and genera, Nidulariaceae (1844), Lycoperdon, Bovista, Scleroderma, Poly- saccum, and Geaster (I842c, d, I843a, b), and the Ascomycetes (i86ib). I think it is safe to say that never again will such hand-work appear as we find reproduced in the stupendous mono- graphs issued by these two unassuming brothers. Commercial- ism has killed the possibility; men are no longer training their minds, eyes, and hands for such work-the art is dead! Along with these important investigational works, atlases of the greatest moment kept on appearing. For want of time, I can do little more than enumerate the best. First, and foremost, Elias Fries' "Icones" with 200 colored plates (I867), preceded</page><page sequence="12">MYCOLOGIA by his more popular " Sveriges Atliga och Giftiga Svampar " with 93 colored plates (I86Ia); Gillet's "Champignons de France" (1874) with nearly goo hand-colored lithographic drawings, which, because of the three systems of numbering, are difficult to consult (I876a, I898); Kalchbrenner's 40 plates of Hungarian species (I873b, I876b, I884a); the Rev. Bresadola's "Fungi Tridentini" of 217 colored lithos. (I88Ia); the same author's "Funghi Mangerecci e Velenosi dell' Europa Media" (I899a); Cooke's "Mycographia" (1875), his I I99 "Illustrations of British Fungi" (I88Ib), and his "Australian Fungi" (I892), all of which have become more useful through commentaries (899c, I907); Quelet's "Champignons du Jura et des Vosges" (1872) with its many supplements and 66 (?) plates; Barla's "Champignons de Nice" (I859), followed by his "Flore Myco- logique des Alpes Maritimes" (I888), together holding II2 col- ored plates; finally Lanzi's "Edible and Poisonous Fungi of Rome" (1894d), 131 hand-colored lithographs of only fair quality; and, Saunders and Smith's 48 colored plates (1871), part second of which was critically reviewed by the illustrious Fries (1873a). Also there was an interminable number of lesser works: Berke- ley's "Outlines" (I860), which has been called "a publisher's book "; Valenti-Serini's caricatures (he figures stems of Amanitas that look like designs for some new style of architectural column (I868b)); Leuba's figures on black backgrounds (1887); Richon and Roze's moderately good "Atlas" (I885); and Maximilian Britzelmayr's " Hymenomyceten aus Siid-Bayern" (I879, I895a), a work that Lloyd has justly pronounced, " the poorest excuse for an illustrated work on fungi" (I9I4c). The drawings are mere bedaubed, mimeographed, or zinc-plate figures, on plates of un- equal size, and in absolute disorder. Fortunately, Dr. von H6h- nel has furnished the suffering systematist with an index to this chaotic mass (I9o6a). Hollos' "Gastromyceten Ungarns" (I904) opens our century. If you wish' to see what a sorry show the tri-color product-at its worst-presents when compared with really excellent litho- graphic reproductions, look at Hollos' book, and then turn to Boudier! The 6oo magnificent, colored plates of Boudier's 322</page><page sequence="13">KRIEGER: HISTORY OF MYCOLOGICAL ILLUSTRATION 323 "Icones" (I9o5b) run a close second to the Tulasne chefs- d'oeuvre. It is a positive delight to use them; indeed, were all published plates like these, there would be little question as to the identity of species. In nearly every case he gives the plant in different stages of development; the sectional views are always included, as are also the microscopic details (P1. 30). Only 125 copies were printed, of which 115 were sold to the original sub- scribers. Eight copies were subscribed for in the United States. The subscription price for the entire work of three atlas volumes and one of text was $2Io.oo. Today, the price is rapidly ap- proaching $500.00. Since the appearance of Boudier's masterpiece one other color- illustrated work of scientific importance has been published, namely, Rev. Adalbert Ricken's "Die BlItterpilze Deutschlands" (IgIoe). lBoudier and Ricken are illustrations of the statement I made earlier, that the lithographic process, though producing the most durable results, has to contend with two variable factors, the artist and the lithographer. Given a good artist and a good lithographer, you get such work as Boudier's; with poor work- men, both on the paper and on the stone, you get Ricken's well- meant, but puerile, illustrations. In conclusion, I would like to point out how little has been done in this country in the matter of publishing colored illustrations of our rich fungous flora. First, we have de Schweinitz's early work (1822), already mentioned, with exactly two plates. Following him came the Rev. M. A. Curtis, who was urged by Asa Gray (I868a) to prepare a manual of the fungi of the United States. Nothing came of this. But, that Curtis seriously entertained the idea of publishing some comprehensive, illustrated manual of these plants, appears from statements made by E. R. Memminger (I905c) to the effect that Curtis actually left a fragmentary manuscript with illustrations. This is still in the possession of his children. Indeed, the only atlas of colored illustrations of the commoner species of our fleshy fungi is the one published by the late Prof. Charles Horton Peck (I895d), who, for upwards of forty years, was the State Botanist of New York. Professor Peck's illustra-</page><page sequence="14">MYCOLOGIA tions, botanically accurate though they be, are not much more than colored diagrams, with little of the appearance of nature about them. Other illustrations by this most eminent student of our species are scattered through the reports of the New York State Museum. A few plates have also been published by Pro- fessor Murrill, of the New York Botanical Garden (I909c), and by Miss Burlingham (I92I), all in the journal MYCOLOGIA. Mcllvaine's sketches in his " One Thousand American Fungi" (I900ooc) fall far short of even a half-respectable standard; and the few colored plates in Professor Atkinson's book (Igooa) are so bad that they were omitted from the later editions. Dr. Harkness' four colored plates in his paper on the Cali- fornian hypogaeous fungi (I899b) must not be'omitted, as well as my own plates, published last year in the National Geographic Magazine (I92oa, and P1. 31 in this paper). This short enumeration about completes the list of American colored figures of fungi to be found in our publications. Com- pared with the output of Europe,7 it is negligible. But there is a ray of hope; Dr. Kelly has asked me to revise, and supply with colored illustrations, Prof. Peck's monograph of the genus Boletus (1889), the revision to stand as a memorial of this great American botanist. I trust that it may be printed. BALTIMORE, MD. EXPLANATION OF PLATES P1. 24. Dr. Seger's "Anthropomorphus," described in I67I. P1. 25. "The Cannon." Etching on iron by Albrecht Diirer. P1. 26. (A) Photographic enlargement (about 7 diameters) of the helio- gravure reproduction shown in the upper left corner (a). A hand-lens exam- ination of a heliographic reproduction of a photograph is thus instructive to the systematic mycologist, it being possible to determine whether the dimidiate gills are attached to their longer neighbors, or not. The opposite is true of the reproduction (B) of the half-tone figure (b). P1. 27. Lepiota procera (Scop.) Pers. Photographic reproduction from the colored lithographic figure in Istvanffi's etudes et commentaires sur le code de l'escluse, pl. 58. The original of this figure was painted during the latter part of the sixteenth century, about 1580. See plate 31. P1. 28. (A) "Locellus," in Sterbeeck's "Theatrum Fungorum," pl. I5, at "C."
