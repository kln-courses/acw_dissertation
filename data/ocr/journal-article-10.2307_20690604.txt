Martinez-Agull?, Secretary of Embassy, as Secretaries, THE COURT, composed as above, delivers the following Judgment: 1. In 1958 the Belgian Government filed with the International Court of Justice an Application against the Spanish Government seeding reparation for damage allegedly caused to the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited, on account of acts said to be contrary to international law committed by organs of the Spanish State. After the filing of the Belgian Memorial and the submission of preliminary objections by the Spanish Government, the Belgian Government gave notice of discontinuance of the proceedings, with a view to negotiations between the representatives of the private interests concerned. The case was removed from the Court1s General list on 10 April 196I. 2. On 19 June 1962, the negotiations having failed, the Belgian Government submitted to the Court a new Application, claiming reparation for the damage allegedly sustained by Belgian nationals, shareholders in the Barcelona Traction company, on account of acts said to be contrary to international law committed in respect of the company by organs of the Spanish State. On 15 March I963 the Spanish Government raised four preliminary objections to the Belgian Application. 3. By its Judgment of 24 July 1964, the Court rejected the first two preliminary objections. The first was to the effect that the discontinuance, under Article 69, paragraph 2, of the Court's Rules, of previous proceedings relative to the same events in Spain, disentitled the Belgian Government from bringing the present proceedings. The second was to the effect that even if this was not the case, the Court was not competent, because the necessary jurisdictional basis requiring Spain to submit to the jurisdiction of the Court did not exist. The Court joined the third and fourth objections to the merits. The third was to the effect that the claim is inadmissible because the Belgian Government lacks any jus standi to intervene ?r make a judicial claim on behalf of Belgian interests in a Canadian company, assuming that the Belgian character of such interests were established, which is denied by the Spanish Government. The fourth was to the effect that even if the Belgian Government has the necessary jus standi, the claim still Remains inadmissible because local remedies in respect of the acts complained of were not exhausted.</page><page sequence="6">232 4. Time-limits for the filing of the further pleadings were fixed or, at the request of the Parties, extended by Orders of 28 July 1964, 11 June 1965, 12 January 1966, 23 November 1966, 12 April I967, 15 September I967 and 24 May I968, in the last-mentioned of which the Court noted with regret that the time-limits originally fixed by the Court for the filing of the pleadings had not been observed, whereby the written proceedings had been considerably prolonged. The written proceedings finally came to an end on 1 July I968 with the filing of the Rejoinder of the Spanish Government. 5. Pursuant to Article 31, paragraph 3, of the Statute&gt; Mr. Willem Riphagen, Professor of International Lav/ at the Rotterdam School of Economics, and Mr. Enrique C. Armand-Ugon, former President of the Supreme Court of Justice of Uruguay and a former Member of the International Court of Justice, were chosen by the Belgian and Spanish Governments respectively to sit as judges ad hoc. 6. Pursuant to Article 44, paragraph 2, of the Rules of Court, the pleadings and annexed documents were, after consultation of the Parties, made available to the Governments of Chile, Peru and the United States of America. Pursuant to paragraph j5 of the same Article, the pleadings and annexed documents were, with the consent of the Parties, made accessible to the public as from 10 April 1969? 7. At 64 public sittings held between 15 April and 22 July I969 the Court heard oral arguments and replies by Chevalier Devadder, Agent, Mr. Rolin, co-Agent and Counsel, Mrs* Bastid, Mr. Van Ryn, Mr. Gr?goire, Mr. Mann, Mr. Virally, Mr. Lauterpacht, and Mr. Pattillo, Counsel, on behalf of the Belgian Government and by Mr. Castro-Rial, Agent, Mr. Ago, Mr. Carreras, Mr. Gil-Robles, Mr. Guggenheim, Mr. Jim?nez de Ar?chaga, Mr. Malintoppi, Mr. Reuter, Mr. Sureda, Mr. Uria, Sir Humphrey Waldock and Mr. Weil, Counsel or Advocates, on behalf of the Spanish Government. 8. The Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited, is a holding company incorporated in I9II in Toronto (Canada), where it has its head office. For the purpose of creating and developing an electric power production and distribution system in Catalonia (Spain), it formed a number of operating, financing and concession-holding subsidiary companies. Three of these companies, whose shares it owned wholly or almost wholly, were incorporated under Canadian law and had their registered offices in Canada (Ebro Irrigation and Power Company, Limited, Catalonian Land Company, Limited and International Utilities Finance Corporation, Limited)] the others were incorporated under Spanish law and had their registered offices in Spain. At the time of the outbreak of the Spanish civil war the group, through its operating subsidiaries, supplied the major part of Catalonia's electricity requirements. 9? According to the Belgian Government, some years after the first world war Barcelona Traction's share capital came to be very largely</page><page sequence="7">233 held by Belgian nationals - natural or juristic persons - and a very high percentage of the shares has since then continuously belonged to Belgian nationals, particularly the Soci?t? Internationale d'Energie Hydro-Electrique (Sidro), whose principal shareholder, the Soci?t? Financi?re de Transports et d'Entreprises Industrielles (S?fina), is itself a company in which Belgian interests are preponderant. The fact that large blocks of shares were for certain periods transferred to American nominees, to protect these securities in the event of invasion of Belgian territory during the second world war, is not, according to the Belgian contention, of any relevance in this connection, as it was Belgian nationals, particularly Sidro, who continued to be the real owners. For a time the shares were vested in a trustee, but the Belgian Government maintains that the trust terminated in 1946. The Spanish Government contends, on the contrary, that the Belgian nationality of the shareholders is not proven and that the trustee or the nominees must be regarded as the true shareholders in the case of the shares concerned. 10. Barcelona Traction issued several series of bonds, some in pesetas but principally in sterling. The issues were secured by trust deeds, with the National Trust Company, Limited, of Toronto as trustee of the sterling bonds, the security consisting essentially of a charge on bonds and shares of Ebro and other subsidiaries and of a mortgage executed by Ebro in favour of National Trust. The sterling bonds were serviced out of transfers to Barcelona Traction effected by the subsidiary companies operating in Spain. 11. In 1936 the servicing of the Barcelona Traction bonds was suspended on account of the Spanish civil war. In 1940 payment of interest on the peseta bonds was resumed with the authorization of the Spanish exchange control authorities (required because the debt was owed by a foreign company), but authorization for the transfer of the foreign currency necessary for the servicing of the sterling bonds was refused and those interest payments were never resumed. 12. In 1945 Barcelona Traction proposed a plan of compromise which provided for the reimbursement of the sterling debt. When the Spanish authorities refused to authorize the transfer of the necessary foreign currency, this plan was twice modified. In its final form, the plan provided inter alia for an advance redemption by Ebro of Barcelona Traction peseta bonds, for which authorization was likewise required. Such authorization was refused by the Spanish authorities. Later, when the Belgian Government complained of the refusals to authorize foreign currency transfers, without which the debts on the bonds could not be honoured, the Spanish Government stated that the transfers could not be authorized unless it was shown that the foreign currency was to be used to repay debts arising from the genuine importation of foreign capital into Spain, and that this had not been established. 13? On 9 February 1948 three Spanish holders of recently acquired Barcelona Traction sterling bonds petitioned the court of Reus (Province of Tarragona) for a declaration adjudging the company bank rupt, on account of failure to pay the interest on the bonds. The petition was admitted by an order of 10 February 1948 and a judgment declaring the company bankrupt was given on 12 February. This judg ment included provisions appointing a commissioner in bankruptcy and</page><page sequence="8">234 an interim receiver and ordering the seizure of the assets of Barcelona Traction, Ebro and Compa??a Barcelonesa de Electricidad, another subsidiary company. 14. The shares of Ebro and Barcelonesa had been deposited by Barcelona Traction and Ebro with the National Trust company of Toronto as security for their bond issues. All the Ebro and the Barcelonesa ordinary shares were held outside Spain, and the possession taken of them was characterized as "mediate and constructive civil possession", that is to say was not accompanied by physical possession. Pursuant to the bankruptcy judgment the commissioner in bankruptcy at once dis missed the principal management personnel of the two companies and during the ensuing weeks the interim receiver appointed Spanish directors and declared that the companies were thus "normalized". Shortly after the bankruptcy judgment the petitioners brought about the extension of the taking of possession and related measures to the other subsidiary companies. 15. Proceedings in Spain to contest the bankruptcy judgment and the related decisions were instituted by Barcelona Traction, National Trust, the subsidiary companies and their directors or management personnel. However, Barcelona Traction, which had not received a judicial notice of the bankruptcy proceedings, and was not represented before the Reus court in February, took no proceedings in the courts until 18 June 19^8. In particular it did not enter a plea of opposition against the bankruptcy judgment within the time-limit of eight days from the date of publication of the judgment laid down in Spanish legislation. On the grounds that the notification and publication did not comply with the relevant legal requirements, the Belgian Government contends that the eight-day time-limit had never begun to run. 16. Motions contesting the jurisdiction of the Reus court and of the Spanish courts as a whole, in particular by certain bondholders, had a suspensive effect on the actions for redress; a decision on the question of jurisdiction was in turn delayed by lengthy proceedings brought by the Genora company, a creditor of Barcelona Traction, dis puting Barcelona Traction's right to be a party to the proceedings on the jurisdictional issue. One of the motions contesting jurisdiction was not finally dismissed by the Barcelona court of appeal until 1963* after the Belgian Application had been filed with the International Court of Justice. 17. In June 19^9* on an application by the Namel company, with the intervention of the Genora company, the Barcelona court of appeal gave a judgment making it possible for the meeting of creditors to be con vened for the election of the trustees in bankruptcy, by excluding the necessary procedure from the suspensive effect of the motion contesting jurisdiction. Trustees were then elected, and procured decisions that new shares of the subsidiary companies should be created, cancelling the shares located outside Spain (December 19^9)* and "that the head offices of Ebro and Catalonian Land should henceforth be at Barcelona and not Toronto. Finally in August 1951 the trustees obtained court authorization to sell "the totality of the shares, with all the rights attaching to them, representing the corporate capital" of the subsidiary companies, in the form of the newly-created share-certificates.</page><page sequence="9">235 The sale took place, by public auction on 4 January 1952 on the basis of a set of General Conditions and became effective on 17 June 1952. The purchaser was a newly-formed company, Fuerzas El?ctricas de Catalu?a, S.A. (Fecsa), which thereupon acquired complete control of the undertaking in Spain. 18. Proceedings before the court of Reus, various courts of Barcelona and the Spanish Supreme Court, to contest the sale and the operations which preceded or followed it, were taken by, among others, Barcelona Traction, National Trust and the Belgian company Sidro as a shareholder in Barcelona Traction, but without success. According to the Spanish Government, up to the filing of the Belgian Application, 2,736 orders had been made in the case and 494 judgments given by lower and 37 by higher courts. For the purposes of this Judgment it is not necessary to go into these orders and judgments. 19. After the bankruptcy declaration, representations were made to the Spanish Government by the British, Canadian, United States and Belgian Governments. 20. The British Government made representations to the Spanish Government on 23 February 1948 concerning the bankruptcy of Barcelona Traction and the seizure of its assets as well as those of Ebro and Barcelonesa, stating its interest in the situation of the bondholders resident in the United Kingdom. It subsequently supported the representations made by the Canadian Government. 21. The Canadian Government made representations to the Spanish Government in a series of diplomatic notes, the first being dated 27 March 1948 and the last 21 April 1952] in addition, approaches were made on a less official level in July 1954 and March 1955? The Canadian Government first complained of the denials of justice said to have been committed in Spain towards Barcelona Traction, Ebro and National Trust, but it subsequently based its complaints more particu larly on conduct towards the Ebro company said to be in breach of certain treaty provisions applicable between Spain and Canada. The Spanish Government did not respond to a Canadian proposal for the sub mission of the dispute to arbitration and the Canadian Government subsequently confined itself, until the time when its interposition entirely ceased, to endeavouring to promote a settlement by agreement between the private groups concerned. 22. The United States Government made representations to the Spanish Government on behalf of Barcelona Traction in a note of 22 July 1949, in support of a note submitted by the Canadian Government the previous day. It subsequently continued its interposition through the diplo matic channel and by other means. Since references were made by the United States Government in these representations to the presence of American, interests in Barcelona Traction, the Spanish Government draws the conclusion that, in the light of the customary practice of the United States Government to protect only substantial American investments abroad, the existence must be presumed of such large American interests as to rule out a preponderance of Belgian interests. The Belgian Government considers that the United States Government was motivated by a more general concern to secure equitable treatment</page><page sequence="10">236 of foreign investments in Spain, and in this context cites inter alia a note of 5 June 1967 from the United States Government. 23? The Spanish Government having stated in a note of 26 September 1949 that Ebro had not furnished proof as to the origin and genuineness of the bond debts, which justified the refusal of foreign currency transfers, the Belgian and Canadian Governments considered proposing to the Spanish Government the establishment of a tripartite committee to study the question. Before this proposal was made, the Spanish Government suggested in March 1950 the creation of a committee on which, in addition to Spain, only Canada and the United Kingdom would be represented. This proposal was accepted by the United Kingdom and Canadian Governments. The work of the committee led to a joint statement of 11 June 1951 by the three Governments to the effect, inter alia, that the attitude of the Spanish administration in not authorizing the transfers of foreign currency was fully justified. The Belgian Government protested against the fact that it had not been invited to nominate an expert to take part in the enquiry, and reserved its rights; in the proceedings before the Court it contended that the joint statement of 1951 s which was based on the work of the committee, could not be set up against it, being res inter aiios acta. 24. The Belgian Government made representations to the Spanish Government on the same day as the Canadian Government, in a note of 27 March 1948. It continued its diplomatic intervention until the rejection by the Spanish Government of a Belgian proposal for sub mission to arbitration (end of 1951). After the admission of Spain to membership in the United Nations (1955), which, as found by the Court in 1964, rendered operative again the clause of compulsory jurisdiction contained in the 1927 Hispano-Belgian Treaty of Conciliation. Judicial Settlement, and Arbitration, the Belgian Government attempted further representations. After the rejection of a proposal for a special agreement, it decided to refer the dispute unilaterally to this Court. 2'5l . In the course of the written proceedings, the following submissions were presented by the Parties : On behalf of the Belgian Government, in the Application: "May it please the Court 1. to adjudge and declare that the measures, acts, decisions and omissions of the organs of the Spanish State described in the present Application are contrary to international law and that the Spanish State is under an obligation towards Belgium to make reparation for the consequential damage suffered by Belgian nationals, natural and juristic persons, shareholders in Barcelona Traction; 2. to adjudge and declare that this reparation should, as far as possible, annul all the consequences which these acts contrary to international law have had for the said nationals, and that the Spanish State is therefore under an obligation to secure, if possible,</page><page sequence="11">237 the annulment of the adjudication in bankruptcy and of the judicial and other acts resulting therefrom, obtaining for the injured Belgian nationals all the legal effects which should result for them from this annulmentj further, to determine the amount of the compensation to be paid by the Spanish State to the Belgian State by reason of all the incidental damage sustained by Belgian nationals as a result of the acts complained of, including the deprivation of enjoyment of rights and the expenses incurred in the defence of their rights, 3. to adjudge and declare, in the event of the annulment of the consequences of the acts complained of proving impossible, that the Spanish State shall be under an obligation to pay to the Belgian State, by way of compensation, a sum equivalent to 88 per cent, of the net value of the business on 12 February 1948; this compensation to be increased by an amount corresponding to all the incidental damage suffered by the Belgian nationals as the result of the acts complained of, including the deprivation of enjoyment of rights and the expenses incurred in the defence of their rights"; in the Memorial: "May it please the Court I. to adjudge and declare that the measures, acts, decisions and omissions of the organs of the Spanish State described in the present Memorial are contrary to international law and that the Spanish State is under an obligation towards Belgium to make reparation for the consequential damage suffered by Belgian nationals, natural and juristic persons, shareholders in Barcelona Traction1 II. to adjudge and declare that this reparation should, as far as possible, annul all the consequences which these acts contrary to international law have had for the said nationals, and that the Spanish State is therefore under an obligation to secure, if possible, the annulment by administrative means of the adjudication in bankruptcy and of the judicial and other &amp;cts resulting therefrom, obtaining for the said injured Belgian nationals all the legal effects which should result for them from this annulment; further, to determine the amount of the compensation to be paid by the Spanish State to the Belgian State by reason of all the incidental damage sustained by Belgian nationals as a result of the acts complained of, including the deprivation of enjoyment of rights and the expenses incurred in the defence of their rights; III. to adjudge and declare, in the event of the annulment of the consequences of the acts complained of proving impossible, that the Spanish State shall be under an obligation to pay to the Belgian State, by way of compensation, a sum equivalent to 88 per cent, of the sum of $88,600,000 arrived at in paragraph 379 of the present Memorial, this compensation to be increased by an amount corresponding to all the incidental damage suffered by the said Belgian nationals as the result of the acts complained of, including the deprivation of enjoyment of rights, the expenses incurred in the defence of their rights and the equivalent in capital and interest of the amount of Barcelona Traction bonds held by Belgian nationals and of their</page><page sequence="12">238 other claims on the companies in the group which it was not possible to recover owing to the acts complained of"; in the Reply: t!May it please the Court, rejecting any other submissions of the Spanish State which are broader or to a contrary effect, to adjudge and declare (1) that the Application of the Belgian Government is admissible; (2) that the Spanish State is responsible for the damage sustained by the Belgian State in the person of its nationals, shareholders in Barcelona Traction, as the result of the acts contrary to international law committed by its organs, which led to the total spoliation of the Barcelona Traction group; (3) that the Spanish State is under an obligation to ensure reparation of the said damage; that this damage can be assessed at U.S. $78,000,000, representing 88 per cent, of the net value, on 12 February 1948, of the property of which the Barcelona Traction group was despoiled; (5) that the Spanish State is, in addition, under an obligation "to pay, as an all-embracing payment to cover loss of enjoyment, compensatory interest at the rate of 6 per cent, on the said sum of U.S. $78,000,000, from 12 February 1948 to the date of judgment; (6) that the Spanish State must, in addition, pay a sum provisionally assessed at U.S. $3,800,000 to cover the expenses incurred by the Belgian nationals in defending their rights since 12 February 1948; (7) that the Spanish State is also liable in the sum of ?433,821 representing the amount, in principal and interest, on 4 January 1952, of the Barcelona Traction sterling bonds held by the said nationals, as well as in the sum of U.S. $1,623,127, representing a debt owed to* one of the said nationals by a subsidiary company of Barcelona Traction, this sum including lump sum compensation for loss of profits resulting from the premature termination of a contract; that there will be due on those sums interest at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum, as from 4 January 1952 so far as concerns the sum of ?433,821, and as from 12 February 1948 so far as concerns the sum of U.S. $1,623,127; both up to the date of judgment; (8) that the Spanish State is also liable to pay interest, by way of interest on a sum due and outstanding, at a rate to be determined by reference to the rates generally prevailing, on the amount of compensation awarded, from the date of the Court's decision fixing such compensation up to the date of payment; (9) in the alternative to submissions (4) to (6) above, that the amount of the compensation due to the Belgian State shall be</page><page sequence="13">239 established by means of an expert enquiry to be ordered by the Court; and to place on record that the Belgian Government reserves its. right to submit in the course of the proceedings such observations as it may deem advisable concerning the object and methods of such measure of investigation; (10) and, should the Court consider that it cannot, without an expert enquiry, decide the final amount of the compensation due to the Belgian State, have regard to the considerable magnitude of the damage caused and make an immediate award of provisional compensation, on account of the compensation to be determined after receiving the expert opinion, the amount of such provisional compensation being left to the discretion of the Court." On behalf of the.Spanish Government, in the Counter-Memorial: "May it please the Court to adjudge and declare I, that the Belgian claim which, throughout the diplomatic correspondence and in the first Application submitted to the Court, has always been a claim with a view to the protection of the Barcelona Traction company, has not changed its character in the second Application, whatever the apparent modifications introduced into it; that even if the true subject of the Belgian claim were, not the Barcelona Traction company, but those whom the Belgian Government characterizes on some occasions as 'Belgian shareholders' and on other occasions as 'Belgian interests ' in that company, and the damage allegedly sustained by those 'shareholders' or^interests', it would still remain true that the Belgian Government has not validly proved either that the shares of the company in question belonged on the material dates to 'Belgian shareholders', or, moreover, that there is in the end, in the case submitted to the Court, a preponderance of genuine 'Belgian interests'; that even if the Belgian claim effectively had as its beneficiaries alleged 'shareholders' of Barcelona Traction who were 'Belgian', or yet again alleged genuine 'Belgian interests' of the magnitude which is attributed to them, the general principles of international law governing this matter, confirmed by practice which knows of no exception, do not recognize that the national State of shareholders or 'interests', whatever their number or magnitude, may make a claim on their behalf in reliance on allegedly unlawful damage sustained by the company, which possesses the nationality of a third State; that the Belgian Government therefore lacks jus standi in the present case; II. that a rule of general international law, confirmed both by judicial precedents and the teachings of publicists, and reiterated in Article 3&gt; of the Treaty of Conciliation, Judicial Settlement and</page><page sequence="14">240 Arbitration of 19 July I927 between Spain and Belgium, requires that private persons allegedly injured by a measure contrary to international law should have used and exhausted the remedies and means of redress provided by the internal legal order before diplomatic, and above all judicial, protection may be exercised on their behalf; that the applicability of this rule to the present case has not been disputed and that the prior requirement which it lays down has not been satisfied; III? that the organic machinery for financing the Barcelona Traction undertaking, as conceived from its creation and constantly applied thereafter, placed it in a permanent state of latent bankruptcy, and that the constitutional structure of the group and the relationship between its members were used as the instrument for manifold and ceaseless operations to the detriment both of the interests of the creditors and of the economy and law of Spain, the country in which the undertaking was to carry on all its business; that these same facts led, on the part of the undertaking, to an attitude towards the Spanish authorities which could not but provoke a fully justified refusal to give effect to the currency applications made to the Spanish Government; that the bankruptcy declaration of 12 February 19^8, the natural outcome of the conduct of the undertaking, and the bankruptcy proceedings which ensued, were in all respects in conformity with the provisions of Spanish legislation on the matter; and that moreover these provisions are comparable with those of other statutory systems., in particular Belgian legislation itself; that the complaint of usurpation of jurisdiction is not well founded where the bankruptcy of a foreign company is connected in any way with the territorial jurisdiction of the State, that being certainly so in the present case; that the Spanish judicial authorities cannot be accused of either one or more denials of justice in the proper sense of the term, Barcelona Traction never having been denied access to the Spanish courts and the judicial decisions on its applications and appeals never having suffered unjustified or unreasonable delays; nor is it possible to detect in the conduct of the Spanish authorities the elements of some breach of international law other than a denial of justice; that the claim for reparation, the very principle of which is disputed by the Spanish Government, is moreover, having regard to the circumstances of the case, an abuse of the right of diplomatic protection in connection with which the Spanish Government waives none of its possible rights; IV? that, therefore, the Belgian claim is dismissed as inadmissible or, if not, as unfounded"; in the Rejoinder:</page><page sequence="15">241 "May it please the Court to adjudge and declare that the claim of the Belgian Government is declared inadmissible or, if not, unfounded." In the course of the oral proceedings, the following text was presented as final submissions on behalf of the Belgian Government, after the hearing of 9 July I969: "1. Whereas the Court stated on page 9 of its Judgment of 24 July 1964 that 'The Application of the Belgian Government of 19 June I962 seeks reparation for damage claimed to have been caused to a number of Belgian nationals, said to be shareholders in the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited, a company under Canadian law, by the conduct, alleged to have been contrary to international law, of various organs of the Spanish State in relation to that company and to other companies of its group1; Whereas it was therefore manifestly wrong of the Spanish Government, in the submissions in the Counter-Memorial and in the oral arguments of its counsel, to persist in the contention that the object of the Belgian claim is to protect the Barcelona Traction company; 2. Whereas Barcelona Traction was adjudicated bankrupt in a judgment rendered by the court of Reus, in Spain, on 12 February 19^8; 3. Whereas that holding company was on that date in a perfectly sound financial situation, as were its subsidiaries, Canadian or Spanish companies having their business in Spain; 4. Whereas, however, the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War had, from I936 to 1944, prevented Barcelona Traction from being able to receive, from its subsidiaries operating in Spain, the foreign currency necessary for the service of the sterling loans issued by it for the financing of the group's investments in Spain; 5. Whereas, in order to remedy this situation, those in control of Barcelona Traction agreed with the bondholders in 1945, despite the opposition of the March group, to a plan of compromise, which was approved by the trustee and by the competent Canadian court; and whereas its implementation was rendered impossible as a result of the opposition of the Spanish exchange authorities, even though the method of financing finally proposed no longer involved any sacrifice of foreign currency whatever for the Spanish economy; 6. Wh?reas, using this situation as a pretext, the March group, which in the meantime had made further considerable purchases of bonds, sought and obtained the judgment adjudicating Barcelona Traction bankrupt;</page><page sequence="16">242 7. Whereas the bankruptcy proceedings were conducted in such a manner as to lead to the sale to the March group, which took place on 4 January 1952, of all the assets of the bankrupt company, far exceeding in value its liabilities, in consideration of the assumption by the purchaser itself of solely /the bonded debt, which, by new purchases, it had concentrated into its own hands to the extent of approximately 85 per cent., while the cash price paid to the trustees in bankruptcy, 10,000,000 pesetas - approximately $250,000 -, being insufficient to cover the bankruptcy costs, did not allow them to pass anything to the bankrupt company or its shareholders, or even to pay its unsecured creditors; 8. Whereas the accusations of fraud made by the Spanish Government against the Barcelona Traction company and the allegation that that company was in a permanent state of latent bankruptcy are devoid of all relevance to the case and, furthermore, are entirely unfounded; 9. Whereas the acts and omissions giving rise to the responsibility of the Spanish Government are attributed by the Belgian Government to certain administrative authorities, on the one hand, and to certain judicial authorities, on the other hand; Whereas it is apparent when those acts and omissions are examined as a whole that, apart from the defects proper to each, they converged towards one common result, namely the diversion of the bankruptcy procedure from its statutory purposes to the forced transfer, without compensation, of the undertakings of the Barcelona Traction group to the benefit of a private Spanish group, the March group; I ABUSE OP RIGHTS, ARBITRARY AND DISCRIMINATORY ATTITUDE OP CERTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITIES Considering that the Spanish administrative authorities behaved in an improper, arbitrary and discriminatory manner towards Barcelona Traction and its shareholders, in that, with the purpose of facilitating the transfer of control over the property of the Barcelona Traction group from Belgian hands into the hands of a private Spanish group, they in particular - (a) frustrated, in October and December 1946, the implementation of the third method for financing the plan of compromise, by refusing to authorize Ebro, a Canadian company with residence in Spain, to pay 64,0*0,000 pesetas in the national currency to Spanish residents on behalf Tlarcelona Traction, a non-resident company, so that the latter might redeem its peseta bends circulating in Spain, despite the fact that Ebro continued uninterruptedly to be granted periodical authorization to pay the interest on those same bends up to the time of the bankruptcy;</page><page sequence="17">243 (b) on the other hand, accepted that Juan March, a Spanish citizen manifestly resident in Spain, should purchase considerable quantities of Barcelona Traction sterling bonds abroad; (c) made improper use of an international enquiry,from which the Belgian Government was excluded, by gravely distorting the purport of the conclusions of the Committee of Experts, to whom they attributed the finding of irregularities of all kinds such as to entail severe penalties for the Barcelona Traction group, which enabled the trustees in bankruptcy, at March1s instigation, to bring about the premature sale at a ridiculously low price of the assets of the Barcelona Traction group and their purchase by the March group thanks to the granting of all the necessary exchange authorizations; II USURPATION OP JURISDICTION Considering that the Spanish courts, in agreeing to entertain the bankruptcy of Barcelona Traction, a company under Canadian law with its registered office in Toronto, having neither registered office nor commercial establishment in Spain, nor possessing any property or carrying on any business there, usurped a power of jurisdiction which was not theirs in international law; Considering that the territorial limits of acts of sovereignty were patently disregarded in the measures of enforcement taken in respect of property situated outside Spanish territory without the concurrence of the competent foreign authorities; Considering that there was, namely, conferred upon the bankruptcy authorities, through the artificial device of mediate and constructive civil possession, the power to exercise in Spain the rights attaching to the shares located in Canada of several subsidiary and sub-subsidiary companies on which, with the approval of the Spanish judicial authorities, they relied for the purpose of replacing the directors of those companies, modifying their terms of association, and cancelling their regularly issued shares and re placing them with others which they had printed in Spain and delivered to Pecsa at the time of the sale of the bankrupt company's property, without there having been any effort to obtain possession of the real shares in a regular way; Considering that that disregard is the more flagrant in that three of the subsidiaries were companies under Canadian law with their registered offices in Canada and that the bankruptcy authorities purported, with the approval of the Spanish judicial authorities, to transform two of them into Spanish companies, whereas such alteration is not permitted by the law governing the status of those companies;</page><page sequence="18">244 III DENIALS OF JUSTICE LATO SENSU Considering that a large number of decisions of the Spanish courts are vitiated by gross and manifest error in the application of Spanish law, by arbitrariness or discrimination, constituting in international law denials of justice lato sensu; Considering that in particular - (1) The Spanish courts agreed to entertain the bankruptcy of Barcelona Traction in flagrant breach of the applicable provisions of Spanish law, which do not permit that a foreign debtor should be adjudged bankrupt if that debtor does not have his domicile, or at least an establishment, in Spanish territory; (2) Those same courts adjudged Barcelona Traction bankrupt whereas that company was neither in a state of insolvency nor in a state of final, general and complete cessation of payments and had not ceased its payments in Spain, this being a manifest breach of the applicable statutory provisions of Spanish lav/, in particular Article 876 of the 1885 Commercial Code; (3) The judgment of 12 February 1948 failed to order the publication of the bankruptcy by announcement in the place of domicile of the bankrupt, which constitutes a flagrant breach of Article 1044 (5) of the I829 Commercial Code; (4) The decisions failing to respect the separate estates of Barcelona Traction's subsidiaries and sub-subsidiaries, in that they extended to their property the attachment arising out of the bankruptcy of the parent company, and thus disregarded their distinct legal personalities, on the sole ground that all their shares belonged to Barcelona Traction or one of its subsidiaries, had no legal basis in Spanish law, were purely arbitrary and in any event constitute a flagrant breach of Article 35 of the Civil Code, Articles li? and 174 of the I885 Commercial Code (so far as the Spanish companies are concerned) and Article 15 of the same Code (so far as the Canadian companies are concerned), as well as of Article 1334 of the Civil Procedure Code; If the estates of the subsidiaries and sub-subsidiaries could have been included in that of Barcelona Traction - quod non -, it would have been necessary to apply to that company the special r?gime established by the imperative provisions of Articles 930 et seq. of the 1885 Commercial Code and the Acts of 9 April 1904 and 2 January I915 for the event that public-utility companies cease payment, and this was not done; (5) The judicial decisions which conferred on the bankruptcy authorities the fictitious possession (termed "mediate and constructive civil possession") of the shares of certain subsidiary and sub-subsidiary companies have no statutory basis in Spanish bankruptcy law and were purely arbitrary; they comprise moreover</page><page sequence="19">245 a flagrant breach not only of the general principle recognized in the Spanish as in the majority of other legal systems to the effect that no person may exercise the rights embodied in negotiable securities without having at his disposal the securities themselves, but also of Articles 1334 and 1351 of ?he Civil Procedure Code and Article 1046 of the 1829 Commercial Code, which require the bankruptcy authorities to proceed to the material apprehension of the bankrupt's property; (6) The bestowal on the commissioner by the bankruptcy judgment of power to proceed to the dismissal, removal or appointment of members of the staff, employees and management, of the companies all of whose shares belonged to Barcelona Traction or one of its subsidiaries had no statutory basis in Spanish law and constituted a gross violation of the statutory provisions referred to under (4), first sub-paragraph, above and also of Article 1045 of the 1829 Commercial Code; (7) The Spanish courts approved or tolerated the action of the trustees in setting themselves up as a purported general meeting of the two Canadian subsidiaries and in transforming them, in that capacity, into companies under Spanish law, thus gravely disregarding the rule embodied in Article.15 of the 1885 Commercial Code to the effect that the status and internal functioning of foreign companies shall be governed in Spain by th? law under which they were incorporated; (8) The Spanish courts approved or tolerated the action of the trustees in setting themselves up as purported general meetings and modifying, in that capacity, the terms of association of the Ebro, Catalonian Land, Union El?ctrica de Catalu?a, Electricista Catalana, Barcelonesa and Saltos del Segre companies, cancelling their shares and issuing new shares; they thus committed a manifest breach of Article 15 of the 1885 Commercial Code (so far as the two Canadian companies were concerned) and Articles 547 et seq. of the same code, which authorize the issue of duplicates only in the circumstances they specify; they also gravely disregarded the clauses of the trust deeds concerning voting-rights, in flagrant contempt of the undisputed rule of Spanish law to the effect that acts performed and agreements concluded validly by the bankrupt before the date of the cessation of payments as determined in the judicial decisions shall retain their effects and their binding force in respect of the bankruptcy authorities (Articles 878 et seq. of the 1885 Commercial Code); (9) The Spanish courts decided at one and the same time to ignore the separate legal personalities of the subsidiary and sub-subsidiary companies (so as to justify the attachment of their property in Spain and their inclusion in the bankrupt estate) and implicitly but indubitably to recognize those same personalities by the conferring of fictitious possession of their shares on the bankruptcy authorities, thus giving decisions which were vitiated by an obvious self-contradiction revealing their arbitrary and discriminatory nature; (10) The general meeting of creditors of 19 September I949 convened for the purpose of appointing the trustees was, with the approval of the Spanish judicial authorities, held in flagrant breach</page><page sequence="20">246 of Articles 300 and 1342 of the Civil Procedure Code, and 1044 (3), 1060, 1061 and 1063 of the 1829 Commercial Code, in that ?a0 it was not convened on cognizance of the list of creditors; (b) when that list was prepared, it was not drawn up on the basis of particulars from the balance-sheet or the books and documents of the bankrupt company, which books and documents were not, as the Spanish Government itself admits, in the possession of the commissioner on 8 October 1949, while the judicial authorities had not at any time sent letters rogatory to Toronto, Canada, with the request that they be put at his disposal; (11) By authorizing the sale of the property of the bankrupt company when the adjudication in bankruptcy had not acquired irrevoca bility and while the proceedings were suspended, the Spanish courts flagrantly violated A?ticles 919, II67, 1319 and 1331 of the Civil Procedure Code and the general principles of the right of defence; Insofar as that authorization was based on the allegedly perishable nature of the property to be sold, it constituted a serious disregard of Article 1055 of the I829 Commercial Code and Article 1354 of the Civil Procedure Code, which articles allow the sale only of movable property which cannot be kept without deteriorating or spoiling; even supposing that those provisions could be applied in general to the property of Barcelona Traction, its subsidiaries and sub-subsidiaries - quod non -, there would still have been a gross and flagrant violation of them, inasmuch as that property as a whole was obviously not in any imminent danger of serious depreciation; indeed the only dangers advanced by the trustees, namely those arising out of the threats of prosecution contained in the Joint Statement, had not taken shape, either by the day on which authorization to sell was requested or by the day of the sale, in any proceedings or demand by the competent authorities and did not ever materialize, except to an insignificant extent; The only penalty which the undertakings eventually had to bear, 15 months after the sale, was that relating to the currency offence, which had occasioned an embargo for a much higher sum as early as April 1948; (12) The authorization to sell and the sale, in so far as they related to the shares of the subsidiary and sub-subsidiary companies without delivery of the certificates, constituted a flagrant violation of Articles l46l and 1462 of the Spanish Civil Code, which require delivery of the thing sold, seeing that the certificates delivered to the successful bidder had not been properly issued and were consequently without legal value; if the authorization to sell and the sale had applied, as the respondent Government wrongly maintains, to the rights attaching to the shares and bonds or to the bankrupt company's power of domination over its subsidiaries, those rights ought to have been the subject of a joint valuation, on pain of flagrant violation of Articles 1084 to IO89 of the I829 Commercial Code and Article 1358 of the Civil Procedure Code; in any event, it was in flagrant violation of these last-named provisions that the commissioner fixed an exaggeratedly low reserve price on the basis of a unilateral expert opinion which, through the effect of the General Conditions of Sale, allowed the March group to acquire the auctioned property at that reserve price;</page><page sequence="21">247 (13) By approving the General Conditions of Sale on the very day on which they were submitted to them and then dismissing the proceedings instituted to contest those conditions, the judicial authorities committed a flagrant violation of numerous ordre public provisions of Spanish law; thus, in particular, the General Conditions of Sale - (a) provided for the payment of the bondholder creditors, an operation which, under Article 1322 of the Civil Procedure Code, falls under the fourth section of the bankruptcy, whereas that section was suspended as a result of the effects attributed to the Boter motion contesting jurisdiction, no exemption from that suspension having been applied for or obtained in pursuance of the second paragraph of Article 114 of the Civil Procedure Code; (b) provided for the payment of the debts owing on the bonds before they had been approved and ranked by a general meeting of the creditors on the recommendation of the trustees, contrary to Articles 1101 to 1109 of the 1829 Commercial Code and to Articles 1266 to 1274, 1286 and 1378 of the Civil Procedure Code; (c) in disregard of Articles 1236, 1240, 1512 and 1513 of the Civil Procedure Code, did not require the price to be lodged or deposited at the CourtTs disposal: (d) conferred on the trustees power to recognize, determine and declare effective the rights attaching to the bonds, in disregard, on the one hand, of Articles 1101 to 1109 of the 1829 Commercial Code and of Articles 1266 to 1274 of the Civil Procedure Code, which reserve such rights for the general meeting of creditors under the supervision of the judge, and, on the other, of Articles 1445 and 1449 of the Civil Code, which lay down that the purchase price must be a definite sum and may not be left to the arbitrary decision of one of the contracting parties; (e) in disregard of Articles 1291 to 1294 of the Civil Procedure Code, substituted the successful bidder for the trustees in respect of the payment of the debts owing on the bonds, whilst, in violation of the general principles applicable to novation, replacing the security for those debts, consisting, pursuant to the trust deeds, of shares and bonds issued by the subsidiary and sub-subsidiary companies, with the deposit of a certain sum with a bank or with a mere bankerTs guarantee limited to three years; (f) delegated to a third party the function of paying certain debts, in disregard of Articles 1291 and 1292 of the Civil Procedure Code, which define the functions of the trustees in this field and do not allow of any delegation; (g) ordered the payment of the debts owing on the bonds in sterling, whereas a forced execution may only be carried out in local currency and in the case of bankruptcy the various operations which it includes require the conversion of the debts into local currency on the day of the judgment adjudicating bankruptcy, as is to be inferred from. Articles 883 and 884 of the 1885 Commercial Code;</page><page sequence="22">248 IV DENIALS OF JUSTICE STRICTO SENSU Considering that in the course of the bankruptcy proceedings the rights of the defence were seriously disregarded; that in particular - (a) the Reus court, in adjudicating Barcelona Traction bankrupt on an parte petition, inserted in its judgment provisions which went far beyond finding the purported insolvency of or a general cessation of payments by the bankrupt company, the only finding, in addition to one on the capacity of the petitioners, that it was open to it to make in such proceedings; This disregard of the rights of the defence was particularly flagrant in respect of the subsidiary companies, whose property was ordered by the court to be attached without their having been summonsed and without their having been adjudicated bankrupt; (b) the subsidiary companies that were thus directly affected by the judgment of 12 February 1948 nevertheless had their applications to set aside the order for attachment which concerned them rejected as inadmissible on the grounds of lack of capacity; (c) the pursuit of those remedies and the introduction of"any other such proceedings were also made impossible for the subsidiary companies by the discontinuances effected each time by the solicitors appointed to replace the original solicitors by the new boards of directors directly or indirectly involved; these changes of solicitors and discontinuances were effected by the new boards of directors by virtue of authority conferred upon them by the interim receiver simultaneously with their appointment; (d) the proceedings for relief brought by those in control of the subsidiary companies who had been dismissed by the commissioner were likewise held inadmissible by the Reus court when they sought to avail themselves of the specific provisions of Article 1^63 of the Civil Procedure Code, which provide for proceedings to reverse decisions taken by the commissioner in bankruptcy; (e) there was discrimination on the part of the first special judge when he refused to admit as a party to the bankruptcy the Canadian National Trust Company, Limited, trustee for the bankrupt company's two sterling loans, even though it relied upon the security of the mortgage which had been given to it by-Ebro, whereas at the same time he admitted to the proceedings the Bondholders' Committee appointed by Juan March, although National Trust and the Committee derived their powers from the same trust deeds; (f) the complaints against the General Conditions of Sale could be neither amplified nor heard because the order which had approved the General Conditions of Sale was deemed to be one of mere routine;</page><page sequence="23">249 Considering that many years elapsed after the bankruptcy judgment and even after the ruinous sale of the property of the Barcelona Traction group without either the bankrupt company or those co-interested with it having had an opportunity to be heard on the numerous complaints put forward against the bankruptcy judgment and related decisions in the opposition of 18 June 1948 and in various other applications for relief; Considering that those delays were caused by the motion contesting jurisdiction fraudulently lodged by a confederate of the petitioners in bankruptcy and by incidental proceedings instituted by other men of straw of the March group, which were, like the motion contesting jurisdiction, regularly admitted by the various courts; Considering that both general international law and the Spanish-Belgian Treaty of 192? regard such delays as equivalent to the denial of a hearing; Considering that the manifest injustice resulting from the movement of the proceedings towards the sale, whilst the actions contesting the bankruptcy judgment and even the jurisdiction of the Spanish courts remained suspended, wes brought about by two judgments delivered by the same chamber of the Barcelona court of appeal on the same day, 7 June 1949: in one cf them it confirmed the admission, with two effects, of the Boter appeal from the judgment of the special judge rejecting his motion contesting jurisdiction, whereas in the other it reduced the suspensive effect granted to that same appeal by excluding from the suspension the calling of the general meeting of creditors for the purpose of appointing the trustees in bankruptcy; V DAMAGE AND REPARATION Considering that the acts and omissions contrary to international law attributed to the organs of the Spanish State had the effect of despoiling the Barcelona Traction company of the whole of its property and of depriving it of the very objects of its activity, and thus rendered it practically defunct; Considering that Belgian nationals, natural and juristic persons, shareholders in Barcelona Traction, in which they occupied a majority and controlling position, and in particular the Sidro company, the owner of more than 75 per cent, of the registered canitai, on this account suffered direct and immediate injury to their interests and rights, which were voided of all value and effectiveness; Considering that the reparation due to the Belgian State from the Spanish State, as a result of the internationally unlawful acts for which the latter State is responsible, must be complete and must, so far as possible, reflect the damage suffered by its nationals whose case the Belgian State has taken up; and that, since restitutio</page><page sequence="24">250 in integrum is, in the circumstances of the case, practically and legally impossible, the reparation of the damage suffered can only take place in the form of an all-embracing pecuniary indemnity, in accordance with the provisions of the Spanish-Belgian Treaty mf 19?7 and with the rules of general international law; Considering that in the instant case the amount of the indemnity must be fixed by taking as a basis the net value of the Barcelona Traction company's property at the time #f its adjudication in bankruptcy, expressed in a currency which has remained stable, namely, the United States dollar; Considering that the value of that property must be determined by the replacement cost of the subsidiary and sub-subsidiary companies' plant for the production and distribution of electricity at 12 February 1948, as that cost was calculated by the Ebro company's engineers in 1946; Considering that, according to those calculations, and after deduction for depreciation through wear and tear, the value of the plant was at that date U.S. $116,220,000; from this amount there nus : be deducted the principal of Barcelona Traction's bonded debt and the interest that had fallen due thereon, that is to say, U.S. $27,619^018, which leaves a net value of about U.S.* $88,600,000, this result being c'cnfirmed - (1) by the study submitted on 5 February 19-49 and on behalf #f Ebro to the Special Technical Office for the Regulation and Distribution of Electricity (Catalonian region) (Belgian New Document No. 50); (2) by capitalization of the 1947 profits; (3) by the profits made by Focsain 1956 - the first year after 19^0 in which the position of electricity companies was fully stabilized and the last year before the changes made in the undertaking by Fee sa consti tilted an obstacle to any useful comparison; (4) by the reports of the experts consulted by the Belgian Government; Considering that the compensation due to the Belgian Government must be estimated, in the first place, at the percentage of such net value corresponding to the participation of Belgian nationals in the capital of the Barcelona Traction company, namely 88 per cent.; Considering that on the critical dates of the bankruptcy judgment and the filing of the Application, the capital of Barcelona Traction was represented by 1,798,854 shares, partly bearer and partly registered; that on 12 February 19^8 Sidro owned 1,012,688 registered shares and 349,905 bearer shares; that -&gt;ther Belgian nationals owned 420 registered shares and at least 244,832 bearer shares; that 1,607,845 shares, constituting 89.3 per cent, of the company's capital, were thus on that date in Belgian hands;</page><page sequence="25">251 that on 14 June 1962 Sidro owned 1,354,514 registered shares and 31,228 bearer shares; that other Belgian nationals owned 2,388 registered shares and at least 200,000 bearer shares; and that 1,588,130 shares, constituting 88 per cent. of#the company's capital, were thus on that date in Belgian hands; Considering that the compensation claimed must in addition cover all incidental damage suffered by the said Belgian nationals as a result of the acts complained of, including the deprivation of enjoyment of rights, the expenses incurred in the defence of their rights and the equivalent, in capital and interest, of the amount of the Barcelona Traction bonds held by Belgian nationals, and of their other claims on the companies in the group which it was not possible to recover owing to the acts complained of; Considering that the amount of such compensation, due to the Belgian State on account of acts contrary to international law attributable to the Spanish State, cannot be affected by the latter's purported charges against the private persons involved, those charges furthermore not having formed the subject of any counter claim before the Court; VI OBJECTION DERIVED FROM THE ALLEGED LACK OF JUS STANDI OF THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT Considering that in its Judgment of 24 July 1964 the Court decided to join to the merits the third preliminary objection raised by the Spanish Government; Considering*that the respondent Government wrongly denies t# the Belgian Government jus standi in the present proceedings; Considering that the object of the Belgian Governments Application of 14 June 1962 is reparation for the damage caused to a certain number of its nationals, natural and juristic persons, in their capacity as shareholders in the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited, by the conduct contrary to international lav? of various organs of the Spanish Sta,te towards that company and various other companies in its group; Considering that the Belgian Government has established that 88 per cent, of Barcelona Traction's capital was in Belgian hands on the critical dates of 12 February 1948 and 14 July 1962 and so remained continuously between those dates; that a single Belgian company, Sidro, possessed more than 75 per cent, of the shares; that the Belgian nationality of that company and the effectiveness of its nationality have not been challenged by the Spanish Government; Considering that the fact that the Barcelona Traction registered shares possessed by Sidro were registered in Canada in the r?ame of American nominees does not affect their Belgian character; tha.t in this case, -under the applicable systems of statutory law, the nominee could exercise the rights attaching to the shares entered in its name only as Sidrof s agent;</page><page sequence="26">252 Considering that the preponderance of Belgian interests in the Barcelona Traction company was well known to the Spanish authorities at the different periods in which the conduct complained of against them occurred, and has been explicitly admitted by them on more than one ocoasion; j?onsidering that the diplomatic protection from which the company benefited for a certain time on the part of its national Government ceased in 1952, well before the filing of the Belgian Application, and has never subsequently beer? resumed; Considering that by depriving the organs appointed by the Barcelona Traction shareholders under the companyT s terms of association of their power of control in respect of its subsidiaries, which removed from the company the very objects of its activities, and by depriving it of the whole of its property, the nets and omissions contrary to international law attributed to the Spanish authorities rendered the company practically defunct and directly and immediately injured the rights and interests attaching to the legal situation of shareholder as it is recognized by international law; that they thus caused serious damage to the company's Belgian shareholders and voided the rights which they possessed in that capacity of all useful content; Considering that in the absence of reparation to the company for the damage inflicted on it, from which they would have benefited at the same time as itself, the Belgian shareholders of Barcelona Traction thus have separate and independent rights and interests to assert; that they did in fact have to take the initiative for and bear the cost of all the proceedings brought through the company1s organs to seek relief in the Spanish courts; that Sidro and other Belgian shareholders, after the sale of Barcelona Traction' s property, themselves brought actions the dismissal of which is complained of by the Belgian Government as constituting a denial of justice; Considering that under the general principles of international law in this field the Belgian Government has jus standi to claim through international judicial proceedings reparation for the damage thus.caused to its nationals by the Internationally unlawful acts and omissions attributed to the Spanish State; VII OBJECTION OP NON-EXHAUSTION OP LOCAL REMEDIES Considering that no real difference has emerged between the parties as to the scope and significance of the rule of international law embodied in Article J&gt; of the Treaty of Conciliation, Judicial Settlement and Arbitration concluded between Spain and Belgium on 19 July 1927, which makes resort to the procedures provided for in that Treaty dependant on the prior use, until a judgment with final effect has been pronounced, of the normal means of redress which are available and which offer genuine possibilities of effectiveness within the limitation of a reasonable time;</page><page sequence="27">253 Considering that in this case the Respondent itself estimates at 2,736 the number of orders alone made in the case by the Spanish courts as of the date of the Belgian Application; Considering that in addition the pleadings refer to more than 30 decisions by the Supreme Court; Considering that it is not contended that the remedies as a whole of which Barcelona Traction and its co-interested parties availed themselves and which gave rise to those decisions were inadequate or were not pursued to the point of exhaustion; Considering that this circumstance suffices as a bar to the possibility of the fourth objection being upheld as setting aside the Belgian claim; Considering that the only complaints which could be set aside are those in respect of which the Spanish Government proved failure to malee use of means of redress or the insufficiency of those used; Considering that such proof has not been supplied; 1. With Respect to the Complaints Against the Acts of the Administrative Authorities Considering that the Spanish Government is wrong in contending that the Belgian complaint concerning the decisions of October and December 19^6 referred to under I (a) above is not admissible on account of Barcelona Traction's failure to exercise against them the remedies of appeal to higher authority and contentious administrative proceedings ; Considering that the remedy of appeal to higher authority was inconceivable in this case, being by definition an appeal which may be made from a decision by one administrative authority to another hierarchically superior authority, namely the Minister, whereas the decisions complained of were taken with the co-operation and approval of the Minister himself, and even brought to the knowledge of those concerned by the Minister at the same time as by the competent administrative authority; Considering that it was likewise not possible to envisage contentious administrative proceedings against a decision which patently did not fall within the ambit of Article 1 of the Act of 22 June 1894, which recognizes such a remedy only against administrative decisions emanating from administrative authorities in the exercise of their regulated powers and "infringing a right of an administrative character previously established in favour of the applicant by an Act, a regulation or some other administrative provision", which requirements were patently not satisfied in this case; 2. With Respect to the Complaint Concerning the Reus Court fs Lack of Jurisdiction to Declare the Bankruptcy of Barcelona Traction Considering that the Spanish Government is wrong in seeking to derive an argument from the fact that Barcelona Traction and its</page><page sequence="28">254 co-interested parties supposedly failed to challenge the jurisdiction of the Reus court by means of a motion contesting its competence, and allowed the time-limit for entering opposition to expire without having challenged that jurisdiction; Considering that in fact a motion contesting jurisdiction is not at all the same thing as a motion contesting competence ratlone materiae and may properly be presented cumulatively with the case on the merits; Considering that the bankrupt company contested jurisdiction at the head of the complaints set out in its opposition plea of 18 June 1948; Considering that it complained again of lack of jurisdiction in its application of 5 July 19^8 for a declaration of nullity and in its pleading *f 3 September 1948 in which it confirmed its opposition to the bankruptcy judgment; Considering that National Trust submitted a formal motion con testing jurisdiction in its application of 27 November 1948 for admission to the bankruptcy proceedings; Considering that Barcelona Traction, after having as early as 23 April 1949 entereod an appearance in the proceedings concerning the Boter motion contesting jurisdiction, formally declared its adherence to that motion by a procedural document of 11 April 1953; Considering that the question of jurisdiction being a matter of ordre public, as is the question of competence ratione materiae, the complaint of belatedness could not be upheld, even in the event of the expiry of the allegedly applicable time-limit for entering a plea of opposition; 3? With Respect to the Complaints Concerning the Bankruptcy Judgment and Related Decisions Considering that the Spanish Government is wrong in contending that the said decisions were not attacked by adequate remedies pursued to the point of exhaustion or for a reasonable length of time; Considering that in fact, as early as l6 February 19^8, the bankruptcy judgment was attacked by an application for its eetting aside on the part of the subsidiary companies, Ebro and Barcelonesa Considering that while those companies admittedly confined their applications for redress to the parts of the judgment which gave them grounds for complaint, the said remedies were nonetheless adequate and they were brought to nought in circumstances which are themselves the subject of a complaint which has been set out above; Considering that, contrary to what is asserted by the Spanish Government, the bankrupt company itself entered a plea of opposition to the judgment by a procedural document of 18 June 19^8, confirmed on 3 September 1948;</page><page sequence="29">255 Considering that it is idle for the Spanish Government to criticize the summary character of this procedural document, while the suspension decreed by the special judge on account of the Boter motion contesting jurisdiction prevented the party entering opposition from filing, pursuant to Article 326 of the Civil Pro cedure Code, the additional pleading developing its case; Considering that likewise there can be no question of belatedness, since only publication of the bankruptcy at the domicile of the bankrupt company could have caused the time-limit for entering opposition to begin to run, and no such publication took place; Considering that the bankruptcy judgment and the related decisions were moreover also attacked in the incidental application for a declaration of nullity submitted by Barcelona Traction on 5 July 1948 and amplified on 31 July 1948; 4. With Respect to the Complaints Concerning the Blocking of the Remedies Considering that the various decisions which instituted and prolonged the suspension of the first section of the bankruptcy proceedings were attacked on various occasions by numerous proceedings taken by Barcelona Traction, beginning with the incidental application for a declaration- of nullity which it submitted on 5 July 1948; 5. With Respect to the Complaint Concerning the Dismissal of the Officers of the Subsidiary Companies by Order of the Commissioner Considering that this measure was also attacked by applications for its setting aside on the part of the persons concerned, which were quite improperly declared inadmissible; and that the proceedings seeking redress against those decisions were adjourned until 1963; 6. With Respect to the Failure to Observe the No-Action Clause Considering that this clause was explicitly referred to by National Trust in its application of 27 November 1948 for admission to the proceedings; 7&gt; With Respect to the Measures Preparatory to the Sale and the Sale Considering that the other side, while implicitly admitting that adequate proceedings were taken to attack the appointment of the trustees and the authorization to sell, is wrong in contending that this was supposedly not so in respect of - (1) The failure to draw up a list of creditors prior to the convening of the meeting of creditors for the appointment of the trustees, whereas this defect was complained of in the procedural document attacking the appointment of the trustees and in the application that the sale be declared null and void; (2) Certain acts and omissions on the part of the trustees, whereas they were referred to in the proceedings taken to attack the authorization to sell and the decision approving the method of unilateral valuation of the assets;</page><page sequence="30">256 0) The conditions of sale, whereas they were attacked by Barcelona Traction in an application to set aside and on appeal, in the application of 27 December 1951 for a declaration of nullity containing a formal player that the order approving the conditions of sale be declared null and void, and in an application of 28 May 1955 ("New Documents submitted by the Belgian Government, 1969, No. JO); th? same challenge was expressed by Sidro in its action of 7 February 1953 (New Documents submitted by the Spanish Government, 1969) 811(1 by two other Belgian shareholders of Barcelona Traction, Mrs. Mathot and Mr. Duvivier, in their application of 26 May 1955 (New Documents submitted by the Belgian Government, 1969* No. 29); 8* With Respect to the Exceptional Remedies Considering that the Spanish Government is wrong in raising as an objection to the Belgian claim the allegation that Barcelona Traction did not make use of certain exceptional remedies against the bankruptcy judgment, such as application for revision, action for civil liability and criminal proceedings against the judges, and application for a hearing by a party in default; Considering that the first of these remedies could patently not be contemplated, not only on account of the nature of the bankruptcy judgment, but also because until 1963 there was an opposition outstanding against that judgment and, superabundantly, because Barcelona Traction, its subsidiaries and co-interested parties would not have been in a position to prove the facts of subornation, violence or fraudulent machination which alone could have entitled such proceedings to be taken; Considering that the remedies of an action for civil liability and criminal proceedings against the judges were not adequate, since they were not capable of bringing about the annulment or setting aside of the decisions constituting denials of justice; Considering that similarly the- remedy of application for a hearing accorded by Spanish law to a party in default was patently in this case neither available to Barcelona Traction nor adequate; FOR THESE REASONS, and any others which have been adduced by the Belgian Government in the course of the proceedings, May it please the Court, rejecting any other submissions of the Spanish State which are broader or to a contrary effect, To uphold the claims of the Belgian Government expressed in the submissions /ip7 the Reply." The following final submissions were presented</page><page sequence="31">257 on behalf of the Spanish Government, at the hearing of 22 July 1969* "Considering that the Belgian Government has no jus stand! in the present case, either for the protection of the Canadian Barcelona Traction company or for the protection of alleged Belgian 1 shareholders* of that company; Considering that the requirements of the exhaustion of local remedies rule have not been satisfied either by the Barcelona Traction company or by its alleged shareholders' ; Considering that as no violation of an international rule binding on Spain has been established, Spain has not incurred any responsibility vis-?-vis the applicant State on any account; and that, in particular - (a) Spain is not responsible for any usurpation of jurisdiction on account of the action of its judicial organs; the Spanish judicial organs have not violated the rules of international law requiring that foreigners be given access to the courts, that a decision be given on their claims and that their proceedings for redress should not be subjected to unjustified delays; {q) there have been no acts of the Spanish judiciary capable of giving rise to international responsibility on the part of Spain on account of the content of judicial decisions; and (d) there has not been on the part of the Spanish administrative authorities any violation of an international obligation on account of abuse of rights or discriminatory acts; Considering that for these reasons, and any others expounded in the written and oral proceedings, the Belgian claims must be deemed to be inadmissible or unfounded; The Spanish Government presents to the Court its final submissions: May it please the Court to adjudge and declare that the Belgian Government's claims are dismissed." 26. As has been indicated earlier, in opposition to the Belgian Application the Spanish Government advanced four objections of a preliminary nature. In its Judgment of 24 July 1964 the Court rejected the first and second of these (see paragraph 3 above), and decided to join the third and fourth to the merits. The latter were, briefly, to the effect that the Belgian Government lacked capacity to submit any claim in respect of wrongs done to a Canadian company, even if the shareholders were Belgian, and that local remedies available in Spain had not been exhausted.</page><page sequence="32">258 27. In the subsequent written and oral proceedings the Parties supplied the Court with abundant material and information bearing both on the preliminary objections not decided in 1964 and on the merits of the case. In this connection the Court considers that reference should be made to the unusual length of the present proceedings, which has been due to the very long time-limits requested by the Parties for the preparation of their written pleadings and in addition to their repeated requests for an extension of these limits. The Court did not find that it should refuse these requests and thus impose limitations on the Parties in the preparation and presentation of the arguments and evidence which they considered necessary. It nonetheless remains convinced of the fact that it is in the interest of the authority and proper functioning of international justice for cases to be decided without unwarranted delay. # 28? For the sake of clarity, the Court will briefly recapitulate the claim and identify the entities concerned in it. The claim is presented on behalf of natural and juristic persons, alleged to be Belgian nationals and shareholders in the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited. The submissions of the Belgian Government make it clear that the object of its Application is reparation for damage allegedly caused to these persons by the conduct, said to be contrary to international law, of various organs of the Spanish State towards that company and various other companies in the same group. 29. In the first of its submissions, more specifically in the Counter-Memorial, the Spanish Government contends that the Belgian Application of I962 seeks, though disguisedly, the same object as the Application of 1958, i.e., the protection of the Barcelona Traction company as such, as a separate corporate entity, and that the claim should in consequence be dismissed. However, in making its new Application, as it has chosen to frame it, the Belgian Government was only exercising the freedom of action of any State to formulate its claim in its own way. The Court is therefore bound to examine the claim in accordance with the explicit content imparted to it by the Belgian Government. 30. The States which the present case principally concerns are Belgium, the national State of the alleged shareholders, Spain, the State whose organs are alleged to have committed the unlawful acts complained of, and Canada, the State under v/hose laws Barcelona Traction was incorporated and in whose territory it has its registered office ("head office" in the terms of the by-laws of Barcelona Traction). 31. Thus the Court has to deal with a series of problems arising out of a triangular relationship involving the State whose nationals are shareholders in a company incorporated under the laws of another State, in whose territory it has its registered office; the State whose organs are alleged to have committed against the company unlawful acts prejudicial to both it and its shareholders; and the State under whose laws the company is incorporated, and in whose territory it has its registered office.</page><page sequence="33">259 32. In these circumstances it is logical that the Court should first address itself to what was originally presented as the subject-matter of the third preliminary objections namely the question of the right of Belgium to exercise diplomatic protection of Belgian shareholders in a company which is a juristic entity incorporated in Canada,, the measures complained of having been taken in relation not to any Belgian national but to the company itself. 33. When a State admits into its territory foreign investments or foreign nationals, whether natural or juristic persons, it is bound to extend to them the protection of the lav/ and assumes obligations concerning the treatment to be afforded them. These obligations, however, are neither absolute nor unqualified. In particular, an essential distinction should be drawn between the obligations of a State towards the international community as a whole, and those arising vis-?-vis another State in the field of diplomatic protection. By their very nature the former are the concern-of all States. In view of the importance of the rights involved, all States can be held to have a legal interest in their protection; they are obligations erga omnes. 3^. Such obligations derive, for example, in contemporary international law, from the outlawing of acts of aggression, and of genocide, as also from the principles and rules concerning the basic rights of the human person, including protection from slavery and racial discrimination. Some of the corresponding rights of protection have entered into the body of general international law (Reservations to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1951* P? 23); others are conferred by international instruments of a universal or quasi-universal character. 35? Obligations the performance of which is the subject of diplomatic protection are not of the same category. It cannot be held, when one such obligation in particular is in question, in a specific, case, that ail States have a legal interest in its observance. In order to bring a claim in respect of the breach of such an obligation, a State must first establish its right to do so, for the rules on the subject rest on two suppositions; "The first is that the defendant State has broken an obligation towards the national State in respect of its nationals. The second is that only the party to whom an international obligation is due can bring a claim in respect of its breach." (Reparation for Injuries Suffered in the Service of the United Nations, Advisory Opini on/I.C.J, Reports iffi-g, 5 - 82. ) In the present case it is therefore essential to establish whether the losses allegedly suffered by Belgian shareholders in Barcelona Traction were the consequence of the violation of obligations of which they were the beneficiaries. In other words: has a right of Belgium been violated on account of its nationals having suffered infringement of their rights as shareholders in a company not.of Belgian nationality?</page><page sequence="34">260 3o. Thus it is the existence of absence of a right, belonging to Belgium and recognized as such by international law, which is decisive for the problem of Belgiumfs capacity. "This right is necessarily limited to intervention /5y a State/ on behalf of its own nationals because, in the absence of a special agreement, it is the bond of nationality between the State and the individual which alone confers upon the State the right of diplomatic protection, and it is as a part of the function of diplomatic protection that the right to take up a claim and to ensure respect for the rules of international lav/ must be envisaged.11 (Panevezys-Saldutiskis Railway, Judgment, 1939* P.C?I*J., Series.A/B, No. 76, p. ?5 ) It follows that the same question is determinant in respect of Spain's responsibility towards Belgium. Responsibility is the necessary corollary of a right. In the absence of any treaty on the subject between the Parties, this essential issue has to be decided in the light of the general rules of diplomatic protection. 37? In seeking to determine the lav/ applicable to this case, the Court has to bear in mind the continuous evolution of international law. Diplomatic protection de?ls with a very sensitive area of international relations, since the interest-of a foreign State in the protection of its nationals confronts the rights of the territorial sovereign, a fact of which the general law on the subject has had to take cognizance in order to prevent abuses and friction. From its origins closely linked with international commerce, diplomatic pro tection has sustained a particular impact from the growth of inter national economic relations, and at the same time from the profound transformations which have taken place in the economic life of nations. These latter changes have given birth to municipal institutions, which have transcended frontiers and have begun to exercise considerable influence on international relations. One of these phenomena which has a particular bearing on the present case is the corporate entity. 38. In "this field international law is called upon to recognize institutions of municipal law that have an important and extensive role in the international field. This does not necessarily imply drawing any analogy between its own institutions and those of municipal lav/, nor does it amount to making rules of international law dependent upon categories of municipal law. All it means is that international law has had to recognize the corporate entity as an institution created by States in a domain essentially within their domestic jurisdiction. This in turn requires that, whenever legal issues arise concerning the rights of States with regard to the treatment of companies and shareholders, as to which rights international lav/ has not established its own rules, it has to refer to the relevant rules of municipal law. Consequently, in" view of the relevance to the present case cf the rights of the corporate entity and its shareholders under municipal lav/, the Court must devote attention to the nature and interrelation of those rights.</page><page sequence="35">261 39? Seen in historical perspective, the corporate personality represents a development brought about by new and expanding require ments in the economic field, an entity which in particular allows of operation in circumstances which exceed the normal capacity of individuals. As such it has become a powerful factor in the economic life of nations. Of this, municipal law has had to take due account, whenoe the increasing volume of rules governing the creation and operation of corporate entities, endowed with a specific status. Thes'e entities have rights and obligations peculiar to themselves. 40. There is, however, no need to investigate the many different forms of legal entity provided for by the municipal laws of States, because the Court is concerned only with that exemplified by the com pany involved in the present case: Barcelona Traction - a limited liability company whose capital is represented by shares. There are, indeed, other associations, whatever the name attached to them by municipal legal systems, that do not enjoy independent corporate personality. The legal difference between the two kinds of entity is that for the limited liability company it is the overriding tie" of legal personality which is determinant; for the other associations, the continuing autonomy of the several members. 41. Municipal law determines the legal situation not only of such limited liability companies but also of those persons who hold shares in them. Separated from the company by numerous barriers, the share holder cannot be Identified with it. The concept and structure of the company are founded on and determined by a firm distinction between the separate entity of the company and that of the shareholder, each with a distinct set of rights. The separation of property rights as between company and shareholder is an important manifestation of this distinction. So long as the company is in existence the share holder has no right to the corporate assets. 42. It is a basic characteristic of the corporate structure that the company alone, through its directors or management acting in its name, can take action in respect of matters that are of a corporate character. The underlying justification for this is that, in seeking to serve its own best interests, the'company will serve those of. the shareholder too. Ordinarily, no individual shareholder can take legal steps, either in the name of the company or in his own name. If the shareholders disagree with the decisions taken on behalf of the company they may, in accordance with its articles or the relevant provisions of the law, change them or replace its officers, or take such action as is provided by law. Thus to protect the com pany against abuse by its management or the majority of shareholders, several municipal legal systems have vested in shareholders (sometimes a particular number is specified) the right to bring an action for the defence of the company, and conferred upon the minority of share holders certain rights to guard against decisions affecting the rights of the company vis-k-vis its management or controlling shareholders. Nonetheless the shareholdersT rights in relation to the company and its assets remain limited, this being, moreover, a corollary of the limited nature of their liability.</page><page sequence="36">262 4j. At this point the Court would recall that in forming a company, its promoters are guided by all the various factors involved, the advantages and disadvantages of which they take into account. So equally does a shareholder, whether he is an original subscriber of capital or a subsequent purchaser of the company1s shares from another shareholder. He may be seeking safety of investment, high dividends or capital appreciation - or a combination of two or more of these. Whichever it is, it does not alter the legal status of the corporate entity or affect the rights of the shareholder. In any event he is bound to take account of the risk of reduced dividends, capital depreciation or even loss, resulting from ordinary commercial hazards or from prejudice caused to the company by illegal treatment of some kind. 44. Notwithstanding the separate corporate personality, a wrong done to the company frequently causes prejudice to its shareholders. But the mere fact that damage is sustained by both company and shareholder does not imply that both are entitled to claim compensation. Thus no legal conclusion can be drawn from the fact that the same event caused damage simultaneously affecting several natural or juristic persons. Creditors do not have any right to claim compensation from a person who, by wronging their debtor, causes them loss. In such cases, no doubt, the interests of the aggrieved are affected, but not their rights. Thus whenever a shareholder's interests are harmed by an act done to the company, it is to the latter that he must look to institute appropriate action; for although two separate entities may have suffered from the same wrong, it is only one entity whose rights have been infringed. 45. However, it has been argued in the present case that a company represents purely a means of achieving the economic purpose of its members, namely the shareholders, while they themselves constitute in fact the reality behind it. It has furthermore been repeatedly emphasized that there exists between a company and its shareholders a relationship describable as a community of destiny. The alleged acts may have been directed at the company and not the shareholders, but only in a formal sense: in reality, company and shareholders are so closely interconnected that prejudicial acts committed against the former necessarily wrong the latter; hence any acts directed against a company can be conceived as directed against its shareholders, because both can be considered in substance, i.e., from the economic viewpoint, identical. Yet even if a company is no more than a means for its shareholders to achieve their economic purpose, so long as it is in esse it enjoys an independent existence. Therefore the interests of the shareholders are both separable and indeed separated from those of the company, so that the possibility of their diverging cannot be denied. 46. It has also been contended that the measures complained of, although taken with respect to Barcelona Traction and causing it direct damage, constituted an unlawful act vis-?-vis Belgium, because they also, though indirectly, caused damage to the Belgian shareholders in Barcelona Traction. This again is merely a different way of presenting the distinction between injury in respect of a</page><page sequence="37">263 right and injury to a simple interest. But, as the Court has indi cated, evidence that damage was suffered does not ipso facto justify a diplomatic claim. Persons suffer damage or harm in most varied circumstances. This in itself does not involve the obligation to make reparation. Not a mere interest affected, but solely a right infringed involves responsibility, so that an act directed against and infringing only the company's rights does not involve responsibility towards the shareholders, even if their interests are affected. 47. The situation is different if the act complained of is aimed at the direct rights of the shareholder as such. It is well known that there are rights which municipal law confers upon the latter distinct from those of the company, including the right to any declared dividend, the right to attend and vote at general meetings, the right to share in the residual assets of the company on liquidation. Whenever one of his direct rights is infringed, the shareholder has an independent right of action. On this there is no disagreement between the Parties. But a distinction must be drawn between a direct infringement of the shareholder's rights, and difficulties or financial losses to which he may be exposed as the result of the situation of the company. *l8. The Belgian Government claims that shareholders of Belgian nationality suffered damage in consequence of unlawful acts of the Spanish authorities and, in particular, that the Barcelona Traction shares, though they did not cease to exist, were emptied of all real economi? content. It accordingly contends that the shareholders had an independent right to redress, notwithstanding the fact that the acts complained of were directed against the company as such. Thus the legal issue is reducible to the question of whether it is legitimate to identify an attack on company rights, resulting in damage to shareholders, with the violation of their direct rights. 49. The Court has noted from the Application, and from the reply given by Counsel on 8 July 1969, that the Belgian Government did not base its claim on an infringement of the direct rights of the shareholders. Thus it is not open to the Court to go beyond the claim as formulated by the Belgian Government and it will not pursue its examination of this point any further. 50. In turning now to the international legal aspects of the case, the Court must, as already indicated, start from the fact that the present case essentially involves factors derived from municipal law - the distinction and the community between the company and. the shareholder - which the Parties, however widely their interpretations may differ, each take as the point of departure of their reasoning. If the Court were to decide the case in disregard of the relevant institutions of municipal law it would, without justification, invite serious legal difficulties. It would lose touch with reality, for there are no corresponding institutions of international law to which the Court could resort. Thus the Court has, as indicated, not only to take cognizance of municipal law but also to refer to it. It is to rules generally accepted by municipal legal systems which recognize</page><page sequence="38">264 the limited company whose capital is represented by shares, and not to the municipal law of a particular State, that international law refers. In referring to such rules, the Court cannot modify, still less deform them.' 51. On the international plane, the Belgian Government has advanced the proposition that it is inadmissible to deny the shareholders' national State a right of diplomatic protection merely on the ground that another State possesses a corresponding right in respect of the company itself. In strict logic and law this formulation of the Belgian claim to jus standi assumes the existence of the very right that requires demonstration. In fact the Belgian Government has repeatedly stressed that there exists no rule of international law which would deny the national State of the shareholders the right of diplomatic protection for the purpose of seeking redress pursuant to unlawful acts committed by another State against the company in which they hold shares. This, by emphasizing the absence of any express denial of the right, conversely implies the admission that there is no rule of international law which expressly confers such a right on the shareholders' national State. 52. International law may not, in some fields, provide specific rules in particular cases. In the concrete situation, the company against which allegedly unlawful acts were directed is expressly vested with a right, whereas no such right is specifically provided for the shareholder in respect of those acts. Thus the position of the company rests ori a positive rule,of both municipal and international law. As to the shareholder,; while he has certain rights expressly provided for him by municipal law as referred to in paragraph 42 above, appeal can, in the circumstances of the present case, only be made to the silence of international law; Such silence scarcely admits of interpretation in favour of the shareholder. 53? It is quite true, as was recalled in the course of oral argument in the present case, that concurrent claims are not excluded in the case of a person who, having entered the service of an international organization and retained his nationality, enjoys simultaneously the right to be protected by his national State and the right to be protected by the organization to which he belongs. This however is a case, of one person in possession of two separate bases of protection, each of which is valid (Reparation for Injuries Suffered in the Service of -frhe United Nations, Advisory Opinion, I.C.j, Reports 1949, p. 185). There is no analogy between such a situation and that of foreign shareholders in a company which has been the victim of a violation of international law which has caused them damage. 54. Part of the Belgian argument is founded on an attempt to assimilate interests to rights, relying on the use in many treaties and other instruments of such expressions as property, rights and interests. This is not, however, conclusive. Property is normally protected by law. Rights are ex hypothesi protected by law, otherwise they would not be rights. According to the Belgian Government, interests, although distinct from rights, are also protected by the aforementioned conventional rules. The Court is of the opinion that, for the purpose of interpreting the general rule of international law concerning</page><page sequence="39">265 diplomatic protection, which is its task, it has no need to determine the meaning of the term interests in the conventional rules, in other words to determine whether by this term the conventional rules refer to rights rather than simple interests. 55? The Court will now examine other grounds on which it is conceivable that the submission by the Belgian Government of a claim on behalf of shareholders in Barcelona Traction may be justified. 56. For the same reasons as before, the Court mast here refer to municipal law. Forms of incorporation and their legal personality have sometimes not been employe*} for the sole purposes they were originally intended to serve; sometimes the corporate entity has been unable to protect the rights of those who entrusted their financial resources to it; thus inevitably there have arisen dangers of abuse, as in the case of many other institutions of law. Here, then, as elsewhere, the law, confronted with economic realities, has had to provide protective measures and remedies in the interests of those within the corporate entity as well as of those outside who have dealings with it: the lav; has recognized that the independent existence of the legal entity cannot be treated as an absolute. It is in this context that the process of "lifting the corporate veil" or "disregarding the legal entity" has been found justified and equitable in certain circumstances or for certain purposes. The wealth of practice already accumulated on the subject in municipal law indicates that the veil is lifted, for instance, to prevent the misuse of the privileges of legal personality, as in certain cases of fraud or malfeasance, to protect third persons such as a creditor or purchaser, or to prevent the evasion of legal requirements or of obligations. 57? Hence the lifting of the veil is more frequently employed from without, in the interest of those dealing with the corporate entity. However, it has also been operated from within, in the interest of - among others - the shareholders, but only in exceptional circumstances. 58. In accordance with the principle expounded above, the process of lifting the veil, being an exceptional one admitted by municipal law in respect of an institution of its own making, is equally admissible to play a similar role in international law. It follows that on the international plane also there may in principle be special circumstances which^justify the lifting of thd veil in the interest of shareholders. 59? Before proceeding, however, to consider whether such circum stances exist in the present case* it will be advisable to refer to two specific cases involving encroachment upon the legal entity, instances of which have been cited by the Parties. These ares first, the treatment of enemy and allied property, during and after the first and second world wars, in peace treaties and other inter national instruments; secondly, the treatment of foreign property consequent upon the nati?na]izations carried out in. recent years by many States.</page><page sequence="40">266 60. With regard to the first, enemy-property legislation was an instrument of economic warfare, aimed at denying the enemy the advantages to be derived from the anonymity and separate personality of corporations. Hence the lifting of the veil was regarded as justified ex necessitate and was extended to all entities which were tainted with enemy character, even the nationals of the State enacting the legislation. The provisions of the peace treaties had a very specific function; to protect allied property, and to seize and pool enemy property with a view to covering reparation claims. Such provisions are basically different in their rationale from those normally applicable. 61. Also distinct are the various arrangements made in respect of compensation for the nationalization of foreign property. Their rationale too, derived as it is from structural changes in a State's economy, differs from that of any normally applicable provisions. Specific agreements have been reached to meet specific situations, and the terms have varied from case to case. Par from evidencing any norm as to the classes of beneficiaries of compensation., such arrangements are sui generis and provide no guide in the present case, 62. Nevertheless, during the course of the proceedings both Parties relied on international instruments and judgments of international tribunals concerning these two specific areas. It should be clear that the developments in question have to be viewed as distinctive processes, arising out of circumstances peculiar to the respective situations. To seek to draw from them analogies or conclusions held to be valid in other fields is to ignore their specific character as lex specialis and hence to court error. 63. The Parties have also relied on the general arbitral jurisprudence which has accumulated in the last half-century. However, in most cases the decisions cited rested upon the terms of instruments establishing the jurisdiction of the tribunal or claims commission and determining what rights might enjoy protection; they cannot therefore give rise to generalization going beyond the special circumstances of each case Other decisions, allowing or disallowing claims by way of exception, are not, in view of the particular facts concerned, directly relevant to the present case. 64. The Court will now consider whether there might not be, in the present case, other special circumstances for which the general rule might not take effect. In this connection two particular situations must be studied: the case of the company having ceased to exist and the case of the company's national State lacking capacity to take action on its behalf. 65. As regards the first of these possibilities the Court observes that the Parties have put forward conflicting interpretations of the present situation of Barcelona Traction. There can, however, be no question but that Barcelona Traction has lost all its assets in Spain, and was placed in receivership in Canada, a receiver and manager having been appointed. It is common ground that from the economic viewpoint the company has been entirely paralysed. It has been deprived of all its Spanish sources of income, and the Belgian Government has asserted</page><page sequence="41">267 that the company could no longer find the funds for its legal defence, so that these had to be supplied by the shareholders. 66. It cannot, however, be contended that the corporate entity of the company has ceased to exist, or that it has lost its capacity to take corporate action. It was free to exercise such capacity in the Spanish courts and did in fact do so. It has not become incapable in law of defending its own rights and the interests of the shareholders. In particular, a precarious financial situation cannot be equated with the demise of the corporate entity, which is the hypothesis under consideration: the company's status in law is alone relevant, and not its economic condition, nor even the possibility of its being "practically defunct" - a description on which argument has been based but which lacks all legal precision. Only in the event of the legal demise of the company are the shareholders deprived of the possibility of a remedy available through the company; it is only if they became deprived of all such possibility that 'an independent right of action for them and their government could arise. 67. In the present case, Barcelona Traction is in receivership in the country of incorporation. Far from implying the demise of the entity or of its rights, this much rather denotes that those rights are preserved for so long as no liquidation has ensued. Though in receivership, the company continues to exist. Moreover, it is a matter of public record that the company's shares were quoted on the stock-market at a recent date. 68. The reason for the appointment in Canada not only of a receiver but also of a manager was explained as follows: "in the Barcelona Traction casje it was obvious, in view of the Spanish bankruptcy order of 12 February 19^8, that the appoint ment of only a receiver would be useless, as positive steps would have to be taken if any assets seized in the bankruptcy in Spain were to be recovered." (Hearing of 2 July 1969?) In brief, a manager was appointed in order to safeguard the company's rights; he has been in a position directly or indirectly to uphold them. Thus, even if the company is limited in its activity after being placed in receivership, there can be no doubt that it has retained its legal capacity and that the power to exercise it is vested in the manager appointed by the Canadian courts. The Court is thus not confronted with the first hypothesis contemplated in paragraph 64, and need not pronounce upon it. * 69. The Court will now turn to the second possibility, that of the lack of capacity of the company's national State to act on its behalf. The first question which must be asked here is whether Canada - the third apex of the triangular relationship - is, in law, the national State of Barcelona Traction. 70. In allocating corporate entities to States for purposes of diplomatic protection, international law is based, but only to a limited extent, on an analogy with the rules governing the nationality of</page><page sequence="42">268 individuals. The traditional rule attributes the right of . diplomatic protection of a corporate entity to the State under the laws of which it is incorporated and in whose territory it has its registered office. The?e two criteria have been confirmed by long practice and by numerous international instruments. This notwithstanding, further or different links are at times said to be required in order that a right of diplomatic protection should exist. Indeed, it has been the practice of some States to give a company incorporated under their law diplomatic protection solely when it has its seat (si?ge social) or management or centre of control in their territory, or when a majority or a substantial proportion of the shares has been owned by nationals of the State concerned. Only then, it has been held, does there exist between the corporation and the State in question a genuine connection of the kind familiar from other branches of international law. However, in the particular field of the diplomatic protection of corporate entities, no absolute test of the genuine connection has found general acceptance. Such tests as have been applied are of a relative nature, and sometimes links with one State have had to be weighed against those with another. In this connection reference has beeh made to the Nottebohm case. In fact the Parties made frequent reference to it in the course of the proceedings. However, given both the legal and factual aspects of protection in the present case the Court is of the opinion that there can be no analogy with the issues raised or the decision given in that case. 71? In the present case^ it is not disputed that the company was incorporated in Canada and has its registered office in that country. The incorporation of the company under the law of Canada was an act of free choice. Not only did the founders of the company seek its incorporation under Canadian law but it has remained under that law for a period of over fifty years. It has maintained in Canada its registered office, its accounts and its share registers. Board meetings were held there for many years; it has been listed in the records of the Canadian tax authorities. Thus a close and permanent connection has been established, fortified by the passage of over half a century. This connection is in no way weakened by the fact that the company engaged from the very outset in commercial activities outside Canada, for that was its declared object. Barcelona Traction's links with Canada are thus manifold. 72. Furthermore, the Canadian nationality of the company has received general recognition. Prior to the institution of proceedings before the Court, three other governments apart from that of Canada (those of the United Kingdom, the United States and Belgium) made representations concerning the treatment accorded to Barcelona Traction by the Spanish authorities. The United Kingdom Government intervened on behalf of bondholders and of shareholders. Several representations were also made by the United States Government, but not on behalf of the Barcelona Traction company as such. 73. Both governments acted at certain stages in close co-operation with the Canadian Government. An agreement was reached in 1950 on the setting-up of an independent committee of experts. While the Belgian and Canadian Governments contemplated a committee composed of Belgian, Canadian and Spanish members, the Spanish Government suggested a committee composed of British, Canadian and Spanish members.</page><page sequence="43">269 This was agreed to by the Canadian and United Kingdom Governments, and the task of the committee was, in particular, to establish the monies imported into Spain by Barcelona Traction or any of its subsidiaries, to determine and appraise the materials and services brought into the country, to determine and appraise the amounts withdrawn from Spain by Barcelona Traction or any of its subsidiaries, and to compute the profits earned in Spain by Barcelona Traction or any of its subsidiaries and the amounts susceptible of being withdrawn from the country at 31 December 19^9? 74. As to the Belgian Government, its earlier action was also under taken in close co-operation with the Canadian Government. The Belgian Government admitted the Canadian character of the company in the course of the present proceedings. It explicitly stated that Barcelona Traction was a company of neither Spanish nor Belgian nationality but a Canadian company incorporated in Canada. The Belgian Government has even conceded that it was not concerned with the injury suffered by Barcelona Traction itself, since that was Canada's affair. 75? The Canadian Government itself, which never appears to have doubted its right to intervene on the company's behalf, exercised the protection of Barcelona Traction by diplomatic representation for a number of years, in particular by its note of 27 March 1948, in which it alleged that a denial of justice had been committed in respect of the Barcelona Traction, Ebro and National Trust companies, and requested that the bankruptcy judgment be cancelled. It later invoked the Anglo-Spanish treaty of 1922 and the agreement of 1924, which applied to Canada. Further Canadian notes were addressed to the Spanish Government in 1950, 1951 and 1952. Further approaches were made in 195^* and in 1955 the Canadian Government renewed the expression of its deep interest in the affair of Barcelona Traction and its Canadian subsidiaries. 76. In sum, the record shows that from 1948 onwards the Canadian Government made to the Spanish Government numerous representations which cannot be viewed otherwise than as the exercise of diplomatic protection in respect of the Barcelona Traction company. Therefore this was not a case where diplomatic protection was refused or remained in the sphere of fiction. It is also clear that over the whole period of its diplomatic activity the Canadian Government proceeded in full knowledge of the Belgian attitude and activity. * 77? It Is true that at a certain point the Canadian Government ceased to act on behalf of Barcelona Traction, for reasons which have not been fully revealed, though a statement made in a letter of 19 July I955 by the Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs suggests that it felt the matter should be settled by means of private negotiations. The Canadian Government has nonetheless retained its capacity to exercise diplomatic protection; no legal impediment has prevented it from doing so; no fact has arisen to render this protection impossible. It has discontinued its action of its own free will.</page><page sequence="44">270 78. The Court would here observe that, within the limits prescribed by international law, a State may exercise diplomatic protection by whatever means and to whatever extent it thinks fit, for it is its oWn right that the State is asserting. Should the natural or legal persons on whose behalf it 3s acting consider that their rights are not adequately protected, they have no remedy in international law. All they can do is to resort to municipal law, if means are available, with a view to furthering their cause or obtaining redress. The municipal legislator may lay upon the State an obligation to protect its citizens abroad, and may also confer upon the national a right to demand the performance of that obligation, and clothe the right with corresponding sanctions. However, all these questions remain within the province of municipal law and do not affect the position internati onally. 79. The State must be viewed as the sole judge to decide whether its protection will be granted, to what extent it is granted, and when it will cease. It retains in this respect a discretionary power the exercise of which may be determined by considerations of a political or other nature, unrelated to the particular case. Since the claim of the State is not identical with that of the individual or corporate person whose cause is espoused, the State enjoys complete freedom of action. Whatever the reasons for any change of attitude, the fact cannot in itself constitute a justification for the exercise of diplomatic protection by another government, unless there is some independent and otherwise valid ground for that. 80. This cannot be regarded as amounting to a situation where a violation of law remains without remedy: in short, a legal vacuum. There is no obligation upon the possessors of rights to exercise them. Sometimes no remedy is sought, though rights are infringed. To equate this with the creation of a vacuum would be to equate a right with an obligation. 81. The cessation by the Canadian Government of the diplomatic protection of Barcelona Traction cannot, then, be interpreted to mean that there is no remedy against the Spanish Government for the damage done by the allegedly unlawful acts of the Spanish authorities. It is not a hypothetical right which was vested in Canada, for there is no legal impediment preventing the Canadian Government from protect ing Barcelona Traction. Therefore there is no substance in the argument that for the Belgian Government to bring a claim before the Court represented the only possibility of obtaining redress for the damage suffered by Barcelona Traction and, through it, by its shareholders. 82. Nor can the Court agree with the view that the Canadian Government had of necessity to interrupt the protection it was giving to Barcelona Traction, and to refrain from pursuing it by means of other procedures, solely because there existed no link of compulsory jurisdiction between Spain and Canada. International judicial proceedings are but one of tine means available to States in pursuit of their right to exercise diplomatic protection (Reparation for Injuries Suffered in the Service of the United Nations, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1949, p. 17?TT The lack of a jurisdictional link cannct be regarded either in this or in other fields of international law as entailing the non-existence of a right.</page><page sequence="45">271 83? The Canadian Government's right of protection in respect of the Barcelona Traction company remains unaffected by the present proceedings. The Spanish Government has never challenged the Canadian nationality of the company, either in the diplomatic correspondence with the Canadian Government or before the Court. Moreover it has unreservedly recognized Canada as the national State of Barcelona Traction in both written pleadings and oral statements made in the course of the present pro ceedings. Consequently, the Court considers that the Spanish Govern ment has not questioned Canada's right to protect the company. 84. Though, having regard to the character of the case, the question of Canada's right has not been before it, the Court has considered it necessary to clarify this issue. 85? The Court will now examine the Belgian claim from a different point of view, disregarding municipal law and relying on the rule that in inter-State relations, whether claims are made on behalf of a State's national or on behalf of the State itself, they are always the claims of the State. As the Permanent Court said, "The question, therefore, whether the ... dispute originates in an injury to a private interest, which in point of fact is the case in many international disputes, is irrelevant from this standpoint." (Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions, Judgment No. 2, 192k, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 2, p. 12. See also Nottebohm, Second Phase, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1955, P. 247) 86. Hence the Belgian Government would be entitled to bring a claim if it could show that one of its rights had been infringed and that the acts complained of involved the breach of an international obligation arising out of a treaty or a general rule of law. The opinion has been expressed that a claim can accordingly be made when investments by a State's nationals abroad are thus prejudicially affected, and that since such investments are part of a State's national economic resources, any prejudice to them directly involves the economic interest of the State. 87. Governments have been known to intervene in such circumstances not only when their interests were affected, but also when they were threatened. However, it must be stressed that this type of action is quite different from and outside the field of diplomatic protection. When ? State admits into its territory foreign investments or foreign nationals it is, as indicated in paragraph 33* bound to extend to them the protection of the law. However, it does not thereby become an insurer of that part of another State's wealth which these investments represent. Every investment of this kind carries certain risks. The real question is whether a right has been violated, which right could only be the right of the State to have its nationals enjoy a certain treatment guaranteed by general international law, in the absence of a treaty applicable to the particular case. On the other hand it has been stressed that it must be proved that the investment effectively belongs to a particular economy. This is, as it is admitted, sometimes very difficult, in particular where complex undertakings are involved.</page><page sequence="46">272 Thus the existing concrete test would be replaced by one which might lead to a situation in which no diplomatic protection could be exercised, with the consequence that an unlawful act by another State would remain without remedy. 88. It follows from what has already been stated above that, where it is a question of an unlawful act committed against a company representing foreign capital, the general rule of international law authorizes the national State of the company alone to make a claim. 89. Considering the important developments of the last half-century, the growth of foreign investments and the expansion of the international activities of corporations, in particular of holding companies, which are often multinational, and considering the way in which the economic interests of States have proliferated, it may at first sight appear surprising that the evolution of law has not gone further and that no generally accepted rules in the matter have crystallized on the inter national plane. Nevertheless, a more thorough examination of the facts shows that the law on the subject has been formed in a period characterized by an intense conflict of systems and interests. It. is essentially bilateral relations which have been concerned, relations in which the rights of both the State exercising diplomatic protection and the State in respect of which protection is sought have had to be safeguarded. Here ajs elsewhere, a body of rules could only have developed with the consent of those concerned. The difficulties encountered have been reflected in the evolution of the law on the subject. 90. Thus, in the present state of the law, the protection of shareholders requires that recourse be had to treaty stipulations or .special agreements directly concluded between the private investor and the State in which the investment is placed. States ever more frequently provide for such protection, in both bilateral and multilateral relations, either by means of special instruments or within the ? framework of wider economic arrangements. Indeed, whether in the form of multilateral or bilateral treaties between States, or in that of agreements between States and companies, there has since the second world war been considerable development in the protection of foreign investments. The instruments in question contain provisions eus to jurisdiction and procedure in case of disputes concerning the treatment of investing companies by the States in which they invest capital. Sometimes companies are themselves vested with a direct right to defend their interests against States through prescribed procedures. No such instrument is in force between the Parties to the present case. 91. With regard more p?rti?ularly to human rights, to which reference has already been made in paragraph 3^ of this Judgment, it should be noted that these also include protection against denial of justice. However, on the universal level, the instruments which embody human rights do not confer on States the capacity to protect the victims of infringements of such rights irrespective of their nationality. It is therefore still on the regional level that a jsolution to this problem has had to be sought; thus, within the Council of Europe, of which Spain is not a member, the problem of admissibility encountered</page><page sequence="47">273 by the claim in the present case has been resolved by the European Convention on Human Rights, which entitles each State which is a party to the Convention to lodge a complaint against any other contracting State for violation of the Convention, irrespective of the nationality of the victim. # 92. Since the general rule on the subject does not entitle the Belgian Government to put forward a claim in this case, the question remains to be considered whether nonetheless, as the Belgian Government has contended during the proceedings, considerations of equity do not require that it be held to possess a right of protection. It is quite true that it has been maintained, that, for reasons of equity, a State should be able, in certain cases, to take up the protection of its nationals, shareholders in a company which has been the victim of a violation of international law. Thus a theory has been developed to the effect that the State of the shareholders has a right of diplomatic protection when the State whose responsibility is invoked is the national State of the company. Whatever the validity of this theory may be, it is certainly ntft applicable to the present case, since Spain is not the national State of Barcelona Traction. 93. On the other hand, the Court considers that, in the field of diplomatic- protection as in all other fields of international law, it is necessary that the law be applied reasonably. It has been suggested that if in a given case it is not possible to apply the-general rule that the right of diplomatic protection of a company belongs to its national State, considerations of equity might call for the possibility of protection of the shareholders in question by their own national State. This hypothesis does not correspond to the circumstances of the present case. 9^; In vi?w, however, of the discretionary nature of diplomatic protection, considerations of equity cannot require m?re than the possibility for some protector State to intervene, whether it be the national State of the company, by virtue of the general rule mentioned above, or, in a secondary capacity, the national State of the share holders who claim protection. In this connection, account should also be taken of the practical effects of deducing from considerations of ?quity any broader right of protection for the national State of the shareholders. It must first of all be observed that it would be difficult on an equitable basis to make distinctions according to any quantitative test: it would seem that the owner of 1 per cent, and the owner of 90 per cent, of the share-capital should have the same possibility of enjoying the benefit of diplomatic protection. The protector State may, of course, be disinclined to take up the case of the single small shareholder, but it could scarcely be denied the right to do so in the name of equitable considerations. In that field, protection by the national State of the shareholders can hardly be graduated according to the absolute or relative size of the shareholding involved. 95. The Belgian Government, it is true, has also contended that as high a proportion as 88 per cent, of the shares in Barcelona Traction allegedly belonged to natural or juristic persons of Belgian nationality,</page><page sequence="48">274 and it has used this as an argument for the purpose not only of determining the amount of the damages which it claims, tut also of establishing its right of action on behalf of the Belgian shareholders. Nevertheless, this does not alter the Belgian Government's position, as expounded in the course of the proceedings, which implies, in the last analysis, that it might be sufficient for one single share to belong to a national of a given State for the latter to be entitled to exercise its diplomatic protection. 96. The Court considers that the adoption of the theory of diplomatic protection of shareholders as such, by opening the door to competing diplomatic claims, could create an atmosphere of confusion and insecurity in international economic relations. The danger would be all the greater inasmuch as the shares of companies whose activity is international are widely scattered and frequently change hands. It might perhaps be claimed that, if the right of protection belonging to the national States of the shareholders were considered as only secondary to that of the national State of the company, there would be less danger of difficulties of the kind contemplated. However, the Court must state that the essence of a secondary right is that it only comes into existence at the time when the original right ceases to exist. As the right of protection vested in the national State of the company cannot be regarded as extinguished because it is not exercised, it is not possible to accept the proposition that in case of its non-exercise the national States of the shareholders have a right of protection secondary to that of the national State of the company. Furthermore, study of factual situations in which this theory might possibly be applied gives rise to the following observations. 97? The situations in which foreign shareholders in a company wish to have recourse to diplomatic protection by their own national State may vary. It may happen that the national State of the company simply refuses to grant it its diplomatic protection, or that it begins to exercise it (as in the present case) but does not pursue its action to the end. It may also happen that the national State of the company and the State which has committed a violation of international law with regard to the company arrive at a settlement of the matter, by agreeing on compensation for the company, but that the foreign shareholders find the compensation insufficient. Now, as a matter of principle, it would be difficult to draw a distinction between these three cases so far as the protection of foreign shareholders by their national State is concerned, since in each case they may have suffered real damage. Furthermore, the national State of the company is pefectly free to decide how far it is appropriate for it to protect the company, and is not bound to make public the reasons for its decision. To reconcile this discretionary power of the company's national State with a right of protection falling to the shareholders' national State would be particularly difficult when the former State has concluded, with the State which has contravened international law with regard to the company, an agreement granting the company compensation which the foreign shareholders find inadequate. If, after such a settlement, the national State of the foreign shareholders could in its turn put forward a claim based on the same facts, this would be likely to introduce into the negotiation of this kind of agreement a lack of security which would be contrary to the stability which it is the object of international law to establish in international relations.</page><page sequence="49">275 98. It is quite true, as recalled in paragraph 53, that international law recognizes parallel rights of protection in the case of a person in the service of an international organization. Nor is the possibility excluded of concurrent claims being made on behalf of persons having dual nationality, although in that case lack of a genuine link with one of the two States may be set up against the exercise by that State of the right of protection. It must be observed, however, that in these two types of situation the number of possible protectors is necessarily very small, and their identity normally not difficult to determine. In this respect such cases of dual protection are markedly different from the claims to which recognition of a general right of protection of foreign shareholders by their various national States might give rise. 99? It should also be observed that the promoters of a company whose operations will be international must take into account the fact that States have, with regard to their nationals, a discretionary power to grant diplomatic protection or to refuse it. When establishing a company in a foreign country, its promoters are normally impelled by particular considerations; it is often a question of tax or other advantages offered by the host State. It does not seem to be in any way inequitable that the advantages thus obtained should be balanced by the risks arising from the fact that the protection of the company and hence of its shareholders is thus entrusted to a State other than the national State of the shareholders. 100. In the present case, it is clear from what has been said above that Barcelona Traction was never reduced to a position of impotence such that it could not have approached its national State, Canada, to ask for its diplomatic protection, and that, as far as appeared to the Court, there was nothing to prevent Canada from continuing to grant its diplomatic protection to Barcelona Traction if it had considered that it should do so. 101. For the above reasons, the Court is not of the opinion that, in the particular circumstances of the present case, jus standi is conferred on the Belgian Government by considerations of equity. 102. In the course of the proceedings, the Parties have submitted a great amount of documentary and other evidence intended to substantiate their respective submissions. Of this evidence the Court has taken cognizance. It has been argued on one side that unlawful acts had been committed by the Spanish judicial and administrative authorities, and that as a result of those acts Spain has incurred international responsibility. On the other side it has been argued that the activities of Barcelona Traction and its subsidiaries were conducted in violation of Spanish law and caused damage to the Spanish economy. If both contentions were substantiated, the truth of the latter would in no way provide justification in respect of the former. The Court fully appreciates the importance of the legal problems raised by the allegation, which is at the root of the Belgian claim for reparation, concerning th? denials of justice allegedly committed by organs of the Spanish State. However, the possession by the Belgian Government of a right of protection is a prerequisite for the examination of these problems. Since no jus standi before the Court has been established, it is not for the Court in its Judgment to pronounce upon any other</page><page sequence="50">276 aspect of the case, on which it should take a decision only if the Belgian Government had a right of protection in respect of its nationals, shareholders in Barcelona Traction. 103. Accordingly, THE COURT rejects the Belgian Government's claim by fifteen votes to one, twelve votes of the majority being based on the reasons set out in the present Judgment. Done in French and in English, the French text being authoritative, at the Peace Palace, The Hague, this fifth day of February, one thousand nine hundred and seventy, in three copies, one of which will be placed in the Archives of the Court and the others transmitted to the Government of the Kingdom of Belgium and to the Government of the Spanish State, respectively. (Signed) J.L. BUSTAMENTE Y RIVERO, President. (Signed) S. AQUARONE, Registrar. Judge PETREN and Judge ONYEAMA make the following joint declaration: We agree with the operative provision and the reasoning of the Judgnent subject to the following declaration: With regard to the nationality of Barcelona Traction, the Judgment refers to the existence of opinions to the effect that the absence of a genuine 'connection between a company and the State claiming the right of diplomatic protection of the company might be set up against the exercise of such a right. In this context the Judgment also mentions the decision in the Nottebohm case to the effect that the absence of a genuine connecting link between a State and a natural person who has acquired its nationality may be set up against the exercise by that State of diplomatic protection of the person concerned. The present Judgment then concludes that given the legal and factual aspects of protection in the present case there can be no analogy with the issues raised or the decision given in the Nottebohm case.</page><page sequence="51">Now in the present case the Spanish Government has asserted and the Belgian Government has not disputed that, Barcelona Traction having been incorporated under Canadian law and having its registered office in Toronto, it is of Canadian nationality and Canada is qualified to protect it. Canada's right of protection being thus recognized by both Parties to the proceedings, the first question which the Court has to answer within the framework of the third preliminary objection is simply whether, alongside the right of protection pertaining to the national State of a company, another State may have a right of protection of the shareholders of the company who are its nationals. This being so, the Court has not in this case to consider the question whether the genuine connection principle is applicable to the diplomatic protection of juristic persons, and, still less, to speculate whether, if it is, valid objections could have been raised against the exercise by Canada of diplomatic protection of Barcelona Traction. Judge LACHS makes the following declaration: I am in full agreement with the reasoning and conclusions of the Judgment, but would wish to add the following observation: The Court has found, in the light of the relevant elements of law and of fact, that the Applicant, the Belgian Government, has no capacity in the present case. At the same time it has stated that the Canadian Government's right of protection in respect of the Barcelona Traction company has remained unaffected by the proceedings now closed. I consider that the existence of this right is an essential premise of the Court's reasoning, and that its importance is emphasized by the seriousness of the claim and the particular nature of the unlawful acts with which it charges certain authorities of the respondent State.

A.</page><page sequence="52">SEPARATE OPINION OP JUDGE SIR GERALD PITZMAURICE I INTRODUCTORY 1. Although (if with some reluctance) I agree and have voted with the majority of the Court in finding the Belgian claim in this case to be inadmissible, and broadly for the principal reason on which the Judgment is based - namely that in respect of an injury done to a company, prima facie the company's government alone can sustain an international claim - I have a somewhat different attitude on various aspects of the matter, which I wish to indicate. In particular (a) I would go considerably further than does the Judgment in accepting limitations on the principle of the "hegemony" of the company and its government; - furthermore (b), though I have felt bound to vote as I have, I nevertheless hold it to be an unsatisfactory state of the law that obliges the Court to refrain from pronouncing on the substantive merits of the Belgian claim, on the basis of what is really - at least in the actual circumstances of this case - somewhat of a technicality. II THE QUESTION OF BELGIUM'S LOCUS STANDI IN JUDICIO^ ^ Although I now agree with my colleague Judge Morelli1s view that the question of Belgium's right to claim on behalf of the Barcelona Traction Company's shareholders, in so far as Belgian, is really a question of substance not of capacity (because the underlying issue is what rights do the shareholders themselves have), it is convenient for immediate purposes to treat the matter as one of Belgian Government standing.</page><page sequence="53">279 21. Must the Canadian nationality of the Company then rule out the Belgian claim? In the present state of the law it would seem that it must. In connection with this conclusion, however, a number of points have to be considered in order to show why, although it is correct on the basis of extant law, this law itself, as it now stands, is in this respect unsatisfactory. 22. The first of these points is that, as required by the logic of the considerations indicated in paragraphs 5 to 13 supra, if on the domestic plane there are circumstances in which some action is open to the shareholders notwithstanding that it is prima facie the company's position, rather than (directly) their own, that is in question, - then in corresponding circumstances, the government of the shareholders should, on the international plane, be entitled to intervene and claim. One such case has already been discussed supra in paragraphs 14-20: the company is defunct or paralyzed and there can be no question of intervention or claim by its government, for the latter is itself the tortfeasor government, if wrong there has been. Similarly, if international law is to remain faithful to the concept of the company and, in dealing with the latter on the international plane, is to give due effect to its essential elements, then it must provide for the case where the company's government - not being the tortfeasor government (but also not being the government of the majority of the shareholders) - for reasons of its own that have nothing to do with the interests of the company (see supra paragraph 10) refuses or fails to intervene, even though there may be a good, or apparently good case in law for doing so, and the interests of the</page><page sequence="54">280 company require it. Just as on the domestic plane an analogous failure or refusal on the part of the management of the company would normally enable the shareholders to act, either (if the element of dolus or culpa were present) by legal action against the management, or against the tortfeasor or contract-breaking third party, - or else through the internal processes of the company; - so also, on the international plane., ought the inaction of the company's government enable that of the shareholders to act - (and obviously there would be ways of resolving the practical difficulties of the company's government subsequently changing its mind - if the servants of the lav/ cared to work them out; - I think that in this respect the concluding paragraphs of the Court's Judgment make too much of this matter.). 23. In fact, international law does not at present allow of this - except possibly in the one case of the company's government being actually disqualified at law from acting (as to which see infra, para graphs 2?-?2 . The reasons for this insufficiency - for such it is - may be perfectly understandable, but this does not alter the fact that international law is in this respect an under-developed system as compared with private law, and that it fails to provide the recourses necessary for protecting on the international plane the interests not merely of the shareholders but of the company itself. What are these reasons? They are of course that a government is not in the same position as a company and cannot be made subject to the same constraints. The management of a company owes a duty, not only to the company but to the shareholders, and is bound to act in the best interests of the</page><page sequence="55">281 company, and hence of the shareholders, basing itself on an informed and well-weighed estimate of what these are. A government is under no such duty. It is perfectly free on policy grounds to ignore the interests of the company or even to act in a manner it knows to be contrary to these; and if it does this, there are no international means of recourse against it, such as there would be against the management of a company so acting on the internal plane. There is no means, internationally, of proceeding against a government which refuses to intervene on behalf of, or support, the claim of one of its nationals or national companies^, - nor could such a refusal conceivably entail the breach of any general international law obligation. Still less of course is there any means of changing or replaoing a government which refuses or fails to act as, internally, the shareholders may be able to do as regards the company1s management. 24. All this at present provides an excuse for saying, as the law now does, that if the company's government does not act no other one can. Instead, it should constitute a reason for coming to precisely the opposite conclusion. An enlightened rule, while recognizing that the national government of the company can never be required to intervene, and that its reasons for not doing so cannot be questioned even though they may have nothing to do with the merits *u Theoretically, the internal law of the country concerned might provide a means of recourse against the government in such circumstances: and political action might be possible. But in neither case would the essential point be affected.</page><page sequence="56">282 of the claim, would simply provide that in such event the government of the shareholders may do so^l - particularly if, as Is frequently the case, it is just because the shareholding is mainly foreign that the government of the company feels that no sufficient national interest exists to warrant intervention on its pp own part . The law's present attitude is based on predicating for the company's government not merely a prima facie right (which would be understandable) but an exclusive one (which is not). There is no reason of principle why, if the law so wills, failure to utilize a right of action by the party prima facie entitled to do so should not sanction its exercise by another party whose material interest in the matter may actually be greater. Practical difficulties there might be; but this is not a serious objection where no inherent necessity of the law stands in the way. That such a situation of primary and secondary (or latent) entitlement to act can work, if properly regulated, seems to be indicated by the shareholders' possibilities of action on the domestic plane, as earlier described. 21 I am not greatly impressed by the point which comes up in several connections that the Belgian position, with a big block of majority shareholding, is peculiar, and that in other cases there might be foreign shareholders of several nationalities and a consequent multiplicity of claims. This would only go to the quantum of reparation recoverable by the various governments, - and once the principle of claims on behalf of shareholders had been admitted for such circumstances, it would not be difficult to work out ways of avoiding a multiplicity of proceedings, which is what would really matter. 22 This is or has been the settled policy of a number of governments. I am not impressed by the argument that those who acquire shares in companies not of their own nationality must be deemed to know that this risk exists. That does not seem to me to affect the principle of the matter.</page><page sequence="57">283 25. International law must in consequence be regarded as deficient and underdeveloped in this field because, while retaining the rule of the "hegemony" of the company and its government, it fails to provide those safeguards and alternatives which private law has instituted for preventing the hegemony of the company's management leading to abuse. More exactly, what the law enjoins, and the Judgment of the Court therefore inevitably endorses (see its para graphs 66, 77-83 and 93), is the by-passing of the difficulty by a sort of "ostrich-act" - a hiding of the face in the sands of the fiction that so long as it remains theoretically possible for the company's government to act (and however little reality there may be about this possibility), no other government can do so. Thus the law allows the company's government eternally to dangle before the foreign shareholder the carrot of a hypothetical protection that will never be exercised, and tells the hungry fellow that he must be satisfied with this because, although he will never be allowed to eat that carrot, it will always remain there to be looked at2?! International law has of course to accept the fact that governments cannot be compelled to act or be changed. But it does not have to accept (and even positively decree) that nevertheless no other government can ever act - that the carrot must be eternally dangled but never eaten - the maiden ever pursued but never attained! - (see footnote 23 below). J Or, like the nymph pursued by the ephebus, as depicted in the timeless stasis of the Attic vase that inspired the poet Keats' celebrated Ode on a Grecian Urn (verse 2, lines 7-10): !,Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss, Though winning near the goal - yet, do not grieve; She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss, Forever wilt thou love, and she be fairI"</page><page sequence="58">284 V ISSUES CONNECTED WITH THE FOURTH PRELIMINARY OBJECTION 66. The Judgment of the Court does not deal with the fourth preliminary objection that had been advanced on the Spanish side and which, together with the third, was joined to the merits by the Judgment which the Court gave in the preliminary (1964) phase of the case - namely the question of the exhaustion of local remedies. On the other hand, this question has had its importance for certain Members of the Court, and it was always possible that individual rejections of the Belgian claim might be based not on Belgium1 s lack of ius standi but on the view that the Barcelona Company did not adequately avail itself of the means of recourse open to it in the Spanish courts. (1) The issue of jurisdiction 67. While the question of Spanish jurisdiction to conduct bankruptcy proceedings in respect of Barcelona Traction, a Canadian company, is not technically part of the fourth preliminary objection, which concerns the exhaustion of local remedies, it is related to it in an important way, as will be seen; and since it too has a certain preliminary character, it may properly receive some consideration here.</page><page sequence="59">285 68. It appears to me probable that, considered at the 54 international level , the declaration of bankruptcy made in respect of the Barcelona Company did involve an excess of legitimate, or at. least normal, Spanish jurisdiction - internationally. This view is not of course based on the non-Spanish.nationality of the Company, - still less because of doubts (though these certainly subsist) as to whether the Company did, in the proper sense of these notions, carry on business in Spain, or own property or have a domicile or seat there^. It is based on the nature of the alleged default on which the petition in bankruptcy was based, and acceded to by the court. The point may be illustrated by reference to Barcelona's subsidiary, EERO^, which, although equally a Canadian company, did undoubtedly carry on business in Spain, owning property, occupying offices, etc., there. Consequently, had it been EBRO that was bankrupted, and for non payment of commercial debts arising out of its local activities, no question of any excess of jurisdiction could have arisen despite EBRO's Canadian nationality - for such matters would have'been legitimately of Spanish concern. (it was indeed noticeable that it was expressly admitted on the Belgian side that the bankrupting of EBRO (had that occurred) would have been quite proper, jurisdictionally.) 54 The question whether there was jurisdiction under Spanish law, in the circumstances appertaining to the Barcelona .Company, is irrelevant or inconclusive for international purposes, since the very question at issue in international proceedings is whether the jurisdiction which a State confers upon its own courts, or otherwise assumes, is internationally valid. 55 Barcelona was a holding company, and a holding company is by definition not an operating company. This has been brought out in several decided cases, but is too often lost sight of. 56 Standing for "Ebro Irrigation and Power Co. Ltd."</page><page sequence="60">286 But Barcelona was not bankrupted for anything of that kind, as is clear from the bankruptcy judgment itself. It was bankrupted exclusively for the non-payment of the interest on its sterling bonds, issued outside Spain, and also held outside Spain except in so far as certain private Spanish parties had;recently acquired a few of them, apparently for the express purpose of bringing the bankruptcy pro ceedings. Yet in respect of these same bonds, issued under Canadian law, all the necessary machinery for the guaranteeing and enforcement of the obligation, through a semi-official Canadian authority, the National Trust, had been set up, and existed for utilization in Canada, where also, in the last resort, the Company could have been made the subject of proceedings fior the appointment of a receiver. 69. Clearly, if the real object had been to obtain payment of the arrears of interest on the bonds, action would have been taken in Canada, - and not merely would but should, for the step taken by the Spanish bankruptcy petitioners was in clear breach of the important "no action" provisions of both the trust deeds - ^lauses 44 of the Prior Lien deed and 35 of the First Mortgage deed - Annex 28 to the Memorial, Vol. I). These provisions were of course conditions of the bond obligation, by which the petitioners automatically became bound on acquiring the bonds. They provided that no proceedings to obtain payment should be taken by any bondholder until after the (Canadian) Trustee had, upon a request to act, refused or neglected to do so. 70. In these circumstances the primary jurisdiction was clearly Canadian, and the Spanish courts should have declined jurisdiction, at least in the first instance and until the remedies available through the Canadian National Trust had been invoked. It is true</page><page sequence="61">287 that, under present conditions, international law does not impose hard and fast rules on States delimiting spheres of national jurisdiction in such matters (and there are of course others - for instance in the fields of shipping, "anti-trust" legislation, etc.), but leaves to States a wide discretion in the matter. It does however (a) postulate the existence of limits - though in any given case it may be for the tribunal to indicate what these are for the purposes of that case; and (b) involve for every State an obligation to exercise moderation and restraint as to the extent of the jurisdiction assumed by its courts in cases having a foreign element, and to avoid undue encroach ment on a jurisdiction more properly appertaining to, or more appropriately exercisable by, another State. 71? These considerations apply equally, not only to the initial Spanish assumption of jurisdiction in bankruptcy, but to various later stages of the bankruptcy proceedings themselves, and in particular (as part of the process of finally disposing of the Barcelona Company's Spanish undertaking) to the purported cancellation of its shares in EBRO (a Canadian company) - these being at the time under the control of the Canadian National Trust or of a receiver appointed by the Canadian courts - and the "replacement" of these by scrip issued in Spain, and subsequently sold to the new and specially formed Spanish company, FECSA^, without any reference to the competent Canadian authorities or any action to procure the enforcement of these measures in Canada, so that there (and everywhere outside Spain) the original scrip remained and remains perfectly valid. The same observations apply to the purported transfer of EBRO1s Canadian share register, 57 ~ Standing for "Fuerzas El?ctricas de Catalu?a, S.A."</page><page sequence="62">its Canadian registered offices, and its very seat itself (also Canadian), to the city of Barcelona, - in disregard of the fact that these things, which could not physically be transferred without EERO's consent or enforcement action in Canada, remained where they were, and are still there today, not only in actuality but in law, seeing that EBRO is a Canadian company whose status, seat, and location of share register and registered offices are all governed by Canadian law. In short what really took place appears to have had the character of a disguised expropriation of the undertaking. 72. If therefore it were necessary to reach a conclusion on this matter, it could in my view only be in the sense that the whole bankruptcy proceedings were, for excess of jurisdiction, internationally null and void ab initio, and without effect on the international plane. * * (2) Exhaustion of local remedies: the question of notification 73. The conclusion just indicated would also be of importance as regards the question of exhausting local remedies, in so far as it might tend to suggest that, strictly, this question did not arise at all, - for there should be no necessity to exhaust such remedies in respect of proceedings which, for excess of jurisdiction were, internationally, a nullity and void ab initlo. At least, in respect of the substance of the proceedings, there could be no such obligation if - internationally the proceedings were vitiated from the start. (Signed) G.G. FITZMAURICE</page><page sequence="63">SEPARATE OPINION OP JUDGE TANAKA 289 I Although I subscribe to the Court's conclusion in dismissing the Belgian claim that Spain violated an international obligation and incurred responsibility vis-?-vis Belgium, I regret to have to say that my view differs from that of the Court in its reasoning. The majority opinion reached its conclusion by deciding the question of the jus standi of Belgium in the negative, i.e., by upholding the third preliminary objection of the Spanish Government, whereas my position, would be to proceed to examine the question of the merits, after the third and fourth (non-exhaustion of local remedies) preliminary objections. An examination of the merits, however, leads to the same result as that reached by the majority opinion, namely the dismissal of the Belgian claim. The argument of the Spanish Government which denies the right of diplomatic protection of shareholders in favour of the national State of the Barcelona Traction Company, namely Canada, is precisely based on the above-mentioned theory of a juridical personality recognized as being distinct from its members. The Belgian Government on the contrary, wishes to advocate its position by arguing from a fundamental theory concerning the juridical person. It intends to defend its viewpoint on the strength of the doctrine of fiction, which denies the real existence of the juridical person by reducing it to a simple conglomeration of its constituent members and minimizing the juridical person as being a mere legal</page><page sequence="64">290 technique that makes it possible for plural individuals to own property or conclude a transaction. However, we must approach the issue in question from a different angle. The question should be considered on quite another plane. What we have seen above and what the Spanish Government has put forward are arguments concerned with the juridical concept of corporation in the meaning of municipal law, private law and particularly commercial law, and they deal with this concept only. Law relating to corporations is concerned with matters of private law, namely private interests, relationships between corporation, shareholders and third parties. Company law in respect of incorporation, formation, ultra vires, capital, its increase and reduction, organs, the rights and duties of shareholders (particularly limited liability), the transfer of shares, accounts, the issuing of bonds, dissolution, liquidation, etc., is above all related to internal matters of corporations, or business transactions with outsiders and belongs to the plane of municipal law. The principles prevailing in these matters are directed, on the one hand, to the protection of third parties, namely the creditors of a company, and on the other hand, to the protection of the shareholders in the company itself. These principles are not in themselves connected in any way with international law. It is true that the internationally wrongful acts allegedly committed by the Spanish administrative or judicial State organs, such as refusal of the transfer of foreign currency, the bankruptcy judgment of 12 February 19^8, etc., are directed to the Barcelona Traction</page><page sequence="65">291 Company, whioh possesses Canadian nationality. Accordingly, the Spanish Government argues that only Canada, the national State of the company, is entitled to exercise its diplomatic protection. This argument is based on the municipal law concept of the corporation on which we made observations above and according to which only the corporate personality prevails regarding external matters. According to this concept, since only the company could be the victim of a wrongful act, the damage suffered by the shareholders should be indemnified through the company indirectly. In short, only the national State of the company would be entitled to exercise diplomatic protection and not the national State of the shareholders. It is also true that the national State of a company is entitled to take measures of diplomatic protection on behalf of the company, assuming that the bond of nationality is effective, and that the national State is materially interested in the protection of the company. But there are many cases where the nationality of the company is not effective, where the bond between the national State of the company and the shareholders is lacking and, accordingly, the national State is not inclined to exercise the right of protection. There may exist another circumstance for the national State of the company, such as the fact that between this State and the State responsible,for the wrongful acts a nexus of compulsory jurisdiction is lacking; or the former State, for some political or other reasons may not wish to pursue diplomatic protection against the latter State; or diplomatic protection by the former State might not bring a satisfactory result, etc. Under these circumstances there remains no other remedy than that the national State of the shareholders should take the initiative for the purpose of the protection of its nationals. A vacuum with respect to protection</page><page sequence="66">292 should not be tolerated: otherwise shareholders would be left in an entirely helpless condition and the result would be injustice and inequity which would be harmful for the healthy development of international investment. As one of the objections raised to the above-mentioned argument in favour of diplomatic protection of a national State of shareholders, we may point out the difficulty which would be produced by the cumulative existence or competitive concurrence of rights of several States concerning the same object of diplomatic protection. It follows that in the case of multinational composition of capital, more than one national State of shareholders might intervene on the condition that the jurisdictional basis exists, either by the way of intervention as provided for in Articles 62 and 63 of the Statute or by special agreement or application (Article 40 of the Statute). Each of those entitled to diplomatic protection would be able to exercise its right of protection according to its discretion without prejudicing the rights of protection of other States concerned. Such competitive existence of rights of diplomatic protection of diverse States appears an extraordinary phenomenon, but we consider that the same kind of legal phenomenon can be found in contractual or delictual matters where the same contract or wrongful act gives rise to a claim for compensation by diverse persons concerned. In such a case, concurrent plural claims may serve a common purpose; if one of them were exercised and satisfied, the remaining rights would be extinguished, having attained their purpose. Accordingly, in the present case, there does not exist any contradiction between, on the one hand, the right of diplomatic</page><page sequence="67">293 protection of the Barcelona Traction Company by its national State, namely Canada and, on the other hand, the right of diplomatic protection of its shareholders by their national State, namely Belgium. The existence of the former right does not exclude either the existence of the latter right or its exercise. Since the two rights of diplomatic protection - that of Canada and that of Belgium - co-exist in parallel but independently, it is not a necessity for Belgium's right of diplomatic protection that Canada should finally waive its right of protection in regard to the Barcelona Traction Company. Such a fact is not relevant to the existence of the right of diplomatic protection of Belgium in favour of its shareholders. We cannot deny the possibility of a cumulative existence of rights of diplomatic protection in the case of a company just as a natural person may have dual nationality. If a claim of one State is realized, the claim of the other State will be extinguished to this extent by losing its object. Accordingly, the defendant State cannot be compelled to pay the damage twice over. Of course, we recognize that the fear of complication which would be caused by plural or multiple interventions of several governments has some justification. But if we deny them, the legitimate interests of shareholders might be left without protection by their national States. These phenomena would represent some of the defects inherent in the present institution of diplomatic protection, which might be related to the non-acceptability of individuals to international tribunals. Practically, complication and confusion might be avoided to a considerable degree by negotiations and "solutions inspired by goodwill and common sense ..." (Reparation for Injuries Suffered in</page><page sequence="68">294 the Service of-the United Nations, Advisory Opinion^ I.C.JV Reports 19^9* p. l86) between the States concerned. Or it would be a task of international legislative policy to provide means to guarantee the protection of private investments and to find appropriate solutions in order to overcome the difficulties arising from the multiple intervention of several governments. We should not refuse the necessary remedies to protect legitimate shareholders by conjecturing extreme cases. It is true that there is no rule of international law which allows two kinds of diplomatic protection to a company and its shareholders respectively, but there is no rule of international law either which prohibits double protection. It seems that a lacuna of law exists here; it must be filled by an interpretation which emanates from the spirit of the institution of diplomatic protection itself. The Spanish Government admits the protection of shareholders by their national State (l) where, following the general tendency of international practice and doctrine, the company possesses the nationality of the State responsible foi the damage, and (2) where the foreign company has been dissolved or is practically defunct. In these cases there exists the circumstance that the protection of the shareholders by the national State of the company cannot be expected, either factually or legally. This is why in these cases the protection of shareholders directly by their national State is justified. The question is whether these two instances are to be considered as a manifestation of a more general principle in favour of the protection of shareholders or as an exception to the main principle which does not admit their protection.</page><page sequence="69">295 The principle of customary international law concerning diplomatic protection by the State of its nationals, however general and vague it may be, does not prohibit the rights or the legal position of shareholders being included in "property, rights and interests" as an object of protection. This conclusion can be justified as a correct interpretation of customary international law concerning diplomatic protection, particularly taking into account the above-mentioned necessity of international investment in the past as well as in the future. The nature of the interest of shareholders is to be inter preted as a legitimate one worthy of protection by their national State. Next, customary international law does not prohibit protection of shareholders by their national State even when the national State of the company possesses the right of protection in respect of the latter. The Spanish Government denies the right of protection of shareholders by their national State. It admits diplomatic protection of shareholders only in the two above-mentioned exceptional cases* Protection of shareholders from this viewpoint is considered only as a substitute for the protection of the company itself which has become impracticable through the circumstances indicated above. From our viewpoint, the protection of the shareholders possesses a meaning independently of the protection of the company itself. Accordingly, it can exist regardless of circumstances which might make the exercise of the right of protection of a company and the intervention of its national government impossible or difficult. There does not appear to exist in international law any restriction to the effect that the protection of shareholders in a foreign company by their national State must be limited to the above-mentioned two cases. The national State</page><page sequence="70">296 of shareholders, in the present case Belgium, is entitled to protect them just as in the cases where a company possesses the nationality of the responsible State, or a company has been dissolved or is practically defunct. In short, the contention of the Spanish Government is based on the municipal law concept of corporate personality and that of shareholders which is its corollary. The two protections, we consider, - protection of the company and that of the shareholders - may co-exist and on equal terms; the latter is not supplementary to the former. For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Belgium has an independent right to protect the Belgian shareholders in Barcelona Traction in conformity with the interpretation of customary international law concerning the diplomatic protection of nationals. II [omitted] III The aim of the rule of exhaustion of local remedies is a practical one and its application should therefore be elastic. Each situation, being different, requires different treatment. We must beware of the danger to which this rule is exposed because of its procedural and technical nature, lest it make necessary diplomatic protection futile by an excessive raising of the objection of non-exhaustion. Moreover, the fact that in this case, which was pending for more than fourteen years, from 12 February 1948 (date of the bankruptcy judgment against the Barcelona Traction Company by the Reus judge) to 14 June I962 (date of the Application by the Belgian Government), 2,736</page><page sequence="71">297 orders and 494 'judgments by lower courts and 37 by higher courts had been delivered, according to- the Spanish Government. Even if these figures are not correct in every detail, we can none the less recognize from them as a whole the fact that the condition of exhaustion of local remedies was indeed satisfied by the Barcelona Traction Company or its subsidiary companies. Accordingly, the argument contrary thereto by the Spanish Government is unfounded. Therefore, the fourth preliminary objection raised by the Spanish Government must be rejected. The third and fourth preliminary objections having been decided in favour of Belgium, we must now consider a basic question on the merits, namely, whether Spain is responsible for internationally wrongful acts allegedly committed by Spain which constitute t!a denial of justice". First it must be made clear that the charge of a denial of justice imputed to Spain by the Belgian Government does not denote a very narrow interpretation, namely the denial to foreigners of access to the courts. What the Belgian Government contends is not only not limited to a denial in such a formal sense, but it includes a denial of justice in a wider material sense, in which, generally speaking, gross injustice, irregularities, partiality, flagrant abuse of Judicial powers, unwarranted delay, etc., are included, as we indicated in another context. The judgment of the Reus judge of 12 February 1948 declaring the bankruptcy of Barcelona Traction, its consequences and the successive acts of the Spanish courts constitute the main complaints of the Belgian Government. But the complaints include acts not only of a judicial nature but also of an administrative nature, since it is alleged that some acts and omissions of the Spanish administrative</page><page sequence="72">298 authorities, particularly of the Institute of Foreign Exchange, had caused the adjudication in bankruptcy of the Barcelona Traction Company. From the lengthy arguments in the written and oral proceedings, we can guess the existence of antagonism between the two economic and financial groups: the one, the Mr. Juan March group and the other, the Barcelona Traction group. While the Belgian Government emphasizes the financial and political ambition and the collusion with the Spanish administrative and juridical authorities' of the former group, the Spanish Government contends that there was abuse of the pyramidal structure of the latter group and stresses the tax evasion and financial irregularities committed by that group, such as the creation of fictitious debts and the., sacrifice of creditors by means of auto-contracts between Barcelona Traction and its subsidiaries. The Spanish Government contends that the Barcelona Traction Company had been constantly in a state of "latent bankruptcy" owing to its financial methods detrimental to creditors and bondholders; the Belgian Government on the contrary insists that the financial situation of Barcelona Traction had been normal or even prosperous except in the period of the Spanish civil war and the second world war. The Belgian Government also contends that individual judicial and administrative measures which constitute separate subjects of complaint, were combined into an integral whole to bring about the "hispanicization" of a prosperous foreign enterprise. According to the Belgian Government, the adjudication in bankruptcy of Barcelona Traction is nothing other than the result of the machinations of Juan March in collusion with Spanish judicial and administrative authorities. This is the reason why the Belgian Government, alongside of individual complaints,</page><page sequence="73">299 advanced an overall complaint which unites and integrates numerous separate complaints. A judgment of a municipal court which gives rise to the responsibility of a State by a denial of justice does have an international character when, for instance, a court, having occasion to apply some rule of international law, gives an incorrect interpretation of that law or applies a rule of domestic law which is itself contrary to international law (Brierly-Waldock, op. cit., p. 287). Apart from such exceptionally serious cases, erroneous and unjust decisions of a court, in general, must be excluded from the concept of a denial of justice. Now, excluding allegedly erroneous or unjust decisions of the Spanish judiciary as constituent elements of a denial of justice, it remains to examine whether behirid the alleged errors and irregularities of the Spanish judiciary some grave circumstances do not exist which may justify the charge of a denial of justice. Conspicuous examples thereof would be "corruption, threats, unwarrantable delay, flagrant abuse of judicial procedure, a judgment dictated by the executive, or so manifestly unjust that no court which was both competent and honest could have given it", which were quoted above. We may sum up these circumstances under the single head of "bad faith". Although the Belgian Government insists on the existence of bad faith on the part of the Spanish judiciary and puts forward some evidence concerning the personal relationship of Mr. Juan March and his group with some governmental personalities, the use of henchmen in instituting and promoting bankruptcy proceedings, etc., we remain unconvinced of the existence of bad faith on the part of Spanish administrative and</page><page sequence="74">300 judicial authorities. What the Belgian Government alleges for the purpose of evidencing the bad faith of the Spanish judges concerned does not go very much beyond surrounding circumstances; it does not rely on objective facts constituting collusion, corruption, flagrant abuse of judicial procedure by the Spanish judiciary, etc. It is an extremely serious matter to make a charge of a denial of justice vis-?-vis a State, It involves not only the imputation of a lower international standard to the judiciary of the State concerned but a moral condemnation of that judiciary. As a result, the allegation of a denial of justice is considered to be a grave charge which States are not inclined to make if some other formulation is possible. In short, for the reasons indicated above, the Belgian allegation that Spain violated an international obligation and incurred responsibility vis-?-vis Belgium is without foundation. Therefore, the Belgian Government's claims must be dismissed. (Signed) Kotaro TANAKA</page><page sequence="75">SEPARATE OPINION OF JUDGE JESSUP 301 1. I agree with the majority of the Court that the Belgian claim must be dismissed, but since I reach that conclusion by different lines of reasoning, I feel it is incumbent on me to explain what my reasons are. 16. In connection with the instant case, the question arises from the argument that there can be no international right to damages for shareholders indirectly injured by damage to the company in which they hold shares, since no such right is generally established in municipal law. Much reliance is placed upon the proposition that under most systems of munie ipal law, shareholders have no rights in or to the assets of the corporation until after it is dissolved or wound up. Shareholders' suits are indeed provided by law in the United States and somwhat less extensively in Great Britain. In the United States "The derivative stockholder-plaintiff is not only a nominal plaintiff, but at the same time a real party in interest. He sues not solely upon a corporate cause of action but also upon his own cause of action." See Koessler, "The Stockholder's Suit: A Comparative View", 46 Columbia Law Review 1946, pp. 2^8 and 242. The provisions for shareholder suits in the European countries seem to be somewhat less favourable to the shareholder. But the trend in France is toward more protection of shareholders, as Judge Gros points out in paragraph 11 of hie separate opinion. 17. Although the concept of corporate personality is a creature of municipal law, none of the theories evolved in that frame of</page><page sequence="76">302 reference can be relied on universally to explain the legal relations surrounding that "technical legal device". "Gierke's theory was based upon Germanic village communities, m?di?val guilds and similar truly corporate entities. But such a theory hardly fits the modern holding company ... The result is that those who administer the law, whether as judges, revenue authorities, or as administrators, in civilian and common law systems alike jaxi? I would add in the international law system/ have had to discard all known theories of corporate personality, and to relativise the conception.x&gt;f juristio personality, respecting it for some purposes/^/ disregarding it for others, in accordance with the nature of the problem before them." (Priedmann, Legal Theory, 5th ed. 1967/ PP. 522-523? See also p. 571.) Thus, for example, where a corporation carries oh a purely commercial activity, international law does not "pierce the veil'1 to grant it the sovereign immunity attaching to the State by which it is wholly owned and managed; see Harvard Research in International Law, Report on Competence of Courts in Regard to Foreign States, 1932, Art. 12, p. 641. I would paraphrase and adapt a dictum from a recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in an anti-trust case: the International Court of Justice in the instant case is "not bound by formal conceptions of" corporation law. "We must look at the economic reality of the relevant transactions" and identify "the overwhelmingly dominant feature"1. The overwhelmingly dominant feature in the affairs of Barcelona Traction was not the fact of incorporation in Canada, but the controlling influence of far-flung international financial interests manifested in the Sofina grouping. 1 Mr. Justice Marshall delivering the opinion of the Court in United States v.

The Right to Extend Diplomatic Protection to Corporate Enterprises 8? The decision of the Court, in this case, is based on the legal conclusion that only Canada had a right to present a diplomatic claim on behalf of Barcelona Traction which was a company of Canadian nationality. My own conclusion is tnat, for reasons which I shall explain, Canada did not have, in this case, a right to claim on behalf of Barcelona Traction. As a matter of general international law, it is also my conclusion that a State, under certain circumstances, has a right to present a diplomatic claim on behalf of shareholders who are its nationals. As a matter of proof of fact, I find that Belgium did not succeed in proving the Belgian nationality, between 2 See Friedmann et al., International Financial Aid 1966; Kirdar, The Structure of United Nations Economic Aid to Underdeveloped Countries, 1966" See Friedmarin, The Changing Structure of International Law 1964, Chap. 14; Hyde, Economic Development Agreements , IO5 Hague Recueil 1962, I, p. 271. 4 Blough, "The Furtherance of Economic Development", International Organization, 1965, Vol. XIX, p. 562, and especially, Dirk Strikker's report to UNCTAD on "The Role of private enterprise in investment and promotion of exports in developing countries", (1968), UN Doc.

If a State extends its diplomatic protection to a corporation to which it has granted a wcharter'of convenience" while at the same time similar diplomatic assistance is being extended by another State whose nationals hold 100 per cent, of the shares, the situation might be considered analogous to cases of dual nationality of natural persons1. In those cases, international jurisprudence supports the principle that preference should be given to-the "real and effective nationality", as was held by this Court in the Nottebohm, Second Phase, Judgment (i.C.J. Reports 1955, PP. 4, 22), which will be discussed later in this Opinion. If Canada could be considered the State of the "real and effective nationality" of Barcelona Traction and if Canada assumed and maintained the role of Barcelona Traction's diplomatic protector, such facts would militate against the Belgian posture that Belgium was the State entitled to press the claim. In the instant case, Spain was at one time confronted by diplomatic representations of Great Britain, Canada, the United States and Belgium. But at that stage of multiple diplomatic activity, specific claims for damages were not being advanced; Spain was being 1 The analogy may be drawn even though the nationality of shareholders is not the test of the nationality of a corporation for purposes 6f international law.</page><page sequence="79">305 asked to take steps to halt what were considered to be destructive actions against Barcelona Traction, Spain's replies in the early stages rested on the proposition that the Government could not interfere with the normal functioning of the Spanish courts. 33. The first Belgian Note concerning the Barcelona Traction case is dated 27 March 1948 (A.M., Vol. IV, Annex 250). The Note stresses the importance of Belgian interests in Barcelona Traction by asserting that Sidro owns more than 70 per cent, of the shares of Barcelona Traction and other Belgian individuals own enough to bring the total to 80 per cent. In addition, the Belgian State had 50,000 shares of Sidro received as a capital tax,- and 40 to 45 per cent, of the First Mortgage Bonds of Barcelona Traction were also held by Belgians. Like the British Government, the Belgian Government notes that some of the higher ranks of the personnel of the companies have been discharged, especially Mr. William Menschaert, a Belgian national, President and sole legal representative of Ebro in Spain. The proceedings in Spain are summarized and declared improper or illegal. The note concludes with the statement that there has been a series of denials of justice which cannot help but gravely injure legitimate Belgian interests in the companies involved. The Spanish reply as usual indicated that the Government could not interfere with the courts. 37. .the conclusion emerges that although in 1948 the Canadian Government, like the other three governments involved, was-disturbed by the judicial proceedings which overtook Barcelona Traction in Spain, the chief Canadian interest was</page><page sequence="80">306 in the securities of which National Trust was trustee and that when the bonds were paid off after tne assets were sold in Spain, Canadian interest declined. Canada apparently had no deep abiding interest either in Canadian shareholdings in Barcelona Traction, for they wtre not large, or in the company itself which (at least after the payment of the bonds) was linked to Canada only by the "charter of convenience" and the receivership proceedings1. The latter were not of a nature to stimulate Canadian diplomatic action, although, under the super vision of the Ontario oourt, the Receiver and Manager took an active part in trying to promote a settlement through negotiations of the private interests involved. (See Receivership Documents, Vol 5, 774.) I do not find it credible that Canada can be considered to be competing with Belgium in diplomatic protection of the interests clustered around Barcelona Traction. The interests of the united States and Great Britain wore those of governments of States which contain great financial capitals - New York and London. Neither of them pressed claims on behalf of specific persons whether natural or juristic. Both governments have a general interest in the welfare of international "banking and investment circles" which are closely linked with their national economies. ^ Belgian counsel's argument on 30 June I969 about the "violation of Canadian sovereignty" and interference with the functions of the receiver as a Canadian "public authority" does not s.eem to reflect the actual thinking of the Canadian Government.</page><page sequence="81">307 Belgium remains the only identifiable claimant against Spain in connection with the bankruptcy of the Barcelona Traction Company. If, undor international law., a State is not entitled to extend its diplomatic protection to large shareholder interests of its nationals in circumstances such as those in the instant case, none of the equity interests in the Barcelona Traction enterprise would be entitled to diplomatic protection. I do not believe international law requires that such a conclusion be reached. 38. There is no question that, under international law, a State has in general a right to extend its diplomatic protection to a corporation which has its nationality, or national character as it is more properly called. The proposition raises two questions: 1. What are the tests to determine the national character of a corporation? 2. Assuming the appropriate tests are met, must that national character be "real and effective" as shown by the "link" between the corporation and the State, just as, in the Nottebohm case, this Court decided that a certain claim to nationality is not enough in all situations to justify a State in extending its diplomatic protection to a natural person? 39. There ar? two standard tests of the "nationality" of a corporation. The place of incorporation is the test generally favoured in the legal systems of the common law, while the si?ge social is more generally accepted in the civil law systems. ^See Kronstein, "The Nationality of International Enterprises", 52 Columbia Law Review, 1952,</page><page sequence="82">308 p. 983?) There is respectable authority for requiring that both tests be met"**. 1 There is ample coverage of the literature in the excellent study by Ginther, op. cit., infra. It is not possible to speak of a single rule for all purposes. The tests used in private international law have their own character, as well brought out by Caflisch, "La Nationalit?' des soci?t?s commerciales en droit international priv?", Annuaire suisse de droit international, Vol. XXIV, page 119 (1967). Commercial treaties and claims conventions often contain their own definitions of which companies shall be considered to have the nationality of a State for purposes of the treaty. (Cf. Walker, "Provisions on Companies in United States Commercial Treaties", 50 American Journal of International Law, 1956, p. 373; Wilson, United States Commercial Treaties and International Law, I960; and, for a more comprehensive survey, Ginther, "Nationality of Corporations" Osterr. Zeitschrift F?r ?ffentliches Recht, Vol. XVI, 1966, p. 28 at pp. 31-59? The tests used for such purposes may &gt;be quite different - even in the practice of the same State - from the tests used for other purposes. For example, the "control" test was widely used to determine the enemy character of property during war, but it is not established in international law as a general test of the nationality of a corporation*''. On the other hand, control may constitute the See the observations of the Permanent Court of International Justice on the control test in Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia (Series A, No, 7,at p. 70).</page><page sequence="83">309 essential link which, when joined to nationality, gives the State the right to extend diplomatic protection to the corporation. It is a familiar fact that the laws of certain States provide favourable conditions for companies incorporating therein, especially in relation to taxation. Canada is one such State, Liechtenstein is another. In the United States, many companies find it advantageous, for various reasons, to incorporate in Delaware or New Jersey2. Charters secured for such reasons may be called "charters of convenience11. Cf# Cahill, "Jurisdiction over Foreign Corporations and Individuals who Carry on Business within the Territory", 30 Harvard Law Review, 1917, p. 676. 4 # The Judgment of the Court in Nottebohm, Second Phase, in 1955 (.I?C#J? Reports 1955, p.4), has been widely discussed in the subsequent literature of international, law, particularly with reference to the so-called "link theory" by which the effectiveness of nationality may be tested"*". It has been argued that the doctrine is equally applicable in the case of ships flying "flags of convenience" and in relation to the diplomatic protection of corporations. I have maintained the view that it should apply in both those situations # [2] 1 The wide range of unfavourable comments is reflected in the text and citations in Grossen, "Nationalit? et Protection Diplomatique", lus et Lex, Pestgabe zum 70 Geburtstag von Max Gutzwiller, 1959? p. 489? Brownlie, Principles of Public International Law, 1966, has a full treatment at pp. 323 ff. His position is generally favourable to the Court1s judgment. ?Jessup, "The United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea", 59 Columbia Law Review, 1959, pp. 2^4, 256. Meyers, The Nationality of Ships, 1967* fullycovers the question of flags of convenience, and the applicability of the rule to corporations is treated in Harris, "The Protection of Companies in International Law in the Light of the Nottebohm Case", l8 International &amp; Comparative Law Quarterly, April 196% . 275?</page><page sequence="84">310 41. In the instant case the Parties did not debate the applicability of the link principle to the Barcelona Traction Company, but they were certainly aware of the question. The Spanish side stated: ,!... the Spanish Government never disputed the effective character of Barcelona Traction1s Canadian nationality, because a number of factors were present which were sufficient proof of the existence of a real link between the company and the economic life of Canada". (P.O., 1963, p. 190.) Counsel for Belgium argued on 4 July 1969 that "if the Canadian Government had been able to espouse in international judicial proceedings the cause of Barcelona Traction, its action could have been challenged on the ground of the lack of sufficient true Canadian interest". Counsel for Spain responded directly to this remark on 21 July. 42. .... . It is indeed true that since Spain admitted that Canada had a right to extend diplomatic protection to Barcelona, Traction, it may be argued that Spain is estopped to deny such a right although the elements of true estoppel may be lacking and such estoppel could be claimed (if at all) by Canada and not by Belgium. Aside from the fact that I believe the jurisprudence of the Court has tended to rely too heavily on estoppel or preclusion, the question posed here is in the first place a question of the Court's finding a rule of law. The Court in its Judgment does not accept the application of the link theory to juristic persons. Since I have reached the conclusion that the existence of a link between a corporation holding a "charter of convenience" and the State granting the charter, is the key to the diplomatic protection of multinational corporate interests, I cannot avoid the problems of law and fact on any such basis as the application of the doctrine of estoppel in this particular case.</page><page sequence="85">311 43? .... . The "Link" Concept, It seems to be widely thought that the "link" concept in connection with the nationality of claims, originated in the International Court of Justice's Judgment in Nottebohrru I do not agree that in that instance the Court created a new rule of law. Indeed the underlying principle was already well-established in connection with diplomatic claims on behalf of corporations. To look for the link between a corporation and a State is merely another example of what is now the familiar practice of "lifting the veil". The practice of such States as the United States and Switzerland had already given weight to the proposition that a corporation would not be protected solely because it was incorporated in the State, i.e., had the State's nationality; some other link was required and that link usually was related to the ownership of shares. Such abstention, being as it were "against interest", has special probative value . 46. . . . As a matter of principle and logic - supported by State practice - a comparable rule is applicable to corporations. A State may, by extending diplomatic protection to a corporation, hold out that corporation as having its "nationality", because the State had granted it its charter of incorporation. But if in fact there is no "genuine link" between the corporation and the State in question, the State to which diplomatic representations are made may, on that ground reject them. ..... On the other hand, the corporation which has a nominal connection with a State of incorporation but whose shares are all owned by nationals of another State in which latter State the actual</page><page sequence="86">management and control of the company are carried on, has behind it the shareholders who represent the real interest. No rule of law, no principle, forbids that latter State to extend its diplomatic protection to those interests. 49. Throughout, one finds that the important decisions, the vital planning, was done by such persons as Heineman, Wilmers, Speciali, Hubbard and Lawton, whose instructions issued from Great Britain, the United States and Belgium and Spain itself, but rarely if ever from Canada. The general meetings of shareholders held in Toronto seem to have been pro forma affairs. It is true that in 19^8 a "Receiver and Manager" of Barcelona Traction was appointed in Canada and operated out of Toronto, but since the operating companies in Spain had passed into the control of the bankruptcy officials there, the Receiver and Manager could merely try to encourage a settlement; he did not have the power to make a settlement. Counsel for Belgium, in the same pleading in which he rebutted some of the Spanish contentions about the San Antonio Land Co. case, quoted from a judgment of Mr* Justice Roxburgh in the English High Court of Justice, the following passage which strongly confirms the fact that Barcelona Traction*s management was not centred in Toronto: "Barcelona was a holding and not an operating Company. Sterling was its life blood. It also borrowed pesetas but it had little interest in Canadian dollars. London was its financial seat. ... There were in Canada, so far as I know, or rather so far as I have been told, nothing but a registered office of undisclosed size with a staff of undisclosed dimensions, and share registers." Counsel noted that on the final point the judge had not had discovery, but counsel did not deny the truth of the judge1s comment</page><page sequence="87">313 50. There are three situations in which there is wide agreement that a State may extend its diplomatic protection to shareholders who are its nationals, although the company whose shares they hold has the nationality of another State. These three situations are sometimes considered "exceptions" to a general rule allowing protection of the corporation itself. 51? The first of these situations is where the corporation has been incorporated in the State which inflicts the injury on it without legal justification, and where the shareholders are of another nationality. It is in such situations that one finds the widest agreement that a State may extend diplomatic protection to shareholders who are its nationals-*-. The rationale seems to be based largely on equitable considerations and the result is so reasonable it has been accepted in State practice. Judge Charles De Visscher says this result is required by "des consid?rations imp?rieuses de justice". ("De la protection diplomatique des actionnaires d'une soci?t? contre lfEtat sous la l?gislation duquel cette soci?t? sfest constitu?e", 6l Revue de droit international et de l?gislation compar?e, 1934, p. 624. By hypothesis* the respondent State has committed an unlawful act from which injury results. The corporation itself cannot seek redress and therefore the State whose nationals own the shares may protect them ut singuli. The equities are particularly striking when the respondent State admits foreign investment only on condition that the investors form a corpor ation under its law. These points are clearly made by Petr?n, 109 Hague Recueil, I963, II, pp. 5&lt;&gt;6 and 510. Petr?n refers with [Footnote omitted.]</page><page sequence="88">314 approval to the earlier lectures by Paul De Visscher, 102 Hague Recueil, 1961, I, p. 399; see especially pp. 478-479. Judge Wellington Koo, in his separate opinion in this Barcelona case in 1964 asserted emphatically: "... the original simple rule of protection of a company by its national State has been found inadequate and State practice, treaty regulation and international arbitral decisions have come to recognize the right of a State to intervene on behalf of its nationals, shareholders of a company which has been injured by the State of its own nationality, that is to say, a State where it has been incorporated according to its laws and therefore is regarded as having assumed its nationality". (i.C.J. Reports 1964, p. 58) Judge Wellington Koo considered it immaterial whether this rule should or should not be considered as an "exception", 53? The second situation in which it is widely agreed that a State may claim on behalf of its shareholders in a foreign eorooration, is where the State of incorporation has liquidated or wound up the corporation after the injury was inflicted by some third State. 56. I also find it unnecessary to consider in detail what is con sidered the third "exception" where shareholders may admittedly be protected, namely where the injury is inflicted directly on the share holders and not indirectly through damage to the company, 57? It is now possible to turn to the question which is crucial for the instant case, namely, whether the three situations just mentioned are the only ones in which international law permits a State to extend diplomatic protection to shareholders who are its nationals. I find no evidence or reasoning which precludes such protection in other situations, but the question can be answered only by analysing the fundamental principles underlying the right of diplomatic protection.</page><page sequence="89">315 The Basic Principle of State "Interest" 58. In this opinion traditional language has been used, for example in speaking of injuries to a corporation as such, but this is really a bit of anthropomorphism since, as Sir Edward Coke remarked, corporations "have no souls" (case of Suttonfs Hospital, 10 Rep. 32) and as stated by more recent jurists, the corporation "is not a thing. It is a method." (Douglas and Shanks, "Insulation from Liability through Subsidiary Corporations", 39 Yale Law Journalt 1929? ? 193? 194?) 1 That corporations have a nationality, is a legal fiction . In legal principle and practice, the situation is that in relations with other States, a State is entitled to treat a corporation as if it were one of its nationals, provided the corporation is connected with it by certain links. "Indeed, it is at least arguable that all cases of apparent protection of corporations are in reality cases of protection of the shareholding interest of nationals of the protecting State." (Clive Parry, "Some Considerations upon the Protection of Individuals in International Law", 90 Hague Recueil, 1956, II, p. 657 at-p.'7 4.) 6l. The primacy of the general economic interests of the State in protecting private investments abroad, and the minimizing of any one essential test justifying diplomatic protection, are strikingly brought out in the message of the Swiss Conseil f?d?ral of 29 October 1948 to the Assembl?e f?d?rale, concerning the negotiation of agreements with Yugoslavia on trade, payments, and a global settlement of Swiss claims for nationalized property: 1 "Legal fiction", according to Morris Cohen, "is the mask that progress must wear to pass the faithful but blear-eyed watchers of our ancient legal treasures. But though legal fictions are useful in thus mitigating or absorbing the shock of innovation, they work havoc in the form of intellectual confusion". Quoted in Transnational Law, p. 70.</page><page sequence="90">316 "Article 5 indicates what must be considered as Swiss assets, holdings or claims. This question presents no difficulty when the assets belong to natural persons; in that case the nationality of the owner or creditor serves as the criterion. So far as corporate persons and companies are concerned, the seat, which must be in Switzerland, has not been made the only test, but the. question is also raised as to whether there is a substantial Swiss interest in the corporate person or company. In most cases the substantial Swiss. interest will be shown to ??cist when the effective majority of the capital is in Swiss hands. If there is no such majority, it is the minority exerting a decisive influence on the company which is to be taken into account; this is particularly easy to discern when there is a compact minority on one side and a scattered majority on the other. The compos it loa of the board of directors and senior manage ment may also be a determining factor^when it belongs to them to shape the will of the corporate person and decide on its behalf. Lastly, in certain cases the creditors ought not to be overlooked either, for they too may exert a certain influence on the undertaking. But it is always necessary to consider the real circumstances and not trust iri purely legal constructions, whose sole aim may be to dissimulate the true facts." Feuille F?d?rale de la Conf?d?ration Suisse, 100e Ann?e 1948, Vol. Ill, p. 672 at 686. /ITranslation from French by the Registry JT ~ 62. In Its note of 20 April 1938 to the Mexican Government, in regard to the case of Mexican Eagle Oil Company, a Mexican corporation, the British Government said; "But the fact remains that the majority of shareholders who are the ultimate sufferers from the action of the Mexican Government are British, and the undertaking in question is essentially a British interest. For this reason alone His Majestyfs Government have the right ... to protest against an action which they regard as unjustified". (8 Whiteman Digest of International Law? p. 1273.) In a section of the British Digest of International Law, entitled "Protection of British Interests in Foreign-Incorporated Companies", one finds a number of passages in which the stress is on the British "interests" rather than on the nationality of the company. (See Vol. 5, Part VI, pp. 535 ff.)</page><page sequence="91">317 6j5. In regard to the practice of the United States, it has already been noted that that Government maintains that it is entitled under international law to protect substantial American shareholder-interests in foreign corporations and that it declines to protect American companies in which the substantial Interest is alien-owned. Thus, in 1912, the Department of State declined to make representations on behalf of an American company in which Americans owned only $100 worth of shares out of a total of ?450,000. (V. Hackworth, Digest of Inter national Law, p. 845.) In 1965, the same Department informed an American embassy: "... the Government of the United States has the right mder principles of international law to intervene or espouse a claim on behalf of nationals of the United States who own a substantial interest in a corporation organized under the laws of ... /a foreign country/1'. (8 Whiteman Digest, p. 1272.) The Restatement of Foreign Relations Law of the American Law Institute (1965) in Section 175 provides that a State is liable for damage to alien stockholder interests in a corporation of a third State if f,a significant portion of the stock" is alien-owned, the corporation fails to obtain reparation, for reasons which the share holders can not control, and the corporation has not waived or settled its claim. "in international law, as in the domestic law of the United States, there has been a gradually increasing tendency to disre gard the separate corporate entity when necessary to avoid injustice. Originally the United States, like Great Britain, refused to intervene on behalf of its national shareholders in a foreign corporation ... Since late in the 19th century, a number of such claims have been presented to and allowed by international tribunals. In most of these, the international responsibility of the State with respect to the injury to the alien shareholder as such was not squarely presented as a question of international law,</page><page sequence="92">318 since this point was settled by the terms of the international agreement establishing the tribunal or by the compromis under which the case was submitted to it .. .j/^citing Delagoa Bay J However, the practice of providing for such cases in international arbitration agreements has apparently come to be regarded as a reflection of customary international law, and it now seems to be recognized that, at least under some circumstances, the State is responsible for the injury to alien shareholders owning a significant interest in the injured corporation." (Reporter's Notes to S . 173 cf. II, Hyde, p. 904.) The Question of Double or Multiple Protection 66. Counsel for the Respondent made numerous statements to the effect that diplomatic protection could never be extended by more than one State in any one case. Such an argument is advanced against the possibility that more than one large shareholding interest might be protected, it being alleged that if the State of which the company has the nationality is the only State entitled to extend diplomatic protection, impermissible double protection would be avoided. That position is not correct since there are various situations in which international law recognizes the right of more than one State to. interpose in connection with the same allegedly wrongful act. 67. In an ordinary case of dual nationality, both of those States of which claimant is a national may extend protection although in case of conflict an international tribunal may apply the doctrine of effective nationality. This Court said in the Reparation for Injuries Suffered in the Service of the United Nations case: "International Tribunals are already familiar with the problem of a claim in which two or more national States are interested, and they know how to protect the defendant State in such a case." (I.C.J. Reports 1949, pp. 174 and I85.)</page><page sequence="93">319 68? The situation is not so simple when one considers the condition of artificial or juristic persons. International law has not developed a clear rule of dual nationality for such entities although different criteria are employed for determining nationality. Respondent indi cated that a company may have dual nationality because both criteria are acceptable (Preliminary Objections, 19$5. ? 191)* but it insisted only one of the two States may make a claim. Yet in cases which are now very common in the commercial life of the world, the corporation may have various links with more than one State - links just as real as those which may connect a natural person with two different States whose nationality he possesses. International law cannot be oblivious to these corporate links. As already indicated above, they include the place of incorporation, the place of management, the place of operation (probably including employment of labour and payment of taxes), the nationality of the persons (natural or artificial) who exercise control, whether through the board of directors and management, or through stock interests, which not Infrequently may exercise control even when a relatively small minority. 69? I shall not go over all the cases but merely note the double or joint diplomatic interposition in Delagoa, Mexican Eagle and Tlahualilo. (Cf. Paul De Visscher, 102 Hague Recueil, 1^61, I, pp#477-478.) In the case of Barcelona Traction, diplomatic representations, some perhaps only in the nature of good offices, were made by Canada, the United Kingdom, United States of America and Belgium. ?l the case of two different but simultaneous justifiable diplomatic interpositions regarding the same alleged wrongful act, the Respondent can eliminate one claimant by showing that a full settle ment had been reached with the other. If, in this case, Spain made</page><page sequence="94">320 a settlement with Canada for Barcelona Traction, the Belgian claim for the shareholders might be considered moot. 70. With all respect to the Court, I must point out the irrational results of applying a rule which would provide that only the State in which a company is incorporated majr extend diplomatic protection in case of damage inflicted under circumstances in which the State inflicting the damage incurs liability "under international law, as illustrated by the organization of the Iranian *il Consortium. In September 195*4 an agreement was concluded between eight oil companies on the one side and, on the other side, the Government of Iran and the Government-owned National Iranian Oil Company; it was ratified by the Iranian Parliament. The agreement gives to the Consortium the exclusive rights in a defined area for the production, refining and processing of crude oil and natural gas, together with other facilities. The eight participating oil companies include the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, now British Petroleum Company, which participates to the extent of 40 per cent; five American oil companies also having 40 per cent.; the one Dutch company having 14 per cent, and the French company having 6 per cent. To carry out the operations, the Consortium caused to be incorporated in the Netherlands, two Dutch companies, one a Producing company and the other a Refining company. All the shares of the Dutch Producing company and of the Refining company are owned by an English holding company, Iranian ?11 Participants Limited, with offices In London. The shares of the "Holding Company" are owned by the members of the Consortium in the percentages indicated</page><page sequence="95">321 1 above . The two operating companies were incorporated in the Netherlands Actually, in 1955 nine independent American companies were admitted to participate and each of the original American participating companies surrendered 1 per cent, of their shareholdings to the new group. For the purposes of this illustrative example, it is not necessary to explain further the. position of another British company, Iranian Oil Services Ltd. This account of the organization of the companies is based upon "History and Constitution of Iranian #il Participants and Iranian til Services", a talk by Mr. J. Addison, General Manager of Iranian Oil Participants Ltd. to 3taff Information Meeting* Teheran, 21 August 1961. because of the liberal provisions of its commercial code which permit the companies to have their head offices and board of directors and management overseas, in this case, in Iran. The code also permits "one-man" companies, which makes it possible for all their shares to be held by the "Holding Company" in London. Fortunately, the Iranian Oil Consortium agreement was so skilfully drawn in a co-operative spirit, that one does not anticipate the likelihood of any diplomatic claims, quite aside from the fact that the agreement includes notable 1 arrangements for arbitration of any disputes . But should there be any question in the future of representations by any government, it would be absurd to maintain that the Netherlands Government would be the sole government entitled to make such representations. Nor would it seem rational to assign an exclusive role to the British Government on the ground that the Holding Company was incorporated in Great Britain and has its office in London. Perhaps a stronger link between the enterprise and Great Britain would be the extent of British Government participation in holding shares in British Petroleum. 1 M See "The Oil Agreement Between Iran and the International Oil Consortium: The Law Controlling'1, by Abolbashar Farmanfarma, of the Teheran Bar, in 34 Texas Law Review 259, 1955.</page><page sequence="96">71. The Court could logically have begun its analysis of the case by examining the proof of the nationality of the physical or juristic persons whom Belgium asserts the right to protect. If it found that such nationality was not proved, the Belgian claim must be dismissed without regard to the rule concerning the diplomatic protection of shareholders in a corporation chartered in a third State. 72. The burden of proof was clearly on the Applicant to prove the Belgian nationality of the shareholders on whose behalf Belgium claims. The Belgian argument (7 May I969) that Spain was estopped or precluded from contesting the Belgian character of Sidro and Sofina, is not persuasive. The Continuity Rule 75. The two dates on which the nationality had to be proved, are determined by the rule of continuity. As the term implies, the rule requires that the nationality remain unchanged between those two dates. 74. Although the phraseology varies, there is general agreement on the principle that the claim must be national in origin, that is to say that the person or persons alleged to have been injured must have had the nationality of the claimant State on the date when the wrongful*injury was inflicted. 75. . throughout much of the written pleadings and oral argument it seems to have been taken for granted that the critical date, when the injury complained of was inflicted, was that of the Reus decree declaring Barcelona Traction</page><page sequence="97">323 bankrupt, namely, 12 February 19481. I think the Court is entitled to accept that date, at least to the extent of saying that if the claim was not Belgian on that date, the claim must be dismissed. In its final submissions on 15 July I969 under heading VI, Belgium asserted: "that the Belgian Government has established that 88 per cent of Barcelona Traction's capital was in Belgian'hands on the critical dates of 12 February 1948 and 14 June 1962 and so remained continuously between those dates ..." (Emphasis supplied.) The same assertion was amplified under heading V. 76. The terminal date under the continuity rule is more controversial. Historically, many international claims have been settled through the diplomatic channel and never were presented to an international tribunal. In many mixed claims commissions, claims were heard long after the events complained of because the commissions were established ad hoc after a certain number of claims had accumulated. Por a moderate example, the British-American Mixed Claims Commissions established under a treaty concluded in I9IO, decided in I920 a claim based on events which took place in I898. (VI, J.N.R.I.A.A., p. 42.) This diplomatic practice supported the view that the nationality of the claim had to be proved up to the time when it was espoused by the State. Thereafter, it was argued, the claim could be regarded as statai and, for the purposes of the continuity rule, the status of the individual on whose behalf the claim was made, became immaterial. 77. However, when a case is brought before a permanent tribunal such eus the International Court of Justice, the date of tue application takes the place of the first diplomatic representation1. Counsel 1 See Institut de droit international, Annuaire, I965, Vol. II, p. 270. -</page><page sequence="98">324 for Belgium on 4 July I969 made a persuasive argument in favour of choosing that as the date required by the continuity rule although I do not agree that the Court is driven to making new law no matter what terminal date it selects. Counsel for Spain on the other hand, insisted on 21 July I969 that the critical moment for the terminal date should be when the terms of the dispute were clearly defined which could only be after the respondent State had indicated its position. I find slight precedent for this view and see no logic in it1. I therefore con clude that the terminal date for compliance with the continuity rule is 19 June 1962, the date of the "new" Application. Piercing the Veil of Sidro and Sofina 80. If, as I maintain, Canada was not legally competent to protect Barcelona Traction because of the absence of a link (such 1 absence being in part proved by the extent of foreign shareholding) , then Belgium by the same token would not be legally competent to protect Sidro unless the presence of a link is established. This is the challenge which Belgium seems to have accepted. Apparently Belgium was willing to have the link tested entirely by the extent of shareholdings and not by other factors. This may be due to inability to prove that the international controlling group was associated with or operated out of Belgium. Here again there is an illustration of the fact that the rule which permits claims to be submitted on behalf of shareholders places a heavy burden of proof on the claimant State, especially in the case of great international holding companies whose [Footnotes omitted.]</page><page sequence="99">325 focus of power can not easily be proved especially over a period of years. There is added difficulty in time of war when many steps, some of them devious, but quite justifiable, need to be taken to avoid enemy appropriation or exploitation and also characterization as enemy by allied or friendly States. As Berle has abundantly demonstrated, the centre or focus of power is not necessarily to be identified by the location of the largest number of shares1. Counsel for Belgium recognized this fact in stating, on 13 May 1969, that Sofina was, at one period, controlled by about 8 per cent, of the shareholdings. The place of incorporation, whence the promoters of an enterprise secure a "charter of convenience", has lost its significance as evidence of the real identification of a holding company. Moreover, the si?ge social in terms of an office, etc., can be merely a fa?ade. 81. There is, to be sure, a certain logic in taking the position that if international law permits a State to protect a shareholder interest, the State should be able to protect a single shareholder and would not have to prove that a substantial percentage of the shares were held by its nationals. This seems to be the Swiss practice but not that of the United States and there is very little support in the doctrine for pushing logic to such extremes. Nor does the claimant State in the instant case rely on any such principle . 1 "... it is just possible that in talking the language of 'ownership' in relation to the flow of national capital, we are talking the language of history rather than the language of reality" (Berle, Power Without Property (Eng. ed. i960), p. 45). This is true because, as Judge Tanaka has pointed out, anonymity brings about the separation of management from the ownership. (Cf. Morphologie des Groupes Financiers, Centre de Recherche et d'Information Socio-Politiques, 1962, pp. 9 and 60 and Meyssan, Les Droits des actionnaires et des autres Porteurs de Titres dans les Soci?t?s anonymes, 1962, pp. 9-10.)</page><page sequence="100">326 87? The actual Belgian position seemed to fall back on that taken by counsel on 7 May I969 In the following statement: "After all, and this is a point of some importance, it is not necessary for the Government of Belgium tj satisfy the Court regarding the identity and Belgian nationality of every individual shareholder whose rights and interests underlie the Belgian claim. According to the doctrine recognized by this Court and generally accepted by States, Belgium is presenting a claim for injury done to the State of Belgium through wrongs inflicted upon its nationals. The Court, therefore, need do no more than estimate in proximate terms the number of Belgian shareholders in Barcelona Traction." Although he argued that the evidence is enough for the Court to find that as of 14 June 19$2 "at least 200,000 bearer shares in Barcelona Traction were owned by Belgians other than Sidro," it was actually left to the Court to make an approximate estimate. All of these presentations and others not noted here, do not suffice to discharge the burden of proof which rested on the Applicant. 88. One cannot deny that it is far from easy to trace the ownership of bearer shares. In the Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia case, the Polish Government argued that "no importance can be attached to the possession of bearer securities, since it is impossible to ascertain in whose hands they may be at a given moment". (P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 7, ? 67.) The Court did not find it necessary . I to pursue this point. In the instant case, Belgium said that Spain was seeking to drive them with their backs to the wall by demanding a pr#batio diabolica for identification of holders of bearer shares. But Belgium insisted that in this instance it was able to accomplish this almost impossible task (Memorial, 1959* P- 17; Reply, Part III,</page><page sequence="101">327 p. 156, and CR, for 13 May 1969? ) I am not convinced that it succeeded"1". Apparently 341,326 bearer shares were in the trust account with Securitas (to be discussed later herein), after being deposited 31 December 1939 (O.S., p. 203), Then 8,525 more bearer shares were deposited by Sidro with Securitas - 7,925 on 12 December 1939 and 6OO on 22 February 1940 - while 2,075 bearer shares were, for some reason, left in Brussels. (ibid., pp. 203-204?) When on 19 April 19^? Sidro asked Securitas to send to Newman &amp; Co- various securities, it included in the lot to be sent 6,025 bearer shares and the coupons of 341,326 bearer shares, but not the latter certificates themselves. (App. 2 to Annex 11 of the Annexes to the Memorial.) In January 1952, Sidro converted the 341,326 bearer shares then in its possession to registered shares; they were registered in the najne of Newman &amp; Co. (See ibid., Annexes 11 and 4.) I have not been able to establish that none of these 341,326 bearer shares changed hands between 12 February 1948 and January 1952. It is alleged that 244,832 additional bearer shares were owned by other Belgians in February 19^. (M., Sec. 10.) It was claimed that on 14 June 1962, 200,000 bearer shares were held by Belgians other than Sidro. (O.S., p. 206.) I find no proof that these bearer shares 1 The Belgian State in 1946 or 1947 possessed 10,000 shares of Sofina and 50,000 shares of Sidro. The shares were acquired in payment of a capital levy in 1946 but were apparently held by the State only briefly and probably not after 31 December 1947- See A.O.S., Ann. 30, App. 3, pp. 368 and 38I and Sub-App. 3? ? 388. It was in another context that Mr. Lauterpacht spoke, on 4 July 1969, of "the overall claim, here put forward by the Belgian Government, in respect of the injury done to the Belgian State by the unlawful acts for which Spain is responsible".</page><page sequence="102">328 were continuously Belgian-owned (assuming the above allegations to be correct) between 19^8 and 1962. 89. In reply to a question from the Bench concerning the possible effect on continuity if shares were transferred during the period 1948-1962j counsel for Belgium said, on 4 July 1969, that if shares were sold to other Belgians and then repurchased by Sidro, "the continuity requirement would be satisfied". But "if the shares had been sold to, and then repurchased from, non-Belgian nationals, other than Spanish nationals, the requirement might possibly not have been satisfied ..." When later he analysed his evidence of Belgian holdings in, 1948, he did not try to adduce proof that the shares did not change hands between 1948 and 1962. It was in this context, that he rejected the Spanish suggestion that Belgium should prove in regard to each shareholder that he was a Belgian and that he was a shareholder during the critical period. Counsel said: "it is a lengthy and expensive procedure to carry out the investigation proposed by the Government of Spain. It is justifiable if there is something to be distributed. /Sc. an award in this case^/7 It is not justifiable otherwise.11 He felt this was the more true because he c#nsidered that Belgium had proved that there was at all material times Belgian ownership of at least 200,000 shares aside from the Sidro holdings. None the less, the statement is a damaging admission of Belgium's inability to identify the shareholders it sought to protect. The exhaustive effort to trace the bearer shares, would hardly have been necessary if Belgium had been confident that the Court would be convinced that Sidro was the real owner of the-1,012,688 registered Barcelona shares throughout the liticai period since so large a holding would presumably satisfy the</page><page sequence="103">329 demand that Sidro be identified with Belgian interests. This may be another slight indication that Belgian counsel were aware that they were, for one reason or ancttaer, not in a j^sition to prove when the Securitas trust arrangement terminated. (See paragraph 96 below.) Securitas as trustee for Sidro 90. On 6 September 1939 Sidro concluded a "custodian" contract with Securitas Ltd, which was a United States corporation formed under the laws of Delaware. . It is said that this contract was concluded "foreseeing the danger of war". 91. .on the same date, 6 September 1939* Sidro made with Securitas a second contract which was a trust agreement. It was further revealed that this trust agreement of 6 September 1939 was replaced by another trust agreement on 27 February 19^0, but it is said that the differences between the two trust agreements are without relevance for this case? It is said that the second agreement merely took advantage of some new Belgian war legislation. The texts of the trust agreements have never been revealed throughout the pleadings. But the existence of the trust agreement of 27 February is recorded in Annex 3? page 36, to the Memorial, where it is described as completing the measures for protection during the war. It is said that this trust agreement was to enter into force when the Brussels area was occupied by the enemy or when any other critical situation developed threatening the normal operations of Sidro. It is further recited that the period of the application of the trust agreement was indicated by a "suspense period" which: would cease six months after the end of the critical period.</page><page sequence="104">Turning again to Annex 11 of the Observations and Submissions, at pages 207 and 208, it is stated that when one of the "Operative Events" occurred, Securitas automatically became a trustee of Sidrofs property outside Belgium and especially of 341,326 bearer shares of Barcelona Traction. The 1,012,688 registered shares were also already on deposit with Securitas and its possession was transformed into "legal ownership" when Securitas became trustee1. Securitas became the trustee in May, 1940 (ibid., p. 4). 1 [Footnote omitted.] 95? It is a vital matter to know when the trust ceased to exist. Professor Chayes, Belgium1s American expert, clearly points out why this is so; he says that during the German occupation of Belgium - "... Securitas acted as trustee of the property. As such, Securitas held legal title to the property and could manage the property in its own discretion, without regard to any instructions from Sidro. Indeed, the whole point of the arrangement was to free Securitas from the control of Sidro, since during the German occupation, instructions might come from Belgium with respect to the shares that were inimical to Sidro's true interests and to the allied cause. Securitas was of course, bound to use its discretion for the benefit of Sidro, the beneficiary under the trust instrument. The trustee would be liable if it abused its discretion or used its position to take advantage of Sidro. And it had to account to Sidro, ultimately, for dividends and other profits. But subject to these general limitations, as trustee during the war Securitas had full authority over the property" (A.R., Ann. 125, p. 8}1. Chayes concludes that the trust had been terminated by 12 February 1948, but in proof of this statement he merely cites 1 Securitas evidently was not a "passive described by Judge Augustus Hand in the case to which the Spanish side attached Vol. Ill, p. 114.) trustee" in the sense San Antonio Land and Irrigation Co. such importance. (New Documents,</page><page sequence="105">331 Annex 3 to the Memorial, paragraph (g), where it is asserted that the trust ended on 14 August 1946. It is apparent that he either never saw the trust deeds or was not at liberty to disclose their exact terms. 96. Spain, in its Preliminary Objections in March 1963, pages 61-62, remarked on the failure to produce the trust deeds. It also noted the fragile character of the "proof" that the trust ended on 14 August 19*46. It noted other documentary omissions by Belgium, some of which at least were later supplied - but the trust deeds were not supplied. In his final pleading of 21 July, counsel for Spain stressed the non-production of the trust agreements, calling attention to the whole record on this matter, ending with a reference to the opinion of Professor Chayes. In particular he remarked that the only transfer of shares which Securitas made was that of 3 May 1948 to Newman &amp; Co. - two-and-a-half months after the critical date of the declaration of bankruptcy. (This is in accord with A.M., Ann. 11, App. 2.) 97. I fully agree with Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice (in para. 58 of his Separate Opinion) that this Court does not have any fully developed practice on rules of evidence, but I believe that in the circumstances which have been described it is proper to apply the common law rule which is to the effect that if a party fails to produce on demand a relevant document which is in its possession, there may be an inference that the document "if brought, would have exposed facts unfavourable to the party ..." --. Although it is true, as Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice emphasizes, that one should give due weight to the pressuresengendered 1 Wigmore, Evidence, 3rd ed. 1940, Vol. 2, secs. 285 and 291. Wigmore traces the rule back to the beginning of the seventeenth century.</page><page sequence="106">by the situation in World War II, international law has long taken cognizance of practices designed to thwart belligerents by concealing the truth; the history of the law of neutral rights and duties, is full of examples. If disclosure of the text of the trust deeds would have prejudiced some governmental interest, Belgium could have pleaded this fact, as the United Kingdom successfully pleaded "naval secrecy" in the Corfu Channel case, I.C.J. Reports 1949T* pages 4, 32. Article 48 of the Rules of Court concerning documents submitted after the close of the written proceedings, requires consent of the other party or a special decision of the Court; in this instance, the other party asked for the production of the trust document. Nor was the Court strict in the instant case about applying the rule - witness the fact that over 4,000 pages of "new" documents were introduced by the two Parties during the oral proceedings between 21 April and 8 July 1969. 98. The legal aspect of the trust situation which is important is the one which distinguishes it from the nominee situation. As Chayes points out, during the trust, Securitas had not only legal title but full control, even though the beneficial title was in Sidro. Accordingly Belgian character of the claim did not exist during the trust. But in the nominee situations, the nominee is in the position of an agent and the legal title coincides with the beneficial title in the principal even though he is not a registered shareholder. 105. Belgium not having established the Belgian character of any substantial number of shares throughout the critical period which the continuity rule defines, might rely, and at times seemed to rely,</page><page sequence="107">333 'on the Belgian nationality of the group which shaped the will of the corporate person and dictated its policies. This also may be a difficult task in the case of great holding companies with many cross-holdings of shares /which eross-holdings, Belgium stated, were permissible under Belgian law. The centre of power may be deliberately concealed, not only in time of war, but for reasons of avoidance of taxation or of the application of anti-trust laws, or otherwise. . But whatever is the alleged basis for the State interests which justify protection, that basis must be proved just as much as if the justification were to be found solely in the continued nationality of shareholders.</page><page sequence="108">334 SEPARATE OPINION OF JUDGE PADILLA NERVO A claim by a State under the head of diplomatic protection of a national who is a shareholder of a commercial company is only admissible subject to a two-fold condition: the applicant State must be able to claim violation of a right of the shareholder as such; and it must be established that the State which was the author of the alleged violation was under an international obligation to the applicant State to ensure respect for the right in question. The receivability of a claim under that head is ruled out if it appears, firstly, that the right which is said to have been violated is a right of the company and not of the shareholder, and, secondly, that the international obligation to ensure respect for the said right was incumbent on the respondent State in respect of the national State of the company and not in respect of the national State of the shareholder. It follows from the principles of international law that in order for a State to be able to submit a claim in behalf of a national, it must be able to claim that its national has suffered an infringement of his own rights by a foreign State, and that rights have been infringed for which the latter State was bound to ensure respect by virtue of an international obligation binding on it in respect of the claimant State. There is nothing to prevent a State1s submitting a claim in behalf of a national which relates to that national's position in his capacity as a shareholder in a company; but, in such a case, it must prove that the person in question has been injured in the rights conferred upon him himself precisely on account of his capacity of being</page><page sequence="109">335 a shareholder: that he has been injured in rights which are inherent in that capacity. It is by no means sufficient that the claimant State rely upon an injury to the rights of the company as such, for no State may submit a claim in behalf of a person on the ground that there has been a failure to respect a right which belongs to another person, whether such latter person be a natural or a juristic person. International law only authorizes a State to intervene by way of diplomatic protection if such State relies upon a complaint which is its own complaint: that is to say, if it complains of the infringement of a right of one of its nationals, committed in violation of an international obligation which binds to it the State which has committed the infringement. If there has not been in the case at issue any infringement of any right of a shareholder, that fact cannot be altered simply by referring to interests as well as rights. The situation of the shareholder as defined by the various legal systems, covers the rights which are defined in the decision on the Brineart case. No system of positive law confers on a shareholder in a limited company other subjective legal situations and, in particular, no system attributes to him any legal interest in the property of the company, as has been expressly acknowledged by both sides. One cannot accept the transformation of a shareholder's hope for the prosperity of the company into a right or a legal interest, nor any possi bility for a shareholder to claim that an infringement of the rights of the company constitutes an infringement of his own legal situation. The rules of international law concerning the responsibility of the State regarding the treatment of foreigners would not make it possible to</page><page sequence="110">impute to a State an internationally unlawful act even in a case where the said State had only harmed an interest which was not protected by the municipal legal system of that State. There has not been established, in respect of the alleged Belgian shareholders of Barcelona Traction, the existence of any juridical situation whatsoever attaching to their status as shareholders which suffered any internationally unlawful attack on the part of the Spanish administrative or judicial authorities. Barcelona Traction is said to have been a "practically defunct" company. Shareholders are not entitled to take the place of the company in defending the latterTs own rights when it is these rights which have been affected, for so long at least as the company has not yet been dissolved and liquidated and the shareholders therefore have no right to its property and assets. It is only when a company has been dissolved and consequently ceases to exist as a separate legal entity that the shareholders take its place and are entitled to receive the balance of its property, after the corporate debt has been deducted. Thus it is only the "legal death" of the corporate person that may give rise to new rights appertaining to the shareholders as successors to the company. I do not concur with the view that the national State of the shareholders may exercise diplomatic protection when the act complained of was done by the national State of the company, for this would be equivalent to admitting that any State, on the pretext of protecting the interests of the shareholders in a foreign company, may deny the</page><page sequence="111">337 existence of the legal entity of companies organized in accordance with the laws of the national State of such companies. I have reservations about paragraph 92 of the Judgment. For the reasons stated above I am of the opinion that the so-called theory to which the paragraph refers does not have any validity. The fact that the Judgment ends the paragraph with the sentence: "Whatever the validity of this theory may be, it is certainly not applicable to the present case, since Spain is not the national State of Barcelona Traction" should not be interpreted as an admission that such "theory" might be applicable in other cases where the State whose responsibility is invoked is the national State of the company. I therefore cannot accept that this situation - which is not the one before the Court - should be considered as a limitation or exception to the strict application of the rule of international law, according to which the shareholders cannot be protected by their national State except in two instances: (a) when the company has been liquidated, and (b) when a right of the shareholder as such (right stpicto sensu) has been violated by an illicit act entailing international responsibility. The scope and increasing activities.of powerful international corporations have had as their field of operation the exploitation of the natural resources of many countries in the process of development and have controlled the functioning of many of their public services over which the territorial States have come to be, notwithstanding their sovereignty, in a subordinated position, and their right to demand compliance with the prescription of their municipal law on the</page><page sequence="112">338 matter has in many oases been challenged and put in jeopardy* Paced with the structure and practice of capitalist society in regard to foreign investment, many countries have imposed the requirement on foreign capital of taking the legal form prescribed by local legislation, The exercise of the sovereignty of States in this matter cannot be legally construed as a device to deprive the eventual shareholders in corporations of limited liability (soci?t?s anonymes) of the diplomatic action of their national State. Nationalization and expropriation, in accordance with the law on the matter, have been the result of the .essential need not to have public utilities and national resources subordinated to the private interests of foreign corporations. I am also of the opinion that neither is a limitation to the rule - according to which it is the national State of the company who has the right of protection - the fact that the protecting State does not exercise its right or ceases to do it. The right of protection is a discretionary one' and the national State of the company is not under a duty to protect. In respect to paragraph 93 I must make the following observations. The paragraph begins with the consideration that "in the field of diplomatic protection Of shareholders as in all other fields ... it is necessary that the law be applied reasonably". The phrase immediately following refers to a suggestion which might be interpreted as an example of reasonableness on the matter. The suggestion, or hypothesis, is to the effect that, "if in a given case it is not possible to apply the general rule" ... then, "considerations of equity might call for the possibility of protection of the shareholders in question by their own national State." The</page><page sequence="113">339 last sentence in this paragraph states: "This hypothesis does not correspond to the circumstances of the present case." I am of the opinion that there is no need for the Judgment to include reference to an irrelevant hypothesis. It is difficult to imagine a case in which it would be impossible to apply the general rule that the right of diplomatic protection of a company belongs to its national State. Towards the eventual and sporadic possessor of a bearer share there is not a direct and immediate obligation from the State accused of having violated the rights of a private foreign national (natural or juristic person) by an unlawful act damaging the cor poration (soci?t? anonyme) which has issued the bearer shares. The fact that theoretically there is not (or there need not be) continuity of ownership of a bearer share, the nationality of the eventual possessor does not give to his State a right towards the Respondent, who is not under an international obligation owed to every State which might have, or has, at a given date, some nationals in the possession ? bearer shares in the corporation alleged t# be injured by an illicit international act, unless specific rights of the shareholders as such were violated. In the present case, it is not Belgium but Canada who is the one entitled to protect its national, Barcelona Traction, in accordance with the existing recognized rule of protection of a company only by its national State.</page><page sequence="114">340 Regarding the question: "... whether international law recognizes the right of a State to protect its nationals, natural or juristic persons, as shareholders in a foreign company, for the damage they might have suffered as a consequence of an internationally illicit act done to the company by a third State", the answer, as a matter of law, should be in the negative. As regards the facts and circumstances of the particular case, they do not constitute a juridically valid ground to justify an exception to the existing rule. I agree with the Judgment of the Court that the Belgian olaim be dismissed. (Signed) Luis PADILLA NERVO</page><page sequence="115">341 /""Translation / SEPARATE OPINION OF JUDGE GROS 1. Although I accept the operative part of the present Judgment, my reasoning is entirely different. 4. ? In protecting shareholders in the company, Belgium claims to be protecting a moderate number of natural persons and certain companies that hold stock in Barcelona Traction; i.e., an important investment on the part of the Belgian economy. . . . . . Barcelona Traction is a company heading fourteen others in a group of its own (see A.M., Vol. I, Ann. 24; the table shows the make-up of the Barcelona Traction group of companies as at 31 December 1947), while itself forming part of a group which appears to be controlled by the Sofina company and, judging by the Belgium-Luxembourg index; in Who Owns Whom (Part I, B.E.13), involves over eighty closely-linked companies. One cannot simply ignore this fact and argue as if the case concerned the diplomatic protection of an ordinary limited company. The present case is a special one, firstly because the principal shareholders in Barcelona Traction are companies and secondly because Barcelona Traction itself is the holding company of a group of fourteen others which it controls either 100 per cent, (nine companies), or nearly 100 per cent, (four) or 90 per cent. (one). These features have several legal consequences for the question of diplomatic protection and for that of the jurisdiction competent to pass</page><page sequence="116">judgment on the activities of th? group. The question that has been raised concerns the fate of a large investment claimed to have been made by the Belgian economy in Spain, and it is to this question that an answer must be given. 6. In a period when Belgium a?id Spain were endeavouring to restore their economies, devastated by the world war or the civil war, a true account of the economic facts shows that all their resources, like those of other European States, were at that time mobilized for reconstruction; imports, exports and transport were State-controlled. Any harm done to essential elements of the national economy constituted, indeed, harm to the efforts at reconstructing that economy. If, as has been maintained, the Belgian investment in the Barcelona Traction undertaking in Spain was so considerable, it formed an element on which the Belgian Government was entitled to count in its plans for reconstruction (in its final submissions the 1948 value is estimated at 116 million dollars). The effects of two world wars on the foreign investments of nationals of the belligerent States are well known: each time funds invested abroad have had to be liquidated and repatriated. 10. The Court does not have to apply the rules of municipal law, as a municipal court of last instance would, to the relationships between the company and the shareholder; it takes account of them as being facts for the purpose of its appraisal of the legal situation laid before it by the Parties and in order to see whether that situation as</page><page sequence="117">343 a whole is in conformity with the rules of international law or not. It is the latter rules which for an international tribunal go to constitute the reasons of its decision. It is therefore not enough to say that since a given municipal legal system creates a certain legal relationship, an international tribunal is obliged, on account of "referral" to municipal law, to accept that relationship as possessing the same legal cogency. The international tribunal takes this legal relationship as an established fact and tests it against the rules of international law. This holds good in the present case for the relation ship between the shareholder and the limited company, which we will examine further below. 11. First, an observation with regard to the limited scope of the Judgment. If it is true that between 1948 and 1952, at the time of the acts complained of whereby the investment of which it is a question in the relations between Belgium and Spain changed hands, the legal system of neither^country contained any orovision generally enabling a shareholder to act in place or in behalf of a limited company, that is not a generally accepted rule. Suffice it to refer to the provisions of the French law of 24 July I966, which institutes for a minority of share holders a mechanism enabling them to participate in controlling the way a limited company is run, as well as an action for the reparation of damage sustained by the company (Articles 226 and 245)1. The result finally produced is that the position of the shareholder as regards the exercise of diplomatic protection would depend in each case on the existence of provisions of municipal law; if, in a given case of investment abroad, Likewise the Swedish company-law of 1944, revised in 1948, provides a right of action for a 10 per cent, minority of shareholders (Art. 129); there are similar provisions in Norwegian law (Art. 122 of the 1957 company-law) and in Articles 122-124 of the corresponding law of the Federal Republic of Germany.</page><page sequence="118">one of the States in question allowed shareholders an individual right of action, that would be sufficient to preclude basing on the referral theory any finding that the State had no capacity. 12. If the referral method is'not applicable in the present case and if the provisions of municipal law are merely factual data, the complaint that the shareholders in a limited company were despoiled must be judged in terms of the rules of international law applicable to foreign investments in the territory of a State, and it would appear that, as between two European States such as Belgium and Spain, on the critical dates no less than at present, a total loss of assets that results from acts described as unlawful and is wholly unindemnified, which amounts to confiscation, constitutes a grievance justifying proceedings to establish international responsibility. One cannot but observe how an industrial undertaking which nobody ever claimed to be Spanish before 19^8 became Spanish, against the will of the corporate organs of Barcelona Traction, as a result of acts characterized as a denial of justice both overall and in detail. In fact the undertaking is today incorporated into the economy of Spain by a sort of "nationalization" which, if it was effected by a misuse of legal procedure, constitutes a breach of international law as between the Parties. It is clear that any nationalization of a regular kind would have been accompanied by compensation. 13. It has been maintained that the shareholder cannot sustain direct damage: the damage is always to the company; it is true that the shareholder's personal finances might be adversely affected, but only</page><page sequence="119">345 "on the rebound". Here we once again come up against the theory based on certain systems of municipal law as they stood in the early stages of limited-company legislation, explaining the latter by the idea that the shareholder confides his investment to the company for better and for worse, and must accept all the risks without having any right to the protection which the holder of a bond enjoys. As applied to the small private investor, this theory is incorrect in its economic justification, but it is even more incorrect as regards the majority of large companies in the modern economic scene - and this was already true in 1948. . It is inadmissible for the legal analysis to ignore the economic facts; the shareholder-bondholder contrast is now meaningless if the situation of the State in relation to the company be envisaged. 15. ..... the Judgment recognizes the possibility of action by the State of the shareholders when the company has disappeared. In the present case the company has been entirely deprived of the means for pursuing its corporate objects and, from the point of view of the shareholder^, this produces the same effects as a disappearance of the company. The shade of differentiation is therefore a matter of form or rather of formality. As from I952 the corporate objects of the Barcelona Traction group have been void of meaning"1". The argument using the fact that Barcelona Traction shares have recently been transacted to prove that the company is still active is unconvincing. A few purchases or sales are enough to keep certain loan stock, unpaid for over half a century, quoted on some exchanges. When it is said that the shareholder has the right to dispose of his share this certainly means to dispose of it under normal conditions, which - apart from a few speculations on the outcome of the present case before the Court - is no longer true in respect of Barcelona Traction.</page><page sequence="120">346 . The damage to the company is that it is destroyed; the damage to the shareholders is that they are injured in respect of their property through the destruction of the invest ment; the damage suffered by the State of the shareholders is that one component element of the national economy has undergone spoliation. The cause of the responsibility is in all cases the unlawful act of the State, and the action for the protection of the shareholders cannot be described as an intervention in the domestic affairs of that State, as has sometimes been alleged, unless it is claimed that denial of justice does not come within the purview of international law. The point that there should not be any double reparation, on the one hand for the company and on the other for the share holders, mirrors a very understandable concern for fair play. But intellectually and juridically the individualization of the damage remains a possibility. 19. To apply this reasoning more specifically to the case, there is a complaint of denial of justice, the claim that an industrial undertaking was made to change hands by procedures that are described as unlawful, and therefore a problem of violation of international law. The substance of the obligation invoked against the Spanish Government is the obligation to respect the investments of Belgian nationals and to protect them from unlawful acts: this is a general obligation incumbent upon States in the conduct of their economic relations. The Belgian Government's capacity to institute proceedings corresponds to the right possessed by every State to secure the respect of that obligation, when the investments of its nationals constitute an important part of the national economy. The foundation of a rule</page><page sequence="121">347 of economic international law must abide by economic realities. The companyfs link of bare nationality may not reflect any substantial economic bond. As between the two criteria the judge must choose the one on the test of which the law and the facts coincide: it is the State whose national economy is in fact adversely affected that possesses the right to take legal action. 22. It has not been established that Canada has capacity to institute proceedings in behalf of Barcelona Traction, since that company was Canadian in appearance"*" only and since, in the economic sphere, the pro tection of investments must conform to the reality of the connection. 24. Although the Court has rejected the possibility of considering any analogy with the Nottebohm case, it seems to me that the Nottebohm Judgment does establish a relative standard and does not go further than the rule already recalled: "each case must be considered on its individual merits". Thus, even without any need to rely on that Judgment, the particulars of the present case are such as to place in the forefront of the matters which the Court should have investigated the problem of the real provenance of the investments in question. The theory of the genuine connection implies comparison between Canada, Belgium and Spain - and perhaps other States -, 1 Notwithstanding the references in the Judgment in paragraph 71 to various points of connection with Canada, I agree with the observations made by Judge Jessup in paragraph 49 of his separate opinion (in particular the footnote thereto). Those really in control of Barcelona Traction do not seem to have featured any genuine connection with Toronto.</page><page sequence="122">348 and inquiry into the concentration of the undertaking in Spain, the problem as to whether the real control lay with the organs of Barcelona Traction or elsewhere, and the reality of the Belgian investment. As the Court did not in fact consider these verifications to be necessary, it is difficult to give any final opinion concerning the real connection of Barcelona Traction with any national economy, but the documents in the case do permit of a few conclusions. 25. The connection with the national economy of Canada is certainly not the most conspicuous, for the undertaking has never appeared to constitute a factor of production in that economy. The connection of Barcelona Traction with the Spanish economy cannot be disputed so far as the factor of the production of goods and services in Spain is concerned. The company concentrated all its activities in Spain, and its subsidiaries, Spanish companies all but three, were under its absolute control, so that it may be considered that the Barcelona Traction group as an integrated enterprise formed a component in the Spanish national production. But although this aspect of the matter may have legal consequences, more particularly in respect of certain problems of jurisdiction, it has none whatsoever for the purpose of ascertaining with which State the foreign investments under lying the creation and development of the enterprise are truly connected. Itvhas not been established that these investments were mainly Spanish. There is therefore, from the standpoint of the law applicable to the investments, no genuine connection with the Spanish economy. 26. The connection with the Belgian economy has been made the subject of exhaustive commentary by Judge Sir Gerald Pitzmaurice and</page><page sequence="123">349 Judge Jessup. Por the sake of brevity, I will merely say that I do not feel proof has been supplied that the investments in question belong to the Belgian economy in the sense of the view propounded in this opinion. In this case, proof has not been supplied in a manner satisfying for a court that Barcelona Traction, in continuous fashion, predominantly - or even substantially - represented an investment on the part of the Belgian economy. While it was possible to adumbrate proof that over certain periods, in terms of origin of capital invested and of actual governance of industrial and financial operations, the Belgian economy was more involved than others, the observations made by Judge Jessup in paragraphs 72-98 of his opinion show that the same has not been proved true of the period after 1940, more particularly during part of the critical period. Neither was it possible to demonstrate a predominant, constant and certain connection with the Belgian economy on the basis of an inspection of the company-group of which Barcelona Traction forms part. 27. Finding that proof of Barcelona Traction's appurtenance to the Belgian economy has not been produced, whether on account of the internal organization of the group or for other reasons, I am obliged to conclude that the claim must be dismissed. 28. I would add that there is another ground on which I would consider the dismissal of the claim justified, .... The fact that a State may invoke the right to protect its nationals who are shareholders in a company does not exempt the company from the obligation of exhausting the local remedies available for the</page><page sequence="124">350 rectification of the situation complained about. Barcelona Traction ought to have entered a plea of opposition to the judgment declaring bankruptcy within the legal time-limit, and there are no reasonable grounds for deciding that the companyfs failure to enter such opposition within the time-limit does not form a bar to the institution of proceedings on the international level. As Sir Hersch Lauterpacht wrote in his separate opinion on the Certain Norwegain Loans case: "however contingent and theoretical these remedies may be, an attempt ought to have been made to exhaust them" (I.C.J. Reports 1957, P. 39). As it happens, at the time when the Reus judge gave his decision, there was nothing to justify the contention that'the remedy of opposition was merely theoretical. Generally speaking, in bankruptcy law the bankruptcy judgment divests the bankrupt as soon as it is delivered and before any publication; the rule is perhaps too rigorous but there are reasons for it with which specialists in commercial law are familiar, and that effect was at all events a feature of Spanish law in 19481. Even if it had been Intended to maintain that this rule was contrary to a general principle of law, it was necessary to enter opposition to the judgment while expressing the necessary reservations as to the lack of notification; this complaint ought indeed to have been laid in the first instance before the local judge so that he could rule upon it and, if need be, rectify the situation. Whether it be Spanish law or international law that is considered to have been violated, it is necessary to request the local There is nowhere to be found, in the laws of Spain in force at that time, any provisions concerning publication which are such that they enable the existence to be deduced of a general principle of law the infringement of which would ipso facto render the entire proceedings null and void. And if it be held that failure to publish the judgment at the bankrupt's place of domicile constitutes a breach of Article 1044 (5) of the Spanish Commercial Code, then it is to the Spanish courts that complaint must first be addressed in this regard.</page><page sequence="125">351 courts to look into th? matter and allow them the opportunity of correcting any mistake. 29. The necessity of entering a plea of opposition becomes still more evident when it is observed how the concentration of the industrial under taking in Spain lends colour, prima facie, to the Spanish assumption of jurisdiction, on considering the jurisdiction problem in general and quite apart from the petition for bankruptcy on account of failure to honour bonds. The corporate purpose of the undertaking is to develop the hydro-electricity industry in Spain, and the electric railway and tramway system in the city and province of Barcelona (cf. Moodyys Public Utility Manual, I968, p*. 2067). No area other than Spain is contemplated for hydro-electric development, and in fact Barcelona Traction never undertook works in any other country; its subsidiaries operated electricity production and distribution systems in Barcelona, Catalonia "and the industrial cities of Tarrasa, Tarragona, Reus" (sic) "and Tortosa" (ibid.: it should be noted that these details are based on information supplied by the company; see the paragraphs "Property Seized" and "Assets in Spain sold"). In these circumstances, the absence of publication in Canada can be seen in a particular light; furthermore, the considerations set forth in a number of separate opinions concerning the genuineness or otherwise of the company's headquarters in Toronto could have been adduced by the Spanish judge, who could also have invoked the judicial precedents of certain States, where foreign companies which have a branch, have carried on business, issued bends or entered into contracts within the national territory have been</page><page sequence="126">352 adjudged bankrupt1. It should be noted that the courts of certain States have declared bankruptcies for non-repayment of loans, when a businessman has called on credit in their territory, though that is an exceptional circumstance. The claim to possess a certain jurisdiction over the activities of the Barcelona Traction group in Spain was consequently not, a priori, illegitimate, though this does not imply the legitimacy of all the measures for the execution of the bankruptcy, or of the actual petition made to the Re us judge. But the state,, of the law concerning the bankruptcy of foreign companies was not, at the time of the facts, such as to justify any abandonment by the company of the remedies open to it. In several European legal systems a debtor can be declared bankrupt by the courts of a co?ntry in which he carries on a secondary occupation or possesses assets (Article 9 of the Italian, Article 2 of the Netherlands and Article 238 of the Federal German laws concerned), or even if his assets there are negative (French case-law). Some doubt is thrown on the character of Barcelona Traction as a holding company by direct activities in Spain (cf. hearing of 14 July I969 /pp. 23fJ). (Signed) Andr? GROS</page><page sequence="127">353 /""Translation / DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE RIPHAGEN 1. To my great regret I find myself unable to concur in the decision of the Court, and I wish to avail myself of my right under Article 57 of the Statute to state the reasons for my dissent. 11. In fact, in "classic" cases of diplomatic protection the interest of a State in "its" international commerce merges with its interest in the welfare of its nationals, natural persons, both in respect of their personal safety and fundamental freedoms and in respect of their power to administer their property and their right to draw profits therefrom. The elements of "the undertaking" are thus united in one single indivisible natural person, and that personTs appurtenance to ? specific State does not normally pose any problems. The employment of the legal form of the limited company (with its own legal personality, in private municipal law) complicates the situation. 12. In the first place, it is hard to recognize that a limited company as such can have personal safety or fundamental freedoms. (We may leave aside the question of whether.under municipal law the company as such might complain of an infringement of the personal safety or fundamental freedoms of the natural persons which "represent" it.) It is thus solely a matter of the undertaking^ "economic" interests: its activities and its property. Now in reality the legal form of the limited company lends itself to fairly varied kinds</page><page sequence="128">354 of organization of the economic interests of the undertaking. There is the type of company in which legal personality corresponds to economic independence of the undertaking; the administration of the undertaking is in the hands of independent directors and the profits are in principle appropriated to the undertaking itself, i.e., generally re-invested (after the deduction, in suitable cases, of a certain remuneration for the capital already invested). Bat there is also the type of company which is in reality a form of organization for co-operation in an undertaking by shareholders who not only furnish the capital but also effectively administer the undertaking and draw the profits themselves. Finally, there is a third type of company, in which the undertaking is integrated into another more extensive undertaking, belonging to another company which dominates it. Obviously these are types of companies (corresponding to different types of shareholders), and not categories separated by water-tight divisions. Of course, the municipal private law applicable to these three types of company is generally the same. On the other hand, in the field of municipal tax law, several countries recognize the fundamental difference between these three types by affording them different treatment. On the plane of customary international law, i.e., both in order to determine what is affected by the conduct of a State towards a limited company, and in order to determine the link between what is affected and another State, it seems a priori necessary to take account of the reality of the differences between these three types of companies.. 159 The Judgment observes (para. 65) "... that from the economic viewpoint the company ?I.e., Barcelona Traction^ has been entirely</page><page sequence="129">355 paralysed" and that it "has been deprived of all its Spanish sources of income". It is indisputable that the measures taken by the Spanish authorities affected the undertaking as such. The essential point is thus the existence or non-existence of a link between the undertaking and the Belgian State sufficient for it to be considered on the international plane that the international commerce of the latter State is affected by those measures. It is thus the second question referred to above which is raised by the entry upon the scene of limited companies in international commerce: that of the link between what is affected by the conduct of a State, and another State. In this connection too it seems impossible to disregard the difference between the three types of companies and shareholders referred to above. 2j5. Barcelona Traction clearly belongs to the third type of company described above, i.e., the type of company whose undertaking is integrated into another undertaking, that of the Sidro company, the chief shareholder in which is a further company, Sofina. The links between Sidro and Sofina have not been made completely clear (it appears that Sidro was also a shareholder in Sofina). Nevertheless, throughout the relevant period, the connecting factors between both these companies and Belgium were such that it can hardly be denied that a sufficient bond exists between the undertaking of these companies and the Belgian State. 24* It has nevertheless been contended that this bond, an essential element ia'which is Sidro1s controlling holding in Barcelona Traction, acquired a few years after the First World War, was broken</page><page sequence="130">356 by the fact that the Barcelona Traction shares belonging to Sidro were the subject of certain contracts entered into on the approach and at the outbreak of the Second World War. During that period, Sidro formed in the United States a company called Securitas Ltd., as well as the partnership of Charles Gordon and Co. Contracts were entered into between Sidro and Securitas and between Securitas and Charles Gordon and Co. It is not disputed that Securitas Limited, as well as the firm of Charles Gordon and Co., were in reality mere alter egos of Sidro-Sofina, nor that the whole purpose of the operation was precisely to ensure that Sidro1s effective share in the capital and management of Barcelona Traction might continue despite the occupation of Belgian territory by the German armed forces, and without being hampered by such measures as the allied States might take in the context of their war-time legislation with respect to property belonging to companies resident in enemy-occupied territory. Nor is it disputed that this objective was in fact attained. This type of operation is well-known in those European countries which were occupied by German forces during the Second World War, as well as in Allied countries, such as the United States and Canada, where the principal officers of companies in,the European countries in question found a refuge which enabled them to continue to run those companies' affairs. The authorities of the Allied host-countries, moreover, generally afforded the co-operation necessary for the achievement of the operation's purpose. In these circumstances, the events summarized above cannot be regarded, on the plane of international law, as having broken the bond between the Belgian State and the Barcelona Traction undertaking.</page><page sequence="131">357 27? ? ? it is important to notice that in the present case it is hot only a question of an injury to property belonging to the company, nor again of a limitation placed upon the free conduct of the company's affairs by its principal officers, but of an injury to the undertaking as such, which has passed in its entirety into the hands of a Spanish group. One cannot ignore this fact in determining the jus standi of Belgium, whose interest is founded on the very fact that the Barcelona Traction undertaking is integrated into that of companies having important connecting factors with that State, 28? Furthermore, the character of the conduct of the Spanish State of which Belgium complains is also not unrelated to the question of Belgium's jus standi. An essential element in the Belgian claim is its contention that in the circumstances of the case the injury to the undertaking was the result of Spanish measures which necessarily exceeded the limits which international law imposes on the jurisdiction of any State. The character of such conduct is such as to influence the determination of the States entitled to demand reparation for the damage suffered by them in consequence of such measures. 30. The 1964 Judgment, which joined the preliminary objections relating t? jus standi and the exhaustion of local remedies to the merits, did so for reasons which laid stress first on the legal ties between the questions raised and the actual rights and obligations of States in the matter of the treatment of foreigners, and secondly on the need to elucidate certain questions of fact. Accordingly, the 1964 Judgment seems to be based on the considerations set forth above.</page><page sequence="132">The present Judgment, on the other hand, confines itself to rejecting the Belgian Government's claim on the sole basis that "no jus standl before the Court has been established" (para. 102 of the Judgment), a conclusion which, in its turn, seems to be derived exclusively from legal considerations regarding the distinct personality of companies in municipal private law, all of which considerations might have been put forward in 1964.
