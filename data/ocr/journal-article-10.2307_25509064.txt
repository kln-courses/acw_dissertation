<plain_text><page sequence="1">118 Lismore and Cashel: reflections on the beginnings of Romanesque architecture in Munster Tadhg O'Keeffe, Member The monastery at Lismore, county Waterford, played a key role in the reform of the Irish church in the 12th century. A small body of Romanesque material from the site and from Kilmolash and Coole, two smaller monastic sites in its vicinity, is described and analysed in this paper. Cormac Mac Carthaig's patronage of churches at Lismore and Cashel in the 1120s is considered, and the relationships between these churches and other early 12th century churches in Munster are assessed. The title of this paper alludes to Liam de Paor's celebrated article of nearly three decades ago, 'Cormac's Chapel: the beginnings of Irish Romanesque' (1967), in which he argued that the famous Romanesque church built between 1127 and 1134 at Cashel, county Tipperary, represented the genesis of the native Romanesque style. De Paor's thesis, which has found general acceptance among more recent writers (Stalley 1981; Garton 1981), rested on two principal foundations, one general and one site-specific. Firstly, the recognition that Ireland's Romanesque style was part of a pan-European phenomenon that emerged in Continental Europe in the 11th century and reached its apogee in the early 12th century brought with it the realisation that neither the chronology of Irish Romanesque architecture nor the models for its development should be at variance with what is known of other Romanesque traditions. Secondly, Cormac's Chapel could be separated from the mainstream of Irish 12th century church-building because, in apparent contrast to many Irish churches of the period, it was quite clearly conceived, not simply as a building with strategically-placed Romanesque detail, but as an entire work of architecture, a sacred space sealed on all sides by Romanesque masonry and articulated by Romanesque sculpture that was evidently uncontaminated by motifs from the native repertoire. The case de Paor made for the Chapel being 'at or near' (1967, 142) the beginning of a Romanesque tradition that became increasingly 'Hibernicised' as the century unfolded was compelling. History provided circumstantial validation for his view: Irish annalists rarely recorded the building of new churches, but the fact that the building of Cormac's Chapel merited widespread note in the annals {Al; AFM; ALC; MC) suggested, as Champneys wrote, that it may have been 'more or less a new departure' in architecture (1910, 132). Cashel was certainly an appropriate setting for the germination of a new style given that it was an epicentre of the reform movement for which the Romanesque style provided a visual expression, and that the building of 102 Palmerstown Drive, Dublin 20. JRSAI Vol. 124 (1994): 118-152</page><page sequence="2">LISMORE AND CASHEL 119 Cormac's Chapel itself occurred within a generation of Cashel's elevation in 1111 to the status of archbishopric. Francoise Henry wisely pointed out a quarter of a century ago that establishing the early history of Irish Romanesque architecture is made difficult by the destruction of the small number of churches known historically to have been built at important sites between the 1120s and the 1140s (1970, 156-7); one might add to her caveat an unknown number of cathedral churches, including at Cashel itself, newly built in the immediate aftermath of the Synod of Raith Bressail in 1111 but later rebuilt in the Gothic style. Of the key sites that Henry listed, SS Peter and Paul's at Armagh, consecrated by Cellach in 1126, and the church of Augustinian canons at Bangor, county Down, founded by Malachy after 1140, are perhaps the least important in the context of later architectural developments since the Irish Romanesque style had, for reasons yet to be established, very little impact on the northern half of the country. Significantly, the other two sites listed by Henry are both associated with Cormac Mac Carthaig, king of Munster from 1123 to 1138 and the patron after whom the chapel at Cashel is named. One is Gill Abbey in Cork, founded by Cormac after 1134 (Gwynn and Hadcock 1970, 167). The surviving fragments, published for the first time in this Journal a decade ago (Bradley and King 1985), suggest a building with a sculptural programme similar to that of the chapel at Cashel. The other site is Lismore, county Waterford. Located on a navigable stretch of the Blackwater, Lismore had a monastery that was as important as Cashel in generating and promoting the spirit of church reform, and two sources, the so-called Dublin Annals of Inisfalien and the Book of McCarthy, record that Cormac built churches there in 1127 (Henry 1970, 156). This Society visited Lismore at the end of the last century and again early in the present century, and in the Papers and Proceedings in the Journal in both 1897 and 1912 mention is made of Romanesque architectural fragments preserved there; indeed, in the latter volume a drawing of the most substantial Romanesque item, a chevron-decorated archway in Lismore Castle, was published (1912, 272, Fig. 7). Despite the intrinsic interest of Romanesque remains from a monastery of Lismore's importance, this small body of material has attracted little attention. Girouard noted the castle archway and suggested it came from a west doorway or chancel arch originally (1964, 338) while Harbison remarked on the fragments in the cathedral, suggesting that they may have originated in a church erected by Malchus, the first bishop of Lismore, who died in 1135 (Harbison, Potterton and Sheehy 1978, 81-2). Items of Romanesque sculpture from two smaller, neighbouring monasteries, Kilmolash, county Waterford, and Coole, county Cork, have also gone largely unnoticed, leaving the Lismore area rather under-represented in ideas on the distribution of Romanesque stonework. This paper attempts to bring material from the Waterford-east Cork area into focus, firstly by offering a full corpus of it, including some finds made at Lismore in recent years, and secondly by attempting to identify by comparative analysis those items that might have originated under Cormac Mac Carthaig's patronage. The value of this material for Romanesque studies in Ireland arises from its chronological relationship with Cashel. Whereas one could argue that the Gill Abbey sculpture in Cork was produced by workmen who had travelled southwards having finished in Cashel, the Lismore churches were contemporary with Cormac's Chapel, and were conceivably completed before it. Meagre though it is, the Lismore material, therefore, is potentially of great importance, and its publication provides an opportunity to consider afresh the emergence of a native Romanesque style in early 12th century Ireland.</page><page sequence="3">120 T. O'KEEFFE In the first part of this paper, then, the remains in Lismore and its vicinity are documented, and comments on their date and stylistic affinities are offered. The relationships between Lismore and Cashel, and between both those sites and other early 12th century churches inside and outside Ireland, are explored in the second part of the paper. These are relationships which lie at the heart of our understanding of the early history of Irish Romanesque architecture, and fresh appraisal of them allows a refinement of the model proposed by de Paor. Lismore The monastery of Lismore was founded by Mo-Chutu (Carthach) following his expulsion in 636 from his monastery at Rahan, county Offaly (Byrne 1973,171; Sanderlin 1992, 28). In the early middle ages Lismore enjoyed a high intellectual profile, with a scriptorium (Sanderlin 1992, 34) and an ascetic tradition that contributed much to the Cell De reform (O'Dwyer 1981, 176). At the Synod of Raith Bressail in 1111 a diocese of 'Lismore or Port Lairge' is named. The latter - Waterford - had been one of the Hiberno-Norse dioceses of the late 11th century, and its first bishop was an Irishman, Malchus (Mael Iosa Ua h-Ainmire), who had been trained as a Benedictine monk at Winchester under Walkelin (Walchelin), and consecrated at Canterbury in 1096 by Anselm. At Raith Bressail Malchus was named as archbishop of Cashel, so clearly he had relinquished the Waterford see by 1111. On the evidence of St Bernard's Vita S. Malachiae, Malchus was again bishop of a united diocese of Lismore and Waterford by 1121, and the annals record his death at Lismore as an octogenarian bishop of Waterford in 1135 (Gwynn 1992, 185, 198-9, 227). During the time that Malchus was archbishop of Cashel, Lismore and Waterford seem to have remained a combined diocese: between 1111 and 1152, when a bishop of Waterford, Tostius, is recorded as being at the Synod of Kells, Malchus is the only named bishop of Waterford, while during that time there are obituaries for bishops of Lismore in 1113 and 1119 (Al). The bishop who died in 1113 was Niall Mac Meic Aeducain, whose name is recorded on the Lismore Crozier as the patron of that item of metalwork (Henry 1970, 97-98). When the archbishopric of Armagh had become vacant in 1106, Cellach, elevated to the position of comarbus Pdtraic the previous year, was consecrated in Munster, and probably at Cashel. On his death at Ardpatrick in 1129, his body was carried to Lismore, as he had requested, and was 'buried with honour in the tomb of the bishops' (AU). Malachy (Maol M'Aedhog Ua Morgair), Cellach's chosen successor as archbishop of Armagh, seems to have been in Lismore twice, once in 1121, and again in 1127 (Gwynn 1992,199). Indeed St Bernard tells us that it was Malchus of Lismore and Gilbert of Limerick, another notable reformer, who were most forceful in persuading Malachy to accept the see in Armagh after Cellach's death (Vita S. Malachiae IV, 20: Lawlor 1920, 47-8). In 1127 'Cormac, son of Mac Carthaig, king of Desmumu, was deposed by the Munstermen themselves, and he entered Les Mor, and much destruction was wrought in his absence' (Al). St Bernard tells us that Cormac went to Lismore to be one of the brethren and to live a suitably austere life, with Malachy as his teacher (Vita S. Malachiae I, 9: Lawlor 1920, 22). Another source records that Cormac took the tonsure (MC). His stay at Lismore was shorter than he intended, however, and he was restored to his kingdom later in 1127 (6 Corrain 1974, 58; Gwynn 1992, 207).</page><page sequence="4">LISMORE AND CASHEL 121 Church-building in 12th century Lismore In the mid-18th century Smith noted the remains of 'many churches' in Lismore, claiming that 'at least' twenty had been built (1746, 53). It is not clear how many churches were built in the monastery of Lismore, even in the early 12th century. A stone church is mentioned in the annals in 1051 (ALC; AU\ AFM). In 1086 Mael Isu ua Brolchain, 'excellent in learning, prayer, poetry, and in any language' died and was buried at Lismore; his oratory and part of Lismore were destroyed by fire in 1116 (ALC). The Dublin Annals of Innisfallen, a compilation of annalistic material made in 1765 (6 Cuileannain 1947), record that in 1127 Cormac Mac Carthaig built two churches at Lismore and began the building of another at Cashel (Petrie 1845, 290). In The Book of McCarthy it is stated that in 1126 - the date should be 1127 according to all other sources - Cormac built 'a church at Cashel and twelve churches at Lismore', and repeats this in Cormac's obit in 1138 (MC). Henry suggested this was a copyist's error and that the number of churches was two (1970, 156 n.5); this certainly seems the more likely number. The destruction by fire of churches and houses is recorded in 1157 (MC). A new church was blessed at a synod held at Lismore in 1166 which was presided over by the papal legate and attended by twelve bishops of Leth Moga, Munster and Leinster (Al). It is questionable whether Lismore would have had a church designated cathedral in the period prior to its separation from Waterford at the Synod of Kells in 1152. Waterford would certainly have had a cathedral from c.l 100 since it was the centre of a diocese from 1096; Malchus, its first bishop, would have been familiar with the great cathedrals of Winchester and Canterbury, while the evidence of St Peter's Church, the only pre-Norman church known to us in Waterford (Hurley 1992, 54-7), suggests that the Hiberno-Scandinavian community had its own independent tradition of church architecture in the 1000s and early 1100s. Lismore's first cathedral church might have been built by Gille Criost Ua Conairche, a Cistercian, who was bishop and papal legate from 1152 to 1179; there would have been a cathedral by 1200 when the diocese entered a century and a half of struggle to maintain its independence from Waterford (Gwynn and Hadcock 1970, 92). The present Cathedral at Lismore belongs largely to the 17th century (Galloway 1992, 167-8) but incorporates medieval work: the discovery in 1989 of Romanesque painted plaster (described below) in the north wall of the chancel suggests some of the chancel structure survives from a 12th century church, while the crossing arches, and the foundations and lower walls of the south side of the chancel, are of the early 13th century. Romanesque at Lismore Preserved and displayed in the cathedral are items of sculpture, a number of which can definitely be identified as Romanesque. Seated figure Built into the interior west wall of the Cathedral, this figure (Fig. 1; Henry 1937, Fig. 1) occupies the full area of a rectangular slab 58cm high and 23cm wide. Carved in low relief, it is seated, and resting on its knees is a book, held open with one hand and taking up the full width of the slab. Drapes of clothing are represented on the figure's lower legs, but the feet can be seen. The head of the figure is large relative to the body. The surface of the face is quite flat. Its forehead is short, its ears are high, and lines are gouged on the</page><page sequence="5">:|iic:::jl~ililiiljtt^ N^ S _^s"tI :iii?llillIW V v- 4'' !? fM - ^**^w-f- rr? ~*S tn . .??? . , i^^^^m 2 O CM m Fig. 1 a &amp; b Caryatid in Lismore Cathedral</page><page sequence="6">LISMORE AND CASHEL 123 cheeks and around the mouth. Tendrils of hair are visible on the head's right-hand side. In this Journal a century ago the figure was identified as St John (1897, 357). It is more likely on comparative grounds to be Christ: reliefs of comparable conception but higher quality are found at places such as Regensburg (Hearn 1981, 57), Toulouse (Hearn 1981, 72) and Durham (Zarnecki 1953, PL 131). An inscription in mixed capitals and half uncials and arranged in four horizontal lines across the open pages of the book was recorded by Macalister. He read the inscription as IN ME(n)SAM DOMINI IERUSALEM DET ARMA ET CORONOS AUR(I) and translated it as "upon the Table of the Lord let Jerusalem lay (her) arms and crowns of gold" (1938; but see Henry 1937, 306). Lismore contrasts with the other Romanesque sites in Ireland with architectural inscriptions: Killeshin, county Laois and Freshford, county Kilkenny, both dating to the 1150s, and Monaincha, county Tipperary, dating to the 1160s, have inscriptions arranged in continuous lines along architectural members but not integral to the architecture, whereas a primary purpose of the Lismore sculpture was to carry an inscription. Henry suggested that this figure belongs in the same series as the statuesque figures on White Island, county Fermanagh (1937, 306). A date in the 12th century is suggested, however, by the tendrils of hair at the side of the head, for which parallels can be found on Romanesque heads at places as widely distributed as Clone, county Wexford, and Kilmore, county Cavan. The head of the Lismore figure lacks the naturalism that is a feature of many of the heads in Cormac's Chapel, or the head carved on the Romanesque slab (a cross-head?) discovered in excavations in Waterford City (Hurley 1982, Fig. 3.4). One might speculate that the figure, being something of an oddity in a 12th century Irish context, is likely to belong to the early 12th century, a time when new stylistic ideas were streaming into Lismore and stimulating the monastery's artists. The Lismore figure might have served the same caryatid function as the White Island sculptures, but where exactly within a church it might have been positioned is guesswork. Rather than fulfil a structural role in a church, however, the figure might have been displayed as a wall panel above or beside the entrance to the church: for example, the three famous mid-llth century panels t ??? 20 cm Fig. 2 Impost fragment in Lismore Cathedral</page><page sequence="7">124 T. O'KEEFFE bearing figures from the Bavarian church of St Emmeran, Regensburg (Hearn 1981, 57), are displayed above a great twin-entrance in their original configuration (Sauerlander 1984, 521) without having a structural role. Impost Also built into the west wall of the Cathedral is a fragment of an impost, 52cm in length, 15cm in width, but of unknown depth (Fig. 2). Henry described this as an abacus (1937, 306) but it is probably better identified as an impost. The fascia is decorated with two rows of billet, deployed in a chequer-board fashion with every second square in false relief, and in the chamfer below are six bosses connected to each other by scrolls. Billet is quite rare in Ireland. It appears on abaci in Cormac's Chapel and in another early 12th century church, Ardfert Cathedral, county Kerry, but in contrast to its use on the Lismore fragment it appears in these two churches as a feature of a chamfer rather than a fascia, it is in single rows rather than two rows, and it is semi-cylindrical or tubular rather than square in cross-section. Billet of a type more akin to that on the-Lismore impost is used as a motif in the diaper on the responds between the blind arches on the interior walls of the nave of Cormac's Chapel, and on the hood moulding of the portal of Killeshin, probably dating to the 1150s. Comparable examples of connected bosses are, by contrast, found only in post-1150 contexts in Ireland. The motif is found on the west portal of the church at Aghadoe, located on the north shore of Lough Leane in county Kerry; this is the 'great church' built in honour of the Trinity and Mary which was completed in 1158 by Amhlaoibh 6 Donnchadha, and in which Amhlaoibh was buried on the right side of the altar (MC). The cornice at Templenahoe, a nave and chancel church (the chancel is now destroyed) beside the cathedral at Ardfert, has similar bosses: this building might be dated to about 1160 as the motifs and mouldings on the interior of its south window are exactly paralleled at Aghadoe. Bosses of this type also appear on the imposts of the chancel arch in the largest of the Rahan churches in county Offaly, probably dating to the middle of the century. The billet may indicate that the Lismore impost is early 12th century and therefore bring the date of connected bosses back before 1150; alternatively, the bosses may be the more accurate indicator of date, and the billet may thus be post-1150. One might even venture that this impost fragment came from the church that was consecrated in 1166. ?*^-^^^? 20cm Fig. 3 a Re-used Capital, Lismore Cathedral b Fragment of engaged column, Lismore Cathedral c Ex situ capital, Lismore Cathedral</page><page sequence="8">LISMORE AND CASHEL 125 Re-used capital Lying on the floor at the west end of the cathedral is a square block of stone, two faces of which are cut as a Romanesque scalloped capital (Fig. 3a). This piece was later re-used as part of a window jamb; the chamfer and rebate cut into the back of the capital for this re-use are typical of 13th century work. The capital is decorated on each face with two scallops (one large and one small), and with a volute (now broken) on the corner. The scallops are outlined with incised arcs. Forms of scalloped capital are present in Romanesque contexts in Ireland from a comparatively early date and remained popular, but this might be an early example: Cormac's Chapel has examples comparable to that in Lismore in having the scallops outlined by incised arcs, but nowhere in the Chapel are there volutes. Fragment of engaged column A single, 21cm long fragment remains of a roll moulding 13cm in diameter (Fig. 3b). The width of the roll suggests this stone belonged in a doorway and that the engaged roll was used in the return angles. Comparable stones are found at Aghacross, county Cork, dated to the middle of the 12th century (O'Keeffe 1995a, 26). Fig. 4 Animal head on south-east crossing pier, Lismore Cathedral</page><page sequence="9">126 T. O'KEEFFE Ex situ capital A capital (Fig. 3c) preserved at the west end of the Cathedral has parallels in the Cistercian lavabo at Mellifont, county Louth (see Leask 1960, PI.111b, c), dated to c.1200 by Stalley (1987, 171). The foliage decoration, however, resembles that on the south window of Templenahoe, Ardfert, dated to c.1160. Animal head Finally among the sculpture, mention should be made of an early 13th century version, and possibly a copy, of a Romanesque motif. Carved in the space between two Gothic capitals on the south-east pier of the crossing is the mask of a small animal, open-mouthed with teeth showing, and with a plant scroll in its mouth (Fig. 4). The animal mask can be paralleled in the west of Ireland - it is used on capitals at Clonfert and Tuam, county Galway - where it dates to the later 12th century. The plant scroll in the animal's mouth is not unlike that on the ex situ capital lying at the west end of the cathedral which was described above. Painted plaster Two blocks of stone with painted plaster were recovered in 1989 when a doorway into a new sacristy was knocked through the north wall of the present, 7.28m wide, chancel. Both are now preserved in the Cathedral Library (Fig. 5; PI. CI). The larger of the two fragments, 27cm wide and 28cm high, has a painted representation of a column, with a ^----?^_____JJ^?

The capital seems to be circular and free-standing to judge by the depiction of the abacus: it appears to curve around the feature that stands on it. That feature is a small dome with a grid of lines drawn on it. These details are all outlined in black; the column, capital and small dome are painted in yellow, while the astragal and abacus are painted in green. The right side of this painted architectural feature is partly obscured by a depiction of what appears to be part of a robed figure: the robe, defined by a thick black line, is in light green, and drapes are suggested by two black lines in the top right-hand corner of the stone. On the other side of the column and capital is a broad band of dark red colour, defined on the right side by a thick, dark (green?) line. The decoration on the smaller fragment, 20cm wide and 25cm high, cannot be identified but it is comprised of two column-like features with capitals, one appearing to lean against the other. It is no coincidence that the only two instances of Romanesque fresco in Ireland are both associated with Cormac Mac Carthaig, and thus the Lismore plaster can be dated to c. 1130. The iconography of the painted plaster in the cathedral, however, remains indecipherable, and the forms and motifs that were deployed cannot be paralleled. At Cashel figures are depicted within painted arches with capitals and astragals on the walls and vault of the chancel, but the scheme is rather fragmentary. In the south-east corner of the rib-vault at Cashel one capital bears a plant motif not unlike that at Lismore. The longitudinal fluting on the column on the larger fragment is not found on any architectural member in Ireland. Lismore Castle gateway The gatebuilding of Lismore Castle, a work of the early 17th century, incorporates a two-ordered Romanesque arch (Fig. 6a, b). Its original location is uncertain. Killanin and Duignan state that it "probably stood nearby at Reilig Mhuire, alias Reilig na nEasbog" (1967, 357). The location of this cemetery - presumably the place where Cellach of Armagh chose to be buried - was given by Grattan Flood (1898, 35) as the field on the left of the avenue leading towards the castle, and he remarked that bones were found in the area during a drainage scheme in 1891. The inner order of the arch spans a width of 2.60m. Its arch is decorated with incised chevron on the extrados and with moulded chevron on the arris. Small bosses in the spandrels of the arris chevron were shaped as heads (animal and possibly also human) but are now very worn. The associated jambs have roll mouldings on both edges. The outer arch has a chamfered arris in which there are two rows of billet executed with a kerbschnitt technique. Its jambs are not original. The use of small zoomorphic or anthropomorphic motifs in the spandrels of chevrons or in the lozenges formed by two registers of chevron on the arris of an arch is a feature of the Romanesque of the Irish midlands, with the Nuns' Church at Clonmacnois, county Offaly, dating to 1166-7 (AFM), the prime example. The billet ornament points to Cormac's Chapel because the kerbschnitt technique deployed on the Lismore arch has exact parallels on the arcade responds in Cormac's Chapel (Fig. 7). Billet, executed in the same manner as on the Lismore Cathedral impost described above, appears in the same relative position on the Lismore Castle gateway as on the Killeshin portal, dating to the 1150s. The use of rows of billet on the outer order or hood-moulding of an arch is well paralleled in English contexts of the first half of the 12th century: among</page><page sequence="11">128 T. OKEEFFE Fig. 6 a Lismore Castle gateway b Lismore Castle gateway, detail</page><page sequence="12">LISMORE AND CASHEL 129 many examples one might single out the doorways at Dinton (Buckinghamshire), Wisset (Suffolk) and Stanley St Leonard (Gloucestershire); the head of a 12th century window above the present vault of the south choir aisle at Llandaff Cathedral in Cardiff also has a ring of billet combined with rosette-like discs. KlLMOLASH Little is known of this small monastery only seven miles east of Lismore, but it clearly belonged within the ambit of Lismore: Cormac Mac Cuilleanain, king of the Deisi, and the bishop and vice-abbot of Lismore, is recorded in 920 as abbot of Cell-Mo-Laise (Al). Evidence that this is an early foundation is provided by an ogham stone and two cross-slabs, all of them built into the fabric of the church (Power 1898, 90-2). The church itself is a nave and chancel structure. The former is largely 15th century, but the side walls of the chancel, which measures 5.50 by 4.40m externally, are 12th century. In each there is a round-arched window, externally chamfered and set in a wide splay. The east wall appears to be a late medieval rebuilding. The chancel arch, 2.75m wide, is of ashlar and is plain except for impost mouldings on the responds. In the north wall of the late medieval nave is a lintelled doorway with an external rebate. Set into the wall above and to the west of the lintel is a stone 33cm long and 27cm high, decorated with a rosette in low relief (Fig. 8a, 9a). The top of the stone is missing, but such is the regularity of the design that it was probably square in shape. A frame comprised of a row of small beads, each about 1cm in diameter and about 1cm apart, defines an area 22cm wide on each side. Within this is the flower, and this has inner and outer parts: twelve small mi H \d !^^k /-^x Fig. 7 Billet ornament at Cormac's Chapel (left) and Lismore Castle gateway (right)</page><page sequence="13">130 T.

O'KEEFFE petals of equal length radiate out from a central boss to form a circle 7.5cm in diameter, and twelve outer petals or leaves emerge from beneath this feature and run towards the frame, their lengths and widths adjusted to fit its square shape. Power considered this rosette 'Celtic' and suggested it might be the terminal of the arm of a cross (1898, 91) but it is a known Romanesque type with parallels in Ireland at Coole, described below, as well as on the west fa9ade of St Cronan's, Roscrea, county Tipperary, and the north portal of Cormac's Chapel (Henry 1970, pis 96,97), both early 12th century. Comparable features of the same date are common in south-west England (Stalley 1971, 71, 75). The flat, rather two-dimensional treatment of the rosette contrasts with the plasticity of the examples at Cashel, Roscrea and Coole, as well as with those in south-western England, and is more in keeping with the indigenous stone-carving tradition, which suggests it was made by native hands. The beaded surround prompts the same conclusion: beads of the Kilmolash type are not paralleled in Cormac's Chapel or at Roscrea but they are common in later Irish Romanesque contexts: they were used in southern Munster on archivolt chevrons at Aghacross (O'Keeffe 1995a, 26) and Donaghmore, county Tipperary, and on jamb columns at Clonkeen, county Limerick, and elsewhere in Ireland they are invariably found alongside Scandinavian-derived animals, as at Annaghdown, county Galway, Killaloe Cathedral, county Clare, the Nuns' Church at Clonmacnois, Killeshin and Kilmore. What date might be assigned to the Kilmolash rosette? The motif itself suggests a date as early as c.1130. The sculptural technique, which suggests a craftsman of native birth, does not preclude an early date. The beading, however, points to the middle of the century. The southern Munster churches in which beading is found - Aghacross, Clonkeen, Donaghmore - seem to be of this date: on grounds of style Clonkeen and Donaghmore are probably contemporary with Aghadoe, county Kerry, which is dated historically to 1158 (O'Keeffe 1995a, 26), and Aghacross, an isolated Romanesque church for which Clonkeen and Aghadoe are the nearest neighbours, is probably not too distant in time. Appropriately, the use of engaged columns in the deep return angles of the portals of Clonkeen, Donaghmore and Aghacross, and indeed in Lismore itself, suggests a derivation from the arrangement used at Cashel, which in turn suggests they are earlier than those portals elsewhere in Ireland in which angle rolls are used to give an illusion of depth. St Columbkilles Well, Curraghroche In Curraghroche townland, only a mile to the west of Kilmolash, is a well dedicated to St Colmcille. A century ago Buckley described the tiny well-house as wa small stone niche' in the centre of which was ka quaint head of monastic type bearing the Irish form of tonsure, carved out of grit-stone/ He considered it to be wa corbel or head from a cornice or string-course', citing as an example the cornice of Templenahoe at Ardfert, and he thought it kmust have been brought from some religious edifice' (1896, 214, note a). The head is no longer to be seen at the site. Proximity to Kilmolash strongly suggests the head came from that church. If the identification of the tonsure as Irish is correct, it is not easily explained. Mo-Chutu, the founder of Lismore, was probably a follower of the Roman dating of Easter, and the fact that he was expelled from Rahan at Easter suggests to Sanderlin that his stance on the paschal controversy differed from that of neighbouring monastic communities in the midlands (1992, 27). The dedication of the well is explained by the story in Mo-Chutu's Vita that Colum Cille predicted that the founder of Rahan would later found a monastery at Lismore (Ni Luasa 1920, 27).</page><page sequence="16">PI.

O'KEEFFE COOLE This monastery, 14 miles west of Lismore in the diocese of Cloyne, was founded by St Abban (Gwynn and Hadcock 1970,378). A tooth of St Patrick was reputedly kept as a relic here in the middle ages (Waters 1927, 53). Two churches survive here, but at a distance of 200m from each other. The larger of these ('Coole Abbey') is a nave-and-chancel building, of which the nave, measuring 10.65m by 7.46m internally, was the primary stone building. It has fragmentary remains of a Romanesque doorway (two roll-moulded jambs) and antae. An ex situ fragment of a Romanesque impost with a row of spherical bosses in the chamfer was recorded in 1990 but can no longer be seen at the site. The chancel, 6.70m by 5.65m internally, is an addition, probably of the 13th century; flat discs are carved on one of the stones used in the east jamb of the doorway in the south wall of the chancel, and this stone may have been re-used from the Romanesque church. High on the south end of the exterior of the east gable and not noticed by Power in his otherwise thorough discussion (1919) is a stone on which a rosette is carved in relief (Fig. 8b, 9b). It is clearly not in original position but is one of a number of architectural fragments incorporated in the wall. In both its three-dimensional quality and its rings of inner and outer petals this rosette is very much like those in Cormac's Chapel and Roscrea, and should be dated to the period around 1130. Beneath it is another stone which may bear a very defaced rosette. Discussion The pre-1150 material which can be identified with confidence in this corpus from Lismore and its environs is the wall painting in Lismore, which is paralleled at Cormac's Chapel, and the Coole rosette with its very strong parallels in Cashel and Roscrea. The other Lismore remains are not so easily dated. Notwithstanding the impost which has billet suggesting an early date and bosses which suggest a date post-1150, it is very tempting =====:::-=E^__ J^ CO CASHEL ^.

Fig. 10 Map of early Romanesque churches in Munster</page><page sequence="18">LISMORE AND CASHEL 135 to attribute the gateway of Lismore Castle to Cormac mac Carthaig's building activity: the execution of its billet is identical to that on the responds of the arcades inside Cormac's Chapel, and the documented building of churches in 1127 provides a context in which to place the arch. It is not unreasonable to link the rosettes of Kilmolash and Coole to Lismore, either as products of a workshop there or, more likely, as motifs copied from examples at Lismore. If the date of the Kilmolash rosette is accepted as mid-12th century it seems to be of little value to the debate on Lismore's place in the early history of the Irish Romanesque, but its very presence so close to Lismore suggests that this motif was well-known in the lower Blackwater valley and enhances the view that the Coole rosette, evidently a pre-1140 type, was also a product of the Lismore workshop or of a Lismore stone-carver. This identification of material of early 12th century date from Lismore and Coole is important because it increases the number of securely dated pre-1150 sites from five (Cashel, Ardfert, Roscrea, Kilmalkedar and Cork) to seven, and it further underlines Munster's claim to be the cradle of the Irish Romanesque; even though Kilmolash may fall outside the pre-1150 bracket, its stylistic affinities are in that period (Fig. 10). These items of early Romanesque sculpture in Lismore and its vicinity affect the model de Paor offered in 1967 because they occupy the same chronological frame and stylistic horizon as the Romanesque of Cormac's Chapel and consequently none of them can be explained as being derived from it. If we maintain the orthodox view which holds that all Irish Romanesque churches are later than 1134, the completion date of Cormac's Chapel, we must entertain the possibility that the earliest stylistic ideas to shape the Irish Romanesque disseminated from Lismore as well as from Cashel. The evidence in Lismore and its environs is so fragmentary that little can be deduced directly from it, but its mere existence does at least cause us to look again at the relationship between Cormac's Chapel and other monuments, specifically Kilmalkedar, Ardfert Cathedral and Roscrea, which both Leask and de Paor attributed to direct influence from Cormac's Chapel. Are there elements in these churches that cannot be explained by reference to Cashel but which might reflect direct or indirect influence from another Irish source such as Lismore? Conversely, are there elements in Cormac's Chapel that cannot be explained as having been imported from the Romanesque world outside Ireland? We might begin this enquiry with Cormac Mac Carthaig himself, a man who, through patronage exercised at Cashel and Lismore, may claim to be the adoptive father of Romanesque architecture in Ireland. Cormac Mac Carthaig, a Romanesque patron Cormac's active patronage of architecture was acknowledged in an obituary in 1138 wherein he is described as 'Bishop of the kings of Ireland for bestowal of jewels and wealth upon the clergy and church, an improver of territories and churches' (AFM). Although his episcopal status may be queried (Byrne 1973, 213), the obit dovetails nicely with the impression of him garnered from two other sources, both dating to a decade after his death. One, the mid-12th century Visio Tnugdali, the vision of the otherworld of a knight of Cashel which was written by a Brother Marcus at Ratisbon (Regensburg, Bavaria) in 1149, has Cormac appear as an enthroned king 'clothed in garments that not even himself nor any king on earth could ever wear' (Picard and de Pontfarcy 1989, 144-5). The other, St Bernard's Vita S. Malachiae, written 1148-9, gives an impression of the king in a description of the foundation of Malachy's ill-fated monasterium Ibracense:</page><page sequence="19">136 T. O'KEEFFE Many beasts were immediately brought for the use of the brothers: much gold and silver was also supplied with royal munificence for the expense of the building. The king himself came in and went out with them, busy and ready to serve: in attire a king, but in mind a disciple of Malachy (III, 18 (12): Lawlor 1920, 41). These posthumous images complement to a degree the image of Cellachan in Caithreim Chellachdin Chaisil, a biography commissioned by Cormac of his 10th century predecessor which, 6 Corrain has argued, was clearly intended as a glorification of the Eoganachta, among them Cormac himself (1974, 60). The account was put together between 1127 and 1134 (6 Corrain 1974, 57) and specifically between 1128 and 1131 perhaps (Jefferies 1983, 87; 97 nl3), in which case it would seem to be contemporary with the building of Cormac's Chapel. The two creations, one literary, the other architectural, are certainly not unrelated. Although it may have been served by a Benedictine community from the Schottenkloster in Ratisbon with which Cashel had well-documented connections (Breatnach 1977; 1980; O Riain Raedel 1984), Cormac's new foundation, unique among Irish churches in being known by its patron's name since the middle ages, was not simply a monastic church. It was a Royal Chapel. The arched tomb recess in the exterior wall immediately east of the great north portal (Fig. 11) is evidence that the chapel was less a dynastic church than its patron's private chapel. An integral part of the building's architecture, this has been known as the founder's tomb since at least the 17th century, as Bradley has documented (1984,16-7), and no provision was made in the layout of the building for the burial of any of Cormac's successors. That the chapel probably had a Benedictine community does not affect this interpretation: churches designed with their patrons' burial in mind were generally monastic (Colvin 1991, 138). Although analysis of the paintings in Cormac's Chapel lies outside the scope of this paper, the clear characterisation of Cormac as Solomon in the Visio Tnugdali (Picard and de Pontfarcy 1989, 144-5) might well have been reflected in the painted images. Crotty has suggested that the figures in the vault cell nearest the chancel arch represent Solomon and Sheba (1988, 157). Cormac, even as a living king, might well have been equated with Solomon in the iconographic programme: Nichols has discussed how models of Old Testament kingship were communicated through the portraits of contemporary enthroned rulers in the early middle ages (1983, 85-6). Indeed, Cormac Mac Airt, a legendary king associated with Tara in the 3rd century, was also equated with Solomon in the early historic consciousness, and the description in the Dindshenchas of his Teach Miodchurta (the 'Banqueting Hall') at Tara was based on that of Solomon's Temple in the Book of Kings (Byrne 1973, 65). It might be worth noting in this regard that Solomon is featured in the sculptural programme at Ardmore (O'Keeffe 1992,100-1), a monastery and erstwhile diocesan centre connected with Cashel by the Rian Bo Phadraig, an ancient routeway which actually ran through Lismore (Power 1895; Sanderlin 1992, 29). St Bernard's words on monasterium Ibracense indicate that Cormac was physically involved in the building of the church he was sponsoring for Malachy's community. This may be an exceptional instance of a patron contributing his physical energy to a project; if apocryphal, it is a striking metaphor for his respect for Malachy and commitment to Malachy's mission. Cormac's contribution to his own chapel on the Rock would have been cerebral rather than manual. As patron, he would have been largely responsible for the conception of its design: the form of the building is so 'exotic', to use Leask's word (1955, 114), that it is absolutely inconceivable that its patron did not have an input.</page><page sequence="20">LISMORE AND CASHEL 137 izQ jE3| &lt;S| ?3| |H B. kj^ ^^^^^||||||||||||^^ Fig. 11 North portal of Cormac's Chapel, Cashel</page><page sequence="21">138 T. O'KEEFFE Patrons like Cormac were less concerned with the nuts and bolts of architecture than with the symbolism or iconography embodied within that architecture, and medieval masons were challenged to translate a patron's brief into visual forms (Kostof 1977, 84; Kidson 1987,1-2). Cormac's church was, by Irish standards in particular, an astonishing melange of forms and concepts, as is discussed below. Although Cormac's patronage accounts for the building of Romanesque churches at Lismore and for the use of frescoes in at least one, the actual architecture of at least one of the Lismore churches seems not to have been identical to that at Cashel. The only clue we have is the gateway into Lismore Castle. This would have served originally as an archway into a chancel or, less likely, an eastern transept chapel, and the contrast with the form and detail of the chancel arch at Cormac's Chapel is striking. The relative chronology of the architecture may be pertinent to understanding these apparent differences. The annals do not tell us whether the 'building' of the churches at Lismore was begun when Cormac was there for part of 1127, or whether it was a gift to the monastery after he had returned to Cashel, but whatever the case, the church-building projects under his patronage at Cashel and Lismore were running simultaneously. Therefore we can be confident that at least two Romanesque stone-carving workshops were in operation independently around 1127, with the Coole and, later, the Kilmolash rosettes being associated with that at Lismore. If rosettes and motifs such as billet are common to both the Cashel and Lismore workshops it is no less than we might expect given that the Irish church, through its contacts with England, had access to a particular repertoire, but in view of the timing of the building projects no movement of craftsmen can be used to explain their presence at both sites. Significantly, Cormac established a house of Augustinian canons in Cork after 1134, subsequent to the consecration of his chapel in Cashel, and the only surviving fragments of this foundation (Bradley and King 1985) suggest that craftsmen, freed from their task at the Desmond capital, actually worked in Cork. It might be relevant also that Cormac himself was on hand for much of the time that the chapel at Cashel was being built, and he seems also to have regularly been at monasterium Ibracense since St Bernard tells us that he 'came in and went out' with Malachy's brethern as they built their church in the late 1120s or early 1130s; indeed, that factor suggests that the monastery was not in Kerry as was suggested by O'Hanlon (1859, 55), Lynch (1908, 159) and Lawlor (1920, 40), but near Cashel (Gwynn 1992, 208). Cormac, however, would not have been in Lismore for the building of the churches, except perhaps for an occasional, undocumented, visit. Cormac's Chapel and its sources Cashel was the site in 1101 of the first great reforming synod, and Muirchertach Ua Briain (who died at Lismore in 1119) marked the occasion by granting the Rock, the ancient citadel of the kings of Munster, to the church (O'Keeffe 1995c, 157-9). If the momentous events of 1101 did not precipitate the building of a new church, Cashel's elevation in 1111 to the status of archbishopric, thus giving it the same relationship to the primatial see of Armagh as York had to Canterbury in the contemporary English church (Watt 1970, 1, 13), almost certainly did. The first cathedral at Cashel, a stone church which may have replaced an earlier timber church (Hodkinson 1994, 173-4), was located where the choir of the present Gothic cathedral stands, as Stalley has demonstrated (1985, 8), and was as much as two decades old when Cormac's Chapel was erected in 1127. The Round Tower was almost certainly built at the same time as the cathedral to judge by its location and by the orientation of its doorway relative to the cathedral site, and not least by its stone fabric. In 1169 Domnall Mor Ua Briain rebuilt the cathedral (Leask 1960, 89-93), and</page><page sequence="22">LISMORE AND CASHEL 139 while there is no record of alterations in the intervening seven decades, some may have been made. Some ex situ Romanesque fragments preserved at Cashel may conceivably come from the early cathedral but are not necessarily from its earliest 12th century phase. In any case, the architectural detail of the first cathedral may have been similar to that in the Round Tower, the round-arched and architraved doorway of which clearly belongs in an architectural tradition of the 11th century (O'Keeffe forthcoming). Before reassessing Cormac Chapel's influence in the light of the Lismore evidence, it might be appropriate here to attempt to elucidate its own source. Stalley, in the most comprehensive analysis of the Chapel's architectural and sculptural pedigree to date, pointed out that the high-pitched stone roof appears to be a native contribution (1981, 62). Irish stone roofs are most frequently found associated with barrel-vaulted interiors, as at Cashel; St Macdara's Church (county Galway), and St Lua's Church at Killaloe (county Clare) are rare examples of stone roofs without vault support inside. Cormac's Chapel's nave is one of a number of barrel-vaulted structures in Ireland with an upper chamber, and among its parallels are St Kevin's 'Kitchen' at Glendalough (county Wicklow), St Columb's 'House' at Kells (county Meath), St Flannan's Oratory at Killaloe (county Clare), Rahan (county Offaly), and St Doulagh's (county Dublin). The origin of this type of structure is uncertain. Henry (1970, 150) recognised that the vault itself was an importation, not an indigenous development out of Gallarus-type structures as Leask thought (1955, 27-41), and she argued a chronology that began before Cormac's Chapel was built and has Kells and Glendalough at its beginning. Here the eaves of the stone roofs are roughly horizontal with the springing of the vaults inside, so the stone roofs are effectively the exteriors of the vault, and might be seen in each case as a by-product of the desire to have an interior vault. In place of the solid masonry between the crown of the vault and the apex of the roof was a small chamber, and this acted in each case to reduce the weight bearing down on the vault. Thus it might be said that these churches are two-storeyed by accident. Rahan and the nave of Cormac's Chapel represent the other end of the spectrum, with two-storey formats that are quite deliberately planned. Here the side walls which bear the roof do not stop at the level of the springing of the main vaults but higher up, and so the main vault and the stone roof are physically independent of each other. With the technology to erect a barrel-vault and yet carry its supporting walls upwards, there was no need for a stone roof, and so the erection of stone roofs and the upper vaults in both Cashel and Rahan clearly represent design choices. The doors and windows of Kells and Glendalough indicate a pre-Romanesque date, or at least a date prior to the arrival of Romanesque sculptural motifs; Leask considered the Kells building to be as early as the early 9th century (1955, 33) and radiocarbon dating of its mortar would seem to support his claim (Berger 1992, 882). Notwithstanding the scientific dating, one cannot exclude the possibility that the barrel vaults in these churches came to Ireland in the 11th century from an early Romanesque tradition overseas, but that they were not accompanied to Ireland by chevron or roll mouldings. Cashel and Rahan, on the other hand, are firmly within the 12th century 'decorated' Romanesque milieu. Thus it can be argued that Cashel's basic conception has antecedents in an architectural tradition already present in Ireland in 1127. The towers flanking the east end of the Cashel nave suggest, however, a link with Germany, which is not surprising given the connection with Regensburg and the recorded travels of Irish monks from there to Cashel. Moreover, kings of Munster, who were proclaimed in Cormac's Chapel, were chosen in the same manner as German emperors were chosen (Byrne 1973, 191), and it would appear from the evidence of Caithreim</page><page sequence="23">140 T. O'KEEFFE Chellachdin Chaisil that the actual inauguration ceremonies themselves were based on the German model (6 Corrain 1974, 69). The church of St James in Regensburg has towers over the east ends of the aisles, flanking the choir, and viewed from the east the Regensburg format resembles somewhat that at Cashel. Other southern German churches have similar towers (Haas and Pfistermeister 1987, passim). In the Rhineland square towers project north and south from the junction of the choir and apse at Bonn Munster, and at St Gereon and St Severin, both in Cologne, while at Boppard the towers are in transeptal positions (Kubach and Verbeek 1976,111,127,536,597). The Cathedral at Speyer has towers tucked in between the transepts and the apse, and flanking the barrel-vaulted straight bays of the choir (von Winterfeld 1993, 56; PI. 10, 18). The small flat-ended apse which is a feature of Cormac's Chapel has parallels in the Rhineland at, for example, Luttich and Essen Munster (Kubach and Verbeek 1976, 271, 702), and at Murbach in Alsace, where they combine with transeptal towers to give a massing effect similar to that in Cashel (Kubach 1975, 174). Despite these German connections and parallels, the Chapel's Romanesque content is most likely to have come from the Romanesque tradition of south-west England, as Stalley discussed (1981). One might add to his analysis of the Chapel's sculpture the use of continuous roll mouldings in the chancel; this is a feature which was used in buildings associated with Roger of Salisbury (King 1986, 36, nl2) and also at Gloucester (Wilson 1985, 58) but was extremely rare outside this area. In south-west England there was a fashion for constructing towers of German type in transeptal positions, as at Exeter. The south-west was also an area with rib-vaulting from an early date (Bony 1983, Fig.12), and it was the only part of England in which there was apparently a fashion, inspired perhaps by contacts with western France, for erecting barrel vaults over the main spans of great churches, as at Gloucester, Tewkesbury and Pershore Abbeys (McAleer 1982, 555-7; 559-60; Thurlby 1985); the original Romanesque vaults at these sites have been destroyed. Stalley drew particular attention to the church of Ewenny, a Premonstratensian priory in South Wales, effectively the western fringe of the West Country (1981, 64). The east end there follows the Cistercian plan and its choir is roofed with a combination of a rib vault and a barrel vault and transverse arches; the ribs were used for the easternmost cells of the vault where they covered the high altar (Thurlby 1988), a scheme which parallels the use of the rib in the chancel at Cashel. If the sculpture of Cormac's Chapel can be traced to the West Country, there is a case for tracing its vaulting scheme to the same area and specifically to a church such as Ewenny. How do we reconcile the suggestion that Cashel's vaulting originated in the West Country with the evidence outlined above for barrel-vaulted structures of the type represented at Cashel actually having pre-1127 antecedents in Ireland? This is the single most difficult aspect of the Chapel's architectural pedigree to disentangle, but the suggestion offered here is that while the two-storeyed, barrel-vaulted and stone-roofed form deployed in Cormac's Chapel's nave was in response to an architectural tradition already present in Ireland before 1127, the use of transverse arches on the barrel vault and of a rib vault in the chancel suggest that the lower storey was designed with an eye on a work of English architecture, rather than on'Kells and Glendalough. The Romanesque vaults in all the great churches of the Bristol area having been destroyed, an actual source for Cormac's Chapel cannot be isolated. Given their radically different plan concepts, Ewenny is not likely to have been kan important source for the design' of Cormac's Chapel, as Stalley has suggested (1981, 80). Rather, the builders of both churches, one following the Cistercian model and the other following the traditional Irish nave-and-chancel model, seem to have</page><page sequence="24">LISMORE AND CASHEL 141 adopted to their particular circumstances the roofing scheme familiar to them from one or more of the great churches in the West Country. Differences in the profiles of their ribs (Ewenny has twin rolls, Cashel a single roll) and in the orientation of the responds supporting those ribs (the Ewenny responds face diagonally across the sanctuary, those at Cashel are oriented along the side walls of the chancel), suggest the builders of both churches were not even imitating the same building (Fig. 12). The use of seven transverse arches (including those abutting the end walls) along Cashel's barrel vault is more than was actually needed to support the vault, suggesting that its builder took as his model a church of large size which had its sanctuary or apse roofed with rib-vaulting and its choir roofed with a barrel vault that had transverse arches stationed at regular intervals and possibly tied into the articulation of the side walls. In the search for an English source for Cormac's Chapel, two places at opposite ends of the West Country, Old Sarum and Hereford, merit special attention. The former was the site of the original cathedral of Salisbury, built in 1075 (Pevsner and Metcalf 1985a, 262; Gem 1990), and while nothing remains above foundation level, a link with Cashel, and indeed with Coole, can be posited on the basis of the decorative rosettes which survive from the site (Stalley 1971, PI. XIX 3); in King's view many of the features of Old Sarum were actually copied at Cashel (1986,33). The shallow, flat-ended, apsidal projection built at the east end of Old Sarum in the 12th century might be compared to that at Cashel (King 1986, 31), although a plan of the site prepared during the excavation shortly before 1914 leaves open the question of the shape of the apse's interior (Gem 1990, Pl.l); there may have been a curving wall internally. Clapham (1934, 22) suggested that towers stood above the transepts of late 11th century Old Sarum Cathedral which would again point to Cashel, but his argument seems to be based, as Gem has pointed out (1990, 12), on a misunderstanding of the evidence. The Romanesque buildings at Hereford may be more important in the context of Cormac's Chapel. Hereford Cathedral is one of the sites in the West Country that had transeptal towers (now destroyed) similar to those in German churches, and it may be significant that the bishop of the diocese of Hereford between 1079 and 1095, Robert, was from Lorraine (Gem 1986; Pevsner and Metcalf 1985b, 158). Even more important than the cathedral was the small chapel - the so-called Bishop's Chapel - which Robert built beside the cathedral. This is now destroyed but its location to the south-west of the latter's choir is known, and drawings made by the 18th century antiquary William Stukeley record that it had a two-storeyed superstructure (Gem 1986). The conceptual and iconographic source of the Bishop's Chapel was, according to William of Malmesbury's Gesta Pontificum, the basilica at Aachen (Wilson 1985; Gem 1986). For its formal parallels one might look to the doppelkappellen that were especially popular in secular and episcopal castles and palaces in the imperial territories of the Germanic world (Kubach 1975, 366, 378); included among them is the chapel of St Gothard at Mainz Cathedral, built in the early 1100s by Archbishop Arnold I as a place for his burial (Gem 1986, 90-2). The two-storeyed superstructure employed in Cashel differs from Hereford and the German doppelkapellen in many details, not least in having its lower storey as the only clearly defined liturgical area, and in any case its genesis may lie in experiments conducted in Ireland with the stone roof and the vault, as was discussed above. Nonetheless, it might be significant to note that Cormac's Chapel was erected in an episcopal complex occupying the site of a secular citadel, which is the sort of context in which doppelkapellen are found in central Europe, and that the inauguration ceremony conducted within was of German origin.

Cashel, Lismore and the early Romanesque in Munster The assembly that gathered for the consecration of Cormac's Chapel in 1134 doubtless included some who had travelled overseas, members of the Ratisbon community among them, and they are unlikely to have seen anything quite like it. The Cashel masons, a number of whom were almost certainly from England, might have moved on to new pastures in Ireland; some at least seem to have found more employment under Cormac's patronage in Cork, but nothing is known of them thereafter. The lack of buildings closely comparable to Cormac's Chapel does not mean that masons from the Cashel workshop were no longer in circulation but rather that other Irish patrons were more limited than Cormac in their resources and ambition, or that they recognised Cormac's Chapel as a building whose particular function and iconography was not appropriate for replication. It is as a repository of Romanesque architectonic forms and sculptural motifs that Cormac's Chapel would have been most instrumental in the development of a native Romanesque</page><page sequence="27">144 t. O'KEEFFE tradition. Apart from the ubiquitous chevron, however, few of the sculptural motifs reappear in Irish work, the capital and base types did not enter the repertoire of the Irish Romanesque, and the very elaborate mouldings on the chancel arch were not repeated. Regarding its architecture, de Paor makes an elaborate case for the Irish pedimented portals having their genesis in the Cashel north portal, but this view has been challenged (O'Keeffe 1991; 1995b). The tympana are an integral part of the Cashel doorways, but were only found again in Kilmalkedar and Aghadoe (Rynne 1981), and Donaghmore, county Tipperary. The side wall doors at Cashel did not replace west wall doors as the fashionable points of entrance in the 12th century. The rib vault makes no further appearance in Ireland until the end of the century at the earliest, except for a possible example at Kilsheelan, county Tipperary. The barrel vault with transverse arches only appears again in St Mary's in Ferns, county Wexford. The twin towers disappear completely, although the largest of the churches at Rahan had small chambers in the same position. The three churches identified by Leask (1955), de Paor (1967) and Henry (1970) as the closest relatives of Cormac's Chapel were Kilmalkedar, Ardfert and Roscrea, and given that elements of the native architectural tradition are present in two of them, Kilmalkedar and Roscrea, they appear to bridge the gap between the imported Romanesque of the Chapel and the 'Hibernicised' Romanesque of the midlands in the middle and late 12th century. Kilmalkedar, located on the Dingle peninsula, the extreme west end of the kingdom of Desmond, is certainly Cormac's Chapel's closest relative: it had a row of colonnaded recesses along its walls not unlike the supports of the transverse arches at Cashel, it has a typanum on its west portal, and it had a small square-ended altar projection prior to the building (early in its history) of the present chancel. Sculptural details in Kilmalkedar, especially on the chancel arch, point clearly to Cashel. The antae and the batter on both the fa$ade and the west portal are the clearest references to native Irish craftsmanship at Kilmalkedar (O'Keeffe forthcoming). St Cronan's church at Roscrea and Ardfert Cathedral have been linked with Cormac's Chapel by virtue of their arcuated fa9ades and sculptural details (Leask 1955, 124-6; de Paor 1967, 134-5; Henry 1970, 176). There are clear similarities in the types of chevron used in Ardfert Cathedral and Cormac's Chapel, and the decoration on the upright dividing the southern bays of the Ardfert facade can be paralleled on one of the uprights behind the site of the altar at Cashel. Moreover, billet ornament is only used in Ardfert in the chamfers of the imposts of arches, and its section is semi-cylindrical; where billet is used on horizontal surfaces in Cormac's Chapel, the imposts of arches and the stone course behind the altar, it is also semi-cylindrical in section. These are significant similarities between Ardfert and Cashel and they reflect close connections. Rosettes provide the most pertinent link between the sculptural repertoires at Roscrea and Cashel. Four examples are used on the north portal at Cashel while Roscrea has nine much-decayed examples, two flanking the pediment figure, five in the shape of a cross in the centre of the fa$ade, and a further two higher up in the rebuilt part of the fa$ade at the same horizontal level. Significantly, the rosettes from Kilmolash and Coole now indicate that this feature was more common than once thought, and Roscrea's bond with Cashel is thus not quite so exclusive. In both Ardfert and Roscrea the facades are five-bay, the central bays in each case occupied by the doorway, with the lateral bays blind (Fig. 14). While the use at Roscrea of antae (although with Romanesque mouldings) and of pediments is a notable difference</page><page sequence="28">LISMORE AND CASHEL 145 Fig. 14 Roscrea and Ardfert Cathedral.

I ii Fig. 15 South wall elevation of Cormac's Chapel, Cashel</page><page sequence="30">LISMORE AND CASHEL 147 between them, the alternation between roll-moulded and chevron-decorated arches in the blind bays is a significant point of similarity. Of the exterior walls of Cormac's Chapel it is the south wall of the nave that is arcuated, but it has only four bays and its doorway is consequently off-centre (Fig. 15). Is it the source of the Ardfert and Roscrea facade schemes? It seems unlikely. These fa9ades are more closely related to each other in architectural conception than either one of them is to the south wall of Cormac's Chapel. Moreover, the south-facing elevation was not the principal elevation of the Chapel, and given that a fa9ade was the front of a church, the face it presented to the outside world, the builders of Roscrea and Ardfert are not likely to have based their facade schemes on what was essentially the rear of Cormac's Chapel (O'Keeffe 1991, 363). Moreover, de Paor's view of the Roscrea pedimented portal as a 'simplified' version of the pedimented north portal at Cashel (1967,137) cannot be sustained (O'Keeffe 1991, 361). Indeed, the statuesque figure in the pediment at Roscrea conforms to a type widely distributed in time and space: examples range from Anglo-Saxon Monkwearmouth (Taylor and Taylor 1965, 434) to Romanesque St Nicolas de Brem in western France (Dillange 1976, Pis 7-12), a church for which an Irish connection has even been suggested (Lamberton 1979, 83-8). Stalley (1971, 79) drew attention to the Romanesque example at Lullington in Somerset where a seated majestas figure is flanked by rosettes as is the figure at Roscrea, and suggested a direct link between the two sites, thus by-passing Cashel. The Ardfert Cathedral facade is 'purer' than the Roscrea fa9ade in that it has no reference to the native, pre-Romanesque architectural tradition, and while it is not necessarily the earlier of the two, it might reflect the source of the design more faithfully. Despite the English origin of so much of the decoration of these fa9ades, the only comparable example in England of a five-bay arcuated fa9ade seems to be at Lindisfarne in Northumberland, built about 1130 (McAleer 1983, 614). One possibility is that the five-bay format is of Continental, particularly French, origin: five bays are found, for example, at St-Paul-de-Varax in Ain. If the idea came from the Continent, Ardfert is more likely to have been the Irish site at which it was first executed, since it is located close to the Shannon estuary in the south-west of the country. There is no English parallel known to the writer for the type of diaper work in arcades flanking a portal but, as Harbison noted (Harbison, Potterton and Sheehy 1978,83), this device is found in western France, as at Echaillais in Saintonge (Eygun 1979, PI. 114). It may be pertinent to note that an animal-head voussoir, a detail of probable French origin (Henry and Zarnecki 1958), is preserved in the re-built walling of Templenahoe at Ardfert, and probably came from the cathedral originally. Roscrea was not designated an episcopal centre in 1111 but it had a brief existence as an independent bishopric in the 12th century (Gwynn and Gleeson 1962, 62, 123, 128-9; Gwynn 1992, 183-4, 238-9). The site of a monastery founded by St Cronan in the 7th century, Roscrea would have been a natural choice for the centre of a diocese embracing Eile Ui Fogarta and Eile Ui Cherbail, but under the influence of Muirchertach Ua Briain the former was assigned to the diocese of Cashel and the latter, in which Roscrea was located, was assigned to Killaloe. When Dalcassian power weakened after the death of Muirchertach in 1119, Roscrea, with Scattery (Inis Cathaig) and possibly also Kilfenora, asserted itself as a diocese independent of Killaloe, and its claim was strong enough for Cardinal Paparo to name it as one of the dioceses in the province of Cashel at the Synod of Kells in 1152. How long it took Roscrea to claim its independence following Muirchertach's death is a matter of conjecture. Only two bishops of Roscrea are recorded, Ua Cuanain, who died in 1161 (AFM) and Ua Cerbail, who died in Lismore</page><page sequence="31">148 T. O'KEEFFE in 1168 (Al), but diocesan status was doubtless claimed at a much earlier date. Gwynn suggests the movement for independence began shortly after 1119, pointing out that the sequence of short-lived abbots or coarbs recorded in the annals between 1127 and 1134 suggests that the monastery was in a state of crisis, and that the killing of one of these monastic officials, Mac Conaegaig Ua Maelguirm, airchinnech of Roscrea, by the men of Eile in 1127, may have been precipitated by his support of the Dalcassian connection in the face of Roscrea's quest for diocesan independence (Gwynn and Gleeson 1962, 61-2). Dalcassian power was largely restored under Domnall Mor Ua Briain, king (and prolific church-builder) from 1168 to 1194, and the new dioceses again disappeared. The present St Cronan's church at Roscrea was unquestionably erected to serve as a cathedral church; indeed, its Romanesque fa9ade was intended to articulate Roscrea's new diocesan identity. It is likely that the preceding church, that with which the Round Tower at Roscrea was associated, was simply cleared away. Like Roscrea, Ardfert was not chosen as a diocesan centre in 1111. The diocese of Kerry or West Munster (Iarmuma) had its cathedral at Ratass (Raith Maighe Deisceirt), located at the edge of modern Tralee, but the death of a bishop of Ardfert in 1117 (AFM) suggests that Ardfert had assumed primacy soon after Raith Bressail, and Gwynn and Hadcock (1970, 95) suggest that the destruction of Ardfert shortly before 1111 explains why it was initially passed over. Unlike Roscrea, it survived as diocesan centre through the middle ages, and its original Romanesque cathedral was consumed within a Gothic cathedral after the arrival of the Normans. The acquisition of diocesan status, albeit briefly and spuriously in one case, in the decade after other places had been chosen by the assembly at Raith Bressail is an historical context for the use of five-bay fa9ades at Roscrea and Ardfert exclusively, and it may provide an indication of date. The churches might have been newly erected very soon after bishops were established at the end of the 1110s, in which case their construction may well have begun as early as the 1120s. One might wonder if the sculptural similarities between Cashel and Ardfert are a result of ideas, and possibly even craftsmen, travelling from Kerry eastwards, rather than from Cashel westwards. Architectural differences between Ardfert Cathedral and Kilmalkedar, only 30 miles apart by a land route, may reflect, on the other hand, the building of the latter after Cormac mac Carthaig came to power in Munster. Lismore and Kerry If more material survived at Lismore we might recognise it as a closer relative to Ardfert Cathedral than Cormac's Chapel. Lismore's connections with Kerry are well documented. Mo-Chutu, the monastery's founder in the 7th century, was from Kerry (Sanderlin 1992, 27) and abbots of Lismore were drawn from the Ciarraige (Power 1914,117). Gille Criost Ua Conairche, the Cistercian monk who was bishop of Lismore and papal legate from 1152 to 1179, was from Kerry, and on his retirement he moved to Odorney, a Cistercian house near Ardfert, where he died in 1186 (Gwynn 1992, 144). The death of a namesake, Domnall Ua Connairche, bishop of Ardfert, is also recorded in 1193 (Al). Entries in the Annals of Inisfalien relating to the period 1092-1130 suggest the annals were at Lismore, and from there the collection seems to have been brought west to Inisfallen itself (Al, xxix), and architectural and sculptural ideas may also have travelled between Lismore and Kerry. The impost with billet in the Cathedral is the only extant architectural feature in Lismore for which a connection with Kerry can be postulated. By virtue of the bosses</page><page sequence="32">LISMORE AND CASHEL 149 connected by scrolls, it relates to Templenahoe at Ardfert and to Aghadoe, two churches of c.1160. Unfortunately, the paucity of material from Lismore prevents a comprehensive assessment of links between it and the two other important Romanesque buildings in Kerry, the north oratory at Inisf alien and the church on Church Island near Waterville. The latter was a nave and chancel church with a four-ordered west portal, and possibly even pedimented in the view of Lynch (1908, 160). The former was a single-cell church (Romilly Allen 1892), the west portal of which relates to Clonfert, county Galway, and to the Nuns' Church at Clonmacnois in having a row of small animals in the hollow chamfers of its hood moulding; it also has an unusual type of chevron suggestive of influence from the south: each voussoir projects as a single chevron on both the extrados and intrados, rather like the cushion voussoirs that are known in Saintonge (Mendell 1940, 107). Summary The remains at Lismore may be too insubstantial a foundation on which to build a new model of the development of Irish Romanesque, but the presence of painted plaster and, at Coole, a rosette of the type found in Cashel and Roscrea, alerts us to the need to reappraise both the historical and architectural background to Cormac's Chapel, and the relationship between it and other early churches in Munster. The Chapel emerges from this analysis with its reputation as an 'exotic' creation (Leask 1955, 114) intact, but with its function and international context perhaps more clearly defined. The architecture of Ardfert Cathedral and Roscrea emerge as independent of its stylistic influence, suggesting that Cormac mac Carthaig's embracing of the Romanesque style for his royal chapel at Cashel was perhaps a less decisive event in the style's history than we previously thought. Cormac's standing as the adoptive father of the Irish Romanesque style is not entirely undermined by this, however: the mere presence of early Romanesque work in Lismore, where he built two churches around 1127, reminds us that the ideas which shaped the early development of the Irish Romanesque could have emanated from sources other than Cormac's Chapel.

It is a pleasure to record my gratitude to Dean Cecil Weekes of Lismore Cathedral for facilitating my research into the Romanesque remains in his care and for his unstinting encouragement.
