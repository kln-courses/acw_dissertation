DM 29.80 (paper). Westermann seeks to trace the form, function, and ideology of the sayings and discourses that comprise Proverbs, the biblical book perhaps least amenable to literary archaeology. His theory of development is at the same time an interpretation of the purposes of the different types of wisdom as well as an assessment of their present-day value. His central thesis is that Proverbs preserves two incompatible types of sayings from two completely different settings: early, oral proverbs on the one hand, and late, literary-didactic texts on the other. The first group - in which Westermann's real interest lies - are short, traditional sayings that originated and were transmitted orally (we can call them "adages"). Adages belong to the worldwide phenomenon of folk wisdom. Most of the proverbs in chaps. 10-21, 25-29 are of this sort, though in some cases the original folk proverb must be reconstructed by excising the awkward or banal parallel lines attached by later redactors. Adages address concrete, specific life situations. They are not meant as general assertions of principles or as formulation of abstract thoughts. They seek to guide adult members of the small community in behavior that promotes and safeguards communal well-being. The adages are based on observation and contemplation and are motivated by the desire for knowledge (p. 15). They do not speak with authority, but address the listener as an equal, bidding him to use independent judgment and to apply the principle to new situations (pp. 101-9). Such adages arose in the simple, intimate life of the agricultural village. Their imagery is drawn from the everyday life of simple people ("einfachen Menschen") (p. 75). At the center of economic life is agriculture, for (Westermann believes) the ancient Israelites were a "reines Bauernvolk" (p. 40). The Israelite adages did not originate in the schools or court, but neither do they express a Sippenethos: there is neither an interest in the clan nor any mention of the extended family or larger social units (p. 35). After the exile (and following a transitional phase) a new type of Wisdom appears, represented by the didactic poems in Proverbs 1-9, as well as a number of shorter poems and proverbs elsewhere (such as the sayings schematically contrasting the righteous and the wicked). These are didactic school texts. The speakers are pro- fessional teachers addressing youngsters authoritatively and invoking their obedience rather than appealing to their contemplation or judgment. At the latest stage come the extensive didactic poems in chaps. 1-9. Wisdom is now abstract and objectified. The earlier interest in human nature has sharply receded (pp. 130). The Wisdom writings outside Proverbs, with their "Mischformen" and "Abwand- lungen,' belong to the "Nachgeschichte" (p. 123). Yet the simple proverb is still met with in the late Wisdom writings (p. 123), and both Qohelet and the book of Job direct polemics against the late wisdom, the sort represented in Proverbs 1-9. Jesus' sayings, too, draw upon the early wisdom of short, oral proverbs, not the abstract school-wisdom (p. 127). Westermann's discussion is clear and often insightful. I do, however, have some disagreements with (1) his conclusions about the social location of adages and (2) the methodology of his dating of proverbial literature. (1) Westermann's objection to the "one-sided derivation of the proverbs from</page><page sequence="2">530 Journal of Biblical Literature school wisdom" (p. 11) is quite justified. But to locate the Sitz of the great majority of short proverbs in village and agricultural life is itself one-sided and requires overemphasizing some motifs and ignoring others. The setting of most proverbs is not particularly rural. Certain trades mentioned, such as the goldsmith and messenger, have no place in the small village. On the other hand, agriculture is not foreign to city dwellers, many of whom would own or work fields near the city, and in any case the proverbial references to farming are general and require no occupational familiar- ity. Some of Westermann's arguments for a rural background depend on stereotypes of city and village life. For example, 27:21 was supposedly spoken "in einer relativ kleinen Wohnnachbarschaft" in which everyone knew everyone else and a good reputation was achieved not by wealth or connections or even by outstanding achieve- ments but by proving oneself worthy in suffering (p. 19). To the extent this adage is true, it is true everywhere. Moreover, indicative proverbs are not simply factual obser- vations; they are also assertions of hopes and values, and we cannot project a social reality from a desideratum. In fact, the adages reflect a variety of social settings. Many sayings do indeed seem to express the mundane concerns of common people (especially if we include well-to- do common people in this ill-defined group), but there is nothing essentially rural or early about such concerns. In general, the rural character is less emphatic than Westermann thinks, and the social background is closer to the well-to-do classes than to the poor. (Note, for example, that proverbs mentioning messengers speak about sending messengers, not being one. Loan guarantees are an issue for mercantile classes. Proverbs about the poor speak from the standpoint of people who have the means to harm or help them.) Another setting is the royal administration and court. Sayings about military strategy, for example, or about the king's favor and anger have little meaning for anyone but members, present or hopeful, of the royal administra- tion. Westermann's criterion of relevance, which leads him to identify the agricultural village as the setting of many adages, should apply no less to the sayings about the king, which not only make comments about him, but also suggest how to deal with his moods. Most Israelite proverbs about the king have the character of courtly flattery mixed with implicit advice, a type of wisdom with clear precedents in Egypt. Warnings against abuse of royal power (the sayings Westermann cites [p. 46] are not actually "Kritik am Kinig") also have a place in courtly wisdom, as in Merikare, 11. 70-74; 119-124 and the Babylonian "Fiirstenspiegel" The classical form-critical assumption that (as Gunkel put it) "Every ancient literary type originally belonged to a quite definite side of the national life of Israel" has led Westermann (and others) to try to squeeze all adages into a single bed. The book of Proverbs is a literate anthology of wisdom from many sources, including everyday usage (from the royal court as well as the town) and learned artistry. One seeking for the theological relevance of proverbial wisdom might consider not only "folk" origins but also the fact that the end product was a truly communal enterprise that preserved the wisdom of people of widely disparate social contexts and times. The literary artists, however, had the last word, for it was they who selected some of the adages they knew, wrote them down, arranged them, and reshaped them, while adding new sayings of their own. It is, in the end, their work and their notion of wisdom that we are reading. Very few sayings in Proverbs resemble the folk sayings identifiable in the narrative and prophetic books, and the much discussed historical</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 531 relationship between the two types is still problematic. Indeed, the relationship between oral proverbs and written wisdom is more complicated than Westermann allows. Literary proverbs may be deliberately modelled on traditional sayings-so skillfully that they cannot be distinguished from their models. Moreover, some admonitions that fit Westermann's image of oral proverbs derive from Amenemope and so must have a learned, literary origin. (Westermann believes that the parallels to Amenemope in 22:22-23:11+ 24:1-29 are just a matter of belonging to a "gemein- samen Kulturstufe"; but the arguments for dependency go far beyond thematic similarity.) (2) Westermann's dating of different types of Wisdom, though not itself unreas- onable, depends largely on qualitative judgments and flawed assumptions about literary development. He clearly prefers the sayings he considers early to those he thinks late, so much so that he cautions Christian theologians against imitating the failings of the "late, abstract wisdom" (p. 144). Westermann's notions of literary development resemble Wellhausen's schema of the religious history of Israel as a progressive slide toward rigidity and scholasticism. Symptomatic of Westermann's presuppositions about social evolution is his notion that trade became important in Israel only after the exile (p. 40), although the early Judean economy was con- siderably less urban. Westermann also reveals his proclivities in the somewhat discon- certing notion that Jesus' affiliation with the heritage of early proverbial wisdom "verbindet das Neue mit dem Alten Testament" (p. 127) - as if the "late Wisdom" were not in the OT too. Literary and ideological preferences are legitimate and can give energy and direc- tion to scholarship, but they should not become self-justifying premises. This happens, for example, when Westermann removes the second line of a couplet as secondary in order to recover the early adages that interest him. The secondary lines are iden- tified by the lame or pointless character of the parallelism, such as in the "Leerlauf" parallelism that does not advance the thought (pp. 65-66). By such means, a body of snappy folk (or folk-like) proverbs is created -Westermann would say restored- that have, not surprisingly, the aesthetic and moral qualities Westermann values and considers signs of earliness. A similar circularity leads Westermann to the remarkable assertion that the Demotic Wisdom of Onchsheshonqy, although a "late writing,' represents "einen friihen Entwicklungsstand" because it is composed of one-line, pre- dominantly indicative, sayings, collected without a principle of arrangement (pp. 110, 172). We could as well say the same of Pseudo-Phocylides, Menander, and the Hellenistic gnomologia. In fact, as Miriam Lichtheim has shown in Late Egyptian Wisdom Literature in the International Context (OBO 52; G6ttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1983)- an important work which Westermann does not mention - Onchsheshonqy's monostichs have no known forerunners in Egypt but are a form of international Hellenistic Wisdom. The "early"/"late" dichotomy, common in Bible studies, may itself be misleading, for it often suggests, and is meant to suggest, not only relative dating but also inherent qualities. "Early" is thought to connote freshness; a "Bliitezeit" is always early. Early sayings, stories, poems, etc., are relevant, vivid, rooted in life. "Late," on the other hand, suggests rigidity, abstractness, formalism, detachment from everyday life and ordinary people. (Somehow "late" never seems to imply the richness and subtlety that may come with maturity and the access to a more developed and sophisticated literary tradition.) Continuation of features outside the bounds the theory sets for</page><page sequence="4">532 Journal of Biblical Literature them are relegated to the genre's "afterlife."' The background metaphor in such a schema is the life course of an individual human, an image whose implications are irrelevant to individual works and deceptive in the case of genres. A better analogy would be the evolution of a species, which either survives by adaptation or dies out, and whose antiquity says nothing about the vitality of its members. If Proverbs 1-9 is "late" (and a postexilic dating is indeed likely) it is also early, for Jewish Wisdom Literature continues for many centuries. It includes Ben Sira, Wisdom of Solomon, and parts of other Apocryphal and Pseudepigraphical works, as well as Pirqey Avot and the Cairo Geniza Wisdom book. Rabbinical sources too quote and collect adages (examples of collections are b. B. Qam. 92a-b and b. Bik. 17a). Even the medieval Jewish Ethical Will carries on some of the forms and techniques of ancient Wisdom. These continuations of Wisdom belong to the life and history of the genre, not to something beyond it, such as the "Nachleben" (p. 121) or "Nach- geschichte,"' to which Westermann assigns all Wisdom Literature after the book of Proverbs (p. 123). Westermann is so certain that postexilic Wisdom is abstract, generalized, authoritarian, theoretical, and so on that he overlooks the vitality of Proverbs 1-9 and its subtle and vivid artistry of persuasion. Think of the lurid seduction scene in 7:6-22, the insidious enticements whispered by the gang in 1:10-14 (surely a response to a definite social situation), the romantic eroticism in the praise of marital sex in 5:15-20, the delight in detail in the example of the ant in 6:6-8, and, above all, the audacious anthropomorphism in the presentation of Lady Wisdom, who frolics like a little girl before God who (the terminology intimates) is her father. Precisely here, where Wisdom is most objectified and abstracted from specific wise actions, it becomes most lively, visual, and imaginative. None of this is allowed for in Wester- mann's caricature of "late" Wisdom. Wurzeln der Weisheit is a strong book with some weak theses. Its strengths (like those of the adages its author loves) lie in its treatment of particulars. The categories Westermann chooses for treating the proverbs illuminate the topography of this rather unwieldy biblical book. (Verse and topic indexes would have been helpful in this regard.) Even the theses regarding social location and literary development, with which I have taken issue, are argued with clarity and vigor and provoke thought on some difficult and important issues in the history and nature of Wisdom Literature. Many books that I have agreed with more have taught me less. Michael V. Fox University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706</page></plain_text>
