<plain_text><page sequence="1">Madness, Creativity and Society (Interview) Yehya El-Rakhawy Yehya Tawfik El-Rakhawy was born and educated in Cairo, Egypt. He holds undergraduate and graduate degrees in medicine from Kasr El-Aini School of Medicine, Cairo University, and is presently serving as Professor and Head of the Department of Psychiatry at the Kasr El-Aini School of Medicine, Cairo University. He is also the Senior Consultant Psychiatrist at the Dar El-Mokattam Hospital for Mental Health. Rakhawy is widely active in a number of scientific and cultural organizations and publications, including the Association of evolutionary Psychiatry and Group Work and its official journal, Man And Evolution. He has published more than 135 articles in both Arabic and English and more than twenty book-length works, ranging from psychiatric manuals to literary criticism to poetry and prose fiction. His books include a two-volume novel, Passing into Fire (1977), winner of the State Prize for Literature in 1980; The Secret of the Game (1978), a study of the use of Arabic poetry in psychotherapy; a collection of his own poetry in Arabic, The Glass House and the Snake (1983); Evolutionary Rhythmic Theory and the Basics of Psychology (1989), which outlines the basic principles of his psychobiological evolutionary theory; and Readings in Naguib Mahfouz (1990). In his work El-Rakhawy has developed a uniquely Egyptian theory and practice of psychiatry, based on the Arabic language, the Islamic tradition (especially Sufism and the concept of al-ftra), Egyptian folk traditions (folk beliefs, sayings, stories, and ballads), and the importance of harmonizing with one's "biorhythmic natural surroundings." His theory, which he calls the "evolutionary rhythmic theory," is a biologically based approach to mental health and development. The interview which follows was conducted in writing using 206 Alif 14 (1994)</page><page sequence="2">questions prepared specifically for this issue of Alif by three interviewerss Ehab E1 KharratS Ramadan Basttawicy and Jane McPherson. Ehab E1 Kharrat holds a medical degree in neuro-psychiatry and is currently the director of a drug rehabilitation center. He is a human rights activist and has published various articles in the areas of psychology, religion, literary criticism. He is also a preacher and counsellor in Kasr E1 Dobarah Evangelical Church. Ramadan Basttawicy teaches philosophy at Ain Shams University. He has written on Lukacs and Hegel and published a number of articles on philosophy, criticism and creativity. Jane McPherson is a psychotherapist and counsellor who practices privately and is affiliated with the Counselling Center at the American University in Cairo. Her interests include the treatment of addiction and the psychological consequences of child sexual abuse. Ehab El Kharrat: The names of three great creative men have been linked with psychosis or mental illness: Van Gogh was linked to schizophrenia, Nietzsche to paranoid disorder then general paresis of the insane, and Dostoevski to epilepsy (perhaps accompanied by personality changes) and possibly to the psychomotor phenomenon of temporal lobe epilepsy. In your opinion, is there any relation between creativity and madness in any of the three? If so, is the relation linked to 1) the diagnosis, 2) the nature of the disease, or 3) the dynamic psychopathology? Also on the creative level is it linked to 1) the nature of creativity, 2) its kind (painting, literature, etc.), 3) its quality, or 4) the process of creation itself ? Please elaborate. Yehya El-Rakhawy: There is a definite relation between creative activity and what has been called madness. However, I do not like to start with such a generalization. It is not a matter of a relation as much as it is a matter of the diversity of outcome of some original common phenomenon. Creativity is not necessarily associated with madness. On the other hand, it could be considered as opposite to madness. They are opposite in outcome though having common origin. Any superficial similarities or possible statistical association would not add a valuable or meaningful explanation to either of the phenomena. My thesis about such relations defines madness as an aborted and mutilated creative process and defines creation as some sort of transcendence of the madness process into a positive outcome. Each Alif 14 (1994) 207</page><page sequence="3">of the forementioned creative men needs an independent interpretation from my point of view as far as my knowledge about them permits. Before expressing my opinion about each of these mentioned creative men, let me answer your last questions first concerning the diagnosis, the nature of the disease, etc. Diagnosis, in general, represents one of the weakest points in psychiatry as a scientific discipline and as a professional practice. A diagnostic label in itself says very little about the uniqueness of any patient. Moreover, it reduces this patient to what he is not, rather than uncovering what he could be. This criticism of psychiatric diagnosis becomes more significant in the case of interpreting or reporting about a creative man or analyzing his creative product. However, such a diagnosis can help to sketch some broad outlines around the area the critic or the investigator should focus on. The term nature of the disease is not a commonly used term in psychiatric jargon. Nevertheless, it is more relevant to creation than is the diagnostic label. In spite of this fact, it is impossible to generalize in such interpretation because each individual (and more so if he is creative) has his unique nature of the disease. As for the relation to the dynamic psychopathology, this is another elaborated step although it is not a matter of dynamics as much as it is related to some other levels of psychopathology particularly the meaning of the symptom or creation (i.e. the teleological psychopathology) as well as the structural organization which is more than dynamic in the classical sense. The next group of questions about the nature of creativity, its kind, quality and the creative process can only be answered in general terms. It is not right to state that schizophrenic patients are able to produce a certain quality of creation at such level or that an epileptic is able to exhibit a certain form or cpntent in his creation. This may hold true in some arbitrary general conclusions in statistical terms but is not useful or valid in individual cases such as those mentioned in your question. Now, let me take these creative pioneers one by one, putting my own view as a working hypothesis, no more. Starting with Van Gogh as the most obvious case with a record of clearly psychotic behaviour, along with the most profound kind of formative art, the diagnosis of schizophrenia does not say anything about him. For instance, no schizophrenic patient could bear to live with the emotional vividness which characterized both Van Gogh's 208 Alif 14 ( 1994)</page><page sequence="4">creation and symptoms. Moreover, intensive, impulsive behaviour is not a characteristic symptom of schizophrenia. What is more significant is that at the phase of creation, Van Gogh's production represents one of the most mentally integrative processes which is exactly the opposite of the characteristic disorganization of schizophrenia. What then could the explanation of such extreme opposites--which are at the same time strongly related to each other--be? This could never be described in terms of some diagnostic label or symptom delineation. Changing the possible diagnosis into manic depressive or cycloid psychosis would add very little. Even the other suggested diagnosis for Van Gogh's case as epilepsy adds very little. The swing from extreme creativity as manifested by Van Gogh's creativity to the extreme detachment from reality and impulsivity reveals, on one side, an intense vital energy that needs to be unfolded to its ultimate extreme every time, and on the other side the polarity and periodical nature of his existence (which is presented here greatly magnified). This shift is between an extreme creative/integrative/formative art and impulsive/detached/disorganized behaviour. Boffi phenomena declare sudden mega-unfolding but while one is convergent unfolding, ffie other is not only divergent but disintegrative and pseudo-unfolding. Nietzsche as case is another example of a misinterpretation in terms of pseudo-science. To diagnose a case as paranoia on the basis of the presence of delusions of persecution or of grandeur is like identifying a playground as sky simply because it is covered with blue rather than green artificial grass. Nietzsche was unique and had the right to feel superior and consequently persecuted. His loneliness, his unrecognized, unappreciated production, led to a frank outcome--a psychotic decompensation that ended with Nietzsche's death in a mental hospital. This does not mean in the least that he has been insane while creating. To put it properly, Nietzsche ended in frank insanity (not necessarily paranoia) in spite of being creative and not because of being so. Nietzsche's polarity swings were not so evident as they were in the case of Van Gogh. The possibility of having general paralysis adds no more data since the type of psychosis his tertiary syphilis could induce (apart from dementia) depends on the type of personality and predisposition rather than the nature of the syphilitic infection itself. Nietzche's late blindness adds very little to the nature of his psychosis. Another important point in the history of Nietzsche is that the late onset of his psychotic decompensation could be another way to clarify some other type of relation between Alif 14 (1994) 209</page><page sequence="5">creativity and psychosis (not necessarily paranoid). This is what I call exhaustion outcome. Creation, however uniqueS superior and integrative, if not appreciated and when no adequate feed back is available to reinforce it, leads to a state in which further creation could be unilaterally augmented to higher and higher levels until a certain limit is reached when the creative person can no longer produce without receiving some kind of acknowledgement, in the sense of either criticism or appreciation. This turning point not only stops his creation but could also uncover the tragedy of emotional starvation due to loneliness. Then frank psychosis sets in. Coming now to the case of Dostoevski, the problem of the relation of epilepsy to psychosis needs to be tackled first. The recent nosologies (including the American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd edition, revised [DSM-III-R] and the Manual of the International Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death [ICD-10]) deny any direct or special relation. Epilepsy is considered like any organic etiological factor that could cause any psychiatric manifestations. This denial is related analogously to the denial of the relation of the epileptic seizure of Dostoevski to his creation. It is a disease that declares some sort of acting out of paroxysmal energy through some haphazard facilitated association. Such pseudo-scientific denial has been extended recently to deny the concept of energy as a separate dimension of human biology and existence. One cannot understand Dostoevsldi's seizures andJor creation except through adopting the concept of energy in its proper sense. Such a proper sense does not identify the concept of energy with instincts, on one hand, nor with biochemical high energy bonding on the other hand. It is more related, in biological terms, to the elan vital of Bergson. Such energy output is also equivalent to, or is another aspect of, ready to unfold organization. If such ready to unfold organization could unfold paroxysmally for a very short time, it results in the seizure activity. If the unfolding occurs periodically, periodical psychosis could set in. More chaotic and less regular ready to unfold organization could be met with in some fluctuating, remittent, disorganized, or deteriorating psychosis (schizophrenia). The third possibility is that this ready to unfold organization takes a positive development and thus superior integration is achieved. This latter mode of unfolding is neither paroxysmal nor self-limiting. Creation seems to pick up at the start of the ready to unfold Alif 14 (1994) 210</page><page sequence="6">organization and turns it on at a higher level of consciousness which enables the pursuit of creative productivity. In one of my critiques of Dostoevski's work (Brothers Karamazov, as far as I remember now), I tried to solve the apparent contradiction between his lengthy, not infrequently boring circumstantiality and his frequent paroxysmal condensation of events in a fraction of a second. This has been interpreted according to the assumption that he had been able to control a gush of creative energy and to turn it into a thread that he goes on pulling through the minute hole of a needle. At some other instance he perceives the paroxysmal gush of energy as such to enhance a qualitative turn along the development of his creative product. The two processes occur at some level of awareness which is neither fully conscious or volitional, on one hand, nor absolutely unconscious or supramaximally paroxysmal, on the other hand. To conclude, yes, there is a definite relation between creation and madness. However, this relation is not in the least a causative, simple association, or a direct similarity. Rather, it is related to the common origin of both phenomena; it is an alternating sequence which is ultimately opposite in outcome. It is least related to a diagnostic label or to psychoanalytic sublimation. It is more closely related to biological energy output, structural organization perspectives, and the biorhythmic nature of existence. All these speculations are aspects of my basic psychopathological theory "the evolutionary rhythmic theory." Ehab El Kharrat: You have done much work on creativity and madness, and in this work you have developed two concepts that I want to discuss: a) the biological vital rhythm and vital psychological pulse (systole/distole) and b) the spiral mode of psychological development and growth. Can you trace or explain the mode of development in civilizations in a similar way, relating periods of regression and progression in a certain national or cultural history with a "psycho-social rhythm"? Please explain and elaborate relating to the western civilization and to our own cultural history (Egyptian, Arab-Islamic culture). Yehya El-Rakhawy: One day I was fascinated with Plato's saying "like man like state." Now I am very hesitant about such possible individual anthropomorphism of the society or history of civilization. In principle, I believe that there is some analogous parallelism, Alif 14 (1994) 211</page><page sequence="7">especially from the biorhythmic point of view. This could extend transversely into wider circles extending into the unknown. Longitudinally, why couldn't the case be the same? Ehab El Kharrat: Perception, association of thought and development, volition, and actual behaviour are different aspects of personality. Could each of them be related to the process of the creation of art ? Explain please. Yehya El-Rakhawy: This division of mental (psychic) function into separate ones is fallacious. It is for the sake of studying, describing and, to a lesser extent, doing some sort of research. The more functions are separated, the more we are away from creation. Creation is a divergo-convergent synthetic pulsating phenomenon. When the process is aborted at the divergent stage, the mental functions appear to be separate and in cases of psychosis one starts to speak about incongruity of affect or separation of pseudo-volitional decision from the actual doing, etc. Creation is the integration of all such artificially (or temporarily) separate functions into a unity. During the process of creation you cannot tell which function is dominant or leading except as a step in a particular stage. A writer of a novel is not far away from the visual creative art, and the formative artist is writing a complete act while he is predominantly reorganizing visual perception and images. The case of a music composer is similar. The affective component in creation is not at all separable from the meaning and the form of the creative product. It is rather silly to ask a creator how he feels while creating: he is simply creating. His affect is but creation. In my thesis about the evolution of emotion (unpublished document, since 1976) I have put the evolution of emotions from the non-specific protoplasmic irritability to the meaning. Once the word is fully representative of its connotation as its objective meaning it has its aJ0fect as one and the same as its meaning without any need to describe an additional associated affect. Saying that this is a tree from a creative perspective is indicative that you are feeling the affect called tree simultaneously. Could this be an answer to your question in some way or another? Ramadan Basttawicy: The history of psychiatry in Egypt has its own specificity and seems to indicate that over the years the field has developed in more than one direction: a strictly professional one and a Alif 14 (1994) 212</page><page sequence="8">more humanistically inclined one concerned with the relationship between the field of inquiry itself and the aspirations of the Egyptian individual, whether those be social or political. How do you personally envision the history of psychiatry in this country? How would you define your own position within its various directions and tendencies? Yehya El-Rakhawy: I believe that the history of psychiatry anywhere is not the least separable from the history of the whole region or people at large. I could go still further to claim that the history of psychiatry could be taken as one of the most significant indicators for history in general. However, I could not claim that I am in a position to generalize my point of view. I have written three successive papers referring to three stages of what could be called "Egyptian Psychiatry." The last was written in 1988, extending the history into expectations for the future. By now, I can claim that the dichotomy of the chemically-minded psychiatrists (considering themselves as representative of the so-called medical model) and the biological / evolutionary-oriented group are more clearly delineated as well as further apart from each other. The latter group (the evolutionary-oriented group) also believe that they are the real representatives of both the biological model and the real medical model where medicine is essentially the art of healing (and not only the etiologically-oriented, organically interpreted mode of handling the dis-eased sufferer). Two movements have been less attractive and less popular viz. the classical psychoanalytic model and the possibly anti-psychiatric movement. As regards my own position, I could now claim that I and some of my students represent a certain holistic bio-evolutionary approach in psychiatry which is both practiced and theorized in Egypt. This is not in the least, a compromise between various disciplines (social biological and psychological), but is essentially an integrative synthetic unification of psychiatric practice as part and parcel of human progress. The word biology from this point of view keeps its original connotation as the science of life. Psychiatry is conceptualized from this aspect as the art of dealing with some specific hazards and handicaps of the progressive development of life as presented through sufferings of certain individuals asking for essentially (or mainly) medical help. The humanistic trend has not been adopted by any particular group of Egyptian psychiatrists. It has Alif 14 (1994) 213</page><page sequence="9">been considered either too idealistic (a position which was mainly included in religious psychiatry) or too anti-biological, and thus has been rejected by most psychiatrists. Ramadan Basttawicy: In your book Muqaddimah.fi al-'ilaj al-jam'i (Introduction to Group Therapy) you tried to lay the foundations for what may be called "the ground work for an Egyptian school in life and therapy." What are some of the accomplishments of this school? Does it limit itself to psychiatry or does it extend its presence to other fields in Egyptian intellectual life? Yehya El-Rakhawy: As a matter of fact, I have been taking psychiatry as some sort of special window through which I had a unique chance to investigate what we could be like (human being as presented in an Egyptian sample) at our profoundest level of existence. This attitude did not last long since I found my own self in the focus of the challenge. Through this interaction between what is me (or perhaps it is better to say what could be me ) and what my patients are (and also what they are stirring up in both of us, me and them), I found myself revising many basic values and modes of existence. When I started to establish our own approach to group therapy, such an attitude was intensified and partly theorized. This very early and small book (Introduction to Group Therapy) was but the introduction to an M. Sc. thesis in psychological medicine which I have been supervising. It was written in only a few days to recapitulate the theoretical framework of that thesis. When it was published as an independent work, I did not add a word, intentionally believing that this gush of thoughts is more representative as raw as they were. However, I discovered on one occasion that I have described this group therapy as being a revival of the dialectic of growth. This could show one aspect of the answer to your question, i.e. this kind of group therapy does extend to other aspects of our lives. To be more precise, it is not limited to Egyptian intellectual life but could extend to our life as a whole. Whether this our is limited to Egyptians or starts with what is Egyptian is yet to be considered. Ramadan Basttawicy: There was an attempt made by Dar-El Mokattum House for Mental Health, which publishes a journal entitled Al-Insan wal-Tatawur (Man and Evolution), to establish a formula that would unify different ideas and directions in the field. In 214 Alif 14 (1994)</page><page sequence="10">fact, early in its history, it had invited several writers and intellectuals to assess its accomplishments (as in the article by Yusuf Idris on the experiment of group therapy in Egypt). Does this represent the foundation for an institute? Is it a philosophy for political organization, not in ideological terms, but in terms of social psychiatry? What might be the relationship between all this and the culture of institutions? Yehya El-Rakhawy: I believe that it could be any of these or it could be none at all. Let me take some other approach. You know about something known as thinking out loud. I believe that this formula (the institute and the Journal) could be some sort of living overtly (as a declared and published document). The relation of "Dar-El Mokattum House for Mental Health" to the journal, Man and Evolution, is rather indirect. Both stem from the same origin. However, the unknown association called "The Association of Evolutionary Psychiatry and Group Work" is the official integrative organization of both. This association is the first official association in Egypt, registered in 1979. However, I have to admit that this association has not started yet its specific activity on a well-defined, large scale. "Dar El-Mokattum House" could be considered as the material representation of this association while the journal Man and Evolution is its official organ. The original goal was to have this association as the site for integrative cooperation between psychiatrists who believe in the evolutionary approach in their speciality and the lay population who could participate actively in the evolutionary march essentially through group work. The term "group work" was especially chosen to replace the term "group therapy" as well as to stress that it is an association that identifies itself mainly through work and not through intellectualization. All these ambitions have not been achieved to any considerable degree. I can conclude that neither "Dar E1 Mokattum House" nor the journal, Man and Evolution, is a philosophy for political organization, neither in ideological terms nor in terms of social psychiatry. "The Evolutionary Psychiatric Association and Group Work" could be considered as an experiential movement trying to break through the monopoly of specialization and to transcend the reductionistic methodology. Over more than one decade, this proved to be a wishful attitude rather than a practical potentiality. The relationship of all this to the culture of institutions is Alif 14 (1994) 215</page><page sequence="11">relatively poor. It is not an alternative institute. It could be an experiential sample of what could be found in a developing country that could add to the current views concerned with the human nature through two main channels: understanding madness (in evolutionary terms) and group work. The result of such experience was made available to others through publication (Man and Evolution) as well as through the qualitative results achieved via the milieu therapy experienced in "Dar El-Mokattum." The invitation and encouragement of several writers and intellectuals to assess the accomplishments of the journal Man and Evolution has gone along with a readiness to publish raw material representing the experience of both patients and practicing psychiatrists. The participating intellectuals--whether through writing, criticizing, or just reading and commenting--have added to our experience and made us continue in spite of all the practical difficulties and personal handicaps. I would like to add that all such inclinations, hypotheses, practice and theorization have been integrated in some theoretical framework which has been published mainly in my text study in psychopathology, and in another work of mine The Secret of the Game. In terms of theory, what has been called the "evolutionary rhyffimic theory" (1981) has been published in a limited number of copies. Ramadan Basttawicy: Literature cannot replace science even though both begin with and depend on the imagination. Why did you try to write your novel Al-Mashyy 'ala al-Sirat (Following the Straight Path) from a perspective that presents madness through a scientific, rather than literary, sensibility? Did you tw to give your (scientific) view of madness a literary form in order to address a larger audience? Or were you trying to makeup for the deficiencies of science by resorting to a literary medium? Yehya El-Rakhawy: The histow of writing this novel could prove to be more significant than what the novel has introduced whether to science or literature. I agree that literature cannot replace science and that it could have been more sensible to introduce my point of view about madness through scientific concepts. I have to confess that I failed to do so. This was not due to an inability to find the proper tool or scientific language, but rather this has been mainly due to an attempt to avoid expected resistance to an idea coming from a 216 Alif 14 (1994)</page><page sequence="12">developing country (setting aside the reductionistic measures used in evaluation). I believed then that my discourse should be directed primarily to whom it may concern rather than being limited to practicing specialists or a limited scientific society. I wrote the novel not only to introduce my point of view on madness but also, and perhaps more essentially, to uncover the problem of the search for God along the march of evolution as uncovered through madness. This again, in our culture, could be presented neither through scientific concepts nor through the direct point of view of an independent theory or philosophy. As regards the last two questions, the answer is yes. I am rather obsessed by two main issues; I have no way of putting them aside. The first is the methodological shortcomings to the understanding of human nature (including madness, or essentially through madness), and the second is related to language as a biological body. My relation to Arabic language in particular and the implication of such a relation for my understanding of my religion, my patients and myself has influenced my attitude towards the method of study of madness and man. One outcome of such attitude was using literature as a tool to convey a message that I failed to do both in English (the supposed scientific language in my training and writing in psychiatry) and through the classical so-called scientific dominant methodological disciplines. Under the title of the first volume of that novel I added some misleading words describing the work as a scientific novel. Many of the critics and novelists thought at first glance that it is a sort of science fiction. It proved to be neither scientific in the proper sense nor related to science fiction. One of the few crztical studies which addressed it (by Y. El-Sharouny) categorized it as some sort of a philosophical novel. Others have advised me to omit this description (scientific novel) in the second edition which has not yet appeared. The title of this two-volume novel was selected intentionally to refer to the message I intended to convey through this work. The title of the whole novel signifies Passing into Fire (not following the strait path) while the first volume is Doom's Day and the second is School of the Naked. I think that this needs no further comment. Ramadan Basttawicy: Why have you not published any studies on madness other than your research on madness' relation to creativity? Is it that you are currently reorganizing a treasure that you will publish Alif 14 (1994) 217</page><page sequence="13">in the future, as you have done previously with Hikmat al-majanin (Wisdom of Fools)? What, for you, is the relationship between madness and the human existential tragedy? Yehya El-Rakhawy: I believe that all that I have published is related to my point of view about madness. I have no research (in the current classic use of the word) on madness in relation to creativity. I do believe, from what I know about the research done on the relation of creativity to madness, in my country at least, that this research has reduced both phenomenon to some mutilated behavioural presentation. Presently, I have three main published hypotheses related to madness and creativity, in addition to a fourth that has touched the subject indirectly. All such theories have been published in a journal of literary criticism, Fusul, and not in psychiatric journals or creativity reviews. I am not sure what I am going to publish in the future in relation to this topic or any other one. I have already an unlimited store of unpublished works, but I do not know when they will be available to whom it may concern. My neglected unpublished poetry and many other literaw studies are among them. Hekmat Al Majaneen (Wisdom of Fools) was not a reorganized work, in the sense that I have got from your question. If I have the right to dream out loud in response to your question, let me say that I hope to put down my point of view related to the human march as it has been uncovered through my experiential existence along with my patients. One aspect of this march is its mishap in the form of madness. Ramadan Basttawicy: To what extent are you conscious of your use of phenomenology in both therapy and writing? Yehya El-Rakhawy: Intellectually, I do not know at all that I could belong to what is called phenomenology. On the other hand and in retrospect, I became aware more and more that all my existence is but a representation of what is phenomenology as it reaches me from those who know more of what it is about. The first time I discovered the here and now principle was through one of my mad friends. He was grateful enough to give me a present at one stage of his improvement. This was a piece of marble to be put on my desk on one side of which he intended to put my name while on the other he asked me what I would prefer to have, a saying of wisdom, a prayer, or the Alifl4(1994) 218</page><page sequence="14">like. The usual words in such occasion were something like God, This is out of the mercy of God, Patience is the key of release, etc. I asked him to write whatever he has gotten out of our long relationship. He came back, having written on the other face of the marble, "I - Here - Now," with the sign right under each of them. The other three words were "If - was - shall" with the sign wrong under each of them. When a well-read colleague came back from the States and read these words on my desk he thought that these words are written intentionally to declare that I am a phenomenologist. Till then I did not know what exactly the word "phenomenology" could mean. I believe that if one is really living a relatively non-alienated life one could not help but be a phenomenologist. This has nothing to do with being conscious or not about what phenomenology could mean. When I read recently that writing about the dialectic is against dialectic itself, I realized that the less you wnte or speak in such terms the more you are actually living them. Jane McPherson: In your writings, you have lamented the high rate of recidivism among treated drug addicts. In the United States, practitioners from therapeutic communities and other modalities are experimenting with "relapse-prevention" and "after-care." These interventions are normally targeted at recovering addicts who have left the treatment program for the community and generally consist of support groups, drop-in centers, and even dormitory-s-tyle living arrangements which continue to support the newly-sober individual in a drug-free way of life. What is your solution for preventing relapse among recovering addicts? Are "relapse-prevention" and "after-care" in place in Egypt? How successful have these programs been? What is their potential for success? Yehya El-Rakhawy: Generally, I have adopted the idea of being ready to "welcome" relapse, whether in the case of addiction or with any other psychiatric disorder. In our Arabic tradition, to welcome is something else than to invite. Arab hospitality necessitates that one welcome even an enemy. This attitude (waiting and then welcoming a relapse) has its rationale in my belief in the basic biorhythmic nature of human existence. Periodic mental illness has been noticed less and less in the last three decades. This diagnosis has been replaced by negative mental illnesses with residual mental deficits which are at least partly iatrogenic (through long-acting and life-long Alif 14 (1994) 219</page><page sequence="15">neurolization) The domination of the linear mode of living in the modern society has also influenced the periodical pattern of living when the relation was more intimate with the periodical nature around. This is another factor explaining such syndrome shifts. In my experience, in case of addiction, after the initial detoxification and establishing the first degree therapeutic relation, we very early notify the patient how we are going to manage the next relapse. On discharge we may say to some patients that we are waiting for him to come back. We prefer to say "see you" rather than "good-bye." Sometimes we add "don't be late." This does not mean that we are encouraging the person to go back to such a way of escape in drug use. We hope, in addiction and otherwise, that each attack could be a real chance to change. What matters is not the amount of improvement achieved or the number of symptoms which have disappeared but the rechannelling of the direction of the march of growth. This could be undetected in the early stages of treatment, but later any minimal deviation towards the proper direction could prove to be enough. The relapse which we wait to welcome is expected to be on some other level with some new qualities declaring that we have succeeded in turning the periodical march to some relatively upward (still periodical as well as pathological) direction. In some good cases (I cannot claim they represent a majority) remote results prove that this hypothesis is working satisfactorily. To my knowledge there are no structured, well-deElned, sufElcient support groups or drop-in centers or the like in Egypt. The limited use of mosque (or church) gatherings could be considered as the possible substitute. I am not in a position to assess the rate of success or the possible lasting effect. As regards the therapeutic community for which I am responsible (Mokattum House for Mental Health), whenever we succeed in sending the message (the overall philosophy of the milieu) the addict (or the patient) takes us with him on discharge. On the same merits, he stays with us, even after discharge. This hypothetical tie is considered as the support after discharge. The relation lasts through weekly group therapy for some time and it takes years for the message to be solid enough to change the attitude irreversibly. As regards how successful all such procedures are, let me admit once again that I am not in a position to judge. Moreover, I advise you not to take most published Elgures (even in scientific journals) for granted. This is not due to possible dishonesty but basically due to Alif 14 (1994) 220</page><page sequence="16">defective methodology. My own experience says that over many years (sometimes more than ten) we do meet true positive unexpected results. One real success is enough to make us continue. Jane McPherson: You have written that addiction may be a sign that "man as a species is committing suicide." Can you elaborate on this notion ? If human kind has taken or is taking a self-destructive turn in species proportions, what are the implications of this trend for clinical psychotherapeutic practice ? It this is true, is it still practical for mental health professionals to focus on individuals ? Yehya El-Rakhawy: Two main basic phenomena direct my interest and perhaps colour my existence: first evolution and second biorhythm. Perhaps that is why I have called my theory of psychopathology the "evolutionary rhythmic theory." My belonging to evolution stems from my fear of perishing. Man is committing so many actions that are not harmonious with species preservation. Intra-species aggression is beyond control. Pollution, killing anonymously at a distance, separation from the rhythmic nature, fallacious methodology, hoarding and meaningless stereotyped activities are among these devolutionary manifestations. Addiction, as it has appeared lately, is another alarm in the same direction. Addiction in general is an anti-growth activity. When one stirs one's level of awareness artificially and does not utilize the outcome of such induced alteration, one is merely playing with the natural march of one's individual growth and perhaps species preservation. If this is linked to some unconscious decision of self (and species) destruction, it is simply suicide. However, no species has committed suicide deliberately. Mass suicide reported in the case of group immigration of certain birds or fishes is restricted to these groups rather than their entire species. Suicide that could lead a species to perish is usually established through miscalculation. The human being claims that he is a volitional organism gifted with consciousness, volition and language, and thus he should be deliberately responsible for his possible fate. Addiction is a declaration of impending suicide rather than is the cause of such possibility. It is rather an alarm signal. I believe that psychiatric management in general and psychotherapy in particular should be centered around this evolutionary-devolutionary challenge. The tragedy of most mental illnesses, especially madness, conveys some message related to the Alif 14 (1994) 221</page><page sequence="17">possible outcome of our species. Studying the prognosis and outcome should not be limited to an individual case but should extend to some kind of statement about the outcome of the human race. The patient does not intend to shout that this or that calamity is soon to come. The therapist is the one who should be able to receive the message, to translate it and to convey it to whom it may concern. Mental health professionals have to focus on individuals simply because such individuals need help and should be helped. This should not be the end of the story. Ihe therapist could have another more important role simultaneously. This could be like the role of the critic in relation to the created text. The patient himself represents the chaotic raw text and the therapist along with the patient could re-edit such text. Simultaneously, the therapist has the chance to interpret the meaning of the raw chaotic material not only in relation to the suffering individual but also to the society at large and moreover to the march of the species. I am absolutely against putting too much blame on the society as some anti-psychiatrists do. I am also against the temptation that the psychiatrist or psychotherapist would take the role of social reformer or to have an active political role in place of his original responsibility as a therapist for individual patients. This cautious attitude does not mean that the therapist has nothing to do with the society or that solving the problem is limited to helping the possibly difficult or resisting individuals. The cry declared by the patient should be conveyed clearly to whom it may concern (as a matter of fact to all of us). Jane McPherson: Another hypothesis that you have put forward to explain the rising rates of addiction in society is that "man today needs to diminish his awareness by any means, at least temporarily, until he can cultivate his creative ability." You have written that creativity can close the gap between the ability of the individual to process information and all the information at-large in society. How can psychiatry / psychotherapy help individuals to cultivate their creativity and thus to organize and assimilate more information? How important is this goal in psychotherapy? Yehya El-Rakhawy: Addiction should not be taken simply as pleasure-seeking or dependent regression. If we try to be honest enough to assess the prevailing hypnotic state of consciousness which characterizes modern man, we would recognize that we are in a Alif 14 (1994) 222</page><page sequence="18">massive hypnotic trance. The need to break through this monotonous trance is a rational need. There is no way to do so positively except through genuine religious activity (not least the so called "tranquil self" which is the religious version of the neuroleptic decapitation of human existence) and through creative activity. Both could be considered as one and the same at some deeper level. When young people have no chance to break through, they try to induce such a break by using natural or synthetic tools to tear such hypnotic monotony. Ihey do not, at least at the beginning, realize that the outcome is a breakdown and not in the least a breakthrough. If this hypothesis holds true, which is the case to some degree in my practice, then treatment should be directed not to push the addict back to the hypnotic stereotyped state of awareness, but to give him a positive alternative that could make him able to achieve such a positive breakthrough. The increasing amount of information available to modern man is really overwhelming, to the point of jamming his perceptual input. The result is more and more monotony and hypnotism. Unless there is an appropriate proportion between the reaching of information (the ability to select) and the potentiality to assimilate (and create), hazards are to be expected. Three main hazards are to be noted in this respect; psychiatric disorders, addiction and blind psychiatric management. Prolonged neuroleptization of our patients is but blunting of the whole biological activity while reinforcing the same or a worse hypnotic state. Jane McPherson: Which do you see as the most significant current trends in Egyptian psychiatry? Are these trends positive? Yehya El-Rakhawy: I believe I have responded to some aspects of this question in my answer to Dr. Basttawicy. To repeat and elaborate I can say that psychiatry in Egypt shares a situation with psychiatry all over the world in retreating back to be rather limited palliative measure for a limited number of sufferers. At the same time, the abuse of psychiatry is participating in mutilating human life and giving an aborted, reduced model of human existence. This is established under what is erroneously called the "medical model" but which is nothing but a mechanical or chemical model. The so-called bio-psycho-social model is taken in most areas in Egypt as some sort of additive disciplines, one beside the other, and the result is an inert, colorless compromise. In actual practice it lacks the real, deep understanding of Alif 14 (1994) 223</page><page sequence="19">the transactions of one discipline with another. The influence of pharmaceutical agencies is shaping not only the how of the management of psychiatric patients but essentially the how of the thinking of psychiatrists. This mode of linear causality thinking and peripherally (part behaviour) oriented management extends beyond psychiatric practice to shape our minds in the same reductionistic way. All such criticism I am mentioning now does not give rationale to any anti-psychiatry protest. Anti-psychiatry, as known in Western countries, looks like a kind of luxury to us. The attempt to practice psychiatry in Egypt as an independent scientific and professional discipline having its very own characteristics is fading away. The special Egyptian nosological manual, The Diagnostic Manual of Psychiatric Disorder l,(DMP-I), which was initiated by the late Prof A. Askar in 1972 and first published in 1973 by the Egyptian Pychiatric Association, became available in its bilingual version in 1976 and is getting more and more overshadowed. Apart from Kasr El-Aini and Mansoura Faculties of Medicines it is hardly used. Our own national nosology has been replaced mainly by the DSM-III-R and lately by the ICD-10. This did not achieve speaking an international language as much as it has denied us our specific identity. Cultural differences are referred to in most Western researches as some decorative behavioural periphery rather than possible basic differences in attitude and mode of thinking. The psychoanalytic trend has no, or very little, place by now in psychiatric practice in Egypt and no student of the late Prof. Zewar is extending his early efforts in the field. However, some complementary effort may be recorded here and there in the areas of child psychiatry and social psychiatry. The evolutionary rhythmic model, which I and a few of my colleagues represent, is very limited and has fluctuated over the last two decades. There is one aspect of this model that could be considered to be steadily increasing. This is the special approach to group therapy as practiced in both Kasr-El Aini Hospital and Dar El-Mokattum for Mental Health Hospital. There are also some limited attempts in relation to behaviour therapy and cognitive therapy which are sporadically practiced by both psychiatrists and psychotherapists here and there. Whether some or all of these are positive or negative is hard to judge. I believe that we are in some aspects more positive compared to some other developed countries where the so-called human rights 224 Alif 14 (1994)</page><page sequence="20">problems and threats of malpractice represent a real handicap. The psychiatrist in Egypt can readily help his patients depending mainly on the doctor-patient relationship established essentially through unwritten contract. Contracting and recontracting are established essentially between the psychiatrist and his patient and, to a lesser extent, with his family. The legal regulations as well as the official medical institutions have little to do in this respect in comparison to developed countnes. This did not result, yet, in any considerable abuse. On the contrary, it gives more chances for the patient to experience some real change and more chances for the psychiatrist to pursue his profession in a creative way. I have to admit that this is getting less and less so, and as we have been invaded by the DSM-III-R we are going to be paralysed by the pseudo-freedom claimed by Western people. The movement called Islamic psychiatry, which is mainly marketing the palliative (rather hypnotizing) aspect of religion and the concept of "tranquil self," is more or less the only model taken from Islam to be introduced through this superficial discipline. However, some practice, including the limited evolutionary approach, is inspired by religion at large as a real chance for creating one's self once and again. The extension of man into the beyond as referred to for instance in Islam through the full conviction in the unknown, Al-Ghayb, represents the open- ended attitude essential for creation including creating one's self. This concept lies implicitly in the evolutionary approach and has been called Islamic. Jane McPherson: For "expressive therapists," the production of art, drama, poetry, dance, and music is central to psychotherapy. How has your interest in the relationship between art and madness as well as the centrality of creativity in your thought, influenced your practice? Have you incorporated the production of art into your psychiatric practice? Why or why not? Under what circumstances is the production of art or the act of creation psychotherapeutic? What is the role of (producing) art in psychotherapy? Is there a role for psychiatry / psychotherapy in the production of art? Yehya El-Rakhawy: I am not very happy about using the term "expressive" to describe certain types of therapy where the patient is allowed to express himself or his inner life. My practice in psychotherapy (particularly in group setting and milieu therapy) is Alif 14 (1994) 225</page><page sequence="21">mainly directed towards what could be called unfolding-reassociation technique. The unfolding component could correspond to the form of therapy that is usually known as "expressive." It is not only a matter of using different words, but our goal in most incidences is not at all catharthis or abreaction. Perhaps this is due to the fact that my main work is with psychotics and personality disorders rather than with neurotics and adjustment disorders. My opinion about the relation of art to madness has been referred to in my response to another interviewer. However I do not usually use the word "art" (particularly in Arabic fann) as synonymous to creation. Art is but one aspect of creation. In some of my writings I have put art at a less profound level than creation. In my thesis on "Creation and Aggression" I have related art to sexual instinct while genuine creation is the positive aspect of integrating aggression (which I consider to be a more basic instinct than sex). In another thesis on the dialectic relation between madness and creation, I have classified creation into many levels where art stands short of the highest level of creation. Coming back to your question about whether I have incorporated the production of art into my psychiatric practice or not, I am going to refer to a few trials. During the early seventies I had the chance to start a very limited trial in the field of free formative art. Since the majority of my patients were psychotics the result was not very constructive. Another trial has lasted more with positive results over seven years (although interrupted for three years). This was by using poetry in a group setting. The patients were not invited to compose their own poems. Some limited verses, given during the session, were repeated and recited with or without singing, occasionally associated with the music of a lyre (Al-Ou played by a talented therapist. The results were much more significant. The interpretation was modest and this activity was not considered in the direction of creation but rather helped in activation of the relation to rhythmic pattern of life as well as reassociation in some other manner. My personal trial in the direction of synthetic unfolding during therapy was specifically practiced while running with my patients before (and during) sun rise in an open space. This has lasted over more than ten years until my knee cartilages protested (one has been operated upon). During such running we used to sing, dance and let any one of the participants (patients and therapist) modify, add or innovate his special words or different rhythm or tune while singing. Alif 14 (1994) 226</page><page sequence="22">Some of these created songs were related to the sunrise, to praying to God, to chatting with the sand or ground. This type of creation (as I try to call it now) proved, in retrospect, to be most useful and optimal. Some other creative activities were allowed during the weekly group-dance meeting held in our therapeutic milieu at Mokattum Hospital. A more extended chance for initiation as well as creative activity (in the everyday sense) is met with in prolonged outdoor activities particularly at the seashore Camp in Ras-EL-Hikma (Near Marsa-Matrouh). The creation is mainly through the daily activity rather than through the production of special art. I do not like the expression "production of art." At one stage of my development I considered production of art as a substitute for creation of life (of the self). Later I retreated from this attitude when I realized that it is a good idea to do something creative and constructive as a production if it is very difficult or even impossible to do it in actual life (living creatively). The real creation I refer to in this context is to create one's self over and again. This is theoretically impossible. In spite of this realistic orientation and retreat I still believe that saying the same word by the patient in different tone with different connotation is real therapeutic creation rather than producing some artistic product that could replace his (or anyone's) need to create. Once again I have to remind you that I am working mainly with psychotics. With neurotics, with whom my experience is less profound (unless they develop mini-psychosis during therapy), I believe the production of art has some positive defensive role in psychotherapy.
