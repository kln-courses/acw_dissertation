<plain_text><page sequence="1">CRITICAL REALISM AND THEISM' DURANT DRAKE Vassar College After an initial definition of critical realism, the article inquires whether the tests of reality employed by realism establish the existence of God. Typical conceptions of God are subjected to this test, and the conclusion is reached that "the existence of a God of the traditional sort does not stand on a par, evidentially, with the existence of physical objects or of other human and animal minds." I have been asked by various people what bearing, if any, the epistemological theory defended in Essays in Critical Real- ism has upon our right to believe in God. Let me first remind the reader what that theory is, by contrasting it with several other current views. It is sharply opposed to the various forms of epistemological idealism, whether of the Berkeleyan, the Kantian, or the post- Kantian type. It rejects the axiom that esse=percipi, that nothing exists except as it is known. It holds that physical ob- jects are independently real, exist in their own right. What their qualitative nature is it leaves an open question, to be answered, if at all, by metaphysics. The knowledge of them gained through perception and elaborated by the physical sciences is valid knowledge, but it is only a structural, not a qualitative, knowledge. Any theory of their nature which is compatible with science is compatible with our theory. Again, critical realism is opposed to radical pragmatism, the "philosophy of pure experience," which refuses to believe in anything beyond experience. According to that theory, by the truth of a belief we can mean only that the belief "works," in the sense of producing further experiences of a certain type. To say that we believe in God is simply to say that the God- belief works satisfactorily for us. By contrast with that posi- IA paper read at the annual meeting of the Theological Society, in New York, April 3, 1923. 130</page><page sequence="2">CRITICAL REALISM AND THEISM 131 tion, we hold that "working" is a useful criterion of truth, but is not the meaning of the term "truth." If the belief in God "works," in the scientific sense, we have, in so far, good reason for believing that God exists; but by the truth of a belief in God we mean more than the fact that the belief works; we mean that there really is such a God, existing in His own right, inde- pendently of our knowledge of him. It is not always realized that radical pragmatism is a sort of unacknowledged skepti- cism, a masked refusal to believe in anything beyond the bor- ders of human experience. Realism is willing to entertain the possibility of the existence of any sort of reality outside of our experience, and merely asks that ample justification be offered for believing in this or that suggested reality. Critical realism differs, however, from some other contem- porary forms of realism in admitting that any or all experi- ences of the perceptual sort may, conceivably, be hallucinatory. The awareness of physical objects, such as we all have, is not, in itself, evidence that such objects exist Their existence must always remain for us, therefore, a matter of hypothesis. For that matter, even if we believed that we do actually perceive the existence of physical things, that belief would be only a hypothesis, conceivably mistaken. In the nature of the case, realism must always be a hypothesis. We believe that, in the case of physical objects and in the case of human and animal minds, there are very conclusive grounds for believing in real- ism, and we are very confident that the hypothesis is true. But we freely admit that the grounds for belief are essentially pragmatic, in the sense that the realistic hypothesis is to be accepted because it explains the facts of experience more com- pletely and plausibly than any other hypotheses which may be suggested. We think, then, that the pragmatic method, when properly employed, leads to realism; that pragmatism would not remain "radical," confined in its outlook to human experience, if it were true to its own genius. Nor do we believe in that popular</page><page sequence="3">132 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION form of pragmatism which accepts as true whatever "works," in the sense of satisfying our desires or emotions or "needs." The scientific sense of the term "works," which we accept, has no kinship with this loose popular sense. There is no general presumption that what satisfies our emotions or our "needs" is true. In fact, experience decisively negates this delightful conception. The only legitimate ground for believing in the existence of anything beyond our immediate experience is that the hypothesis that it exists serves to explain the peculiarities of our experience. In the case of physical objects, the case for realism is over- whelming. Our objective experiences are clearly subject to other laws than the laws of our experience itself; they belong to a describable pattern which is only in very slight degree experienced. We cannot affect these experiences by our wills, as we can our thoughts, emotions, and desires; we are at their mercy. They jump into our ken abruptly, unrelated to any- thing pre-existing in our experience. They do not piece together into a coherent whole in our experience. But by filling them out in imagination, we can construct a complete world, so definite that we can predict from our construction, in the great- est detail, what objective experiences we shall have at definite future moments. They appear at their proper places in this order with the regularity of clockwork. They seem not to spring up spontaneously within our field, but to come to it out of this order. The facts thus hinted at are indeed explicable by other hypotheses than realism. We may imagine that a God has conceived this vast world-pattern, and that he continually and unfailingly produces in us the experiences that we should have if there were a really existent outer world affecting our senses. But how much simpler for him to have created that world and left it to affect our senses for itself! In fact, such a hypothesis of an endless series of miracles is so far-fetched as compared with the simple realism of common sense that only a veritable cosmophobia could prefer it.</page><page sequence="4">CRITICAL REALISM AND THEISM 133 But this is only the beginning of the argument. Our mechan- isms of perception are meaningless if there is no outer world to affect them. They have evidently been developed in order to bring to us messages from a world about us. Again, the facts of cosmic history, unfolded in great detail by astronomers and geologists, demand a realistic explanation. Again, the fact that our objective experiences come in groups, a visual experience being a sign of a possible tactile experience, etc.; and the fact that my objective experiences belong to the same pattern as your objective experiences-all these peculiarities, and many others that might be enumerated, point straight to realism. There are no experiences whatever that seem in any way incom- patible with realism. All our experiences are as they might very naturally be if realism is true. Hence we feel abundantly justi- fied in being realists with regard to the world of objects that affect our senses. The belief in the existence of other human, and of animal, minds is not so overwhelmingly supported. Yet the bodies of the people about me act so nearly as I should act in similar situations that the hypothesis that they have a consciousness very much like my own is clearly indicated, and far more reason- able than the hypothesis that all bodies except my own are unconscious automata. When I learn that these other human bodies are descendants of the very ancestors from which I have sprung, it is ridiculous to suppose that I alone have developed consciousness. And the same argument, pushed back, applies to the animals, who are my more distant cousins. My own consciousness, however, has grown in vividness and range as my brain has developed; and all observation sup- ports the hypothesis that throughout the animal world brain development and mental development go pari passu. Hence to carry the analogy down below the animal series into the world of plant life is to stretch it farther than seems warranted. Where there are no sense organs, no pain or pleasure mechanisms, no thought or imagination mechanisms, it is difficult even to imagine what sort of consciousness they could have. At any</page><page sequence="5">134 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION rate, the argument based on similar structure and similar behav- ior, by means of which we are justified in our belief in the con- scious life of other men and at least the higher animals, is not valid where the similarity of structure and behavior ceases. Now then, what shall we say about the belief in God? Well, that depends, of course, upon what we mean by the term. If we use the term "God" in a purely Platonic sense, as a synonym for the "highest good," the ideal, then there is no need of argu- ment. Such a God is an essence, not an existent; the fact that such a concept can be formulated is enough. It may be a very important concept, and it may play a considerable part in our philosophy. Serious and difficult questions may arise concerning it, as, Does the Good in any way influence events, as Plato and Aristotle seem to believe? Is it like a magnet, drawing the world on to greater and greater perfection? But this argument con- cerning final causes, and the whole problem of the relation between essence and existence, lie far beyond the scope of this paper. And it is not in the least necessary to discuss them in order to substantiate our right to hold the conception of God as the Highest Good. Another sense in which we can accept the term "God" with- out argument is the naturalistic sense in which it was used by Matthew Arnold and is used today, with variations of phrase- ology, by H. G. Wells, Colonel Younghusband, Professor Overstreet, Dr. Ames, and many others. God as the Power in the world that makes for righteousness and all good is an empirical reality, whose existence stands or falls with that of the human minds about us and their environing world. Mr. Wells says that he does not argue, he relates; and that is quite strictly true-except that he embroiders God with various phrases which may individually be criticized. In this sense, as in the Platonic sense, God may be important for our philosophy and our religious life, without plunging us into any doubts or difficulties. A third sense in which we may use this highly ambiguous</page><page sequence="6">CRITICAL REALISM AND THEISM 135 term "God" without encountering difficulties is that in which ex-President Eliot, R. G. Campbell in his New Theology, and many other writers influenced by modern science, are using it, viz., as a name for the Universal Energy. Whatever this ulti- mate reality may be, it is certainly there; it is inconceivably vast in space and time, it excites our imagination and awakens our awe-but hardly our love, or loyalty, or worship. Loyalty and worship are due to goodness, not to power, or size, or com- plexity, or regularity, or any other of the known attributes of the universal reality. Only if by some line of reasoning we can believe ourselves warranted in ascribing goodness to it, should we properly worship it, or-I should suppose-properly call it God. A fourth conception of God holds that this universal reality is conscious; or, in other words, that there is a World-Soul. This is a perfectly conceivable hypothesis, which has been supported by far too many arguments to discuss here. I will only point out two great difficulties which it must surmount before we can accept it as plausible. First, as in the case of plant life, it is difficult to see how the universe can be conscious without any visible mechanism of perception or thought or emotion or imagination. The more closely we study the conditions and nature of consciousness, as we experience it, the more clearly we seem to see that intelligence, emotion, thought, and all the other phases of our conscious life are functions of organic bodies, and, specifically, of nervous reaction-mechanisms. If the universe is conscious, it must apparently be in a different sense from that in which we apply the term to ourselves. In the second place, nothing seems clearer than that we are part and parcel of the universe. Its energy flows through us. Yet our consciousness does not flow together as so many throbs in one universal consciousness. The chasms between our minds are as real as our minds themselves. But if the life of the uni- verse forms one conscious whole, how do our minds come to be thus split off from the soil out of which they have sprung? The</page><page sequence="7">136 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION replies of pantheists (or immanental theists) to this question have never seemed satisfactory to me. Yet if one is to believe in a personalistic conception of nature, the all-inclusive world- soul seems more logical than modern personalism, which admits the separateness of our human minds, but seems unable, so far as I can discover, to explain how those little fragments of the world that are you and I got chipped off from the universal God-mind. All forms of pantheism, of monistic theism, and of modern personalism are, of course, up against the apparent cruelty or moral indifference of nature. A God who is the soul of every- thing is the soul of evil as well as of good; ignorance, disaster, defeat are as truly real as wisdom and success. But this diffi- culty is equally serious for the believers in the supernatural creator-ruler God, the God of orthodoxy and popular belief, the last conception of God of which I shall speak. It is this more or less anthropomorphic (as to mind, if not as to body) God that interests most people; it is, in its more refined phases, undoubtedly the most inspiring and precious belief that the mind of man has ever entertained. It would take, of course, a large volume to do anything like justice to the many arguments that have been offered to prove the existence of such a Being. Very few of them, however, have much weight with freely thinking men today. The evidence for miracles, special providences, and supernatural answers to prayer is startling in quantity, but sharply questioned by men trained in estimating evidence. The evidence that would make Jesus out to be a supernatural personage is in like case; and with the gradual waning of the supernaturalization of Jesus we are coming to realize that his faith in the Father-God is no more evidential than anyone else's. Spirituality of character is no guaranty of correct understanding on these elusive matters; indeed, the spiritual man is apt to lean on tradition, and trust his hopes and his imagination more than the average man, and</page><page sequence="8">CRITICAL REALISM AND THEISM 137 is, in so far, a particularly untrustworthy guide in these matters where we need the coolest and most critical use of our reason. When we turn to the more philosophical arguments, we find the student of ethics regarding morality as a code gradually developed by man, in hit-or-miss manner, to safeguard his life and happiness, and quite without supernatural implications. We find the evolutionist attributing the delicate adjustments of organisms to environment to a process of natural selection working upon a great variety of blind variations. We find him regarding organic life, and even mind, as developed by a continuous process of evolution out of inorganic matter, with no need of special creation. We find the philosopher substituting for the First-Cause argument a belief that the universe is eternal, existing in its own right, without need of supernatural creation or direction. Thus, without meaning in the least to imply that these rejections are all final, we cannot help realizing that all the stock theistic arguments are highly precarious. Mystical states are a precious phase of the religious life. But, so far as I can see, there is no justification for believing that they have any noetic value. They may truly be said to reveal God to the experiencer. But their beauty and significance seem quite compatible with the naturalistic or Platonic con- ception of God. The particular sort of assurance that the mystic has depends apparently upon his previous stock of ideas. And of course the assurance itself has no evidential value. It is not the assurance with which we all believe in the reality of outer objects that justifies our belief in them; it is the fact that that belief explains a multitude of striking facts not otherwise easily explicable, and the fact of the existence of the sense organs by which we apparently get in touch with outer objects. In the case of the mystical experiences, there are no organs known by which we could get into contact with a trans-subjective reality, and the hypothesis that we are in such contact does not seem to</page><page sequence="9">138 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION explain anything that cannot be explained in purely psycho- logical terms. The obvious fact is that the existence of the supernatural God does not stand at all on a par, evidentially, with the exist- ence of human and animal minds, or the existence of physical objects. The evidence for his existence, if there is evidence, is of a more elusive sort. All that I can do here is to suggest the only two lines of investigation that seem to me at all promising. The first of these investigations would study the various phe- nomena that seem to demand explanation in terms of a super- natural power: visions, conversions, miracles, answered prayers, and the like. We must not rule out this enormous mass of proffered evidence because of any a priori belief in natural law. But we should have to have a far more thoroughgoing scientific study of these phenomena than has yet been made before we should be warranted in saying that the hypothesis of super- natural interference is more plausible than the naturalistic hypothesis. The other line of investigation would study the moral aspects of the world. Do the facts of history and personal experience point to a purpose behind or in the cosmic process? Can we possibly, in view of the misery in the world, think of it as the creation of a benevolent being? It is not enough to say that the world is too wonderful to have come to be what it is blindly; we have no experience of universes that would warrant us in denying that a very marvelous universe can grow up blindly. Nor is it pertinent to say that the conception of a God-planned universe satisfies our minds most fully. Of course it does; we irresistibly think in anthropomorphic terms. No, the argument must be far more subtle than that. We must find a sensible and valuable end that is consistently being realized by the world- process if we are to justify a theistic belief by this kind of evi- dence. The problem of evil must be solved with considerable plausibility. And we must formulate some conception of how</page><page sequence="10">CRITICAL REALISM AND THEISM 139 God rules the world and bends it to his plan; i.e., we must bring our ruler-God into intelligible relations with his world. Whether or not such tasks as these are in the way to be brought to a successful conclusion by our theologians, I cannot here consider. It seems to me certain, however, that the exist- ence of a God of the traditional sort does not stand on a par, evidentially, with the existence of physical objects or of other human and animal minds. There is no such overwhelming and obvious mass of facts whose peculiarities can be explained only by accepting the belief in a Supernatural Being as there is in these other cases. It is no wonder that everybody, except a few ingenious philosophers, believes in physical objects and in animal minds, and that comparatively few impartial inquirers come to a very assured conviction of the existence of the Super- natural Being. We believe because we were taught to believe; because so many others believe; because we cannot bear to give up the belief. If we accept some argument as justifying our belief, we accept it gingerly, hoping that it is sound, but not relying too heavily upon it. Not a few, distracted by doubt and hope, give up the belief, and find inspiration in a naturalis- tic or Platonic God, while a few are allured by the more meta- physical routes that lead to pantheism or personalistic ideal- ism. But in their present temper the great mass of people want a supernatural God or none. And those who are interested in keeping alive such a belief have a serious task before them if they are, with the old arguments, to stem the tide of disillusion- ment which is carrying so many believers not only away from orthodoxy, but from the conception of God, if not from religion itself.</page></plain_text>
