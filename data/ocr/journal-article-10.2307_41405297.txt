<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Disruption of the Probable: Narrative Writing in Children Seven to Thirteen Sally Paramour Andrew Wilkinson In a famous phrase, Hardy (in Meek et al. 1977) speaks of narrative as a primary act of mind. My argument is that narrative ... is not to be regarded as an aesthetic invention used by artists to control, manipulate and order experience, but as a primary act of mind transferred to art from life . . . too we dream in narrative, daydream in narrative, remember, anticipate, hope, despair, believe, doubt, plan, revise, criticise, construct, gossip, learn, hate and love by narrative. In order really to live we make up stories about ourselves and others, about the personal as well as the social past and future. Narrative as a primary act of mind seems a powerful proposition. While there are other acts of mind open to human beings from early days, narrative nevertheless is, and must be, a very important one because we carry out actions in a temporal world. It is a form of coherent ordering in which the young child engages, and to which he is exposed in the storying around him. Under these circumstances we would expect much early writing in schools to be in narrative form. And this writing can be, in a very real sense, the story of the children's lives, an essential feature of, and means in their personal development. This was one of the main concerns of the Crediton Project (Wilkinson et al. 1980); the other was for far wider criteria of evaluation than are currently in use, reflect- ing such development. Both these concerns lie behind the research described in this paper, whose purpose was to describe the features of children's narrative writing between the ages of seven and thirteen. Research Design The design of this research was to present the same three tasks, all intended to elicit narrative prose, to three groups of children, aged approximately seven, ten and thirteen years. Three neighboring schools on the outskirts of Norwich, England, kindly cooperated. Thus the groups were likely to be similar in terms of key variables. Writing was elicited from one class in each group, by class teachers working with their own pupils, after detailed discussion with the researcher. Language Arts, Volume 62, Number 4, April 1985 391</page><page sequence="2">392 Language Arts Three narrative tasks were set, in a prescribed order. 1. An autobiographical narrative, an account of something memorable because it made the writer happy, or sad, or was in some other way interesting. 2. An imaginative narrative, in response to one of a choice of three pictures in a stimulus. 3. An imaginative narrative intended for an audience of, say, five year olds. As many decisions as possible were left open to the writers, regarding the selection and shaping of ideas - for instance there were no prescribed titles, or required length - and teacher support was sufficient to maintain the task, without teacher intervention to shape ideas. Models of Analysis Models of analysis began to evolve from close interaction between theory and first-hand data, with the thinking behind the Crediton Project (Wilkinson et al. 1980) playing an important part in this process. Attempts to produce a composite, graded description of increasingly well-formed narratives were discarded, on the grounds that they attempted to conflate developments belonging on different dimensions. A number of models were clearly needed, and the Crediton models offered the basis for these. It was necessary to amend and expand them in places to meet the specific concerns of this research. Readers familiar with the detailed nature of the original Crediton models will appreciate that it is impossible to set out fully here the revised versions. It is sufficient to say here that they - particularly the affective - were making significant discriminations in development across the age range covered. The contribution of this present research is felt to lie in the formulation of a new model, the Development of Storying, associated with the description of temporal, spatial, and eventual probabilities. The Concept of Ordinariness This notion has developed from studying the work of very young writers. When coping with the heavy cognitive and physical demands of the writing process, young children tend to draw upon very familiar everyday experiences for content. Thus children play with friends, go to the park or school, and come home for tea, television, and bed. Nothing disturbs the ordinariness of the daily pattern, and bedtime is the obvious conclusion to the chronological narrative, there being no tension to resolve. The overriding impression gained from reading numerous such texts is that they are highly predictable. This is not to belittle the effort and achievement involved in generating written language and a flow of ideas. In</page><page sequence="3">The Disruption of the Probable : Narrative Writing in Children Seven to Thirteen 393 storying terms, however, the ordinariness and predictability of events contribute to the definition of a basic storyform. A working definition is proposed as follows: The events of narrative are ordinary when they conform to all expectations of time, place, and social relationships. Events occur in time, in a location where the laws of nature pertain, and people and objects are assigned their expected roles and uses. Thus, in the light of the reader's knowledge of the world, rather than through literary devices, the narrative is seen as predictable. Furthermore, this ordinariness renders the events potentially repeatable on any number of subsequent occasions. Such predictable, repeatable events are related in strict chronological sequence. With reference to chronology, it is of course a basic requirement of narrative that at least two clauses should be temporally ordered in relation to each other. Thus the sentence 'I shot and killed him' fulfills the requirements of narrative, whereas 'I laughed and laughed' does not. Young children are accustomed to being asked to order events, such as what they did at school, or what they did on the weekend, or to sequence their way through key points in the day, such as breakfast time, school time, and play time. It does not seem unreasonable to expect that children of seven to eight should have the ability to relate events in temporal sequence. The label of "chronicle" is posited for that writing which combines such characteristics of ordinariness and chronology, and represents the baseline from which storying develops. "Chronicle" is not here intended to be derogatory, a "mere" chronicle. Rather it is a simple statement of a stage that encompasses the characteristics already outlined, and in addition implies a lack of selectivity of detail. Scholes and Kellogg (1966) mention such a lack in respect of historical narratives, or chronicles, and it is similarly implied in the Concise Oxford Dic- tionary's definition of chronicle as "a continuous register of events in order of time." This lack of selectivity serves to emphasize the essential ordinariness of events, where nothing is allowed to assume greater importance. This type of narrative does not necessarily correlate with brevity or poor mechanical skill. Some texts of considerable length are neatly produced, and incorporate increasing detail. Nevertheless, they still fail to move beyond the bounds of chronicle. A small shift away from ordinariness, though by no means a proven neces- sary stage, appears in some children's work, identified as a "special occasion narrative." Entirely as the result of free choice, not teacher direction, a narra- tive may be set on a fixed date, such as Christmas Day or Mothering Sunday. This seems to represent an attempt to move beyond ordinariness, yet further examination of such texts suggests that this has not been achieved. This is explained in terms of the shared cultural expectations of the writer and the reader. Given certain expectations of events, the text proves entirely predictable and the events potentially repeatable in subsequent years. The probabilities suffer no disruption.</page><page sequence="4">394 Language Arts Disruption of Probabilities Disruption of the "probably" pattern immediately renders events less predictable and less repeatable. The unusual event or behavior, the socially unacceptable behavior or unfortunate accident that disturbs the probabilities entails in itself some further response and resolution. It leaves the reader wondering what will happen next, with a genuine curiosity. The capacity thus to arouse the reader is precisely what constitutes E.M. Forster's definition of a "story" in his literary work on Aspects of the Novel (1927). The child who writes thus is producing stories not chronicles. They may be brief pieces, written with obvious mechanical difficulty, but they are stories. Some texts may be comparatively lengthy, with a good deal of the chronicle of ordinariness surrounding the main disturbance. Only slowly does selectivity develop, leaving the influence of chronicle completely behind. The tabulated model below seeks to indicate the major types of disruption of probabilities that occur regularly in early stories. They may range from slight deviations from the norm to considerably more bizarre deviations, with a tendency towards the violent act or accident. While early stories hinge on one disruption of probabilities, later stories, it is suggested, contain two or more discrete events, each with its own disturbance of probability. The relationship between events is temporal rather than causal, and usually involving the same characters. It is interesting to speculate as to why this occurs. Given cognitive limitations on planning a unified whole, the writer may respond to the exhortation to write "more" or to make it "more exciting" by adding on extra incidents. The yet more fully developed story would seem to revert to the use of one major disruption of the "probably" pattern, with the surrounding detail being increasingly relevant to the narrative. Furthermore, the disturbance of probability is no longer introduced only at the point of occurrence, but is foreshadowed, pervading the text almost from the beginning. Choice of word, phrase, and detail are significant, the reader's curiosity is quickly aroused and his attention held as tension mounts. With the increasing range of devices at his disposal, the writer maximizes the storytelling, allowing nothing to remain commonplace. Time, place, weather, the creeping, dashing, whispering, or screaming characters are all significant. At the highest level of storying proposed here, the reasons, intentions, and motives of characters are made explicit; cause and effect can be traced; the story reveals not only what happened but why. In E.M. Forster's literary terms this latter point would be the element that turns "story" into plot. The writer may make "more" out of "less," or at least out of fewer incidents, as an interest in people develops. The story written at this level is a cohesive, effective whole. The reader, on reaching the end, is prompted to reflect back over the structure as a whole, and may perceive more in it than its constituent events. The narrative may indeed have been used as C.S. Lewis suggests, as the net to capture what cannot be sequenced. (Lewis, in Meek at al. 1977).</page><page sequence="5">The Disruption of the Probable : Narrative Writing in Children Seven to Thirteen 395 Development of Storying ST 1 Chronicle ST 1.1 Pre-Chronicle. Aggregate of action and stasis statements, with minimal temporal or causal relationships. ST 1.2 Chronicle. Relation, in order of time, of events that are ordinary, predict- able, potentially repeatable. Lack of selectivity of events and details. Typically events occur within one day ending with bed. Occurs in autobiographical and imaginative narrative. ST 1.3 Elaborated Chronicle. Bearing all features of Chronicle, but with increased elaboration of setting, actual speech of characters may be given, more detail of events. Occurs in autobiographical and imaginative narrative. ST 1.4 Chronicle of Special Occasion. Writer freely chooses to relate, in order of time, events on a specified occasion, e.g., Mother's Day. No disturbance of prob- ability, given shared cultural expectations between writer and reader. Occurs in autobiography and imaginative narrative. ST 2 Story ST 2.1 Simple Story. Relation of events in temporal sequence, little elaboration of core events. One overt disturbance of probabilities, entailing response and resolution. Disturbance introduced only at point of occurrence. May be starkly realized or surrounded by some chronicle. Selectivity increases slowly. Degree of disruption varies, outcomes (e.g., punishment) often disproportionate. Occurs in autobiography and fiction. ST 2.2 Story with Additions. Relation in temporal sequence of two or more events, each containing disturbance of probability. Links between events are temporal. Lack of logical unity leaves ending unsatisfying, as it becomes a chronicle of the end of the day and so to bed. Disturbances introduced only at point of occurrence. A range of disturbances. Occurs frequently in imaginative narrative. In autobiography, recall in temporal sequence of a number of memorable but unrelated incidents. ST 2.3 Developed Story. Narration of sequence of events where one major disturb- ance of probability is the focus, entailing what follows. Writer begins to make more out of fewer incidents by increase in elaborative detail, some selected, some still superfluous, and by foreshadowing the disruption early in the narrative, arousing reader's curiosity about events. Time, place, speech begin to have narrative signifi- cance, e.g., " very early in the morning"; "a ghostly wood"; "Mummy said Don't go too far." Range of disturbance, but disturbance and outcome more fully realized. Out- comes are wider range, the home-lost-found-home again pattern begins to be broken. In autobiography, disturbance is alluded to and more fully realized. In addition to memorable accidents, there are records of successful achievements. ST 2.4 Well- Developed Story. Displays developments on many dimensions, result- ing in a unified story, with relevant elaborations of events, characters, settings. Disturbance of probabilities occurs within a range. Additionally, especially in auto- biography the uniqueness of a situation is what renders it unpredictable and unrepeatable in identical form, "the first time I ever. ..." Disturbance pervades text from beginning. Time, place, weather, personal char- acteristics all significant. Verbs of common occurrence are inadequate for people who rush, dash, whisper, scream. Excitement, suspense, or surprise may be present,</page><page sequence="6">396 Language Arts to hold reader's attention through to resolution. Ending may not be safe, "happily- ever-after" type, but may include disappearance, or even death, etc. Awareness of genre-models in some narratives - the crime story, the adventure tale, fairy tale, moral or explanatory tale. The whole is more than the sum of its parts. Reader can reflect upon a cohesive whole, which may have captured an abstract notion, e.g., loneliness, fear, anxiety conquered, achievement, courage, poverty, friendship, happiness, a sense of justice. Storying in Children's Writing Seven Year Olds In autobiography, the task set was intended to give the pupils the scope to go beyond the level of chronicling daily events (which style is the inevitable result of a regular demand for "news"). Relatively few of the texts are rated at the level of simple chronicle (ST 1.2) from this assignment. One text which is thus rated, is by Wayne (aged 7 years, 10 months). It might be given the gloss of "having a friend to play," an ordinary and repeatable occurrence in the lives of most young children. He records: Richard came round and we had a game of space invaders and I got 1000 points and then we had a game of marbles for 15 minutes and then Richard went home. The piece is shaped by entering the time sequence at the point of Richard's arrival, and making an exit from it with his departure. Details about Richard are singularly lacking, though the reader assumes that he is a friend of Wayne's. A small shift is seen in narratives set on a named occasion, where the writer strives to record a memorable occurrence, yet all the incidents remain normal within the cultural expectations of the reader. This was noted in narratives such as this one by Claire (7:10): Yesterday it was Mothers day and I bought a box of chocolate and my brother bought some hairspray, and my sister bought some cream to put on her face, and. . . . This and a number of other scripts from this age group were classified at the ST 1.4 level of a chronicle of a special occasion, which lacked any overt evaluation of the significance of the occasion. At the level of ST 2.1, (a simple story containing one disturbance of proba- bilities) there were a number of texts by seven year olds. As the model suggests, some such stories embed the disturbance in a chronicle of the more ordinary events of the day, while others deal more directly with the unusual occurrence. A fortuitous illustration presented itself in the data, when two children wrote of the same incident, in which they were both involved, but wrote in differing ways. Claire's account chronicles events preceding the disturbance: Yesterday me and Sarah went round for Matthew, James S . . .'s little brother . . .</page><page sequence="7">The Disruption of the Probable: Narrative Writing in Children Seven to Thirteen 397 After describing in some detail the outing and return of Matthew in his pushchair, Claire describes seeing something: I saw a yellow and green thing in a dack (?) and I walked back I saw it was a toad I called Sarah and when I told her she nearly jumped out of her skin. The reader's curiosity mounts during this. What will happen next? Sarah went to tell the boys, and when they came Sarahs brother Martin He kept touching it with his glove and me and Sarah kept screeming and a man came out and put it in his garden. This represents a story, not a chronicle, and contains some detail. Compare this with Martin's briefer account, rendered in full. The impact is slightly lessened by now knowing the situation, but his story is effective in arousing the reader's curiosity: On Sunday I was playing with Martin Q at a game of cricket and me and Martin had 200 runs and sudenly my sister came up and she said was yelling and she said Theres a toad so we all followd her and when we got there Martin touched it and then it started jumping and Claire and Sarah started screming and then this man spoylt it all becaus Martin got it on the road and then he said it came from his garden so he took it in and we went in for lunch and then me and Martin had a game of soldgers. This represents an effective simple story at the ST 2. 1 level, based on the disturb- ance to the pattern of the day brought about by finding the toad, which provoked the touching and screaming, and led to the man ending the situation by returning the toad to his garden. This represents the main trend of storying in the seven year olds' autobiography, though one writer, despite enormous problems with spelling and punctuation, produced a text verging on ST 2.2 level, a story with an additional incident, temporally related to the first, added on at the end. It is a measure of the difficulty experienced by the youngest writers in respond- ing to the pictures for the imaginative narrative task that just under half the class managed to sustain a narrative response. The others, when faced with pictures which had of necessity to be suitably mature for thirteen year olds, found the cognitive load heavy, and resorted to naming or labelling the people in the pictures, and elements from the background. However, amongst those who sustained a narrative, there were examples of simple chronicle, special occasion narrative, and simple story level. In contrast, many children achieved a level of storying equal to the ST 2.1 story in their third assignment, the narrative intended for small children. In this task they felt more comfortable, more secure, and wrote - not with a struggle - but with the confidence borne of having a clear model for story in mind. Thus witches, wizards, fairies and anthropomophism are all found. Arguably the most success- fully developed story produced in this assignment was penned by a writer who</page><page sequence="8">398 Language Arts struggled unsuccessfully to sustain a narrative in response to the picture. The story deals directy with the disturbance of probabilities, in the appearance of the witch, which entails all that follows in this satisfyingly complete, and for this age group, complex account: The Witch And Me. One day I went for a walk in the woods. Suddenly I hear this funny laughing in the distance then I saw a witch up on her broomstick suddenly I was up on her broomstick as well and I flue to her cave it was on the other side of the Misty Mountains I was frighten suddenly she cast a spell on me I was running to the entrance but it was closed just as the spell was going to hit me I jumped behind a rock the spell bounced on the rock and hit the witch she turned into a frog then I got up and took the broomstick and looked at the buttons and swichs near the door I prested one of the swichs it opened the door I flu back home I told my mum but she did not believe it. The End. Ten Year Olds Characteristic of the ten year olds' autobiographical narratives is the disappearance of the simple chronicle, and the much firmer establishment of the ability to tell a simple story. Indeed, half the sample of scripts in this age group fall into the stage of simple storying, where one particular disturbance of probabilities entails what follows (ST 2.1). A large number of the stories relate to accidents (breakages, falls from bicycles, etc.), illnesses, or mischievous behavior. This is also true of the nature of the disturbances where a number of memorable but otherwise uncon- nected incidents are recalled, in a number of stories rated at the level ST 2.2. Typical of such stories is that of Justin, at 9 years, 9 months one of the younger pupils in this class: When I was small about three I was wondering about the house, I was wondering about for three hours then walked into the kitchen where my mum was doing the ironing and then she went out of the room I triped over the wire and the iron was still hot and it fell on me. I was in hospital for 3 days. Two weeks ago I was playing football and I skided on the mud and cut the side of my leg. In my back garden I was playing football and when I was trying a penaltey at my dad and it broke two things a window and behind it was a mirror and that broke two. so then I had quite a bit of bad luck. Typical of the storying at this level is the rather fuller realization of the first incident, followed by more sketchy coverage of successive ones. Narratives which seem to be working towards the ST 2.3 level of a developed story (and there were three in the sample class) all center around one incident, with elements of both semantic and expressive elaboration for the reader, fore- shadowing of the events to come, and some evaluation in the text, if even only to a modest degree. Thus, a boy who scored the winning goal in an important football match says "I will never forget that day," while the girl hurt in a fall from a pony described it as "one of the most terrifying things that has happened to me."</page><page sequence="9">The Disruption of the Probable : Narrative Writing in Children Seven to Thirteen 399 One type of storying which does not disappear from the autobiographical writing of the ten year olds is that of the chronicle of special occasion. Though simple chronicles cease, a number of writers describe in considerable detail the chronological sequence of events on an "occasion," though nothing untoward transpires. While the reader may guess that the occasion was important to the writer, there is no textual evidence of the significance or evaluation of the event. Carol (aged 10 years, 4 months) chronicles her arrival at a Gymnastics Club display in just such a fashion, from the time of arrival, through lining up in the corridor, going into the hall and giving the display, to coming home to fish and chips. In imaginative narratives in this age group the ability confidently to tell a simple story again seems well established in the majority, with some pupils offering stories with additions, and a few showing evidence of working towards the ST 2.3 level of a well-developed story. Among stories for small children too, there are texts at the levels of simple stories, stories with two complete incidents temporally ordered, and two or three well-developed stories, representing a considerable achievement in detailed story- ing, with appropriate explanations and settings for the audience. Thirteen Year Olds The greatest number of narratives, both personal and imaginative, at this age, cluster around the ST 2.3 level of a developed story. Some writers are striving to achieve this, many operate comfortably within this stage, while a few appear to be thrusting beyond it to a fully developed story level ST 2.4. In personal narratives, special occasions are explicitly evaluated in the text, e.g., "a trip I will never forget," "exhausting but still enjoyable," and so on. Narratives centering on a disturbance of probability include a high degree of elaboration and foreshadowing to heighten the story for the reader, and the emotions associated with an incident become a key feature of those accounts that strive towards the ST 2.4 level of storying. Two examples may be given. Lynda (13 years, 3 months) relates the tale of a holiday excursion. She includes detail for her reader and disturbance pervades her text, with a sense of the calm before the storm: Visiting Gozo, the sister island to Malta and Comino might seem pretty boring. Just the normal routine, get on the boat, cross the sea, get off the boat, look around, then come home. That's what I thought until I actually tried it out. We caught the ferry and the journey over the sea was calm and the sky was blue. We crossed with not a care in the world . . . The setting is firmly established, and it is equally clear that the trip is not going to match up to the expectations stated at the beginning. At first, on arrival on Gozo, the visit seems to take the pattern of a tourist trip, again with some details given. During a meal in a cafe it begins to rain. The seriousness of the situation is indicated not by a succession of adjectives about the weather, but by the action of the cafe proprietor:</page><page sequence="10">400 Language Arts my sister went to the toilet and she found the cloakroom was half full of rainwater. She told the cafe owner, who immediately grabbed his money and his bottle of whisky and left The moves of the family and others, from building to building in search of refuge from the flood waters, are carefully detailed (in fact, a sketchmap is supplied - the only illustration drawn by any pupil in any of the assignments). After spending the night on the island, the family return to Malta next day by chartered fishing boat to find similar scenes of devastation there. The writer operates very com- fortably within the ST 2.3 level of storying, with an undoubtedly dramatic tale to tell. Less dramatic in themselves are the narrative events of Peter's script. He travels by van from Norwich to Thetford with fellow members of a brass band to play in a competition. On arrival they have to unload their instruments and music stands, set up on stage, and play their set pieces. The disturbance of the normal pattern comes from the fact that Peter has never played in a competition before, and the impact of the piece comes from the realization in the text of his feelings on such an occasion. Many of my friends had already been to contests and were not worrying, but to be quite honest I was very nervous .... His satisfaction comes from concentrating hard, determined not to "muck things up," rather than from the placing of the band in the contest, which is not in fact revealed. At the end his relief is clear: We done well. "My God" I said to myself, "I'm damn glad thats over!" There is a high degree of awareness of emotion and evaluation of the significance of the situation to the writer at the time. Thus it becomes a story at two levels, the story of events, and the story of emotions, and is working towards ST 2.4 level. The picture stimuli offered this age group a challenge which both daunted and yet intrigued them. They offered sustained narrative responses, of the ST 2.3 and ST 2.4 levels, centered around accidents, murder on religious grounds, bereave- ment, and political struggles, to name but a few disruptions of ordinariness. Again concern with emotion assumes greater importance than in the texts of younger writers, and it is this which raises the storying to two levels, the narrative of events carrying with it a narrative of human emotions. An illustration of this is to be found in a story by James, prompted by a picture of a young girl and a ven- triloquist's dummy. An annual Junior Talent Competition serves as the setting for the narrative of events relating to the contest, but it is also the story of the girl's eventual mastery over her own emotions, ending thus: It was good .... but not good enough a little boy had walked off with the prize but she didn't mind, at least she knew she had the courage to go on stage and perform.</page><page sequence="11">The Disruption of the Probable: Narrative Writing in Children Seven to Thirteen 401 In response to the same picture Claire G. tells a narrative of events when an old man dies, and his daughter, son-in-law, and granddaughter clear out the loft afterwards. Yet the story also represents the granddaughter coming to terms with some of her emotions, and concludes: That night Diane sat Charlie (the puppet) on the windowsill. Just think my grandad made you. Diane thought to herself. "I'll keep you for ever and ever! Thank you Grandad for making puppets!!" The writers themselves are perhaps seeking to understand some of the complexities of the human condition, through their narratives. The human condition on a wider scale pervades some stories in this age group. For Davie (13:8) the political struggle in Poland provides a setting. The actions of one particular rioter in a crowd represent the disturbance of probabilities, entailing what follows for him, and for his family. The completion of his story is brought about by a reunion of the family in jail, though the wider issues remain unresolved in the story, as in life. The stimulus picture for this narrative is clearly that of the family behind a barred window, and it is tempting to infer that the writer sees in it some degree of symbolism for the repression of a nation. Certainly the opening of the narrative encourages the reader to take this wider view, before concentrating on the concrete details of the family in the incidents. The story begins: It was Poland, the winter of discontent 1981. Martial law had been imposed, Lech Wowensa had been put under house arrest by General Yarselski and his fellow millitary leaders. Times move on - it was now May the next year, the people were getting restless. Solidarity, the working people's union was working underground. Then the feelings that had been bottled up inside their selves were let loose. . . . Storying at this level represents ST 2.4, a level that caters to the reader with an elaborated, heightened story, that arouses curiosity and promotes thinking in the reader. In writing imaginative narratives for young children these pupils seemed able to draw on models of "story" and to consider "the story form" as an object. Many texts showed the influence of fairy tale and folklore, where wicked witches receive their just deserts, where abducted princesses are rescued and married by worthy young men. One story, clearly derived from the Little Engine stories of Rev. Awdry, features the modest engine victorious over the large, ostentatious engine. Anthropomorphic tales of mice, hamsters, and a Super Bunny, space stories, and three involving "ordinary people" complete the range. At a straightforward level of storying with considerable detail, Rachel portrays an unhappy girl Amanda, whose happiness is secured when she is allowed to keep a small puppy. Other stories contain indications of storying at literal and symbolic levels. Again there may be a danger of reading out something that the writer did not intend. However, it seems possible that these writers, using as models folktales where good and evil, strength and weakness are cleary symbolized, have found the</page><page sequence="12">402 Language Arts form lends itself to symbolism of their own. Presented with the opportunity of writing in this form for a young audience (thereby removing some of the pressures of adult judgment), a number of writers seem to approach the sym- bolic level. Carol's narrative uses a familiar children's story theme, of the toys in the toy cupboard coming alive at night. The narrative of events contains a developed story in itself, in which the traditional toys sabotage the new-fangled space age toys by removing cogs, springs, and batteries, so that the children will return to their old favorites. At another level an interpretation could be proposed in terms of new versus old ideas, or in terms of protest against the increasing armaments of the modern world, represented in the story by the "anti-stuffed toy missiles" possessed by the space-age toys. Similar concern regarding the nuclear threat is blatantly symbolized in Graeme's text. In a sense, this writer has constructed a modern fairy tale (tinged with political satire?) of the sort that perhaps he would like to be able to believe in. He uses the form of the story of banishment of the evil one and restoration of peace and happiness, as a vehicle for his modern concerns. Suitability for his audience has become less of a concern than the desire to shape meaning for himself. His story is quoted at length: Bad Mr Nuke Gets his Just Reward In a land many miles away a wicked man has his home in an un-used flat. He was banished there a few years ago. His name is Nuclear Missile, but people call him Mr. Nuke. He lives alone in exile now, but not all that many nights ago he lived here in Peaceland. Then, nobody was safe. Before he came we lived a nice peaceful life, with no crimes and wars, in tranquility. But along came Mr. Nuke. He came with a spear and robbed us. Anyone who tried to stop him ended up spearred to death. Next he crossed the seven seas and killed us with swords. Few survived. One month later he attached us with clubs. Soon he dropped bombs on us. Then we decided enough is enough. We formed C.N.D. Most said C.N.D. stood for the Campaign for Nuke's Detention, but I think it stood for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, for if we disarmed him he couldn't kill us. anyway, we took partitions, hundreds signed them, to the Government. They Didn't help. We knew he'd come back soon. Come back he did, but we were ready for him. As he charged down the streets of Peacetime, the biggest town in Peaceland, we through a net over him. We'd got him at last. We flew over the seas and dropped him off ... . From then until today we've been ruled by the S.D. P. or the Safely Defended Party. Peaceland has returned to being peaceful, Peacetime has recovered from Mr. Nuke and we're all happy. In terms of its attempt to capture more than a sequence of events this text shows the writer striving for the ST 2.4 level of storying, and represents an important illustration of the narrative being used to express something important to the writer.</page><page sequence="13">The Disruption of the Probable: Narrative Writing in Children Seven to Thirteen 403 Summary The evidence of this small East Anglia sample of written narratives indicates a progression from the simple chronicle of events, through simple stories based on a disruption of the probabilities, to more highly developed stories. The latter may contain not only more elaboration for the reader but also, in many cases, more than one level of storying - either the stories of events and of emotions, or the stories at the literal and symbolic levels.
