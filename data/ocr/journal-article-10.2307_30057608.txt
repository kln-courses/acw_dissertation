RETAIN - REVERSE - REVALUATE. The first is to Retain: Confidence Consistency timely images very solid body of work exciting at first, then decorative thoughtful understated experimental pedestrian weak offering unsatisfactory in relation to chosen media spiritual These words were uttered few days ago by the artists in relation to art. Whatever else they do, they all signify the perceiver as a receptacle of perceptions and judgements in relation to a work of visual art. Yet, our perceptions are always flawed one way or another. More so, if recalled by memory: recently, I have shaken the hand of a man who twenty years ago agreed that a listening device be placed in my home. Roddy - a post-graduate student of mine - almost embraced a man who was again free, after some time in prison for mugging him. It has nothing to do with the Christian axiom of forgiveness, and all to do with selective forgetting and with controlling expectations. Memory thus has more uncertainty than a perception, and perception has no certainty of the real. Controlling expectations based on memory have, therefore, triple uncertainty. Many artists have placed on record the importance of memory in their work. Childhood, so fashionable after Freud, early 'ethnic' states, so lusted after by the well-off white mainstream culture, and, of course, some fragments from the past of each particular region, are often pressed hard to become some sort of anchor for the memories. Some memories are referred to as tradition. Tradition behaves like a container. It embraces different things, but not in any particularly clear or stable order. Its instability is its most desired aspect. When a society turns a tradition into a stable state, the artists of that period cannot deliver. As an example, perhaps, the case of socialist realism in the Soviet Union between Zdanov and Brezhnev will suffice. Many political artists, with the best intentions on their part, must get rid of the fluency and dynamics of the three R's mentioned in the title of this essay. I have in mind even the admirable H. Haacke (and Leo Steinberg's essay in H. Haacke, The Unfinished Business. RETAIN The 'retain' particle of the title is history, memory, perception here and now of a kind of three-dimensional matrix of time and space. Three-dimensional, because we are three-dimensional people, not because the world is three-dimensional. It probably is not. See for example Koji Miyazaki's computing of 'Visualisation of a Die and Other Objects in Four- Dimensional Space.' (Leonardo, Vol 21, Nol, 1988, pp 56-60) Retaining is a contradictory process: it is sometimes like an imprint, sometimes like a chore of repeating 100 times an irregular Latin verb; in both cases it is scarred by judgement, analogous to 'this is food and that is poison'. Retaining one's roots, one's culture, one's national identity is understood mostly as necessary for survival, and as flawlessly positive. Artists were praised for locking such ideas in their work, and thus, making those understandings immortal. Yet ever since the peak of industrialised society, artists deliberately introduced opposite ideas, Writing Ulster 17</page><page sequence="3">Above left: Nicola Russel ENNISKILLEN TRIPTYCH (detail) February 1989.

Modernism in visual arts therefore turned to 'nature' as the primary theme. Nevertheless, its conceptual core was a man-bound enterprise. Even in Picasso's work, the themes are dominantly about man and the Other. In the three more clearly recognisable phases there are three more clearly recognisable man-bound ideas: during the Blue period it is the relationship between I and the affluent society; during the 1930s it is the relationship between oppressed and oppressing; in the later work it is the relationship between art and nature, both designated by the art and nature, both designated by the artist. There is a significant neutralisation of the collective in the first and third periods, as if in agreement with Max Beckmann's warning that "The great danger threatening all mankind is that of collectivisation'. Considering industrialisation and expansion - people made one of two judgements: either it is progress or it is a crisis. The first became a sign of material affluence, end of hunger, and is still very much desired by many people outside Western culture. In spite of their and our becoming more and more aware of the price to be paid for it, material wealth is perceived as a positive goal. The artists who engage in an investigation of this, face among other problems that described so aptly by Jean Baudrillard: the signs become murderers of the real. E.g. the progress in question facilitated the growth of world population from under two billion people around 1900 to more than 5 billion at present and was paid for inter alia by destruction of half the world's existing, rain forest. The number of people is expected to double by 2050. There is not enough of the rain forest left to pay for that. Western culture in its anthropomorphism prefers to overlook such consequences. The Sunday Times, (May 1990) dismissed as scaremongering the beliefs of 300 leading scientists on the greenhouse gases. But on the evidence of a dead cat and one professor's conclusion the newspaper supported the slaughter of 6 million cows, who were made ill by the feed produced by people. To me this illustrates not some forgivable mistake, but a historical stage, during which mankind established human dimensions across the existential plane, but during which the world itself started asserting other dimensions. I am thinking here of that, what Martin Heidegger described as the stubborn, irreducible element in the world. (PLT, 364). Consequently the early abstraction (For example Kandinsky) born out of oppistion to material wealth and industrial progress has an objective value in history in its attack on the sign. It coincided with Lenin's analysis of the crisis of western society and the first attempt to engineer a more just society. The project, however, was flawed from the beginning by retaining both the aim and means of the western industrial society. The artists, recognising this, stayed idealistically on the side of the 'crisis'. Their solution, as the recent exhibition of Mondrian and the modern ideal at Venice (next to the Palladio's church of San Girgio Maggiore with its exquisite Tintorettos) documented, achieved aesthetic force able to transform consciousness. Locked in the 'perfection' of the universal language that art failed to engage the perceivers in transformation of the cultural reality. Not surprisingly Paul Klee noted: ' but the people are not with us'. It would appear that the 'retain' in my title is a flawed process because of its dependence on both the judgement of the past and the relationship to Writing Ulster 19</page><page sequence="5">Left: Anthony Hill WITHOUT WALLS, A sculpture installation with words market street Downpatrick Below left: Janet Ledsham (1944) SUNSHINE AND SHADOWS (detail) 137cm x 137cm Handmade felt incorporating natural material and written text, hand and machine stitching.

However, the two are the two concerns which determine the artist's position within and towards culture. While such considerations were man- bound, the debate did not cross over to the questions of the consequences of the actions. To some extent this was guaranteed by beliefs like: God created man in his own image. The power of such ideology neutralised the power of images to transform the way we relate to Earth. Even so, it is significant that some western artists were working on strategies to change that, over the last 100 years or so. Equally significantly, they turned to other cultures, so-called primitive cultures, in a deliberate subversion, reversal of values. REVERSE If the retention depends on a value judgement, the reversal is an almost mechanical exercise. Whatever it is that society insists on retaining, needs to be considered from the point of view of opposites. Philip Vann (Peter Katt Publications, 1990) observed, for example, that a group of younger artists called 'The Obstinates' established in Prague in 1987, wished to 'circumvent creaky official cultural dictates' (Three contemporary Czechoslovakian artists) and went on to state that their work possessed qualities 'absent in the ... external world: those of wonder, beauty, awe, myth, poetry.' On this evidence, the world stood still since 1912 - Kandinsky's observation of absences in the world, as the real theme for a painting. Both, significantly, add to Baudrillard's explanation of the process by which the mass media become 'weightless'. However, the two cases illustrate the will of the artist to work out a reversal. The second R in the title of this essay is less contradictory, but it is equally difficult, because it presupposes pluralism. To reverse the Man-bound culture into the Earth-bound culture demands shifts from the emphasis on the Other, to the emphasis on being in the world, on the need, so to speak, to articulate ideas in the language of the Earth. In political life, the old Stalinist idea on the division of the world into two camps as something to be worked for, is being replaced by the idea of the 'house of being' containing us all and all animals and plants equally. In turn it calls for a person's ability to take responsibility for something which is not directly his or her 'business'. As Jan Patocka (a Czech philosopher who signed the Charter 77) proposed: the real trial is not how one fulfils a role which one invents, but how one fulfils a role which is presented by fate. Another formulation has been offered by the playwright turned president Vaclav Havel: 'An act of man becomes really important only if it grew from the soil of clear consciousness of temporariness and ephemerality of all humans - only such consciousness could breathe an eventual greatness into it.' His open letter to the then president Husak (1975) contains many more significant and timely thoughts. In central European countries the agenda may appear at this stage clouded by the 'aftermath of the cramped and even distorted imagination' (Nadine Gordimer, 1990). The western artists' agenda is, as M. Pasteka observed at the Venice Biennale in 1990, more advanced. During my recent lecture tour in Czechoslovakia one observation pressed itself more and more dominantly into my perception of the 'here and now'. The research accomplished by the Post-Modernists is appropriate to the needs of the society that changes itself. In itself it indicates some sameness among the two blocks. Nevertheless, its Writing Ulster 21</page><page sequence="7">Above: David Ledsham (1944) A drawing from the Bitumin Saints Series 1980 - 1984, A4, pen on paper Left: Padraig McCann (1963) BORDERING PERSONS 1989 (detail) 10ft x 12ft, oil on canvas Below: Alistair Wilson (1951) CLOUD POOL, 1990, height 20 ", cement fondue and wax 22 Writing Ulster</page><page sequence="8">startling appropriateness to a different culture puts question marks all round the assumptions of the importance of the socio-historical character of a region in its production of art. When Stuart Hall (in a keynote speech to the Annual Conference of Art Historians, in London, in 1889) investigated the importance of the 'difference' he was clearly responding to the marginalisation of cultures by a dominant culture, and received support, because his claim appeared as an absolutely just one. The world however is racing ahead of this. The trees are dying faster than we can print calls for a just stewardship of the Earth. I confess that the saying 'this is not worth the paper it is written on' is having a totally different meaning for me now; I feel uneasy to write and publish. Michael Sandle's 'A mighty blow for freedom: F*** the Media' (1990, Royal Academy Summer Exhibition) entertains a similar sentiment about the use of electricity. Among the exhibits in Manchester's Cornerhouse (Posters of Perestrojka) we see a paraphrase of Diirer's print of Adam and Eve with skeletons of animals and birds around them. Vladimir Grishchenko (born 1955) added words: 'Homo Sapiens? Rational Man? In recent years as a result of man's activity the planet has lost one to ten species of animals and one species of plant every week.' Why is it then, that art at present entertains old ideologies and old values? Very likely because those two are linked to the idea of personal identity, personal freedom and personal well being. People do not feel comfortable in the universe, or in the pluralist multinational society. The virus (Neal Ascherson's expression) of communal hatred is preferred to the insecurities of being together and caring together for the world. Consequently the differences among us are hailed as 'solutions' to the dignified co-existence of people with people. Maybe - but art based on this misses the point. What is the point? REVALUATE The third R in the title - revaluation of values. During the last two decades two strategies have opened up that process more clearly than others: feminist art and performance art. While the feminists added to the agenda of western production a set of concerns, they did not abandon its man-bound concepts. Those defined ought to be described as woman-bound to signify the difference. The Performance art in using time and the human body held more promise to become Earth-bound. An intensification of this strategy by installations added or left in place moved it also back into the sphere of the wealth of objects. The heap of shoes in an installation at the Orchard Gallery (A. MacLennan, 1982) had the role of a metaphor. The oversized casts of boots in the Polish pavilion at the Venice Biennale are emphases on the experience of Auschwitz and World War II (J. Szajna, born 1922, heavily involved in the theatre). Writing about Szajna, Jerzy Madeyski pointed out that the objects made for the installation are there to 'record and express emotions of their creator'. In that the work is on the retaining level, reaching neither the reversal nor the revaluation of values. Nevertheless in Szejna's willingness to have the objects broken up, destroyed, he introduced a revaluation of the value of a work of art. It has been deemed as precious, unique and eventually expensive. When both MacLennan, who comes to drawing from performance art, and Szajna, who comes to sculpture from the theatre, Writing Ulster 23</page><page sequence="9">Top: Elaine Thomas, ALPHABET 1988 drawing on paper, cut-outs Above: Una Walker, Installation: Harvest, detail, 1986, wood, clay, plants Below left: Ronnie Hughes (1965) NOT WINGS, 1989 84" x 102" oil and was on canvas Below right: Sharon Kelly, CONFIRMATION AND DENIAL 1989 6 1/2' x 4'mixed media 24 Writing Ulster</page><page sequence="10">agree on the ephemerality of art - we have strategy which revaluates. As for the feminism: David Lister (The Independent, 30 May, 1990,) reports on a survey carried out by the Women's Arts Research Group in Merseyside: only 402 paintings by women out of 11,888 were in the permanent collections of the galleries in the region. In arts management men took 64% of places. Probably all white. No wonder that many women joined forces and tried to put things right. For me, however, the most important contribution of feminism is the enlargement of the 'genetic pool' of visual art: interests and concerns that men artists did not think of, or did not think important. (Feminist concerns introduced since 1970 included a paradigmatic shift in the notion of women's art. Until then, it had been either marginalised of made invisible.) For example: the recent exhibition at Barbican, London 'The Pursuit of The Real' (May - July 1990) has been perceived as sustaining 'what is often proposed as the pictorial ethic: an insistence on the virtue of the eye, of taking a long, hard and searching look at something' (Tom Lubbock, The Independent, 13 May, 1990. On the evidence, it could be perceived as a male gaze. Investigating into its female counterpart may prove enriching. And indeed, many contemporary women artists deal with this. I would like to mention three as an example. Yoko Ono - as a part of the Fluxux exhibition on the island of Giudecca, opposite the San Marco square - made a series of wooden crosses with a circular mirror mounted on the crossing. Above it in a black felt pen she wrote in one of her languages a sentence, which in English read: Make a wish when the sun hits. Her idea of joining nature and manmade form with time and nature is thankfully Earthbound, but the emphasis on the wish turns it into a man-bound art. In addition - when the crosses were on the pavement in front of the old grain stores, being her height they carried the poetry of her white figure walking among and around them. Once lifted on the roof - their scale could cope with neither the nearness (they were not clearly visible, but from the boat) nor with the distance across the waterway. It was difficult to make them out on the skyline of the building. It is, of course, possible to see it as an error in choosing the scale. This reading is, however, weakened by the other exhibits she placed inside the building: a telescope, when looked into, revealed a text: don't look at me, I am only small. Consequently, smallness may be one concern linking both exhibits together. If so, there are some implications for the female variant of looking: oscillation between 'how you want to see me' and 'how I want you to see me'. In both cases, she asserts the second as the final. Jenny Holzer, recipient of the prize for the best presentation at the Venice Biennale, involves several types of looking in her work . At the Marco Polo Airport, at the Santa Lucia Railway Station and in two rooms in the USA national pavilion the look needed is that of the traveller, a nomad, trying to work out what to do next, how to get to one's destination. The speed of the light emitting diode boards coupled with three colours introduces further discomfort laced with satisfaction when the text is understood: Protect me from what I want Private property created crime Expiring for love is beautiful but stupid Abuse of power comes as no surprise Action causes more trouble than thought Boredom makes you do crazy things Categorizing fear is calming Eating too much is criminal It is man's fate to outsmart himself Writing Ulster 25</page><page sequence="11">It's a gift to the world not to have babies Raise boys and girls the same way and so on.

"I knew it was theoretically possible to leave things for people and you could actually stop them in their tracks... If you want to reach a general audience, it's not art issues that are going to compel them to stop on their way to lunch, it has to be life issues." (Jenny Holzer and Diane Waldman, Interview in the catalogue. Jenny Holzer, NY 1989. When she writes "I do not want to be a human" (one of the Laments, 1986- 1989) the reader shares that possibility. This is not art that requires an intense look, but it does require a look necessary to read and make a judgement. It is a scanning and reflective look at the same time. Lynne Davies-Jones (born 1956) is a painter with an exceptional mastery of colour. Her art grows not from soil but from water and light. She once compared the way a cobalt moved around an ochre to a 'way sea would move over the stones'. The artist appears investigating how nature works. To that end she concentrates on colour induction (a psychological phenomenon: we see more colours than are there) and composition. Both result in oscillation of two readings, the same edge of a paper is both revealed and obscured. The obscuring happens from a different viewing distance, when two tonal values blend. Changing position the viewer will reach one from which both the revealing and obscuring will be visible. The kind of look needed here is not an intense looking, or the traveller's reading/scanning look, but a reflective questioning look, an analogy to philosophy (the 'if' constructions). Taking Holzer's suggestion on the importance of life issues - the changing of position and resulting double meaning could be found in the life of Northern Ireland, where Lynne Davies- Jones lives and works. A demographic change is taking place. In the 1981 census almost 280,000 refused to state their denomination. Consequently what does or does not constitute the majority and minority is becoming more and more uncertain. Also, there is a change in marriage behaviour: the Catholics are assimilating the marriage behaviour of the Protestants, but keep their own high birth rate. This introduces another uncertainty into the ratio between the so called two communities. The implication is that the strategy, which the artist needs for the viewing of her work is similar to that adopted by the people living here: obscuring and revealing, depending on the position. Lynne Davies-Jones's work for the feminist exhibition 'Identities' (1987) consisted of two exhibits: one placed above the fireplace in the gallery was made out of coloured tissue paper; the other in a cow shed near her home in County Down. In both she revived 'woman's work' but to a different end in each. The paper work above the fireplace is steeped in a domesticity as much as the oriental sensitivity towards paper represents incorporation of her response to the birth of her son and to the memories of her own childhood. The baby's and later the toddler's preference for garish colours led her to question her own sophistication. In addition, she remembered her mother's front room in which all kinds of objects and all kinds of colours were allowed to clash. This habitual, and class-based, cultural form of 'matching the impossible' (the turn of phrase used in colloquial English to substitute for 'The Troubles') offered itself as a strategy for so-called high art. The artists invented a unit, a small 26 Writing Ulster</page><page sequence="12">rectangle, onto which freely composed colour marks were made. A number of such units were then matched together into a large painting, that could be installed either on the floor or on a ceiling. This action propels the Front Room aesthetics from life to art and to life again. There are two theoretical points I would like to make in conclusion on the three Rs: The revaluation of values is not as advanced has it needs to be. The force that is eminently suitable to assist had been isolated during the 1930s, coming out of the demise of the promise of the first socialist revolution. It is, in the terminology of the most prominent theoretician who dealt with it (Jan Mukarovsky): the aesthetic function. He describes it as an energy that changes directions and positions. In the world, physics knows such energy as the quantum. The uncertainty principle explains why the energy of quarks inside protons cannot be fixed and how it is possible that at times, but not always, the quarks with low energy can make a transition to electrons with different directions, anti-electrons. Mukarovsky actually speaks of norm and antinorm to locate the two different directions of the aesthetic function. The quarks have, perhaps analogous particles in the strategies of looking, of matching tastes, etc. This needs further work. But it is significant that during this century both science and art came up with a similar scheme of things; moreover that the principles of uncertainty and of dual direction apply both to the Earth and Art. If, then, the call is given to rally around an Earth- bound concept of art, it should be protected against the charge of fashion or political interest. The second point follows from the acceptance of the first one. In the way in which art had to abandon heavens with the deities, and man with his psychoanalysis, the truth of the presentation is going to belong to the Earth. Therefore, it is not a mal de siecle, it is, however, war on totality in any form. That is the sociological fact, we are not governed by gentlemen. We must learn how to overcome our weakness for material wealth. Kurosawa calls this much admired quality konjo - a fact which can be taken as evidence for the circle of sameness around the globe. Perhaps even aesthetics itself will engage in the revaluation of values, and take a leaf or two from Tyrs and Markalous, two tiny quarks when seen from this culture.
