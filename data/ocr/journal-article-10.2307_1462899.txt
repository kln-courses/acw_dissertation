<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of the American Academy of Religion, LI/1 The Human Way: A Dialogical Approach to Religion and Human Experience Maurice Friedman eligion, for me, is neither objective philosophy nor subjective experi- ence. It is lived reality ontologically prior to its expression in creed, ritual, and group. At the same time, it is inseparable from these expressions and cannot be distilled out and objectified in itself. The religious at this deepest level might be described as a basic attitude or relationship arising in the encounter with the whole reality directly given to one in one's existence. The task of philosophy of religion for me is a conceptual clarifica- tion of and a metaphorical pointing to the religious reality known in the "between" without abstracting from that meeting detached statements about the nature and attributes of God and without doing injustice to the typical and the unique apprehended in the phenomenological study of the history of religions. If religion is a way that man walks, then the whole of human life is included in it. Yet that life comes to wholeness not additively or by abstrac- tion but only in the upsurging of events in which all the moments of the past are caught up into the present and given new reality by it. Such an event could be an hour of prayer at a time of great need-when we are facing death or are facing the death of loved ones. Or it could be a moment of breathtaking awe before a waterfall or in the midst of a raging storm at sea. Or it could be an action in which we gather together all the past mean- ings of our lives in one great hour of devotion or sacrifice. In all cases, it is an event in which we attain "selflessness" not by giving up the self, as the ascetics suggest that we do, but by the totality of our response. In such a totality we are taken out of ourselves, called out by something to which we Maurice Friedman is Professor of Religious Studies, Philosophy, and Comparative Literature at San Diego State University. He has published extensively on Martin Buber and on issues in the philosophy of religion. The present article is based on a recent book with the same title (Chambersburg, Pa.: Anima Publications, 1982).</page><page sequence="2">68 Journal of the American Academy of Religion respond so fully and spontaneously that our self is neither our aim nor our concern but only the self-understood and self-evident ground of our responding. It is the event itself which again and again gives rise to religious mean- ing, and only out of that meaning, apprehended in our own history and the history of past generations that we have made present to ourselves, do reli- gious symbols and theological interpretations arise. For this reason, I cannot follow the call for a return to traditional theology as an antidote to the excessive naturalism and restrictive "humanism" of the recent past. I believe in a larger humanism which is defined not by negation of transcendent reality but precisely by the fact that it negates nothing and is open to the concrete and unique even if it should manifest itself, as William James puts it, "in the very dirt of private fact." This "theology as event" is much more modest than traditional theology and metaphysics in that it claims to know nothing about what God is "in Himself." This is not so great a sacrifice as it might at first appear if one holds, as I do, that the philosopher does not have access to absolute Truth but only a relation to truth and that the revelations of which the theologian speaks do not put us in firm possession of the "essence" of God but speak to us in and out of particular historical situations. We can also say of theology as event that it makes a staggering claim, namely, that it is in our human life that we apprehend the divine-not through sacred times and places and rituals alone but in the everyday happening, "the days of our years." To speak of religion as event in no way means to reduce religion to ethics. It means only that our total existence is involved in religion, that it is not some sacred upper story that has nothing to do with the rest of our lives. If the matrix of religion is the event which gives rise to what I call "touchstones of reality," then we may expect to find in legend, myth, and tale as faithful and full an expression of religious reality as in creed, ritual, and social group. This presupposes, of course, that legends, myths, and tales are not illustrations of preexisting abstract ideas but that ideas, on the contrary, are monological and static abstractions from the dramatic, dialogical reality of the event, some part of which is still preserved in legend, myth, and tale. In Cosmos and History Mircea Eliade sets in opposition the archetypal, cyclical approach to time of archaic man, which in the last analysis nullifies history and with it any uniqueness of event, with the historical, linear approach of modern man which he sees as abandoning us in the end to the terror of history. Archaic humanity defended itself with all the weapons at its disposal against that very novelty and irreversibility that make up the essence of historical time. The archaic, or "primitive," man, like the mystic and the religious person in general, lives in a continual present in which he relives and repeats the gestures of another and, through this repetition, lives always in an atemporal present. Though historical man might reproach</page><page sequence="3">Friedman: The Human Way 69 archaic man with having sacrificied creativity through remaining impris- oned within the mythical horizon of archetypes and repetition, archaic man (speaking through Elaide) sees modern man as without defenses against the terror of history and, so far from being able to make history, as totally com- pelled and controlled by it. In contrast to the sorry fate of modern "histori- cal" man, archaic man "is free to be no longer what he was, free to annul his own history through periodic abolition of time and collective regeneration." We must distinguish between the validity of Eliade's thesis as the description of many archaic and not-so-archaic religious doctrines and as the overall point of view to which he wishes to elevate it. As he himself recog- nizes, what is in question here is a matter of interpretation, i.e., each set of facts may be interpreted from the standpoint of the other. My own claim that archetypes are themselves born of historical events in no way inval- idates those religions and myths that do rest upon an archetypal point of view where all history is removed to sacred space and sacred time. But it does invalidate Eliade's claim that all religious myth must be of this nature in favor of the recognition of the historical and/or existential kernel even of universal myths. Eliade nowhere discusses faith as existential trust but sees it basically as a world-view which posits the existence of God and deduces from this the transhistorical meaning of history. What is more, he regards historical and linear time only from the "apocalyptic" standpoint and not at all from the "prophetic." The time of the true prophet is not illud tempus but the experi- enced hour and its possibility. That of the apocalyptic writer is an inevitable future in which history is overcome. The prophetic approach to history "promises a consummation of creation," the apocalyptic "its abrogation and supersession by another world completely different in nature" (Martin Buber). Though Eliade recognizes a difference between the archaic and antihis- torical religions and the historical ones, in the end he takes the antihistorical as the normative approach in all religions. He offers as the objective conclusions of the historian of religion what is, in fact, in William James's phrase, the passionate choice of a "live forced option." There are, indeed, myths that have come loose from both the historical and the existential kernel that gave rise to them. This latter type of myth, in its regular recurrence, gives rise to the perennial philosophies and theories of archetypes. But even here, as Buber has said, "myth must verify itself in man and not man in myth." The archetypes too have a human base and arise out of the loam of earthly, human existence. This in no way denies the archetypes, but it roots them in the lived concrete rather than in some Platonic universal or some mystical sphere floating above time and history. In this sense, we may echo Buber's words: "What is wrong is not the mythicization of reality which brings the inexpressible to speech, but the gnosticizing of myth which tears it out of the ground of history and biography in which it took root." What is inexpressible is that betweenness</page><page sequence="4">70 Journal of the American Academy of Religion that lies at the heart of the life of dialogue. Myth is the pure form of the meeting. It points us back to the immediacy as no concepts could. All that we have said about theology as event and myth finds its proper root in "touchstones of reality," a phrase which I first expounded in the book of that name. "Touchstones of reality" imply no prior definition of "reality" nor any metaphysical absolute. Yet "touchstones of reality" cannot be reduced to any current form of subjectivism-whether it be that of cultural relativism, psychologism, Freudian psychoanalysis, behaviorism, Sartrian existentialism, or linguistic analysis. There is no touch independent of con- tact with otherness, an otherness that transcends subjectivity even though it cannot be known without it. Touchstones of reality must be made true ever again by testing them in each new situation-bringing the life-stance they have produced into a moment of present reality. The link between the imageless God and the human image becomes particularly concrete in touchstones of reality; for our touchstones of reality are themselves the bond between the absolute and the particular, the embodiment of symbol in the lived life of actual persons. We do not have to put aside particularity and the reality of time, therefore, to find our touchstones of reality; for they have to do with the full seriousness of the moment. The fact that this moment will not come again does not mean it is unreal or illusory. On the contrary, it is the one thing that is given us to make real. In the chapter on religious symbolism in Touchstones of Reality: Exis- tential Trust and the Community of Peace (New York: E. P. Dutton, 1972), I coin the term the via humana to set in contrast with the two traditional approaches-the via positiva which describes the attributes of God and the via negativa which emphasizes the utter unknowability of God and speaks only of what God is not: The importance of touchstones of reality as an approach is that it does not claim to be the absolute truth, but it also does not abandon us to some completely subjective relativism. It witnesses to as much reality as we can witness to at that moment. In opposition to both the via negativa and the via positiva, therefore, I would make bold to call touchstones of reality the via humana. Only through it can we keep close to the concrete reality, without pursuing theology at the expense of the fully human or humanism at the expense of closing man off from the name- less reality that he meets in his meeting with everyday life. (232-33) Our contact with the reality of the "between" arises only in, and insepa- rably from, our contact with the existing beings that move to meet us as we them. Touchstones of reality originate in events, and most of the events of our lives are events with others. Touchstones have a two-sidedness which is at the same time a form of immediacy. They are the literal result of our touching on the otherness of the other, and something of that otherness remains with us in any true touchstone even after the contact has ceased to be present. If we must continually go on probing, proving, testing, and</page><page sequence="5">Friedman: The Human Way 71 authenticating our touchstones, this can only be done in relationship to oth- ers and in partnership with them. Therefore, the very metaphor of "touch- stones of reality" already implies a mutual touching-a touching on the touching of the other, a "dialogue of touchstones." Although we cannot say with what we have contact minus the touching, in that very touching we go through and beyond subjective experiencing to a meeting with otherness. As I have written in Touchstones of Reality: "When two people really touch each other as persons-whether physically or not-the touching is not merely a one-sided impact: it is a mutual revelation of life-stances." Touchstones of reality cannot be described or articulated in such a way that they can be objectively handed over, for they always include the full- ness of the situation and the component of our unique response to them. The touchstones of others, like our own, are personal revelations and witnesses to existential truth. We do not need to use the same words as others or even to affirm that beneath our different words and images we really mean the same thing in order to share a meaningful religious fellowship. Real religious fellowship does not begin with creed or catechism but with genuine trust. We receive from each other without ever being identical with each other; we are able to affirm and respond to what we receive, and grow through it. Some religions, to be sure, seek to articulate abstract criteria of faith and creed. But unless those abstractions are rooted in lived tradition and lived community of trust, they are worthless. The true fellowship of the committed who can meet and talk with one another because they really care about one another and the common goal they are serving, however differently that goal may be stated, is often found not within but across organization, institutional, and denominational lines. If this is so, then the answer to the dilemma of the multiplicity of religions is not a new universalism or a new absolutism, nor even some "perennial philosophy" that claims to have found the true essence of all religions, but a faithful pluralism-a mutually confirming dialogue of touchstones. Is this not a hopelessly ideal approach in the face of the cultural relativ- ism that reduces our society to a congeries of babbling voices, each asserting itself against the other, each claiming sole truth or denying all truth? Not if we recognize that relativism is only the other side of the same coin as abso- lutism, that the relativist is the disappointed absolutist who says that if I cannot have one absolute truth, then I shall deny that there is any truth at all. We still long for what Dostoevsky's Grand Inquisitor calls the "unani- mous ant heap," a universal religion that will give us the security and com- fort of never having to stand our own ground and think for ourselves. If we are honest with ourselves, we shall recognize that such a universal religion is neither possible nor desirable. The longing for it is a throwback to the desire for a universal, objective Truth which we possess rather than a touchstone of reality arrived at through obedient listening and faithful responding. If we look dispassionately at the contemporary scene, what is</page><page sequence="6">72 Journal of the American Academy of Religion more, we shall recognize that not only are there a great many competing religions that show not the slightest trace of merging into one, but also that there are many things that compete with religions for our attention and devotion in such a way that they, too, must be accounted "religions" in the sense of idols that claim our ultimate allegiance and swallow up our total existence. It little matters whether that idol be money, moloch, magic, mate- rialism, the family, the party, the nation, or even the new world order. If we return to the adherents of the religions themselves, we find that even the seeming "agreement" among the members of particular churches and syna- gogues and religious fellowships is often only illusory. People confess the "same" faith, meaning totally different things by it, or meaning nothing at all. For the via humana the only truth that we can hope to possess is a human one. To say this implies no degradation of truth or even relativiza- tion. It does imply a humanization of truth, one that robs it of its false claim to literalness, "dogma," and absoluteness. We cannot possess the Absolute but we can stand in relation to it, and our human truth is the product of that relation. "Meaning," to the via humana, does not lie in any Weltan- schauung, or world view, but in existential trust. This trust is not a trust that something is the case nor is it any evolutionary process, however attractive that view is to us moderns. Touchstones of reality and the dialogue of touch- stones in which we share, encounter, and make our own the touchstones of others, are our ultimate source of knowledge. We cannot possess even human truth as a secure continuity. But we can have a relationship with it. We can allow it to be the finger pointing at the moon, or the way in which the Maggid laces and unlaces his felt shoes. There is, to be sure, a relation between our truths-our touchstones of reality-both those we experience in our own lives and those we encounter in the lives of others. But this is not a relation of abstract and timeless consis- tency. Rather, our old touchstones can be reaffirmed in each new situation- not as the same but as illuminated and transformed by the new. In each new discovery or rediscovery our earlier touchstones are brought into the fullness of the present. This we can affirm, but we must avoid the illusion that in our concrete existence we can rise to a reference point above the dimension of time-an abstract spatiality divorced from events. Hence, the re-cognition of God and the re-affirmation of truth are ultimately the same: both are known again in concrete uniqueness, not in abstract sameness. This leads us to a hierachy of criteria of truth. Objectivizing, structuring, formulating are essential in carrying forward our truths. Yet if we content ourselves with them alone, we lose our own touchstones. We must take the further step of bringing the old touchstones into the new. Therefore, our ultimate criterion of meaning and truth is not the objectification of a structure but the lived new meeting with reality. The alternation between immediacy and mediacy, between dialogue and</page><page sequence="7">Friedman: The Human Way 73 objectification makes up our existence and our religious way. Ultimately, however, we must choose-whether to enregister everything in some comprehensive gnosis or to take our stand on an existential trust that cannot pretend to get its arms around the creation on which it stands. There is a tendency to confuse two different kinds of meaning-a comprehensive world view, or Weltanschauung, which gives us a sense of intellectual security, and the meaning that arises moment by moment through our meeting with a reality that we cannot embrace. Many people when they have a religious or mystical experience move quickly to a metaphysics and identify their experience with one particular philosophy of religion or of mysticism. Not content with having found meaning in immediacy, they want to wrap up reality in some conceptual totality. Perhaps one of the most important witnesses that can be made in our day is that it is not necessary to have a Weltanschauung, a comprehensive world view, in order to be able to live as a human being. This means, in terms of theology, that our stance, our life- attitude, is more basic than the affirmation or nonaffirmation of a "Being" or "ground of being." No intellectual construction, not even the philosophy of dialogue, can ever include the real otherness, of the other. In meeting the other, I come up against something irreducible that I cannot register in my categories. A God whom I could meet apart from my meeting with otherness might be a God-idea but not the true God. The real God is not the God whom man removes into the sphere of his own spirit and thought, but the creator who speaks to man through creatures that exist for their own sake and not just for human purposes. If religion were pure dialogue and pure immediacy, there would be no need for a philosophy of religion, but neither would there be any such thing as religious forms and structures, traditions, and organizations. Actually religion is made up of a complex interaction between immediacy and form, flowing and structure, and the real issues are not the choice between the one side and the other but the nature of the blend, which often adds up to the emphasis that is needed at any given historical juncture. An adequate philosophy of religion must be concerned with both dialogue and dialectic, meaning by the latter the swinging interaction between the immediacy of dialogue and the mediacy of structure and form. This dialectic must be understood on many different levels. It takes place even within the individual person, who cannot persist in immediacy of dialogue and who uses touchstones of reality, insights, symbols, and concepts both as residues of earlier moments of dialogue and helpers to enter into new dialogue. For the master and disciple, the brotherhood, the tribe, the church, synagogue, denomination, and sect, this dialectic is multifaceted and multileveled. What is more, the concern for continuance-for the preserva- tion and perseverance of the religious tradition-regularly makes the emphasis upon form and structure so great that the dialectic itself is endan- gered, and what is passed down is a set of structures and forms which no</page><page sequence="8">74 Journal of the American Academy of Religion longer move back to that immediacy which gave rise to them. We cannot find touchstones of reality by going back to tradition. We can only find them through renewing tradition, through making it living again in the present. "Not our forebears, but we here, the living, stand on Mount Sinai to receive the Covenant." This does not mean that there is no difference or tension between our forebears and us. If we attempt to "con- tinue" tradition without holding the tension between the traditional and the contemporary, we lose the tension that makes such handing down, the origi- nal meaning of "tradition," fruitful. Only when we have three elements- our personal uniqueness, the will to be open, and holding the tension with tradition-is there a meaningful dynamic. We must fight and contend with tradition in order to make an honest witness to our own uniqueness and to all the absurdity and incongruity that has entered into our lives. If cutting off from tradition is one danger, there is an equal danger in retaining the time-hallowed symbols yet reading into them new meaning so freely that, like Peter Pan's shadow, it is sewed onto the old. "Forms in themselves are nothing," Buber has written, once they have been cut off from their origin, that which pervaded them as the soul pervades the body. "Once they have grown empty, one cannot fill them with a new, timely content; they will not hold it. Once they have decayed, they cannot be resuscitated by infusion with a spirit other than their own." Today, more often than not, the new spirit with which the old form is infused is that of psychology of one kind or another. This has led me to a concern with the limits of the psyche as touchstone of reality. This concern does not imply that it is illegitimate for a psychologist to express his or her views on religion. What we are focusing on here, rather, is the tendency for psychologists and their theological adapters to bolster these new psy- chological insights by recasting them in old forms, putting new wine into old skins. There has always been a problem of tradition and modernity, since tradition is an organically growing and changing phenomenon, and all great religions have witnessed the passing on of religious insights and teachings to people whose land, culture, language, and life-conditions were vastly differ- ent from those among whom the religion originally arose. What is different about our contemporary problem of tradition and modernity is, first, as we have seen, that for many psychology has taken the place that philosophy, theology, or the physical and biological sciences held in other ages. Second, the contemporary thinker and seeker are exposed to a vast array of conflict- ing and interacting cultures, philosophies, psychologies, and religious tradi- tions, which often leads to universalist formulations rather than to that mutually confirming pluralism for which I call. Third, the tension between "religion" and "science" and the triumph of secularism have led many to a conscious reevaluation which accomplishes the transvaluation of meaning that in past ages took place unconsciously.</page><page sequence="9">Friedman: The Human Way 75 Tradition is a dialogue, and there is no way that we can bring ourselves into identity with the founders of a tradition. Yet the necessity of respond- ing from where we are can be done with full consciousness of the tension between the present and the past and of the difficult task of making the past living again in the present. Or it can be done without faithfulness to the original tradition in such a way that the tensions are covered over and sleight-of-hand reinterpretations are sneaked in under the cover of harmo- nizing ancient religion and modern thought. In a dialogical approach to religion the ultimate touchstone is the imme- diacy of contact with ultimate reality, whether that contact be made in prayer, cult, creed, or the countless concrete happenings of the everyday. All religious tradition is carried on by a dialectic between immediacy and mediacy, directness and indirectness, dialogue and intellectual dialectic, spirit and form. One of the ways in which this dialectic expresses itself is in what I call the paradox of religious leadership. The religious leader is a central concern in any phenomenological study of religion. Approached dialogically, this concern necessarily deepens into the contemplation of a phenomenon which is by its very nature problematic and even paradoxical. This phenomenon is not that of the inauthentic religious leaders who through all time have usurped divine authority for very human ends of power, wealth, fame, or repression. It is, rather, that of the authentic reli- gious leader. The authentic religious leader genuinely wants to lead his or her charges to greater immediacy in their dialogue with the divine. Yet he or she tends to take the place of that immediacy by his very function as leader. What is more, the followers often foist upon the leader the task of vicariously repre- senting them before God with or without his consent and even to the point of idolatry. Again and again in the history of the world's religions someone who has come to show others an image of the human-a meaningful way of personal and social existence in dialogue with the divine-has been trans- formed by those who come after into an image of the divine-a human image to be worshiped in place of the imageless God, someone to relieve one of the task of being a lamp unto oneself, as the Buddha put it. For me, the ultimate test of religious leadership is twofold: first, does it help those who are led to find their own ground instead of coasting along forever in dependence upon guru, zaddik, minister, or priest? Second, does it lead to greater openness to dialogue with the world, toward building a "community of otherness," or does it lead to ever greater closedness in which one takes refuge in the cult or church of the like-minded, the "community of affinity"? These two questions necessarily belong together; for the heart of the "community of otherness" lies in the "dialogue of touchstones" among the members of the community. In this dialogue the religious leader needs his or her followers as much as the followers need the leader if religious reality is to arise between them.</page><page sequence="10">76 Journal of the American Academy of Religion The via humana-the dialogical approach to religion and human experience-also raises the question of whether the essence of the human, the true human being, is to be found in consciousness or in the whole per- son. Is it found by leaving the world that is given to us-the social world, the world of nature, the world of the senses? Or is it found by remaining in relation to the life of the senses and to other people? Is the goal of human existence enlightenment and individual spiritual salvation, or is it a way of life which does not attain individual perfection yet affirms and redeems the human world? When inwardness and inner spiritual development are seen as the goal of life, external actions tend to become relativized. As a result, the problem of ethics is never a problem of "What ought I do in this situa- tion?" but of "What is the spiritual stage I have reached and what is the right way for me to act in terms of this spiritual stage?" Many religions confront us with the question as to whether the highest and most authentic existence is not that in which not only lust but the total post-Freudian attitude toward sex as a wholesome and natural thing must be overcome in favor of the use of this energy for spiritual enlightenment. They believe that the goal is spiritual perfection which demands all of your energies-not just on the level they now are, but transformed and elevated through concentration and devotion-to become the basis of a whole new state of spiritual being. There is here an implied dualism not only between spirit and flesh, but also between individual consciousness and the social world, which is considered, if not an evil world, at least a lesser world. The two of these factors work together to induce seekers to concentrate attention on the inner, on inward spiritual perfection, the realization of our spiritual essence. This constitutes a great issue in the history of religions, one of those which exclude the possibility of any common "essence" that could be extracted from all religions. Does one hold that the true goal of spiritual existence is this sort of inner perfection in which one relates to the world either as a hindrance or as a stepping-stone to this perfection? Or does one believe that what is asked of one is a completion of the world which will forever leave oneself imperfect? This issue must be grasped in terms of ultimate touchstones of reality. There is nothing about turning inward that altogether or always excludes community, and there is nothing about community that excludes turning inward. Yet there is the question of whether our inwardness means, at some level, a turning away from the life of the senses and from contact with our fellow human beings and whether community means the sacrifice of pre- cisely that detachment that would enable us to turn inward and grow in spiritual enlightenment. The issue is not whether inwardness may be dis- pensed with-I do not think that it can-but whether one aims at it as one's ultimate goal. Is our life in the world the stepping-stone to mystical contem- plation, or do we grow in inwardness precisely in order to go out again and again to the meeting with what comes to meet us?</page><page sequence="11">Friedman: The Human Way 77 The significance of this contrast between touchstones of reality will elude us if we think in terms of the contrast "inner" and "outer." Inner ver- sus outer splits reality into two opposing parts and practically forces us to lay emphasis upon one as opposed to the other as the more basic reality. Inner and outer are not primordial human reality but secondary elaborations and constructions arising from a human wholeness which is prior to them both. Unless we understand this and understand the possibility of direct contact between human wholeness and human wholeness, we cannot understand the sphere of the "between" and its claim to be a touchstone of reality. The "inner" is psychic in the sense that we do not perceive anything with our senses, the outer "physical" in the sense that we do. These divisions are use- ful for a certain ordering of our lives, such as the distinction between what we see, what we dream, what we envision, and what we hallucinate. Yet if we think about human existence in its wholeness, we realize that a true event in our lives is neither inner nor outer but takes up and claims the whole of us. The meeting between persons, what is more, is hardly a mere going outward; for in its depth such meeting includes our penetrating to the very heart of the other by "imagining the real." Only from such a meeting, in fact, can we know that there is not just one inner-myself-and one outer-others. The other's inwardness does not mean I must be merely outer for him-a part of the environment to be ingested and used-any more than he need be merely outer for me. Only if we can get beyond this deep- seated prejudice of inner and outer can we understand the sense in which our existential meetings are, just in their betweenness, meetings with the Ultimate. We each have our own ground yet meet each other from that ground. Our existences interpenetrate. We have claimed that in our meeting with the everyday, we can, and sometimes do, meet the "Ultimate," that the events of our lives are not only contacts with "otherness" but encounters that leave us with "touchstones of reality." This claim is only comprehensible in terms of the sphere of the "between"; for it is not a claim that any particular person or thing we meet is itself the ultimate. This would, indeed, be idolatry, and it is to rescue us from such vulgar anthropomorphism that many philosophies and religions have identified the "really real" with what is met outside of time and space and the world of the senses. Others point to an imageless God, the Creator of time and space who transcends the world that he creates yet whom we can meet in the world. For these latter God is "immanent" as well as transcendent-not in the sense of being some universal essence inside of particulars but that each thing that we meet can be a messenger that speaks to us of the holy, a burning bush that tells us that the ground on which we stand-the everyday-is the ground of hallowing. If we put off the habitual that hides from us the enormous lights and mysteries of which the world is full, we shall know touchstones of reality not as the miracles of the past but as the revelation of the present.</page></plain_text>
