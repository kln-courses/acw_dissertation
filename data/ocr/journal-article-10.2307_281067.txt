<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANTIQUITY, INTERPRETATION, AND STYLISTIC EVOLUTION OF PETROGLYPHS IN WEST MEXICO Joseph B. Mountjoy New data from two sites in the municipality of San Bias, Nayarit, indicate that the practice of pecking petro- glyphs in West Mexico is older than it has been possible to establish in previous studies. Petroglyphs at the La Coba site appear firmly dated to the Los Cocos phase (A.D. 200-600), and petroglyphs at the El Conchal site seem attributable to the Early Ixtldn phase (300 B.C.-A.D. 200) occupation. Hypotheses are offered regarding stylistic evolution of the pecked designs and their interpretation. Native American rock art is an abundant, occasionally highly conspicuous, kind of archaeological remain. It is widely distributed over the North American continent (Grant 1967:16-17; Wellmann 1979), and the study of rock art designs is potentially of great importance for the information they may contain relating to the cosmology or religion of prehistoric Native American peoples (Aveni et al. 1978; Mountjoy 1982a). But despite the abundance of Native American rock art and its research potential, its study has often been slighted by professional archaeologists. This is due in part to the difficulty of dating the rock art, correlating it with a specific culture, and interpreting it in a scientifically acceptable way (Mountjoy 1974b; Whitley 1982). In recent years, however, there have been several successful attempts to date rock art: through stratigraphic association in California and Arizona (Deetz 1964; DiPeso 1950); by radiocarbon analysis of layered calcium carbonate deposits in southern California (Smith and Turner 1975); and by using cation-ratio analysis of rock varnish in eastern California (Dorn and Whitley 1984). It has also proved possible to link some North American rock art with specific cultures, such as the Chumash in California (Grant 1965) and certain Northwest Coast cultures (Hill and Hill 1974). Progress has also been made in deriving interpretations of rock art from ethnographic analogies utilizing such groups as the Hopi/Zuni (DiPeso 1950; Schaafsma 1980; Williamson and Young 1979), the Navajo (Schaafsma 1980; Williamson 1983) and the Huichol/Cora (Furst and Scott 1975; Mountjoy 1982a). For many years I have been working on the problem of dating and interpreting rock art found in West Mexico, especially in the States of Nayarit and Jalisco. In 1967-1968 I recorded 52 petroglyph rocks during fieldwork in the San Blas, Nayarit area, and attempted to date them through association with datable artifacts, especially decorated potsherds, found at the nearest habitation site. Later, the designs were analyzed and compared to petroglyphs from sites in the States of Sinaloa, Nayarit, Jalisco, Michoacan, Hidalgo, San Luis Potosi, and Mexico (Mountjoy 1974b), and interpretations of the petroglyph designs were offered based on analogies derived from ethnohistoric Huichol and Tarascan cultures. It was hypothesized that most if not all of the San Blas area petroglyphs could be attributed to the locally defined Santa Cruz complex occupation, which was the latest prehispanic archaeological phase of the area, probably beginning no earlier than about A.D. 900-1100 (Mountjoy 1974b). Only one West Mexican petroglyph, a ballcourt design possibly dated in the range of A.D. 500-900, found near Teuchitlan, Jalisco (Mountjoy 1974b) did not seem to fit the hypothesized date of other West Mexican petroglyphs. The San Blas area petroglyphs, as well as many others in West Mexico, were noted to be frequently associated with water or with ceremonial centers. Spiral designs in particular were suggested to have symbolized a sort of diffuse Quetzalcoatl concept related to crops and water, whereas the naturalistic Joseph B.

Copyright ( 1987 by the Society for American Archaeology 161</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY designs were believed to represent gods that could undergo transformations in order to assume different naturalistic "aspects." Petroglyphs found at ceremonial centers were proposed to be a physical representation of the supernatural power believed to reside there. Then, salvage archaeology fieldwork in the Tomatlan river basin of Jalisco (1975-1977) provided an opportunity to further explore the problems of dating and interpreting the rock art of West Mexico (Mountjoy 1982b, 1983). In the course of the three field seasons of salvage work, 747 boulders with rock art (all having petroglyphs and one also having pictographs) were located in the Tomatlan valley. Of these boulders, 339 were registered fully and subsequently analyzed in terms of: probable date based primarily on associated pottery sherds; design element symbolism based mainly on Huichol ethnographic analogy; and spatial-directional orientation of the designs (Mountjoy 1982a, 1984a, 1984c). As for temporal placement, available data from Tomatlan best support the hypothesis that the large pictographic panel and most of the petroglyph rocks date from the latest prehispanic phase of the valley, the Nahuapa phase (A.D. 1000-1525), although some petroglyphs may have been pecked on into early Spanish Colonial times. It also seems likely that some Tomatlan petroglyphs were produced during the local manifestation of the Aztatlan phase (A.D. 600-1000), based on the fact that Aztatlan pottery predominates at four of the sites with petroglyphs, and is present at seven more sites with petroglyphs. However, the association of petroglyphs with earlier archaeological phases in the Tomatlan valley is more problematical. Only one site provided data suggesting that petroglyphs might have been pecked during the local Guayacan phase (A.D. 300-600). But the Guayacan sherds at that site were not found in close association with the petroglyph rocks. The best case for an association of petroglyphs with the earlier La Pintada archaeological phase (400 B.C.-A.D. 300) was found at the 21-hectare Tom-4 site where 97 petroglyph rocks were discovered. Sherds of the La Pintada phase were extremely abundant there; however, a portion of the Tom-4 site was also inhabited during the later Aztatlan phase, leaving some doubt as to which occupation was responsible for pecking the petroglyphs. Earlier, Capacha-Openo phase (1390-1080 B.C.) pottery sherds were found at only four sites in the Tomatlan valley, and always in sparse quantities. Although there were petroglyphs found at three of these four sites, it seems improbable that they were produced by Capacha-Openio phase inhabitants, because sherds of later phases were found in abundance at these sites. Based on the orientation of the designs, their context on the rocks, and ethnohistoric information, it has been proposed (Mountjoy 1982a, 1984a, 1984c; Mountjoy and Smith, 1985) that the Tomatlan rock art records a considerable portion of indigenous cosmology. It is believed that the designs were painted or pecked in a spatially organized form-on areas of the rock that represent the upper sky, the horizon, and, in at least one case, the earth. The great majority of the petroglyphic designs and some of the pictographic ones appear to symbolize the eye or face of the sun god-the god responsible for providing life-giving rain. Analysis of pecked and painted designs also suggests the use of the movements of the sun along the eastern horizon as a rustic calendar for predicting the onset and perhaps also the end of the rainy season. And the individual designs are believed to be the physical manifestation of votive prayers that may have been offered in the context of shamanistic rites intended to communicate to the sun god the need for rainfall that would cause the plants and animals that sustained the people to flourish. This interpretation, however, might not be wholly applicable to rock art in other areas of West Mexico. For instance, although the San Blas area is only 180 km due north of Tomatlan, some differences have been noted between the two areas in designs and design frequencies: pits, circles, bullseyes, and anthropomorphic stick-figures are much more common in the Tomatlan area; spirals and naturalistic non-human animal representations are more common in the San Blas area. This seemed to be so, even though the date of rock art production was believed to be approximately the same in both areas. Now some of the hypotheses previously offered regarding rock art date, interpretation, and stylistic comparisons will have to be altered due to information from recent (1983) fieldwork in the San Blas, Nayarit area. The main purpose of this report is to present the new information from the San Blas area that bears on the antiquity, interpretation, and stylistic evolution of petroglyph designs 162 [Vol. 52, No. 1, 1987]</page><page sequence="3">REPORTS Figure 1. Map of archaeological sites in the municipality of San Bias, Nayarit. there. The new data come from studies at two San Bias sites: 47 and 17 (Figure 1). Information relevant to the dating and interpretation of the petroglyphs recently discovered at each site is discussed below. THE LA COBA (SAN BLAS-47) SITE Site Description The La Coba site is situated about 13 km straight northeast of San Bias (Figure 1) at an elevation of about 160 m above sea level in the foothills overlooking the broad flat coastal plain that stretches 163</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Figure 2. Map of the La Coba (San Blas-47) site. out to the northwest. The site area covers the top and extends down the northeastern slope of a hill that rises 18 m above the level of an arroyo situated about 100 m northeast of the hilltop (Figure 2). Local people reported that the arroyo always contains water, even in the dry season, and they related that several springs feed the arroyo from an area upstream, to the southeast of the archae- ological site. When the La Coba site was first visited in June, 1983, it had been recently cleared by cutting and burning the vegetation. This exposed many lines of prehispanic construction enough to allow for fairly accurate mapping. The size of the rocks in the site map (Figure 2) is not to scale, and contrary to their single-line depiction on the map, in places (for example, the extreme western and eastern lines) they were constituted of up to three parallel lines of rocks. Pottery sherds were found in abundance all over the top of the hill and down the northeastern slope, all the way to the arroyo. Obsidian artifacts were not abundant, but they were widely distributed and generally associated 164 [Vol. 52, No. 1, 1987]</page><page sequence="5">REPORTS a 4 5I .5 6 7 8 9 Figure 3. Petroglyphs found at the La Coba (San Bias-47) site. with the sherd scatter. Most grinding stones were found strewn over the top of the hill, outside of the plaza area and often near rock construction lines, but one was found close to the arroyo. Ten boulders with petroglyphs were discovered in three different areas of the La Coba site; most (seven) located among a natural outcrop at the highest point on the hill (Figure 2; Figure 3: 1-7). Although petroglyphs were found on only seven of the many boulders in this area of the hill, there 165 I</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY has been severe spalling of the surface of many boulders, probably due to modem slash-and-bum agricultural practices, and perhaps this has caused the loss of some petroglyphs. Two more petroglyph boulders (Figure 3: 8 and 9) were located in the fairly level terrain between the base of the hill and the arroyo (Figure 2), and a tenth boulder with petroglyphs (Figure 3: 10) was found at the base of the hill (Figure 2). It appears most probable that the petroglyphs at this site were pecked by the same prehispanic inhabitants who altered the topography of the hill, laid out the lines of rock constructions and left their domestic refuse scattered all over the hilltop and down to the arroyo. Based on the pottery and stone artifacts collected from the surface of the site, these people inhabited the site during the local Los Cocos archaeological phase. There is no evidence from the extensive surface collections of a prehispanic habitation of the site post-dating the Los Cocos phase, and only one pottery vessel sherd out of 550 is known to pre-date the Los Cocos phase. The types of stone artifacts encountered are also consistent with a Los Cocos phase assignment for the occupation. The Los Cocos phase is believed to date within the range of A.D. 200-600, contemporary with the Amapa phase at the Amapa site some 20 km northwest of the La Coba site, on the north side of the Santiago river (Figure 1) (Meighan 1976). A detailed substantiation for the Los Cocos phase assignment follows below. Surface Collections Of the 550 pottery sherds collected from the surface of the La Coba site, 60 were so badly deteriorated that they were not classifiable as to decorative type, although their paste is commonly like that of Los Cocos Red-on-Buff/Orange pottery (type B; Mountjoy 1970:220, 271). Fifty-eight of the sherds from the La Coba site are undecorated. Thirty-six of these are not diagnostic as to phase, but 22 have an unusual rim profile with a roughened interior (Figure 4: 17 and 18) that is a diagnostic Los Cocos phase plainware called Los Cocos Rough (Mountjoy 1970:93). Sixty other sherds have a red-slipped surface. The phasing of redware has not been fully worked out for the San Blas area; it is possible that some of these sherds might pertain to the Early Ixtlan phase that precedes the Los Cocos. Most of the redware rim sherds have a rather undiagnostic profile (Figure 4: 14 and 15), however, three have a highly distinctive profile (type S; Mountjoy 1970:193) that was recorded at the almost purely Los Cocos phase San Blas-5 (Los Cocos) site (Mountjoy 1970). There are also 91 sherds with remnants of a typical Los Cocos phase pasty buff to orange slip upon which designs of red, black, brown, or white may have originally been painted (Mountjoy 1970: 270-273). Another 185 sherds are of the Los Cocos Red-on-Buff/Orange type (Figure 4: 1-6), which is comparable to the Amapa phase Red-on-Buff, Red-on-Orange, and Red-on-Cream types from the Amapa site (Meighan 1976). Eighteen sherds from La Coba are of the Los Cocos White type (Figure 4: 10), similar to Amapa White, and an additional Los Cocos White sherd is incised (Figure 4: 11) as are some of the sherds of the Amapa White type (Meighan 1976:488, p-v). Seventy-five sherds from the La Coba site are of the Los Cocos Incised type (Figure 4: 12 and 13), which although lacking a red or brown slip in the San Blas area (Mountjoy 1970:268-270) is similar in vessel shape and incised design to two of the three sherds upon which the Amapa Red Incised type definition was based at Amapa (Meighan 1976:220). One of the two remaining pottery sherds from the La Coba site is a fragment of an Early Ixtlan phase polychrome bowl that pre-dates the Los Cocos phase, and the second is a fragment of an orange-slipped incised bowl of unknown type and date. Sixteen other items of pottery were recovered from the surface of the La Coba site. Fourteen of these may be fragments of figurines. Of the possible figurine fragments, most are quite small and could be parts of legs or arms, although some might even be pieces of solid conical vessel supports. Most have a paste like that common to the Los Cocos phase pottery vessels, although their surface is deteriorated and lacks paint. Five figurine fragments were large enough and distinctive enough to be classified as to phase. One appears to be part of a hollow figurine with modeled features and dark red paint on both the exterior and interior. It is probably attributable to the Early Ixtlan phase. Three other figurine fragments are portions of solid heads, with coffee-bean shaped eyes (Figure 4: 19-21). The two largest are quite similar to a figurine head found in good Los Cocos phase context 166 [Vol. 52, No. 1, 1987]</page><page sequence="7">REPORTS in an excavation at the Aticama (San Blas-1) site (Mountjoy 1970:188a). Another fragment (Figure 4: 22) is apparently the leg and foot of a solid figurine. It has paste resembling that of Los Cocos Rough type sherds, and traces of an orange slip. Similar figurine fragments have been recorded previously in a Los Cocos phase excavated context (Mountjoy 1970:220j). The figurine heads from La Coba are not exactly like any of the ones illustrated from the Amapa site excavations, but they appear closest to type R, which Meighan attributes to the Amapa phase (1976:70). One spindle whorl was found at La Coba (Figure 4: 23). It is similar to one from excavated Los Cocos phase context in the Aticama (San Bias-1) site (Mountjoy 1970:189j) and to type 2A spindle whorls from the Amapa site, which are assigned to the Amapa phase there (Meighan 1976:82, 365). A fragment of a whistle was also recovered from La Coba (Figure 4: 24). No whistles were found in a context as early as the Amapa phase at the Amapa site (Meighan 1976:77), but earlier, Formative period, whistles are rather common in Colima (Kelly 1980; Meighan 1972) and Jalisco (Mountjoy 1982b), so the presence of this kind of artifact does not appear to be very diagnostic temporally. Grinding stones recovered from the surface of the La Coba site include portions of six metates and seven manos. One of these, a small sharp-pointed conical metate support is not typical of the Los Cocos phase, and two other metate supports were rather more pronounced than is typical for those of the Los Cocos phase. However, later Santa Cruz phase metates usually lack supports. The manos are a little squarish compared to those known for the Los Cocos phase and only one has grinding facets on both faces. Later, Santa Cruz phase manos are commonly well-shaped and rectangular with a grinding facet on only one face. Chipped stone artifacts include three of chert and 121 of obsidian. Ninety-seven of the obsidian artifacts are flakes of clear green color, 34 of which have macroscopic edge damage presumably from utilization; another 17 are of clear gray obsidian, 4 of which have macroscopic edge utilization damage. Seven fragments of bifacially-chipped obsidian blades were found: 6 of clear green obsidian; and one of red obsidian with dark splotches. Thickness of the blades ranges from .3 to 1.2 cm. The blade of red obsidian is heavily damaged along one edge. Bifacially chipped blades or projectile point fragments have been found in excavated Los Cocos phase context (Mountjoy 1970:96, 165), and the kind of flaking (neatly aligned and parallel at a right angle to the blade edge) is the same kind as found on the Type 2 projectile points at the Amapa site, which are dated primarily to the Amapa phase and the earlier Gavilan phase there (Meighan 1976:108). It is also important that not a single prismatic blade of obsidian was found on the surface of the La Coba site, for such blades seem to post-date the Los Cocos phase in the San Bias area (Mountjoy 1970:112). Petroglyph Rocks The petroglyph boulders themselves are composed of a hard porphyritic rhyolite with phenocrysts that include quartz, feldspar and hornblende (personal communication, Mike Mayfield, geologist, UNC-G Department of Geography). The weathered exterior of the boulders is naturally pitted and rough, varying in color from light tan or cream to a darker gray. The color of the rock underneath the weathered exterior is darker (gray) than the surface, which would have originally made the petroglyph designs, if pecked deep enough, stand out as darker in color. It is presumed that the designs were pecked into the rock by using a pointed cobble of harder stone, as appears to have been the case in the Tomatlan, Jalisco area (Mountjoy 1984a), although no such pecking implements were found on the surface of the La Coba site, and the surface of the designs is generally too weathered to reveal macroscopic damage marks. This is true except for one instance. The ladder type design of 13 rungs in the middle of the southwestern side of petroglyph rock no. 10 (Figure 3) is different from the rest of the similar designs on the same rock. First, the whole area of the ladder design was pecked down into the surface before making the rung lines, and the rung lines themselves are much thinner in this instance than those of the other similar designs on the rock. These rungs are also unusually light in color. The thinness of the lines could have been produced with the edge of a sharp stone blade or perhaps the edge of a modern steel machete. These 13 lines may not be of prehispanic origin, although there is also the possibility that in recent times a farmer used the blade of his machete to "improve" a prehispanic design. 167</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY 1 4 7 ''' :. :::::..?::.: 1 ::;?;:-:.:,I:.??::::::::?:.\\I r :::::?:.?? \ ::: :??.

Also, a precise measurement of slope is lacking for face A of rock no. 2, but the field photograph indicates that it approaches 60 degrees. A chi-square analysis of the design orientations by directional quadrant, or by east opposed to west, fails to support the notion that there is a statistically significant orientation of the pecked designs to any cardinal direction. This situation contrasts to the analysis of petroglyphs in the Tomatlan, Jalisco area where there is a statistically significant tendency to peck some large designs (circles, bullseyes, spirals, and anthropomorphic stick-figures) in the northern and eastern areas of the boulders (Mountjoy 1984a). On the other hand, there is apparently a tendency at the La Coba site to peck the solitary pits and the pits of pit-and-line combinations up near to or on the apex of the boulders, and the spiral designs down the side of the rock, closer to the base. In the Tomatlan, Jalisco area, the tendency for some large complex petroglyph designs, especially circles, bullseyes, spirals, and anthropomorphic stick-figures to be found on the sides of boulders and the solitary pits near or on the apex has been found to be statistically significant (Mountjoy 1984a). It is believed to relate to the fact that the sun appears much larger on or near the horizon than when it nears zenith, so the designs that symbolize the eye, face, or whole body of the sun god are generally large on the sides of the boulders and small at the top. The surface of each boulder represents a sort of positive image of the chamber formed by the sky extending to the horizons. Petroglyph rock no. 10 at La Coba deserves some special consideration, for the petroglyph designs it bears support the interpretation just outlined above. This rock has four or five (if the fifth is prehispanic) ladder-like petroglyphs, three extending up the southwestern side and two up the northeastern side. In two cases these ladders terminate at a solitary pit near or on the apex of the boulder. In a third case a solitary pit is just off to the right of the top of the series of ladder rungs. This ladder motif may relate to the rather common and widespread prehispanic Mesoamerican belief that the sun god rises from the underworld in the east by ascending a stairway or ladder that he then descends to the west in the evening. Such a concept is amply recorded ethnographically among the Huichol of Jalisco and Nayarit, and has been used to interpret a ladder-like petroglyph design at the site of Los Monos in the mountains of northern Nayarit, which terminates in an elaborate sun symbol (Furst and Scott 1975). As for the spiral designs at La Coba, it has been argued that in the San Blas, Nayarit area such designs signify a coiled serpent that relates to water and crop fertility (Mountjoy 1974b). However, more recent research in the Tomatlan, Jalisco area indicates that the spiral motif there is inter- changeable with the bullseye, which is apparently a symbol for the sun (Mountjoy 1984a). 169</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Figure 5. Map of the El Conchal (San Blas-17) site. Why were the various designs pecked on boulders at the La Coba site? It is conceivable, although not provable, that these petroglyphs functioned in a similar way to the ones pecked in the Tomatlan area, where they were apparently pecked as part of dry season ceremonies intended to procure rainfall, which was controlled by the sun god, and each such pecked design seems to have been the physical manifestation of a prayer for rain (Mountjoy 1983, 1984a). At the La Coba site, the boulders would have been first exposed to the full rays of the sun when the Los Cocos phase people cleared and burned the brush in preparation for building their settlement and laying out agricultural plots. Such rain-fertility petroglyph pecking rituals might have been part of settlement founding activities, intended to help assure seasons of abundant rainfall for the benefit of the inhabitants. THE EL CONCHAL (SAN BLAS-17) SITE Another discovery in the San Blas, Nayarit area during 1983 fieldwork, at the El Conchal (San Blas- 17) site (Figure 5), suggests the possibility that petroglyphs at El Conchal (Figure 6) are of even greater antiquity than those found at the La Coba site. At the El Conchal site, however, the precise antiquity of the petroglyphs is harder to establish than at the La Coba site because it is more difficult to prove that they were produced during one particular archaeological phase. 170 [Vol. 52, No. 1, 1987]</page><page sequence="11">REPORTS 0 20 40 60 80 100 7 . 7 6 Figure 6. Petroglyphs found at the El Conchal (San Blas-17) site. Site Description and Date The El Conchal site is an area of prehispanic habitation on the lower slopes and at the base of the northeastern side of La Contadoria hill. Dating the petroglyphs at this location by associated prehispanic cultural remains is difficult because there are extensive Colonial period ruins over much of the top of the hill, under which are remains of a prehispanic, Santa Cruz phase (A.D. 1000-1530) occupation (Figure 1, site 25). Some petroglyphs, including naturalistic ones of two birds and a sea turtle (Mountjoy 1970:219, Figure 82, 1974b: 13, Figure 51), as well as a sunburst motif, are believed to pertain to the Santa Cruz phase habitation of site no. 25. However, in the area along the northern and eastern lower slope and base of La Contaduria hill, there is extensive sherd debris pertaining to the Early Ixtlan phase (300 B.C.-A.D. 200), and such remains stratigraphically overlie a less ex- tensive area of San Blas phase (Middle Formative, 800-400 B.C.) occupation found there (Mount- joy 1970, 1974a, 1984b). It is possible that the El Conchal petroglyphs could have been produced by any one of the prehispanic groups that inhabited La Contadoria hill, but the most logical argument that can be made would attribute the petroglyphs to the Early Ixtlan phase inhabitants. This is because five of the petroglyph boulders are found outside the limits of the San Blas phase habitation debris but well within the area of distribution of Early Ixtlan phase sherds that extend to the south, east, and west well beyond the San Blas phase remains. Also, in the area around the petroglyph boulders Early Ixtlan Polychrome pottery (Meighan 1976:499, a-g; Mountjoy 1970:181, f-h; 182, a-b) is abundant, whereas post-Early Ixtlan phase sherds are rare. 171</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Table 2.

Data are presented in Table 2 on the petroglyph designs according to the directional orientation and slope of the pecked rock face. Such data are not recorded in Table 2 for petroglyph rock no. 7 because it was discovered in the foundation of a modern house. Also, it is important to note that in the cases of petroglyph rocks no. 1 and no. 2, the rocks are probably not now in the position they were in at the time the petroglyphs were pecked. In both cases, the rocks appear to be tilting down the hillside. It therefore seems likely that the original position of these petroglyphs was on the uppermost part of both rocks, and that they were oriented straight up, skyward. Such is the basic orientation of most glyphs on the rocks at the El Conchal site that do seem to be in their original position. With the exception of one line, all the rest (109) of the El Conchal petroglyphs are pits of various sizes. As noted previously, in the Tomatlan, Jalisco area it is common for pits to be located on or near the apex of boulders and oriented straight up, skyward. This appears to relate to the fact that the pits represent the eye or the face of the sun god, which is smallest when it is near zenith in the sky, the zenith being represented by the apex area of the boulder (Mountjoy 1984a). Petroglyph pits in the Tomatlan area appear to be the physical manifestations of prayers and perhaps other cere- monial activities designed to attract the onset of the erainy season. CONCLUSIONS AND DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH Previous studies have indicated that most West Mexican rock art could be attributed only to the latest phase of prehispanic habitation, and it has been impossible to firmly link any West Mexican rock art with prehispanic habitation earlier than about A.D. 600. Now, in the San Blas, Nayarit area, there is solid evidence from the La Coba site that the petroglyphs there were pecked as early as the Los Cocos phase (A.D. 200-600), and other evidence from the El Conchal site that indicates that the petroglyphs there may have been pecked as early as the Early Ixtlan phase (300 B.C.-A.D. 200). Furthermore, these new data suggest the possibility that some stylistic variation in petroglyph design occurred through time. The tentative sequence would begin with an early emphasis on pits, after which a shift in emphasis to spiral designs occurred. Finally, near the end of the prehispanic sequence designs begin to include a variety of naturalistic representations. This is offered as a hypothesis for future investigation. But if such a sequence of stylistic evolution proves to be true, it would make less likely the validity of any simple uniform theory of petroglyph interpretation, since these stylistic changes could be the manifestation of some important changes in native religion or cosmology.

Four or five episodes of Indian occupations are iden- tified, ranging from about 1641-50 or 1651 to as late as approximately 1760-70. Of particular importance to the study is the convergence of independent types of information bearing on the identifica- ;i,.;:;,. ttion of the site's inhabitants and visitors: '-?^L&gt;. ? early explorers' and missionaries' ac- .-*&gt; counts, concordance of geographical land- w30os3 marks, site features and chronology, comparative artifact technologies and styles. 264 pages, 32 figures, 121 plates (including 4 color), 136 tables, appendix, bibliography, 1986 $19.95 paper W15S35 ,!ll-'=: -'l- C.An - I- 1I -- ' 174 [Vol. 52, No. 1, 1987] .. ?: ?? ?-??;i' - '?'
