<plain_text><page sequence="1">EVIDENCE FOR A SOCIAL CUSTOM IN WILD CHIMPANZEES? W. C. MCGREW University of Stirling C. E. G. TUTIN University of Edinburgh Can the concept of culture be applied validly to any of the natural behaviours exhibited by non-human primates? We compare aspects of social grooming shown by two separate populations of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in western Tanzania. We present as an example a behaviour pattern, the grooming-hand-clasp, which occurs commonly in the chimpanzees of Kasoge but is absent in the chimpanzees of Gombe. After discussing the problems of operationally defining culture, we present eight necessary criteria of culture which are capable of empirical verification: innovation, dissemination, standardisation, durability, diffusion, tradition, non-subsistence, and natural adaptiveness. These are applied to the behaviour of wild chimpanzees andJapanese monkeys (Macacafuscata). We conclude that no single behaviour pattern yet reported satisfies all eight criteria but that the grooming-hand- clasp should qualify as a social custom. Field primatology has advanced rapidly in the last two decades; as knowledge has accumulated, speculative interpretation of it has permeated through related disciplines. One such area of debate in anthropology is whether or not the concept of culture can be applied validly in any way to non- human primates. The aims of this article are two-fold: (i) To describe a hitherto unrecorded pattern of grooming behaviour shown by wild chimpanzees which we believe to represent a truly social custom, and (2) To discuss the practical pitfalls and potentials of seeking to apply a higher-order concept originally defined for Homo sapiens to other species. We believe that recent findings, particularly from studies of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and Japanese monkeys (Macaca fuscata) force us beyond the usual problems presented by anthropomorphism in its various forms. At the same time, we believe that these findings show that if anything is to be gained from using such concepts as culture, we must avoid simplistic and subjective extrapolation. Gombe and Kasoge chimpanzees Two long-term field studies of wild chimpanzees have proceeded in parallel in western Tanzania, and most of the published knowledge of the natural behaviours of individual chimpanzees comes from these.

TUTIN 235 better-known study, at least in the Western world, is that of Goodall (I968, 1973) and her colleagues at the Gombe National Park (until I968 the Gombe Stream Reserve). This research has been under way since I960, although it has been severely curtailed since I975 by political disturbances in the region. It focuses on the Kasakela community of chimpanzees, whose membership averages 35-40 individuals, with irregular observations being made on the neighbouring Kahama community. Newer is the project begun by the African Primate Expedition (originally of Kyoto University) at Kasoge in the Mahali Mountains, under the direction of Itani, and latterly, Nishida (I968; I970; 1974). This project began in I965, having grown out of several exploratory projects conducted since I96I by Japanese primatologists in nearby areas (e.g. Izawa 1970) under the direction of Imanishi. For a variety of reasons, these two longitudinal studies are ideal candidates for comparative (or cross-cultural?) studies. First, both are of Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, the eastern geographical race (subspecies) of chimpanzee. This should reduce the chances that any differences found between them might be due to genetic differences, as might be the case when attempting to make comparisons between subspecies. Second, both represent relic populations which were probably once part of a continuous cline since disrupted by deforestation (Kano I972). In straight line distance the two study sites are only about I70 km apart, and only 50 km separates the southern limits of the population containing the Gombe chimpanzees from the northern limits of the population containing the Kasoge chimpanzees (Kano 1972: 47). While the potential for interbreeding and interaction no longer exists because of human incursions, it is unlikely that the two populations have had time to differentiate markedly through genetic drift. Third, they occupy similar types of habitat: mixed forest and woodland on the rugged terrain of the Great Rift escarpment forming the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika. Although detailed ecological studies of the two sites remain to be done, published reports show that considerable overlap exists in the vegetation types, and the diets of the chimpanzees reflect this commonality (Nishida 1974; Wrangham I975). Fourth, both studies focus on, but are not limited to, a single well-known group (or community) in which all members are individually recognisable. Fifth, and perhaps most important, both have been studied using similar methods, i.e., by artificially providing prized food items in proximity to human beings, to facilitate the gradual growth of chimpanzee tolerance of man. This provisioning enables near-continuous human monitoring of all known chimpanzee activities at distances of 5-10 m. Differences do exist between Gombe and Kasoge, e.g. the faunal range at Kasoge is richer, including more large ungulates and carnivores than at Gombe. The differences between Gombe and Kasoge are far fewer than those between either of them and any other study site, e.g. Budongo Forest in Uganda (Reynolds &amp; Reynolds I965; Sugiyama 1973). Grooming Grooming behaviour is the co-ordinated fine manipulation (sometimes in conjunction with the lips or tongue) and close inspection of the body surface</page><page sequence="3">236 W. C.

Gombe chimpanzees show typical social grooming behaviour. of the self or another individual (see fig. i). This rather unwieldy definition is presented in order to distinguish it from other chimpanzee behaviours which involve touching. In non-human primates grooming has at least two distinct but complementary functions: on one level, it is hygienic, serving to remove ectoparasites, extraneous matter (mud, sap, debris) and bodily products (blood, semen, scab, sloughed skin). On another level, social grooming constitutes an affiliative interaction of intimacy between two or more individuals. It may be unilateral (A grooms B but not the reverse), mutual (A and B groom one another simultaneously), or reciprocal (A grooms B, then B grooms A). The social function of non-human primate grooming has long been recognised (Yerkes I933) and will not be elaborated upon here, but two additional points regarding chimpanzees deserve comment: Falk (I958) demonstrated in a simple but elegant experiment that chimpanzee motivation to groom is high. With opportunity-to-groom as a reward, a chimpanzee infant quickly learned a visual discrimination task. Simpson (I973) showed that wild chimpanzees do not randomly distribute their social grooming amongst community members. Instead, adult males (at least) show pre- ferences for grooming partners from whichever individuals are present. Finally, typical chimpanzee grooming shows a species-specific form which is the same for all known wild populations (Goodall I968: 264). Variants on the typical form have been seen in captive groups (e.g. tool use in dental grooming, McGrew &amp; Tutin I972), but these are apparently uncommon in the wild (e.g. Goodall I973: 173). Observations Between i-i I January 1975 the authors visited the Kasoge field station, as guests of J. Itani. With the assistance of two Watongwe field assistants, M.</page><page sequence="4">W. C. McGREW &amp; C. E. G. TUTIN 237 Seifu and R. Nyundo, we observed chimpanzees of the Kajabala (K) unit- group for a total of 33-5 hours. These comprised ten observational sessions ranging from I 5 to 4 5 hours in length, on six different days. All observations were made at close range (5-25 m) using descriptive, scan-sampling techniques (Altmann 1974: 259), and some provisioning with sugar cane or bananas occurred during all but one of the sessions. In most cases, we simultaneously observed the chimpanzees' behaviour; one of us dictated a running commentary onto cassette tape while the other photographed or timed the events. The observations occurred at a variety of ridge-top locations near the Miyako Camp (see map in Kawanaka &amp; Nishida 1975: 174). They took place between o6oo and 1920 hours but were not distributed evenly over the daylight hours; instead they were concentrated at mid-day. The Kajabala group is the best-habituated and longest-studied group of chimpanzees in the Mahali Mountains population (Nishida i968; 1970; Kawanaka &amp; Nishida 1975). At the time of our visit it numbered twenty-eight individuals (see table i) of which we saw twenty-six. At other times the group isjoined by other females and their offspring who move seasonally between K and M (Mimikile) groups (Kawanaka &amp; Nishida 1975: i8o). Only those TABLE I.

C. McGREW &amp; C. E. G. TUTIN individuals who are normally present in K group at this time of year are listed in the table. As is the case with all known wild chimpanzee populations, the number of individuals present together at any one time varies according to unknown factors. During our observations, the mean group size per quarter- hour sample period was 9 (N =128, range= i-i8, mode =9). Any inter- individual comparisons of frequencies of behaviour should take account of this differential attendance, and the last two columns in table i list this in terms of the total number of quarter-hour periods in which each chimpanzee was visible to the observers, and the number of observation sessions (out of io) in which a chimpanzee was recorded as being present for observation. During these observations we witnessed a behaviour pattern which to our knowledge has not been described before in chimpanzees. This we have called the grooming-hand-clasp (see table 2, fig. 2). It occurred fourteen times, always at the beginning of, or during, an otherwise normal bout of social grooming. TABLE 2.

Meanwhile, the other hand engages in social grooming of the other individual's underarm area revealed by the upraised limb, using typical finger movements. In doing this, the two chimpanzees sit facing each other on the ground in a symmetrical configuration. Either both raise their right arms and groom with their left, or vice-versa. With one exception (see below) the participants engage in dyadic and mutual (as opposed to polyadic or reciprocal) social grooming. In addition to the invariant aspects described above, certain aspects of the behaviour varied: (a) Only adults and adolescents performed the behaviour: Nine of the 17 individuals in these age classes showed the behaviour while none of the io younger chimpanzees did so.</page><page sequence="6">W.

(b) Performance of the behaviour was not idiosyncratic, i.e. high- frequency participation by a few individuals did not bias the group's total. Individual frequencies were highly positively correlated with the amount of time present under observation (Spearman's r5=0o76, df= i5, p &lt;oooi, two- tailed).</page><page sequence="7">240 W. C. McGREW &amp; C. E. G. TUTIN (c) Both sexes participated in the grooming-hand-clasp to the same degree, i.e. proportional to the amount of time present for observation, but the dyads involved tended to be of mixed-sex rather than same-sex composition (X2 = 4-67, N= I4, df=I, P &lt; 0o05, one-sample test). (d) The median duration of a bout of the behaviour was IS seconds, and it ranged from about 3 seconds to slightly more than 6o seconds. In 3 of the I4 cases, 2 consecutive bouts of the grooming-hand-clasp occurred; each involved a change-over from one arm to the other. (e) In 7 of the I4 cases, it was noted that one individual actively supported the other's wrist or hand (the holder) while the other merely rested its upraised limb on the holder's. In all cases, the holder was the more active groomer and was subordinate in the social dominance hierarchy to the other participant (source of dominance rankings: Itani, pers. comm.). In only 2 of the I4 cases was the support seen to be entirely mutual, and in the other 5 cases it could not be determined. (f) The chimpanzees showed no preference for left- or right-handedness in performing the behaviour. (g) In all cases the grooming-hand-clasp occurred as part of a longer, normal social grooming bout, i.e. it never occurred in isolation. In at least 4 of the I4 cases, it initiated the bout. (h) Once, in the tenth observation session, a third individual participated in the interaction while the other 2 engaged in the grooming-hand-clasp: KS joined KM in grooming under WI's upraised right arm. How important are these observations? First, the number of observations is small, but the rate of occurrence is relatively high. 1 At an average rate of once every 2-4 hours, it exceeds that for all tool use, predatory, food-sharing, and almost all sexual and agonistic behaviours of the Gombe chimpanzee population (unpubl. data). Against this must be set the total absence of the grooming-hand-clasp among the Gombe chimpanzees in thousands of collective hours of observation. We totalled between us over I700 hours of observation at Gombe between November I972 andJanuary I975 and never saw the grooming-hand-clasp pattern. The behaviour patterns of the Gombe chimpanzees most closely resembling this are: (a) their brief use of an upraised arm in grooming invitation, but only one individual does this at a time and the upraised arm is not touched by the groomer (Goodall I968: 264); and (b) their more prolonged grasping of branches overhead while engaged in social grooming (see fig. 3). Second, the basic social grooming patterns of the two populations of chimpanzees have been described (e.g. Nishida I970; Goodall I968) and appear to be identical in form and similar in frequency. Moreover, they concur with descriptions of typical social grooming recorded for other wild populations of the same (Reynolds &amp; Reynolds i965) and different (McGrew et al. in press) geographical races of chimpanzees, as well as those exhibited by captive groups (Merrick I977). Thus it appears that at least one group of chimpanzees make use of a unique variation of social grooming in addition to performing the more typical species-wide pattern.</page><page sequence="8">W.

Galef (I976: 77) stipulates three means by which such a difference may occur: (a) genetically transmitted propensities influencing ontogeny; (b) similar independent transactions by different individuals with the physical environment; (c) inter-individual transmission of behaviour pattems through social leaming. It is possible that the behavioural differences seen here reflect differences in genotype, but in the absence of a strong selection pressure favouring the behaviour, it seems insufficient time for genetic drift to account for the marked behavioural contrast. Alternatively, it</page><page sequence="9">242 W. C. McGREW &amp; C. E. G. TUTIN is possible that Kasoge chimpanzees are responding individually to a factor present in their environment but absent at Gombe which influences the probability of survival. Such differences commonly occur when comparing the diets of the two populations: at Gombe oil palms (Elaeisguineensis) abound and their nuts constitute the most common item in the chimpanzees' diet (Wrangham 1975); at Kasoge few oil palms occur and the chimpanzees do not eat them (Nishida I974). It is more difficult to see how habitat differences could account for the grooming-hand-clasp. It is just conceivable that Kasoge chimpanzees suffer from an axillary ectoparasite for example, which requires more frequent grooming attention, but there is no evidence to suggest this, and the absence of higher frequencies of self underarm grooming or scratching makes it improbable. Similar speculation seems far-fetched in the absence of any apparent and relevant habitat differences. This leaves the third possibility that the grooming-hand-clasp of the Kasoge chimpanzees results from some sort of social learning. Abundant examples now exist of the social transmission of acquired behaviours in groups of non-human animals (see Galef 1976 for a lucid review). These have been demonstrated in quantitative observations and experiments in both field and laboratory. Such findings are not restricted to primates, but non-primate examples will be excluded from this discussion as being only indirectly relevant to questions of hominid evolution (e.g. Burton &amp; Bick 1972 on 'tradition drift'). Objections in the earlier literature towards biased anthropomorphism (Kroeber 1928) or simple reliance on anecdotes (Hart &amp; Panzer 1925) need no longer apply. The question now becomes: Do such social traditions in animals satisfy accepted anthropological criteria so that they may be termed cultural? To begin to answer such a question requires some definition of terms. Before undertaking this, we draw attention to the red herring of near-synonymity in terminology, which has been created by previous authors in referring to the phenomenon. At the least, this has meant using the word culture in quotation marks (e.g. Kummer 1971); more confusingly it has involved using terms like protoculture (Menzel et al. 1972), pre-culture (Kawamura 1972), or sub-culture (Kawamura 1959). In none of these examples do the authors justify the neologism, i.e. they provide no distinguishing criteria for differentiating the patterns that they discuss from human patterns subsumed by the term culture (Frisch 1977). The implication is that what non-human animals do is somehow intrinsically inferior to or less than human culture. This is undoubtedly true, at least in some senses, but the coining of new terms is no substitute for empirical evidence. The same point is made explicitly and often forcefully by anthropologists who claim that culture is by definition a human prerogative. That this was the traditional view is exemplified in the comprehensive review of concepts and definitions compiled by Kroeber and Kluckhohn (1952). Most of the i68 definitions of culture use terms which refer specifically to its human nature, and practically all of the remainder contain this by implication. From the content of the definitions it appears that most of the authors never considered the possibility of non-human culture, presumably because no convincing evidence existed then of natural populations of non-human primates</page><page sequence="10">W. C. McGREW &amp; C. E. G. TUTIN 243 exhibiting behaviours resembling culture. Evidence for cultural capacities, at least in captive chimpanzees, existed before recent field studies, e.g. Hayes and Hayes (I952), but it did not appear in anthropological journals. Those anthropologists (Kroeber 1928; Hallowell I960) who were aware of laboratory studies such as Kohler's (1927) dismissed them as insufficient, as did Kohler himself (1927: 266). Since knowledge of socially acquired behaviours from field studies of non- human primates has become available, especially for Japanese macaques (see below) and chimpanzees (e.g. Goodall I964) many students of cultural evolution have been slow to acknowledge it. Some (e.g. Montagu I968) ignored it and continued to postulate that culture is a species-specific human adaptation. Whether or not they were familiar with recent findings is unclear; most of these have been published in non-anthropological monographs and journals. Others (e.g. Dobzhansky 1972: 422) cited recent primatological findings but maintained that culture is uniquely human without providing specified criteria for scrutiny. After considering the evidence, Mann (1972: 382) admitted that some definitions of culture are sufficiently broad to apply to non-human species. He then proposed another system termed 'human culture' based on learned behaviours which modify the environment and which are crucial to survival. This presumes that these behaviours are essential for human but not for non-human survival, neither of which has yet been demonstrated. Holloway (I969) presented a scathing dismissal of the idea of non-human culture, asserting that the paramount difference in kind and not degree between man and the other animals is one of uniquely human imposition of arbitrary form upon the environment. A key element of this imposition is its non-iconic nature (I969: 400) but it is not clear how a branch stripped and clipped by a chimpanzee (see McGrew 1974, plates 2 &amp; 3) is more iconic than a pebble flaked by an early hominid (cf. Mann 1972: 38I). Weiss (1973) discussed the problem of human-ness and culture at great length, and readers wanting a comprehensive historical review of the problem are referred to his paper. Except for a brief passing reference to a popular periodical (1973: 1390) he ignored altogether the recent field primatological literature, and therefore his reassertion that culture is uniquely human comes as no surprise. This reluctance to deal with a still rapidly accumulating body of long-standing evidence is puzzling. Moore (I974: 537) has argued that the concept of culture as prevalently used in anthropology 'makes more sense as ideology than as empirical science', citing intra-disciplinary conflicts between schools of thought as the origin. The examples cited above would seem to confirm this. Defining culture as uniquely human presents several inter-related prob- lems. First, such a definition merely pushes the problem back a step and makes it one of defining human-ness. This may not seem to be a topical problem, given that Homo sapiens appears to be the only extant representative of the family Hominidae, but consider the hypothetical case of the discovery of a remnant, living population of ancestral hominids. In seeking to discern whether or not these creatures were cultural, we could no longer rely on the supposedly clear-cut hominid-pongid division into cultural and non-cultural.</page><page sequence="11">244 W. C. McGREW &amp; C. E. G. TUTIN Instead, we would be forced to discard the prevailing a priori generalisations as simplistic and vague. Discontinuities between extant forms of a given phyletic line sometimes lull us into forgetting that evolution is a continuous process (Hallowell I960). Lest this argument be rejected as merely a hypothetical one, it is worth remembering that such problems have always loomed large for students of prehistory. They have been faced with a continuum of artefacts of increasing complexity and the need to decide at what point in the hominid evolutionary line these could be classified justifiably as cultural (Holloway I969: 399). Two classic examples of this are the controversial Pliocene eoliths (Oakley I965: 5) and the osteodontokeratic culture of the South African australopithecines (Dart 1949). The problem of dealing with the products of behaviour without having access to the behaviour itself is perplexing enough without having to cope with the absence of most of the products. The predominance of perishable materials in the tool kits of extant foraging peoples (Oswald 1973) suggests that similar conditions prevailed for early hominids. This range of softer material, primarily plant parts, appears to have been lost forever, leaving only lithic or fossilised objects. These handicaps have not prevented prehistorians in the past from seeking to infer the existence of cultural capacities in earlier hominids (e.g. Dart 1956), and they seem unlikely to in the future. A second, more recent reconstructive effort which seeks to elucidate the origins of culture in the hominid past comes from ecological anthropology (Cohen I968). It is proposed that in the evolutionary process, culture somehow became the (uniquely?) human mode of adaptation, so that culture can be defined as the human ecological niche (Hardesty 1972). It is argued that such a niche transcends other niches, opening up a realm of opportunities previously unavailable to more specialised non-human species (Montagu I968; Swedlund 1974). This approach is not without its own problems: Swedlund (1974: 5 I 8) acknowledges that such reasoning may lead to an over- emphasis on culture as an explanatory device in prehistory because of its undeniably pervasive effect in later history. Hallowell (I960: 204) has raised a simpler point: it is difficult to imagine all the aspects of culture that presently exist in Homo sapiens as arising simultaneously in early hominid evolution. For instance, given a creature which manufactured tools and showed incest avoidance but lacked speech and property rights, could we assign to it culture? Re-stated, it is just as difficult to imagine a generalised selection pressure for some all-inclusive entity called culture as it is for intelligence (whatever that may be). What emerges from this is the need for an operational definition of culture, i.e. one which stipulates properties which are empirically observable and measurable (Cafagna I960: i i 8). Such a definition should also be compre- hensive, designating both necessary and sufficient conditions, otherwise it will join the long list of incomplete attempts catalogued by Kroeber and Kluckhohn (1952). Unless these criteria are met, the increasing accumulation of knowledge from field studies of non-human primates will only result in more confusion, rather than shedding light on the key aspects of cultural</page><page sequence="12">W. C. McGREW &amp; C. E. G. TUTIN 245 evolution. Unfortunately, according to Cafagna (I960: 130), none of the usual formulations of culture meets the formal criteria for definitions. Moore (1952; Anderson &amp; Moore I962) has amplified this point in sometimes pointed detail, noting especially those definitions which 'are expressed in figurative language which makes it difficult to determine what their acceptance would entail' (1952: 253). We concur with his conclusions and refer sceptics to them. In other words, there appears to be no satisfactory and accepted definition of culture to use in attacking the problem posed in the first paragraph of this article. A notable exception to the sweeping conclusion contained in the preceding sentence is Harris's (I964) attempt to develop a 'meta-taxonomy' of cultural parts which constitutes a comprehensive system. This system is logical, empirical and hierarchical, being ultimately based on the simplest possible behavioural units ('actones'). Although Harris devoted little attention to the behaviour of non-human animals (I964: 173), he considered that they have cultures of their own. Furthermore, he asserted that the differences between human and non-human cultures are matters of degree and not kind, but he presented no guidelines for specific cross-species comparison. What remains, in the absence of a single satisfactory working definition, is to be as exhaustive as possible in abstracting those qualities of culture which are thought to be crucial when seeking to establish whether or not it exists in a questionable (i.e. non-human) case. Fortunately Kroeber (1928: 33 i) has done just this with chimpanzee behaviour, in discussing K6hler's (1927: 314) observation of 'dancing' by his captive chimpanzee subjects: If one ape devised or learnt a new dance step, or a particular posture, or an attitude toward an object about which the dance revolved; and if these new acts were taken up by other chimpanzees, and became more or less standardized; especially if they survived beyond the influence of the inventor, were taken up by other communities, or passed on to generations after him-in that case we could legitimately feel that we were on solid ground of an ape culture. Assuming that these criteria can be generalised to behaviours other than dancing, we contend that the six conditions-innovation, dissemination, standardisation, durability, difusion and tradition-together form the beginnings of an operational definition of sufficient stringency to satisfy the doubting ethnologist. This is not of course the first attempt at proposing verifiable criteria of culture, but it is more strict and comprehensive than previous attempts (e.g. Frisch 1973; Kummer 1971). Conveniently, they form a logical chronological sequence. The case for further necessary stringencies is made below. Japanese macaques Before proceeding further, it must be stated that all six of the conditions given above have been satisfied by wild Japanese monkeys. Descriptions of studies by members of the Japan Monkey Centre first appeared in English 20 years ago (Imanishi 1957), and Western recognition of their implications for ,Sultural anthropology followed soon afterwards (Frisch 1959). The studies of acculturation (also called sub-culture propagation) of sweet-potato-washing,</page><page sequence="13">246 W. C. McGREW &amp; C. E. G. TUTIN wheat-placer-mining, sweet-eating are well-known and will not be detailed here. Frisch (1977), Itani and Nishimura (I973) and Kawamura (1972) have all published recent review articles on the subject, to which interested readers are referred. Several possible problems arise from these findings, however, which suggest that the six conditions given above are insufficient. The three best- documented examples mentioned above (all of which require the novel processing as well as the eating of new foods) and other lesser-known examples result from direct human intervention into the natural lives of the monkeys. This is made possible by their being provisioned over long periods with a variety of human foods, often combined with the animals' tendency to raid human crops. Furthermore, other examples of newly acquired habits such as the sweet-potato-catching behaviours described by Kawai (I967) and the hot- spring-bathing described by Suzuki (I965: 67) stem from the provisioning situation. Green (1975: 309) has even suggested that inter-troop differences in vocalisations (dialects?) which are apparently unrelated to feeding itself, may result from inadvertent conditioning during the provisioning process, rather than from social learning amongst monkeys. This is not to say that all cultural behaviours exhibited by Japanese monkeys result either directly or indirectly from provisioning: Stephenson's (1973: 66) quantitative analysis of inter- troop differences in courtship is an obvious example where it is difficult to see such a connexion. Moreover, there appears to be a confounding of two variables: It is provisioning (variable A) which permits close-range obser- vation (variable B); negative results from unprovisioned troops may merely reflect poor or sporadic observation conditions. However, the fact remains that traditional behaviours inJapanese monkeys appear to depend heavily upon provisioning. If we are to seek to make use of findings on non-human culture as clues to processes of natural adaptation which may have operated in hominid evolution, it would seem that we should minimise, if not eliminate from consideration, cases of artificial influences by humans. This is easier said than done, for we face another continuum. Examples from captive animals are fascinating and illustrative of species' adaptive capacities, (e.g. Eaton 1972; Menzel 1972; 1973; McGrew et al. 1975). They may tell us much about cultural processes under controlled conditions, as well as non-human intellectual abilities, but it is difficult (although not impossible) to see how snowball-making or ladder-and-piton- use could illuminate adaptive behaviours responsive to natural selection pressures. Instead they seem more likely to be ingenious responses by intelligent organisms frustrated by boredom in unstimulating environments. More complex problems arise with wild primate populations living in habitats significantly modified by human intervention. In addition to the previously noted dangers of intentional provisioning (Frisch 1959: 594; Reynolds 1975; Wrangham 1974) such effects occur when human beings introduce agriculture or forestry. Two examples of apparently cultural behaviour by Kenyan baboons will suffice to illustrate this: a direct effect may occur when primates devise novel tactical behaviours as part of crop-raiding (Maples I969; Maples et al. 1976). An indirect effect may occur when primates elaborate upon carnivorous propensities in areas cleared of large carnivores in</page><page sequence="14">W. C. McGREW &amp; C. E. G. TUTIN 247 order to allow cattle ranching (Strum 1975). (It is perhaps worth noting that these examples, as well as others that could be cited, are concerned with feeding behaviours). If extended further, this line of reasoning founders on both logical and practical grounds. It is unlikely that any wild primate population now exists in a state unaffected by human activity, and even the data-collecting activities of the careful scientist alone may be sufficient to produce key alterations. A state totally unaffected by human influences would be unnatural anyway, given man's legitimate place in the biosphere as at least a gatherer-hunter since prehistoric times. With these points in mind we propose to add two conditions to the six abstracted earlier from Kroeber: Non-subsistence, i.e. non-human populations exhibiting solitary or social behaviours which transcend subsistence activities. The latter are those which are directly involved in energy budgeting, i.e. the organism's inputs and outputs of calories and nutrients. Non-subsistence behaviours are unlikely to be correlated with the distribution of resources in the environment (see Galef I976: 79). Natural adaptiveness, i.e. non-human populations living in conditions in which direct human interference is absent and indirect human influences do not exceed levels exerted by human gatherer-hunters. With the domestication of animal and plant foods, the human species began for the first time to modify significantly the biosphere. If any wild population of non-human beings could be shown to exhibit behaviours which satisfy all eight of these conditions it would seem hard not to grant them the status of cultural beings. Chimpanzee culture? To what extent do wild chimpanzees satisfy these conditions? Using the Gombe chimpanzee population and its tool-use activities (Goodall I964; 1973) as convenient examples, the first six seem reasonably clearly de- monstrated, albeit to varying extents: Innovation. The problem here is to assign criteria based on negative evidence, i.e. the new appearance of a behaviour can only be recognised after a sufficient period of time in which its absence is notable. The problems of conditions of adequate observations have been raised earlier. At Gombe, all of the obvious candidates for cultural activities, e.g., termite fishing, leaf sponging, were apparently established at the time the studies began, and no new behaviours have arisen and persisted. Goodall (I973: I66) however gave examples of gestures and facial expressions which arose and enjoyed short-lived fashion. She also cited the invention of sticks as levers used to prise open cement and metal boxes containing bananas (Goodall I968: 207); this disappeared when the boxes were removed. The lack of more conspicuous innovation over an observation period of seventeen years may indicate that chimpanzee society is culturally conservative. Dissemination. There is little recognised transmission of apparently socially acquired behaviours among peers at Gombe; presumably this is a function of the limited frequency of innovation. Impressive circumstantial evidence exists however for the inter-individual transmission of behaviour from older to younger individuals, primarily from mother to offspring (Goodall I973: i68; McGrew I977). Galef (I976: 87) has pointed out that the presumed mechanism or mechanisms of observational learning underlying these patterns have yet to be demonstrated. This condition also requires the behaviour involved to be more than idiosyncratic; it implies that it needs to be exhibited by some significant but unspecified proportion (the majority?) of</page><page sequence="15">248 W. C. McGREW &amp; C. E. G. TUTIN the population. This proportion may vary with the particular behaviour pattern, e.g. only adult chimpanzees may have the strength to dispatch mammalian prey, whereas all but young infants may have the capacity to construct nests. At a minimum, we propose that it should be exhibited by more than one kinship lineage, thus excluding patterns shown by one exceptional individual and her offspring (e.g. Goodall I973: i65). At Gombe, all chimpanzees above the age of 2 years show termite fishing (Goodall I973: I57). Standardisation. The relative stereotypy of acquired behaviour, or in the case of material culture, the 'imposition of arbitrary form upon the environment' (Holloway I969: 395) iS empirically if not conceptually a matter of degree. In constructing tools to use in dipping for driver ants, wild chimpanzees demonstrate this in the choice of tool material and its subsequent modification (McGrew I974). Both the finished product and the way in which it is used differ significantly from the functionally related activity of fishing for termites (Goodall I973: I57). Durability. The performance of an acquired behaviour without the presence of a demonstrator occurs with all of the common chimpanzee tool-use activities at Gombe, e.g. termite fishing, ant dipping, leaf sponging, etc. The fluid pattern of day-to-day social interaction means that all chimpanzees (at least in adulthood) spend varying but frequent times alone (Goodall I968: 2 Ii). By the time an individual ceases to travel constantly with its mother in late childhood or early adolescence it exhibits the tool-use behaviours with full proficiency when alone. Diffusion. The spread of behaviours between 2 or more groups having at least a constant core composition, but within the same breeding population, has not been recorded at Gombe, although inter-community migration occurs. Presumably this is again a function of the rarity of cultural innovation. All of the major tool-use behaviours presently exist in indistinguish- able forms in both the Kasakela and Kahama communities, but the origins of this are unclear. In Cercopithecines, a common source of present similarities between groups may be past fission, when one group splits into two; Burton and Bick (I972: 55) termed this a behavioural founder effect. This fissioning is unknown in pongids, although it may have occurred in I97I when the Kahama chimpanzees shifted their range away from that of the Kasakela chimpanzees. Both groups shared the same socially acquired behaviours before this and their origins seem likely to be due to past diffusion rather than coincident origins. Tradition. Persistence from one generation to the next is present for all major acquired behaviours at Gombe, i.e. it persists in offspring of known age after their parents have died. Strong circumstantial evidence exists for at least one case of persistence through 3 generations (of the F family: Flo, Fifi and Freud) for behaviours such as termite fishing and leaf sponging. This is one of the major rewards of a longitudinal study, especially of a long-lived species. The additional condition of non-subsistence poses extra problems of a different nature. It is often possible to confuse a process of social exposure required for normal development with a process of social transmission (Galef I976: 79). The problem is to distinguish between necessary and sufficient conditions for the normal expression of a social behaviour. One way to assess this is by cross-cultural comparison of two or more wild primate groups (or populations) with as many other factors as possible held constant, especially those which might introduce methodological biases. For example, the same observers using the same techniques to record behaviour in the two groups should provide some degree of internal reliability and reduce the chances of terminological or definitional misunderstanding. The case would seem to be further strengthened if both groups exhibit the basic form of an acquired non- subsistence behaviour, with one but not the other exhibiting a further elaboration of it. Because non-subsistence behaviours should be (by</page><page sequence="16">W. C. McGREW &amp; C. E. G. TUTIN 249 definition) independent of physical environmental factors, any such differ- ences between groups can be termed social customs, and, if the other conditions are met, cross-cultural differences. The grooming-hand-clasp as practised by the Kasoge chimpanzees in contrast to their Gombe counterparts also fulfils these characteristics. Finally, we believe that no study yet done of wild chimpanzees satisfies the final condition of natural adaptiveness. Despite determined efforts in the Kasakati Basin, Tanzania (Izawa 1970) and the Budongo Forest, Uganda (Reynolds &amp; Reynolds I965; Sugiyama 1973) studies of non-provisioned chimpanzees have not yet yielded consistent, prolonged, and close-range observations of behaviour. Goodall (I964) observed several of the cultural behaviours of the Gombe chimpanzees such as termite fishing, leaf sponging, and ant dipping before the onset of provisioning; thus their presence in the behavioural repertoire cannot be due to direct human influences. Indirect human influences do exist there, however, e.g. the heavily-utilised oil palms which remain from past human cultivation, the small size (approximately 70 km) of the protected area surrounded by agricultural activity. Moreover, it is only since the use of heavy provisioning that the details of chimpanzee cultural behaviour have emerged. Until this degree of habituation is achieved elsewhere, it will be impossible to confirm or to query the significance assigned to cultural patterns so far described for provisioned or disturbed populations. The prospects of succeeding in such a study are unknown: why should truly wild chimpanzees tolerate a predatory species such as man at close range if they have a choice and perceive no gains from such a relationship? What is certain is that the opportunities for conducting such studies are dwindling fast, as human incursions into or destruction of chimpanzees' habitats proceeds at a depressingly rapid pace. We believe that the task is of sufficient importance to merit whatever scientific effort is necessary.
