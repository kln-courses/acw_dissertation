Teleology is peculiar to vital process, and since it appears in psychical phase as the pattern of aims and voluntary acts, ... it is a central theme in the study of mind; but it has had the least successful philosophical treatment of all our major problems.* I N tackling the "Great Shift" from animal behavior to human mentality, Susanne Langer has stressed four principles' 1.

View as fundamental the notion of an act, in a sense that will partly explain, but does not presuppose that of full agency. 3. Take account of the crucial importance of the process of Indzviduation. 4. Seek the essential differentia of human mentality in the produc- tion and use of symbols. In this paper, I propose to sketch how these principles can provide a perspective on some current ideas about the role of teleology in the Great Shift to human mentality. Langer has decried the anthropomorphism of much ethological talk about instinct (see ch. 15). She holds that "all animal behavior is instinctive, arising from organic sources as impulse seeking ex- pression in motor action" (II 45) The notion of "impulse" calls for explication in teleological terms. But for that we need a conception of teleology that is neither simply reductionist nor based on a con- fused attribution of conceptual capacities to lower animals (II 16). Such a notion now exists, and can be roughly sketched as follows: Teleological laws are a special case of causal laws, distinguished by additional structure in their antecedent. In the general form of a law (1): ( 1) (x)(Ax-Bx) where the arrow is a suitably interpreted connective, Ax can be ex- panded as in (2): (2) (x)(Bx -(probably)Gx) The resulting schema is (3): (3) (x)((Bx-Gx)-Bx) If (3) is true, then we can say that the function of B is to promote G. Informally, B has that function if its existence can be explained in terms of its tendency to bring about G as a consequence.' This analysis provides a genuine analysis of the notion of goal. [G in (3) ' My formulations ignore many necessary refinements. These are sufficiently de- tailed in recent literature, on which my broadly sketched account draws freely. See especially Charles Taylor, The Explanation of Behaviour (New York: Humanities, 1964); Andrew Woodfield, Teleology (New York: Cambridge, 1976); Jonathan Ben- nett, Linguistic Behaviour (New York: Cambridge, 1976), ch.

Reasons of space preclude my noting points of contact and difference. Nor can I discuss criticisms, which in my view the account survives.

LANGER 649 is a "goal" in virtue of its place in the schema.] It applies equally to everything for which we intuitively think teleological or func- tional explanation applies: artefacts, instinctual behavior, and in- tentional acts. The differences among those classes must be sought in the type of explanation that must be given for the fact that the teleological law holds in each case. To show this, I begin by noting a defect of the formulation just given. Any causal law (A -B) can be trivially given teleological form (4): (4) (x) ((B x -I(A -B)) -B x) ("Bx happens whenever it results in the instantiation of the law.") We need to add the qualification that ordinary causality is the de- fault assumption: the label 'teleological' applies only to what can- not be reformulated in nonteleological form. The additional struc- ture in (2) must be ineliminable. But when is this the case? Ernest Nagel has suggested that reduction of a teleological law can be effected by finding a categorical condition materially equi- valent to the conditional forming the antecedent.2 Thus, in an animal tropism, the condition is in a state in which turning right is generally conducive to increased light might be replaced by is caused by light gradients affecting its sensors to orient itself to the right. The trick is to find such a mechanism. Charles Taylor has speculated that, in some cases, as a matter of empirical fact, none would be found. These would be cases of basic (i.e., irreducible) teleology. Certainly this can't be ruled out a priori. But perhaps it should be ruled out on methodological grounds. For even if there are such cases, that fact could never be established. The most we could know at any particular time is that we haven't yet found the right material equivalent. What, in the light of past progress in finding mechanisms to explain apparently "insightful" or tele- ological behavior, could justify giving up the search? Brute teleo- logy would represent a cul-de-sac of science. Nevertheless, Nagel's strategy may not always be the best. The categorical mechanism may be epistemically inaccessible. In such cases we might be able to establish the truth of the teleological formula beyond reasonable doubt, but the mechanism would re- main a matter of speculation. More important, finding the mecha- nism may not give us the explanation we seek. What we need to understand is how it came about that some mechanism goes into action just when it is likely to have a certain result. That, whatever the mechanism, is what the teleological law asserts. 2 The Structure of ScieTnce (New York: Harcourt, Brace, and Wor-ld, 1961), ch. 12.</page><page sequence="4">650 THE JOUTRNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Two sorts of explanations are available: in terms of natural selec- tion, or of representation and planning. These are, respectively, as- sociated with the two types of prima facie teleological events: bio- logically adaptive characteristics, and those acts which result from mentality. The fit is not perfect, of course. We usually think of learning as involving mentality. And at least one kind of learning is simply the result of selection over a population of acts rather than of organisms. It is crucial to a proper understanding of the Great Shift to parcel out those cases which involve true mentality from those which are directly explicable on the selectionist model. Sociobiologists have recently come under much fire, precisely for applying (gene-)selectionist explanations to behavior subject to human motivation. The charge is not sound in principle. It con- founds two quite independent issues. One is whether the imme- diate or proximate causes of the behavior in question involve men- tal representation; the other is whether the behavior is ultimately explicable in terms of gene selection. The answer might be Yes to both; for nature selects for outcomes, not proximate causes. The cooperative behavior of humans and the "cooperative" behavior of ants, for example, belong to opposite ends of the Great Shift. At the level of proximate cause, they must be completely different. But from the evolutionary point of view they might be due to similar selective pressures. So what is the crucial difference? Following Langer's lead, we can hope to make progress if we can find intermediate forms. Can we find elaborate acts or act-sequences that owe their teleological appearance to the fact that they involve a primitive form of representation? Consider Langer's characterization of instinctive acts: "The be- ginning and the end of the act are its essential elements-impulse and consummation-spanned by a single arc of nervous tension" (II 68). "Impulse" is not mere cause, nor is "nervous tension" to be taken literally as a quantity of energy to be discharged. The terms are to be taken teleologically. Whether the act is learned or innate, it must involve feedback. And the mechanism involved in the test- ing or evaluation of feedback must already have some characteris- tics in common with representation. It must make discriminations, in accordance with which activity continues, is modified, or stops. This is sufficient to give the structure of the act its teleological form. It also involves two features traditionally associated with intentionality:3 'The ideas in this paragraph derive closely from an important unpublished paper by Anne MacKenzie on "The Intentionality of Desire," though MacKenzie may not approve of the use to which I put them.</page><page sequence="5">THIE PHILOSOPHY OF SUJSANNE K. I-ANGER 651 1. Intentional Inexistence: the condition "represented" in the test mechanism may never actually occur. This is the functional ana- logue of failure of reference in belief and of failure of satisfaction in desire. 2. Generality: This is to be taken in two senses: a. In contrast to specificity. Animals can be fooled by relatively coarse decoys. It is costly to refine perception and guard against unlikely mistakes. Selection finds an equilibrium at a degree of specificity adequate for practical purposes. This goes for learn- ing as well as evolution. But the point is not merely an eco- nomic one. It is also logical. This brings in the second sense: b. In contrast to particularity. However finely or coarsely it is spec- ified, the ject" represented will always remain a general type, never a particular. These features define what I shall call quasi-intentionality (Anne MacKenzie aptly calls it "nonmental intentionality"). They are shared by full-fledged intentionality, which Roderick Chisholm argued was coextensive with the mental.4 Intentional inexistence was one of his criteria. But generality is also a feature of full- fledged intentionality, as we can see from the contrast between cau- sality and explanation. Actual causal relations are always between particulars. They are neither mental nor intentional. But not every feature of particular events is relevant to the causal explanations in which they figure. Explanations are intentional, in that they re- quire only a degree of specificity.5 Quasi-intentionality cannot escape either form of generality. However specific the testing mechanism in the feedback loop, any particular that fits the "representation" involved will have proper- ties left unspecified. Thus far, quasi-intentionality is like the real thing. But full-fledged intentionality can pinpoint a particular in- dividual (though it need not). It is necessarily general in sense a, but not in sense b. We have found here, I suggest, a pivotal feature of the Great Shift. An objection must be faced. I have earlier admitted as a matter of methodological principle that no teleology can be considered irre- ducibly basic. My examples of quasi-intentionality all involve mechanisms. Talk of "representations," in such cases, can only be honorific. Teleology is understood only if it is reduced, i.e., if a mechanism can be found corresponding to the organism's capacity to detect the "test condition," But why then speak of teleology at 4"Sentences about Believing," Aristotelian Soc2ety Proceedings, ix' (1955/56): 125-148. 5See Donald Davidson, "Causal Relations," this JOIJRNAL, LXIV, 21 (Nov. 9, 1967): 691-703.</page><page sequence="6">652 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY all? Why not simply say that some mechanisms are usefully viewed as teleological for heuristic purposes, just as long as they are not fully understood? To answer this, we can draw inspiration from Langer's stress on the importance of individuation (ch. 9). Langer points out that in- dividuation in organisms is a matter of degree: The activities that compose a particular life ... are so many and so variable that even in a single organism individuation may go to dif- ferent lengths in separate directions (I 337). This draws attention to the fact that we can make sense of teleology only if we can single out a process or (in Langer's preferred term) an act, caused as a unit type by either selection or intention. This can be illustrated without reference to the issue of mentality. A re- cent article6 develops the idea that we can speak irreducibly of the immune system's making errors. One example is auto-immune re- sponse, triggered not by some genuinely "foreign" substance but by "misrecognition of self." Even if we can always give a merely chemical account of the response and its causes, this may result in the loss of an epistemologically indispensable level of explanatory information. In the course of any particular organism's life span, a selection process has led to the establishment of the immune re- sponse in question, But it is only if we think of it as a response of that particular organism as such that we can identify some of the effects of the mechanism as "normal" and others as "errors." And this, in turn, requires that we take seriously as a natural fact the individuation of the organism affected. Various epistemologically useful concepts, "individual"; "response"; its "causes and effects"; "teleological law", are tied together into a relatively autonomous level of explanation (though this is not, of course, a "basic" level of explanation in Taylor's sense). Let us now return to the quest for the difference between the in- stinctual grade and the full-fledged mental grade of intentionality. A good place to start is with those of Chisholm's original criteria which do not figure in my definition of quasi-intentionality. One such criterion is failure of substitutivity of co-referential terms. Here, as in the case of the definition of teleology, we must note that we can always extend the language of full-fledged inten- tionality to mere tropisms. But we don't have to; and good method demands that we do so only if we must. Suppose a hungry frog is in the presence of a freshly killed fly. The fly is food. It is present to the frog. Yet the frog does not eat it. We might describe this sit- Edwin Levy and Mohan Matthen, "Teleology, Error, and the Human Immune System," this JOURNAL, IXXXI, 7 (July 1984): 351-372. See esp. 355, 363.</page><page sequence="7">THE PHIIOSOPHY OF SUJSANNE K. LANGER 653 uation as one in which the frog has failed of some teleological law: hungry frogs will eat available food. It desires food; it does not de- sire that motionless speck. Yet that motionless speck is food. So do we not have here failure of substitutivity? No. When described at the right level of neurological fact, the frog was not in the presence of the right stimulus. Epistemic hypotheses are unnecessary: frog's eyes simply do not detect motionless specks.7 In any case there is an ambiguity in the notion of substitutivity of co-referential terms. The substitutivity failure rejected in the case of the frog concerned only representations of materially equivalent types. But what typically fails, in fully intentional contexts, is sub- stitution of singular terms referring to material particulars. I con- clude that the capacity for singular reference constitutes one neces- sary condition of full-fledged (mental) intentionality. The concept of reference does not figure importantly in Langer's account of "symbolism," to which she looks for the key to her Great Shift. But the preceding discussion suggests that the capacity for singular reference is of crucial importance. Singular reference is presupposed by full-fledged human memory and intentional ac- tion. It requires a conceptual scheme capable of distinguishing between qualitatively indiscriminable individuals. This in turn means that the organism in question must have a biography. For no expression can genuinely refer to a particular, if there has been no moment at which that reference was fixed for some particular user. For this reason, no innate idea could ever actually refer, ex- cept in the Pickwickian sense in which a chiromantist's client might exclaim: "A tall dark man! That must be George!" Refer- ence can, of course, be inherited second-hand from other members of a community of users. So it commonly presupposes the kind of social matrix which many have on independent grounds thought crucial to the human difference. These features, I submit, make singular reference a promising criterion of the passage from quasi-intentionality to full-fledged mentality. The analysis of reference itself is no easy task. Certainly I have none to offer. But though it poses a hard problem, we can hope that it covers a narrower gap than the general difference be- tween instinctive and mentally motivated behavior. In this way it represents a promising implementation of Langer's strategy of sid- ling across the Great Shift in small steps. RONALD B. DE SOUSA University of Toronto 'See J. Y. Lettvin, H. R.
