A relatively minor issue for Canadians, who watched with often bemused detachment their ally's struggling with Castro, Cuba soon became rather the litmus test of Canadian governments' foreign policy independence for a surprising portion of public opinion. Canada's best cubandlogo, John Kirk, has in the present volume teamed up with a rare specialist on that country's relations with the Organisation of American States, Peter McKenna, to tell story of the Cuban-Canadian relationship over the nearly four decades of Castro's rule. This is done with verve and a clear love for the subject. It is also clearly done with a view to convincing United States readers that there is a better way to deal with the Cubans than seeking to destroy their government and that the one approach taken by Canada has yielded much better fruit than has anything Washington has tried. The resulting book is well arranged, humorous on occasion, and a generally good read. It deals with a little known subject and tackles it well. And it is the only work of its kind. There are, however, some points of history which need a fair bit of nuance. The volume on occasion comes close to polemic in its generally valuable desire to show the benefits of the bilateral relationship while remaining critical of Canadian foreign policy as well. For example, it is surely an exaggeration to refer to Ottawa and Washington as having a 'common front in foreign policy', as indeed the book goes on to show in the case of Cuba. Likewise it is an overstatement to say that 'Ottawa steadfastly refused to criticize Washington's activities in the (Central American) region', or that 'the prime minister strongly supported the I989 invasion of Panama'. More troubling if understandable is the sometimes rather uncritical view adopted of the Castro government and this can lead to some difficulties in figuring out why Canadian policy developed in the ways it did. There is little mention of the important problem of Cuba's 'export of revolution' phase in foreign policy from 1962 to 1968 and its impact on Ottawa's perspective. There is no mention at all of more recent backsliding on the part of the Cuban government where its opening up to the outside world is concerned. Ottawa has been especially disappointed by Cuban performance in the area of human rights and troubled by such retrograde steps as the hamstringing of Cuba's prestigious Centro de Estudios de la Americas, and the seemingly growing resistance to change, including with joint programmes in collaboration with Canada and Canadian universities. Despite these difficulties, this work is absolutely essential reading for those interested in either the international relations of Cuba or Canada, or both, and will reward those with an interest in US-Cuban relations as well. Royal Military College HAL KLEPAK of Canada Carlos Escud6, Foreign Policy Theory in Menem's Argentina (Gainesville FL: University Press of Florida, I997), pp. I66, $49.95 hb; ?45.oo hb. This book evaluates the tradition of Political Realism in the theoretical discourse of the discipline of international relations, and finds it wanting on theoretical, normative and practical grounds. It offers what is described as a theory of</page><page sequence="2">220 Reviews 'Peripheral Realism', which is based on a 'citizen-centric' foundation. This 'Peripheral Realism' takes foreign policy making as the primary locus of theoretical investigation and argues that, for peripheral (the term is Escude's) states, the primary goal of policy must be economic development for the benefit of citizens, not elites. The approach is Realist because it advocates self-interested behaviour to achieve these ends. Peripheral states should avoid unnecessary conflict with great powers and abstain from both interstate power politics and 'costly idealistic interstate policies' (p. 88). The approach is deeply critical of Realist theories and theorists such as Kenneth Waltz, Hedley Bull, Robert Gilpin and Stephen Krasner, who, Escude argues, are guilty of over-simplification, naivete, logical inconsistency, empirical errors and ideological bias (as is all international relations theory according to Escude). Another criticism of Realism is the excessive anthropomorphism in relation to the state. The book utilises empirical material from the practice of Argentine foreign policy to assert that where Argentine foreign policy-makers follow the dictates of orthodox Realism, the policies pursued are disastrous for Argentine citizens (as under Alfonsin) but where Peripheral Realism is pursued (as under Menem) the results are somewhat happier. The most interesting of the criticisms of Political Realism is that which highlights the tendency to treat states as akin to a human individual and, at the same time, to ignore the costs to real individuals of foreign policies that result in war or conflicts with other states. Escude's remaining criticisms are not new and have been articulated with more sophistication elsewhere. One of the problems with this book is that its author is culpable of the very failures of which he accuses the Political Realists, particularly in the form of over-simplification of the theories and authors he chooses to pillory. Generalisations way beyond the scope of the data are presented and in a tone that verges on personal abuse as opposed to careful evaluation. Hedley Bull, for example, displays a 'condescending sympathy' towards issues of justice which 'is consistent with his ideological drive to upholster the state system' (p. 73). The author's argument rests on the premise that foreign policy makers who put Realist theories into practice cause damage to the interests of their citizens. To make this argument the author must insist that foreign policy makers in peripheral countries actively read and utilise Realist authors as guides to policy. Such an interpretation is at best highly improbable and at worst demonstrates a basic error in terms of conflating Realist theory (explanations of policy) with the political practice of statesmen and women (the policy itself).
