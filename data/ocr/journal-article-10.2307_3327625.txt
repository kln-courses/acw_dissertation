<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN INTRODUCTION TO OMNISCIENCE By WALLACE I. MATSON AN omniscient being (hereafter 'o.b.') knows everything there is to be known. Can we form a conception of such a being? It seems we can. I know some things, I am ignorant of others; I can conceive what it would be like to have the gaps filled in. However, what I know I have learnt, and learning is a process in time. If there is an infinite number of things to be known, an o.b. could not have learned them one by one, nor even (finite) group by group. Hence if there is an o.b., either (i) there is not an infinite number of things to be known, or (ii) knowing does not entail having learnt. (i) In a sense the number of things to be known is infinite, for instance answers to questions of the form, 'What is the nth digit in the decimal expansion of rr ?'. On the other hand, it would seem unreasonable to deny that some person had knowledge of the 87th digit if he knew the algorithm for calculating the expansion and could work it out to the 87th place in a fairly short period of time, say 3 microseconds. This example suggests that there are two ways of knowing the values of digits in the decimal expansion of r: one requires an infinite storage, the other does not. Let us then be understood to be discussing hence-</page><page sequence="2">AN INTRODUCTION TO OMNISCIENCE 9 forth a 'minimal' o.b., that is, one whose store of knowledge contains the least number of items required for completeness. In the example, know- ing the digits seriatim would involve an infinite number of bits in the storage, whereas the algorithm would count for only a few. Some departments of knowledge are finitely axiomatizable, with finite decision procedures for theorems. If all knowledge is of this sort, and if there is a finite number of departments of knowledge, then om- niscience does not entail infinite storage capacity. In that case it must be possible in principle to become omniscient. It may be of interest to speculate on whether these conditions are in fact fulfilled. If mathematics and necessary knowledge in general are to be included, the situation seems hopeless, for evidently the number of necessary truths is infinite, and so is the number of possible schemata for axioma- tizing them. The only way out would appear to be the elaboration of a systematic, finite way for ordering possible axiomatizations. However, need we endow a minimal o.b. with necessary knowledge at all? If, as philosophers hold, there is no necessary knowledge of matter of fact, it ought to be possible to know all the facts there are without knowing any necessary truths-which merely serve to facilitate transition from one fact to another. The o.b. would have to know when the cat is on the mat, but would not need to know that for all cats and mats either the cat is on the mat or she is not. One might even go so far as to question the need for the o.b.'s knowledge to be propositional. For in some sense, dogs and fleas know when the cat is on the mat. Could not every fact, in principle, be grasped in this mode of nonverbalized immediate apprehension? No. For there are language users in the world. The o.b. consequently has to know what the occurrence of the noise, 'The cat is on the mat', signifies in certain contexts. But knowing this, and similar facts, amounts to know- ing a language. A similar argument leads to the welcome conclusion that the o.b. could not be ignorant of mathematics and the other a priori sciences (if there are any); at least He would have to know at t as much mathe- matics as any human being knows at t. To avoid tediousness one might as well concede that He would know all of mathematics, whatever that may mean. I suspect it means nothing, that mathematics is open-ended, so that the notion, 'omniscient mathematician', is without sense, just as, for the same sorts of reasons, the notion, 'omnilingual being'-one who speaks all fossible languages-is senseless. Perhaps this is no great difficulty for the conception. However, it does lead to embarrassments. The o.b. must not only know all the mathe- matics and linguistic usage any human being now knows, He must know all that anyone is ever going to know. For by definition no human being</page><page sequence="3">10 ANALYSIS can know more than the o.b.; but if the o.b. had to wait (say) for Zamen- hof to invent Esperanto and then learn it, there would be some interval during which Zamenhof contradictorily knew more than the o.b. Or is there a way out-is perhaps Zamenhof's intellect not really separate from the o.b.'s? That way lies Pantheism. Before we are through, we shall come upon another route to the same destination. Apart from these mathematico-linguistic difficulties, is there a possibility that the o.b. might be finite? That depends not only on how big the world is, but on metaphysics. If the world is made up of events, and if there are only a finite number of them, then a finite o.b. is a pos- sibility even if 'things are entirely loose and separate'. If on the other hand Spinoza was right and everything logically possible exists in a determinate order, even an infinity of events does not then entail infinite storage in the o.b. The axioms from which everything can be deduced might be finite in number. They might even have to be. Or Spinozism might be modified to the extent of admitting some finite number of existential propositions which could not be known from their self- evidence but only empirically, which propositions, however, would entail descriptions of all the other events. On Spinozistic or quasi-Spinozistic principles there is no special problem about knowledge of the future. But while Spinozism entails de- terminism, the converse does not hold. Determinism might be true even if it is false, or senseless, to speak however elliptically of one event's implying another. It may be the case, that is, that as a matter of fact there are laws of nature that make the Laplacian sort of prediction pos- sible, although the laws in question have no special logical status. Here the problem of induction rears its head. If that is a problem for us, it must equally be a problem for the o.b. alias Laplace's Demon. He may make his predictions, and they may keep coming out on the nose, but how is he to know that they must continue to do so, if by hypothesis there is no logical guarantee of it? Omniscience presupposes the solution of the problem of induction. A perfect guesser is not an o.b. The situation is not altered fundamentally if instead of Spinozistic or Laplacian determinism the real state of affairs is given by quantum mechanics on the Copenhagen interpretation. In that case every state- ment about the future is qualified as probable to such and such a degree. Knowledge of these probabilities is, however, genuine knowledge, and the best obtainable in principle. Therefore the o.b. has it. His position with respect to the problem of induction is not altered, since probabilis- tic statements if meant as predictions are liable to the same hazard of a 'change in the course of nature'. If Spinozism is false, or if the problem of induction presents an insuperable difficulty, a great burden is lifted from omniscience, for</page><page sequence="4">AN INTRODUCTION TO OMNISCIENCE 11 then there are (are) no future facts, consequently no heed the o.b. is obliged to take for the morrow. (ii) Now let us suppose that there is an infinite number of loose and separate facts to be known. The o.b. then must have infinite storage capacity. Therefore the o.b. must be nonmaterial, to avoid crowding everything else out of space. Right here some of us may give up the attempt to conceptualize the o.b. If we do not, more troubles come in trying to form a notion of the knowledge such a being might have that would be different from mere registration. I explain myself. The computers in the Bureau of Internal Revenue today already approach omniscience with respect to economic trans- actions in the U.S.A. It is all too easy to imagine a battery of such machines registering all the information about everything. But these furnish no model for an o.b., not because they are material or because they are mere machines-we can consider them endowed with con- sciousness if we like-but because they are passive, dependent on an external input for data. To be sure, we are in like case for almost all our knowledge, which we perforce take on authority. But in the sense rele- vant to this discussion, only knowledge acquired in the primary way, without intermediaries, can be in question. An o.b. could not be beholden to another. If the o.b. knew that Mr. Jones was absolutely trustworthy, He would be justified in accepting Jones's testimony. But as previously noted, He could have no need to, since there could not be an interval during which Jones knew something the o.b. did not. So where deduction is not possible, the o.b. must find out for himself. Now it might be suggested that the o.b. just knows. We can imagine without contradiction an Internal Revenue computer that just ticks off the amount every time I make a bank deposit. Telepathy and clairvoy- ance with no intermediaries are logically possible. Such extraordinary phenomena are not, however, models of know- ledge. The revenue agents have to come up with the incriminating check before they can prosecute me, the telepath has to find out whether he was right by interviewing eye-witnesses. If he is perpetually imprisoned in solitary he cannot-logically-know that his hunches are right. For whatever the analysis of knowing may be, it must at least include the having of good reason for believing. There can be no such thing as cognitive parallelism.' This is a logical point. Therefore the o.b.'s knowledge of the world must be based either on causal interaction with it, or identity of object and knower. Causal interaction is not a promising suggestion. We should have not only the mind-body problem writ large, but the further difficulty of 1 Nor did even the Occasionalists claim there could be. In their system God was directly aware of, and awarely directing, the mental and physical series. We were justified in trusting to God's goodness as the basis of our knowledge, which was all secondary.</page><page sequence="5">12 ANALYSIS imagining what the o.b. might use instead of sense organs. This is not just anthropomorphism; if the o.b. is to inspect a tomato, even He must somehow intercept and transform energy emanating from the appropri- ate region; that is what inspecting is (in part). We must suppose, then, that the o.b.'s relation to the world is like that of our soul to our body, whatever that is: the o.b. knows everything that goes on, as it goes on, by the direct awareness that comes of being, or being a conscious aspect of, those things. Newton was right, or at least on the right track, in making space the divine sensorium. Summing up: (1) If the world is either (a) finite or (b) infinite but groupable into a finite number of classes such that knowledge of a finite number of items in the class entails knowledge of all the rest of the items, then there may be a finite o.b. (2) If either (a) condition lb holds or (b) there exists a (dis)solution to the problem of induction such that there is knowledge of the future, as opposed to happy guesses, the o.b. knows the future. Otherwise not; but not at the expense of His omniscience, for then there is no future to know (yet). (3) If none of the conditions thus far enumerated holds, an o.b. must have a mind of infinite storage capacity. He must therefore be immaterial. Since He must be connected to the world known, but not as effect to cause, He cannot be distinct from the world. Infinite omniscience entails Pantheism. If the o.b. is not merely a knower but a doer also, various paradoxes arise concerning His self-knowledge. Further antinomies are generated if knowledge by acquaintance, specifically of emotions, is demanded of Him. But no doubt enough has been said already to confirm Santayana's insight: Mind was not created for the sake of discovering the truth. The absolute truth has its own intangible reality, and scorns to be known. The function of mind is rather to increase the wealth of the universe in the spiritual dimension, by adding appearance to substance and passion to necessity, and those emotions of wonder, adventure, curiosity, and laughter . . . which omniscience would exclude (Realms of Being, xiii). To which we might add-if it is an addition-that although the o.b. knows all of philosophy, He cannot philosophize. University of California, Berkeley</page></plain_text>
