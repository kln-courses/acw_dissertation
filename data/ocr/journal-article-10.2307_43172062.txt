Two hundred twenty-seven individuals from 16 states in the United States, one U.S. Territory, and one Cana- dian Province responded to this invitation and contrib- uted data from more than 2,400 students. Rationale for Study In previous work with students, a number of researchers (McNair and Stein 2001; Ryman 1974; Tunnicliffe and Reiss 2000; Osborne and Freyberg 1985; Stepens 1985; Bell 1981) have found that student understanding of plants and what plants need to grow is often limited. For example, in McNair and Stein's research (2001), when asked to draw a plant, both children and adults most often drew or thought about flowering plants. Bell (1981) found that some chil- dren did not consider trees to be plants. Researchers also found that students were more likely to consider an organ- ism to be a plant if it possessed specific characteristics or parts, such as flowers or stems (Ryman 1974). When considering what plants need to grow, ideas can become even more complicated. According to the Na- tional Science Education Standards (NRC 1996), students in kindergarten to grade four should understand that plants have basic needs that include air, water, nutrients, and light. However, the idea that plants need things pro- vided by people may make more sense to young students than plants having basic needs. For example, we water our plants, set them in a lighted space, and plant them in soil. These needs may be more obvious to students than the idea that plants need air to grow. In addition, students often ascribe human characteris- tics to organisms as they interpret the organism's attributes and functions with respect to their own experiences (Osborne and Freyberg 1985; Stein and McNair 2002). Students often believe that plants need "food" in a way that is similar to the way people do. So, when students hear that plants "make their own food," they are often thinking about food in terms of something that the plant ingests or "eats" or that plants obtain their food through their roots (Roth 1985; Smith and Ander- son 1984; Barker 1995).

After all, plants are a vital component to our Earth, and they are the basic connection between the Sun and the energy flow that exists in all ecosystems. Data Collection Procedures The investigators who participated in this study fol- lowed an interview protocol that was included in the September 2002 S&amp;C invitation. In this protocol, the investigators were provided with one set of pictures depicting plants and objects that are not plants and another set of pictures showing things plants need or don't need for growth. Using the first set of pictures, the investigators asked each student to classify the pictures as plants or not plants and to explain what all plants have in common. With the second set of pictures, the students were asked to identify the things plants need for growth and to explain how each of the things they identified actually help a plant grow. (For a complete description of the interview protocol, refer to the September 2002 issue of S&amp;C or view the article at www.nsta.org/elementaryschool.) After the investigators completed collecting data from individual students, all of the students' responses were transferred to a group tally sheet and sent to a central location for compilation and analysis. The Results: Which Hems Were Plants? Figure 1 shows the results of students' classification of items as plants or not plants. Overall, the kindergarten to grade eight students surveyed had a consistent grasp of which pictures depicted plants and which did not. For example, most of the students were able to identify the picture of the flower as a plant, and there was consensus that the bush, Venus's flytrap, and fem were plants. Most students knew that bread mold wasn't a plant; however, about half misclassified the mushroom as a plant. This latter finding supports earlier research in which investigators found students were more likely to identify an organism as a plant as long as it had struc- tures that looked plantlike (Ryman 1974). In this case, the stalk of the mushroom resembles the stem of a plant. When reviewing the students' responses, it became evident that characteristics students strongly associate with plants are: • They have leaves and stems; • They are green; and • They grow in the ground/ soil. Thus, students very frequently selected the flower, fem, and bush as being examples of plants, as these examples clearly show the aforementioned characteristics. They were less sure of the grass, oak tree, pine tree, and Venus's flytrap. September 2003 47</page><page sequence="3">Figure 2. Students' responses to "Do plants need this to grow?"

Stu- dents in grades six to eight appeared to have more diffi- culty identifying certain organisms as plants than the students in kindergarten to grade five. For example, 78 percent of the students in grades six to eight identified grass as a plant, while 81 percent of the students in kindergarten to grade two and 86 percent of the students in grades three to five identified grass as a plant. The same pattern was shown in how the students classified an oak tree and a pine tree. While there are many possible explanations, one possibility is that stu- dents begin with a fairly narrow definition of a "plant" and subsequently broaden it as they are exposed to more examples in school and in their daily lives. Then, as students learn more about scientific classification schemes they begin to narrow these broadened defini- tions once again. The two items that appeared most difficult for students to characterize were the seeds and the mushroom. This is not surprising because seeds have the potential to become a plant and mushrooms have many plantlike characteristics. These two items elicited many explanations from students, such as "plants come from seeds" and "plants are green," to let the teacher know why they were characterizing the picture as "yes," "no," or "not sure." The Results: What Do Plants Need to Grow? Figure 2 displays kindergarten to grade eight students' ideas about what a plant needs for growth. Like the data related to identifying plants, the results are fairly consis- tent at all grade levels. For example, most students identified the Sun, water, potting soil, and air as the most important factors in plant growth. When considering what plants need in order to grow, students tended to attribute anthropomorphic character- istics to plants. They discussed plants as needing what humans require in order to grow. The ideas that plants "eat," "drink," and "breathe" were expressed frequently. For example, when talking about the importance of water for plants, students generally felt water was needed for the plant to "drink" or provided nutrients for the plant. Although "plant food" is a term commonly used to describe plant fertilizer, most students identified plant food as one of the most important factors in plant growth. One student stated: "plant food keeps the plant from getting hungry." Although students often explained that plants "eat" when describing plant food, very few stu- dents at any grade level indicated that plants needed the "people food" examples (cereal, sandwich). It appears that while they think plants "eat," the students also have some understanding that plants eat different things and through different types of processes. When talking about the Sun, the students in kindergar- ten to grade two generally said it helps the plant grow by "warming" the plant. The students in grades three to eight said the Sun helps the plant make food, gives the plant energy, and provides heat for the plant. Even though these students stated that the Sun helps plants make food and gives plants energy, there was very little discussion about photosynthesis or the process of how plants make their 48 Science and Children</page><page sequence="4">Figure 3.

Young children seemed to understand that plants need water and sunlight. A surprising number of stu- dents in kindergarten to grade two also understood that plants need air (78 percent). This could also be because they know that humans need air and consider plants to need the same things that we do. Many of these students also believed that plants need oxygen (58 percent) and sometimes explained that they thought that oxygen and air were the same. However, it was clear that most stu- dents at these grade levels were unfamiliar with carbon September 2003 49</page><page sequence="5">1 o 3 2 £ t/i S £ dioxide and whether plants need it to grow. One student called it "a poison." In the older grades, students appeared to be more familiar with carbon dioxide. More than half of the students (59 percent) in grades three to five and 65 percent of the students in grades six to eight indicated that plants needed it to grow. However, sometimes these students indicated that a "reverse" type of breath- ing was taking place with plants breathing in carbon dioxide and exhaling oxygen. It seems that students learn that oxygen is a product of photosynthesis, but do not understand that the plant also uses oxygen. Relating the Results to the Standards The kindergarten to grade four Standards (NRC 1996) indicate that by the time the students reach fourth grade, they should know that plants need air, water, nutrients, and light. In this study, kindergarten to grade four stu- dents' ideas of plants needing air and water appeared to be unrelated to the production of food. Instead, their expla- nations included the ideas of the plant needing the air for "breathing" and the water for "drinking." They also indicated that the Sun provided warmth for the plants, but did not talk about sunlight as neces- sary for plant growth. These appear to be age-appropri- ate responses for this group of students. Only a few kindergarten to grade two students identified roots as a common structure of a plant, and some of these students said that potting soil "holds the plant in the ground." It appears that stu- dents in kindergarten to grade two need more experiences observing different root sys- tems of plants. Through these observations, they may come to the realization that these structures are an integral part of a plant and that they are not only responsible for anchor- ing the plant, but also for the transport of water and essen- tial nutrients. There also appears to be a need to help students in kindergarten to grade two visualize plants as living things. This notion seems to become more prevalent among the views of the students in grades three to eight. Many of the students in grades three to eight identified air, water, nutrients, and light as important for plant growth. However, stu- dents' comments indicated that a good por- tion of the students in grades three to five believed that the air was needed for breathing and the water was for plants to drink. It was unclear as to what role the stu- dents in grades three to five believed light and nutrients played in plant growth. Most middle school students agreed that sunlight and nutrients were important for plant growth, how- ever, their understandings of the components of the Standards (NRC 1996) for students in grade five to eight dealing with how plants make food and how energy is passed through an ecosystem were unclear. Plus, the fact that many middle school students still clung to the idea of plants "breathing air" and "drink- ing water" leads one to believe that they have a limited understanding of how plants make food. Teaching Implications In reviewing the results, we found that the students' explanations of what they were thinking - and why - were very helpful in understanding students' existing concepts about plants. For example, when a student correctly states that bread mold is not a plant, it is more important to find out why the student has that belief rather than simply focusing on whether the answer is correct. Informal conversations with children can re- veal more about their understandings than responses to closed questions. When responding to whether a telephone pole is a plant, students often used the explanation that the telephone pole is not living and therefore not a plant. They also thought this was a "tricky" question since it is made from a plant. Similarly, students' responses to pictures of things that can help plants to grow, but may not be absolutely necessary (e.g., plant food, worms, bees) often provided us with explanations about how students believe these things help plants to grow. Even young students ap- peared to understand many ba- 50 Science and Children</page><page sequence="6">sic characteristics of plants and their needs. Knowing this, teachers can move beyond what is already understood into ideas about plants that students haven't considered. Providing real examples of nonflowering plants or plants without the typical features that students are familiar with may help them to broaden their understand- ings. Letting children "dig in" to observe root structures and consider their functions may help students to think more deeply about how plants are different from animals. The teacher can also ask questions to highlight ideas that may not be readily observable to students. For example, "What exactly is a bee doing when it travels from flower to flower?" Students' interpretations of this included "delivering things like honey from flower to flower" and "sharing" resources among the flowers. The idea that the bee is obtaining a substance that it needs and, in the process, aiding in plant reproduction is for- eign to young students. Figure 3 on page 49 displays some of the most common student misconceptions about plants revealed in this study. In addition, this table provides suggestions that may help students refine their ideas related to plants and plant growth. Seek and Share Like the previous S&amp;C studies (Barman 1997; Barman et al. 2000), this study provided interesting insights into specific science concepts of students in kinder- garten to grade eight. We hope that this study serves as a catalyst to encourage you and your colleagues to seek ways of probing your students' understanding of vari- ous science concepts and that the findings from this study will help guide your future planning of units dealing with plants. ■ Charles R.
