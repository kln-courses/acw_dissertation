WILLEY INTRODUCTION IN PERUVIAN ARCHAEOLOGY the term Chavin, derived from the site of Chavin de Huantar, has come to stand not for a single, easily definable concept but for a series of concepts. It has been used to denote an art style, an archaeological period, an "horizon," a "culture," a "basic or root culture," a "civilization," and an "empire." As there is divergence of opinion on what is meant by Chavin, on its stylistic identifications, on chronology and distribution, on associated cultural contexts, and on functional interpretation, it seems desir- able at this time to examine just what has been or can be subsumed under the Chavin designation. This essay takes as its purpose such a review and critical appraisal of the problem.* DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHAVIN CONCEPTS J. C. Tello-The late Dr Julio C. Tello was the foremost proponent of Chavin as a civilization basic to Andean development.1 Middendorf2 may have been the first to conceive of a widespread Chavin culture and pre-Incaic empire, but the elaboration of the theme was Tello's. In Tello's earlier writings3 he placed Classic Chavin, as it was known from the stone monuments of Chavin de Huantar and from the Cupisnique pottery of the coast, as a culture of the "Second Epoch." At that time Tello's "First * I am indebted to Drs Donald Collier and Wendell C. Bennett for numerous suggestions and points of fact. Dr Irving Rouse and Mr Michael Coe also gave me the benefit of their criticisms. 1 Kroeber, 1944, pp. 81-82. 2 Middendorf, 1893-95. 3 Tello, 1922. 103</page><page sequence="2">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY Epoch" cultures were "Archaic Andean" (represented by Aija stone sculpture and three-color negative painting of the Callejon de Huaylas) and "Pre-Chavin" (undescribed). Somewhat later Tello4 dropped the "Pre-Chavin" concept, but "Archaic North Andean" still remained as anterior to Classic Chavin.5 By "Archaic North Andean" it is clear that Tello referred to the three-colored nega- tive painted ware (the Recuay style), not just the plain tripod vessels of the north highlands.5a For example, a Recuay three-color modelled cat-head is spe- cifically indicated as a crude or "embryonic" manifestation of the strain that was later to climax in Classic Chavin.6 This same chronological system assigned Wari, Pucara, and "the first period of Tiahuanaco" as being on the same time level with "Archaic North Andean," while Chongoyape, Paracas, and the shell mounds of Ancon and Supe were equated with Classic Chavin.7 Origen y Desarrollo de Las Civilizaciones Prehistoricas Andinas and Dis- covery of the Chavin Culture in Peru show an important change in Tello's chronological thinking. Recuay and Aija are now shifted to a later position on the time chart, and Classic Chavin is given precedence as the earliest of north Peruvian cultures.8 This revision was probably the result of Tello's Nepeiia Valley excavations.9 There he found what he considered as Chavin, or Chavin- related, materials in the lowest archaeological levels. In referring to these dis- coveries, he states: These considerations . . . made equally essential the intensive exploration of the watersheds of the Cordillera Negra and the Callejon de Huaylas; for . . . the remains of Chavin culture must lie beneath strata corresponding to the cultures that had so far appeared there to be the predominant and oldest ones.10 Some lingering doubt may have remained about Recuay, for in his concluding summary to the 1943 article, although he drives home the uniqueness and chrono- logical primacy of the "Chavin civilization" with: 4 Tello, 1923, 1929. 5 Tello, 1923, pp. 204 ff. 5a Later Tello became dubious of the inclusion of three-color negative in "Archaic" but stuck to the concept of the plain tripod ware as belonging. 6 Tello, 1923, p. 259, fig. 58. 7 Tello, 1929, pp. 24-25; Tello, 1930. 8 Tello, 1940, see pl. 7. 9 Many of Dr Tello's writings were published in the Lima newspapers as, in effect, interim excavation reports. An examination of these might verify the above point. Unfortu- nately, these works are not at my disposal. 10 Tello, 1943, p. 139. Tello apparently substantiated this for he says farther along: "In the buildings discovered in the Callej6n de Huaylas . . . the real Chavin structures are hidden under Recuay structures . . ." (idem, p. 155). 104</page><page sequence="3">THE CHAVfN PROBLEM Remains of the Chavin civilizations are found everywhere buried under later remains as different in type as if they were completely unrelated, he adds the qualification: Yet certain facts given below lead to the presumption that a stage of transition once existed between the Chavin and the Recuay-Pasto civilizations. In some aspects they seem to prove that the latter is derived from the former, or that, having had different origins, they for some time were contemporaneous and intermingled.1l Tello's opinions on the origins and diffusions of Chavin go back to his first chronological-developmental chart,12 in which he indicated fundamental influ- ences coming into the Peruvian highlands from the Amazonian forest zone. Wira-Kocha, which is primarily a tracing out of the religious theme in Andean culture, using ethnographic and traditional sources as well as the archaeological iconography, leans heavily on the theme of ancient ties with and inspirations from the tropical forest peoples to the east. Specifically, Tello saw these influ- ences in the archaeology of the east Andean slopes and adjoining lowlands. Pottery of Kotosh, near Huanuco, he considered as related to both the Amazon lowlands and Chavin; styles of the Rio Ahuaimo (tributary to the Ucayali) and pottery from the Napo-Aguarico region had, in his words: . .intimate connection on the one side with Marajo pottery and on the other with Chavin pottery and with certain archaic forms of Recuay pottery.l3 Tello's extension of the geographical range of Chavin does not always carry with it an explicit statement as to the directions in which these Chavin influences moved. As far as the Amazon is concerned, it is likely that he thought of such a distant style as Marajo as springing from the same common source as Peruvian Chavin rather than as being the parent of it.14 Other remote cultures and styles in which he saw Chavin similarities, such as Uhle's "Mayoid" sites of Ecuador,15 Paracas, Pucara, and the Barreales of Argentina,16 were probably considered as peripheral to the Chavin center in the north Peruvian highlands. And with its extension in space, Tello also felt that Chavin influence had great time persistence. For example: 11 Idem, p. 158. The "facts given below" refer to some similarities of Recuay and Chavin vessel forms. 12 Tello, 1922, opp. p. 10. 13 Author's translation from Tello, 1940, pp. 635-636. 14 See Tello, 1940, pl. 7. 15 Tello, 1943, p. 158. 16 Idem, p. 159. 105</page><page sequence="4">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY The better developed cultures of the north have received in all times the influence of Chavin: the best examples of Chimu ceramics, including with this name the Tallanes (Late Chimu) and the Mochicas (Early Chimu), retain with all definitive- ness the distinctive characteristics of that art.17 From this it is not clear if Tello believed that the north coast was subject to a constant flow of Chavin influences ranging over several culture periods, or if he conceived of this influence as having been implanted in the north coast continuum at an early time so that the later periods there show Chavin influence only indirectly. It is likely that he visualized the former. Tello returned constantly to the metaphor of the tree, to a distinctly organic concept of cultures, as Strong18 has pointed out. One of his most important theoretical statements, the one which best sets forth this "organicism," is quoted in full: Two problems present themselves when we try to inquire about the age of cul- tures: the first refers to the age of each one individually; and the second, to the age in conjunction with a regional belt or zone. Each culture may be imagined to be a tree which in its development has passed through different stages and has put forth branches in tiers from the roots up to the top of the foliage. When one deals with the age of a culture one must take into account the age of the trunk or the stem as estimated by the branches put forth at the different stages of its development; and in so far as the age of a cultural whole is concerned one would have to inquire if the cultures have been coeval in their beginnings or roots, whether they appear at different periods or whether they are mixed and fused together, or over and under the branches of neighboring cultures. Up to the point investigation has reached in the Andean territory the cultures are multiple and probably very old in their majority. Although in many cases their remains appear superimposed, this does not necessarily mean a continuous or uninterrupted succession of cultural stems, but mere superpositions of branches derived from them which may or may not have been coeval in their origin. Young branches from old stems may be found super- imposed on branches from relatively young trunks in a chronological position con- trary to the true position and age of the mother cultures.l? From the standpoint of functional interpretations, Tello has not fully ex- pressed, at least in print, just what he intended by the terms "Chavin culture," or "Chavin civilization." In his last important work he seems to have regarded Chavln, at least as found in the Nepefia Valley of the coast, to be a civilization brought down from the Andes by a migration of people. The Nepefia discovery definitely cleared up the true character of the Chavin cul- ture on the coast. In the first place, it was now proved that this culture was rich in 17 Author's translation from Tello, 1923, pp. 256-257. 18 Strong, 1948, p. 93. 19 Translated from Tello, 1940, p. 626; translation checked by F.

The Chavin people developed on virgin soil in the Nepeiia Valley a civilization ...20 Tello's successor, Dra Rebecca Carri6n Cachot, has enlarged upon this, employ- ing the term "Chavin empire.21 This was, as she states, a religious and not a political empire. It was, however, a civilization homogeneous in its arts, rites, religion, race, and probably language. R. Larco Hoyle-In 1933 Larco Hoyle found Chavin-like polished black incised and relief decorated pottery in the Cupisnique quebrada of the Chicama Valley. Larco sees stylistic resemblances linking this Cupisnique pottery, the Chavin de Huantar stone carvings, and the mud reliefs of the Nepeina Valley temples. Unlike Tello, he believes that the genius of this art style was coastal, not highland or Amazonian. Larco conceives of early coastal populations as con- stituting the base upon which was propagated the idea of a religious cult char- acterized by the feline symbolism. The center of this cult he would place in the Nepeina Valley. In brief, Tello's highland center of Chavin de Huantar is Larco's later colony, settled by migrants from the coastal valley of Nepena.22 Larco approaches the distributions of Chavin, or Nepeina, more cautiously than Tello. He remarks on the similarities to Paracas23 and Chongoyape,24 but ranges no farther. Of the temple and stone carvings of Cerro Sechin, Casma Valley, he sees a developmental connection with Punkuri and Cerro Blanco of Nepeina; but he would place Cerro Sechin as the earliest of these developmental stages, apparently prior to the advent of the feline deity.25 As I interpret his writings, he holds for an early and relatively compressed time horizon for the diffusion and development of this feline cult. Early Mochica would be his upper- most chronological limit. Certain idea continuities, such as the Cupisnique feline deity changing to a Mochica anthropomorphized cat-god, are a peripheral part of his theories; but these are not conceived of as further manifestations of the same "culture" or "civilization" as in the Tello approach. Functionally, as stated, Larco interprets the Nepeina (or Chavin) style as the imprint of a religious movement which spread a complex art form among peoples of generally similar, but regionally varied, culture. 20 Tello, 1943, p. 139. 21 Carri6n Cachot, 1948, pp. 166 ff. This essay by Carrion contains a resume of Chavin distributions and an analysis of Chavin design. 22 See Larco Hoyle, 1938, pp. 19-50. 23 Idem, pp. 30-31. 24 Larco Hoyle, 1941, p. 11. 25 Larco Hoyle, 1938, p. 50. 107</page><page sequence="6">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY The North Americans-Most North American archaeologists in the Peruvian field have followed in the tradition of the German scholar, Max Uhle, particu- larly the Uhle scheme as it has been explained and enlarged by A. L. Kroeber.26 The Uhle-Kroeber methodology is that of cross-dating regional culture sequences of Peru with stylistic time-markers or "horizon styles." The goal is to build a time-space framework of cultures as synchronously perfect as possible. The Incaic and Tiahuanaco styles were employed as horizons, but neither Uhle nor Kroeber utilized Chavin in this manner.27 Similarly, Bennett28 was doubtful of the early position assigned to Coast Chavin or Cupisnique by both Larco Hoyle and Tello. Later, Bennett's own work at Chavin de Huantar,29 and Larco's pub- lication of grave stratigraphy from the north coast,30 brought him to a recon- sideration of the Chavin chronological problem. In a paper which Bennett pub- lished in 1943, he put forward Chavin as a pan-Peruvian horizon, marking the bottommost known level of Peruvian sequences.31 He saw the Chavin influences of this horizon ranging from Piura to Paracas on the coast and from Chavin de Huantar to Pucara in the highlands.32 Following this, the acceptance of the early chronological position of Chavin was general among the North Americans.33 Several archaeological monographs on Peru resulting from the Institute of Andean Research program of 1941-42 explicitly or implicitly express this important reformulation,34 and the papers of the symposium, A Reappraisal of Peruvian Archaeology,35 take it as almost axiomatic. Thus, in a sense, the Tello and Larco concept of Chavin-influenced cultures as early and basic to Peruvian civilization dominated the field by 1948. There are, however, significant differences. As far as can be determined by their writings, most North American students prefer a middle course on the 26 Uhle, 1910, 1913a; Kroeber, 1925, 1926a, b, c, 1930, 1944. An important exception is P. A. Means (1931). Means' approach is conceptually similar to Tello's in that he con- sidered much of Peruvian culture to have been derived from a highland parent whose irradia- tions were geographically widespread and chronologically of great depth. To Means this was not Chavin but Tiahuanaco. 27 See Kroeber, 1927. 28 Bennett, 1939. 29 Bennett, 1944. 30 Larco Hoyle, 1941, pp. 249-250. 31 The only North American to come out for a chronologically basic position of Chavin- type finds prior to this was Strong (1925) in his consideration of the Early Ancon pottery; but he did not, at that time, recognize the Chavin affiliations of this ware. 32 Bennett (1943, 1944), in a doubt somewhat reminiscent of Tello's earlier speculations, was still unsure of Chavin-Recuay time relationships. 33 Kroeber, 1944; Strong, 1943. 34 Strong and Corbett, 1943; Willey, 1943; Rowe, 1944. 35 Bennett, 1948. 108</page><page sequence="7">THE CHAVIN PROBLEM question of Chavin origins, maintaining a "wait and see" policy on the highland (Tello) versus coastal (Larco) theories.36 Nor have they expressed a definite opinion on the mechanism of the Chavin spread (migration, trade, diffusion, etc.). Notes of limiting criticism on the Chavin horizon have been sounded by Willey and Rowe,37 both authors being unconvinced of the value of a south coast or south highland extension of the horizon. In a similar vein, Collier denies Tello's extension of the Chavin style to ceramics in Ecuador.38 North American opinion on the functional significance of the widespread Chavin style manifestations is closer to that of Larco than to that of Tello. There is a hesitancy in calling it a "culture" or a "civilization." Willey and Bennett39 have both made the inferences that Peruvian society of the Chavin period was organized upon a limited local basis, that there was no widespread political unity, and that Chavin art was a part of the symbolic system of a reli- gious cult that diffused from region to region. CHAVIN AS AN HORIZON STYLE For this discussion Chavin style is defined as being identical to, or closely resembling, the designs of the stone carvings of Chavin de Huantar.40 A style, for purposes of analysis, may be broken down into three component aspects: technology, representation, and configuration. Technology refers to materials (stone, wood, etc.) and techniques (carving, incising, etc.). Representation is the subject matter or content of style. It may be inspired by the artist's observa- tions of nature (animals, men, etc.) or develop from his imagination (demons, composite beings, geometrical abstractions). Configuration is the manner in which the representations are expressed. Technological and representational fea- tures may be duplicated in many styles; but the configuration is the unique pattern that is not repeated outside the limits of a specific style. The technology of Chavin style at Chavin de Huantar is largely flat carving in stone, but the combination of this technique and this material is known in many other Peruvian styles. Representationally, felines, humans, birds, serpents, and fantastic com- posites of these characterize Chavin, yet all are depicted outside of Chavin. As 36 Bennett and Bird, 1949, pp. 137-139. 37 Willey, 1948, p. 10, table 1; Rowe, 1950. 38 Collier, 1948, pp. 82-83. 39 Willey, 1948; Bennett and Bird, 1949. 40 This is a much more limited definition than that given by Tello (1943, pp. 154-157) under the heading, "Characteristics of the Chavin Civilization." In that, Tello describes archi- tecture, ceramics, sculptural techniques, and the art motives or representations. These last two, techniques and representations, are comparable to the "technological" and "representational" aspects of style as I have used these concepts in this paper. 109</page><page sequence="8">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY Coiiete \ Fbrocas FIG. 1.

This is a matter of line, of compo- sition, of emphasis. It is the curvilinear forms, the massive heads, the intricately disposed small heads, the locked and curved fangs, the claw feet, the prominent nostrils, and the eccentric eyes. It is all of these and it is more; it is these elements and motives in their special system. Such is the essence of the Chavin style. It belongs to no other. The historical uniqueness of stylistic pattern is the fundamental assumption underlying the concept of the "horizon style."41 As the result of this uniqueness, the presence of any style in two or more places has a high synchronic value. Like any cultural form or pattern, the Chavin style is a part of a continuum. It probably has prototypes and certainly has descendants; yet these, though perhaps bearing technological and representational similarity to Chavin, are themselves distinct configurations. If we are interested in the Chavin style as a coefficient of time, it is its peculiar configurative aspect that we must concentrate upon. Its origins and continuities are legitimate and interesting inquiries, but they may be most effectively treated as separate problems. Thus, in this analysis of Chavin as an horizon style, I propose to consider only those manifestations which qualify from the configurational point of view. Each stylistic manifestation will be described briefly and placed in its immediate cultural context. We will then plot the geographical and chronological positions of these evidences of Chavin style to determine the case for Chavin as a syn- chronous horizon. Chavin de Huantar-This site is on a tributary of the Marafion River in the north highlands of Peru. As the type station for the Chavin style, it is our "typological standard" for comparison. The Chavin stylistic manifestations are human heads of stone carved in the round with tenons for wall insertion and flat incision-champleve carved lintels, cornice slabs, and monoliths. The style is primarily curvilinear, although con- taining some rectilinear elements. The feline design is almost universal in the flat carvings. Certain portions of the feline, such as eyes and teeth, are empha- sized. Sometimes the feline head is adorned with the bill and wings of a condor, a snake body, or fish tail and fins. Eyes are frequently portrayed with an eccen- tric pupil; the great fanged teeth are interlocked; the snout is broad (front view) or blunt (profile); from the head and back of the animal are scroll-like appendages or serpent heads; and the feet are heavy and claw-like.42 41 See Kroeber, 1944, pp. 108 ff; Willey, 1945. 42 See Tello, 1923, pp. 256-320; Kroeber, 1944, pp. 82-90; Bennett, 1944, pp. 88-89. Ill</page><page sequence="10">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY The site itself is obviously a great ceremonial center. Stone-faced buildings of a platform mound type are arranged around a rectangular sunken court. The platform mounds have interior galleries, and rooms are on two or three levels connected by ramps or stairways. The facings of the walls, made of dressed stone blocks, alternate bands of thick and thin stones.43 The ceramics associated with these sculptures and buildings are monochromes of black, red, or brown and include open flat-bottomed bowls, pucos, sub-globular bowls, globular bowls with flared rims, constricted collar jars, and simple spout jars. The stirrup-spout form is also represented.44 Decorative techniques are fine and broad-line incision, dentate or rocker-stamping, punctation or gouging, color zoning, strip applique, fingernail impressions, and low relief modelling. Designs are circles-and-dots, triangles, diamonds, rectangles, criss-crosses, loops, volutes, and segments of stylized life forms unrecognizable in sherd fragments.45 Sty- listically verifiable Chavin designs also obtain, but, apparently, are rather rare. Tello46 illustrates a bottle with a flowing line feline head, highly stylized; Ben- nett,47 a more realistic anthropomorphic feline face sherd with characteristic interlocked fangs; and Carri6n,48 stylized feline heads. Artifacts other than ceramics are not reported except for a few pieces of carved bone inlaid with turquoise and shell.49 There remain the remarkable Brummer or Bliss-Simkhovitch collections of gold artifacts.50 These objects were at one time in the possession of a private collector in Trujillo, Peru, and were purported to have come from the site of Chavin de Huantar. Among the specimens are gorgets, ear discs, nose pendants, tweezers, spoons, and beads. They are decorated with embossed, incised, and champleve designs, many of which are fully in the style of the stone carvings of Chavin de Huantar.51 Metallurgical techniques are similar to those of the Chongoyape gold pieces. As no other comparable gold of which there is record has ever been discovered at Chavin de Huantar, the associations of this material with the site are open to serious doubt. The only other collection which resembles 43 Bennett, 1943, 1944; Carri6n, 1948, pp. 100-106. 44 See Carri6n, 1948, pl. 14. 45 Bennett, 1944, pp. 81-87. 46 Tello, 1943, plate 18, a. 47 Bennett, 1944, fig. 30P. 48 Carrion, 1948, pl. 14. 49 Carrion, 1948, pp. 101-102.

There is no doubt as to the Chavin style affiliation and the col- lection is an important addition to our artistic and technological knowledge of the period; but it cannot, in view of inadequate field data, be fully incorporated as a part of the Chavin de Huantar site. Yauya-This site, in the Maraiion drainage north of Chavin de Huantar, is represented solely by a carved stela or column,52 no longer in situ. It is a standing figure of a monster, perhaps a fish or a fish with feline attributes. Kroeber compares it to the Raimondi stela of Chavin de Huantar, ". . . in shape of total outline, complete filling of the field, erect posture, complete bilateral symmetry, and a certain formal stiffness .. ..53 As is well known, the Rai- mondi stela stands somewhat apart from other Chavin carvings in style, but is, nevertheless, linked to them. This solitary find seems to me to be justifiably incorporated within the Chavin style. Pacopampa-From Pacopampa, in the northwest highlands, comes a series of carved stone mortars and pestles.54 All of these are four-legged animals with the bowl or mortar basin in the back. Two have characteristic Chavin feline faces, and two of the pestles are similarly carved; the other mortar is a felinized owl with owl's beak but jaguar teeth. The stylistic relationship to the Chavin de Huantar carvings is close or identical. There is also a carved stone slab, "the feline of Pacopampa,"54a which has some resemblances to Chavin standing, front-view anthropomorphized figures. Hualgayoc-Tello55 has referred to "megalithic mausoleums" at Yanacancha in the Province of Hualgayoc. Previously he had described these as stone boxes cut in bedrock with slab covers.55a Apparently there is also a carved stone column or monolith at Yanacancha56 which represents an anthropomorphic figure, but the style is not Chavin. There is, however, a drawing of a small stone vessel from "Lives Farm, San Gregorio district, Province of Hualgayoc"57 which is carved in the Chavin art style. Two serpent head appendages, identical with those on the carvings at Chavin de Huantar, are a part of the design motif. 52 Tello, 1923. 53 Kroeber, 1944, p. 87. 54 Larco Hoyle, 1946, pl. 65; Carrion, 1948, pl. 11. 54a Larco Hoyle, 1945, p. 3. 55 Tello, 1943. 55a Tello, 1937-38. 56 See illustration, Tello, 1937-38; Carri6n, 1948, pl. 26. 57 Tello, 1943, pi. 18. 113</page><page sequence="12">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY Kuntur Wasi-This ruin is situated on a hilltop in the upper Jequetepeque drainage, just over the divide from the Marani6n system.58 It is a triple-terraced pyramid which was surmounted by temple rooms or buildings, now destroyed. Pyramid facings are of irregular stones. Stone statues, heads, carved slabs, and lintels were found on the temple platforms or on the hill slope below. As Carrion has indicated, these carvings bear varying degrees of similarity to the sculptures of Chavin de Huantar. A flat carving59 is a front view of a felinized condor(?) with tusk-like teeth, wide-spaced nostrils and eyes, and three pendant serpent heads. A head, sculptured in the round in the manner of some of the tenon heads from Chavin de Huantar, has the furrowed face and forehead, the curved fangs, and other typical Chavin details.60 Both of these pieces strike one as dead-center on the Chavin style. The other carvings display significant differences. They are columnar statues or stone pillars carved in low relief fashion, as is the mode for Pucara, Aija, Tiahuanaco, or San Agustin of Colombia. Stylistically, they have more of a generalized resemblance to these than they do to Chavin. One such col- umn has a representation on both sides.61 The obverse carving has a head and face reminiscent of Chavin in its furrows and scrolled head treatment, and the claw-like feet of the anthropomorphized monster are also rendered in a Chavin manner. But the small head held in the monster's two hands, over his chest, is not a Chavin style feature. The reverse side of the column is a humanized serpent with nostrils and a mouth only vaguely Chavin. Another statue, a monkey(?) with prominent ribs, has only the jaguar fangs in common with Chavin.62 Pottery was found on the slopes below the temple, probably as a result of refuse, although graves were also discovered in the same area. Apparently, both the grave pottery and the surface fragments comprise the same series of types. The ware quality is not described, but as Carrion defines it as "classic Chavin" there is reason to believe that it is monochrome of red or of dark colors. In nearby sites, this "classic Chavin" pottery of Kuntur Wasi is said to underlie "sub-Chavin" types which are described as cream-colored with brown decora- tion.63 Kuntur Wasi pottery includes: open flat-bottomed bowls, sub-globular bowls, constricted collar jars, globular bowls with angular or flared collars, simple spouted jars, and stirrup-mouthed jars with heavy everted lips. Aside from these forms, there are low pedestal bases and kero-shaped cups.

From the illustrations offered, Chavin style feline, owl, condor, or serpent motives are missing. A possible ex- ception is an incised(?) design on a stirrup-mouthed jar.64 The modelled natu- ralistic life forms are abundant, but they are stylistically apart from Chavin. In addition to pottery, Kuntur Wasi graves contained turquoise and bone beads and hammered gold ornaments with simple repousse decorations.65 Moropon-This is a single pottery vessel from the Piura Valley of the far north coast.66 It is a tall, stirrup-mouthed jar with the characteristic Cupisnique or Chavin thick, everted lip. It is decorated with a broad and fine-line (engrav- ing?) incision, dentate rocker-stamping, relief modelling, and color zoning. The modelling may represent a plant or fruit. Around the base is a repetitive styliza- tion of a Chavin life form. Chongoyape-The Chongoyape finds consist of two lots of material from the vicinity of that small town in Lambayeque Valley. Both were discovered as the result of non-archaeological digging. The best documented lot came from deep burials and it includes gold ornaments with Chavin feline heads, pottery, a stone bowl, ring, and spoon, a jet mirror, and cinnabar pigments.67 The Chongoyape ceramics are monochrome black or red polished wares, of plate and stirrup-mouth forms, and are decorated with dentate or rocker-stamped tech- niques, and low relief and full round modelling. One vessel has a modelled animal at the juncture of stirrup-spout and body. The thick, Cupisnique-type lip eversion is seen on both of the stirrup-mouth specimens.68 The other collec- tion of Chongoyape Chavin-like finds consists entirely of gold specimens. These are three cylindrical crowns, a head band, tweezers, and ear spools. The crowns and some of the ear spools have embossed or repousse decorations of indubitable Chavin style. One crown69 has a cat or humanoid head in profile with large, crossed fangs, eccentric pupil eye, and attached serpents. Another crown70 bears an anthropomorphic jaguar standing in front view, holding staffs or spears. On the chest of this being is another stylized jaguar face. 64 Idem, pl. 22, no. 21. 65 Idem, p. 156. 66 See Larco Hoyle, 1941, fig. 209, for an illustration of this piece. 67 Lothrop, 1941, pp. 258-259. 68 Idem, pl. 19. 69 Idem, pl. 16, a. 70 Idem, pl. 16, c. 115</page><page sequence="14">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY The metallurgical techniques of the Chongoyape objects include not only hammering and repousse work but annealing and soldering or welding. A gold- headed pin had a silver shaft.71 Chiclayo-I am not certain to what finds or sites this designation refers. Possibly it is the Pickman Strombus shell from the air base at Chiclayo.72 This shell bears an incised design of a man in a dancing or running position. The figure is blowing on a strombus shell trumpet. The outline of the man is bordered by an interlaced Chavin serpent design. The serpent head, with eccentric eye pupil, terminates the bordering design at the feet of the dancer. The man figure, itself, is not particularly in the Chavin style. Except, possibly, the feet, there are no feline or monstrous attributes. The face, seen in profile, is quite similar to the Sechin human figures.73 The eye has a curved band extending down onto the cheek which is suggestive of, although it does not duplicate, Sechin portrayals. A flowing headdress, extending down over the back of the individual, is also like a similar headdress and sash from a Sechin carving. This specimen, more than any other, offers some sort of a stylistic link between Chavin and Cerro Sechin. Kroeber74 has commented upon the Pickman Strombus and has also called attention to a small stone vase from the Chiclayo region75 which offers a similar linkage. The Sechin features of this vase are a carved figure of a man in profile with a semi-circular, eccentric eye and three lines curving downward across the side of the face. Unlike the Sechin men, this individual has a jaguar fang. Cupisnique-This culture, found at several sites and centering in the Chicama Valley, is best known for its pottery of Chavin affiliations. Cupisnique pottery is essentially monochrome, often polished, and includes simple forms such as the open, flat-bottomed bowl, sub-globular bowls, constricted collar jars, beakers, and simple spouted jars. The stirrup-spout vase is also common. Decoration is by broad and fine-line incision, engraving, rocker-stamping, punctation, hachure, brushing, color zoning, pellet applique, low relief modelling, and full round modelling. In general, modelling is more frequent and better executed than in the other culture groups we have reviewed. Larco states that there is evidence of the use of the mold in ceramic manufacture. Design includes circles-and-dots, rectilinear elements of various shapes, loops, volutes, scrolls, leaf or star-shaped figures, a number of modelled naturalistic life forms (animals, humans, houses, 71 Idem, pp. 257-260. 72 Illustrated by Tello, 1937, and Larco Hoyle, 1941, fig. 174. 73 See Tello, 1943, fig. 18. 74 Kroeber, 1944, pp. 49-50. 75 Idem, pi. 33. 116</page><page sequence="15">THE CHAVIN PROBLEM plants), and the stylized life forms of the Chavin style (feline, owl, condor, ser- pent, and combinations). Carved and ground stone beads, amulets, rings, ear ornaments, receptacles, and small mortars may, upon occasion, bear Chavin designs. Similarly, carved bone objects may be so decorated. The association of metals is somewhat dubious, but, if they can be related to Cupisnique, they are simple ornaments of cut and beaten gold. Textiles are of cotton or wool in plain weave. Houses were small and single-roomed both above-ground and subterranean. The walls were made of stone or conical adobes. Larco Hoye states that ". .. solid circular and pyramidal constructions were initiated in this cultural period."76 These were made of conical adobes. Mochica-The Mochica culture is represented by numerous sites in Chicama, Moche, and adjacent north coast valleys. A small number of Mochica stirrup- mouthed jars bear stylistically authentic Chavin designs.77 These are bold but intricate curvilinear band designs of the sort called "ribbon relief" by Larco Hoyle. In some of them the feline representation has been completely reduced; in others the eye and curved fang elements are deducible. Most of these vessels are decorated with a combination of low relief incision and red and white paint- ing. Vessel shape, including the proportionately high body and the delicate stirrup without the lip eversion, is characteristic of other Mochica ceramics. The cultural context in which these finds are made is well known, as Mochica is an outstanding culture of the Peruvian Classic stage.78 It features modelled and mold-made red and white ceramics. Realistic plastic and painted decoration is typical, with stirrup-spout jar and "florero" as the dominant vessel forms. A highly developed metallurgy, a lack of emphasis in stone carving, and mam- moth pyramids of rectangular mold-made adobes are distinctive traits. Cerro Blanco-Cerro Blanco, in the coastal Nepeina Valley, is a temple struc- ture, presumably of the general platform type.79 Carrion80 describes it as having the form of a gigantic bird in flight. According to Tello,8s the original building had been made of stone, and then the walls were covered with mud reliefs which were painted in multi-colors. These painted reliefs82 are in the form of Chavin- 76 Larco Hoyle, 1946, p. 151. 77 Kroeber, 1926a, pp. 38-39; Larco Hoyle, 1941, fig. 31, for examples. 78 See Larco Hoyle, 1946, pp. 161-175; Bennett and Bird, 1949, pp. 153-181. 79 Bennett, 1939, p. 16. 80 Carri6n, 1948, p. 107. 81 Tello, 1940, pp. 702-704; 1943, pp. 136-137. 82 Tello, 1943, pl. 13. 117</page><page sequence="16">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY type eye and cross-fanged teeth elements. In the fill of this original building were black potsherds which are described as "Classic Chavin." The illustration83 shows black polished and incised pieces similar to Chavin and Cupisnique ware, although the range of decoration types is rather limited and none bear Chavin feline or other zo6morphic stylizations. A second construction level at Cerro Blanco, built over the original unit, is characterized by conical adobes and smoothed plastered and painted walls. No ceramics were associated. The third level or uppermost covering of the site dates from late coastal periods. Punkuri-This temple, in Nepefia, is described as having a lower level con- structed of stone and decorated with mud reliefs and paint.84 Its base was a platform of two terrace levels which are ascended by a wide stairway.85 Midway in the stair was a painted feline head and paws made of stone and mud. At the feet of this feline figure was a burial accompanied by a carved stone mortar, a "handkerchief embroidered with turquoise sequins,"86 and a strombus shell. There is no mention of pottery. The second building level walls were of conical adobes and bore incised designs on a plastered surface. A much later structure of rectangular adobes87 and refuse overlay the whole. The Punkuri jaguar head88 is more realistically portrayed than is characteris- tic of Chavin felines, although this might be the result of the clay medium and the full-round rendering as opposed to the more usual flat carving. The stone mortar from the grave89 has a rectilinear decoration that is not conclusively Chavin. Perhaps the best evidence for the Chavin art style is in the incised wall decorations on the conical adobe structure. Larco Hoyle90 illustrates a section of these, although the designs are not distinct in the reproduction. However, he accompanies his wall illustration with another of a stirrup-mouthed jar (presum- ably Cupisnique of Chicama)91 which, according to him, bears an incised decora- tion "similar to those found on the Temple of Punkuri." The designs on the vessel are definitely in the Chavin style. Moxeke-In Casma Valley is Moxeke, a rectangular, terraced pyramid with rounded corers and higher platforms at the back of the summit. The structure is stone-faced, and it is known that the front upper platforms are made of conical 83 Idem, pl. 14, a. 84 Larco Hoyle, 1938, figs. 18, 19; Tello, 1943, pp. 137-138. 85 Carri6n, 1948, p. 110. 86 Tello, 1943. 87 See Larco Hoyle, 1941, fig. 25. 88 Carri6n, 1948, pl. 5. 89 Tello, 1943, fig. 17, a. 90 Larco Hoyle, 1941, fig. 26. 91 Idem, fig. 27. 118</page><page sequence="17">THE CHAVIN PROBLEM adobes. The center faSade is broken by a stairway. On each side of the stairway, six niches are set into the face of the third terrace. These niches contain par- tially destroyed adobe sculptures of a feline, a serpent, and a human torso. The sculptures had been painted in various colors, and the terrace walls between the niches were deeply incised with curvilinear designs painted white.92 No pottery is illustrated or described from Moxeke, but the mud and adobe reliefs in the terrace niches have a strong Chavin cast. Pallca-Pallca, in Casma,93 is another terraced and stone-faced pyramid with stone stairways. No conical adobes have been found, but on the summit platform are two small stepped pyramids of rectangular adobes. Collier believes these two upper pyramids to be later than the rest of the structure and to equate with late period Casma pottery found on the surface. Pottery found in excava- tions at the base of the main platform is polished, dark, monochrome ware. Some sherds were decorated with incision, punctation, rocker-stamping, and strip applique. Simple designs are noted,94 and there are also stylized life forms, al- though none of these, as illustrated, are large enough to determine the complete nature of the representation. Their general appearance is, however, certainly that of Chavin ware; and a carved bone spatula95 bears a thoroughly Chavin type felinized serpent head. Humaya-Hacienda Humaya is in the Huaura Valley. All that I know concerning the site is that it produced a carved bone spoon or spatula and "Early Ancon Incised" pottery.96 The spatula bears an anthropomorphized feline face in profile. The mouth and fang treatment is Chavin style. The eye has a series of four lines curving down across the face in the manner of Cerro Sechin. The pottery is not illustrated or described. Puerto de Supe-There are five sites in the small desert hills on the coast near Puerto de Supe which concern us here. Uhle, Kroeber, Strong and Willey, and Willey and Corbett have described excavations and collections from these sites.97 In this summation I draw principally upon the last and most detailed reference. Near the beach, below the lighthouse (hence "Lighthouse Site") there is a 92 Based upon unpublished information furnished me by Donald Collier, December, 1950; also Tello, 1943, pl. 13, b; Kroeber, 1944, p. 47; Carri6n, 1948, p. 110, pl. 6. 93 After Collier, unpublished information. 94 Tello, 1943, pl. 15. 95 Idem, pl. 24, a. 96 Lothrop, 1951, fig. 74, d; p. 233. 97 Uhle, 1925, pp. 260-263; Kroeber, 1925, pp. 254-256; 1944, pp. 118-120; Strong and Willey, 1943, pp. 11-14; Willey and Corbett, n.d. 119</page><page sequence="18">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY shell and refuse midden and, a short distance away, a cemetery. Inland, facing onto the valley from dry quebradas, are two middens, Aspero and Li-31. A cemetery area is near the Aspero midden and has been named the Aspero ceme- tery. All of these sites, except the Aspero midden, contain black or dark polished pottery with various kinds of incised, punctated, rocker-stamped, color-zoning, and related treatments. This ware occurs in simple forms and also in the stirrup- mouthed jar. Complete Chavin feline stylizations were not detected upon sherds, but several fragments suggested portions of such designs. There is little doubt that this Puerto de Supe ware-"Early Supe," as it has been called-is Coastal Chavin pottery. There is a miscellany of small bone and wooden objects from the Supe sites, but outstanding is a little bone palette with an incised feline-crab design of Chavln style.98 A carved gourd from the Lighthouse cemetery is, likewise, in the Chavin style. Twined and some twilled basketry came from Supe graves, as did mats and netting. Decorated and colored plain-weave cotton textiles were abundant at Supe, including a fine, tapestry-woven piece with Chavin condor- feline designs. Two small sheets of beaten gold also were obtained in the Supe cemeteries. The Supe people practiced simple inhumation burial and were a short- statured group with antero-posterior flattened skulls. Dwellings were small houses with stone foundations. No pyramids or public structures could be identified with these Supe sites. Anc6n-This shell midden area and cemetery are on a range of hills over- looking the later Ancon Necropolis of the central coast. Uhle99 excavated here; Strong100 defined the pottery from the midden as "Early Anc6n"; and Willey made still other midden excavations.10l More recently, Carrion102 discovered a cemetery culturally related to the midden and located a short distance from it. Early Ancon pottery is very much like that of Early Supe. It is monochrome, red or black. Vessel forms are simple bowls, jars, and bottles, although occa- sional stirrup-spouts occur. Decoration is largely by incision and related plastic techniques. Stylized life form designs probably include Chavin felines, birds, and serpents, although these are difficult to determine from sherd fragments. There is a small amount of naturalistic modelling.l03 98 Kroeber, 1944, fig. 5, A. 99 Uhle, 1913b. 100 Strong, 1925, pp. 152-156. 101 Strong and Willey, 1943, pp. 15-17; Willey and Corbett, n.d. 102 Carri6n, 1948. 103 See Uhle, 1913b, pl. 1, fig. 3; Strong, 1925, pl. 48, figs. 5, 7; Carrion, 1948, pl. 25. 120</page><page sequence="19">THE CHAVfN PROBLEM Only a few ground stone artifacts (jet mirrors, pendants, a mace-head) were recovered from the Ancon midden, but mortars, pestles, and tripod plates came from the cemetery. Both woodcarving and bonecarving were well-developed crafts. A particularly fine bone spatula is carved in the style of a Chavin feline- serpent.104 Basketry and cotton textiles came from the Ancon cemetery and mid- den, and spinning and weaving are further attested to by pottery spindle whorls. Carrion 105 illustrates a flat pottery stamp from the cemetery. Burials were simple inhumations. Dwellings were probably like those of Early Supe. There are no evidences for pyramids or public buildings. In the above we have described the art style of Chavin as it is manifested in seventeen sites or regions of Peru. Undoubtedly, there are other examples of Chavin art in the central Andes. Claims for some of these have been reported, and we will discuss them farther on; but it is with these adequately documented occurrences that the case for the Chavin horizon style must be made at the present time. The geographical distribution of these finds is in north and central Peru. On the coast, it is from Lambayeque, or possibly Piura, to Ancon. In the highlands, the extension is even shorter, reaching from Pacopampa to Chavin de Huantar. The chronological position of the Chavin finds is derived from superposition or stratigraphy at Chavin de Huantar, from sites in the Chicama Valley, and at Ancon and Supe. At Chavin de Huantar Bennettl06 found graves of the White-on-red horizon intrusive into Chavin period refuse. In the Chicama sector Larco Hoylel07 has produced grave superimposition showing Cupisnique to underlie Salinar (a north coast White-on-red period). On the central coast, at both Ancon and Puerto de Supe, midden excavations by Willey and Cor- bett108 show White-on-red ceramic types appearing only in the upper levels of deep refuse deposits pertaining to the Early Ancon-Supe period. These data would indicate a uniform pre-White-on-red horizon position for Chavin style finds of both sierra and coast in north and central Peru. Superpositional data from Punkuri, Cerro Blanco, and Moxeke are not so specific as these, but from all three locations the Chavin style materials seem to be at the very bottom of local culture sequences. The weight of the evidence thus argues for the placement of the Chavin style horizon at the beginning of Peruvian Formative cultures, 104 Carri6n, 1948, pl. 24, k. 105 Idem, pl. 24, t. 106 Bennett, 1944, p. 92. 107 Larco Hoyle, 1941, pp. 249 ff. 108 Willey and Corbett, n.d. 121</page><page sequence="20">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY a chronological conclusion generally agreed upon.l09 There is, however, at least one discrepant note to this conclusion-the Chavin-designed Mochica ceramics. These specimens come from bona fide Mochica grave contexts and are a part of Mochica culture; yet their decorations are clearly in the configuration of the Chavin style. The Mochica culture is not only later than Cupisnique, but the two are separated by the Salinar (White-on-red) period. In analyzing the cultural context of the Chavin horizon style, similarities are most readily apparent in ceramics. These are best seen in comparisons among Cupisnique, Chavin de Huantar, Supe, and Ancon. These four sites or regions offer the most ample data on pottery of the Chavin horizon. In all of them the ware is dark red, brown, or black, and it is essentially monochrome. Polishing is a common feature, although not all the pottery of each site or region is pol- ished. Open flat-bottomed bowls, constricted-collar jars, sub-globular bowls, simple-spout jars or bottles, and stirrup-spouts are linked traits. All seem to be common in all locations except the stirrup-spout which is typical of Cupisnique but rare elsewhere. Commonly held decorative techniques are fine- and broad-line incision, dentate or rocker-stamping, gouging or punctation, and the zoning of color bands (usually red) with incised lines. In addition, hachure and cross- hachure, brushing, engraving, strip applique, and low relief applique modelling are present in two or three of the four sites or regions. Designs continue this similarity. The circle or circle-and-dot, rectilinear elements (triangles, diamonds, rectangles, zigzags, etc.), loops, volutes, and scrolls are found throughout. A more distinctive linkage is in the Chavin feline design itself. This is usual in Cupisnique pottery; infrequent but present in the Chavin de Huantar collections; and very probably represented in the sherd samples from Ancon and Supe. In general, the Chavin de Huantar, Ancon, and Supe pottery complexes are alike. Cupisnique possesses most of the ceramic traits held by the other three, but places greater stress on naturalistic and full-round modelling, the stirrup-spout jar, and the stylized Chavin designs. In addition, some Cupisnique pottery is apparently mold-made. Other Chavin horizon sites with pottery fit into the ceramic pattern as de- scribed above. The Moropon stirrup-mouthed jar is entirely within the Cupis- nique typological range. The black or red monochrome vessels of Chongoyape have polished surface areas, stirrup-jar forms, dentate or rocker-stamping, and relief and full-round modelling. Pallca pottery is dark, monochrome, and deco- rated with incisions, rocker-stamping, and applique. Vessel designs are confined 109 See Bennett and Bird, 1949, fig. 19. 122</page><page sequence="21">THE CHAVfN PROBLEM to rectilinear or morphologically unrecognizable curvilinear patterns, although it is likely that some of the latter are sections of Chavin stylized felines. Kuntur Wasi presents a somewhat divergent picture. Apparently, the Kuntur Wasi ceramics are monochromes and of a dark hue, although this has not been explicitly stated. The simple bowl and jar forms of Early Ancon, Early Supe, Cupisnique, and Chavin de Huantar are present, as is the stirrup-spout; but there are new additions in the low pedestal-based bowl and jar and the kero- beaker. Kuntur Wasi incised decoration is quite limited in design elements and arrangements."? These are almost wholly rectilinear, except for very simple loops or volutes and the circle-and-dot. Recognizable feline motives on the flat surface are not included in the illustrations of the pottery, although there are one or two possible exceptions of what might be extreme stylizations of the Chavin feline. One of thesell has the ribbon-banded, compact glyphic quality of the Chavin designs on Mochica vases. As opposed to flat design, modelled and applique decoration is varied. Some elements, like pressed pellet nodes, resemble Chavin wares, but, in general, the applique work is heavy and clumsy.1l2 Whereas Chavin applique and relief modelling, as best exemplified in Cupisnique, has a quality of deeply sculptured surfaces, the Kuntur Wasi pieces emphasize the distinctly applied nature of the thick rolled fillets of clay. This latter treat- ment resembles Salinar, where the heads of felines or other animals are done with heavy applique strips.ll3 Mochica ceramics need not be discussed in detail. It is, with rare exceptions, oxidized pottery; much of it is mold-made; and the realistic painting and modelling is distinctly un-Chavin. Within this context the Chavin decorated pieces are rare. In other aspects of cultural development we see a number of variables within the Chavin horizon. Monumental stone carving is confined to the north highlands at Chavin de Huantar, Yauya, and Kuntur Wasi. Mud sculptures and reliefs characterize the Nepefia and Casma Valleys. Small, artifactual carving in stone, bone, wood, or shell appears to be largely a coastal trait, distributed from Chiclayo to Ancon. Basketry and weaving are coastal. Pyramid building is northern. Highland structures are of stone with interior galleries while those of the coast are adobe. The pyramid idea seems not to have reached Supe and Ancon on the central coast. Throughout the sites or regions of the Chavin hori- 110 Carrion, 1948, pl. 23. 111 Idem, pl. 22, no. 21. 112 Idem, pl. 23, nos. 20, 21, 24, 25. 113 See Larco Hoyle, 1946, pl. 67, g. 123</page><page sequence="22">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY zon burial is in simple pit graves with the exception of the adobe-lined tombs of Mochica. True metallurgy is known for certain only from Chongoyape,114 with its welding or soldering techniques and limited use of silver in addition to gold, and from Mochica, with its alloys, copper, and multiple uses of these materials. Elsewhere, metal, if found, is in the form of simple beaten sheets or ornaments of gold. Some of these variables may be explained environmentally or geographically. Stone monuments and structures of the north highlands are undoubtedly related to available building materials. The basketry and weaving of the coast can, perhaps, be correlated with preservation factors in archaeological sites. Pyramid building in the north and its absence farther south certainly suggests the origin or introduction of the trait in north Peru with a gradual spread to the south. The same may be true of Chongoyape gold. On the other hand, environment and geography cannot explain the numerous striking differences that set Mochica apart from the other cultures which share the Chavin art style. This can only be explained chronologically. In other words, the cultural context of Mochica fully supports the stratigraphy which places it as post-Cupisnique and later than the horizon level on which most of the other Chavin style manifestations fall. We can, following this argument, conclude that the Chavin style is, for the most part, an effective time horizon marker. This is deduced from the strati- graphic evidence which is supported by a similarity of cultural context for most of the sites or regions in which Chavin style art is found. This similarity is strongest in ceramics and burial practices while notable variability is seen in archi- tecture and metallurgy. Two cultures with Chavin style manifestations diverge rather sharply from this similarity of cultural context: Mochica and Kuntur Wasi. Kuntur Wasi is the less divergent of the two, but its ceramics show sig- nificant differences from Chavin and resemble Salinar, a cultural period of the north coast, which is post-Chavin. It is also noteworthy that monumental stone carving at Kuntur Wasi is not restricted to the Chavin style, but is extended to another and quite different style. It seems certain that the Chavin style, of a configurationally pure sort, did, in a few cases, persist later than the chronological horizon line which we can draw for most Chavin-linked cultures and periods. This persistence is seen on the north coast where it lasted until Mochica times as a minor decorative feature. At Kuntur Wasi, in the north highlands, we have evidence of another such per- 114 The possible exception to this is the Bliss-Simkhovitch collection, which may have come from Chavin de Huantar. 124</page><page sequence="23">THE CHAVfN PROBLEM sistence of the Chavin stylistic strain. It may be that Kuntur Wasi, or comparable sites located on the headwaters of the major north coast rivers, were the foci which transmitted the last impulses of a dying Chavin style down to the coast into Mochica. This does not, of course, explain the absence of Chavin designs in coastal Salinar"l5 which I tentatively place as contemporaneous with Kuntur Wasi. It does, however offer a specific culture and region which could have carried the Chavin style across the time gap between the Chavin horizon proper and Mochica. ADDITIONAL SITES RELATED TO THE CHAVIN PROBLEM The seventeen sites or regions which we have treated as showing indisputable Chavin stylistic affiliation by no means complete the list of sites or cultures for which Chavin relationship has been claimed. Most of these claims have been made by Tello or Carrion116 although one or two come from other authors. These claims or sites may be divided into three categories. First, there are those put forward with the direct statement that they are stylistically Chavin, but for which little or no evidence is presented. Such claims could be perfectly valid, and may eventually be substantiated; however, for the present study I have depended upon published illustrations, and in the interests of a strict interpre- tation have decided to err on the side of conservative hesitancy rather than uncritical acceptance. Second, there are sites which display a cultural context or inventory similar to the majority of the Chavin horizon style sites, but which seem to lack any evidence of the diagnostic style. And, third, there are sites whose stylistic relationship to Chavin is debatable. We will review the claims and sites in this order. SITES OF THE FIRST CATEGORY The Highlands-In the Marai6on drainage, Tello and Carrion117 mention several sites for which there is little or no identification.118 Kumbemayo, which is one of these, refers to an aqueduct system cut into bedrock, some in situ carvings, and petroglyphs. From published photographs119 of these features I recognize no Chavin stylistic affinity. 115 This absence is complete for ceramics, but there are some carved bone spatulas from Salinar graves which retain the Chavin style (Larco Hoyle, 1946, pl. 68, top). 116 Tello, 1940, 1943; Carri6n, 1948. 117 Tello, ibid.; Carri6n, ibid. 118 Chakas, Huambos, Cochabamba in Chachapoyas, Chokta in Celendin, Nunamarka in Pataz, Pasa Kancha, Yayno, Llammellin, Chalwa, Yaco, San Marcos, Wama Wain, and Gotush are all listed by Tello and Carri6n as Chavin sites. 119 Reichlen, 1949. 125</page><page sequence="24">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY In the Callejon de Huaylas, Tellol20 includes Inka Wain and Pomakayan as Chavin sites. The latter is a terraced, truncated pyramid with interior stone-lined galleries in which Classic Chavin ceramics are reported to have been found. The structure, is, however, very similar to those of the Wilkawain-Tiahuanaco period12 In the central highlands there are also a number of Chavin claims which have not yet been substantiated by the publication of the evidence.122 The Coast-On the north coast there are several Chavin claims which remain unsubstantiated. From La Ventana or Batan Grande, in Lambayeque, Tello reports Chavin sherds in a stratigraphy but does not illustrate these materials.123 Larco124 illustrates stirrup-mouthed vessels from the Pacasmayo Valley which are incised and modelled in the general Cupisnique manner but do not have Chavin- type feline designs. Tello125 also notes the presence of Chavin sites in Santa Valley and illustrates a stone mortar with a carved bird design from Suchiman,126 but the Chavin style of this piece is not a conclusive identification. In addition to the better known sites of Nepenia and Casma Valleys, Tello127 names Kusipampa, Pinchamarka, and La Carbonera from the former and La Cantina, Chankillo, and Sechin Alto from the latter. There is little information on any of these, but Kroeber128 has reviewed Chankillo (Chancaillo) without finding Chavin evidence. Middendorf'sl29 allusion to Chavin relationships may have influenced Tello here. Donald Collier has given me the following informa- tion on Sechin Alto. It is a large rectangular, stone-faced, stepped, pyramidal platform surmounted by several smaller two-level platforms. The interior struc- ture is of conical adobes, and the pyramid is partially enclosed by a compound wall. Additional platform structures are within and outside of this compound.

Chimo Kapak (Chimu Capac) is known from the literature 35 as a mixed site, but no Chavin connections have been previously indicated. SITES OF THE SECOND CATEGORY Las Torrecitas, Chondorko, Santa-Apolonia-Recent stratigraphic excavations by the Reichlens136 in these sites near Cajamarca have revealed a period of incised pottery underlying a developmental sequence of Cajamarca (Cursive) types. The chronological position of this incised pottery period approximates that of Chavin- influenced periods elsewhere in Peru.137 Torrecitas-Chavin, as they have named the incised style, is a black, grey, or brown ware, smoothed or polished, which occurs in flat-based or hemispherical bowls or cups, sub-globular vases, deep pots, and large jars with sub-globular bodies and constricted and reflared collars. Decoration is by both broad and fine-line incision, punctations, gouge-marks, smooth and roughened zones, and zoned red or white color. Designs are volutes, scrolls, triangles, chevrons, parallel lines, and other simple motives. Modelling in high or low relief, and the more complex vessel forms, such as the stirrup-spout, are absent. Nor are there any designs which could be interpreted as Chavin style felines, humans, or other beings.138 In short, although the pottery is technically very similar to the ware of Chavin de Huantar, the art style of Chavin is lacking. The Reichlens have considered the possible chronological implications of this simplicity of their Torrecitas-Chavin, or "Chavinoid" style. They suggest that it may be a "primitive" or pre-classic form of Chavin pottery. As such, it might correspond to undescribed pottery which Tello139 claimed to have found in early or "pre-classic" levels of the Chavin de Huantar site. On the other hand, Torre- citas-Chavin might be contemporaneous with, or later than, classic Chavin. All that we can be certain of is that its ceramic context is comparable to sites of the Chavin horizon. Kotosh-In the vicinity of Huanuco, in one of several "artificial hillocks," Tello140 found "an abundance of Chavin potsherds mixed with other types closely 134 Tello, 1940, 1943. 135 Kroeber, 1925, pp. 240 if. 136 H. and P. Reichlen, 1949. 137 For example, the pottery of Reichlens' Cajamarca II period (1949, fig. 6) has pointed similarity to the Interlocking ceramic style of the central coast and their Period IV (1949, figs. 11, 12) shows a definite increment of Tiahuanaco. Thus, their Torrecitas-Chavin, or incised ware falls in about the proper sequence position for Chavin horizon contemporaneity. 138 H. and P. Reichlen, 1949, pp. 154-156, fig. 4. 139 Tello, 1940, p. 701. 140 Tello, 1943, p. 152. 127</page><page sequence="26">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY resembling, on the one hand, incised and painted pottery of the Paracas caves [Paracas Cavernas?], and, on the other, incised and carved Amazonian pottery." The pottery which Tello illustrates141 appears to be a monochrome ware decorated with incisions, punctations, hachure, brushing, color zoning, pellet applique, and low relief modelling. Designs are circles-and-dots, rectilinear bands, and what appear to be highly stylized life forms. There is an obvious generalized resem- blance to Chavin de Huantar or Anc6n pottery, but Chavin design motives of a classic sort (felines, etc.) are absent and the mention of painted types suggests another context. Tello implies in the caption to the illustration that other and more typically Chavin pottery was found in association.142 Donald Collier142a visited the Kotosh site in 1937. He describes it as being four kilometers southeast of Huanuco and consisting of two mounds, the larger of which is 50 by 25 by 5 meters. Collier observed stone-faced terraces on the mound and stone structures within it. He collected a sample of fifty sherds from the mound surface and from old excavations. These correspond closely to the types which Tello has illustrated plus smooth plain and polished monochrome types. Although Collier describes rim and shape forms as "suggesting the Chavinoid range," he found no Classic Chavin designs nor any painted ware. Guanape-This is a cultural period in the Viru Valley which shows Cupis- nique affiliations. Larco Hoyle143 found such pottery in Viru Valley graves, Ford and Willey144 surveyed several midden or house sites dating from this period, and Strong and Evans145 uncovered a rectangular stone enclosure with Guafiape pottery associated. Guafiape pottery traits parallel those of Cupisnique and Ancon to a great extent except that stylized Chavin feline designs have not been recorded. This absence may be due only to the smallness of the decorated ware sample for the Guafiape period. Guaniape house types are like those Larco Hoyle noted in Chicama for Cupisnique. No stone or conical adobe pyramids could be definitely associated with the period, although a few rather large rectangular stone-walled and adobe- walled enclosures may be Guaiiape public or ceremonial buildings. Bellavista to Chilca-Southward along the coast from Ancon there are several shell midden sites that may pertain to our problem. Uhle described such a midden 141 Idem, pl. 19. 142 See also Tello, 1940, pp. 635-636. 142a Personal communication. 143 Larco Hoyle, 1946, p. 1949. 144 Ford and Willey, 1949. 145 Personal communication. 128</page><page sequence="27">THE CHAVfN PROBLEM and its pottery at Bellavista, near Callao;146 there is another at Chorrillos on the southern outskirts of Lima; and still more near Pachacamac, Cruz de Hueso, Pucusana, and Chilca.147 All of these sites have simple monochrome pottery of a black or reddish color which is indistinguishable from the Early Ancon plain ware. Incised types occur at some of the sites, perhaps at all; but, to the best of my knowledge, there is no record of Chavin stylistic representations, in pottery or other materials, from any of these sites. SITES OF THE THIRD CATEGORY Cerro Sechin-Cerro Sechin is probably the most disputed Chavin claim. In a sense it is comparable to our sites of the "second category" in this survey in that the general cultural context appears to be akin to that of some of the Chavin horizontal sites. A full description of Cerro Sechin has never been published, although Tello, Kroeber, and Carrion have all given brief accounts.148 Donald Collier, who assisted in the original excavations, has enabled me to supplement these statements with additional notes and comments.149 Located at the foot of hill slopes in Casma Valley, the Cerro Sechin temple is a rectangular mass composed of a series of superimposed platforms. The basal platform is of earth rubble and along its north facade are a series of carved stone slabs. In the center of this north faSade a broad stairway led to the top of the platform. Collier is of the opinion that these stairs were made of stone and heavily plastered with mud. Upper platforms of the temple were constructed of conical adobes and then plastered and painted. At one place, jaguar (or puma) figures, painted in red, black, and white, adorn the plastered walls. Tello'50 reconstructs the history of the temple site and its environs as follows. The first occupation and construction was not at Cerro Sechin proper, but was located farther down the slope at some little distance from the present site. Here are the remains of a Classic Chavin period temple completely destroyed by the floods.151 Cerro Sechin proper represents a second occupation on a higher hillside terrace. Subsequently, this building, too, was covered with alluvium, and a third occupation, now marked by dwellings and refuse, covered the site. According to Tello, the cultural associations of these three building stages are: (1) Classic 146 Uhle, 1910. 147 Tello, 1940, p. 679; 1943, p. 157; Strong and Willey, 1943, pp. 18-19. 148 Tello, 1943, pp. 139-150; Kroeber, 1944, p. 48; Carri6n, 1948, p. 110. 149 Collier, personal communication, December, 1950. 150 Tello, 1943, pp. 148-150. 151 Ceramic evidence for this dating has not yet been illustrated. 129</page><page sequence="28">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY Chavin, (2) sub-Chavin, and (3) Santa type. Thus, Cerro Sechin temple proper dates from the second stage, or from what Tello has called the sub-Chavin period. Collier's observations on the pottery from the excavations distinguish three types of pottery. One of these types is a coarse red ware decorated with incisions and reed punctations. This is the pottery which Tello described as "a new kind of incised pottery known from surface rubbish-heaps in almost the whole Casma Valley."'52 From Tello's further statements this type can be equated in time with "sub-Santa," "sub-Chimu," and Inca.153 Apparently, it is not involved with any of the three building stages to which we have just referred. A second style which Collier recognized was a three-color Tiahuanaco Epigonal variant. This is Tello's "Santa" type, associated with the third building stage. Collier's third type he describes as "an undecorated, polished ware, black through brown to red in color, with straight, somewhat thickened rims, largely from bowls." This is apparently the type which Tello called "sub-Chavin" and which he (Tello) correlated with the temple of Cerro Sechin and its carved stone monoliths. Collier, however, is hesitant to establish such a correlation between the Cerro Sechln temple and the plain, monochrome pottery. Even if we accept the association of this sub-Chavin pottery and the Sechin pyramid and carvings, the picture is still very confused, owing to the definition of sub-Chavin. Tello154 describes sub-Chavin pottery as . . . in every way resembling that discovered in the Teatino cemetery, in the Supe burial ground near Faro [Lighthouse site], where Uhle labored years ago, in various Nepefia and Santa cemeteries, and in the lowest layer of a cutting made by the La Leche River close to the Batan Grande Huaca [Lambayeque]. The rubbish, judging from the pottery, belongs to the Chavin culture in its second period, called by the writer sub-Chavin, to which also belong the vessels found by Bennett in the Gallinazo cemetery, in Virui. No consistent style can be reconstructed from this. Teatino "Chavin," as Kroeber156 has commented, is typologically and chronologically the equivalent of Middle Ancon I of the Coast Tiahuanaco horizon; Bennett's Gallinazo157 is a negative horizon type; and Uhle's cemetery at the Faro, Supe is firmly linked to the Chavin style.158 The typological and chronological gamut represented by 152 Tello, 1943, p. 145. 153 This is also the ware which Kroeber (1944, pl. 22) illustrates. 154 Tello, 1943, p. 144.

The ceramics of Cerro Sechin, as they have been presented, certainly do not aid in the dating of the temple and its carvings. Cerro Sechin's stone monuments are flat, unshaped slabs with low relief incised and champleve designs. The designs comprise standing humans, separate heads (possibly representing severed or trophy heads), dismembered bodies, and rather simple geometrical figures. The style is more rigid and much less sophisticated than that of Chavin de Huantar. In it I see no close connections with Chavin.'59 As has been mentioned, the Pickman Strombus, the small stone vase from Chiclayo, and the Humaya bone spatula offer an interesting stylistic linkage in that all three pieces combine Sechin and Chavin elements. One other Peruvian piece, a carved bone spatula from the Huaca Prieta refuse mound of the Chicama Valley, has a design that is very reminiscent of the Sechin men figures.160 This specimen cannot be dated exactly, but it probably belongs with the Cupisnique or coast Chavin period at that site. Cerro Sechin's place in Peruvian chronology and its relationships to the Chavin horizons are unclear. The nature of the temple structure, with its use of stone, mud, and conical adobes, implies a fairly early date. The painted jaguars suggest Chavin. The plain monochrome pottery, which Tello calls sub- Chavin, sounds very much like the plain ware of a Chavin ceramic complex;161 but there is some question as to whether or not it is associated with the temple. The Cerro Sechin carvings are not stylistically Chavin, nor do they resemble any other major Peruvian style. Resmemblances to this Sechin style are seen in occasional specimens from the north coast, some of which also combine Chavin decorative elements. We can only conclude that Cerro Sechin is either later than the Chavin horizon (as Tello suggests with his "sub-Chavin" concept) or that it is an earlier coastal style antedating and eventually blending with Chavin.l62 For reasons to be discussed later the second interpretation is favored. Teatino or Lachay-This cemetery site is located on the north side of the Chancay Valley. The earliest graves of the cemetery are named by Tello as "sub-Chavin." As stated above, I have identified the incised grave pottery from this site as Middle Ancon I.163 This pottery differs in ware, shape, and design 159 See also Kroeber, 1944, pp. 49-50. 160 Junius B.

Strong164 has presented evidence to ally it chronologically with Coast Tiahuanaco. Chanapata-This early site, near Cuzco, was excavated by Rowe165 who found stone faced terraces, bone tools, simple ground stone tools, obsidian points, pottery figurines, polished black incised and applique pottery, and white-on-red pottery. Presumably, Tello and Carrion have the black incised ware in mind when they consider Chanapata as a Chavin site. Chanapata blackware is found in open bowls, bottles, plates, and olla forms. These are somewhat like the vessel forms of Chavin de Huantar, but there are notable differences, such as the presence of strap handles on both the open bowls and ollas. Decoration is in both broad and fine-line incision, applique strips, punctation, and low relief modeling. Incised designs are stiff, rectilinear animals (cats), chevrons, diamonds, and rectangles. The cat bears no resemblance to the Chavin feline, in total stylized conception or in detail. Pucara-This site, excavated by Kidder II,166 appears to be a ceremonial center constructed of dressed stone blocks and incorporating such features as altars and subterranean burial vaults. The pottery is a polychrome black and yellow on red with color zones separated by fine-line incisions. Design centers upon the feline, which is rendered both in the flat and in high relief modelling; but the feline stylization167 is not that of Chavin. Paracas, Ocucaje-Paracas Cavemas style pottery is found at these two sites on the south coast. Close similarity with Ancon and Supe is seen in a flat-bottomed, dark-ware, incised bowl type; 168 but, for the most part, Paracas Cavernas ceramics are in a polychrome tradition. A fanged cat-face,l69 incised and painted, lacks the characteristic Chavin rendering. Associated also is negative painted pottery,l70 a decorative technique rarely found in the same context with Chavin types. Socos, La Victoria-For Socos, the only reference which I have is the Carrion chart.171 The design shown here, presumably from a pottery vessel, seems com- pletely un-Chavin. La Victoria is mentioned only on the map.172 Non-Peruvian Styles and Cultures-Tello and Carrion 173 have both expressed 164 Strong, 1925, pp. 183-184. 165 Rowe, 1944. 166 Kidder, 1943. 167 See Bennett, 1946, pl. 37. 168 Kroeber, 1944, pl. 14F. 169 Idem, pl. 13E. 170 Idem, pl. 16. 171 Carri6n, 1948, pl. 26. 172 Idem, pl. 27. 173 Tello, 1940, 1943; Carri6n, 1948. 132</page><page sequence="31">THE CHAVIN PROBLEM the opinion that several archaeological sites or cultures lying outside of Peru and, for the most part, beyond the borders of the central Andean area were component manifestations of the Chavin style, culture, civilization, or empire. To the south, Tiahuanaco of Bolivia174 and Barreales of northwest Argen- tina175 are considered as Chavin outposts. The Early and Classic Tiahuanaco cultures and their stone sculptural and ceramic styles are well known.176 The feline, condor, and serpent are represented in Tiahuanaco art, but their configura- tion is distinctively that recognized as Tiahuanaco, not Chavin. Tiahuanaco pottery is polychrome, and its vessel shapes are non-Chavin. Early Tiahuanaco may, possibly, be as early as the Chavin horizon; Classic Tiahuanaco is, almost certainly, later. Barreales is an incised, dark ware, and in these features it is reminiscent of Chavin. The designs on the vessels, while possible of central Andean inspiration, are not rendered in the Chavin style.177 From Moxos,178 or Mojos, in the Bolivian lowlands, the ceramic types of Lower and Upper Velarde, Hermarck, and Masicito are known from the work of Nordenskiold and the resumes of Bennett and Howard.179 Velarde and Hem- marck are painted ceramics. Lower Velarde is an isolated style which Bennett has equated, chronologically, with Derived Tiahuanaco. Hemmarck has rather general Amazonian affiliations. Masicito is an incised type, but I see no Chavin parallels. The painted, carved, and modelled pottery of Marajo and the wares of Rio Ahuaimo and Napo-Aguarico, which Tello mentioned,180 seem to me to be quite unlike Chavin. If a similarity does exist it is so deeply buried by stylization, reduc- tion, and modification that it loses meaning. Nor do I see the strong and specific Chavin resemblances in the various regions of Ecuador to which Tello and Carrion refer.l81 The one possible excep- tion is Carrion's Azuay illustration, but the provenience of this specimen is dubious.l82 174 See Carrion, 1948, pl. 27. 175 Tello, 1943, p. 159. 176 Bennett, 1934. 177 See Marquez Miranda, 1946, pl. 142, fig. 63. 178 See Tello, 1940, p. 636; Carri6n, 1948. 179 Nordenskiold, 1913; Bennett, 1936; Howard, 1947. 180 Tello, 1940, p. 636; see Howard, 1947, pp. 42-44 for a review of these. 181 Tello (1940, p. 680; 1943, pp. 158-159) and Carri6n (1948, p. 112, pl. 27) list the following Ecuadorean sites or regions as being stations of the Chavin stylistic influence: Azuay, Cerro Narrio, Alausi, Cuenca, Sigsig, Chordeleg, Saraguro, Manta, Elen Pata, Island of Puna, Puntos de Mar, Chinguilanchi, Rircay, Uchucay, Manabi.

Although a distinct entity, it emerges with a residue from the past. This continuity with the past, and by implication with the future, is the tradition. In this discussion we have conceived of the synchronous distribution of the Chavin art pattern through space as an horizon style. As such, it constituted one dimension of our inquiry. The complementary dimension, the diachronous continuity of Chavin through time, may be termed the Chavin tradition. The diagnostics of a tradition are determined by the historical problem. For example, in attempting to demonstrate the linkage of a series of ceramic styles through Peruvian culture sequences, the confines of the tradition may be laid down as "white-on-red painting," "incising," or "plastic ornamentation."183 The tradition limits are, here, determined by what we have in another context referred to as the "technological aspect of style." When we turn to the problem of a Chavin tradition, it is doubtful if it could be usefully defined by technological criteria. "Incision" or "carving" as determinants would provide us with such a wide-meshed screen that we would admit a super-abundance of irrelevant data. The field must be narrowed to utilize only the "representational aspect of the Chavin style," the feline motif and its combinations, as the core of the Chavin traditional continuum. When we arrive at this point, we realize that this is what Tello has done. For him, the Chavin problem was the history of the feline deity in the development of Peruvian cultures. His greatest work, Wira-Kocha, is a profound essay upon the occurrence and reoccurrence of the feline god in all regions and in all periods of native Peru. He conceived of this deity as the binding and unifying force in Andean culture. This is diagrammatically expressed in Tello's first chronological- developmental chart.184 In this he shows the monogenesis of the different branches of Peruvian culture from a single trunk, with the implication that all branches carry within themselves the idea of feline deity. Finally, in the epoch of the Inca, the chart illustrates the terminal coalescence of the multiple lines of cultural development so that they again form a single trunk under the same ancient feline god, now called Viracocha. It has been noted that in his earlier writings Tello considered Chavin to be a "Second Epoch" culture, an esthetic refinement of the feline idea. Apparently, at this stage of his career, he was not certain as to the exact nature of the 183 Willey, 1945, pp. 53-55. 184 Tello, 1922, opp. p. 10. 134</page><page sequence="33">THE CHAVfN PROBLEM monogenic mother-culture of the Andes. "Archaic North Andean" remained a tentative formulation, in spite of the fact that he sometimes identified it with Recuay pottery. Not until after the discoveries in the Nepenia Valley, with their obvious structural stratigraphy, did he become convinced that Chavin was the original and parent stock. At about the same time Tello's approach and meth- odology appear to coincide with the Uhle-Kroeber point of view. He had estab- lished a new horizon, comparable to Tiahuanaco and Inca, but underlying the established Early or Classic cultures; and he had characterized and defined this horizon as an extension of the striking art style of Chavin de Huantar. Yet, in spite of these surface indications that his interests had shifted to synchronous correlations, his statement on methodologyl85 and his exposition of the Chavin problem'86 show no important change in his thinking. Tello remained convinced that stratigraphy was relatively unimportant in the understanding of Peruvian cultural development because his dominant interest was in continuity rather than periodicity. This is very clearly reflected in his observations on cultural "trees" and the confused intermingling of their "branches." As far as Chavin is con- cerned it is safe to assume that he was more interested in the total "tree" than in any chronological segments selected from it by a means as arbitrary as stratig- raphy. The misunderstandings of Tello's theories on Chavin, largely held by North Americans, derive from the fact that he operated with two concepts, and was not at pains to keep them separate. Chavin as a tradition was to him para- mount, while Chavin as an horizon style was of secondary importance. The implications of much of this are seen in the Tello-Carrion Chavin claims which we have just reviewed. The feline representations of Pucara, Tiahuanaco, Chanapata, and Barreales may be a part of an historically related Chavin tradition which has crystallized in different styles as it has diffused outward in space or upward in time from its original hearth. This is a reasonable possibility and a valid working hypothesis. On the other hand, to consider them a part of the Chavin style horizon is untenable. This does not necessarily prove that all of them are chronologically later than the Chavin horizon. It does mean, however, that the presence of the feline representation in these various styles cannot be taken as proof of their contemporaneity or intimate historical connection with the Chavin style. The problem has been complicated in still another way-by accepting the "technological aspect of style" as the style itself. This is, obviously, what Tello has done in the case of Teatino. Teatino incised pottery has neither the configura- 185 Tello, 1940, p. 626. 186 Tello, 1943. 135</page><page sequence="34">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY tion nor (to my knowledge) the feline representations of Chavin style. The monochrome ware and the decorative technique, incision, have been used as the Chavin diagnostics.87 In some cases this seems to be more justifiable than at Teatino where the Middle Ancon I-Coast Tiahuanaco typological and chrono- logical coirdinates are evident. Las Torrecitas, Kotosh, Guafiape, and the Bella- vista-Chilca sites are all reminiscent of the Chavin style because of the incised technique; but in all of these the total context of the culture, the specific vessel forms, the monochrome ware, and the other associated elements, support the Chavin claim. In Las Torrecitas and Guainape the Chavin contention is further strengthened by an early stratigraphic position. At Kotosh, the chronological and associational picture is not clear. Cerro Sechin is another instance of a Chavin identification made largely upon the basis of the technological aspects of style-flat, line-carving on stone. Here, the architectural context supports an early dating, although the ceramic associa- tions blur the picture. It is undoubtedly significant that there are no evidences whatsoever of either the Chavin style or the Chavin tradition as we have defined them in this analysis. Their absence at Las Torrecitas, Guaniape, or Bellavista- Chilca might be due to limited archaeological sampling or to functional cause (small villages as opposed to important ceremonial sites); but their absence at Cerro Sechin, in the temple carvings, seems more likely to have a chronological explanation. As the Chavin or feline tradition, in one stylistic form or another, persists in a great many post-Chavin horizon cultures and periods, its non-appear- ance in an early culture would favor a pre-Chavin horizon position. The assump- tion here is that the feline representation in central Andean art began with Chavin, that, in effect, the Chavin tradition began with the first appearance of the Chavin style. Other Peruvian or Andean sites or cultures where Chavin traditional, although not stylisic, influence may be seen are too numerous to be described in full here. Recuay, Mochica, and Gallinazo of Viriu are example. Bennett'sl88 identification of a grave from the Gallinazo site group as Chavin was based upon the representational (cat figure on textile) and the technological (incised black ware) aspects of Chavin rather than the Chavin style itself. This grave dates from the latter part of the Gallinazo period and, as such, is consider- ably later than the Chavin horizon. The distinctive, linear "Recuay cat" is a dominant motif in the Recuay painted 187 Tello, 1940, p. 680. 188 Bennett, 1939, p. 79, fig. 15a,b. 136</page><page sequence="35">THE CHAVfN PROBLEM ceramic style. Its prototype for the feline idea may very well have been Chavin, but its style is its own. An interesting utilization of the concept of the Chavin or feline tradition is Larco Hoyle's statement on Mochica religion: 189 Mochica religion centers around feline symbolism, and it seems reasonable to believe that in this period we have, with a new elaboration and sophistication of animal worship, a continuation of the old feline deity of the North Coast. There is no claim here that this is Chavin, for Larco's treatment of the Chavin style is by horizon. It is, however, a realization of the traditional content of the style. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Chavin is the name given to a prehistoric art style of the north Peruvian area. The name derives from the highland site of Chavin de Huantar where the style is well represented. Chavin style is manifested over a region bordered on the north by Piura (coast) and Pacopampa (highland) and on the south by Ancon (coast) and Chavin de Huantar (highland). In the highlands, it has been reported, but not described, from sites south of Chavin de Huantar. On the basis of present infor- mation, these are the geographical limits of the style. The point of origin of the Chavin style is unknown, although it is likely that it was first developed within the geographical limits stated. Larco Hoyle is of the opinion that Chavin type art (Nepeina, as he would call it) developed on the coast, probably in the Nepeiia Valley and spread from there to the highlands. Tello takes the counter-position, bringing it from highlands to coast. Tello's theories of origins are somewhat more complex than this as he postulates begin- nings in the Amazonian forests to the east of the Andes. In following these theories he has offered similarities between the Chavin style and certain Amazonian ceramic styles as proof of Amazonian origins. These similarities have not been demonstrated to the general satisfaction of other investigators. The chronological limits of the Chavin style fall early in the Peruvian se- quences. Its terminal date in the relative scale is indicated, for the most part, by the inception of the White-on-red horizon periods. This is substantiated in several instances by stratigraphy. The lower limits of the Chavin style appear to be defined by an early pre-maize, semi-horticultural period; although this is much less securely tied down than the upper limit White-on-red horizon dating.. 189 Larco Hoyle, 1946, p. 171. 137</page><page sequence="36">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY In general classificatory terms, the Chavin style is placed on the Early Formative stage of Peruvian prehistory and given the estimated dates of 1000-0 BC. In contrast to our above conclusions, there are claims that the Chavin style, or Chavin culture, was spread much more widely than the Peruvian north coast and highlands and that its chronological limits extend much later than the White-on-red horizon. Most of these claims have been advanced by the late Dr J. C. Tello. To test these claims it was first necessary to define just what was to be included under the term Chavin. To begin with, we considered only the art style of Chavin, dropping for the time being all connotations of Chavin as a culture, a civilization, or an empire. The Chavin style was then defined as being identical to, or closely resembling, the designs of the stone carvings of the type site, Chavin de Huantar. For analy- sis, Chavin style was broken down into: (1) the technology of carving or incis- ing; (2) representations of the feline, human, bird, serpent, and composites of these; and (3) the peculiar configuration of the representations as this is ex- pressed in the curvilinear forms, massive heads, smaller intricately disposed heads, curved fangs, and other elements. This third aspect of the Chavin style was considered as its most unique quality and, therefore, diagnostic of the style. With the stylistic pattern or configuration as an index of contemporaneity, seventeen sites or regions, including the type site, were determined as having Chavin style manifestations in stone, ceramics, bone, wood, textiles, metals, or in two or more of these. The other Chavin claims were examined and rejected on the basis of absence of evidence for this stylistic pattern. Of the seventeen sites or regions possessing the Chavin style, it was demonstrated that eight were similar in cultural context. This similarity of context is seen in various traits, but is best expressed in monochrome, dark, often polished pottery of simple forms, occasional stirrup-spout jars, and incised or surface-manipulated decora- tion. On the remaining eight sites, six are either isolated Chavin style finds or situations where there is only limited contextual data. For the final two sites or regions, adequate context is available, particularly in ceramics; but this context is notably different from that of the first eight sites with their dark-colored, monochrome, incised wares. One of the two is Mochica with its elaborately modelled and red-on-white pottery which, only rarely, bears a Chavin style incised and painted design. Stratigraphic and seriational data indicate Mochica to be later than the other sites or cultures linked by the Chavin style. The second of the two is Kuntur Wasi. Its pottery has more resemblance to the majority of Chavin style sites than does Mochica; nevertheless, it has features which link it with Salinar rather than Chavin. As Salinar is the time period intermediate 138</page><page sequence="37">THE CHAVfN PROBLEM between Cupisnique (Coastal Chavin) and Mochica, it is suggested that Kuntur Wasi, or comparable sites of the sierra, served as a chronological conductive link to pass the Chavin style from Cupisnique to Mochica. It can be concluded that Chavin style does, as has been supposed, assemble largely on a time horizon antecedent to the White-on-red styles and that on this horizon there is appreciable similarity of cultural context. On the north coast and in the adjacent highlands there are two instances of its continuation into later time periods: Kuntur Wasi and Mochica. At Kuntur Wasi Chavin style is a feature of stone sculpture and, possibly, although not certainly, of pottery; in Mochica it is only a very minor ingredient in ceramics. Thus, there is some substance to the claims of the chronological persistence of Chavin as a style. It should be noted, however, that these later persistences are not common and are extremely limited in a geographical sense. What then of the many other Chavin claims? None of these have been veri- fied from the standpoint of style. Their similarity to the Chavin style lies in their representations or in their technological aspects. The central representation of Chavin art is the feline being, presumably a deity. One of Tello's greatest contributions to Andean studies was to show the great geographical and chrono- logical range of the feline as an art motif. These feline representations, although appearing in many distinct art styles and in different time periods, may reason- ably be related as a Chavin tradition-a concept quite different from that of Chavin style. It is likely that this tradition of the feline originated in, or was introduced into, the central Andean area at the time of the Chavin style horizon. At least, it has not yet been found earlier. The feline is present in the styles of Chanapata, Pucara, Paracas Caveras, and Tiahuanaco, to name only a few of those that have been identified as sites or cultures of a Chavin civilization. All of these lie outside of the geographical limits of the Chavin style as these have been plotted; and all are probably somewhat later in time than the Chavin style horizon. A good many of the Chavin claims can be linked neither by style nor by the feline tradition. Here, it appears that the Chavin techniques of incising or carving have formed the basis of the Chavin identification. In many cases, such as Las Torrecitas, Guainape, the Bellavista-Chilca sites, and, possibly, Kotosh, these claims are partially supported by chronology and general cultural context. In other cases, the incision technique has been used to identify as Chavin or sub-Chavin a site or culture which is chronologically much later than and typo- logically at great variance with the Chavin horizon. So far we have not touched upon the functional problem. What was the 139</page><page sequence="38">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY nature of Chavin? Obviously, it was difficult to pose this question until there had been some segregation of the concepts bearing upon Chavin. If we consider only those sites which are linked together by the common possession of the Chavin art style, can we say that these form a Chavin culture or civilization? Some cul- tural uniformity exists, but there are important differences. It is as though a common cultural heritage of maize agriculture, a type of ceramics, carving and incising techniques, weaving, and the pattern of simple dwelling units in small villages were possessed or transmitted to the peoples of northern Peru. Coincident with this, or perhaps shortly afterward, regional specialization also appeared, so that some communities of the north coast constructed adobe pyramids, other north coastal groups worked in mud frescos, highland peoples developed the stone-faced platforms with interior galleries and impressive carving, and the vil- lages of the central coast built no outstanding monuments. Metallurgy was advanced on the far north coast; in the Chicama Valley ceramics were most elaborate; and elsewhere there were other specializations. To visualize all of these as belonging to the same culture could, in the broader sense, be justified; but it should also be recognized that the unit is not comparable to other Peruvian archaeological cultures, such as the Mochica or Nazca. These last were certainly much tighter knit, more homogeneous entities than such a Chavin culture. If there is some hesitancy in accepting Chavin as a culture, there is more agreement for another of Tello's concepts, that the Chavin culture possessed a common religious bond. This seems the best explanation for the phenomenon we have defined as the Chavin horizon style. Larco Hoyle190 has dealt with this at some length, elaborating the idea that the feline cult spread among peoples who possessed a somewhat similar but regionally differentiated culture. Population size and distribution and the absence of evidence of organized mili- tarism in Chavin horizon times have been proposed as conditions that would have made for the peaceful spread of such a religious cult.19l Accepting the spread of the Chavin style as the evidence of a rapidly diffused religious cult, what, then, is the significance of the Chavin or feline tradition as it occurs beyond the temporal and spatial limits of the style? To this ques- tion I submit the following hypotheses. First, the disappearance of an art style as mature and as integrated as Chavin must almost certainly have marked the dissolution or the radical transformation of the system which stood behind the symbol of the style. In sum, the particular religious cult of the Chavin style feline was destroyed or died. Second this cult was not immediately forgotten but 190 Larco Hoyle, 1941. 191 Willey, 1948. 140</page><page sequence="39">THE CHAVfN PROBLEM persisted in Kuntur Wasi and Mochica where its emblems are found as minor parts of new stylistic assemblages or patterns. And, third, some of its central themes and beliefs were incorporated into chronologically later or geographically more remote religious systems as is attested by the traditional continuity of the feline being in the art styles of these systems.
