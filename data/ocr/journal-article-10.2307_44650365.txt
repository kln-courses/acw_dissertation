Roberts Highway Safety Research Institute, The University of Michigan H. D. Portnoy Oakland Neurological Clinic REAR-END COLLISIONS are the most frequently occurring type of motor vehicle collision. During 1968, there were 14.6 million accidents involving motor vehicles in the United States. Of that total, 49%, or 7.04 million, were same direction or rear-end type accidents (1)*. The total number of fatal ac- cidents during the same period was 46,800, with rear-end type accidents accounting for 9%, or 4500 accidents. Thus, al- though the rear-end collision is a common type of accident, the fatality rate associated with it is low, particularly for the occupants of the vehicle being struck from the rear. The gen- erally low severity of most rear-end collisions is indicated by the results of a statistical analysis of the accident report data of the combined files of the University of Michigan and UCLA for 1968-1969 which produced the frequency distribution of crash closing velocities at impact shown in Fig. 1 . The mean closing velocity was 26 mph or approximately a 13 mph bar- rier crash equivalent. The characteristic types of injuries sus- *Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. tained by occupants of the struck vehicle in nonfatal accidents are the so-called "whiplash" or hyperextension injuries. These injuries range from minor temporary neck and back aches to severe injuries involving dislocated and fractured cervical ver- tebrae and spinal damage. Quite frequently the soft tissues and ligaments of the neck are torn or strained. A study of 207 cases of hyperextension-hyperflexion injuries was made recently by Gurdjian, et al. (2), in which 137 of the cases were caused by rear-end collisions. Gurdjian's list of the potential for injury in these cases includes injury to the bones of the neck, spinal nerves extending out of the cervical spine, and the sympathetic nerves along the lateral aspect of the spine, as well as injuries to the muscles and ligaments of the neck. Blood vessel injury, spinal cord injury and, in some cases, even brain injury (subdural hematomas), can occur from hyperextension (3). In the less severe forms of whiplash in- jury, the mechanisms of injury are not readily diagnosed even though definite symptoms exist. In many cases the symptoms do not show up until some later time. In order to better understand the mechanics of whiplash, ABSTRACT Present head restraint systems quite often restrict rearward visibility, and when not properly adjusted, their effectiveness suffers. The déployable head restraint can overcome both these problems and in addition provide head restraint perfor- mance better than fixed systems. This paper describes a pro- ject to study the feasibility of déployable head restraints. Starting with two-dimensional computer simulations of front seat occupant kinematics in rear-end collisions, initial performance criteria for deployment times, and restraint con- figurations were determined for various impact velocities. Based on these criteria, two types of déployable systems were designed and constructed, one an inflatable system and the other a rigid sliding system. These prototype systems then underwent a test and development program using anthropo- morphic dummies and an impact sled. The test program eval- uated the effectiveness of the head restraint systems under high- and low-speed crash simulations. In addition, tests were performed to study the effect of restraint deployment on the malpositioned occupant. The results of the test program are discussed and comparisons are made between the two proto- type systems and existing head restraint designs. 2877</page><page sequence="2">2878 J. W.

They concluded that neck torque is the limiting injury factor in both hyper- extension and hyperflexion environments, and that for the elimination of hyperex tension injury, the extension angle must be kept under 80 deg and preferably under 60 deg. A recent study utilizing live baboons (5) concluded that head restraint design should minimize head to restraint distances for maxi- mum effectiveness in severe crash environments. In spite of the nonlethal nature of many whiplash injuries, the high frequency of occurrence of rear-end collisions and the resulting number of injuries produced by such accidents can create serious public health problems in terms of disability and medical expense. Since January 1, 1969, all new automobiles manufactured for sale in the United States have been required to include head restraint protection for occupants at each outboard front seating position. The two most common forms of head re- straint presently in use in automobiles are either fixed exten- sions of the seat back or a separate head cushion, adjustable for height^ attached to the seat back. The FMVSS Standard 202 pertaining to head restraints requires that during a half- sine acceleration pulse of 8-9.6 G amplitude and 80-96 ms duration, the rearward rotation of the head relative to the torso shall be limited to 45 deg by the action of the head re- straint. Current head restraint systems can provide protection for vehicle occupants during crashes. However, they too often do not because of improper adjustment. In addition, they re- strict rearward visibility for many drivers and are therefore a design compromise hopefully providing adequate protection while sacrificing not too much in rearward visibility. The con- cept of a déployable head restraint offers a promising solution to this problem. Since it would remain out of sight in the seat back until required, it would not compromise rearward visibil- ity or comfort, and the size, shape, and location of the de- ployed head restraint can be optimized with regard to bio- mechanical factors involved in preventing injury. Similarly, consideration can be directed toward providing protection from oblique impacts in addition to rear-end impacts and re- bounds. This paper describes the design, development, and perfor- mance of prototype head restraint systems. DEPLOYABLE HEAD RESTRAINT DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS As a first step in defining déployable head restraint perfor- mance requirements the HSRI two-dimensional crash victim computer model (6) was exercised in both frontal and rear im- pact simulations using experimentally determined crash pro- files and idealized crash profiles. The goals of the computer simulations were to determine: 1 . The crash conditions in which a protective headrest is re- quired. 2. Occupant motions in these cases. 3. The point in time and location of the occupant when a déployable head restraint would be useful in preventing oc- cupant injury. 4. The response characteristics of a déployable device neces- sary to prevent potential injuries to the vehicle occupants. Rear-end crash deceleration profiles used in the computer simulations were all based on car-to-car simulations as opposed to car-to-barrier. They were: 30 niph- 1966 Chevrolet (7), 55 mph-1967 Ford (7), 5 mph-1962 Rambler (HSRI), an idealized 30 mph-10 G trapezoidal pulse, and an idealized 80 mph-40 G trapezoidal pulse. These crash profiles are shown in Fig. 2. The occupant sizes simulated were 5th percentile fe- male and 95th percentile male and both 21- and 25-in seat- back heights were used. The occupants were either unre- strained or restrained by a lap belt only.

Fig. 2 - Rear-end crash profiles used in computer simulations phase of the study were an average 40 mph frontal barrier im- pact based on information from DOT, an idealized 40 mph 30 G trapezoidal pulse, and an idealized 20 mph 15 G trap- ezoidal pulse. The occupant sizes simulated were 5th percen- tile female and 95th percentile male in order to bracket the range of occupant sitting heights. Both 21- and 25 -in seat- back heights were used. The front seat occupants were re- strained with either seat belt, airbag, or seat belt plus shoulder harness arrangements. For rear seat occupants, the same con- ditions were used except that they were either unrestrained or restrained by seat belt only. Contact surfaces representing the back and top of the front seat were included in the rear seat occupant simulations. The computer simulations for both frontal and rear-end crashes indicated the need for head restraint either to prevent severe hyperextension of the neck and/ or to prevent occupant interaction when rear seat passengers were involved in frontal crashes. The crash profiles chosen for the study were in many cases quite severe and thus provide practical minimum limits on points in time and practical maximum limits on occupant motions. In addition to the computer simulation study a survey of ex- isting and proposed déployable head restraint designs was made. Initial evaluation of déployable head restraint systems was based on the following criteria: 1. Adequate distribution of head restraint forces, control of head accelerations, and control of head/neck displacement and flexure for the prevention of injury. 2. Rapid deployment, in conjunction with crash sensor and system initiation time requirements, to provide effective pro- tection. 3. Minimization of hazard to vehicle occupants in various possible positions and locations, both during a crash and dur- ing inadvertent activation. 4. Reliable activation on signal from the crash sensor, and reliable avoidance or inadvertent activation. 5. Simplicity, productibility, and minimum cost. 6. Requirements relative to other vehicle systems, such as seat structures. 7. Tolerance to environmental conditions likely to be en- countered while installed in automobiles in use in the United States for periods of time up to ten years. 8. Nonsusceptibility to vandalism or tampering. In discussing the above criteria, it was felt that the perfor- mance of the déployable head restraint system should not be just equivalent to existing fixed head restraints but, if possible, its performance should exceed that of conventional systems. Thus, it was concluded that the computer simulation results should be analyzed with the aim of defining a system time- space configuration which would minimize the occupant's total head motion. This goal, combined with a state-of-the-art crash sensing and discrimination time allowance of 20 ms and a deployment time allowance of 20 ms, was used to define a surface extending above the seat back against which an oc- cupant's head would come into contact in less than 40 ms after crash initiation in the conventional rear-end crash condi- tions that were studied. For the case of the 80 mph 40 G crash structure simulation, the same occupant configuration was found to occur at 25 ms after crash initiation. Since a 20 ms deployment time appears to be at the limit of the pres- ent state-of-the-art, it is apparent that a much quicker means of sensing such a severe crash would be necessary to meet a 5 ms sensing and discrimination time budget. The HSRI two-dimensional crash victim computer model was modified by the addition of an upper seat back structure that produced a plane surface which satisfied the condition that the occupant's head (either 95th percentile male or 5th percentile female) would begin to contact the surface at 40 ms after the initiation of the most severe conventional rear-end crash profile (55 mph, Severy, shown in Fig. 2). The upper structure was initially given the same load-deflection proper- ties as those of the seat back. The modified computer model</page><page sequence="4">2880 J. W. MELVIN, ET AL. Fig. 3 - Anthropometric considerations for head restraint Top-of-Head Location 95% Male Eyellipse Lower V I 99th Female Tangent Cutoff | ' Percentage line / ' was then exercised using the rear-end crash profiles shown in Fig. 2. In general, the results of the simulations indicated excellent performance of the chosen head restraint configuration. The relative angle between the head and the torso did not even approach zero until the second half of the crash pulse with typical maximum extension angles in the range of 20 deg dur- ing the rearward motion into the seat.. Rebound of the occu- pants out of the seat produced larger positive or extension angles due to the torso rebounding more rapidly than the head. In the case of the 95th percentile male simulations, interac- tions of the occupant's head with the roof of the car produced serious head loading but the extension angles did not exceed 45 deg. This interaction was due in part to the occupant ramp- ing up the seat back into the roof and occurred even with seat belt restraint. In order to study the effect of head restraint load-deflection characteristics on occupant motions, simulations were per- formed with a head restraint one half as stiff and a head re- straint twice as stiff as the system simulated initially. Com- pared to the initial simulation, both the stiffer and the less stiff systems tended to produce slightly higher head decelera- tions. The stiffer system did not allow as high head rotations as occurred initially, but produced higher rotations when there was head-roof contact. The less stiff system allowed larger initial head rotations than the other two systems. It was apparent from the computer simulations of the head restraint system that the load-deflection characteristics of the restraint must be carefully selected with respect to the seat- back characteristics to minimize head decelerations during the initial contact phase of the crash and also to minimize the pos- sibility of serious extension during rebound. The configuration of a déployable head restraint system is also subject to stored and deployed height requirements. These basically anthropometric requirements were determined from the existing literature (8). Fig. 3 shows the locations of the baseline requirements for the seating system that was used in the experimental phase of this project. The eyellipse lower line defines a maximum stored height that the system may have and still give adequate rear vision for small drivers (21 .5 in above the H-Point). The upper line locates the top of the head for large occupants (32 in above the H-Point). A deployed restraint height approximately 2 in below this line was used in the design of déployable head restraint systems. Two basic déployable head restraint configurations were de- signed, one inflatable, the other rigid. The inflatable system</page><page sequence="5">DEPLOYABLE HEAD RESTRAINTS 288 1 Fig. 4 - Inflatable head restraint configuration ( i'n ' I Fig. 5 - Rigid déployable head restraint configuration is shown schematically in Fig. 4. The rotating hatch which covers the restraint in its stored position serves to shape the initial deployment of the bag and, following full deployment, provides fore and aft stiffness to the system in its vertical position. The rigid system is basically a vertical sliding plane and is shown schematically in Fig. 5. It was decided that the head restraints would remain in place following the initial crash pulse in order to provide protection from possible sub- sequent secondary collisions, since the configuration of the restraints would not significantly impair driver control of the vehicle. The configurations of the deployed head restraint systems chosen for this study, when considered with their associated seat structure, were intended to produce the equivalent of a load distribution couch for riding down the acceleration pro- file of a rear-end collision in the most efficient means pos- sible. SYSTEM DESIGN This section discusses the design and fabrication of the two types of déployable head restraints used in this study. One prototype of a rigid sliding déployable head restraint was con- structed, whereas three types of inflating déployable head re- straints were constructed. INFLATING DEPLOYABLE HEAD RESTRAINT DE- SIGN - Phase I: Déployable Head Restraint System - An inflatable head restraint system was supplied by the Eaton Corp. con- sisting of an inflator system utilizing the inflation bottle and diffuser from their existing steering wheel airbag system and a special 12-in diameter cylindrical head restraint 18 in long specified by HS RI. The large diameter of the bag was neces- sary in order to achieve the proper vertical travel above the undeployed package height which included the inflator system as it is internal to the bag in the Eaton design. The accom- panying rotating stabilization flap was designed and fabricated by HSRI. The flap was a curved sandwich panel pivoted at its outboard ends. The core material was balsa wood and the skin material was aluminum. Fig. 6 shows the system in its deployed configuration, which in this particular picture is a preinflated version. In the preinflated test series the bag was used without the inflator system and instead, a polyethylene bag was put inside the dacron restraint bag to eliminate air leakage. Phase II : Déployable Head Restraint System - The Olin Corp. supplied special inflator units for use with head restraint bags made by Uniroyal. The bags were made of rubber-coated fabric with vulcanized seams and were elliptical in cross sec- tion- 8 in deep, 10 in high, and 18 in wide. The inflator was designed to mount below the bag in order to minimize the stored height of the restraint package. The inflator bottle was a special rechargeable design by Olin using the augmented air principle of inflation. Prior to testing, the inflator bottle was pressurized to 1800-2400 psi with compressed air. The se- quence of events following activation of the system is: 1 . A squib is ignited in the pyrotechnic portion of the in- flator. 2. Pyrotechnic pressure is built up rupturing a disc which allows the hot gas to enter the chamber where the high-pres- sure air is stored. 3. The heating of the high-pressure air causes a second disc to rupture allowing the gases to fill the restraint bag. The stabilizing flap used with the Eaton system was also used for the initial tests of the Olin system. These tests utilized pre- inflated bags without the inflators. Following the tests of the preinflated systems, modifications of both the bag mounting plate and the stabilization flap de- sign were made. The flap was redesigned for compactness and low weight by making it a single curved plate of 3/16 in thick aluminum. The number of pivot points was increased to four by the addition of two inboard pivot bearings. The bag</page><page sequence="6">2882 j. w. MELVIN, ET AL. Fig. 6 - Deployed configuration of Phase I system (pre- mila ted) Fig. 7 - Phase II inflatable head restraint after deployment mounting point was raised as high as possible with the con- fines of the maximum package height defined in Fig. 3. The configuration of the modified Phase II system following de- ployment is shown in Fig. 7, with a 5th percentile female dummy. Air Mat Inflatable Head Restraint System - An unusual con- cept in inflatable structures was brought to our attention late in the program, and because of the limited time available it was utilized without the benefit of much development. The basis for the unusual characteristics of this material, known as dropweave fabric, is the manner in which it is woven. Fig. 8 shows such a material in an unfinished form. The material is woven three-dimensionally with the tightly woven upper and lower surfaces forming fabrics and the dropwoven threads serving to tie the two surfaces together. When the sides of the material are sealed by bonding fabric to provide an air- tight system, the resulting structure is much stiffer in bending than a comparable baglike inflatable system, due to the three- dimensional nature of the dropweave fabric. A head restraint made of such a material offers the possibility of providing its own fore and aft stiffness, thereby eliminating the need for an auxiliary rigid stabilizing flap. The material can be woven into a variety of surface shapes, but most of the examples readily available were of a flat planar nature. Such an example was obtained from Goodyear Aero- space Corp. in the form of a 3-in thick, 10-in high, 20-in wide unit of their version of dropweave fabric called Air Mat. This unit was sealed and mounted by Goodyear onto a rigid mount- ing plate and was intended for preinflation testing only. The system was adapted to the seat structure, but it could not be</page><page sequence="7">DEPLOYABLE HEAD RESTRAINTS 2883 Fig. 8 - Typical dropweave fabric Fig. 9 - Air Mat inflatable head restraint configuration mounted as far forward as possible for the most effective use in limiting head motion. The mounted system is shown in Fig. 9. RIGID DEPLOYABLE HEAD RESTRAINT DESIGN - The design of a rigid sliding head restraint of the type shown schematically in Fig. 5 is basically quite straight-forward until consideration is given to a means of deploying such a device. Considerable time and effort was spent on evaluation of pos- sible sources of actuation of the system, the majority of which were based on types of piston and cylinder arrangements ac- tuated with compressed gas. It became evident that the re- quirements of a 20 ms deployment time ruled out conven- tional pneumatic devices. The use of springs was considered, but the requirements of force level and stroke were not com- patible with compact design. A device was located which pos- sessed characteristics similar to those necessary for the require- ments of the deployment device (that is, 20 ms response for a stroke of 10 in). The device was a drogue chute thruster man- ufactured by the Propellex Chemical Corp. for use with air- craft ejection seats. This unit is a limited stroke piston and cylinder arrangement that is powered pyrotechnically. It has an active stroke of 5.25 in and a nominal response time of 10 ms for that stroke when working against a mass of 8.75 lb. One of the units was purchased and the design of the remain- der of the head restraint was carried out around the require- ments of the thruster. The head restraint package consisted of an aluminum chan- nel support frame with steel guide rods at each side with the movable head restraint contained within the frame. The head restraint itself consisted of a horizontal rectangular steel tube with nylon bearings at each end and rising from the center of the horizontal member was a round steel tube tee which served as the load carrying member of the head restraint. The tubular steel tee was filled with balsa wood and covered with sheet aluminum to present a rectangular surface in front view. The thruster was mounted centrally to the aluminum frame and extended up into the vertical tube of steel tee. The up- per end of the thruster rested against a rubber plug interior to the tube which allowed the thruster to push against the head restraint to propel it upward, but it was not attached to the restraint so that the restraint could continue upward past the limited stroke of the thruster to reach its full upward motion of 10 in. The nylon-lined bearing surfaces at each end of the restraint guided the upward motion of the restraint along the guide rods. Steel tubing was used in the head restraint por- tion of the system in order to make the mass of the system close to the 8.75 lb design requirement of the thruster. It is obvious that an adequately stiff system could have been fab-</page><page sequence="8">2884 J. W. MELVIN, ET AL. Fig. 10 - Rigid sliding head restraint in predeployed test con- figuration with 95 th percentile male dummy ricated from lightweight metal that would have weighed in the 4.5 lb range if it were not for the particular mass requirement of the thruster. The front surface of the restraint was covered with a 2-in thick slab of 9 lb/ft"3 polyethylene open-celled foam for cushioning purposes. The mounted position of the rigid head restraint package is shown in its deployed configuration in Fig. 10. SEAT-HEAD RESTRAINT DESIGN CONSIDERA- TIONS - As noted in the computer simulation studies, the matching of seat back mechanical response and head restraint mechanical response is necessary for optimal performance of the system as a whole. The desired effect of this matching is to have the occupant move into and back out of the system with basically linear translation of the head, neck, and torso during a rear-end crash. The mechanical properties of the seat back cushioning material, the seat back structure, the head restraint mechanical properties, and the geometric place- ment of the restraint relative to the seat back all influence the final response of the system. The seat structure used in all of the tests in this program was designed as part of another DOT sponsored program on inter- grated restraint systems. It was constructed from 1-in square steel tubing welded in the configuration shown in Fig. 4. This structure is extremely strong and rigid when compared to con- ventional seat designs. A pan of thin sheet metal was attached to the frame to provide mounting for the seat back and seat bottom which consisted of 0.75 in plywood sheet covered with 1 in of Ensolite AH energy absorbing foam and then 1.5 in of soft sponge rubber for comfort. The entire cushioning composite was upholstered with a vinyl covering. The mount- ing of the head restraints to the seat was achieved by welding substructures to the basic seat frame. TEST, DEVELOPMENT, AND DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM The HSRI impact sled was used to simulate rear-end crashes of 20 mph, 60 mph, and 80 mph car to car closing velocities. For the case of a stationary car being struck in the rear by an identical weight car, these closing velocities correspond ap- proximately to the struck car undergoing velocity changes of 10 mph, 30 mph, and 40 mph, respectively. The nominal sled pulses used to simulate these conditions were 10 mph, ~10 G peak; 30 mph, M 8 G peak; and 40 mph, ~40 G peak. Typ- ical acceleration-time profiles for these three pulses are shown in Fig. 11. Also shown in Fig. 1 1 for comparison is a 55 mph crash profile (7). Note that the 30 mph sled pulse has higher acceleration than the car crash pulse in the time region from 25-75 ms. The consequence of this higher acceleration in the early portion of the pulse is to produce occupant kinematics of a somewhat more severe nature than would be the case in an actual rear-end collision. Thus, the sled tests taxed the capabilities of the head restraints to a greater extent than would a car crash with the same velocity change. TEST EQUIPMENT AND INSTRUMENTATION - Two sizes of anthropometric dummies were used in the test pro- gram; Sierra No. 292-895 95th percentile male, weight 217 lb, height 73.3 in, and Sierra No. 592-805 5th percentile female, weight 106 lb, height 59.8 in. Rubber necks designed and manufactured by General Motors were used in both dummies for all the tests. These necks were used primarily to minimize variations between tests due to the changes in neck behavior associated with adjustable ball and socket necks. Triaxial accelerometer packs were mounted in the dummy chests and heads. The accelerometers used in the packs were Kistler Piezotron Model 818. The photographic coverage of each test consisted of high-speed 16 mm movies (overhead and side views), a Graph-chek sequence camera side view for im- mediate photographic evaluation, and before and after test still photographs of the test setup. The high-speed movies were made with Photosonic cameras in some cases a Hi-Cam camera with nominal frame rates of 1000 fps. In those tests which required dynamic deployment, detona- tion of the device was accomplished by a set of electrical con- tacts that were actuated as the sled passed by them. The placement of the contacts was adjustable so that the timing of</page><page sequence="9">DEPLOYABLE HEAD RESTRAINTS 2885 w- í' i' "■ „ !

Fig. 11 - Typical sled acceleration pulses the detonation could be selected at any point during the sled pulse. The bag pressure readout in these tests was accom- plished using a strain-gaged diaphragm type pressure trans- ducer. In all tests the dummy was not restrained by any belts; however, loose tethering at the hip was used to limit excessive excursions. DATA HANDLING AND ANALYSIS - The data from the accelerometers were recorded directly on magnetic tape (Honey- well Model 7600 tape recorder) and a filtered version (Burr- Brown filters, SAE J21 1 channel class 180) was recorded on a Honeywell Model 1612 Visicorder light beam oscillograph. The Visicorder traces were used directly for data analysis. A careful and detailed photometric analysis was performed on the side view high-speed movie film of selected tests of par- ticular significance to the program. The basic measuring de- vice used in this work was the Vanguard film analyzer model M-l 60W. Four-place accuracy in linear and angular measure- ments is obtainable with this instrument. The linear and an- gular displacements of the target points on the head, neck, and shoulder of the dummy were measured every fifth frame (5 ms time increments). The film analyzer was coupled to an IBM 29 card punch unit and computer cards were automatically punched with the displacement data. Computer programs which have been developed to analyze photometric data at HSRI were used to compute head angular velocities and ac- celerations from the digitized displacement data by means of appropriate smoothing and filtering operations. The sign conventions for the accelerations of the dummies are as follows: 1 . Linear accelerations in the forward direction (toward the front for an occupant seated in a car) are positive. 2. Linear accelerations in the upward direction are positive. 3. Linear accelerations to the right are positive. 4. Forward angular accelerations are positive. In discussion of whiplash, the extension of the head-neck relative to the upper torso is of interest. Thus, when discus- sing extension in this report the extension angle will be de- noted as a positive quantity while flexion will be a negative quantity. Thus, angles between the head-neck and the upper torso rearward of the 0-deg line are positive, while angles for- ward of the 0-deg line are negative. Because of the difficulty in determining the exact angle of the upper torso segment dur- ing a test the angle of the seat back itself is used as the zero angle line. Because the seat structure used in all the tests was exceptionally stiff it is felt that this is a valid basis for analyz- ing the tests where the dummies contacted the seat back in a normal seated position. DISCUSSION OF TEST PROGRAM RESULTS This section discusses and analyzes in detail the pertinent features of the test development and demonstration program that are of particular significance to the development of dé- ployable head restraints. Test A-332 was a baseline test to evaluate the whiplash characteristics of the 95th percentile male dummy with a rub- ber neck interacting with the basic seat and déployable head restraint mounting structure. The data in Table 1 show that the head-neck extension was severe (+62.3 deg) in this 30 mph 14 G peak crash pulse even though the head restraint package served to limit further extension. Associated with the angular motions of the head were angular accelerations of close to 1000 rad/s^ in both the backward and forward modes as deter- mined by the results of photometric analysis. The angular ac- celeration peak in the forward mode is during the whiplash phase of the head motion and it is accompanied by the peak head accelerometer readings listed in Table 1 . The results of this baseline test will serve as a standard of comparison for the following head restraint tests. Note, how- ever, that this test had a slightly lower peak sled acceleration than the subsequent head restraint tests at 30 mph.</page><page sequence="10">2886 J. W. MELVIN, ET AL.

The results of this test were used as the basis for a develop- ment series of six preinflated head restraint tests. This series of tests established the necessity of fore and aft stabilization for proper system performance and also established inflation pressure requirements in the range of 7-15 psi for adequate bag stiffness. These tests also demonstrated the important role that the geometry of the front position of the head re- straint plays in minimizing ramping of the occupant up the seat back by pocketing the shoulders. PHASE II: INFLATABLE HEAD RESTRAINTS - Develop- ments of the Phase II inflatable head restraints system pro- ceeded in two phases, a series of preinflated tests followed by a series of dynamic deployment tests. The purpose of the first series of seven tests was to evaluate the effectiveness of the bag shape for both the 95th percentile male dummy and for the 5th percentile female dummy. Sys- tem performance was checked at both 10 and 30 mph sled velocities with 7 psi inflation pressures. The results were quite comparable to the previous tests with the larger cylindrical bag. The system's effectiveness was further tested by partic- ularly severe tests of 40 mph sled velocity to simulate advanced crush structure characteristics. Again the perfor- mance of the system was very satisfactory. The second series of six tests involved evaluation of dynam- ically deploying systems with realistic, state-of-the-art crash sensing time delays before deployment initiation. These tests proved the system to be highly effective in minimizing head motion with results that were even more satisfactory than the excellent results of the preinflated tests. The results of tests A-369 and A-370 are summarized in Table 1 . In these tests with the 5th percentile female dummy, the bag slapped the dummy's head during initial deployment causing a 50 G acceleration spike of 9 ms duration in the A-P direction. The bag slap also resulted in forward angular ac- celeration prior to the typical backward angular acceleration of a rear impact. It was evident from the high-speed movies of these tests that the bag was undergoing an oscillation in shape after inflation that was causing the dummy head to nod rapidly back and forth resulting in the pronounced oscillating of the traces of the linear and angular accelerations of the head. In spite of this nodding phenomenon, the peak angular 9 9 accelerations were 473 rad/s and 653 rad/s in the rearward direction for the 30 mph (A-369) and 40 mph (A-370) runs respectively. Except for the nodding, the motion of the 5th percentile female dummy was amazingly uneventful with the main motion being linear translation back into the seat and re- bound out. The rebound velocities of the dummy out of the seat were 1.1 mph and 2.5 mph for the 30 mph and 40 mph tests respectively, and the ramping of the dummy up the seat back was limited by the head restraint to 1 .33 in for the 30 mph test and 2.16 in for the 40 mph test. There was very lit- tle rotation of the dummy head during these tests and exten- sion did not occur at all as shown by the head angle plots in Figs. 18 and 21. The results of tests A-372 and A-373 using the 95th percen- tile male dummy are presented in Figs. 12-14 and in Table 1. Bag slap against the dummy was much less pronounced than with the female dummy and bag shape oscillations did not produce significant motions of the dummy head.

Fig. 14 - Visicorder traces of sled test A-372 mph test (A-373) the bag caused a slight forward rotation of the head prior to the normal rearward rotation. In these two tests the peak head angular accelerations were in the forward direction corresponding to the maximum rearward rotation of the head. The values of the peaks were 711 rad/s^ for test A-372 and 916 rad/s^ for test A-373. As in the tests with the female dummy no extension occurred. The peak head A-P accelerations were 32 G for the 30 mph test and 42 G for the 40 mph test. Photometric analysis was used to get the deflec- tion of the dummy head into the bag and the maximum de- flection was used to estimate the peak load on the dummy head at that deflection from experimental load-deflection re- lations previously determined for the head restraint bag. The values of maximum load on the head were converted to equiva- lent head A-P accelerations. These estimated values of head acceleration agree quite well with the dummy head accelero- meter readings thus indicating that the restraint bag is sup- porting the dummy head in such a manner that the forces at the neck are minimized. The rebounds of the dummy from the seat were more severe than with the female dummy but they were still quite acceptable, the forward velocity of the dummy shoulders being 4.4 mph in test A-372 and 5.3 mph in test A-373. Similarly, the ramping was slightly greater, 2.75 in and 3.9 in for tests A-372 and A-373, respectively. A useful measure for evaluating the degree of optimization of the head restraint design from the standpoint of head ac- celeration is to consider the ratio of peak head acceleration to peak sled acceleration. The resulting number is an amplifi- cation factor which ideally should be unity for a system which also minimizes occupant motion. Calculation of this factor for the case of the 5th percentile female dummy shows the system to be quite good at both the 30 mph test level (the ratio being 1 .05) and the 40 mph test level (the ratio being 1.13), whereas for the taller 95th percentile male dummy the system optimizes at the 40 mph level (the ratio being 1 .05) while at 30 mph the ratio is up at 1 .78. It is evident from these test results that the inflatable head restraints used in this study proved to be remarkably effective in preventing whiplash, and in addition their combination with the seat structure produced a highly effective means for gen- eral severe rear-end crash survival. Additional tests performed to evaluate the Phase II system performance in crash situations other than direct rear-end crashes were 22.5 deg oblique rear-end crash simulations and rebound of the dummy from a lap belt-shoulder harness com- bination during a frontal crash. The results of the 22.5 deg oblique rear-end crash simulation (A-376) showed that the bag was somewhat effective in pre- venting sideward motion of the head and shoulders although it did allow slight extension to occur. The head A-P accelera- tion was noticeably lower in this test than in the direct rear- ward crash simulations. The results of the frontal crash rebound test (A-379) were that the head restraint did arrest the motion of the dummy head; however, the dummy had achieved an extension angle of +30 deg prior to its contact with the bag. AIR MAT INFLATABLE HEAD RESTRAINT - In com- parison with the performance of the bag type head restraints with stabilizing flaps, the Air Mat head restraint system, as tested, was not very effective. However, judged on the basis that this system was the only one tested that offered the pos- sibility of producing adequate fore and aft stiffness without the need for additional rigid stabilizing structures, the results must be judged encouraging. There are several factors which must be taken into considera- tion when evaluating the performance of this particular sys- tem. Due to limited supply of the dropweave material and the fact that it could only be obtained in a planar form, the shape of the head restraint was less than ideal. The effect of the flat surface geometry was magnified by the necessity of mounting the restraint somewhat back from the plane of the seat back. These factors of poor shape and rearward offset of the re- straint combined to limit its performance by allowing signifi- cant rearward head motion prior to contact with the heat re- straint. As shown in Fig. 15, the restraint did not pocket the shoulders. Although head-neck extension occurred (Fig. 16) the restraint did limit it to the +30 deg level. The extension was accompanied by a 1500 rad/s angular acceleration peak in the forward mode and, as shown in Fig. 17, a head A-P ac- celeration peak of 33 G. The head restraint partially buckled at that time allowing the rearward motion to become even more excessive. The high value of angular acceleration demon- strates clearly the necessity to avoid large elastic deformations in restraint systems. RIGID DEPLOYABLE HEAD RESTRAINT - The dy- namic deployment test of the rigid sliding restraint system was performed in test A-371. The results of the analysis of this test are shown in Figs. 18-20. The drogue chute thruster was ignited at t = 27 ms and the system was fully deployed in 9 ms. The forces generated by the arrest of the upward mo- tion of the head restraint manifested themselves in a variety of ways. The cushioning material on the front face of the head restraint tore loose and continued to fly upward until it was trapped by the dummy head coming back on it. The arresting</page><page sequence="13">DEPLOYABLE HEAD RESTRAINTS 2889 Fig. 15 - Sequence photographs of Test A-349 (^25 ms between pictures) y y y * * Fr»€# An pts ~ / X / '/ ' 20" In / A ' X "* ~ « In A ' X X ~ « S ^ ' In / ' X X ä « 11»: ^ /' - ! 11»: *l' ' N ' - I Ii si V'' ' / / /' v- T " J I si 1 '/'! / '/'!

Fig. 20 - Visicorder traces of sled test A-371 system was similar to the predeployed test. The peak angular acceleration was 911 rad/s in the forward direction and ex- tension did not occur. The peak head A-P acceleration was 50 G, twice the sled peak acceleration. This amplification fac- tor was true for the predeployed test also; adjustment of the head restraint cushion properties could diminish the amplifica- tion somewhat. The restraint offered no significant pocketing effect, and the resulting ramping was 4.5 in. Upon rebound, the dummy tended to slide forward along the seat in a slouch- ing manner, resulting in virtually no forward motion of the shoulders. MALPOSITIONED OCCUPANT TESTS - Two malposi- tioned occupant tests were performed with the Phase II in- flatable head restraint system. These tests involved dynamic deployment of the restraint with the seat mounted in the in- terior of a stationary automobile. The first test involved a 50th percentile male dummy with its head lying back on the head restraint package prior to deployment and the second test involved a three-year old child dummy standing behind the seat with its head resting just above the head restraint package prior to deployment. The 50th percentile male dummy, used to simulate a sleep- ing occupant leaning back on the packaged head restraint, was fitted with a standard ball and socket neck rather than the rubber neck used in all the other tests. This was done to fa- cilitate the head placement of the dummy. Upon initiation of inflation, the dummy's head, which was in direct contact with the rigid stabilizing flap, received a severe head A-P accelera- tion spike of over 1 80 G for a duration of 8 ms and an accom- panying head S-I acceleration spike of 95 G. These high ac- celerations were due to the rigid nature of the stabilizing flap and the initial high-pressure peak of the inflator system. The high-pressure peak acting over the surface area of the rigid flap (4-3/4 X 18-3/4 in) produced the high forces that were trans- mitted against the dummy's head. Modification of the inflator pressure-time characteristics and elimination of the rigid flap through the use of a self-stiffening inflatable system would</page><page sequence="16">2892 J. w. MELVIN, ET AL. most likely minimize this type of malpositioned occupant prob- lem. In the case of the three-year old child dummy standing be- hind the seat, the rigid rotating stabilizing flap produced a sharp impact to the dummy's face upon inflation but the limited rearward motion of the flap was such that the dummy did not achieve an appreciable rearward velocity but instead, simply fell backward against the rear seat back ending up in a sitting position on the seat. The problem of the malpositioned child would appear to also be minimized by modifications of the inflator characteristics and elimination of the rigid stabili- zing flap. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The results of this study indicate that déployable head re- straints are technically feasible and that they can provide a general level of performance better than conventional fixed head restraints. The déployable head restraint can be pack- aged in such a manner as to allow the short driver to see over it for rearward vision and still be highly effective in providing head restraint for the tall driver. By virtue of the fact that the head restraint is in place only when needed in an accident sit- uation it can be placed much further forward than a fixed head restraint resulting in greatly reduced motion of the oc- cupant's head during a crash. The necessary forward place- ment of the head restraint is such that it would not impair the driver's ability to control the car following the crash and thus it can remain in place to guard against subsequent multiple collisions. Of the two basic types of deployment head restraint designs studied in this program, the inflatable systems seem to offer many advantages over rigid systems. Some of these advan- tages are compact packaging, low inertia during deployment, great latitude in final deployed shape, and ability to expand fore and aft while deploying vertically. These advantages are modified somewhat by the necessity for achieving adequate fore and aft stiffness in the inflatable systems. At this point in their development, bag-type inflatable head restraints were found to require a rigid rotating flap to provide the necessary stiffness. The possibility of utilizing self-stiffening inflatable structures, such as dropweave fabric, offers a means of over- coming this drawback. The inflatable déployable head restraint developed during this program proved to be extremely effective for both large and small occupants in crash simulations equivalent to car-to- car rear-end crash velocities of 20, 60, and 80 mph. The sys- tem was evaluated using criteria based on the following con- cepts: 1 . Minimization of both linear and rotational rearward head displacement. 2. Minimization of head linear and angular accelerations. 3. Minimization of differential motions of the head relative to the torso. 4. Minimization of occupant ramping up the seat back. 5. Minimization of occupant rebound. The overall effectiveness of the head restraint system depends greatly upon the effectiveness of the seat back structure it is mounted on and upon the extent to which their overall re- sponses are matched. The excellent results obtained in this program for the inflatable head restraint-seat combination demonstrate the value of well-matched components in pro- ducing uniform occupant motions and the value of minimizing elastic energy storage by utilizing a basically rigid load carrying seat structure. As an example of the performance of the total system, the input sled pulse of test A-373 (an 80 mph car-to-car equivalent velocity crash simulation with a peak acceleration of 40 G) produced in the 95th percentile male dummy a peak head A-P acceleration of 42 G, a peak head angular ac- celeration of 916 rad/s with a corresponding angular velocity peak of 16.8 rad/s with no head-neck extension. Comparison of these results with estimated human concussive tolerance values given by Ommaya (8) for head rotational motion of 1800 rad/s at 50 rad/s indicates levels below those believed to be tolerable. In contrast to the excellent performance of the head re- straint system, sensing of rear-end crashes poses problems in some cases. For crashes involving significant collapse of con- ventional car rear-end structures existing, inertial type crash sensors appear to be adequate. However, there are many low- speed collisions requiring head restraint where the acceleration levels overlap into the possible road noise range thereby ren- dering the inertial type crash sensor ineffective in discriminat- ing a crash from a road shock. In addition, the response of present inertial sensors may not be rapid enough for future square wave type crush structures. Incorporation of a sensor system into the design of rear energy-absorbing bumpers may offer a possible solution to rear-end crash sensing difficulties. Head restraints are effective in frontal crashes when occupant rebound occurs and therefore a déployable head restraint should also be activated during frontal crashes. This program has demonstrated the basic feasibility of dé- ployable head restraints; however, many areas of the subject are in need of further study. It is recommended that future studies on déployable head restraint concentrate on the fol- lowing items: 1 . Development of totally inflating systems with self-con- tained fore and aft stiffness. 2. Development of optimum inflatable head restraint shapes for oblique as well as direct rear-end impacts. 3. Development of new crash sensor concepts for sensing rear-end collisions. 4. Development of optimized inflation devices with charac- teristics that produce minimal effect on malpositioned occu- pants and minimal noise.
