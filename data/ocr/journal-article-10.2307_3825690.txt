Bicknell LESI,IE STEPHEN'S "ENGLISH THOUGHT IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY": A TRACT FOR THE TIMES N More Nineteenth Century Studies (London, 1956), Professor // Basil Willey hints that "we may say that Leslie Stephen ... wrote his English Thought in the Eighteenth Century in order to vindi- cate his own revolt from orthodoxy" (p. 132). May we say so? I raise the question, not to quarrel with Professor Willey, but to explore the reasons why Leslie Stephen undertook his magnum opus. The explora- tion will unearth, I hope, evidence which will throw light on Stephen as an intellectual historian and on the revival of interest in the eighteenth century among the Victorians. I Leslie Stephen was a pioneer in England of the theory that ideas reflect social history, and not vice versa. He is to Mill, Buckle, and Lecky as Marx is to Hegel. Where his rationalist predecessors stressed the primacy of ideas in determining the course of history, Stephen found the intellectual less significant than other forces in affecting the "progress of a system of thought." He explicitly turned their theory upside down: "The more closely we examine recent developments of opinion, the more, I believe, we shall be convinced that the immediate causes of DECEMBER 1962</page><page sequence="2">John W. Bicknell change are to be sought rather in social development than in the activity of a few speculative minds. A complete history of thought would there- fore have to take into account the social influences, as well as the logical bearing, of the varying phases of opinion."' Stephen's whole Introduction to English Thought is devoted to an exposition of the problems of intel- lectual history and includes the assertion that no explanation of eighteenth-century ideas could be complete that did not take into ac- count "the social conditions which determined their reception." He then proceeds to deflate the reader's expectations by announcing that he will not write his history according to this prescription, but rather will deal chiefly "with the logical conditions."2 In the second volume he sums up his method as follows: "My attention, even in discussing the specula- tive literature, has been chiefly confined to what I may call the logical relations of different intellectual creeds. I have considered the successive controversies as of a continuous debate, in which each writer starts from positions determined by the previous course of discussion. I have only referred incidentally to other conditions which, so to speak, dislocated the logical series" (II, 331). The summary is at once so accurate a description of his actual performance and so different from the proposal of the Introduction that we ask, why does Stephen tell us how intellectual history should be written and then follow another method? The question perhaps cannot be definitively answered without examining the manuscript of English Thought (but to the best of my knowledge, no manuscript exists). Such an examination might prove, for example, that the greater part of the text was written first and the Introduction last, indicating that when he began the book, Stephen's historical theory was nebulous and his prac- tice, therefore, uncertain; in short, that the gap between theory and practice which we find in the finished product is a result of the condi- tions under which it was written. A process somewhat as follows may have taken place: Stephen began (this is matter of fact) by making a study of the Deist movement. At the same time, he was observing and participating in the controversies of his day, and reading such philosophi- cal histories as were available. Both his observation of life and his his- torical studies gradually led him to formulate a theory of how intellec- tual history should be written. By the time this stage was reached, how- 1 English Thought in the Eighteenth Century, 3rd ed. (London, 1902), I, 13. 2 English Thought, I, 19.

Dunn from a 1903 photograph) ever, his book was almost finished, and the prospect of rewriting it in terms of his theory was too much to face. The process described above is admittedly hypothetical, but even if accurate, it only partly solves the problem before us. It does not ex- plain why Stephen, who had read Comte and had been impressed by his theory of history as an organic process, fails to present the history of eighteenth-century thought in such terms. Nor does it explain why so much of the book is devoted to exposing the fallacies of both sides of the Deist controversy, to arguing with the orthodox dogmas, and to analyzing in detail the logical position of each participant in the "con- tinuous debate." The solution of these larger problems must, it would seem, be approached by considering Stephen's attitude towards the eighteenth century, an attitude which, in turn, is intimately connected DECEMBER 1962 105</page><page sequence="4">John W. Bicknell with his position in relation to the problems of the nineteenth. To eluci- date this reciprocal relationship, however, will require a brief excursion. In accounting for Leslie Stephen's life-long preoccupation with eighteenth-century thought and literature, it is tempting to say, with Oliver Elton, that Stephen "was intellectually the child of the 'age of prose and reason'" and let the matter rest there.3 One can point to the fact that he combined the moral strictness of his Evangelical ancestors with the intellectual methods of John Stuart Mill. Or to complicate the genealogy, one can note that Stephen shares with Thackeray and others a propensity, also characteristic of eighteenth-century humorists, to ridi- cule the follies of his age. Vanity Fair, we are told, was the first book that Stephen bought for himself. He was even a successor to Thackeray in the editorial chair of the Cornhill Magazine. Moreover, the fact that Thackeray's daughter Marian became Stephen's first wife adds a Stra- cheyan piquance to the theory that Stephen was fated, by personal and intellectual inheritance, to be "the apostle of the eighteenth century."4 Such a theory, of course, is primarily a matter of rhetoric. To explain why Stephen buried himself among the dusty volumes of the English Deists we need something more than a literary device. Nor does this device suggest to us the obvious fact that in turning to the eighteenth century, Stephen was responding in his own way to the pressures of his age. For, when Stephen was writing his study of eighteenth-century thought, he was sharing with a number of his contemporaries an impulse to reconsider the death sentence passed by Carlyle on that "Bankrupt Century." It is worth noting that in reviewing Stephen's English Thought, both James Cotter Morison and John Hunt devoted their first paragraphs to observing that the condemnation of the eighteenth cen- tury by the Romantic movement was in the process of being modified. Morison remarks that the "eighteenth century is gradually receding into an historical perspective favourable to its calm and unbiased apprecia- tion. The deep obloquy which the great reaction called the Romantic movement had heaped upon it has sensibly diminished."5 Hunt is even more positive: "To abuse the eighteenth century has been the fashion for at least the last forty years. Nothing connected with it has been spared; its poetry, its metaphysics, its theology, and even its morality, have all had to endure the withering blasts of the men of this generation ... There are some signs of returning justice to this well-abused century, and one 3 A Survey of English Literature, 1830-1880 (London, 1920), I, 296. 4 Frederic Harrison, "Sir Leslie Stephen," Realities and Ideals (New York, 1908), p. 370. 5 "Leslie Stephen's History of English Thought," Macmillan's Magazine, XXV (1877), 326. VICTORIAN STUDIES 106</page><page sequence="5">LESLIE STEPHIEN S ENGLISH THOUGIHT of the most significant is the work which has just been written by Mr. Leslie Stephen."6 A list of more than a hundred studies and editions of eighteenth-century authors could be compiled to suggest the basis for these statements, or to indicate why Grant Allen, in reviewing Robert Louis Stevenson's Travels with a Donkey, was able to speak of it as one among many products of "the Queen Anne revival .. ., a phase of that reaction which is everywhere making itself felt against the formless solidity of the age wherein we live."7 Likewise in "The Study of Poetry" (188o), Matthew Arnold noted that "there are many signs to show that the eighteenth century and its judgments are coming into favor again,"8 and by 1887, Augustine Birrell could remark (somewhat prematurely one feels) that "we have left off beating the eighteenth century."9 In the same year Stephen observed with pleasure that "the folly of the fashion... of simply abusing the eighteenth century" was "now dying out."10 Such testimony probably does not justify us in speaking of a "Return to the Eighteenth Century" as we can speak of the Pre- Raphaelite movement. It does suggest, however, that we can take it as a fact that one of the distinguishing marks of the late-Victorian period was a revival of interest in the eighteenth century and a revision (if not a reversal) of the judgment passed on it by Carlyle and the Romantics. This change in taste does not seem to have been the result of a crusade by a self-appointed school of Queen Anne revivalists. The phenomenon has many facets - intellectual, artistic, and political - most of them neg- lected by Victorian scholarship. One aspect of the revival of the eighteenth century, however, has lent itself to coherent treatment, namely, that represented by John Morley and the "Fortnightly Circle." Taking a cue from J. B. Bury, we may speak of this group as the Neo-Encyclopedists.11 Their open attacks 6 "Mr. Leslie Stephen on English Thought in the Eighteenth Century," Contemporary Review, XXIX (1877), 410. 7 Fortnightly Review, n.s.

The movement has been studied from this point of view by Frances Knicker- DECEMBER 1962 107</page><page sequence="6">John W. Bicknell upon orthodoxy revived the spirit of Voltaire; their social idealism, the humanitarian impulses of a Condorcet or a Rousseau; their impassioned rationalism, the cerebral radicalism of a Bentham. As Frances Knicker- bocker observes, the eighteeenth century "had not really died. It had lived on in the little group of Benthamites and Radicals and in John Stuart Mill, who provided the link between the older radicalism and the new" (p. 130). John Morley's biographical studies of Condorcet, Voltaire, Turgot, Rousseau, and Diderot were conscious attempts to reinterpret the Encyclopedists "as champions of liberation and social justice," to create images of heroism inspirational to his fellow radicals, and to recover the ikons of radicalism from the dust heap where Carlyle had tossed them.12 No parade of citations is needed to show that Leslie Stephen shared the feelings of his closest friend and was an active ally in the attack on religious orthodoxy. One has only to read his Essays on Free- thinking and Plainspeaking (1873). It was natural, therefore, for him to review Morley's Voltaire (1872) with approval. Like Morley, he viewed the ideological conflicts of the eighteenth century as preliminary engagements for those of the nineteenth. Then, as in his own day, he felt, the orthodox had made unsuccessful attempts to hold together a collapsing structure. Speaking of the eighteenth-century habit of creat- ing patched-up systems of theology, he wrote: "Such a system of organ- ized hypocrisy is not healthful for the human kind, and its natural result was that coldness and artificiality which strikes us so painfully in the history of the eighteenth century. We always feel that we are walking, as it were, upon thin ice, and that, but for the most cautious and dexter- ous balancings, there is a continual danger of a sudden crash and an incalculable catastrophe..'3 Against this eighteenth-century version of his conception of the Broad Church, Stephen set the apostle of plain- speaking, Voltaire, who, though a skeptic, was not inclined "to the bocker, Free Minds: John Morley and his Friends (Harvard, 1943), and with more detailed scholarship by Edwin M. Everett, The Party of Humanity: The Fortnightly Review and Its Contributors, 1865-1874 (Chapel Hill, 1939), as well as in Professor Willey's essay on Morley cited above. 12 See, for example, Diderot (London, 1878), I, 8-9. Compare also Morison's review, "Many lines of thought and inquiry began in the eighteenth century, which the Ro- mantic movement brusquely and haughtily interrupted, have been resumed in modern times, and prosecuted with results too fruitful and tangible to be frowned down. Many of the most prominent and accepted investigators of the present day are manifestly continuing the work begun a hundred years ago, only with greater scope, mastery and precision which belong to more mature methods, and greater firmness of scientific grasp" (p. 326). 13 "Voltaire," Fraser's Magazine, n.s.

It is, after all, no small credit to any man to have been foremost in his day in waking the spirit of frank and fearless inquiry and the firm resolution to call things by their right names" (p. 690). Frances Knickerbocker argues (p. 133) that Stephen's interest in the eighteenth century was motivated by a nostalgia for a settled society, but her citation is from a late essay, and certainly nostalgia played a negligible role in the motives that led him, at the age of forty, to plunge into the theological controversies of the preceding century. Nor can we say with any confidence that he fell in love with the Age of Reason. His distaste for its "organized hypocrisy" contradicts any such conclusion. Vigorously engaged in the intellectual conflicts of his own time, he would more likely have agreed with William Stebbing that "it is the drama of the nineteenth century which is being rehearsed in the eighteenth. The players do not know their parts; the prompter's voice breaks the unity of the action; there is no audience but the company of the theatre; and the author seems to have not decided upon the denouement."'4 II We are now in a position to turn more directly to the questions posed at the beginning. Why is Stephen's English Thought so concerned with the logical rather than the sociological conditions that determined the course of eighteenth-century thought, and why does he devote so much space, particularly in the first volume, to a critical examination of the logical consistency of each thinker? An examination of the growth of the book itself provides us with some clues. Such evidence as can be found in Maitland and in the letters, though not extensive, is decisive in demonstrating that Stephen did not set out with the idea of writing a complete history of thought in the eighteenth century. When he first considered writing a magnum opus, he did not begin either with intellectual history or with the eighteenth century in mind. In the early 'sixties he planned a treatise on political economy, but this was abandoned. Soon after, when he settled down in London, his interests centered upon politics. "He sat himself down," writes Maitland, "with two schemes in his head. Ultimately there was to be a magnum opus ... on political philosophy, for the production of 14 "A Plea for the Eighteenth Century," Nineteenth Century, VI (1879), 1092. DECEMBER 1962 109</page><page sequence="8">John W. Bicknell which a long course of reading was planned."15 Though his article in Essays on Reform (1867) was the immediate product of this study, his serious reading led him further afield. Soon after 1865, "he tackled Spinoza and he tackled Hegel," Comte, Strauss, and Renan. "The annota- tor's projects," writes Maitland, "become less distinctly political. They tend towards the history of thought: especially towards the history of religious thought in modern times" (p. 172). His growing interest in re- ligious thought thus paralleled his entrance into contemporary religious controversies. He began, in 1868, with an essay on "Ritualism,"16 the first of a number of specimens of freethinking and plainspeaking. By 1871 his interest in religious thought had become dominant. Writing to his friend Holmes (4 Jan. 1871), he says, "[I] am settling down more or less to work at a book which I have long projected." This, Maitland asserts, eventually became Stephen's English Thought, but was "originally conceived as in the main a history of the Deistic movement" (pp. 224-225). That his study of the Deists was no labor of love may be inferred from his comment on them eighteen months later in the review of Morley's Voltaire already cited: "He [Voltaire] says in a thousand different ways ... what Collins and Tindal and Bolingbroke had said before him. They are forgotten and deservedly forgotten; nobody, Burke was able to say long ago, ever reads the works of the whole race who called themselves free-thinkers. And one reason is amply sufficient; namely that they are intolerably dull.... They may be fairly left to the dust and the moths" (p. 683). Why then, we are forced to wonder, did he bother to exhume the Deists at all? The only answer that seems plausible is that he saw them as being, in some respects, eighteenth-century analogues of nineteenth- century freethinkers, of whom he was one. It is certainly this point of view that led him, after another eighteen months of study, to defend eighteenth-century English philosophers against Taine. Countering Taine's contempt for Locke, Berkeley, and Hume, Stephen wrote, "What- ever their faults, they represented for the time the main current of the European movement of thought"; moreover, he added, they were the philosophical precursors of Mill, whom Taine admired.17 But Stephen did not stop with the great triumvirate. He defended the Deists, too, on 15 The Life and Letters of Leslie Stephen (London, 1906), p. 171. In a letter to Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. (7 Dec. 1866), Stephen speaks of his "great work on history, politics and philosophy" as "going to the dogs" (p. 188). 16 Macmillan's Magazine, XVII (1868), 479-494. 17 "Taine's History of English Literature," Fortnightly Review, n.s.

Moreover, Stephen was not alone in thinking that perhaps the Deists were worth another look. It is true, of course, that in 1790, Burke had dropped clods on their coffins by asking, "Who now reads Boling- broke? Who ever read him through?" Even in 1865 Lecky preserved the funereal atmosphere: "The shadow of the tomb rests upon [the Deists]," he intoned; "a deep unbroken silence, the chill of death surrounds them all. They have long since ceased to wake any interest, or to suggest any inquiries, or to impart any impulse to the intellect of England."18 It is also true that the Deists were looked down upon even by men of liberal, or at least rationalist, persuasion, perhaps because the latter were trained by men and books of the orthodox breed. The orthodox view was that the Deists were not only unpleasant and heretical, but ignorant. Even if rationalists might be disposed to sympathize with deistic criticisms of orthodoxy, they seem to have accepted the view of their instructors that the Deists were intellectually the inferiors of their opponents. Buckle, for example, thought that Toland, Tindal and Collins, Shaftesbury and Woolston were no match for Clarke, Warburton, and Lardner. "They could make no head till the time of Middleton."19 Lecky echoes this opinion in his assertion that of all the Deist works, only Middleton's Free Inquiry, Hume's Essay on Miracles, and Gibbon's corrosively ironic History merited anything more than antiquarian interest; moreover, he was convinced that the Deists had been driven from the field by the "evidential school" of orthodox antagonists (Rationalism, I, 166). The view represented in 1865 by Lecky, however, was far from accurate. The validity of his dismissal was as hollow as the pompous rhetoric with which he interred them. J. M. Robertson cites three English works on the Deists preceding Lecky: J. J. Tayler's Retrospect of the Religious Life of England (1845), A. S. Farrar's Critical History of Free Thought (1862),20 and Mark Pattison's "Tendencies of Religious Thought in England, 1688-1750," published in Essays and Reviews (186o), the essay which Stephen acknowledged (in his Preface to the 18 History of Rationalism, rev. ed. (New York, 1870), I, 190. 19 Miscellaneous Works (London, 1872), I, 202. 20 This was his published version of the Bampton Lectures of 1861. Farrar treats the English Deists as fairly as possible from the orthodox point of view (see pp. 116-162). His book, written with the aim of examining the role of free thought in history, is an attempt to counter Buckle's emphasis on the value of secular, as opposed to ecclesiasti- cal, thought. Dr. Farrar by no means thought that the impulse represented by Deism was dead; for his tastes, it was altogether too lively. DECEMBER 1962 111</page><page sequence="10">John W. Bicknell first edition) to have been the starting point of his inquiry. Lecky's burial of the Deists was also premature, for within the next fifteen years a num- ber of works appeared which indicated that the movement of thought represented by the Deists was still a live issue. In Germany, we may note Lange's Geschichte des Materialismus (1866; second edition, 1873-75), a book read among Stephen's acquaintances, and Gideon Spicker's Die Philosophie des Grafen von Shaftesbury (1872).21 In England, we may note the Rev. John Hunt's essays on Collins, Bolingbroke, and Hume, contributed to the Contemporary Review in 1869 and incorporated, along with a discussion of the ideas of the principal Deists, in his Religious Thought in England (1870-73); Stephen's English Thought ( 1876); and J. E. Cairnes' attack on the Deists in his Unbelief in the Eighteenth Century (1881). In France, interest in the Deist movement was exempli- fied by Edouard Sayous' Les Deistes anglais (1881). Renewed interest in the Deists was accompanied by a tendency to revaluate the traditional view of them. In England, the first departure from tradition was made by Mark Pattison. Throughout his essay Patti- son treated the Deists with respect, took their propositions seriously, and placed them on an intellectual level with their opponents. "The objec- tions urged against revelation in the course of the Deistical controversy," he wrote, "were no chimaeras of a sickly brain, but solid charges."22 Pattison's essay, therefore, is important as marking a shift in perspective, and Stephen's book, published sixteen years later, thus comes at a critical point in the historiography of English Deism. III The motives that led Stephen to rescue the old Deists from "the dust and the moths" may now be summed up. The Deists had taken up arms in the struggle which Stephen and his rationalist friends were carrying on among the Victorians. To show that the battle was no new one was to gain a perspective on the present; to show that the orthodox dogmas had been exploded in the last century, even without the ad- vantages of nineteenth-century science, was to demonstrate the im- 21 Stephen's essay, "Shaftesbury's Characteristics" (1873), contains a number of refer- ences to Spicker, as representing the influence of Shaftesbury on German thought. German interest in the Deists could also be represented by G. V. Lechler's Geschichte des Englischen Deismus (1841), which Stephen cites with approval in his Preface. 22 Essays and Reviews, p. 284. In his Memoirs (London, 1885), Pattison states that one motive for writing his essay was his dissatisfaction with the orthodox interpretation (p. 313). VICTORIAN STUDIES 112</page><page sequence="11">LESLIE STEPHEN S ENGLISH THOUGHT" mense folly of the Victorian proponents of orthodoxy. To show how Victorian divines were only repeating the compromises, the logical fal- lacies, and the ignorance of their eighteenth-century counterparts was to expose all the more effectively the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of the Church of England. Moreover, since the argument had been posed more bluntly in the Age of Anne than in the Age of Victoria, to examine it was to clarify the issues. In his essay on that eighteenth-century blunderbuss of orthodoxy, William Warburton,23 Stephen observes that Warburton accepted "a compromise characteristic of a certain stage of theological develop- ment," though in an exaggrated form. "Anyone who now disinters the half-decayed remnants of the English deistic controversy will frequently meet with the same phenomenon," he continues. "The arguments to be found in their writings are still familiar to us, though now generally disguised in a more pretentious phraseology and enforced by wider knowledge and superior methods of criticism." In losing the candor of our great-grandfathers, Stephen seems to be saying, we have not im- proved matters. "In those comparatively crude attempts to settle the vital problems of theology, whilst we find much that has become obsolete, we gain something by the absence of the more refined artifices employed by later artists in order to deceive the eye and dextrously soften harsh contrasts of opinion" (p. 317). Thus if Morley was conscious of an analogy between himself and the Encyclopedists, Stephen was equally conscious of the analogy between the warfare of science and theology of the nineteenth century and the warfare of reason and dogma in the eighteenth. This becomes clear when we examine, together with the essay on Warburton, his articles on Shaftesbury and Mandeville,24 all three being reprinted in Freethinking and Plainspeaking, and later in- corporated, though with important modifications, in his English Thought. In these three men, Stephen found "fair representatives of their typical forms of belief, each of which survives under different forms" (Free- thinking, pp. 317-318). In Warburton's theology, Stephen found the supreme example of the fallacy present in the belief that miracles were once possible, but that nature later came under the rule of law. The fallacy, Stephen thought, was very much alive in his own day. "It would be easy to show that the same fallacy prevails in most modern theology; and that men familiar with modern criticism still cover, under 23 Freethinking, pp. 274-325.

Bicknell philosophical language about the education of the race, a theory that the Divine government was somehow or other very different 2,ooo or 3,ooo years ago, from what it is now. The doctrine of catastrophes lingers in theology though it is being expelled from geology" (pp. 323-324). By contrast, he saw the aristocratic and optimistic Shaftesbury as the "Matthew Arnold of Queen Anne's reign," insisting on good taste, "a constant preacher of the advantages of sweetness and light" (p. 212). Shaftesbury he portrayed as a kind of advanced Broad Churchman attempting to save the structure of morality by throwing overboard "certain Jonahs in the shape of dogmatic divines" and by rendering "morality independent of the old theology" (pp. 224-225). In further defining Shaftesbury's position, Stephen elaborated the Broad Church analogy in some detail: "The writers who in that age correspond to the modern Broad Churchmen affected a kind of metaphysical theology. Clarke, the ablest rationalist among the clergy, formed his system from the fragments of DesCartes, Spinoza, and Leibnitz. Clarke occupied towards them the same position which Dean Mansel occupied towards German metaphysicians" (p. 222). And later on: Representing the objects of his [Shaftesbury's] enmity by modem names, we might compare him to a modem thinker who should be opposed to Mr. Mill's experiential philosophy, to Dean Mansel's adaptation of German metaphysics, to Dr. Newman's Catholicism, and to Mr. Spurgeon's Protestantism; who should agree with Bishop Colenso's attacks on the letter of the Bible, but think them painfully wanting in the breadth of view; and who should have been deeply influenced by the teaching of Coleridge, and yet have cast it off as too reactionary in spirit. Substitute for these names Locke, Clarke, Bossuet, the French prophets, Collins and Cudworth, and we have a very fair repetition of Shaftesbury's position. (p. 224) Though obviously Stephen used the analogy as a rhetorical device, it would never have occurred to him unless he had seen the two groups of thinkers as historically related. Moreover, in the context of Stephen's attack on Shaftesbury's enthusiastic optimism, the analogy becomes something more than a means of communication. By reducing moder conflicts to the level of those in the past, he obviously hoped to bring his audience closer to his own point of view. To find a precise Victorian analogue for Mandeville was more difficult. No one in Stephen's time (except perhaps Walter Bagehot, or Clough in "The Latest Decalogue") could equal in cynicism the author of The Fable of the Bees. His cynicism both attracted and repelled Stephen, who was delighted by Mandeville's plainspeaking and his paradoxes, and revolted by his crudity. If Stephen could find no Vic- torian Mandeville, however, he was able to discover that a number of the old cynic's ideas were still alive. Mandeville's famous paradox- "private vices, public benefits" - was still an active issue, as Stephen VICTORIAN STUDIES 114</page><page sequence="13">LESLIE STEPHEN'S "ENGLISH THOUGHT" thought, in some of the current arguments for unrestricted competition; nor was Mandeville's notion that "Religion is one thing and trade is another" a forgotten proverb. Moreover, with his usual acuteness, Stephen saw Mandeville's theory of morals as a forerunner of Bentham and the Utilitarians. "The 'Fable of the Bees,' in fact, contains in its crudest and most offensive form, the germ of what would now be called the derivative theory of morality" (pp. 266-267). Most interesting, Stephen thought, was Mandeville's reasoning ... in its application to society. It is curious to find the very questions which now cause the bitterest discussions cropping up ... in the pages of Mandevile and Shaftesbury. . .. Shaftesbury, like Mr. Disraeli, is plainly 'on the side of the angels,' and would have taunted Mr. Huxley with his great-grandfather the ape. Mandevile replies in the spirit, and sometimes with the very arguments, of a modern believer in natural selection.... [In Mandeville] the one great fact which we discover by observation is that which we have lately learned to call the struggle for existence. (pp. 270-272) The comparisons go even further. Stephen linked Mandeville's theory that religion originated in anthropomorphism with that of Comte. Mandeville, it appears, was also an evolutionist. His belief that the origin and development of society was the product of a long empirical process, not the sudden artifice of a creator, had a familiar ring. The dress rather than the substance is altered. Mandeville had not heard of Mr. Darwin's struggle for existence; he had not studied Mr. Tylor's investigations of savage life; he knew nothing of Malthus's laws of population or of Ricardo's analysis of the operations of modem competition. But the theory of the world which underlies his speculations, and the method for which it gives foundation, is pretty nearly iden- tical. The world is the scene of a huge struggle of units driven by conflicting passions, and their mutual pressure gives for its final result all those complex social and intel- lectual products which others attribute to providential interference.... The histori- cal cause may be discovered; the final cause is inscrutable. The modem man of science and the old reckless cynic agree in the resolution to look facts in the face. (pp. 273-274) Mandeville is on the side of modernity; "his method is sound, though his spirit is detestable" (p. 277). It is perfectly true that Stephen deleted these particular analogies and contemporary references from his treatment of Warburton, Shaftes- bury, and Mandeville when he reworked these passages from Free- thinking and Plainspeaking for English Thought. It is equally true that English Thought was written with these analogies in mind. Our com- prehension of that book is measurably widened when we see it as grow- ing out of the context of Victorian religious controversy. The knowledge that Stephen thought of Conyers Middleton as "the Essayist and Re- viewer of that day" (Freethinking, p. 282) is indispensable for our un- derstanding of the motives that sent him back among the old volumes of DECEMBER 1962 115</page><page sequence="14">John W. Bicknell forgotten Deists. Taken together with the passages cited above, such a fact enables us to see Stephen's history of eighteenth-century thought as an engagement in the nineteenth-century struggle for free thought. By projecting the terms of that struggle into the preceding century, he was obviously taking sides, seeking out allies and disposing of enemies. Even his deletion of these overt references to the nineteenth century could not conceal the partly conscious, partly unconscious ten- dency of his book. His predilections, of course, were well known by 1876. But aside from this fact, the anti-theological tone that pervades English Thought could not escape the eyes of the orthodox reviewers. John Hunt, after designating Stephen as a "dogmatic unbeliever," turns his review in the Contemporary into a debate over the arguments for the existence of God. He treats Stephen's book as a direct assault on ortho- doxy (in which he was not far wrong) and attempts to repel it. He found in it not only distressingly frivolous language applied to things sacred, but also a distinct partiality for infidels. Hume is "Mr. Stephen's hero" and (inaccurately) Butler is his "rock of offense." Clearly, the differ- ences between author and reviewer were over first principles. As Hunt knew, no one could rise from a reading of Stephen's first volume with neutral feelings toward eighteenth-century, and by implication, nine- teenth-century theology. As might be expected, the Catholic Dublin Review was even more sensitive to Stephen's bias.25 Shrewdly, the anonymous reviewer saw a comparison between Stephen and the eighteenth-century French thinkers: We may, perhaps, venture to say that he thinks of doing a service to his own cause [Agnosticism] by presenting some views of the past which have hitherto escaped notice. Everyone remembers how the "philosophers" of the eighteenth century did not choose to write up their doctrines, as others had done, by formal treatise and disquisition, but in imitation of Bayle, kept on publishing histories, memoirs, biographies, and above all, dictionaries of general information, from behind which they fought as though defended by an entrenchment. (p. 550) Suggesting that Stephen was using a similar device, the reviewer went on to say that "the entire two volumes are an application of the sceptical doubt to philosophy, religion, ethics, political economy, poetry, litera- ture, and social phenomena in general." Though forced to praise the "excellence of various passages," the outraged reviewer declared that Stephen deserved "a place on the moral Index as another of the con- temporary prophets who are preaching death and not life, despair of 25 "Mr. Leslie Stephen's History of Thought in the Eighteenth Century," Dublin Review, n.s.

Principal Librarian to the University of Cambridge (from Miscellaneous Works, 1752) good, and a careless temper towards evil" (p. 551). The description of Stephen as being careless toward evil and despairing of good is unfair; but one could hardly quarrel with the reviewer's appreciation of the fact that he was dealing with an ideological enemy. IV There is, however, an even more profound reason for Stephen's interest in the outcome of the Deist controversy and in the subsequent development of English thought. Free Thought and Rationalism, after all, had not captured the minds and imaginations of the great majority of Englishmen in the eighteenth century. Instead, Methodism had DECEMBER 1962 117</page><page sequence="16">John W. Bicknell triumphed, winning a victory that Stephen could hardly view with any satisfaction. It was an object lesson that nineteenth-century Rationalists might well consider. Granted that modem science had sapped the foundations of the traditional theology, what creed was to be offered in its place? What system of belief could the Rationalists put forward that could be counted on to evoke the response of the majority? Unless this difficult problem could be solved, Stephen feared that the hopes for a new belief, based on science and reason, might well collapse. The hearts of the majority must be won, or the cause of reason would be certainly delayed and possibly defeated. For, "when the ancient creed no longer satisfies the aspirations of mankind, the philosopher has his chance, and too often fails to turn it to account. For the value of his creed will be tested, not by pure logic, but by trying its efficacy upon men's minds and hearts."26 Some of Stephen's Positivist friends attempted to solve this prob- lem by adopting Comte's "Religion of Humanity," but neither Stephen nor any large group of Englishmen showed any disposition to worship at the shrine of Le Grand £tre, or for that matter to offer prayers to Herbert Spencer's "Unknowable." Unlike Arnold, who wished to sal- vage the Christian myth even though the fact had failed, Stephen wanted to supplant it, but he feared that a rational-scientific approach to life might not be able to command the emotional fervor that had rallied to Christianity. "The new order," he wrote, "constructed by the reason, remains colourless and uninteresting, because the old associa- tions have not yet gathered round it" (English Thought, I, 14). Unless philosophical liberals could make vital contact with the masses of men, leadership might pass to "some powerful wielder of imaginative sym- bols." Reason would be driven to the wall or back to the study.27 The extent to which Stephen deals with this problem, not only in his Introduction, but throughout the two volumes of English Thought, convinces one that he was searching for the cause of the failure of the eighteenth-century rationalist movement in England, in the hope of preventing a similar failure in his own time. At the end of the first chapter he asks, "What creed could sway the passionate yearnings and the dumb instincts of the multitude? Could Hume's scepticism fill the 26 English Thought, I, 18. John Morley was also acutely conscious of this problem. See his Voltaire, 4th ed. (London, 1882), pp. 199-201. 27 That Stephen's fears were more than justified may well be gathered by recalling the skill with which Disraeli managed to envelop imperialism in Evangelical emotionalism. His bill to make Queen Victoria Empress of India was introduced into Parliament in the same year that Stephen published his English Thought.

That was the vital question, the answer to which would govern the development of popular opinion" (I, 72). Why did Wesley win the support of the masses? This was the vital question, the answer to which, while necessary for an understand- ing of the eighteenth century, could not be ignored by Stephen's con- temporaries. To Stephen, the collapse of the rationalist movement in a welter of Methodism and Evangelicalism was perhaps a warning to his own generation that they could not count on the alleged efficacy of pure reason to fulfill their hopes, and that they could not, as many did, preach a doctrine of "sheer optimism," that "least vigorous of all beliefs." To do so would cut them off from contact with the masses, whose fears, as well as hopes, must be embodied in any creed that hoped to win their allegiance. From the history of thought in the eighteenth century, he and his rationalist friends might learn that "the power of [a] doctrine is tested, we may say, by feeling and acting rather than by reasoning.... And though one condition of its power is that it should satisfy the keenest intellects, it is also a condition of its full vigour that the enthu- siasm of the leaders should be reflected and intensified by their less intelligent followers" (I, 18-19). Stephen's English Thought is thus marked by two motifs: first, his attack on theological views which, asserted with vigor in the eighteenth century, had lived on into the nineteenth; second, his ac- count of the rationalist advance among the elite and its failure to attract followers, that is, of its superficial success and essential failure. To- gether, these motifs mark Stephen's deep involvement in the outcome of the philosophical conflicts he portrayed. Though Maitland ascribes Stephen's tendency to deprecate the role of the Deists to his desire to be impartial (Maitland, p. 282), it is important to note that his im- partiality is not that of a detached observer, but rather that of a man who is so concerned for the triumph of rationalism that he insists on exposing, sometimes all too zealously, the errors of allies, as well as those of enemies. He cannot allow the logical fallacies of the Deists to go unnoticed; their deficiencies in argument and knowledge must be compensated for, in order to leave no vantage point for the defenders of orthodoxy. A sense of kinship with the freethinkers of the eighteenth century is mingled with an irritation at their inconsistencies, their in- competence, their lack of education, and their dullness. What might appear to be impartiality is really a desire to argue with both sides. No logical fallacy, committed either by Bishop or freethinker, could be left DECEMBER 1962 119</page><page sequence="18">John W. Bickndel unremarked. All arguments for ontology, regardless of their origin, must be analyzed and refuted. Thus the gap between Stephen's theory of intellectual history and his practice of it, as manifested in English Thought, now permits of some explanation. Its inception as a study of the Deists and its growth by slow accretion provide us with a partial solution. But this process itself is determined by the fact that the study of the Deists was stimulated by the controversies in which Stephen was engaged. The need to score debating points against his contemporaries transferred itself to the historical inquiry; logical analysis displaced, though it did not completely eliminate, discussion of the social conditions which, he believed, caused ideas to flourish or decline. His deep involvement in the issues also explains why his treatment of the Deists has been open to attack by such critics as J. M. Robertson and Norman Torrey,28 who claim that he does not give the Deists their due. He is so exasperated by what he repeatedly calls their "shallow optimism" that he cannot pro- nounce an impartial verdict. Years later, in his Literature and Society in the Eighteenth Century (1904, see pp. 106-108), he was to render a more reasoned judgment, but by then the air had cleared somewhat. In 1876, however, the air was heavy with controversy, and contemporary optimists needed chastisement by way of their Augustan analogues. It is notable that while David Hume is the obvious hero of English Thought, Bishop Butler, of all people, gets special praise because, while theologically unsound, he faced the facts of suffering and evil and did not attempt to wish them away. The attempt to explain the gap between Stephen's theory and his practice thus leads us back to the original question. English Thought is unquestionably, as Professor Willey says of Morley's French studies, a tract for the times, but in more complex ways than the term "vindicate" would suggest and in more respects than demonstrated here. It is indeed a notable document in the history of Victorian rationalism, a manifes- tation of a search for a usable past, and a striking example of the attempt to restore a credit balance for Carlyle's bankrupt century.
