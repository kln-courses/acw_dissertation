By JAMES DREVER. THE main object of this paper is to clear up the sense in which the word " consciousness " must be employed and understood by the psychologist, and incidentally to point out how this sense affects certain important philosophical and psychological pro- blems, with reference to which there has been, and is, somewhat acute controversy. The main contention of the paper can be put very briefly and at the outset of the discussion. It is this: consciousness is not an entity, but merely a character belonging to certain phenomena of life, and the starting-point of the psycho- logist is not consciousness, or even conscious process, but the behaviour of the living organism. The second of these statements may seem at once to label the writer " behaviourist." Possibly; but do not let us be over-hasty in our judgment. There are few professed psycholo- gists at the present time who are not prepared to accept the definition of psychology as the science which studies the behaviour of the living organism and attempts to understand and interpret that behaviour from the standpoint, and in terms, of the inner conscious life of the organism. If that is behaviourism, then we are practically all behaviourists together.</page><page sequence="2">140 JAMES DREVER. What do we mean by the " behaviour of the living organism ?" So long as an organism is living-it ceases to be an organism when it dies-it exhibits behaviour. From a certain point of view behaviour might be held to cover all its activities. Theoreti- cally, however, its activities can be classified under two heads: (1),those activities concerned in the carrying on of vital fnmetions, that is to say, those functions-digestion and the like-that are involved in the maintenance of its life; and (2), those activities that are concerned in the carrying out of adaptive functions- functions involved in its adaptation to environing conditions. What we call the behaviour of the organism covers more par- ticularly those activities belonging to the second group. Just as the physiological basis of an organism's digestive functions is its digestive system, so the physiological basis of its adaptive functions is its psycho-organic system. Where such a system is differentiated in the structure of the organism it consists of three parts, a part immediately concerned in making the adaptive response, a part concerned in receiving the stimuli from the external situation in the environment towards which the response is made, and a part connecting these two. Each part consists of cells specialized for its particular function, receptor cells specialized for receiving different kinds of stimulus-the sense organs-effector cells for making different kinds and forms of response-the muscles and glands-connecting cells by means of which waves of excitation may pass from the one to the other- the neurones of the nervous system. The adaptive functions of the organism begin with the reception of the stimulus. Hence regarded from its physiological side, the behaviour of the organism begins with the activity of the receptor cells. In these cells physiological processes are initiated by the stimuli from without- speaking of the usual case-and there is physiological continuity between such processes and the processes in the effector cells, upon which the observable external behaviour of the organism</page><page sequence="3">THE NATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS. 141 depends. The physiologist's analytical account of behaviour would describe the physiological processes in the receptor cells, in the neurones, and in the effector cells. Even for the physio- logist the total response of the organism is obviously not confined to the activity of the muscles and glands. Whether the activity be explicit or implicit, to use Watson's phraseology, the response of the organism begins with the processes in the receptor cells. But the behaviour of the living organism as such it is not the physiologist's business to study. His task begins and ends with the functioning of the individual mechanisms. I do not wish to put the discussion on a metaphysical basis, at least at its present stage. The argument can be pursued on a purely biological basis. The biologist, even with a bias in favour of physiological explanation, is forced to confess that he cannot explain or understand the behaviour of the living organism in terms of the functioning of physiological mechanisms, whatever measure of continuity he may be able to trace. We have each of us a unique opportunity of knowing one living organism directly and intimately. We have, as it were, an inside view of the behaviour of one living organism. In and through this inside view we know that the total response of the organism, beginning with the physiological processes in the receptor cells, involves conscious processes, and that it can only be understood as behaviour in terms of these very processes. This is where the psychologist comes in with respect to the study of the behaviour of the living organism. The processes we designate conscious are phases of the total response of the organism, and essential phases. They are as much phases of the response as are the actions observable by all, or the physio- logical processes observed by the physiologist. And if the behaviour is to be understood as behaviour, it is only through, and in terms of them that it can be understood.</page><page sequence="4">142 JAMES DREVER. It will be at once objected by certain scientists, and by certain philosophers also, that the point of view of biological science, and of all science, is necessarily objective, and that conscious processes cannot be observed from an objective point of view. Overt actions and physiological processes constitute behaviour, so far as it can be objectively observed, in the human being as in the lowest organism. The existence of conscious process is not denied as the inner aspect of behaviour, but the scientific study of behaviour must exclude that aspect. Hence there is either no science of psychology at all, or psychology must confine itself to the description of behaviour as it can be objectively observed, and abandon the practice of interpreting behaviour in terms of conscious process. We may pause a moment to consider this objection. The first and main part of it' appears to rest on a misconception. Let us imagine an observer capable of observing the behaviour of the human being in all its phases, inclusive of the conscious processes involved. Such a hypothetical observer could evidently realize the ideal of science, because for him the whole fact would be an objective fact. Hence, so far as we can approach the point of view of such an observer, so far do we approach the ideal of science in the study of human behaviour. Now this is the point of view which the psychology of the present is tending more and more to substitute for the subjective point of view of the older introspective psychology. Conscious process is itself regarded, as it were, objectively, and described as it would appear from the point of view of ou-r hypothetical observer. It is regarded and described as a unique type of integration or syn- thesis, integrating or synthesizing the life forces of the organism and the factors ex-ternal to these forces by which they are con- ditioned. But it is important to remember that this does not involve the abandonment of introspection as a psychological method.</page><page sequence="5">THE NATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS. 143 Nothing can ever take the place of introspection, because not only is conscious process a unique type of integration, but it is also unique in another respect-it implies, and is, an inside view of the event. Just because conscious process is an inside view of the event, introspection can furnish us with relevant information, obtainable in no other way, concerning the behaviour of one living organism. We are thus enabled to utilize the results of introspection in a science of psychology, which has advanced from the purely descriptive to the explanatory stage, and advanced along the lines of biological science rather than of speculative philosophy. Let me put explicitly and succinctly this central position at which we have arrived. "Consciousness" is a character belong- ing to certain processes in the living organism. These processes. with other processes of a different order-physical, chemical, and physiological-constitute the organism's behaviour. The key to the understanding of the behaviour, however, we find in the conscious processes alone. Hence the need for a science of psychology. The character " consciousness " may be described objectively as an integration of internal and external factors- internal and external as far as life itself, in the concrete, is concerned. In its essential nature it implies also an inside view of the eveit-the event being, as we have seen, an essential phase or aspect of an organism's behaviour. Let us see next how certain controversies of the day look from this standpoint. We shall be introduced to the first of these controversies by considering how this standpoint is related to the standpoints of the pure introspectionist and the extreme behaviourist respectively, and in what respects it is more satis- factory than either. Both of these current types of psychological standpoint perpetuate, though in different ways and directions, the distinction made fundamental for modern philosophical thought by Descartes, between mind as a thinking substance</page><page sequence="6">144 JAMES DREVER. and body as that which is extended. The introspectionist, carrying on the direct line of development from Descartes, through the psychology of the 18th century, tends to oppose the subject-matter of his science, as inner, subjective, and directly apprehended, to the subject-matter of the physical and natural sciences, as objective, and to be conceived as existing inde- pendentlyof the experience in and throughwhich it is apprehended. He regards it as the province of psychology, therefore, to describe only the inner or subjective aspect of behaviour-the " enjoy- ment " which accompanies, or is correlated with, the behaviour. The extreme behaviourist, starting from the standpoint of the physical and natural sciences, accepting that standpoint as laid down for these sciences, and taking the introspectionist at his own valuation, urges that this psychology is to-day an anachronism, that what the man in the street and the biologist are primarily concerned with is behaviour, and, since this can be studied objectively, that the true scientific psychology is the study of behaviour without any reference to the inner aspect whatsoever. The result of the clash of these two points of view has been most unfortunate for biology. Animal behaviour has been conceived in a narrow and artificial way. As a direct consequence biological phenomena have been crushed into a mould adapted for the physical sciences, and facts which refused to conform to such a mould have been simply hacked off and ignored. In fine, the application of what I will venture to call a false logic of science has made it impossible for biology to describe, to discuss, or to understand the behaviour of the living organism in any complete sense. The only course open to the biologist appears to be to return to the whole fact as he finds it, and frankly to adopt that point of view, and that method of procedure, which will enable him to deal with. the whole fact. The first step towards this would seem to be the adoption of that view of conscious process which has been advocated.</page><page sequence="7">THE NATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS. 145 At -this point, however, the extreme behaviourist's objection may take a new, and, superficially regarded, a more cogent form. Admitting. that animal behaviour has an inner aspect, he may argue that this aspect necessarily remains unknown to us except so far as we can interpret it from our own experience, and the validity of such interpretation becomes less and less the farther removed the animal organism, with which we are dealing, is from the human being. Is it not obvious then, he may say, that when we are dealing with the. behaviour of the lower organisms, and possibly when we are dealing with the behaviour of organisms fairly high up the scale, the danger involved in the interpretation of the inner aspect of behaviour on the basis of human experience far outweighs any assistance we may hope to derive from such interpretation ? I venture to maintain that, with the proper safeguards, this is not the case. Further, without such interpretation the biologist has on his hands an indeter- minate x which he is unable to interpret at all, and which on his own showing is of first-rate importance for any useful inter- pretation. Thus several students of the behaviour of lower organisms-Jennings, Heron-Allen, and others-have to confess that many facts and phenomena can be best described and characterized in psychological terms. With proper safeguards, what possible objection can there be to the employment of psychological terms in such cases, if the facts warrant and demand them ? Of course it is contended that to employ them would be simply anthropomorphism, and not. scientific. But anthropomorphism is the naive reading of the unanalysed man into the brute or the inanimate object. This that. we propose is not anthropomorphism. Even if it were, anthropomorphism .would be more hopeful than "hylo- morphism." for the -understanding of the behaviour. of- a living organism. It is surely incumbent on the scientist who makes such an objection to show why in this particular case the only</page><page sequence="8">146 JAMES DREVER. line of evidence which is of value must be excluded. Further, he ought to show this without an appeal to the analogy of the physical sciences. The analogy begs the whole question. Leaving now biology, let us pass on to philosophy. If we take psychology as the science which studies the behaviour of the living organism and attempts to understand this behaviour in terms of the inner conscious life, is it not clear, it may be asked, that a fundamental problem for psychology will arise in connexion with the relation of external behaviour to this inner conscious life ? In the past this problem has led over almost inevitably into the problem of the relation of body and mind, and what at the outset was ostensibly a psychological problem has passed over into a metaphysical problem, upon which the solution of the psychological problem is made dependent. As far as the science of psychology is concerned, this must be written off as a dead loss. So much so, that modern psychologists tend to fight shy of the problem altogether. Now it must be freely granted that the relation of body and mind does not present a problem for psychology. The psychologist as such recognizes neither body nor mind as concrete entities; his concrete entity is the living organism. The reason why the apparent psychological problem came to be discussed as a metaphysical problem is fairly obvious. The living organism was conceived as " body " plus " mind." Or perhaps we should say, the human being was so conceived, for the human being was until comparatively recently the sole centre of interest for psychology. This naive dualism was not challenged at its origin but only in its metaphysical issues. At its origin, however, it is clearly as baseless as it is naive. The concrete fact, for science and for philosophy alike, is not a union in some incomprehensible way of two separate entities, a " body " and a " mind." The concrete fact is the living organism, externally observable as a body with other bodi,es in space, but sharply</page><page sequence="9">THE NATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS. 147 differentiated in various ways from other bodies which are life- less, and internally observable, in the case of the human being, by each individual in, through, and to the limits of his own ex- perience or conscious process. The living organisni, as observed fronm the outside, is not a bodv in the sense in which body is opposed to mind, nor, observed from the inside, is it a mind in the sense in which mind is opposed to body. In fact, neither the mind nor the body, opposed to one another, has any existence save as an abstraction. All this is so obvious from the modern psychological standpoint that we cannot help wondering how other views could ever have prevailed. A glance, however, at some of the older text-books of psychology makes everything clear as daylight. Psychology is defined as the science which studies conscious process. Conscious process is a real process, or event, or fact. But conscious process refers beyond itself to that of which we are conscious. Thus two different orders of fact are involved. We see a tree. The seeing is a fact in the universe, as is also the tree. Psychology is concerned with the first, which is known directly. But it must apparently show how this fact is related to the second fact which is known in- directly through the first. The psychophysical problem imme- diately emerges. Even though it is evidently an epistemological problem, rather than a psychological one, the psychologist feels it incumbent upon him to discuss it with reference to what he takes-but takes wrongly-to be his psychological data. But a question has been asked which is not yet disposed of. The setting aside of the problem of the relation of body and mind, as not being a psychological problem, by no means divests the psychologist of his responsibility with regard to this question regarding the relation between the phenomena of the inner conscious life, which each individual knows directly in himself, but cannot know directly except in himself. and the external behaviour which is open to the observation of the world. The 5</page><page sequence="10">148 JAMES DREVER. psychologist, starting with the behaviour of the living organism, escapes the epistemological pitfall with the interminable contro- versies to which. it is the entrance. That is so much gained. The view of consciousness wvhich has been advanced carries us even farther. The behaviour of the living organism is its total response at any. moment to the various factors or conditions affecting its own life activities, to what we call a situation. There is still a dualism-living organism and situation-but it is a biological or psychological, not an epistemological or meta- physical, dualism, and moreover it represents ultimate fact, so far as the psychologist is concerned. At that point his world end.s. The behaviour with which lie starts necessarily involves organism and situation; take away either and there is no behaviour. But this dualism is resolved in conscious process itself, as integrative. And between conscious process and external behaviour there is no dualism. Both are aspects of one concrete fact. The consciousness is simply the inner or inside view of the event. Some other points are deserving of notice. "Consciousness being taken in the sense assigned, the question may be asked: is there a psychological " unconscious," and if so, what is its nature ? The answer is that there is a psychological " un- conscious," but it is of a different order from the psychological ' conscious." Conscious process is a real process or event; the " unconscious " in psycchology is a conceptual construction for explanatory purposes. An organism's behaviour and con- scious processes may be regarded as determined on the one side by environmental factors and configurations-situations. But they are also determined by inner factors and con.figurations, of which the physiologist caIn only give a partial account, and sometimes not even that. If we speak provisionally of the sum total of the conscious processes constituting an individual's experience as his mental life, then we should say that conscious</page><page sequence="11">THE NATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS. 149 processes are conditionied by inner factors of the kind designated "dispositions " in recent psychology. Interests, prejudices, complexes, might be cited as illustrations. These are parts or elements of the make-ul) or structuire of the organism, on what, from our provisional point of view, we are calling the mental side. Without reference to these we cannot explain the course taken by the mental life and the behaviour in any particular case. They are the concern of the psychologist. They are not conscious. Hence we should include them in the psychological " unconscious." It is at any rate certain that the physiologist can give no account of them, and that they are not even necessary for his explanation of events, so far as it goes, whereas they are necessary for the psychologist's explanation. But there are also processes which, in the meantime at least, must be included under the head of the psychological " un- conscious." Freud, you will remember, speaks of processes in -the unconscious which from their nature can never become conlscious. There can be no doubt whatever that we must assume such in order to explain events. We must assume interaction betweeil the structural elemnents jiist noted. One common case of such interaction is seen in the operation of associative bonds. But this is onlv a special case. The living organism is a unity. HIence any modification taking place in any individual cell in tlhe living organism must affect the activity of every other cell to a areater or less extent. We can frequentlv trace the effects in the phlysiological sphere. Similarly the elements of an ilndividual's mental make-up, whether we regard them as neural or mental struetures, must be regarded as parts of the structure of a living organism. As such they caninot but interact with one another, inhibiting, facilitating, modifying the influence of one another. Again we can trace the effects, this time in the psycho- logical sphere. When a strong love sentiment develops-and as it develops-it profoundly modifies not merely the behaviour</page><page sequence="12">150 JAMES DREVER. of the individual, but his whole attitude towards the object, and sometimes to other objects also, in ways that can onily be explained in terms of the psychological " unconscious." In conclusion, permit me to say that I believe the points which I have raised, particularly with regard to the psychological meaning of " consciousness," are of importance, not only to the science of psychology itself, but also to epistemology anid to philosophy generally. Whatever structures we rear on an analysis of this or that conscious process must be prepared to meet a challenge based on the nature of consciousness as a character of the concrete fact or event.</page></plain_text>
