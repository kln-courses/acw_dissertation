<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTICES OF BOOKS nator he compiles 32 examples of structures which span the period in question. Pt. 2 of the book is taken up with a chronological survey of this material. In spite of arguments for the diachronic similarity of such build- ings, there is relatively little archaeological evidence for them before the second half of the fifth century. The two early examples mustered belong to the Archaic period and involve quite thorough reinterpretations upon identifications proposed by the original excavators. The earliest, located along the southwest comer of the agora at Megara Hyblaea, was known by the excavators nondescriptly as 'batiment i'. K. identifies the structure as a megale oikia with two other features essential for the type: a courtyard and banqueting installation. When turning to the southwest corer of the archaic Athenian Agora, Buildings F, C, and D (below the later Tholos and Bouletaria) become a double courtyard house with appended banquet building. Although unified into a sprawling whole, K. also disassociates the compound with the one family who might have seemed responsible for it, the Peisistratids, with whom Building F has frequently (if only hopefully) been connected. Appropriate examples of the megale oikia from late Archaic to high Classical are thus far completely lacking in the archaeological record, although they can be accounted for from written sources. It is from the late Classical and Hellenistic worlds that many such dwell- ings have been explored. No-one will argue that fine examples of grandiose houses cannot be found at Eretria, Morgantina, Pella, and a number of other sites. It is these which make up 30 of the 32 examples identified. Pts. 3-5 deal with a variety of issues: the changing character from banqueting to multi-purpose reception rooms, the deliberate segregation of agricultural and industrial installations from the realm of the wealthy household, construction expenditures and property values, as well as the range of ideals of both domestic luxury and extravagance portrayed in literature. Although K.'s corpus of the megale oikia was surveyed in Pt. 2, Pt. 6 (re-)presents the material in the form of regional type-histories (gaps from late sixth to fourth century Athens being filled with examples drawn from written sources). One conjectures whether the integration of Pts. 2 and 6 would have been possible, even advisable. Following a concluding summary of his major points in Pt. 7, a systematic catalogue of the 32 big houses is presented in Pt. 8. In addition, seven houses from Olynthus are appended as Pt. 9. The inclusion of these latter structures point up the weaknesses in both K.'s method and theory. While appointed with the trappings of the megale oikia, the Olynthus examples fall short of the size criterion for full inclusion. An exception is made, however, as K. proposes the North Hill settlement resulting from a synoicism of 432 to have been occupied exclusively by the well-to-do drawn from the surround- ing territory, with everyone else remaining at the port of Mecybera, on the land, or on the South Hill. The North Hill houses are, he states, 'large urban houses conceived on a small scale' (200). Few will have followed his arguments this far without protest. While K. has not excluded the mikra oikia from consideration (he discusses and illustrates a number in order to make his points), the line between large and rich, and everything else, is so emphatically drawn that little room is left to explore the array of nuance pro- vided by the full spectrum of domestic architecture and the circumstances of its inhabitants. It seems to this reader that the most important contribution of Megale Oikia is its initial motivating observation: that it is in the private and semi-public domestic realms rather than the arena of temples or other civic monuments that the language of style develops and becomes codified. This is as provocative (to many ears) as it is significant. It remains but one of the numerous provocations and compelling hypotheses submitted for consideration in this work. B.A. AULT S. U.N. Y at Buffalo/Vassar College SPIVEY (N.) Understanding Greek sculpture. Ancient meanings, modern readings. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1996. Pp. 240. ?28. 0500237107. Nigel Spivey's aim is to take a fresh look at such familiar problems in Greek sculpture as the emergence of the classical style, the contribution of the famous sculptors admired by the Greeks and Romans, the setting and religious function of statuary, Athenian sculpture in the fifth century, female nudity, patronage by states other than democracies, and afterlife. He subscribes, however, to the post-modernist view that all personal statements are valid even when they do not fulfil scholarly requirements. Since the scholarly apparatus in the field is negated and virtually ignored, the book ends up reinventing the wheel. The unwary can easily miss the point that many of the conclusions, far from being new, echo those of the establishment that S. has set out to attack. New directions in the study of Greek sculpture are enriching the field thanks to the examination of art in its historical background on the one hand, and the detection of provenance of materials on the other, opening up new perspectives in our perception of trade and the movement of sculptors. Although the author is aware of the historical trend in sculpture studies, he misses out on the technical. No doubt his point of view reflects his own perspective and is therefore true in a post-modern sense. However, realists can still question the validity of points of view not supported by a firm knowledge of facts. S. tries to be provocative by, among other things, an eccentric use of terms for familiar things: 'gryphon' for griffin, 'Kritian Boy' (without the definite article) for the Kritios Boy. Old, discarded restorations are illustrated without comment, e.g. the old restoration in the Olympia Museum of the east pediment of the temple of Zeus (fig. 12), and Cockerell's nineteenth century drawings of the pediments of the Temple of Aphaia (figs. 73-74). Nothing is said about the recent, more authoritative restorations, Herrmann's of the east pediment of Olym- pia (H.-V. Herrmann, Olympia [Munich 1973] fig. 96b) and Ohly's of the pediments of Aphaia, installed in the Munich Glyptothek in the period 1962-65. The Introduc- tion draws a parallel between Byzantium and the modern age on the grounds that both eras have lost the original meaning of classical sculpture. To compare the attitudes of a totalitarian theocracy of the Middle Ages with those 245</page><page sequence="2">NOTICES OF BOOKS of the agnostic, democratic West of our time is truly original. The assertion of the 'death of the sculptor' beats at a dead horse: the preoccupation with the famous masters of antiquity became unfashionable long ago. Such studies now require special pleading, as indeed was the case with Personal styles in Greek sculpture - (Cambridge 1996) edited by the reviewer and J.J. Pollitt, an effort scorned elsewhere by S. Ch. 2, The Greek Revolution, incorporates the views of such well-known modern commentators as Goethe and Winckelmann, but to imply that Winckelmann and his contemporaries could date Greek inscriptions by letter-forms (24) is absurd. The birth of the classical style is associated, among other things, with the emerg- ence of democracy: a mere glance at dates shows that Athenian democracy was born in 508 BC, whereas the classical style appeared only after the repulsion of the Persians in 480. Only ignorance of standard practice in the citizenry of classical Athens can make S. wonder why patronymics are cited in dedicatory inscriptions on the Athenian Acropolis (22). S. is careless with dates throughout: dates of sculptures as given in the text differ from those in the captions. The Laocoon is assigned to the first century BC (35) and the first century AD (cap- tion to fig. 15). The Piraeus Apollo is dated to 510 (47) and to 530-520 (fig. 21: it is in fact a long time since anyone dated the Apollo so high). The Caryatid from Pulcher's Lesser Propylaia at Eleusis, dated by an inscription to the mid-first century BC, is inexplicably assigned to the second century AD (fig. 46). The Lesser Panathenaia was not a biennial (36) but an annual event. Krisis kallous is a beauty contest, not a 'battle of the beautiful' (36). Ch. 3, Daedalus and the Wings of Techne, tries to be original by discussing the origins of Greek monumental stone sculpture without mentioning Egypt. They are traced instead to a Bronze Age tradition of wooden statuary of which nothing survives. The discussion of sculptural techniques betrays unfamiliarity with work- shop and quarry. To describe the claw chisel as a tool for cutting granite (55) demonstrates total ignorance of the hard nature of that stone and of stone carving techniques. Typoi are reliefs, not models (70). Far from deploring the vulgarity of the colours on the Mausoleum (76), Charles Newton in fact praised them (cf. I. Jenkins, Archaeologists and Aesthetes [London 1992] 185). A more sober tone is maintained in Ch. 4, Sacred Decoration, a survey of sculptures created by piety. But the Eirene and Ploutos did not stand on the Areopagos (91) and the archaic master of animals from Naukratis (fig. 69) is not holding a leg of mutton (103). Ch. 5, Heroes Apparent, is based on an idiosyncratic interpreta- tion of Greek heroes as the heroised dead. As no distinction is made between votive reliefs and statue bases, funerary monuments and dedications in sanctu- aries, this makes interesting reading. The group of Kleobis and Biton from the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi is not a funerary monument (figs. 76-77). The 'votive slab' on the Acropolis with pyrrhic dancers (111) is in fact a statue base (now fully published by A. Kosmopoulou in K.J. Hartswick and M.C. Sturgeon (eds.), ITEDANOI. Studies in honor of B.S. Ridgway (1998) 163-72). Dexileos did not die in Nemea (119) but in Corinth, as stated in the inscription clearly visible in fig. 85. The fragmentary relief in the Ashmolean Museum (fig. 87) does not show a family offering a pig sacrifice to a tomb but to a deity, probably Asklepios. Ch. 6, From Marathon to the Parthenon, would have been a useful account of Athenian monuments commem- orating the victory at Marathon and of the Periklean building programme had it not shown such blatant disregard for facts. Boedromion was not the name of the festival commemorating Marathon (126) but of the month in which it was held. The Demosion sema is not a suburb of Athens (127). The Marathon trophy (133-34) has been on display in the Marathon Museum for some time. The sword of Mardonios was not exhibited in the Parthenon (133) but the Erechtheion (Paus. 1.27.1). That neither the sculptors of the Parthenon pediments nor their patrons knew what kind of iconographic program- me they were following (144) is an idea worthy of this book. One suspects that the author has not seen the sculptures he is discussing, hence his description of the Nike temple parapet as representations of Athena erecting trophies and leading bulls to sacrifice in the company of Nikai (150). And he believes that the Erechtheion frieze was a continuous relief frieze (163), whereas every undergraduate knows that it consists of individual figures carved separately and attached to a background of dark Eleusinian limestone. Ironically, after announcing the death of the sculptor in the Introduction, S. admits the existence of Pheidias in Ch. 7 (In Search of Pheidias), and provides an account of his life and works. This and Ch. 4 are the best in the book. The captions of figs. 107 and 108 are nevertheless transposed. Ch. 8, Revealing Aphrodite, deals with the 'invention' of the female nude by Praxit- eles and its aftermath. S. tends to concentrate on the sexual aspects of Aphrodite, neglecting her political significance, especially in Athens, where she was credited with the unification of Attica under Theseus. Not her earliest (176) but her latest cult statues showed her armed (cf. J. Flemberg, Venus Armata [Stockholm 1991]). King Nikomedes who offered to buy the Knidia did not rule Kos (178) but Bithynia. In explanation of fig. 114 after Carrey's drawing of the west pediment of the Parthenon with a naked boy (S) sitting on the lap of his mother (T), S. resurrects the discarded nineteenth century identification of naked Aphrodite on the lap of the Sea (181). The title of Ch. 9, The Patronage of Kings, is slightly misleading since it begins with the fourth century satraps of Asia Minor and includes the Colossus of Rhodes, commissioned by the city of Rhodes. It deals mainly with the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, the Nereid Monument, Alexander's portraiture and the patronage of the Attalids of Pergamon. Far from being a non-Greek subject (189), the Colossus represented Helios, one of the principal deities of the island, also shown on Rhodian coins. Ch. 10, Graecia capta, concentrates on Roman and European attitudes to Greek art and European collecting. The battle of the Nile was in 1798, not 1801 (226). Stuart and Revett published The antiquities of Athens, not Athenian antiquities (226). The Duveen Gallery in the British Museum (227) was completed in 1939 and only opened in 1962. Not even the excavators of Vergina would claim that the site has produced crucial materials for the history of Greek sculpture (231). 246</page><page sequence="3">NOTICES OF BOOKS It is a pity that the author of a textbook on Greek sculpture can ignore specialists in the field, provided that the opinions of art historians and literary historians, particularly those slightly out-of-date, as well as of German philosophers of the Enlightenment, are quoted and discussed. Accuracy is not a requirement and statements are written from memory without checking facts at any stage. A textbook thus littered with inaccur- acies can be original enough to represent the post- modernist view of a well-worn topic, especially when packaged by a respectable publisher. Caveat lector. The quest for originality at all costs, the conclusions drawn on the basis of out-of-date information, and the cavalier treatment of facts can damage your health. OLGA PALAGIA University of Athens KYRIELEIS (H.) Der Grosse Kuros von Samos. (Deut- sches Archaologisches Institut: Samos 10). Bonn: Habelt, 1996. Pp. xi + 130, 48 pl. DM 110. 377492- 7715. Kyrieleis's eagerly-awaited publication of the great Ischys kouros from Samos does not disappoint. Lucid and thorough, it offers perceptive studies of the statue's date, style, inscription sources, and meaning. Forty-eight excellent black-and-white plates present differently-lit views and comparanda ranging from Naukratite statu- ettes to Egyptian pharaohs. In the 1920s Buschor found fragments of two colossi at the Heraion, including one huge pair of thighs and another thigh bearing Ischys's inscription. K. takes up the story with his unearthing of Ischys's giant headless torso in 1980, which joined the inscribed thigh and more of Buschor's fragments, and of the lucky discovery of its face in 1984. Next, its base, c. 5.25 m. (10 Samian cubits) square, is discussed by H. Kienast. K. then describes the kouros itself. Close observation reveals that it twists slightly on its axis: hips to the right, following the stride, and chest to the left. Subtler differences pervade the individual muscles and features. K. refrains from placing all this within the overarching schemes proposed by Kleemann and others, but given the thrust of his later chapters, he will be pleased to know that in Egyptian Sculpture of the Late Period, Bernard Bothmer observed similar distortions there too. Paint traces and uneven weathering betray a once thoroughgoing polychromy. Patches of now-blackened pigment on the thigh and elsewhere show that the body was once entirely coloured, presum- ably with a red-brown tan to hide the marble's striking blue veins that so delight many a moder viewer. Painted details included ornamentally-trimmed pubic hair, rosette-shaped nipples, and annular irises; the lips and eyebrows were presumably painted too, and a line above the upper lip suggests a moustache. K. argues that the sculptor's grid was based on the Samian cubit of 52.5 cm (derived from the Egyptian royal cubit: Hdt. 2.168). Though the feet are lost, he estimates the figure's height at 9 1/6 cubits, rounding this up to 10 by restoring an (also lost) plinth, and thus inscribing statue and base into a 10-cubit square. Yet the grid's lack of correlation with some major anatomical features (the nipples, for example, fall in the middle of a square) counsels caution, as does the fact that Eleanor Guralnick has recently proposed another, entirely different grid with about the same degree of anatomical correlation (AA [1996] 502-26). After an excursus by G. Neumann on the inscription (translated as 'Ischys dedicated [me/it], son of Rhesis'), K. turns to the statue's style and date. He places it around 590, somewhat earlier than usual, and contem- porary with the Sounion-Dipylon workshop and the Twins in Delphi. Its relocation to the beginning of Samian marble sculpture only complicates the question of origins (61). Where and how did its sculptor lear his trade? A fragmentary kore from the Heraion in Naxian marble and style suggests Naxos or at least the Cyclad- es, which had been producing such statues for a gener- ation. Yet though our man may have learned his tools there, he betrays none of the sub-Daedalic bias of contemporary Cycladic or mainland style, and seventh century Samian Kleinkunst is too formless to provide an alternative. So K. looks to Egypt, where he finds parallels for the hair, knees, arms, and some other features in Dynasties XII, XIX-XX, XXV-XXVI, and on kouroi from Naukr- atis. The Sesostris and Ramses colossi at Tanis and Memphis, at least, were still visible around 600, and K. believes that our sculptor must have seen them. But did he do more? K. argues that he did. Repeating his previously- published view that kouroi are fundamentally heroic, or at least exemplify heroic-style arete, he proposes that since heroes were supposedly huge (10 cubits on one estimate), a colossus like Ischys's probably portrayed one. (Although no inscribed kouros names a hero, the force of local tradition would have made this unnecess- ary.) And since it is unlikely that some kouroi were generic and some not, all were probably specific (97). Then comes the boldest thrust of all. This concept itself is Egyptian, for the Greeks who went to fight, trade, and tour in XXVIth Dynasty Egypt would have been struck not by Egyptian figure types per se, still less by knees and elbows, but by the Egyptian conception of the anthropomorphic stone colossus as Monument (110). They identified its subjects-Cheops, Sesostris, and so on-as the Egyptian equivalents of the heroes (115). Yet, despite borrowing concept, grid, scale, and some ana- tomical details, the kouros remains essentially Greek, a form appropriated and transformed, not slavishly repro- duced. So just as R.M. Cook occupies one corer of the Greece-Egypt controversy ('Origins of Greek sculpture', JHS 87 [1967] 24-32), K. stands resolutely in the other-and will no doubt soon take his knocks as well. Though my precis does scant justice to his wide-ranging and subtle thesis, sceptics will challenge his comparanda (he omits Phoenicia and Assyria, where the face of Ischys's kouros seems more at home); his mechanisms of transmission (exports? tourism? apprenticeships in Egyptian workshops?); and his interpretation of the kouros itself (contrast e.g., Sourvinou-Inwood's nuanced discussion of it as sema in Reading Greek Death). And what of the assumption that one can have it both ways, that an object can be thoroughly Greek despite such a parcel of borrowings? For-as a perceptive student from 247</page></plain_text>
