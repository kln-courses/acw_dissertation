<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOURNAL OF THE Galway Archaeological and Historical Society VOL 33^ 1972.73 ~~ ~~ An Archaeological Survey of Temple Brecan, Aran JOHN WADDELL The ecclesiastical site known as Teampall Bhreacdin^ anglicised Temple Brecan, is a small complex of churches, and other buildings and monuments, situated in the townland of Onaght, two kilometres north-west of the village of Kilmurvy on Inishmore.1 It lies below the great stone fort of Dun Onaght, in the shelter of a low cliff some two-hundred metres from the sea-shore. Some of its monuments have been briefly described, mainly by the nineteenth century writers mentioned below, but no detailed description of the site as a whole has so far been published. The purpose of the present survey, undertaken in April, 1972, by the author and other staff and students of the Department of Archaeology, University College, Galway, was to provide such an account. Little is known about the Saint Brecan after whom the site as a whole, as well as the larger church, is named; he may have been its founder or it may simply have been dedicated to him. He may have been a contemporary of the sixth-century Saint Enda of Aran.2 There is only one other church at Temple Brecan, but, in spite of this, the site has, for many years, been popularly called na Seacht Teampaill or 'the Seven Churches'. Macalister has, with customary vigour, refuted the use of this name here (and elsewhere); it is based, as he points out, on 'the ridiculous assumption that the Seven Churches of the Apocalypse are thereby represented in symbol'.3 Ordnance Survey six-inch sheet No. 110, 36 cm. from western margin, 40 cm. from southern margin.

Clare and Ardbraccan, Co. Meath. 8 Macalister, The Archaeology of Ireland (1928), p. 251.</page><page sequence="2">n3/ North Croso P \ /)(mS\ BhroocoUi %^ ^* ^ \\ % 'A uoi m\ % .

A general plan of the site (Fig, 1) shows how the various domestic buildings, which are all of late date, and groups of earlier monuments, cluster about the principal church (G), the greater portion of which is also late. The apparently haphazard plan shows no hint of medieval monastic order and seems to echo that of the early laura. There is no certain trace of any original enclosing wall. The present wall which surrounds the site was constructed by the Board of Works, when it tidied up the area, in the latter quarter of the nineteenth century. It incorporates what remains of the rear walls of buildings A, D, and E, and then runs southwards, incorporating the wall fragments and gateway marked on the plan beside cross-slab (3), to terminate at the low cliff which abuts on the east wall of Teampall an Phoill. Only the wall fragments marked on the plan to the west of Temple Brecan are ancient, and their function, to judge from the position of the gates, was simply to enclose Leaba an Spioraid Naoimh and Leaba Bhreacdin* These wall fragments may be as late in date as the fifteenth or sixteenth century; the western gate has a simple flat slab lintel.5 The eastern gate is of similar construction internally, but externally has a two-piece, round-headed arch, which resembles, in its construc tion the doorway of Building H (see below); the adjoining portion of wall is crenellated. TEMPLE BRECAN The largest building on the site is the Church of Saint Brecan (Fig. 1, G). It is in a good state of preservation and was apparently only slightly, and judiciously, restored by the Board of Works.6 The present structure (Fig. 2) consists of nave and chancel, and is of various dates. The earliest remains are to be seen in the north and west walls. A small rectangular church of massive, limestone, masonry with gable antae, and, presumably, a doorway in its south wall, was apparently the earliest stone structure here; it certainly pre-dated the thirteenth century, and could very possibly have been several centuries earlier. It would appear that sometime in the thirteenth century the east and south walls of this small church were removed, and a wider and longer building, substantially the same as that which survives today, was constructed. Only one of the old gable antae, that at the north-west corner, survives; it measures 84 cm. in width and projects 19 cm. The difference between the masonry of the old church and that of the new is clearly visible externally and internally (Plate I); most notable is the difference in the size of the limestone blocks: one large *Leaba may mean 'bed' or 'grave': See Contributions to a dictionary of the Irish Language (Roya Irish Academy), sv. lepaid. 6 A sketch of this gate has been published by Westropp, JRSAI, 25 (1895), 255.

Inscribed stone: OR[6lT] AR 11 CANOIN. i i 4 * stone in the old north wall measures no less than 1 m. 25 cm. in length and 74 cm. in height. Internally, measured from the north-west corner, some 7 m. 40 cm. of the north wall and 4 m. 20 cm. of the west wall, including portion of the gable to a height of approximately 4 m., belong to the original church. In the interior, in the original west wall, at a height of about 2 m. from the ground, the edge of a slab, 1 m. 18 cm. long, bears the incised inscription OR[6lT] AR II CANOIN (A prayer for two canons) (Plate 1, Fig. 3; No. (1) on plan). The inscription is carved on a raised band some 53 cm. long. George Petrie, who first published the stone, hazarded a guess that it might have some connection with the canons after whom the church of Kilcanonagh on Inishmean is presumably named.7 The enlarged church is a rectangular nave and chancel structure, measuring inter nally 16 m. 90 cm. in length and 5 m. 60 cm. in width. It is divided by a chancel arch into a nave and chancel which are, somewhat unusually, of the same width. In the north wall of the nave there is a triangular-headed niche 53 cm. wide and 91 cm. high. Most writers, including O'Donovan8 and Dunraven,9 have described it as a window, and it is possible that they may be correct. However, the plate in Dunraven, which illustrates the exterior of the north wall before the Board of Works restoration,10 shows some collapse at this point but no external indication of a triangular-headed opening. It was restored as a niche and may, in fact, always have been such; it is, after all, only some 50 cm. above present ground level. The chancel arch (Plate II) is neatly constructed of small well-fitting limestone voussoirs averaging some 15 cm. in width; its span is 2 m. 96 cm. and its maximum height 3 m. 20 cm. Both the piers and the soffit are chamfered, so too are the lower 7 Petrie, Christian Inscriptions in the Irish Language, Vol. II (1878), p. 21, PL XIV, fig. 29. 8 O'Donovan, Ordnance Survey Letters, Co.

Two pairs of narrow grooved lines, now very worn ,were cut on the upper edge of each impost and on the upper edge of their chamfers and produce the effect of very nanow and almost imperceptible mouldings at these points.11 In the nave, at the junction of north wall and chancel arch, there is a small rectangular niche 1 m. 15 cm. above ground level, it measures 27 cm. in width, 34 cm. in height, and is 23 cm. deep. The plain, slender, lancet window in the east gable is typically Transitional (Fig. 2; Plate II); its overall height is 3 m. 48 cm., the height of the light is 2 m. and its width is about 17 cm., it narrows slightly from base to top. The internal splay has a maximum width of 1 m. 43 cm. Below this window is a later altar of limestone blocks, its top a single, chamfered, limestone slab 2 m. long and 94 cm. wide. On either side of the altar, in each corner, there is a rectangular niche some 60 cm. above estimated ground level, measuring respectively 63 cm. high, 50 cm. deep, 11 On the eastern face of the southern impost there are traces, now quite faint, of oblique incised lines between the pairs of grooved lines. 9 1 1 BC^HC=3m 7 " 1 J[ 1 Li Fig. 4.

A similar niche, 40 cm. high, 40 cm. deep, 50 cm. wide, occurs in the north wall of the chancel. The window in the south wall is narrow, round-headed, and chamfered, with a deep internal splay of 1 m. 37 cm.; the single light, which is 1 m. 22 cm. high and 14 cm. wide at its base, narrows slightly towards the top. The head is a single stone, ornamented with an anthemion or palmette device in a triangular pediment sur mounted by scroll-work (Plate III).12 On either side of the window, a single grooved line descends vertically from the basal corners of the pediment towards the base of the window. This Transitional church probably dates to the thirteenth century. Modifications after this date are relatively minor and may be ascribed to approximately the fifteenth or sixteenth century. The altar, already mentioned, the window and doorway in the south wall of the nave, and the partition-wall at the west end of the nave, all probably belong to this phase. The single light nave window is incomplete ,only portion of the jambs survive; they are hollow-chamfered; externally the window has a maximum width of 26 cm. The doorway is a plain, round-headed, chamfered structure, 70 cm. wide jamb to jamb, and 1 m. 78 cm. high; its internal splay is 1 m. wide and some what asymmetrical. At the base of the western chamfer there is a small carving in relief of a cross on a pyramidal base, it measures only 13.5 cm. high (Fig. 10:7). At the west end of the nave, the remains of a partition wall evidently post-date the Transitional church and are presumed to be of later Medieval date. Only one course of this wall, which averages 70 cm. in width, survives on the northern side; on the southern side, however, it survives to a height of 2 m. 20 cm., and some SS cm. above ground there is a small slab-built compartment in the thickness of the wall. This box-like compartment measures 1 m. 5 cm. in length, 56 cm. in height and 46 cm. in width, and may have been used for the storage of valuables. The gables of the church bear dressed coping stones, some possibly replaced by the Board of Works; the average height of the gables is 6 m. 50 cm. TEAMPALL AN PHOILL The second church on the site lies to the south-west of Temple Brecan (Fig. I, J). In 1645, Dr. Malactuas Quaelaeus (Malachy 6 Cadhla), Archbishop of Tuam, noted the existence of this church 'quae vulgo Tempull a' Phuill appellatur\n and the name has usually been translated 'Church of the Hollow'. It is a simple, rectangular, gabled building (Fig. 4; Plate IV) of mortared limestone masonry; some large blocks have been used in its construction, one, in the north wall measures 1 m. 65 cm. in length and 1 m. in height. In length, internally, the church measures 7 m. 85 cm. and in width 4m. 10 cm. There is a narrow, plain, chamfered, trefoil-headed single-light in the east 11A rubbing of this ornament has been published by Crawford, JRSAI, 53 (1923), 100. u Colgan, Acta Sanctorum . . .

The door way is in the north wall and is very simply constructed of four stones: two unchamfered jambs and two stones forming a pointed arch; it is 84 cm. wide with an asymmetrical internal splay of lm. 9 cm. The proportions of this door, and those of the doors of Buildings C and H are virtually the same. There are the headless remains of a small, narrow, window in the north wall, the surviving jambs are chamfered and 16.5 cm. apart; it has an internal splay equal, in its maximum width, to that of the door. There is a niche in the south wall at a height of 1 m. 18 cm. from the present ground level, it measures 60 cm. in width, 43 cm. in height, and 54 cm. in depth. DOMESTIC BUILDINGS There are the visible remains of eight other buildings at Temple Brecan which may be at least tentatively included in this category. They cluster about the main church and are lettered A-E and H-I on the general plan (Fig. 1). The northernmost, Building A, is a simple rectangular structure of mortared limestone masonry measuring inter nally 12 m. 20 cm. in length, and 4 m. 90 cm. in width. Only the walls on the south, west and east survive (to a maximum height of lm. 40 cm.); only a few of the stones of the north wall remain, it has been incorporated into the nineteenth century enclosure wall. There is a niche in the west wall, placed 88 cm. from the south wall and 89 cm. above present ground level; it measures 33 cm. in height, 58 cm. in width, and 26 cm. in depth. Midway in the south wall there is a simply lintelled doorway 67 cm. wide (Fig. 5). Some 4 m. 50 cm. eastwards from the door, there is a small, rectangular window 20 cm. wide and 54 cm. high, with an internal splay of 62 cm. (Fig. 5). The structure marked B on the plan is simply the remains of a possibly rectangular dry-masonry building; a few stones with a maximum height of only 45 cm. appear to suggest a small house a little over 9 m. long and 4 m, 40 cm. wide externally. No trace of a door is visible. Building C is rectangular and measures internally 7 m. 48 cm. in length and 5 m. 25 cm. in width. Only the west wall survives to more than a metre in height, it contains an eccentrically placed doorway constructed of two large unchamfered jambs sur mounted by a neatly constructed six-piece pointed arch (Fig. 6; Plate IV). A flat lintel behind the arch supported the wall. On either side of the door, there is a small ogee headed window, neatly constructed of four stones, the unchamfered jambs being 30 cm. apart and the internal splay averaging 76 cm. Opposite the western door, in the east wall, there are the remains of another door with unchamfered jambs. North of Temple Brecan lies the much-ruined Building D; as in A, part of its north wall has been incorporated in the enclosure wall. Its walls survive to a maximum height of 1 m. 80 cm., but in places only a single course remains. The building measures 10 m. 30 cm. in length and 4 m. 97 cm. in width internally.

A niche in this wall measures 66 cm. in width, 32 cm. in height, and 46 cm. in depth, being 96 cm. above present ground level. Only the plain jambs of the doorway in the west wall remain, its width being approximately the same as that of the one in the opposite wall. The window in the west wall is a neatly constructed example with two chamfered trefoil headed lights and a total width of 78 cm. and an internal splay of 1 m. 36 cm. Immed iately to the north of both doorways, a partition- wall divides the northern portion of the building from the rest. In the north wall there is a niche 95 cm. from ground level, it measures 46 cm. in width, 41 cm. in height, and 39 cm. in depth; if there was a window in this wall, no certain trace of it remains. West of Building H lies the structure marked I on the plan (Fig. 1); it consists of a scatter of limestone blocks apparently forming a rectangle, the measurements suggested on the plan are only very approximate. Little comment can be offered on these domestic buildings, the various architectural features noted suggest a general contemporaneity with Teampall an Phoill. It is. perhaps, worth noting that Buildings C, D, F and H, with their pairs of opposed doorways, closely resemble in their plan the traditional thatched house of the west and north.14 INSCRIBED STONES AND CROSS-SLABS Some nineteen inscribed stones, and cross-slabs (some of which are also inscribed), are known from Temple Brecan. Fifteen survive on the site. The ten inscribed stones and slabs which are known have been variously published by Petrie and Macalister, these and some of the known slabs without inscriptions have been listed by Crawford.15 The parenthesised numbers given them below are marked on the general plan (Fig. 1).

(3) Inscribed cross-slab (Fig. 10:1): this slab was published in Petrie as a fragment some 80 cm. long bearing a plain Latin cross of two incised lines in the lower cantons of which was the three-line inscription ORAIT AR ANMAIN SEMBLAIN. Macalister read the inscription as ORAIT AR ANMAIN SCANDLAIN and illustrated a slab some 137 cm. long bearing a Latin cross, as before, but with circular terminals and a small incised cross in each of the two upper cantons. The slab here figured is a thick, heavy, rectangular stone which lies to the south-west of Temple Brecan, it measures approximately 1 m. 41 cm. in length, 56 cm. in width, and 12 cm. in thickness. Its surface is considerably worn and fissured, but a two-line Latin cross and traces of an inscription in the lower cantons are visible; there is nothing to suggest the presence of smaller crosses or circular terminals. The inscription is now, unfortunately, almost illegible: it does consist of three lines and possibly commences ORAIT, the third line may commence with an S. Petrie, p. 22, PL XVI, fig. 32.

It measures 55 cm. by 47.5 cm. and is 19 cm. thick; it bears a cross pattee within a circle. Hitherto unrecorded. (5) Inscribed cross-slab (Plate V; Fig. 8): the greater portion of a large, well preserved, slab of sub-rectangular shape with gently rounded corners; it measures approximately 1 m. 10 cm. by 90 cm., and is 14 cm. thick. One face is dressed to a smooth surface and bears a Greek cross with splayed terminals and a circular centre set within a double circle. In the surviving quadrants are the remains of the inscription SCI BRE[CA]NI (S[an] c[t]i Bre[ca]ni). When Petrie first saw this slab in 1821, it was broken and in fragments, but complete; he misread the abbreviation SCI as CI (for, as he thought, Capiti) and was disposed to regard the stone as Saint Brecan's head stone.16 Petrie records that the slab was found in the early years of the nineteenth century *within a circular enclosure known as St. Brecan's tomb, at a depth of about six feet from the surface, on the occasion of its being opened to receive the body of a distinguished and popular Roman Catholic ecclesiastic of the county of Galway, who made a dying request to be buried in this grave'.17 An inscribed stone lamp was found under this slab (see below No. 19). Westropp published a strange story to the effect that the slab had been dug up by a certain Don Pedro and carried away by an antiquary,18 However, as Macalister pointed out, since portion of the slab survives, 16 Petrie, The Ecclesiastical Architecture of Ireland.

The inscription ran across a pair of incised lines, the remains of the shaft of a cross. Petrie examined the stone in 1822 and in his published account describes it as 'lying close to Temple Benen' (which lies at the other end of the island); according to his illustration the fragment measured approximately 46 cm. square. Ferguson read the inscription as OR[&lt;5lTJ DO MAINACH and correctly gave its provenance as Temple Brecan. Nonetheless, Crawford and Macalister followed Petrie in ascribing it to Temple Benen, though Crawford did note that such a slab was not to be found there. It is a rectangular fragment bearing a pair of incised, vertical, lines, evidently the shaft of a Latin cross. Across the shaft runs the finely cut inscription OR[0lT] AR MAINACH.

It stands to the south-east of Temple Brecan at the western end of what appears to be a multiple grave (see below). Petrie considered this slab to mark the last resting place of seven Roman pilgrims. Macalister, however, preferred to consider the slab as dedicatory, as that to Thomas the Apostle, rather than commemorative: 'being erected in honour of the seven martyred sons of Symphorosa, who are named in the Irish martyrologies of Oengus and of Gorman, under date 27 June'.21 Petrie, p. 21, PL XIV, fig. 28.

According to Macalister, who has published a good illustration of the object, it is a small cresset lamp of roughly biconical form and some 8 cm. in height and maximum diameter. There is a hollow in its upper surface for receiving a little oil and a floating wick. Around its circumference is the inscription + OR[6lT] AR BRAN N AILITHER (Pray for Bran the Pilgrim); Bran has been considered an abbreviated form of Brecan, but since there is quite sufficient room on the lamp for the full name Brecan, if desired, Bran was probably the name intended. The lamp was found, according to Petrie, in Leaba Bhreacdin (St. Brecan's grave), beneath the cross-slab bearing the saint's name. Petrie, p. 20, PL XII, fig. 25.

CROSSES The remains of three stone crosses exist on or near the site and these have been labelled respectively the West, South and North crosses.22 It is hoped they will be the subject of detailed study in the near future: The West Cross: the shaft and four fragments of the head noted. The shaft now stands at the south-west corner of a small rectangular dry-masonry structure tradi tionally known as Leaba an Spioraid Naoimh, the fragments lie nearby. These frag ments can be fitted together and do, in fact, fit the shaft; portion of the centre of the cross and the sinister arm are missing. Originally the cross would have been approxi mately 2 m. 13 cm. high; the head is ringed and deeply cusped at the angles of arms and shaft. On the present west face is carved a crucifixion, the figure of Christ being flanked by a pair of smaller figures, presumably representing the two thieves. On the shaft, above and below these figures, are rectangular panels of interlaced knot-work. The lowermost panel contains a pair of double-looped serpents biting each other. The east face of the cross is entirely ornamented with panels of interlaced knot-work and fret designs. Dunraven, p. 89, PL XIV.

Henry, La Sculpture Irlandaise, Vol. II (1933), p. 104. The South Cross: this cross now lies on top of the low limestone cliff, above and to the south of Temple Brecan. It was apparently collected, in fragments, from among the ruins by Sir William Wilde in 1848.23 Sometime later, it was cemented to a rectangular plinth of limestone blocks, and this drastic treatment has effectively hidden one entire face. The cross itself is broken into at least seven fragments, now fitted together, and it measures 1 m. 94 cm. in total length. It has an asymmetrically ringed head of which only the two lower arcs survive; part of the upper portion of the ring is figured in Dunraven's illustration. The greater part of the exposed face is ornamented with panels of interlaced knot-work and fret patterns. Dunraven, p. 89 and fig.

The North Cross: the lower portion of the shaft of this cross stands to a height of approximately 1 m. above present ground level some 80 m. to the north-east of Temple Brecan. It stands at the west end of a crudely built rectangular enclosure of limestone blocks. Within this lie the other surviving fragments of what must have been the largest and most magnificent of the high crosses at Temple Brecan. Including the standing lower portion of the shaft, ten fragments have now been located. These are, it would appear, the pieces of a high cross collected from 'various quarters of the ruins' by Sir Samuel Ferguson sometime before 1853.24 The cross originally stood over 4 m. high and only the arms and portion of the shaft at arm level are missing. It narrows gradually in width from base to top, the head is ringed and the angles of arms and shaft are cusped. One face bears a crucifixion scene similar to that on the West Cross and panels of interlaced knot-work and fret patterns, the other is filled with panels of interlaced knot-work. This cross has never been properly published. Dunraven, p. 89. Sexton, Irish Figure Sculptures of the Early Christian Period (1946), p. 275. OTHER REMAINS The other remains at Temple Brecan which have yet to be described include leabai or 'beds' which may be either graves or penitential stations. Leaba an Spioraid Naoimh (the bed of the Holy Spirit) is'a small sub-rectangular enclosure of dry-masonry, measuring approximately 3 m. by 2 m. 50 cm., its long axis lying east-west. The West cross now stands at its south-western corner. Various writers, including Dunraven and Westropp25 have called it Leaba Bhreacdin, but, as Macalister has pointed out, this site lies further to the south and is marked by the great slab bearing the saint's name.26 This is confirmed by local tradition. Tobar an Spioraid Naoimh: O'Donovan records a well, dedicated to the Holy Spirit, which apparently lay to the north of Temple Brecan. The lost cross-slab (No. 17) stood beside it. According to Dunraven, it consisted, when Petrie visited it in 1822, of 'a circular font of about 8 ft. in diameter formed of a single stone placed over a spring, but much choked up with stones and rubbish'.27 Some seventeen years later, however, O'Donovan could succinctly describe it as 'a hole in the ground'.28 No trace of it is visible today. He noted 'the people are wont to say their prayers at it 24 Ferguson, op. cit. u Dunraven, op. cit., p. 89; Westropp, JRSAI 25 (1895), 253. ** JRSAI 25 (1895), 380. 87 Dunraven, op. cit., p. 90. 28 Ordnance Survey Letters, Co.

Leaba Bhreacdin (the bed or grave of St. Brecan) (Plate V): it lies to the south of Leaba an Spioraid Naoimh, and is a low rectangular grass-grown platform, measuring approximately 5 m. by 4.5 m.29 It is retained by a kerb of limestone blocks varying greatly in size, from one to three courses being used. Incorporated in this kerb are cross-slabs (4) and (8), and on the bed or grave lie slabs (5), (6), (7). Haddon and Brown record that it was customary 'when any member of a family falls sick, another member makes a promise, that if the sick one recovers, the person promising will sleep, one, two or three nights in one of the saints' beds. One bed at the Seven Churches (probably St. Brecan's bed) is said to be occupied pretty regularly'.30 Immediately to the south of the last mentioned site are the much-overgrown remains of what appears to be a similar structure (marked 'Leaba?' on Fig 1). The area of these leabai, from Teampall an Phoill northwards to Building F, is now frequently flooded in wet weather to a depth of 40 cm. and more: the site was apparently better drained in antiquity, and a number of flat stones set in the ground west of Temple Brecan and Building F appear to be covering-stones for a now very delapi dated drainage system. Tobar Bhreacdin (St. Brecan's well): this site is marked on the six-inch Ordnance Survey map as Toberbrecan31 and lay somewhere in the area between Temple Brecan and Buildings H and I, an area now heavily overgrown. The programme of the excursion of the British Association in 1857 included a visit to both Tobar-an Spiritneeve (sic) and the well of St. Brecan. Also mentioned is a holy well called 'Bullaun a Collagh' to the north of the site.32 An elder bush over this well used, at least in the last century, to be decorated with votive rags.33 To the south of the main church, the cross-slab dedicated to the Seven Romans (VII ROMANI), and three other cross-slabs, Nos. (11)-(14), stand at the west side of a small rectangular area bounded by a low kerb. This kerb is formed by thin lime stone slabs, their edges just protruding above the ground, enclosing an area which measures 5 m. in length, and 2 m. in width. The long axis of the enclosed area is NNE-SSW, and it is divided by further slabs into what appear to be five slab-covered graves with a roughly east-west orientation. Finally, brief mention must be made of a few quern-stones and architectural fragments now lying about the ruins. In Temple Brecan, there are the two disc-shaped 29 It is difficult to reconcile the present rectangular shape of the leaba with the hearsay account of a circular enclosure recorded by Petrie (see description of cross-slab (5)). 30 Haddon and Brown, The ethnography of the Aran Islands, County Galway', PRIA 18 (1891-93), 819. 31 See footnote 1. 32 Haverty, The Aran Islands: or a report of the excursion of the ethnological section of the British Association from Dublin to the western islands of Aran in September 1857 (Dublin 1859), p. 41. 33 Haddon and Brown, op. cit., p. 818.</page><page sequence="29">AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF TEMPLE BRECAN, ARAN 27 lower stones of two rotary querns, each 45 cm. in diameter and one broken into three fragments; in each case, the central perforation is 4.5cm. in diameter. Also in the church are the limestone heads of two, two-light, ogee windows of Medieval date; each is 26 cm. in height and ornamented with foliate designs (Plate III). A small, crudely carved, cross (Fig. 10:4) was found lying on Leaba an Spioraid Naoimh, it is probably a relatively modern grave-stone. In Building D, there are four fragments of one or more plain, chamfered, round arches. The remains at Temple Brecan comprise one of the finest collections of ecclesiastical monuments on the Aran Islands and reflect some eight centuries of religious activity. Precise dating is difficult, but the surviving fragment of the early church of Saint Brecan, and many of the inscribed cross-slabs could very well be as early as the eighth century A.D. The fragments of stone crosses are evidently related to other crosses on Aran and in Co. Clare which have been dated by De Paor to the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries.34 The Transitional church presumably dates to the thirteenth century. The domestic buildings, and Teampall on Phoill, are of later Medieval date, the latter possibly as late as the sixteenth century.
