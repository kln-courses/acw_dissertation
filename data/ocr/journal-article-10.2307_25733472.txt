<plain_text><page sequence="1">306 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE THE AFTERLIVES OF AESTHETICISM AND DECADENCE IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY By Margaret D. Stetz The long nineteenth century turns out to be longer than we thought. If we turn to the evidence of both literary fiction and works of popular culture, then it seems that we are still in it - or rather, that we have deliberately, self-consciously rejoined it. The rallying cry of the opening decades of the twentieth century may have been to "make it new" (with "it" referring to any creative activity or artifact). But the equally insistent demand by Western artists of the current decade has been to "make it old" - to make it, in fact, Neo-Victorian. At the moment, the part of the lengthy nineteenth century that appears to be most attractive to writers, illustrators, and filmmakers is the7m de siecle. In works aimed variously at sophisticated and elite audiences, at mass audiences, and even at audiences composed largely of children, artists are echoing the late-Victorian aesthetes' determination to make it beautiful and the decadents' resolve to make it strange. In doing so, they are re-imagining, but also reviving, subjects, styles, principles, and even individual turn-of-the-century figures that modernism supposedly erased or, at least, eclipsed. How dated, how misguided, now seems the 1983 "Introduction" to the Penguin edition of Edmund Gosse's Father and Son, with its dismissal of the legacy of the fin de siecle as a matter of no importance. In that volume, which is still in print, the British critic and poet Peter Abbs rejects disdainfully all of Gosse's achievements apart from his 1907 family memoir. Before 1920, as Abbs reports, "Gosse was one of the most influential figures in English cosmopolitan literary life"; by "1940 he was all but forgotten." For what reason? Abbs explains: The weakness of Gosse lay in his aestheticism... [and] this hedonistic approach to literature floundered badly as civilization encountered the irrational slaughter of the First World War; it had no way of engaging with the upheaval because aestheticism itself was ultimately more a symptom of the malaise than interpretation or corrective. In the changing conditions, Edmund Gosse's lightness of touch became not so much sensitivity as a lack of pressure; the super-refinement, in the crisis of civilization, became a mode of superficiality. (15-16) While casting Gosse's literary "voice" as a mere "disappearing whisper," Abbs praises the "trenchant" work of the next generation of writers - the modernists, especially Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot, who rebelled against their aesthetic and decadent predecessors. What seems increasingly clear, though, is how little those supposedly tough and rugged modernists have been able to offer their successors in the first decade of the twenty-first century, and how faint is the creative inspiration they are providing today. Once again, there is a "crisis of civilization"; once again there has been an "upheaval" in the wake of "irrational slaughter." But in the post-9/11 transatlantic world of the arts, it is not Eliot and Pound who are supplying the fragments that we shore against our ruins; it is Oscar Wilde and Walter Pater. Aestheticism and decadence have proven themselves more than merely resilient movements. They are now resurgent ones, driving new literary cults such as the past-futuristic genre of so-called "gaslight romance," and resplendent ones, bursting forth in the gleaming material surfaces of steampunk and in the dark frills of Gothic Lolita fashions. This revival is no mindless exercise in nostalgia or escapism. Although there are indeed nostalgic and escapist impulses involved, even these are being deployed thoughtfully, often</page><page sequence="2">Victorians Live 307 with an element of serious scholarship behind them. Most interesting, however, are the number of works, particularly in the area of literary fiction, that are using the philosophical lens of aestheticism and decadence to examine the challenging issues of contemporary life. For the African-American novelist Louis Edwards, the imagined story of the Black valet who accompanied Oscar Wilde on his 1882 tour of the United States becomes the medium through which to look at racial barriers and class divides and, at the same time, at questions of hybridity and fluidity in both racial and sexual identities. In his Oscar Wilde Discovers America (2003), the novel's protagonist, William Traquair, discovers himself by coming to apprehend "his beauty, his particular beauty that, in the end, was tragic, as the very thing - the way he looked - that had delivered to him so much special treatment, so many privileges, so much, including, he was sure, the love of Oscar, the beauty that had ushered him into the realm of what he desired, [yet] was also what had denied him the thing he wanted most" (280). For Zadie Smith, too, in her novel On Beauty (2005), lives and fates turn on questions of aesthetic valuation and appreciation, as well as on the dangerous intersections of beauty and erotic desire, all within a framework of bi-racialism, multiculturalism, and transnationalism. Much has been made of the literary conversation that Smith, a Black British writer, enters into so playfully with E. M. Forster's 1910 novel, Howards End. But less has been said about its dialogue with Paterian and Wildean issues of the proper and improper ways to respond to the power, as one of Smith's fictional characters puts it, of "beauty as a physical actuality in the world'" (207). For the house that lies at the center of a property dispute in Howards End, Smith substitutes a work of art: a portrait of "a Voodoo goddess, Erzulie," who "avenge[s] herself on men," and who is depicted as "a tall, naked black woman... standing in a fantastical white space." Like the Salome of Oscar Wilde's creation, she is the meeting-point of contradictions: "She represents love, beauty, purity, the ideal female and the moon... and she's the mystere of jealousy, vengeance and discord" [ellipses in original]. The Black woman to whom this painting later will be willed by its owner exclaims, in appreciation of her beauty, "She's fabulous" (174-75). Beauty drives the conflicts throughout, and the ghosts of aesthetic debate are everywhere in Smith's twenty-first-century urban landscapes - even in a music megastore in Boston that inhabits "the old municipal library, built in the 1880s in brash red brick with glittering black windows and a high Ruskinian arch above the door... In this building Oscar Wilde once gave a lecture concerning the superiority of the lily over all other flowers" (179). Beauty and its relationship to morality, amorality, and immorality was, of course, at the center of Wilde's own The Picture of Dorian Gray. Thus it is also the focal point of a new graphic novel version of Wilde's text that the illustrator I. N. J. Culbard has produced in conjunction with the writer Ian Edginton, bringing this decadent tale, still in its fin-de-siecle setting, into a genre much favored today by adolescent readers. More surprising, however, is that even younger groups of readers are being introduced through children's books to both beauty and strangeness in a Wildean context. Daniel Pinkwater and Jack E. Davis add a comic spin in The Picture of Morty and Ray (2003), in which two young friends delight in watching a "scary movie. It was about a handsome guy who had his picture painted... The handsome guy behaved like a jerk" (2), until "The rich handsome guy looked handsome as ever, but the picture had changed!" (10). Enthralled by this scenario, the two boys, Morty and Ray, draw each other's portraits, then deliberately misbehave in order to make their pictures change: "The next day we took the last two pickles out of a big pickle jar and stuffed them into our friend Oscar's pants. Then</page><page sequence="3">308 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE we poured the pickle juice on him and told people he had wet himself (26). Their images do alter in response to their misdeeds, but they tire of the process of making this happen and give the portraits to Oscar, who responds enthusiastically, "Neat, neat, neat! This is the coolest thing I have ever seen!" (29). Unlike most work for children, the story has no moral and no didactic lesson; it merely celebrates the power of art to influence the spectator and to effect the impossible (Figure 13). Wildean echoes pervade the equally comical Bill in a China Shop (Figure 14), by Katie McAllaster Weaver and also from 2003, in which the aesthetic movement's passion for porcelain drives an ungainly, anthropomorphic bull, who favors the clothes of a late-Victorian dandy and who becomes a determined collector: Once there was a bull named Bill who felt a certain thrilling chill each time he saw a china shop - the teacups made his heart flip-flop. (4-5) Disaster strikes, when this overlarge, albeit impeccably turned out, Wildean-looking figure attempts to purchase "a cup that made him want to shout,/ a cup he could not live without" (7). Inevitably, he stumbles and smashes most of the shop's contents. But all ends happily in Weaver's verse-narrative, as three elderly ladies come to his rescue, and Bill repays them with an invitation to tea in his rooms, which are furnished in high aesthetic style, complete with arts-and-crafts furniture and jars holding peacock feathers. A more serious exploration of the principle of art-for-art's-sake occurs in yet another surprising work for young readers, Elise Broach's Masterpiece (2008), a tale of art-making and art forgery located in the present. Here, the protagonist is a self-taught visual artist, who not only discovers his gift for drawing, but the ecstasy that goes with creation: "It felt as if time stopped. Marvin was so focused on the work that he lost a sense of everything around him... The walls of the room seemed to disappear: The table floated away" (Broach 157). To produce a work of art is "a way of settling deep inside himself, lost to the outside world" (92). But Marvin's "outside world," unlike that of a late-Victorian aesthete, is a hole in the kitchen wall of a New York City apartment, for he is not only a genius, but a small black beetle, who paints by dipping his delicate front legs into inkpots. Broach's idealistic insect artist experiences conflict with his uncomprehending beetle family and bonds instead with a human boy - one at odds with his own Philistine mother, for whom art is merely a commodity - to form a new sort of domestic partnership. Some filmmakers, however, appear uncomfortable with the element of social estrangement in the self-exiling figures whom they have disinterred (in some cases, quite literally) from the late-Victorian past. Screenwriters and directors seem intent, therefore, on domesticating these aesthetes and decadents and planting them firmly within the confines of heterosexuality and the bourgeois family. In James Mangold's Kate and Leopold (2001), the marriage-resistant inventor and dreamer from 1876 who drops suddenly, by way of a "portal" in time, into the twenty-first century speaks in Wildean epigrams ("Life is not solely comprised of tasks, but of tastes," he announces) and demonstrates a close acquaintance with the language of flowers and with opera; yet he must be turned into a heterosexual suitor and representative of hearty masculinity nonetheless.</page><page sequence="4">Victorians Live 309 hIIIIIIHIII^^ Figure 13.

Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) gives free rein to the decadent vision of Willy Wonka who, in his long velvet coat and top hat, resembles both Dr. Caligari and Oscar Wilde (and who sports a script "W," worn as a pendant around his neck, as though to emphasize the latter association). But it is the aesthete, Charlie, who will ultimately triumph - the aesthete who responds to his first sight of the artificial landscape in which</page><page sequence="6">Victorians Live 311 Wonka has replaced nature entirely with candy-creations by exclaiming, "It's beautiful!" This is a line of dialogue that exists neither in Roald Dahl's original 1964 story nor in the 1971 film adaptation. Also original to this screenplay by John August is Wonka's offhand reply to Charlie's effusions: "What? Oh, yeah. It's very beautiful." His is the distracted response of a decadent, preoccupied with perfecting strange effects and indifferent to the aesthete's attitude of appreciation. Charlie, though, is more than an appreciator of beauty; he is also a domesticated aesthete, so deeply bound to his family that he not only convinces the coldly perverse and inhuman Wonka to accept this tie, but to reunite with his own father. Yet the ultimate taming of the "Wilde" artist, as well as the most literal resurrection of aestheticism, occurs in Wes Craven's English-language segment for Paris, je faime (2006), a compilation film made in France with multiple directors. In Pere Lachaise cemetery, the audience sees Wilde rising from his own tomb to perform the unlikely function of reconciling a heterosexual couple whose engagement is on the rocks. "What do you want from a husband?" the man demands in frustration of his fiancee. "Lightness," she replies. Here, it is the quality of "lightness" that Wilde champions, models through his manner, and encourages the would-be husband to discover in himself. Without this "lightness," which only the figure of Wilde can bequeath to the present, there will be no marrying, no social bonding, and thus no future for the human race. "Lightness" - the word that Peter Abbs applied to Edmund Gosse pejoratively in 1983, to explain why aestheticism supposedly became anachronistic in troubled times and vanished - returns via the late-Victorians to the popular and high arts alike of the twenty-first century. Now, however, it is a quality that is openly being desired, embraced, and celebrated. So too are aesthetes and decadents themselves returning, arriving in myriad forms and even species. Aestheticism and decadence are very current indeed, and they are inspiring not merely scholarship, but creative works in a wide variety of genres and media, for an equally wide variety of audiences. "How strange!" we might think. But who would not also greet such a development by exclaiming, "It's beautiful!"? University of Delaware WORKS CONSIDERED Abbs, Peter. "Introduction."
