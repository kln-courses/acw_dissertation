But until now it has never been the subject of research, either historical or anthropological. If the ceremony of launching looks at first sight like the transition rite that accompanies the ship as she passes from land to water, it soon becomes clear that the critical transition is from the status of an inanimate thing to that of an animate and social being. From being a numbered thing at her launch, the ship receives her name and all that comes with the name. This includes everything that gives her an individual and social identity, her luck, her life essence and her femininity. My research into the ceremony sheds light not only on the nature and development of the ceremony itself but also on the religious beliefs of sailors, on the symbolic classification of a ship by sailors, on the extensive and reincarnating power of the ship's name, and on the relationship between women and ships and mariners. It is the last aspect on which I want to concentrate here. Most of us know that sailors refer to a ship by the feminine pronoun. But the extent of the metaphor of the ship as a living, feminine and anthropomorphic being, is not, I think, appreciated. Furthermore, it is this metaphor that shows up the quintessential and extraordinary nature of the launching ceremony. I say 'extraordinary' because this ceremony is unique in our society and any of its auxiliary societies in that it symbolically brings to life an artefact. It looks more like a case of animism than of personification. Its status in the Royal Navy as a state occasion makes all this even more remarkable, particularly as it is accompanied by a service of the established Church. There are of course other new things that are inaugurated by secular or sacred means. But in none of these instances does the artefact acquire the properties of a living thing, let alone a feminine person. There is the, proclivity to personify virtues and institutions in the feminine, but these are not conlceptualized as living and human beings. Personal articles are given human attributes, with a name and even a gender. But this is not a social rule, nor a rule of grammar, as in the case of the personified Lship. Nor is life, name and gender instilled through the public enactment of a prescribed ceremony. ~~~~~~7 A y r 1-~DOC/ O+HAT+{AM iEK?CYAt IGH&gt;\,S TE DUCHESS OF NENT Prcim9ousQbitr0as 6r- i - t-us Z Gcpc&amp;) &amp;,aJ ?$~~~ JU L Y 1Q 54 39 5 18 1b Dcsrro~fr fib- i lzo. ~~~~~~' (gs}16" JUL-l )9 eO I q 3&gt; 4ULEt SabnSlam 4$ubonria c iwy 9144, I a, s- 184 880 6u4dV at Chalhain . , 1-20 +ierRp%atTHjhncss ',he ahssc OF 1ent arrives. t: t 112$S P sentatton of 130U9u$ W s 9 X -s I 11-53 Certnw 4f $kssi the Ship - KH-49 4-kr *oa 140C55 0 n twi*o \ Rcs the Ship. -.

Members of the Royal Navy, and indeed the merchant navies, talk about a ship as having a life, a soul, a spirit, a personality and a character of her own. These notions are not necessarily differentiated, and the terms are used interchangeably. Whether the word 'soul', 'life' or 'spirit' is used depends on the informant. What is constant is the gender of the ship. In the English language, which allows gender only to human beings and animals of determinate sex, it is the rule to refer to a ship as 'she' or 'her'. While reflecting the strength of the metaphor, the rules of grammar also indicate its limit. The linguistic boundary lies in the region of the relative pronoun. According to Fowler it is correct to say: 'The ship that lost her rudder' and 'the Arethusa that lost her rudder' or 'Arethusa who lost her rudder'. Sailors frequently drop the 'the' in front of the name of a ship. They explain that if I went to see a friend I would not say 'I am going to see the Sally' but 'I am going to see Sally' and that this applies to a ship. The image of the ship as a fictive woman is established in diaries and chronicles, is legally encoded in naval and legal documents, and celebrated in poetry and prose. It survives masculine names, figureheads and the labels East- Indiarmen and men-of-war. In the current Royal Navy, as I have indicated, the metaphor is as strong as ever. But what kind of woman is she? A ship is represented as possessing the attributes of more than one category of woman. All are stereotypes that are idealized by sailors. Two images predominate: the all-powerful mother who rnurtures and offers womb-like protection; and the enchantress of whom a man can never be certain. Other images intrude, but all inspire romantic and consuming love, awe and constant devotion. When Conrad writes of 'the mysteries of her (the ship's) feminine nature' and how the love of a man for his ship 'is nearly as great as that of man for a woman, and often as blind' he expresses the sentiments of modern sailors. Conrad not only depicts vividly the ship as a woman, but brings out the whole environment of being at sea. My informants frequently explain to me, with some emotion and with interesting detail, the reality at sea. It is disorienting, frightening</page><page sequence="3">as well as awe-inspiring. This environmental context is crucial when we look for reasons for the feminine nature of the ship. In an environment which is not the natural habitat of human beings, a man may feel himself to be especially vulnerable if as a species he is incompletely represented. That vulnerability could well account for the partnership of an all-male crew with a feminine ship. It is significant that the male and secular principle is complemented not by a secular and natural woman, but by her metaphysical and metaphorical manifestation. Needham has gathered enough ethnographic evidence from diverse and land-based societies to suggest that the complementary opposition men:women:: temporal:mystical is widespread if not archetypal. It is easy to understand that the oceanic environment exacerbates the need for mystical protection that emanates from women. In addition, in circumstances where uncertainty and the likelihood of sudden death is increased, the symbol of rebirth in the form of the mother would be particularly welcome. Nor should we omit to look at the metaphor from the point of view of the archetypal figure of the mother and the mother goddess which according to Neumann is deep within the human psyche. Neumann (1974) also explains how the ship has served as the symbol of the mother, of rebirth, and salvation for many cultures over many periods; and not only for people that go to sea. It comes as a surprise to find that unlike the life essence of the ship, the universality of the ship as a symbolic woman is undermined by some ethnographic data. Nevertheless it is very widespread and historical, and cross-cultural material helps to underline the supernatural power of women in the oceanic domain. Hornell finds that from the Mediterranean to the Pacific Ocean, and from Ancient Greece to the 20th century, 'ships are generally considered to be feminine'. He believes that the feminine principle is often introduced when the ship is dedicated to her tutelary goddess at the launch. He describes such cases from the coast near Madras. Hornell points out that sometimes there is an identifiable icon of the deity. Malinowski relates how the Trobriand canoes are closely associated with the Flying Witches, whose power is on occasion concentrated in the carvings at the prow. In western societies, from the coasts of pre-classical Mediterranean to Catholic Europe, patron saints of mariners are usually feminine. Figureheads, now no longer extant on British ships, were particularly efficacious if the image was a woman, especially if she was bare-breasted (Kemp 1976). There is some ground for concluding that this icon symbolized the mother who suckled the infant god, and that this made her a powerful intercessor especially against the devil. However one hardly needs this evidence to recognize the existence of a special relationship between women, ships and mariners in British fleets. First and foremost is the irrefutable feminine nature of the ship. Then there is the launch at which the two most important personages are both feminine: the ship and her sponsor. It is the role of the sponsor, a woman of high rank by ascription, to exercise her mystical powers to imbue the ship with luck and life by naming her in strict adherence to the ritual detail: the bottle must move, the ship begin to move, the name (the generator of the luck and life) be pronounced -- all at the same moment. Anything else augurs bad luck for the ship. Unfortunately, a ship at her launch is hypersensitive towards her sponsor and may react with self- destructive wilfulness to any lapse by the sponsor in her manner of dress or rendition of the formula. There are many accounts of instances when a ship has refused to move or moved too soon, making it impossible for the bottle to break at the right moment. When a ship behaves in this way she puts her own luck at risk, but it is always the sponsor who is blamed. The sponsor's power to bless has inadvertently turned into the power to curse. There are several ethnographic examples where positive power co-exists with negative power in one and the same person: a coexistence that had been spotted earlier by Jacob Grimm (in Briffault 1927). But negative power, where ships of the Royal Navy are concerned, usually emanates from ordinary women. Strict taboos attempt to restrict this harmful influence. A woman on board a ship at night is regarded with particular misgiving. She is bound to bring bad luck, and sophisticated technology is no proof against this. On the contrary, it may itself be a target. This is nicely demonstrated by the true story of the Rolls- Royce engine of a destroyer that blew up when a woman computer programmer had spent the night on board. It was perfectly true that the manufacturers had omitted to drill a critical hole, and the engine could have blown up at any time. But why, the officers wondered, had it blown up on the one night that a woman was on board? (The reasoning is Azande, the granary is water- borne.) The taboos excluding women from critical areas extend to the part of the dockyard where ships are under construction. We know that equivalent taboos are described in a host of ethnographies. They also operate on oil rigs and down coalmines in Britain, and are very stringent in fishing communities here and across the world. With modern technology no match for the vicissitudes of luck, it is not surprising to find that the ceremony of the launch is as indispensable as ever, and part of the regulations of the Royal Navy. Nor is it surprising that it is still believed that if the bottle fails to break at exactly the right time, the fate of the ship is in doubt. At the launch of a destroyer in 1975, a distinguished naval officer was alarmed when he thought that the sponsor had failed to break the bottle across the bow. 'After all: he told me, 'I might be in command of her one day' The role of the sponsor has if anything increased. Advanced technology has made it possible for her to be seen to control not only the mystical but also the technical part of the launching. From 1876, engravings in the Illustrated London News portray Royal sponsors setting the ship in motion and releasing the bottle with just a touch of the finger. It may have been coincidental that this overall control mechanism was installed at the same time as the Christian service was added to the ceremony. But the very existence of a Christian VACANCIES The University of Pittsburgh invites ipplications and nominations for the kndrew Mellon Professorship in knthropology, starting in 1986 or 987.

The critical part f the launching ceremony is concerned rith imbuing the ship, an artefact, with ick and the soul and personality of a zminine entity -- hardly in accord with 'hristian doctrine. Although this naming itual has always been called a 'christening', ie term is misleading: the subject of the itual is not a human being but an artefact; ie liquid is not water but wine; the elebrant is neither ordained nor male. The uties of the sponsor (or godmother as she ; sometimes referred to) are in any case not onsistent with that of a Christian odmother, apart from the secular bligations that start after the launch. The puzzle comes no nearer to solution ihen one looks at the varying attitudes of iinisters of the Church to this ceremony. ome clergymen in the 19th century voiced trong disapproval of the naming ritual and f its being called a baptism. Today, cumbents of parishes local to the hipyards are happy to conduct the service t a launch. The only aspect that continues Z baffle them is that no higher ranking iinisters are ever invited to officiate, not yen when the Queen Mother is the sponsor dlthough the service was inaugurated by hie Archbishop of Canterbury in 1875, ince then it has been the rule for the local ~cumbent to conduct it. But if the eremony of the launch seems to bother the lain body of the Church, for naval haplains the problem is even more omplicated. Among the duties of the Thaplain of the Fleet is the keeping up to ate of the launching service, and pproving the minister chosen to conduct it. 'et, as a senior naval chaplain was at pains</page><page sequence="4">to point out to me, according to the Naval Chaplaincy no naval chaplain should himself ever take part in a launching. Incidentally, this same chaplain shares, and with conviction, the view of sailors that the ship is a living and feminine entity, though he does deny the ship her soul, that hallmark of a Christian being. To understand the religious beliefs of sailors one has to look beyond the tenets of Christianity. The power of a ship's name, the naming ceremony, the metaphor of the ship as a fictive woman, the taboos relating to women: all are part of the beliefs of sailors which they themselves call 'superstitious'. It is well known in our own society that sailors are superstitious. What is not appreciated is that when sailors describe themselves as being superstitious, and they do so frequently, it has none of the usual pejorative connotations. They explain it as a natural consequence of life at sea, which makes them see things in a different way. An acceptable part of their syncretic religion, it comes near to the sense that adhered to superstitio in early Classical Rome: a valued and useful quality (Benveniste 1973). Historical investigation shows that this so-called superstition has always existed in British navies, though specific manifestations may have changed. A ceremony to mark the launch of a new ship seems to have been imperative for centuries. But it has undergone such transformations that it is unrecognizable from, for example, the one performed in Pepys's time. The ship has always been feminine, but the relationship between women and ships had shifted over time. That the power of women has remained confined to the supernatural plane will come as no surprise. With so much emotion invested in a ship, one may well ask why the demise, unlike the launch, of a Royal Navy ship, is marked only by routine, and not by ritual. The answer must surely lie in the name through which the life, luck and personality survive the body of any one ship. The choice of names is vast, but the same names recur time and again: the present Ark Royal is the fifth ship of that name; the first belonged to Elizabeth I. If a name is outstandingly lucky and illustrious, it is reincarnated more frequently than others. The name as the keeper of lifet as integrator into society and its history, has ethnographic parallels. Mauss draws on North American Indian material to show that the name of a person is part of the stock of the tribe, and that it reincarnates the original ancestor (1950 1979). When Gronbech describes the power of the names in The Culture of the Teutons (1931) he could be writing about names of Royal Navy ships. But unlike the societies studied by Mauss and others, the Fleet, or the society of Royal Navy ships, consists entirely of feminine personages. Silvia Rodgers Benveniste, Emil. 1973.
