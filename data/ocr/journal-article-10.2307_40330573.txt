<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Rainbow Serpent in the Aboriginal Pantheon: A Review Article. By Erich Kolig, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand. The Rainbow Serpent: a chromatic piece. By I. Buchler and K. Maddock (eds). The Hague - Paris, Mouton, 1978. x + 227 pp. In the Aboriginal Pantheon, the Rainbow Serpent occupies a very prominent place. Amazingly, this theological figure has not been singled out for special treatment in the literature before the appearance, about two years ago, of this slender volume containing contributions by only three scholars. Although there are many notable Australianists who conceivably would have something pertinent to say on the subject and who regrettably were not invited to contribute, this is an interesting book. It is the product of coincidence, as Sol Tax, the general editor of the series 'World Anthropology', points out in his preface; and, as sometimes happens, coincidence and competence have combined to produce some- thing worthwhile. The actual centre piece - and the volume's raison d'etre - is a lengthy paper by Mountford, originally intended for the IXth International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences in Chicago. To Mountford's long list of sites, myths, and drawings connected with the Rainbow Serpent, there is little one could justifiably add, amend or, for that matter, criticize - regardles of the adage de mortuis nil nisi bonum. This is good solid ethnography that draws on Mountford's field notes, his previous publications, and the writings of others. As the subtitle of the volume suggests, it is a truly chromatic piece: the papers are as diverse and colourful as the image of the Rainbow Serpent. Contrasting with Mountford's straightforward ethnography is Buchler's involved piece 'the fecal crone' that deals with (I am quoting) 'shit'. It is not because of the indelicacy of the topic that one finds it difficult to comment on Buchler's dazzling display of brilliant fabri- cations, breath-taking intellectual contortions and word plays à la mode structurelle. As he goes in a rapid pace through a sheer endless series of structural transformations everyone but the most hardened structuralist is left utterly perplexed. By the expert's magical touch the wondrous world of the species-typical unconscious has once again been throv/n open to behold. Unfortunately the wizardry appears dubious in places, thus casting a shadow of doubt over this all-too-clever argument. Let me isolate just one of Buchler's ideas for closer inspection. For Buchler the Rainbow Serpent is a water python and he suggests it has been chosen by Aborigines because of its fine olfactory capacity. (This is important to his thesis about the foul smells of expulsa such as faeces) Pythons have a keen sense of smell, but their other four senses are less well developed. However, this is not readily observable; in fact, it presupposes a refined knowledge of nature of a kind unlikely to exist among hunter- gatherers, despite their thorough, empirically based wisdom in other fields. Now folk knowledge sometimes does turn out to be astonishingly accurate in detail, but more often than not contains the most atrocious misconceptions. In fact, symbolism most of the time seems to be thriving on just such 'false' attributes: the noble lion, the wise owl, the cowardly hyena etc. I do not find it convincing that the python became the symbol 312</page><page sequence="2">Erich Kolig it did because for Aborigines it conveyed the olfactory idea. And this is just one of the many question marks in the whole fabric that Buchler's fertile mind has woven skillfully but artificially. It surely does not allay suspicion to find many passages of the paper overgrown with a heavy, almost incomprehensible structuralist (?) jargon. This brought to my mind Andreski's (1972) scathing attack on scientific obscurantism: that widely used technique by which intellectual void, or lack of persuasive power, is concealed by a pompous, esoteric language of feigning profund- ity. I did not find it helpful to see this heavy fare interspersed with blatant statements cf creed such as (p. 122) 'the structural approach to meaning is neither a dressed-up form of idealism nor mentalism: it is firmly rooted in materialism and is, in consequence, a close kin of neo-Marxist thought . . .' etc. Maddock's contribution, though inspired by structuralism too, is refresh- ingly uncluttered by heavy doctrinaire statements and high-handed jargon. Indeed, I found Maddock's introduction the most rewarding part of the whole book. He follows Eliade: '. . . the Rainbow Snake is no more a rainbow than a snake. The "natural" meteorological phenomenon and the "natural" reptilian species are religiously valuable because they are related to a religious structure' (Eliade 1973:115f.). He argues that it is more profitable to address oneself to the thought complex behind the fleeting, often diffuse, images of the Rainbow Serpent, instead of - as Radcliffe-Brcwn has suggested and as most Australianists have done in the past - studying the serpentine divinity itself. There remains to be contemplated and analysed an idiom of thought, which is indicative of a deeper structure and which lies behind what may at first sight appear to be a divine identity but turns out to be a wide-ranging, only loosely inter- connected imagery. It is exactly this problem that had vexed me for years in my fieldwork in the southern Kimberleys: what I had expected to be the Rainbow Serpent, far from conforming to my neat Radcliffe-Brownian conception of it, had the temerity to present itself in many diverse, confusing guises. So for instance is the image of Galuru (or Galbudu, Yungurugu) that otherwise seems to \¿ the concept of the Rainbow Serpent, not necessarily associated with the rainbow. This specialized role was often said to be the business of the death-adder Yulurin which otherwise had nothing to do with water. The term Unggur, a linguistic associate of the famous Unggud of the central Kimberleys, refers to a so-called 'living water' - v/ater mysteriously enriched with potential life in all forms. The local Pantheon also includes a huge female snake, Yinggana, which is not associated with water at all, though by name she is akin to the Arnhem Land Rainbow Serpent Bolung, whose other name is Jingana (Maddock's spelling p. 103). Many non-serpent mythic heroes, after having entered the ground, are believed to exist now, in the well or billabong their earth-entry has created, in the form of water serpents woana. Then there are prominent myth heroes of simultaneously anthropomorphic and snake shape who had pulled from their bodies, or excreted, spherical or egg-shaped stones, murinya, and stone rods, baidbara or bunu, traditionally used in rain magic. Although possessing the water-creating attributes of Galbudu - or, to paraphrase Maddock, being galbudu - they are not conspicuously linked with the rainbow. These concrete mythical characters seem to con- trast with the diffuse presence of Galuru/Galbudu in every river, creek, water hole and sub-surface water table. And finally there are manifesta- rla</page><page sequence="3">The Rainbow Serpent tions of Galbudu which are zoomorphic but not serpentine. Aborigines sometimes spoke of Banganu, an epiphany of Galbudu apparently, who is believed to be either a huge serpent with legs or a goanna-shaped creature as large as a crocodile. When Alligator Dam near Fitzroy Crossing was scooped out with a bulldozer some years ago, fossilized bone appeared which was said by Aborigines to belong to a huge crocodile, which was Galuru. (The Rainbow Serpent as lizard or crocodile is not uncommon; see p. 60, 85, 102 etc. Cf. also Hiatt 1975:5 and 19 footnote 16.) Basically, there are two ways of ordering such chaotic information. One may either propose, as did Radcliffe-Brown, a kind of Weberian ideal type with purely conceptual or historical implications, or look for meaning behind a diffuse and many-facetted imagery. In the second context, one must examine the great number of symbols of which Maddock says (p. 4) that one might perhaps consider them in terms of Wittgenstein's family resemblance if one could only be sure that they were related at all. It was only when I opted for the latter solution, placing less emphasis on the many shapes and trappings and searching for the idiom of thought hidden behind the zoomorphic exteriors, that things seemed to fall into place. In his paper 'Metaphysics in a Mythical View of the World', Maddock considers the many facets of Bolung, a name used for the Rainbow Serpent among Dalabon and neighbouring Arnhem Land groups. Bolung refers to a particular mythic identity, a noun, a series of attributes and a phase in the cycle of the human reincarnation. In this Bolung is similar to the Unggud complex of thought and imagery in Northwestern Australia (the study of which was pioneered by Elkin 1931, 1933:461ff. and Capell 1939 and 1960). Maddock goes on to sketch three possi- bilities of hypothesizing about the Rainbow Serpent, one of which is based on the assumption that Aboriginal thought operates as it were in cycles: rounds of existence, seasonal cycles, descent cycles and the like. This may correspond with, or find expression in, the curvilinear imagery of snakes and rainbows. I wonder whether this does not contradict Maddock's earlier thesis about the image being of lesser significance than the idea behind it. If the serpent is interchangeable with crocodiles, lizards, even emus and dingoes (as seems to have been the case in southeastern Australia), does then curvilinearity still apply? The other possibility Maddock suggests seems more promising to me: to look for analogy and inversion between mythic history and the constructions placed upon present-day experiences. Unfortunately, as Maddock says, it is pointless to ask which comes first, myth or experience, and this begs the question of causality in religious symbolism. Eliade (1973: 113) has written: 'We have here a characteristic religious phenomenon: a Supreme Being becomes a "totality" by integrating a series of polar and even contradictory attributes and activities'. Through the union of opposites, through contrasting epiphanies religious poss- ibilities are actualized and exemplified. So, for instance, as Eliade points out, there is inherent in the image of the Rainbow Serpent a strong element of sexual ambivalence, but also, and perhaps more importantly, a coalescence of two contrasting realms. The Rainbow Serpent belongs to the depth, to deep waters, to the subterranean, and as such is 'archetypically' akin to the Loch Ness monster and the Hades snakes that emerged to entwine Laokoon and his sons. But he belongs also to the sky and its phenomena: clouds, rain and rainbow. He flies SÍ4:</page><page sequence="4">Erich Kolig through the air and one of his manifestations, or associates, is the whirl- wind. Thus he is an image spanning the netherworld and the ether above. Surely this is significant and invites interpretation without having to labour the olfactory capabilities that would compel snakes to be angry about foul odours. I would like to hint briefly at another important contrast. The Rainbow Serpent often appears in connection with basic creative processes, as near as Aboriginal cosmogony ever comes to a basic creation without entertaining the idea of a creatio ex nihilo. Among Aborigines in the Fitzroy Crossing area Djumanggani is a term often used to refer to a phase of the Dreamtime which preceded the wanderings of mythic beings, Waldjeri. Obliquely at least Djumanggani is associated with the water serpent and its creative deeds of carving rivers and water holes from the soil. A similar cosmogonical division exists in the well-known Unggud- Wondjin belief. As Petri (1950:360) and Capell (1960:2) recorded, in the central Kimberleys the Rainbow Serpent Galuru is also bound up with basic creative processes. In the East Kimberley I have collected a myth fragment according to which the sky was low in the Dreamtime. When two tiger-snakes, Millimbur-woana and Bayaya, who were brothers, were surprised in their sleep by a bush fire, started by the turkey man, their skins exploded and 'opened up' the sky. Opposed to the role of creator is that of destroyer, both of which are essential ingredients of the Rainbow Serpent's image. Far beyond the normal behaviour of other mythic characters who react angrily when their names are blas- phemed or their sites violated, the water snake can send a deluge to threaten the whole world, or spread endemic diseases, or strike down with enormous numinous power. It is in this capacity of destroyer that the Rainbow Serpent interferes most often, and most conspicuously, in the daily affairs of man. It swallows people in petty anger and kills wantonly when irritated - by bad smells or otherwise. Yet it kills also to protect the Law. The role of the Serpent as the keeper of the Law has often been commented on (as, for instance, at p. 31 and passim in Mountford's paper). Aborigines of Noonkanbah station relate one such incident which some elders claim to have witnessed themselves. An Aboriginal murderer had fled from Mt Anderson station and taken refuge at Maiala bore on Noonkanbah. At the behest of the aggrieved party a huge water snake (there is a rock painting near Mt Anderson depicting a huge snake; see Playford 1960:122) pursued him, travelling in a terrifying whirlwind that darkened the sky and accompanied by lightning. But from Maiala the local water snake rose to thwart the intrusion and in the ensuing struggle not only huts and tents of the Aboriginal camp were destroyed but also the bore and tank knocked over, as can still be seen today. The Mt Anderson serpent had to return leaving the murder unpunished. It is not made clear in the myth why the local water serpent rose to interfere: whether it was a fight over territorial rights or whether the Maiala serpent defended a person whose Dreaming was perhaps from that 'country'. In any case, I think, an interpretation along the lines suggested by Maddock might be fruitful: an actual experience has apparently been perceived in terms of myth and that experience so interpreted has become part of the myth repertory. This is evident also in another myth-anecdote that shows that not even whites are secure from water serpents. (Compare Maddock p. 108.) At Ligil, a deep circular section of the Fitzroy River, dwells the old 315</page><page sequence="5">The Rainbow Serpent man Nginin, a water serpent who is said to have a broken leg. Though usually of vile temper, he has had a specially good relationship with a local shaman who would dive down at a certain spot to meet the serpent and solicit his help in procuring rain. Others rather avoided this part of the river as Nginin habitually would pull people down with his invisible hook lindjir. (Getting on in age Nginin is said to have quietened down in recent years.) Stories are told of several accidents involving drovers and their cattle being drowned by Nginin whenever they at- tempted to cross the river through a ford not far from Ligil. One such story ran that during the crossing an obviously irritated Nginin swallowed several head of cattle and then performed his master stunt: when the head drover, a half caste, who earlier on had ridiculed Aboriginal super- stition, emerged from the water it turned out that Nginin had taken his saddle from under him. At another time, two white men noisily ferried down the Fitzroy River in a dinghy, shooting at crocodiles all the while. Enraged about the noise Nginin hooked the boat, hoisted it downriver and drowned the noisy group. Apart from the fact that apparently actual events of past and present are being connected with the doings of the water serpent - the myth forming a model by which to perceive and interpret experience - the interesting datum here is that it is not necessarily smell that angers the serpent. As the Nginin myth expressly relates, it is excessive noise - as much as improper, unlawful behaviour - that may invite the catastrophe. The myth rather flatly rebuts Buchler's thesis on the olfactory excellence of the Rainbow Serpent and his antag- onism to foul odours. True, the Wawelak sisters were swallowed because of bad smells. But the olfactory and acoustic codes are not opposing each other; rather they are interchangeable, or perhaps complementing each other. It seems the danger inherent in the structuralist endeavour to uncover the skeins of the mythical imagination, is sometimes to attribute exaggerated importance to detail which plays only a minor role in the myth's total fabric and so lose sight of the larger pattern behind it all. I think the image of the Rainbow Serpent mainly spins out no more or no less than the eternal Shiva- Vishnu constellation, couched in the Aboriginal idiom of thought. I am not surprised to find creation so close to destruction - either purposeful destruction to safeguard the world order or unfocused whimsical destruction. To speculate on this and on why this cosmological problem should have become associated with snakes, rainbows and water should be an intriguing business, perhaps warranting a sequel to Buchler's and Maddock's book.
