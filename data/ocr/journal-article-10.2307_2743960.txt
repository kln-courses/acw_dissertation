In discussing the mega- lithic art of Brittany, he has taken a diachronic perspec- tive, and in doing so he has touched on the more general question of the relationships between changing monu- mental and ritual traditions and changing social forma- tions. Recent research in Brittany has resulted in a num- ber of important discoveries which may provide a broader cultural and chronological context for the devel- opments identified by Bradley. The sites he discusses (Gavrinis, the Camac tumuli, Le Grand Menhir Brise, et al.) are by no means typical of monuments in the Ar- morican area as a whole: rather, they form part of a unique ritual landscape centered on the Golfe du Morbi- han and the estuaries immediately to the west (fig. 1). The most recent discoveries in Brittany may shed some light on the evolution of this unique complex of sites and, by extension, on the social processes underlying the development of the monumental traditions of the Ar- morican Neolithic. Recent excavations by Jean L'Helgouac'h and Serge Cassen at Locmariaquer have revealed evidence for an early ritual complex sealed beneath the cairn of the Table des Marchands passage grave. This complex in- cludes a series of carved menhirs, of which Le Grand Menhir Brise is one. A second menhir, with a carved anthropomorphic motif and a series of "shepherds' crooks," was left in situ when the passage grave was built and incorporated as the back stone of this monu- ment (L'Helgouac'h, personal communication). The cap- stone of the Table des Marchands passage grave is a frag- ment of another menhir: conjoining fragments from the same stone have been identified (Le Roux 1984) as cap- stones on the chamber of the "Camac tumulus" of Er- Grah (adjacent to La Table des Marchands)and on the passage grave of Gavrinis, 4 km away. This menhir has carvings representing two bovids, a "crook," a hafted axe, and an "axe plough" (fig. 2), and it seems likely that it originally formed part of the Locmariaquer complex. The passage graves of Mane-Rutal and Mane-Lud, which lie within half a kilometre of La Table des Marchands, also incorporate reused menhirs (L'Helgouac'h 1983) which are likely to have come from the Locmariaquer complex. Bradley follows Shee Twohig (1981) in iden- tifying two phases in Armorican megalithic art, and the essentially naturalistic carvings found on the Locmaria- quer menhirs are all typical of the first phase. As Bradley notes, the motifs of this early phase (axes, bovids, "shep- herds' crooks," etc.) suggest a concern with contempo- rary subsistence developments. It may be of interest that a pottery vessel found in the pre-cairn horizon at La Table des Marchands is decorated with "crook" motifs exactly similar to those found on the menhirs. Following Renfrew (1976), we can perhaps see these men- hits as territorial markers, but their significance must surely have been deeper. Meillassoux (1967) stresses the significance of the time lapse between labour in- vestment and return in agricultural production and ar- gues that the labour involved in clearance and cultiva- tion creates intergenerational bonds of dependence, I. I am grateful to Jean L'Helgouac'h, Serge Cassen, and Joel Lecor- nec for discussing their research with me in some detail and for giving me access to unpublished material.

Kahn I 98 ). It is not difficult to see how in this context symbols such as the axe might take on a particular ritual or ceremonial significance. Bender (i985:55), in discussing the mechanisms by which such hierarchies are established and maintained, writes: "one way to do this is by controlling access to social or ritual knowledge deemed essential for initia- tion into adulthood and hence into marriage and eco- nomic independence. Another way is by controlling ac- cess to socially valued material items, also considered essential in social discourse." Such processes may pro- vide a context for the appearance of monumental sites in Brittany early in the 5th millennium B.C. As regards the control of access to "socially valued material items," we should perhaps note the emergence of stone-axe ex- change networks in Brittany at around the same time (Le Roux I979). The significance of the site of Er-Lannic (Le Rouzic I930), with its megalithic stone circles, as a pro- duction and distribution centre for fibrolite axes sug- gests a link between axe exchange and megalithic ritual, and this suggestion is strengthened by the importance of the axe as a motif in Armorican megalithic art. A major cultural transformation occurred in southern Brittany at the end of the 5th millennium B.C.: the carved menhirs of Locmariaquer were deliberately pulled down (L'Helgouac'h I983) and incorporated into the construction of passage graves. At Locmariaquer and at Le Petit Mont (Joel Lecornec, personal communica- tion) passage graves were built on top of earlier ritual complexes. Many of the motifs found on the carved menhirs of Locmariaquer are also found in the passage graves, suggesting a degree of continuity in ritual prac- tice. These symbols were now, however, taken into dark chambers separated from the outside world by passages and covered by massive cairns. Studies of megalithic art (Shee Twohig I98I) suggest that motifs became increas- ingly stylised: symbols whose meaning had been self- evident became accessible only to the initiated. All of the evidence suggests increasing restriction of participa- tion in ritual and access to ritual knowledge. Where hu- man remains are found in passage graves, they represent only a small number of individuals: only a limited num- ber of people were given access to the monuments in death. This can be seen as evidence for an intensification of the social processes outlined above, with access to ritual knowledge becoming restricted as social relations became consolidated. It is perhaps in this context that we should understand the appearance of "entoptic" im- agery in the passage graves. The states of altered con- sciousness discussed by Lewis-Williams and Dowson may enable those individuals who have the means or the training necessary to achieve them to claim a privileged</page><page sequence="3">556 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY h , 0 1M FIG. .2.

The distribution of passage graves extends right around the coast of Brittany, and these monuments are by no means specific to the area around Carnac and the Golfe du Morbihan. The "Carnac tumuli" mentioned by Bradley are a different matter: this group includes only seven surviving monuments, all of which lie within a .2o-km radius of the town of Carnac. These tumuli are particularly massive: the largest is the Tumulus-St.- Michel at Carnac, i.25 m in length, 60 m in width, and IOo m in hi an circular,~ ~ ~ coe coe mglthccambrswiccn tain uman emais andlavis funrary eposiions These eposiions icludelarge umber of vaiscit 0 5CM FIG. 3.

The elaborate jadeite axes (fig. 3) are of a type never found in passage graves, though there are a number of hoards from the area around Carnac and Loc- mariaquer which include axes of this type (Le Rouzic I927). Given the massive scale of the cairns and the lavish and exclusive nature of the depositions found within them, it seems reasonable to suggest that the "Carnac tumuli" relate to high-status social groups. The rare items found within the chambers must have cir- culated within closed social networks, suggesting a lo- calised development of marked social differentiation. Whilst the precise chronology of the Carnac tumuli is uncertain, the evidence suggests a date in the first half of the 4th millennium B.C. (Giot, L'Helgouac'h, and Mon- nier I979) and therefore overlap with the passage graves. The passage grave of Gavrinis, in the Golfe du Morbi- han, is unique in several respects and seems to have had a specific association with the elite groups represented by the Carnac tumuli. Whilst carved motifs are known from a number of Breton passage graves (Shee Twohig I98I), Gavrinis is unique in that virtually all of the stones are elaborately decorated with motifs that com- pletely cover their surfaces. The carved motifs at Gav- rinis include representations (illustrated by Bradley) of the elaborate jadeite axes found in the "Carnac tumuli" (cf. fig. 3): although representations of axes are a regular feature of Armorican megalithic art, this is the only site where this particular form of axe is represented. It may also be significant that Gavrinis has by far the greatest</page><page sequence="4">Volume 31I, Number 5, December I990 1 557 concentration of "entoptic" motifs of any passage grave in the Armorican area and that such motifs occur almost exclusively in passage graves around the Golfe du Morbi- han (the recently discovered passage grave beneath the cairn of Le Petit Mont on the Arzon peninsula has a number of stones decorated with "entoptic" motifs sim- ilar to those at Gavrinis [Lecornec, personal communica- tion). In describing states of altered consciousness, Lewis-Williams and Dowson state that culturally signi- ficant motifs are often seen against a background of or surrounded by entoptic patterns, and this is precisely what one finds at Gavrinis (see, e.g., fig. 5c in Bradley's paper). Friedman and Rowlands (I977) present a model of so- cial dynamics in "tribal" societies whereby competitive feasting in the context of ritual activities may lead to the emergence of dominant groups with special status in- volving control of initiation rites and mediation be- tween the community and the supernatural (control of "the imaginary conditions of production"). Without nec- essarily accepting all of the implications of the Friedman and Rowlands model, we might suggest that such a de- velopment occurred in the area around the Golfe du Morbihan during the first half of the 4th millennium B.C. If we are thinking in terms of a powerful dominant group with special ritual status, it is tempting to include the Carnac alignments in our discussion, since these constitute a further unique and spectacular element in the Carnac/Golfe du Morbihan ritual landscape. Mega- lithic alignments do occur elsewhere in Brittany (Giot, L'Helgouac'h, and Monnier I979, Bender i986), but the alignments of Carnac clearly stand out by virtue of their scale and extent. The complex, which extends over 3 km, must originally have included over 3,000 individual standing stones arranged in three main alignments (Menec, Kermario, and Kerlescan). The alignments are associated with massive stone circles: Burl (i985) sug- gests that as many as a thousand people could have stood comfortably in one of these circles, and it seems likely that the complex was a focus for very large gatherings of people. The problem with relating the alignments to the other monuments in the area is essentially a chron- ological one. Although the Carnac alignments are con- ventionally dated to the Late Neolithic period (Giot, L'Helgouac'h, and Monnier I979), this is largely because the Kermario alignment runs over the Manio long bar- row, which has been thought to be of Middle Neolithic date but should probably be assigned to the Early Neo- lithic (ca. 4500-4000 B.C. [cf. Kinnes and Hibbs I989]). Recent excavations at St.-Just, Ille-et-Vilaine, have pro- vided evidence for the construction of megalithic align- ments during the first half of the 4th millennium B.C., and in the light of the recent evidence the chronology of the Carnac alignments should perhaps be reconsidered. If the destruction of the carved menhirs of Locmaria- quer, the appearance of the Carnac tumuli (and perhaps also the alignments), and the passage grave of Gavrinis, with its elaborate carvings including "entoptic" imag- ery, can be seen as part of a single social phenomenon, then this phenomenon was both localised and short- lived. The construction of the "Carnac tumuli" seems to have ceased in the mid-4th millennium B.C., and the distinctive material-culture package associated with these monuments disappeared. The construction of pas- sage graves seems to have ceased right across the Ar- morican region in the third quarter of the 4th millen- nium B.C., and whilst some passage graves remained open and continued to be used for several centuries after this, others, including Gavrinis,2 were sealed and aban- doned. The new forms of megalithic monument which proliferated across the Armorican region in the latter half of the 4th millennium B.C. (gallery graves and lat- eral-entrance graves) have a simpler organisation of space than the passage graves (cf. Giot, L'Helgouac'h, and Monnier I979). The soils of Brittany are predomi- nantly acidic, and skeletal remains are rarely preserved: farther east in Normandy, however, monuments of the same type have been found to contain the remains of several hundred people, suggesting that access to these monuments was less restricted. Art in these Late Neolithic monuments is relatively rare, but where it is found it is quite different to that of the passage graves (Shee Twohig I98I). Most of the carvings found in the gallery graves are explicitly representational, the most common motifs being hafted axes and a female an- thropomorph stylised as a pair of breasts and a necklace. Entoptic motifs are conspicuous by their absence. The sequence outlined above suggests a localised emergence of marked social differentiation in southern Brittany at the end of the 5th millennium B.C. The ap- pearance of entoptic imagery in Breton megalithic art is closely tied to this development, both geographically and chronologically. With the collapse of this complex in the second half of the 4th millennium B.C., entoptic images disappear from the repertoire of Armorican meg- alithic art. References Cited BENDER, B. I985 .
