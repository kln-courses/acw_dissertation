Slough, Assistant Curator, Ancient Art, Detroit Institute of Arts The making of glass began almost forty-five hundred years ago and recipes for it exist that are twenty-seven hundred years old. Formulas for creating glass appear inscribed in the cuneiform writing of ancient Meso- potamia on a clay tablet preserved in the library of Assurbanipal, King of Assyria from 668 to 663 B.C. One of the recipes begins, "Whenever they inform you (that the time is right), you set up the Kubu-images within two double hours. You sacrifice a sheep. You make offerings to the dead masters. You collect the sifted materials into a mold; you put it into the [ ] kiln." These preliminary instructions reveal a great deal about the history of this ancient craft. In the seventh century B.C., mention of the dead masters indicates a long tradition for glassmaking, thought by scholars to go back to the beginning of the third millennium B.C. To speak of sacrifices and Kubu-images indicates the element of chance and the lack of certainty involved in the manufacture of glass and the need for supernatural assistance. The Kubu deities, who were possibly related to the technological use of fire, may have performed a magical function for the glassmaker, who hoped to please these divine spirits with a sacrifice.

Over the years, the collection has grown to over one hundred vessels, beads, and gaming pieces, as well as fragments of various kinds of inlays. The earliest piece dates from the Egyptian New Kingdom (ca. 1550-1080 B.C.) and the latest was made in the area of the eastern Mediterranean some- time during the sixth through the eighth cen- tury A.D. Although a few of the works were created as expensive luxury items, most of the pieces were intended for everyday household use. All of the pieces exhibit a level of cultural sophistication that make them seem products of today's world. Archaeological excavation in the Near East, particularly in Egypt, Syria, and Iraq, has yielded some of the products of the earliest glassmakers: beads and fragments of decora- tion probably intended for inlay in both buildings and in small, rich pieces of household furnishing.2 The craftsman's pur- pose was to create red and blue opaque glass in imitation of the semi-precious stones carnelian and lapis lazuli and thus provide a more accessible substitute for materials that were rare and imported from the mountains to the east, in present-day Iran and Afghanistan. These pieces of glass designed to imitate stones date to the middle of the third millennium B.C. and appear to be the earliest examples of a custom that has re- mained alive through antiquity to medieval and modern times. Glass was used as a material for vessels as early as the late sixteenth/ekrly fifteenth century B.C. Evidence derived from excava- tions and textual sources suggests that such vessels appeared first in western Asia- the land occupied by the Hurrians and the kingdom of Mitanni, which lies in present- Figure 4.

However, present opinion holds that glassmaking, and perhaps glass- makers themselves, came to Egypt from western Asia at the time when Egypt was expanding its political borders north and west under the pharoah Thutmoses III (1490-1439 B.C.) and his successors of the Eighteenth Dynasty.4 In both western Asia and Egypt, the first vessels were produced by a process called core-forming. The Detroit Institute of Arts possesses several examples of containers made by this technique. Knowledge of the vessels and their method of manufacture comes from excavations, ancient texts, and also the study of, and experimentation in, modern glassmaking techniques.5 Experi- ments undertaken in the last thirty years have shown that a specific result can be achieved by various methods, so any descrip- tions of ancient techniques must be general and open to modification. The same generality applies to the composition of a given piece of glass. In the most basic terms, glass is composed of sand and an alkali in the form of plant ash. These ingredients are heated together to the point of fusion. The desired colors, opacity, or transparency are obtained by the addition of mineral elements. All of these component parts are enormously variable. 35</page><page sequence="5">A small blue amphoriskos (fig. 2a), dating from the sixth to the fourth century B.C., in the museum's collection is an example of the core-forming method of glass manufacture. A roughly cylindrical or rounded core of clay and dung was shaped over the end of a metal rod. Some lubrication or separating agent, so far unknown, was then placed over this core, so that the glass would not adhere solidly to it. Thick round threads of hot glass were trailed around this core to build up the form of the vessel. At the relatively low temperatures used in antiquity, the molten glass had considerable viscosity and also hardened quickly; however, it could be reheated, remelted, and reformed over and over, allowing it to be reworked until the desired size and shape were achieved. While still hot and workable, the vessel was marvered, or rolled smooth, on a flat stone. Thin trails of glass in different colors from that of the vessel were often added as decoration. These were marvered into the body and, as can be seen in the museum's example, pulled or combed to create wavy, feathered, or zig-zag patterns. The handles, made of trails of glass, were then attached at the shoulder and rim. The vessel together with its core was removed from the rod and placed in a subsidiary part of the oven to anneal, or cool slowly. When the vessel was cooled, the core would be scraped or drilled out, leaving the finished container ready for use.6 Containers like this core-formed amphoriskos have a long history in the Near East. The Detroit Institute of Arts also possesses a rim fragment from a black and white palm-column flask with a yellow lip (fig. 3a), dating from the Egyptian New Kingdom. The palm-column flask, like the amphoriskos, is a tall, narrow cylinder, but with a flat bottom and a fringed top resembling a palm tree. Both the early columnar-shaped flasks and the later forms that imitate specific Greek pottery shapes were small containers used for cosmetic substances such as perfumed oils, cleans- ing lotions, and healing unguents. Glass vessels were considered luxury items used to hold luxury products.7 Glass beads made by the same core- formed process were created for a much broader market. Two beads in the museum's collection, a black and white "eye" bead (fig. 3b) and a dark blue, yellow, and white bead in the shape of a grotesque head (fig. 3c), are examples of popular Phoenician trade items. These types of beads were produced along the Syrian/Lebanese coast and in North Africa and have been found in great numbers. They are decorated in many colors with trails and dots of glass and may have had a magical significance for the wearer, who hoped the bead would ward off ill luck.8 From the beginning of glassmaking, another technique, the molding of glass, was in use side by side with the core- forming method. Early amulets and pen- dants were made by pressing soft glass into open molds, probably with a wooden tool. By the Hellenistic period (323-30 B.C.), both simple and very intricate vessels were being molded. Molds, probably ceramic, although possibly wood, were made in two, three, and four parts, and hinged together. While the containers were still intended for a luxury market, this method allowed for a limited form of mass production of a number of vessels from the same mold. Figure 5.

This ancient method, using metal molds and gas-fired furnaces, is employed today for the manufacture of some art glass. A mosaic glass bowl (fig. 2c) is an example of one of the most popular styles of molded glass dating from the first century B.C. to the second century A.D. These bowls were made by a complex and time-consuming process that can be seen as a natural pro- gression from the core-forming technique. The same thick threads of glass used to build up the core-formed vessels were formed into solid canes of glass of various colors. These canes were then gathered into bundles in a wide range of patterns. The bundle was fused by heating into one large cane, with each color and design still intact, and then drawn out into a long rod, thus miniaturizing the design. When the rod cooled, it could be sliced into small rounds, which looked rather like a cross- section of a multi-colored carrot. The round cane slices were then set into a bowl-shaped mold of ceramic or wood, completely lining it. Patterned slices were interspersed with slices of a solid color matrix. A solid inner mold was fitted over the slices to retain the bowl shape, and the whole placed in the oven at a temperature carefully calculated to fuse, but not melt, the component parts. As the bowl cooled, it shrunk away from the sides of the molds, thus enabling it to be easily removed. The edges were then ground on a lathe and the surface polished. The pattern on the museum's bowl, amber, white, and turquoise flowers on a dark blue ground, is an exam- ple of a technique called millefiori, a thousand flowers in Italian. The name was borrowed from very similar vessels made in Venice sixteen hundred years later. In addition to this type of floral design, many vessels display designs that imitate various stones with the veinings of marble, agate, and breccia, or with geometric designs of checkerboard or starred patterns. In all ex- amples of vessels made by mosaic techni- que, the design was built up of small cane slices set into a mold.9 Beginning in the Egyptian Ptolemaic period (323-30 B.C.), the same mosaic technique was used for inlays, such as two multi-colored strips (fig. 3g and 3h) that may have formed part of a decoration or a hieroglyphic inscription set into the sides of a wooden coffin. Later, from the first cen- tury B.C. through the first century A.D. during the Roman period, the technique was used in the production of beads (fig. 3k), gaming pieces (fig. 31), and floral pla- ques intended for inlay in furniture, walls, and small portable household items. The museum has a most attractive group of floral plaque fragments, which contain white, yellow, and red blossoms strewn across a medium green background. In a plainer vein are fragments of glass revet- ment plaques: a bi-chrome composite edg- ing strip (fig. 3f) and a solid, opaque green piece (fig. 3i), probably intended as inlay for a larger composite wall design. These would have been part of the decorations in richly appointed private houses. Glass was also used to enhance and highlight stone mosaic floors. Tiny bits of green glass enliven the surface of the museum's A Banquet in the Open Air (54.492), a floor mosaic which may have come from Ostia, the port of Rome, and dates to the fourth century A.D. Excavators at various sites in the Near East have recorded the use of 38</page><page sequence="8">glass in architectural decoration in the later part of the second millennium B.C. Such decoration probably goes back even further to the fourth-millennium B.C. stone ornamentation found in a zigzag pattern on temple columns from Warka (biblical Uruk) in southern Iraq.10 Perhaps the most sophisticated example of a mosaic glass inlay in the Detroit Institute of Arts collection is the cane slice that forms one half of a satyr mask (fig. 3j). The cane was produced in the same manner as the floral designs. In this case, the half-face was constructed of various colored rods surrounded by opaque green rods. The whole was heated to the point of fusion, then pulled out, and the sides squared off. When cool, it was sliced. Two slices would be used to form the complete face. This very complicated type of orna- ment, which often depfcts traditional Greek theater masks, seems to have been produc- ed from the first century B.C. to the first century A.D., possibly in Egypt under Roman influence or in Rome itself. These inlays, used singly or in bands, were pro- bably decoration for small objects such as shrines, caskets, or pieces of furniture.1 1 All of the glass discussed thus far has been multi-colored and opaque. Although monochrome and translucent glass was made in Hellenistic times, it was not until the first century B.C. that tastes appeared to change toward an appreciation of clearer glass. It is tempting to speculate that, after hundreds of years of using glass as a substitute for, or in imitation of, other more precious materials - stone, gems, even metal, an awareness of the inherent beauty of glass had developed. A hemispherical bowl from the Hellenistic period (fig. 4), recently acquired by the museum, is an example of this facet of ancient glass- making. The bowl, probably made in the area of the eastern Mediterranean between the second and first centuries B.C., is translucent light green in color. It was made by pressing and tooling soft, workable glass into a mold, then firing it with another mold, in the shape of the bowl's interior, used to hold the glass in place. It is the same method employed to create mosaic bowls. When the bowl had cooled, the rim was smoothed on a lathe, and two decorative rings were engraved around the outside just below the rim. The surfaces were then polished. Another piece of molded, translucent glass in the museum's collection is a ribbed bowl of dark blue (fig. 2b). It was made in the same way as the hemispherical bowl, but using a ribbed mold, perhaps to create an imitation of a metal vessel. This style of bowl, made from the first century B.C. to the first century A.D. in a wide range of colors and found from Syria to England, was one of the most popular of the early Roman period and existed side by side with a growing range of transparent and colorless glass vessel designs.12 Another example of mold-pressed translu- cent glass is a medallion in the form of a theater mask (fig. 5a), which once adorned the bottom of the handle of a large vessel, probably a pitcher. Many of these heads- some animal, some anthropomorphic - have been discovered broken away from the handle. Whole vessels with the medallions in place make it clear that the glassmakers faithfully copied the sharp angles and crisp ornamentation in high relief characteristic of metal vessels. The medallion heads seem to date to the first and second centuries A.D.13 The molded bowls and medallions were part of an expanding body of luxury tableware that Figure 8.

Until the first century B.C., all glass had antecedents in technique and purpose that reached back to the third and second millennia B.C. At some time in the first century B.C., glassmaking was revolution- ized by the technique of blowing glass. At present, it is believed that this discovery probably took place in the area of the eastern Mediterranean, possibly in Syria.14 The glob of molten glass was taken from the fire on a hollow rod. By blowing into the open end of the rod, the glob of glass was expanded either into a mold or freely, like a soap bubble, then shaped with a paddle and marvered into any desired form. The vessel could be reheated fre- quently during the shaping process, and rims and bases were pulled out or added. Handles and trailed decoration could also be added. All of this could be done in a few minutes, making true mass production of an unlimited variety of shapes and sizes of glass vessels possible. Glass now became a common and inexpensive commodity rather than a luxury item. Glass vessels not only became ordinary household ware but shipping and storage containers for many liquids. The glass was more often than not translucent and frequently of a blue-green color, which is the color of glass before natural impurities are removed. The preference for clearer, lighter colored glass is evident when one looks at the surviving works in glass. The range of colors is amber, purple, red, blue, green, yellow, and colorless. Handles and trailed decora- tion were added in both the body color and in other colors. The Detroit Institute of Arts has a group of such vessels, both mold- blown and free-blown, in a variety of shapes, ranging in date from the first cen- tury A.D. to the sixth through the eighth century. These often-fragile vessels come from the eastern Mediterranean or Egypt and owe their preservation to their use as furnishings for the grave, providing the deceased with food, drink, lamp oil, and perfumes. The art of glass blowing traveled very quickly from the eastern end of the Mediterranean to Rome and northward into Roman Europe, but unfortunately Detroit's collection does not contain examples of Roman glass from northern Europe. One of the handsomest pieces of mold- blown glass in Detroit is a transparent amber beaker with lotus bud bosses (fig. 2d). This type is well represented in collec- tions on this continent and in Europe. Always transparent, the glass for these beakers varies in color from amber through yellow to a blue-green; they range in size from roughly eleven to twenty centimeters in height. All, however, were produced by the same technique: blowing the glass into a three-part mold with a crisply defined pattern. This type of vessel was apparently a very popular piece of first-century tableware and must have been produced in large quantities.15 Another vessel form, perhaps even more popular, is the so-called head flask (fig. 5d). This small vessel, blown in a two-part mold, was created in the form of two heads placed back to back. It seems to have first appeared in the late first or early second century and continued in various forms in- to the fourth century. Detroit's example was crafted to resemble the heads of two boys, but other vessels of the same type were made in the form of two Negroid heads, a male head and a female head, Medusa heads, or as the Roman god Janus, who has an old face looking to the past and a young face looking toward the future. These small vials probably contained a perfumed oil or similar cosmetic. The museum's piece has the added luster of a colorful iridescence, a bonus for the modern viewer, produced as a result of the partial decay of the glass from long burial in damp earth. Its original color is totally obscured under the iridescence.16 A container of the same size and probably used for the same cosmetic purpose is a transparent pale amethyst two-handled vial (fig. 5e). The vertically ribbed vessel was Figure 9. Roman from Syria, Globular Flask, 4th century A.D.; free-blown glass, h. 26 x diam. 16 cm (10% x 65/16 in.).

A squat, thick-walled aryballos (fig. 13) also would have contained oil or unguent. These aryballoi were used by athletes, who carried them around their wrists, supported by metal loops attached to the small glass handles. A clear rod of twisted glass (1987.52), quite reminiscent of a swizzle stick, was used to dip the cosmetic preparation out of the small- mouthed containers and to apply it.17 The museum's collection contains two mold-blown vessels dating to the first century A.D. that apparently reflect the glassmakers' continuing desire to copy a metal prototype. One is a greenish translu- cent cup blown in a thr&amp;e-part mold with three bands of crisp horizontal decoration (fig. 5b and title page). The gadrooning on the shoulder and on the lower band is a motif frequently found on metalwork. The central section is filled with a sharply defined design of stylized palm branches, alternatingly right side up and upside down, a motif found in both metal- and stonework. There is good reason to sup- pose that this type of cup was designed for festive occasions. A veify similar cup in the collection of the Toledo JVluseum of Art has as its central band not palm branches, but an inscription in Greek that reads "rejoice that you have come."18 The second vessel in Detroit is an oenochoe of blue trans- parent glass (fig. 5c and tide page), again made in a three-part mold with gadrooning on the shoulder and around the bottom of the botde. The center band is divided into six vertical panels, each filled with an ob- ject in raised relief. The objects are rather enigmatic and may refer to a celebration connected with the cult of the god Dionysus. The pitcher with its applied han- dle would have contained a precious liquid, either for a ritual or a cosmetic purpose.19 Vessels blown free, without a mold, obviously provide the glassmaker with enormous potential for endless variations in shape and size, and, for the first eight centuries of the Christian era, a vast and changing inventory of containers ballooned out from the glassblowers' rods. The Detroit Institute of Arts possesses a small but attractive sampling of free-blown vessels intended for the table, for the storage of food and liquids, for cosmetic oils and perfumes, possibly for medicines, and for a lighting fixture. It is, however, dif- ficult to date them precisely. Shapes designed to serve specific uses, such as bowls, cups, and flasks, changed subdy and slowly over the first four centuries of the Christian era. A few types disappeared, a few new ones emerged, but there was a continuity in household wares that results in dates for objects with as broad a range as two hundred years. For example, an ear- ly type may be dated the first to the third century A.D. or a somewhat later one dated from the second to the fourth cen- Figure 11.

Survival of treasured vessels and the per- sistence of types in remote areas must also be taken into consideration. The vessels in the museum's collection date from the first to the fourth century and are all from the area of the eastern Mediterranean. Much of the glass is plain and practical, though well-proportioned with pleasing lines: a very thin-walled, colorless, transparent drinking cup with pinched-in sides to make it easier to hold (fig. 7c); a flat dish with an out-turned rim (fig. 7b); a small footed bowl (fig. 7a); a small cylindrical container in the shape of a medicine bottle (fig. 8c); a graceful flask with a narrow neck and flaring mouth (fig. 8b); a large carafe with a tall neck- the lower part straight for ease in grasping, the upper part flared for ease in pouring (fig. 9); and a large, elegantly curved footed bowl (fig. 6).20 A bedroom from a villa that stood in Boscoreale, near Pompei, in the first century A.D. and has been reassembl- ed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York), offers charming evidence as to how this last bowl may have been used in antiquity. The walls of the room are painted with vistas of palaces and landscapes. On the narrow window wall, a clear glass bowl filled with fruit is pictured resting on a low parapet enclosing an orchard beyond (fig. 10). The shape of the painted bowl (fig. 11) is almost the same as that of the Detroit bowl. One of the most elegantly shaped vessels among the museum's tableware is a clear very pale green pitcher (fig. 14) with a slender silhouette, a small base, and a Figure 13.

A double flask, or unguentarium, with an arching handle (fig. 12 a) also had a cosmetic function.

Perhaps one of the most appealing such vessels to the modern eye is a jar of clear aubergine glass (fig. 16) that dates to the end of the Roman period or the beginning of the Byzantine period. Its squat shape with nine irregular "dimples" pressed into the body, together with its color, make it as handsome an example today of the glass- blower's art as it must have been fifteen hundred years ago.21 Some free-blown glass pieces, destined for less frequent use, were treated more elaborately. A small flask of colorless transparent glass (fig. 8a) is decorated with very fine threads of colorless glass wound around the body and neck. A small globular blue-green translucent jar with a wide, flat rim (fig. 12b) has an embellish- ment of glass threads the same color as the body applied in a zigzag pattern from rim to shoulder. A tall blue-green translucent vial (fig. 15) is exuberantly decorated with two trails of the same colored glass forming two handles that ripple down the sides in a crimped riband.22 These three containers 43</page><page sequence="13">Figure 16. Roman, Jar, 4th-5th century A.D.; free-blown glass, h. 9.2 x diam. 10.2 cm (3% x 4yi6 in.). Gift of A. Alfred Taubman (1987.51). collection contains others with multi-color threaded decoration and scalloped handles. These vessels pale in comparison to many in other collections that are decorated with astonishing flamboyance. The number of these unguentaria pre- served today suggests a large production in ancient times and an enormous popularity for the form.23 Another type of free-blown vessel in the museum's collection was designed specifically to hold lamp oil and a wick. The conical, colorless, translucent con- tainer with a series of bright blue glass "teardrops" applied to the exterior as decoration (fig. 12c) is part of a polycandelon. A number of these glass containers would have been set into metal rings arranged in a frame, which was then suspended by chains from the ceiling of a large public space as an early chandelier.24 The latest example of ancient glass in the museum's collection is a vessel dating to sometime during the sixth through the eighth century A.D. This transparent blue- green hexagonal container with two trailed handles (fig. 1) was mold-blown and then expanded by further blowing after it was removed from the mold. The pattern of alternating lozenges, palm branches, and lattice design on its six sides was blurred by the expansion, thus losing its definition. The decoration appears to be secular; however, vessels of this same type were produced with both Jewish and Christian symbols.25 The period between five hundred and seven hundred A.D. was a time of transi- tion. The empire of the Romans had vanished; the empire of the Byzantines was shrinking toward the area around its capital city of Constantinople; and a new power, the Muslims, was rising in the Near East. Gradually, the shapes in glass altered, from ancient forms to medieval ones, but the techniques remained constant. The process of making glass by blowing continued in Europe and the Near East into medieval times, although production was reduced to a trickle by political upheavals in both areas during the ninth to the fourteenth centuries. Knowledge of the technology, however, was not lost. The glass industry was reborn in the Islamic glass centers of Syria and Egypt in the tenth and eleventh centuries. The skills were carried west to Venice in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries when the glass production of Ayyubid Syria reached its zenith. From Venice, the techniques spread to the rest of Europe and the New World. The same method as was used in Roman times is used today to produce art glass and luxury tableware. The chemistry is more precise in the twentieth century; less is left to chance. A modern glassmaker does not sacrifice a sheep on a favorable day and place juniper incense on the censer,26 but, technologically speaking, he is standing on the shoulders of the masters who perhaps lived thirty-five hundred years before him.
