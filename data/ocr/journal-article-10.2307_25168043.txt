<plain_text><page sequence="1">Art and Artifacts of the 18th Century. By roland w. force and maryanne force. Honolulu, Bishop Museum Press, 1968. vii, 232 pp., bibliog. $U.S. 12.50. Artifacts, like manuscripts, are invaluable for reconstructing the details of pre-European cultures of the Pacific. This monograph presents a manuscript on artifacts: Sarah Stone's drawings and water-colours of Cook artifacts from Polynesia, Melanesia and the North west Coast (plus some non-Pacific items) which were displayed in London's Leverian Museum in the 1780s. Assembled and housed at ruinous expense by Sir Aston Lever, these artifacts were sold in 1786 upon his financial failure, and many have subsequently been lost. It is therefore fortunate than in 1783 Lever commissioned Sarah Stone to render these artifacts, and that Roland and Maryanne Force have been able to locate and reproduce her renderings for general circulation in book form. Some clubs, spears, paddles, head rests, bowls and food pounders from Fiji, New Caledonia, Tonga, New Zealand, Tahiti and the Cook Islands are illustrated, but the bulk of the Pacific Islands artifacts shown in this book come from Hawaii. These include numerous examples of various weapons, adzes, ornaments, bowls and anthropomorphic figures, all done in half-tone as are the non-Hawaiian artifacts. Only a few of these are particularly appealing as illustrations or as records of significant ethnographic specimens. The other Hawaiian illustrations are, however, of another genre: Sarah Stone's water colours of feather cloaks, capes, god images, helmets, lei, kahili and other examples of Hawaiian featherwork, as well as her renderings of some of the birds from which the feathers were taken, are at once attractive and informative. This magnificent pictorial record of Hawaiian featherwork is especially valuable as most of the 54 illustrated speci mens no longer survive. Since the water-colours all depict genuine Cook artifacts, they provide the most complete record of the state of this once highly developed art as it was before outside influences could have altered it and show, for example, a wider range of colour and design dian might ordinarily be ascribed to pre-European Hawaiian feather work. In particular, the extensive use of green feathers of various shades, as well as white, black and even amethyst-coloured ones, indicated in these water-colours may come as a surprise to those used to thinking of Hawaiian featherwork solely in terms of the brilliant reds and yellows of the regal capes and cloaks displayed at the Bishop Museum and a few other institutions around the world.
