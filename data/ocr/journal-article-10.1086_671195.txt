      <p>The concept of Oceania and the racial classification of its peoples have a well-documented past, one extending into the mid-eighteenth century. The terms “Melanesian” and “Polynesian” as different categories based largely on skin color, but with grossly inferred behavioral traits and cultural institutions, originate early within this history (Douglas 2008<italic>a</italic>; Terrell, Kelley, and Rainbird 2001; Thomas 1989). In 1832, the French naval commander and naturalist Jules-Sébastien-César Dumont d’Urville proposed a four-part division of the “Great Ocean” into Polynesia, Micronesia, Melanesia, and Malaysia, drawing upon previous schemes and his own observations. He clearly recognized the considerable variation in language, culture, and physical traits across this vast region. He opined nevertheless that there were but two races of people, “the Melanesian race, which is itself only a branch of the black race from Africa, and the swarthy or coppery Polynesian race, which is only an offshoot of the yellow race from Asia” (Dumont d’Urville 2003:173). Described by Douglas (2008<italic>b</italic>:124), he “adjudged Melanesians to be ‘hideous’ in appearance, ‘limited’ in languages and institutions, and ‘generally very inferior’ to the copper-coloured race in dispositions and intelligence.” Now stripped of the “brutally negative caricature of Melanesians” and its racist underpinnings, Dumont d’Urville’s regional divisions have become part of an international terminology, one accepted and “naturalized” in their usage by contemporary Pacific Island peoples (Douglas 2008<italic>b</italic>:124).</p>
      <p>Dumont d’Urville drew his divide between Melanesia and Polynesia through the ocean gap separating Fiji and Tonga. It was the boundary not so much because Fijians characteristically were Melanesian; they, in fact, were recognized as different, a circumstance he explained by their “frequent contacts with the Polynesian race” (Dumont d’Urville 2003:169–170). At the same time, Fijians were not Polynesian! Polynesians were a homogeneous entity, sharing not only a common set of physical features but language, social/political institutions, and cultural traits across a very broad spectrum of island archipelagoes in the South Pacific. They were presumed to be the product of a common ancestry, an ancestry divorced from the collective of peoples in Melanesia, including Fiji. Dumont d’Urville’s Melanesian/Polynesian divide is not without controversy, especially in its emphasis on differences that may or may not exist (Clark 2003; Thomas 1989), in the sheer simplicity of the construct (Terrell, Kelley, and Rainbird 2001), and in the associated use of concepts subtly or sometimes explicitly imbued with racist implications (Ballard 2008). At the same time, phenotypic and cultural differences (not the explanations for) observed by Dumont d’Urville in framing his boundary persist in a general if not exclusive sense. As a walk through the downtown markets of Suva (Fiji) and Nuku’alofa (Tonga) attest, Fijians do not look like Tongans, and most Tongans would not be mistaken as Fijians. This visual distinctiveness is a dominating agent in the naturalization and continued use of the Melanesian/Polynesian dichotomy in Tonga and Fiji today. It also speaks to divergent historical pasts.</p>
      <p>Archaeological, linguistic, biological, anthropological, and genetic research over the past half century provides a degree of insight into the deep history of Oceania and its varied paths (see Kirch 2000; Lilley 2006). The “Lapita peoples” (after Kirch 1997) began moving eastward from the Bismarck Archipelago off the north New Guinea coast sometime after 3200 BP, ultimately arriving in Fiji by no later than 3000 BP and in Tonga/Samoa a century and a half thereafter (Burley, Weisler, and Zhao 2012; Clark and Anderson 2009<italic>b</italic>; Nunn 2007; see fig. 1).<sup>1</sup> A common ancestry thus has long been assumed for Fijian and Tongan peoples, phenotypic and cultural variations notwithstanding. As an archaeologist working in Fiji and Tonga over the past 2 decades, that assumption has not sat easy. If Tongans and Fijians are derived from common stock, how, then, did Fijians become Fijian, and why are they not Polynesian? Here I attempt to address this question, highlighting a polygenesis of events and cultural interactions with impacts on the archipelago’s historical trajectory. I argue first that an underlying basis for cultural, linguistic, and phenotypic variation across the Melanesian (Fiji)/Polynesian (Tonga) divide begins with first colonization. Separate founder events, it is proposed, resulted in discrete populations who developed and participated in quite different interaction spheres. As suggested by one reviewer, this might equally or better explain the complementary question of why Polynesian’s are Polynesian and not Fijian. Yet separate founder events are not the only processes at work. Fiji has a complex history of external interactions and/or outright immigration as reflected in the archaeological record and continuing into the early historic era. These events, I argue, are of equal importance to the polygenesis of Fijian society and its people.<fig id="fg1" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <title>Defining Fijian/Polynesian Variability and Its Implications for Archaeological Interpretation</title>
         <p>Nicholas Thomas, in a <italic>Current Anthropology</italic> article (1989), abrasively challenges the veracity of Melanesia and Polynesia as meaningful constructs, rooting them in a racist historical past, with retention only as erroneous survivals within a no longer practiced evolutionary anthropology. To Thomas (1989:27), the division is but a “discredited ethnology question,” as social scientists no longer concern themselves with “relationships between proximate societies, the causes of a degree of similarity or dissimilarity, and the distinctiveness of certain regions.” Green (1989:35) appropriately responds that the latter claims may be “puzzling” to some, for understanding cultural boundaries that derive from “the time and space of prehistory” provide diachronic foundation to contemporary cultural configurations. It is conceded here that Fijians are not representative of some pan-Melanesian cultural template, if such a construct can be defined as more than a set of “creolized” cultures (Spriggs 1997:12). At the same time, critical aspects of Fijian society have parallels in other areas of Melanesia, as opposed to Polynesia. Knowing when, why, and how Fijians came to be Fijian, and how they came to vary from cultures of West Polynesia on their border is indeed a meaningful pursuit.</p>
         <p>Dumont d’Urville’s observations of Melanesian and Polynesian physical features were structured by nineteenth-century concepts of race—Melanesians including Fijians had dark skin with tightly curled hair, among other traits; Polynesians were “coppery” toned with straighter hair and different features. Biological anthropologists through the early to mid-twentieth century continued to seek phenotypic variation defining racial classifications within Oceania. In a 1954 study of 815 males from different areas of Fiji, Gabel (1958) attempted to describe a Fijian phenotype, drawing comparisons with adjacent Melanesian and Polynesian populations, as well as assessing trait variability across the archipelago. Based on a wide range of anthropometric and other data, he (1958: 25) found Fijians to have an “essentially Melanesian character” but with some “Polynesian affinities.” The Polynesian affinities were dominant in Lau, while people in the interior of Viti Levu were most like Melanesians. Gabel’s observations on Lau, a linear series of islands in southeastern Fiji, are not surprising, since this region has strong historic ties to Tonga that are well documented (Derrick 1950). Thompson (1940:7), a Lauan ethnographer, generally describes the people of Lau as “easily distinguished from the natives of Fiji proper and from the Tongans, but some individuals closely resemble the mountain people of Viti Levu while others look pure Tongan.” Others have emphasized an east/west division of phenotypic variation across Fiji, as well (Bellwood 1979; Kirk 1988; Trent et al. 1988).</p>
         <p>Phenotypic traits such as skin color or hair are nonexclusive and plastic, with considerable overlap within and between Fijian and West Polynesian peoples. The search for absolute phenotypes, whether Melanesian or Polynesian, not surprisingly has met with limited success or, at best, provides superficial results.<sup>2</sup> In more recent years, the concern for differentiation and how it has been configured across Oceania has shifted away from anatomy per se to genetics. Typically the questions being asked focus upon big picture issues—the genetic origins of Austronesian speaking peoples (ancestral Polynesians) in Oceania, the nature of interactions between Austronesian and the original Papuan-speaking peoples, and the ultimate characterization of the migration process under a fast train or slow boat model (Cox et al. 2007, 2010; Delfin et al. 2012; Friedlaender et al. 2008; Soares et al. 2011). In their attempts to understand the “Melanesian and Asian origins of Polynesians” employing Y chromosome (NYR) and mitochrondrial DNA markers, Kayser et al. (2006:2240) puzzlingly claim Fiji as “the most western islands of Polynesia” and incorporate their Fijian sample within the Polynesian data set. They subsequently illustrate Fiji as a very poor fit, concluding ultimately that Fijians have a much closer relationship with Melanesians than with Polynesians in their data. Wollstein et al. (2010) similarly focus on Fiji’s genetic history as a means to understand and assess its pivotal position for first Polynesian settlement. Based on the analysis of densely packed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPS), they illustrate “Fijians carry about 2 times more Near Oceanian [Melanesian] ancestry than do Polynesians … thereby suggesting substantial contact between Fiji and Near Oceania that did not extend to Polynesia” (Wollstein et al. 2010:1989). In their explanation of why Fijians are more closely related to Melanesians than Polynesians, these studies reach contradictory conclusions. That they independently illustrate an underlying, if not dominant, genetic relationship of Fijians to Melanesians, but with some Polynesian affinities, is critically telling.</p>
         <p>Phenotypic traits and genetic data do not stand alone in differentiating Fijians from Polynesians. Oliver (1989) and Kirch and Green (2001:65–70) identify a broad range of cultural distinctions from religious architecture to systems of descent. Notable among these are varied forms of kinship (Fiji, Dravidian; Polynesia, Hawaiian), settlement pattern (Fiji, nucleated and village-based; Polynesia, dispersed), and concepts of chieftainship. The latter is not a differentiation between big men and chiefs (Sahlins 1963). Rather, it is the basis, kind, and extent of power that a chief obtains. Kirch and Green (2001:69) thus center Polynesian chiefs within the institution of kingship and its subordinate hierarchy; the Tongan dynastic chiefdom, in fact, may be likened to an archaic state with its paramount chief, the Tui Tonga, at the apex of a highly structured, well-integrated, and expansive polity (Clark, Burley, and Murray 2008; also see Kirch 2010 on Hawaii). Fijian chiefs acquire privileges and more limited power through the position they hold as autonomous leaders of <italic>mataqali</italic> (land-holding units) or <italic>yavusa</italic> (local groups sharing common descent). Traditional political integration on a larger order in Fiji, prior to colonial rule, was accomplished through negotiation, confederation, and most frequently coercion (Derrick 1950:7–9).</p>
         <p>Historical linguistics provides a third line of evidence through which Fijian relationships to Polynesia on the east, and Melanesia to the west, may be evaluated. As typically modeled by linguists, Proto-Polynesian and Fijian subgroups derive from Proto-Central Pacific, a substage theoretically developing within and exclusive to Fiji, Rotuma, and West Polynesia (Geraghty 1983).<sup>3</sup> Fijian incorporates numerous dialects with some sharing less than 60% of basic vocabulary, a circumstance Pawley (2007:17) compares to the differences between English and German. Dialect fragmentation and diversification anticipates, in part, a complex history of political fractionation, localized autonomy, and relative isolation between groups. Fijian dialects fall into eastern or western subgroups, with variable associations across the archipelago resulting from earlier contacts and relationships (Geraghty 1983; Pawley and Sayaba 1971). More important to the question at hand, the external relationships for eastern and western groups are significantly revealing. In Geraghty’s (1983:389) estimation, “all western Fijian languages share more features exclusively with Melanesian than with Polynesian languages, while many eastern Fijian languages show little difference.” This schism parallels and expands upon implications for the previous east/west division of phenotypic variation.</p>
         <p>Fijian ties to Melanesia and Polynesia imply a lengthy history of interactions and cultural relations since initial colonization. This has been long recognized by anthropologists, linguists, biological anthropologists, archaeologists, and historians. The compilation of phenotype, Melanesian cultural features, and linguistic relations gave obvious proof to pre-1950 scholars that Fiji and Polynesia had been settled by separate races of people and that similarities between Fijians and Polynesians were the result of later mixing by a westward movement of Tongans and Samoans (Terrell 1986<italic>b</italic>:145). When archaeologists began identifying sites with Lapita pottery in Fiji and West Polynesia in the 1960s, and with recognition of some type of shared Lapita ancestry for both, this no longer seemed a tenable position (Kirch 2000). In a similar way, comparative studies in historical linguistics provided a highly ordered and integrated family tree for Austronesian speaking peoples east of the main Solomon Island group (Kirch and Green 2001:55). Kirch summarizes the resulting, and now orthodox, position for settlement of Fiji/West Polynesia, notwithstanding a more precise radiocarbon chronology for the event:<disp-quote>
               <p>The dispersal of some groups of Lapita pottery-making peoples from the southeastern Solomons and/or northern Vanuatu, across the 850-kilometer gap and on into the Fiji archipelago, occurred around 1200–1000 BC. While Fiji was the first archipelago encountered in this Eastern Lapita expansion, the Lau Islands and then the Tongan archipelago were also quickly discovered, explored, and colonized. Samoa too was settled by around 1000 B.C., as were the more isolated islands of Futuna, ‘Uvea and Niuatoputatapu. The similarities in Early Eastern Lapita ceramics on all of these islands, as well as direct evidence for transport of obsidian, chert, and stone adzes between communities, reveal a network of continuing communication between these newly founded settlements. Over time, however, “breaks” in this chain of Lapita communities arose, first between Fiji and Tonga, and later between Tonga and Samoa. (Kirch 2000:210)</p>
            </disp-quote>Kirch provides a “Wave of Advance” model, where demographic growth progressively fuels settlement expansion into adjacent frontiers to form a network of interrelated communities across the landscape (Fort 2003; Sheppard 2011). Fiji thus formed a genetic funnel through which a founder population or populations passed, providing “biological sameness” to many Fijians and Polynesians (Terrell, Kelley, and Rainbird 2001:103; also Kayser et al. 2006:2241–2242).</p>
         <p>The Wave of Advance model has a far-reaching and significant implication for Lapita prehistory across Oceania, one that is rarely discussed in detail in recent literature. West Polynesia was not just the end-run for Lapita peoples, but archaeology, linguistics, and specific cultural traits illustrate population continuity in Tonga from first Lapita settlement into the present without later in-migration (Burley 1998<italic>b</italic>; Kirch and Green 2001). Thus, according to Bellwood (1979:255), there is every “reason to assume that the physical type of the Lapita potters was similar to that of the Polynesians,” an assumption underlying recent interpretations of Fijian genetic data by Wollstein et al. (2010:1989). The idea of early Fijians as Polynesians was central to Green’s (1963) redevelopment of the Fijian archaeological sequence in 1963, with an initial phase defined as the “Early Proto-Polynesian Period.” Modern Fijians are “Melanesianized Polynesians” in the words of Howells (1973:96), a biological anthropologist. Spriggs (1997:99–100) continues this theme in his extensive synthesis of Melanesian prehistory, describing the original Fijian population as “more Polynesian in appearance” with subsequent “admixture with Island Melanesians.” The Lapita people, to Spriggs, are an immigrant Austronesian-speaking Southeast Asian group in the Bismarck Archipelago whose descendants incorporate two streams. The first is a pre-Polynesian stream representative of those who migrated across Oceania through Fiji to settle in West Polynesia. The second is the “stay at homes” who interbred with pre-Lapita peoples and whose phenotypic features were accordingly altered and then transferred. Melanesian peoples of the eastern Solomon Island outliers, Vanuatu and New Caledonia, who also trace their ancestry to initial Lapita settlement, by implication are a consequence of later immigration and intermarriage with peoples carrying Melanesian traits. More recently, and with a growing base of archaeological data, Bedford and Spriggs (2008) discount multiple migrations into northern Vanuatu through illustration of population continuity and regional diversification of ceramic styles in the post-Lapita era. Soares et al. (2011) also illustrate the complexities for and improbabilities of this type of scenario in their analysis of complete mtDNA genomes for a broad range of Oceanic groups.</p>

         <title>Fijian Polygenesis, Part 1: Founder Events, East/West Interaction Spheres, and the Structural Basis for a Melanesian/Polynesian Divide</title>
         <p>Lapita archaeology in Fiji and Tonga over the past 2 decades has accumulated a substantive data set to refute most aspects of the orthodox Lapita settlement model as given (fig. 2). It does so in two fundamental ways. First, there is evidence to indicate discrete founder events out of central Island Melanesia for Lapita colonization of Fiji and West Polynesia.<sup>4</sup> Second, and concomitantly, the data indicate separate if not isolated developmental histories for these regions during the ensuing millennium. Both are central to and provide the underlying structural basis for a Melanesian/Polynesian divide as stated in the introduction.<fig id="fg2" position="float" fig-type="figure">

         <p>The founder settlement for Fiji, as it presently appears, occurs at Bourewa on the southwest coast of Viti Levu. Identification of Bourewa as an initial landfall is based largely on a secure set of radiocarbon dates placing first settlement here in the interval 3000–3050 BP (Nunn 2007; Nunn et al. 2004). Lapita ceramics at Bourewa are typical of the western Lapita ceramic aspect characteristic of the Reef/Santa Cruz Islands and Vanuatu (Kirch 1997). This includes a complex series of decorative motifs, some with expanded zone markers and a central frieze, the use of finely applied and closely spaced dentate stamp, incision, and appliqué modeling for decoration, and a diverse range of forms including flat-bottom vessels and pedestal stands (Nunn 2007). Bourewa is ca. 900 km due east of Efate in Vanuatu, where the contemporaneous or slightly earlier Lapita settlement of Teouma occurs (Bedford, Spriggs, and Regenvanu 2006). Although perhaps not at Teouma, Bedford and Spriggs (2008:106) pointedly identify Vanuatu as the source locale from which Fijian Lapita peoples derive. Talasea obsidian from the Bismarck Archipelago was found at both Bourewa (Nunn 2007) and Teouma (Bedford, Spriggs, and Regenvanu 2006). The Bourewa sample is limited to a single piece, probably resulting from “heirloom effect” as defined by Sheppard (2011:804).</p>
         <p>An early Lapita presence in Fiji additionally is present 400 km sailing distance to the northeast of Bourewa, on the small offshore island of Vorovoro along the Vanua Levu coast. Radiocarbon dates and ceramic forms are all but identical to Bourewa (Burley 2012), suggesting an almost immediate exploration of Fiji out of the western Viti Levu founder colony. Vorovoro alternatively might indicate a separate migration and founder event in northern Fiji itself. During the ensuing period between 2850 and 2950 BP, the Lapita settlement landscape in Fiji begins to be filled. Additional Lapita sites with western-style Lapita ceramics occur on Viti Levu at Natunuku and Yanuca (Clark and Anderson 2009<italic>a</italic>), in the Koro sea area of central Fiji at Moturiki and Naigani islands (Irwin et al. 2011; Nunn et al. 2007), and again in northeastern Vanua Levu at Kevewa Island (Burley, unpublished data). Temper sand originating from Kadavu Island occurs in Lapita ceramics at Moturiki (Nunn et al. 2007), indicating a contemporaneous Lapita presence to the south. Finally, it is noteworthy that three pieces of Talasea obsidian were recovered from Naigani, a site first occupied by 2900 BP (Irwin et al. 2011:9). Talasea obsidian in a context 100 years or so later than first Fijian landfall surely means post-founder interaction with central Island Melanesia, possibly through return voyaging and engagement with the homeland or through additional migration(s). This challenges the notion of a population isolate in Fiji once landfall had been made (Green 1979) and supports Anderson and O’Connor’s (2008:7) assertions that “migration was seldom a single movement, and much more often a phase of movements back and forth.” Lapita interactions of this type facilitate the repeated genetic sampling of a homeland population, countering founder effect impacts of a single migratory event.</p>
         <p>The earliest dated Lapita site in West Polynesia is Nukuleka on the island of Tongatapu, Tonga.<sup>5</sup> Radiocarbon and uranium/thorium dates securely place settlement here at 2850 BP (Burley, Weisler, and Zhao 2012). The Nukuleka ceramic assemblage incorporates a small component of sherds decorated in the western Lapita style, including use of restricted zone markers, probably anthropomorphic designs, labyrinth motifs, and joined triangular patterns (Burley et al. 2010:135–136). Overall, however, the assemblage is dominated by a simplified, coarsely applied, and open set of designs that define the eastern Lapita ceramic aspect (Burley, Storey, and Witt 2002). The western Lapita ceramics found at Nukuleka do not occur elsewhere in West Polynesia. This, with the radiocarbon dates, secures the claim of Nukuleka as a founder colony for Polynesia (Burley and Dickinson 2001, 2010). Within 50 to 100 years, Lapita settlement spread expansively around the central lagoon on Tongatapu as well as northward through the Ha’apai and Vava’u islands into Samoa (Burley and Connaughton 2007). The approximate 150–200-year difference between Bourewa and Nukuleka seems appropriate for a west to east Lapita expansion across Fiji, as expected in the Wave of Advance colonization model described earlier. Conversely, petrographic analysis of temper sands in over 30 Nukuleka ceramic sherds with a tan paste body fabric, several with western Lapita designs, suggests Tonga was not settled from Fiji (Burley and Dickinson 2001, 2010). A specific source for the temper has yet to be identified, but its mineral composition correlates with the geology of a dacitic high island, presumably in central Island Melanesia but possibly even further west (Burley and Dickinson 2010:1024). The only instance where a ceramic sherd with comparable temper has been found derives from Nendö, the largest island of the eastern Santa Cruz group. Nendö, though, is not the source, since the Nukuleka temper is foreign to this island as well (Dickinson 2006:63).</p>
         <p>The implication of separate founder events for Fiji and West Polynesia originating in central Island Melanesia with an intervening gap of 150–200 years is provocative. It is compatible with the earlier interpretation that Fiji was not an isolate in the post-founder event era and that return voyaging to a central Island Melanesia homeland most likely spread geographic knowledge leading to additional migration. Nukuleka, then, would be one of these later migrations. A separate founder event for West Polynesia raises further the probability of founder effect as an explanation for phenotypic variation between Fiji/Melanesia and Polynesia. The population first arriving in Tonga was probably small (Burley 2007; Burley et al. 2010) and genetically unrepresentative of the larger population from which it derived. Amplification of these differences through endogamy in the Lapita and immediate post-Lapita period, as well as genetic drift, potentially underlies the emergence of a distinctive Polynesian phenotype. On the other hand, post-founder event interaction between Fiji and a homeland to the west, as seemingly indicated by the presence of Talasea obsidian at Naigani, may have facilitated gene flow as a counter to founder-effect selection. Subsequent Lapita migration into Tonga from central Island Melanesia (or from Fiji) is not apparent in the archaeological record, nor does it seem likely, given the over 2000 km distances involved in a return voyage.</p>
         <p>With exception of the Lau islands in southeast Fiji, the Lapita and post-Lapita archaeological records in Fiji and Tonga are different. Western Lapita ceramics in Fiji illustrate conservativeness in form and decorative application over a period of 200–300 years as witnessed in the sites listed previously (Best 2002; Irwin et al. 2011; Nunn et al. 2007). Indeed, even by 2500 BP, ceramic vessel forms continued to be complex, and aspects of the earlier Lapita design system, including dentate stamp application and design elements, were being applied to their surfaces (Burley and Connaughton 2010). In Tonga, any complexity of design associated with the founding potters at Nukuleka was quickly superseded by highly simplified eastern Lapita motifs (Burley, Storey, and Witt 2002); by 2650 BP or slightly later, pottery decoration and many of the vessel forms to which it was applied disappear altogether (Burley and Connaughton 2007). The Lapita archaeological record for the Lau islands of southeastern Fiji corresponds with the Tongan pattern (Best 1984), indicating initial ties to West Polynesia rather than Fiji.</p>
         <p>The distinctiveness of Fiji and West Polynesian ceramic industries increase substantially in the post-Lapita period. At ca. 2500 BP in Fiji, a Late Lapita ceramic phase emerges with a variety of vessel forms, including highly diagnostic jars with collared and notched rims (Burley and Dickinson 2004). This assemblage and that of the sequent Fijian Plainware phase illustrate continuity, innovation, and continued diversity in ceramic production by highly skilled communities of potters (Birks 1973; Burley 2005; Burley and Dickinson 2004). The Lapita period in Tonga does not have a defined late phase, it ending somewhat abruptly with the disappearance of decorated ceramics (Connaughton 2007). In its stead are Polynesian Plainware ceramics, an assemblage with reduced variability in vessel form that, over a short period of time, is restricted further to large storage jars and small bowls/cups (Burley 1998<italic>b</italic>; Dye 1996). By ca. 1550 BP ceramics are no longer manufactured (Burley and Connaughton 2007). Decreasing diversity, scale, technology, and role of ceramic production in West Polynesia markedly contrasts with the continued significance of ceramic manufacture in Fiji. Kirch and Green (2001:168) equate the Lapita to Polynesian Plainware ceramic transition with the beginnings of ancestral Polynesian society, where adaptation, innovation, and integration ultimately result in a distinctive Polynesian cultural (and linguistic) template.</p>
         <p>Divergent historical trajectories between Fiji and West Polynesia based on ceramics are reflective of and define discrete interaction spheres to the west and east for at least the first millennium of prehistory in these areas (fig. 2). The eastern sphere incorporates Tonga and Lau, with the position of Samoa and other West Polynesian islands less clear (Addison and Matisoo-Smith 2010; Burley, Sheppard, and Simonin 2011). Within this sphere, there exists a single, or a small number, of central places. Fanga’Uta Lagoon on the island of Tongatapu is the principal of these. Here there were no less than 19 Lapita settlements around its shores, including the founder colony of Nukuleka, a site extending over an area 20 ha in size (Burley et al. 2010). Lakeba, in southern Lau, has a large Lapita settlement at Wakea (Best 1984, 2002), and this may have served a similar role, at least initially. Volcanic glass from Niuatoputapu in northern Tonga has been recovered from Vavau, Ha’apai, Tongatapu, and Lakeba from the Lapita period onward, supporting arguments for an integrated exchange network and interisland voyaging throughout the region (Burley, Sheppard, and Simonin 2011). Equally important, exotic lithic materials, ceramic styles, or ceramic tempers suggesting contact between Fiji and the Tongan core of this eastern sphere are unknown, at least to date (Burley 1998<italic>b</italic>; Dickinson 2006; Dickinson et al. 1996). Lakeba is peripheral, with Best (1984:641) arguing for a degree of exchange or trade between Lau and the larger islands of Vanua Levu and Viti Levu (also Nunn et al. 2007). The western interaction sphere incorporates the numerous islands of Fiji, save Lau. There exists relative homogeneity in ceramic styles in this region through the Lapita to Fijian Plainware phases. Based on ceramic temper types, abundant evidence exists for interisland interactions and widespread ceramic transfers (Dickinson 2006:141–142). Talasea obsidian from Naigani potentially illustrates some engagement with central Island Melanesia in the early period. The sudden appearance of carved paddle impression on the surfaces of Fijian Plainware-phase pots (Burley 2005; Clark 2009) may indicate further influences from the west during the early part of the mid-sequence. Ceramics with similar types of carved paddle impression, for example, first appear as a diagnostic characteristic of Podtanean pottery ca. 2600–2650 BP in New Caledonia but continue on in the ceramic sequence in some areas until ca. 1900–2000 BP (Sand, Bolé, and Ouetcho 2011:60).</p>
         <p>Recognizing historical complexities in the relationships of languages within the Proto-Central Pacific linguistic subgroup, Geraghty (1983) proposes a framework that parallels the conceptual structure for east/west interaction spheres. He argues for a fine-grained linguistic division of Proto-Central Pacific into Rotuman, west Fijian, and Proto-Tokalau Fijian language groups, the latter being an ancestral subgroup to both east Fijian and Proto-Polynesian languages. Proto-Tokalau Fijian is an integrated and distinct dialect chain stretching from Tonga/Samoa on the east through Lau to the southeastern coast of Vanua Levu. These boundaries correspond with much of the eastern interaction sphere proposed here while the west Fijian language subgroup is fully consistent with the western interaction sphere. According to Geraghty (1983:383), East Fijian languages, including those of Lau, eventually transitioned from a Polynesian-related subgroup to a Fijian subgroup through convergent processes from a coastal “Southeast Viti Levu prestige area.” A shift from Polynesian Plainware ceramics to vessels having carved paddle impression occurs in Lau ca. 2100 BP. To Best (1984:643), this “represents the greatest ceramic change in Lakeba’s prehistory.” This parallels and importantly demarcates the linguistic transition proposed by Geraghty in the archaeological record. Thereafter, the archaeological record for Lakeba is brought into line with the remainder of Fiji.</p>

         <title>Polygenesis, Part 2: Substantive Cases for Migration and Interarchipelago Contact in the Post-Lapita Era</title>
         <p>The post-Lapita archaeological record for Tonga indicates population continuity, with gradual development into a dynastic maritime chiefdom by 1000 BP (Burley 1998<italic>b</italic>; Clark, Burley, and Murray 2008). This type of continuity is not as apparent across Fiji. Early archaeologists argued for external influences in the Fijian past to explain differences in ceramic types and other archaeological data. Green’s (1963:251) fundamental definition of Fijian culture history, as noted, had an initial “Proto-Polynesian” (Lapita) ceramic phase defined by Lapita ceramics. These subsequently were replaced by a reliefware ceramic (Navatu) phase of “unknown cultural affiliation” and then a late period beginning 1100 AD with plain and incised ceramic wares (Vuda/Ra phases) indicative of “Melanesian culture.” Others working in Fiji up to the early 1980s were quick to follow, selectively equating ceramic attributes with Fijian/central Island Melanesian contacts or immigration (in particular, Frost 1979). With exceptions (Best 2002; Cochrane 2008, 2009<italic>a</italic>), archaeologists working in Fiji from the mid-1980s onward have taken issue with normative culture history and the associated concepts of migration and diffusion (Bedford and Clark 2001; Clark 2000, 2009; Crosby 1988; Field 2003; Hunt 1986, 1987; Marshall et al. 2000; Rechtman 1992). Migrationist models, state Hunt (1987:329–330), are neither “empirically or dynamically sufficient” to explain “the origins of human diversity in Fiji.” Most do not rule out possibilities for contact but argue that current evidence does not support such claims. Clark (2009:308) thus sets the archaeological burden of proof as follows:<disp-quote>
               <p>geochemical sourcing of archaeological materials from different island groups, traces of language intrusion in historical linguistics, … independent traditions of culture contact in island societies, biological data for long-distance movement such as from osteology, ancient DNA and isotope studies, and clear stylistic similarities between local and foreign ceramic assemblages rather than the selective use of a few traits/attributes to posit long-distance contact … the scale and scope of culture change from inter-archipelago mobility should also be defined, as should whether prehistoric contact modified material culture, language, biological systems, settlement patterns and architecture.</p>
            </disp-quote>One can hardly contest these requirements as a data set supportive of migration, the difficulty of acquisition notwithstanding.</p>
         <p>Early interpretations of ethnic affiliations aside, it would be overly naive to rule out migration or diffusion as historical processes and events with substantive impacts on Fijian society. Long-distance interarchipelago contacts and migrations are well known across Oceania. The numerous settlement episodes in east Polynesia, the backward migration of Polynesians to Polynesian outlier islands in Melanesia, hegemonic expansion of the Tongan Maritime chiefdom, and numerous other movements attest clearly to the reality of migration and culture contact in the Oceanic past (Kirch 2000). Hau’ofa (1993) rightfully contends that, in the worldview of island cultures, oceans are highways, not barriers. Here I identify three immigration events in the post-Lapita era with importance to Fijian polygenesis and the Melanesian/Polynesian divide. These are reviewed as case studies, starting first with the late prehistoric/historic migration of Tongans into Lau, where the social and material consequences of culture contact were observed and recorded in detail. The remaining two, one in the Fijian mid-sequence and one late in prehistory, represent contact and gene flow from central Island Melanesia.</p>
         <sec id="sc3.1">
            <title>Tongan Migrations to Lau</title>
            <p>Tongan migration to Lau beginning in later prehistory but continuing into the historic era is well reported in historical accounts (Derrick 1950) and ethnographic records (Hocart 1929; Thompson 1938, 1940). Initially this was a gradual process where Tongans, in an effort to secure timber for construction of sailing canoes, established sojourner communities. As described by Derrick (1950:121; emphasis added):<disp-quote>
                  <p>In Tonga, there was little timber of a size and quality suitable for the construction of the large vessels, and it became the practice for parties of Tongans to sail up on the wind to Lakeba, arrange with the chiefs there for logs and food in exchange for Tongan bark cloth, weapons, or services in war, and then to establish themselves on islands such as Vulaga and Kabara and build, or help to build, the canoes. … The building of a large canoe took from three to five years, or even longer. Altogether, the trip to Fiji, the work of building the canoe, and the return journey commonly occupied up to seven years; and the <italic>temporary Tongan settlements became permanent</italic> as parties overlapped.</p>
               </disp-quote>Lau eventually came under outright control of a high Tongan chief, Ma’afu, and additional Tongan immigration to a number of already inhabited islands, including Lakeba, was substantial (Derrick 1950). Tongans in Lau integrated with existing Fijian peoples, providing the blend of phenotypic traits Thompson (1940:7) portrays as neither Fijian nor Tongan. These interactions similarly account for a measure of the east/west phenotypic distinctions noted by Gabel (1958; also Kirk 1988) and linguistic influences identified by Geraghty (1983). Significant transformations occurred in other areas as well, and these inform upon the degree of cultural impact and provide a migration imprint for archaeological recognition or analogical inference in earlier contexts of prehistory.</p>
            <p>Hocart (1929) and Thompson (1938, 1940) identify fully the consequences of Tongan presence for indigenous Lauan society throughout their ethnographic accounts. Influences or outright integration of Tongan practices are widespread in social, political, ceremonial, and ritual spheres as well as technology and material culture. Concepts of divine chieftainship and rank, bilateral kinship recognition, elevation of female status, kava ritual, feasting protocols, clothing, canoe construction, professional craftsmen, and dance are among a corpus of areas where Tongan impacts are seen. As correlates for archaeological recognition, three aspects of a transformed Lauan/Fijian culture importantly come to the fore—house form, chiefly burial practices, and <italic>masi/ngatu</italic> (bark cloth) production.</p>
            <p>Traditional house form is far more than technology or the materials employed in construction. It is a dwelling space significantly invested with and structured by cultural meaning, from ethnic identity to ideological precepts (Rapoport 1969, among many). Transitional change in the house form of indigenous peoples thus tends to be conservative and reflective of significant transformations in other areas of society. Historical accounts of Fijian houses describe regionalized styles across the archipelago (Williams 1982 [1858]:79–84), albeit most are variations of a general theme. Clunie (1986:28) summarizes this as a rectangular plan with a hipped or gabled roof, a single low doorway, and no windows. Fijian houses are built on <italic>yavu</italic>, packed earthen platforms retained by cobbled walls. The shape of the <italic>yavu</italic> conforms to the floor plan of the house, leaving a distinct and highly visible archaeological signature. The <italic>yavu</italic> within “old village sites” in Lau, as observed by Thompson (1940:160), conform closely to Clunie’s rectangular plan template, an observation supported by informant accounts. In more recent villages, however, this type is abruptly supplanted by the traditional Tongan form, where ends are rounded, the floor plan is oval shaped, and the roof is gabled but curved in a fashion resembling a gothic arch (Hocart 1929:120–121; Thompson 1940:160). Indeed, Hocart’s (1929:11) early 1900s map of Tubou, the chiefly village on Lakeba, exclusively identifies the Tongan type mixed with a small number of European houses. Why the Tongan house “pushed out the old Lauan form” (Thompson 1938:193) so completely can only be speculated upon. Oval-shaped <italic>yavu</italic> nevertheless clearly demarcate the late prehistoric/historic Tongan migration to Lau.</p>
            <p>Also demarcating Tongan migration to Lau on the landscape are practices of chiefly burial. This can be anticipated, given divine concepts of Tongan chieftainship, the presence of Tongan chiefs in Lau, the integration of Tongans into Lauan chiefly titles, and marriage of Lauan chiefs to high-ranking Tongan women (Reid 1977). Most directly, there is the construction of large chiefly burial sites of Tongan <italic>langi</italic> form (see McKern 1929). These typically are tiered platforms retained by cut-and-dressed beach rock slabs with a central burial vault also of beach rock. Sau Tabu, the chiefly burial site for Ma’afu and subsequent high chiefs of Lakeba, is one of these. Thompson’s (1940, pl. 1b) photograph of the chief’s grave in Tokalau Village, Kabara Island, similarly illustrates Tongan tomb architecture, while a reviewer for this paper reports its presence on the lagoon coast of Totoya Island. The construction of these tombs creates a contingent industry that is equally visible on the landscape. Stone slabs for vault and retaining wall use are cut from laminated beach rock deposits at the beach/reef interface. Beach rock quarries are abundant throughout Tonga, and quarrying techniques and expertise became highly developed by professional stonemasons in the dynastic chiefdom period (Burley 1998<italic>a</italic>). The presence of quarries in Lau (Clark and Anderson 2009<italic>a</italic>) provides yet another indication of Tongan immigration.<sup>6</sup>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, the third area I highlight is <italic>masi/ngatu</italic> manufacture and decoration. This is not an archaeological correlate per se, but it provides an appropriate craft-centered analogue through which rapid change in ceramic design, decoration, and manufacture in Fijian prehistory might be interpreted. Distinctions between Tongan <italic>ngatu</italic> and Fijian <italic>masi</italic> in Lau are well examined by Hocart (1929:131–136) and Thompson (1940:193–200). Among variations in basic manufacture, Tongan <italic>ngatu</italic> is decorated with pattern boards where traditional motifs are rubbed on and further highlighted through painting. Fijian <italic>masi</italic> decoration has a different and distinct series of design elements that are applied almost exclusively through stencils. This results in vivid, more complex decorative fields than in the Tongan form. Unlike house form and tomb architecture, Tongan <italic>ngatu</italic> did not outright replace Fijian <italic>masi</italic>. Rather, the two are retained independently but with localized specialization (Thompson 1940:193). Tongan <italic>ngatu</italic> continues to be produced and is an important prestige good in contemporary Lau (Thompson 1940, pl. 2c). In this it persists as a visible testimony to Lauan history and its Tongan relationship.</p>

            <title>The Mid-sequence Transition in Southwestern Viti Levu</title>
            <p>The post-Lapita manufacture of ceramics in Fiji continues into the historic era, persisting in some villages up to the present (Palmer et al. 1968). Ceramics form the basis of Fiji’s cultural historical sequence, serving as chronological markers and, one assumes, identifying patterns of integration or interaction across the archipelago. Initially there appears a millennium and a half of continuity in ceramic forms, beginning with Lapita settlement and continuing through the Fijian Plainware phase. Decorative applications and styles changed but with systematic and gradual transition in vessel form manufacture and decorative treatment (Best 2002; Burley and Dickinson 2004; Clark 2000). At ca. 2100 BP, as described for Lau (Best 2002:7), a new trait occurs in the mid-sequence Fijian Plainware phase—carved paddle impression intentionally applied as surface decoration on some ceramic vessels. This type of application has precedent in New Caledonia (ca. 2650–2000 BP; Sand, Bolé, and Ouetcho 2011), as noted, suggesting external contact to the west. Carved paddle impression throughout Fiji proper is an addition to the existing suite of ceramic attributes and vessel forms, without implication for significant change in ceramic production, style, or culture (Burley 2005). It implies external interaction, not immigration. Fijian ceramic continuity, however, is truncated abruptly on the southwest coast of Viti Levu ca. 1400–1500 BP by the Navatu phase.</p>
            <p>The Sigatoka Sand Dunes are parabolic dune fields running westward from the Sigatoka River mouth along the southwest Viti Levu coast for a distance of 5 km. Archaeological remains periodically became buried here beginning in 2700 BP and continuing into the historic era (Burley 2003). Much of this material is or has been exposed through dune front erosion over the past half century. The rapid Sigatoka burial environment provides unique snapshots of Fijian prehistory, in addition to stratigraphic integrity for the deposits. Near the river mouth end of the dunes, superimposed but stratigraphically separated habitation sites occur for Fijian Plainware and Navatu-phase occupations. Excavations here have recovered large volumes of ceramics and other materials, including architectural features. These data indicate sudden abandonment of the lower Plainware village site, ca. 1450–1500 BP, with Navatu-phase settlement immediately thereafter, ca. 1400–1450 BP (Burley 2005).</p>
            <p>The habitation sites are at most 100 years apart, yet highly conspicuous variation occurs between the ceramic assemblages in vessel form types and in decorative applications. Large subglobular pots with slightly everted to inverted rims and large everted rim bowls with thickened rims dominate the Fijian Plainware ceramic assemblage. Plainware jars typically are wiped on the neck with a coarse fiber, some have notched rims, some are paddle impressed, but the largest majority is devoid of decoration. The principal Navatu vessel is a smaller, well-made, thin-bodied, hard, globular jar with a sharply everted rim, oftentimes having a crenellated or finely notched lip. Fingernail pinches, incision, side tool impressions, punctates, nubbins, appliqué modeling, carved paddle impression, and other decorative applications may occur on the shoulder and neck, giving it further distinction. Also unique to the Navatu phase is a large (50–85 cm diameter), heavy (9–12 kg), crudely built tray used for the solar evaporation of salt from seawater (Burley et al. 2011). The Plainware/Navatu ceramic break based in vessel form and decorative application at Sigatoka seems as distinct as the dichotomous Tongan/Fijian bark cloth industries in Lau.</p>
            <p>Claims of migration or even external contact based on ceramic style are met with immediate question in Fijian prehistory, as implied in the burden of proof requirements set by Clark. Bedford and Clark (2001) specifically reject a possible external source for Navatu ceramics, as they cannot find a comparable form in Vanuatu or elsewhere in central Island Melanesia. I emphasize here, however, that it is not just the “selective use of a few traits/attributes to posit long-distance contact,” as Clark (2009:308) suggests. Rather, it is the abruptness and extent of the ceramic assemblage transition that is telling within Fijian culture history. As with <italic>masi/ngatu</italic> production in Lau, there exist substantial differences in manufacturing technologies that are hard to explain in a continuity model. Plainware-phase ceramics are slab built using paddle and anvil, with locally obtained volcaniclastic orogen-type sand tempers added to the clay. Subglobular form is constructed as the vessel is built upward, and the rim is created as an out-turned extension of the neck. Wall thinness and globular symmetry of the Navatu jar suggests a two-piece body construction, as is the case in jar manufacture in pottery villages in the Sigatoka area today (Palmer et al. 1968). The sharply everted rim is then formed and added separately. Tempers for Navatu ceramics are dominantly calcareous, with crushed shell and/or coral sand. And equally, if not more important, there are distinct differences in firing technologies applied to the finished vessels. Both are open hearth–fired earthenwares, but during the Navatu phase, coral limestone, volcanic rock, and other materials, including ceramic sherds, are employed in the firing hearth to accelerate temperature as well as to evenly distribute heat (Burley 2005; Burley et al. 2011). This is requisite to the production of the thin, hard, and relatively impermeable jar as well as the salt tray.</p>
            <p>Equally revealing for documentation of cultural disjuncture at Sigatoka is a potential change in burial practices. Plainware-phase burials are concentrated in two cemetery areas, with many individuals placed beneath elaborate coral rock cairns (Best 1987; Marshall et al. 2000). Individuals characteristically are semiflexed in body position and rigidly oriented east/west with the head to the west. Navatu-phase burials are scattered along the beachfront west of the Navatu-phase village site, intruding in some cases into the earlier cemetery areas (Burley 2005:336–337). Tightly flexed and probably bound individuals are interred in pits without consistent body orientation. Visser has analyzed a large segment of the Sigatoka burial population. He (1994:193–194, 249–250) suggests the skeletal traits of off-oriented burials are more closely aligned with contemporary Fijians than those who are interred with east/west orientation in cairns, acknowledging a problem in sample size and bone degradation for the former.</p>
            <p>The lower Fijian Plainware-phase ceramic assemblage at Sigatoka is the end product of a homogenous but gradually changing ceramic sequence in west Fiji beginning with initial Lapita colonization. Marshall et al. (2000:71) specifically refer to the Sigatoka Plainware vessels as “Late Lapita Plainware” in recognition. The Navatu-phase ceramic assemblage represents an abrupt change, one that succinctly marks a different population of potters living on this site. Whether this population originates ultimately from central Island Melanesia or represents a population movement from within the Fijian archipelago is a central question. Navatu-phase ceramics are differentially distributed in Fiji, being present in the west and central islands of the archipelago, as is also Lau (Burley 2005), but strikingly absent on Kadavu (Burley and Balenaivalu, in press). Wherever Navatu ceramics occur as a complex, they mark a break in the regional ceramic record consistent with an external source. As Best (2002:31) states, “Although these decorative traits are not particularly complex, and individually can certainly be found in the ceramic systems of many cultures, they appear in Fiji as a <italic>package</italic>, with no direct precursors or descendants” (emphasis added). Navatu ceramics loosely conform to the broad definition of incised and applied relief wares as they occur across Melanesia (Spriggs 2004). In Vanuatu, these wares are part of a continuous ceramic sequence extending back to the late Lapita period (Bedford 2006; Bedford and Spriggs 2008). In Fiji they are not.</p>

            <title>The Late Prehistoric Kaunitoni Migration</title>
            <p>The third case for migration into Fiji relates to northern Viti Levu between 350 and 550 BP. This event is not marked by ceramic discontinuity, as with Fijian Plainware and Navatu phases, though there is a possible ceramic correlate to be noted. The migration is recorded in Fijian traditional history through the Kaunitoni story and corroborated by a number of other cultural traits. Thomson (1895:340–341) first published the Kaunitoni tradition as a narrative relating to the ancestor gods of “the tribes inhabiting the northern and eastern portions of the island of Viti-Levu” and <italic>not</italic> as a pan-Fijian origin myth, as the tradition is broadly treated today (France 1966). The tradition in abstract holds that three chiefs, Lutunasobasoba, Degei, and Wacalanavanua, were resident of a distant land to the far west of Fiji. They decided to leave with their wives and children, and had a great canoe, <italic>Kaunitoni</italic>, constructed. They landed on northern Viti Levu following a storm, establishing a village called Vuda, meaning “our origin” (Thomson 1895:345). Lutunasobasoba became the founding ancestor for the <italic>yavusa</italic> of western Viti Levu (Derrick 1950:7–8). Led by Degei, other members of this migration moved later to Ra, settling on the slopes of the Kauvadra Mountains. Degei’s sons quarreled and dispersed by various routes throughout eastern Fiji and Vanua Levu, founding the chiefly <italic>yavusa</italic> as constituted in the historic era. Degei was transformed into a god, taking the form of a snake and living in a cave in the Kauvadra range. Indigenous Fijians on Viti Levu and elsewhere widely accept this narrative for its explicit documentation and explanation of sociopolitical relationships and protocols among <italic>yavusa</italic>, questions of veracity and later additions notwithstanding (France 1966).<sup>7</sup> In 1947 Gifford (1951:235) documented 14 generations between Lutunasobasoba and his direct descendant Tui Vuda, positing a date of 1600 AD for the Kaunitoni migration.</p>
            <p>Gifford’s date is important for it coincides with the appearance in west Fiji of other traits suggestive of Island Melanesian influence. One is a rock wall/alignment structure called <italic>naga</italic>, a site associated with secret society ceremonial rites related to male initiation, crop fertility, and the Fijian New Year (Fison 1885; Lester 1953). <italic>Naga</italic> were guarded by snakes, an observation Derrick (1950:11) coincidentally ties back to Degei, the snake god. These sites, and the ceremony they represent, are restricted in Fiji, extending on Viti Levu from either side of the Nadi River east into the highlands through to the headwaters of the Sigatoka and Wainimala rivers and then back to the coast along the latter (Fison 1885, pl. 1). Secret societies and male initiation rites are common throughout Island Melanesia and, combined with their limited spatial distribution in west Fiji, have long been considered intrusive (Fison 1885:30). <italic>Naga</italic> sites are further associated with a unique style of ceramic cooking vessel, the <italic>kuro balavu</italic> (long pot), again with parallels outside of Fiji (Field 2003; Palmer 1971<italic>a</italic>). These are large, long ovoid vessels with distinctive neck and rim forms, highly reminiscent of bullet-shaped pots from Malekula (Bedford 2006). The correlation of <italic>kuro balavu</italic> with <italic>naga</italic> is striking enough for Bedford and Spriggs (2008:108–109) to recently claim “intriguing parallels with northern Vanuatu ceremonial activity.” To Bedford and Spriggs, this is acutely reinforced by Fison’s (1885:20) observations of cranial deformation among <italic>naga</italic> participants, a practice similarly present in Malekula and other areas of Vanuatu but absent elsewhere in Fiji.</p>
            <p>A final feature coinciding with Gifford’s late date for Kaunitoni is the sudden appearance in western and northwestern Viti Levu of a center-pole house style. There are distinct variations of this type with alternative types of floor plans (Freeman 1986). To Clunie (cited in Freeman 1986:17), however, the original center-pole house was round, as round <italic>yavu</italic> are present in several late prehistoric fortification sites. Other than floor plan, center post, and conical roof, Clunie identifies distinct structural similarities between Fijian and New Caledonia/Loyalty Island round house forms. These include “attachment of rafters to rings or wreaths, and an identical method of stiffening the wall thatch with cross bars” (cited in Freeman 1986:17). This disjuncture in house form, as with Tongan houses in Lau, is not easily explained. Field (2003:276–278) recorded several sites with round <italic>yavu</italic> in the upper Sigatoka river valley, associating them with later prehistory, possibly even the latest phases of this period. She (2003: 299), however, does not believe the <italic>yavu</italic> alone or in combination with <italic>kuro balavu</italic> are “distinctive enough” to indicate “non-Fijian migrants.” She nevertheless correlates their appearance with a major period of indigenous population movement and with growing stress and complexity in social and political relations (Field 2003:279, 2004). And equally telling, she reports that round <italic>yavu</italic> are associated with habitation sites of <italic>yavusa</italic> who have no traditional claims to lands in this region (also Gifford 1952).</p>
            <p>The Kaunitoni tradition, I suggest, can be accepted as a literal history of migration with substantive political impact in west Fiji in the late prehistoric period. <italic>Naga</italic>, <italic>kuro balavu</italic>, artificial cranial deformation, and round floor plan houses are both coincident and spatially restricted to western Viti Levu. That these features have parallels in different regions of Melanesia seemingly confuses the issue of origins. Then, again, it might also indicate a far more complex history of engagement and interactions than typically considered. Whatever these relationships ultimately prove to be, they contribute to Fijian polygenesis and help to define the Melanesian/Polynesian divide as it was observed in Fiji by Dumont d’Urville.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>To nineteenth- and early twentieth-century observers, Fiji was the appropriate divide between Melanesia and Polynesia as proposed by Dumont d’Urville. Polynesians were significantly distinct in phenotypic and cultural traits, and the only feasible explanation was a separate migration by a new race of people across Oceania. The Polynesians, in Sir Peter Buck’s (1938) classic metaphor, were “Vikings of the sunrise.” The accumulated data of archaeology, linguistics, anthropology, and biological anthropology/genetics in the twenty-first century are substantial. Yet the problems of first settlement, interarchipelago interactions in prehistory, and why Fijians (Melanesians) and Tongans (Polynesians) are distinct seem no better addressed today than a century ago. The Wave of Advance model for Lapita settlement of the region, for example, predicts biological and cultural homogeneity in early prehistory, a homogeneity anticipated to be Polynesian-like in its character. Yet, if we exclusively prioritize local adaptation as an explanation for culture change in the Fijian past, as several researchers have done, how do we then explain genetic and linguistic relationships as they currently exist? Clearly, the processes and circumstance of Fijian prehistory are far more intricate than archaeologists are disposed to consider.</p>
         <p>The introduction to this paper poses a very basic question—how did Fijians become Fijian and not Polynesian? The resolution, as it is proposed, is a multifarious one that challenges existing interpretive models. A primary basis for the Melanesian/Polynesian divide through Fiji occurs early. It is a consequence of separate founder events from central Island Melanesia that are divorced in time by a century or more. The archaeological records for Fiji and Tonga suggest only peripheral, if any, interaction between these two regions throughout the Lapita and early post-Lapita eras. Participation in quite different interaction spheres thus facilitated uniquely defined historical trajectories, as is apparent in regional ceramic chronologies. The data for Fiji are highly limited but suggestive of a continued involvement with or additional immigration from a central Island Melanesian homeland. First settlement in West Polynesia, on the other hand, appears isolated in the founder colony of Nukuleka, on Tongatapu. It is a constrained and strong founder event with founder effect resulting in a distinctively different population than present in Fiji.</p>
         <p>Separate founder events are only part of the answer to the question of Fijian origins. Historic Fijian culture was formed further through the processes of polygenesis, where interarchipelago contacts and migratory events throughout prehistory did have influence, even if as minor as the introduction of a new type of pottery decoration. Tongan immigration to Lau, the Fijian Plainware/Navatu-phase mid-sequence break, and the late prehistoric Kautoni tradition are specific events presented herein. Over a period of 3,000 years, others should be expected. These types of events do not deny internal change resulting from adaptation, localized isolation, or other systemic processes. Rather, they provide the Fijian past with as much complexity as the Fijian present and give it greater explanatory power.</p>
