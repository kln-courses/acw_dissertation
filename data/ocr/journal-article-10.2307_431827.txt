<plain_text><page sequence="1">L. B. CEBIK On the Suspicion of an Art Forgery "Suspicion," said Thomas Paine in Common Sense, "is the companion of mean souls."1 Irreparably mean souls suspect everything and never have a taste for art. Amongst ordinary people, suspicion when aroused makes souls mean and clouds the senses to art. Meanness, like jealousy, as la Rochefoucauld has noted, "feeds upon suspicion, and it turns to fury or it ends as soon as we pass from suspicion to cer- tainty."2 These oddities give to the suspicion of art forgery more interest than either the igno- rance or knowledge of forgery. Suspected forg- ery lays open something of the heart of the art lover. We have become too sophisticated about the known forgery. Whether or not knowledge of a forgery affects the aesthetic perception, state, or value of an artwork depends almost wholly upon the particular aesthetic theory we bring to the inquiry. Purists for whom no knowledge infects the experience of a work cannot allow knowl- edge of a forgery to dull their senses. All others must specify how the knowledge of a forgery- or its lack-influences judgment. The work now belongs to A in year Y rather than to B in year Z, and we view it accordingly. The work has a history-or more correctly-a biography, which we have now corrected. The work smells of crime: a fraud that enriched some and embar- rassed others. What kinds of facts we allow into aesthetic perception and judgment determine what we see or what we may sensibly say. The results of these disputes say more about our powers of deduction than about our ability to understand phenomena. Untroubled viewers remain untroubled; the bothered increase their agitation. But suspicion of forgery, as suspicion, is an altogether different phenomenon. Unlike knowledge of forgery, suspicion of forgery does not uncertainly affect aesthetic perception and judgment. Suspicion replaces them. The opposi- tion is not merely logical: it is conceptual and phenomenal. In its opposition to aesthetic per- ception and judgment, suspicion may tell us something about the aesthetic apart from any particular theory. Thus does suspicion of forg- ery gather its worth as an object of study. I. SUSPICION OF FORGERY AS A PROBLEM OF ITS OWN Francis Sparshott almost came upon the central problem. "It is only at and around the moment of exposure that the forgery disturbs: in growing suspicion, in the shock of disclosure, in read- justment to the new relationship." Yet Sparshott ignores the special qualities of suspicion in his quest to analyze the deceived art lover who is finally aware of the deception. "The forger betrays our trust, ... the self-giving on which all human relationship depends." The danger Spar- shott sees is the potential for cynical disillusion- ment that precludes future deceit only by believ- ing and trusting nothing.3 Only the aftermath of forgery revealed, not the suspicion of forgery, can yield disillusionment. Suspicion precedes disillusionment-and pre- cludes it. For all its disruption of perception, suspicion seeks to see and to see clearly. It does not deny perception of art, but bypasses it by concentrating on other things. Disillusionment seeks to see art no more, to see Sparshott's lover no more. Suspicion seeks nothing less than a perfect perception of the art, of the lover, perfect enough to remove all doubts, and so perfect that it demands to see what is not (yet) in evidence. Suspicion looks in shadows, and if there are no shadows, it creates them. La Rochefoucauld The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 47:2 Spring 1989</page><page sequence="2">148 notes that the suspicious nature of jealousy always seeks new disquieting facts and new doubts.4 Suspicion prolongs itself by wanting both to uncover and not uncover the truth, by wanting to see clearly despite its dread of seeing at all. The distrust evoked by the known forgery differs from the mistrust of the suspected forg- ery. The betrayal personified in the known forg- ery demands reaction, whether in fury or in disillusionment. We fire and discredit experts whose judgment placed the work before us. We hide the work from view. We arrest, try, and punish the forger, if we can find him or if, like Van Meegeren, he confesses. We act like vic- tims, chagrined and embarrassed, resentful and spiteful, anxious to efface the source of our fury. If unable to do so, only then do we lapse into Sparshott's cynical disillusionment. II. SUSPICION AND CONFIDENCE Suspected forgery, however, occasions no reac- tion. Rather it occasions the prospect of such reactions. They come to thought only as fears, as anticipations, as dreads. Suspected forgery steals our confidence. We lack confidence in the work, in its being what we have taken it to be. More significantly, we lack confidence in our- selves. We no longer know how to respond to the work, either cognitively or emotively. Where once we took the work and ourselves for granted, we must now question both. Definition dissolves into vagary. Quest and question replace our for- mer confidence. Suspicion depends upon a certain absence of evidence to fuel our doubts and questions. Equally, suspicion requires some small presence of evidence to initiate our doubts. Doubts and questions cannot arise without reason. Without evidence to raise questions we would continue to approach a work with confidence. However, the evidence cannot be sufficient to yield even mod- erately probable answers in which we might take confidence. There are suspected felons whom we have some reason to believe have committed a crime but whom we cannot yet arrest for lack of evidence. Our problem is not that we have difficulty keeping an eye on them; rather, we cannot take our eyes off of them. Less legally and more in line with the situation with art, we sometimes suspect a friend or neighbor of some- The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism thing malevolent that we cannot prove to a rele- vant degree of assurance. And so we watch. Likewise, we cannot maintain a suspicion of forgery if we believe that the evidence supports a conclusion of forgery. Talk of evidence may already make so strong a case for forgery that we cannot sustain suspicion. Suspicion demands that the work itself or other information must suggest or intimate the possibility of forgery. We must find only hints or traces of forgery, perhaps some color selection or brush strokes out of character with the artist's norm, perhaps a bit too much or too little aging of the materials, perhaps a rumor not readily discreditable. From such quasi-data as these, we may guess or surmise the worst. We may have an inkling that more evidence would yield a disas- trous result. Much more than this and the case would become too strong to maintain our suspi- cions. The level of evidence required to transform doubt into even a probable conclusion varies directly with the level of our reluctance to part with our faith in a work or in a person. Some citizens initially refused to believe that there could be presidential involvement in Watergate, for presidents simply could not do such things, even if ordinary government officials could. Similarly, some experts resisted the mounting evidence of Van Meegeren's authorship, not only for the preservation of their own reputa- tions, but also because they cherished the works of Vermeer's meager period. By some accounts, a few initially rejected Van Meegeren's confes- sion. Little such attachment seems to have influ- enced the sorting of genuine Blalocks from the hundreds of forgeries variously done in his name.5 Indeed, for want of sufficient love, we may have discarded a few Blalocks with the imitations. Our lack of confidence takes the form of char- iness in the presence of a suspected work. We are reluctant to respond at any level recognized in the realm of aesthetics. Instead we respond to the work with questions-questions which form a veritable barrier between us and the work. Until the questions are settled, we withhold aes- thetic response. Our attention and focused per- ception point elsewhere. In the presence of a suspected forgery, we are alert and wary. Rather than focusing upon the normal or regular elements of a work of the kind</page><page sequence="3">Cebik On the Suspicion of an Art Forgery in question, we attend to the elements of forgery. No longer does form and color challenge or delight us. Instead we focus upon dirt in surface cracks, upon pigment composition, or upon the minutiae of brush strokes. The more we know of other forgeries, the more details of the work we scrutinize. Even if we cannot perform the criti- cal chemical or X-ray tests, we carefully con- sider every aspect of the work within our power to see. We do not wish to be trapped by a fraud. The mark of our wariness is silence. If we can carry off the illusion, others may see us merely as circumspect, reserved, or discreet. They may not be able to perceive our prudential reluctance to give ourselves to the work, to trust it, grant it credence, or to accept it. They may not see our wary refusal to expend the effort or aesthetic energy to see the work as it may have been given to be seen by the artist, by a seller, or by a gallery or museum. We can no longer act freely toward the work or speak freely about it. More than reserve and discretion underlies our si- lence: guardedly we withhold ourselves from the work. The barrier of questions between us and the work is a product of our action and a function of our desire for a safe distance. Trustful acceptance gives way to carefulness. We are only careful when dangers lurk in the shadows of unproven possibilities. Our loss of confidence can transform daily pleasures into anxiety-ridden difficulties. Where once we would dispute the merits of the demand for justi- fication, now we wish to escape the danger of being wrong, lest we be discredited. We do not wish the work to fool us, to embarrass us. We would avoid the chagrin of looking foolish in an inappropriate reaction to a work. We would evade being found out, lest we expose an inad- equacy. III. WHOM SUSPICION RISKS What we have at stake in our suspicion of art forgery are fundamental, valuable, and personal possessions. Many pop psychologists might re- duce these losses to a loss of self-esteem. We dread these particular losses only because they are our losses, losses of ourselves. If we are suspicious, it is only to prevent self-loss. Each of us in or about "artrealm"-that collection of institutions and activities forming art's subseg- 149 ment of our overall society-may be at risk in suspicion.6 Not everyone is at risk from the suspicion of forgery. A naive or ignorant public largely lets the suspected forgery go unsuspected. It does not know or care enough to have a suspicion. Receiving information about a suspected forg- ery is nothing more than another news story from the newspaper or television. To know about a suspected forgery is not to suspect forg- ery. Nothing more than tomorrow's episode in the saga or soap is at stake. If it turns out to be interesting, all the better. Otherwise, it lapses into the forgetfulness of too much news too often. Only those with certain qualifications can truly suspect an art forgery. Experts in art qualify. Critics, curators, collectors, historians, and educators may all suspect. By supporting a work that turns out to be a forgery, one may lose a job or career in the realm of art. Other jobs and careers requiring similar skills may abound, but fundamental commitments are not easily recast or replaced. Experts have a life devoted to art, a life jeopardized by suspicion. Even apart from the careers of artrealm, there are patrons and lovers of the arts, a vast amor- phous group of people who draw some or all of life from art. They live for art but do not produce art. Their conversations are with peers who share an equal commitment to one or more of the arts. They talk art or literature or music. They attend every available "cultural event" and sponsor them or work at them or raise money for them. The practical results of commitment to art, of course, do not speak to the nature of the commitment itself for the individual patron or art lover. Nevertheless, artrealm depends upon this group of people. Otherwise it could not support showings, galleries, magazines, and journals. The vast industry of posters, prints, and other museum and gallery shop artifacts would disappear without this group of people committed to the arts. Like those with careers within artrealm, art patrons and lovers are at risk because they, too, however derivatively, may suspect forgery. Neither a career or position in artrealm nor an intimate association with artrealm suffices to establish that an individual is at risk. Working productively within artrealm, even towards the execution or exhibition of artworks, may not</page><page sequence="4">150 carry with it the requisite commitment to art- realm. An audio engineer whose chief love is audio electronics rather than music may gain sufficient experience to predict unerringly which music recorded under his control will succeed and which will fail. He may also have mastered the operative vocabulary of music arrangement and performance to allow easy communications with recording artists. And he may never listen to such music off the job, or even like such music. Except for the economic and job implications, he may not care whether such music disappears. Although career and intimate association are indicators of a commit- ment to artrealm, they are uncertain at best. Relatively free from the risks of suspected forgery are artists themselves. As producers of art, their faith largely goes beyond what suspi- cion make shake. Whatever the other sources of their lack of confidence, they have progressively distanced themselves from critics and theorists. As Norman Miller has noted: There is probably a greater degree of self-conscious- ness among artists of all kinds today than there was a century or even a half century ago. The very impa- tience and scorn with which many of them regard critics and philosophers of art, their heightened irri- tability, may all be symptoms of this failure of nerve. How else can one account for the curious fact that the prestige of art and of artists is higher now than ever before in the history of the West, while its practi- tioners appear to be more sensitive than ever to critics?7 One lesson Miller teaches is that only those dependent upon the products of art are at risk from the suspicion of forgery. Producers stand immune, perhaps because of the asymmetry between production and interpretation, which Arthur Danto and Anita Silvers have thoroughly examined. In Danto's terms, "the outward as- pects of representations are not commonly given to the man whose representations they are. He views the world through them, but not them."8 What applies to representation and its aspects applies equally to every other aspect of art sus- ceptible to interpretation. He lives his work as no critic, curator, or patron can. For the artist, his or her work is beyond doubt, and the works of other artists, except for the most unlikely of relationships to those other artists, are beyond The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism concern. Like the unartful public, but for differ- ent reasons, the artist cannot suspect forgery seriously or sincerely. IV. SOMETHING ABOUT ARTREALM Miller's quandary over the increasing iras- cibility of artists toward critics and other ex- perts, despite the heightened prestige of artists today, does not wholly stem from a failure of artistic nerve. It owes as much to the shifting nature of artrealm itself. Danto has done much to describe the evolution of the realm and its consequences in a series of works that nonethe- less stress, perhaps too much, the independence of "artworld." Of course, Danto has had in mind an independence from externally imposed theory through philosophy of art, as art has taken control of its own foundations. "The boundaries between art and reality become in- ternal to itself. And this is a revolution."9 Danto cares only to look at the consequence that art has become philosophy in the process, at least so far as philosophy concerns art at all. His Apollo- nian artworld purposely neglects the broader sense in which artrealm is a substructure of society in general. If we view art wholly from within the field of action, ideas, and interrelationships, then per- haps artworld is the proper term. From without, a perspective necessary to see the interrelation- ship of art with life in general, the label artrealm takes over. Some things we may see from either perspective. Miller's surprise over the fact that artists increasingly reject critics, if not the very role of critics, should not be surprising in a world within which the artists themselves have taken control over the interpretation and propa- gation of their works-not completely, but to a very great degree. Before the Abstract Expres- sionists explained and apologized their works, T. S. Eliot had set the stage in the English-speak- ing world for the poet as theorist, and even he descended from a line going back at least to Coleridge. Andy Warhol's shop changed the limits of artistic production techniques so that now only the imprint and not the effort of the artist is required in the work. But more than production was at stake. Demand outstripped supply, giving distribution control to those art- ists who desired it. Not so much the prestige of artists, but their celebrity increased to reinforce</page><page sequence="5">Cebik On the Suspicion of an Art Forgery their ability to be their own distribution and business managers. The economics of suc- cessful artistic celebrities surpassed anything previously known. Critics have ceased largely to be adjudicators of viewing taste and became simply journalistic sycophants, reporters, and secondary academic interpreters. Those depen- dent upon art have with increasing pervasiveness become dependent directly upon the artist. The loss of critical independence has in turn isolated artrealm further from society in general, despite our dutiful contributions, both private and gov- ernmental, to the growth of the "institutions of artworld-galleries, collectors, exhibitions, journalism." 10 Whether the increasingly isolated and insu- lated artworld has freed itself from its own his- tory and externally imposed theory, the realm has taken on an aura of Nietzsche's self-propel- ling wheel. However, Nietzsche seems never to have seen the possibility that his figure for an incipient Uebermensch might also bear the so- cial face of Karl Mannheim's "frictionless func- tioning." Like Mannheim's researcher, today's artist "might say with Nietzsche 'I have forgot- ten why I ever began.' (Ich habe meine Grunde vergessen.)" II The venerable reasons for pro- ducing a work have disappeared. Even durability of the work makes little difference to contem- porary artists such as Cristo. Every artist has become his or her own theo- rist. Too many theories and innovations have very much the same effect as too few: the viewer may make-indeed, must make-of the work what he or she can. The fundamental reasons for there being an artrealm linger ever more ten- uously. "We belong to a group ... primarily because we see the world and certain things in the world the way it does (i.e., in terms of the meaning of the group in question)." 12 Little wonder that Danto was (and is) concerned with the absorption of art history and theory by art itself (meaning to a large extent, by artists), for it is out of such matters (or at least the presup- positions that permit the array of variant histo- ries and theories in a given age) that we make or have our sincere and serious commitments to artrealm. The artworld, as Danto understands it, threatens to exclude all but an inner circle who care little for the profundities that authoritatively guide the larger realm. The contemporary scene, so severely de- 151 scribed by Danto, only culminates a long pro- cess visible at least retrospectively throughout the late 19th and the 20th centuries. The anti- authoritarian urge in English Romantic liter- ature emerges in painting with the Impression- ists and Post-Impressionists. When nothing au- thoritative informs how we see, we are each thrown back upon our own resources. Common ways of viewing give way to temporary alliances, conversational agreements to see something com- monly. The viewer, whether critic, expert, col- lector, curator, patron, or art lover, becomes his or her own interpreter. Art goes the way of reli- gion when every man is his own priest: self- confidence, except as veneer or shrill protesta- tion, disappears. The suspicion of forgery can wreak havoc among those dependent upon art. V. WHAT SUSPICION RISKS Perhaps the most interesting question to ask at this point is why the dependents of art find risk in the suspicion of forgery. Not every suspicion puts so much of ourselves at risk. We may sus- pect the quality of food-or of a specific food- at a supermarket without this degree of risk, even though our lives may be at stake. Episodes of food tampering have made many people wary. They carefully examine food and pharmaceuti- cal packaging. If a tear or wrinkle arouses suspi- cion, shoppers choose another item or another brand, or they withhold purchase altogether. They lack confidence in the product, the pack- age, or the store. Rarely do they lose confidence in themselves, even if ingesting the product could kill them. More pervasively problematical is a night walk down a modern city street. The shadows arouse suspicions as something seems to move in the dark. The apparent movement suggests without entailing danger. We hurry our step- cross the street-huddle within our clothes as if that gesture could make us less visible. Fear rises within us, for few of us have the size or skills to defeat or discourage an armed attacker. Our confidence drops as fear rises until despair controls our every step. A cat leaps from his moving shadow and disappears beneath a grat- ing. Eschewing that evidence, we hurry toward the light. Only then do we pause to let embar- rassment over our groundless fears replace the fears themselves. The shadows stole something</page><page sequence="6">152 from us. The night found out a weakness, expos- ing it for all time and all to see. Because we must forevermore see it, we can never believe that others do not see it also. We can never forget the theft of our cover. In the exposure of our weak- ness, our flaw, we are less than we were. Surely suspicion that an artwork is a forgery does not carry this degree of risk and loss. Circumstantially, art occurs in too peaceful, serene, and protected a setting to threaten such a loss. Yet, those who think art is significant risk important losses of self-esteem because the sus- picion of art forgery has more kinship to the suspicion in a dark city alley than to the suspi- cion of adulterated food in a market. The contrast of the market and the alley illum- inates something special about the nature of sus- picion: its proper object. In the market, the objects under scrutiny were the objects of suspi- cion. There, we need merely to be vigilant and cautious in order to survive the possible threat. In the alley, neither the alley nor its contents were under suspicion. Rather, they served to occasion our suspicions about ourselves. Suspi- cion's demand for lucidity points where we do not wish it to point: squarely at us. Near the alley, we stand convicted of our weakness solely by having our suspicions. Suspicion of art forgery also convicts us of our weakness without need for final certainty of the betrayal, of which Sparshott speaks so elo- quently. As Sparshott would have it, "forgery is betrayal that must give deep and justified of- fense." He notes further that the "ease with which we are taken in and our trust betrayed is sad. "'3 The trust of which we speak here is not merely the everyday trust we place in others, but the special trust we place in someone we love. For Sparshott, forgeries are not unlike dirty jokes of sexual acts drained of love that reduce their object "to something less than human, less even than human flesh. " 14 The specialness of the trust of love and other human relationships lies foremost in the risk it carries. We cannot know, but only trust the faithfulness of the lover. We cannot know be- cause love is not a subject for knowing, for certainty as justified true belief. For the question of love is not whether A loved at place P and time T. Rather, love's question is always a matter of whether A still loves, that is, whether A will still be able to be seen as loving in all A does. Not The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism yesterday, but today and tomorrow are the con- cerns of love. And they are unpredictable. With love, therefore, and with other relationships among humans, we can only trust. Most of what passes for suspicion of infidelity is only our resistance to accepting the fact that one is not loved. The matter has passed beyond the suggestion of possible unfaithfulness to a mass of evidence establishing infidelity. We blind ourselves so that we will not see the evi- dence. That is our willfulness, not our suspi- cion, at play. Small wonder at the explosion of vituperation (or worse) when the facts grow so plain that we can no longer deny them to our- selves. As Eric Hoffer has noted: "We lie loud- est when we lie to ourselves."15 The din will cover the sound of truth that any uninvolved person can hear. When the silence of honesty sets in, the result is normally violent. We claim to resent being made a fool, but the silent voice tells us that we resent most having made fools of ourselves. Similarly, when we suspect another of infidel- ity, we expose not the other's weakness, but our own: our inability to so captivate the other that the other will remain faithful. After all, we expect ourselves to be able to capture the love of another surely, completely, and durably. Our doubts in this expectation show in the dread we have of betrayal. We even hate ourselves for having suspicions. And so, too, with art-for those dependent upon art. We give ourselves to the work, respond to it, admire it, cherish it. Even the harshest critic cherishes art, or else no work could cap- ture his attention sufficiently to repel him. Indeed, there are at least two modes of trust. We may freely trust, freely give trust as a bestowal upon the object of trust. Or we may trust because we have no choice within our dependency upon the object of trust. We give ourselves because we would embrace, possess, what we need. There is a risk to freely-given trust, but only in the trust of dependency do we truly risk ourselves. In giving ourselves to the work, to art, we have doubts about the very sense, or at least the propriety, of what we are doing, or perhaps our ability to do it. Otherwise, we would not need experts to counsel us on which works deserve our attention, our response, and our admiration. We would not need so much talk of and about art. Talk smothers in profundities our need to</page><page sequence="7">Cebik On the Suspicion of an Art Forgery give ourselves. But profundities can only cover the risk to ourselves; they cannot expunge it. Suspicion of forgery, of betrayal, of having been used, reveals to us our doubts about having involved ourselves in art. The realm of art lacks what supermarkets have: the general communal pervasiveness which breeds a confidence that takes supermar- kets for granted. Only in such cases-that is, where we cannot sensibly question our partici- pation in the enterprise-can we suspect an ob- ject with no risk of exposing ourselves. How- ever, the realm of fine art remains special, apart from the mainstream of daily life-even for those whose careers involve intimate connection with it. As artrealm grows more self-inclosed, the greater is the distance we must traverse in our commitment to it. As the chasm between every- day communal life and art grows greater, so too grow the risks to ourselves in committing our- selves to art. Generally, the viewer stands alone. Art criti- cism and analysis yield, at most, a small group camaraderie. Unlike the everyday community, the camaraderie of fine art can be fleeting and fickle. Upon a single wrong word or errant reac- tion-so it seems-acceptance into the group turns into ostracism. At the same time, we may argue theories and interpretations as part of the normal communion among members of the cote- rie. The damnable fickleness of art hinges on the fact that one day's perfect reaction or response is the next day's fatal faux pas. We may normally walk confidently the halls of great galleries. But the suspicion of a forgery breaks our confi- dence, not in art, but in ourselves. Nothing in the world has changed, except the framework within which we perceive it. The devastating power of self-doubt to trans- form the perspective within which we perceive our world is well-recorded in literature and else- where. Perhaps the most notable fictional ac- count is Camus's The Fall. Self-doubt trans- figures a single everyday event into a doorway to an entirely new perspective on life and living. That event was a laugh. "Taken by surprise, " Clamence hears the laugh as if it were for him, as if it were at him. With his suspicion about the laughter begins his long road downward, through other laughter and later through other kinds of laughter. In the end, Clamence becomes a self- inclosed judge-penitent.16 The world had not 153 changed, but Clamence had. Likewise, we may claim disillusionment with art, as if art had somehow changed. However, both illusion and disillusion speak to how we see, not to how things are. VI. THE WAGES OF SELF-SUSPICION Short of disillusionment, our self-suspicions reflect upon others (and not, as convention would have it, the other way around, with the suspicions of others occasioning, if not causing, our self-suspicions). The awareness of individ- ual blemishes, as Hoffer has noted, inclines us "to detect ill will and meanness in [our] fellow men. Self-contempt, however vague, sharpens our eyes for the imperfections of others. We usually strive to reveal in others the blemishes we hide in ourselves."''7 Thus, the seeming iso- lation of individual suspicion of forgery ac- quires a social dimension. Where one suspects, all but the blithely blind suspect and exercise due caution. Or perhaps it is undue caution, for the "pathological mistrust within the ranks [or group] leads not to dissension but to strict con- formity."''8 Strict orthodoxy of behavior and opinion replace cordial tolerance of disagree- ment and spontaneous actions and reactions. Both the suspecting and the suspected lover grow self-righteous in word and deed. When we can no longer trust, we fall back upon rigid conventionality. The parallels between art and love (or other trusting human relationships) may seem odd. For art consists of a series of artifacts, perfor- mances, and objects, not of other people. Yet, viewing a work as a communication between the artist and the viewer seems inevitable, even if this position seems but a rationalization of our practice of letting works speak to us. Accusa- tions of having committed an intentional fallacy do not deter us from cementing the identity of the work with the identity of the artist. But such cement is unnecessary for us to bestow upon the work of art a soul of its own that speaks to us. We need no theory to anthropomorphize a work of art, any more than a child needs a theory to speak to and listen to toys and teddy bears. There are, perhaps, only two other such com- plete anthropomorphic transformations that would support parallels to human romantic love. We cannot rule out the possibility of others, and</page><page sequence="8">154 certainly at an idiosyncratic level, there may well be many more. In Repetition (and else- where), Kierkegaard exploits the loving rela- tionship of the lover and the loved to dem- onstrate some special properties of religious faith. 19 The other transformation has yet to stand philosophic treatment, perhaps because our love for and giving of ourselves to domestic pets may not seem sufficiently important.20 However, the animal rights movement may be in some part a measure of our increasing bestowal of human properties upon at least certain animals. Whether animals in fact have the properties or whether some humans need animals to have the properties is in theory so far moot. To the degree that at least some people use animals as sub- stitutes for humans in trusting, loving rela- tionships bespeaks a need that obviates the lesser need for rationalistic argument or empirical evidence. What all these cases have in common goes beyond certain parallels to love. All of them can (though they need not) be used as substitutes for human relationships. For some people, religion, art, and pets are all, if not to the same degree, far more reliable as objects of intimacy than other human beings. A god who deserts one in an hour of need, a pet who bites the proverbial hand that feeds, and an art forgery yield for such people similar senses of loss, betrayal, and use. As a substitute for human interaction and communication, art already betrays Sparshott's desire to portray it as more than analogous to love. He likens the question, "What is wrong with forgery?" to the question, "What is wrong with free sex?" in which one substitutes "an alternative sex object for the loved one. "21 But this likeness already confuses loved ones with sex objects, in contrast to alternative sex ob- jects. Betrayal in romantic love only requires another loved one, not a mere sex object. Often, only after disillusionment (or in fear of it) with the loved one-and through that one with love itself-do we turn to sex objects as substitutes for loved ones. We require cynicism to achieve the cheap taw- driness Sparshott sees in alternative sex ob- jects.22 If loving a forgery resembles this cyni- cal posture, then loving art, however genuine, already marks an order of disillusionment paral- lel to moving from loved ones to sex objects. What the relationship lacks is one whole side of The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism the full span of human interaction. With humans we both speak and hear, act and react, give and receive. Like our relation to sex objects, loving art is one-sided, the sort of thing out of which we make fantasies. With a sex object, the other never matters, so long as it meets some initial conditions for pos- session. It is the vehicle upon which we fantasize or upon which we slay fantasy. We do our will with the object, however ideal or scurrilous our hidden desires. So too with works of art: we make them speak to us, inventing for them the right words to say, the right message to give. This is one secret of the interpretation of art; the other is to make the interpretation sufficiently impersonal so that others may adopt some or all of it.23 The seemingly passive disinterested role of one who experiences art is at best a sham. Passivity makes of art a mere object. Art is more because we actively make it more. We give it interest, voice, feeling, importance, and profun- dity. Or, rather, we give each work in which we take an interest a specific and individual voice, feelings, importance, and profundities. Of course it gives them back. It is a commonplace that jealousy is only possible if we treat a loved one as a possession, as a kind of object that we already treat sub- humanly. This is perhaps the paradox of bestow- ing the human rather than in encountering the human: in the very act of bestowal, we dehu- manize that on which we bestow humanity. It becomes a possession, an extension of our- selves. We jealously guard our possession, thus revealing the degree to which we are dependent upon it. So, too, do we guard our art, dependent upon it to give us what we righteously demand or humbly beg. The difference of approach makes no difference to the dependency. Whether person or artwork, we will not tolerate the loss or altera- tion of that which lets us be what only in fanta- sies we can be or dare to be. The work or the person who turns out to be "false" incurs our wrath, which covers up the bitter taste of our own inadequacy, our inability to hold onto our possession. We were tricked. It was not what was supposed to be. The painting, the mistress, the gigolo did not change. Rather, we changed. We forgot that we were investing ourselves in that which gives no guarantees. We stand exposed in our weakness, naked in our chagrin. We had dressed it in garb to fool our</page><page sequence="9">Cebik On the Suspicion ofanArtForgery 155 own eyes, and now we see it for what we knew it to be all along, a substitute and a fickle one at that. Such is the inhumanly self-imposed cruel world of those who confuse either art or love with simple ecstasy. Love, of course, is some- thing else. And so, too, is art. Or at least, it once was. The heart of the art lover is, in the end, no simple thing. Nor is there but a single way to love art. Nonetheless, understanding how con- temporary art patrons relate to art requires that we view patrons in their involvement. Past stud- ies of forgery have missed the moment of in- volvement by concentrating upon forgery's ori- gins and aftermath. At both these points, they almost inevitably encounter only the art, plus a set of rational considerations for appropriately labeling or relabeling a work. By catching the art lover in the act of suspecting a forgery, we open the possibility of capturing a different set of operative categories through which to examine our relationship to art. If these phenomenal speculations have any merit at all, it is to raise some new and potentially productive questions about art. L.B.

La Rochefoucauld wrote in a variation to Maxim 32 that jealousy is a "passion qui cherche toujours de nouveaux sujets d'inquietude, et de nouveaux tourments." La Rochefoucauld, p. 272. Of course, he addresses not so much the core of jealousy as the suspicion it necessarily includes. 5.

I prefer the label "artrealm" to the term "artworld," popularized by Danto and Dickie. The latter has grown to indicate not only a certain subset of our social and cultural institutions, but also a body of theoretical considerations. The label "artrealm" circumscribes broadly a collection of institutions and activities, but permits one to describe as- pects of them without prior theoretical commitments. More- over, the notion of a realm of art seems less encompassing and less distant than a world of art. 7. Norman Miller, "Three Arguments on the Death of Art" in The Death of Art, ed. B.

Kierkegaard also recognized that even in human relationships, the other may have no character other than that which we bestow upon that person.

In Dominance and Affection: The Making of Pets (Yale University Press, 1984), Yi-Fu Tuan attempts a study of pets that he misleadingly characterizes as "descriptive psychology" (p. ix). His orientation is that of the social scientist who excludes "love" as an operative concept in favor of dominance and affection (pp. 1-2). Such an orien- tation, while illuminating the history of pets, is foreign to the perspective of this essay. For example, the dominance- affection combination limits attention to only certain behaviors, such as the exertion of power or, in contrast, play. Missing are a multitude of everyday behaviors and, of course, the pet-owner's dependence upon and commitment to the pet. The perspective from which this essay emerges recognizes, contrary to Tuan, that many expressions of power in society are also, if not mostly, expressions of weakness. 21.
