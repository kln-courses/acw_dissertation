<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND NEWS We are happy to be able to announce the appearance of the first number of a new and highly useful periodical entitled Bib- liographie de Philosophie. An International Institute of Philo- sophical Collaboration has been formed, whose executive officers include L. Robin, A. Petziill, IH. Kuhn, E. S. Brightman, F. En- riques, J. D. Bierens De Haan, H. J. Pos, W. D. Ross, and W. P. Montague. Under the direction of this Institute there will appear two numbers annually of an international bibliography of philoso- phy. The bibliography will be as complete as it is possible to make it for scholarly books and articles on philosophy in all the major languages and is organized by both authors and sub-</page><page sequence="2">NOTES AND NEWS 699 jects. It also contailns at least the beginnlings of a diction- ary of current technical terms. The chief bibliographer is Dr. H. L. Kauffmann of the University of Paris. The publisher is J. Vrin and all communications should be addressed care of the pub- lisher, 6 Place de la Sorbonne, France. For the present the price of the annual subscription (two numbers) is 150 francs. The chief American collaborator is Dr. Maurice MIandelbaum of Swarthmore College who will be glad to receive advice and co6peration from American students of philosophy. The first number of this bibliography begins with January 1937. Readers of the JOURNAL will notice that our last annual biblio- graphy ends with December 1936. The new international bib- liography therefore begins where ours ends. In view of the fact that this new publication is much more adequate and comprehen- sive, the JOURNAL is discontinuing its annual bibliography which it has published for the years 1933-1936 and is glad to recommend to its readers this new bibliographical periodical. We take this occasion to point out that within a year or so the bibliography for the years 1902-1932, sponsored by the American Philosophical Association, will be ready; that the annual biblio- graphy of the JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY covers the years 1933-1936, and that the new periodical will carry on from 1937. Thus a con- tinuous bibliographical service is provided from the date when Benjamin Rand's bibliography in Baldwin's Dictionary terminates. The four numbers of the JOURNAL'S Bibliography of Philosophy 1933-1936 may be purchased while they last for the price of $2.75. We print below the program of the Thirty-seventh Annual Meeting of the Eastern Division of the American Philosophical Association which will be held at Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey, December 28, 29, and 30, 1937.
