X</page><page sequence="8">PREFACE In this second volume of the final report on the excavations at Timnah (Tel Batash) in the northern Shephelah of Judah, we present the finds from the first millennium BCE, i.e. the Iron Age II and the Persian period (Strata IV-I). The first volume ( Tim- nah I) presented the stratigraphie and architectural data from the entire excavation. In the present vol- ume, the finds are related to the stratigraphie phases and architectural units of Strata IV-I as defined in the first volume. Our intention was to present large amounts of data in as objective a way as possible. Thus, the 106 plates of drawings were arranged according to homogeneous architectural units or groups of loci of similar stratigraphie nature in each of the excavation areas. A large additional amount of pottery, not included in the plates, was registered and quantified, resulting in a rich database. The pottery was studied according to a typological classification that was constantly examined in conjunction with the stratigraphie data. The comparative study of the pot- tery and the other artifacts aimed to define diachronic and spatial questions concerning our site and the region of the northern Shephelah in the Iron Age II. Research on the Iron Age II finds from Tel Batash began during the excavation seasons. The research program was established by A. Mazar, and at that time M. Fleitman was the registrar. During this phase the typological scheme was established and the typological registration of the entire pottery assem- blage was carried out. From 1990 onwards, N. Panitz-Cohen served as registrar and later as main researcher. Based on the initial research program, she wrote the first draft of Chapter II (the main chapter in this volume) and Chapters V, VI and VIII :B-D. The pottery of Strata IV- III was the subject of her M.A. dissertation, submitted to the Hebrew University in 1999. A. Mazar wrote the first draft of Chapters I, III, IV:A-B and IX. During and following the writing phases, all details were continuously discussed, checked, extended and revised by both authors. Thus, we share responsibility for the contents. We thank several people who contributed to the accomplishment of this volume. The drawings were prepared by M. Ben-Meir, A. Boas, S. Culiner, C. Hersch and R. Solar. The pottery was restored by L. Keim and O. Mazar. Most of the photographs were taken by G. Laron and Z. Radovan, and some were supplied by the Israel Antiquities Authority. The data processing was carried out by N. Applbaum, who also prepared the graphs and the locus lists. Some groups of finds were studied by experts, whom we thank for their cooperation and con- tributions. Unfortunately, the report on the rich assemblages of animal bones that we collected was not available to us. We hope to be able to incorporate it in the third and last volume, which will essentially be dedicated to the finds from the second millennium BCE. References and abbreviations for the entire vol- ume are given in the General Bibliography. For excavation reports and other studies to which refer- ence is frequently made, especially in the pottery sections, abbreviations are used; otherwise the author-date system is used. All centuries are BCE, unless otherwise noted. The research and preparation for publication of the finds from Timnah was made possible thanks to funds of the Philip and Muriel Berman Center for Biblical Archaeology in the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University, and thanks to a research grant for the years 1994-1996 provided by the Israel Science Foundation of the Israel Academy of Sci- ences and Humanities. Special thanks are due to George L. and Linda Keim, who initiated the Tel Batash expedition in 1977 on behalf of the South- western Baptist Theological Seminary at Forth Worth and made it possible with their efforts and enthusi- asm. This volume was copy-edited and brought to press by S. Gorodetsky, whom we sincerely thank for her efforts. The Authors March 1999 XI</page><page sequence="9">CHAPTER I CONTEXTUAL DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA IN THE PLATES Drawings of the pottery and other finds discussed in this volume are presented in 106 plates. Our approach in preparing these plates was to present all the finds from well-defined architectural units, i.e. whole buildings or groups of loci that belong to the same architectural and stratigraphie horizon. The plates are arranged according to the four main excavation areas in chronological order, from the earliest stratum to the latest, as follows: Areas D and £ Pis. 1-5: Stratum IVB in Area D. Pis. 6-9: Stratum IV in Area D. Pis. 10-12: Stratum IV in Area E. Pis. 13-23: Stratum III in Area D. Pis. 24-30: Stratum III in Area E. Pis. 31-40: Stratum II in Area D. Pis. 41-56: Stratum II in Area E. Pis. 57-63: Strata III- II streets in Areas D and E. Area F Pis. 64-75: Stratum II. Pis. 76-78: Stratum I and surface finds in Areas E and F. Area H Pl. 79: Stratum V-IVB. Pis. 80-86: Stratum IV. Pis. 87-93: Stratum III. Pis. 94-98:1-10: Stratum II. Pis. 98:11-19; 99: Stratum I, surface finds and pits. Area C Pis. 100-101:1-10: Stratum IV. PI. 101:11-14: Stratum III. Pis. 102-104: Stratum II. PI. 105: Stratum I. PI. 106: Various objects. Though finds from Stratum V (Iron Age I) will be discussed separately in the following volume, a few Stratum V sherds are included in PL 79, since they belong to mixed fills related to Stratum IV in Area H or to loci that are borderline in their stratigraphie attribution. An attempt has been made to define architectural units and to present the contents of each unit as a whole. This was relatively simple in the presentation of material from Stratum II, where complete or almost complete buildings were revealed, and the contents of each building are presented in a group of plates. However, the definition of architectural units in Strata IV-III was less clear-cut, since the excavation was more fragmentary, as was the nature of the finds. Accordingly, the finds from these strata have been divided into groups of related loci or even individual loci. The graphic presentation includessi the complete vessels found or restored and a large representative collection of pottery sherds, as well as most of the special finds and a sample of the stone objects. Though the presentation of many examples of identical or similar forms in various plates may appear redundant, it was thought justified to present the maximum amount of homogeneous assemblages, reflecting as objectively and comprehensively as possible the development of pottery and other objects at our site between the 10th and 7th centuries. We believe that this is the optimal method of advancing research on the subject. Thousands of additional sherds that could be classified typologically and originate from stratified loci were also processed, as described in Chapter II: A. In order to enable a concentrated overview of the pottery assemblage, the main pottery types are presented in separate typological figures at the beginning of the discussion of each type. Note that 1</page><page sequence="10">these typological figures are arranged in the order in which the types appear in the textual discussion. A key to the pages of the textual discussion of each pottery type is given at the beginning of the Plates volume. Additional tools are the locus lists (pp. 286- 293), first published with more detailed stratigraphie data in Timnah I ; these contain references to the pottery plates in which the contents of each locus appear, and specify whether the pottery from the locus was included in the typological registration. Thus the reader may easily locate the finds from each locus and identify the stratigraphie context of any pottery assemblage. In the following section, the various assemblages as presented in the plates are briefly described (for detailed descriptions of the stratigraphy and architecture, see Timnah I). AREAS D AND E STRATUM IVB IN AREA D: PLS. 1-5 Timnah I: 182, Plan P/S 81 These plates present the finds from the early phase of Stratum IV in the eastern part of Area D. PI. 1 : Pottery from two loci in the northern part of the area: pebble floor D821 and ash and brick debris D1250. Pis. 2-5:1-9: Pottery from Loci D705, D706, D707, D808, D819 and D 1259. These are Stratum IVB surfaces and floors in Squares K-30-31 and J-32. Most of the pottery originates from surfaces near Oven D810 and from pebble floors that were probably part of an early phase of the street on the northern side of Squares K-30-32. PL 5:10-20: Pottery from Locus D 1023, a beaten earth floor in Square L-30. STRATUM IV IN AREA D: PLS. 6-9 Timnah I: 180-185, Plans P/S 80, 82 PL 6: Pottery and various objects from Unit D809, a partly excavated building in Squares J-30-3 1 (Loci D708, D809, D812, D820). Pis. 7-8:1-12: Pottery and various objects from Building 756 (Squares K-L-30-31: Loci 752b, 756, 774, 858, 861, D1022, D1047). Most of these loci can be attributed to the later phase of Stratum IV, though in some cases the attribution to one of the phases of Stratum IV is not secure, e.g. D 1047, which may be either IVB or IVA. 2 PL 8:13-18: Pottery from Locus D1026, reddish brown debris in Square L-32. Stratigraphically, this layer may be attributed to IVB, or even to Stratum V; however, the pottery recovered from this locus typologically suits Stratum IV. PL 9:1-16: Sherds and a bronze bracelet fragment from accumulation above the pebble surface of Street 875, the east-west street in Squares K-30-32 (Loci 874, 875, D817). The few sherds from Locus D803 came from the makeup of the street floor. PL 9:17-22: Six sherds from Pit 862. This pit, in the southern part of Square K-3 1 , appears to cut Floor 858 of Stratum IVA. However, most of the pottery in the pit can be typologically attributed to Stratum IV, and may originate from backfill material. STRATUM IV IN AREA E: PLS. 10-12 Timnah I: 185-186, Plans P/S 80, 82 In Area E, virtually no distinction between the two phases of Stratum IV could be made. Most of the pottery and other finds originate from fills. Pis. 10-11:1-10: The sherds in these plates represent a large quantity of pottery from the constructional fill E708a-b. Most of the pottery in the fill typologically fits Stratum IV, though the lower baskets suit Stratum V, and those sherds will be presented in the forthcoming volume. PL 11:11-18: Pottery from gray ash debris E717 in Square L-25, probably a fill or an accumulation of debris above a surface. PL 11:19: A jug found in baulk cleaning and attributed to Stratum IV on typological grounds. PL 12:1-10: Pottery and objects from Loci 995 and 999 (Square K-27), a fill below Building 950 of Stratum II, containing some earlier (Stratum V) sherds such as the krater (No. 3). PL 12:11-16: Pit E626 (Square J-27). The pit is covered by Wall E603, which is also attributed to Stratum IV. Thus, it may belong to Phase IVB. PL 12:17-20: Pottery from Locus E809, a patch of a floor in Square K-26. STRATUM III IN AREA D: PLS. 13-23 Timnah /: 187-194, Plans P/S 83, 84 Pis. 13-21: Building 737 and the street to its north The plates are arranged in the sequence of bowls (Pis. 13-14), kraters (PL 15:1-18), cooking pots (PL</page><page sequence="11">15:19-22), storage jars (Pis. 16-1 8), stamped handles (PL 19), holemouth jars (PL 21:1-9), jugs (PL 21:10- 26), juglets (PL 21:27-31), a stone weight (PL 21:32) and a spindle whorl (PL 21:33). The material from Building 737 includes secure loci from the stone floor in Squares J-30-32: Loci 734, 737, 748. Most of the LMLK jars and "scoops" (BL 18; PL 14:15-18) were found smashed on this floor. Secure floors in the west of the building (Squares J-K-L-30) are Loci 740, 750 and 857. Pl. 20 represents two groups of jars, each consisting of three "Timnah storage jars" (SJ 7). The northern group was found in a pit cut through lime floor 744 (Locus 753, Square K-30); the jars of the southern group (Locus 857, Square L-30) were embedded in the white lime floor 782 (the continuation of Floor 744), their rims flush with the floor. Aside from stone floor 773 (where several LMLK jar sherds were also found) in the east of Square K-32, the southern part of the building (Squares K-30-32) contains less secure loci. The five sherds from Floor 755 were found either on the patchy pebble floor 755 itself or in the debris in its vicinity, where the stratigraphy is less secure. Pottery from Loci 731 and 864 comes from the foundation trench of Stratum II Wall 176. This foundation trench was cut into Stratum III debris, and most of the material from it relates to Stratum III; however, the nature of a foundation trench suggests possible contamination. The pottery from Locus 852 in Square H-32 (nine sherds) is stratigraphically problematic, as this stone pavement of Stratum III was perhaps in secondary use in Stratum II as well. However, we decided to include the pottery from this floor in the Stratum III plates. These plates also include pottery from Square H-30: Debris 765 above Floors D710 and D711, which are possibly street levels of Stratum III and are north of the defined limits of Building 737. A few sherds in these plates come from floor makeups. The holemouth jar in PL 21:1 comes from Locus 865, the makeup of Floor 748. The krater in PL 15:15 comes from Locus D802, the makeup of Floor 740. The bowl sherd in PL 14:10 and the jug sherds in PL 21:14, 26 come from Locus 856, the makeup of Floor 755. Pis. 22-23: Stratum III Building 780 The pottery from this area (Squares L-N-29-31) comes mostly from eroded surfaces. The wall foundations of Stratum II were found at the same level as the Stratum III floors, and thus only patchy remains of the latter were preserved. The pottery is arranged in the plates according to loci, as follows: PL 22:1-14: Pottery from debris in Loci D1046 and D 1048 (Square M-30). These loci were sealed by poor floors of Stratum II and were resting on top of Stratum IV walls. PL 22:15-19: Pottery from stone and plaster floor D 1004 in a room west of Wall D10 17. Pl. 22:20: An amphora from Floor D1018. This floor was exposed only in a narrow strip to the east of Stratum II Wall D1019; this vessel was uncovered underneath the stones of this wall. PL 23:1-5: Pottery from Locus D1003, mudbrick debris on a patchy plaster floor above a stone pavement east of Wall D1264 in Square L-32. PL 23:6-15: Pottery from Loci D1211 and D1212, mudbrick debris on both sides of Wall D1210 (Square N-30). Though no clear floor level was found in most of this area, the pottery comes from a homogeneous layer. PL 23:16: An unstratified bowl uncovered during baulk removal in Square N-29, attributed typo- logically to Stratum III. STRATUM III IN AREA E: PLS. 24-30 Timnah 1 : 194-201, Plan P/S 83 Pis. 24-26: Stratum III floors in the western part of Area E The assemblages come from Loci E702 (Square L-K- 25), E709 (Square K-25), 910b (Square K-26) and E719 (Squares J-K-25). Locus E702 is a patchy pebble surface above Strata IV-V Fill E708, which might represent a street running between Walls E713 and E822. Locus E709 is a plaster floor south of Wall E628. PL 24:19 is a fragment of a "scoop" (BL 18) uncovered in Locus 910b (brown debris underneath Stratum II Floor 910a in Square K-26). The six bowls in PL 26:17-22 were found together in Locus E719, debris on a white plaster floor north of Wall E628. Pis. 27-30: Other Stratum III loci PL 27:1-6: Sherds from Locus E618 (Square K-28), a constructional fill underneath Stratum II Floor 958, excavated in a small probe. Some may belong to the building period of Stratum II. 3</page><page sequence="12">Pl. 27:7-9: A few sherds and a decorated bone object from Loci 987 and 988 (Square K-27), which are earth layers and perhaps floors found slightly below Stratum II Floors 958 and 959. The stratigraphie attribution is not secure, as these loci may belong to an earlier phase of Stratum II. PI. 27:10-13: A few sherds from Fill E607 (Square L-26) underneath the makeup of Stratum II plaster floor 915. These sherds predate Stratum II, though their exact stratigraphie attribution between Strata IV and II is uncertain. PI. 27:14-19: Sherds from Locus E622 (Square K- 26), which represents a patchy pebble floor reached in a small probe to the south of and below Stratum II Wall 923. PI. 28-29:1-5. An assemblage consisting of eleven complete restored vessels, along with a collection of sherds, from Locus E619 (Square L-26), a plaster floor related to Walls E720 and E704. This pottery assemblage, the most complete recovered from Stratum III, may represent an earlier phase of Stratum III (see Timnah /: 197-198). PI. 29:6-18: Pottery from Fill E703a-c (Square L- 25), a constructional fill below Stratum II Building 915. PI. 29:19: A bowl sherd from Floor E624 (Square K-26), which also yielded two of the three figurine molds presented in the following plate. PI. 30: Two figurine molds from pebble floor E624 and a mold from the top of Fill E705, just below the floor (Squares L-K-26). Floor E624 was stratigraphically attributed to Stratum III since it is lower than the stone foundations of Stratum II walls. STRATUM II IN AREA D, BUILDING 743: PLS. 31-40 Timnah /: 203-205, Plan P/S 85 This large assemblage from the four spaces in Building 743 is arranged in the sequence of bowls (Pis. 31-32:1-7), various sherds of kraters, chalices, jugs and a votive bowl (PI. 32:8-14), kraters (PL 33), cooking pots (PI. 34), storage jars (Pis. 35-36), jugs and bottles (PI. 37), juglets, stands and votive vessels (PI. 38), various objects, loomweights, stone finds (PI. 39) and metal implements (PI. 40). The rich collection of pottery and objects recovered from the destruction debris on the floors of this building is a representative Stratum II assemblage, well dated to the final phase of the Iron Age II at Tel Batash. This 4 varied assemblage contains a plethora of domestic and storage vessels, loomweights and stones for use in domestic industry, as well as inscribed weights and several luxury items. The distribution of the finds in this building is presented in pp. 165-167 and Fig. 11. The loomweights in PI. 39:10-15 were found on Floor 743, concentrated along the southern part of Wall 783. The scarab (PI. 39:2) was found inside an intact holemouth jar (PI. 36:5), sunk into Floor 778. The mortarium (BL 20) in PI. 32:7 comes from Locus 786 (Square L-29), which is a patchy floor south of the southern wall of Building 743. This rather undefined area is bordered on the south by Wall D 1228 and may represent either a southern room of Building 743 or an open area south of the building. STRATUM II IN AREA E: PLS. 41-56 Timnah /: 211-222, Plan P/S 85 Pis. 41-53: Oil Press Building 950 This large assemblage is arranged in the sequence of bowls (Pis. 41-42:1-2), kraters (Pis. 42:3-8; 43:1), cooking pots (Pis. 43:2-7; 44:1-5), stands (PI. 44:6- 7), storage jars (Pis. 45-47), jugs and bottles (Pis. 48- 49), juglets, lamps, votive vessels, special sherds and a vat (PI. 50), various objects (PI. 51) and stone objects (Pis. 52-53). The distribution of the finds in this building is presented in pp. 167-169 and Fig. 12. Of special interest is the "krater/storage jar" (KR 30) in PI. 47:9, found in Locus 950, northeast of the northernmost monolith. A similar vessel (PI. 49:7) was uncovered in Locus 958 (Square K-28). One cooking pot fragment (PI. 44:4) comes from Locus E609, red debris underneath the surface related to the oil press. A jug (PI. 48:1) and stone roller (PI. 52:3) from the debris of Locus 981 (Square L-28) are included in the assemblage from Building 950, though it is not certain whether this locus constitutes part of the building {Timnah /: 218). Two later sherds were mistakenly included in the assemblage from Building 950, as they come from topsoil directly above the destruction debris of this building: the juglet in PI. 50:3 from Locus 944 (Square J-25) and the mortarium in PI. 42:2 from Locus 908 (Square K-26); the latter locus is also included in PI. 76:12, 14. Pis. 54-56: Unit 914 The assemblage in these plates comes from Unit 914</page><page sequence="13">(Loci 933, 914, 931, 910a in Squares K-L-25-26). The two chalices (Pl. 56:1-2) were recovered from Locus 910a, which should perhaps be understood as a cultic platform in a niche. The bowl in PL 55:1, from Locus 916, is included in this assemblage, though the locus (debris just below topsoil north of Wall 926) was attributed to Stratum I. STREETS AND VARIOUS LOCI OF STRATA III-II (PLS. 57-63) Pis. 57-62 include pottery and objects from street levels running along the southern face of the city wall through Areas D and E (Squares J-H-27, 29-30). Exact stratigraphie differentiation between Strata II and III concerning the street levels was not always possible (see Timnah I: 199-201). PL 57:1-15: Pottery, a bone pendant and a figurine from Locus 150 (Square H-29) of Stratum III. PL 57:16-24: Sherds from Locus 993 (Square H-27), which represents the lowest street level, most likely laid in Stratum III. However, it is possible that this layer is contaminated. PL 58-59: Sherds and objects from the middle street level (Loci 147, 738, 739, 971, 972, 976) used in Stratum II. A stamped LMLK handle (PL 59:16) and a handle with incised concentric circles (Pl. 59:15) were found on the surface of the street. The stratigraphie attribution of this street level to Stratum II is not certain; it is possible that parts of it (i.e. the stone paving of Locus 971 and Drain 972) originated in Stratum III, while the pottery shown in Pis. 58-59 represents a phase of its use during Stratum II. Pis. 60-62: Pottery and objects from the uppermost street level (Stratum II): Loci 142 (Square H-29) and 730 (Square H-30). This street level is marked by a concentration of pottery revealed just below topsoil; a clear floor was found only in Locus 142. Two handles with LMLK (PL 61:13) and rosette (PL 61:14) seal impressions were found together in this level. The "footbath" in PL 62 is reconstructed in the drawing from several frag- ments found in Locus 730. PL 63:1-6: An assemblage of five pottery vessels and one storage jar rim from Locus 173 (Square J-29), a plaster surface related to Installation 174, attributed to Stratum IIA, a scanty occupation phase succeeding the destruction of Stratum II (see Timnah /: 222). PL 63:7-13: Sherds from Building 915 (Squares L- 25-26). The lamp in PL 63:12, which underwent restoration in antiquity, was recovered in Wall 926. AREA F STRATUM II IN AREA F: PLS. 64-75 Timnah /: 237-245, Plan P/S 102 Pis. 64-70: Building F608 This assemblage of 67 complete and almost complete vessels and various objects from Building F608 is arranged in the sequence of bowls (PL 64), chalices, kraters and cooking pots (PL 65), storage jars (Pis. 66-67), amphorae and jugs (PL 68), bottles, juglets, lamp and various objects (PL 69), metal and stone objects (PL 70). This rich assemblage, found in the destruction debris covering the floors of the building, reflects the various domestic and industrial activities that took place in this building during the final phase of Iron II at the site. The distribution of vessels and objects in the building is presented in pp. 169-171 and Fig. 13. Loci F603 (Squares K-L-19) and F606 (Square M-19) are not depicted in the plan of this building, as they represent the destruction debris below topsoil down to the stone floors F648 and F633 respectively. Locus F637, in the southern part of the building, is a disturbed area, containing some Stratum I material (such as the cooking pot in PL 65:10). A juglet (PL 69:4) and an iron object found inside it (Pl. 70:1) from Locus F638 were included in this assemblage, though this locus is outside the eastern wall of the building. The bronze razor or scraper (PL 70:2) from Locus F621 and the iron spearhead (PL 70:4) from Locus F607 belong, in fact, to the western building F607 (see below), and were included in this plate for technical reasons. A stone vat (PL 70:5) was found overturned against the northernmost monolith. Pis. 71-75: Building F607 An assemblage of 62 complete and almost complete vessels and various objects from Building F607, arranged in the sequence of bowls (Pl. 71), kraters and cooking pots (PL 72), storage jars (PL 73:1-7), jugs (Pis. 73:8; 74:1-10) and juglets (PL 74:11-18), bottles, lamps and various objects (PL 75). Sherds from Locus F605 (Pis. 71:21; 72:10; 75:2) come from a context possibly contaminated by Stratum I 5</page><page sequence="14">Pit F619. Pl. 72:9 is a cooking pot fragment from Locus F910, outside the building to its west. The distribution of finds in Building F607 is presented in p. 172 and Fig. 13. STRATUM I AND SURFACE FINDS IN AREAS E AND F: PLS. 76-78 Pottery and various objects from pits and other loci attributed to Stratum I, as well as stray surface finds. Five sherds from Locus F637 (PI. 76:4, 6, 7, 11; 77:5), a storage jar rim from Locus F606 (PI. 77:6) and a krater rim from Locus 914 (PI. 76:2) are presented, though the loci are attributed to Stratum II, as they come from the top of the destruction debris just below topsoil, which contained Stratum I material. The figurine fragment in PI. 78:9 comes from the topsoil of Stratum II Locus F603 (Square K-19). AREA H STRATA V-IVB IN AREA H: PL. 79 Timnah I: 139, Plan P/S 62 Most of this plate represents the earliest loci in Area H. PI. 79:1-5: Five sherds from Stratum V Floor H1138 (Square CC-36) and Debris H842b (Square DD- 36). Since these are the only loci of Stratum V found in Area H, it was decided to include them in the present volume. PI. 79:6-10: Five sherds from loci on both sides of Wall H992 in Square Z-37 (Debris H980, Installation H995 and Floors HI 173, H1226). PI. 79:7, 9 are from Locus H1226, representing a lower floor level reached in a probe underneath Stratum IV Floor 993. The jug (PI. 79:10) was found inside Stratum IV Installation H995. PI. 79:11-15: Five sherds from Locus HI 111 (Square CC-36), the makeup of Stratum IV Floor H991 and yellowish brick debris underneath it. PI. 79:16: A stone bowl from Locus H991. STRATUM IV IN AREA H: PLS. 80-86 Timnah /: 139-142, Plan P/S 62 The pottery presented in the following plates comes from small probes excavated underneath Stratum III elements, which for the most part were not dismantled. Thus the material is fragmentary and often derives from insecure contexts. 6 Pis. 80-81:1-20: Sherds from pebble floor H877 (Square EE-37), uncovered in a limited probe underneath Stratum III Floor H865; several sherds from the makeup of this floor may have been included in H877. PI. 81:21-27: Sherds and two stone objects from Floor HI 139 (Square DD-38), which represents a lower floor level underneath Stratum IV Floor 946. Pis. 82-83:1-12: Sherds and an iron blade from Loci H875 and H864 (Square EE-38), debris excavated below both sides of Stratum III Wall H868; the top of this debris may include material belonging to Stratum III, no clear element of which was found here due to erosion. Four sherds - cooking pot rim PI. 82:25, basket handle PI. 83:9, chalice fragment PI. 83:10 and krater rim PI. 82:14 - come from Locus H944, the makeup just under- neath Floor H924. PI. 83:13-24: Sherds from Locus H824 (Square DD- 36), brick debris on a patchy floor (Locus H963). Some of the sherds may be part of the makeup of the Stratum III floor covering this debris (Locus H822), such as the bowl sherds in PI. 83:13-14. PI. 84: Sherds and a bead from Stratum IV debris (Loci H835, H836 and H838) in Square DD-37. As Locus H836 was covered by Stratum III Floor H816, several sherds in this locus may be intrusive from the makeup of that floor, such as bowl sherd PI. 84:1 and krater sherd PI. 84:12. PI. 85:1-19: Sherds from Loci H950 and HI 132 (Square CC-38), representing accumulation (H950) on a floor (HI 132) related to brick walls HI 135 and HI 136. This floor appears to represent an early phase of Stratum IV, as Stratum IVA Wall H956 and its related Floor H954 were constructed above Wall HI 135. PI. 85:20-25: Six sherds from Locus H1218 (Square AA-37), debris to the west of Wall H1219. PI. 86: Various Stratum IV loci; the sample of pottery presented here represents the fragmentary material typically found in less secure loci, i.e. debris, disturbed floors, and fills. Nos. 1-3: Three sherds from brick debris H842a (Square DD-36). Nos. 4- 5: Two sherds from Debris H 1050 (Squares BB- 36-37), a limited probe beneath Floor H1046. No. 6: Krater sherd from H943 (Square BB-37), a small probe below west face of Wall H914. Nos. 7-8: Two bowl sherds from a very disturbed patch of floor (Locus H1023, Square BB-36). Nos. 9- 13: Five sherds from patchy pebble floor H931</page><page sequence="15">(Square DD-38). Nos. 14-16: Three unstratified sherds from mixed loci (H827, Square DD-37; Hl 159, Square AA-35; H1070, Square Z-36), typologically attributed to Stratum IV. STRATUM IIIA-B IN AREA H: PLS. 87-93 Timnah L 142-150, Plans P/S 63, 64 The attribution of the loci to one of the two phases discerned within Stratum III was not always clear, as the walls were preserved only to the foundation level and the floors were fragmentary at best. Pis. 87-88: A large collection of sherds and several vessels from a white plaster and pebble floor in Squares DD-EE-37 (Loci H807, H816, H865). This floor appears to have been first laid in Stratum HIB, and continued in use in Stratum IIIA. The items from H807 (Pis. 87:2, 11, 15; 88:10, 12) represent the earlier (Stratum HIB) phase of this floor, as this portion of the floor was covered by Wall H867, a thickening of Wall H873 to the west in Stratum IIIA. PL 89: This plate represents pottery collected from patchy pebble floors in Squares DD-EE-36-37, inside the large public building: Nos. 1-8: Eight sherds from Locus H941 (Square CC-36), a patch of pebble floor, disturbed in the center by Stratum I Pit H907. This floor is attributed to Stratum HIB, as it was revealed underneath Stratum IIIA Floor H921 (see below, Nos. 9-11). Nos. 9-11: Three sherds from a very poorly preserved pebble floor, H921 (Square CC-36), a Stratum IIIA floor level above Stratum HIB Floor H941 (see above, Nos. 1-8). Nos. 12-16: Five sherds from a fragmentary pebble floor H834 (Square DD-36), attributed to both phases of Stratum III, covering Stratum IV debris (Locus H839). PL 90:1-10, 14-18: Sherds from Locus H817a (Square DD-37), a gray ash accumulation on and around patchy pebble floor H819. Pl. 90:11-13: Sherds found in a layer of red brick debris (H817b), underneath pebble floor H819; these sherds may perhaps belong to Stratum IV.

In order to address the long-standing problem of superficial pottery publication, at Tel Batash we attempted to collect and analyze the pot- tery in a way that would enable quantification and analysis of the variability of the pottery assemblage over time. In addition, a comparative study enabled illustration of the spatial distribution of the various types. The purposes of the pottery study were: 1 . The temporal aspect: definition of the changes and continuity in pottery types and modes of surface treatment over time, based on quantitative analysis. 2. The diachronic aspect: definition of regional aspects, examining whether certain types can be pinpointed as belonging to well-defined geopolitical contexts, such as Judah, the city-state of Ekron or the coastal plain. Types originating from distant regions such as Transjordan, northern Israel or Phoenicia were viewed as indications for trade relations. 3. Intrasite spatial-functional analysis based on the distribution of pottery classes and types. This was done only in relation to Stratum II, where whole architectural units containing large restorable pottery assemblages were revealed. A. METHOD OF RESEARCH The field registration method and system were explained in Timnah /: 14-18. Below, the method employed in the pottery processing is presented. SORTING AND MARKING The pottery was washed in the excavation camp and sorted on the following day by the excavation team. Our policy was to keep all rims, a selection of other diagnostic sherds, and all the pottery from loci that * The footnotes to this chapter appear on pp. 183-185. 10 appeared to be suitable for restoration. During sort- ing, an initial dating was proposed and recorded on the daily basket list forms. The next step was marking all the sherds to be kept. All sherds from a particular basket were marked with the basket num- ber and the individual number of the sherd in the basket. Thus, sherd D 1003 5/ 19 is the nineteenth sherd marked from basket D 1003 5 (the 35th basket excavated in Area D during the 10th season). Indi- vidual finds other than pottery, or complete pottery vessels, were given a separate basket number. When baskets were sent for restoration, only a selection of the rims and bases were marked. PROCESSING OF THE POTTERY The processing of the pottery in the laboratory fol- lowed the method utilized in the excavations of Tell Qasile (described in Qasile II: 21-24), with some modifications, which involved several stages. As much of the pottery as possible underwent metic- ulous restoration, and over the course of twelve seasons, 435 complete or almost complete vessels were restored. The restored loci, as well as all the sherds kept from the initial sorting in the field, were re-examined in the laboratory at the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University. This exclu- ded the pottery from Building 950 of Stratum II, which was restored in Fort Worth and studied there. At that time, notes were taken and a selection was made for drawing. All the restored vessels and a large selection of diagnostic sherds from stratified loci were drawn at a scale of 2:5. These drawings generally appear at 1:5 in the present publication, though drawings of large jars appear at 1:10. Special decorated sherds and objects were drawn at 1:1 and appear in the published plates at 1:2. Some very small objects, such as beads, were drawn at 2:1 and appear at 1:1. The various scales are marked in the plates and typological figures. The pottery selected for drawing is a representative sample, depicting entire assemblages alongside examples of all the types from every stratum. Repetition in the graphic</page><page sequence="19">presentation was often found necessary in order to emphasize small variations. All the drawn vessels, sherds and special objects were described on cards, as well as in the computer. The study of the pottery concentrated on three aspects: form, fabric and surface treatment (slip, burnish and decoration). Each of these aspects was studied on the basis of detailed computerized regis- tration of all the diagnostic vessels and sherds from well-stratified loci. This typological registration also included sherds from poorly stratified loci such as constructional fills, in order to provide a comparative data base. The methods utilized in each of these aspects enabled us to examine common phenomena on a quantitative basis. Form The first phase in the research of the pottery forms was the creation of a type series based on morpho- logical considerations, which included the pottery from all the periods represented in the excavation. The type series is based on two levels of classi- fication: class and type. In several cases a third level ( subtype ) was found necessary. The division into class is a broad functional determination (bowls, cooking pots, jugs, etc.), while the categorization into types is purely morphological and based on the profile of the vessels, without considering the fabric, surface treatment, technology, chronology or any other criteria (Rice 1987: 215-219, 274-277). The classes were registered on our computerized forms by a two-letter code. These abbreviations are also used throughout the pottery discussion. BL Bowl CH Chalice KR Krater AM Amphora CP Cooking pot S J Storage jar JG Jug JT Juglet BT Bottle LP Lamp Each of these classes was divided into types, which were numbered arbitrarily between 1 and 99; since the numbers have no intrinsic significance, there are gaps in the sequence of the numbers. The term "type" as used in this study warrants clarification. The pottery types were determined on the basis of several criteria. When possible, complete vessels served as prototypes; however, in many cases the finds were fragmentary, and only the rim typology could serve as the basis for the typological and quantitive analysis. Indeed, the fundamental param- eter for type definition was the ability to attribute a rim sherd to a certain type, so as to enable quanti- tative analysis. An attempt was made to achieve maximum mutual exclusivity, i.e. categories as broad as possi- ble, to facilitate classification by type. However, this proved extremely problematic, since vessels often appear to have much in common, but also differ in many details that may be significant. In each of the strata we found homogeneous types, as well as groups of closely related but not identical forms. Thus some of the "types" are more homogeneous than others. In the discussion of each type we have attempted to define its degree of homogeneity. Small variations were often defined as subtypes. Franken mentions the embarras de choix experi- enced by the pottery registrar when faced with the problem of ascribing a sherd that displays charac- teristics of several subtypes to one or the other sub- type. Slight variations in rim shape are the results of the potter's work, in which a finishing method is characteristic of each individual potter {Jerusalem II : 63-64). Subtype numbers were given when there was a clear reason for defining them; examples are ves- sels with similar rim shape but different features such as certain types of handles, or identical body shape with rim variation. In such cases small sherds could be defined only by the main type number, while larger pieces or complete vessels containing the additional feature could be defined as belonging to a subtype. Thus CP 15a, for example, is cooking pot type 15, subtype a. This method was used in the publication of the pottery from Tell Qasile ( Qasile II : 21-108). It was inspired to a large degree by the work of Flinders Petrie and his followers, in particular Garrow Duncan and Olga Tufnell (e.g. CPP ' Lachish III), though this tradition was abandoned by most American and Israeli archaeologists from the late 1930's. However, some researchers have recently returned to this approach, for example in the pub- lications of 'Izbet Sartah, Gezer Field VII and Dor ('Izbet Sartah : 38-92; Gezer ///; Dor. 1-18). In her discussion of the pottery from Levels V-IV at Lachish, Zimhoni (1997: 69) recognized the diffi- culty of establishing a true typology for periods in which there was no industrialized pottery production and preferred to group similar vessel forms under the 11</page><page sequence="20">term "group," thus avoiding the narrower term "type." We too recognize the difficulties involved in creating a true typological series that can serve as the basis of a seriation study of all the pottery under discussion in this volume. However, we feel that this issue requires individual consideration in each case, since in some forms (e.g. cooking pots, certain forms of kraters and storage jars) a true typological classi- fication can be made, while in other forms (e.g. jugs) there is a great deal of variability. We believe that the establishment of a type series of some sort enables more meaningful study of the diachronic and syn- chronic aspects of pottery development, so that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages of this sys- tem. Though the typology itself is subjective and has no intrinsic value, it is a vital tool for organizing and making sense of the vast body of pottery from the excavation. This in turn enables quantitative analy- sis, as well as comparative studies. Our purpose in the pottery plate descriptions was to generalize and to encode features as far as possi- ble, presenting them in a convenient way to the reader. Fabric The composition and qualities of the fabric enabled division of the Iron Age II pottery from Tel Batash into several major groups that we defined as "Fabric Groups" (FG). Their detailed description on pp. 16- 21 utilizes verbal descriptions, Munsell Color Charts for color definition and the results of pétrographie examination. FG numbers appear in the descriptions of the pottery plates instead of verbal descriptions of the fabric, which are often too detailed and tedious; reference to the FG number provides the necessary information on the ware and its color, texture, inclusions and firing. Surface Treatment Surface treatments such as slip, burnish and painted decoration were treated separately and were analyzed on two levels. Initially, the red slip and burnish were registered on the computerized forms by codes, which form the basis of the quantitative analysis. In addition to this, more specific shades of red slip were re-evaluated and presented in code form in the pot- tery plate descriptions (see Chapter II:F). Though type and location of burnish was registered by code on the computerized forms, it was decided to provide 12 additional verbal descriptions of this in the pottery plate descriptions. COMPUTER REGISTRATION The next phase of the pottery processing enabled quantitative analysis of the pottery according to stratum, locus, type, fabric group and surface treat- ment. All the drawn pottery, as well as thousands of undrawn pottery sherds from stratified loci, were registered on specially designed forms and later entered into the computer and processed with the help of database computer programs (for an earlier version of the method see Qasile II: 21-24). The entire database included 15,002 items from Strata IV-II in all the excavated areas (see below, p. 24). It was processed by N. Applbaum with the help of database programs (initially DBaseIII+ and Paradox 3 and later Microsoft Access, as well as QuatroPro). The locus, building, stratum and area were regis- tered at the top of each database form. The database form itself included the following columns, with the details of codes in each: Col. 1-7. Registration number Col. 11-12. Class (see above for the list of class codes) Col. 13-15. Type and subtype (if assigned) Col. 17-18. Fragment (which part of the vessel): 1 whole (intact or restored) 2 complete profile 3 rim 4 rim and handle 5 rim and body 6 body 7 handle 8 base 9 (not in use) 10 ring base 1 1 disc base 12 omphalos base 13 handle and body 14 base and body 15 spout 16 trumpet base 17 (not in use) 1 8 neck 19 base with hole Col. 20. Rim circumference. This column includes a definition of the relative size of a rim fragment in units of one eighth of the complete circumference. Where the entire circumference was preserved, the</page><page sequence="21">number 8 was registered. A small sherd (less than one eighth of the diameter) was registered as 1 . Thus, all the sherds were measured on a circumference key sheet and given numbers between 1 and 8. Cols. 22-24.

Decoration. Painted decoration was analyzed according to a tripartite system: location, color and motifs. Each category, which represents the part of the vessel with the decoration, occupied two columns: the left column included the color code and the right column included the motif code. The fol- lowing are the definitions: Location (column in registration form): 32-33 handle 35-36 rim, inside 38-39 inside of open vessel, middle part 41-42 inside of open vessel, bottom 44^45 body, outside 47-48 shoulder 50-51 neck 53-54 rim, outside The codes are: Color (left column): 1 unknown if decorated 2 not a painted design (impressed, knife- pared, combed, etc.) 3 red 4 black 5 red and black 6 red and brown 7 light brown 8 black and white 9 brown 10 red and white 1 1 polychrome Decoration motif (right column): 1 horizontal bands 2 concentric circles 3 single spiral 4 frieze of triglyphs 5 short small lines 6 antithetic spirals 7 antithetic spirals with horizontal bands 8 composite geometric design 9 decoration in Philistine style 10 cross motif 11 composite design (zoomorphic, botan- ical, geometric) 12 handle design 13 (not in use) 14 vertical lines 15 ladder design Col. Total. The option "total" was added at an advanced stage of the work. It enabled the registra- tion of contents of loci without recording the indi- vidual registration numbers of sherds. If a certain locus included a number of sherds of identical type and surface treatment, the total number of these sherds was written under the "total" column and the individual registration numbers were ignored. All the other data columns were filled. The "rim" column 13</page><page sequence="22">included the total circumference represented by this group of sherds. For example: thirty sherds may include altogether 65/8 circumferences (possibly representing somewhat more than 8 complete cir- cumferences). In this example, the number 30 is registered under "total" and the number 65 under "rim diameters." This option allowed the grouping of identical type sherds from one locus in one line. This registration system enabled quantitative analysis of the entire pottery sample, including both the pottery that is included in the plates and thou- sands of sherds that were not. In this manner we attempted to overcome one of the major problems of archaeological publication: the fact that the pottery plates reflect only the arbitrary and subjective selection of pottery for publication (Mazar 1998a: 369-370). Our method is based on registration of all the restored vessels and all the rim fragments from stratified contexts. It enables multidimensional analysis of classes, types, and surface treatment in various loci, buildings and strata. The picture obtained is a better reflection of the assemblages as it emphasizes quantitative data, which afford a basis for comparison to other assemblages in future research. COMPARATIVE DISCUSSION The comparative discussion of the pottery types from Strata IV-II proceeds according to the order of the types within each class (see Chapter II:D). In each type, a list of its appearances in the plates is given according to strata. This enables a concise glance at the distribution of the examples published in the plates in each stratum. Note that the order of the types in each chapter is not numerical but rather follows broad morphological grouping (e.g. rounded open bowls, carinated bowls, etc.). The order of the type numbers is presented in table form at the beginning of the discussion of each class. The typological figure that appears near the beginning of the discussion of each class presents a concentrated graphic view of most of the types in that class, arranged in the order of discussion in the text. The discussion of each class starts with the per- tinent statistical data (in table and graph form) on its appearance in the various strata, based on the total registration of all the pottery (including the sherds that do not appear in the pottery plates). A definition of the type is given, followed by a comparative discussion that includes mainly parallels to sites in 14 the Shephelah, the Judean hills, the Negev and the coastal plain, though other sites were examined as well. The list of parallels is not comprehensive and is intended to supply the basic data for establishing the spatial distribution and the chronological range of each type at other sites. The purpose of the dis- cussion is to establish assemblages that can be defined both chronologically and regionally, and to explore the cultural connections of Timnah in the three Iron Age II levels identified at the site. The following sites were examined: Judah and the Shephelah : Jerusalem; Ramat Rahel; the farm at Pisgat Ze'ev near Jerusalem; Gezer; Beth Shemesh; Lachish; Tell Beit Mirsim; Tel 'Eton; Tel Halif; Lahav tomb; Khirbet Rabud; H. Shilhah; En-Gedi. The Negev : Beer-sheba; Arad; Qitmit; Tel 'Ira; Tell Esdar; Tel Masos; Aroer; Tell el-Kheleifeh; Kuntillet 'Ajrud. The northern and western Negev : Tell el-Far' ah (South); En Sharuhen; Tell Jemmeh; Tel Sera'; Tel Haror; small farm sites (haserim) in the northern Negev; Ruqeish. Philistia : Tel Miqne-Ekron; Ashdod; Mesad Hashavyahu. The northern coastal plain : Tell Qasile; Tel Aphek; Tel Michal; Tel Dor; Tel Mevorakh; 'Atlit; Achziv; Tell Abu Hawam; Tell Keisan; Tyre. The central hill country and foothills : Tell en- Nasbeh; Gibeon; Shiloh; 'Izbet Sartah; Tell el- Far'ah (North); Khirbet Maijameh; Samaria; Taa- nach. The North : Megiddo; Tel Qiri; Beth Shean; H. Rosh Zayit; Tel Kinneret; Hazor. Transjordan : Tell es-Sa'idiyeh; Tell el-Mazar; Tell el-'Umeiri; Ammonite tombs; Tawilan. CAPACITY AND FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS One aspect of pottery analysis that is often neglected is the capacity and function of vessels. Whenever possible, we have provide a measurement of the capacity of vessels in liters. This may provide some idea of their use, especially in the case of storage jars, where the capacity might be able to answer the question whether jars were intended to contain cer- tain fixed amounts of liquids or other commodities. In the case of serving vessels (jugs, bowls and kraters) the capacity may indicate dining and serving habits and may have implications for social structure; see for example the conclusions of Halpern (1996).</page><page sequence="23">B. THE FABRIC GROUPS Including pétrographie comments by Yuval Goren In an attempt to define the range of ceramic fabrics characteristic of the pottery assemblages at Tel Batash, a number of fabric groups were determined. This was done with two aims in mind: to create a higher degree of consistency in the definitions of the fabrics, and to present them on a more objective basis than the standard method of a verbal descrip- tion of the nature, color and size of the ceramic fabric and its inclusions. Thus, in the fabric descriptions opposite the pottery plates we usually note only the fabric group (FG) and avoid repeating identical wordy descriptions. This method affords a broad view of the various fabrics used at Tel Batash and enables quantitative evaluation of relationships between the main classes of pottery vessels and their fabrics. We found that superficial color definitions, and even more meticulous color definitions that uti- lize the Munsell Color Charts, are very misleading; since the color of the surface often varies from one part of the vessel to another due to the location of the vessel in the kiln, post-depositional conditions, the influence of fire (during either use or destruction), etc. Nonetheless, in the description of the fabric groups we have provided Munsell Color Chart numbers that reflect the color range of the particular fabric group to provide a general color reference. As only the sherds and vessels appearing in the plates to be published were classified in this way, any conclusions pertaining to correlations between fabric and vessel types and strata are limited. However, since the sample published is large and extremely representative, and since the number of fabric groups that were distinguished is not large, it was possible to note several relationships along these lines. These will be discussed below. PROCEDURE All of the pottery in the sample was clipped to expose a fresh section and then subjected to a visual examination, with the only aid being a regular magnifying glass. The definition of the ceramic fabric was based on the sum total of the character- istics of each fabric type, seeking as wide a mutual base as possible. These characteristics included mainly elements of temper such as sand (type and quantity), straw and traces of other organic material, grog, shells and other identifiable minerals. When the type of inclusion was not known, a verbal description was given, to be identified after the pétrographie study. Color of fabric was generally not taken into account as a determining factor (see above), though the groups tend to have a certain consistency of color range. Core, too, was not used as a criterion for division, as fluctuations may result from firing con- ditions, as well as from the type and nature of the clay. Indeed, core presence, absence or color proved to be inconsistent in the various fabric groups. It could be argued that such a visual examination is inexact. However, this may be answered in our study by two factors: 1. A representative sample of the range dis- tinguished for many of the fabric groups was sub- jected to pétrographie analysis. This served to confirm or modify the visual classification. We agree with Janine Bourriau's statement on a similar project carried out on Canaanite pottery found at Memphis: "It is the archaeologist, after all, who sees all the material for these analyses, and he must be able to feed the information from the analysis back to the whole corpus. Ultimately, the field classification of fabrics will always be a visual one, since criteria based on penological examination or the presence of particular trace elements can only be consistently applied if the whole sherd population is thin-sec- tioned. This is an impossibility in practice, but one which might also fragment the classification so much as to make it unusable. We can perhaps hope to find visual properties which correspond to significant criteria identified by scientific examination" (Bour- riau 1990: 20*). 2. The manual examination resulted in the divi- sion of the Iron Age II pottery assemblage from Tel Batash into 34 fabric groups and sub-groups. Thin- section pétrographie analysis of samples of these groups was carried out by Dr. Yuval Goren under the polarizing microscope. This enabled us to check the visual definitions against a pétrographie definition. The pétrographie study aimed to organize the fabric groups according to their clay and temper types. Additional attention was paid to such features as the provenance of detrital minerals, alteration of miner- als due to firing, etc. The results were incorporated in the following description of the fabric groups. They have shown that the pétrographie study tends to reduce the number of fabric groups that were estab- lished by a "naked eye" definition based on colors and visible inclusions. 15</page><page sequence="24">In the plates, the pottery is listed as belonging to a certain fabric group (FG), while the detailed analyses and pétrographie description of each group are given below. Distributions of fabric by class and strata are summarized in Tables lb-4 (pp. 22-23). THE FABRIC GROUPS FG la Much quartz sand, with many tiny white inclusions; few mudballs; light red (2.5YR 6/6) with thin gray (10YR 5/1) core. Thin section: Matrix: almost iso- tropic, silty (5%); heavy minerals (zircon, oxy- hornblende). Temper: A: idiomorphic dolomite crystals (25%) exposed to some decarbonization during firing; B: shales, probably a result of bad mixture of the clay; C: opaque minerals; D: silt-rich, red clay aggregate, perhaps terra rossa. Firing temp.: about 750-800°C. This fabric belongs to a well-defined pétrographie group that has been published in detail. Based on the extensive body of reference material, this pétro- graphie group is identified as originating from clay of the upper member of the Moza formation, mixed with dolomitic sand quarried from the 'Amminadav formation. The non-plastic component was probably sieved to isolate the desired grain size, since in nature the 'Amminadav formation dolomitic sand appears to be much less well sorted than in the pottery. This pétrographie group is well known from pottery assemblages from sites of different periods spread throughout the Judean-Samarian anticline. In the Chalcolithic period it apparently typifies the southern Judean sites (Goren 1995), but is very rare in other regions. It has been recorded from Early Bronze Age I sites in central Israel extending from the Beer-sheba valley to Aphek (Porat 1984: 47-48; Maeir et al. 1992). In the EB IV (Albright's MB I) this group dominates sites in the vicinity of Jer- usalem (Goren 1996a). In the Middle and Late Bronze Ages it once again became one of the com- mon raw materials of the Judean ceramic assemb- lages (Glass et al. 1993). This group is also known from the Iron Age I assemblages of Tell en-Nasbeh and Khirbet Raddana, as well as from the "collared- rim" pithoi from Giloh (all as yet unpublished) and the pottery assemblage of Shiloh (Glass et al. 1993: 78). This group was found to be common in the Iron Age II assemblage from the City of David {Jer- usalem II : 79-85) and the contemporary sites of 16 Ramot 06 and Moza (as yet unpublished). In later periods Moza clay (sometimes with dolomitic sand) is known from the large Early Roman period ceramic workshops at Binyanei ha-'Uma and Giv'at ha- Mivtar in Jerusalem, and the medieval workshop at Ramot (all examined petrographically by Y. Goren and as yet unpublished). Although dolomite rocks and hence the dolomitic sand derived from them can be found in other parts of the southern Levant, their use as inclusions was apparently restricted to the Judean hills. This was confirmed by the results of an INAA study that attributed pottery of this pétrographie group to the Jerusalem area even when it was found in the Negev and Sinai (Gunneweg et al. 1985: 273). Many of the vessels from Kuntillet 'Ajrud, Beer-sheba and Giloh mentioned in this article were examined petro- graphically and proved to belong to this pétrographie group. FG lb Much quartz sand, very few tiny white inclusions, sporadic small white rounded particles; slightly metallic; reddish (2.5YR 5/8 and 10R 5/8) with thick grayish-brown (10YR 5/2) core. Four thin sections were made of four varieties of this fabric. Thin sec- tion: Matrix: isotropic, silty (+10%). The silty com- ponent is rich in oxyhornblende (=firing temp. &gt;800°C). Opaque minerals (probably iron oxides) are also common. Temper: badly sorted, angular to subrounded quartzitic sand. Also occurring are remains of some badly decomposed carbonates. Fir- ing temp.: 800-900°C. Totally different from FG la. In this group, sand from the coastal plain of Israel is mixed with highly ferruginous, fine clay. The quartz sand is usually accompanied by sand-sized grains of accessory minerals including hornblende, epidote, zircon, feldspars and augite (Nahmias 1969). The nature of this group, together with its geo- graphical distribution in Levantine sites, may point to a coastal origin. It is most likely that the hamra red soil of the central littoral areas of Israel was used here, perhaps after some purification by dilution of the sand component. Hamra is spread along the coastal plain of Israel from the Ashdod area north- wards. A word of caution, however, is required. Approximately 2 km west of Tel Miqne-Ekron, hamra has been exposed in the modern Revadim quarry below a series of layers of grumusol including</page><page sequence="25">Acheulian artifacts and ecofacts. The latter have been recently excavated by an expedition from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and the Israel Antiquities Authority (Marder et al. 1999). Although at present this bed of hamra is buried underneath thick layers of alluvium, ancient exposures could have occurred. Therefore, at least some if not all of the vessels belonging to that group may have been made locally at Tel Miqne-Ekron. Pottery produced from hamra is distributed in Israel at sites located mainly along the central coastal plain. It is known from some Chalcolithic assemb- lages of the central coastal plain (Goren 1991b) and from Early Bronze Age assemblages at Palmahim (Braun 1995). A Middle Bronze Age kiln site con- taining only vessels of this pétrographie group was excavated near Yavneh Yam (Singer- Avitz and Levy 1992). FG Id Somewhat porous; few small round mudballs; color ranges from reddish-yellow (5YR 6/8) with thick gray-brown (10YR 5/2) core to pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) with thick brown (7.5YR 5/2) core. Thin sec- tion: generally similar to FG lb, but the matrix is richer in decarbonated carbonates. Some fragments of chert plus possible shell appear in the sandy component. Rounded blobs about 200jn in size are also found, consisting of cream-colored, dirty mate- rial that is isotropic. This material seems to be retracted from a clayey matrix, probably calcareous marl, which was decarbonized, leaving its siliceous part as a vitrified blob. Firing temp.: 800-900°C. FG 2 Some quartz sand, very little tiny calcite sand; porous, not metallic; reddish-yellow-brown (7.5YR 6/6-7. 5YR 4/6), no core. Thin section: generally similar to FG lb. Firing temp.: at least 750°C. FG 2b Reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6) with thick gray (7.5YR 6/0) core. Thin section: Matrix: highly carbonatic; some rounded aggregates of matrix material are present. Temper: as FG 2. Firing temp.: about 750- 800°C, since the carbonates are partly decarbonized and the hornblende is partly oxidized. FG 3 Quartz sand, few small calcite inclusions; some small gray inclusions, evenly distributed; porous red (2.5YR-5/6-5/8), no core. No pétrographie analysis carried out. FG 4a Pinkish (5YR 7/4) with very thick gray (5YR 4/1) core. Thin section: Matrix: as FG la. Temper: as FG la, but with the addition of some fragments of snails, chalky marl and nari. FG 5a Much tiny calcite sand, little quartz and mica sand; many evenly dispersed medium-sized oval and round white particles; somewhat porous; some organic material; light red (2.5YR 6/6) with grayish brown (10YR 5/2) core. No pétrographie analysis carried out. FG 5b Reddish-brown (2.5YR 5/8-7. 5YR 6/6), metallic, with thick grey-brown (10YR 4/3) or light brown (5YR 7/1) core. Thin section: Matrix: very silty, but generally similar to FG Id. Temper: mainly partly decarbonized carbonatic sand, probably remains of forameniferal chalk. Firing temp.: about 750-800°C. FG 5c Many small and medium round and elongated black and gray inclusions; not metallic; pinkish-gray (5YR 7/2); section: gray (5YR 5/1) at edge to thick pink (5YR 7/3) at core. Thin section: Matrix: highly car- bonatic, silty. Heavy minerals: zircon and horn- blende. Temper: carbonatic sand of micritic limestone. Also appearing: sparitic limestone, silty shales, quartzite, quartz, chalk and nari. Firing temp: about 600°C or less. Based on a large body of published data, the matrix is readily identified as the loess soil that occurs in Israel, mainly in the northern Negev and the southern Shephelah (Porat 1987: 112-115; 1989a: 50-52; Goren 1987; 1988; 1991b: 101-104; 1996a; Goren and Gilead 1987; Gilead and Goren 1989: 7; Goldberg et al. 1986). The inclusions that accom- pany this matrix are variable, and indicate different 17</page><page sequence="26">depositional environments within the loess soil dis- tribution provenance in the southern Levant. The studies of ceramics assigned to this group demonstrate that the composition of the inclusions used varies with the geographic location of each site, and that it can be correlated with sands occurring naturally in the vicinity of each site (Gilead and Goren 1989: Fig. 2; Goren 1991a: 118-120, Fig. 13; 1995: Figs. 3-8). The use of loess with inclusions in which limestone is the dominant component is prevalent mainly at sites northeast of the Beer-sheba Valley and in the southern Shephelah, whereas at northwestern Negev sites quartz is the major con- stituent (Gilead and Goren 1989: Fig. 2). In the inner southern Shephelah, chalk sand is commonly the sole inclusion. A study of the composition and provenance of the Amarna letters (Goren et al. in press) has revealed that the inclusions in the fabric of these tablets, which are made of loess soil, are well correlated with the geological setting of each city mentioned in the texts. In general, three groups of inclusions that accompany the loess matrix can be identified with three geographic areas including specific sites. The first, coastal group (Gaza-Ashkelon) is characterized by purely coastal sediments, including quartz with abundant heavy minerals. The second group, the western Negev (Yurza), is defined by a mixture of coastal sand and limestone and chert fragments, most likely derived from Nahal Gerar. The third group, the southwestern Shephelah (Lachish), has predom- inantly limestone and chalk inclusions. These groups do not include the inner northern Negev, an area that did not contain any urban center during the Late Bronze Age II. The northern Negev, however, is fully represented by much earlier ceramic production traditions. The geological defi- nition of this region is based on data that came from the study of Chalcolithic ceramic assemblages in southern Israel (Gilead and Goren 1989; Goren 1995; Goren and Gilead 1987). Another recent study of Byzantine ceramic workshop wasters collected from numerous pro- duction sites between Gaza, Ashdod and Beer-sheba has proved that the variants within this group differ geographically and can be isolated and defined pet- rographically (Fabian and Goren in press). Despite the long chronological gap between the Iron Age and the Byzantine period, the results of this study seem to be applicable also to earlier periods. This is due to the fact that the selection of potential ceramic raw 18 materials in the northern Negev is very limited. Consequently, in most cases, as pétrographie analysis has demonstrated, loess and local sands were used throughout the duration of pottery production in this area. Therefore, the use of technological data related to ceramic production in this area at any period is relevant to the question of the origins of the loess ceramics. The inclusions of the pottery assigned to the loess group in the Batash assemblage, mostly chalk, indi- cate a southern Shephelah provenance, most likely from the area of Tell el-Hesi or Lachish. FG 6 Much quartz sand, very little calcite sand; few medium beige round particles; few mudballs; very pale brown (10YR 7/3-10YR 8/3), no core; very similar to FG Id and FG lb, though with slightly more mudballs. FG 7 Very much calcite sand, evenly distributed; some small round mica(?) particles; few large red (ochre?) inclusions; very porous; reddish (5YR 7/8) with light brown (7.5YR 7/2) core. Thin section: Matrix: clayey, birefringent, with abundant heavy minerals including oxyhornblende, epidote, zircon, plagio- clase. Temper: rounded carbonatic sand, quartz and some shale fragments. FG 8 Quartz and mica sand, sporadic tiny calcite sand; porous; reddish-yellow (7.5YR 7/6) with thin faint pinkish-gray (7.5YR 7/2) core. Thin section: Matrix: almost isotropic, relatively poor in silt. Heavy min- erals are hornblende (common) and mica (rare). Temper: sorted quartzitic sand, round to subangular. Firing temp.: 800-900°C. This fabric could be a finer variant of the above types, though the presence of mica may indicate a different group. FG 9 LMLK storage jar clay; many small and medium calcite inclusions, evenly dispersed; metallic; some organic material; reddish brown (10R 6/8-1 OR 5/8) with thick gray (5YR 5/1) core. Thin section: Matrix: very rich in well-sorted silt, isotropic and fired in a</page><page sequence="27">reducing atmosphere. Heavy minerals are horn- blende, rutile, zircon, tourmaline and epidote. Tem- per: mostly carbonatic sand including micritic and sparitic limestone, partly decomposed due to firing. Firing temp.: above 750°C. This pétrographie group is identified as terra rossa soil, mixed with sieved wadi sand. Terra rossa is widely exposed over the mountainous regions within the Mediterranean climatic zones of the southern Levant, including the Judean and Samarían hills, Mt. Carmel and the Galilee. Therefore, the provenance of vessels belonging to this pétrographie group cannot be determined on the basis of their clay alone. The inclusions in most samples contain quartz, chalk, nari and chert. This indicates that the sands were collected in wadis that drain areas where either Senonian or Eocene formations are exposed, since these are the two major ages when chalk and chert were deposited in the southern Levant. The quartz sand was probably swept inland by aeolian deposi- tion. The combination of terra rossa and Senonian or Eocene chalk and chert formations strongly suggests that the inner Shephelah should be preferred as the possible origin of this group. In this area, terra rossa soil appears alongside Eocene chalk rich in chert horizons. Wadis that cross this area drain the Seno- nian chalk and chert formations that are exposed on the slopes of the Judean ridge to the east. Thus, the combination of the matrix and the inclusions sug- gests an inner Shephelah origin for the vessels belonging to this group. The use of terra rossa soil as clay for ceramic vessels is known starting with Early Bronze assemblages (Goren 1996b). In most cases, pottery belonging to this group can be attributed on typo- logical grounds to Judah or the inner Shephelah. Terra rossa soil, mixed with wadi sand, crushed calcite crystals or grog, was frequently used by Iron Age potters in Judah as a ceramic raw material, especially for the production of cooking pots. In Jerusalem, the City of David excavations produced numerous ceramic figurines, most of which were made locally from terra rossa soil (Goren et al. 1996). In the case of the LMLK stamped jar handles, 180 examples were examined using INAA (Mommsen et al. 1984). The results suggest that the jars bearing these handles were produced at a single site, perhaps in the Shephelah. In a recent pétro- graphie study of these vessels, carried out by Goren and Bunimovitz (oral communication), it has been shown that the fabric was made of terra rossa soil with chalk, quartz and chert temper. Therefore, this group can be linked to the region of the inner Shephelah. In the pottery assemblages of Beth Shemesh and Batash, the terra rossa group is dominant (Goren 1996b). Since the area around Batash is devoid of terra rossa soils, it may be concluded that a pro- duction center near Beth Shemesh was the source of pottery made from this fabric found at Tel Batash. FG 10 Quartz and mica sand, few small calcite particles; porous; sporadic mudballs; little organic material; grayish-green (5Y 5/4), no core. Thin section: gen- erally similar to FG Id but fired at lower temper- atures (about 700°C). FG 11 Quartz and mica, and some very tiny calcite sand; few sporadic small round white particles; porous, light weight; light pinkish-beige/white (5Y 8/2) with very light gray (5 Y 7/1) core. Thin section: very similar to FG 6. FG 12 Some tiny calcite sand, evenly dispersed; many small quartz and round white particles; organic material; sporadic mudballs; pink (7.5YR 8) with pinkish-gray (7.5YR 7/2) core. Thin section: quite similar to FG 5b, but the matrix is poorer in silt and richer in carbonates (mainly chalk). The matrix has a very high optical orientation, indicating a very low firing temperature. This may also be the reason for the softness of this fabric. FG 13 Mortarium fabric; few tiny and small calcite par- ticles; very few tiny mica inclusions; porous; pink- ish-white-very pale brown (10YR 8/3-7. 5YR 8/4), no core. Thin section: Matrix: poorly sorted with fine silt size fragments of oxyhornblende (KMOļii). Micas and feldspars also appear. Many carbonatic ooliths are part of both matrix and temper. Temper: lime- stone, subangular quartz as fine sand, arcóse con- sisting of a schist grain and volcanic minerals such as hypersthene. Firing temp.: above 800°C. 19</page><page sequence="28">According to both clay and temper, this fabric is not local to Israel. Its source must be in an envi- ronment characterized by metamorphic or volcanic rocks; the vicinity of the eastern Aegean is rather appropriate to this description. FG 14 Light grayish brown (10YR 6/2), no core. Thin section: Matrix: similar to FG 2b. Temper: similar to FG 5. Firing temp.: 700-800°C. FG 15 Cooking pot fabric; very few tiny calcite particles; dark reddish-brown (7.5YR 4/4), no core; slightly porous; metallic. Thin section: matrix similar to FG lb. Excellent sorting of quartzitic silt. No temper added. FG 16 Cooking pot fabric; many tiny and some small and medium white inclusions; few small round mica particles; organic material (?); brown (5YR 4/6) with thick light brown (7.5YR 6/4) core. Thin section: Matrix: as FG 15, but very porous. Temper: as FG Id. Firing temp.: about 800°C. FG 17 Cooking pot fabric; little quartz sand, much calcite sand, evenly distributed, and many larger white rounded particles; somewhat porous; some organic material; reddish (2.5YR 4/8 ) with thin gray (2.5YR 4/0) core. Thin section: Matrix: clayey with well- sorted quartzitic silt (about 10%). Temper: idiomor- phic calcite crystals. Firing temp.: not exceeding 700°C. This group is typical of cooking pots from the Early Bronze I up to the end of the Iron Age. In this case, calcite was used as temper because it has ther- mal expansion close to that of the fired clay matrix and its crystal lattice does not change within the range of temperatures used for cooking, as opposed to other common tempering materials such as quartz. FG 18 Cooking pot fabric; many quartz and mica sand particles, evenly distributed; some tiny calcite sand; 20 few small round white particles; porous; reddish- brown (2.5YR 6/4) with thick gray (10R 4/1) core, metallic.

II DISCUSSION The attempt to define quantitative relationships between the fabric groups at Tel Batash is limited, since only part of the sample was subjected to pét- rographie analysis. Just as the pétrographie analysis showed that a large number of groups distinguished by the naked eye were in fact very similar despite their appearing different, it is possible that some of the groups that were not petrographically analyzed are also very similar to other groups. Consequently, the following conclusions concerning continuity and/ or exclusivity of fabrics over time are tentative. However, despite these limitations, perusal of Table lb shows generally that there is one cluster of fabric groups spanning Strata IV and III and another spanning Strata III and II. No fabric was in use over all three strata. This is reflected in the typological analysis (see summary on pp. 154-163), which demonstrates a continuity of vessel types from 21</page><page sequence="30">Table lb.

Few of the fabric groups are found exclusively in Strata IV or III, but nine fabric groups are found only in Stratum II. This reflects the nature of the pottery industry in Stratum II, which appears to have had diverse and innovative elements alongside its con- tinuity from Stratum III. At Lachish, Zimhoni noted a change in fabric color between the pottery of Levels V and IV and the pottery of the end of Level III (Zimhoni 1997: 169-170). It seems that at Tel Batash as well, there is more difference between the fabric groups of Strata IV and III than between Strata III and II, where 17 groups continue (see Table lb). Tables 2-4 present the distribution of the fabric groups by vessel class (excluding chalices, amphorae, bottles and lamps) in each stratum. Keeping in mind the fact that a number of the groups are petrographically similar and thus should be considered together, the results of this analysis show only limited trends in the use of certain wares for certain types over time. In Stratum IV, most of the fabric groups were used equally for both bowls and kraters. FG 30 and 32 were used mainly for bowls and kraters (FG 33 was found only in bowls, kraters and one juglet, but is a very small group). FG 36 and 37 were used only for cooking pots. While FG 31 and 34 were used more Table 2.

Consequently, in Stratum IV, there was no unique storage jar fabric like the LMLK clay of Stratum III. In general, it may be tentatively suggested that the repertoire of fabrics and specialization of fabric type by class is more limited than in subsequent strata. The fabrics in this stratum were used for the entire assemblage in rela- tively similar proportions among the various vessel Table 4.

This might indicate a more restricted pottery industry with fewer workshops and perhaps less access to clay sources or less advanced technological capacity. However, this conclusion is tentative due to the limitations of the study. Six fabric groups continue from Stratum IV to 23</page><page sequence="32">Stratum III (FG 30, 32 and 34 in substantial amounts and 31, 35 and 36 in very small amounts; FG 5b and 9 are almost negligible in Stratum IV). However, it seems that these were used mostly for bowls in Stratum III, whereas in Stratum IV they were used for other classes as well. FG 36 and 37 continue to be used exclusively for cooking pots, though one of the typical Stratum II cooking pot fabrics (FG 15) begins in small numbers in Stratum III. Storage jar fabrics are more distinct in Stratum III, with the typical LMLK fabric (FG 9) and FG Id, together with the almost identical FG 4a and 5 a, which were used more for storage jars than for any other class apart from bowls. However, FG Id, 4a and 5a are equally dominant in the bowls. In general, the distribution of the fabric groups among the classes in Stratum III shows a somewhat greater specialization (especially with bowls and storage jars). Stratum II demonstrates a more diverse repertoire of fabrics, which are distributed relatively evenly among the classes. Aside from the distinct mortarium fabric (FG 13), virtually no fabric is exclusively used for any one class. The "chalky" orange clay of FG 19 is found only in storage jars and, as in the previous strata, there are unique fabrics for cooking pots (FG 15-18); however, it can be noted that in Stratum II there are more groups for cooking pots than in the previous strata. This suits the greater typological diversity of cooking pots in Stratum II as opposed to Strata IV and III. It is interesting to note that in Stratum IV, the fabric groups deriving from loess soils (the southern Shephelah, coastal plain south of Ashdod and northern Negev) constitute the majority of the fabric groups (five out of nine, including virtually all the dominant groups). Of the remaining four fabric groups, three are of coastal origin (though one is scarcely represented), and the fourth group comes from Judah or the inner Shephelah. On the other hand, the fabric groups of Strata III- II come mainly from the coastal plain and/or the Tel Miqne region. Only two of the 17 fabric groups spanning Strata III- II are from the southern Shephelah, coastal plain south of Ashdod or northern Negev; two more are from Judah or the inner Shephelah. C. THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS The quantitative registration method explained above (pp. 10-14) resulted in a large database that included 15,002 pottery items from Strata IV-II registered in 24 the computer files. During processing, this large body of data was refined: it was decided that the items used in our quantitative analysis would include only fragment registration categories 1-5, which are indicative vessel parts (see above, p. 12). These items totaled 7027 items (see Table 5), which comprise the 1408 vessels and sherds that appear in the plates and an additional 5619 sherds and vessels that were typologically registered but not drawn. Area C and Stratum I are excluded (apart from the material included in the plates), since they were not registered by this method. Table 5.

An additional 91 items from Area C (28 from Stratum IV, 4 from Stratum III and 59 from Stratum II) which appear in the plates are not included in the quantitative tables. As described above, each of the classes was divided into types and subtypes. Tables and graphs summarizing the distribution of each type in each of the strata appear at the beginning of the discussion of each class and type. These tables and graphs are based on the total database of fragment categories 1- 5 (see p. 12), including items that appear in the pottery plates and items that were registered typo- logically but are not illustrated. Since the numbers in the tables and graphs reflect registration of all whole and complete vessels and indicative rim sherds retrieved from stratified loci, the tables and graphs should be considered reliable. The only problem that exists concerns the typological classification itself, which in certain cases was ambiguous (this will be explained below in the relevant discussions). For reasons of lack of space, it was decided not to print out a complete catalogue of all the typologically registered sherds in each locus. Copies of the com- puter file of the entire typological registration by locus are deposited at the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Israel Antiquities Authority.</page><page sequence="33">Table 6.

TYPOLOGICAL AND COMPARATIVE DISCUSSION All the vessels assigned to a particular type that appear in the plates are listed by stratum after the definition of the type. Where vessels are ques- tionably assigned to the type, a question mark fol- lows the plate reference. BOWLS The differentiation between kraters and bowls . The criteria that determine this differentiation usually depend on subjective definitions related to the nature of the specific corpus, so that a vessel defined as a bowl in one assemblage will be called a krater in another, and vice versa. We applied the following rules. Open vessels whose rim diameter is larger than their height were generally defined as bowls {small: rim diameter up to 15 cm; medium-sized : rim diam- eter up to 25 cm; large : rim diameter more than 25 cm). Vessels with closed proportions (i.e., whose rim diameter is smaller than their height) were usually deemed kraters, with a size in the medium to large range as defined for the bowls. Table 7.

Iron Age II typology: bowls. 31</page><page sequence="40">Fig. 1 (cont.). Iron Age II typology: bowls. Bowls Related to the Philistine Tradition: BL 8a, BL 42, BL 45 BL 8a. Bell-shaped bowls with vestigial horizontal handles (Photo 1) Stratum IVA: Pl. 6:2 Stratum IV: Pis. 7:5; 10:1; 12:11; 101:1 Photo 1. BL 8a (PL 6:2). Scale 1:2. 32 Small to medium-sized bell-shaped bowls, diam- eter ca. 11.5-17 cm, with a slightly everted stance above a soft, round carination just under mid-body; the top of the rim is tapered. They have a small ring base. These bowls usually have vestigial or care- lessly applied horizontal handles and, in a few cases, horizontal red lines painted on the exterior or red slip and burnish. The fabric is generally grainy and not smoothed. These are clearly a late development of the bell- shaped bowls ( Timnah III : BL 8) that were typical of the Philistine repertoire, including that of Tel Batash Stratum V (Dothan's Type 1; Dothan 1982: 95-106); for example, see PI. 2:10-11 (found in the lowest level of Stratum IV, though these may be stray sherds from Stratum V). While the developed shape invar- iably has a well-formed horizontal handle, these bowls have only small, vestigial smears recalling these handles. BL 8a appears towards the end of the 11th and the early 10th centuries, most with red slip and irregular burnish or simple red lines; see Beth Shemesh III : Fig. 5:4-352 (Stratum III); Beth She- mesh IV: Pl. LXIL2-4 (Stratum III); Lachish III : 240, PI. 81:110 (from Tomb 4005, 10th century); Masos</page><page sequence="41">II : PL 136:10 (Stratum II); Gophna 1966: Figs. 4:3; 4:9; 5:6, 8; Tell el-Far'ah (S): Pl. XLI, Tomb 221 (note also the vestigial horizontal handle on a bowl similar in shape to our BL 24, see below); Ashdod /: Fig. 33:3 (Area C, end of Iron Age I), with flat bar handle; Ashdod IV : Fig. 1:15-16 (Stratum Xb); Qasile II : Figs. 34:11; 43:15; 44:5 (Stratum X). This type is found mainly at sites that had con- tained Philistine ware in Iron Age I (apart from Lachish) along the Philistine coast, in the Judean Shephelah and in the northern Negev. Unlike the fully developed Philistine bell-shaped bowls, these bowls lack the typical Philistine Bichrome deco- ration; they are either undecorated or have simple red painted horizontal lines or red slip outside. At Tel Batash, only three of the 18 sherds registered as belonging to this type (17%) had red slip and hori- zontal hand or irregular burnish inside and outside. In contrast, most of the bowls of this type at the other sites mentioned above had burnished red slip. The dearth of such treatment on the examples from Tel Batash should be noted; in contrast, red slip and burnish are common on other vessel types found in Stratum IV. BL 42. Deep rounded bowls with rounded rim (Photo 2) Stratum V: PI. 79:2 Stratum V-IVB: Pis. 1:4; 100:3 Stratum IVB: Pis. 2:6-8; 5:13, 15(?) Photo 2. BL 42 (PL 2:8). Scale 1:3. Medium-sized deep bowls (diameter ca. 15-17.5 cm) with rounded sides forming a slightly hemi- spherical stance. The round-topped rim is folded inwards and outwards, or only outwards. Some of the examples have vestigial horizontal handles; the shape of the base is unknown, as no complete pro- files were preserved. Some of these bowls are dec- orated on the exterior with horizontal red lines, and they are occasionally white-slipped as well (e.g. PL 1:4). Two examples had light red slip. The ware is generally grainy and not smoothed, similar to that of BL 8a above. This type is found in the Iron Age I stratum at Tel Batash (Stratum V) and is also found in loci of Stratum IVB, but it is not found in the main Stratum IV. Though it was not defined by Dothan as part of the Philistine corpus, the horizontal handles, white slip and red decoration recall Philistine ware. A similar bowl, defined as a krater, was found at Ashdod Stratum Xb, which is perhaps contemporary with our Stratum IVB ( Ashdod IV: Fig. 2:12). It is decorated with white slip and red horizontal painted bands. Bowls with a similar stance, though with a different rim, were found at 'Izbet Sartah Strata II and I {'Izbet Sartah : Fig. 14:18, with red slip and black lines [see our PL 5:15]; Fig. 20:14, red line on rim top and fully developed horizontal handle). BL 45. Small deep bowls with low curve Stratum IV: Pis. 79:7; 82:12-13; 93:2(?) BL 45 This type includes only a few sherds of small, narrow, deep bowls (diameter ca. 11.5-15 cm) with straight sides above a low, rounded carination, of which very little was preserved; no complete profiles were recovered. The upper exterior below the roun- ded or tapering rim top is usually multi-ridged. All the sherds securely attributed to this type were red- slipped and burnished inside and outside, and were usually painted with black and white, or only black, horizontal bands outside. This small group is not homogeneous, and the few examples differ from one another in their details. The ridges under the rim exterior are frequent on other bowls of this period, such as our BL 26 and 33</page><page sequence="42">bowls at many sites of the 10th-9th centuries. The general affinity to the shape of the late "Philistine" bell-shaped bowl (our BL 8a), and even to our BL 42 (see above), should be noted, though BL 45 has more vertical walls, as well as the aforementioned ridges. There are few exact parallels to this type. The general shape (though lacking the ridges) may be found at Ashdod {Ashdod //-///: Fig. 39:21-23, Stratum VIII; Ashdod IV: Fig. 10:6, Stratum IX). Compare also Qasile II : Fig. 29:18-19, Stratum XI. A somewhat similarly shaped bowl with external ridges and black painted lines was found at one of the " haserim " excavated in the Negev, dated to the end of 11th- beginning of 10th centuries (Gophna 1966: Fig. 3:6). Rounded Bowls with Simple Rim: BL 25, BL 37, BL 38 BL 25. Small, shallow, rounded bowls with incurv- ing rim (Photo 3) Stratum V-IV: Pis. 1:1-2; 79:11 Stratum IVB: Pis. 2:1-4; 5:11; 81:21-22; 85:1 Stratum IV: Pis. 7:2; 12:1-2; 80:1-3; 82:1-2; 100:1- 2; 101:4 Stratum III: PI. 22:4 Stratum IIIA: PI. 91:1 Photo 3. BL 25 (PL 81:22). Scale 1:3. Small to medium-sized bowls (diameter ca. 13-17 cm; isolated examples are larger, e.g. PI. 2:1, 20 cm) with incurving upper sides and a round or tapering rim top. The sole preserved base is a small ring base (PI. 81:22). These bowls are generally quite shallow, though several examples are deeper and more hem- ispherical (e.g. Pis. 80:1-2; 82:11). In Stratum IV, 81% of them are red-slipped and irregularly hand- burnished inside and outside. 34 In Stratum III this type virtually disappears. 66% (12 out of 19) are covered with red slip and burnish, mostly located inside and partially outside, as opposed to the bowls of Stratum IV, which are entirely slipped and burnished. No wheel burnish was recorded on these bowls in Stratum III, sug- gesting that the few bowls registered with this type in Stratum III are either earlier stray sherds or come from contexts that are early in the Stratum III sequence. Small hemispherical bowls are quite common in Iron Age I contexts, though they are generally somewhat deeper than our BL 25 (e.g. Qasile II: 33- 38, Fig. 26:2, Stratum XI); a shallower version is found alongside the deeper ones as early as Stratum XI at Gezer ( Gezer III: PI. 6:3-7); see also 'Izbet Sartah: 54-56, Figs. 10:15; 11:3, Stratum III, Type 5. This shape continues into the 10th century and slightly later at numerous sites in the Shephelah, Negev and the coastal plain, mostly with red slip and irregular hand burnish inside and outside: Beth Shemesh III: Figs. 5:4-334; 6:3-55, 3-56 (Stratum Ha), shallow; Lachish, TufnelPs Class B.4 and Zimhoni's Levels V-IV, Type B-2, including in this group both shallow and deeper hemispherical bowls (Zimhoni 1997: Fig. 3.5:1, 8 are shallow); Gezer III: PI. 7:10, 14 (Strata X-IX); PI. 10:3 (Stratum VIII), shallow; Beer-sheba I: PI. 78:21 (from Bir es-Seba', possibly an 8th century context); 'Izbet Sartah: Fig. 19:21 (Stratum I), Type 8, the most popular bowl in Stratum I (see discussion, ibid.: 60-61); Tel Miqne, Dothan 1989a: Fig. 1.9 (Stratum IV), shallow; Ash- dod IV: Figs. 1:5, 7-8; 7:4 (Stratum X); Qasile II: Fig. 52:1 (Stratum IX); Mevorakh: Fig. 12:4, 6 (Stratum VII), shallow. PI. 71:10 from Stratum II, the only bowl recalling BL 25 found in the stratum, has red slip and ring burnish inside and halfway out. This somewhat resembles a deep hemispherical bowl type found at Kuntillet 'Ajrud, which was paralleled to vessels from 8th-7th levels and was considered common along the Syro-Phoenician coast {'Ajrud: 150, Fig. 3:17). Thus, it appears that while deeper hemispherical bowls were well known at 10th-9th century sites in the Shephelah, the Negev and the coastal plain, the specific shallow, incurving profile of our BL 25 was limited to our region and appears at Beth Shemesh, Lachish, Gezer and Tel Miqne, in levels con- temporary with our Stratum IV.</page><page sequence="43">BL 37. Rounded shallow bowls with grooved rim exterior (Photo 4) Stratum III: Pis. 13:2-3, 6, 8-10; 23:6(7), 7(7); 24:2; 26:17-19; 27:1, 10; 29:7-9, 11; 87:6-7, 15 Stratum IIIA: Pis. 89:12; 90:1; 91:4; 93:11 Stratum HIB: PI. 89:1 Strata III-II: Pis. 13:9; 58:1 Stratum Sub-II: PI. 27:10 Stratum II: Pis. 31:2-*; 41:1-4, 6, 8-12; 54:7, 9; 57:1(7); 63:7; 64:1, 9(7); 71:1-6, 7(7), 8(7); 94:1; 96:1; 102:2 Stratum IIA: Pl. 63:1 Photo 4. BL 37 (Pl. 41:6). Scale 1:3. This bowl type begins to appear in Stratum III. It is generally small to medium-sized (diameter ca. 12.5-17 cm, though note Pis. 13:10 and 71:8, which are larger), with rounded sides and a vertical or very slightly incurving rim top. The main identifying characteristic of this bowl is the thin groove under the rim exterior. Most of these bowls are relatively shallow and wide, with the proportions of PI. 13:2, though some are deeper (PL 91:4), somewhat recalling the deeper hemispherical bowls mentioned with BL 25 above. The preserved bases are pre- dominantly small ring bases, though there are a few small disc bases. In Stratum III, 11% of these bowls are red-slipped. On more than half of these, the slip is both inside and outside, while on ca. 25% the slip is inside and partially outside. Only ca. 10% of the red- slipped bowls were also burnished, with both hori- zontal hand and wheel burnish. Four were self-slip- ped. This bowl type is somewhat less frequent in Stratum II. The examples from this stratum are slightly smaller and deeper than those of Stratum III. Slip and burnish are lacking in 96% of the examples. There are few exact parallels to this type. In Strata IX-VII at Ashdod there were many round-sided bowls with a thin groove under the rim exterior. Most were red-slipped and burnished (hand and wheel) inside and outside or inside and partially outside (e.g. Ashdod II-III: Fig. 37:11-13, 39:15-16; Ashdod IV: Figs. 10:11; 13:5-7; 26:6, Stratum VII). However, these are somewhat deeper than most of the exam- ples at Tel Batash. Other comparisons are a bowl with red slip and burnish inside and halfway outside from Ruqeish {Ruqeish Graves: Fig. 5:R25), and a bowl from Jerusalem {Jerusalem, Ophel: PI. 25:28). Bowl Type 45 at Gezer ( Gezer III: PI. 20:1-2), apparently similar to our BL 37, was a common form there from the mid-9th to the mid-8th centuries. The closest parallels to the Stratum II bowls come from the large contemporary assemblage of nearby Tel Miqne Stratum IB (Gitin 1989a: Fig. 2.13:7), where this bowl is defined as a "coastal type." It is also represented at Mesad Hashavyahu {Mesad Hashavyahu: Fig. 4:7). However, it is not found among other published late Iron Age II assemblages from coastal sites, apart from the above-mentioned examples from Ashdod, which differ in details of shape. It may perhaps be suggested that in Philistia the single-grooved bowl developed from the popular multi-ridged/grooved exteriors found on some bowls of the 10th-9th centuries (see Lachish III: 270, and discussion of our BL 26 below). The shape may be related to the hemispherical bowl that had been so popular in Iron Age I and the beginning of Iron Age II (see discussion of BL 25 above). Subsequently, the plain, unslipped, more mass-produced version of BL 37 became a popular bowl type in the 7thAcentury, specifically in the region of Tel Miqne and Tel Batash, reaching Mesad Hashavyahu as well. BL 38. Large rounded bowls with incurving rim Stratum II: Pis. 58:8-9; 60:6 Three rounded bowls (Pis. 58:8 and 60:6 are large, 28 cm in diameter) with incurving rims. PI. 58:8 has a horizontal red line on its rim top and a vestigial knob handle on its rim. Similar knob handles appear on bowls from Caves I and II in the City of David, Jerusalem, dated by Eshel to the first half of the 7th century {Jerusalem IV: Figs. 4:8-9; 12:10-15; though note that Franken and Steiner date this assemblage 35</page><page sequence="44">BL 38 earlier, to no later than 700 BCE; compare also a bowl with two such handles (H Shilhah : Fig. 5b: 17, 7th century). Rounded Bowls with Molded Rims: BL 26, BL 26a, BL 32 BL 26. Medium-sized to large rounded bowls with molded rim (Photo 5) Stratum IV: Pis. 7:13; 8:13; 9:4; 82:11; 84:6; 100:4-5 Stratum IVA: PL 6:1(7), 4(7), 6 Strata IV-III: PL 10:10 Stratum III: Pis. 28:3; 101:11(7) Stratum IIIA: Pis. 91:18; 93:15 Photo 5. BL 26 (PL 82:11). Scale 1:3. Medium-sized to large bowls (diameter ca. 18- 27.5 cm), with rounded sides and a flat-topped rim, usually horizontal but also at different angles (e.g. Pis. 7:13 and 84:5), sometimes with a "pinched" exterior. In many examples there are ridges under the 36 rim exterior. A relatively wide variety of sizes and rim shapes were included in this type, whose simple open stance was probably convenient for food preparation and serving. The base is either a disc or ring base. A few have knob handles (Pl. 7:13). Two examples (PL 8:13, with a bar handle; Pl. 6:4 with a very vestigial bar handle) are smaller with thinner walls, though the general stance is that of the main type. In Stratum IV 70% of these bowls (along with subtype 26a) are red-slipped inside and outside. Ca. 32% of the red-slipped bowls had irregular or hori- zontal hand burnish inside and outside. The two examples from Stratum III presented in the plates (Pis. 91:18 and 93:15) are larger than their Stratum IV counterparts (diameter 31.5 cm), though smaller examples do exist in Stratum III. It appears that this is not a viable Stratum III type. The heterogeneous nature of this group makes for comparison to a broad range of parallels, all of which were red-slipped and burnished inside and outside, or inside and partially outside. At Lachish, similar bowls are represented by TufnelPs Class B.2, which includes various types: Lachish III : Pl. 99:592-598 (10th century), Pl. 81:103; see also Zimhoni's Type B-5 in Levels V-IV (Zimhoni 1997: Figs. 3.8-3.9). Bowls similar to our Pis. 6:4 and 8:13 were found in Locus 4421 at Lachish, dated to the late 9th to mid- 8th centuries (ibid.: Fig. 3.60, Group F); Beth She- mesh IV: Pl. LXIIL15, 18-19 (Stratum II); Beer- sheba /: PL 53:2, 5 (Stratum V); PL 55:6-7 (Stratum IV); Arad' Fig. 9:3 (Stratum XI, see our Pis. 6:4 and 8:13); Masos II: Pl. 142:1 (see our Pl. 8:13); P1.144:3, 5 (Stratum I); Tel Sera': Fig. 10:5 (Stratum D6); 'Ajrud: Fig. 3:10; Ashdod //-///: Fig. 37:15 (Stratum VIII); Ashdod IV: Fig. 13:8; (Stratum VIII); Qasile II: Fig. 52:2 (Stratum IX); Samaria III: Fig. 1:3 (Period I); Megiddo II: Pl. 89:9 (Stratum VA). The chronological range of these bowls at Tel Batash is supported by the parallels, which fall mainly in the 10th century and become markedly less frequent towards the 8th century, with Ashdod VIII being one of the latest appearances. The phenom- enon of longevity of types at Ashdod is noted in other types as well (see p. 1 17). A similar decrease in the numbers of these bowls was noted at Lachish between Levels V and IV (Zimhoni 1997: 78). The distribution of this bowl type, with similar surface treatment, embraces sites in the Shephelah, the northern Negev and the southern coastal plain in the 10th and 9th centuries. Bowls of a similar concept are also found at Samaria, Megiddo and Kuntillet</page><page sequence="45">'Ajrud in 9th-8th century contexts. Note that pétro- graphie analysis of the parallel from Kuntillet 'Ajrud to BL 26 (see above) indicates an origin in the Shephelah {'Ajrud: 148). The multi-ridged exterior found on most of these bowls is quite common on bowls of the 10th-9th centuries.1 At Tel Batash, ridges below the rim exterior appear on a number of Stratum IV bowl types other than BL 26 and BL 26a, such as BL 28, BL 32 and BL 45. On the other hand, some of the bowl types that are found at Tel Batash without ridges appear at other sites with ridges (e.g. our BL 25; see Ashdod IV: Fig. 7:4). Tufnell suggested that the decline in the number of grooves may serve as a chronological indicator ( Lachish IIImĒ 270; though note the presence of single-grooved bowls in Lachish Levels V-IV, e.g. Zimhoni 1997: Fig. 3.10:2, 5-7). At Tel Batash the multi-grooved bowls are indeed most common in Stratum IV, decline in Stratum III and do not continue into Stratum II. During the course of Stratum III, they are perhaps replaced by the single-grooved bowls, such as BL 12 and BL 37, which became a regional characteristic of Philistia. At Lachish the Level V examples of both the small and large bowls of this type are red-slipped and hand-burnished mostly inside and outside, while the later, 9th-8th century examples are slipped and bur- nished inside and halfway outside. Knob or bar handles are rather common on these bowls. Tufnell suggested that the location of the bar handles on this bowl type (e.g. from Tomb 218: Lachish III: 205-206 and Zimhoni 1997: 78, Table 6 and Fig. 3.9) may serve as a chronological indicator: the closer to the rim, the earlier the form (though note Rast's refuta- tion of this: Taanach I: 32). In Tufhell's view, such handles were common between 1000 and 825 BCE, becoming less frequent later on {Lachish III: 265, PI. 99:592; see our PI. 93:15). Indeed, bar handles are found at Tel Batash mainly in Stratum IV, and such appendages are very infrequent in Stratum III.2 BL 26a. Smaller, more delicate version of BL 26 Stratum IV: Pis. 11:11; 82:3^; 83:13; 84:1 Stratum III: Pis. 24:13; 29:10; 87:13(?) Small, round-sided bowls (diameter ca. 12.5-15 cm), with several rim variations (mostly round or flat-topped, and a few slightly everted). The walls are relatively thin and more delicate than the main type, and most are multi-ridged below the rim exterior. The shape of the base is unknown, as no complete profiles were preserved. In fact, these bowls are BL 26a similar to BL 26 and only their smaller size and straighter rim distinguish them as a subtype. Note that this size distinction was not made by Tufnell in her Class B.2 or by Zimhoni in her Type B-5, which correspond to our BL 26 (see above). Comparisons may be made to the following, most of which are red-slipped and hand-burnished inside and outside or inside and partially outside (only examples of different surface treatment will be specified below): Lachish III: Pis. 79:22, 24; 81:104 (9th century); 99:588, some with ring burnish and knob handles; Zimhoni 1997: Fig. 3.8:17, 20 (Level V); Jerusalem , Ophel: PI. 9:12, wheel burnish (lower floor Locus 86/68, possibly 9th century); Gezer III: PI. 10:6, 14 (Stratum VIII); Beth Shemesh: PEFA : PI. XXIL3 (Tomb I), Beer-sheba II: Fig. 17:12, 14 (Stratum IX); Fig. 21:5 (Stratum VIII); Fig. 26:5 (Stratum VI); Beer-sheba I: Fig. 53:9 (Stratum V); Fig. 55:5 (Stratum IV); Arad: Fig. 5:4 (Stratum XII); Ruqeish Graves: Fig. 2:R12a; the Negev haserim (Gophna 1966: Fig. 4:6); Ashdod IV: Fig. 7:5-7, vertical black hatches on rim (Stratum X), Ashdod I: Fig. 37:9 (Stratum VIII); Qasile II: Fig. 46:3 (Stra- tum X); Tel Michal: Fig. 71:3 (Stratum XIV); Mevorakh: Fig. 12:24 (Stratum VII). As in the main type, these parallels indicate that this bowl occurred in the Shephelah, Negev and along the coast (though note the bowl from Jer- usalem); it was apparently produced mainly in the 10th and 9th centuries.3 BL 32. Open, thin-walled bowls with truncated inner rim Stratum IV: Pis. 7:3-4; 84:5 Stratum III: Pis. 13:29; 14:9, 12; 57:2, 18; 87:14 Stratum II: PI. 64:11(?) Medium-sized to large bowls (diameter ca. 19.5- 31 cm) with relatively thin rounded walls. The angled inner rim is either flat or slightly rounded, and there is a slight depression below the outer rim. Most examples have a Jew densely concentrated ridges on 37</page><page sequence="46">BL 32 the exterior below the rim. The form of the base is unknown, since no complete profiles were preserved. There is practically no change between Strata IV and III in stance, size, ridges and surface treatment. The only sherd in the plates attributed to this type in Stratum II (PL 64:11) comes from an insecure stratigraphie context disturbed by pits, and indeed this should not be regarded as a Stratum II type. In Stratum IV, 64% of the examples (9 out of 14) are red-slipped and irregularly burnished. In Stratum III, 15% are red-slipped and burnished inside and outside, 2% had such treatment inside and partially outside, and the amount of wheel burnish increases to 33% of the burnished examples. Two bowls (Pis. 7:4 and 84:6) have black vertical hatches painted on the inner rim, and three sherds have self slip in Stratum III. While this bowl shares several traits with BL 26, such as its rounded sides, truncated rim and exterior ridges, its relative shallowness and thin walls, as well as the sharp angle of its inner rim, set it apart. Like BL 26, it was not very frequent at Tel Batash. However, as the parallels show, it was a well-estab- lished bowl type in 10th and 9th century assemblages at sites in the Shephelah and the Negev (Beth She- mesh IV: Pl. LXIII:17, Stratum II; M. Aharoni 1981: Fig. 1:8, Arad Stratum XII; Tel Sera': Fig. 10:4, Stratum D6), with a later appearance on the coast (Ashdod //-///: Fig. 37:15, Stratum VIII; Ashdod IV: Fig. 19:9, Stratum VII). Bowls with Thickened or Folded Rim: BL 28, BL 13 BL 28. Rounded bowls with round thickened rim (Photo 6) Stratum IV: Pis. 6:7; 7:9-12, 14; 80:11; 85:21 Stratum IVB: Pis. 1:5, 9; 2:5, 15-18 Stratum IVA: Pis. 9:2-3; 86:4(7), 9 (?); 90:11(?)-12; 93:5(7); 100:6(7); 101:5 Stratum HIB: Pl. 90:12 Stratum III: PL 13:21 38 Photo 6. BL 28 (Pl. 1:9). Scale 1:3. Medium-sized to large open bowls (diameter ca. 24-32.5 cm; Pl. 86:4 is somewhat smaller, and is questionably included in this type), with rounded sides and a thickened rim forming either a small bulbous top or a small, round hammer head. Several examples have ridges under the rim exterior (e.g. Pis. 1:9 and 100:6). The form of the base is unknown, since no complete profiles were preserved. PL 2:5 (with a bar handle) was included with this type since it has a similar stance, though its inner rim is thick- ened. Pl. 80:11 has a knob handle. In Stratum IV, 83% are red-slipped; of these, 86% are irregularly and horizontally hand-burnished inside and outside, and 4% are so treated inside and partially outside. Very few examples of this type were registered in Stratum III. The examples pre- sented in the plates are from relatively insecure contexts, and this type is essentially negligible in Stratum III. Of the three types of large, rounded thick-walled bowls of Stratum IV at Tel Batash, BL 1 1, BL 26 and BL 28, the latter is the most common. It is the third most common bowl in Stratum IV, following BL 24 and BL 25 respectively. At Lachish, several bowls depicted with Zimhoni's Type B-9 appear to be comparable to our BL 28 (e.g. Zimhoni 1997: Fig 3.13:5, Level V and Fig. 3.14:1, 7, Level IV). Parallels are found in 10th- 9th century levels at sites mainly in the Negev; these are usually red-slipped and irregularly hand- burnished inside and outside. See Beer-sheba II: Fig. 21:6-8 (Stratum VIII); Fig. 26:7, 9 (Stratum VI); Fig. 26:10 (very similar to our Pl. 6:7); M. Aharoni 1981 :</page><page sequence="47">182, Fig. 1:1, 8 (Stratum XII, with bar and knob handles, similar to our PL 2:5; Fig. 1:15, similar to our Pis. 2:17 and 13:21); Masos II : Pl. 138:18 (Strata I/post I). BL 28 may perhaps be considered a forerunner of the folded-rim bowls (our BL 13) that become so popular, especially in the 8th century, at Judean and southern sites. The thickened rounded rim of BL 28 is hammer-headed in most cases, while BL 13 has a folded outer rim, but in some cases a similarity does exist (see, for example, Pis. 2:18 and 80:11). The ridges under the rim exterior such as those on Pis. 1:9 and 5:10, though relatively rare on bowls of this type at Tel Batash, may be found on similar contemporary bowls at other sites ( Beer-sheba II: Fig. 26:7). As noted above (see BL 26), multi-ridged exteriors are common on bowls in early Iron Age II contexts. BL 13. Rounded bowls with folded rim (Photo 7) Stratum IV: Pis. 10:7-8; 24:10-12; 80:4-5, 7-8, 10, 12 Stratum III: Pis. 13:17-18, 20, 24-27; 14:1; 22:15; 24:10-12, 14-15; 87:18(7); 91:8-9; 103:13 Stratum IIIA: Pl. 91:10 Stratum HIB: Pl. 93:4(?)

Rounded bowls with folded rims appear in all three strata. Although there are nuances between the rim shapes in each of these strata, they are presented as one type that shows the development throughout this long period. The few bowls attributed to Stratum IV have folded-over flattened rims, some with grooves below the rim exterior. The body is rounded. Though they differ somewhat from the subsequent ubiquitous folded-rim bowls in Strata III and II, they were included in BL 13 as they have more of an affinity to the folded-rim bowl than to its earlier counterpart, BL 28, which was characterized by a thickened rounded rim, sometimes hammer-head. This bowl is quite frequent in Stratum III, with a size ranging from small (diameter ca. 15 cm) to medium-sized (diameter ca. 22.5 cm), while a few border on large (diameter ca. 28-30 cm). The char- acteristic trait of this bowl is the folded-over rim exterior, which takes several shapes: rounded (e.g. Pis. 24:15 and 91:9), flattened (e.g. PL 13:17, 24), ridged (e.g. Pl. 13:25) or "pushed out" (e.g. Pl. 14:1). PL 87:18 is probably related more closely to the protruding hammer-head rim typical of kraters of earlier strata, but its stance and surface treatment suggest that it may be related to the folded-rim bowl type. Most of these bowls have gently rounded sides, though several have a soft carination just above mid- body, creating a wide shallow groove below the rim exterior. The upper body stance is either straight or slightly inturning at the rim. Preserved bases are generally ring or concave disc bases. This bowl type continues in similar shapes and quantities in Stratum II. Most of the Stratum II examples fall in the small to medium size range. The softly carinated body present in some of the Stratum III bowls becomes somewhat more pronounced (e.g. Pl. 58:13, 18). Possible variations of the "pushed-out" rim type are Pis. 71:16 and 94:2, which are questionably included in this type. Pl. 64:18 also represents a variation of the main type, in both its square rim profile and its relatively shallow stance. This is the second most common bowl in Strata III and II. Bowls with folded rims are the most wide- spread type found in the Iron Age II pottery reper- toire throughout the country (Amiran 1969: 206, Pl. 65:1-7). The wide variety included in this type from Strata IV to II reflects the long duration and popu- larity of such bowls during the Iron Age II, espe- cially its latter half. Tufiiell noted that, despite a 39</page><page sequence="48">strong family resemblance, much variety in detail makes it difficult to provide exact close comparisons for these bowls; regional differences in shapes and fabric must be taken into account as well ( Lachish III : 277). As such, our definition of BL 13 is quite wide and includes several variants. An alternative approach was used by Gitin, who assigned a separate type number to all variations of this type {Gezer III : 170-171). Such are his Type 51 (ibid.: 172; see our PI. 94:2); his Type 69 (ibid.: 193; see our Pis. 24:11 and 93:4); his Type 71 (ibid.: 193 and the variants seen in Gezer III : 194-196; see our PI. 60:8); and his Type 76 (ibid.: 199; see our PI. 14:1). For parallels and references see Gitin's discussion of these types. The earliest examples that may be broadly related to the folded-rim bowl type are found in 10th century levels, e.g. Beer-sheba II : Figs. 21:7; 26:8 (Strata VII-VI); Kinneret : Pl. 84: 5-7 (Stratum IV). Zimhoni noted that bowls with "turned-over rims" do not appear in Lachish Level IV.4 This rim shape, how- ever, is found in Locus 4421 at Lachish, which Zimhoni dated to the transition between Levels IV and III, i.e. late 9th to mid-8th centuries (Zimhoni 1997: 154, Fig. 3.66:3, 5, 7). Such bowls are found at Tel 'Eton Strata II-I and in the 'Eton tombs, assemblages that are dated to the mid-9th to mid-8th centuries (' Eton : 64). At Gezer, an example from Stratum VIII (9th century) {Gezer III: 201, Type 81 A, Fig. 13:6) is claimed by Gitin to be either "aberrant" or the earliest known example of the folded-rim technique that becomes common in the 8th century (ibid.: 171). It is interesting to note that this type is absent from Kuntillet 'Ajrud. Such bowls are very common in numerous 8th century levels in Judah, e.g. Lachish Level III, Beth Shemesh Stratum II, Tell Beit Mirsim Stratum A, Beer-sheba Strata III- II, Aroer Stratum III, Arad Stratum X and Jerusalem Caves I and II.5 They continue to be popular until the destruction of Judah in 586 BCE, found in large quantities at Ramat Rahel Stratum V, Lachish Level II, Gezer Stratum V, En- Gedi Stratum V, Arad Strata VII-VI, Tel 'Ira Stratum VI, Horvat Qitmit, Tel Miqne Stratum IB, Tell Qasile "Stratum VII" and Mesad Hashavyahu. Though this type is more frequent in Judah, similar bowls appear at northern and coastal sites as well, especially in the 8th century, with shapes and surface treatment sim- ilar to those that are common in 7th century Judean contexts (e.g. Dor : 4, Bowl Type 16a). Amiran proposed that these might have been imports from southern sites, though this is not certain (Amiran 40 1969: 201, PI. 64:17, 19). Note that a bowl with a grooved rim, similar to our Pis. 32:5 and 54:20, was considered at Dor to be an Assyrian type {Dor: 6, Types 38a and 39a, Fig. 1.3:15-16). Similar bowls were found in Transjordan in 8th-7th century con- texts (see a partial summary in Gezer III: 169). This bowl is not included by M. and Y. Aharoni in their summary of 8th century Judean types. How- ever, they do note that the folded-rim bowl, which they attribute solely to the 7th century and consider a standard result of mass production, begins in 8th century strata (Aharoni and Aharoni 1976: 86). At Tel Batash Stratum II, while most of these bowls are of the "standard size" with the typical ring burnish inside and on the rim (e.g. PI. 41:28), larger varia- tions and less "standard" types may be found as well (e.g. Pis. 64:13 and 41:24, etc.). In Stratum III, 35% are red-slipped and have wheel burnish. In Stratum II, 27% are covered with a light red slip and wheel burnish inside or inside and on rim exterior; 13% had self slip and wheel (ring) burnish.6 The gradual decline in the amount of red slip, as well as a shift from hand to wheel burnish up to the virtual disappearance of surface treatment at the end of the Iron Age II, was noted at numerous contemporary sites as well (Aharoni and Aharoni 1976: 76, 86; Gezer III: 172; Qitmit: 210; En-Gedi: 21; see pp. 149-150). BL 13 with handles. Several medium-sized, two- handled examples exist in Stratum II (e.g. Pis. 60:9 and 64:14). Similar medium-sized to large bowls with two to four handles (often defined as kraters) are well known in Judah in 8th and 7th century contexts, usually large with wheel burnish inside and sometimes with a rope decoration outside (Amiran 1969: PI. 65:17-20; Jerusalem, Ophel: Pis. 3:1-3; 6:1-2; En-Gedi: Fig. 16:3-4).

Medium-sized bowls (diameter ca. 20-25 cm), thick-walled with straight or slightly flaring sides above a soft carination at mid-body. The rim is an everted, angled ledge, protruding outside. Several bowls with a small thickened rim (similar to BL 28) were included in this type on grounds of their body stance (e.g. Pis. 1:6; 10:4; 85:8; 86:7). The shape of the base is unknown, as no complete profiles were preserved, though parallels suggest a heavy ring or disc base. In Stratum IV, 50% of these bowls are red- slipped and irregularly burnished inside and outside. PL 10:5 has black vertical hatches on the rim top as well. The few Stratum III examples attributed to this type have a similar rim stance, but tend to be somewhat more round-sided. PL 24:7 is a large bowl (diameter 30 cm) and PL 23:9 has a round-topped, everted rim. It should be noted that most of the 1 8 examples attributed to Stratum III come from con- structional fills or loci that were not in the destruction level (e.g. E705, E708), implying they might origi- nate in Stratum IV or early in Stratum III. Thus, this bowl should not be considered a viable Stratum III type. Large examples of this type are often classified at other sites as kraters. At Kuntillet 'Ajrud, such bowls (never slipped or burnished) were categorized together with "cut rim" bowls, similar to our BL 26 (see above) (' Ajrud: 145, 148). The following are selected parallels to the range included in our BL 1 1 : Beth Shemesh IV: PL LXVI:5 (Stratum IIb); Lachish V: PL 41:11 (Level V; similar bowls are mentioned as having been found in Level IV as well). Some of the bowls from Locus 4421, included in Zimhoni's Group L, appear similar to some of our BL 11, though with a more pronounced ledge (Zimhoni 1997: Fig. 3.65:13; late 9th to mid- 8th centuries). TBMI: PL 65:20b, 21, 24-25 (Stratum A); Gezer III: 177, PL 20:18-19 (Stratum VI, Gitin's Bowl Type 58, compare also Type 65); ' Eton : Fig. 3:9 (Stratum II); Fig. 4:2 (see our PL 24:7). Several bowls from Arad Strata XII-XI recall this type; see M. Aharoni 1981: Fig. 1:11 (see our PL 10:3); Fig. 1:19; ' Ajrud : Fig. 3:9; Samaria III: Fig. 7:1 (Period IV); Taanach I: Fig. 93:2-3 (Period IIB); Abu Hawam: 21, Fig. 75 (Stratum III); Sa'idiyeh: Fig. 3:2 (Stratum VII), similar to our PL 24:8, though slightly shallower; Fig. 10:15, 17-18, 21 (Stratum V). The chronological range, both at Tel Batash and of the suggested parallels, points to a beginning for this utilitarian bowl shape in the 10th century, continuing through the 9th century until its latest appearance, which seems to have been no later than the mid-8th century.

This type becomes slightly more prevalent in Stratum III. Unlike the bowls of Stratum IV, most of the bowls in this stratum have a slightly more pro- nounced carination and a more everted upper stance, forming more of an S-shaped profile. The rim tops are mostly tapering, with some rounded. The com- plete examples have ring bases. A variation of this type is PI. 89:13, with a very slightly pinched low carination. Some 40% of these bowls in Stratum III are red-slipped and burnished inside and outside, while an additional 18% are red-slipped inside and out down to the carination, with the burnish often continuing down to cover the unslipped lower exte- rior, as in Stratum IV. Most of the examples of this bowl in our Stratum III came from constructional fills (e.g. Loci D 1048, Dl 2 12, and especially the early Stratum III Locus E619, where many such bowls were found), and thus may be attributed to Stratum IV or early Stratum III. The few small sherds of this type found in the Stratum III destruction debris are typologically insecure (e.g. PI. 13:13). These bowls are perhaps a development from the typical Iron Age I cyma-shaped bowls, as evidenced in Tell Qasile Bowl Type 8 (Qasile II: 39-41) and 'Izbet Sartah Bowl Type 3 (' Izbet Sartah : 48-50). The parallels reflect the relative confinement of this type to the region of Judah, the Negev and Philistia, mainly in the lOth-early 8th centuries. At Lachish these bowls begin to appear in Levels V-IV, prior to 42 900 BCE, and steadily diminish (according to the tomb groups) until they entirely disappear about 700 BCE. Tufnell noted that most of these bowls have a dark red slip and hand burnish inside and outside to the carination ( Lachish III: 271-272, PI. 79:57, Tufnell's Class B.5); see also Zimhoni 1997: Fig. 3.21, Type B-16, Levels V-IV. At Beth Shemesh this type was characteristic of Stratum lib, and was usually covered with red slip and irregular burnish inside and outside to the carination ( Beth Shemesh IV: Pl. LXIII: 11-12). See also TBM III: PI. 24:12 (Stratum A); Ashdod IV: Fig. 13:3 (Stratum VIII); Fig. 26:4-5 (Stratum VII); Ruqeish Graves: Fig. 1 :R6b; M. Aharoni 1981: 183, Fig. 1:13 (Stratum XII). At Gezer, this type (Gitin's Type 72) is rare and was considered a form related to "Samarían Ware" carinated bowls. It is dated to the second half of the 8th century and possibly continued into the 7th century {Gezer III: pp. 196-197, PI. 22:8). This is later than the range of our BL 27. BL 17. Small sharply carinated bowls ("Assyrian" form) (Photo 10) Stratum III: Pis. 24:4(?); 26:20-22 Strata III-II: Pis. 14:5; 57:16 Stratum II: PI. 96:4 BL 17a.

BL 17 is a small bowl (diameter ca. 11-12.5 cm) with a sharp carination at mid-body (or very slightly below), above which a curved, flaring stance termi- nates in a tapering rim. Below the carination, the</page><page sequence="51">sides are rounded. The base is a barely visible flat- tening, or is simply round. It should be noted that the similarity to the shape of BL 27 (see above) may have resulted in errors of registration. It should also be recalled that type BL 17 is very close to BL 22 (see below) and these two types should be consid- ered together. Three intact bowls of this type were found in the destruction debris on a Stratum III floor, Locus E719 (PI. 26:20-22). In Stratum III, only one of the 15 registered examples was red-slipped and burnished, while in Stratum II, this increases to 36% (5 out of 14); the latter percentage is relatively high in view of the generally low amount of red slip in this stratum. BL 17a includes three carinated bowls that resemble BL 17, but have a blunt carination and a flat disc base. The shape of this bowl is defined as "Assyrian" on the basis of its resemblance to Assyrian "Palace Ware" of the 9th-7th centuries, which was inspired by metal prototypes (see Lines 1954: Pl. XXXVIL7- 8; Oates 1959: Pl. XXXVIL59; Amiran 1969: 291, PI. 99:1-5; Ashdod I: 134, notes 14-15 for further references). Imported examples were found at several sites (e.g. Jemmeh : PI. LXV:l-3; Samaria III : Fig. 1 1 :22), probably as a result of commercial relations between Assyria and Israel and Judah (Amiran 1969: 91), as well as the presence of Assyrian officials and garrisons in the country. However in most cases the bowls of this kind are local imitations, as are all the examples from Tel Batash. It seems that similar bowls already begin to appear in the late 8th century in contexts predating the Assyrian conquest (e.g. Qiri: 203; Marjameh : 102, Fig. 18:11; Ashdod /: 134, Fig. 37:1-4, Stratum VIII). Indeed, some of the best examples of this type at Tel Batash were found in the destruction debris of Stratum III. This was a common bowl in Ashdod Stratum VIII {Ashdod I: 134). However, most of the Assyrian-type bowls were found in strata postdating the Assyrian conquest (Amiran 1969: 291), for example Ashdod I : Fig. 40:1-3 (Stratum VII); Ash- dod //-///: Fig. 5:7 (Stratum VI). At Gezer such bowls were not common: Gezer III : 197-199, Pis. 22:7 (Type 73); 27:19-22 (Type 74); 27:20-21 (Type 75), all from Stratum V. Examples are also known from Tel Miqne (Gitin 1995: Fig. 4.5:9, Stratum IB); Nasbeh II: PI. 54:1196 (Iron Age II); Qitmit : Fig. 4.1:37-40; En-Gedi : PI. XXV:7 (Stratum V); Qasile II : Fig. 55:28 ("Stratum VII"); Keisan: PI. 37:11 (Stratum 5); Samaria III : Fig. 10:8-10 (Period VI); Fig. 11:22 (Period VII); Tell el-Far ah I: PI. 61:1-11 (Stratum VIId-e). Many locally produced bowls of this shape were found at Tawilan, bearing typical painted Edomite decoration; the date is late Iron Age II ( Tawilan : Fig. 6:8:18-22). Examples from the Tell el-Mazar cemetery (e.g. Tell el-Mazar: Fig. 3:3) demonstrate the continuation of this shape into the 6th-5th centuries. Our bowls resemble a large group of small carinated bowls with and without handles from Tell el-Kheleifeh, dated broadly from the 8th to the early 6th centuries (Tell el-Kheleifeh : 41-42, 71- 72, PI. 25-17:1-11). It is interesting to note that though other bowl shapes ascribed to Assyrian influence were found at Dor (Dor: 5-6), carinated bowls like ours were absent. Likewise, similar cari- nated bowls are lacking at Megiddo. It appears that in the 7th century at Tel Batash, the deeper, more sharply carinated BL 17 (and BL 22, see below) replaced the wider carinated bowl shape of BL 27, which was found in previous strata. The Assyrian-inspired carinated bowls (BL 17 and BL 22, see below) remained relatively scant in the Stratum II pottery repertoire, while the most popular carinated bowl was BL 12 (see below). BL 22.

Scale 1:3. 43</page><page sequence="52">Medium-sized bowls (diameter ca. 15.5-19.5 cm) with a carination just above or at mid-body; the carination is softer and higher than that of BL 17, and most of the examples are somewhat larger. The stance is flaring above the carination. The rim inte- rior is angled in and slightly truncated. The preserved bases are round. These bowls lack slip or burnish. Like BL 17 (see above), this type belongs to the category of Assyrian-influenced carinated bowls. It was designated a separate type because of differences in carination and rim, and its wider stance. The ten examples registered in Stratum III are from strati- graphically insecure contexts, and this is mainly a Stratum II type. Thus, it may be suggested that this bowl represents a late 7th century development in the local ceramic tradition of the earlier (late 8th-early 7th century) Assyrian-inspired BL 17. This bowl may be compared to a bowl fragment from Lachish Level III (Zimhoni 1990: Fig. 5.4:14). The shape of the inner rim of this type may be compared to carinated bowls from Tell el-Kheleifeh. Pratico notes that this rim shape is very common at Tell el-'Umeiri (unpublished material) ( Tell el-Khe- leifeh : 46-47, PI. 36:1-3). However, despite its cari- nated shape, this bowl was not included among similar Assyrian-related forms at Tell el-Kheleifeh (see above, BL 17), but rather considered a local shape.

Small to medium-sized bowls (diameter ca. 12- 16.5 cm; PI. 81:23 is only 9.5 cm in diameter, and is tentatively assigned to this type). The soft carination is usually at mid-body, though shallower, wider bowls have a lower carination. PI. 29:14-15 have a lower carination, just above the base, which was apparently broad and round. The stance above the carination is generally slightly flaring, though some are vertical. The rim top is usually tapering, but may also be rounded. The base, preserved in only a few examples, is a small disc or ring base. These bowls were the commonest bowl type in Stratum IV at Tel Batash. 46% of these were red- slipped and hand-burnished, 38% on the inside and outside and only 8% inside and outside down to the carination; in most of the latter, the burnish continues down on the exterior to cover the unslipped portion as well. This bowl continues into Stratum III, though its popularity greatly declines. 77% of these bowls in Stratum III are red-slipped and burnished; this is one of the few instances of an increase in such treatment from Stratum IV to Stratum III. 60% of the bowls in Stratum III have red slip and burnish inside and outside, while 17% have such treatment inside and outside to the carination. The burnish continues down on the unslipped lower exterior as well. Only five examples from Stratum II were regis- tered with this type, mainly on the basis of their proportions (e.g. the four bowls in PI. 41:7, 16, 17, 23), as opposed to the deeper proportions of BL 12, the dominant carinated bowl of Stratum II (see below). However, this attribution is based merely on morphological considerations, and in fact the appearance of this type in Stratum II can be con- sidered negligible. This shape was popular in 10th to 8th century levels at various sites throughout the country, almost always covered with red slip and hand or horizontal burnish inside and outside, or inside and outside to the carination. The bases vary from disc to ring to high ring. The following are selected comparisons:</page><page sequence="53">The Shephelah, Judah and the Negev: Lachish IIIř.

Pl. 87:21 (Stratum VB); Taanach I: Pl. 48 (Period IIB); Abu Hawam: Fig. 9 (Stratum III); this is the commonest form in this stratum, covered with a fine red and yellow slip, similar to "Samarían Ware" (ibid.: 7). The above comparisons mainly date from no later than the mid-8th century, suggesting that the main appearance of this bowl was contemporary with Stratum IV and early Stratum III. Indeed, none of these bowls was found in the destruction debris of the Stratum III Building 737. The predominance of red slip and hand burnish on these bowls also sug- gests an early date in the sequence. The question of the affinity of this shape to Phoenician forms remains open. In general, there is very little Phoenician influence in the Tel Batash ceramic corpus, espe- cially in Stratum IV, when this bowl was at its peak of popularity. Though it is possible that this bowl shape is borrowed from the Phoenician realm, it is a simple shape that can also be considered indigenous. It appears that in Stratum II, the smaller, deeper BL 12 (see below) replaces BL 24 as the common carinated bowl at Tel Batash, though a few wide, shallow carinated bowls do continue to be found in Stratum II (e.g. PL 41:7, 16-17, 23). A few bowls of similar shape to the Stratum II examples of BL 24 were found in post-8th century strata at other sites, mainly Judean, such as Jerusalem {Jerusalem, Ophel : Pl. 7:23, Locus 23041, 7th century; see our Pl. 41:10, 17; Jerusalem IV: Fig. 11:22-28, Cave I; though note the earlier 8th century date given to this cave by Franken and Steiner, Jerusalem II: 30) and Stratum V at Gezer (e.g. Gezer III: 186-189, Pl. 24:1-2, Type 64A, B). BL 23. Medium-sized carinated bowl with high ring base Stratum II: Pl. 41:22. BL 23 A single example of a medium-sized bowl (diameter 23 cm) with a carination just below mid- body and sides slightly flaring above it; the rim exterior is multi-ridged. The ring base is high. Only half of the bowl was preserved. The bowl is red- slipped and burnished inside and outside to the carination, with some careless ring burnish lines inside only. On the preserved upper exterior there are traces of burning, as well as "dribbles" of slip on the lower preserved part. This is a unique bowl at Tel Batash. The general shape recalls the high, trumpet- based "Samarían Ware" bowls from Period III at Samaria (Samaria III: Fig. 4:11-12; Amiran 1969: 212). While earlier dates (late 10th to third quarter of 9th centuries) have been proposed, Tappy prefers to date such pedestal-based bowls to the early to mid- 8th centuries (Tappy 1992: 184). Other parallels to this shape can be found in various Iron Age IIA contexts, mainly in the north; Taanach I: Figs. 45- 47; 93:1-2, Period IIB; H. Rosh Zayit: 111 , Fig. 9:2; Megiddo II: PL 89:10 (Stratum VA). See also 'Ajrud: Fig. 3:19-20. While all of the parallels to this bowls date to before the end of the 8th century, one 45</page><page sequence="54">example from Tell el-Far' ah (N) Stratum I ( Tell el- Far 'ah I: PL 56:8) appears to be similar to our bowl, and represents one of the few contemporary parallels. Compare also a painted bowl from Tawilan that is comparable to our example in shape and date ( Tawilan : 54, Fig. 6.3:13). The Tel Batash bowl was apparently a local product emulating a shape that had been popular at an earlier date, especially in the north. BL 12.

The base is either a small ring or a disc base. It is smaller and deeper than BL 24 (see above). While several of these have a single groove under the rim exterior in Stratum III, most do not; the groove becomes a characteristic trait in Stratum II. In the pottery plates, only three examples represent this type in Stratum III, though in the typological regis- 46 tration this type comprises ca. 21% of all bowls in the stratum. This may be due to a confusion in reg- istration between BL 12 and BL 24, since only small rim sherds were present. In Stratum III, 16% of the bowls are red-slipped and wheel-burnished, mostly inside and outside. This is the commonest bowl in Stratum II. 12% of these bowls have red slip inside and outside, mostly unburnished. PL 54:1 is different, with its horizon- tally burnished red slip inside and outside to the carination; it also lacks the exterior groove. The bowls related to this type may be divided into two variants (which were not separated in the typo- logical registration): A) small bowls lacking a groove (diameter ca. 11-13 cm), e.g. PL 31:20; and B) slightly larger bowls with a groove under the rim exterior (diameter ca. 14.5-17 cm), e.g. Pl. 31:7. A few deviations from the main type were included in Stratum II, such as Pis. 64:7 and 94:4, which are more round-sided, and Pis. 34:2 and 54:3, which lack the groove and have somewhat different proportions. Variant A (Photo 13). Several nearby sites yielded similar small, deep carinated bowls, though with a carination generally lower than that of our BL 12, e.g. Zimhoni 1990: Fig. 3:1-6 (Lachish Level III). This is equivalent to TufheH's Class B.12, termed a "rice bowl," e.g. Lachish III : PL 79:45. Lachish V: PL 44:3 is a similarly proportioned bowl attributed to Level IV (though see note 4 above for the 8th cen- tury date of this group). See also Zimhoni's Group I from Locus 4421 at Lachish, which she dated to the l^te 9th-8th centuries (Zimhoni 1997: 149, Fig. 3.62, though note Nos. 3 and 5, which are shallower and are more like our BL 24). See also TBM I: Pis. 64:17-19; 67:1-6, 8, 9 (Stratum A); Beth Shemesh IV: Pl. LXIIL23-27 (Stratum lib, No. 24 with a slight groove outside); Jerusalem IV: Fig. 2:1 1-22 (Cave II, both lower and higher carination); Fig. 10:14-25 (Cave I); the type designated "low-carinated small deep bowl" from Cave I is most analogous to variant A of our BL 12, with both lower and higher cari- nation; Ramat Rahel I: Fig. 11:5-9 (Stratum V); 'Eton Tombs: Fig. 8:8; Beer-sheba I: Pl. 69:8-9 (Stratum II, slightly thicker); Arad: Fig. 12:2 (Stra- tum X); Tel Miqne: Gitin 1989a: Fig. 2.13:4 (Stratum IB). The chronological range of these comparisons reflects the appearance of this bowl type at Tel Batash during Strata III- II, with a main distribution in 8th century levels in Judah, and appearing less frequently in the late 7th century (Aharoni and Aharoni 1976: 76, Fig. 2:1).</page><page sequence="55">Variant B (Photo 14) is found almost exclusively in Stratum II, though grooves occasionally appear on red-slipped and burnished bowls of this type in Stratum III (e.g. Pis. 13:11 and 23:8). It appears to have been a product of the local regional pottery industry, as this grooved variant has parallels mainly at Tel Miqne Stratum IB (Gitin 1989a: Fig. 2.13:9) and Mesad Hashavyahu : Fig. 4:8, which in our view was related to Tel Miqne. Gitin contends that this is a coastal type (Gitin 1989a: 45), though it should be noted that at Ashdod the few bowls that might be compared to this shape are actually quite different (e.g. Ashdod //-///: Fig. 93:12, Stratum VII). Among the small deep carinated bowls found in the caves in the City of David mentioned above, it may be noted that several are very similar in shape to this second variant of BL 12 (e.g. Jerusalem IV: Fig. 10:20-21, 24-25, Cave I). In addition, there is another related type, called "small deep slightly carinated bowls, flared grooved rim," which also resembles BL 12, though with a softer carination and mostly self-slipped and wheel-burnished inside. The appearance of both the grooved and ungrooved bowls in Jerusalem is similar to Tel Miqne Stratum IB, where the two variants were found together as well. However, the grooved bowls from Jerusalem were treated with slip and burnish, while this trait is lacking at Tel Batash, Tel Miqne and Mesad Hashavyahu. This appears to be a regional rather than a chronological factor. Thus, while the ungrooved variant with both low and mid-body carination is found at sites throughout Judah, mainly in the 8th century but continuing in the 7th century as well, the slightly larger, under- rated, grooved variant may be considered typical of the local pottery industry of the large city state of Ekron during the 7th century. Its popularity at Tel Batash may be regarded as an expression of the close connections between the small town of Tel Batash and Ekron, the main city of the region. The appear- ance of a very similar grooved bowl at Jerusalem in an 8th or early 7th century context in considerable quantities is notable as well. Since BL 24 and BL 27, the typical carinated bowls of Strata IV-III, virtually disappear in Stratum II, it seems that BL 12 replaces them as the popular carinated bowl during the course of the 8th century, becoming dominant in the 7th century. This process was apparently noted at Beth Shemesh as well (Beth Shemesh IV: Pl. LXIII: 23). BL 46.

The one complete preserved profile shows a ring base. Most of these finely made bowls are red-slipped and have fine wheel burnish, or are continuously bur- nished to a polish, inside and outside or inside and outside down to the curve. A few examples are self- slipped and continuously burnished. The outstanding characteristic of this type is its relative delicacy and fine surface treatment, which set it apart from the coarser, more utilitarian look of the other small carinated bowls, such as BL 12. This type is rare in Stratum III (only 12 examples). This type remains rare in Stratum II. There is no marked difference in shape or surface treatment between the bowls of Strata III and II. The highly burnished red slip inside and partially outside, common in Stratum III, continues unaltered on most of these bowls in Stratum II, a trait usually not found on other Stratum II bowls in the corpus. PI. 54:6 is an intermediate type between BL 24 and BL 46: its stance is more similar to BL 24, while its thin, finely shaped curved walls and decoration are closer to BL 46. This bowl is the most delicate of the Iron Age II bowls at Tel Batash, made of well-levigated clay and finely finished. Such bowls were defined as "delicate flaring bowls" by Amiran, who claimed that this was a common shape among the late Iron Age II bowls in the south (Amiran 1969: 206). However, it is not frequent at Tel Batash, and it is one of the types for which it was most difficult to determine secure par- 47</page><page sequence="56">alieis, as drawings and photographs do not ade- quately reflect the delicate nature and surface treat- ment that characterize this type at Tel Batash. The following are some comparable bowls, in shape as well as quality of ware and surface treat- ment: Beth Shemesh IVē. Pl.

Among the "small deep carinated bowls" found in Cave II in the City of David were several bowls that answer to the description of BL 46 {Jerusalem IV : Fig. 2:23-25); note, however, that Nos. 23 and 24 have grooved upper exteriors, like variant B of BL 12 (see above).

If these parallels are indeed valid, the chronological range is from the 8th century to the end of the Iron Age II, with a mainly Judean distribution. BL 47. Small deep bowls with out-turned rim (Photo 15) Stratum IIIA: PL 91:15(?) Stratum II: Pis. 31:21, 25-26; 41:29; 58:10(7); 60:4; 94:5 Unstratified: PL 76:1 Photo 15. BL 47 (PL 41:29). Scale 1:3. 48 Small, deep bowls (diameter ca. 13 cm) with a low soft carination and slightly flaring sides rising to a pointed, overhanging rim. The rim of PL 3 1 :26 is both overhanging and pressed in; however, the gen- eral stance and surface treatment of this bowl places it with this type. Most have well-made ring bases. 48% of these have light red slip and wheel burnish inside, or inside and on the rim exterior; this is a relatively high percentage for such treatment in Stratum II. These finely made and decorated bowls are somewhat reminiscent of BL 46, with the unique rim treatment setting them apart. A close parallel to this bowl was found at Tel Miqne (Gitin 1989a: Fig. 2.13:1, Stratum IB). Similar bowls were also found at Mesad Hashavyahu : Fig. 4:6 and Ashdod //-///: Fig. 40:1, Stratum VIII (the latter recalls our Pl. 31:25). This bowl type at Ashdod was compared to the Iron Age II chalice rims found at that site (ibid.: 97). Thus, this appears to be a type found on the coast and inland as far as Tel Batash, mainly in the late 7th century. Flat Bowls: BL 14, BL 15 BL 14. Bowls with flaring sides and overhanging rim Stratum III: Pis. 14:3^; 24:16(7); 29:19 Stratum IIIA: PL 91:16-17 Stratum II: Pis. 54:15-16; 64:20; 71:21; 94:6(7) BL 14 Small to medium-sized (diameter ca. 13-18 cm), finely made shallow bowls with straight or very slightly rounded, flaring sides terminating in a pointed, overhanging triangular outer rim, either everted or pressed in, short or long. The only pre- served base is a flat, low disc base. Only a small number of bowls were defined as belonging to this type. In Stratum III, 12% of these bowls (four out of 17) are red-slipped inside and outside, while 11% are slipped inside or inside and on the rim only. In Stratum II, 4% are red-slipped</page><page sequence="57">inside and outside, while 72% are red-slipped inside only, or inside and on the outer rim. The latter per- centage of red slip is very high for Stratum II, when such treatment generally decreases. In both strata, ring burnish is the dominant type of burnish. This bowl joins the category of straight-sided bowls (often termed "plates"; see below, BL 15) that become frequent in the latter part of the Iron Age II throughout the entire country, generally characterized by ring burnish inside (Amiran 1969: 200). Parallels to this type are varied and date mostly to the 7th century. A close comparison (see especially our PI. 71:21) is a bowl from Tel Miqne Stratum IB (Gitin 1989a: Fig. 2.13:2); Gitin calls this bowl a "southern" type, though qualifying this with a question mark (ibid.: 45). Freud and Beit-Arieh (&lt; Qitmit : 212, Fig. 4.1:12) conclude that this is a Judean type. Indeed, a number of analogous bowls, most with ring burnish, may be mentioned: Lachish III : PI. 80:65 (Tomb 106, Levels III- II; this is Tufhell's Class B.ll); Beth Shemesh : PEFA : PI. LIV:8 (Tomb 8 repository); PI. LVII:1 (Tomb 8); Jerusalem , Ophel : Pis. 7:3; 9:22; 10:3; 10:4; 14:10- 11; 16:11; Ramai Rahel II: Fig. 16:16, 26-28 (Stra- tum VA); Arad : Fig. 25:1 (Stratum VII); Fig. 29:1 (Stratum VI); Masos IL PI. 163:4 (Iron Age II); Tel (Ira : Fig. 6.71:1 (Strata VIII-VI); Nasbeh II : PL 68. Note the appearance of such a bowl at Kuntillet 'Ajrud (' Ajrud : 145, Fig. 3:6). Several comparisons were also found along the coast: Ashdod I: Fig. 37:5 (Stratum VIII); Mesad Hashavyahu : Fig. 4:1-2; Dor : Fig. 1.15:3 (late 8th century). Similar rims were found on wide, shallow bowls with a high ring base at Samaria (e.g. Samaria III : Figs. 4:16; 13:13), dated to the end of the 9th to the 8th centuries (Tappy 1992: 187). The overhanging rim like that in PI. 14:3 is typical of a group of Phoenician bowls (e.g. Keisan : PI. 39, Stratum 5, mostly painted with typical Phoenician decoration). The appearance of this form at Transjordanian sites (e.g. Sahab : Fig. 3:1-2, 8th-7th centuries) may have been a result of Phoenician influence, as is the case for other pottery forms in Transjordan. Bowls of similar shape bearing typical Edomite painted deco- ration were found at Tawilan in a context of the late 7th-6th centuries ( Tawilan : Fig 6.1:13). This bowl type at Tel Batash perhaps represents a southern and coastal variant of the popular plate bowl, whose rim shape was influenced by Phoe- nician or other northern forms. BL 15. Bowls with straight, flaring sides and simple rim Stratum III: PL 14:2 Stratum II: Pis. 31:27-28; 60:5 BL 15 Small shallow bowls (diameter 11-12.5 cm) with straight, flaring sides forming a V-shape; the sides sometimes bear slight wheel marks. PL 14:2 (Stratum III) is larger and has a brown wash and a few ring burnish lines. The rim top is tapering or rounded, and the flat base is relatively narrow and sometimes thickened. Some of the smaller examples, especially Pl. 37:27-28, may have served as lids rather than bowls. Despite the popularity of these bowls at numerous sites both in Judah and Israel, they are not common at Tel Batash. In Stratum III, 33% (3 out of 9) have red slip and one has self slip, while in Stratum II, 27% (4 out of 15) have red slip and one has self slip. Of the Stratum II bowls, 23% have ring burnish. Thus, about half of this type remained unslipped and unburnished, which is atypical of this type at other sites, where most are reported with such treatment. This bowl type, often termed a "plate," was one of the most popular in 8th-7th century assemblages in Judah. At Lachish it started to appear as early as Level V, where it had a slightly convex disc base and was undecorated (Zimhoni 1997: Fig. 3.4, Type B-l), and continued to appear in Levels III-II (ibid.: Fig. 3.56:2, 4, 5, Group A from Locus 4421). See also Zimhoni 1990: Fig. 3:7, 10 (Level III); Lachish III : Pl. 80:61 (Tufhell's Class B.10). It is interesting to note that this is one of the few bowl types at Lachish that had less slip and burnish during Levels V and IV than in Levels III and II (Zimhoni 1997: 74). At Gezer this is Gitin's Bowl Type 62, which began in the mid-9th century and was most common there in the 8th century horizon {Gezer III : 184-185). The following partial list reflects the widespread distribution of the variations of this bowl: Jerusalem , Ophel : Figs. 2:3-14; 7:2; 10:2; 13:19; 22:1-7; Jer- 49</page><page sequence="58">Only four sherds of these bowls (average diameter 17 cm) were identified at Tel Batash. This type has a short, vertical neck above a softly carinated shoulder. The rim top is rounded. The bowls presented in the plates are all covered with a light red slip and fine horizontal hand burnish inside and outside. Due to the extremely fragmentary nature of the sherds attributed to this type, parallels were difficult to determine. Short-necked bowls and kraters are a known type in Iron Age II assemblages, where they are usually red-slipped and burnished. A bowl from Locus 4421 at Lachish, dated to the late 9th to mid- 8th centuries, is similar to our bowl in shape and surface treatment (Zimhoni 1997: 144, Fig. 3.59:6). Compare also Jerusalem, Ophel , PL 26:6 (mid-8th to mid-7th centuries); Jerusalem IV : Fig. 17:1 (Cave I); 50 usalem IV : Fig. 1:10, 12 (Cave II); Fig. 9:25 (Cave I); Ramat Rahel I: Fig. 11:1 (Stratum V); En-Gedi : Fig. 15:3-4 (Stratum V); Beer-sheba I : PL 74:3 (Stratum II); Tel 'Ira: Fig. 6.59:1-2 (Stratum VII); Qitmit : Fig. 4.1:5-6, 8, 10; 'Ajrud: Fig. 3:2-3; Ash- dod IV: Fig. 13:18 (Stratum VIII). Similar bowls appear in the northern part of the country, for example: Dor : Figs. 1.1:1; 1.3:1; Samaria III : Figs. 6:1; 13:1-3 (Period IV; seeTappy 1992: 115); Tellel- Far'ah I: PL 57:19-28 (Stratum Vild); Megiddo I: PL 24:40-42 (Strata IV-II); Hazor III-IV: Pis. CLXXX:4, 6; CLXXXL27-37 (Stratum VII); Hazor II: Pl. LXXX:38 (Stratum VA). See also Sa'idiyeh: Fig. 6:6 (Stratum VI); Fig. 10:22-24 (Stratum V). The relative scarcity of these bowls at Tel Batash may reflect a regional distinction, as such bowls are not published so far from Tel Miqne or Mesad Hashavyahu, but were found at Gezer. Additional Bowls BL 34. Small deep bowls with vertical high rim/neck Stratum III: PL 87:11 Stratum IIIA: PL 91:21 BL 34 Ashdod IV: Fig. 13:19 (Stratum VIII); Samaria III: Figs. 14:1; 20:8 (Periods V-VI). A similarly shaped neck appears on a globular bowl from Tyre (Bikai 1978: PL X:19, Stratum III, last third of the 8th century). Note also Tell el-Kheleifeh: 43, PL 27:16- 17, presented with the Assyrian-related related forms. Short-necked bowls (though usually larger) were found in large numbers at Tawilan, bearing typical painted Edomite decoration ( Tawilan : Fig. 6.10). BL 18. Shallow asymmetrical bowls with handles ("scoops") (Photo 16) Stratum III: Pis. 14:15-18; 24:19 Stratum II: Pis. 54:25; 102:3(?); 104:1-3 Photo 16. BL 18 (PL 14:16). Scale 1:3. Medium-sized bowls (diameter ca. 21.5-25 cm) with "a bent back wall that is vertical, slightly angled, or cyma-shaped, and two curved elbow- shaped or over-sized loop handles" (Gitin 1993a: 100); the rim top is generally tapering or rounded. The base is rounded or slightly concave. All are undecorated. The shape remains basically unchanged in Strata III and II. Gitin's comprehensive discussion (1993a) of this type, termed a "scoop," summarizes both published and unpublished examples, dividing them into Late</page><page sequence="59">Bronze Age II/Iron Age I and Iron Age II horizons (ibid.: 101). Gitin claimed (ibid.: 104) that this bowl should be associated with centralized authority dealing with food distribution, with Tel Batash spe- cifically mentioned as a "frontier" site on the border between Judah and Philistia.8 Most of the scoops from Stratum III were found in Building 737, together with LMLK storage jars. This indicates that the vessels were indeed possibly used for a function related to food storage or distribution, such as utensils for filling large containers with grains or other foodstuff. The find spots of the Stratum II scoops were more widely dispersed and were not necessarily related to such functions. BL 20. Heavy straight-sided bowls with thickened rim ("mortaria") (Photo 17) Stratum II: Pis. 32:6-7; 54:21-22; 58:16-17; 60:10; 64:22-25; 71:22-23; 96:6 Strata II-I: PL 102:6-7 Stratum I: Pis. 76:3-7; 98:12-13; 105:1 Photo 17. BL 20 (Pl. 64:25). Scale 1:3. These large bowls (diameter ca. 29-39 cm), termed "mortaria," have straight, or very slightly rounded, flaring sides terminating in a thickened rim exterior, which is either long or short, overhanging or rounded. In Stratum I (the Persian period), the rims tend to be shorter and somewhat more pressed-in. They often have pronounced wheel marks, forming a "rippled" exterior (e.g. PI. 58:16), though the sides are also smooth (e.g. PI. 32:7). The base is generally a heavy concave or flat disc base, though in Stratum I they generally have molded, high ring bases (e.g. Pis. 76:7 and 98:13). The mortaria are not common in Stratum II at Tel Batash. See also the discussion of the Persian period pottery, p. 186 below. Mortaria, though considered a coastal type, are found in various Iron Age II assemblages, for example: Gezer III : 210-212, PI. 28:9-10 (Stratum V); En-Gedi : Fig. 16:1-2 (Stratum V); Arad : Fig. 29:4 (Stratum VI); Masos II: PI. 163:1 (Area G, Iron Age II); Aroer. 255, Fig. 6:1 (7th century); Ashdod I: Fig. 40:10-11 (Stratum VII); Ashdod //-///: 113, Figs. 45:15; 50:1 (Stratum VIII); Qasilell : Fig. 58:3- 4 (Stratum VII); Tel Michal: Fig. 9.1:1 (Stratum XI); Dor: Fig. 1.3:9-10 (Area A, Phase 9; Type 7a is the most similar to our bowls); Tel Miqne: Gitin 1995: Fig. 4.5:18 (Stratum IB); Mesad Hashavyahu: Fig. 4:16-17; Tell el-Far ( ah I: PL 54:10 (Stratum Vile); Keisan: Pis. 28:1; 31:3-7 (Stratum 4); Pl. 45:5 (Stratum 5); Megiddo I: Pl. 23:13-17 (Strata III- II); H. Rosh Zayit (Gal and Alexandre 2000: Fig. VII. 11:19 and discussion, pp. 190-191). All the late Iron Age examples have flat bases, though such bases continue into the Persian period as well. Most of the examples come from contexts of the 7th century, apart from the two items from Ashdod Stratum VIII and the one from H. Rosh Zayit, which are from 8th- century contexts. At Lachish, Tufnell relegates most of these bowls to post-exilic contexts, though several have the flat bases characteristic of the Iron Age examples (Lachish III: 279-280, Pl. 98:563-568, Tufiiell's Class B.14). These bowls indeed became more common in post-exilic contexts of the 6th-5th cen- turies (Stern 1982: 96-98; Dor: 53-54) and are widespread in Persian period levels throughout the country, always with high ring base, e.g. Tel Michal: Fig. 9:16-18 (Strata X-VII); Gezer III: 235-236, Pl. 30: 4-5, 16, 20 (Strata V-IV; Types 149-153); Ash- dod IV: Fig. 29:5-6 (Stratum V); Qiri: Fig. 3:1 (Stratum IV). Most of the mortaria at Tel Batash were made of a whitish-green clay (our FG 13), which is typical of other sites as well, and were found in domestic contexts alongside the more popular bowl types of the time. 51</page><page sequence="60">BL 21. Shallow bowls in black fabric with black slip (Photo 18) Stratum II: Pis. 58:4; 60:1 Photo 18. BL 21 (PL 60:1). Scale 1:3. Two shallow bowls made of black fabric and covered with a black slip that is continuously bur- nished to a polish inside and outside. PI. 58:4 comes from the second street level, most probably an early phase of Stratum II. It is small (diameter 13.5 cm) and shallow, with slightly curving sides and a plain, round-topped rim. The base is a gradually stepped disc base. PI. 60:1, found in the uppermost street level, is a shallow bowl (rim diameter 17.5 cm) with slightly rounded sides above a gradually stepped base; the rim is a horizontal ledge. These two bowls are unique at Batash in their shape and highly pol- ished black slip. Black-fabric burnished bowls are quite frequent in Transjordan, such as in Ammonite tombs of the late Iron Age (Harding 1945: 74, No. 46; Sahab : 97, No. 15; Harding 1950: PI. XVII:2); Tell el-'Umeiri (Herr 1989: Figs. 19.4:23; 19.9:29) and Buseirah (Bennett 1975: 8, Fig. 5:6). Two rim sherds of round-sided deep bowls made of black-burnished fabric were found at Tawilan, dated generally to the late Iron Age II/Persian period ( Tawilan : 102-103). Production of Edomite shapes in this ware led Bienkowski to suggest that this ware is Edomite, or at least Trans- jordanian, though qualifying this by stating that it was found only in small quantities in this region {Tawilan: 59-60). Black-fabric and black-slipped bowls, usually burnished, of shapes that recall our bowls are found 52 at sites in Judah,9 along the coast and in the north, mainly in 7th century contexts, such as: RamatRahel I: Fig. 11:4 (Stratum V); Ashdod IV : Figs. 19:8; 26:8 (Stratum VII); Jemmeh : PL LXV: 11-14, 19-20 (dated to 700 BCE, "pottery of the Assyrian occupation," ibid.: 24); Dor : Fig. 1.3: 17 (Area A, Phase 9, Bowl 25a); Qiri: Fig. 43:5. A three-legged bowl with black slip and burnish was found at Tell en-Nasbeh {Nasbeh II: PL 63:1443, Iron Age II). Bowls of similar form to ours but with wheel- burnished red slip were found at Judean sites, e.g. Jerusalem II: Fig. 2-29:7 (Cave III); Jerusalem IV: Fig. 12:4 (Cave I); Nasbeh II: PL 63:1448; Arad: Fig. 22:2 (Stratum VIII). Dor: Fig. 1.8:6 (Phase 7, Area C2) recalls our PL 60:1. A similar shape was also found in the Adoni Nur Tomb in Transjordan (Amiran 1969: PL 101:3). Some of the thick "Samarían Ware" bowls have stepped bases as well, and they occasionally have burnished black slip (Amiran 1969: 212). Hunt defined the bowl from Tel Qiri as "Samarían Ware" {Qiri: 203); however, Gilboa notes that the quality of the slip of the so-called "thick Samarían bowls" is inferior to that of the black bowls, and prefers to relate the latter to Assyrian inspiration {Dor: 4-5). The Assyrian affinity of burnished black slip on bowls of these shapes was also observed at Ashdod {Ashdod IV: 35). Note also a carinated Assyrian- shaped bowl from Samaria made from thin black ware {Samaria III: Fig. 1 1 :22, Period VII). The black slip bowls found at Tell el-'Umeiri were also com- pared to Assyrian Palace Ware (London, Plint and Smith 1991: 437). It may be suggested that while the black slip on the thick "Samarían Ware" bowls is a local feature similar to the surface treatment of the "black juglets" of Iron Age II (see below, our JT 9), the black-slip- ped bowls under discussion may display Assyrian influence, perhaps inspired by metal vessels. Bowls with the shape and treatment of the latter may have been brought into the country with the Assyrian conquest, and continued the existing local tradition of black slip, now applied to bowls of Assyrian shape. Such bowls also reached Transjordanian centers in the late 7th century, where they became a known feature. The relative rarity of black ware in Cisjordan and its popularity in Transjordan raises the possibility that the two bowls discussed here were imported from Transjordan, though this cannot be sub- stantiated.</page><page sequence="61">Varia The following bowls could not be attributed to any of the typological groups discussed above. BL varia 3 1 * 1 IV III II Stratum IV PL 82:8. A small shallow bowl (or lid?) (rim diam- eter 8.5 cm; 1.5 cm deep), carinated above the thick disc base, with straight sides rising to a plain, tapering rim. PL 85:2-3. Sherds of two similar shallow, thick- walled bowls with a vertical or slightly in-turning stance above the low carination; the rim top is flat or slightly rounded. Both bowls are red-slipped inside and outside. The general stance is reminiscent of BL 24, but the size, thickness and rim top are different. Pis. 86:8; 87:1. Sherds of two similar small, thin- walled bowls with slightly incurving rim tops; both are red-slipped and burnished inside and outside. Pl. 86:15. A fragment of a large, thick-walled bowl (or krater) with slightly rounded sides and a pro- nounced ridge below the rim exterior; the rim top is rounded. The bowl has light red slip and a few burnish lines inside and outside between the rim exterior and the ridge. A similar vessel was found at Tell el-Far 'ah (N) Ç Tell el-Far ' ah I: PL 56:3, Stratum Vllb). Stratum III Pl. 13:14. A fragment of a round-sided bowl with a thickened rim recalling BL 13; its unique character- istic is the deep groove on the outside of the rim. The bowl is red-slipped inside and outside. Note a similar rim shape at Hazor ( Hazor II : Pl. LXIIL22, Stratum VII; Pl. LXVIL7, Stratum VI). Grooved and pro- truding outer rims were found on some bowls at Dor, though it is not certain that these are related {Dor : Fig. 1.3:11-12, Area A, Phase 9, Bowl Type 35a). PL 13:15. A large, shallow bowl with a round-topped hammer-head rim protruding sharply outwards, cre- ating a pronounced ledge. A rounded carination is located below the rim exterior. One flat-sectioned handle was preserved; the bowl may have had two such handles. Though this bowl is reminiscent of some rims belonging to our BL 11, it is unique. The presence of handles also sets it apart, as this is a rare feature on bowls in our corpus. PL 13:28. A fragment of a deep bowl with a rounded thickened rim exterior; the slightly rounded sides are ridged below the rim exterior. Red slip covers the ridges and the rim interior. While the rounded rim exterior somewhat recalls that of BL 13, this bowl is different. A somewhat similar shape, though slightly shallower, with ridges below a thickened rim and red slip on the rim, was found at Ramat Rahel in a later context ( Ramat Rahel I: Fig. 25:2, Stratum V). Pis. 14:10, 14; 27:7; 91:14. Fragments of four finely made, thin-walled bowls with splayed sides. PI. 14:10 is relatively shallow, with a slightly thickened, flat rim interior, and is red-slipped inside and outside. The shape of the rim recalls Phoenician bowls like those at Tell Keisan Stratum V (, Keisan : PI. 38). PI. 14:14 is deeper, with an everted rim, red-slipped and burnished to a polished finish inside and on the rim exterior. PI. 27:7 is also deep, with remains of a carination below the splayed sides. Its rim exterior is down-turned to a point; it is red-slipped with ring burnish forming a highly polished surface inside and outside. PL 91:14 has somewhat more curved sides above a slight carination; the rim top is everted and tapering. The bowl is red-slipped and burnished inside and outside to the carination. A rim from Kuntillet 'Ajrud is very similar in shape and surface treatment ('Ajrud: 179, Fig. 22:1; Ayalon proposed that it could be defined as a bowl, a jug, a bottle or a chalice). Despite the relative heterogeneity that they display, these four bowls may perhaps be defined as a broadly related group. PL 23:1. A fragment of a medium-sized, deep bowl with splayed sides, a soft carination (broken) and a plain rounded rim top, with a few irregular splashes of red paint. Compare to a similar shape from Gezer Stratum VB ( Gezer III: Fig. 13:5, Bowl Type 59A), defined there as a rare form related to the wide 53</page><page sequence="62">cannateci bowls that appear slightly later, which are more similar to our BL 24 (e.g. ibid.: Fig. 20:6-7, Stratum VI). Pl. 29:6. The ring base of a small bowl, covered with red slip and horizontal wheel burnish, and painted with concentric black lines inside, recalling the tra- dition of "Ashdod Ware." Such decoration is com- mon in Stratum VIII at Ashdod, but is rare at Tel Batash after Stratum IV. PL 87:16. A fragment of a large, shallow bowl with rounded sides and a flat-topped, shelf-like rim pro- truding outwards; red slip inside. Zimhoni {'Eton: 64, Fig.8:2) defines a similar fragment from Stratum I at Tel 'Eton as a "ledge rim bowl," categorizing it together with bowls similar to our BL 11. For a similar bowl, see TBM I: PI. 65:1. For a similar rim, though less massive, see Jerusalem , Ophel : PI. 10:12; see also Keisan : 169, PI. 39 (Stratum V), similar rims, though apparently on slightly deeper bowls, with painted Phoenician motifs. Bowls with similar, though more down-turned rims were found in Phase 9 of Area A at Dor {Dor: Fig. 1.3:7-8). These were considered to be of Phoenician origin as well (ibid.: 3). At Gezer, a thin-walled, straight- sided bowl (deeper than ours) with a horizontal rim, Gitin's Type 60, was related to "Samarían Ware," ca. mid-9th-8th centuries {Gezer III: 180-181, PI. 14:14). PL 89:14-15. Fragments of two small, deep bowls with straight sides and small, flat-topped hammer- head rims. Both are red-slipped inside and outside. PI. 89:15 has a knob handle under the rim exterior. Sherds of two similar bowls were found at Ashdod {Ashdod IV: Fig. 13:13, 15, Stratum VIII). Pl. 90:5. An incurving rim sherd with a very slight groove on the exterior above mid-body. Pl. 90:10. A body sherd of a thin, delicate bowl. The interior is red-slipped and covered with an irregular hand burnish. An unslipped band is painted with black dots. Pl. 93:13. A fragment of a large, shallow softly carinated bowl with a small inverted hammer-head rim; its general stance recalls BL 1 1 . It has red slip and horizontal hand burnish inside and outside to the carination. 54 Stratum II Pis. 32:3; 54:10. Two medium-sized bowls with a soft carination just above mid-body; the rim is a shelf protruding inside and outside; no base was preserved. Compare En-Gedi: Fig. 15:2 (Stratum V). Pl. 38:11. A small closed bowl with a rounded body, widest at mid-point. The rim is short and vertical, and the base is flat; traces of vertical burnish outside. The small size and unique shape of this bowl suggest that it may have been a votive vessel. Very few comparisons were found: two small bowls from an Iron Age tomb from Amman (Harding 1945: 69, No. 5; 74, No. 48); En-Gedi: Fig. 32:5 (from the Clark Collection, called a jar). Pl. 42:1. A large bowl (rim diameter 27.5 cm; 9 cm deep) with slightly rounded sides, a plain, tapering rim top and a disc base. This is a basic utilitarian bowl shape, somewhat recalling the mortarium (BL 20). Pl. 55:1. A small, closed bowl with rounded sides and a short neck formed by an everted, slightly rounded rim top. A similar, though thicker, bowl was found at Lachish {Lachish V: PI. 49:2, Level II). See also a bowl from Tell Beit Mirsim {TBM I: PI. 67:20- 26, Stratum A). Compare PI. 98:11, which was found in a Stratum I context but may be earlier. Pl. 64:12. A large bowl (diameter 37 cm) with a completely preserved profile. Its thick rounded hammer-head rim protrudes inside and out. A high soft carination below the rim exterior forms an S- shape profile. It appears to have had a wide convex disc base. PL 96:5. A bowl fragment with straight, very splayed sides above a small, round carination, below which it is broken; it is red-slipped and ring-burnished inside. The shape is Phoenician and finds parallels at Tell Keisan Stratum 5 (see Keisan: PI. 38 for varieties of rims in this tradition). Similar, though thicker, bowls are found at Dor {Dor : Fig. 1.3:4-5, Area A, Phase 9, Type 3a-b). Compare also a bowl from Tyre (Bikai 1978: PI. 9:2, Strata III-II).</page><page sequence="63">CHALICES Table 8.

Fragments of chalices from Strata IV-II and five complete chalices from Stratum II demonstrate the continuity in use of chalices at Tel Batash throughout the Iron Age II, mostly in domestic contexts. The very appearance of a number of chalices in late 7th century contexts at Tel Batash, as well as at nearby Tel Miqne-Ekron, is an unusual phenomenon, in light of their paucity at other contemporary sites. Though the chalices have much in common, the following typological definitions are based mainly on the rim shapes. CH 4. Chalices with everted rims (Photos 19-21); for color photographs, see Keim and Mazar 1995: Fig. C26) Stratum IVB: Pl. 85:7 Stratum IV: Pis. 82:15; 84:9-10 Stratum III: Pis. 14:13; 22:8; 91:13(7), 19 Stratum II: Pis. 56:1-2; 58:18; 60:3; 65:1 CH 4 This type includes all the chalices with shallow bowls (rim diameter ca. 15.5-20 cm; 5-7 cm deep) and everted rims (cyma-profiled), a generic shape that spanned all the Iron Age II strata at Tel Batash, though with certain variations. No complete profiles were preserved in Strata IV and III; in certain cases, the sherds were too small to determine securely whether they indeed belonged to chalices or to bowls (such as PL 14:13). Some of the rims from Stratum III are particularly long and the bowls are small and deep (e.g. Pis. 22:8 and 91:19). The two complete chalices from Stratum II in PI. 56:1-2 have a softly carinated, moderately shallow wide bowl, with a straight high pedestal foot flaring to a wide base. In terms of production technique, the bowl and base were made separately; the foot was made as an open cylinder and the bowl had a pointed base that was inserted into the foot and attached before drying.

Scale 1:4. 56 Pl. 65:1 is one of two exceptional chalices from Stratum II (Building F608, Locus F637); the other is PI. 65:2 (the latter is defined as CH 5 due to its rim form, in accordance with our principle of defining the type according to the rim shape). Both chalices have a tall foot. PI. 65:1 has a softly carinated bowl, smaller and somewhat deeper than those in PI. 56:1- 2, with an emphasized join between the bowl and foot; the high foot has a soft shoulder and is straight and narrow above a narrow flaring base. The high straight base of these two chalices differs from the flaring lower foot, often ridged, found on 10th-8th century chalices. In Stratum III, three chalices are red-slipped and burnished outside and on the inside rim. In Stratum II, one chalice is red-slipped; none are burnished. PI. 65:1 has white slip and a red painted decoration consisting of three bands on the foot and three bands on the bowl exterior, the lower two flanking diagonal lines. For parallels to this design at Tel Miqne see the discussion of CH 5. Chalices with everted rims are a common shape in the Iron Age I, e.g. Qasile II : Figs. 32:4-5; 43:22; 52:15 (Strata XII-X, Chalice Type 2; discussion ibid.: 49); ' Izbet Sartah : Fig. 15:6 (Stratum II); Beth Shemesh IV: PI. LIX:26 (Stratum III); Megiddo I: PI. 33:18, 20 (Stratum V). Many examples of this shape are found in 10th century contexts, e.g. Lachish V : PL 41:14-21 (Level V); Beth Shemesh IIIņ. Fig. 6:3-54 (Stratum Ha); Beer-sheba /: PL 54:7 (Stratum V); Lahav Tomb: Fig. 4:8; Ashdod IV: Fig. 8:7, 10 (Stratum X); Taa- nach I: PL 27:2 (Period IIA). After the 10th century, the S-shaped bowl chalice (with or without a ridged foot) becomes less frequent, with only isolated examples continuing past the 8th century (see dis- cussions in Amiran 1969: 213; Qasile II: 49; Beth Shemesh V: 142; Lachish III: 280-281; Tel Michal: 84). For a few later examples of such chalices, see Lachish III: PL 83:154 (Tomb 6006); PL 83:156 (Tomb 6020); PL 83:158-159, 162 (Tomb 224); PL 83:160-161 (Tomb 116); Beth Shemesh IV: PL LXVII:3 (Cistern 25); Ruqeish Graves: Fig. l:R3a; Ashdod //-///: Fig. 44:4-5; 51:7 (Stratum VIII); Fig. 58:10 (Stratum VII); the latter is one of the few dating to the 7th century. The bowl of PL 65:1 has somewhat different proportions from the others; its high straight hollow pedestal foot is relatively rare as well, and apparently represents a local feature of the 7th century pottery repertoire of the Tel Miqne-Tel Batash region (note a</page><page sequence="65">similar chalice base, though without a "shoulder": Keisan : PL 32:3, Stratum 4). A finely made flaring rim fragment at Kuntillet 'Ajrud {'Ajrud: Fig. 22:1), which is similar to the stance of Pl. 65:1, was assigned to a chalice (though alternative explanations were offered, ibid.: 179). Of the three complete examples of CH 4 in Stra- tum II, two were found in an apparently cultic con- text (Locus 910a, near a small mudbrick platform in Unit 914; see Timnah I: 222), while PL 65:1 was found in the destruction debris of domestic Building F608, together with a complete chalice of CH 5 and the upper part of a chalice of CH 6 (see below). The other sherds of this type come from sundry locations, such as streets, floors, etc. CH 5. Chalices with vertical, simple rim (Photo 22) Stratum II: Pis. 65:2; 95:1 Photo 22. CH 5 (PL 65:2). Scale 1:4. The two complete examples are the only repre- sentatives of this type; though they are similar, they differ in certain details. PL 65:2 has a shallow bowl (rim diameter ca. 16 cm; 7 cm deep), with a cari- nation near its bottom; the sides taper in towards the foot, which is hollow, slightly splayed, with a flaring base. The bowl is joined to the high foot with a deep inverted omphalos, which is a most unusual feature (compare the nature of this join in the "sister" cha- lice, Pl. 65:1). Pl. 95:1 has a similar, though deeper bowl, with slightly flaring sides and a plain join of the bowl to the foot. The foot is higher and straighten Pl. 95:1 is undecorated. PL 65:2 has a red painted decoration of alternating groups of diagonal lines on the bowl exterior above the carination, on and below which there are two horizontal bands; four horizontal bands appear on the foot; three round "buttons" are applied in relief on the upper third of the leg, above the horizontal bands. These may perhaps be regarded as degenerate versions of the petals found on con- temporary chalices from nearby Tel Miqne (Gitin 1993: 253, Fig. 5:b). The foot stance and painted decoration are similar to the chalice in Pl. 65:1, which was classified as CH 4 due to its bowl shape (see above). Pl. 65:1-2, probably produced in the same workshop, were found together with fragments of another chalice or two (PL 65:3-4) in Building F608, a domestic setting. PL 95:1 was found in Oil Press Building H959. A virtual "twin" of the chalice in Pl. 65:2 may be seen at Tel Miqne, Stratum IB (Gitin 1993: 253, Fig. 5:a; 1995: Fig. 4.5:19); its shallower bowl and high straight foot recall the stance of PL 95:1, but its painted decoration is quite similar to Pl. 65:2, though somewhat richer (it has diagonal lines on the foot as well as on the bowl; lines of red amorphic "splashes" appear on the bowl and on the foot). Gitin defines this chalice as a "Philistine coastal type" and includes it in a group of ceremonial objects. Painted chalices are found in Philistia in Iron Age I and 10th century contexts (notably at Tell el-Far' ah (S), Cemetery 200, see CPP : PL 17, H4 to P2; see also Amiran 1969: 213). However, during the later Iron Age II, painted chalices are very rare, as is the cha- lice form in general. The two painted chalices from Tel Batash and the one published example from Tel Miqne (in addition to other unpublished examples) suggest that this form is a local product of the Tel Miqne-Tel Batash region in the late 7th century, perhaps designed to serve a function in the cult associated with olive oil production (Gitin 1993: 57</page><page sequence="66">253-254). Though it may be proposed that they are a continuation of the painted chalice tradition of Phil- istia, there is a "missing link" between the latest examples of the latter (10th century) and these 7th century chalices. CH 6. Chalices with long, horizontal everted ledge rim Stratum IVB: Pl. 2:22 Stratum IV: Pis. 84:11; 101:2 Stratum IIIA: PI. 93:14 Stratum II: Pis. 32:13(7); 65:3 Only eight sherds belong to this type. The main criterion for classification was the long horizontal ledge rim. The Strata IV and III examples appear to have had a small, deep, possibly carinated bowl. The single Stratum II example has a shallow bowl with a high round carination. PI. 32:13 has a much smaller and thicker bowl than the others, but is included here due to its similar stance. The earlier chalices of this type are red-slipped and burnished inside and on the outer rim, outside and on the inner rim, or inside and outside. PI. 101:2, which is smaller, has red "splashes" on the top of the rim. PI. 65:3 is plain; it was found in Building F608, together with CH 4 and CH 5 (see above). Chalices with horizontal ledge rims are known from the Iron Age I, e.g. Qasile II : 49, Figs. 40:8; 47:9 (Stratum X). For examples from the 10th cen- tury, see Qasile II: Fig. 55:25 (Stratum VIII); Beth Shemesh III : Figs. 5:4-100; 6:3-54 (Stratum IIa); Beth Shemesh /J* Pis. LXIL48, 50, 53; LXIV:35. Grant and Wright claimed that the cyma-shaped flaring rim chalices (our CH 4) are typical of Stratum III at Beth Shemesh, whit^ in Stratum Ha, the hori- zontal ledge rim develops (Beth Shemesh V: 135). Note a very similar shape on a bowl from Tel 'Ira Stratum VI (Tel 'Ira: Fig. 6.100:3). 58 Additional Chalice Fragments Stratum IV Pl. 2:23. A fragment of a thick-walled, flaring base with a thickened bottom and sharp ridge at the breakage point. It is covered with a light red slip, with no traces of burnish. Pl. 2:24. A fragment of what appears to be a narrow, cylindrical pedestal foot, with two sharp ridges; the break on top seems to be just at the join to the bowl. The exterior is red-slipped. PI. 6:9. A fragment of a flaring chalice base, above which the body is swollen, and then tapering in. It may perhaps be compared to a base from Tell Keisan (Keisan: PI. 51:13, Stratum 7). PL 83:10-11. No. 10 is apparently the lower part of a ridged narrow foot. It is red-slipped outside. No. 1 1 is a high and narrow foot with a flaring base, which is thicker as it ascends; a sharp ridge is found below the break. Apparently, the join to the bowl was slightly above the break. The exterior is covered with a light red slip. Stratum III PL 91:20. A wide flaring base with a rounded bot- tom; broken at the join to the foot. It has traces of white slip outside. Stratum II Pl. 32:9. A thick flaring base and the bottom of a solid foot; it may have been the foot of the bowl in PI. 32:13, which comes from the same locus. Pl. 63:9. A flaring base and part of a pedestal foot; note its similarity to the base and foot of PI. 65:1-2 (see above, CH 4 and CH 5). Pl. 65:4. A fragment of a pedestal foot with a ridge, and the join to the bowl. This was found in the destruction debris of Building F608, together with the chalices in PI. 65:1-3. However, none of the published chalices has such a ridged foot. It was probably not related to the bowl of CH 6 shown in PI. 65:3, as the foot is thicker and of different fabric.</page><page sequence="67">KRATERS Kraters Related to the Philistine Tradition: KR 3 KR 3. Bell-shaped kraters with inturned ledge rim Stratum V: Pl. 79:3 Stratum IVB: Pis. 2:12, 14; 4:3 Stratum IV: PI. 12:3(?) KR 3 15 1 0-^ IV III II Medium-sized to large deep kraters (diameter ca. 20.5-27.5 cm; PI. 79:3 is 18.5 cm in diameter), with a vertical or slightly closed stance and rounded sides. The shelf-like rim protrudes on the exterior and angles inward. Since no complete profiles were preserved, the form of the base is unknown. PI. 79:3 was found in a context below a Stratum IV floor and thus may be attributed to Stratum V or early Stratum IVB. Note the vestigial horizontal handle on PI. 2:14. This krater type is a continuation in form of the bell-shaped krater common at Tel Batash in the previous Iron Age I Stratum V ( Timnah III : KR 2), as well as at other sites with Philistine ware (e.g. Dothan 1982: 106-115; Qasile II : 90-92, Krater Type 2, Strata XII-XI; Ashdod I : Fig. 29-30). These krat- ers, found in relatively small quantities in the lowest levels of Stratum IV, are undecorated or sometimes painted with horizontal red lines outside; none bear the typical white slip and Philistine Bichrome motifs that were common on such vessels in the previous stratum. This continuity of shape implies that there was little or no interval between Stratum V and the earliest Stratum IV occupation levels. The possibility should be taken into account that some sherds from Stratum IVB loci may have originated in Stratum V, as the separation between the two was sometimes a matter of very delicate stratigraphie observation. Continuity of Iron Age I "Philistine" krater shapes into late llth-early 10th century levels was noted at several other sites that had contained fully developed Table 9.

Philistine ware in Iron Age I, e.g. Gezerlll : PL 6:22- 23 (Stratum XI); PI. 8:18 (Stratum VIII); Ashdod IV: Fig. 7:9 (Stratum X). Though it is possible that in these cases (including Tel Batash) stray sherds of Iron Age I origin have contaminated early 10th century layers, the difference between the surface treatment and details of shape between KR 3 and the typical Philistine bell-shaped krater points to the former being a separate and later type. Round and Carinated Kraters with Thickened Rims: KR 14a-e9 KR 18a-b KR 14 This is the generic Stratum IV krater; its general characteristics are medium to large size (diameter ca. 22.5-37.5 cm) and in most cases a sharp or round 62 carination just below mid-body, with straight or slightly inverted sides rising above the carination to the thickened, hammer-head rim. No complete profiles were preserved; the bases that appear to have belonged to kraters of this type are generally heavy ring bases (e.g. PI. 1:18-19). It is not clear whether these kraters had handles; the few preserved loop handles extending from the rim to the upper third of the body indicate that at least some did. In Stratum IV, 85% were red-slipped and hand- burnished inside and outside. The slip was often thick and dark red and the burnish lines were gen- erally a combination of irregular and horizontal lines (53%). There is great variability in the exact shape and stance of the rim, but all the cited examples can be defined as belonging to one morphological family.</page><page sequence="71">The following division of these kraters into five subtypes is based on the rim shape. The 17 sherds from Stratum III registered with this type are from insecure stratigraphie contexts, or are typologically uncertain and may have been con- fused with KR 6 (see below). Indeed, none was found in the Stratum III destruction level. Thus, KR 14 should be considered a Stratum IV type. KR 14a. Ridged hammer-head rim (Photo 23) Strata V-IV: PL 100:11, 15, 17 Stratum IVB: Pis. 1:10; 3:3-4, 6-7; 12:13 Stratum IV: Pis. 7:19, 21; 9:18; 11:14; 79:8; 84:13- 14; 82:14; 86:16; 100:13-14 Stratum IVA: Pl. 9:8 Strata IV-III: Pis. 10:17-19; 11:1 Stratum HIB: Pis. 89:3; 90:13 Unstratified: PL 101:9 Photo 23. KR 14a. Scale 1:6. Hammer-head rim with ridged top; angling either inwards or outwards, sometimes horizontal. Though this rim type is quite common in Stratum IV, few parallels could be found: Lachish III : Pl. 100:624 (Levels V-IV, TufnelPs Class B.l, should be dated prior to 900 BCE: ibid.: 268-269); GezerlII : Pl. 8:20 (Stratum VIII); Ashdod IV: Fig. 2:3 (Stratum XB); Qasile II : Fig. 54:11 (Stratum IX); Tel Michal : Fig. 7.2:4 (Strata XIV-XIII); ' Izbet Sartah : Fig. 18:9 (Stratum II); Fig. 22:20 (Stratum I). Most of these examples are red-slipped and hand-burnished. KR 14b. Rounded or flat-topped hammer-head rim Strata V-IV: Pis. 1:12-13(7); 100:10, 16 Stratum IVB: Pis. 1:11; 3:2, 5, 8-11; 4:2(7); 5:17- 18(7); 85:6(7), 11(7) Stratum IV: Pis. 6:12; 7:15-18; 8:17; 9:7; 12:4; 80:13-16, 18; 82:16-20; 83:16, 18; 84:16; 86:6 Strata IV-III: Pis. 11:2; 101:3, 8 Stratum III: Pis. 13:22(7); 25:9; 103:16 Stratum IIIA: Pis. 91:25-26; 92:1-2; 93:16 This rim shape is the most common of the Stratum IV subtypes of this krater type. Many parallels, most of which are red-slipped and irregularly burnished, can be cited. The following is a partial list: Lachish V: Pl. 41:9-10; Lachish III : Pl. 100:617, 622-623 (Levels V-IV, included with TufnelPs Class B.l); several groups of vessels from Lachish Levels V-IV defined by Zimhoni as "large bowls," Zimhoni 1997: Fig. 3.27 (Type B-22); Fig. 3.28 (Type B-23; cf. our PL 8:17); Fig. 3.29 (Type B-24); Fig. 3.30 (Type B- 25); Fig. 3.31 (Type B-26; see our Pis. 6:12; 83:18); Beth Shemesh IV: PL LXIV1-7, 10 (Stratum Ila-b); 'Eton: Fig. 1:8-9 (Stratum II); Fig. 6:1 (Stratum I); M. Aharoni 1981: Fig. 1:5, 7 (Arad Stratum XII); Masos II: Pis. 138:20, 22 (Stratum I/post-I); 139:3 (Stratum I); 147:3 (Stratum II); Beer-sheba II: Fig. 17:19 (Stratum IX); Fig. 27:11-13 (Stratum VI); 6 Ajrud : Fig. 6:1; ' Izbet Sartah: Figs. 16:4; 18:9-12 (Stratum II); Fig. 22:20-22 (Stratum I); Ashdod IV: Fig. 2:9, 14 (Stratum XB); Qasile II: Fig. 54:8-12 (Stratum VIII); Mazar and Harpazi-Ofer 1994: 28, Fig. 18:14, 17, 19, 21, 23 (Stratum IX); Tel Michal: Fig. 7.3:2 (Stratum XIII). Thus, this type appears to be common in the Shephelah, the Negev and is also found in the southern coastal plain. KR 14c. Angled-in ledge rim Stratum IVB: Pl. 85:10 Stratum IV: Pis. 2:19; 9:16(7); 12:5(?)-6(?) Strata IV-III: PL 10:14-16 Stratum III: PL 27:11 Flat-topped ledge rim, angling rather sharply inwards; outer rim often tapering. Several rims are somewhat rounded (e.g. PL 9:16). Pis. 10:14 and 27:11 may be earlier, intrusive sherds, as they were found in fills. PL 85:10 has a slight groove under the rim exterior. 63</page><page sequence="72">More than the others, the rim and general body shape of this subtype recall Late Bronze Age and Iron Age I kraters (Amiran 1969: PL 41:9; Qasile II : 45-47; ' Izbet Sartah : Fig. 13:1, 3, Stratum III; Tim- nah III: KR 1). There appear to be few parallels for this rim shape in the 10th century, when red slip and irregular burnish are prominent on this type: Gezer III: PL 7:20 (Stratum X-IX); PL 11:6 (Stratum VIII); Qasile II: Fig. 53:13-14 (Stratum IX); Izbet Sartah: Fig. 22:21 (Stratum I). KR 14d. Small bulbous or hammer-head rim Stratum IVB: Pis. 4:4-6; 9:6 Stratum IV: Pis. 7:15; 9:17; 84:15 Stratum IVA: PL 6:10 Under this type we have assembled krater rims that are less prominent and thickened than that of KR 14b, though the form is similar (either bulbous or hammer-head). A few of the rims included in Krater Type 1 at Tell Qasile are similar to this type: Qasile II: Fig. 16:8 (Stratum XII); Fig. 29:24-25 (Stratum XI); Fig. 47:3 (Stratum X). This supports the affinity noted between KR 14c and 14d, as derivatives of Iron Age I krater rim shapes (see a similarly shaped krater: in Masos II: PL 135:4, Strata III/II). At Tell Qasile, similar krater rims continue to appear in 10th century con- texts (Qasile II: Fig. 53:4-5, Stratum IX). The dark red slip and hand burnish differentiate the Stratum IX kraters from the earlier ones at this site. In 10th-9th century contexts, similar rim types may be found at a few sites in the Negev: Beer-sheba II: Fig. 21:13 (Stratum VII); Fig. 27:4-6 (Stratum VI); Arad (M. Aharoni 1981: Fig. 6:17, Stratum XI). KR 14e. Thickened, squared rim Strata V-IV: PL 100:9 Stratum IVB: Pl. 4:1 Stratum IVA: PL 6:11 Strata IV-III: PL 10:20 Stratum III: PL 103:17(?) A flat-topped, shelf-like rim, with a squat, square outer profile. This is a rare rim type, and the exam- ples included in this subtype (e.g. Pis. 4:1, 6:11 and 10:20) differ somewhat from one another in details. Only the examples presented in the plates were registered with this type. This is an exclusively Stratum IV rim shape; Pl. 103:17 appears to be a stray sherd in a later context. 64 Summary: KR 14 Kraters with thickened hammer-head rims begin in the Iron Age I; this feature becomes one of the characteristics of early Iron Age II kraters (Amiran 1969: 216). This type is also distinguished by its relatively massive nature and surface treatment: 75% of the items at Tel Batash have thick, dark red slip and irregular hand burnish inside and outside, while another ca. 10% have such a treatment only inside or only outside. The fact that no complete profile was found at Tel Batash is characteristic of the fragmentary state of the finds in Stratum IV in general. This krater type is equivalent to Tell Qasile' s Krater Type 4, the "hallmark of Strata IX-VIII," which does not appear in earlier levels {Qasile II: 47). The red-slipped and hand-burnished "large bowls" from Lachish Levels V-IV cited above show that this type continues into the 9th century as well, though Tufnell claimed that it does not postdate 900 BCE {Lachish III: 269). Moreover, no vessels of this type were found in Locus 4421 at Lachish, which Zimhoni dated to the late 9th-mid-8th centuries (Zimhoni 1997: 156). There is a difference between two groups of subtypes, KR 14a-b and KR 14c-d. The latter are a clear continuation of typical Iron Age I kraters, like our KR 3 and Tell Qasile Krater 1. As opposed to this, KR 14a-b began to appear in the late 11th or early 10th century at sites like Tel Masos Stratum II, 'Izbet Sartah Stratum II and Tell Qasile Stratum IX. Thus, KR 14a-b serve as one of the prime indicators of Stratum IV, while KR 14c-d provide a link with the previous Iron Age I. A relationship between these kraters and the thickened-rim kraters that develop in Stratum III (KR 6, KR 35, as well as the larger fol- ded-rim bowls with handles; see discussion of our BL 13) may be suggested. This development is marked not only by morphological modifications, but also by the change of dark red to light red or self slip mainly inside, and the transition from irregular hand burnish to wheel or ring burnish as well. The spatial distribution of this type (in shape and surface treatment alike) appears to be concentrated mainly in the Shephelah, the Judean hills and the Negev, with some appearances along the coast. Thus, the predominance in the 10th century of this krater at Tel Batash Stratum IV links the site to the Judean and southern spheres, as well as pointing to a certain coastal affinity.</page><page sequence="73">KR 18a. Kraters with flaring rim Stratum IVB: Pis. 85:9; 100:8 Stratum IV: Pis. 7:20; 11:15; 85:22 Strata IV-III: Pl. 10:13 Medium-sized to large kraters (diameter ca. 20-27 cm; PI. 100:8 is smaller, 18.5 cm in diameter) with a round carination at mid-body (though in most cases only the rims were preserved) and sides rising above to an everted rim with a round or tapering top. Most examples are red-slipped and hand-burnished inside and outside. The simple, unthickened rim and flaring upper stance of KR 18a, for which no definite par- allels were found,10 suggest that this type is a local variant related to the generic type of KR 14. It may be related to an Iron Age I krater type found in Stratum V ( Timnah III : KR 4). KR 18b. Closed kraters with everted shelf rim Stratum IVB: Pl. 2:21 Stratum IV: Pis. 7:23; 12:7 Stratum IVA: Pis. 6:13-14; 9:9 Narrow-mouthed kraters (neck diameter 17.5-21.5 cm; Pis. 12:7 and 6:13 are larger variants, 26-28 cm in diameter) with a flat shelf-like rim top, protruding outside. Since no complete examples were preserved, the body stance and base form are unknown. This sub-type was rare. This subtype was set apart by its relatively narrow mouth (almost like a storage jar) and horizontal shelf rim, though some examples are somewhat similar to the rims of KR 14b (e.g. PI. 12:7) or KR 14a (e.g. PI. 6: 13). The lack of dark red slip and irregular burnish, so typical of the kraters in Stratum IV, also con- tributed to the separation of this type. The lack of parallels suggests that this too is a local product. KR 1 8a-b 20 -ļ 10 0 . 1 IV III II Krater 17.

The base is unknown, as no complete profiles were preserved. 72% are red-slip- ped inside and outside, while 5% are red-slipped inside and partly outside. Over 50% of these have irregular and horizontal hand burnish inside and outside. Though there is an affinity in surface treatment and provenience with the generic Stratum IV krater (KR 14, see above), KR 17 differs in its thinner walls and unthickened rim. Parallels may perhaps be found at 'Izbet Sartah : Figs. 14:21; 16:5 (Stratum II); Fig. 20:12 (Stratum I); however their rim is out-turned and they may be somewhat earlier. Compare also Qasile II: Fig. 53:1-2 (Stratum IX, defined as bowls). The paucity of comparisons at other sites may imply this type too was a local variant of the Stratum IV pottery industry.

A medium-sized to large closed krater (diameter ca. 25-35 cm) with rounded sides and an incurving rim. The rim top is round or truncated. The rim exterior is multi-ridged or single-ridged. Several truncated rims with a slightly hammer-head stance (e.g. Pis. 15:1 and 25:1) were included in the main type on the basis of these indicative ridges. The only preserved base is a ring base. In Stratum IV, 11 sherds of this type were registered; however, several were found in insecure stratigraphie contexts (e.g. PI. 7:24), and this does not appear to have been an authentic Stratum IV type. In Stratum III, this type reaches the peak of its frequency. Only one of these was red-slipped, but not burnished. All of the five Stratum II examples reg- istered are from poor stratigraphie contexts, or their typological assignation is insecure. Thus, KR 20 should not be considered an authentic Stratum II type. This krater, which is most frequent in Stratum III, appears to be the forerunner of KR 11, the common krater of Stratum II. It is a clear departure from the typical thick-rimmed and handled kraters of Stratum IV. This is true of the surface treatment as well: the globular kraters of Stratum III lack the red slip and hand burnish so characteristic of the Stratum IV kraters. The feature of ridges below the rim exterior is considered an early Iron Age II trait, and its appearance on this krater marks one of its latest expressions at Tel Batash; in Stratum III it is also found on a few bowls and jugs (see discussion of BL 26, above). Note that at Ashdod, the ridged exterior of bowl and krater rims is considered a common characteristic of the 8th century assemblage, though it begins there earlier {Ashdod I: 110, 135). This type is rare outside Tel Batash and very few close parallels were found. Similar forms were occasionally found at Ashdod, though most of them are smaller and thus were defined as bowls; their body is somewhat more symmetrically rounded than our KR 20, which tend to be more "swollen" in the upper part {Ashdod IV: Fig. 7:11-12, Stratum X; 66 Fig. 10: 13, Stratum IX; Fig. 39:26, Stratum VIII). A vessel from Stratum VIA at Gezer {Gezer III : PI. 20:3, Bowl Type 48; discussion ibid.: 166-167) has an affinity to the general morphology of KR 20, though it is smaller, with a single groove and exterior wheel burnish. Compare also a krater from Tel 'Eton {'Eton: Fig. 2:5, Stratum II, slightly thickened rim, no ridges, more rounded body). Thus, this type does not appear to continue into the 7th century and is limited to the Shephelah and the southern coastal plain. While some of the Tel Batash examples were found in the destruction debris of Stratum III, others came from early Stratum III contexts (e.g. PL 15:15, makeup under a Stratum III floor), implying that the type perhaps began to appear early in Stratum III. The affinity between KR 20 and KR 11 (see below) should be noted. Though KR 20 has a squatter body and lacks the typical pronounced hammer-head rim of KR 11, the two appear to have developed together as a novel vessel concept. Per- haps KR 20 was considered a more delicate vessel used for some household function, while KR 11 played a role in olive oil production (see p. 67). The few examples of KR 20 with a small hammer-head rim represent an additional possible link between the two types (see especially Pis. 25:1 and 57:20). KR 11a. Deep closed globular kraters with hammer- head rim (Photo 25) Stratum III: Pis. 15:4-7, 9(?); 25:4; 27:17 Stratum IIIA: Pis. 90:14(7); 91:24 Stratum II: Pis. 33:1, 3-5, 7(?); 42:3-8; 54:23(7), 24(7); 57:19; 58:19; 60:12; 65:5; 72:1-2; 94:16; 96:13; 102:10, 12; 104:8-9 Medium-sized, deep, closed kraters (diameter ca. 22.5-25 cm). The rim is hammer-headed with tapering edges, angling inwards. The deep, globular body terminates in a nicely made ring base. Some kraters have a short shoulder below the rim exterior (e.g. Pis. 25:4; 42:6, 96:13). All lack slip or burnish and most lack handles.</page><page sequence="75">Photo 25. KR lia (PL 72:1). Scale 1:6. These kraters begin in Stratum III, when they are somewhat smaller and, since no complete examples were preserved, the shapes of their body and base are unknown; the sloping or globular sides appear to be similar to the stance of those in Stratum II. This is by far the most common krater in Stratum II; fourteen restored examples from the houses of Stratum II provide a prime sample of complete kraters of this type. Their capacity ranges between 9 and 12.5 liters. Only two sherds of this krater type in Stratum III bore traces of red slip without burnish. While this krater already began to appear in the late 8th century, it became very popular at Tel Batash (and Tel Miqne) in the 7th-early 6th centuries, where it was one of the hallmarks of the regional pottery assemblage (Gitin 1989a: Fig. 2.13:15; 34, Photo 2.8, where four examples can be seen, all from Stratum IB; see also Mesad Hashavyahu: Fig. 5:8). The shape of this krater possibly answered a certain functional need, perhaps related to the olive oil production industry centered in this region. A few of these kraters have holes drilled in the upper body (e.g. PI. 96:3) or near the base (e.g. PI. 72:1), most likely for separating the olive oil from water during the manufacturing process. If indeed there is a rela- tionship between this industry and this krater type, it is interesting to note that KR 11 already constitutes about 25% of the kraters in Stratum III, though the olive presses at Tel Batash are attributed to Stratum II. This may imply that this industry began as early as late Stratum III at Tel Batash. Only a few examples of such kraters were found outside the Tel Miqne-Tel Batash region: a few rim sherds at Gezer (Gezer III : PI. 28:2, 5, Stratum VA) and a few examples at Ashdod, though they are not a common type there, and unlike the kraters from Tel Miqne and Tel Batash, in several cases they are slipped and burnished {Ashdod I: Fig. 36:6; Ashdod //-///: Fig. 47:4-5; Ashdod IV: Fig. 14:12). These examples from Ashdod are ascribed to an 8th century level, contemporary with our Stratum III. KR lib. Deep globular kraters with flaring rim Stratum III: PL 15:3(?) Stratum II: Pis. 33:2; 65:6; 94:15 This subtype is smaller (ca. 16.5 cm) and some- what less globular than KR 11a. It has an elongated, flaring rim, which in effect forms a very short neck, instead of the hammer-head rim of KR 11a. The rim top is tapering. Like KR 11a, KR lib sometimes has a short shoulder. Note the linburnished red slip out- side and on the inner rim, as well as the traces of a horizontal painted black line on the exterior of PL 15:3, which recalls the contemporary pottery indus- try at Ashdod. This type is very similar to KR 11a, and the two should be considered together in terms of distribution and function; the low frequency of KR lib merely reflects the fact that it is no more than a variation (see Mesad Hashavyahu : Fig. 5:9 for a similar neck). The shape of the neck and rim recalls the deep tall kraters with a high foot found in the "House of the Bullae" in Area G in the City of David, Jerusalem (Shiloh 1985: 77, Fig. 6:2-3), though the latter vessels differ in their overall shape and highly polished surface treatment. KR 11c. Squat globular kraters with vertical neck Stratum II: PL 33:6 This subtype was included with the globular- bodied kraters, though it has features that set it apart. It is smaller and more squat, and has a vertical neck with a protruding ridge at its bottom; the rim top is plain or slightly bulbous; the base is a low disc; and the vessel is undecorated. The capacity of the single complete example (Pl. 33:6) is 3 liters. 67</page><page sequence="76">KR Ile 3 -i 0 -I JĒĒĒĒĒĒĒĒĒĒĒĒĒ^^^Ē^^^ IV III II No clear parallels were found for this subtype. There is perhaps some morphological affinity with the so-called necked "large bowls" or kraters (e.g. Ashdod /: Fig. 37:18, Stratum VIII; Jerusalem, Ophel: PL 26:5-6, see also parallels for KR 8, below).

KR 6 30 1 20 - 0 -I IV III II Short rounded rim sherds that appear to have belonged to a wide-mouthed, closed krater (diameter ca. 22.5-28 cm). Though they bear a certain resem- blance to the folded-rim bowls typical of the 8th-7th centuries (see discussion of our BL 13 and Qitmit : 214, Fig. 4.2:30-31, where similar rims were com- pared to the four-handled folded-rim bowls), they have a deeper and more closed stance. However, the definition of this type is not secure, since it is based only on small rim and upper body fragments. This group of sherds exemplifies the difficulties of rim typology: during registration it was often difficult to distinguish rims of this type from the comparable rims of other, more completely known types (such as KR 14, KR 35). Thus, only short rims that differed 68 from the rims of other types were included in this type. This ambiguity resulted in a dilemma in deter- mining parallels, since the rim affiliation may not be a sufficient factor. The following analogies may be considered: Zimhoni 1997: Fig. 3.32 (large bowls of Type B-27 from Lachish Levels V-IV, none slipped or burnished); Jerusalem , Ophel : PL 13:13-14, Locus 87/264 (defined as bowls); PL 18:23, Locus 86/80, 8th-7th centuries; Tel 'Ira: Fig. 6.67:11 (Stratum VI); Ashdod I: Figs. 36:9; 42:1 (Stratum VIII); ' Ajrud : Fig. 6:2; Tel Sera': Fig. 11:21 (Stratum D6); Sa'idiyeh : Fig. 8:9 (Stratum VI); Fig. 12:1 (Stratum V). These analogies provide a wide chro- nological range in the Iron Age II, mostly post- 10th century. One of the factors that differentiated this type from KR 35 (apart from the shorter rim) was the fact that the sherds registered as KR 6 were slipped (20- 24% red slip in Strata III-II and 12% self slip in Stratum III) and wheel-burnished, while most examples of KR 35 lacked such treatment. Moreover, the preserved sherds ascribed to KR 6 generally had no handles, while KR 35 was multi-handled. The rounded rim apparently continues the tradi- tion of the thickened-rim kraters so common in Judah, the coast and the Negev in the 10th century (see our KR 14). Further development included the decrease or disappearance of handles, as well as the transition from dark red slip and irregular hand burnish inside and outside to lighter red or self slip and wheel burnish inside and on the rim exterior. On KR 6 (like the thickened-rim bowls characteristic of the 8th-7th centuries, see BL 13), the rounded, thickened rim is folded outwards, rather than pro- truding inside and outside like in the Stratum IV kraters. Large, deep, multi-handled "krater-jars": KR 35a-d Large, deep vessels, averaging 50-60 cm high and 25 cm in rim diameter, which combine features of kraters and storage jars and thus can be defined as "krater-jars." In most publications, such vessels are designated "storage jars" (Aharoni and Aharoni 1976: 83). Gitin ( Gezer III : 49) defined them as "holemouth jars." Another designation is "barrel- kraters." Their large capacity indicates a storage function. This type is sparsely represented in Stratum III and is only slightly more frequent in Stratum II.</page><page sequence="77">However, the possibility that some of the rims reg- istered with KR 6 may have belonged to this vessel type should be considered. These kraters appear in a variety of rim and body shapes that prompted a division into four subtypes. KR 35a. Rounded rims Stratum III: Pis. 15:10; 21:3(7), 4(?), 6 (?), 7-9; 25:5- 6; 29:17; 92:3 Stratum II: PI. 58:24 Only rim sherds were registered with this type, as no complete profiles were preserved. All these rims were found in Stratum III contexts except for one, PI. 58:24, which comes from a Stratum II street surface that also included some Stratum III material. Thus, this should basically be considered a Stratum III type. The rounded rims are folded and elongated, usually slightly angled out, though some are hori- zontal with almost vertical sides. A handle was preserved in only one case (PI. 92:3). The inclusion of these rims with the krater-jars, despite the fact that no body was found and their seeming resemblance to other rim types (such as KR 6), was based mainly on their affinity to rims of similar contemporary complete vessels, e.g. from Beer-sheba Strata VI-II, Tell Beit Mirsim Stratum A, Lachish Levels IV-III, Arad Strata X-VIII, Tel 'Ira Strata VII-VI (see the references in the discussion below). KR 35b (Photo 26) Stratum II: Pis. 36:3-4; 45:14; 67:8; 73:4; 97:3 This exclusively Stratum II subtype includes six complete examples. The rim shape is slightly sloping and convex, creating a kind of "step." The four- ridged handles extend from the bottom of this step. The body is swollen at its lower third, and has a small ring base; the bases of Pis. 67:8 and 97:3 have a concave center. PI. 45:14 is drawn with two han- dles, but apparently originally had four; its base is missing. PL 73:4 has a short "neck" and unique rim Photo 26. KR 35b (PL 97:3). Scale 1:6. (similar to that of KR 11a, see below) but was included with this subtype due to other similarities. PL 97:3 has a somewhat more elongated body. This concave rim shape is unique to Tel Batash, as is the rim shape of Pl. 73:4, and does not appear elsewhere. KR 35c (Photo 27) Stratum III: Pl. 28:7 Pl. 28:7 is the only representative of this subtype. Its pronounced hammer-head rim greatly protrudes outwards. The four loop handles extend down from two ridges on the upper part of the body. The base is a relatively wide convex flat base. The rim and upper part of the vessel has a self slip and vertical and horizontal shiny burnish lines. It is 55 cm tall and the diameter of the opening is wider than in the other subtypes (32.5 cm); the body is 49 cm wide at its widest point. The capacity of this vessel is 69 liters. This krater was found in Locus E619 of Stratum HIB, which belongs to an early phase of this level ( Timnah /: 197). No exact parallels were found for this vessel, though there is a similarity between its profile and those of the multi-handled kraters found in Iron Age II (see a partial list in note 12), where the handles are attached to a ridge well below the rim exterior and the rim is thickened. 69</page><page sequence="78">Photo 27.

Scale 1:6. 70 KR 35d (Photo 28) Stratum II: Pl. 47:5 This singular vessel has a rounded, horizontal shelf-like rim protruding inwards and four loop handles extending from the rim top to a slight ridge somewhat below the rim exterior. The extension of the handles from the rim top is rare; for an identical stance, see Ashdod IV : Fig. 16:7 (Stratum VIII). The capacity of our vessel is 85 liters. Summary: KR 35 The concept of KR 35 (deep containers with small bases, "holemouth" openings and four handles) is well known in Iron Age II pottery assemblages. There are, however, variations in body proportions and rims, which apparently have chronological as well as possible regional implications. Such vessels are well known in Judah, where they initially appear in limited numbers in 10th and 9th century contexts and are more common in the 8th- 7th centuries (Aharoni and Aharoni 1976: 83). Selected examples are: Lachish III : PI. 95:490, 492 (Tufriell's Class S. 10, squatter proportions, Levels III- II); PI. 95:491 (Tufriell's Class S. 9, elongated proportions, Level II); Zimhoni 1990: Fig. 19:1-3, 5 (Level III, Group IIIF), with three ridges at join to handle; Fig. 31:5 (Level II), ridged rim top similar to that of S J 10c, narrower body;11 TBM III: PI. 13:4 (Stratum A); Khirbet Rabud (Kochavi 1973: PI. 4:15), rims like KR 35a; ' Eton : Fig. 2:9 (Stratum II). At Beer-sheba, vessels that recall our type in general body and handle shape, start to appear as early as Stratum VI ( Beer-sheba II : Fig. 29:5; see also Beer- sheba /: PI. 55:20, Stratum IV, narrow body). They were a common container in Beer-sheba Stratum II, where 13 complete examples of varying proportions were published ( Beer-sheba /: Pis. 58:33-36; 65:1-4, 7; 71:18; 73:6-8). Compare also Arad: Fig. 13:3 (Stratum X); Fig. 19:3 (Stratum IX); Fig. 22:21 (Stratum VIII). Note that at Arad, no such vessels are published from Strata VII-VI. All the Beer-sheba and Arad rims are like our KR 35a. See also Aroer : Fig. 8:3 (Stratum III); Fig. 16:6 (Strata II- I); Qitmit: Fig. 4.3:19; Tel ' Ira : Figs. 6.75:2; 6.81:8; 6.88:19 (Strata VII-VI). ' Ajrud : Fig. 6:9-10 is the upper part and base of what appears to be a similar vessel; its rim is reminiscent of KR 35c. Pétrographie analysis of a sherd from this kind of jar indicated a southern Shephelah or northern Negev origin (ibid.: 156). At coastal sites, similar vessels are not common.</page><page sequence="79">Two jars from Ashdod Stratum XB ( Ashdod IV: Fig. 4:1-3) mark the appearance of such containers in the early 10th century, though they differ from ours in several details, recalling our PL 29:17. Later exam- ples from Stratum VIII include Ashdod //-///: Fig. 51:8. For a krater from Tel Miqne, see p. 74. Several parallels can be found at northern sites, despite certain morphological variations, for exam- ple: Samaria III : PL 21:13-17 (Period VI), rim fragments only; Megiddo I: PL 17:84 (Strata IV-III); the vessel's base is made of three loop handles; Pl. 18:89 (Strata IV-III), multi-handled; Hazor III-IV: Pl. CLXXXVI: 1 (Stratum VI). A deep-bodied krater with four handles was found in a 10th-9th century level at Tel Rehov. It appears that the northern examples are evidence of local production and their relationship to the Judean kraters is unclear, due to their different proportions and morphological details. Most of the 8th century parallels have thickened rims like our KR 35a, though the handles are placed like those of our KR 35c (on one or more ridges below the rim exterior). The stepped "concave" rim of our KR 35b, as well as the configuration of han- dles extending from the rim top in KR 35d, appear to be unique to our site and probably represent local variations, as well as being a chronological indicator, since these traits appear only in our Stratum II. The 7th century parallels (e.g. Lachish Level II, En-Gedi Stratum V, Aroer Stratum II, Tel 'Ira Strata VII-VI and Qitmit) are vessels with a similar concept, though there is wider variation of morphological details in these vessels than in the 8th century examples. The four-handled holemouth krater-jars appa- rently developed from the Iron Age I multi-handled kraters with six or more handles (Aharoni and Aharoni: 83; Amiran 1969: 223; Masos II : Pis. 132:7; 143:8; 150:6-7, Strata III-II). Multi-handled kraters existed alongside the four-handled kraters in the Iron Age II, and their rather limited appearance may be regarded as a functional response to partic- ular industrial (or other) needs (see KR 30 below).12 On the other hand, the concept of four handles is well known on Judean forms other than the krater-jars, such as the Judean LMLK storage jars, "rosette" storage jars and large folded-rim bowls or kraters, and thus should be considered a known feature of the Judean pottery repertoire of the 8th-7th centuries. At Tel Batash, most of these kraters were found in domestic contexts, while one (PL 45:14) was found in Building 950, the Oil Press Building. Necked Kraters : KR 8, KR 10, KR 13 KR 8. Kraters with vertical neck Stratum III: Pis. 15:l(?)-2(?); 25:8; 91:22(?) Stratum II: Pis. 32:12(7); 55:14; 57:13; 61:6; 63:10; 65:7; 94:13 Kraters with a wide, short neck that is vertical or sometimes slightly splayed, rising above rounded shoulders. The only complete profile, PL 65:7, shows a rounded, rather stout body and a ring base. The rim top is tapering, rounded or truncated. Some have two loop handles extending from the rim top to the shoulder. In Stratum II, as in Stratum III, they are medium-sized (diameter ca. 20.5-27 cm; PL 55:14 is narrower, 18 cm in diameter). PL 63:10 has a few burnish lines outside. This type may be defined as an "amphora" krater (Amiran 1969: 223). Vessels of the same general shape and concept are mainly found in 8th-7th coastal contexts. Necked kraters were quite common at Ashdod {Ashdod II-III: 95). The shapes also include long-necked and thicker-rimmed versions, mostly decorated in the "Ashdod Ware" tradition ( Ashdod IV: Fig. 7:13-14, Stratum X; Ashdod I: Fig. 36:13, Stratum IX); kraters of the same general shape but with horizontal handles appear in Strata VIII-VII {Ashdod II-III: Fig. 37:20; see the horizontal-handled krater in our PL 94:14, below; Ashdod IV: Figs. 13:19; 20:2). The burial urns at Ruqeish {Ruqeish Graves: Figs. 3:R15; 4:R20) recall the general shape of KR 8, though their highly burnished finish and decoration (and suggested function) set them apart. Kraters of the same general shape were also used as urns in the Phoenician cemetery at Achziv (unpub- lished), and deep kraters with a vertical neck are known at Tell Keisan {Keisan PL 28:9, Stratum 4; PL 44:1, Stratum 5). In Judah, necked kraters are rare. Two kraters with neck shapes similar to PL 63:10, but with larger bodies and lacking handles, come from Lachish 71</page><page sequence="80">(Zimhoni 1990: Fig. 31:1, Level II) and En-Gedi ( En-Gedi : Fig. 15:12, Stratum V). A very small kráter from the Ophel in Jerusalem has a neck of exactly the same shape, though narrower {Jerusalem, Ophel : PI. 15:8, Locus 86/78, lower floor; PI. 26:5- 7). Two necked kraters come from Cave I in the City of David ( Jerusalem IV: Fig. 17:2). See also Beer- sheba I: PI. 72:14 (Stratum II, defined as a bowl) and Sa'idiyeh : Fig. 8:3 (Stratum VI; see our PI. 61:6). It thus appears that necked kraters are more at home at coastal sites such as Ruqeish and Ashdod, where they have a long tradition from the 10th century onwards. Variations of necked kraters con- tinue into the Persian period (see PI. 76:8-9 and p. 186 below). KR 10. Necked kraters with stepped rim exterior Stratum III: PI. 15:17-18 Strata III-II: PI. 57:4(7), 7 Stratum II: PI. 59:5 Small kraters (diameter 17 cm) with a very short neck and stepped rim exterior. The shoulders are rounded or sloping; no further part of the body has been preserved. Traces of handles extend from the rim top. PI. 57:4 is larger. Since the only example from Stratum II comes from a street that also con- tained Stratum III material, this may be considered an exclusively Stratum III type. These kraters may be considered together with the category of necked kraters discussed above (KR 8). The stepped rim exterior recalls that of CP 7, which is the most common cooking pot in Stratum III (see below). In some cases, it was only the ware that differentiated the two. Thus, this type may be a local variation related to the production of these cooking pots. The facts that no kraters of this type bore any red slip or burnish, and that their manufacture is coarser than that of the other necked kraters at our site, may indicate their more utilitarian purpose in food preparation. 72 Few clear parallels were found for this krater. Several rims from Gezer are similar ( Gezer III : PI. 15:6, Stratum VI; PI. 24:17-18, Stratum V; PI. 15:6). KR 13. Kraters with short neck and ridged body (Photo 29) Stratum II: PI. 33:9 Photo 29. KR 13 (Pl. 33:9). Scale 1:4. Medium-sized kraters (diameter ca. 22.5 cm) with a short, vertical "neck" above sloping sides that descend to a round carination just below mid-body. The sloping sides are ridged at even intervals. The rim top is a horizontal shelf, grooved on the exterior. No base was preserved. Two small loop handles terminating in a knob extend from the bottom of the neck to the carination. The vessel is red-slipped and continuously burnished to a polish outside, giving the vessel a "metallic" look and suggesting a metal prototype. In addition to the single example in the plates, three sherds of similar vessels were registered in Stratum II. These were undecorated. Both the details of shape and the surface treat- ment set this vessel apart; it was apparently more a luxury than a utilitarian vessel. No close parallels were found. Assorted Deep Kraters: KR 12, KR 25, KR 30 KR 12. Deep kraters with triangular rim (Photo 30) Stratum II: Pis. 33:8; 55:10; 60:11; 72:3 Stratum I: Pis. 76:10; 77:13</page><page sequence="81">Photo 30. KR 12 (Pl. 72:3). Scale 1:6. Medium-sized to large deep kraters (diameter ca. 22.5-30 cm) with straight, somewhat sloping sides above a bulging lower body. The rim exterior is folded over to a point, forming a triangular section. Two horizontal loop handles extend from the rim top to the sloping upper sides. The only base preserved is a high ring base, somewhat similar to that of KR 11. PL 60:11, which is wider than the others, has knobs on the top of the handles, possibly imitating a metal vessel. All examples are undecorated. This is a very infrequent type, represented only by the six examples appearing in the plates The only comparable vessels to these kraters were found at Ashdod Strata VIII-VII ( Ashdod IV: Figs. 16:6; 20:3-5; 26:13, with rounded base). Though they were defined as "deep bowls," the excavators of Ashdod suggested that they served as cooking ves- sels (ibid.: 35), based on the rim shape and traces of burning, and perhaps the rounded base found on one example. A similar rim shape, though shorter, may be found on some necked cooking pots at the very end of the Iron Age and continuing into the Persian period (see below, our CP 13). Thus it is possible that KR 12 was introduced from the coastal site of Ashdod, where it began to appear in slightly earlier contexts. KR 25. Large deep kraters (Photo 31) Stratum II: Pl. 43:1 Photo 31. KR 25 (PI. 43:1). Scale 1:6. A large deep krater (diameter 41 cm; capacity 35 liters), with a rounded lower body and straight sides above rising to a folded-over, rounded rim exterior. Four loop handles extend from the rim top below the fold. The base is a high ring base. This is a rare type at Tel Batash: besides the complete example, only two additional sherds were attributed to it. No par- allels were found. The vessel demonstrates hybrid characteristics: the general stance, which is reminis- cent of KR 12, the folded rim, which is typical of bowls of this period (our BL 13), the deep rounded body and nicely made ring base, which can be found on the globular kraters (our KR 11) and the four handles, a trait common on the deep kraters of this stratum (our KR 35). The single complete example (Pl. 43:1) was found in Building 950, the Oil Press Building, along with several complete examples of KR 1 1 and the large KR 30 (PL 47:9, see below). It perhaps had a fiinc- 73</page><page sequence="82">tion in the production, collection or distribution of the oil and was specifically manufactured for such a purpose. KR 30. Large deep kraters with tall neck (Photo 32) Stratum II: Pis. 47:9; 49:7; 94:18(?) Photo 32. KR 30 (PL 47:9). Scale 1:7. PI. 47:9 is a distinctive large vessel (height 75 cm) incorporating a large globular body, with a wide straight neck rising above it to a thick, folded-over rim exterior. There are ridges at the connection between the lower and upper parts; the two parts were made separately and the ridges emphasize their 74 join. The body is asymmetrical and the exterior is coarse. Seven loop handles extended from below the lower rim, close to the connection between body and neck; four of them are preserved. The thick disc base is small in proportion to the body. The capacity of this vessel is 85 liters up to the straight neck. Two other fragmentary kraters possibly belong to this type. In PL 49:7, the beginning erf an elongated neck rising above a rounded body resembles PL 47:9; however, the body shape is more sloping and no handles were preserved at the join between the two parts. PL 94:18 is very similar to the top part of PL 47:9, and thus is believed to belong to the same type. Pl. 47:9 was found in Building 950, the Oil Press Building, and may perhaps have been related to the oil industry. The rim and neck fragment Pl. 94:18 was also found in a building containing an oil press (Building H959). In this context, the multi-handled kraters from Tel Miqne Stratum IB found in relation to the oil presses should be mentioned, though they lack the elongated upper part, and the handles are along the rim of the large, open container (Gitin 1995: 66, Fig. 4.6:3). As suggested above (see the discussion of KR 35), the multi-handled large kraters of Tel Miqne and Tel Batash probably had an industrial function related to the production of olive oil. The only comparable vessel is a large krater from Ashdod ( Ashdod IV: Fig. 31:1), with a similar (though reconstructed) body and an apparent total of eight handles located at the top of the body, below the tall neck. The rim has a thickened, rounded exterior impressed all around with circles (a similar motif is found on vessels in the Persian period; Stern 1982: 133). The upper part, termed a "funnel," is similar to KR 30. This vessel was found in fragments above the level of the last gate, and its proposed use was a water container {Ashdod IV: 49-50). KR 36. Kraters with horizontal handles (Photos 33- 34) Stratum II: Pis. 72:4; 94:14</page><page sequence="83">Photo 33. KR 36 (PL 72:4). Scale 1:6. Photo 34. KR 36 (Pl. 94:14). Scale 1:6. The common trait of these two kraters is their horizontal handles. PI. 72:4 is a large open krater (rim diameter 36 cm) with slightly rounded sides and a truncated interior rim. The two horizontal handles are located below a groove under the rim exterior. The base is a wide, low disc base. PI. 94:14 is much smaller (diameter 19 cm; in essence, it could be defined as a bowl), with rounded sides and a somewhat narrower "neck" above a slight ridge. The rim top is tapering. Two knobs located near both ends of the handles probably imitate metal nails. The base was not preserved. The krater is red- slipped and continuously burnished inside and out- side; together with the groove and the knobs, the vessel has a metallic look and is perhaps derived from a metal prototype (like KR 12 and KR 13). These two vessels are unique in our corpus. Horizontal handles, which are common in Iron Age I, appear only sporadically in late Iron Age II. How- ever, no close comparisons were found for Pl. 72:4. Pl. 94:14 can be compared to several red-slipped and burnished kraters with horizontal handles flanked by knobs, from 9th-7th century contexts at Ashdod (Ashdod IV: Fig. 10:12, Stratum IX; Fig. 13:19, Stratum VIII). See also Ashdod //-///: Figs. 37:20, 22; 40:6-7; 54:1; 59:17; Ashdod IV: Fig. 20:2 (Strata VIII-VI). Similar handles appear on kraters at Ruqeish ( Ruqeish : 51, Nos. 6-7; Ruqeish Graves: Fig. 2:R9). At Beer-sheba, several kraters from Stratum II with a wide range of forms also have horizontal handles {Beer-sheba I: Pis. 69:2; 75:1-5). In the discussion of these kraters (ibid.: 38-42), Bachi pointed out their resemblance to Cypro- Phoenician forms (e.g. two kraters from Locus E207 at Samaria: Samaria III: Fig. 20:7-8), while Geva (1985) related them to East Greek forms. Note also a very similar configuration of handles and knobs on a deeper plain krater from Tel 'Ira, Stratum VII (Tel 4 Ira : 200, Fig. 6.82:5). 13 Some of the vessels from Ashdod cited above are definitely inspired by East Greek shapes (particularly Ashdod IV: Fig. 13:19). Since East Greek pottery was found at both Tel Miqne and Tel Batash (Magness, pp. 141-144 in this volume; Waldbaum and Magness 1997), it is possi- ble that imported Greek vessels inspired local potters in this region. Varia The following are sherds of vessels that could not be classified according to the above typological scheme. Stratum IVB Pl. 1:8. The shape of this fragment is that of a large bowl; it has a rounded body and thickened hammer- head rim with a slight groove on top. The rim shape recalls that of KR 14a, but the body shape and lack of the red slip that is so typical of KR 14a set this sherd apart. It may be related to BL 73 of Stratum V (see Timnah III). PL 3:1. A fragment of a large krater (diameter 40 cm) recalling the rim stance of KR 14b. This is a multi- handled krater: three handles are preserved ca. 6.5 cm from one another, so that at least six handles may be reconstructed. Locus D706, where this fragment was found, is a pebble floor attributed to Stratum IVB, since it was found under a Stratum IV floor and above Stratum V debris. On the appearance of multi- handled kraters in Iron Age II, see the selected ref- erences in note 12 (relating to the discussion of KR 35). 75</page><page sequence="84">Stratum IVA and Stratum IV Pl. 6:8. A fragment of a thick, round-sided, open vessel with a round-topped hammer-head rim; its large diameter (32.5 cm) assigns it to the category of kraters, despite its bowl-like stance. Compare to Pis. 1:8, 11:13 and 86:9-10. Pl. 7:22. A small fragment of a wide, very short straight neck (diameter 26 cm; 1.5 cm long) and the beginning of rounded shoulders. The exterior and neck interior are red-slipped, with a black horizontal band painted on the rim exterior and shoulder top, a decoration typical of "Ashdod Ware." PI. 8:1. A fragment of a large thick- walled vessel with a very large diameter (47.5 cm). The rim is a flat-topped shelf with a protruding exterior; below the rim exterior is a ridge from which a handle extends to the top of a narrow, sloping shoulder. Though two handles are reconstructed in the draw- ing, it may possibly have had more, which would assign it to the multi-handled type (see above, PI. 3:1 and note 12). Note the relationship to KR 35c, though it is much coarser. PI. 11:13. A fragment of a large round-sided open vessel (diameter 33 cm). The sides are relatively thin and the round-topped hammer-head rim angles slightly outwards. Compare to Pis. 1:8, 6:8 and 86:9- 10. Pis. 83:19; 85:14. The thickened flaring rims and short neck of closed, thick-walled heavy vessels. The stance suggests that they came from deep kraters, but they may have come from pithoi as well. PI. 85:23. A small fragment of a wide, inverted neck (diameter 24 cm) with a slightly rounded rim top angling somewhat outwards. It is made of rather coarse ware, and may possibly have come from a cooking pot of undetermined type. Its stance is somewhat reminiscent of KR 17. PI. 86:9-10. Small rim and body sherds of thick, hemispherical vessels with a round-topped rim pro- truding outside and angled in. See also Pis. 1:8, 6:8 and 11:13. 76 Stratum III PI. 89:10. A fragment of a wide straight, slightly thickened concave neck (lower neck 32.5 cm in diameter) with a small, flat-topped rim. PI. 89:16 is similar but smaller (25 cm in diameter). Though the ware is atypical, these might belong to cooking pots. Stratum II PI. 55:6. This small fragment is unique. It has the short, almost "neckless" stance of SJ 7b (see below) and short, rounded shoulders. However, its very wide neck (diameter 24.5 cm) categorizes it as a krater, despite its affinity to S J 7b and S J 15. It is perhaps a variant of types like KR lib and KR35b. PI. 61:4. A fragment of a thick- walled krater or deep bowl (diameter 25.5 cm) with a straight neck that flares on top; the rim top is flat and widened. There are traces of a handle on the neck, suggesting a necked, amphora-like krater. PI. 65:8. A fragment of a large thick-walled krater (diameter 31 cm) with straight, inturned sides ter- minating in a flat-topped hammer-head rim, the top angling in. It may be a variant of KR 35. PL 94:17. A fragment of a thin- walled krater (rim diameter unknown) with a small round-topped hammer-head rim and gently rounded sides, with a slight ridge above mid-body. AMPHORAE Our definition of amphorae included several tall vessels with narrow necks and two handles extending from the rim to the body. Several krater types answer to this description as well.

Large vessels with a round swollen body and relatively short, wide straight neck (43.5 cm high; rim diameter 14.5 cm). The rim exterior has a slight ridge. Two loop handles extend from the rim to the shoulder. The base is a wide ring base. The body is particularly thin in relation to the large size of the vessel, evidence of high-quality workmanship. PI. 28:9 was found in Locus E619, which can be attributed to an early phase of Stratum III ( Timnah /: 197). PI. 17: 13 is the upper part of what appears to be a similar vessel, though its rim is different. The only parallel for this vessel is a burial urn from Ruqeish ( Ruqeish Graves : Fig. 2:R7); though its rim is slightly different, its proportions are very similar. The pottery from the graves at Ruqeish is 78 dated by Culican generally to the 9th century (ibid.: 99). However, Hestrin and Dayagi-Mendels prefer a later date, the last quarter of the 8th to the 7th cen- turies ( Ruqeish : 56). The earlier date is more suited to the context of the Tel Batash amphorae. The shape was perhaps influenced by Phoenician forms (com- pare Amiran 1969: 217). AM 7. Medium-sized amphorae with tall neck (Photo 36) Stratum III: PI. 22:18(7), 20 Photo 36. AM 7 (PI. 22:20). Scale 1:5. Medium-sized vessels with an ovoid body and tall, straight neck; the thickened rim exterior is pointed. Two loop handles extend from the middle of the neck to the sloping shoulders. The only complete example, PI. 2:20 (diameter 8.5 cm; 27 cm high), has a wide ring base. It was found intact on a lime floor in Unit 780. Note a certain similarity to AM 5, though its size and specific proportions set AM 7 apart. The rim and neck fragment in PI. 22:18 appears very similar, and was thus included with this type.</page><page sequence="87">A very close comparison is Sa'idiyeh : Fig. 5:4 (Stratum VII), while additional parallels suggested are somewhat stouter: Megiddo I: PI. 19:105 (Stra- tum V); PL 9:30 (Stratum III). See also a vessel with similar proportions, though a different rim, from Tell el-Far' ah (N) Stratum Vild (Tell el-Far* ah I: PL 46:8). A similar vessel from Beer-sheba Stratum IV was defined as a jug (Beer-sheba /: Pl. 55:13). A similarly shaped amphora from Beth Shemesh should be mentioned, though its rim is more similar to that of AM 5 (Beth Shemesh III : Pl. XXI:33-4- 152, Iron Age I = Amiran 1969: Photo 243). Some of these comparisons are painted or slipped, while our amphora is plain. AM 3. Amphora with narrow ridged neck (Photo 37) Stratum II: Pl. 49:6 Photo 37. AM 3 (PL 49:6). Scale 1:5. This is the single example of its type found at Tel Batash. It has a tall, ovoid body with a long narrow neck, ridged in its center. The rim is everted. Two loop handles extend from the ridge to the sloping shoulder. The base is a fine ring base. This vessel was found in the destruction debris on the floor of Building 950; note its general resemblance to JG 18 in PL 49:5. A jug from Kuntillet 'Ajrud, which is cited as a parallel for the latter jug (below, p. 116), may also be suggested as a comparison for AM 3, as it is extremely similar, except for its single handle ('Ajrud: Fig. 14:4). The resemblance of the neck and rim to the typical southern decanters of the late Iron Age is marked (see discussion of our JG 14). This similarity suggests that the addition of an "extra" handle to a known vessel shape was probably related to its specific function or to the inclination of the particular potter, rather than a standard typological characteristic. The upper part of this vessel closely recalls the shape of the "Gibeon Jars," sherds of which bearing inscriptions were found in the fill of the circular water shaft at Gibeon (Pritchard 1959: 12-16, PL 6:1-7). Pritchard concluded that these jars contained wine produced at the wineries of Gibeon, and were meant for export. In an attempt to explore the origin of the "Gibeon Jars," Amiran (1975) pointed out some similarities to early Iron Age II amphorae from Megiddo Stratum V (Megiddo I: Pis. 19:107; 22:129; Megiddo II: Pl. 89:1-2), as well as from Stratum III at Beth Shemesh (Beth Shemesh I: Pl. XII: 1672 = Amiran 1975: Fig. 2:2), though these have much wider necks. An example closer in time is an amphora from Megiddo Strata III-II (Megiddo I: Pl. 10:39). Amiran maintains that the 8th-7th century development of this jar was influenced by the neck of the water decanter (ibid.: 132). Comparison may also be made to the shape of a large amphora from Tell Keisan, Stratum 5 (Keisan: Pl. 44:2), though it has a wider neck. In any case, this vessel type remains quite rare, and our amphora is the closest complete parallel to the "Gibeon Jars," of which only sherds are known. AM 5. Amphorae with wide neck and ridged rim exterior (Photo 38) Stratum II: Pis. 32:11(7); 48:6; 55:11; 68:1 Large vessels with an ovoid body and convex ring base. The collar-like rim is slightly ridged and ends in a protruding ridge above mid-neck. Pl. 55:11 has a 79</page><page sequence="88">Photo 38. AM 5 (Pl. 68:1). Scale 1:5. slight ridge at mid-neck. Two ridged loop handles extend from the middle of the smooth, long, wide neck. PL 68:1 is the only complete example; PL 32:11, a rim sherd, may belong to this type. Very few comparisons were found for this shape. The burial urns from Ruqeish have less swollen bodies, but are generally similar (e.g. Ruqeish Graves'. Fig. 3:R13, R14, R17). A very similar rim and neck, though only one handle is depicted, was found in Stratum VII at Ashdod ( Ashdod II : Fig. 56:27). A much smaller vessel from Ashdod Stratum VII, defined as an "amphoriskos" ( Ashdod IV: Fig. 21:10), has a similar shape. While our vessels lack slip or burnish, the Ashdod vessels are red-slipped and painted in black or white. This vessel is a table rather than a transport amphora. The distribution of the parallels points to a coastal origin for this amphora. 80 COOKING POTS CP 4. Open cooking pots with triangular rim exterior Strata V-IVB: Pl. 79:13 Stratum IV: Pis. 11:5; 82:24 Medium-sized to large open cooking pots (diam- eter ca. 22.5-28.5 cm) with a short vertical neck (though occasionally it is slightly inverted). The rim exterior is an overhanging triangle, usually with a rounded top (though some are truncated) and sharp point. The exterior of the triangle is often concave. Since only rim fragments were preserved, the body shape is unknown and it is difficult to determine the location of the body carination and the presence or absence of handles. This cooking pot, which is found in relatively small quantities in Stratum IV, continues a type common in the Iron Age I Stratum V at Tel Batash. This might indicate continuity between the end of Iron Age I Stratum V and the beginning of Stratum IV. However, considering the fragmentary nature of the finds, it is possible that some of the sherds are intrusive from earlier levels. There are numerous parallels to this rim type at a wide range of sites in Iron Age I levels in both the north and south of the country (Amiran 1969: 227, PL 75-76; Qasile II: 52, note 73). It appears that in general the triangular outer rim is somewhat smaller and flatter in Stratum IV than in the previous level. However, at Tell Qasile, the opposite phenomenon was noticed: the rims in Strata X-IX are longer than those in Strata XII-XI {Qasile IL 53). The following are selected comparisons of this rim shape at various sites in levels contemporary with Stratum IV: Beth Shemesh : Pl. LXIL45 (Stratum II); Qasile II: Fig. 54:20-21 (Stratum VIII); Mevor- akh: Fig. 14 (Stratum VII); Fig. 20:6 (Stratum VIII); Taanach: Fig. 18:7 (Stratum ILA); Fig. 70:6 (Stratum III); Kinneret: Pl. 57:5-10 (Stratum V).

CP 20. Shallow, open cooking pots with wide short vertical neck Stratum V: PI. 79:5 Stratum IV: PI. 82:21 Shallow open cooking pots with a short vertical or very slightly concave neck and a plain, round-topped rim. The rim diameter is ca. 30 cm. Two loop handles extend from the rim to the soft carination on the upper body (none were preserved below this point). This type is very uncommon at Tel Batash, rep- resented by only three examples. It appears to be equivalent to Zimhoni's Type CP-1 at Lachish; these were the most common cooking pots at Lachish during Levels V-IV (Zimhoni 1997: Fig. 3.37); they do not continue into Level III. Similar cooking pots were found at Beth Shemesh (ibid.: 122). Cooking pots with similar rim and stance were found at sites in the Negev, such as Beer-sheba II: Fig. 18:1 (Stratum IX); Arad (M. Aharoni 1981: Fig. 2:15, Stratum XII); Masos II : PI. 137:3 (Stratum II); Esdar. Fig. 14:1 (Stratum III). Thus, this cooking pot type appears in the Negev and the Judean Shephelah during the 10th-9th centuries. CP 15. Shallow, open cooking pots with inverted, pushed-out rim (Photo 39) Stratum V: PL 79:4 Strata V-IVB: PL 79:12, 14 Stratum IVB: Pis. 4:7-9, 11, 13; 85:12 Stratum IV: Pis. 8:3; 9:10; 12:14, 19(7); 80:21; 82:25; 83:20; 85:24; 86:2, 5(?) Medium-sized to large shallow cooking pots (diameter ca. 27.5-35 cm) with a pushed-out rim interior, forming a rounded convex exterior. The rim stance is inverted. The rim top is usually round, but may also be truncated. The stance slopes out from Photo 39. CP 15. Scale 1:5. 81</page><page sequence="90">Fig. 5. Iron Age II typology: cooking pots. 82</page><page sequence="91">below the rim to the carination above mid-body (very rarely preserved). Two loop handles extend from the rim top to the carination. This is by far the most common cooking pot in Stratum IV (together with its subtype, CP 15a). It constitutes a development of a type found in Iron Age I Stratum V at Tel Batash, suggesting chrono- logical proximity (see Timnah III : CP 15). Similar rims on Iron Age I cooking pots are Qasile II : 53, Cooking Pot Type Id and Izbet Sartah : Figs. 15:8, 13; 18:19 (a few in Stratum III, more in Stratum II and the most in Stratum I; see ibid.: Fig. 20:17, 19 and discussion, ibid.: 66-68). The Iron Age I exam- ples lack handles. This type is somewhat similar to some examples from Lachish included in Zimhoni's Type CP-6 (e.g. Zimhoni 1997: Fig. 3.43:6), which were found only in Level V. There may also be a relationship between some of the thicker examples of our CP 15 (e.g. PL 80:22) and Zimhoni's Type CP-7, dated at Lachish exclusively to Level IV (ibid.: 127 and Fig. 3.43), though she claimed that there is no affinity between her Types CP-6 and CP-7. At Gezer, this rim type appears in lOth-early 9th century strata ( Gezer IV: 121, PL 43:7-9, Strata IX- VIII; Gezer III ē. PL 5:26, Stratum IX). Gitin has shown that they were common during the 10th cen- tury and became dominant during the 9th century throughout the country, but did not continue beyond this time {Gezer III : 212-214). The type was particularly popular in the Negev in late 1 1th- 10th century contexts; see, for example, Masos II : PL 150:4 (Stratum II); M. Aharoni 1981: Fig. 2:14 (Arad Stratum XII); Beer-sheba II : Fig. 18:4-5 (Stratum IX); Fig. 22:1 (Stratum VII); Fig. 28:6 (Stratum VI; the latter is somewhat shorter than most of the examples in our type and perhaps dem- onstrates a development from the concave rim of CP 15 to the pinched, almost vertical rim of our CP 7, see below). This type is also the dominant cooking pot in the Negev highland sites (Cohen 1986: PL 157:4, 6, 11, 12).14 Thus, the appearance of this type in considerable quantities in our Stratum IV demonstrates continuity from Iron Age I, as well as affinity with Judean and Negev sites at this time. CP 15a. Shallow, open cooking pots with vertical pushed-out rim Stratum IVB: Pl. 4:10, 12 Stratum IV: Pis. 8:2; 84:17(7); 100:18 Strata IV-III: Pl. 1 1 :4(?) The rim shape of this subtype is similar to the main type and only its stance is different: the rim is relatively vertical and the body carination is gen- erally slightly lower. Most of the examples are somewhat smaller, ca. 26-30 cm in diameter. It should be noted that the differentiation between the main type and this subtype was not always clear, and the rim stance apparently lacks chronological or regional significance. CP 7.

CP 7 (PI. 28:8). Scale 1:5. 83</page><page sequence="92">Medium-sized to large shallow cooking pots (diameter ca. 22.5-42 cm) with a stepped rim top or exterior. The rim top is either rounded or truncated. Two loop handles rise from the rim top and extend down to just above the body carination. While the most common stance is open, with sloping shoulders descending to a round carination at or just above mid-body, some have a narrower neck, forming a more closed stance. The base is round. The capacity of the one pot that could be measured (PL 28:8) is 10 liters. Twelve small sherds were registered as CP 7 in Stratum IV. All come from loci in Area H that, though attributed to this stratum, are not securely sealed contexts. Since these are small rim sherds, their propensity to shift is greater. Typologically, among these sherds, there are two main variations, both somewhat different from the stepped rim exte- rior that develops fully in Stratum III: one is a thickened inverted rim with a shallow groove on the upper interior, while the other has a slightly deeper groove on the upper exterior. These may perhaps be compared to Gitin's cooking pot Types 103 and 104, both of which he dates to the second half of the 9th- early to mid-8th century, claiming that they are the antecedents of the fully developed stepped-rim cooking pot, his Type 105 {Gezer III: 216-217). The earliest appearances of this type at several sites tend to corroborate a mid to late 9th century date for its initial appearance, e.g. ' Eton : Figs. 3:11; 5:12-13 (Strata II- I). Such a cooking pot appears in Level IV at Lachish (Lachish V : Fig. 44:5), though its context should be dated to the 8th century (see p. 183, note 4). Zimhoni concurs that the prototypes of this type indeed appear in Lachish Level IV but "differ from the later versions in rim morphology and fabric" ('i Eton: 72). Cooking pots from Beer-sheba Stratum VI may also demonstrate a development from the triangular rims with concave interior (our CP 15) of the Iron Age I and 10th century to the stepped, vertical rim of CP 7 (see Beer-sheba II: Fig. 28:1, 6). A similar process is described at Taanach, where it is claimed that these pots initially appear early in Iron Age II ( Taanach I: 66-67). Such a develop- ment could also be observed in the new excavations at Beth Shean (Area P, in preparation for pub- lication). Thus, the few Stratum IV examples of CP 7, if they are indeed considered stratigraphically reliable, suggest a gradual development at our site, as at the sites mentioned above: an early version of this type appears in small quantities and is some- 84 what different from the fully developed type, which is the hallmark of our Stratum III and contemporary sites. Indeed, the type is well known in 8th century levels throughout the country. Examples are: Lachish III: Pl. 93:441-442 (Level III); Beth Shemesh IV: Pl. LXrV:20-25 (Stratum II); TBM III: PL 19:1-4 (Stra- tum A; note Albright's claim that they may already have begun in late Stratum B: ibid.: 150); Jerusalem II: Fig. 2.16:1 (Phase 2c, dated by Franken and Steiner to the end of the 9th-beginning of the 8th centuries); Jerusalem IV: Fig. 18 (Cave I);15 Beer- sheba I: Pis. 56:13; 60:78-80 (Strata III- II); Arad: Fig. 12:8 (Stratum X); Fig. 18:5 (Stratum IX); Fig. 22:7 (Stratum VIII; the appearance of this type in Strata X-VIII at Arad indicates the longevity of this type and the homogeneity of these strata); Aroer: Fig. 7:4-5 (Stratum III);16 Gezer III: 217-218, Type 105, Pl. 22:2-3, 5 (Stratum VI); Samaria III: Fig. 6:39-40 (Period IV); Figs. 9:18; 10:26-27 (Period VI); Tell el-Far'ah I: Pl. 53:4-8 (mostly from Stra- tum Vild); Marjameh: 108, Fig. 20:4-11, 8th cen- tury; Hazor I: Pis. LH: 11; LV6-10 (Strata VI-V). This type of cooking pot, in four different sizes, is the most common at Kuntillet 'Ajrud, which can be dated to about 800 BCE {'Ajrud: Fig. 6:5-6). 17 The seven small sherds from Stratum II are stray sherds from insecure contexts. Thus, this cooking pot may be viewed as an indicator of the 8th century at Tel Batash, while taking into account a possible initial appearance in Stratum IV and virtually no continuation into the 7th century.

No complete examples were preserved at Tel Batash, though the globular body and round base are well known from other sites. This type is found only in Stratum III. The innovative narrow-necked cooking pot begins to appear no earlier than the 8th century in the south (Amiran 1969: 227-228; Lachish III : PI. 93:452- 456). 18 It is not included among the cooking pots presented by Zimhoni from Lachish Levels V-IV. At Gezer this cooking pot is represented by Gitin's Types 110 and 111, the latter more similar to our examples. Gitin dated these types to the mid-8th to mid-7th centuries ( Gezer III : 223-224). This type coexists with the popular open, stepped- rim cooking pot (our CP 7) during the 8th century. While CP 7 is common throughout the country, CP 8 is limited to Judean sites, such as Lachish Level III; Tell Beit Mirsim Stratum A; Beth Shemesh Stratum II; Jerusalem Ophel, Locus 6015; Jerusalem Caves I- II (though these are thicker, with a straight or slightly concave neck); 'Eton Tombs; Beer-sheba Strata III- II; Arad X-VIII; Aroer Stratum III. A few similar examples were found at coastal sites (Ashdod II-III: Figs. 37:23; 40:9, 11, Stratum VIII; Qasile II : Fig. 56:16, "Stratum VII"). This cooking pot virtually disappears during the 7th century, when it is replaced by CP 9 (see below); the few examples attributed to the latter part of this century are small sherds that may have originated in earlier strata.19 This type joins the other Judean types found in Stratum III at Tel Batash. However, this cooking pot is very scarce at our site in contrast to the large amounts of other Judean types (e.g. the LMLK jars). CP 9. Deep, globular cooking pots with narrow, single-ridged neck (Photo 42, three vessels on right) Strata III-II: PI. 103:19 Stratum II: Pis. 34:1-7; 44:5; 58:21; 60:16; 65:12; 96:7-8 Small to medium-sized deep, closed cooking pots (diameter ca. 7.5-10 cm) with one sharp ridge in the center of the straight, narrow neck. The rim flares out above the ridge and the rim top is usually tapered, though sometimes thickened. The relatively thin- walled body is globular, either elongated or squat, and the base round. Two loop handles extend from the rim top to the sloping shoulder. There is wide variability in the size of these cooking pots, from 15 cm to 22 cm in height, which is reflected in the wide range of capacities (Table 35, p. 182): 0.5 liter (PI. 96:8), 0.8 liter (PI. 65:12, measured to neck), 2.5 liters (PL 44:5), 3.5 liters (PL 96:7), 5.2 liters (Pl. 34:4). Several examples (e.g. Pis. 60:16; 58:21; 103:19) have very fine ridging above the one sharp protruding ridge. Twelve complete or restorable examples were found in the destruction layer of houses of Stratum II. The single example attributed to an earlier context (PL 103:19) was a small sherd found in a mixed makeup of the Stratum II piazza and thus perhaps belonging to its construction phase. This is the second most popular cooking pot, after CP 11, in Stratum II. It clearly developed from CP 8 and is considered the hallmark of the late 7th century in Judah (Amiran 1969: 232; Aharoni and Aharoni 1976: 76, 86; Gezer III: 223). Indeed, this type is found only at Judean sites in contexts generally late in the Iron Age II sequence, e.g. Shiloh 1985: Fig. 6:16 (City of David); Lachish V: Pl. 47: 21 (Level II); En-Gedi: Fig. 17:1-5 (Stratum V); Arad: Fig. 25:5; 24, Fig. 25:7; 28, Fig. 29: 6 (Strata VII-VI ); Aroer: 268, Fig. 16:3-4 (Stratum II, though with variations in the rim form); Tel 'Ira: 217, Table 6.19 (Stratum VI); Masos II: PL 165:1^; Qitmit: Figs. 4.3:33; 4.11:28. This type is not found outside Judah, even at nearby Gezer and Tel Miqne. It marks Tel Batash as the westernmost border of distribution for this Judean type and emphasizes the Judean connections 85</page><page sequence="94">Photo 42. CP 9 and CP 10 from Building 743 (PL 34). of our site (in contrast to Tel Miqne) during the late 7th century. The popularity of this Judean shape in Stratum II in contrast with the scarcity of CP 8 in Stratum III suggests a closer affinity with Judean pottery production centers in the 7th century than in the 8th. CP 10. Open-mouthed cooking pots with pinched rim exterior (Photo 42, three vessels on left) Stratum III: PI. 103:18(?) Stratum II: Pis. 34:8, 10(?), 12; 43:2-7; 55:2(?); 65:11; 72:5; 96:14; 104:11 86 Medium-sized deep closed cooking pots (diameter ca. 15 cm; PI. 34:8 is an exceptionally small exam- ple) with a wide, short or medium neck, which is straight or sometimes slightly flaring. Below the rim exterior is a sharply protruding pinched ridge, which creates a step. The body, with relatively thin walls, is bag-shaped, bulging below mid-body; the base is round. Most are relatively squat (the considerably deeper PI. 34:10 is a variation). Two loop handles extend from the rim top to below the join of the neck to the body. PI. 55:2 is included on grounds of its sharply protruding rim exterior, but differs in neck stance. This is the third most popular cooking pot in Stratum II (after CP 1 1 and CP 9 respectively). The only sherd found in an earlier context (PI. 103:18) is typologically doubtful. Seven complete pots of this type from the houses of Stratum II were restored. The capacity of these cooking pots ranged from 5 liters (PI. 43:6) to 9 liters (PI. 43:2); PI. 34:8 is excep- tionally small, with a capacity of only 0.7 liter.</page><page sequence="95">This type is characteristic of the pottery industry of Tel Batash, Tel Miqne and Mesad Hashavyahu in the 7th century (Gitin 1989a: 44, Fig. 2.13:13; Gitin 1995: 68, Fig. 4.9:1-2; Mesad Hashavyahu : Fig. 5:4), and is not common outside this limited region. Of very similar shape is a cooking pot found below the foundations of the "Sun Temple" at Lachish ( Lachish V: PL 51:13). It was erroneously dated by Aharoni to the Persian period, prompting him to date the temple to the Hellenistic period. This would be the only example of this type to reach the Judean Shephelah. Several examples were found at Ashdod (e.g. Ashdod IV : Fig. 20:6, Stratum VII) and at late Iron Age II sites in the northern Negev, e.g. Aroer: 261, Fig. 10:6 (Stratum II); Tel Ira : 218 (Stratum VI); Masos II: Pl. 165:10-13 (Iron Age II); Qitmit: Fig. 4.6:21. This emphasizes the relationship between this region and the coast in the late Iron Age II following the destruction of Beer-sheba Stratum II (Singer- Avitz 1999: 58). Several vessels from Beer-sheba Stratum II ( Beer- sheba I: Pis. 61:87-88; 66:11; 69:4; 71:15) are probably forerunners of our type. They have dis- tinctive angular bottoms but similar rims. Since the form is missing from other late 8th century contexts in Judah, its appearance in Beer-sheba Stratum II may point to connections between Beer-sheba and the coast in this period (Singer- Avitz 1999: 53- 54). CP 11. Closed cooking pots with everted rim (Photo 43) Stratum II: Pis. 34:9; 44:1; 55:3; 58:22(7); 60:13-15; 65:13-14; 72:7-9; 95:2; 96:9-10; 102:15 Stratum ILA: PL 63:2 Small to medium-sized deep, closed cooking pots (neck diameter 9.5-13 cm) whose everted, shelf-like rim forms a very short neck. The rim interior is Photo 43. CP 11 (Pl. 96:10). Scale 1:5. generally angled and the rim top is rounded, tapered or grooved. The globular body, usually with rela- tively thin "metallic" walls, has a round base. Two loop handles extend from the rim top to the sloping shoulder. This type was the most popular in Stratum II at Tel Batash. Eight complete or almost complete ves- sels were restored. The size variation is large and the capacity ranges from 1.6 liters (Pl. 65:13) to 5.8 liters (Pl. 44:1). This cooking pot is considered one of the hall- marks of the late 7th-early 6th centuries in Judah (Amiran 1969: 232; Aharoni and Aharoni 1976: 86; Gezer III : 219-221). Aharoni maintained that this type, his CP 100 at Lachish, replaced the stepped-rim cooking pot (our CP 7) in the latter part of the 7th century, "and its presence or absence from Judean Iron Age II sites serves as a distinct chronological tool" ( Lachish V: 15). Like CP 9, it has a mainly Judean distribution at sites such as Lachish Level II; Ramat Rahel Stratum V; Jerusalem and its vicinity; Gibeon, the Iron Age II winery; En-Gedi Stratum V; H. Shilhah; Arad Strata VII-VI; Masos, Iron Age II; Aroer Stratum II; Qitmit; and Tel 'Ira Stratum VI. However, it is found at a few sites outside Judah, such as Gezer Stratum V ( Gezer III: Pl. 27:11-14, Type 106); Tel Miqne Stratum IB (Gitin 1989a: 44, Fig. 2.13: 12); and Mesad Hashavyahu ( Mesad Hashavyahu: Fig. 5:1-3). The popularity of this type in Stratum II at Tel Batash, and its presence at Tel Miqne, point to an affinity between the Judean pottery industry of the 7th century and the regional pottery industry of northern Philistia. The question of whether such cooking pots were produced simultaneously in both these regions, or were imported from Judah to Phil- istia, remains open. 87</page><page sequence="96">CP 12.

Small to medium-sized deep cooking pots (neck diameter 11.5-17 cm) whose short, vertical neck sometimes has a concave interior, terminating in a rounded rim top. The neck may be wide (PL 34:11) or narrower (PL 44:4), and has a kind of "collar" at its base. The body is globular, usually bulging below mid-body (PL 44:4); the base is round. Two loop handles extend from the rim top to the sloping shoulders. This relatively uncommon type, which lacks par- allels, is apparently a local product that may be regarded as a variation of CP 10. CP 13. Deep cooking pots with short neck and short triangular rim Stratum II: PL 44:2 88 Medium-sized deep cooking pots (neck diameter 15 cm) with a short slightly flaring neck and a short triangular rim exterior. The shoulders slope to almost straight sides; the body is not preserved below this point. Two loop handles extend from the rim top to the end of the sloping shoulder. This is a very rare shape at Tel Batash: only four sherds were registered as belonging to this type, all from Stratum II con- texts. The few parallels found point to a Persian period date and a coastal distribution ( Tel Michal : Fig. 9.1:14, Stratum XI; Abu Hawam : Fig. 6, Stratum II). This contradiction remains unexplained. Varia The following are sherds of cooking pots that could not be incorporated in the type series. Stratum IV PL 80:19. A rim and neck fragment with a slightly inverted stance; the rim exterior is concave and its bottom is marked with a pronounced ridge. Some of the rims included in Zimhoni's Type CP-3, from Levels V-IV at Lachish, are similar (e.g. Zimhoni 1997: Fig. 3.39). PI. 80:22. A fragment of a large (diameter 35 cm), thick, pushed-out rounded rim, with a slight groove on the upper exterior; it may be considered a variant of CP 15 (see Ashdod IV: Fig. 3:3). Pis. 81:1; 29:16. Two rims belonging to a medium- sized closed cooking pot (diameter ca. 18-19.5 cm) with a round, bulbous rim top. The shape of the body is unknown; PL 8 1 : 1 has no neck, while PL 29: 1 6 has a short neck. The latter comes from a All that has mixed Strata IV and III material. The small thickened rim recalls that of some of the kraters of Stratum IV (e.g. KR 14d), but the ware of these two sherds is</page><page sequence="97">typically that of cooking pots. There is a certain resemblance to Gitin's Type 103B ( Gezer III : PL 22:1, Stratum VI; see our Pl. 29:16), which Gitin dates to the second half of the 9th-third quarter of the 8th centuries. Gitin claims that this type is the fore- runner of the typical 8th century stepped-rim cooking pot (our CP 7), though the two coexisted as well (ibid.: 216-217). Pl. 81:2. A vertical short neck with a rounded rim exterior, possibly a variation of CP 15. Pl. 82:22. A small rim sherd of a cooking pot with a short narrow concave neck. The rim resembles that of our CP 12 (above; see also Qasile II : 53, Type 2, Fig. 26:11, Stratum XI), but its small dimensions and narrow neck set it apart. The neck seems too short for it to be a "cooking jug". Stratum III PI. 23:13. A short, relatively narrow neck (2 cm long; diameter 21.5 cm) with a flat rim top and a ridge at the join with the shoulder. The round shoulders slope and no handles were preserved. Suggested parallels to the rim form indicate an Iron Age I or 10th century date {Qasile II : Fig. 40:15, Stratum X; 'Izbet Sartah : Fig. 24:12, Stratum I) and thus it may be a stray sherd. However, it may also be a variation of CP 7. PI. 92:4. A small, thick rim fragment, truncated and angling in on top, tapering to a point at the bottom of the rim exterior. Stratum II PI. 102:11. A small fragment of an everted rim with a very slight groove on its interior; the shape and ware of this sherd indicate that it is an intrusive Middle Bronze Age form. PI. 104:12. A small fragment of a finely ridged flaring neck with a tapering rim top, made of the reddish-brown metallic ware typical of 7th century cooking pots. It is possibly related to CP 9, but much more delicate. STORAGE JARS Straight-necked, Plain-rimmed Storage Jars: SJ 21a-c, SJ 29 SJ 21a.

The neck averages 2.5-3.5 cm long, with a diameter of ca. 10 cm. It is thick- walled, with an everted, round-topped rim that is sometimes thickened. This is a very frequent type in Stratum IV. In Stratum III, 15 examples were registered with this type. However, the fragmentary nature of this mate- rial implies that a certain portion of the latter were probably intrusive, stray sherds (e.g. Pl. 90:15), or were typologically misattributed. SJ 21b.

In some cases, the neck is slightly inver- ted. PI. 1:15 shows the beginning of a short, rounded shoulder. Like the previous subtype, this was very frequent in Stratum IV and negligible in Stratum III. Discussion of SJ 21a-b Subtypes a and b of S J 21 represent 90% of all storage jars in Stratum IV; in fact, the rest of the jar types registered in Stratum IV are mostly sundry sherds found in insecure contexts. Neither of these two subtypes could be restored in its complete form, reflecting the general nature of the finds in this stratum. It can be assumed that storage jar handles (e.g. PI. 1:22) and bases (e.g. Pis. 1:17 and 84:22) belong to such jars. The nuances that distinguish between the two subtypes appear to lack chrono- logical or regional significance. Complete jars with the neck and rim of our SJ 21 (especially subtype S J 21a) were found at Tell Qasile, Tel Esdar and Tel Masos in late 11th century or early 10th century contexts. These jars are medium-sized and have rounded shoulders with a slight carination and an elongated ovoid body. The base is rounded and the handles are rounded loops extending from the shoulder to the body. We assume that our jars looked like this as well. This type continues a shape that was common in Iron Age I at Tel Batash (Stratum V), as well as at other sites, such as Beth Shemesh IV: Pl. LXI: 5-7 (Stratum III); Ashdod IV: Figs. 3:16-18; 9:1-3 (Stratum Xa); Masos II: PI. 133:13 (Stratum III); PI. 137:12 (Stratum II); Esdar: 31, Fig. 13:1-9; Beer- sheba II: Fig. 19:1-3 (Stratum IX); Fig. 23:1-2 (Stratum VII); Gezer III: Fig. 5:2-3, 10-11 (Stratum XI); Izbet Sartah: Fig. 13:7 (Stratum III); Fig. 19:14 (Stratum II silo); Qasile II: 54-56, Figs. 23:23; 26:13 (Stratum XI); Fig. 47:10 (Stratum X); Keisan: Pis. 59:1-6; 60:1-3 (Stratum 9). Jars of this type continued to be common at many 10th-9th century sites, for example Lachish (Zim- honi 1997: Figs. 3.46; 3.50, Levels V-IV); Beth Shemesh IV: Pl. LXIL41-42 (Stratum IIa); Gezer III: Pis. 8:2; 9:1-2 (Stratum VIII); Izbet Sartah: 87-88, Figs. 20:7-10; 21:6 (Stratum I); Arad (M. Aharoni 1981: Figs. 3:10; 4:1, Strata XII-XI); Qasile II: Fig. 52:11 (Stratum IX); Fig. 54:23 (Stratum VIII); Tel Michal: Fig. 7.2:11 (Strata XIV-XIII); Samaria III: Fig. 1:17-18 (Period I). In the north, such jars con- tinue to appear at Tell Keisan until Stratum 7 {Kei- san: PI. 50:1-3, 7). At Megiddo and Hazor they are 92 not common {Megiddo I: PI. 21:122, Stratum V; Hazor III-IV: PI. CLXXIX:12, Stratum IXA). At Tell Qasile, these were the most common storage jars found in Strata IX-VIII (SJ 1), and were interpreted as evidence for "early traditions" in the 10th century assemblage {Qasile II: 56). This may possibly be true of Stratum IV at Tel Batash as well, in which no other significant storage jar type was found, suggesting close continuity in storage jar forms between Strata V and IV. S J 21a-b represent 22% of the storage jars in Stratum III. Examination of the loci from which these sherds originate shows that half are fills con- taining mixed Strata IV and III material (such as E618 and E703) or relatively insecure loci (such as D801 and D802, debris under a Stratum III floor). The remaining sherds that do come from secure Stratum III contexts are all from loci other than Building 737, destroyed in the late 8th century. This suggests that these jars are early in the Stratum III sequence. Thus, this type of storage jar has its roots in the 11th century, appearing along the coast, as well as in the Shephelah and the northern Negev. It continues into the 10th-9th and early 8th centuries in these regions, with a limited representation at several northern sites. SJ 21c. Thin-walled, inverted neck Stratum IV: Pis. 81:9-10; 83:2, 21; 86:12(?) Only the five sherds presented in the plates were attributed to this subtype; these have thinner walls than the other subtypes of S J 21 and the neck is somewhat inverted (4-5 cm long, ca. 10 cm in diameter), with a thickened or slightly everted rim top. The general shape is reminiscent of the LMLK storage jars (see SJ 8 below). It is possible that these rims, found in Stratum IV contexts in Area H, are forerunners of the LMLK jars, though the scanty nature of the finds makes this tentative.</page><page sequence="101">The small number of these rims made it difficult to determine analogies. It seems that the sherds presented by Zimhoni as Type SJ-7 from Levels V- IV at Lachish are similar to ours (Zimhoni 1997: Fig. 3.52). It is interesting to note that not only is the shape similar, but these were made of the same dis- tinctive clay as the LMLK jars.20 However, Zimhoni cautioned against assuming too close an affinity between these and the later LMLK jars before further study is carried out at other sites (ibid.: 136-138). Of the five sherds in our group, three are made of this kind of ware (Pis. 81:9-10 and 83:21). However, in light of their small size, it is possible that they were intrusive or stray sherds. The current excavations at Tel Safit and Tel Beth Shemesh have revealed evi- dence for the appearance of "LMLK-Yikď jars, albeit made of different clay, in 9th century contexts. Thus, the question of longevity of production as opposed to the emergency function of the LMLK storage jars should be re-examined (Zimhoni 1990: 18 and see below, discussion of SJ 8). SJ 29. Jars with straight neck and short oval body (Photo 45) Stratum II: PI. 67:7 This is a medium-sized jar (ca. 45 cm high; rim diameter ca. 9 cm) with rounded, sloping shoulders and a short, oval body terminating in a tapering, rounded base. The neck is long and straight, with a slightly rounded rim. Two loop handles extend from below the shoulder. Aside from the single whole example from Building F608, only three sherds from Stratum II were registered with this type. No close parallels could be found for this type. A jar from Level III at Lachish has a certain resem- blance in its upper body stance and general pro- portions, but has a more swollen body and somewhat shorter neck (Zimhoni 1990: Fig. 17:2).

LMLK jars (Photo 46) Stratum III: Pis. 16:1-9; 17:1-6; 18:1-3; 101:13 Stratum II: Pis. 35:1-3; 46:1, 3-4, 6-7, 9-10 Stamped handles: PI. 19:1-7 (Stratum III); Pis. 51:12; 59:15-16; 61:13 (Stratum II) This type is the typical LMLK jar (Tufnell's Type 484; Aharoni's Type 180, Zimhoni's Group IIIA, Gitin's Type 4A): a large storage jar (ca. 60-65 cm high; maximum diameter of body 42 cm; neck diameter ca. 10 cm) with broad, gently sloping shoulders and an ovoid body terminating in a nar- rowing, rounded base. The neck is inverted or almost straight. The rounded rim top is either plain or slightly thickened. Four ridged loop handles are located just below the shoulder; some of them bear stamps (see below, pp. 191-197). Most of these jars are relatively thin-walled and made of a distinctive 93</page><page sequence="102">Photo 46. SJ 8 (Pl. 18:1). Scale 1:6. fabric, a dark reddish-brown clay with many small white lime inclusions, fired at a high temperature that gave the vessel a metallic quality (our FG 9; see pp. 18-19). The distinctive fabric of LMLK jars is easily recognizable even for a body sherd. Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) conclusively demonstrated that jars of this type from Tel Batash were made of clay from the same source as LMLK jars analyzed from other sites throughout Judah. This clay was identified as typical of the northern Shep- helah (Mommsen et al. 1984). Note, however, that four of the stamped handles included with this type are of visibly different ware.21 Though most of the jars are of similar shape, there are variations in form: note PL 17:4-5, in which the upper part of the body is straighter than in the regular form, PL 16:3, which was distorted during firing, and PL 16:8, which is asymmetrical. PL 16:5, 6 and 9 have a slight ridge along the shoulder, above the zone where the handles are attached. This recalls a similar feature found in Zimhoni's Storage Jar Group HIB, "LMLK- like" jars (Zimhoni 1990: 19-23). However, at Tel Batash these jars were made of the distinctive LMLK fabric rather than the light brown to yellowish fabric with gray grits that characterized Zimhoni's Group HIB (see note 21). 94 Six jars from Stratum II (PL 46:1-5, 7) were measured for their capacity (see Table 36, p. 182). The results were 43, 42, 50, 44, 44 and 30 liters respectively (average: 42.1 liters), though some of these lacked their neck. At Lachish, six jars from Level III that were measured ranged from 43 to 51.8 liters, averaging 45 liters (Ussishkin 1978: 77-80). In Stratum III, the LMLK jars were found exclu- sively in Building 737 in the eastern part of Area D (see Timnah /: 189-193). Many fragments of these jars were found in scattered heaps on this building's floors (Loci 734, 737), as well as in Pit 757 dug into Floor 755, and Locus 731, which is the wide foun- dation trench cut by the builders of Stratum II into the debris of Stratum III Building 737. We consider that the jar fragments from this trench belonged to Building 737, as it is obvious that they were part of the backfill of the foundation trench. A lengthy process of restoration from this building resulted in 14 complete or nearly complete jars and four addi- tional upper parts (Pis. 16; 17:1-6; 18). Of these, three were stamped (PL 18). An additional seven stamped handles that were not restorable to any complete jar were found in this building (PL 19:7 has a private seal impression). A count of the non- restorable rims, handles and bases from this building has shown that there were about 15 additional jars. Thus, this building contained some 33 LMLK jars. These jars continued to be in use in Stratum II (see discussion below). These well-known LMLK jars have been exten- sively discussed in previous studies (Tufnell in Lachish III : 315-316, PL 95:484; Ussishkin 1977: 54-57; Ussishkin 1978: 76-81; Zimhoni 1990: 15-19 [Group III A] ; Gitin in Gezer III : 122-124; Mazar 1985: 307-308; Keim and Mazar 1985: 114; for additional photographs, see Keim and Mazar 1995: 130, Figs. 7.12, C23-25). In the following, we will limit ourselves to a discussion of the contributions of the finds at Tel Batash to the general issue of the LMLK jars. For a discussion of the seal impressions on these jars see pp. 191-197. The earliest example of a rim of such a jar comes from a context attributed to Level IV at Lachish {Lachish V : PL 44:10), though it seems that this context belongs to the 8th century (see note 4). Aharoni's contention that this jar appears in the 9th century at Arad was based on a high date for Strata X-IX ( Arad : 12), as opposed to the 8th century date proposed by others for these levels (Zimhoni in ' Eton : 85-87; Mazar and Netzer 1986: 90). Zimhoni</page><page sequence="103">concludes that there are no LMLK jars in Level IV at Lachish ( Zimhoni 1990: 15). The same is true at Tel Batash and other sites, at which this jar was found no earlier than late 8th century contexts.22 The discovery of a storage building at Tel Batash containing LMLK jars in Stratum III compares with the finds from Lachish Level III. At each of these two sites, 30-40 jars were found in situ in storerooms destroyed during Sennacherib's invasion of Judah. There is similarity in the ratio between stamped and unstamped handles as well. At both sites, only a few of the jars had stamped handles, while most were not stamped. At both sites four-winged and two-winged seal impressions were found in the same contexts (see further pp. 195-197). Outside Lachish and Tel Batash, relatively few examples of complete LMLK jars have been found in 8th century contexts: one jar each from Tel 'Erani {Inscriptions Reveal : 96, No. 80), Aroer Stratum III ( Aroer : 257, Fig. 8:2) and Khirbet Rabud (Kochavi 1973: PL 3:18). In the Negev, examples of such jars are Arad : Fig. 13:2 (Stratum X); Fig. 19:1 (Stratum IX); Fig. 22:18 (Stratum VIII); Beer-sheba I: Figs. 65:10-11; 67:4 (Stratum II); Tel 'Ira: Figs. 6.59:21- 23; 6.75:10-12; 6.81:6; 6.86:19 (Stratum VII). Though the latter eight jars were defined as " LMLK - like" since they lacked stamped handles, they appear to be regular LMLK jars.23 Two complete jars and additional fragments were found at Gezer ( Gezer III: Pis. 15:1-15; 16:1-2). The latter come from Stratum VI, which was dated by Gitin to the mid-8th century, while in his view the following Stratum V spans the second half of the 8th as well as the 7th centuries. We believe that Stratum VI can be extended to the end of the 8th century.24 The discovery of over 70 LMLK seal impressions in Macalister's excavations at Gezer (Welten 1969: 65-66) and the fact that two complete jars came from Field VII implies, in our view, that Gezer became a Judean stronghold during the revolt against Assyria in the time of Hezekiah, just as did Timnah, 9 km to the south. It is thus possible that the LMLK jars at Gezer, like those at Tel Batash, arrived at these two non- Judean cities during the time of Hezekiah' s preparations for the war against Senna- cherib. Zimhoni (1990: 18), like Gitin, suggested that LMLK jars were essentially a popular type of storage jar in daily use during the 8th century. She claimed that during Hezekiah's reign the jars "were not spe- cifically made in preparation for the revolt, but rather the production was simply continued, and those jars intended for official use were stamped." This view might be supported by the finding of such jars at Arad Strata X-IX. In our view, the INAA results, the homogeneity of clay, the mass production reflected in the manufacturing procedures and the manner in which the stamps were impressed reinforce the con- clusion that most of these jars were prepared hastily in a single workshop, presumably shortly before Sennacherib's invasion, to serve as the main storage vessel during Hezekiah's military operations. The LMLK jars were thus presumably brought to Building 737 during Hezekiah's preparations for Sennacherib's assault. Hezekiah's domination of Tel Miqne-Ekron prior to 701 BCE would have included control of Timnah, whether it was a secondary town within the city-state of Ekron or a Judean town at the time. Thus the LMLK jars were possibly used for the transport of food supplies for the Judean garrison stationed at Timnah. The fact that at Tel Miqne- Ekron no such jars were found in 8th century con- texts, apart from two stamped handles from a fill ascribed to Stratum IIA (Gitin 1989a: 25-26), may imply that a Judean garrison did not reach this city, although it was subjugated to Judah during the revolt. Such a scenario is consistent with the recov- ery of large numbers of LMLK jars and stamped handles at other sites in the Shephelah and Judean hills destroyed by Sennacherib. The jars, presumably produced during the years immediately before 701 BCE, were most probably used for the collection and storage of taxes in kind (grain, wine, oil, etc.), pos- sibly the result of special levies intended to ensure an emergency food supply for the war effort. Ultimately, however, the jars recovered at Timnah possibly served as shipment and distribution containers for supplies for Hezekiah's forces, in anticipation of the imminent Assyrian assault. Unlike the situation at Lachish, at Tel Batash we have categorical and virtually unique evidence for the continued use of LMLK jars in Stratum II, as several jars of this type were found in the destruction debris of Stratum II buildings. Building 743 con- tained three almost complete jars (PL 35:1-3) and Building 950 contained one complete and four almost complete jars, as well as two upper parts (PL 46:1, 3, 4, 6-7, 9-10). The jars from Stratum II show much similarity in general shape, size and fabric with the Stratum III jars. The preserved necks are slightly everted (PL 46:1) or straight (PL 46:9-10), with slightly everted, rounded rim tops. Tel Batash is virtually the only site where a group of such jars were restored from both late 8th century and late 7th 95</page><page sequence="104">century contexts.25 At Tel Miqne, one LMLK jar from Stratum IB (Gitin 1995: 68, Fig. 4.9:8) has been published so far.26 See also two stamped han- dles from Locus 23043 in the Ophel of Jerusalem, dated to the Babylonian destruction {Jerusalem, Ophel : 131). The find of complete LMLK jars in the late 7th century context of Stratum II can be explained in several ways (see also below, p. 197): 1. Such jars continued to be produced throughout the 7th century. This seems doubtful in view of the homogeneity of the clay and production technique. INAA has shown that all the LMLK jars were man- ufactured at a single production center. It appears that this center operated for a rather short period pre- ceding Sennacherib's invasion in 701 BCE. 2. The jars found in Stratum II were produced together with the other LMLK jais during the late 8th century, but somehow continued in use throughout the 7th century. This possibility seems legitimate since the jars were probably used for storing of products in royal storehouses, where careful handling could have assured their continuous use over a long period. It is possible that even at Timnah such a royal storehouse, escaping destruction during Sennacherib's invasion, could have remained in use during the following century. 3. The jars arrived at Timnah during the 7th century from other locations, where they had been preserved after Hezekiah's reign. The prime candi- date for such a place is Jerusalem itself, which sur- vived the Assyrian invasion of 701 BCE and where thousands of such jars were probably housed in royal storage centers. During the 7th century such jars certainly continued to be distributed from Jerusalem to various other sites (as suggested in H. Shilhah : 208-209). SJ 9. "Rosette" jars (Photo 47) Stratum II: Pis. 46:2, 5, 8; 61:4-5; 104:19 Stratum IIA: Pl. 63:4 Stamped handles: Pis. 56:3; 61:14; 67:1-3; 106:12 (Stratum II) Large storage jars (65-70 cm high; neck diameter 8-10 cm) continuing the general concept of the LMLK storage jars, but with a more elongated oval body, wide rounded base and slightly everted rim. These jars are called "rosette" storage jars after the handles that are sometimes stamped with a rosette design (Cahill 1995: 241-244; see Cahill, this vol- 96 Photo 47. SJ 9 (PL 63:4). Scale 1:6. ume, p. 199). Three different fabrics were discerned among the jars of this type, which appear to be similar to those identified by Zimhoni at Lachish (Zimhoni 1990: 32): 1) gray-pinkish clay, gray and white grits, pockmarked and non-metallic; 2) light yellowish or light brown clay, few white grits, non- metallic; 3) what appears to be the typical fabric of the LMLK jars (FG 9) or very similar to it, such as the handle in PI. 56:3. One such handle was sub- jected to INAA and proved to be made of the same clay as the LMLK jars from various sites (Mommsen et al. 1984: 106-107; see Cahill, this volume, p. 200).</page><page sequence="105">Thus, it appears that these storage jars were inspired by the LMLK jars and were perhaps manufactured both in the same workshops as well as in other centers. The more elongated oval shape, the various clays and the rosette stamps on the handles differ- entiate this type from the LMLK jars. This is an exclusively Stratum II type.27 Eight complete or almost complete jars were restored: PL 46:2, 5, 8, found in Building 950 together with sev- eral complete jars of the LMLK type (see above); Pl. 67:4-5, two jars from Building F608; Pl. 104:19, from the gate passage in Area C; Pl. 63:4, ajar from Locus 173 of Phase IIA (the bottom half of a similar jar was found in the same locus but was omitted from the pottery plates). Both the jars from Locus 173 were made of a non-metallic, yellowish-white fabric. This locus postdates the destruction of Building 743 and thus can be dated to the very last years of the 7th century or the beginning of the 6th century. Six broken stamped handles with a rosette seal impression were found (Pis. 56:3; 61:14; 67:1-3; 106:12); these represent four or five jars (see Cahill, this volume, pp. 199-200). None of the complete jars from our excavation had stamped handles, but two of these (Pl. 67:4-5) were found in Building F608 near three stamped handles (Pl. 67:1-3) in the same destruction layer. These handles did not fit the restored jars, but may belong to another jar or jars, fragments of which were found in the same building and could not be restored. The stamped handle in PL 106:12 comes from a probe in the debris outside the last gate structure in Area C. In addition to the eight complete or almost com- plete restored jars of this type, and the six stamped handles (four to five jars), an additional 42 rim or rim and handle fragments were registered which may possibly represent nine jars, according to their rim diameter coefficient. Thus, an estimated maximum total of 22 jars were recovered at Tel Batash, of which only four or five were stamped. This ratio may reflect a similar process to that noted for the LMLK jars, in which only a random sample of the pro- duction line was stamped, while the majority remained unstamped (see pp. 195-197). The only jar that was measured for capacity was Pl. 46:2, which could hold 42 liters. In the City of David, where 16 restored jars of this type were measured, the capacity ranged between 31.7 and 42 liters (Cahill 1995: 242-244). These jars were defined at Lachish in three separate studies: Tufiiell's Class S.7b, Type 483 {Lachish III : 316, Pl. 95:482-483); Aharoni's Type 190 {Lachish V: Pis. 49:13-15; 54) and Zimhoni's Group IIB (Zimhoni 1990: 31-33). At Jerusalem this jar is found only in the destruction debris of 586 BCE; at Lachish it is exclusively found in Level II.28 At Tel 'Ira, this type was found only in Stratum VI {Tel Ira : Figs. 6.61:13; 6.91:16; 6.92:23; 6.104:12; the first three are stamped, while the last is not). This type was not very common at Tel Batash and is generally found in dispersed contexts, except for Building F608, which contained two jars of this type, as well as three stamped handles that may represent one or two jars (see Cahill, this volume, pp. 199- 200). Most of the jars were found in domestic con- texts, but also in settings that may be considered industrial (e.g. Oil Press Building 950 and Unit 173). As opposed to the LMLK storage jars, which were found in dense concentrations at Tel Batash and Lachish, these jars were usually found in small quantities together with other storage jar types. At Lachish, a total of 15 jars and 23 stamped handles of this type was found by all the expeditions working there. However, they were very frequent in Jerusalem and Ramat Rahel (Zimhoni 1990: 32; Cahill 1995: 241-244). The distribution of this jar is strictly Judean. Thus, its appearance at Tel Batash, the westernmost site where it is found, marks one of the links of our site with Judah in Stratum II (for possible interpretations see pp. 281-282 and Cahill, this volume, p. 200). Note that jars of this type apparently do not appear at nearby Tel Miqne; only one very depleted and uncertainly identified handle was found (Cahill 1995: 249, note 23). Bag-Shaped and Waisted Storage Jars: SJ 7a-c, e, SJ 18, SJ 14, SJ 15a-b, SJ 17 Bag-shaped storage jars ("Coastal Jars99): SJ 7 Medium-sized jars (45-60 cm high; 30-40 cm max- imum diameter) with a bag-shaped body whose maximum diameter is below mid-body, ending in a rounded or tapering base; a few bases are slightly button-like. Two loop handles extend from below a carinated, narrow straight or slightly sloping shoul- der. There is sometimes a slight depression on the lower part of the body, probably as a result of placement in the kiln. Several are covered with what appears to be a light-colored slip and are wet- smoothed; there is similar treatment on such jars at 97</page><page sequence="106">Kuntillet 'Ajrud (' Ajrud : 164) and Lachish (Zimhoni 1990: 35). A total of 37 complete or almost complete jars of this type were restored in our excavation, seven from Stratum III and 30 from Stratum II. This type is divided into three subtypes (SJ 7a-c) that differ from one another only in the shape of the rim and neck. The subtypes were broadly differ- entiated according to neck lengths, though this was not an entirely definitive criterion and its significance remains ambiguous. Subtypes a-c appear in both Strata III and II, though in varying proportions, as detailed below. A fourth subtype (SJ 7d) is dis- tinguished by its body shape Two groups of three jars each were found in the Stratum III Building 737 in Area D ( Timnah I: 193). Three of these (PL 20:1-3) came from Locus 857, and were found buried beneath the white lime floor (782) in this room. The rims of these jars were flush with the floor and in one instance the level of the jar's neck was extended with the aid of a broken rim of a similar jar, possibly to accommodate a slight floor raising during its use. It appears that these three jars were embedded in the floor during its initial construction and thus must be dated to the founda- tion phase of Stratum III. The other three (PL 20:4-6) were found a little farther to the north, in Pit 753 found in Floor 744. In this case, it could not be determined whether the jars were installed when the floor was constructed or whether the pit was cut into the floor after its construction. SJ 7a.

The inner neck sometimes protrudes into the vessel past the join to the shoulder (e.g. PL 27:18), called a "pressure bulge" by Gitin (Gezer III: 119). The range of capacity of this subtype is 24-36 liters, with most between 30 and 36 liters (see PL 45:1-5). Comparisons may be made to the following: Ashdod //-///: Fig. 43:3^ (Stratum VIII); Tel Miqne Stratum IB (Gitin 1989a: Fig. 2.12:5; Gitin 1995: 66, Fig. 4.6:2). S J 7b.

Some of the examples are virtually neckless. This was the most frequent subtype of SJ 7 in Stratum II. Aharoni maintained that this type was quite common at Lachish, though rare at other Judean sites {Lachish V: 36, PL 48:16, Level II). Zimhoni defined</page><page sequence="107">these neckless jars at Lachish as of coastal origin. As at Tel Batash, they begin in small quantities and with a narrower body in Level III (Zimhoni 1990: 25-26, Fig. 17:4, Group HID) and appear in significant quantities in Level II (ibid.: 35-36, Fig. 25, Group IID). This is Tufhell's Class S.2, Type 469. See also M. Aharoni 1981: Fig. 9:5, Arad Stratum XI (note that such jars do not appear later than Stratum XI in the published material from Arad); Aroer : Fig. 5:2 (Stratum II); Tel Ira : Fig. 6.101:8 (Stratum VI); Gezer III : 119-121, Storage Jar Type la-c, e.g. Pl. 17:1-5 (Stratum VI); Pl. 26:17-18, 21 (Stratum V); Tel Miqne (Gitin 1995: 66, Fig. 4.6:1, Stratum IB); Ashdod II-III : Fig. 43:5 (Stratum VIII, decorated in typical "Ashdod ware" style); Ashdod IV : Fig. 15:4 (Stratum VIII); Figs. 21:12; 22:3^1; 27:2 (Stratum VII), ajar that, with rim variations, is very typical of the later Iron Age strata at Ashdod {Ashdod II-III: 95); Ashkelon (Stager 1996: 64*, Fig. 3, five com- plete jars); Ruqeish Graves : Fig. 4:R21. At Kuntillet 'Ajrud, this type constitutes the most dominant type of storage jar. Ayalon defined it as a southern coastal type whose production center, according to INAA, was somewhere in that region (' Ajrud : 164-165, Fig. 13:1^4). The 'Ajrud assemblage (ca. 800 BCE) provides the earliest bulk appearance of this type (note that our subtypes SJ 7a and SJ 7c are not represented at Kuntillet 'Ajrud). A comparable jar from Tel Michal should be mentioned ( Tel Michal : Fig. 7.3:14, Stratum XIII), though its body is somewhat dissimilar. This context was dated by the excavators to the second half of the 10th century (ibid.: 86), which would be an exceptionally early appearance for this type of jar. SJ 7c.

The complete examples of this subtype are somewhat smaller (averaging ca. 45 cm high) than the others. This subtype is much less frequent than the previous two. Most of the long straight necks in Stratum III lack the "pressure bulge" characteristic of the shorter-necked versions of this jar, and the body is somewhat less swollen than the other subtypes. The only jar of this type measured (PI. 45:7) had a capacity of 20 liters. This type is rare outside Tel Batash. One jar from Lachish Level III that recalls our PI. 20:4, 6 (Zim- honi 1990: 26, Figs. 17:1) is defined as having a "coastal origin." No such jars were found in Level II at Lachish.

The sizes vary, and this is reflected in the range of their capacities, from as little as 10 liters (PI. 45:8) to as much as 45 liters (PI. 47:8; the latter is an exceptionally large jar in this group). It appears that on PI. 47:8, handles were planned but never added, as there is an upper beginning of the handle but no lower part. The elongated body shape of this subtype recalls that of the more cyma-shaped forerunners of the so- called "sausage" or "torpedo" jars; see our SJ 15 below (Gitin's Type 5: Gezer III: 124-125, PI. 16:5, Stratum VIA). A similar jar from Kuntillet 'Ajrud is 100 covered with light red slip {'Ajrud: Fig. 13:5). Aya- lon viewed this shape as a northern one with Phoe- nician influence and cited 9th-8th century parallels in the north and along the southern coast (ibid.: 165). However, our jars come from clear Stratum II con- texts and thus postdate these parallels. It may be concluded that S J 7d is a hybrid product that com- bined the neck typical of S J 7 with a body found on a jar type of the previous 8th century, especially in northern and coastal contexts (see our SJ 15). Three of the four jars of this subtype came from contexts related to the oil industry, and were perhaps used in olive oil production. SJ 7. Undefined in absence of neck and rim Stratum II: Pis. 35:9; 45:9 SJ 7 with perforated body Stratum II: PI. 35:9. See discussion on p. 140. Summary: SJ 7 S J 7 was the most popular storage jar in Stratum II, though it already appeared in viable quantities and in reliable contexts in Stratum III. Subtypes a-c appear in both Strata III and II, though it seems that the long neck (SJ 7c) occurs mainly in Stratum III and the short neck (SJ 7b) in Stratum II, while the medium neck (SJ 7a) is equally frequent in Strata III and II. This suggests that neck length is a chronological indicator, at least at Tel Batash. The neckless jar with an elongated body (SJ 7d) is exclusively found in Stratum II and is perhaps related to the oil industry. Its general shape has an affinity to that of the "torpedo" jars found at many 8th and 7th century sites. The jars from Tel Michal Stratum XIII and Arad Stratum XI seem to mark the earliest appearances of this jar. The short-necked/neckless version (SJ 7b) can be found at coastal sites and inland as far as Lachish in the late 9th-8th centuries (e.g. Ashdod, Ruqeish, Lachish, Timnah, Gezer; note also 'Ajrud and Beer-sheba). This type became very popular during the 7th century along the coastal plain of Philistia and is the main jar type at Ashdod, Ash- kelon, Tel Miqne and Tel Batash. Though it is rela- tively frequent in Lachish Level II, it is rare in Judah, and appears only in small numbers at a few other sites at this time, such as Tel 'Ira and Aroer. The virtual lack of a neck (and the body shape of SJ 7d) link this jar with the so-called "torpedo" or "sausage" jars that are common in the late Iron Age II, espe-</page><page sequence="109">daily along the northern coast (see below, S J 15). The relatively compact proportions of this jar made it convenient to use, and it perhaps functioned as the main trading jar in the coastal plain. At Tel Miqne and Tel Batash, where the olive oil industry was a major enterprise during the 7th century, such jars were perhaps the main containers for storing and shipping olive oil. The affinity of SJ 7 with SJ 18 is discussed below. S J 18. Swollen piriform jars with tapering base (Photo 51) Stratum II: Pis. 67:6; 73:2-3; 104:18 Photo 51. SJ 18 (PL 73:3). Scale 1:6. Medium-sized to large jars (55-60 cm high; maximum body diameter ca. 35 cm; neck diameter ca. 9 cm) with short, round shoulders sloping to a swollen piriform body whose maximum diameter is at or just below mid-body from which the sides slope down to a tapering, "funnel-shaped" narrow base with a concave bottom. PI. 73:3 has a more elongated body; PL 67:6 has a wid^r base. The ring-like rim is very short, similar to that of the "neckless" SJ 7b. Two loop handles extend from the shoulder. Two of the restored jars came from Building F607 (PL 73:2-3), the third from the nearby Building F608 (PL 67:6) and the fourth from the gate passage (PL 104:18). The first three are from secure Stratum II domestic contexts. In Stratum III, this type of jar is not represented at all. This is a very infrequent type at Tel Batash: only seven examples were found. However, it should be noted that the differentiation between this type and SJ 7b is based almost entirely on the lower body shape; thus, some of the rim and body fragments registered as SJ 7 may in fact have belonged to S J 18 in both Strata III and II. This morphological affinity between SJ 18 and S J 7 has been discussed by others. Gitin viewed the former as a variant of the latter ( Gezer III : 120). Tufnell included both her Type 472 (our SJ 18) and Type 469 (our SJ 7) in the wide typological group Class S.2, including examples from both Levels III and II at Lachish {Lachish III : 313, PL 94:472). Zimhoni postulated that the typological resemblance implies a common origin (Zimhoni 1990: 36, 38-40). Zimhoni discerned a typological difference between the earlier versions of our SJ 18 (her Group HIE), which appear in Lachish Level III (ibid.: Fig. 17:3), and a later version (her Group HE) found in Lachish Level II (ibid.: 36-41, Figs. 27; 28:1-5). The earlier type, which sometimes bears incised patterns in the shape of a butterfly, is found at sites in the Negev and the southern coast, such as Beer-sheba Stratum II, Tel 'Ira Stratum VII, Ashdod Stratum VIII and the Ruqeish graves, though it is rare in Lachish Level III, Tell Beit Mirsim Stratum A and Arad Strata X-VIII (ibid.: 27-29). The examples of S J 18 at Tel Batash belong typologically to the later version, and this jar is indeed found only in Stratum II. Similar jars appear in the 7th century at additional sites such as Lachish (Zimhoni 1990: 36-41, Figs. 27; 28:1-5, Level II), Jerusalem, Ophel : PL 14:1, Jemmeh : Pl. ZX:46P, Tel Sera' and Tel Haror (Oren and Morrison 1986: 81, Fig. 19:2, 5) and Tel Ira : Fig. 6.62:18 (Stratum VI). Zimhoni (1990: 40) suggested that during the 7th century S J 1 8 and S J 7 were produced in a common workshop in the southern coastal plain, which dis- 101</page><page sequence="110">tributed S J 18 to the Shephelah and S J 7 to the coast. Indeed, S J 18 does not appear in Strata VII or VI at Ashdod, nor has it been published so far from Tel Miqne. This may indicate that at the end of the 7th century Timnah continued to interact economically with the Shephelah, western Negev and Judah, while Ashdod and other coastal sites ceased to do so. SJ 14a. Bag-shaped jars with holemouth rim and two handles (Photo 52) Stratum IIA: Pl. 63:6 Photo 52. SJ 14a (PL 63:6). Scale 1:6. A medium-sized jar whose slightly bag-shaped body recalls SJ 7, but it has a wide holemouth rim that is thickened and rounded, similar to KR 35a. The base is tapering. Two loop handles extend from below the rim exterior. In addition to the one com- 102 plete example, five sherds were registered with this type in Stratum II, though their fragmentary nature precludes reliable classification. No exact parallel was found for this storage jar. Its closest analogy is to ajar from Tel Miqne Stratum IB (Gitin 1989a: Fig. 2.12:6), though this has a slightly wider body, a small button base and a different rim (which is somewhat similar to the rim of subtype SJ 14b below); it is defined by Gitin as a southern type. A storage jar with an identical body comes from Tell Beit Mirsim Stratum A (TBM III: PI. 13:9) found in association with the "dye industry" (ibid.: 146), which can probably be more correctly identified as an olive oil industry. A similar jar was found in the Stratum VII storeroom at Tel 'Ira ( Tel 'Ira: Fig. 6.75:2; see also Fig. 6.88:19). A jar from Aroer Stratum II recalls our vessel, though it has four handles and a ridged rim ( Aroer : 255, Fig. 6:5). Compare also ajar from Hazor Stratum VIII {Hazor II: PL LIX:1), though it is much earlier than our jar. The resemblance of the body and handles to SJ 7, and the folded rim that is a popular element in Strata III and II, point to S J 14a being a local hybrid product, possibly related to the shape of KR 35. It was found in Locus 173 of Stratum IIA, which postdates the violent destruction of Stratum II (see Timnah I: 222), together with two other storage jars (SJ Idi and SJ 9). SJ 14b. Bag-shaped jars with holemouth rim and four handles Stratum II: PL 45:15 This jar from Building 950 (the Oil Press Build- ing) has almost the same body stance and size as SJ 14a, though it has a wide, round base. The rim stance also differs: a sloping, elongated "collar" with a pushed-out bottom creates an opening that is some- what narrower than S J 14a (13 cm in diameter). Four loop handles extend from the bottom of the rim exterior, a feature that recalls KR 35. This jar is the only example of its type at Tel Batash.</page><page sequence="111">Comparisons for this jar can be found at Tel Miqne Stratum IB (also cited for S J 14a above), Lachish Level II (Zimhoni 1990: Fig. 28:6, Group IIF), Ashdod Stratum VII (Ashdod IV: Fig. 23:1; the base is missing but appears to have been round; the rim shape differs from ours) and Tel 'Ira (see above in relation to S J 14a). Thus, it appears that this shape was influenced by the common contemporary stor- age jar (our S J 7) as well as the holemouth krater-jar (our KR 35). SJ 15a. Short "torpedo" jars (Photo 53) Stratum II: Pis. 36:1-2(7); 47:1-3 Photo 53. SJ 15a (PL 47:2). Scale 1:6. Medium-sized jars (ca. 40 cm high) with a wide, almost horizontal, sharply carinated shoulder; the short body is slightly concave below the shoulder carination, somewhat swollen below mid-body and then tapering to a sharp pointed base. The jar is neckless, with a very short ring-like rim (ca. 9 cm in diameter), reminiscent of the rim of S J 7b. PL 47:3 has a slightly more curved body, recalling the curvier shape of SJ 15b (see below). PL 36:2 is preserved to just above mid-body and has more flaring sides, similar to S J 7; however, its fabric and sharply carinated shoulder point to its belonging to S J 15 a. These jars are made of a typical orange-colored clay with numerous tiny dark inclusions (FG 19, see p. 20), which appears to be foreign at Tel Batash and appears mainly in these jars. Their capacity ranges from 6.5 to 8 liters. This jar is not frequent. PL 36:1 comes from Building 743 and the three jars in PL 47:1-3 come from Building 950, the Oil Press Building. This is a Phoenician jar type, found at various sites along the Phoenician coast and Cyprus, such as Achziv (unpublished), Tell Keisan ( Keisan : PL 47:3- 4, 6, Stratum 5) and Tyre Stratum II, dated to the last third of the 8th century (Bikai 1978: Pis. 111:2; IV:2). For Cyprus see Bikai 1987: Pl. XXIL596, 599 (from Kition, late 8th-7th centuries). Such jars also appear at various Iron Age II sites in the north and along the coast; see Hazor II: PL CI: 11 (Stratum IV); Megiddo I: PL 14:73 (Stratum I); Qasilell: Fig. 58:ll(Stratum VII); Ashdod IV: Figs. 22:2; 27:1 (Stratum VII); Tel Miqne (Gitin 1989a: 43, Fig. 2.12:4, Stratum IB); Mesad Hashavyahu: Fig. 6:16. At Lachish, 20 such jars were found and defined by Tufnell as Class S.3, Type 488 {Lachish III: PL 95:488). Though Zimhoni noted that such jars are not found in Level II at Lachish, the stratigraphie context of Type 488 (Locus E.18:Q, the approach to the Levels III- II gate; see Lachish III: 96-97) is not unequivocal and it may perhaps be attributed to Level II as well; this would correlate well with the Tel Batash examples. Such jars are not found at other Judean sites. Thus, this type was widespread at sites along the coast, with inland incursions to the inner coastal plain up to Lachish. Raban (1980: 77-79) concluded that in the 7th century this shorter version (called by him a "torpedo" jar) replaced the elongated 8th century "sausage" jar, perhaps representing an improvement in the ability of the porters to carry more than one jar at a time. These jars therefore suggest a commercial link with the Phoenician coast, perhaps related to trade in olive oil. Indeed, INAA carried out on our PL 36:1-2 pointed to a northern coastal origin, though no specific site was singled out (Gunneweg and Yellin 1991: 100). 103</page><page sequence="112">SJ 15b. "Torpedo" jars with "waisted" body (Photo 54) Stratum II: PL 47:4 Strata II I: PL 104:20 Photo 54. SJ 15b (PL 47:4). Scale 1:6. These two jars differ somewhat from one another. They recall S J 15 a, but have more sloping shoulders and a somewhat longer body with a more pro- nounced cyma shape. This is a rare type, with only eight examples registered (including PL 77:2, Stra- tum I). PL 47:4 is 54 cm high. It was found intact, sunk into the ground below the floor of the western space of the Oil Press Building 950, its rim flush with the cobblestone floor of this space ( Timnah /: 216). It was probably used to collect the oil overflow from this floor; its capacity is 13.6 liters. Since it was found embedded in the floor, this jar should be 104 ascribed to the construction of the building, rather than its destruction. Note that three jars of SJ 15a were found in the destruction debris of this building. PL 104:20 has very accentuated carinated shoulders, as well as a thickened folded outer rim and a long, pointed base. It is made of light-colored, almost white, fabric, and it is somewhat smaller that the other (47 cm high). The small handles are attached rather carelessly. This jar was found in the uppermost accumulation in the gate passage in Area C, where the differentiation between Stratum II and Stratum I debris was almost impossible; it thus can be assigned to either Stratum II or I (the Persian period). Like S J 15a, this is essentially a northern and coastal type. See Keisan : PL 47:1-2 (Stratum 5), which recall our PL 47:4, and PL 27: 1^4 (Stratum 4), which are similar to our PL 104:20; Megiddo /: PL 16:79-80 (Strata III-I); Hazor II : Pl. LXXIIL4, Stratum VI, very frequent; PL CI:9, Stratum IV (note that such jars are absent from Stratum V at Hazor); Tell el-Far 'ah I' PL 45:23 (Stratum Vile); 'Atlit (Johns 1933: 50, Fig. 3:a-c); Tyre (Bikai 1978: PL 111:7-8, Stratum II, Storage Jar 4); Cyprus (Bikai 1987: PL XXIII:589, ajar from Kition that is similar to our PL 104:20). In the south, such jars appear from the late 8th century onwards. See Lachish III : PL 95: Tufnell's Type 489 (Level III) of which only two examples were found; Zimhoni noted that this type does not appear in Lachish Level II (Zimhoni 1990: 28), but see Lachish III : PL 96, Tufnell's Type 530 from Level II, which appears to be similar to our PL 104:20; Beer-sheba /: PL 57:7 (Stratum II), recalling our PL 47:4, but longer; Ashdod //-/// : Fig. 42:4 (Stratum VIII), similar to our PL 47:4, but longer; this type was quite common at Ashdod in Stratum VII. At Gezer, only rims that may belong to this type were found. Gitin concluded that this type began in the last quarter of the 8th century, but possibly did not continue into the late 7th-early 6th centuries {Gezer III: 125-127, PL 26:6-8, Stratum VA, Type 6). Thus, the more elongated cyma-shaped jars sim- ilar to our PL 47:4 began to appear in the late 8th century, and while this shape becomes less common in the 7th century, it continued to appear in that century as well. PL 104:20, a smaller version with white fabric, represents a late 7th century form that probably continued into the 6th century. PL 77:2 (Stratum I) is an example of the later development of these jars (see p. 187).</page><page sequence="113">Bikai tentatively suggested, on the basis of the evidence from Tyre, that the earlier (9th-8th cen- turies) examples of this type had longer rims and longer and straighter bodies, while the later (late 8th- 7th centuries) versions had very short rims and a more waisted body shape. However, she admits that the evidence from Tyre is not sufficient to determine this with certainty (Bikai 1978: 46). Raban con- cluded that the variety of shapes and lengths found among the different versions of this jar is more the result of their having been produced in numerous workshops, and constantly undergoing adaptation to the needs of maritime transport of goods, rather than specific regional and chronological considerations (Raban 1980: 77-78). In any case, our examples from clear late 7th century contexts are further evi- dence for trade connections with the Phoenician coast in the late Iron Age II. SJ 17. Bag-shaped, tall-necked jars with everted rim (Photo 55) Stratum II: Pis. 45:13; 55:8; 95:7(7); 97:8, 12(7); 103:5(7), 6(7) Photo 55. SJ 17 (PL 97:8). Scale 1:6. Small to medium-sized jars (43-48 cm high) with sloping round or carinated shoulders; the body is bag-shaped, with its maximum diameter above the wide, round base. The neck is straight and long, terminating in an everted round or truncated rim top (neck diameter ca. 10 cm). These jars are usually made of metallic fabric. The capacity of PI. 45:13 is 16.5 liters. This is a strictly Judean type, appearing in the late 7th-early 6th centuries (Aharoni and Aharoni 1976: 86); see Lachish III : PI. 95:486 (Level II); Jerusalem, Ophel : 17, Pis. A:'-A' 5:1^4; 6:10 (a group of jars recalling our PI. 95:7), all from Locus 23041, dated to the very end of the Iron Age; Jerusalem, City of David (Shiloh 1985: 77, Fig. 6:1, destruction debris of 586 BCE); Ramat Rahel II : Fig. 19:4 (Stratum V, recalls our PI. 45:13); En-Gedi : Figs. 9:14; 22:4 (Stratum V); Arad : Figs. 25:15; 29:11 (Strata VII- VI); Masos II : PI. 166:14 (Iron Age II); Tel ' Ira : Fig. 6.61:15 (Stratum VI). Such storage jars were very common in Jer- usalem, though they were apparently slightly larger {Jerusalem, Ophel : 16-17). The distortion mentioned on the Jerusalem jars, probably as a result of the way they were stacked in the kiln, was noted also on one jar at Tel Batash (PI. 97:8). Thus, though this is not a common jar at Tel Batash, its very appearance at this site provides a late 7th-early 6th century link to Judah, where this was a ubiquitous type. Cylindrical Holemouth Jars: S J lOa-b The cylindrical holemouth jar with a shelf rim was a popular type at Tel Batash, as at many Judean and southern sites in the latter half of Iron Age II; it is a relatively rare type in the north (Amiran 1969: 241). The jars were subdivided according to rim differ- ences; selected parallels are provided for each. SJ 10a. Plain inverted shelf rim (Photo 56) Stratum III: PI. 21:5(7) Stratum II: Pis. 47:10-12; 57:22-23; 61:2; 67:9; 95:5-6; 97:1-2; 103:11 Five complete examples of this subtype found in Stratum II are medium-sized cylindrical holemouth jars (ca. 30 cm high; body diameter ca. 20 cm) with straight sides terminating in a wide round base. The rim top is a flat, smooth, inverted ledge, which is either horizontal, forming a right angle with the body, or slightly angled up (e.g. Pis. 47:11; 95:5). 105</page><page sequence="114">Photo 56. SJ 10a (PL 47:11). Scale 1:6. Since this type is generally handleless, the small fragment in PL 57:22 was questionably included in this type, due to its rim stance. The capacity of the complete vessels ranged from 7.2 to 9 liters. The earliest appearance of this type is in Stratum VIII at Arad (Aharoni and Aharoni 1976: Fig. 3:8). During the 7th century this type became popular, mainly at southern sites, when it replaced the roun- ded short rim version that was popular in the late 9th-8th centuries. The following is only a partial list: Beth Shemesh III : PL XXVII:33-4-25; 4-82, Cistern 25; Beth Shemesh IV: PL LXV:18, 21, 27, 33, Stratum lie; Lachish III : Pis. 96:498; 97:537-543; some with two handles (TufnelPs Class S.8, Level II);29 Jerusalem, City of David (Shiloh 1985: Fig. 6:17, 19, Area G, destruction debris of 586 BCE); Seligman 1994: Figs. 6:1; 9:5-7 (Jerusalem envi- rons, 8th-7th centuries); Ramat Rahel I : Fig. 29:6- 11; Ramat Rahel II: 31, Fig. 19:1-3 (Stratum V); Fig. 20:1-12 (Stratum VA); En-Gedi: Fig. 21:1-2 (Stratum V); Tel Ira: Fig. 6.59:19 (Stratum VII); Gibeon: Fig. 48:2; Mesad Hashavyahu: Fig. 5:13; Tell el-Far 'ah I: PL 45:18 (Stratum Vile); Megiddo I: PL 11:54 (Strata IV- I; see our PL 47:11); Adoni Nur: Fig. 22:93. 106 Thus this type has a mainly Judean distribution in the 7th century, though it also reached a few coastal and northern sites, as well as Transjordan. Its pres- ence at Tel Batash is a further example of the inter- mediary nature of the ceramic assemblage of the site in the late Iron Age II. SJ 10b.

Medium-sized holemouth jars (ca. 30-38 cm high; average body diameter ca. 18 cm; PL 93:19 is rela- tively very small) with straight sides terminating in a round or slightly tapering base. Several are some- what "waisted" and swollen near the base; such a body stance is not found in SJ 10a (see above). The rim top is ridged, and generally slants rather sharply upwards, though some examples are horizontal. A few rims protrude slightly on the exterior (e.g. PL 61:3). The capacity of the jars measured is 5-6 liters. The six complete examples found at Tel Batash came from the houses of Stratum II. In fact, each of the excavated houses contained at least one such jar. In Building 743 the jar in PL 36:5 was found sunk in</page><page sequence="115">the floor of Room 748, its rim flush with the floor; a scarab was found inside it (PL 39:1; see pp. 266- 268). The two jars in Pis. 47:13-14 were found in Oil Press Building 950. Two jars were found in Building F607 (PL 73:5-60) and one in Building F608 (PL 67:10). The ridged-rim holemouth jar had a wider dis- tribution than the smooth-rim subtype (SJ 10a). The following is a list of selected comparisons from both 8th and 7th century contexts: Beth Shemesh IV: Pl. LXV:19, 24, 26, 30-32 (Stratum lie); Beth Shemesh III : Pl.

Thus, the ridged-rim version is found in both 8th and 7th century contexts in Judah, while along the coast and in the north these jars are mainly found in the 7th century, indicating perhaps that they spread to the latter regions during the late Iron Age II. Summary: cylindrical holemouth jars Cylindrical jars with small holemouth openings, often with a short thickened or everted rim, begin to appear in the 9th century in the north and south of the country. Holemouth jars with wider openings and flat or ridged inverted shelf rims became ubiquitous in the second half of the Iron Age II, especially in Judah. It seems that the latter did not begin before the end of the 9th/beginning of the 8th century at the earliest (note that no such jars were found at Kuntillet 'Ajrud). They subsequently spread to coastal and northern sites during the course of the 7th century, but never became a common type in the north (Amiran 1969: 242). The evidence from Tel Batash precludes a clear chronological distinction between 8th century and 7th century inverted-rim holemouth jar types. This is in contrast to M. and Y. Aharoni's conclusion that the smooth-rim jar replaced the ridged-rim jar in the 7th century (Aharoni and Aharoni 1976: 83). It seems that the flat, smooth rim was distributed mainly in Judah and appeared in limited numbers at coastal and northern sites in the 7th century. The ridged-rim version coexisted with the smooth-rim type from the 8th century until the end of the Iron Age II, and was found in Judah, the Negev, the coast and some inland and northern sites as well. The popularity of the holemouth jar at Tel Batash is an indication of Judean connections in the latter half of Iron Age II. Geva suggested that the shape of these jars suits their mode of storage, which was to stack them on top of one another (Geva 1992: 138). Their presence in large quantities in Cistern 25 at Beth Shemesh may allude to some function related to water draw- ing. At Tel Batash, these jars were found in domestic and industrial contexts alike. Varia The following are storage jars and jar sherds that could not be classified in the type series. Stratum IV Pl. 84:18-19. Two small rim and neck fragments with an inverted stance and an angled-in rim top. A prominent feature is the inner bulge at the bottom of the neck, similar to S J 7. This may be compared to some of the examples included in Zimhoni's Type SJ-6 at Lachish Levels V-IV (Zimhoni 1997: Fig. 3.51). PL 84:21. A small sherd of an inverted neck with a slight ridge in its center. A possible comparison may be a similar profile with a thickened rim {Jerusalem, Ophel: Pl. 8:4, Locus 23041). See also several of the rims and necks included with Type SJ-2 at Lachish Levels V-IV (Zimhoni 1997: Fig. 3.47). A similar 107</page><page sequence="116">profile may be seen in one of Zimhoni's Type SJ-8, though with a thickened rim (ibid.: Fig. 3.53:6, Level IV). Stratum III Pl. 22:7. A very small fragment of a short, wide neck; the rim has an external triangle. No compar- isons were found for this shape. PL 22:16. A fragment of a short wide neck with a groove below the rim exterior. This may possibly be compared to several rims in Zimhoni's Type SJ-3 from Lachish Levels V-IV (Zimhoni 1997: Fig. 3.48). Pl. 22:17. A fragment of the straight neck of ajar or jug (3 cm long; neck diameter 10.5 cm) with round rim top and several ridges below the slightly thick- ened rim exterior; red-slipped. PI. 92:5 is similar in the fine ridges on the exterior, though the rim is everted. Compare Ashdod IV: Fig. 14:8 (Stratum VIII); Ashdod /: Fig. 36:8 (Stratum VIII). PI. 25:19. A small fragment of a short neck with a slightly inverted stance. The thickened rim top is rounded and marked by a groove at the bottom of its exterior. This may be compared to a rim included with Zimhoni's Type SJ-3 at Lachish (Zimhoni 1997: Fig. 3.48:9, Level IV). PI. 92:6. A short neck with a rounded bulge at its joint to the shoulder; the rim top is thickened, with a protruding exterior that angles slightly down. Note a similarity of this rim to that of a bag-shaped storage jar from Kuntillet 'Ajrud, which also has a ridge at the base of its neck {'Ajrud: Fig. 11:7). PI. 92:15. The almost complete profile of a small storage jar 35 cm high (though the base is missing) with a medium-sized straight neck (3 cm long; diameter ca. 12) and a thickened rim with a truncated interior. The slightly rounded shoulders slope to a rounded carination; the sides are straight down to an additional rounded carination below mid-body, below which they taper to the missing base. Remains of a horizontal handle are found at the shoulder carination. The vessel is red-slipped and covered with shiny vertical burnish lines outside. The closest parallel in shape and decoration is a vessel from Arad Stratum XI (M. Aharoni 1981: Fig. 8:5, red slip, vertical burnish); however, it is slightly 108 earlier and has two loop handles. The features of horizontal handles and red slip covered by prominent vertical burnish may be seen at Ruqeish on burial kraters ( Ruqeish : 51, Nos. 6-7) or "jar-kraters" (ibid.: 53, Nos. 14-15). Compare also a jar with two hori- zontal handles at the shoulder carination (ibid.: 55, No. 22). At Ashdod, horizontal handles are found on deep bowls and kraters in Strata VIII-VII (e.g. Ash- dod II-III: Figs. 54:1; 59:17; Ashdod IV: Fig. 20:21; see also discussion of our KR 36). Though none of the vessels from Ashdod is a deep jar, the handle type and burnished red slip recall this pottery tradition. Stratum II Pl. 35:8. A complete handleless jar (40 cm high) with a straight neck (3 cm long; diameter 13 cm) and short, sloping, carinated shoulders above an ovoid body; the base is narrow and flattened. The jar was found in Building 743. The general stance is some- what reminiscent of SJ 7, but the neck is wider and the body does not have the typical bag-like effect of that type (though see subtype SJ 7d). A few handle- less storage jars were found at Lachish Level II (Zimhoni 1990: Fig. 30; Lachish V: PL 54:170), but their neck and rim shapes differ from ours. Zimhoni cites similar jars from Ramat Rahel (e.g. Ramat Rahel I: Fig. 12:3, top part only). PI. 47:6. This drawing restores the profile of what appears to be a handleless storage jar whose rounded sides are widest at just about mid-body, with a tapering base. The jar has a wide holemouth opening with a simple, rounded rim. It was found in the destruction debris in the entrance to Oil Press Building 950, and may have been related to the oil production process. Though the body is of slightly different proportions, and the rim is not as rounded, this jar might be compared to a handleless jar from Tell Beit Mirsim Stratum A ( TBM III: PI. 13:9), which was mentioned as a parallel to our S J 14a above. PI. 47:7. An elongated narrow lower body, with a button base, of an unknown type (perhaps an amphoriskos?). PI. 58:20. The rim and downslanting shoulder of what might be a variation of the cylindrical hole- mouth jars (our S J 10a). It has a very short everted rim and fine ridges on the exterior below the shoulders. See Mesad Hashavyahu: Fig. 5:12.</page><page sequence="117">JUGS The variety of jug forms makes it difficult to estab- lish a consistent typological sequence, and the fol- lowing division into types should thus be treated with reservation. Though an attempt was made to assemble types that have as many common features as possible, in many cases it was virtually impossible to create homogeneous groups. The jugs are divided into two main broad groups: wide-necked and nar- row-necked. Wide-necked Jugs: JG 30, JG 11, JG 22, JG 22b, JG 16, JG 23, JG 19 JG 30. Short wide neck, plain rim Stratum IVB: Pl. 85:18 Stratum IV: Pis. 81:8, 14, 15; 84:23; 86:13 Small to medium-sized jug (neck diameter ca. 7.5 cm) with a short neck (2.5-3.5 cm long) that is either straight (Pis. 81:8, 14; 84:23; 86:13) or somewhat flaring (e.g. Pis. 81:15; 85:18), with a rounded rim top and sloping rounded shoulders. A thick loop handle extends from the rim top to the shoulder. The lower part of the body was not preserved. This is not a common type; no examples are slipped or bur- nished. The fragmentary nature of these jugs makes it difficult to determine parallels. The following are suggested: Lachish V: PL 42:3-4 (Level V); these are similar to Zimhoni's cooking jugs from Lachish Levels V-IV (Zimhoni 1997: Fig. 3.44). The sim- ilarity to the profile of vessels defined as cooking pots at Arad, Beer-sheba and Kuntillet 4 Ajrud may be noted as well; see M. Aharoni 1981: Fig. 7:5 (Stra- tum XI); Beer-sheba Iš. Pl. 54:15-17 (Stratum V); Beer-sheba II: Fig. 28:8, 11 (Stratum VI); ' Ajrud : Fig. 6:7. Table 13.

Iron Age II typology: jugs. 110</page><page sequence="119">Fig. 7 (cont.). Iron Age II typology: jugs. The simple stance of this utilitarian vessel makes it difficult to exploit as a type for chronological or regional definition. Though the ware of these jugs did not suggest their use as cooking vessels, they do have a morphological affinity to the so-called "cook- ing jugs" found in 10th-8th century contexts. JG 11. Wide concave neck and globular body (Photo 58) Stratum IVB: Pl. 85:15 Stratum IV: Pl. 83:5, 7 Stratum HIB: Pl. 89:6 Stratum III: Pis. 21:10-15; 26:1-2, 4, 8; 27:4; 88:8 Stratum II: Pis. 37:2-3; 48:1-3; 57:8, 12; 74:3; 104:16 Photo 58. JG 11 (Pl. 21:10). Scale 1:4. Under this designation we have assembled medium-sized, wide-necked jugs (neck ca. 5 cm long; diameter 8.5-10.5 cm) with a handle from rim to shoulder and a globular body. In many cases the 111</page><page sequence="120">neck is slightly concave, and in most instances the rim is either simple or slightly thickened; some have a short inverted shelf rim. Jugs from a wide chro- nological range (Strata IV-II) and of various fabrics were included under this definition and the group is not homogeneous. Many examples are rather small sherds for which exact definition of the form was not possible. Such jugs begin to appear in Stratum IV, with 20 examples registered, though most of these come from insecure contexts and this is essentially not a viable Stratum IV type. This type becomes especially common in Stratum III, when it is the most frequent jug. The only complete example preserved (PL 21:10, from the destruction debris of Building 737) is 30 cm high; it appears to be somewhat larger than the average. The necks of the jugs in this stratum are often slightly concave, generally with a short shelf rim top. The body is rounded with sloping shoulders; the only preserved base is a ring base. A rather thick loop handle extends from the rim top to below the neck. Five examples had self slip and traces of ver- tical burnish lines outside. None of the examples in Strata IV or III has red slip. In Stratum II this jug is common and includes somewhat more variations of rim shape and body proportion, as opposed to the relative unity of the type in Stratum III. The closest parallels to this type were found at Ashdod, where, as at our site, similar jugs appear in a wide chronological range, from Strata X to VII: Ashdod I: Figs. 38:1; 40:18; Ashdod II-III: Figs. 42:1-2; 46:1-3; 50:16; 51:1-2; Ashdod IV: Figs. 15:1; 26:12; Ashdod V: Fig. 43:12. Note that the particular rim of our Pis. 37:3 and 74:3 (Stratum II) has par- allels at Ashdod II-III: Fig. 46:4 (Stratum VIII). A jug similar to our PL 21:10 appears at Kuntillet 'Ajrud (' Ajrud : Fig. 14:1, 3), where it is defined as a "southern coastal" type. Somewhat less similar parallels were found at several coastal sites: Qasile II: Fig. 58:7 ("Stratum VII"); Mesad Hashavyahu: Fig. 5:7 (see our PL 48:2); Ruqeish Graves: Figs. 1:R6; 2:R10 (a sim- ilarly shaped jug, though taller and with a straighter neck, used as a burial urn); Amiran 1969: PL 87:1 (a jug from Tell el-Far'ah South). A jug from Gezer Stratum VI {Gezer III: 149, PL 19:5, Gitin's Type 24) is somewhat similar to our PL 48:1. This is not a common type at Gezer, appearing only in the mid-8th century horizon. Thus, this jug may be found at southern coastal sites, with its initial appearance at Ashdod and Tel 112 Batash in the 10th-9th centuries. The type became common in the 8th century at Ashdod and Tel Batash, and variations of this shape spread to other coastal sites in the 7th century. This type manifests the relationship of Tel Batash to Ashdod, and later to Mesad Hashavyahu, during the late Iron Age II. JG 22. Wide long neck, ridged rim exterior, plain or trefoil mouth, globular body (Photo 59) Stratum IV: Pis. 9:19-20; 81:13(7); 83:4, 6, 23 Stratum III: Pis. 21:18(7), 19; 22:9, 19; 26:3, 7(7); 27:5; 29:1-2, 4-5; 88:10(7)-11; 90:16(7) Photo 59. JG 22 (PL 29:2). Scale 1:4. Under the designation "JG 22" we assembled various jugs that have some common features, though the group is quite heterogeneous. Most of these jugs are of medium size (ca. 23-25 cm high; rim diameter ca. 8-9 cm) with a long straight neck, usually inverted. Several have a trefoil mouth; below the rim exterior is a groove and a ridge. A loop handle extends from the rim top to the</page><page sequence="121">shoulder. The body, when preserved, is globular with a ring or concave disc base. There are several neck variations, such as PL 29:4, which has a straighter, shorter neck (and can be compared to some examples of JG 11, though note the rim difference). Pis. 81:13; 27:5; 88:10; 90:16 were included with this type, though they have narrower necks and a lower, less prominent ridge. This is the most common jug in Stratum IV and the second most common (after the ubiquitous JG 11) in Stratum III; five complete or almost complete examples were recovered, three of them from Locus E619, which represents an early phase of this stra- tum. In Stratum IV, 42% of these jugs are red-slipped outside. In Stratum III, 19% are so treated. Most have vertical burnish on the neck and continuous or hor- izontal hand burnish on the body. Jugs with similar general proportions or rim shape start to appear in the late Iron Age I, such as Masos II : Pis. 137:8; 148:2 (Stratum II). In 10th-8th century contexts, similar jugs are found at various sites in Judah, the Shephelah and the coast, many with red slip and vertical burnish; see Lachish V : PL 42:7 (Level V; see our PL 29:4); Beth Shemesh IV : PL LXVIL10 (Stratum II); TBM III: PL 14:6 (Stratum A); Beer-sheba II' Fig. 19:6 (Stratum IX); Beer- sheba I: PL 68:18 (Stratum II); ' Ajrud : Fig. 14:11; ' Izbet Sartah : Figs. 2 1 : 1 1 ; 22:7 (Stratum I). At Gezer, Gitin's Type 20 recalls our group ( Gezer III: 146- 147). See especially Type 20B, of which only rim sherds are presented ( Gezer III: PL 15:3, Stratum VII), and the complete jug that represents his Type 20C (ibid.: PL 19:6, Stratum VI). Gitin traces the development of this type from Iron Age I, claiming that its peak was in the 9th century. He dates his Type 21 (ibid.: 147-148; PL 19:3), with rim and body similar to our JG 22 but with a narrower, concave neck, to the 8th century. See also Ashdod //-///: Fig. 41:25 (Stratum VIII, decorated in "Ashdod Ware" style); Mevorakh: Fig. 16:1 (Stratum VII, see our PL 88:11); Tel Michal: Fig. 7.5:12-13 (Strata XIV-XII); Sa'idiyeh: Fig. 7:22 (Stratum VI), with concave rather than inverted neck. The red slip and vertical burnish found on some jugs of this type (particularly those from Locus E619, PL 29) point to it being more closely related to the decorative tradition of early Iron Age II than to that of the end of the 8th century. Indeed, this type is missing from the destruction debris of Stratum III. JG 22b. Wide short neck, thickened stepped rim and globular body Stratum IV: Pis. 5:8(?)-9; 6:15; 81:17; 84:24 Stratum III: PL 26:6 This subtype is represented by only a few exam- ples from Strata IV and III. Though these are related to the main type, they have a much shorter neck and a stepped or thickened rim. PL 26:6 has a short, slightly inverted neck (ca. 8 cm long); it has a few vertical burnish lines outside and an oval body with a ring base. This type may be compared to the upper part of a jug from the Ophel {Jerusalem, Ophel: PL 8:6). JG 16. Flaring neck with stepped rim exterior (Photo 60) Stratum III: PL 21:16, 17(?), 21(?) Stratum II: PL 37:5-6 Photo 60. JG 16 (PL 37:6). Scale 1:4. 113</page><page sequence="122">Small jugs (rim diameter ca. 3.5 cm; ca. 15-17.5 high) with a short, flaring neck and stepped rim exterior. The body is elongated and rounded, with maximum diameter below mid-body. A loop handle extends from the rim top to below the neck. The only complete Stratum III example (PL 21:16) is squatter than the Stratum II jugs and has a wide hole bored in its base after firing. PL 2 1 : 1 7 is related to this type by its rim and neck stance, though its body is more globular. PL 21:21 appears to be a variant with a wider neck. These jugs lack slip and burnish, except for three sherds from Stratum II that were self-slip- ped; one of these bore traces of vertical burnish. This type is typical of Philistia and is not paral- leled elsewhere. At Ashdod it appears in both Strata VIII and VII (Ashdod II-III: Figs. 41:21; 45:23-24, 28-29; 50:20; Ashdod IV: Figs. 20:7-9; 26:9). At Tel Miqne it appears in Stratum IB (Gitin 1995: 65, Fig. 4.5:8) and is defined as a "cooking jug"; two such vessels contained silver hoards (ibid.: 69; Golani and Sass 1998). JG 23. Wide neck with multi-ridged exterior Stratum IV: Pis. 83:24; 84:25(?) Stratum III: PL 23:4 Stratum IIIA: Pis. 88:14; 92:11 In this type we included sherds of wide-necked jugs (diameter ca. 12 cm) with multiple narrow ridges on the rim exterior. A similar feature also appears on narrow-necked jugs (JG 13, see below). No handles were preserved, and these rims could conceivably belong to vessels of Type AM 5 (see pp. 79-80). PL 92:11, the only fragment preserved below the ridged neck, is made of a whitish metallic clay and may be a late intrusion. Few of these sherds were decorated (PL 84:25 has a red band painted on the rim, but the ridged rim exterior is much shorter than the others and this is only equivocally included in this type). At Ashdod, there are similar rims (though slightly narrower) on jugs decorated in "Ashdod Ware" style: 114 Ashdod //-///: Fig. 41:22 (Stratum VIII); PL 56:25 (Stratum VII); Ashdod IV: Fig. 10:18 (Stratum IX). A small rim sherd from Gezer Stratum V ( Gezer III: 151, PL 27:7, red slip outside, Gitin's Type 29) is unique at that site, and recalls the general shape of our rim. Thus, this type of jug rim, which appears at Tel Batash in small quantities, reflects an affinity to Ashdod, where the shape was popular. JG 19. Coarse-ware wide-necked jugs (Photos 61- 62) Stratum II: PL 68:4-5 Photo 61. JG 19 (PL 68:4). Scale 1:4. These two jugs were given the designation JG 19 despite the differences between them, as a "group" rather than a type. They have in common their wide neck and thick-walled, utilitarian manufacture. PL 68:4 is a large jug (33 cm high; neck diameter 8.5 cm) with a medium-sized straight neck (9 cm long), slightly bulging under the rim exterior, which</page><page sequence="123">Photo 62. JG 19 (Pl. 68:5). Scale 1:4. is folded over to a point, forming a triangular section. The shoulders are slightly rounded, ending in a high, round carination; the sides below are almost straight, terminating in a thick, very concave disc base. A unique characteristic of this jug is its rather carelessly knife-pared exterior, indicating correction of the shape during manufacture. A thick loop handle extends from the rim top to the shoulder. No com- parisons were found for this utilitarian shape. PI. 68:5 is a large jug (29 cm high) with a short neck (5 cm long; diameter 10.5 cm) and large, globular body terminating in a very convex ring base. The ring-like rim exterior is thickened and rounded; a ridged loop handle extends from the rim top to the shoulder. A unique characteristic of this jug is its ware, which is typical of cooking pots. Traces of burning on the exterior may confirm its use for cooking, despite its jug-like base. Compare Beth Shemesh I: Pl. XV: No. 1105. Narrow-necked Jugs: JG 21, JG 18, JG 13, JG 31, JG 26, JG 14, JG 35, JG 38, JG 8a-b JG 21. Narrow, plain neck and handle from rim (Photo 63) Stratum II: Pis. 48:5, 8; 73:8 This type includes large jugs (ca. 27.5-35 cm high) characterized by a narrow, straight, plain neck (ca. 4-5.5 cm long; diameter ca. 4.5 cm), a globular or slightly ovoid body and a handle that extended from the rim to the shoulder; the two preserved bases Photo 63. JG 21 (PL 48:5). Scale 1:4. were ring bases. The rim shapes vary: PL 48:5 has a thickened rim and a somewhat shorter neck; PL 48:8 has an everted rim with a down-turning, sharp tri- angular exterior (compare the rim of the decanter in PL 96:18); it has a "double" handle. PL 73:8 has a slightly sloping neck, with narrow grooves on top, and a thickened rim; unlike the other two jugs included in this type, this jug has a trefoil mouth that is slightly distorted (note the resemblance to the neck of JG 13, though the latter is not trefoil). While the general shape of this jug is similar to JG 1 8 (see below), they were deemed separate types due to the different handle and neck stance. This type appears only in Stratum II, and only four examples were registered; none is slipped or burnished. The few parallels proposed here were chosen mostly due to the similarity of neck and rim to our PL 73:8, though many of these analogies differ in details and date: TBM III: PL 16:9 (Stratum A); Beer-sheba I: PL 64:11 (Stratum II); M. Aharoni 1981: Fig. 5:11 (Arad Stratum XII); Arad: Fig. 22:9 (Stratum VIII); Aroer: Fig. 6:4 (Stratum II). These are all from Judean sites; some are earlier than the jugs from Tel Batash and others are from 7th century contexts. The 115</page><page sequence="124">narrow neck and trefoil mouth appear to have been a known trait in this region in the latter part of the Iron Age II, representing a jug type found alongside the popular ridged-neck decanter. The jugs included in this type, like those included in JG 1 8 (see below), reflect the variety of the pottery industry in Stratum II. Though of similar general concept, these jugs differ from one another in details, demonstrating a measure of freedom from pre- conceptions and mass production. JG 18. Narrow ridged neck and elongated globular body (Photo 64) Stratum II: Pis. 49:4(?)-5; 68:3 Photo 64. JG 18 (PL 49:5). Scale 1:4. This category includes large, thick-walled jugs (28-35 cm high) with narrow ridged necks (4.5-6 cm long), handles extending from the ridge to the shoulder and elongated globular or ovoid bodies; all have ring bases. PI. 49:4 has a slightly wider neck; its upper neck and rim are missing. PI. 49:5 has its maximum diameter just above mid-body and is more lentoid; above the ridge the neck flares to a thickened rim. PI. 68:3 has a straight neck and a prominent 116 ridge just below the rim exterior; it has narrow grooves on its upper shoulder. Apart from the three vessels presented in the plates, seven sherds were registered with this type, all from Stratum II and lacking slip and burnish. Few comparisons were found for this shape, most from the latter part of the Iron Age II: Ashdod IV : Fig. 20:10 (Stratum VII); Beer-sheba /: PL 62:100, 103 (Stratum II); Lachish III : PL 87:254 (Level III); ' Ajrud : Fig. 14:4. The narrow grooves incised on the upper shoulder of our PL 68:3 appears on some 8th- 7th century jugs from the north, e.g. Megiddo I: Pis. 2:66; 4:109 (Strata III-II); Samaria III: Fig. 10:15, 17 (Period VI); Beth Shean, Area P (8th century, unpublished). The few such jugs found in Stratum II imply that this was a local product that emulated the popular decanter neck shape, manufactured to fulfill specific needs. JG 13. Narrow neck and multi-ridged rim exterior Stratum IV: Pis. 8:9(?); 81:16(?) Stratum III: Pis. 21:23; 23:5(7); 26:12; 27:19(?) Stratum IIIA: PL 90:17 Stratum II: PL 61:7(?) These are sherds of narrow-necked jugs (rim diameter ca. 5.5-6 cm), with a multi-ridged rim exterior, sometimes wider than the short, narrow neck below it. The rim top is generally straight, but may also be slightly everted (e.g. PL 21:23). A loop handle extends from the ridged rim exterior to the top of the sloping shoulder. Since no complete examples have been preserved, the complete shape is un- known. Only two examples of this type were registered in Stratum IV, both of which are typologically unsure, and this should not be considered a Stratum IV type. This is not a common jug type in Strata III-II. Pis. 23:5 and 81:16 have red slip and burnish, while the other examples are undecorated.</page><page sequence="125">The closest parallels to this type were found at Ashdod Stratum VIII ( Ashdod I : Figs. 39:7; Ashdod II-III: Figs. 45:30; 50:19; Ashdod IV: Fig. 14:6). Somewhat similar shapes, though larger and with less prominent ridges, were found in Stratum VII there {Ashdod I: Figs. 40:17; 41:16, both recalling our PI. 61:7; Ashdod //-///: PI. 56:29-30). See also similar profiles, with long or short necks, from Tell Jemmeh {Jemmeh: PI. LVII:58c, 58e). Jugs from Arad Strata X-IX have a similar rim profile, though with a trefoil mouth {Arad: Figs. 12:12; 18:7). One such rim was found at Gezer Stratum V {Gezer III: 150, PI. 27:5, Gitin's Type 28). Compare also a jug from Samaria, which was deemed "a water decanter with a peculiar ribbed rim" {Samaria III: Fig. 22:11, Periods V-VI, decorated with black and red painted bands). Indeed, the narrow neck of JG 13 is remi- niscent of the decanter typical of this period, espe- cially the (single) grooved rims of the northern decanters (see our JG 14). However, JG 13 differs in its multiple grooves and handle placement. JG 31. Jugs/flasks with narrow neck, globular body and "Ashdod Ware" decoration Stratum IV: Pis. 8:6; 9:11; 12:16; 79:10, 15; 81:20; 85:16 PI. 79:10 is a body and neck fragment of a large globular jug, red-slipped with black and white con- centric circles on the body; only a few burnish lines remain. The double ridged handle extends from mid- neck to the upper shoulder. Such jugs appear from the mid- 11th century at sites such as Megiddo Stratum VIA {Megiddo II: PI. 80:1-3) and Tell Qasile Stratum X {Qasile II: PI. 41:13; see discussion on pp. 67-68, with further references in note 141). Similar globular jugs with black and white decoration on a red slip are known from late 11th and 10th century contexts: Keisan: PI. 62:6 (Stratum 9); Masos II: Pis. 142:8; 145:1; 148:1 (a large jug from Stratum II with a Maltese cross and lattice motif); Qasile II: Fig. 41:11 (Stratum X). They appear alongside jugs of similar form that are deco- rated in black and red or red alone on a buff slip, the typical Phoenician Bichrome technique {Qasile II: 67-69, 84-85). These jugs are typical of the earliest Phoenician pottery forms. Our jug was found in a Stratum IV locus (H995) that can be dated to the early 10th century; it may have been either an import from Phoenicia or a local product emulating the Phoenician shape. It appears that the decoration on our jug was inspired from the black paint on red slip style that appeared during the 11th century in Philistia and continued into the Iron Age II, with particularly late (8th century) manifes- tations at Ashdod. Globular jugs with similar deco- ration appear in Cyprus as part of the earliest Phoenician pottery there as well (Bikai's "Kouklia horizon," dated 1050-850 BCE; Bikai 1987: PI. Ill, Nos. 17, 19). Several body sherds from Stratum IV (Pis. 9:11; 12:16; 79:15; 81:20; 85:16) probably belong to similar globular jugs or flasks, all bearing variations of the "Ashdod Ware" decoration; the exterior is red- slipped and painted with horizontal or concentric black and white lines, and burnish covers the slip. JG 26. Narrow ridged neck and globular body (Photo 65) Stratum IV: PI. 12:8 Stratum III: PI. 88:12 Small jugs (rim and neck diameter 3.5 cm; PI. 88:12, the only complete example, is 17 cm high); the long narrow neck has a ridge in its center; the flat rim top is slightly thickened. The body is round, with a small ring base. A loop handle extends from the ridge to the shoulder. This is a very rare type at our site, represented only by the two examples shown in the plates; PI. 12:8 comes from an uncertain context (a fill under- 117</page><page sequence="126">Photo 65. JG 26 (Pl. 88:12). Scale 1:4. lying a fill). Both jugs are red-slipped and burnished; PL 12:8 has several horizontal black lines painted on the neck above the ridge. Jugs of a generally similar shape appear as early as 11th century contexts, such as Masos II : PI. 135:11 (Stratum II); PI. 139:10 (Stratum I); 'Izbet Sartah : Fig. 19:7 (Stratum II); Qasile II : 63 (Type Jug 2), Fig. 49:7 (Stratum X); all but one lack the neck ridge. The neck ridge becomes more common in the 10th century (ibid.: 63). Narrow ridged necks were a popular feature on the globular jugs and flasks decorated in the Phoenician Bichrome technique ( Qasile II: 67-69; Amiran 1969: 270-271, PL 91:1, 5-8). A jug of similar general concept made of Phoenician Bichrome ware, in an assemblage dated from the mid- 10th to the mid-9th centuries, should be mentioned (H. Rosh Zayit : Fig. 8:2). A jug with a slightly wider neck from Tyre Stratum X is dated to the mid-9th century (Bikai 1978: PL XXV:7). Jugs with a similar shape are common in 10th-9th century contexts such as Beth Shemesh IV: PL LXV:42 (Stratum lib, though with a flaring rim and wider lower body); M. Aharoni 1981: Fig. 3:6 (Arad Stratum XII); Arad: Fig. 5:8; ' Ajrud : 170; Fig. 14:4- 7; Ashdod IV: Fig. 11:2 (Stratum IX, "Ashdod Ware"); Ashdod II-III: Fig. 41:24 (Stratum VIII); Tel Michal: Fig. 7.3:3 (Stratum XIII, decorated with red, black and white concentric circles); Megiddo I: PL 7:171, 172 (Stratum V). This jug is a Phoenician-inspired type. Analogies dated to the 10th-9th centuries indicate a rather wide distribution for similarly shaped jugs. The jug from Tel Batash Stratum III and that from Ashdod Stratum VIII are among the latest appearances of this shape in the south. 118 JG 14. "Decanters" (Photo 66) Stratum III: PL 21:22(7), 26(?) Stratum II: Pis. 37:1; 48:9; 49:1-2; 55:12-13; 59:6-7; 61:8; 74:1; 96:16 Photo 66. JG 14 (PI. 96:16). Scale 1:4. Medium-sized to large jugs, averaging 30-38 cm high and ca. 20-25 cm in maximum body diameter; smaller examples exist, such as PL 37:1, which is 21.5 cm high with a maximum body diameter of 13 cm. The body proportions of the Tel Batash decant- ers are varied: most are tall, widening towards the base (e.g. Pis. 48:9 and 55:12), though squatter (e.g. Pis. 37:1 and 49:1) and narrower (PL 74:1) versions exist as well. The straight, narrow neck (ca. 5-7.5 cm long; average diameter 3.5 cm) bears a distinctive ridge in its center. The sloping shoulders are cari- nated above straight sides, which often widen near an additional carination above the base; the lower cari-</page><page sequence="127">nation is usually rounder than the shoulder angle. The base is a ring base. A loop handle, either ridged in the center or flat with a depression in the center, extended from the ridge on the neck to above the shoulder carination. Only five sherds were registered with this type in Stratum III; essentially, this type is non-existent in this stratum. It is not a common type in Stratum II. The rim variations at Tel Batash include: a. Everted rim with a narrow triangular exterior (e.g. PI. 96:16). Compare Sahab : Fig. 6:57; Samaria III : Figs. 9:5; 10:17 (Period VI). b. Everted rim with thickened exterior, round or truncated (e.g. PI. 61:8): this rim is the closest to the everted, rounded rims typical of the Judean decant- ers, e.g. Lachish III : 274-276, PI. 87, Tufiiell's Class J.8 (Level II); Beer-sheba /: PI. 62:99-100, 102 (Stratum II); En-Gedi : Fig. 9:7-10 (Stratum V); H. Shilhah : Fig. 7b:3. c. "Funnel-shaped" concave rim interior with grooved (e.g. PL 37:1) or rounded (e.g. Pis. 55:13; 59:6-7) rim exterior. This is the typical rim of the northern decanters; Megiddo I : PI. 4:99-108 (though with different body proportions); Hazor I: PI. LXIV:20 (Stratum VII). d. A unique, strongly everted, rounded "mush- room-shaped" rim top (PI. 48:9). This is an excep- tional form, perhaps inspired by the Phoenician "mushroom" jugs (e.g. Amiran 1969: PI. 92:10-12; Bikai 1978: Pl. V14-17, Tyre Stratum III). The decanter was one of the most popular jugs in the country from the 8th century until the end of the Iron Age, with significant regional differences between northern (Amiran 1969: 259, PI. 88:1-4) and southern ("Judean") forms (ibid.: 262, Pl. 89:1-4; Gitin in Gezer III: 154). At Lachish, the decanter did not become common until after the destruction of Level III; while the prototypes do appear in the latter stratum, it predominates in Lachish Level II {Lachish III : 292-293; Zimhoni 1990: 44-46). At Beth She- mesh too, the decanter is rare in Stratum lib and becomes frequent in Stratum lie (Beth Shemesh V: 140-141). However, at Arad decanters appear from Stratum X ( Arad : Fig. 12:11) to Stratum VIII (ibid.: Fig. 22:12), where they are wide and squat, as opposed to the taller narrower version found in Strata VII and VI (ibid.: Figs. 25:11; 29:8).30 At Samaria they were very rare in Period IV, when they were introduced, and became a little more common in Period V and very frequent in Period VI (Samaria III: 95-96, 124). The typical Judean decanters usually have an everted rim with a truncated or rounded end; only a few of the Tel Batash decanters had such a rim (e.g. PL 61:8). Characteristic of the northern decanters are the funnel-like, grooved rim and squatter body pro- portions. The pinched rim exterior of our Pl. 37:1 somewhat recalls this grooved outer rim, while the concave rim interior of most of the Tel Batash decanters is similar to the funnel-like effect of the typical northern decanter rim. A good parallel to the exterior rim shape of Pl. 37:1 may be found at Tel Miqne Stratum IB, though the neck of the latter is longer (Gitin 1989a: Fig. 2.13:17). Like the exam- ples from Tel Batash, the jug from Tel Miqne fea- tures the combination of northern rim shape and taller Judean body shape. Thus, most of the decanters from Tel Batash are of hybrid form: their rims resemble northern types while their body shape resembles Judean prototypes. This is an enigmatic feature, especially in light of the earlier date of the northern type (generally common until no later than the late 8th century), as opposed to the 7th century presence of this type at Tel Batash.31 This hybrid form appears to be a product of the particular pottery industry of the Tel Miqne/Tel Batash sphere in the 7th century, though the decanter is not a common type at late Iron Age II Batash. The question of the origin of this northern influence remains open; might it reflect an influx of population from the north after the fall of Samaria? The function of the decanters can be inferred from the two vessels (from Lachish and a jug in the private collection of R. Hecht) whose inscriptions indicate that they contained wine (Ussishkin 1978b: 83, 88; Inscriptions Reveal : No. 103). JG 14a. Small narrow "decanters" (Photo 67) Stratum II: Pis. 59:9; 95:11; 96:17 This subtype is represented only by the examples shown in the plates. It is a small, juglet-sized vessel, with a narrow disc or ring base; the narrow body stance is reminiscent of the double carination found 119</page><page sequence="128">Photo 67. JG 14a (Pl. 96:17). Scale 1:4. on decanters. The only complete profile preserved (Pl. 96:17) shows a short, slightly curved neck with a flat-sectioned handle extending from the rim to the carinated shoulder. Though the only neck preserved has no ridge, the general shape of this small jug should be compared to what Amiran called a "distant variation on the decanter theme," with a slender shape, which appears at the end of the Iron Age at southern sites (Amiran 1969: 262, Photo 260, from Ain Tuba). M. and Y. Aharoni included this shape in their 7th century assemblage, terming it a "small, degenerate water decanter with a flat base" (Aharoni and Aharoni 1976: 86, Fig. 7:7, from Arad, Strata VII-VI); see also Jerusalem, the City of David (Shiloh 1985: Fig. 6:12-15); Lachish III : PI. 87:277, 278 (Level II); Zimhoni 1990: Fig. 34:1-7 (Lachish Level II); Tel ' Ira: 19; Fig. 6.52:9 (Stratum VI). This vessel is an additional link between the pottery repertoire of Tel Batash Stratum II and the Judean assemblages typical of the very end of the Iron Age II. JG 35. "Inserted" ridged neck and trefoil mouth (Photo 68) Stratum II: PL 74:4-5 These two jugs, the only examples of this type at Tel Batash, were found together in the destruction debris on the floor of Building F607 of Stratum II ( Timnah /: 242-244). PI. 74:5 is 17.5 cm high, while 120 Photo 68. JG 35 (PL 74:4). Scale 1:4. PL 74:4 is 25.6 cm high. The long neck is straight or slightly inverted until just above its center, where there is a prominent ridge. The neck above the ridge flares and was apparently inserted after the bottom part of the neck was formed; the mouth is trefoil. The handle extends from above the ridge down to the shoulder. The body is globular, with the smaller jug (PL 74:5) having more sloping shoulders. The larger jug (PL 74:4) has a ring base, as opposed to the flat base of PL 74:5. Both lack slip or burnish. These finely made jugs appear to imitate metal vessels {Jerusalem, Ophel : 17). PL 96:15, which lacks the trefoil mouth, has a similar neck (see below, p. 124). This jug type is well known in Judean assemb- lages of the 7th century. See for example Lachish V : PL 47:23-24; Lachish III : PL 86:238, 246, 248-249 (Tuinell's Class J.7b; note also PL 87:263); Jer- usalem , Ophel : Fig. 3:7 (from Locus 23041); En- Gedi : Fig. 9:11 (Stratum V, horizontal burnish on body, vertical burnish on neck); Arad : Fig. 25:9 (Stratum VII); Aroer : Fig. 5:4 (Stratum II); Tel Ira : 219, Fig. 6:43 (Stratum VI); Gibeon : Fig. 47:11. Thus, this jug is found exclusively at Judean sites in 7th century contexts, with Gibeon the northern- most and Tel Batash the westernmost sites at which it appears, albeit in very small quantities. Most of the parallels are self-slipped and burnished, while our jugs are not. The fact that only two such jugs were found in the rich destruction assemblages of Stratum II may point to a limited trade in finer table ware with Judean centers at this time (the same may be said of JG 38 below). However, if this is so, the lack of slip and burnish on the Tel Batash jugs is notable.</page><page sequence="129">JG 38. Short flaring ridged neck and bag-shaped body Stratum II: Pis. 74:8; 98:5 Small jugs, in fact juglets in their dimensions (li- li. 5 cm high), with a flaring narrow neck that has a small ridge just above its join to the shoulder. The body is rounded; PL 98:5 has more sloping shoulders and a wide flat disc base with an untrimmed lump of clay in the center. Prominent wheel marks are visible inside. A round handle extends from the rim top to the shoulder. The two vessels shown in the plates are the only examples of such vessels at our site. The few comparable vessels are similar in general concept, though differing in details. All of the fol- lowing have a handle from the neck ridge rather than from the rim: Lachish III : Pl. 87:268 (Tufhell's Class J.7a); TBM III: Pl. 16:2-3 (Stratum A); Arad : Fig. 29:7 (Stratum VI); En-Gedi : Fig. 31:4, 7-8 (the Clark Collection). These parallels, though not very close, indicate that this is an exclusively Judean shape that may be found mainly in the late Iron Age II. JG 8a-b. Small narrow-necked jugs In this category we have included variations of small narrow-necked jugs (neck diameter ca. 5-6.5 cm) from Strata IV-III. None was preserved below the neck, so the entire body stance is unknown. It appears to have been rather small and relatively delicate. No handles were preserved. This is a het- erogeneous group, represented only by the examples shown in the plates. Some of the sherds included in this group could belong to other closed vessels, such as bottles or juglets. The following subtypes were determined by their differing rims: JG 8a. Small jugs with everted rim Strata IV-III PL 8:7 Stratum IVA: Pl. 9:12 Strata IV-III: Pl. 11:9 Stratum III: PL 26:9 Stratum IIIA: Pl. 90:18(?) The common features of this subgroup are plain, everted rims above a narrow, straight neck; however, the five examples in the plates differ from one another in details. Several of these rims, which were mostly small fragments, were found in fills and mixed debris (e.g. Pis. 8:7; 11:9). A few were red- slipped and burnished; Pl. 9:12 also has a black horizontal line painted on the neck. The fragmentary nature and insecure stratigraphy of these sherds make it difficult to find valid comparisons. JG 8b. Small jugs with concave rim interior Stratum IV: Pis. 11:18; 85:17 Stratum III: Pis. 21:24-25; 26:5 These sherds were grouped together since they have the common feature of a short, concave rim interior and a plain rounded exterior. The examples from Stratum III belong to somewhat larger vessels. Pl. 11:18 has a wide handle extending just below the rim exterior, and is red-slipped and burnished out- side. Jugs with a concave inner rim may be found at several sites in Iron Age I and early Iron Age II contexts, e.g. Qasile II : Fig. 14:22 (Stratum XII); Fig. 50:17 (Stratum X); 'Izbet Sartah: Fig. 17:13-15 (Stratum II); Masos II: Pis. 135:10; 136:14 (Stratum 121</page><page sequence="130">II); Pl. 132:17 (Stratum I); Gezer III : Pl. 5:15 (Stratum XI, defined as a "cooking jug"); PI. 8:3 (Stratum VIII, similar to our PI. 85:17). Thus, this may be considered a profile that began as early as the 12th century and continued into early Iron Age II. The few Stratum III examples at Tel Batash are very small sherds. Some of the small sherds included in this group may be strays that originated in earlier contexts. Strainer Jugs Stratum V/IVB: PL 11:16 Unstratified: PI. 11:19 Strainer jugs, which are found at Tel Batash in Stratum V ( Timnah III : JG 7), are very rare in Stra- tum IV, appearing only in its lowest levels. PI. 11:16 comes from ashy debris below the lowest level of a Stratum IV fill and thus may be considered very early in the Stratum IV sequence, actually related to the transition between Strata V and IVB. Pl. 11:19 is unstratified (found during balk cleaning) and was included on typological grounds. PI. 11:16 has narrow, carinated sloping shoulders, with straight sides flaring below. Only the holes of the strainer have been preserved, and the imprint of the join of the spout to the body remains. The jug is red-slipped, with two horizontal white bands on the upper shoulder and traces of black lines as well. PI. 11:19 has a biconical body with an elongated spout above mid-body; it is red-slipped with a few vertical burnish lines. Groups of black horizontal bands are painted above and below the strainer, and black hatches adorn the strainer's rim. The decoration on both of these examples is characteristic of the so- called "Ashdod Ware." Strainer jugs, usually with basket or loop handles extending from the neck, are found mainly in 11th century contexts (Amiran 1969: 251, 256; Pis. 84:10-11; 85:10-11). Jug Type 5 at Tell Qasile includes profiles similar to ours (e.g. Qasile II : Fig. 50:1-2, Stratum X). Jugs with strainer spouts may be found in 10th- 8th century contexts, though they are much less frequent and have profiles that differ from the Iron Age I types. It appears that the Iron Age II manu- facturers occasionally added strainers to some jug forms of their time. See for example Lachish III : PI. 89:359, 361-364 (red-slipped and vertically bur- nished jugs from a 9th century tomb and from Level III); TBMI : PI. 70:13 (Stratum A); Beth Shemesh IV: PI. LXV:36 (Stratum II). 122 Thus, while the two strainer jugs included in this section are typologically more similar to 1 1th century examples such as those from Qasile (see above), there is evidence that strainer jugs did continue into the Iron Age II. The "Ashdod Ware" decoration on our jugs does little to refine the chronological determination, as such treatment begins in the late 11th century and continues as late as the 8th century at Ashdod. Basket-handled Jugs Stratum IVB: Pl. 2:25 Stratum IV: Pl. 83:9 The only two examples of basket-handled jugs have narrow, slightly concave necks and small, round-sectioned basket handles. Such handles are found in Stratum V (see Timnah III: JG 6a). PL 2:25 was found in the lowest level of Stratum IV and thus is very early in the sequence. The basket handle is a well-known appendage in the Iron Age I (Amiran 1969: 251; Qasile II: 64-65, 95-98). However, it virtually disappears after the 10th century. The few examples found that postdate the Iron Age I include Beer-sheba II: Fig. 19:7 (Stratum IX) and Megiddo II: Pl. 88:19 (Stratum VA). Varia The very heterogeneous nature of the jugs from the Iron Age II levels at Tel Batash made classification a difficult task. Thus, the "Varia" category of jugs is larger than that of any other class and includes sev- eral complete vessels. Stratum IV PL 1:20. A small jug (10.5 cm high) with a straight neck (3.5 cm long), globular body and small ring base; a loop handle extends from the rim top to the shoulder. The vessel is covered with a somewhat streaky red slip (but not burnished) and decorated with black and white horizontal bands at mid-body</page><page sequence="131">on top of the slip. For this decorative technique, see JG 3 1 ; no close parallels to this jug were found. PL 11:17. A fragment of a long, very slightly swollen neck with a small rounded rim top; only the top of the rounded shoulders have been preserved. The jug is red-slipped outside. A similar rim and neck may be seen on a juglet with red slip and ver- tical burnish from Tel Michal, where it was deemed typical of the Shephelah region ( Tel Michal : Fig. 7.3:8, Stratum XIII). Stratum III Pl. 21:20. A small jug (the ca. two thirds of the vessel preserved are 7.5 cm high) whose short, wide neck (diameter 7 cm) has a sharp ridge at mid-neck. The vessel is preserved to below its short, rounded shoulders. The jug has a self slip covered with shiny, rather thick vertical burnish lines. No parallels were found, though the neck ridge is a known feature on other jugs of this period. Pl. 26:11. A body sherd of a globular jug covered with a highly polished self slip, painted with two horizontal dark brown lines on either side of a light reddish brown band. Traces of a handle are preserved. Pl. 29:3 (Photo 69). A small jug (10.5 cm high) with a long, straight wide neck (5 cm long) and short globular body with a small concave disc base. A thick loop handle extends from the rim top to the bottom of the neck and top of the shoulder. The vessel is red-slipped. This jug was found in Locus E619, which was attributed to an early phase of Stratum III. The shape recalls that of Pl. 1 :20 from Stratum IV. An almost exact parallel may be seen at Ashdod IV: Fig. 44:9 (Stratum X, red slip and bur- nish outside). Another very similar parallel comes from Megiddo Stratum V ( Megiddo II: PI. 88:5). The above parallels date to the 10th century, which sup- ports our attribution of Locus E619 to an inter- mediate phase between Strata IV and III. Photo 69. Jug, varia (PL 29:3). Scale 1:4. Pl. 88:7. This is a small rim sherd of a straight- necked jug with a stepped rim exterior. Note the similarity to some of the examples of JG 22. Though it is extremely fragmentary, it may perhaps be com- pared to the following jug sherds: Samaria III: Fig. 9:6 (Period VI) and Hazor I: Pl. LXXIIL1 (Stratum V). Pl. 88:9. A small rim sherd of a wide, vertical- necked jug (?) with thickened rim exterior (see M. Aharoni 1981: Fig. 7:6, Arad Stratum XI). Pl. 93:9. A very slightly curved neck with a thick- ened round rim top. Stratum II Pl. 36:6 (Photo 70). A large jug (40 cm high) with a straight neck (8 cm long; diameter 9 cm) with a sharp ridge in its center, and a flaring tapering rim top. The rounded, sloping shoulders are carinated, with straight sides descending to a round carination near the small ring base. The general body stance is reminiscent of JG 14 (the decanter). The uniqueness of this vessel lies in its handles: a loop handle Photo 70. Jug, varia (Pl. 36:6). Scale 1 :4. 123</page><page sequence="132">extends from the rim top to mid-shoulder, while two additional loop handles are located below the shoulder carination to mid-body. The concept of a "jar-jug" with a handle extend- ing from its trefoil rim in additional to the two handles at mid-body is known during the Iron Age I, for example Qasile II: Fig. 49:1; Shiloh : 172, Fig. 6.53:10; Mt. Ebal (Zertal 1986-1987: 133, Fig. 14:1); Qiri: Fig. 45:9, but disappears during the Iron Age II. Our vessel is unique in shape and, like other unique vessels from Stratum II, demonstrates the creativity of the 7th century potters in our region. The arrangement of handles was probably a func- tional one to facilitate pouring; yet the idea was not repeated in any other vessel of the period. Pl. 37:4. This is the almost complete profile of a jug with a wide trefoil mouth and vertical, slightly thickened, rim. Its relatively wide long neck is set on short sloping shoulders ending in a sharp carination. It can be regarded as a variant of JG 16. Pl. 50:12. This small sherd includes part of the body and the beginning of a double handle of either a jug or a flask. It is made of whitish clay with many rough inclusions; the underside of the handle has a "cross- hatched" design, crudely executed in a transparent blackish-brown paint. A close parallel to this motif was found at Taanach in a Persian period pit (Pit 7), though the paint was a weak red ( Taanach I: Fig. 77:5). PI. 59:4. The neck and shoulders of a closed vessel, possibly a handleless jug with a very narrow neck (6 cm long; diameter 5 cm) and an everted tapering rim top; the rounded shoulders are sloping. PI. 74:9. The neck, handle and shoulders of a small squat jug with a wide neck and short rounded shoulders; the handle extends from rim to shoulder. The general shape recalls that of the so-called "cooking jugs," though it is small and is not made of cooking pot ware. PL 96:15. The neck and upper shoulders of a thin- walled, finely made jug, with a sharp ridge in the middle of the concave neck; the flat-sectioned handle extends from the rim top to the shoulder. Shiny vertical burnish lines cover a self slip on the neck, with a few horizontal burnish lines on the shoulders. This shape recalls that of JG 35 (see above), though 124 the neck is wider and does not have the typical insertion of the upper part of that jug. The ridge at mid-neck is reminiscent of the decanters typical of this period (see JG 14 ). Note also the similarity to PI. 36:6, the three-handled jug discussed above. A somewhat similar jug, though with a trefoil mouth, was found at En-Gedi ( En-Gedi : Fig. 20:7, Stratum V). Compare also Mesad Hashavyahu : Fig. 5:6 and Adoni Nur : Fig. 22:107 (7th century).

Iron Age II typology: juglets. base is generally wide and rounded, though some are tapering. A loop handle extends from the rim to the shoulder. This is one of the few pottery types that exist throughout Strata IV-II. In Stratum IV it is virtually the only type of juglet (though it is only sparsely represented in the plates). 60% of these were red- slipped and vertically burnished, one had self slip and some had red slip on the inner neck as well. In Stratum III, 40% were red-slipped; none were so treated in Stratum II. PI. 74:13 is a small variation. Such juglets start to appear in Iron Age I (see Timnah III) and continue through the 10th-9th cen- turies (Lahav Tomb : Figs. 8:12; 9:21; TBM I: PI. 51:12, Stratum B3) and into the 8th century, e.g. in Lachish Level III (Zimhoni 1990: Fig. 6:4-6; Lachish V: PI. 45:2); Beer-sheba /: PI. 62:115-119 (Stratum II); Ashdod I : Fig. 37:24 (Stratum VIII). For 7th century parallels, see Lachish V : PL 47:27 (Stratum II); En-Gedi : Fig. 19:8-9 (Stratum V; note also Fig. 30:14-15, with red slip, from the Clark Collection).

The longevity of this type shows that the body proportions have virtually no chronological sig- nificance during the course of the Iron Age II, but rather there are a number of variations in shape that reflect different production lines and perhaps regional and/or functional nuances. This was a basic, utilitarian shape that underwent little development over the years. JT 7b. Short body, trefoil pinched mouth (Photo 72) Stratum IVA: Pl. 8:10 Strata IV-III: PL 11:10 Stratum II: Pis. 38:3; 69:5; 95:10 Photo 72. JT 7b (PI. 69:5). Scale 1:4. 125</page><page sequence="134">Small juglets (11.5-13.5 cm high) with a medium-sized flaring neck (neck ca. 3-4 cm long) and a trefoil or pinched mouth; the rim top is tapering or rounded. The shoulders are rounded or sloping; a loop handle extends from the rim top to the shoulder. All are undecorated. In Strata IV-III, this juglet is represented only by the two fragments shown in the plates, of which only the upper part was preserved. They probably had a short body and a wide round base (based on com- parison to our subtype JT 7a and parallels; see below). In Stratum II, five examples were found. The lower part of the body either tapers towards the base (PL 38:3) or is wide and rounded (PL 69:5). The latter juglet is exceptional in its aperture, which is blocked with a strainer. The specific trait of a trefoil or pinched rim sets this subtype apart. Juglets of similar shape were common in the Iron Age I (e.g. Qasile II : Figs. 15:8; 30:17; 52:5; Ashdod IV : Fig. 3:9). This shape con- tinues into the early Iron Age II, with a wide round base: Amiran 1969: PL 86:14; M. Aharoni 1981: Fig. 7:17 (Arad Stratum XI); Lachish V: PL 42:10 (Level V); 'Izbet Sartah : Fig. 21:9 (Stratum I); Tel Michal : Fig. 7.3:6-7 (Stratum XIII); Megiddo II: PL 87:14 (Stratum VB). Trefoil-mouthed dipper juglets are quite common in the 9th-8th centuries: Lachish III : PL 88:300-302 (Tufnell's Class D.l, dated to the 9th century); PL 88: 282, Tufhell's Class D.5, Level III); Samaria III : Fig. 1:7 (Period I); Fig. 10:22 (Period VI); Beth Shemesh III : Fig. 5:3-50; Beth Shemesh IV : PL LXIV:42 (Stratum Ha). Despite the claim that trefoil-rim juglets disappear after the 10th or 9th centuries (Albright in TBM III: 148-149; M. Aharoni 1981: 189), it appears that such juglets continued in use until the 7th century at a few southern sites, though they were not common. In addition to our examples from Stratum II, compare En-Gedi: 55; Figs. 9:5; 30:17-18; also Tufnell in Lachish III: 295. The appearance of such a mouth on several juglets in late 7th century contexts at Tel Batash may be an indicator of the relative independence of the local pottery tradition at the end of the Iron Age. JT 7c. Juglets with elongated cylindrical body (Photo 73) Stratum III: PL 21:27 Stratum II: Pis. 38:5-6; 50:6-8; 55:16; 69:6; 74:14- 16 126 Photo 73. JT 7c (left PL 38:5; right PL 38:6). Scale 1:4. Medium-sized to large juglets (ca. 17-21 cm high) with a narrow elongated cylindrical body. The nar- row neck (ca. 4-4.5 cm long) is straight or slightly flaring and the base is rounded, sometimes with a slight tapering on the bottom. A loop handle extends from the rim to the sloping shoulder. Juglets were included in this type only when enough of the body shape is known to determine whether they are elongated, since the upper parts of some of them are similar to that of JT 7a (see above). This is the most common juglet in both Strata III and II. Comparisons to the general shape and proportions of this type may be found at various sites, mainly in the south; the earlier examples are sometimes red slipped and burnished. See for example TBM III: PL 18:16 (Stratum A); Aharoni and Aharoni 1976: Fig. 4:15 (from Beer-sheba Stratum II); Ashdod //-///: Fig. 45:31-32 (Stratum VIII); Megiddo II: PL 88:13 (Stratum VA). In Stratum II the body is usually even longer and narrower than in the previous stratum, and the tran- sition from neck to shoulder is more often empha- sized. This particular development may be con- sidered a local feature confined to the Tel Batash-Tel Miqne region (see Gitin 1995: Fig. 4.9:6, defined by Gitin as a "Judean" type). 18 complete or almost complete examples and 20 additional fragments were found.</page><page sequence="135">Thus, the beginning of the elongated cylindrical juglet may be traced back to as early as the 9th-8th centuries, when it is sometimes red-slipped and burnished. An even more elongated, narrower ver- sion of the cylindrical juglet, mainly undecorated, was common at Tel Batash and Tel Miqne in the 7th century, where such juglets possibly played a role in the oil industry; these were found both in domestic and industrial contexts at Tel Batash. JT 9. Small juglets with narrow neck and swollen body ("black juglets") (Photo 74) Stratum III: PL 29:18 Stratum IIIA: PL 93:20 Stratum II: PL 38:7 Small juglets (ca. 9 cm high) with a narrow, Photo 74. JT 9 (PL 29:18). Scale 1:4. straight or slightly flaring neck (2.5 cm long: diam- eter ca. 1.5 cm) and plain rim top. The rounded body is squat, with narrow sloping shoulders and some- what flattened sides. PL 29:18 of Stratum III (from constructional fill E307c), with a very rounded body and a loop handle from the mid-neck to the shoulder, is typical of the early to mid-Iron Age II (Amiran 1969: 256). The only complete juglet of this type found in Stratum II, PL 38:7, is quite large, with a somewhat tapering neck and a more ovoid body. The button base is somewhat more pronounced. A round loop handle extends from the rim top to the sloping shoulder. PL 55:17 is an exceptionally small example and is discussed with the miniature vessels (see pp. 135-136). This is a very infrequent type at Tel Batash. None was found in Stratum IV. Only four examples were registered in Stratum III and three in Stratum II. Two of the examples in Stratum III have black slip and vertical burnish and one has a light red slip and vertical burnish; in Stratum II, one has red slip and vertical burnish, one has self slip and vertical burnish and one (PL 55:17, which is considered votive due to its very small size) has black slip and a highly pol- ished burnish. Such juglets appear in black or dark gray clay with burnished black slip, but also appear in buff or brown clays with a light red or self slip and burnish (Amiran 1969: 256). It is a well-known type in Iron Age II assemblages, both domestic and funerary (e.g. TBM III: 151-152; Lachish III : 301-303, Tufnell's Class D.7-8). This type became popular in the 10th century, when it had a long neck and handle from mid-neck. It was very common during the 9th-8th centuries, mostly in Judah (Zimhoni 1990: 13), but also in the north (e.g. Megiddo I: Pis. 2:49-56; 5:126-128, 136, Strata IV-II; Samaria III : Fig. 10:24, Period VI) and along the coast (e.g. Ashdod II-III: 95, Fig. 38:7, Stratum VIII, though it is rare at Ashdod; Tel Michal: Fig. 7.3:9, Stratum XIII). It is also represented in Transjordan (Sa ' idiyeh : Fig. 5:10, Stratum VII; Fig. 11:8-10, Stratum V). Though it has been claimed that this juglet is absent from Judean 7th century assemblages (Aharoni and Aharoni 1976: 84), it does appear in some 7th century contexts mainly in the south, though usually with a smaller body and a handle drawn from the rim (Amiran 1969: 263); Beth Shemesh IV: PL LXVIII:12 (Tomb 14); En-Gedi: 29; Fig. 9:1-3 (Stratum V); Qitmit: Fig. 4.3:29; Tel (Ira: Fig. 6.100:16; (Stratum VI, similar to our PL 38:7); Qasile II: Fig. 57:21 ("Stratum VII"). These juglets appear at our site in very small numbers during the 8th and 7th centuries; the lack of examples in Stratum IV is surprising in light of the frequency of this type at nearby sites in the 10th-9th centuries, though this might reflect the vagaries of the excavation. The sparse 7th century parallels point to a Judean distribution, and thus the few examples found in Stratum II may reflect connections with Judah. 127</page><page sequence="136">Varia The following could not be classified according to the type series. Stratum IV PL 6:17. A juglet with a short flaring neck and rounded rim. The body is squat and rounded; the base is missing. A loop handle extends from the rim to the shoulder. PL 85:25. A small juglet with sloping shoulders and a wide, round body; the base is a small disc base. The handle and neck, which appears to have been narrow, are missing. The exterior is covered by a highly polished self slip. A small hole was drilled before firing near the widest part of the body. Stratum III Pl. 21:29. The upper part of a small juglet, with a short narrow neck that flares slightly on top and sloping shoulders. A rather coarse loop handle extends from rim to shoulder. This may be compared to the upper part of a juglet from Ramat Rahel Stratum V ( Ramat Rahel I : Fig. 11:29). Stratum II Pl. 69:4. A juglet with a globular body and narrow, very slightly flaring neck (2.5 cm long; diameter ca. 1.5 cm) and tapering rim top. The flat base is wide and thick, and the vessel might be considered a small jug. A round-sectioned loop handle extends from the rim top to the sloping shoulder. The fabric is similar to that of the mortaria (our BL 20), with its grainy, light-colored matrix. This juglet was found in the debris (F638) outside Building F608, which was attributed to Stratum II, but might contain debris belonging to the post-destruction occupation or to the Persian period. The vessel's shape is unusual in the Iron Age; a date in the Persian period might be preferable (see p. 187). 128 AMPHORISKOI Stratum III: Pis. 21:30-31; 22:12 In this class we include three incomplete vessels from Stratum III. All are small closed vessels with two handles; they represent the only such vessels found at Tel Batash. PI. 21:30 has a long, narrow, slightly concave neck topped by a ring-like rim; the globular body is very thick-walled; the base is missing. Two loop handles (one missing) extend from mid-neck to the top of the shoulder. It is red-slipped, but no traces of burnish remain. This vessel was found together with PI. 21:31, which is the rim and neck of a similarly shaped, though slightly larger, vessel. It is red-slip- ped and burnished to a high polish. Several vessels of a similar concept can be cited from other sites: TBM I: PI. 39:13-16; TBM III: PI. 15:2 (Stratum A); Beer-sheba I : PL 45:11 (Stratum II); Ruqeish : Fig. l:R6a; Arad : Fig. 22:16 (Stratum VIII). Note also a vessel from an Iron Age II tomb: Sahab : Fig. 7:63-65. The general shape recalls Phoenician jug forms such as vessels from Achziv (Amiran 1969: 273, Photo 286; PI. 92:10); compare a very similar rim and neck, with one handle, from Tyre (Bikai 1978: PI. VI:5, Jug Type 5, Strata III-II). The Phoenician affinity of this shape is also obvious in several Cypro-Phoenician juglets and amphoriskoi that recall our vessels {TBM III: 150-151; Amiran 1969: PI. 98:1-2; H. Rosh Zayit: Fig. 5:7, 12, mid- 10th to mid-9th centuries). This is virtually the only instance at our site of a vessel that may be considered an imitation of the "Black on Red" or Cypro-Phoe- nician group. It has been suggested that this shape shows an affinity to that of a glass amphoriskos from Lachish, which Amiran views as the prototype for the clay amphoriskos (Amiran 1969: 250; Photo 253). PI. 22:12 is a fragment of an ovoid body, curving in near what must have been the base. One loop handle is preserved; the vessel is covered with a brownish-red slip and is highly burnished; a black line is painted below the handle. A comparison to our example, though larger, may be Lachish V: PI. 45:18- 19 (Level III). This type is well known throughout the Iron Age, continuing a shape that began in the Late Bronze Age (Amiran 1969: PI. 83; Aharoni and Aharoni 1976: 83-84; Figs. 4:11; 5:11; they claim that this type did not continue past the 8th century). However, our amphoriskos is quite small in com- parison to most of these vessels.</page><page sequence="137">BOTTLES The three main bottle types found at Tel Batash, all in Stratum II, represent Assyrian-inspired shapes.

Elongated bottles with wide neck and tapering base (Photo 75) Stratum II: Pis. 37:12-13; 49:8-9 Medium-sized to large bottles (20-30 cm high) with a wide, straight neck (5.5-7 cm long; diameter 7.5-9 cm); the rim top is everted, generally with a pointed, overhanging exterior (though PI. 37:12 has a thickened rounded rim). The narrow shoulders are rounded, with an elongated body tapering down to a pointed base. There are variations in the proportions between height and width. Of the four complete examples, two are tall (Pis. 37:12; 49:8), one is short and wide (PL 49:9) and the fourth (PL 37:13) is a Photo 75. BT 1 (Pl. 49:9). Scale 1:4. crude, small vessel that appears to be a rough imi- tation of this kind of bottle. This is not a common type at Tel Batash. These vessels lack slip or burnish. PL 37:12 bears an inscription on its neck, incised before firing (see p. 191). These bottles are local imitations of Assyrian "Palace Ware" bottles. For the Assyrian originals (called beakers or vases), all dating to the end of the 8th and beginning of the 7th centuries, see Lines 1954: PL XXXVIII:2, 5 (with ring base); PL XXXVIII:3 (similar in shape to our PL 37:13); Oates 1959; PL XXXVII:60-67, 78-79; Curtis and Reade 1995: 154, No. 130. The closest parallel to our vessels comes from nearby Tel Miqne (Gitin 1995: Fig. 9. Iron Age II typology: bottles. 129</page><page sequence="138">Fig. 4.5:17, Stratum IB). For similar bottles in late Iron Age II contexts, see Nasbeh II : PL 27:444, 446- 447); Samaria III : Fig. 11:26 (Period VII, rim and neck); Tell el-Far 'ah /: PL 61:16 (Stratum VIIb-c); Qiri: Fig. 44:7; Dor. 13, Fig. 1.7:7 (Type BO la); Keisan : PL 37:10a-c (Stratum 5); Tel Rehov (post- 8th century destruction, unpublished). An elongated, painted version of this shape appears in the late Iron Age Ammonite pottery repertoire in Transjordan (e.g. Adoni Nur : Fig. 22:90; Tell el-Mazar: Fig. 5: 2-6, where it is noted that these continued into the 5th century). The affinity to northern sites is clear; these bottles are essentially not found in late Iron Age II Judah. The presence of these bottles at Tel Batash in late 7th century domestic contexts, along with other "Assyrian" shapes such as BL 17 and BL 22, is evidence of the Assyrian influence that continued at the site. BT la. Smaller version of BT 1 Stratum II: PL 59:10 A unique vessel bearing a general resemblance to the main type. The bottle is small, with a very short neck and everted rim. The shoulders slope down above a tapering body and pointed base. The bottle is red-slipped and burnished outside. It was found in two fragments (which did not join) in the debris in the middle street level. No clear parallels were found, though a few examples from the cemetery at Tell el-Mazar appear somewhat similar ( Tell el-Mazar : 66). Note also the base of a similar vessel, red-slipped and burnished, at Tell el-Kheleifeh {Tell el-Kheleifeh' PL 27:13-14); Pratico maintains that this type, whose best parallels are from central and southern Jordan, is related to Assyrian forms (ibid.: 42^3). This is probably a local product that was inspired by the form of BT 1 . Its red slip and burnish are notable in light of the general scarcity of such treatment in Stratum II. 130 BT 2. "Balloon-shaped" bottles (Photo 76) Stratum II: Pis. 37:8-11; 38:14(7); 69:1-3; 75:1 Photo 76. BT 2 (Pl. 37:9-11). Scale 1:4. Small, squat bottles (10-15 cm high) with a short, narrow neck bearing a sharp, pinched ridge in its center. The rim top above the ridge is straight or inverted. The maximum diameter of the round, swollen body is usually below mid-body (though PL 69:1 is narrower); the base is round. Eight complete vessels of this type were found: four in Building 743, three in Building F608, and one in Building F607. They differ from one another in size and proportions, suggesting that they were not a mass-produced item. This bottle too is considered a local imitation of an Assyrian shape that is similar but has a much narrower body (for the Assyrian originals, see Oates 1959: PL XXXVIII:81-84; Curtis and Reade 1995: 155, No. 138). Imitations of such vessels are usually narrower than the "balloon" shape of our bottles (e.g. Amiran 1969: 291, Photo 300, a bottle from Hazor Stratum V). The specific "swollen" form that appears at Tel Batash is rare, and the closest parallels come from nearby Tel Miqne Stratum IB (Gitin 1989a: 44, Fig. 2.13:11; Gitin 1995: Fig. 4.5:15), where it is included with the Assyrian types. Other parallels are sparse and less similar. A vessel that appears to be comparable in shape appears in a photograph from Tell Beit Mirsim ( TBM /: PL 37:3). Variations of</page><page sequence="139">these bottles were found at Tel 'Ira Stratum VII ( Tel 'Ira' Figs. 6.86:18; 6.103:5, with handle). Note also a similar bottle from Tell el-Kheleifeh; Amiran sug- gested that the shape reached this site via Ammon (Amiran 1969: 301, Photo 330). Such a bottle was found in a shaft tomb in the eastern cemetery at Achziv (Mazar 1996: Pl. 21:1). At Megiddo, small bottles of similar general concept, but different body shape, were found in Strata II- I ( Megiddo I: PI. 9: 4-6). It thus appear that the "balloon-shaped" bottles from Tel Batash and Tel Miqne, though generally inspired by Assyrian prototypes, were the product of a local pottery industry characteristic of this region, perhaps centered at Tel Miqne, with only sporadic appearances at other sites. BT 3. "Carrot-shaped" bottle (Photo 77) Stratum II: PI. 49:10 Photo 77. BT 3 (Pl. 49:10). Scale 1:4. This is the single example of its type at our site. It is a tall and elegant bottle, 25 cm high, with a short, narrow neck and everted, triangular rim exterior. The rounded shoulders slope down to an elongated, tapering body and a pointed base. The bottle is covered with a thin cream-colored slip and is bur- nished; thin brown horizontal lines are painted on the rim, neck, shoulder, and mid and lower body. It was found in the destruction debris of Building 950. Amiran included this shape with the Assyrian- inspired bottles (Amiran 1969: 291), citing several much squatter though similarly decorated examples (e.g. Megiddo /: PI. 9:7, Stratum II; Lachish III : PI. 90:384). For other similarly shaped bottles see Amiran 1969: 291, Photo 299 (from Gibeon); 296, Photo 310 (from Amman); Tell el-Far 'ah /: PI. 61:13 (Stratum Vile); Gitin 1995: Fig. 4.5:13, a smaller undecorated bottle with a thick base from Tel Miqne Stratum IB; Keisan : PI. 37:13 (Stratum 5); Qiri: 66, Fig. 8:9 (Strata VI-V). In Transjordan, similar bottles were found in late Iron Age II Ammonite tombs ( Adoni Nur : Fig. 22:94-99; Sahab : Fig. 4:31-33). A similar shape, with a thick solid base, was found in the Tell el- Mazar cemetery ( Tell el-Mazar. Fig. 4:12, 6th-5th centuries). Note a similar bottle, defined as a "Mesopotamian type," from Zincirli, Tomb 5 (Lehman 1998: Fig. 7:13). Varia Pis. 23:15; 88:15-16. Three fragments from Stratum III with a narrow straight neck (diameter ca. 3 cm) and a thickened, rounded rim exterior. The fragments are extremely small and may represent bottles or amphoriskoi. VARIOUS CLOSED VESSELS Feeding Bottle (Photo 78) Stratum IVB: Pl. 1:21 Photo 78. Feeding bottle (PL 1:21). Scale 1:2. 131</page><page sequence="140">This is a small rounded vessel with a vertical spout just above mid-body. The base is a small, very low ring base. The neck and rim are missing and the opening appears to have been filed, perhaps to enable continued use of the vessel after the upper part was broken. It is undecorated. This vessel was found in the lowest level of Stratum IV. The form is known in Stratum V ( Timnah III : BT 5), and our bottle may be an heirloom from this level in view of the apparent filing of the neck after breakage. The shape was included by Dothan in the Philistine repertoire (Dothan 1982a: 155-157). Feeding bottles usually have a basket handle, as ours may originally have had. Handleless Closed Vessels (Photo 79) Stratum II: Pis. 50:10; 74:2 Photo 79. Handleless closed vessel (PL 74:2). Scale 1:3. Two vessels from Stratum II were included in this category, despite the morphological differences between them. Both are deep closed vessels, lacking handles. PI. 74:2 is a medium-sized vessel, 20 cm high, similar in stance to JG 11, though squatter and somewhat warped. It has a slightly flaring neck and an oval body terminating in a ring base. PI. 50:10 is a small vessel (12.5 cm high) with a straight neck and everted, tapering rim top; it has sloping shoulders with a round carination above mid-body and a flat base. There is a certain resemblance between these vessels and two jars from En-Gedi (. En-Gedi : Fig. 15:12-13, Stratum V, red slip and wheel burnish 132 outside). See also a larger krater from Tel 'Ira Stra- tum VI {Tel 'Ira' Fig. 6.101:3). However, since other parallels were not found, it may be suggested that our two vessels are local products of the Stratum II potters at Tel Batash, which again represent the variety of the pottery industry during this period in our region. At Tel Miqne, too, closed vessels without handles were found, though the published examples are smaller and different in shape (Gitin 1995: 65, Fig. 4.5:10, 12). Pyxis (Photo 80) Stratum IVB: Pl. 5:20 Photo 80. Pyxis (PL 5:20). Scale 1:2. The sole example of a pyxis came from an early Stratum IV context. It is small (6.5 cm high), with a bag-shaped body and wide, rounded base. The short neck flares slightly, and two horizontal handles are placed on the upper part of the sloping sides. There are faint traces of red slip outside. The pyxis is a well-known shape in Late Bronze and Iron Age I contexts, which appears until the 10th century, becoming rare in the later Iron Age II (Amiran 1969: 277, PI. 96).

Small lamps with a thick high disc base (2-3 cm high). They have a high, pinched rounded mouth and flaring rim top (rim diameter 11-14.5 cm). These lamps are made of relatively coarse ware and care- lessly finished. This was the most common lamp found in Stratum II, and it may be considered a purely Stratum II type. Five complete examples were recovered, three of them (PI. 50:13-15) from Building 950 (the Oil Press Building) and one (PL 75:4) from Building F607, where two lamps of other types were found. The lamp with a high disc base is one of the clearest criteria for differentiation between 8th and 7th century assemblages in Judah. During the 7th century, the bases became progressively higher and thicker and the ware coarser (Aharoni and Aharoni 1976: 84). Tufnell concluded that the disc-based lamps were introduced in the late 8th and early 7th centuries. Lamps with a lower flat base began this sequence in the late 8th century (Tufhell's Classes L.7-8; Lachish III : PL 83:149-151) and continued until the end of Iron Age II (see our LP 3a below), while the coarser very thick-based lamp (Tufhell's Classes L.9-10, Lachish III : PL 83:153) began to appear only at the very end of the Iron Age Ç Lachish III : 282-283; also En-Gedi : 35). Among the numerous examples from Judah of this later type, see Amiran 1969: 291, PL 100:18-19; Zimhoni 1990: Fig. 35:7-8 (Lachish Level II); Jerusalem , Ophel : Pis. 3:4-6; 8:13; 11:15; Ramat Rahel /: Fig. 11:32- 34, 36-38; En-Gedi : Fig. 23:5-9; Arad : Fig. 29:10. At Tel 'Ira a distinction was made between lamps with "thickened" and "high" bases; it seems that the "thickened" type may parallel our LP 3a. In Stratum VII only "thickened" bases appeared and comprised 50% of the lamps, while in Stratum VI all of the lamps had either "thickened" or "high" bases ( Tel 'Ira: 211, 224, 226, Table 6.25). Several examples of 133</page><page sequence="142">this lamp may be found beyond the borders of Judah as well: Mesad Hashavyahu : Fig. 5:18, 21; Qasile II : Fig. 57:23, 25 (Stratum VII); Samaria III : Fig. 27:4 (the only such lamp found at Samaria: ibid.: 181); Taanach /: Fig. 82:5 (found in a Persian period pit); Megiddo I: PL 37:6 (Stratum III); Hazor III-IV: PL CCXXXIL9-10 (Stratum VA; however, most of the lamps from this level are flat-based, ibid.: PL CCXXXII:6-7, 11-12). At many of these sites, the very high-based coarse lamp appears alongside the lower, flat-based version. This is true of Tel Batash as well, implying continuity between the 8th and 7th century assemblages. At Ashdod such high-based lamps are unknown, and no such lamps are published so far from Tel Miqne. The fact that about half of the lamps in Stratum II are of this essentially Judean type emphasizes the connections of Timnah with Judah in the 7th century. LP 3a. Lamps with low disc base (Photo 82) Stratum III: PL 26:14 Stratum II: Pis. 38:9; 50:16; 75:5 Photo 82. LP 3a (PL 50:16). Scale 1:2. Small to medium-sized lamp with a relatively wide, low disc base; the sides are flaring and the mouth is very pinched. Only a few examples were registered with this type, though it appears that several more might have been mistakenly classified with LP 3, as it was often difficult to determine from the fragment whether the vessel more suited LP 3 or LP 3 a. The fabric of these lamps is finer than that of the higher-based lamps. 134 The following are selected comparisons: Lachish V: PL 46:12 (Level III); Zimhoni 1990: 13, Fig. 6:15- 16 (Lachish Level III); Beer-sheba I: Pis. 56:5-7; 63:133-134 (Stratum III); PL 64:19-21 (Stratum II); Jerusalem II : Fig. 2-29:5 (Cave II, Phase 4, 8th century); Beth Shemesh III: PL XXXIIL2-3, 6 (re- pository of Tomb 2; note that in this repository are two lamps with very high disc bases as well: ibid.: PL XXXIII:4-5); 'Eton : Fig. 2:7 (Stratum II); Arad: Fig. 9:10 (Stratum XI); Fig. 18:13 (Stratum IX); Fig. 22:17 (Stratum VIII); Tel Ira: Figs. 6.74:21; 6.80:15-16 (Stratum VII). Selected examples of the continuation of the low- based lamp in 7th century contexts are Lachish III: PL 83:150 (Tomb 106); En-Gedi: Fig. 23:3^1 (Stra- tum V); Qasile II: Fig. 57:24 ("Stratum VII"); Nasbeh II: PL 71:1627-1628; Sahab: Fig. 7:72-74 (8th-7th centuries); Adoni Nur: 67. Thus, the initial appearance of this type was apparently during the late 9th century; it became common in Judah in the late 8th-early 7th centuries, existing alongside the more common thick disc- based lamps (our LP 3 above) until the end of the Iron Age in Judah and Transjordan. Note that at Gezer, none of the few published lamps from Field VII has a disc base (see Gitin's discussion in Gezer III: 225-227). LP 4. Wide, round-based "saucer" lamps Stratum III: PL 92:14 Stratum II: Pis. 63:12; 75:6 Shallow "saucer" lamps (rim diameter ca. 14 cm) with a pinched rounded mouth and flaring, shelf-like rim top. There is a slight carination below the rim. PL 63:12 has six holes indicating ancient restoration. This feature is curious, as clay lamps must have been inexpensive and widely available, and it is not clear why a repair would have been worthwhile. PL 92:14 appears to have belonged to this type as well, though it has a less flaring rim. This is the second most</page><page sequence="143">common lamp in Stratum II (13 examples registered). The general stance of this lamp continues that of the typical wide, round-based "saucer" lamp, as opposed to the flat disc base that develops during the latter half of Iron Age II (see LP 3 and LP 3a above). This is a common generic shape, found with an everted rim throughout the Iron Age, though usually with a narrower base (see Amiran 1969: PL 100). At Lachish, this type is found in Tomb 106 (7th- beginning of 6th centuries), together with the low flat-based lamp (our LP 3 a) and the thick disc-based lamp (our LP 3) {Lachish III : PL 83:145-146, 148, Tufnell's Classes L.4-6). Other examples are Ramat Rahel I: Fig. 25:8 (Stratum V); En-Gedi : Fig. 23:1-2 (Stratum V); Gezer III : Fig. 11:18; Ashdod II-III: Fig. 50:21-22 (Stratum VIII); Ashdod IV: Fig. 29:14 (Stratum VI); Sa'idiyeh: Fig. 7:31 (Stratum VI, uneven base); ' Ajrud : 178, Fig. 22:3^. Thus, the "saucer" lamp coexisted with the disc- based lamp and had a wider distribution than that of the latter, which is mainly Judean. MINIATURE VESSELS The selection of miniature vessels from Tel Batash is quite varied, including a bowl, bottles, juglets, cups, a pyxis and an amphoriskos. All were found in Stratum II domestic contexts, aside from one from Stratum III, which was also from a non-cultic con- text. These were handmade and for the most part do not demonstrate any qualities that would render them luxury items. It may be assumed that they were locally produced to fulfill specific needs, e.g. as containers of cosmetics or medicinal ointments. However, it should be noted that the phenomenon of miniature vessels found in domestic contexts, some imitating larger types and some unique, is unusual in the Iron Age. The majority of what are generally termed "votive" vessels are from cultic contexts (e.g. Qasile I: 117-118, Fig. 47; Athienou: 53-110). The presence of these objects in the late Iron Age II houses excavated at Tel Batash is noteworthy. Bowl Reg. No. 7223/01 , Locus 743, Building 743, Area D, Stratum II (PI. 32:14). A small, thick-walled bowl (diameter 5 cm) with a flat-topped horizontal rim and a wide, flat, barely convex base. The interior has a round bulge near its center. The bowl was found burnt. Bottles 1. Reg. No. 9591/3, Locus 987, Area E, Stratum III (PI. 27:8) A small fragment of a closed vessel with a short everted neck and round, sloping shoulders; it prob- ably lacked handles. Its general shape recalls that of contemporary bottles. This vessel, which may have functioned as a container for perfume or special oil, was found together with a bone plaque (PL 27:9; see pp. 263-264). 2. Reg. No. 5002/20, Locus 500, Area C, Stratum II (PI. 104:13) A small sherd of a closed vessel with a short straight rim and rather thick shoulder. It somewhat recalls the shape of the bottles found in this period. Juglets 1. Reg. No. 7582, Locus 743, Building 743, Area D, Stratum II (PI. 38:8; Photo 83) A small (6 cm high), thick-walled, handmade juglet with a short flaring neck and a somewhat bag-shaped body. A round-sectioned loop handle extends from the rim to the top of the lower body curve. Its general shape is different from that of the typical small dipper juglets of this period (JT 7a-b). Photo 83. Miniature juglet (PL 38:8). Scale 1:2. 2. Reg. No. 9416, Locus 960, Building 950, Area E, Stratum II (PI. 50:17) A miniature juglet (2.25 cm high), hand made of coarse ware, with a relatively long flaring neck, 135</page><page sequence="144">thickened near the rim, and piriform body tapering to a button base. A thick, round-sectioned loop handle (broken) extends from the rim to the shoulder; it rises above the rim. Note a certain similarity to a miniature juglet with a narrowing base from Tell Qasile ( Qasile /: Fig. 47:c, assigned to Iron Age I). 3. Reg. No. 9720, Locus E615, Building 914, Area E, Stratum II (Pl. 55:17) A miniscule handmade juglet (2 cm high up to the broken neck; diameter 2 cm at the widest point) with sloping shoulders and a swollen mid-body. The base is thickened and slightly rounded. A thick handle extends up from the shoulder (broken). The exterior is covered by a highly polished black slip. This juglet was mentioned above with the so-called "black juglets" or "perfume juglets" (see JT 9), since despite its very small size, it should be considered with this general category. Similar miniature black juglets are found at the very end of the Iron Age II (Amiran 1969: 263, PL 89:22). 4. Reg. No. F7017, Locus F607, Building F607, Area F, Stratum II (PI. 75:17) A very small handmade juglet (4.6 cm high) with a long narrow, slightly flaring neck and a short round body and base. A thick round-sectioned loop handle, out of proportion with the body, extends from the rim to the shoulder. 5. Reg. No. 5069, Locus 500, Area C, Stratum II (PI. 104:14) A sherd of a thick-walled, handmade vessel with a moderately biconical shape. A thick protruding loop handle extends from the rim to the carination, rising above the rim. Its continuation below the handle is missing. Cups 1. Reg. No. 7571, Locus 778, Building 743, Area D, Stratum II (PL 38:13; Photo 84) This vessel has a small, cylindrical body (7 cm high; diameter 4 cm) with a thickening near its flat base. The rim flares out, with a slightly concave interior. The exterior is covered with traces of red slip. The vessel is made of a chalky orange ware (our FG 19), which mainly characterizes our S J 15 and vessels of the period postdating the Iron Age II destruction. 136 Photo 84. Miniature cup (PL 38:13). Scale 1:2. 2. Reg. No. F7019, Locus F607, Building F607, Area F, Stratum II (Pl. 75:15) A handmade, thick- walled cylindrical vessel (7.2 cm high) with straight sides and a slightly everted, truncated rim. The wide base is slightly concave and has an inner thickening in the center. This vessel was found together with two other miniature vessels: a juglet (PL 75:17) and an amphoriskos (PL 75:16). 3. Reg. No. 9679, Locus 982, Building 950, Area E, Stratum II (Pl. 50:9; Photo 85) A small vessel (5 cm high) with splayed sides and a flat base. The rim is tapering. It is made of chalky orange ware (FG 19), just like PL 38:13 above, perhaps suggesting that they were manufactured together. Compare this shape to Keisan : PL 45:2 (Stratum 5). Photo 85. Miniature cup (PL 50:9). Scale 1:2. "Pyxis" Reg. No. 1270, Locus 743, Building 743, Area D, Stratum II (PL 38:12 ; Photo 86) A small vessel (8.5 cm high) with a narrow neck (broken), sloping carinated shoulders and straight walls slightly narrowing above a flat base. Two knob handles are attached to the shoulder carination. The general stance recalls that of a high-bodied pyxis, though the body is somewhat reminiscent of bottles. The affinity to the pyxis, however, is tentative, as this type of vessel is practically extinct in 7th century</page><page sequence="145">contexts. This vessel was found together with two other miniature vessels (PL 38:8, 13) in Building 743. Photo 86. Miniature "pyxis" (PL 38:12). Scale 1:2. Amphoriskos Reg. No. F9030, Locus F607, Building F607, Area F, Stratum II (Pl. 75:16) A sherd of a tiny, delicate piriform handmade body (from shoulder to near base ca. 3 cm) with one pre- served perforated handle; there appears to have been another handle on the opposite side. This may per- haps be compared to the shape of a miniature Iron Age I vessel from Tell Qasile, termed a "two-handled storage jar" ( Qasile I: Fig. 47:e).

Stratum II Street, Area D 6. Reg. No. 8011/7, Locus 738 (PI. 59:14) 7. Reg. No. 7087/2, Locus 730 (PI. 61:4) 8. Reg. No. 7054/5, Locus 730 (PL 61:5) Stratum II in Area H 9. Reg. No. HI 1563/1, Locus H1167 (PL 96:19) The stands from Tel Batash represent a number of morphological variations. The most common shape is the "hourglass" stand (Pis. 38:15-17; 44:6-7), ranging in height from ca. 7.5 cm to ca. 30 cm (PL 96:19 is exceptionally small, only 5 cm high). The base and rim are generally everted and thickened, often coming to a pointed exterior. Numerous parallels to this basic shape may be found in the Iron Age II, e.g. Lachish V: PL 45:7 (Level III); Lachish III : PL 90:399^402; RamatRahel I: Figs. 11:39-40; 25:6; 26:4; Beth Shemesh IV: PL LXVII:22 (Stratum II); Beer-sheba I: PL 63:131 (Stratum II); En-Gedi : Fig. 20:8 (Stratum V); Samaria III: Fig. 11:35 (Period VII); Megiddo I: PL 34 (Strata IV-I). PL 59:14 is a unique fragment of a straight-sided, thick-walled vessel with a truncated inner rim. It has a square window cut into the rim and several narrow grooves below the window. This may possibly be a cultic stand; it may be compared to a stand from the cultic area E207 at Samaria, which has straight sides and a hole rather than a window {Samaria III: Fig. 28:6). PL 61:4 is also a unique stand. While its upper part (inner diameter 1 1.5 cm) is identical to that of S J 10b, it is only 8 cm high. PL 61:5 is also exceptional, with a very flaring top and slightly concave sides (the base is missing). The rim exterior is folded over to a sharp point, and two prominent ridges protrude below the rim and just above the break near the bottom. A close parallel to this is Qitmit: Fig. 1.14:16, with a thick red line. The obvious function of these objects is to support vessels with rounded or pointed bases such as stor- age jars, jugs, juglets and cooking pots. The varia- tions in diameter correspond to the specific vessels that they supported. However, the number of stands found is much smaller than the number of such vessels. It thus appears likely that stands were used for specific purposes like resting a cooking pot when it was hot or steadying a bowl while mixing, while other means of support were probably employed for most vessels. It should be noted that no stands were found in Strata IV- III. 137</page><page sequence="146">Funnels 1. Reg. No. E7 101/2, Locus E703d, Area E, Stratum IV (PI. 11:17) A long narrow neck with a slightly thickened rim; the beginning of sloping shoulders was preserved. Faint traces of red slip are visible outside. Though this may possibly have been a jug, its unique long neck sug- gests it might have functioned as a funnel. 2. Reg. No. F6263, Locus F605, Building F607, Area Ķ Stratum II (Pl. 75:2) A long narrow neck with a slightly thickened rim. The sloping shoulders are quite wide but asym- metrical; the vessel is broken at the shoulder. It was probably a funnel, though this is not certain. The function of funnels, to direct liquids into narrow openings of containers, is obvious; the nar- row "neck" of the funnel is an appropriate size to fit into the mouth of the vessel it feeds. Funnels are known from Late Bronze Age contexts and continue well into the Iron Age with little change (e.g. Megiddo I: PL 38:1, with petals; Nasbeh II : PL 77; Gibeon : Fig. 6:20). Basins with Interior Protrusions ("Footbaths") 1. Reg. 7087 , Locus 730 , Upper Street Level, AreaD, Stratum II (PI. 62:1) 2. Reg. 9620/8, Locus 972, Middle Street Level, Area E, Strata ///-// (PI. 59:12) The vessel depicted in PL 62:1 was found in the debris of the upper street level in Area D, in pieces that could only be partly restored; the drawing reflects its reconstructed shape. It was hand-made of rough clay and poorly fired, with a thick, black core; it was covered by a white lime wash. The basin is oval (length ca. 60 cm; width ca. 35 cm). It has a flat base and straight walls, ca. 15 cm high and almost 2 cm thick. In the center of the interior is a convex handle-like feature attached to the bottom. Broken attachments at the ends of the "handle" and on the two narrow walls below their rim show that there had been a connection between the central "handle" and the side walls, apparently by way of clay bands. Two clay "tongues" were placed in the center of opposite sides of the long walls, below the rim. Pl. 59: 12 is probably a fragment of a similar basin; the broken clay attachment inside the rim recalls PL 62:1. This fragment was found in the debris on a lower street level. 138 Vessels of general similar shape are known at several Iron Age II sites, e.g. Samaria III : 187, Fig. 29:1-7 (Periods V-VI). They were defined at Sama- ria for the first time by Crowfoot (followed by Kenyon) as "footbaths" for ritual use. All these objects are oval, with variations in the shape of the central projection, which is sometimes in the shape of one or two pillars with a round or flattened head. They often have inner ledge handles, flush with or below the rim. The following are some examples: Tell el-Far 'ah I: PL 55:1-3 (one from Stratum Vllb and two from Stratum Vile), recalling our example, except for four clay "tongues" along the rims, none attached to the central "handle"; Beer-sheba I : PL 63:138 (Stratum II), with a central projection and eight "tongues" along the rim, defined as a basin; Ashdod III-IV: Fig. 60:11 (no stratum), a round basin with six "tongues," no central handle and a draining spout at the bottom; Abu Hawam : Pl. XXXVI: 100 (Stratum III); Nasbeh II: PL 84:3; Megiddo I: PL 43:14 (Stratum III), with two "basket" handles and a central part that is not clear from the photograph, defined as "basket or birdbath (?)"; Seligman 1994: Fig. 9:8, 8th-7th centuries. The exhibition "Beauty in the Ancient World" held at the Israel Museum in 1989 displayed several such vessels from Tel Nagila (partly missing, with two stands in the center and no drain), Lachish (8th-7th centuries, with two projec- tions in the center), Vered Jericho and Tel Miqne. A fragment from Tell Keisan Stratum 9c of a basin with the remains of an interior handle may be the earliest example of such an object {Keisan: PL 73:12). During a salvage excavation at Beer-sheba, a similar vessel was found in a 7th century occupation level; it is made of white chalk and round in shape, with a central "pillar" projection.32 Thus, these basins had a wide distribution throughout the Iron Age II, mostly in its latter part. While the term "footbath" suggested by Crowfoot is widely used for these objects, it does not adequately explain their function. The "tongues" along the rims of most of them were apparently intended to support something. Chambón attempted to provide an alter- native explanation, defining the basins from Tell el- Far'ah (N) as égouttoirs ("draining installations") used in the preparation of cheese. According to this interpretation, the "tongues" along the rim were used to support sieves that facilitated the draining of the dairy product (see Tell el-Far 'ah I: 63-64 and reconstruction in Fig. 14). Though it is difficult to determine whether Chambón' s interpretation is cor-</page><page sequence="147">rect, he is justified in claiming that the "tongues" must have had some functional purpose, and these objects were perhaps used in food production of some sort.

No. 5108/4, Locus 551, Area C (PI. 103:12) Fragments of large, plain basins, hand-made of coarse ware. They have a flat base and straight rims. Their length is ca. 40 cm and depth ca. 10 cm. PI. 9:13 from Stratum IV has red slip and is hand-bur- nished inside. PI. 22:14 from Stratum III has rem- nants of red slip. PI. 26: 16 is a rim fragment of a very large open vessel, perhaps a basin. PI. 36:7, part of the base and slightly curved walls of a deep basin, is unique in its shape and depth. PI. 103:12 is a sherd of an extremely thick-walled container with straight walls and a flat-topped, thickened rim. Large basins or vats of various shapes are found at numerous Iron Age II sites, e.g. Ashdod IV : Fig. 6:6 (Stratum Xb); Hazor III-IV: Pl. CLXXXVIL10 (Stratum VI). It may be suggested that such large clay basins were used for food preparation, or perhaps some other function such as laundry or a portable water trough for domestic animals. Chalice with Petals Reg. No. D8039/10, Locus D803, Area D, Stratum IV (PL 9:5) A fragment of a hollow chalice foot, near the join to the bowl. It has four broken appendages just below this join, which appear to have been petals. There are traces of white paint or slip outside. There are several Iron Age II parallels for such chalices, some found in cultic contexts and others, like ours, in domestic contexts. See, for example, Megiddo (May 1935: Fig. 6, very elaborately deco- rated; PL 20, called an "incense stand"); Tell el- Far 'ah I : PL 60:11 (Stratum Vild); Samaria III : Fig. 25:10 (Periods V-VI); Arad : Fig. 15 (defined as a "ceramic incense altar", found in the temple of Stratum X); Tel Miqne (Gitin 1993b: 253, Fig. 5b). Similar petals appear on offering bowls that stood on cylindrical stands (Lachish V: PL 43), and are also well known in Iron Age art, such as stands shown taken as booty in the Lachish relief (Ussishkin 1982: 107, Fig. 83) and the stone balustrade from Ramat Rahel (Ramat Rahel II' Fig. 38:1-3; NEAEHL : 1264). An elaborately painted petal chalice was found in a context of the 10th-9th centuries at Tel Rehov (unpublished). Our chalice, dated to the 10th century, is one of the earliest in this group. Kernos Fragments 1. Reg. No. H9097/21, Locus H919, Area H, Stratum III (PI. 92:12) A small fragment of a cylindrical neck with a pro- nounced bulge under the rim exterior. It is red-slip- ped and burnished, with black and white horizontal lines painted near the rim and under the bulge. A possible comparison to this shape is Tel Michal : Fig. 7.3:11 (Stratum XIII), with vertical burnish and black lines. Though identification of this fragment is uncertain, it may have been part of an object like a libation ring vessel (kernos). 2. Reg. No. 5017/7, Locus 509, Area C, unstratified (PI. 101:10) A fragment of a kernos ring with an opening in the top, red-slipped and burnished, painted with black horizontal lines. The reconstructed diameter is 16.5 cm. It was found in unstratified debris in the gate area. For a discussion of ring vessels see Qasile /: 108-111. In workmanship and decoration, our frag- ment recalls such vessels from Ashdod, where they continued to be popular until the 8th century (Ashdod 1 : 138 ; Ashdod II-III: 132). Pottery Tool Reg. No. E7048, Locus E702, Area E, Stratum III (PI. 26:15) A body sherd adapted for secondary use, with one 139</page><page sequence="148">end pared to a 90° angle, and the opposite edge somewhat rounded. A round hole was bored in the lower corner, near the rounded edge, perhaps for grip or attachment to another implement. This may have served as a pottery-making tool, i.e. for scraping or burnishing. Compare Lachish III : 250, Pis. 41:12; 58:2 (discs or plaque fragments that may have been used in weaving found in Cave 6024); Mesad Hashavyahu , Fig. 4:21, a fragment of a perforated plaque with a potter's mark, defined as a "polishing implement"; Gibeon : Fig. 33:21-22, Iron Age II; Nasbeh II : PI. 78:1810; 'Ajrud: Fig. 25:14-15. Ayalon commented that since there is no evidence for pottery production at Kuntillet 'Ajrud, it is pos- sible that these implements were used for smoothing plaster on walls or clay oven walls, finishing wooden utensils, grinding foods, etc. (ibid.: 185-186). Perforated Storage Jar Reg. No. 7555/1, Locus 781 , Building 743, Area D, Stratum II (PI. 35:9; Photo 88) This jar (type SJ 7; see pp. 97-101) was intentionally cut at the shoulder line and dozens of holes were perforated through its body before firing, turning it into a large strainer. The only comparable vessel in the Iron Age in Israel is a krater-jar from Megiddo Strata VA-IVB, which is similarly perforated ( Megiddo II: PI. 89:4). The latter was found in a cult corner (Locus 2081) and probably had a function in the ritual, such as incense burning. The function of our vessel remains unknown. A photograph of this storage jar was published under the titillating title "Mysterious Pot from Tel Batash" in BAR 15/1 (1989): 44, and several suggestions were made as to its function in "Readers' Solutions to the Mysterious Pot from Tel Batash," BAR 15/3 (1989): 10-12. One of these suggestions (made by S. Aaronson, Queens College, CUNY, Department of Biology) was that the jar was used as a sieve for separating curds from whey; it could have been used to feed the whey to domestic animals. This explanation recalls that given by Chambón for the use of the "tongued basins" mentioned above; could the jar have been used on top of a basin in some kind of dairy production? Another possibility is that the jar was used as a cooler when placed in water. A perforated iron bucket from Greece was used to purify or strain raisins (Yeroulanou et al. 1978). No final conclusion can be reached, though in our opinion the most 140 likely uses are incense burning or dairy product processing. Photo 88. Perforated storage jar (PL 35:9). Scale 1:5. A Unique Vessel Reg. No. 7519, Locus 743, Building 743, Area D, Stratum II (PI. 38:10 ; Photo 89) A fragment of a unique object with a short straight neck and a somewhat thickened rim. The body has a sharp triangular section, with a narrow bottom, which is broken. The function of this vessel is unknown. Photo 89. Unique vessel (PL 38:10). Scale 2:5. Clay Stoppers 1. Reg. No. F 6 165/1, Locus F607, Building F607, Area F, Stratum II (PI. 75:10 ; Photo 90) A T-shaped object made of poorly fired clay and probably used as a stopper for a juglet or small jug. Compare Megiddo I: PL 107:16, 18 (Stratum III); PL</page><page sequence="149">107:22 (Stratum V). The general shape of this stop- per resembles that of a limestone stopper found in Area E (Pl. 53:6). Photo 90. Clay stopper (Pl. 75:10). Scale 1:1. 2. Reg. No. H9204, Locus H961, Area H, Stratum II (PL 95:14) A T-shaped handmade stopper made of poorly fired clay. Its stem tapers and there is a faint groove under the cap, at the point where the stopper would have rested in the vessel's mouth. Since the diameter at this point is ca. 3 cm, it could have been used to plug a vessel with such a rim diameter, like a juglet or small bottle. The top of the stopper is partly chiseled away and one edge is chipped. Clay Scale Pan or Lid Reg. No. F6371, Locus F632, Building F608, Area F, Stratum II (PI. 69:8) A small, very shallow straight-walled bowl (diameter 9 cm), with a slight depression in the center and two holes drilled through the edges. It was possibly used as a scale pan, though such objects are usually made of bone (Ayalon and Sorek 1999: 53) or bronze (Ashdod IV : Fig. 12:3). An alternative use might be as a lid. Potters' Marks on Handles Several jug, jar and cooking pot handles were marked with incised signs, made before firing. Such signs are usually deemed "potters' marks," though this needs further clarification. At Tel Batash, only a few such marks were found among the hundreds of complete vessels and thousands of sherds. If these marks are indeed potters' marks, we would expect a wider appearance. An in-depth study of this subject would have to take into account the quantitative aspect of the appearance of such marks, as well as their nature and distribution. Stratum IV 1. Reg. No. D8161, Locus D821, Area D (Pl. 1:22) A jug or storage jar handle with a cross incised before firing. Numerous such incisions exist on pottery vessels from the Iron Age. Compare for example Lachish V: Pis. 35:6, 8; 45:8 (Level III); Jerusalem, Ophel: PL 8:15-16; Mevorakh : Fig. 16:12-14 (Stratum VII); Megiddo I: PL 41:3, 12-14 (Strata III-II); PL 42:56-57 (Stratum V); Hazor /: PL LX:6 (Stratum V). Stratum III 2. Reg. No. H8556, Locus H865, Area H (Pl. 88:4) A storage jar handle incised after firing with an "H." This motif is relatively rare; see Megiddo I: PL 41:17 (storage jar from Stratum III); Jerusalem IV : Fig. 20:8 (cooking pot). Stratum II 3. Reg. No. H10100, Locus H1007, Building H959, Area H (Pl. 95:3) 4. Reg. No. H 10009, Locus H1007, Building H959, Area H (Pl. 95:4) 5. Reg. No. F6316, Locus F 63 2, Building F 608, Area F (Pl. 65:9) Cooking pot handles with a neat cross or more careless "X" incised on the handle before firing. Similar marks are common in Judah during the Iron Age II, e.g. Gibeon: Fig. 47:8-9; Jerusalem, Ophel : PL 16:8. See also Samaria III : Fig. 30:31 and Kei- san: PL 92:24-40 for similar signs on the handles of various vessels. E. EARLY ARCHAIC GREEK POTTERY* Jodi Magness A small quantity of early archaic Greek pottery, consisting of one whole (restored) vessel and frag- ments of others, was recovered in the excavations at Tel Batash. Most of the types represented are East Greek. The fact that some of the pieces come from the late Iron Age destruction level dated ca. 605-603 BCE provides an important chronological peg for these types.33 The following is a catalogue of the pieces. * I am grateful to N. Panitz-Cohen for providing some of the information on the stratigraphie contexts described here. This report was originally written and submitted for publication in 1988. 141</page><page sequence="150">CATALOGUE Samian Amphora Reg. No. F6368/1, Locus F632, Building F608, Area Fy Stratum II (PL 68:2; Photo 91) The only whole early archaic Greek import recovered at Tel Batash is a restored Samian amphora of micaceous red-brown ware (5YR 6/6). It is virtually identical to a Samian amphora assigned by Grace to ca. 600 BCE (Grace 1970: 71, PL 15: l).34 It also resembles Samian amphorae from Cyprus and from the Acropolis in Athens (Gjerstad 1948: 48, Fig. 57:7; Roebuck 1940: 257, Fig. 61:335). Ajar found at Salamis in Cyprus is close in form but has a nar- rower neck (Calvet and Yon 1977: 19, PL 11:119). Samian amphorae from Defenneh and Naucratis are similar in shape but have more angular shoulders (Petrie 1888: 65, PL 34:39). Examples of Samian amphorae with more globular bodies were also found at the single-period site of Mesad Hashavyahu, whose occupation is contemporary with the last Iron Age stratum at Tel Batash (Mesad Hashavyahu : 105, Fig. 6:1-3). The Tel Batash amphora comes from the eastern side of Building F608, which shares a common wall Photo 91. Samian amphora (PL 68:2). Scale 1:5. 142 and plan with Building F607 to the west. It was found in Locus F632, which represents brick debris lying on a beaten earth floor (F644, F608 and F645) ( Timnah 1 : 239-242, 246). This debris is attributed to the destruction of the building at the end of Stratum II (the late Iron Age). Most of the pottery was con- centrated in the southern end of the locus. The con- text confirms the date of ca. 600 BCE proposed by Grace for this form. Ionian Cups 1. Reg. No. F6317/1, Locus F632 , Building F608, Area F, Stratum II (PL 64:21; Photo 92) One of the two Ionian cup fragments found at Tel Batash comes from the same locus as the Samian amphora discussed above. It preserves the entire profile of the rim down to the lower part of the handle. The vessel is made of a micaceous yellow- gray ware (10YR 6/3) with small, dark inclusions. Its dull and streaky dark gray-brown glaze covers the interior and extends on the exterior down to the top of the handles. The form of the cup matches Tocra Rhodian Type II, a late 7th century type, but the ware more closely matches that of Tocra Rhodian Type IX (of possible Cycladic origin) and the Tocra Samian series (Boardman and Hayes 1966: 112-115, Fig. 55:1193). In profile the cup resembles two examples from Tell Sukas, which are assigned a date from the late 7th century to the first half of the 6th century (Ploug 1973: 15, Fig. a.103.1; 37, Fig. b.107.1; pp. 29-34). The cup from Tel Batash is also close in profile to a cup from Mesad Hashavyahu (Mesad Hashavyahu : 107, Fig. 7:7). The ware may match that of a group of cups described by Hanfmann (1963: 283) as being greenish-gray when underfired. Hanfmann assigns some of these cups to Samos, which may explain the presence of mica in the Batash piece. Photo 92. Ionian cup No. 1 (PL 64:21). Scale 1:1.</page><page sequence="151">2. Reg. No. G6006/13, Locus G614, Area G , Stratum II (Photo 93) The second Ionian cup fragment comes from Area G, in which only limited excavations were conducted ( Timnah I: 173). Locus G614 was a stone fill found on the surface of the mound, containing a mixture of Stratum II and Stratum I pottery types. The tiny cup fragment preserves only the joint between the rim and the body. The light brown (7.5YR 7/4) ware is well levigated. The glaze, which covers the interior and the upper part of the exterior, is glossy brown. The fabric and glaze of this piece match the description of cups of Rhodian origin found at Tocra (Boardman and Hayes 1966: 111). Photo 93. Ionian cup No. 2. Scale 1:1. Cooking Pot(s) 1. Reg. No. F6240, Locus F605, Building F607, Area F, Stratum II (PL 72:10; Photo 94) 2. Reg. No. F6166/5, Locus F619, Area F, Stratum I (PL 76:13) These fragments come from one or more cooking pots made of micaceous brown ware with a gray core. A number of pieces were found in these two loci, including several rims and one handle fragment. Although a few joins were found, no complete pro- file could be restored. It is possible that the pieces from both loci come from a single vessel. These fragments represent a general type of one-handled jug or chytra common at sites in Greece from the Geometric period on. They are characterized in form by an everted rim, rounded body and flat strap handle (Waldbaum and Magness 1997: 31-32). Other examples of this type have been found in Israel at Mesad Hashavyahu, Ashkelon and Kabri (ibid.). The first group of fragments comes from Building F607, which shares a common wall and plan with Building F608, where the Samian amphora and Ionian cup fragment No. 1 were found (see above). Both are domestic buildings with installations that may have been used for household industrial purposes. Locus F605 was an accumulation on a patchy beaten earth floor to the south of Wall F610, in the southern part of Building F607. Because the eastern end of Wall F610 was disturbed, it is not clear whether it repre- sents the southern wall of Building 607, or whether Locus F605 belonged to this building ( Timnah I: 243-244). The second group of sherds comes from Locus F619, a pit that cut through Locus F605 and may have contaminated it ( Timnah 1 : 244 and P/S 103). This means that it is impossible to determine whether the cooking pot or pots come from the destruction debris of Stratum II in Building F607 or the post-Stratum II pit. Since the former alternative seems more likely, these pieces should be attributed to a domestic context of the late Iron Age II. Photo 94. East Greek cooking pot (PL 72:10). Scale 1:2. Oinochoe Reg. No. 7118/2, Locus 738, Area D, Stratum II (Pl. 59:11; Photo 95) This is the double handle of an oinochoe, made of rather coarse, gritty, light brown ware (7.5YR 7/4) with a pink core (2.5YR 6/4) and many small white Photo 95. Oinochoe handle (PL 59:11). Scale 1:1. 143</page><page sequence="152">and dark inclusions. It is covered with a light yellow slip (10YR 8/3). Oinochoae with similar double handles were found at Mesad Hashavyahu {Mesad Hashavyahu : 109, Fig. 8:5-9). This vessel is prob- ably related to Wild Goat Ware, though there are no traces of paint on the handle.35 Locus 738 is a street level attributed to Stratum II that contained mostly discarded sherds ( Timnah /: 199-200). Corinthian Alabastron Reg. No. 9360 , Locus 960, Building 950, Area E, Stratum II (PL 50:11; Photo 96) This is a tiny body fragment (maximum diameter 3.3 cm) of a Corinthian vessel made of smooth, well- levigated, hard-fired, light yellow ware (2.5Y 7/4). The exterior surface is incised with part of a wing and the upper portion of the hindquarters of an ani- mal. Traces of red and black paint are preserved on the figure. The incision is precise and delicate, with each feather along the edge of the wing fully delineated. The figure represented was a seated griffin or sphinx that is almost identical to the griffin on an Early Corinthian aryballos of ca. 620 BCE from Taranto (Lo Porto 1978: Pl. 64; Fig. 5). The curvature of the Tel Batash fragment suggests that it comes from the lower half of an alabastron. On the basis of comparison with the Taranto vessel, and because the alabastron is a common Early Corinthian form, this piece should be assigned to the Early Corinthian Style (ca. 625-600 BCE), or, at the latest, to the beginning of the Middle Corinthian Style (ca. 600-575 BCE).36 Unlike the East Greek types dis- cussed so far, Corinthian pottery is rare at sites in Israel (for discussion and references, see Waldbaum and Magness 1997: 33-36). This sherd comes from the late Iron Age destruction debris in the Oil Press Building in Area E (Building 950). Locus 960 rep- resents destruction debris on the cobblestone floor in the southwestern corner of the building, west of the line of monoliths ( Timnah 1 : 211-218, 230). Photo 96. Corinthian alabastron (PL 50:11). Scale 1:1. 144 F. SURFACE TREATMENT: RED SLIP AND BURNISH INTRODUCTION AND METHODOLOGY The temporal and spatial aspects of the appearance and development of red slip and burnish in the Iron Age are important factors in pottery studies of this period (Holladay 1990; Zimhoni 1997; Mazar 1998). In the following section, the appearance of red slip and burnish in Strata IV-II at Tel Batash is sum- marized on the basis of the quantitative registration of the pottery. An attempt was made to define these features and examine possible chronological and typological implications for their development at Tel Batash. The appearance of red slip and burnish was studied in two stages. First, the slip and burnish on all vessels and sherds were registered by codes according to set categories (see p. 13). With reference to the slip, these categories were broad and defined all variations simply as "red slip." Additional codes defined the location of the slip. Burnishing was registered according to type and location. As Holladay (1990) and Zimhoni (' Eton : 87) have noted, the shades of slip can be an important typological factor. Thus, in the second stage of our study, the vessels and sherds from Strata IV-II that appear in the pottery plates in this volume were subjected to an additional classi- fication of hues of red slip; this enabled a more homogeneous definition system for publication. The Munsell Color Charts were used to define the slip colors as color ranges rather than particular values. The use of this system is advantageous in its con- sistency and relative ease of use (Shepard 1957: 107), though the disadvantages of subjectivity and fluctuating light are always present. The verbal def- initions used in the Munsell charts are often prob- lematic, since a wide range of colors is included in each (Rice 1987: 341-343). Another reservation about the definitions presented concerns the influ- ence of post-depositional factors in the soil, which may alter the color of both slip and pottery (TBM III: 104). However, this alteration is usually consistent, and while the color of the slip sometimes differs from the original hue, it can be subjected to group clas- sification. The material was grouped into color groups based on a limited amount of different colors, and each was given a code (see below) noted in the descriptions of the plates. The type and location of burnish are described separately in the plates. An</page><page sequence="153">attempt was made to emphasize the relationship between red slip and burnish, rather than viewing them as separate entities. DESCRIPTION OF BURNISH TYPES Irregular hand burnish (Photo 97) This burnish is characterized by its erratic lines that usually run in different directions, not forming any regular pattern, or forming patterned groups that intersect. However, such burnish, though irregular, does reflect the turn of the vessel as it was burnished. For example, on the interior of some open vessels a certain degree of "order in the disorder" can be noted, e.g. a bowl from Lachish Level IV, whose interior is divided into six "slices" each of which was burnished parallel to the rim (Zimhoni 1997: 88, Fig. 3.15). In some cases, the upper part is burnished parallel to the rim while the lower part has lines that are perpendicular to the rim or irregular (e.g. ibid.: Fig. 3.16:4, Level IV). Other terms employed for this type of burnish are "careless burnishing" (Rice 1987: 138) and "chordal line" or "criss-cross" burnishing (for a recent discussion and earlier bibliography see Zimhoni 1997: 115). Photo 97. Examples of irregular hand burnish. Horizontal hand burnish (Photo 98) This burnish is characterized by horizontal lines that are irregularly spaced and are usually discontinuous, representing the moments when the potter stopped burnishing to rotate the vessel (Zimhoni 1997: 115). The lines are more or less parallel to the rim. This kind of burnish sometimes has several erratic lines as well, but the main direction is horizontal. The use of horizontal hand burnish together with irregular bur- nish was also noticed during registration of the material. Photo 98. Example of horizontal hand burnish. Wheel burnish This burnish is characterized by evenly spaced, regular horizontal lines, made during continuous turning of the vessel on a tournette (slow wheel) or a fast wheel. The resulting composition may be fine horizontal lines or often a spiral ("ring burnish"). Though Kelso and Pali-Thorley (TBM III: 132-133) claimed that this kind of burnish was begun at the rim and proceeded to the center, it may have been done the opposite way as well (observation of O. Mazar). The difference between horizontal hand burnish and wheel burnish was not always clearly definable. Horizontal lines that appeared unevenly spaced and/or sporadic (but not irregular in direction) were considered horizontal hand burnish. Lines that were more regular and evenly spaced (though not necessarily dense) were considered wheel burnish. 145</page><page sequence="154">Continuous burnish This refers to burnish that produced a homoge- neously polished surface. In some cases, burnish lines were visible below the polished exterior, sug- gesting the use of different tools and/or application of the burnish at different stages of manufacture (Rice 1987: 138). Vertical burnish This burnish is found on the exterior of closed ves- sels and is composed of vertical lines, often applied from the base up. These are usually moderately spaced, though in some cases they are very dense and in other cases sporadic. Vertical lines were some- times found on the body and neck, with concentric burnish lines applied to the shoulder of the vessel. INTERACTION BETWEEN SLIP AND BURNISH Though it is obvious that red slip and burnish are two separate phenomena that should be viewed individ- ually ( 'Eton: 88), when they were applied together it is possible to observe the various ways in Which the burnish affected the red slip. Darker lines on top of the red slip When the burnish is dense, it creates a surface that appears darker than the original slip. With greater distance between the burnish lines, the surface appears lighter and particular burnish lines are more discernible, especially on vessels with irregular bur- nish. Rice (1987: 151) attributes this to the uneven compaction of the clay particles in such burnishing, resulting in color differences between burnished and unburnished surfaces. Shiny lines that do not markedly darken the red slip These lines, densely applied or even few and far apart, are visible through a shiny and polished vessel surface. The burnishing was always done after the application of the slip and the high luster is due to the type of tool (soft or hard) used at different stages of burnishing (leather hard or dry) (Rice 1987: 138). It also may be the result of factors such as drying shrinkage, the properties of the clay, and the mechanics of polishing itself (Shepard 1957: 123- 124). Burnished self slip This may be understood in one of two ways: either the vessel was dipped in a solution of diluted clay and then burnished, or an unslipped surface was burnished. It is difficult to distinguish between the two, and this term is often used inconsistently in pottery descriptions. We employed this description in cases where the burnish lines were clearly visible and were identical in color to the fabric surface. QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF SLIP AND BURNISH The results of the computerized registration of slip and burnish on the bowls, kraters, jugs and juglets are presented in Tables 17-19. All data are based on fragment categories 1-537 of complete vessels and all indicative sherds from secure contexts (see p. 12); all percentages are rounded off and percentages less than 1% were not included. These figures will be analyzed in the discussion below. Table 17.

Percentages are rounded off. ** Note that the percentage of red slip on bowls in Stratum IV (64%) is higher than that presented in Mazar 1998: 377, Table 5 (48%). This discrepancy is due to reorganization of the database for the present study and does not significantly affect the results. The percentage of red-slipped kraters remains virtually the same. 146</page><page sequence="155">Table 18. Distribution of red slip by type.* a: Bowls.

DISCUSSION There is general consensus that red slip began to appear during the late 12th century in limited regions such as northern Philistia, while the addition of hand burnish began in the late 11th and early 10th cen- turies (Amiran 1969: 195; Qasilelh 83-84, 86, Table 6a; Mazar 1998: 368, 373). Holladay (1990; 1993) however, dated the inception of red-slipped and burnished pottery to the second half of the 10th century. As a result, he lowered the date of assem- blages traditionally dated to the 11th and early 10th centuries (e.g. Masos Stratum II, Qasile Strata XI-X) by at least 60 years. Mazar (1998) has refuted Holladay's arguments; the evidence from Tel Batash appears to support the conclusion that red slip on various vessels began to appear in small numbers during the late 12th and 11th centuries in the region of Philistia. In the late 12th-l 1th centuries, 8% of the vessels are red-slipped, while no burnish appears, (based on preliminary studies; see Timnah III for more accurate data). In Stratum IV, painted deco- ration virtually disappears and red slip becomes ubiquitous, along with irregular and horizontal hand burnish. In the south, this tradition became dominant, while in the northern part of the country it appears in smaller quantities. A similar development was ob- served at a number of other sites, where the gradual increase in red-slipped and hand-burnished pottery could be traced in detail at the end of Iron Age I and beginning of Iron Age II (Mazar 1998). The quantitative data from Tel Batash given in Tables 17-19 show the abundance of red slip and hand burnish in Stratum IV, as well as its gradual decline over the course of the Iron Age II. Red- slipped vessels compose 58% of the entire registered corpus (fragment categories 1-5) in Stratum IV, 23% in Stratum III and only 14% in Stratum II. Of the bowls, 64% are red-slipped in Stratum IV, 30% in Stratum III and 18% in Stratum II (see Table 17). Quantitative parallels from other sites are rare. At Lachish, counting of red slip was carried out only for bowls: 66% in Level V and 62% in Level IV had red slip (Zimhoni 1997: 115). These figures are similar to the data from our Stratum IV. The percentage for our Stratum III red-slipped bowls (30%) is very similar to that at Lachish Level III (25-30%) (Zim- honi 1997: 117). Table 19 shows the amount of each type of bur- nish on red-slipped bowls, kraters, jugs and juglets in Strata IV-II. In Stratum IV, ca. 67% of these vessels were burnished, with irregular and horizontal burnish being the dominant type (58%). At Lachish, the numbers are similar: 74% of the red-slipped bowls in Level V and 60% of the red-slipped bowls in Level IV were hand-burnished (Zimhoni 1997: 118). In our Stratum III, ca. 75% of all the red-slipped bowls, kraters, jugs and juglets were burnished; 3% had irregular burnish, 9% had a combination of irregular and horizontal hand burnish and 18% were registered as having horizontal hand burnish. However, this appears to be partially the result of registration from mixed Strata IV-III loci or fills.38 Wheel burnish constitutes 32% in Stratum III. It should be noted, however, that a certain amount of confusion between wheel burnish and horizontal hand burnish probably occurred in our registration, so the latter might be even higher. Thus, though wheel burnish was a known technique during our Stratum III, it did not entirely replace other methods of burnishing and there appears to have been an overlap between hand and wheel burnish. Lachish too provides evidence for the gradual appearance of wheel burnish. Zim- honi noted that at Lachish, only 1% of all the Level IV sherds in her study had wheel burnish, while in Level III, hand burnish completely disappears and wheel burnish climbs to 17% (Zimhoni 1997: 169- 170). Locus 4421 at Lachish demonstrates this 149</page><page sequence="158">process: on the bowls wheel burnish coexisted with hand burnish. The rich assemblage of bowls from this locus was defined by Zimhoni (1997: 173) as transitional between Lachish Levels IV and III, and thus of great significance for this issue. In Lachish Tomb 224, wheel burnish began to appear alongside hand burnish in small quantities (8%). The increase in wheel burnish in the Lachish tombs (e.g. Tomb 1002 with 34% wheel burnish) was accompanied by a corresponding decline in the use of hand burnish {Lachish III : 261-262; Zimhoni 1997: 119). Tufiiell counted 28% wheel-burnished bowls in Level III (compare to our 32% in Stratum III). Thus, the available evidence from both Tel Batash and Lachish indicates that hand burnish on red slip remained dominant at least until the end of the 9th and beginning of the 8th centuries. Zimhoni remarks that the change to wheel burnish at Lachish took place at the end of Level IV or beginning of Level III (Zim- honi 1997: 169). The changeover appears to have been gradual, and each region and site should be analyzed individually based on a quantitative approach (for further discussion, see Zimhoni 1997: 119-121; 169-170; Mazar 1998). In Batash Stratum II of the 7th century, red slip and burnish greatly diminish in quantity: 18% of the bowls and 3% of the kraters were defined as having red slip. Some of the surface treatment defined and registered as red slip may in fact have been a self slip, often burnished. Of the red-slipped bowls, kraters, jugs and juglets registered in this stratum, 81% were burnished, with wheel (ring) burnishing being the dominant type (67%). Other types of bur- nish virtually disappear. CODES FOR SLIP GROUPS USED IN THE POTTERY PLATE DESCRIPTIONS Codes A-F are an expansion of the initial pottery registration designations of slip colors. The sub- groups of each category represent nuances of hues in the color range (with Munsell Color Chart desig- nations); they are utilized only for the examples that appear in the pottery plates. A: Red Al: 7.5R 5/6-1 OR 5/6-2.5YR 5/6 A2: 10R 5/8-7. 5R 5/8 A3: 10R 4/6-7/5R 5/6 A4: 10R 4/8 B : Dark red 10R 3/6 "Dark red" refers to the color of the slip itself as discerned underneath the burnish. The darkening of the slip as a result of the burnish is a different phe- nomenon, discussed above. C : Light orangey-red 2.5YR 6/8 D: Very light red (almost transparent) DI: 10R 6/6-6/8 D2: 2.5YR 6/6 E: Dusky reddish-pink 10R 5/4 F: Self slip The color of the ceramic ware itself, usually notice- able when the vessel is burnished or smoothed.

Percentages are rounded off; subgroups of hues are treated together. Table 20 summarizes the color groups of red and self slip registered in the plates. The decrease in the darker red shades (Groups A and E ) from 40% in Stratum IV to 29% in Stratum III to 6% in Stratum II, and the increase in the lighter red (Group D) from Stratum IV to Stratum II, are evident. This transition was most likely affected by the accom- panying overall decrease in burnishing and change of burnish type, as well as other technological developments. Similar observations were made at Lachish for the transition between Levels IV and III (Zimhoni 1997: 169). The pale red slip characteristic of the vessels in Stratum II may actually be a self slip that showed the color of the clay, accentuated when burnished. 150</page><page sequence="159">The location of slip and burnish (Table 21) appears to be of chronological significance. A clear trend can be traced in the position of the surface treatment at Tel Batash. The dominant location for red slip and burnish on bowls and kraters is inside and outside during all three strata (66% in Stratum IV, 57% in Stratum III and 56% in Stratum II). However, there is an increase in surface treatment applied to the inside and part of the outside: ca. 4% in Stratum IV, increasing to 17% in Stratum III and 16% in Stratum II. It should be noted that in Strata IV-III, this pertains mostly to treatment on the inside and the upper half of the outside, while in Stratum II, most of the open vessels are treated on the inside and on the outer rim only. This process appears to contrast with the data from Lachish, where 29% of the slipped and bur- nished bowls in Level V and 36% of those in Level IV had slip and burnish inside and on the upper part of the outside (Zimhoni 1997: 116-119). This is more similar to our Stratum III than our Stratum IV. At Taanach, Rast defined the trait of slip and burnish inside and out to the point of carination as a 10th century feature, while in Period III (9th century) "burnishing on a red slip . . . tends to be done on both the exterior and interior. There are no traces of bowls being burnished on the exterior to the point of cari- nation, the marked characteristic of Period IIB (10th century)" ( Taanach /: 45). This too contradicts the evidence from Tel Batash, where the treatment of red Table 21. Location of red slip* and burnish types on bowls and kraters, Strata IV-II.

Thus, during the course of Stratum III at Tel Batash, there was a gradual change in the location of red slip and burnish from inside and outside to inside and halfway outside, though the two styles continued to coexist. G. COMMENTS ON PROVENIENCE STUDIES In addition to the pétrographie analysis conducted on a sample of pottery from Tel Batash (see pp. 15-24), Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) of 45 pottery samples from Strata III and II at Tel Batash was carried out in the INAA laboratory of the Hebrew University by J. Gunneweg and J. Yellin. The results have been published elsewhere (Gunne- weg and Yellin 1991) and thus the technical report will not be repeated here.39 The data presented below in table form (Table 22) are arranged according to the four groups of chemical composition defined by the researchers, and include references to the pottery plates and typological designations. The four groups are as follows. I: originating at Ashdod (13 samples); II: originating in the Lachish area or elsewhere in the Shephelah (12 samples, including 6 LMLK stamped jar handles); III: similar to pottery from Tel Miqne (4 samples); IV: outliers that did not match other analyzed samples (16 sam- ples). The following are our comments on these groups, based on the typological discussion. Group I The INAA found matchings for this group at Ash- dod. However, of the 13 samples in this group, only six have typological parallels at Ashdod: Lab. Nos. 16, 21, 25, 34, 37, 43. Lab. No. 22 is a LMLK jar and is unlikely to have originated in Ashdod, since its fabric appears identical to other LMLK jars belonging to Group II. Moreover, no LMLK jars have been found at Ashdod, with the exception of one stamped handle (unpublished). It is possible that the attribution of this sample to Group I is the result of a mixture of samples in the laboratory. Lab. No. 26 is a scoop (BL 18), a type that has a wide distribution at this time (Gitin 1993a). No. 29 is ajar that may have originated in the coastal plain, as it is similar to the ubiquitous coastal jar, our SJ 7, though lacking handles. Lab. No. 31 is an Assyrian-style bottle (BT 2) with close parallels at Tel Miqne but not at Ash- dod. Lab. No. 35 is a cooking pot (CP 10) that is typical of Tel Miqne and Mesad Hashavyahu, but only very few and doubtful comparisons were found at Ashdod. Thus, the attribution of half of this group to Ashdod is problematic on typological grounds. Group II This group is defined as originating in the Lachish area or elsewhere in the Shephelah. It includes six LMLK stamped jar handles (Lab. Nos. 1-6), one stamped handle of a LMLK- type jar bearing a "private" seal impression (Lab. No. 10; see the pre- vious publication of this in Mommsen, Perlman and Yellin 1984), one handle with a rosette stamp (Lab. No. 9, our SJ 9), a Judean cooking pot (Lab. No. 40, our CP 9), and three additional vessels (Lab. Nos. 12, 23, 39). Lab. No. 12 (BL 37) is typologically a coastal form; it is very common at Tel Miqne and is found at Mesad Hashavyahu, and variations of this shape were found at Ashdod and Ruqeish. Lab. Nos. 23 (KR 35a) and 39 (a three-handled jug that is similar to a decanter shape) may be considered Judean forms, though they are found in other regions as well. Thus, only one of this group (BL 37) appears exceptional and the others may well have originated at Judean workshops in the Shephelah. Group III The four samples in this group, all from Stratum II, matched contemporary samples from Tel Miqne. This compatibility is supported by their typology, as three of these, Lab. Nos. 38 (BL 17a), 42 (BL 12) and 44 (BL 37), have close parallels at Tel Miqne and are typical of the pottery industry of Tel Miqne/ Tel Batash in the 7th century. Lab. No. 41 (KR 13) is a unique shape; it may have originated at Tel Miqne, though no similar shape from this site has been published so far. Group IV This group consists of outliers, vessels with chemical compositions that are unmatched anywhere else, perhaps due to a lack of comparative material. Typologically, this is a mixed group, including coastal types and types that are common at Tel Miqne: Lab. Nos. 24 (KR lia), 28 and 45 (S J 15a), 152</page><page sequence="161">Table 22.

H. SUMMARY DISCUSSION The detailed quantitative and comparative study of the pottery assemblages of Strata IV-II has enabled us to distinguish certain patterns of distribution, as well as indications of regionalism and chronology. The use of pottery in understanding such parameters is, of course, limited and interpretive. However, the illumination of certain trends was possible, and the integration of the material into the broader historical and social picture contributes to our understanding of the period under discussion. Stratum IV The pottery assemblage recovered from Stratum IV is the most fragmentary of all the three Iron Age II strata because of the relatively scanty nature of the occupation and its apparently short duration and peaceful end. Moreover, this stratum was less widely exposed than the succeeding levels. Very few restorable vessels were found in this level, and thus the use of a rim typology was especially advanta- geous for this assemblage. Though a substantial amount of the pottery from this stratum was found on floors, some of the sherds were recovered in fills and debris. The database used for the quantitative anal- ysis of the Stratum IV assemblage consisted of 1530 registered items (see Table 5, p. 24). By far the most frequent class was the bowls, composing ca. 43% of the corpus. Three types of bowls were dominant (BL 24, BL 25 and BL 28), while the seven other bowl types in this stratum were represented by significantly smaller numbers. Kraters composed ca. 14% of the corpus and demonstrated an even more restricted typological range: there was virtually only one dominant type, KR 14 and its related shapes, KR 17 and KR 18, together con- stituting 70% of all the kraters of Stratum IV. The same is true of the cooking pots (11% of the corpus, CP 15 being overwhelmingly dominant) and storage jars (16% of the corpus, SJ 21 being virtually the only type). This points to a relatively limited range of vessel types during this stratum, indicating either a restricted market or the relative poverty and/or con- servative taste of the town's consumers at this time.40 This contrasts with the greater variety of bowl types discerned in Lachish Levels V-IV (Zimhoni 1997: 165, 170). The overwhelming characteristic of the Stratum IV pottery is the abundance of red slip and hand burnish (see Tables 17-19, pp. 146-149). Analysis of the fabrics shows that 9 of the 10 fabric groups in Stratum IV continue into Stratum III, but the pro- portions are significantly different: groups that are common in Stratum IV become less so in Stratum III, and vice versa (see Table lb, p. 22). Though this is partly due to registration of material from fills, for the most part it reflects discontinuity between Strata IV and III. Regionality Examination of the regional affinity of the dominant types of Stratum IV demonstrates a resemblance to Lachish Levels V-IV.41 Though quantitative com- parison is difficult due to the different typological divisions, it seems that similar types are found at both sites, although the proportions vary and the correlation between the sites is only moderately high at this time (see Table 23). For example, when comparing types that are mainly Stratum IV types (such as BL 25 and BL 24) to similar bowls from Lachish, the quantities are more similar to Lachish Level IV than V. On the other hand, the quantities of BL 28 and BL 1 lin Stratum IV are more like those of similar bowls (B-9 and B-7) in Lachish Level V. Lachish CP-6, which appears only in Level V, is similar to our CP 15, which is the main cooking pot type in Stratum IV. On the other hand, the most common cooking pot in Lachish Levels V-IV (CP-1) comprises only 3% of the cooking pots in our Stra- tum IV (CP 20). It can thus be concluded that the pottery of our Stratum IV covers the span of both Lachish Levels V and IV, though the degree of comparability between the two sites in these strata is only moderate: types that are dominant in Batash Stratum IV (e.g. CP 15, SJ 21, KR 14) are much less common in Lachish Levels V and IV, while a large number of types are found in Lachish Levels V-IV that are not repre- sented all in Batash Stratum IV. This situation changes in Strata III and II (see below). This appears 154</page><page sequence="163">Table 23. Quantitative comparison of Tel Batash Strata IV-III and Lachish Levels V-IV. a.

All the Batash Stratum IV types are paralleled in Beth Shemesh Stratum II42 (mostly Stratum Ha; the degenerate Philistine bell-shaped bowl appears in Beth Shemesh Stratum III but not in Stratum II). The affinity of Batash Stratum IV with Gezer Stratum VIII is relatively high, with eight comparable types, of which five are dominant Batash Stratum IV types. It is notable that the number of comparable types climbs to 12 for Gezer Stratum VII; all these types are either found in both Batash Strata IV and III or are exclusively Stratum III types. Ties with the Negev at this time are also notable (especially Arad Strata XII-XI, but also Beer-sheba Strata IX-V), suggesting mutual cultural connections between the Shephelah and the Negev.43 Perhaps the intensified settlement in southern Philistia along the Besor Brook during the 10th century provided a link with the simultaneous floruit in northern Philistia and in the central Negev (Mazar 1990: 533). The analogies to southern coastal sites are more limited and type-specific, showing similarity mainly in those forms that continue the Philistine tradition (e.g. BL 8a, BL 42 and KR 3 appear at Ashdod X and Tell el-Far'ah [S]). A few additional Batash Stratum IV forms can be found at central and northern sites along the coast (e.g. Tel Michal Strata XIV-XIII and Tel Mevorakh Strata VIII-VII). The relationship with Tell Qasile Strata IX-VIII is based on only a few shared types. However, these are all 155</page><page sequence="164">dominant Stratum IV types at Batash (e.g. BL 25, KR 14, SJ 21) and at Tell Qasile Strata IX-VIII. It is interesting to note that none of the so-called "degenerate" Philistine types is found in Qasile Strata IX-VIII. The amount and type of red slip and burnish in Qasile Strata IX-VIII and Batash Stratum IV are very similar. The possibility that trade was facilitated at this time between the coast and Shep- helah by means of the common authority of the United Monarchy cannot be ruled out. Only isolated types are comparable to Phoenician shapes in Stratum IV, especially the globular jug (JG 31, PL 79:10), which is typical of the earliest Phoe- nician pottery forms. The few other shapes are all types that continue into Stratum III (e.g. BL 27, BL 24), and in essence there is very little Phoenician affinity in Stratum IV. No Cypro-Phoenician ("Black on Red") ware has been found at Tel Batash. The degree of affinity between our Stratum IV and Miqne Stratum IV cannot be estimated at this stage of research, as full data on the latter are not yet available. However, it appears that in Batash Stratum IV, red slip and hand burnish are more developed and prominent than in Miqne Stratum IV. This is perhaps due to a chronological factor: it appears that Miqne Stratum IV is somewhat earlier than the main phase of Batash Stratum IV. Thus, Stratum IV at Tel Batash, with its relatively limited ceramic repertoire, appears to have been bound mainly to markets common to the Shephelah and Negev, and to a lesser extent to the southern and central coastal plain, with more sporadic connections to the north. This geographic distribution is similar to the situation discerned in Lachish Levels V-IV (Zimhoni 1997: 170). Though the position of Timnah on the border between the coastal plain and the Shephelah is evident at this time, the town does not become a real "crossroad of types" until the sub- sequent period; its markets are restricted and its products are simple, functional and repetitive. Relative Chronology Though there are only small differences between the pottery found in the few loci attributed to Stratum IVB and that from the main Stratum IV loci, the differences are significant. There are more Iron Age I and degenerate Philistine types in Stratum IVB; in fact, the single feeding bottle and pyxis, and one of the two basket-handled jugs, come from Stratum IVB loci. BL 42, a Philistine derivative, is found only in Strata V-IVB contexts. A relatively large number of types continue Iron I Stratum V forms: SJ 21, CP 15 and KR 14c-d (all dominant Stratum IV types), the "degenerate" Phil- istine forms (BL 8a, BL 42, KR 3, feeding bottle), and CP 4.44 Most of the dominant types of Stratum IV (BL 25, BL 28, SJ 21, CP 15, KR 14) do not continue in significant numbers, if at all, into Stratum III. On the other hand, a small number of "minority" types in Stratum IV (such as BL 32, KR 20, JG 11) continue into Stratum III and appear there in much greater numbers. This recalls the so-called "battleship curve" (McClellan 1975) and points to the longevity of certain types, especially in light of the postulated gap between Strata IV and III (see p. 275-276). Comparison to other sites reflects this typological longevity as well. At Ashdod, for example, bowls of our type BL 37 are found in Strata IX-VII and kraters of our type KR 20 in Strata X- VIII. Bowls of our type BL 27 occur at Lachish in Levels V-III and bowls of our type BL 26 at Beer- sheba in Strata IX-IV. Such conservatism in domestic vessel types in antiquity is well known; Rice notes that pottery styles do not necessarily change even during periods of "dramatic cultural change" (Rice 1987: 271). It thus appears that there is significant continuity from the Iron Age I Stratum V to the Iron Age IIA Stratum IV, while the continuity from Stratum IV to Stratum III is more one of gradual and mutual decline and buildup, suggesting relatively early dates for Stratum IV and the beginning of Stratum III (see below). However we should emphasize that the continuity from Stratum V to Stratum IV is restricted to vessel forms, while the surface treatment changes to a large extent; the painted decoration common in Stratum V disappears in Stratum IV, including the Philistine Bichrome pottery. Instead, red slip and burnish, which begin in small numbers in Stratum V, become prominent features of Stratum IV (see p. 149). The absolute dating of Stratum IV and the possible gap between Strata IV and III are discussed below (pp. 273-276). Stratum III The main assemblage of pottery from Stratum III comes from the destruction debris of Building 737, with its large numbers of LMLK jars ( Timnah /: 1 89- 193). The other pottery attributed to Stratum III comes from more fragmentary contexts, such as fills 156</page><page sequence="165">and debris in Areas D and E, and debris and patchy floors in Areas H and C. Thus, apart from a few contexts that are earlier within the Stratum III sequence (such as Locus E619, see below), the Stratum III sequence represents the late 8th century. The database used in the quantitative analysis for Stratum III comprises 2264 items (see Table 5, p. 24). Bowls continue to be the main vessel class in Stratum III, constituting ca. 55% of the pottery assemblage at this time. Of the 19 bowl types iden- tified in this stratum, there are five dominant types: BL 12, BL 13, BL 37, BL 18 and to a lesser extent BL 27, which is the only one that continues from Stratum IV.45 Kraters decline to ca. 8% of the assemblage in this stratum and there is a greater diversity of dominant types than in Stratum IV (KR 20, KR 11 and KR 6). Cooking pots comprise only ca. 4% of the assemblage, probably due to the public character of the buildings excavated in this stratum. The domi- nant type is CP 7, which is the most popular 8th century cooking pot throughout the country.46 The other type that can be considered an exclusive Stra- tum III cooking pot is CP 8, a Judean type, though only 1 1 fragmentary pots were found. Stratum III is the only period in which closed and open cooking pots coexist at the site. CP 7 is found in both IIIB and IIIA loci, while CP 8 is found only in the destruction debris of Stratum III. Storage jars are 14% of the corpus and there are now three almost equally rep- resented types (SJ 8, SJ 7 and holemouth jar SJ 10).47 The amount of red slip in Stratum III (on both closed and open forms) declines to about half of what it was in Stratum IV (see Table 17, p. 146). The amount of irregular and horizontal hand burnish diminishes alongside a marked increase in the amount of wheel burnish (see Table 19, p. 149). At Lachish, Zimhoni concluded that the transition from hand to wheel burnish took place at the transition from Level IV to Level III (Zimhoni 1997: 169). This transition apparently took place at our site between Strata IV and III. Analysis of the fabrics of the Stratum III pottery shows that there is no fabric group that is exclusively found in Stratum III (see pp. 21-22). Alongside the limited continuation of fabric groups from Strata IV to III (see above), there is a larger degree of con- tinuation from Strata III to II, in both numbers of fabric groups and their relative proportions. Regionality The largest group with distinct regional affinities in the Stratum III assemblage is typical of the 8th century Judean repertoire, though it also contains many southern coastal elements. Small numbers of Assyrian and Phoenician forms also appear (Tables 24-25). Judah : Table 24 shows that there are seven types that can be considered Judean during Stratum III. These types, which comprise 29% of the entire Stratum III corpus, include tableware, cooking ware and storage containers, indicating diverse rather than specialized importation and/or imitation. Table 25 shows the relative proportions of regional types in each class: the Judean bowls are far more plentiful than coastal bowls,48 though there are fewer Judean kraters. The amount of Judean storage jars is almost double that of the coastal storage jars. Table 24.

The degree of compatibility with Lachish rises significantly, with more than a third of the types found in our Stratum III having exact parallels in Lachish Level III (as opposed to about a quarter in Batash Stratum IV). The most significant compar- ison, both in quality and quantity, is of course the LMLK jars found in the destruction debris of this stratum (see the detailed discussions on pp. 93-96 and 191-197). Comparison to Beth Shemesh Stratum Ilb-c demonstrates almost as high a degree of cor- relation as in the previous stratum, with parallels to all the main Stratum III types (e.g. BL 12, BL 13, BL 27, CP 7). The Judean types in our Stratum III are common at sites such as Jerusalem, Tell Beit Mirsim Stratum A and Tel 'Eton. Ties with the Judean Negev remain significant, though there is somewhat less correlation with Arad Strata X-VIII than with Arad Strata XII-XI. The typological compatibility with Beer-sheba remains high, both for types that continue from Batash Stratum IV into Stratum III and for those that originate in Stratum III and continue into Stratum II. Part of this resemblance is related to the coastal affinity noted in the assemblage of Beer- sheba Strata III- II (Zimhoni 1990: 48; Singer- Avitz 1999: 3), which can be compared to the growing southern coastal connections evident in Batash Stratum III as well (see below). Undoubtedly there is increased interaction with Judah at this time, most likely reaching its peak at the end of the 8th century, when Timnah was possibly occupied by a Judean garrison in preparation for the Assyrian siege (see pp. 280-281). Coast/Philistia : Alongside the close typological relationship with Judean forms, there is a marked increase in the coastal affinity of our Stratum III assemblage, especially with Ashdod Stratum VIII. Table 24 shows that ca. 25% of the corpus are southern coastal/late Philistine forms. As with the Judean forms, the six coastal types in this stratum include both tableware and storage vessels. Types appearing in Ashdod Strata IX-VII that initially appear in Batash Stratum III (e.g. BL 37, KR 20), and types appearing in Ashdod Strata VIII-VII that appear only in Batash Stratum II, indicate that these types might have originated in Ashdod and reached the inner coastal plain in large numbers at a time conducive to such interaction, perhaps follow- ing the supposed conquest of this region by the Philistines during the reign of Ahaz (see pp. 279- 280). On the other hand, there is a longevity of types and surface treatment (the so-called "Ashdod Ware" decoration) at Ashdod that is not evident at Timnah. It seems that coastal markets remained open to the inhabitants of Timnah even when the town was under Judean jurisdiction, as Stratum III contains almost equal numbers of coastal and Judean types. Alter- natively, the mixed repertoire of Batash Stratum III may be the result of the Judean takeover, prior to 701 BCE, of a town that had previously enjoyed close relations with Ekron and Ashdod. Phoenician types comprise less than 1% of the Stratum III corpus. It seems that the limited Phoe- nician influence began early in Stratum III, with some shapes found already in Stratum IV (BL 24, BL 27). The introduction of amphorae (AM 6, AM 7) into the corpus in early Stratum III is perhaps the result of this influence. Note that the figurine molds (see pp. 203-208) in Phoenician style were found in a Stratum III context. The beginning of Assyrian influence is already felt in Stratum III, with the limited appearance of bowl types that become more popular in 7th century contexts (though never becoming very common; see below). Assyrian shapes comprise only ca. 1% of the Stratum III corpus. It is interesting to note that the shape of the Assyrian carinated bowl (BL 17, BL 22) can be compared to bowls from Groups D and E in Lachish Locus 4421 (Zimhoni 1997: 144, Figs. 3.58:4; 3.59), dated to the transition from Lachish Levels IV to III, which would mark an early appearance of such a bowl. Gezer and the Israelite Kingdom : The degree of compatibility of pottery forms between Batash Stra- tum III and Gezer Stratum VI is significantly higher than in the previous stratum. The types in common are both Judean (KR 35, CP 8, SJ 8, SJ 10) and 158</page><page sequence="167">coastal (BL 37, KR 20, SJ 7). It appears that Timnah and Gezer experienced a similar sequence of events at the end of the 8th century (see pp. 280-281). The few comparisons found at sites in the north- ern Israelite kingdom are those types that have a countrywide distribution (such as CP 7, the Assyr- ian-inspired bowls, etc.). Thus, there is virtually no evidence of northern connections in Batash Stratum III. Relative Chronology As mentioned above, almost a third of the types found in Stratum III began in Stratum IV. However, about half of these (BL 13, BL 32, KR 6, CP 7, SJ 8) are found in relatively small numbers or in unreliable contexts in Stratum IV, making it difficult to assess them as bona fide Stratum IV types. On the other hand, most of the types that begin in Stratum III continue into Stratum II, many in substantial amounts (BL 37, BL 12, KR 11, SJ 7, SJ 10, SJ 8, JG 11). Looking at Table 17 (p. 146), it can be seen that there is a larger difference between Strata IV and III than between Strata III and II in the amounts of red slip. Thus, though it does exist, the continuity between Strata IV and III is much less significant than that between Strata III and II. This reflects the postulated gap between Strata IV and III and in fact, the amount of continuity that does exist is surprising, most likely an expression of the longevity of certain pottery forms that is typical of the Iron Age II in general. Several types that begin in Stratum III (BL 15, KR 6, SJ 7) are found at Kuntillet 'Ajrud, which is dated to ca. 800 BCE. A relatively large number of Stratum III types (seven types, with another two types that span Strata IV-III) are found at Tel 'Eton, which is dated by Zimhoni to 850-750 BCE. There is also a relatively high degree of similarity between our Stratum III types and those of both Strata VII and VI at Gezer. These parallels and the fact that most of these types appear in both main Stratum III and Stratum HIB loci support an initial date for this stratum in the late 9th or early 8th century. Lachish Locus 442 1' Locus 4421 at Lachish is of potential importance for establishing the date of the beginning of Stratum III at Batash, since it was attributed by Zimhoni to a transitional phase between Lachish Levels IV and III. However, the limited repertoire from this locus, consisting mainly of bowls (Zimhoni 1997: 141-156), makes the comparison difficult (see Table 26). The comparisons are based on general shape, though there appear to be indi- vidual differences of manufacture, detail and surface treatment. Table 26. Typological comparison of bowl types in Batash Strata IV-II and Lachish Locus 4421. Batash Lachish Locus 4421 BL 24 (IV-III) Groups I-J BL 11 (IV-III) Group L BL 15 (III-II) Group A BL 17, BL 22 (III-II) Groups D-E BL 13 (IV-II) Varia (Zimhoni 1997: Fig. 3.66) The increase of wheel burnish in Locus 4421 as opposed to its scarcity in Level IV at Lachish is similar to the increase of wheel burnish between our Strata IV and III (see Table 19, p. 149). None of the types that appear only in Batash Stratum IV can be found in Locus 4421; the comparisons are to types that at Batash continue from Stratum IV to Stratum III or begin in Stratum III (and continue into Stratum II). Thus, Locus 4421 at Lachish is perhaps parallel to the beginning of our Stratum III. Batash Locus E619 : This is the only locus attributed to early Stratum III that produced restorable vessels (Photo 99; Pis. 28-29:1-5; see Timnah 1 : 197-198). Like Lachish Locus 4421, our Locus E619 contains types that begin in Stratum IV and continue into Stratum III, as well as types that are initially found in Stratum III and have 9th century parallels. None of the vessels in Locus E619 is found only in the destruction debris of Stratum III, and none of them is a type that continues viably into Stratum II. Of the 13 Photo 99. Assemblage from Locus E619, Stratum HIB. 159</page><page sequence="168">vessels in this locus (excluding the cooking pot), five bowls and one jug have red slip without burnish; one bowl has red slip and a combination of irregular and hand burnish. The large "krater jar" and two of the jugs have a self slip with vertical burnish. Three jugs are untreated. Thus, 53% of the vessels in this locus have red slip, which is closer to the ratio of Stratum IV than that of Stratum III. The parallels to the small jug in PL 29:3 are from Ashdod Stratum X and Megiddo Stratum V, and the profile of KR 35c (PL 28:7) can be compared to Iron Age I multi-handled kraters, as well as to a krater from Gezer Stratum VII. Thus, the contents of this locus should be placed typologically earlier than the end of Stratum III; they are closer to elements known from the Stratum IV corpus and its parallels. Comparison of Lachish Locus 4421 and Batash Locus E619 is virtually meaningless due to the very different nature of the assemblages. In fact, only one bowl type (BL 24) from Batash Locus E619 is found in Lachish Locus 4421, though PL 28:5-6 may possibly be compared to bowls from Lachish Locus 4421, Groups D, E and perhaps G. The contention that greater standardization of production results in more uniform forms is not necessarily reflected in Stratum III. On the one hand, the nature of the pottery (size of vessels, increase in wheel burnish, etc.) indicates a more industrial mode of production than previously; but on the other hand, there are more types within each vessel class in Stratum III. The fact that in Stratum III the corpus is more varied, both typologically and spatially, than in Stratum IV points to a greater diversity of con- sumption, wider markets, increased trade and per- haps improved resources of the town's inhabitants at this time. Stratum II The assemblage of Stratum II is the most compre- hensive of all, coming mainly from the destruction debris of four fully excavated houses, as well as other contexts. The database used for the quantitative analysis of Stratum II includes 3233 items (see Table 5, p. 24). As in the previous strata, bowls are the largest class, representing ca. 52% of the assemblage. The amount of types is virtually identical to that of Stratum III and the dominant types remain the same: BL 12, BL 13 and BL 37. Kraters comprise ca. 8% of the corpus (half of what they were in Stratum III), with KR 11 dominating the other four types. This might be because this krater was used in the highly developed regional olive oil industry, as well as in domestic settings. Cooking pots are more varied in Stratum II than the other strata, with five types, three of which are substantially represented (CP 11, CP 9, CP 10). All the cooking pots in Stratum II are closed shapes, perhaps evidence for a change in cooking and eating habits compared to the previous period. Storage jars constitute ca. 21% of the corpus, somewhat more than in the previous stratum, again perhaps due to the industrial nature of some of the Stratum II contexts. Altogether, there are nine storage jar types in Stratum II, twice as many as in the pre- vious level. The number of jug types also increases, with the dominant jug of Stratum III (JG 11) con- tinuing into Stratum II in large numbers, while a minority Stratum III type (JG 16) becomes more frequent. The amount of red slip in this stratum decreases to only ca 17% of the entire corpus. The amount of self slip comprises ca. 3% (on bowls, kraters, jugs and juglets). Of the bowls and kraters, 67% are wheel- burnished, mainly inside (see Table 19, p. 149). Regionality Many more types can be related to specific regions in Stratum II than in the previous Stratum III. Judah : As opposed to the seven Judean types found in Stratum III, there are 12 such types in Stratum II. However, the proportion of Judean types in the entire corpus (26%) remains similar to what it was in Stratum III. The types are diverse and include tableware, cooking ware and a large number of storage vessels (five types). This might indicate that some of the jars were brought to the site with their contents and not merely traded as empty containers. The typical Judean thick-based lamp (LP 3) made up almost half of the lamps in use in this stratum. Thus, while Judean forms make up about a quarter of the Stratum II corpus, just as they did in Stratum III, the greater diversity of types is notable. The correlation of coastal types between our Stratum II and Lachish Level II is interesting, since Lachish contains more coastal forms than other Judean sites at this time (i.e. BL 20, SJ 7, S J 15). Zimhoni noted the affinity of Lachish Level II to the coastal plain and claimed that it resembled Batash Stratum II more than Judean sites (Zimhoni 1990: 48).

Lachish Level II should be viewed while keeping in mind the contention that "Lachish lay in ruins during most of the 7th century" (Zimhoni 1990: 47). Does this hint at a decline in the ability of Judean markets to supply Judean towns at the end of the 7th century, forcing them to turn to the outer Shephelah and coast? Or could it be the result of Josiah's incursion into the coastal plain, with Timnah being annexed to the Judean kingdom and acting as a trade interme- diary between the coastal plain and the more impoverished Judean Shephelah (see p. 282)? Timnah is the westernmost find spot of several key 7th century Judean types, notably SJ 9 (the rosette jar) and SJ 17 (the bag-shaped jar), which are very common in 7th century Jerusalem. Timnah is also the westernmost site at which the ubiquitous Judean 7th century cooking pot (CP 9) is found (though note that the other common Judean cooking pot, CP 11, also appears at Tel Miqne-Ekron and Mesad Hashavyahu). This emphasizes the interme- diary nature of the Stratum II pottery assemblage, as well as local regional variations in the corpus. The Coastal/ "Ekronite" Regional Assemblage : Specific types of the 7th century horizon at Tel Miqne-Ekron, Timnah, Ashdod and Mesad Hasha- vyahu are BL 37, BL 12, BL 47, CH 5, KR 11, KR 12, CP 10, JG 11 and JG 16. Judean types at Mesad Hashavyahu are BL 13, BL 14, CP 11, S J 10, JG 35, JG 14 and LP 3. Phoenician/north coastal types at Mesad Hashavyahu are SJ 15a and BL 20. As seen in Table 27, the percentage of southern coastal types doubles in Batash Stratum II to com- prise 54% of the entire assemblage. Undoubtedly, the increase in coastal types, alongside the diversity of Judean types found at the site, is the hallmark of the Stratum II pottery assemblage. Among these coastal types are tableware, cooking ware and storage ves- sels. The coastal forms included a much larger number of krater types than the Judean repertoire; this might be related to the regional olive oil indus- try. Though the proportions of Judean and coastal 161</page><page sequence="170">Storage jars are about the same (see Table 28), there are five types of Judean storage jars as opposed to two types of coastal jar (including the northern coastal jar SJ 15). An interesting phenomenon is the large proportion of the Judean cooking pots (64% of all cooking pots in Stratum II). The rich and varied pottery assemblage of Stratum II is very similar to the huge assemblage recovered at Tel Miqne-Ekron Stratum IB. This is evident in the forms, the fabric and the surface treatment. However, for the time being comparison between Timnah and Ekron is based on preliminary publication of the latter' s assemblage. A more exact quantitative com- parison of the various types will be possible only after full publication. Yet the preliminary impression is that the resemblance between these sites enables us to define their 7th century pottery as a local regional assemblage, which can be named after the major city as "Ekronite" or "northern Philistine." The assem- blage is characterized by its own forms and surface treatment. Some forms in this assemblage are com- mon to both the "Ekronite" assemblage and that of southern Philistia (Ashdod and Ashkelon), but other forms and the surface treatment are typical of the "Ekronite" industry alone (see the list above). The surface treatment is characterized by a relative lack of red slip and burnish in comparison to the con- temporary assemblages of Judah or southern Philis- tia. The pottery from Mesad Hashavyahu appears to belong to the same horizon, pointing to the possi- bility that this site served as the harbor of Ekron during the 7th century. Thus, the "Ekronite" pottery assemblage may be defined as signifying a single geopolitical unit, to which Timnah belonged. Timnah's Stratum II assemblage reflects its position on the border between the city-state of Ekron and Judah in the 7th century (see further Chapter IX, pp. 281-282). Assyrian and Phoenician-Inspired Forms : The rich Stratum II assemblage also yielded a small number of forms that point to trade relations with more remote regions such as Phoenicia, northern Israel and Transjordan.49 Assyrian-inspired shapes climb to ca. 6%, while Phoenician/northern coastal forms con- stitute ca. 3%, mostly represented by the few "torpedo" jars (SJ 15) found in Stratum II. The East Greek pottery also shows that Timnah had either direct or indirect trade relations with the Greek islands, perhaps through the port of Mesad Hasha- vyahu. Relative Chronology The large degree of continuity between Strata III and II was noted above. However, alongside this sequence, there are a number of types that are found only in Stratum II. The most marked example is the cooking pots, five types of which begin in Stratum II. Storage jars too demonstrate this trend, though to a lesser extent. Two of the three dominant types of Stratum III (SJ 7 and S J 10) continue in even larger numbers in Stratum II, while the third type (SJ 8, LMLK jars) continues in much smaller amounts. On the other hand, five of the nine storage jars types in Stratum II begin in Stratum III and mark a very diverse typological repertoire for this class at this time. Four additional jug types begin in Stratum II, albeit in small numbers. This demonstrates con- tinuity from Stratum III alongside the wider variety of types that develop in Stratum II. A similar diver- sity of types was one of the hallmarks of Level II at Lachish as well (Zimhoni 1990: 48). As at Lachish, the continuity in several forms between Strata III and II indicates the continuity and longevity of pottery forms in the Iron Age II, which is typical of each of the regions of the country throughout the period. Regionalism and long-term local traditions appear to be strong in this period, and the changes in the pottery industry in each region were gradual. In this slow development, some forms had a longer time span than others. The end of Stratum II can be firmly dated to the last years of the 7th century (see p. 273). General Summary A total of 107 types and subtypes was defined in Strata IV-II, along with a number of forms that were not classified in the type series. Of these numbered types, nine are exclusively Stratum IV, three are exclusively Stratum III, and 15 are found only in Stratum II.50 All the rest are types that continue between strata in varying quantities. However, between Strata IV and III, the proportions of each continuing type are very uneven and they increase or decrease in significant amounts. A dif- ferent picture emerges for Strata III and II, in which a number of types are represented almost equally. On the other hand, Stratum II has the highest degree of innovation. Thus, it seems that while the degree of ceramic continuity between the Iron Age II strata at Timnah in general is relatively high, the social and geopolitical implications of this may be 162</page><page sequence="171">varied (see pp. 279-282 for further discussion). The excavated areas in Strata IV and III are much smaller than those of Stratum II, and thus a func- tional comparison between these strata would be premature. Yet it appears that the Stratum IV assemblage is mainly domestic. The Stratum III Building 737 appears to have had some public function (at least in its final stage), as did the Stratum III structures in Area H, while other assemblages are domestic. The corpus of Stratum II combines domestic and industrial functions (see pp. 172-176). The comprehensive quantitative study of the Tel Batash Iron Age II corpus allows us to present an exhaustive picture of the finds, and further com- parative study is now possible based on these data. I. DISTRIBUTION OF FINDS, ACTIVITY AREAS AND POPULATION ESTIMATES IN STRATUM II BUILDINGS The four buildings whose finds are presented below were destroyed in the violent conflagration that ter- minated Stratum II. All contained rich deposits of restorable vessels and other finds.

Graph 15 (p. 174) shows the data in graphic form. 164</page><page sequence="173">The spatial distribution of the vessels and objects found in situ in each building is presented in Figs. 11-13. Table 34 (pp. 176-181) lists all the finds in each building, according to specific rooms and spaces, in the order in which they appear in the plates. Only those vessels and objects whose exact find spot could be determined were marked on the figures; each is represented by a symbol explained in the key that accompanies Fig. 11 (p. 166). BUILDING 743 Pis. 31-40 ; Table 34a; Fig. 11; Graph 15; Photos 100-102 (Timnah I: 205-211). Floor space: 51 sq. m. The western space in this building (743) contained the vast majority of vessels, along with the two southern rooms (778 and 746). The space to the east of the pillars (181 and 745), the only space with a cobble floor, which was postulated to have been a roofed animal shelter ( Timnah I: 207), yielded rela- tively few finds. In the western space (743), there were two main concentrations of vessels: in the entrance to the building and near the stone staircase opposite this entrance (including the unique perforated storage jar, PI. 35:9). Note the concentration of four cooking pots near the entrance of the building. The fact that no oven was found in this building indicates that cooking was done outside the building proper. Sev- Photo 100. Reconstruction of the plan of Building 743 on the porch of the Institute of Archaeology. eral scattered loomweights were found here as well. The other main concentration of vessels was in the southern part of this space and in the entrance to Room 778. This latter concentration was found near a group of 41 loomweights that lay along the eastern face of Wall 783, suggesting the existence of a loom Photo 101. Assemblage from Building 743. 165</page><page sequence="174">Fig. 11. Distribution of finds in Building 743. at this spot (see p. 248). It appears that the major domestic activities of food preparation, weaving, etc. took place in the western space. The nature of the finds in the two southern rooms implies that these were dining and living areas. As opposed to the finds in the western half of the main hall, which were concentrated in several groups, the finds in the two southern rooms were scattered throughout the center 166 28 29 _ i i- tí ^ - ' ' - J '|' s 779 * 181 ' ' ' J 1 '¿®10512«123® s p ' ' ' V J7 u 24 ' ' ' ' '¿r V J7 CD u ®25 0 24 ' ' ' ' ' ^ 190 ^ ' ' ' 1 ' „8? 30 37 ' ' I I ' 1 ' -K „8?

Of the 98 vessels in this house, bowls were the most common (ca. 36%), with BL 12 by far the most frequent, as throughout Stratum II. The percentages of kraters, cooking pots and storage jars were rela- tively similar (respectively ca. 10%, 12% and 14%). KR 1 1 was the main krater type in the building; KR 12 and KR 13 were virtually unique in the entire corpus, suggesting that they might have been con- sidered special vessels in this household. The large size of KR 35b (two of which were found here) points to a storage function. The small closed vessels too, jugs (ca. 9%), juglets (ca. 7%) and bottles (ca. 6%), appeared in roughly equal proportions The number of storage jars (14) in Building 743 most likely fulfilled the storage needs of the inhabitants, as this seems to be an average number (see discussion below). More than half of these are SJ 7, though the house contained several other jars as well (including three unstamped LMLK jars). BUILDING 950 Pis. 41-53 ; Table 34b; Fig. 12; Graph 15; Photos 103-105 (Timnah I: 211-218). Floor space: 95.4 sq. m. Though this building shares many characteristics with the other excavated domestic houses at Tel Batash, it is differentiated by several features, par- ticularly the presence of an oil press in the south- eastern corner, as well as a number of additional rooms to the north and east of the main pillared hall. This building, which was larger than the others, yielded 126 vessels. The majority of vessels and objects were con- centrated in the space east of the pillars (beaten earth floor 950 and 946). An additional concentration was found to the west of the pillars, on paved floors 960 167</page><page sequence="176">Photo 103. Assemblage from Building 950. Photo 104. Assemblage from Building 950. 168</page><page sequence="177">Fig. 12. Distribution of finds in Building 950. For key to symbols, see Fig. 11. and 920 in the south of this space; only a few vessels were found on beaten earth floor 957 in the north of this space. Room 982 on the east of the building also contained a small assemblage. Fewer vessels were found scattered in the large anteroom 958 on the north of the building, accessed from the street, and a few vessels came from inside the central oil press vat (965) and the small cooking area in the northwest (909). Unlike in the other buildings, the storage jars slightly outnumbered the bowls (ca. 29% for storage jars and 25% for bowls). The amount of storage jars in this building is more than double than in the other houses, probably due to the industrial function of the oil press, in addition to the storage needs of the inhabitants. The relatively large amount of jugs (ca. 12%) may also be related to the industrial activity. In contrast to Building 743, BL 37 vies with BL 12 as the most frequent bowl type. SJ 7 is the most com- mon (12 out of 37 jars), though the large number (seven) of LMLK jars (SJ 8) is noteworthy. BUILDING F608 Pis. 65-70; Table 34c; Fig. 13; Graph 15; Photo 106 (Timnah 1 : 240-242). Floor space: 46.2 sq . m. Building F608 contained a total of 67 vessels, the majority of which were concentrated in the eastern 169</page><page sequence="178">Photo 105. Storage jars from Building 950. Photo 106. Jugs and amphorae from Building F608. 170</page><page sequence="179">Fig. 13. Distribution of finds in Buildings F608 and F607. For key to symbols, see Fig. 11. space (on beaten earth floor F608 and, to a lesser extent, its southern continuation, F646), mainly in the area between Oven F643 and the two southern- most pillar bases. Fewer vessels and objects were found on the cobble-paved western space (F648, F633). It is not clear whether these relatively few vessels were scattered into this space at the time of destruction or were used here. To the south of Wall F639, in Locus F637, the vessels were dispersed, probably due to the later disturbance of this space. As in the other buildings, the most numerous class were the bowls (25 examples, ca. 37% of the vessels in the building). This house contained the largest number (four) of mortaria (BL 20). The large number of chalices found in this building (four) is also unique. Compared to Buildings 743 and 950, the amount of kraters, cooking pots and juglets is small, and that of jugs exceptionally small (three jugs, ca. 4%) compared to the other three buildings. The 16 storage jars are a large number for such a small house. Most of them are the typical SJ 7, but two are of the Judean four-handled type that are sometimes impressed with rosette seals (SJ 9). Indeed, three rosette-impressed handles were found in this building, but none could be fitted to any of the restored jars (see Cahill, this volume, pp. 197-201). The imported Samian amphora from this building should be noted; it is one of the few complete large Greek vessels found in Israel in a late 7th century context (see Magness, this volume, pp. 141-144). It perhaps hints that the owner of this house was a wealthy man who was involved with trade. 171</page><page sequence="180">Photo 107. Assemblage from Building F607. BUILDING F607 Pis. 71-75; Fig. 13; Graph 15; Photo 107 (Timnah I : 242-244). Floor space : 32.4 sq. m. This building displays many similarities to its eastern counterpart, Building F608. A total of 62 vessels were found in it. Though the number of vessels is similar to that of Building F608, there are differences in the proportions of classes and their spatial dispersion. Particularly noteworthy are the large numbers of jugs and juglets and the excep- tionally small number of storage jars (five) as opposed to Building F608. It is possible that con- tainers of perishable materials were in more common use for storage in this house than in the others. It is postulated that the area to the east of the central support pillars (beaten earth floor F607) served for food preparation and domestic industries (Timnah 1 : 234). The question of its having been roofed was discussed in the previous volume (ibid.: 261). This space contained a dense concentration of vessels and objects, especially between and south of the southern pillar and cooking installation F624. In fact, virtually no vessels were found in other parts of the building; their presence in these other spaces appears to be the result of dispersion at the time of destruction rather than their use in these areas. Several objects were found in the stone vat situ- ated in the entrance to the building (F621), indicating that the vat was not in use at the time of the destruction ( Timnah I: 243) or perhaps that the ves- sels were thrown into the vat at this time. A fragment of a round stone altar (PI. 75:11, see p. 244) was found in Room F919, and a unique iron spear (PI. 70:5; p. 205) in Locus F607. DISCUSSION The issue of floor space and population estimates in relation to the four houses discussed here was addressed in Timnah I: 260-262. The number and types of vessels and other objects found in a single household must reflect to some extent the number of people inhabiting this house and their activities. The study of activity areas has attracted much attention in recent archaeological literature, e.g. for Chalcolithic Shiqmim (Levy and Holl 1987) and Iron Age Beer- sheba (Singer- Avitz 1996). The latter study is par- ticularly relevant to our subject, as the Beer-sheba houses recall ours. Both these studies cite theoretical literature. Here we have not attempted to present a comprehensive discussion of the subject, but have presented the data with minimal analysis. Many methodological questions concerning this issue remain open. Reservations about conclusions drawn from comparative distributional ceramic studies are expressed by Rice (1987: 293-301). The amount and variability of vessels in each household are influ- enced by a wealth of factors that are mostly unidentifiable, such as the multifunctional nature of 172</page><page sequence="181">many vessels, the geographic setting of the site, cultural traditions of hospitality, dietary laws, the proximity to production centers and modes of pro- duction. Moreover, ethnographic studies that com- pare relatively modern pottery-consuming societies with ancient households are problematic. How can one calculate the number of vessels needed for one family at a particular moment? To what extent does the dispersion of vessels in the various parts of the building indeed reflect the function of the various rooms, or simply represent the situation in the building at the time of its destruction (see below)? The estimation of the population of a single house may be based on various criteria ( Timnah 1 : 261). The minimum number can be estimated at 3-5 per- sons and the maximum at 7-9. From the functional point of view, bowls and kraters can be considered serving vessels for various foods, while jugs were probably used for liquids (water, wine, milk etc.) and juglets for serving or handling oils and ointments. Bowls were most probably the most common serving vessel. The numbers of bowls in each of the build- ings at Tel Batash is 23-35. The average numbers presented in Table 29 would thus result in a number of 4-8 bowls per person, perhaps indicating differ- ential use of this vessel for various foods.52 At Tel Miqne the numbers are much higher (101 bowls in Building I and 86 in Building II). This large number perhaps indicates complex serving habits or alter- native uses for these vessels. Kraters were most probably used for communal serving of food and perhaps some food preparation as well. The range of 5-11 kraters in each household emphasizes the importance of these vessels in food preparation and consumption. The numbers of kraters and jugs in the Tel Batash houses are similar; on the average, jugs are 10% of the entire assemblage. The number of cooking pots varies from 11-12 in the two eastern houses to 4-6 in the Area F houses. This might reflect the number of people living in each house, or different use functions for different types of pot, as an expression of culinary and cooking habits (Skibo 1992: 33^2). The two major types of cooking pots - open and shallow, and narrow-necked - possibly reflect two different activities; the open cooking pots were probably used for cooking more solid dishes like lentils, grain dishes, etc. (the Biblical nezid ), while the narrow- necked pots were perhaps used for liquids, such as soup, dairy products, etc. It should be noted that the evidence for cooking activity in each of the houses varies: in Building 743, no such installation was found, in Building 950 there were a small oven inside the house and a large oven in a special room outside the building, in F608 there was an oven, and F607 had perhaps one fire pit (F624) but no oven. The relatively large number of storage jars (comprising the second largest class in the houses following the bowls) suggests a self-contained domestic economy that was able to provide its own storage needs. Lamps are surprisingly few and the means of illumination are not clear. Notably, within each vessel class there is a rela- tively large degree of type variation (see Table 31). This implies that although "majority" types existed (e.g. BL 12, S J 7), these households used different types of bowls, kraters, cooking pots, storage jars and jugs simultaneously, each perhaps serving a different function or used on a different occasion. This implies a vital market where the consumers had access to a relatively wide range of ceramic goods and there was more diversity than standardization, at least on the level of consumption (Rice 1987: 201- 204). Though relatively large variability of class and type would seem to imply a rather high socio-eco- nomic status for the household, this variety should be viewed together with the relative poverty of the inhabitants as reflected in the small objects.53 The basic similarity of the domestic nature of the assemblages makes it difficult to determine whether the quantitative differences between the assemblages in each of the houses reflect social stratification of any kind within the town. It is interesting to examine the results of the dis- tribution analysis of our finds in light of Geva's hypothesis that the material culture at a particular site may reflect the contingencies of a population pre- paring for an approaching destruction (Geva 1989: 6- 7). All four houses were destroyed by fire during the Babylonian conquest of Timnah. A basic question concerning the large number of vessels and their location as found in each house is whether this reflects the normal situation, or whether this was the result of an emergency such as a siege. Thus, for example, it is possible to imagine a scenario in which refugees from nearby hamlets and villages found refuge in the fortified city during the Babylonian siege, bringing with them part of their own house- holds. A plethora of storage jars may indicate prep- arations to withstand a siege, or a variety of vessels might reflect the influx of new population elements, 173</page><page sequence="182">Graph 15. Distribution of pottery classes in Stratum II buildings (%) 174</page><page sequence="183">such as refugees or troop reinforcements. The dis- tribution of finds at Tel Batash suggests that the destruction took the populace by surprise, or that no special precautions or activities took place within the houses to prepare for imminent siege or attack. The number of storage jars in the houses is somewhat low compared to the finds from contemporary Tel Miqne (see Table 32). The high number of storage jars in Building 950, which recalls the buildings at Tel Miqne, may be explained as related to the oil press operation in this building. The only weapons in our houses are the iron spear in Building F607, the iron arrowhead in Building 743 and the bone arrowhead in Building 950. There is virtually no evidence in the houses for hasty renovations that would imply the arrival of refugees, aside from the blockage of an entrance to the inner room in Building F608 ( Timnah 1 : 244) and some evidence of minor local repairs in Building 950 (ibid.: 215) and Building F608 (ibid.: 240-241). It should be noted that at nearby Tel Miqne-Ekron, even larger numbers of vessels were recovered in each of the houses of Stratum IB (see Table 32), which was also destroyed by the Bab- ylonians: "Industrial Building 1" (Rooms 14, 15) contained 196 vessels and "Industrial Building 2" (Rooms 26 and 27) contained 181 vessels (Gitin 1989a: 28-39). These buildings are no larger than ours, and "Industrial Building I" recalls the plan of our two buildings in Area F. Quantitative typological and functional compar- ison to pottery assemblages from other sites is fraught with methodological and technical diffi- culties, as detailed by Eshel ( Jerusalem IV: 19, 21- 22). Table 32 presents a selection of sites whose publications enable such a comparison with a fair degree of reliability. However, the comparability of these sites to the Stratum II buildings at Tel Batash should be viewed with caution, since the dates and character of most of the sites differ from our houses and variations may be explained as chronological, as well as functional or regional. The large numbers of small open and closed vessels are as expected in a household setting such as the Stratum II buildings at Tel Batash, as opposed to buildings of special nature such as the complex at Kuntillet 'Ajrud. In this sense, the high percentage of .small vessels and cooking pots at Beer-sheba is surprising, in light of the assumed public admin- istrative function of the pillared buildings (Herzog 1997: 247). Despite Kenyon's interpretation of Cave I as a favissa , Eshel understood both Cave I and Cave II in Jerusalem as having been used to store a normal household repertoire of pots {Jerusalem IV : 21). If indeed these assemblages reflect typical domestic corpora, then the low percentage of storage jars (a ratio similar to our Building F607) should be noted. Despite chronological and regional differences, Table 32. Comparison of the Tel Batash Stratum II house assemblages to other sites (%).

The assemblages of Giloh and Kuntillet 'Ajrud are exceptional in both time and function. There is a relative similarity between the pro- portions of vessel classes at Tel Miqne and Tel Batash in contemporary destruction levels, though it should be kept in mind that at Tel Miqne the total number of vessels in each building was much larger. The proportions are especially similar to those in our Building 950, which was an industrial building with an oil press, like the two buildings at Tel Miqne. Table 33 shows the vessel distributions in the two buildings excavated in Areas D and E and the rest of the loci in each area (mainly streets and open spaces). The percentages of kraters and jugs in both buildings as compared to the rest of Areas D and E are essentially similar. In both buildings the percentage of cooking pots is higher than in the rest of the areas. While in Building 743 the percentage of storage jars is similar to the rest of Area D, Building 950 has twice the amount. This probably reflects the special nature of Building 950. An interesting point is that the bowls in the buildings comprise about half of what they do in the rest of their areas. Table 33.

Tables 35-37 present the results. Comparative studies of capacities of vessels in the Iron Age are essentially lacking. We have presented data on this subject while being aware of the need of further study. At first glance, it appears that none of the types is consistent in capacity. Thus the vessels, even including storage jars of very distinct type, were apparently not man- ufactured according to a standard unit of measure for use in trade or administration. Table 35.

Dothan maintained that ridged bowls initially appear at Ashdod only in Stratum VIII ( Ashdod I: 135), they in fact already appear in Stratum X (e.g. Ashdod IV: Fig. 7). 2 A few instances of depleted bar handles on bowls may be found in later contexts, examples of which are Tell el- Kheleifeh : PL 152:5-6 (late 8th to early 6th centuries) and Tawilan : Fig. 6.5:1, late Iron Age II. 3 The date of Beer-sheba Strata IX and VIII may be lowered to the 10th century; see Mazar 1990: 398-399, note 4; 402, note 26. See also note 43 below. 4 The only example from a Level IV locus at Lachish {Lachish V: PI. 44:4) came from a context (Locus 70) that contained what appears to be an 8th century group. This locus is not sealed by a floor of either Level III or II, and though thin debris of these levels is shown on the plans, the attribution of this locus to Level IV may be questioned. Indeed, the illustrated pottery from Locus 70 typologically belongs to Level III. 5 Note that while Franken and Steiner date the rich assemblages from Caves I and II in the City of David to no later than 700 BCE {Jerusalem II: 30, 50), Eshel dates them to the first half of the 7th century, based on his conclusions from Lachish {Jerusalem IV: 61-62). 6 It is possible that what was registered as light red slip is in fact self slip, since the distinction between them was often not clear. 7 Zimhoni notes that the bowls included with her Type B- 15, termed "round-carinated bowls," which are always undecorated, were found only in Level IV at Lachish and thus may be considered an identifying vessel type for this stratum (Zimhoni 1997: 95). Our BL 24 includes very similar bowl shapes, but they are usually red-slipped and burnished. 8 Note a bowl of this type found at a site identified as a farmhouse to the north of Jerusalem, dated from the second half of the 8th century to the end of the Iron Age (Seligman 1994: Fig. 9:4). Seligman disputes the use of this particular "scoop" for food distribution because of a burnt lime encrustation that covered it (ibid.: 71). 9 M. Dothan mentions an unpublished shallow black- slipped and ridged-rim bowl found in the Temple Mount excavations in Jerusalem {Ashdod IV: 35, note 12). 10 Note a tall, two-handled krater from Kuntillet 'Ajrud with a rim shape and surface treatment that recall those of our KR 18a {'Ajrud: Fig. 6:4). The shape of this vessel was compared by Ayalon to imported Cypriot Bichrome II ware, as well as to kraters of the Black on Red family, while the decoration is reminiscent of the Phoenician "red polished" ware, like that at Ruqeish (ibid.: 155). However, our rim fragments are too small for confirmation of these analogies. 11 Note also Zimhoni 1990: Fig. 28:6 (Lachish Level II, Group IIF), a "hybrid" type, which has a rounded rim like KR 35a but handles extending from the rim top like KR 35d, together with the stump base of our SJ 18 (see also our S J 14b below). 12 For example our PI. 3:1 (Stratum IVB); Megiddo I: Pis. 21:125; 32:167 (Stratum V); Taanach: Fig. 41 (Period IIB); Ashdod //-///: Fig. 4:4 (Stratum X); Samaria III: Fig. 21:6-7 (Period VI); Megiddo I: PI. 18:89 (Strata IV- III); a nine-handled krater from Tel Rehov from a 10th- 9th century context (unpublished); Lachish III: PI. 82:124 (Level II); Gezer III: PL 11:7 (Stratum VII); Tel Miqne: Gitin 1995: 66, Fig. 4.6:3 (Stratum IB). The latter had holes in the lower part of the body, indicating that it was used to separate oil from water in the oil- producing industry at Tel Miqne. Note also the six handles on the lower part of our KR 30 (PL 47:9), which was also found in an oil-producing context (see p. 74). 13 Freud {Tel 'Ira: 200) notes an unpublished example of such a krater from Lachish Level III as well. 14 The date of the Negev highland sites is debated: Cohen, Meshel and others date them to the 10th century (Meshel and Cohen 1980: 80; Cohen 1980: 77-78; 1986) while others (Finkelstein 1983; Eitam 1988) date them to the 1 1th century. We agree with the 10th century date (Mazar 1990: 395, 401, notes 22-23 for references). 15 For the different dates for Caves I and II in Jerusalem, see note 5. 16 Though the excavators date Stratum III at Aroer to the 7th century, a date in the 8th century appears more plausible for the published pottery (Singer- Avitz 1999: 56). 17 Ayalon claims that these were of northern origin and were brought to Kuntillet 'Ajrud from Israel, while in Judah and along the coast the cooking pots were different {'Ajrud: 193). However, in light of the parallels presented here, and the inconclusive results of pétrographie and INAA studies carried out on this type at Kuntillet 'Ajrud, this conclusion is questionable. 18 M. and Y. Aharoni propose a 9th century beginning for this type, based on its appearance in Stratum XI at Arad (Aharoni and Aharoni 1976: 76); however, the neck shape is somewhat different and it is the rim rather than the neck that is ridged {Arad: 8, Fig. 9:5). The narrow- necked, one-handled cooking jug that was found at Arad in Strata XII and XI (e.g. ibid.: Figs. 5:6; 9:6) and also at Beer-sheba in Stratum VI may have influenced the development of the narrow-necked, two-handled cooking pot that becomes so popular in the second half of the Iron Age II. Though such a cooking pot is published as coming from Lachish Level IV {Lachish V: Fig. 44:6), it should be dated to Level III (see note 4). 19 These include the cited example from Tell Qasile, which comes from a context that also includes 8th century 183</page><page sequence="192">forms; En-Gedi: Fig. 29:21, an example from the Clark Collection (which might actually indicate an 8th century tomb or occupation at En-Gedi); a small sherd from Gezer Stratum V (Gezer III: PL 27:15), which could have originated in an earlier level; a neck from Ramat Rahel Stratum V {Ramat Rahel I: Pl. 1 1 :22), which also could be 8th century (see ibid.: 41). Its appearance in Stratum VII at Tel 'Ira ( Tel 'Ira: Fig. 6.66:8, 15) supports our contention that this stratum should be dated to the 8th century (see below, note 23). 20 Zimhoni mentions that these rims belong to two-handled jars, but does not show any illustrations of the complete form. 21 These handles are Pl. 19:5-7 (No. 7 with a personal seal impression) and PL 61:13. The clay is reddish-yellow with numerous gray and black inclusions. This recalls the fabric of Zimhoni's Group HIB, "LMZJC- like "jars. INAA conducted on the latter proved them identical to the LMLK jars, despite the visibly different ware (Zimhoni 1990: 19). The same results were obtained in the INAA analysis conducted on two of the above-mentioned handles from Tel Batash (PL 19:5-6). 22 Though note our discussion of S J 21c above, where a type that appears at Lachish Levels VI-V has a similar shape and ware to the LMLK jars. Evidence for the appearance of LMLK or "LMLK- like" jars prior to the late 8th century has been found in the new excavations of Tel Safit (A. Maeir, personal communication) and Tel Beth Shemesh (Bunimovitz and Lederman 2000: 257, Fig. 2). 23 The assemblage of Tel 'Ira Stratum VII appears to us to be similar to that of Beer-sheba Stratum II. The destruction of both these levels was apparently at the end of the 8th century, most probably as a result of the consequences of Sennacherib's invasion (such as incursions by nomads from the Negev into the Beer- sheba Valley) (see also p. 280 and note 3 there). 24 However, since Gezer was part of the Northern Kingdom until 722 BCE, one might ask to what extent the Assyrian conquest of the kingdom affected the city (see also p. 280 and note 3 there). 25 Note Zimhoni's storage jar Group IIA (Zimhoni 1990: Fig. 20:1), composed of only one complete and one partial example, found exclusively in Level II at Lachish. In the illustration, these jars appear very similar to the 8th century LMLK jars. Though the description of the fabric is different from that of the typical LMLK jars ("coarser, pinkish brown on the exterior, grey and porous on the interior"), one such jar was subjected to INAA and proved to have identical clay composition to the LMLK jars (ibid.: 30-31). However, Zimhoni concluded that Group IIA constitutes a different production line and should not be considered a late continuation of the LMLK type. Incidentally, this fabric description sounds similar to that of some of the "rosette" jars at Tel Batash (our S J 9). 26 An additional 22 unstamped LMLK jars have been identified in the destruction debris of Stratum IB at Tel Miqne (of which five have been restored). Though only 17% of the pottery of this stratum has been processed at the time of writing, it appears that there are many more such jars in 7th century contexts at that site (our thanks to Dr. S. Gitin for this information). 27 PL 104:19 was found inserted into Floor 501, which, though attributed to the Stratum III gate room, was not sealed by a Stratum II floor; the jar was probably sunk from a Stratum II surface only a few centimeters higher. 28 The appearance of two storage jars of this type ascribed by Aharoni to Level III at Lachish, found together with several LMLK jars in Locus 63 {Lachish V: PL 45:14-15), was already noted as exceptional (only one of these, PL 45:14, was actually considered equivalent to our S J 9 (Keim and Mazar 1985: 119, note 10). However, Zimhoni's analysis of Locus 63 has shown that the part of the locus which contained the "rosette" jar should be ascribed to Level II (Zimhoni 1990: 8-9, 32). 29 Tufhell's Types 465 and 498 {Lachish III: 316) have identical rims to our S J 10a, but have two handles. Type 498 was the jar used for the Lachish ostraca found in the gate guardroom destruction debris of Level II. Our PL 57:22 perhaps belongs to such a jar. Zimhoni claimed that this type is rare at Lachish {'Eton : 76) and she did not include it in her discussion of the pottery at Lachish (1997). 30 M. and Y. Aharoni concluded that the squat, burnished decanter with a thick rim is common in the 8th century at Judean sites (e.g. Tell Beit Mirsim Stratum A, Beer-sheba Stratum II) and does not continue into later levels (Aharoni and Aharoni 1976: 84, Fig. 3:13). They maintained that the 7th century "Judean" decanter (e.g. Arad Strata VII- VI, Lachish Level II) is larger, has a longer cylindrical body and is crudely manufactured with no burnish (ibid.: 86). However, decanters with squat proportions may also be found in late 7th century contexts and have self slip and burnish as well (e.g. En- Gedi: Fig. 9:7-10 and our PL 37:1). 3 1 In Judah one can find several rims of the "northern" type in late 8th-early 7th century contexts, such as two necks and rims from the City of David, Jerusalem: Jerusalem IV: Fig. 8:1 (Cave II) and Fig. 31:5 (Cave I); however, these were flasks rather than decanters. 32 The excavation was conducted by R. Shimron on behalf of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University. 33 For a discussion of these types in a broader context, with additional references, see Waldbaum and Magness 1997. 34 The results of analysis have traced the origin of this type of amphora to Samos; Dupont 1983: 42. For more on Samian amphorae see Oren 1984: 25, 27. 35 For discussion and references to Wild Goat Ware from other eastern Mediterranean sites see Waldbaum and Magness 1997: 28-30. Cook (1960: 125) describes the 184</page><page sequence="193">ware of Wild Goat Style pottery as follows: "The clay used is generally coarse and gritty; it is usually fired from sandy brown to pink. . . The slip of the Early and Middle phases is thick and ranges from yellow through cream to a near white." See also the discussion of Wild Goat Ware in Ploug 1973: 43-69. 36 The basic work on archaic Corinthian pottery is Payne 1931, discussing Early Corinthian alabastra on p. 281. For a more recent study see Stillwell and Benson 1984; see also Weinberg 1943. The Tel Batash vessel is comparable in size to the alabastron illustrated in Weinberg 1943: PI. 28:197, which is 8.6 cm high. However, the figure on the Tel Batash piece was a seated griffin or sphinx, facing left. 37 The data presented in the tables do not include chalices (some of which bore red slip) or red-slipped non- indicative sherds (categories other than fragment categories 1-5; see p. 12). However, these numbers are small in relation to the entire database and do not alter the results. The definition of "red slip" in the tables included slip categories 1, 2 and 5 (see p. 13). 38 For example, several constructional fills in Area E, such as Loci E705, E708a, E811. 39 Note that though the title of that study pertains to "Ceramics of the 7th Century BC," in fact samples belonging to Stratum III, the 8th century, were included as well. 40 Though sherds of bowls of different types from those presented in the typology were found (see "Varia"), these were not plentiful. It should not be inferred that this limited diversity necessarily represents standardization and mass production; it rather reflects many other possible factors, such as complexity of the community, type of production and distribution, etc. (Rice 1987: 201- 204). 41 Zimhoni uses the term "identifying vessel types" for those vessel groups that appear in only one of the strata. At Lachish, there were three such types in Level V and five in Level IV (Zimhoni 1997: 165). In Batash Stratum IV, there are eight such types, though this number should perhaps be raised to 12, since there are four additional Stratum IV types that are present in Stratum III at less than 1% and thus should really be considered Stratum IV types. This difference might be due to the relatively sparse nature of the excavation of Lachish Level V and/or to the great degree of continuity between Lachish Levels V and IV, as opposed to the relative discontinuity between Batash Strata IV and III. 42 Zimhoni notes that cooking pots like our CP 20 do appear in the renewed Beth Shemesh excavations (Zimhoni 1997: 122). 43 Though an 1 1th century date has been proposed for Beer- sheba Strata IX-VIII (Mazar 1990: 398-399, note 4), examination of the meager pottery that has been published ( Beer-s heba II : Figs. 17-20) shows that all these types can be found in 10th century contexts (though some began in the 11th century). The few Bichrome Philistine sherds found may be strays; one (ibid.: Fig. 17:16) is from Pit 1321 and the other (ibid.: Fig. 19:8) from Locus 2038, which is missing from the locus index. There are also types that certainly do not belong to Iron Age I (e.g. Fig. 17:19). Note the large amount of red slip, as well as some hand burnish, in these strata. 44 The number of continuing types might rise with the completion of the current study of the Iron Age I ceramics of Tel Batash. 45 Of these 19 types, seven are represented by only ca. 1% in Stratum III, so in fact, there are about two thirds of this number of types. 46 The 1 5 registered sherds of Stratum IV CP 1 5 are from fills and should be discounted as Stratum III types. 47 See discussion on p. 92 concerning the question of SJ 21 as a viable Stratum III type. 48 Note that BL 12 is considered Judean in 8th century contexts on the basis of the large amounts of parallels for this shape, albeit with a slightly lower carination, in Judean sites. The subsequent development of this bowl in Stratum II, especially the variation with the external groove, takes place in the coastal sphere, and thus it is considered a coastal type in Stratum II. 49 The types that have parallels with Transjordan are basically Phoenician, Assyrian or Judean; the only shapes that might have originated in Transjordan are BL 21 (see discussion on p. 52) and BT 3 (see discussion on p. 131); both are probably Assyrian-inspired as well. 50 The exclusively Stratum IV types are BL 8a, BL 42, BL 45, KR 3, KR 18, KR 17, CP 4, CP 20, JG 30. This number should be increased to 14 types when considering the types that continue to be found in Stratum III at only 1% or less (BL 25, BL 26, BL 26a, BL 11, JG 8b). 51 It should be noted that the total numbers of vessels from each building in this chapter do not exactly match the figures published in Timnah /: 210-211, 217-218, due to more careful counting. 52 The amount of vessels may reflect not only the number of people in the household but also age variability, since children and adults have different eating habits and requirements (Rice 1987: 294). 53 The relative scarcity of small items, especially "luxury" objects, might be due to the fact that the populace was able to take such objects with them, even in the haste of evacuation. 185</page><page sequence="194">CHAPTER III POTTERY OF THE PERSIAN AND HELLENISTIC PERIODS A. LOCAL PERSIAN PERIOD POTTERY A few pottery vessels and sherds from the Persian period were found in the pits and topsoil layers attributed to Stratum I. However, there was not a single locus that provided a reasonably complete pottery assemblage. In the pottery plates we present a selection of forms found in pits and surface loci that can be related to this period, though some of these could also have originated in Stratum II of the late Iron Age (most of the forms in Pis. 76; 77; 78:1-9; 98:11-19; 105:1-8). The local pottery consists of forms well known during this period in the Shephelah and coastal plain. In the following, we refer mainly to a few major publications (Stern 1982; Dor ; Tel Michal ; Mevorakh ; Gezer III). An in-depth study of this material is not intended here. A few imported Attic sherds were studied by B. Johnson and one stamped Rhodian handle by D.T. Ariel. BOWLS Pis. 76:3-7; 98:12-13; 105:1 are mortaria. PL 105:1 is the only complete example of the typical Persian period mortarium, characterized by a high ring base. Two additional fragments (Pis. 76:7; 98:13) are also of high ring bases. The remaining fragments are of rims that cannot be distinguished from those of Stratum II. For discussion and parallels, see our BL 20 (above, p. 51); Mevorakh : 31, Fig. 4:13-14; Tel Michal: 117, Fig. 9.1:16-18 (Stratum X); 120, Fig. 9.2:1-2 (Stratum IX); Gezer III: 78-79, 235-236, PL 30. KRATERS PL 76:8-9 are either variations of Stratum II KR 8 or perhaps Persian period cooking pots or kraters. PL 77:5 is the rim of a krater (or holemouth jar?) with triangular "wedge" impressions. PL 77:1 is a body fragment of a krater with similar decoration; see Gezer III : PL 28B:29 (a holemouth jar with similar decoration; for a discussion of the wedge decoration, see Stern 1982: 133-136). PL 77:12-13 may be rims of large kraters that are known from Judah during this time (Stern 1982: 100, Fig. 125). PL 105:5 was found in a Persian period pit in Area C (Locus 513). It is a deep krater with two horizontal handles; the neck and rim are missing. The shape may have been inspired by Attic skyphoi (see Dor : 177, Fig. 4.4:3), though these are open vessels that lack an actual neck, while our vessel may have had a neck. COOKING POTS Pis. 76:11 and 105:2-3 are comparable to Gezer III: 79, 236-237, PL 31:12 (Type 154A). Cooking pots with high necks and two handles from rim to shoulder are common in this period, and perhaps developed from our 7th century CP 10. They have thin dark brown ware, a vertical neck and a some- what thickened rim. The mouth diameter is usually ca. 22 cm. PL 76:12 is similar, but with a narrower mouth and a triangular rim. Compare Stern 1982: 101, Fig. 132 (from Hazor); Tel Michal : 117, Fig. 9.1:3 (Stratum X). STORAGE JARS PL 55:9 is a sherd of an inverted long neck with an everted thickened rim top. The general profile is typical of Persian period storage jars (e.g. Taanach T. Fig. 85:1, a rim from a Persian period pit). A very similar profile from Ramat Rahel was found in the inner courtyard with late Iron Age II shapes, but appears to be intrusive and belong to the Persian period {Ramat Rahel IL Fig. 20:11). The area in which our sherd was found was gutted by Persian period pits and it is possible that it is intrusive from Stratum I, though its locus is attributed to Stratum II. PL 77:1 (Photo 108) is a complete tall, wide- 186</page><page sequence="195">bodied jar with four handles, found in a Stratum I pit in Area F (Locus F620). This is Stern's Storage Jar Type A (Stern 1982: 103-104, Fig. 139) known only from Judah (examples are presented from Tell en- Nasbeh, En-Gedi and Beth Zur). This type continues the tradition of the Iron Age four-handled jars of the LMLK and rosette types and is thus an indication for continuity in pottery traditions between this period and the Persian period. Photo 108. Persian period storage jar (PL 77:1). Scale 1:6. PI. 77:2 was found close to topsoil in Area D, near the thickening of the Iron Age II city wall (Wall 141). It is attributed to a period postdating the Iron Age II because of its orange chalky fabric (FG 19). This fabric, defined by Tufnell as "soft, powdery, orange," was common in vessels found at Lachish in the Residency and other Level I contexts ( Lachish III : 313). At Tel Batash, this fabric is rare in Iron Age contexts. The general shape of this jar is similar to that of our Iron Age S J 15b, which is common in the coastal plain. However, the fabric is different and the distortion of the handles is not found in the Iron Age II examples of SJ 15b (see Tufhell's observation on carelessly applied handles on "sausage" jars, Lachish III : 313; the handles on PL 77:2 recall this). It appears that here again we have evidence for con- tinuity in pottery types from the Iron Age to the Persian period. PL 77:7 from Locus F620 (the Stratum I pit in which the jar in PL 77:1 was found) is a rim of similar type and fabric. Jars of generally similar form appear throughout the coastal plain in the Persian period; see Stern's Type H8 (Stern 1982: 108, Fig. 151); Keisan : PL 18:1-7 (Stratum 3); Tel Michal : 121, Fig. 9.3:7-8 (Stratum IX); Gezer III : 229, PL 28:11-21 (Type 122B, though the rim is shorter than in our jar). PL 76:14 is the upper part of a storage jar with a short neck and thickened, inverted rim. Pis. 76:15-17; 77:3-6, 8-9 are various thickened everted rims of storage jars; such jar rims appear in many variations in the Persian period in Judah and the coastal plain {Gezer III: PL 29:1-14). PL 98:16 is the upper part of a jar with triangular rim and a ridge along the neck; similar rim profiles appear in cook- ing pots of the Persian period {Gezer III : PL 31:13). HOLEMOUTH JAR PL 98: 14 is the upper part of a holemouth jar or deep krater found in the topsoil layer in Area H. The body is oval, with two loop handles below the rim. The rim is grooved. The type is known from the Persian period, though it is not common; see Stern 1982: 103, Fig. 136 (examples are cited from Samaria, Tell en-Nasbeh and an unpublished example from Sheikh Ibrahim). Compare Keisan : PL 21:7, a vessel of similar general form but with a typical elongated inturned holemouth rim. JUGS PL 98:17 is a large jug from a Stratum I pit (Locus H907) in Area H. No exact parallels to this vessel were found. PL 69:4 was discussed among the Stratum II varia (above, p. 128), but appears to belong to the Persian period repertoire. FLASKS PL 77: 14 is a fragment of a flask found in a Stratum I context in Area E; probably part of a ridged-neck flask. PL 105:4 is the upper part of a red-slipped flask from Locus 513, a Stratum I pit in Area C. Ridged- neck flasks are found in the Persian period mainly in Judah and the southern coastal plain; see Stern 1982: 115, Fig. 166. 187</page><page sequence="196">JUGLETS AND BOTTLES Pis. 78:1-3; 98:13 are four rims of juglets or small bottles from topsoil and pit in Areas E and H. These appear to belong to various juglet forms of the Per- sian or Hellenistic period. PL 78:4 may belong to an Assyrian bottle like our PL 49:10 (BT 3). LAMPS PL 105:8, found in a topsoil layer in Area C, may be dated to either the late Persian or the Hellenistic period. It is an imitation of an Attic form, made in light-colored local clay. Parallels can be cited from both the late Persian period (Stern 1982: 129; Tel Michal : 131, Fig. 9.10:11-12 [Stratum VI]; 132, Fig, 9.2 3-10) and early Hellenistic levels ( Keisan : PL 14:1-2). SUMMARY The scattered pottery from the Persian period sur- veyed briefly above comprises for the most part forms that are typical mainly of Judah and the Shephelah, though some forms can be found throughout the entire country. The material is not sufficient for establishing a closer date in the Persian period, though an early phase of the period seems appropriate for most of the pottery discussed here. B. ATTIC POTTERY Barbara L. Johnson Four Attic ceramic fragments were found, all in Area E; three are from stemmed cups and the fourth is a lamp. STEMMED CUPS 1 . Reg. No. 9237 , Locus 942 , Stratum I (PL 78:8) 2. Reg. No. 9287, Locus 942 , Stratum I (PL 78:9) 3. Reg. No. 9044/1 , Locus 907, Stratum I (PL 78:6) PL 78:8, the foot and a small part of the floor of a cup, most closely resembles the Vicup type of kylix (Sparkes and Talcott 1970: 93), except for the addi- tional reserved area of the center floor with a dotted circle in black. This reserved area of floor is not noted as characteristic of the Vicup kylix, but does occur on the Type C kylix (Sparkes and Talcott 1970: 92). PL 78:9 preserves only part of the stem of the cup and probably belongs to a Vicup vessel with its reserved underside of the stem and its slipped interior floor. PL 78:6, a section of a handle and body, is apparently also from a Vicup kylix. All these cup specimens may be dated in the first quarter to the first half of the 5th century. LAMP Reg. No. 9191/4, Locus 913, Stratum I (Pl. 78:7) The worn and burned nozzle of a lamp, covered at least in part with a red slip (2.5YR 5/8). Little can be said about the nozzle other than that it was part of a wheelmade lamp (Howland 1958: 3, 50, possibly Type 2 ID, dated from the first quarter of the 5th century into the early years of the fourth quarter of the 5th century). Its date may be based only on its context at Tel Batash, namely the Persian period. C. HELLENISTIC POTTERY A few sherds from the topsoil, which may be iden- tified as belonging to the Hellenistic period, are slight evidence for some activity on the mound during this period. These include the Rhodian stamped amphora handle from Area C (see below) and the following sherds: PL 76:2 is possibly a fish plate (see Dor. 349, Fig. 6.3:1-14). PL 98:15 is a Hellenistic "casserole" from Area H (compare Lapp 1961: 189-190 (Type 72); Keisan : PL 11:6, 8, 9; Dor. 299-300, Fig. 6.20:7-13). Pl. 105:6-7 are two upper parts of jars (probably "bag-shaped") found in pits cut into the gate structure in Area C. They appear to be Hellenistic, though a date in the late Persian period may also be consid- ered. However, a 2nd century date for these jars would fit the date of the stamped Rhodian amphora handle from the same area, indicating some activity in this area during this century. Rim forms similar to Pl. 105:6 can be found in Hellenistic levels of the 2nd-lst centuries; see Lapp 1961: 146, Type 11c from Beth Zur and Shechem; Gezer III : PL 36:15-18 (though the rims there are less thick than ours). Our PL 77:10 could also be a rim of a similar jar. We did not find close parallels to the rim form of PL 105:7. A few other sherds, such as PL 78:1, may be Hellenistic (compare Lapp 1961: 162, Type 31:A from Samaria and Beth Zur, 2nd century). 188</page><page sequence="197">D. STAMPED RHODIAN AMPHORA HANDLE Donald T. Ariel Circular Stamp Reg. No. 5214 , topsoil, Area C (Fig. 14; Photo 109) ['E7t]í 'Iépcovoç (vac) rose The handle was found in the 1979 season in topsoil during the cleaning of the outer gate Wall 608 in Area C. Two eponyms of this name are known. From the handle's profile and the style of the stamp, this handle may be dated to the term of 'Iépcov 1st, which fell ca. 198 BCE (Grace 1985: 23, note 60; Nicolau and Empereur 1986: 516, No. 2; see also Brugnone 1986: 20-22, Nos. 27-32, and Ariel 1990: 51, S 189). However, Finkielsztejn has proposed a chronology that effectively revises Grace's dates for the period in which this eponym officiated (published only in summary form, Finkielsztejn 1995: 279-281). If the revised chronology is adopted, the change would entail lowering the date of the term of 'Iépcov 1st by approximately eleven years. The term of the eponym 'Iépcov 2nd is dated to ca. 120 BCE (Grace and Sawatianou-Pétropoulakou 1970: 305, E15; Ariel and Finkielsztejn 1994: 186). Fig. 14. Stamped Rhodian amphora handle, profile (scale 1:2). Photo 109. The stamp (scale 1:1). This lone stamped handle find from Tel Batash is, together with a few pottery fragments from Areas C, E and H (see above), evidence for some degree of activity at the site in the 2nd century BCE. 189</page><page sequence="198">CHAPTER IV INSCRIPTIONS AND SEAL IMPRESSIONS A. TWO HEBREW INSCRIPTIONS 1. Reg. No. D81 53/01, Locus D820, Area D, Stratum IV (PI. 6:3; Photo 110) Photo 110. [ ]n hnn inscription (PL 6:3). Scale 1:1. The inscription was incised on a bowl rim before firing. It reads: [ ]n hnn ] It may be reconstructed: [lb]n hnn , (belonging) [to the so]n of Hanan. A vertical divider separates the first nun from the name hnn. This inscription was published in our preliminary report (Keim and Mazar 1990: 56) and discussed by Renz (1995: 30). The shapes of the nun and het fit a 10th century date, as they are similar to those on the Gezer Calendar (see the paléographie chart in Renz 1995: Taf. 1). This is one of a very small group of securely dated 10th century alphabetic inscriptions from Israel, to which we can attribute only four others: the "agricultural calendar" from Gezer, a short inscrip- tion on a "Hippo" type jar from Tel 'Amai, a short inscription on a sherd from H. Rosh Zayit (for all the latter see Renz 1995: 30-38, Taf. 1) and an inscrip- tion on a fragment of a pottery gaming board from Beth Shemesh (Bunimovitz and Lederman 1997: 29- 30), also mentioning the name hnn. The latter is of special significance, since we have here a second reference to the name Hanan in the Sorek Valley in a 10th century context. The name Hanan appears as a component in the place name Elon-beth-hanan in Solomon's Second District, which also includes the towns Makaz, Shaalbim and Beth-shemesh (1 Kings 4:9). Makaz could be a town in the region and may perhaps be identified with one of the prominent sites in the vicinity of the valley of Ajalon, such as Khirbet Abu Murrah (Horvat Avimor), a prominent mound on a ridge between the valleys of Ajalon and Sorek containing 10th century pottery.1 Na'aman (1986a: 114-115) has suggested that the name MQS was originally not a place name but the word mqs, meaning "from the end of," an expression that appears in several biblical border descriptions. He also suggested, following the LXX, that the compo- site name Elon-beth-hanan should be divided into two different names: Elon (which he equates with Ajalon) and Beth-hanan. Thus in his view, this list included four names, which mark the borders of the district: Ajalon, Beth-shemesh, Shaalbim and Beth-hanan. According to this interpretation, Beth-Hanan would be on the western border of the district, a location that may fit the region of Tel Batash. However, Elon is mentioned separately from Ajalon in the city list of Dan (Josh. 19:42^3); there is thus no reason to conflate the two (as suggested by Na'aman), and they should be considered as two different towns. Elon, which appears before Timnah and Ekron in Josh. 19:43, can be identified with Elon-beth-hanan in 1 Kings 4:9. The name Hanan in our inscription might thus be related to a family of that name who dwelt in the region of Elon and Timnah during the 10th cen- tury. Elon-beth-hanan might be one of the Iron Age sites discovered in the survey of the Sorek Valley between Beth-shemesh and Timnah, such as the site at Khirbet Hasan (map reference 1463.1344) or Tel Selafon (map reference 1443.1342) ( Timnah I: 2, map Fig. 1). Remarkable evidence for the relationship of the Hanan family with this region is the appearance of the name on the 10th century gaming board men- tioned above, as well as on a "Proto-Canaanite" ink 190</page><page sequence="199">inscription from Beth Shemesh, which should prob- ably be dated to the 12th century (Cross 1967: 17*- 19*). In the view of Bunimovitz and Lederman (1997: 29-30), these inscriptions support our inter- pretation of the inscription from Tel Batash (see Renz 1995: 67 for a list of occurrences of the name Hanan in Hebrew inscriptions). 2.

Inscription incised before firing on a bottle of "Assyrian" form (BT 1). lm'[] l tytí? (Belonging) to Ma'[ ] The end of a letter that may be bet , kaj, ' mem , nun or pe can be seen to the left of the break after the 'ayin. This must be the last letter in the name; thus, the name did not include more than three letters. This was probably an ownership inscription, mentioning the name of the owner after the letter lamed ("belonging to") (for a discussion, see Renz 1995: 242). The name can be reconstructed in several ways, such as m ' kh , mm, m 7z, etc. (see Renz 1995: 242, note 1). Two very short incisions after the name may have been purposely made, and may have been part of a number. Paleographically, the letters lamed and (ayin are typical of the éntire 8th-7th centuries. The mem is of a peculiar form, with very few parallels (for a similar mem at Horvat 'Uza see Renz 1995: Taf. 34, the left- hand mem; see also ibid.: 242). Renz (ibid.) ascribed the inscription to the first part of the 7th century on the basis of the form of the letters. However, this dating has no actual basis, and in our view the inscription could have been incised at any time during the 7th century. B. LMLK AND "PRIVATE" SEAL IMPRESSIONS Twelve LMLK seal impressions (including identical impressions on each of the four handles of the jar shown in PL 18:3) and one "private" seal impression were found on jar handles from Building 737 of Stratum III in Area D. Three additional LMLK impressions and one handle with incised concentric circles were found in different Stratum II contexts. In the following discussion we have attempted to attribute each of the LMLK seal impressions to one of Welten's (1969) or Lemaire's (1981) types, though this was not always possible when the seal impres- sion was very worn or broken. The INAA No. is the laboratory number of the Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (Mommsen et al. 1984). Photo- graphs appear at a scale of 1:1.

LMLK seal impression (PL 18:1). A restored jar stamped on the upper part of one handle. Two other handles are plain, and the fourth handle is missing. The seal impression is of the four- winged type. Its upper part is missing. The lower part is very poorly preserved; the word LMLK cannot be read, as the impression was hastily made and its upper part is poorly impressed. At the bottom, only faint remains of letters are preserved. The handle was stamped twice; the remains of the first stamping can be seen at the bottom, below the first. Thus the same letters can be seen twice, one slightly higher than the other. However, the letters do not resemble any of the common city names on the LMLK seal impressions, 191</page><page sequence="200">and the reading is enigmatic. The scarab is of the naturalistic form and appears to belong to Lemaire's Type I (Lemaire 1981). 2. Reg. No. 7358, Locus 737, Building 737, INAA No. 1872 (PI. 18:2; Photo 113) Photo 113. LMLK seal impression (PL 18:2). The upper part of a restored jar; three handles are preserved, of which one is impressed. The fourth handle is missing. The seal impression was very roughly executed and it appears that chiseling was carried out later on the impression, so that only indistinct remains are preserved. It is of the four- winged type. Remains of the letters LML[K] are preserved in the upper part and the name ZYP (the city name Ziph) in the lower part. This is Lemaire's Type Zla and Welten's Type ZIA (Welten 1969). 3. Reg.

This is a unique case in which all four handles were stamped by a sealed handle used as a seal; thus, a negative impression was obtained. As far as we know, this is the only example of such a phenomenon on LMLK jars. The stamping was done on the narrow edge of each handle, in such a way that only one long side of the impression was stamped. It appears to be a four-winged seal impression. Only one letter, mem , is preserved, probably part of MMŠT. 4. Reg. No. 7359, Locus 737, Building 737 (PL 19:1; Photo 115) Photo 115. LMLK seal impression (PL 19:1). A two-winged seal impression on a handle. The symbol is executed with great care: a disc can be seen in its center, ending in three short vertical lines below. Similar discs and vertical ridges appear in Welten's Types ZIIA1, SIIA2, MIIA1 and MIIA3, as well as Lemaire's Types Zlib, Slib, Mila and Mllb. The word LMLK can clearly be seen above the symbol, while of the city name only the upper parts of the last two letters are preserved. These appear to be the upper parts of the letters yod and pe of the name ZYP ' though this is not certain. The rest of the name is missing due to careless stamping. 5. Reg.

The name ZYP in the lower part is well preserved. This name appears on the LMLK seal impressions with or without the letter yod. In our case, the yod is clearly seen below the center of the two-winged symbol. This impression can perhaps be identified as Welten's Type ZIIB2 (Lemaire's Zila). 6. Reg.

The brown clay includes an unusually large amount of white grits, many more than in most of the LMLK jars. The word LMLK is almost totally lacking due to careless stamping. The city name MMŠT in the lower part is well preserved. The two-winged symbol is schematic. The symbol and the upper part of the impression are smoothed. This is Welten's Type MIIB or Mil Al (though the latter has vertical ridges on the lower part of the two-winged symbol, see No. 4). In both these types the letter shin is located below the central part of the two-winged symbol. 7. Reg. No. 7125, Locus 744, Building 737, INAA No. 188 (PL 19:4; Photo 118) Photo 118.

The letters LM can be seen above the right side of the two-winged symbol. No remains of the city name are preserved because of the break below the two-winged symbol. The type cannot be deter- mined. 8. Reg. No. 7115, Locus 731, INAA No. 184 (PL 19:5 ; Photo 119) Photo 119. LMLK seal impression (PL 19:5). A four-winged seal impression, very worn. The clay is dark reddish-yellow and includes many small black grits. This impression was probably distorted by double stamping or the shifting of the seal from right to left during stamping. The word LMLK at the top lacks the first letter {lamed), perhaps due to this distortion. The four-winged scarab appears to be of the naturalistic type; its head has three triangular elements protruding upwards, a feature unknown in Welten's examples. The lower part of the seal was not impressed because of the curvature of the handle, which was not taken into consideration when the impression was made. In this case, it is obvious that care was not taken that the city name be legible, another indication of carelessness in stamping the jars and the haste of their mass production. 9. Reg.

A "private" seal impression: Ispn 'bm 's (Belonging) to Sapan (son of) 'Abima'as The oval seal is 1 .25 cm long, with two parallel lines separating the upper and lower registers. A small depression on the right side may have been caused by part of the ring to which the seal was attached. The impression is very deep, making it difficult to photograph. The handle on which the seal was impressed is identical in form to the other LMLK jars in Building 737; the fabric is similar to that of Pis. 19:5-6. It is obvious that the handle belonged to one of these jars. Four identical seal impressions are known: one from the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem, one from Tel 'Azekah and two on the same jar from Tel Safit (Tell es-Safi) (Avigad and Sass 1997: 256, No. 695). The name Sapan also appears on other seals and seal impressions (for a list, see ibid.: 528). About nine seal impressions from Lachish and Gibeon bear the name Sapan 'Azaryahu (ibid.: 256- 257, Nos. 696-699), and about six impressions of Hoshea' (son of) Sapan are known (ibid.: 245, No. 667). All these are probably seal impressions of officials on LMLÀjars. The name appears on several seals, e.g. alone, as Sapan (son of) Ahimelek and as Sapan (son of) Neriyahu; it also appears on a jug from Jerusalem (Prignaud 1978: 136). The "private" seal impressions that appear together with LMLK seal impressions probably record the names of officials responsible for the production of the jars, or refer to the administration related to their production and distribution at the time of Hezekiah's preparations for the war against Assyria (Garfinkel 1985).

Handle with concentric circles (PI. 59:15). A broken handle with incised concentric circles. A deep central dot is surrounded by a complete circle and a second, outer circle only partly incised. The incisions were made after firing. The feature of incised circles on LMLK jar handles is well known (see Nadelman in Jerusalem, Ophel : 131-132). In some cases the incisions cover part of a LMLK seal impression, and Aharoni suggested that the incisions "canceled" the royal seal impression (Y. Aharoni 1979: 421, note 49). Table 38 (p. 196) summarizes the LMLK and "private" seal impressions and the incised concentric circles found at Tel Batash. DISCUSSION The royal seal impressions found at Tel Batash accord with those found at Lachish in several aspects and contradict them in others. In general, the finds in our Stratum III correlate with finds at Lachish Level III (Ussishkin 1976, 1977, 1978). Of particular importance is the fact that at both sites, almost complete storage units were excavated, containing almost exclusively jars of this type. At both sites, the storerooms were destroyed in a conflagration. At both sites, Stratum III was found sealed by Stratum II, a 7th century city that was violently destroyed by the Babylonian invasions between 605 and 587 BCE. Below Stratum III at both sites were occupation levels of the 10th or 9th centuries. It thus became obvious that Stratum III at both sites should be dated to the time of the invasion of Sennacherib in 701 BCE. Indeed, both Lachish and Timnah are men- tioned in Assyrian sources of the time of Sennacherib as being captured by him. An additional common feature of Lachish Level III and Tel Batash Stratum III is the discovery of both two-winged and four- winged seal impressions in the same context, together with "private" seal impressions; the latter were found at Lachish and other sites stamped on the same jars as LMLK impressions and are in fact related to the LMLK jars. The uncovering of the entire contents of the storerooms at Lachish and Tel Batash also provides an important quantitative aspect: the two complete assemblages each contained about thirty jars. Only a few of these were stamped. At Lachish three or four out of 18 jars in Locus 4014 were stamped (Zimhoni 1990: 18). In Building 737 at Timnah, only 13 handles (including the single handle with a "private" seal impression) were stamped out of an estimated 132 handles (four on each of the 33 estimated jars in Building 737). Some jars were stamped on all four handles (like our PI. 18:3), while many jars were not stamped at all (like the jars in Pis. 16-17). Only about 10% of handles were stamped. The unique jar in PI. 18:3, on which all four handles were stamped by a stamped handle, as well as the carelessness of the use of the seal in many of the impressions, indicate that numerous impressions were made hastily, and many were partly illegible after production. This may have implications for the understanding of the function of the jars and the seal impressions. Another significant aspect of these jars at Lachish 195</page><page sequence="204">Table 38.

Taking into account the fact that the stamped handles signify many more jars lacking seal impressions, one must conclude that Lachish Level III must have had thousands of jars of this type. The discoveries at Lachish, and subsequently those at Timnah, led to the discarding of the pre- viously accepted dating of the LMLK jars to the 7th century in favor of a more precise date in the time of Hezekiah, as already claimed by Aharoni for the four- winged impressions (Y. Aharoni 1963: 320- 323). An interpretation of the jars as being prepared by Hezekiah in royal pottery workshops as part of his preparations for the war against Assyria was sug- gested by Na'aman (1979; 1986a; compare Mazar 1984: 47). This interpretation was supported by the Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis, which showed that all the 27 jar samples analyzed were made of the same clay. It was suggested that all the jars were made in the same workshop, probably somewhere in the Shephelah. If the above interpretation is correct, this large number of jars attests to the outstanding capability of Hezekiah's administration. The ratio between stam- ped and unstamped jars, all made with the same technique and same clay, shows that the jars were indeed mass produced; only a few jars in each pro- duction series were stamped, while most were not stamped. 196</page><page sequence="205">These observations may shed light on the nature of the production system of these jars, though it must be admitted that many questions still remain unsolved. The main issue is the intent and sig- nificance of these seal impressions. The finds at Tel Batash differ from those at Lachish concerning the 7th century: while at Lachish no LMLK jars were found (though see our note 25, p. 184), at Tel Batash we have several complete jars from secure Stratum II contexts (see pp. 95-96). None of the restored jars from this stratum was stamped, but this may be a coincidence since, as we have seen, many of the jars in Stratum III were also unstamped. The three LMLK seal impressions on broken handles found in Stratum II, as well as the complete jars of LMLK type found in the buildings of Stratum II, may be explained in several ways: 1. The three stamped handles from Stratum II contexts are stray finds and in fact originate in Stratum III. However, this explanation ignores the fact that restorable LMLK jars were found in Stratum II contexts. 2. Such jars, both stamped and unstamped, con- tinued to be produced throughout the 7th century. This seems doubtful in view of the homogeneity of the clay and production technique, and in light of the stratigraphie finds at Lachish. It appears likely that all the LMLK jars were produced during a relatively short period preceding Sennacherib's invasion in 701 BCE. 3. The jars found in Stratum II were produced together with the other LMLK jars during the late 8th century and continued in use at Tel Batash through- out the 7th century. This possibility seems feasible since the jars were probably used for storage of products in royal storehouses, where careful handling could have assured their continuous use over a long period. It is possible that at Timnah such a royal storehouse escaped destruction during Sennacherib's invasion and remained in use during the following century. 4. A fourth possibility is a variant of the previous one: that such jars arrived at Tel Batash during the 7th century from other locations, where they had been preserved after Hezekiah's reign. The prime candidate for such a place is Jerusalem, which sur- vived the Assyrian invasion of 701 BCE and where thousands of such jars were probably housed in royal storage centers. During the 7th century such jars certainly continued in use and were distributed to various other sites (see above, pp. 95-96). C. ROSETTE STAMP SEAL IMPRESSIONS Jane M. Cahill INTRODUCTION Six ceramic jar handles bearing rosette stamp seal impressions have been found at Tel Batash in loci ascribed to Stratum II, which was destroyed at the end of the 7th century (Table 39).* These six handles and their impressions are described individually in the typological discussion that follows. The description of each handle includes the following data: area of discovery; registration number; locus number and description; Munsell soil color chart descriptions for fabric and core; and relative size, frequency and type of inclusions. The description of each impression includes measurements in centi- meters for the following features: RD: rosette diameter PL: petal length PW: petal width CD: diameter of central dot SD: stamp diameter Identical impressions and possibly identical jars are indicated. Drawings and photographs of the impres- sions appear at the scale of 1 : 1 . TYPOLOGY Although the rosette motifs stamped on handles are very basic, consisting simply of a varying number of petals evenly spaced around a central dot, variant stylistic features are readily visible on most impres- sions. These features allow the rosette impressions to be categorized into five stylistic classes, each of which has been subdivided into various types and subtypes (Cahill 1995: 231-239). The six rosette- stamped handles from Tel Batash all bear Class I * The present study would not have been possible without the help and cooperation of many others, to all of whom the author expresses her gratitude. S. Eisenstein made the line drawings of the impressions and the handles on which they appear. M. Fleitman helped to locate the rosette-stamped handles and discussed their stratigraphie settings in the initial stages of this study. O. Mazar discussed the possible number of jars represented. A. Mazar and N. Panitz-Cohen read the manu- script, made many valuable comments, and facilitated its inclusion in this volume. 197</page><page sequence="206">(Fancy Style) impressions composed of circum- scribed rosettes stamped in low relief, whose petals are individually fashioned of two parts: an inner core forming the body of the petal and an outer frame that encloses the inner core. The frames surrounding the inner parts of the petals are the most characteristic feature of Class I impressions and four types (A-D) of rosette motif have been distinguished on this basis (Cahill 1995: 231-234). The handles from Tel Batash all bear Class I, Type A impressions characterized by petals with a shared outline, both of which are con- nected to the motifs central dot. Although Class I, Type A impressions exhibit five subtypes defined by the number of petals used to form the motif, the handles from Tel Batash all bear rosettes consisting of eight petals and are, therefore, classified as I.A. 8 impressions. 1 .

STRATIGRAPHY All six rosette-stamped handles from Tel Batash come from well-stratified contexts ascribed to Stra- tum II, which is thought to have been destroyed by the Babylonians in ca. 605-603 BCE. No. 1 was recovered from Locus 730 in Area D, identified as the uppermost street level that ran along the inner face of the city wall (Wall 141) in Square H-30 ( Timnah 1 : 200). Although no floor surface was clearly defined, this locus yielded a rich assemblage of indicative pottery (see Pis. 60-62). No. 2 was recovered from Locus C803 in Area C, identified as fallen stones and debris from the outer bastion Wall C800 ( Timnah 1 : 117), which collapsed on a floor in Square S-41. No. 3 was recovered from Locus 914 in Area E, identified as debris on a floor in Unit 914 (Timnah 1 : 220-222). Nos. 4-6 were discovered together with a rich assemblage of indicative pottery in Locus F632 of Area F in Building F608 ( Timnah I: 240-242); this locus is destruction debris on a floor in Square L-20 (see Pis. 64-70). SEALS Rosette impressions appearing on ceramic handles were stamped with seals applied to the clay while it was wet and plastic, before the vessel was fired in a kiln. To date, none of the seals used to stamp the rosette impressions has been found (Cahill 1995: 240, n. 4). Although all six handles from Tel Batash bear I.A. 8 impressions, they do not appear to have been stamped with the same seal, for the measure- ments of the rosettes' individual features differ slightly from handle to handle. Comparison of the detailed measurements indicates that the six impres- sions were stamped with three different seals (Table 40): one for No. 1, one for Nos. 2-3 and one for Nos. 4-6. VESSEL TYPES All six of the rosette impressions from Tel Batash appear on the upper portions of double-ridged han- dles belonging to large, ovoid storage jars. Although the fabric of these handles varies slightly in color in accordance with the atmospheric conditions in which the handles were fired, three of them, Nos. 1-3, resemble those bearing LMLK impressions. Like the LMLAT-impressed handles, they exhibit the following tricolor scheme: a gray core, an interior zone sur- rounding the core that varies from light red to pinkish gray, and an exterior zone that varies from brownish gray to reddish brown. The remaining three impres- sions, Nos. 4-6, exhibit only two color features: a gray core and a weak red external layer of varying depth. Various quantities of small, medium and large white and/or black inclusions are present in each handle, and four handles (Nos. 1, 3 and 5-6) have small holes indicating the use of some sort of organic temper, possibly straw (Table 41). All six rosette-impressed handles derive from the same type of storage jar (our SJ 9; see above, pp. 96- 97), which the excavators of Lachish dubbed Type 483 (Lachish III : PI. 95) and SJ 190 (Lachish V: 18, PI. 54) but which is now commonly referred to as the "rosette jar" (Zimhoni 1997: 241-243; Cahill 1995: 241-243). This rosette jar is a taller, narrower derivative of the LMLK jar (our S J 8; Type 484 in Lachish 111: PI. 95; and S J 180 in Lachish V: PL 54) which, like the LMLK ] ar, has an upright neck, a plain rim, rounded shoulders, four loop handles placed close to the center of the vessel's body, a tapered body and a round or slightly pointed base. Rosette jars differ from the LMLK jars mainly in their size and, apparently, the number of ware types from which they were made.5 The six individual handles from Tel Batash appear to have come from four, or possibly five, individual 199</page><page sequence="208">jars. The conclusion that No. 1 was stamped with a different seal from its counterparts suggests that it derives from a different jar as well. Although Nos. 2- 3 were recovered from separate areas of excavation, they appear to have been stamped with the same seal and could, therefore, have come from the same jar. Nos. 4-6, which were recovered from the same locus and were even gathered in the same pottery basket, appear to derive from two individual jars, each of which was only partially restorable.6 If Nos. 2-3 are assumed to derive from the same vessel, then four rosette-stamped jars are represented in the Tel Batash assemblage; if they derive from two individual ves- sels, then five rosette-stamped jars are represented. DISTRIBUTION The distribution of rosette-stamped storage jars is confined to the vicinity of ancient Judah (Cahill 1995: 244-245). I.A.8 impressions like those from Tel Batash appear on at least 31 additional handles deriving from at least twelve additional sites: Arad (2); Tel Azekah (2); Bet-Zur (1); Er-Ras (1); Tell el- Ful (1); Tel 'Erani (1); Gibeon (1); Jerusalem (13); Ramat Rahel (4); Tell en-Nasbeh (1); Tell es-Safi (1) and an unnamed farmstead in the Shephelah des- ignated Site 15-12/02/5 (l).7 Finally, the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) holds two I.A.8 impressions of unknown provenance.8 PROVENANCE No. 1 from Tel Batash was included in the corpus of "material connected with the royal jars" that Mommsen et al. (1984) subjected to Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis together with 120 samples from the LMLK- impressed jars. Mommsen and his colleagues concluded that No. 1 from Tel Batash, together with another rosette-stamped handle from the City of David in Jerusalem, as well as all but two of the LMLK vessels tested, "showed a degree of homogeneity of composition which is normally associated with pottery made at a single place" (ibid.: 112). Although the LMLK study failed to identify the site at which these vessels were pro- duced, its authors concluded that it should be located somewhere in the Judean Shephelah (ibid.: 112). This conclusion appears to be corroborated by the recent analysis of 89 rosette-stamped handles, including Nos. 2-3 and Nos. 5-6 from Tel Batash (Cahill and Yellin in preparation). HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE The rosette motif enjoyed a long history in the realm of ancient Near Eastern art, where it became a pop- ular manifestation of divine kingship (Cahill 1995: 250-252; 1997). The royal significance of the rosette motif suggests that the vessels on which they appear were manufactured under royal sponsorship and intended for official use. The stratigraphie analysis of the entire corpus of rosette impressions leads to the conclusion that they were produced and circulated solely during the final phase of the Iron Age II (Cahill 1995: 244-250). The discovery of a single type of rosette impression (I.A.8) at the apparently non-Judahite site of Tel Batash suggests that the I.A.8 impressions were stamped and distributed prior to the other types of rosette impressions and that the destruction of Stratum II at Tel Batash occurred before the destruction of those sites at which a variety of impression types have been found (Cahill 1995: 247-250). When viewed in light of the his- torical events that transpired during the final phase of the Iron Age, the stratigraphie and typological evi- dence from Tel Batash suggests that the rosette impressions were introduced during the reign of Jehoiakim, possibly in response to the threat of Babylonian invasion that followed Egypt's defeat at the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BCE. If so, then the first rosette-stamped vessels are likely to have appeared in 605/604 BCE and their occurrence at Tel Batash may best be understood as evidence of Judah's support for her neighbor's war efforts rather than as evidence of political domination. SUMMARY Six ceramic jar handles bearing rosette stamp seal impressions have been found at Tel Batash in loci ascribable to Stratum II. These six rosette-stamped handles all bear the same type of Class I (Fancy Style) rosette impression formed by eight petals sharing a common frame (I.A.8). Nevertheless, comparison of the measurements suggests that these six impressions were stamped with three different seals. Each of the rosette impressions from Tel Batash appears on the upper portion of a double- ridged handle that derives from a type of ovoid storage jar identified as a taller, narrower derivative of the LMLK jar now commonly known as the "rosette jar." The six handles appear to have origi- nated from four, or possibly five, individual jars. 200</page><page sequence="209">Table 39. Catalogue of rosette-stamped handles. Corpus No. Area Reg.

Mazar, who identified typical 10th century pottery there. 2 In Mommsen et al. 1984: 95, No. 187 is mentioned as having Reg. No. 7143, which is another number on the jar that here appears as Reg. No. 7358. The phrase "double impression" in the above-mentioned description is not clear. 3 The Reg. No. 7093 that appears as the number of this sample in Mommsen et al. 1984 was given to another part of the same restored jar. The final number of the jar is 7094. 4 Mommsen et al. 1984: 100, Table 2. 5 Zimhoni describes three ware types for rosette jars ( 1 997 : 241) and only one ware type for the LMLK jars (ibid.: 225). 6 The opinion that these handles derive from two different storage jars is that of O. Mazar, who restored the ceramic material from Tel Batash. 7 One of the two handles from Arad is held by the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), No. 64-319; the other is being prepared for publication by M. Aharoni, Reg. No. 10018. The two handles from Tel Azekah appear in Bliss and Macalister 1902: PL 56:36z, 38z. The single handle from Beth-Zur appears in Sellers 1933: Fig. 44:4 and is held by the IAA, No. 3 1-28. The handle from Er-Ras was discovered during excavations directed by G. Edelstein, Reg. No. 297/5 (Cahill in press a). The handle from Tell el-Ful appears in Lapp 1981: Pis. 28:5; 29:4. The handle from Tell en-Nasbeh appears in Zorn 1994: 81, Fig. 1. The handle from Tel 'Erani was discovered during excavations directed by S. Yeivin and is being prepared for publication by B. Brandl. The handle from Gibeon appears in Pritchard 1961: Fig. 46:77. One of the 13 handles from Jerusalem comes from B. Mazar' s excavations south of the Temple Mount and is published by Nadelman 1989: 132, 134, 140, No. 171. Two handles were found in the Armenian Garden: one during excavations directed by K.M. Kenyon {Jerusalem /: 23, 361, Fig. 9:40) now held by the IAA, No. 68-1214; and one during excavations directed by M. Broshi in the Armenian Garden, Reg. No. 1048/1. One handle was discovered in Area T2 of the Jewish Quarter excavations directed by N. Avigad, Reg. No. 1863 (Cahill in press b). One was found during salvage excavations conducted by A. Maier in the Mamilla neighborhood, Reg. No. 4006. Eight were found in the City of David excavations directed by Y. Shiloh, Reg. Nos. G 4314, D2/20923, E3/ 15723, G 4508, El/3272, G 4789, G 4777 and G 2129 (Cahill 2000). One of the four impressions from Ramat Rahel was published in Ramat Rahel II : PI. 41:9. This impression, as well as another I.A. 8 impression from Ramat Rahel are part of the study collection of the Hebrew University's Institute of Archaeology curated by G. Horwitz, Nos. 8542/9 and 7428. Two other I.A. 8 impressions from Ramat Rahel are held by the IAA, Nos. 54-362 and 64-1739. The impression from Tell es-Safi was discovered during excavations directed by A. Maeir and A. Boas. The impression from the farmstead in the Shephelah was discovered during a survey conducted by Y. Dagan. The author thanks all these excavators and curators who have allowed this material to be mentioned here. 8 The two impressions from unknown provenances held by the IAA bear Nos. 547 and 45.259. 202</page><page sequence="211">CHAPTER V FIGURATIVE CLAY OBJECTS A. THREE FIGURINE MOLDS The three figurine molds described below were dis- covered close to one another in Square K-26 in Area E, with a vertical dispersion of ca. 20 cm. Two (Nos. 1, 3) were found in Locus E624, a pebble floor that appears to have been a street or alley, but may have been part of an architectural unit of undetermined plan (see Timnah 1 : 196-197). This floor was laid on top of a constructional fill containing mixed Strata IV- III material and was sealed by Stratum II ele- ments belonging to Unit 914. The third mold (No. 2) was found at the very top of Locus E705, which is the constructional fill below Floor E624; thus, No. 2 was most likely originally associated with Floor E624 but was down-trampled through post-deposi- tional activity. The date is securely anchored in the 8th century (sealed by Stratum II floors and walls and just above a Strata IV-III constructional fill). The molds were formed by pressing lumps of clay onto "master" original figurines that were most likely made in the round, perhaps of ivory, wood or other material that enabled delicate molding of the details. The fingerprints of the potter have been preserved on the body of the molds (for a detailed discussion of the "press-mold" technique of production see TBM Photo 132. Figurine molds and casts. Scale 1:2. 203</page><page sequence="212">III : 102, 138-141). The molds, however, did not succeed in reproducing all the details from the "master," as can be judged from close observation of modern casts made from these molds, which serve as the basis for the following descriptions. Pressing the lumps of clay onto the "master" resulted in the reproduction of only the front and part of the sides of the original figurine, while much of the sides and all of the back could not be reproduced; the back was probably simply rounded or trimmed by the potter's hands. This is especially evident in mold No. 3, where parts of the side of the coiffure were distorted during the preparation of the mold (for color photos of the molds and modern casts see Keim and Mazar 1995: Fig. C31-33). 1. Reg. No. E8031, Locus E 62 4, Area E, Stratum III (PI. 30:1; Photo 133) A clay mold (height: 15 cm) of a nude female standing en face with the hands pressed to the sides. The feet and lower part of the legs appear to be missing, though the mold is not broken at its lower end. There are two possible explanations of this feature: 1. The "master" figurine from which the mold was made did have the lower part of the legs, but when the mold was prepared the lower legs were Photo 133. Cast from figurine mold No. 1 (PI. 30:1). Scale 1:1. 204</page><page sequence="213">omitted, perhaps due to neglect or technical inability; 2. The legs were disproportionate on the "master" figurine. The left leg appears to have a tiny vestigial foot, perhaps added after the mold was pressed on the "master" figurine. The head is large in proportion to the slender body. The oval face has accentuated features, though both lips and nose appear to have been distorted during the preparation of the mold by smearing of the mold's wet clay on the more delicate features of the "master" original. The thick lips are pursed in a hint of a smile. The nose is long and flat and appears to be incomplete due to the distortion mentioned above. The cheeks are puffy. The eyes are particularly large, almond-shaped, slanting downwards at the outer corner, bordered by a double line and topped by prominent eyebrows; the eyes lack pupils. The ears protrude and it is not certain whether they have earrings. The coiffure (or wig) descends to the forehead in rows of stylized curls. Two curls or braids extend from behind the ears to below the shoulders. The genitals are emphasized and there is a faint horizontal line above the vulva; the navel is a slight depression in mid-stomach. The knees and thighs are slightly contoured in comparison to the almost flat body. The right hand is well executed, with its palm flattened against the thigh. The left hand is carelessly made and is longer than the right one. A double bracelet adorns each wrist and a simple necklace surrounds the neck. 2. Reg. No. E7051, Locus E705, Area E, Stratum III (PI. 30:2; Photo 134) A clay mold, 11.6 cm high, which produced a fig- urine of a nude female supporting her breasts with her hands, standing on a small square pedestal. This "pedestal" probably served in the "master" original as a square plug that could be inserted into an appropriate socket to support the figurine. During the preparation of the mold some details of the face, mainly the nose and lips, were distorted. The delicate details of this figure's facial features are clearly evident. The large eyes and coiffure are similar to those of mold No. 1, as are the large nose and pursed lips. The breasts are pendulous and hanging, and the belly is round and somewhat protruding, perhaps indicating pregnancy. The genitals are marked by a slight depression. The legs are short in relation to the rest of the body; the thighs are accentuated and two bumps indicate the knees. The upper arms are vaguely depicted, while the forearms are asym- Photo 134. Cast from figurine mold No. 2 (PL 30:2). Scale 1:1. metrical: the left is slightly longer than the right. The fingers of each hand are individually defined and the left wrist possibly has a bracelet. 3. Reg. No. E7020, Locus E624, Area E, Stratum III (Pl. 30:3; Photo 135) A fragment of a clay mold, with only the head and neck preserved, of a female figure. The preserved part is 4 cm high. It is not clear whether this was originally only a head mold, meant to produce a head to be joined to a separately made body (compare a mold from Megiddo, May 1935: Pl. XXIII, M4117) or whether the mold was originally full-figure and only the head has been preserved. The figurine pro- duced from this mold exhibits the finest workman- ship of the three. It portrays a beautiful female face, with a necklace and coiffure resembling Phoenician depictions of women. Its detailed workmanship suggests an ivory original of a fully sculptured or high-relief figure. Although the original was sculp- 205</page><page sequence="214">Photo 135. Casts from figurine mold No. 3 (Pl. 30:3). Scale 1:1. tured in the round, in preparing the mold the artisan found it impossible to capture more than the frontal features (including the front and side of the coiffure). This assumption is reinforced by close examination of the coiffure, which is very similar to that of female head ivories carved in the round (Barnett 1975: 210). However, the coiffure of the figurine head made in this mold is "flat," due to the limitations of the mold. The hair is composed of wavy rather than curly locks, framing the face from a central part and con- tinuing at least down to the shoulders. On both sides, behind the bottom of the coiffure, are what look like additional curls or braids, suggesting an even more intricate hair design. The face is wide, with rounded puffy cheeks; there is a small round protrusion on the chin. The lips are arched in a delicate smile. The nose is flat and wide with well-defined nostrils. The eyes are strongly emphasized by a double line and each eyeball has a pupil; the impression is that the upper eyelids are slightly closed. The eyebrows are fine arched lines, though they are asymmetrical. The woman wears a necklace in which each bead is well defined. In terms of physiognomy, our figurine head recalls some of the female heads in the Phoenician ivories, where such heads are well known (Barnett 1975: 210 and others, e.g. Curtis and Reade 1995: 151, No. 122), though most of them have different proportions and details. Our head shares some features with the best known of these, the so-called "Mona Lisa" from Nimrud (Mallowan 1978: Fig. 61), a work that, though of greatly superior quality, may have inspired the "master" original of our piece. DISCUSSION The two full-figure molds represent the Iron Age continuation of manufacture of the well-known Bronze Age tradition of female fertility plaque fig- urines. Despite their ubiquitous presence in Bronze Age levels, only a handful of molds for such plaques have been found dating to this period (e.g. Lachish IV: Pis. 47:6; 48:1; 49:2; the latter was found in the Late Bronze Age potter's workshop, indicating clearly that such objects were produced at the site, ibid.: 90); Beth Shean Stratum VIII (James and McGovern 1993: Fig. 77:5; PL 37:d-e); Deir el- Balah (Dothan 1982a: 760-761). During the Iron Age plaque figurines become relatively rare and molds are even rarer (Holland 1975: 313-317, Types N.I.a, N.II.a-b; Kletter 1996: 50-51). Among the few full-figure molds preserved from the Iron Age are a complete mold from a cultic context at Taanach dated to the 10th century (Lapp 1964: 39, Fig 21), stylistically very different from ours (though note the schematic short legs, similar to the proportions of our No. 1) and a body with the head missing from Megiddo (Watzinger 1929: Abb. 158:b), stylistically different as well, though the hands clasp the breasts like our No. 2. A mold from Samaria constitutes the legs and lower body of what appears to be a figure carrying a baby ( Samaria III : 77, PL XII:7, Locus E207).1 A head, neck and shoulder fragment of a mold from Ashdod has sim- ilar individual facial features, such as a broad nose, almond-shaped eyes and "Archaic" smile; however, the simple coiffure is very different and the overall rendition is much plainer {Ashdod /: Pl. XXVII: 1, survey find). A mold from Tel Jemmeh appears to have facial features similar to our PL 30:1, though the photograph is not clear; Petrie dates this mold to 1000 BCE (Jemmeh: 18, Pl. XXXVI:6).2 A mold from Tel Halif dated to the 10th century (Tel Halifi 194, PL 24:b) has very distinct and unusual stylistic features. A mold from Dor (Stern 1994: 124, Fig. 67) produced a figurine in Phoenician style showing a 206</page><page sequence="215">nude pregnant figure (head missing), holding her breasts; it recalls our No. 2. An interesting contrast to the head from Tel Batash is a late Iron Age II mold from Tawilan ( Tawilan : Fig. 9.4:1, photo in Fig. 9:51; see also Holland 1975: 315-316); though there are details of face, coiffure and necklace, it is a schematic and grotesque rendition of the fine features of our mold. A mold for a figurine head (apparently meant to be inserted into a separately made body) was found in Stratum II at Megiddo (May 1935: PL XXIII, M4117). Its coiffure is similar to our No. 2, while the nose, cheeks and chin bear a resemblance to the general facial features of all our molds; the details of the inner eye are different, with an emphasized pupil. Moreover, molds for the heads of the Judean "pillar figurines" are exceedingly rare in light of the vast quantity of such figurines found in Judah. For example, in Jerusalem, where the largest number of such figurines is recorded, no molds have been found, though it is likely that the thousands of fig- urines found there were locally produced (Gilbert- Peretz 1996: 39; Holland 1995: 168; Kletter 1996). Examples of such head molds are Beth Shemesh III : 67, PL XXII:5; Fig. 4:3-4, from Room 377; Lachish III: PL 31:14. A few clay plaque figurines found in the Shep- helah and the coastal plain belong to the same gen- eral style as our mold No. 3. They conform to a group of figurines that are found in the coastal and northern plains of Israel. Kletter (1996: 34-35; 278, Appendix 5.V.9) classified the figurines made from our molds as "plaque figurines," while admitting that our figurines are unique. From the stylistic point of view, our figurines have much in common with several of the figurines defined by Kletter as "Coastal and Northern Moulded-face Types," particularly those in his Appendix 5.III.2 ("'delicate' coastal types"; Kletter 1996: 32-34). It seems that in Kletter' s classification there is an overlap between Appendix 5. Ill ("moulded-face types") and Appen- dix 5.V ("plaque figurines"); since plaque figurines were made in molds, their faces were naturally also moldmade. Plaque figurines from Aphek and Tel Rehov, dated to the 10th century, are among the earliest examples of Iron Age II nude female moldmade figurines, to which our molds belong (Kochavi 1989: 90, Fig. 75; Mazar and Camp 2000: frontispiece). A 7th century clay female head from Tel Miqne (Gitin 1995: 73, Fig. 4.17) belongs to the same general family of plaque figurine heads, though the execu- tion of the details is inferior to our example; the coiffure is similar. Four figurine heads from Tel Sera' (Oren in NEAEHL 4: 1333) are dated to the 7th century. They also belong to the same tradition and one of them (second from right) recalls our figurines in its facial features and coiffure. These heads have tangs that enabled to connect them to a separate body; thus, their definition as "pillared figurines" (in the caption) is questionable. Kletter (1996: 32) included these figurines from Tel Miqne and Tel Sera' in his "Coastal and Northern Moulded-Face Types." A female clay head from Tell Deir 'Alia found in the Neo-Assyrian level (dated 750-600 BCE) (Van Der Kooij and Ibrahim 1989: 104, No. 126) belongs to the same tradition. Two plaque fig- urines holding their breasts and a head from Dor (Stern 1994: 124, Fig. 66), along with the mold mentioned above, were identified as "Astartes" and attributed by Stern to the Phoenician milieu. Though stylistic details differ from our molds, these belong to the same general tradition. Note also the heads (which appear to have belonged to plaque figurines) and full-figure female plaques from Megiddo; most are dated to the Iron Age II (May 1935: Pis. XXIII- XXX, apart from M4117 on Pl. XXIII, which is a mold). Though in general these are stylistically dif- ferent from our molds, there are some shared fea- tures.3 Our molds, which continue the long-lived manu- facture of female plaque figurines of the Late Bronze Age, belong to an artistic tradition that is foreign to Judah and has its roots in Phoenician art, and perhaps also in Philistia. The artistic style of the Batash fig- ures and the details of their physiognomy are quite exceptional among the clay figurines found in Iron Age Palestine. It may be suggested that while these molds were locally made, the "master" originals, which could have been made of ivory, were probably imported items, perhaps from Phoenicia. The pres- ence of these molds at Tel Batash would suggest production of figurines at the site; however, the dearth of clay figurines at our site is curious. There is no doubt in our view that nude female figures were used in some kind of cultic activity. Most scholars believe that they represent a female goddess. The identity of this goddess can be either Ashtoreth or Asherah. The title "Astarte figurines" is commonly given to such female figurines, though its precision is questionable. For example, the resem- blance of such figurines to the Egyptian depiction of 207</page><page sequence="216">gdi-Asherah led Day to suggest that they represent Asherah (Day 1992: 494). Another possibility is that such figurines did not represent a specific goddess, but were used by women as talismans for fertility (see also Kletter 1996: 73-81 on the function of the Judean pillar figurines). B. CLAY FIGURINES 1. Reg. No. 1183, Locus 765, lower street level attributed to Stratum III or II, Area D (Pl. 57:15; Photo 136) Photo 136. Pillar figurine (PL 57:15). Scale 1:1. Height: 7.8 cm; head and base are missing. This is a typical Judean "pillar figurine" showing a schematic female torso with hands supporting her breasts. These wheelmade figurines with moldmade heads have been widely discussed (Albright in TBM III: 69-70, 138-141; Holland 1975: 178-215, Type A.x.b; Gilbert-Peretz 1996: Type A3; Kletter 1996). Such figurines were popular in Judah from the 8th century until the end of the Iron Age and are rarely found outside this region (May 1935: 31, Gilbert- Peretz 1996: 30-37; Kletter 1996: 45-46). Our fig- urine marks the westernmost distribution zone of such figurines and was probably brought to the site from Judah. It is one of the distinct Judean finds at Tel Batash (see Kletter 1996: 46, who suggests that the few such figurines found in the western Shep- helah may reflect mixed populations in this border zone, or cultural contacts along the frontier). 2. Reg. No. H8590, Locus H862, Area H, Stratum I and topsoil (PL 99:1; Photo 137) Photo 137. Female figurine (PL 99:1). Scale 1:1. The head and upper torso of a solid clay female figure, 4.8 cm high, found in topsoil. The facial features are blurred, with almond-shaped eyes sur- rounded by a double line; the flat nose runs into the upper lip. The mouth is pursed in a slight smile. A row of small round curls along the forehead represent the edge of a headdress or wig that covers the entire head and back, like a hood. The arms are crossed, with the hands supporting the breasts. This is prob- ably a fragment of a moldmade figurine in Phoe- nician style, which may belong to either the late Iron Age or the Persian period (unlike most figurines of the latter it is not hollow; compare Mevorakh : Fig. 11:2, a hollow female head with very similar head- dress, attributed to the late Persian period, 4th cen- tury). The coiffure is defined there as an "Egyptian wig with round curls on the forehead in the Greek fashion. This fusion of styles is common in Phoe- nician figurines of the late Persian period" ( Mevor- akh : 42; Stern 1982: 180). 3. Reg. No. F601 7, from topsoil of Locus F603, Area F (Pl. 78:10; Photo 138) The hollow head of a bearded figure. The eyes and mouth are applied pellets, with the mouth incised to form lips. The cheeks are prominently rounded, and the nose is broken. A double incised line along the forehead and curving down to the cheeks is perhaps a headdress or cap, while the back is combed with incised lines that may be the coiffure or a con- 208</page><page sequence="217">Photo 138. Male figurine head (Pl. 78:10). Scale 1:1. tinuation of the headdress. This figurine head was found in topsoil and its date remains obscure. A small fragment of a hollow figurine (only cheek, nose and mouth preserved) from a late Iron Age context at Ashdod is reminiscent of our head, though lacking the protruding cheeks ( Ashdod IV : Fig. 34:3). C. ANTHROPOMORPHIC VESSEL? Reg. No. 9084, Locus 914 , Unit 914 , Area E, Stratum II (PI. 56:5; Photo 139) Photo 139. Anthropomorphic vessel? (PL 56:5). Scale 1:1. A small red-slipped fragment of a molded eye and top of the bridge of the nose. The fragment is 2.6 cm tall, and thus the full face could have been almost life-size. It was possibly part of an anthropomorphic vessel or miniature mask, but the definition of the object remains obscure. This small fragment may perhaps be compared to anthropomorphic cups at Ashdod (Ashdod II-III: Fig. 65:7-9 = PL LIX:2^1, Strata VIII-VII). These are red-slipped and some have black painted lines; all have wide round eyes and a prominent nose. The face appears to have been applied by hand to a small wheelmade cylindrical vessel, though no complete example of such a cup has been preserved. Examples of similar fragments were found at the City of David (Gilbert-Peretz 1996: 39, Fig. 18:6-7, Stratum 14 fill, 10th century) and were understood as possible mask fragments (ibid.: 31, Table 2). A fragment of a similar anthro- pomorphic vessel was found in Area S at Tel Beth Shean and may be dated to the 1 1th or 10th centuries (unpublished). D. ZOOMORPHIC SPOUTS 1. Reg. No. D8086, Locus D809, Area D, Stratum IV (PL 6:18; Photo 140) Photo 140. Zoomorphic spout (PL 6:18). Scale 1:1. A zoomorphic spout with protrusions, which are most likely ears, on both sides of the head; this appears to be a horse. The eye pellets are applied in plastic relief, as is a clay application to the forehead, the meaning of which remains obscure (if the animal is identified as a horse, this could be the mane). It 209</page><page sequence="218">was found on a floor in a domestic context. The closest comparison is a horse head and neck spout from Lachish, with similar eyes; the clay application between the ears is understood as a bridle {Lachish III: PL 32:8, red painted, surface find). Though less similar, analogy might be made to TBM III: 41, PI. 29:2, Stratum B, with a narrower muzzle and no mane; see also Samaria III : PI. 12:4, Locus E207, eye pellets, no mane; Fig. B:3, Locus E207, part of a vessel, a horse with applied mane and eye pellets. 2. Reg. No. 7432, Locus 861 , Unit 756, Area D, Stratum IV (PI. 8:11; Photo 141) Photo 141. Zoomorphic spout (PL 8:11). Scale 1:1. A zoomorphic spout with an elongated muzzle, broken on the end; it possibly depicts a horse. The fragment is red-slipped and burnished, with hori- zontal black lines on the neck and face and a white band around the ear. The eye pellets were applied in plastic relief. There is a point on the top of its head which may be a schematic rendition of ears. It was found in a matrix of collapsed mudbricks in a domestic context. The style and decoration recall ring vessel (kernos) spouts from Ashdod, such as Ashdod II-III: Pis. 67-71 (Strata VIII-VII); Ashdod IV: Fig. 11:9 (Stratum IX). Some of these have red slip and black and white decoration like ours. Our example can be regarded as a link between the Iron Age I ring vessel spouts from Tell Qasile (Qasile I: 111-112) and the later examples from Ashdod. Compare also Beer-sheba II: Fig. 25:2 (Stratum VII), which is also red-slipped and hand-burnished and has a white band on the neck. 3. Reg. No. E8091, Locus 914, Area E, Stratum II (PI. 56:4; Photo 142) Photo 142. Zoomorphic spout (PL 56:4). Scale 1:1. A spout 7 cm high in the shape of a bovine head, broken at the beginning of the snout, with no eyes preserved. Its size and wide inner hollow (inner diameter of the neck 2.6 cm) show that it most probably belonged to a zoomorphic pouring vessel 210</page><page sequence="219">like those in Beer-sheba I: PL 28:3^4. Such vessels (Holland's Types J.III and IV, Holland 1975: 273- 278) are well known in the 8th and 7th centuries in Judah. They usually lack detailed features other than the gaping mouth and the applied ears or horns. For the shape of the spout compare TBM III: PL 27B:1 = PL 58:1, Stratum A; Lachish V: PL 34:1-3 (various bovine-shaped spouts from Levels III- II); Lachish III: PL 30; these depict horses or donkeys and sometimes have appendages on their backs (con- tainers or riders). At Lachish, a hollow horse head with eyes schematically marked was found in Tomb 106 {Lachish III : PL 27:7). Similar heads, probably depicting horses or donkeys, were found at Lachish in Level II ( Lachish V: PL 34:1-3). A similar head with smaller ears comes from Jerusalem (Holland 1975: Fig. 60:6). For examples of such zoomorphic vessels outside Judah (though all are without pre- served heads), see Ashdod II-III: Fig. 72:3-4 (Stra- tum VII); Fig. 89:4 (Stratum VIII?), both red-slipped and burnished; Jemmeh: PL XV:4, red-slipped and burnished; Samaria III: 77, Fig. B:5, red-slipped, Locus E207. Zoomorphic spouts are common in the Iron Age. See, for example, such objects from Jer- usalem (Gilbert-Peretz 1996: 117, Fig. 15:11-13; 118, Fig. 16:1), though the style differs and the identification of the animals is not secure. NOTES 1 Sukenik identified this as Isis and Horus {Samaria III : 77). Note another mold just above this one in ibid.: Pl. XII that was not mentioned in the text or by Holland. 2 Another mold from Tell Jemmeh is presented in Jemmeh : Pl. XXXVI: 19; it appears to have a head and breasts. However, no provenance is given and the photo is unclear. 3 See further P. Beck's discussion of moldmade nude female figurines holding discs (Beck 1999). 211</page><page sequence="220">CHAPTER VI METAL OBJECTS A. IRON OBJECTS The iron objects found at Tel Batash are for the most part fragmentary and poorly preserved. They consist primarily of knife and sickle blades, together with arrowheads, chisels, nails, a spear, a socket, an awl, and other objects of undetermined function defined in the catalogue as rods, tools, etc. It should be noted initially that descriptions of metal implements in archaeological publications are ambiguous, since various terms are employed for the same part of the implement. The main cause of the problem is the fact that the objects are often "... poorly preserved iron artifacts and typological iden- tifications tend to become extremely personal and subjective. What is an arrowhead for one scholar becomes a spear point for another" (Muhly, Maddin and Stech 1990: 170). The description frequently presupposes the function, which is not always certain or comparable to other publications (e.g. Beit- Arieh's discussion of iron plowshares in Beer-sheba /: 43^4; see also Cross and Milik 1958: 16, note 2). The terminology employed in the following catalogue is based on the following definitions, as appearing in Webster's Seventh New College Dic- tionary. Butt : the thicker or handle end of a tool or weapon Haft : the handle of a weapon or tool Shaft : the long handle of a spear or similar weapon Socket : an opening or hollow that forms a holder for something Tang: a projecting shank, prong, fang or tongue (as on a knife, file or sword) to connect with the handle Tip : the tapering pointed end of an implement The iron objects from Tel Batash were found in a very fragmentary and corroded state. After exami- nation of all the objects by Prof. Michael Notis of the Department of Metallurgy of Lehigh University, Pennsylvania, it was decided to abandon any attempts at metallurgical analysis.

This fragment is narrow with a pointed tip. It has a somewhat wider tang bearing two extant rivets (preserved tang length: 2 cm; width: 0.8 cm). It perhaps served as an awl, though its delicacy indicates that it was not used for heavy tasks. Two additional small fragments of amorphic shape were found together with this piece. 28. Socket. Reg.

This implement consists of a straight round-sectioned rod, bending at a right angle; it is not clear whether the bend is original or post-depo- sitional. Just above the bend is a wider tang (L. 8 cm; W. 4.5 cm; T. 0.8-1.6 cm), flat and slightly trapezoid in section, with two large extant rivets. Between the rivets, on both faces of the tang, are remnants of the wooden handle. The riveted tang was obviously for the handle of what may have been a large agricultural tool or a weapon. 40. Pointed rod. Reg. No. H10219, Locus H1007, Building H959 (PL 95:16) L. 15.6 cm; D. 1-2 cm; severely corroded. This implement appears to be round in section, though corrosion may have distorted an originally thick rhomboid section. The rod tapers to a pointed tip and is narrower at the other end, which is broken. Though the fine pointed tip would indicate that this was a spearhead, the thick round section differs from the more common aerodynamic rhomboid section typical of weapons. Thus, its function is obscure. Stratum I 41. Rod. Reg. No. H10333, Locus H907 (PL 99:9) L. 35 cm; D. 0.6-1.6 cm; severely corroded; many fragments.

DISCUSSION Distribution and Frequency The overwhelming majority of the iron objects was found in Stratum II, with a small amount occurring in Stratum III and even fewer examples in Stratum IV. The earliest iron object recovered in the excavation is No. 43, a blade that was found in a pit whose con- tents were attributed to both Strata V and IV. The blade came from the bottom of this pit, together with late Philistine ceramic forms. The temporal distribution of iron finds from Tel Batash supports the well-documented pattern of the consistent and gradual ascendancy of iron over bronze, especially for the production of weapons and tools of everyday life, beginning in the 12th century and culminating in the 9th century (Waldbaum 1978; Snodgrass 1980; Muhly, Maddin and Stech 1990). However, Rothenberg (1975: 72, note 1) cautions that such a conclusion based on a simple count of metal implements in publications may be distorted by factors such as corrosion and the lack of pub- lication. Technological advances are more diag- nostic. By the 8th century, both archaeological and written records show that weapons and agricultural, domestic and industrial tools were more frequently made of iron than bronze. From this point on, the use of iron became the rule rather than the exception in Israel (Waldbaum 1980: 85). One should of course take into account the fact that the breakdown of iron objects by stratum shown in Table 42 also reflects the nature of the excavation. Stratum II was the most widely exposed, including a destruction level that preserved more finds than the preceding, less extensively excavated Strata III-V. However, despite these limitations, the distribution frequency may 217</page><page sequence="226">indeed be taken as an expression of the supremacy of iron from the 8th century onwards. The distribution of artifacts per building does not indicate any special function or activity for any one unit. Building 950 in Area E contains a relatively wider variety of types than the others, both domestic (knife, chisels and rods) and a weapon (an arrow- head). Buildings F608 and F607 in Area F yielded a miniscule amount of iron objects in comparison to the extremely rich ceramic assemblage. However, the impressive spear or javelin head from Building F607 Table 42. Distribution of iron objects by area and stratum.

Typological Discussion Knife blades Catalogue Nos. 1, 6-8, 12, 15, 24-25, 30, 33, 37-38, 43, 45-48 Most of our blades probably belonged to knives of the type known as "single-edged" or "one-edged" knives (Muhly, Maddin, Stech 1990: 170), though also as "convex-backed" knives (Macdonald 1992: 48-50). Most consist of a slightly curved blade with a thicker outer face and an inner "working" face that is thinner, forming a narrow triangular section. A few of the blades are flat-elliptical or rhomboid in sec- tion, suggesting a midrib. The blades taper towards a pointed tip. The single blade that has convex faces narrowing at the ends (No. 25) was found in an Islamic grave. Many blades contained remains of iron rivets pierced through the flat surface composing the ter- minal end of the blade (the tang), which was inserted into the handle. Occasionally, an imprint of what was apparently a wooden handle is visible between the extant rivets. Iron knives are known from the Iron Age I, when they sometimes appear with ivory handles and bronze rivets ( Qasile II : 6-8; Dothan 1989; Wald- baum 1978, 1982). Numerous riveted iron blades have been found at Iron Age II sites. Among the earliest of these is a fragment of a riveted iron blade found in Tomb 113 at Tell es-Sa'idiyeh (Sa'idiyeh: Fig. 16:6), which is dated by Pritchard to "early in the Iron Age" (ibid.: 29). Though the finds in the tomb are indeed mainly of the Iron Age I, there are two "black juglets" that indicate activity during Iron Age II, and the blade might belong to this period. One of the earliest iron implements from Hazor (Stratum X) was defined as a knife, with one extant rivet; it is ovoid, with a narrow tang, and small like the arrowheads ( Hazor III-IV: PI. CCVII:34).

CCXVILl) and Stratum V {Hazor I: PL LXIX:13; Hazor II: Pl. CVI:37; Hazor III-IV: PL CCXXXIV:l-4). Single- edged iron knives found at Kinneret also bear traces of rivets and are mostly straight and tapering or curved near the tip (Muhly, Maddin and Stech 1990: 166-167, PL 114:1-7). These were assigned to Stra- tum V (10th century) and Stratum II (8th century), though there is no obvious morphological difference between them. At Tell el-Far' ah (N), the riveted iron knives have either straight blades (Tell el-Far 'ah I : PL 69:6) or straight blades curving near the tip (ibid.: PL 69:9-11). They are attributed to Stratum Vild (9th-8th centuries). Iron knives from Megiddo were found in Strata V and III, some with extant rivets ( Megiddo I: Pis. 81:40^42; 83:1^; 83:3 has a bronze rivet); note one earlier example from Stratum VI (Megiddo II: PL 181:58). At Lachish, numerous examples dating to Levels III- II were found both in occupation levels and in the cemeteries (Lachish III : 386, Pis. 54:28-31; 56:10, 26, 34; 57:15, 38; 58:1; 59:7-15). One example (ibid.: PL 54:30) bears traces of a wooden handle between the two extant rivets. Excavations at the Ophel in Jerusalem yielded the riveted end of a single-edged iron knife (Jerusalem, Opheh PL 19:17) dating to Iron Age II. Tell Beit Mirsim yielded several fragments of what appear to be iron knives, attributed to Stratum A (TBM III : PL 61:14-17). A straight iron blade fragment and several blade tips were found in Tomb 8 at Beth Shemesh, dated to the Iron Age II (Beth Shemesh , PEFA : Pis. LXB:1, 10, 14; LXI:38-39, 41). A straight, riveted iron knife blade was found in the Gibeon winery, dating to the Iron Age II ( Gibeon : Fig. 33:23). An iron knife with two extant rivet holes and a flat- elliptical section was found in Area M at Ashdod, in Stratum VIII (Ashdod IV: Fig. 17:5). See Tell el- Far 'ah (S): PL XLIII:547, 548 for iron knives with slightly curved blades and a riveted tang of the same width as the blade, dated to the Twenty-Second Dynasty. Many iron knives with straight or slightly curved blades were found at Tell Jemmeh (Jemmeh: 16, Pis. XXX; XXXI). Most are single-edged, but some have an elliptical section. The tangs, some riveted, are simply the continuation of the blade or become narrower on one edge. Several fragmentary tapering, slightly curved, iron knife blades were found at Beer-sheba Stratum VII (Beer-sheba IL Fig. 25:6) and Stratum VI (ibid.: Fig. 31:4). The tomb of Adoni Nur in Transjordan also yielded straight and slightly curving iron knives, one with an extant rivet (Adoni Nur. PL VIL34-35). Thus, the range of riveted iron knife blades is the 10th-7th centuries, with a distribution throughout the entire country. There appears to have been little typological development during this period, probably due to the utilitarian nature of the shape. Sickle blades Catalogue Nos. 4, 5, 22, 23 The differentiation between knife blades and sicķle blades is ambiguous in many publications, since their often fragmentary state precludes a clear distinction. The morphological definition of a "banana-shaped" curved blade with the inner face sharper than the outer face (which is similar to the typical single- edged knife section) or, as in Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary : "an agricultural implement consisting of a curved metal blade with a short handle fitted on a tang," contributes little to the categorization of these objects from Tel Batash as knives or sickles. However, our Nos. 4, 5, 22 and 23, all curved blades, may have been sickles. Such curved blades, often with tangs and rivets, have been found at numerous sites from the 10th-7th centuries. The following is a partial list. A curved blade with a thicker haft and obtuse angle near its center from Beth Shemesh was defined as a sickle blade and attributed to Stratum III (Beth Shemesh IV : Pl. LIIL56), making this one of the earliest examples. Blades from the 10th century are Tell el-Far 'ah I: PL 70:4 (Stratum Vllb), Kinneret Stratum IV, with a narrow haft on one end (Muhly, Maddin and Stech 1990: PLI 15:8), and Abu Hawam: 26, No. 132 (Stratum III), with a tang. Iron sickle blades, one with an elliptical section and the other single-edged, may be seen in Beer-sheba II: Fig. 31:1-2 (Stratum VI). Several riveted curved blades are in TBM III: PL 61:8-9, 13 (Stratum A). Strongly curved blades defined as sickles were found at Lachish in contexts of Levels III- II (Lachish III: PL 59:3-6; Lachish V: PL 38:1-2). See also Megiddo Strata IV-II (Megiddo I: PL 82). Large and medium- sized curved sickle blades, with both ovoid and single-edged sections, were found at Hazor in Stra- tum VB (Hazor II: Pl. LXXIX:30), VA (ibid.: PL CVI:20, 22, 34) and Stratum IV (ibid.: PL CVI:7). Curved blades, some with rivets, with elliptical, single-edged and double-edged sections, were found at Tell Jemmeh (Jemmeh: 15, Pl. XXVIL8-20, 219</page><page sequence="228">Pl. XXVII:7 has a blunt end and is called a pruning hook). Thus, like the knife blades, sickles were a well- known implement throughout the country during all of Iron Age II. Chisels Catalogue Nos. 2, 13, 17, 35 These are rods with a round or square section and a knob-shaped or flat hammering point which is usu- ally elliptical in section. Such tools could have been uspd to chisel wood, stone, metal or other materials. An object that appears to be similar to our No. 35 is TBM III : PL 61:18 (Stratum A), while another similar object is defined as a socketed woodworker's iron chisel (ibid.: 78, Pl. 61:11). A square-sectioned elongated rod with a blunt edge is Beer-sheba II: Fig. 31:3 (Stratum VI). A similar implement defined as a "spike" was found at Lachish Level II ( Lachish V: PI. 37:15), while an object defined as a chisel or wedge, very similar to our No. 13, comes from the Resi- dency at Lachish {Lachish III: PI. 61:6). A similar object from Tel 'Ira was defined as a chisel (Tel Ira : Fig. 14:3). Six iron chisels found at Tell el-Far'ah (N) , all but one from Stratum Vllb, have a round or rectangular section (Tell el-Far'ah I: PL 71:2-3, 12- 14, 19). Three iron chisels were found at Megiddo in Strata IV-III (Megiddo L PL 83:17-19); to this may be added an iron implement with a bone handle, similar to our No. 35 (ibid.: PL 100:5), found in Stratum III. At Tell Keisan, a similar iron object with a round-sectioned body and square-sectioned end was found (Keisan: Pl. 99:7, Stratum 5). Objects defined as chisels from Tell Jemmeh have rec- tangular or square sections and flat or fan-shaped ends, some with socketed hafts. Their dates range from 950 to 600 BCE (Jemmeh: 16, Pl. XXXIL23- 35). Similar iron implements with pointed and blunt ends, defined as tools, were found in Stratum IX in Area M at Ashdod (Ashdod IV: Fig. 12:5-6). An oval-sectioned iron chisel with a flat, fan-like end was found in Stratum VI at Tell es-Sa'idiyeh (Sa'idiyeh: Fig. 8:23). Rods Catalogue Nos. 14, 16, 18, 19, 40, 41 These are elongated objects, usually round in section, of unknown function. At Lachish, a curved square- sectioned rod, broken on both ends (Lachish V: PL 38:5) and dated to Stratum II, may be similar to our No. 16. Rothenberg proposed that it could have been a "formidable weapon, perhaps a sharp-pointed spike, which was deformed and broken in action" (Rothenberg 1975: 77). However, there is no hard evidence that this was a weapon. Tufnell too sug- gests that similar elongated, pointed rods (called "spikes"; Lachish III: PL 60:8) were weapons, due to their presence among the arrowheads (ibid.: 386); but another, comparable implement from Level III (not bent, with a pointed tip) was termed an "ox goad" (ibid.: PL 61:12). Another object similar to our No. 16 is a rec- tangular-sectioned, thick object with a tapering (broken) tip, termed a "burin" at Tell el-Far'ah (N) Stratum Vllb (Tell el-Far'ah I: PL 70:2). A narrow round-sectioned rod with a fine point stuck through a bone was found at Tell el-Far'ah (N) Stratum Vllb (Tell el-Far'ah I: PL 71:1). A round-sectioned elon- gated pointed rod and two point fragments from Kinneret Strata I- II (Muhly, Maddin and Stech 1990: PL 112: 10-12) may represent implements similar to our Nos. 40-41. Round-sectioned pointed rods from Tell Jemmeh were defined as borers or rimmers (Jemmeh: 16, Pl. XXXIL11-21). Spear/javelin head Catalogue No. 29 This spear or javelin head is relatively large, with a spearhead of 30 cm, and an extant socket of 13 cm. Similar implements come from Tell Beit Mirsim Stratum A. One exceptionally long example, termed a sword by Albright, measures a total of 62.5 cm long, with a maximum width of 4.8 cm. It differs from the Batash weapon in its section (single-edged) and its riveted tang (TBM III: 79, PL 61:12). Several iron implements from Lachish recall ours. One from Level III was termed a "sword" (Lachish III: 386, not illustrated due to poor preservation). Two additional objects were defined as socketed spearheads (ibid.: PL 61:6-7); they are similar in length to ours, reaching ca. 45 cm. An elongated, pointed, elliptical- sectioned iron implement called a lance head was uncovered in the burnt debris near the gate (Lachish III: PL 63:8); since its lower part is missing it is unknown whether it was tanged or socketed (ibid.: 386). A pointed, elongated iron implement from Beth Shemesh Stratum II with what appears to be a flat- elliptical section, broken before the haft, was defined as a javelin head (Beth Shemesh IV: Pl. LIIL60). In comparison, an object that was termed a "javelin head" at Tell el-Far'ah (N) Stratum Vllb (Tell el-Far'ah I: PL 69:1) has a short, split round 220</page><page sequence="229">socket and a shorter, pointed head. A "javelin" from Lachish Level III is also small in comparison with our example {Lachish V: PL 36:10). A leaf-shaped spearhead with a long, hollow tubular socket was found at Tell Jemmeh and dated by Petrie to 1100 BCE {Jemmeh: 15, PL XXVIII:2; the date, however, should be viewed with caution). Iron spearheads found in Cypro-Geometric II to Cypro-Archaic IIB tombs at Amathus in Cyprus are mostly shorter than the Tel Batash spearhead, aver- aging 23 cm in length, though several are as long as 30 cm (Macdonald 1992: 47, Figs. 4-5). There, the common spearhead has a tubular split socket to secure the shaft, as opposed to the complete round socket of the Batash spearhead. Their section ranges from a prominent midrib to ovoid or rhomboid. Our spear- head appears similar to what Macdonald defines as swords (ibid.: Figs. 1-3), though the latter are longer and have a flat tang rather than a socket for the shaft. The presence of this implement in a domestic context, in the destruction debris characteristic of the end of Stratum II, is notable. Arrowheads Catalogue Nos. 3, 9, 20, 34 The few iron arrowheads recovered at Tel Batash are ovoid and leaf-shaped, with an elliptical or single- ribbed section and a straight tang. An exception is No. 9, which has extended wings. The arrowheads constituted sporadic finds in various locations throughout the excavation, with no concentrations that might indicate military activity. Lachish yielded numerous tanged, leaf-shaped and ovoid iron arrowheads, with flat-elliptical or ovoid sections, and some with a midrib. They range in date from Levels V to II. Most of the iron arrowheads found in the British excavation at Lachish came from tombs (e.g. Lachish III : PL 54:46-52, Tomb 106, end of Iron Age II; PL 55:12, Tomb 120, ca. 900 BCE) and Levels III- II occupa- tion loci (ibid.: variations in PL 60; Lachish V: 78-79, PL 36:1-8). Almost 200 arrowheads were found in association with Sennacherib's siege ramp (Ussish- kin 1983: 141, PL 36:2). At Lachish, iron was almost exclusively employed for arrowheads from the 10th to the 7th centuries, with bronze coming back into use for weapons only after 600 BCE {Lachish III : 386). A rare parallel to our No. 9 with its extended wings, though with a wider, more rounded tip, may be cited from Lachish, albeit in a late 5th century context (ibid.: Pl. 61:14). Ovoid iron arrowheads were found at Beth She- mesh in Iron Age II tombs, e.g. Tomb 4 {Beth She- mesh PEFA : PL XL:8), Tomb 5 (ibid.: PL XLII:23) and Tomb 8 (ibid.: Pis. LIX: 2-8; LXB:2, 4, 12-13; LXI:36). Tomb 8 also yielded leaf-shaped, tanged arrowheads (ibid.: Pis. LXB:3; LXL37). Ovoid iron arrowheads, some riveted, were found at Tell Beit Mirsim in Stratum A {TBMIIL 79, Pis. 61:19; 63:27- 28). Beer-sheba II' Fig. 20:17 is a leaf-shaped, tanged iron arrowhead with a thick elliptical section found in Stratum VIII. Various tanged, ovoid and leaf-shaped iron arrowheads with flat-oval section were found at Samaria in Periods V-VI {Samaria III: Fig. 111:1-16). A number of leaf-shaped and ovoid iron arrowheads were found at Tell el-Far' ah (N) in Strata Vllb and Vild {Tell el-Farah I: PL 68:13-24). None of the latter has the extended wings of our No. 9, though some have wider bottoms, creating a triangular shape. Megiddo I: Pis. 80-81 presents a large selection of both ovoid and leaf-shaped tanged arrowheads from Strata V-III. At Tel Kinneret, the tanged iron arrowheads are leaf-shaped and ovoid, with an ovoid section, or sometimes a single rib. A few have wider bottoms, forming a triangle (Muhly, Maddin and Stech 1990: 166, Pl. 113:1-3, 5, 7-9, 13- 17); these belong to Strata II- I, with the exception of one attributed to Stratum VI. Abu Hawam: 26, No. 131 is a leaf-shaped arrowhead from Stratum III. Iron arrowheads from Hazor included a leaf-shaped, ovoid-sectioned, tanged example from Strata X-IX {Hazor III-IV: Pl. CCXL19), and both ovoid and leaf-shaped tanged arrowheads from Stratum V {Hazor II: Pl. CVL31-32; Hazor III-IV: PL CCXXL18) and Stratum IV {Hazor III-IV: 16). Leaf- shaped, tanged arrowheads with an oval section or single mid-rib were also found at Tell el-Far' ah (S) and dated to the Twenty-Second Dynasty {Tell el- Far ah (S): Pl. XLIL343-345). See also Saidiyeh: Fig. 14:27-29 for several tanged, ovoid iron arrow- heads, assigned to Stratum V. Numerous leaf-shaped and ovoid tanged iron arrowheads, usually with an oval section, were found at Tell Jemmeh, some with a single mid-rib {Jemmeh: 15-16, PL XXIX:23-70; Pl. XXVIII: 13-20, defined as spearheads, but almost identical to the arrowheads). One has extended wings ("barbed"), which Petrie dates to 450 BCE and claims was a Greek form (ibid.: 16, PL XXIX:69). The Iron Age II tomb at Sahab yielded three tanged iron arrowheads, one ovoid and two leaf-shaped {Sahab: Pl. XXXIV: 170). Many ovoid and leaf-sha- ped tanged arrowheads, a few with extended wings, 221</page><page sequence="230">were found in the Cypro-Geometric III and Cypro- Archaic I tombs at Amathus (Macdonald 1992: 50- 51, Figs. 12-14). Thus, the leaf-shaped and ovoid iron arrowheads are the most common types in the Iron Age through- out Israel. The arrowhead with extended wings is an unusual form, which might be Cypriot in origin. Plowshare Socket? Catalogue No. 28 This fragment of a round, open socket is most probably part of an iron plowshare of a type known from various Iron Age sites (Borowski 1987: 48-51). Examples are: Beer-sheba I: 43-44 (Stratum II); Lachish III: PL 61:1-4 and Lachish V: PL 37:14 (Levels III-II); TBM III: 78, PL 61:1-3 (Stratum A); Tel Tra: Fig. 14.11:8 (Stratum VI); Jemmeh: 15, PL XXVL2-3, 6); Qiri: Fig. 56:14; Muhly et al. 1990: PL 116:2 (Tel Kinneret Stratum lb, 7th century); and from H. Rosh Zayit in a 10th century context (Gal and Alexandre 2000: 127, Fig. 111.17:1-2). It should be noted that some chisels found at Tell Jemmeh also have open tubular sockets {Jemmeh: PL XXXIL25- 26, 31). A round-sectioned socket found at Hazor Stratum IV was termed a goad {Hazor I: PL LXX:30). Summary The iron implements found at Tel Batash do not constitute an extensive assemblage. However, almost every type characteristic of the Iron Age II throughout the country was represented at the site, reflecting the routine activities of a typical rural town, whose inhabitants had average access to products made from this metal. The gradual pre- dominance of iron over bronze for tools and weapons was certainly reflected at Tel Batash, but factors such as severe corrosion, the coincidence of finds or re- smelting should be taken into account. Only rarely is a well-preserved iron hoard found, like that from Tel Miqne (Gitin 1989a: 34, Fig. 2.8, right, bottom), which illustrates the extensive use of iron during the late Iron Age II. B. BRONZE OBJECTS The few bronze objects found demonstrate the con- tinuity of the use of bronze during the Iron Age II, though they are much smaller in number than the iron objects. Table 45. Distribution of bronze objects by stratum. Object IV III II Bell - - 1 Arrowhead 1 Bracelet 1 "Razors" 1 - 1 Undefined 1 - 2 Total 3-5 Bronze Bell Reg. No. 7200 , Locus 743, Building 743, Area D, Stratum II (PL 39:9 ; Photo 151) Photo 151. Bronze bell (PL 39:9). Scale 1:1. This is a small, well-made bronze bell, with a double suspension ring on top. Its height is 4 cm and its lower outer diameter is 3.4 cm. Its edge is slightly thickened and rounded. The clapper attachment is an omega-shaped bronze wire, which protrudes outside on the top, under the suspension ring. The suspen- sion ring appears to have been cast separately. The clapper itself is missing. The bell was found in Building 743, in a domestic context. A few bronze bells are known from Iron Age sites in Israel (Bayer 1963: 8-12). One found at Megiddo Stratum IV {Megiddo I: PL 77:13) has an iron pin to hold a clapper; it has a straighter body than ours, two lugs on its upper sides, and a thick ring. It may have been intrusive. A bronze bell from Tel 'Ira {Tel Tra: Fig. 14.20:2) resembles ours in size, shape and period. Two bells were found at Lachish, though Tufhell hesitated to attribute them to the Iron Age due to their contexts (ibid.: Pis. 54:19; 58:28). Cast bronze bells are well known in Assyria (Curtis and Reade 1995: 166-167; Rimmer 1969: Figs. XIX-XX). Numerous pictorial depictions, such 222</page><page sequence="231">as Assyrian reliefs from Ashurbanipal's palace (Spear 1978: Figs. 109-113), show the use of bells around horses' necks (compare Zech. 14:20). Wald- baum (1983: 42) suggests that the smaller bells were used around the necks of small animals, such as sheep or goats. However, a small bell like ours could have been used in other ways, for instance in cult practices (Meyers in ABD 1 : 657). Bronze Arrowhead Reg. No. 9293 , Locus 942, Area E, topsoil (PL 78: 17; Photo 152) Photo 152. Bronze arrowhead (PL 78:17). Scale 1:1. A triangular, socketed and barbed bronze arrowhead (L. 3.6 cm; max. W. 1.2 cm). This arrowhead type, termed "Scythian," is well known at the end of the Iron Age and the Persian period. Its origin is appa- rently in Transcaucasia, and from there it arrived in the ancient Near East via the Scythian invaders. Such arrowheads were used by the Babylonian and later the Persian armies throughout the Near East (Stern 1982: 154-156). In Israel, several such arrowheads were found in clear contexts of the end of the Iron Age, while others are known from unstratified or Persian period contexts. In the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem such arrowheads were found near the tower that was conquered by the Babylonians and were thought by Avigad to have been used by the Babylonian army (Avigad 1980: 53-54). Other late and post-Iron Age II examples are En-Gedi : 36, note 120; Fig. 24:7-8; Beth Shemesh, PEFA : 70, PL XXXVIII: 11, Tomb 3; Lachish III : PL 60:53 (post- Exilic); Lachish V: PL 36:15 (unstratified); Jemmeh : 15-16, Pl. XXIX: 13, 17, 19; Samaria III: Fig. 111:19 (Period VIII, made of iron); Gibeon: Fig. 43:22 (end of Iron Age II); Megiddo I: PL 80:27 (Stratum III); PL 88:12-13 (surface finds); Keisan : PL 98:14 (sur- face find); Masos II : PL 173:16 (Stratum III); Adoni Nur: 70, PL VII:30 (7th century). Rothenberg (1975: 80) suggested that the manufacture of such arrow- heads from bronze rather than iron was the result of technological factors in mass production. This arrowhead may be related to the Babylonian con- quest of Timnah. Bronze Bracelet Reg. No. 8093, Locus 874, Area D, Stratum IV (PL 9:14) A crescent-shaped fragment of a bronze bracelet (D. 4.2 cm; T. 0.4 cm) with a rounded section, found in a domestic context. Bronze bracelets appear at various Iron Age II sites. Compare, for example, TBM I: PL 62:7-8 (Stratum B); Megiddo I: PL 87: 9-11 (Stratum IV); Lachish III: Pis. 54:57, 79; 55:3-4, 6-8 (most from 9th century tombs); Lachish V: PL 36:19 (Level II); En-Gedi , Fig. 33:5 (from the Clark Collection); Lahav Tomb: Fig. 12:1-6 (10th to early 9th centuries, defined as "anklets"); Beer-sheba II: Fig. 25:9 (Stratum VII); Qitmit: Fig. 6.3:7; Sahab: PL XXIV:164a-b, 165; Adoni Nur: PL IV:151-153. Tufnell {Lachish III: 390) maintained that bronze bracelets are generally later than those of iron, with iron being used for weapons and tools rather than bangles in the later tomb groups that date from ca. 800 BCE.

GROUND STONE OBJECTS Anat Cohen-Weinberger INTRODUCTION This section presents the stone implements and objects that were considered to have been used for daily household and food preparation purposes (as opposed to other categories of stone objects, including industrial items, presented in Chapter VII:C). This group includes bowls, mortars, pestles, grinding stones and basins. The excavations at Tel Batash yielded 180 domestic stone objects from Strata IV-I and topsoil loci. In the following section, two categories of stone implements and vessels are defined, based on their grinding or pounding function. Attribution of a stone object to one of these categories is based on its morphology and usage marks. Only those objects that appear in the plates are individually mentioned, apart from a few special items. The objectives of this study are to establish a basic typology of the stones, to examine their chrono- logical dispersion within the site and to study the exploitation patterns of raw materials. METHODOLOGY The typological characteristics of stone objects and vessels are generally less determinant than those of pottery vessels for ascertaining chronology or re- gional features. Thus, classification is very much an intuitive procedure. Meticulous typological classi- fication has been performed for large assemblages in the Levant (Wright 1992), but such treatment is virtually meaningless for smaller assemblages. The prevailing state at present is one of confusion in the nomenclature of domestic stone implements. Note Kraybill's attempt to list various synonyms for pounding and grinding stones, as they are termed in the literature (Kraybill 1977: 488). The following discussion follows the method used by Hovers (1996) in the publication of similar stone objects from the City of David. All the objects are presented in Table 48 (pp. 232-237), with the fol- lowing data: Provenience : locus and stratum. Raw material: identification of the raw material was carried out by the naked eye. The raw materials were attributed to eight different types of stone: a. limestone; b. basalt, c. vesicular basalt; d. beachrock; e. chalk; f. sandstone; g. dolomite; h. chert; i. undetermined (stones that were not available for identification at the time of study). Metric measurements : length, width and height were measured at right angles to each other (in fragmentary cases, the maximum values were taken). Depth was measured only in hollow vessels (such as bowls, basins and mortars). The diameter of the vessels was measured in rounded hollow vessels and hemispherical pounding stones (hammerstones). The internal diameter (excluding the walls of the vessels) was measured in mortars, bowls and small bowls. Section shape : this was described for a cross- section across the width of the object. The sections found are: a. round; b. plano-convex; c. plano-con- cave; d. rectangular; e. trapezoidal; f. triangular; g. cubic; h. conical; i. lentoid; j. amorphic. Typology : eight major groups were defined: mor- tars, bowls, basins, upper grinding stones, lower grinding stone, pestles, hemispherical pounding stones (hammerstones) and varia. Mortars, pestles and pounding stones (hammerstones) can be defined as pounding instruments, while the others are related to grinding, as well as food preparation and serving. "Varia" includes items that were only vaguely con- nected with either pounding or grinding, or objects that were unclassifiable. 225</page><page sequence="234">Mortars Reg. No. H111910/3, Locus HI 139, Area H, Stratum IVB (Pl. 81:27) Reg. No. 7516/2 , Locus 743, Building 743, Area D , Stratum II (PI. 53:4) Reg. No. 9393, Locus 950, Building 950, Area E, Stratum II (PI. 39:17; Photo 154) Photo 154. Stone mortar (PL 39:17). Scale 1:5. Eighteen mortars were found, six of them complete. Seventeen were made of limestone and one of undetermined stone. Eleven mortars were found in secure stratigraphie contexts, such as floors or accumulation on floors. Of these, four were from Stratum IV and seven from Stratum II. Mortars were used as the lower stone for pound- ing activity. We utilize the criteria defined by Hovers (1996: 176) for distinguishing between mortars and bowls in her study of the groundstone industry from the City of David. The criteria are metric, and are based on the ratio between the depth of the hollow part relative to the diameter of the opening. The higher the ratio, the more "mortar-like" the object. Thus, in mortars, the angle of the hollow walls is steeper than in the bowls. The reason for this is to ensure that the contents would not fly out during pounding (Hovers 1966: 176; Samuel 1989: 259). However, this distinction between mortars and bowls is not always clear and it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between deep bowls and shallow mortars. In all the vessels described in this study as mortars, the ratio of depth to inner diameter is greater than 0.5. However, in our assemblage, the difference between the ratio of the mortars and that of the bowls is not great. Num. 11:8 mentions the roio (medokha) in parallel to o&gt;m ( rehayim ). It is possible that while the latter term refers to grinding stones (see below), the former refers to mortars. The verb used in this context, roi (dkh, "beat"), may refer to the pounding action of the pestle in the mortar. Bowls Thirty-two stone bowls were found, 16 of which are complete (Photos 155-157). Twenty-three were made of limestone and six of basalt, while the raw material of the remaining three was not determined. Fourteen bowls came from secure stratigraphie contexts: three from Stratum IV, three from Stratum III and eight from Stratum II. Roughly Worked Bowls Reg. No. 1156, Locus 147, Area D, Stratum II (PL 59:19) Reg. No. HI 1052/1, Locus H991, Area H, Stratum IV (PI. 79:16) Reg. No. 9348, Locus 958, Building 950, Area E, Stratum II (PI. 53:3; Photo 157) Many of the bowls in the corpus are merely stones that were barely worked to create a standing base and a shallow hollow work space. This may be the result of the kind of material worked in the bowl, or due to a simple mode of manufacture, perhaps in the household itself. The bowls are shallower than the mortars and their walls are less steep. The ratio between the depth and Photo 155. Stone bowl. Scale 1:5. Photo 156. Stone bowl. Scale 1:5. 226</page><page sequence="235">Photo 157. Stone bowl (PL 53:3). Scale 1:5. the inner diameter is less than 0.44. Though the bowls are categorized as grinding implements, it is not certain that all of them were indeed used in this capacity. The patina that covered the hollow part of some of the bowls made it difficult to determine if there were polish marks. PL 59:19 is rather crudely worked, with a thick base and a relatively shallow hollow (maximum diameter: 15 cm; maximum height: 12 cm; hollow: 2.6 cm deep). Perhaps this was a door socket. Footed Bowls Reg. No. 9291, Locus 942, Area E, Stratum I (PI. 78:15) The fragment of a footed bowl shown in PL 78:15 is a narrow thick base made of basalt with three short, rounded legs; the base diameter is 4.2 cm. For a complete example of such a bowl, see Hazor II: PL CV:1 (Stratum VA). Another footed bowl (not illustrated) was different, made of limestone and almost completely preserved; it is a medium-sized, roughly finished bowl, with three wide, short legs. Nicely Worked Bowl Reg. No. 1135, Locus 142, Area D, Stratum II (PI. 61:11) This fragment of a basalt bowl is set apart by its finer craftsmanship and more careful finish. It is the only such bowl found in the Iron Age II strata. It has a wide, slightly rounded base and short, almost vertical sides with a rounded rim top. The diameter is 26 cm and the height ca. 8 cm. It was found broken and discarded in the debris of a Stratum II street. Small Bowls Reg. No. C8009, Locus C803, Area C, Strata ///-// (PI. 106:6; Photo 158) Reg. No. F6314/1, Locus F630, Area F, Stratum I (PI. 78:16) Photo 158. Small stone bowl (PL 106:6). Scale 1:2. These are small bowls with a shallow hollow. Nine such bowls were found in Strata IV-I, five of them complete. Seven were made of limestone and two of basalt. PL 78: 16 is much better worked than the others in this group. It has a vertical concave wall and a wide convex disc base. It was found in a disturbed locus that contained mainly Stratum I material. The function of these small bowls is not clear; they could have served as grinding or mixing receptacles for small amounts of herbs, cosmetic or medicinal material. This function is the same as that attributed to the so-called "cosmetic bowls" (see below). However, these bowls are simpler and undecorated, and lack the wide rim characteristic of the "cosmetic bowls." Basins Reg. No. 9385, Locus 960, Building 950, Area E, Stratum II (PI. 52:5; Photo 159) Photo 159. Stone basin (PL 52:5). Scale 1:5. The basin has a rectangular or square hollow that distinguishes it from the round-hollowed bowls. Three basins were defined, one of which is complete. One basin was made of beachrock, one of chalk and one of undetermined stone. Two came from Stratum II and one from Strata III- II; PL 52:5 (Stratum II) came from a secure stratigraphie context in Building 950, associated with the oil press. 227</page><page sequence="236">Upper Grinding Stones Reg. No. 7638 , Locus 745, Building 743, Area D, Stratum II (PI. 39:20) Reg. No. 7647, Locus 778, Building 743, Area D, Stratum II (PI. 39:21) Reg. No. 9174/1, Locus 920, Building 950, Area E, Stratum II (PI. 53:1; Photo 160) Ninety-eight upper grinding stones were found, 21 of which are complete. Twenty-seven were made of vesicular basalt, 25 of limestone, 25 ofbeachrock, 17 of basalt, two of sandstone and two of undetermined stone. Forty-four came from secure stratigraphie contexts: six in Stratum IV, eight in Stratum III, 27 in Stratum II and three in Stratum I. PI. 53:1 has a deep groove along the length of its upper part. This is an unusual feature, perhaps to insert a wooden handle. The stone was found in the western part of the Oil Press Building (Building 950) near a well-worked large, flat lower grinding stone (PI. 53:2, see below). The upper grinding stone is the active stone during grinding and is therefore smaller and lighter than the lower grinding stone. It is difficult to distinguish between lower and upper grinding stones when the size is indeterminate. A metric or weight criterion that can distinguish between them has not been estab- lished, and consequently the definition is based on their shape or the ability to hold them while in use. In view of the subjective nature of this definition, some of the stones defined as upper grinding stones may in fact have functioned as lower grinding stones. The section of the upper grinding stone is rec- tangular, triangular or plano-convex. Some of these stones, which are heavy and long, required holding by both hands, while the shorter ones were probably held by one hand. These stones are usually elon- gated, with a flat base and a convex top. The elon- gated and relatively narrow upper grinding stones tend to break along their width. The grinding implements exhibit facets that are often polished. For further discussion, see Hovers 1996: 178. Upper and lower grinding stones were the most common grinding implements in the Iron Age. They were used for the domestic preparation of flour. The fact that this was a daily routine is evidenced by the high frequency of grinding stones found. They can be identified with the biblical o&gt;m (rehayim) (Exod. 11:5; Num. 11:8; Isaiah 47:2; Jer. 25:10). In one place (Deut. 24: 6) o&gt;m and iDn (rekhev) are mentioned separately in the same verse. The former term probably refers to the lower and the latter to the upper grinding stones. Lower Grinding Stones Reg. No. 9174/2, Locus 920, Building 950, Area E, Stratum II (PI. 53:2; Photo 160) Eight lower grinding stones were found, all of them complete. Five were made of vesicular basalt, two of beachrock and one of basalt. Five lower grinding stones were found in secure stratigraphie contexts: one in IV, two in Stratum III and two in Stratum II. The lower grinding stones are heavier and wider than the upper grinding stones, preventing the pow- der from overflowing and affording a convenient work surface. The work surface of the lower grinding stones is usually concave. Pestles Reg. No. H11191/2, Locus HI 139, Area H, Stratum IVB (Pl. 81:26) Reg. No. 7545, Locus 743, Building 743, Area D, Stratum II (PI. 39:18) Photo 160. Upper and lower grinding stones (PL 53:1-2). Scale 1:5. 228</page><page sequence="237">Reg. No. 9680/1 , Locus 982, Building 950, Area E, Stratum II (Pl. 53:5)¡ Nine pestles were found, all of them complete (Photos 161-162). Four were made of limestone, two of basalt and three of undetermined stone. Five pestles were found in secure stratigraphie contexts: one in Stratum IV, one in Stratum III and three in Stratum II. The pestles are elongated in shape. Some are cylindrical (e.g. PL 39:18) and some become slightly wider towards the bottom (e.g. PL 53:5); some appear to have no symmetrical axis. The pestles generally show traces of battering as a result of their use for pounding inside the mortars. Photos 161-162. Stone pestles. Scale 1:3. Hemispherical Pounding Stones (Hammerstones) Reg.

Hemispherical pounding stone (hammerstone) (PL 39:19). Scale 1:2. one of basalt and one of dolomite. All were found in secure stratigraphie contexts. While most of them are rounded, some tend to be somewhat cubical (e.g. PL 75:9). Characteristic traces of battering are generally seen on these implements. Varia This category includes five items that were only vaguely connected with either pounding or grinding, or objects that were unclassifiable. 1. Reg. No. H9049, Locus H904b, Area H, Strata III- II (Pl. 92:16; Photo 164) Photo 164. Basalt object (PI. 92:16). Scale 1:2. This object, made of vesicular basalt, is composed of an oval flat part 3.5 cm in diameter and an upper narrower part, which was the handle. There is an incomplete perforation 2 mm in diameter in the narrower part close to its connection to the wider part. Similar objects made of vesicular basalt are known from various Iron Age contexts and have been defined as scrapers or rubbing stones. Such items may have been used to scrape the skin during bathing, or to rub clothing during washing. Our example is rather coarse compared to others. Selected parallels include Tell Abu Hawam Stratum V ( Abu Hawam: Pl. XXXL345); Megiddo Strata III-V (Megiddo /: PL 106:3, 17-20; Megiddo II' PL 264:5- 9); Hazor Strata VI-V (Hazor /: PL LXIX:II; Hazor II: Pis.

No. F6449, Locus F608, Building F608, Area F, Stratum II (Pl. 70:6) A large deep limestone vat, 47.5 cm in diameter and 229</page><page sequence="238">38 cm high, with a single hole 3 cm in diameter drilled in its wall about 2 cm above the bottom. It was found in Building F608 just south of the flat monolithic stone trough located near the entrance to the house (see Timnah /: 241-242, P/S 102). In the adjacent house, F607, a similar installation was found; however, rather than being a vat, it was a rough stone, hollowed inside. These two installations appear to have served the same function, as did similar and contemporary installations at nearby Tel Miqne ( Timnah /: 263; Gitin 1989a: 29, 34; Figs. 2.3-2.4). 4. Reg.

Distribution Patterns in Buildings 743, 950, F608 and F607 An attempt was made to examine the distribution pattern of grinding stones, mortars and pestles in the four Stratum II buildings (743, 950, F608 and F607) that were completely excavated and were thus chosen for this purpose. Table 46. Distribution of ground stone objects in Stratum II buildings.

In the rear of the house, two upper stones were found in the western room (778) and one in the eastern room (746). In Building 950, the Oil Press Building, six upper grinding stones were found: one in the southwestern part of the building on the stone floor (920) west of the monolith, three in Locus 950 just west of the entrance to the main space of the building, one in the northeastern room (958), and one in debris (947) that apparently fell from the upper story. Thus, the upper grinding stones were dispersed throughout the building. The single lower grinding stone found in the building was in its southwestern part, on stone floor 920. In Building F608, one upper grinding stone was found in Locus F637, in the rear part of this building. In Building F607 one upper grinding stone was found on stone floor F916 in the southwestern part of the main space, to the southwest of the southernmost monolith. The phenomenon of a larger amount of upper than lower grinding stones was consistently noted in all the buildings. In Building 950, the lower grinding stone was found in the rear space. The upper grind- ing stones in all three buildings were found in the front, back and entrance rooms. It may be concluded that the heavy basalt lower grinding stones were expensive and thus less numerous, while upper ones were more common. Perhaps a family owned its own upper grinding stone, while the lower grinding stone 230</page><page sequence="239">was shared by several families (see below). This possibility, which might have interesting social implications, needs to be investigated further at other sites and compared to ethnographic evidence. An opposite phenomenon can be observed con- cerning mortars and pestles: more mortars than pes- tles were found in the Stratum II buildings, and in Strata IV-I in the site as a whole. In Building 743, one mortar and one pestle were found in the southern part of the space west of the monoliths. Another two mortars were found in the northern part of this space (Locus 190). In Building 950, two mortars were revealed in the central space (Loci 950, 946) north of the oil press and one additional mortar was found in debris (947) that apparently fell from the upper story. One pestle was found in Room 982, the eastern room of the building, which has an entrance from Room 946. In Building F607 one mortar was found on the floor southwest of the pillars (Locus F916). No pestles or mortars were found in Building F608. DISCUSSION Unlike some pottery forms, functional stone vessels and implements are conservative in shape and tend to resist rapid typological changes. Moreover, the gen- erality of the types and the limited number of stone objects included here make it impossible to trace any typological developments over time. Stratum II yielded many more items than other strata. This may simply be the result of the wider exposure of Stratum II; it may also reflect the nature of the buildings excavated in this stratum, in which a combination of domestic and industrial activity took place. Especially noteworthy is the vast amount of upper grinding stones compared to the other types. The scanty amount of lower grinding stones com- pared to the upper ones requires an explanation. Two possible reasons may be suggested for this discrep- ancy: 1. The misidentification of some lower grinding stones as upper grinding stones. 2. As mentioned above, the heavy lower grinding stones were placed in defined places that served groups of rooms or a specific work area. The people who used them apparently came with their own upper grinding stones and shared the lower grinding stones. It appears that typological aspects are generally related to the raw material. Chalk is a very soft stone, and thus is not appropriate for grinding or pounding implements. Only one basin, which was apparently not used for grinding or pounding, was made of chalk. Basalt, vesicular basalt and limestone were the most favored raw materials for upper grinding stones. Since the Tel Batash region is characterized by sedimentary rocks, the basalt must have origi- nated in distant regions, like the Golan Heights, the Galilee or the Transjordanian basalt outcrops. The effort invested in transporting heavy basalt objects (or raw stones) over a considerable distance indicates the importance attached to the efficiency of this stone for many of the domestic and industrial implements under discussion. The lack of waste from basalt working at Tel Batash may indicate that the imple- ments were imported to the site ready made, or nearly so (Hovers 1996: 187). The great distance from the raw material perhaps made large basalt objects like lower grinding stones expensive items. This may explain their relative rarity and reinforces Table 47.

Prolonged use of grinding tools resulted in a polish, while it was in fact necessary to retain their roughness in order to ensure efficient use. Vesicular basalt and sandstone have a natural, durable rough- ness that limits the need for re-pecking after grind- ing. Grits are not easily detached from vesicular basalt, permitting the prolonged use of grinding tools made of this material. Limestone is easily smoothed, and implements of this raw material required re-pecking after grinding. An example is an upper grinding stone from Stratum II (Locus F6351, not illustrated), which has one worked facet with polish marks that was sub- sequently re-pecked in order to renew the working surface. Limestone beds are widely exposed in the Tel Batash region. This abundance of raw material is probably the reason for the relatively high number of upper grinding stones of limestone, despite the rel- ative unsuitability of this type of stone for such implements. Indeed, most of the stone implements at Tel Batash were made of limestone. Though beachrock was available not far from the site, implements made of this stone were not com- mon. This is in contrast to the prolific use of basalt, which originated in much more distant regions. The reason for this is clearly related to a preference for the more suitable and durable raw material. Two upper grinding stones were made of sand- stone, which is not available in this region. Sand- stone is exposed in the north of Israel in the Ramim cliff and at the foot of Mount Hermon, in the central mountain range of Samaria (in Wadi el-Malikh and the Tirzah Valley) and in the Negev erosion cirques, as well as in Sinai and Transjordan.

In order to indicate the degree of spher- icity of rounded objects, two diameters were meas- ured at right angles. The mass of the weights is given in grams. Square brackets around the gram value of a weight indicate that the piece is damaged or is a fragment. The original mass of a damaged weight or a fragment was determined by plasticine complemen- tation or by estimation; such a mass is stated in grams preceded by a cautionary "ca.". For each item, a metrological interpretation is proposed by way of an equation that shows the weight's mass in relation to both a table unit (e.g. deben or mina) and a smaller hand unit (e.g. shekel or pym) or a hand unit part. * The author thanks Dr. G.L. Keim and Prof. A. Mazar for inviting him to study the weights and for discussing the interpretations proposed for these finds, for which, however, the author alone remains responsible. Editors ' Note : Regrettably, Dr. Eran passed away during the preparation of this volume. We added several comments and references, especially references to Kletter 1991, a study of the marked Judean weights which includes our examples. See also Kletter's more recent publication (1998), which includes a comprehensive discussion of the subject; specific references to this work are not given here. Stratum IV 1 . Reg.

DISCUSSION Stratum IV Two mute weights were found in Stratum IV (Nos. 1 and 2). Both are made of limestone and are roughly dome-shaped. No. 1 had an original mass of ca. 33.2 g, probably representing four Mesopotamian shekels (4 x 8.3 g), while No. 2 probably represents the Mesopotamian decimal standard unit, though appre- ciably below its original norm. Stratum III Stratum III yielded four weights. Two of them (Nos. 4 and 5) represent the Mesopotamian sexagesimal standard. The other two (Nos. 3 and 6) are modeled on the Mesopotamian decimal standard unit, though appreciably below its original norm (by 3.67% to 2.11%). Stratum II and Stratum I, Surface and Uncertain Contexts The 18 weights from Stratum II, and probably most of the seven other weights, illustrate the complex and eclectic stock of weights used during the 7th century in the Shephelah (Photo 177). From among the four types of inscribed weights known at the time in Judah (Kletter 1991) only shekel, pym and gera weights have been found at Tel Batash; nsp weights are lacking. Four weights (Nos. 12-14 and 20) have the looped shekel sign as well as a hieratic numeral engraved on them.4 Three of these (Nos. 12-14) represent the Judean shekel with deviations of less than 0.75% from the norm value of 1 1 .375 g. The fourth (No. 20) is irregular: while marked as a four-shekel piece, it weighs 42.75 g, representing four units of 10.688 g, i.e. the unit designated by its looped sign is 6% below the shekel norm. With such a unit mass, the weight in fact does not represent the looped-sign shekel but the nsp unit, a further proof that nsp weights were also viewed as representing another type of shekel.5 There are other examples of dome- Photo 177.

Two weights from Stratum II and one from the surface are inscribed pym. One of these (No. 23: 7.52 g) shows a mass deviation from the norm value of only -0.83%. No. 9, with a weight of 8.27 g, 9% above the pym norm value, is clearly modeled on the Mesopotamian sexagesimal shekel. This too is not a unique case. No. 26 is an inscribed Judean pym weight whose weight, 7.67 g, is 1.15% above the norm. A number of inscribed pym weights with the mass of a Mesopotamian sexagesimal shekel have been found elsewhere: at Lachish (8.13 g; Diringer 1942: 86); at Tel Abu Salimah (8.164 g; Petrie and Ellis 1937: 12); at an unknown site (8.224 g; Lemaire 1976: 35); at the Ophel (8.39 g; Jerusalem I: 129) and at Tell en-Nasbeh (0.591 g; Barrois 1932: 69). [Editors' Addition: On the inscribed pym weights, see Kletter 1991. His Table 1 (p. 123) mentions 47 known pym weights, while Table 2 (p. 125) notes that only eight of these (including the three from Tel Batash) were found in specific contexts, all dating from between 701 and 586 BCE. Thirteen more can be attributed to specific sites, though lacking strati- graphic context. Of the 18 found at specific sites (excluding our three), 14 were found in the heartland of Judah (including the northern Negev and Judean Shephelah), and four from the coastal plain (Tell Abu Salimah, Tel Haror, Tell Jemmeh and Ashdod). Tel Batash yielded the highest number of such weights apart from Jerusalem, where four were found. The metrology of the pym shows that it was two-thirds of the shekel (ibid.: 134-135). References to the ap- pearance of the Tel Batash pym weights in Kletter's 242</page><page sequence="251">catalogue are given in our Table 50a: the weights given in his catalogue are somewhat different from those given here. On the pym weights, see also M.A. Powell in ABD VI: 906. The gera weight (our No. 29) was not discussed by Eran or included in Kletter's catalogue (1991: Table 9). The sign on our weight is that of the two- gera weights, but its weight of 5.18 g fits the five- gera weights (Kletter 1991: 134, Table 4; 154, Table 9; discussion on pp. 135-137). The difference between the marks of the two -gera and fi ve-gera weights is very slight, and thus the sign on our weight was probably intended to signify five gera. Note that of the thirteen fi vQ-gera weights mentioned by Kletter, only one came from a known site (Lachish).] Together with these weights marked with Judean denominations, mute weights made from various rocks, such as basalt and hematite, represent earlier traditional standards. Five of these represent the Mesopotamian shekel standards of 8.186/8.41 g. Three (Nos. 18, 25 and 28) are of the lower value and two others (Nos. 15 and 17) are of the higher value. Four weights follow the Egyptian norms. The Egyptian deben! kite standard (91 g = 10 x 9.1 g) is represented by the following mute weights, their deviation less than 1% above the norm value: No. 8: 274.49 g = 30 x 9.147 g; No. 10: 45.88 g = 5 x 9.176 g; No. 21: ca. 2745.5 g = 300 x 9.152 g. These three weights could of course have been used as weights to measure in Judean shekel units. No. 30 is a hematite disc weighing 12.76 g. Weights of such size are unusual. In Egypt they are represented in earlier periods (e.g. Hultsch 1898: 1 1 Iff). Its appearance here can be explained perhaps as having been useful to measure a mass of two beqa (12.76 g =2 x 6.38 g); compare some inscribed beqa weights from Lachish (6.15 g; Diringer 1942: 89) and Gezer (6.109 g; Macalister 1904a: 210; 1912, Vol. II: 285) and of unknown provenance (6.18 g; Lemaire 1976: No. 7). Four weights are of Phoenician standards: Nos. 1 1 and 19, with unit values of 14.825 g and 15.488 g; No. 24, with a unit value of 14.3 g; and No. 7 with 50 units of 14.06 g, the last one clearly below the usual norm value. No. 27, weighing 137.5 g, is from its shape and material not likely to have been of Judean origin. It may however have represented 18 pym units (18 x 7.639 g), as such a unit was only 0.74% more than the norm value. Alternatively, it could have been recognized as a representation of 9 x 15.278 g, one of the Phoenician standard units (^ x 763.9 g). Three Large Weights from the Stratum II Oil Press Building 950 The two large weights Nos. 15 and 17 were found in the Oil Press Building 950 of Stratum II, and No. 18 was found in the street in front of this building. The question may be asked as to the role played by these large scale- weights weighing 501 g, 5050 g and 2471 g respectively, all on the Mesopotamian general shekel standard, in the olive-oil industry? Were they used to weigh silver, or could they have been used for weighing the product? The mass value of the three weights have a ratio of 10:5:1, exactly the same relation as the steps of the Egyptian hekat capacity system: l:2"-īo- The smallest of these three capacity measures, called hin, has been determined as ca. 0.48 liter, i.e. a water weight of 480 g. We know from the Roman period about measuring quantities of oil and honey by weighing on a balance in commercial and pharmaceutical activities.6 Because of their viscosity, honey and oil are not easily transferable from vessel to vessel and certainly not without some loss. It stands to reason, therefore, that measuring quantities of such a commodity in their transport containers by weighing on a balance was employed much earlier than the Roman period. However, the weight of the empty transport vessel is of importance in weighing a quantity of such com- modities. In later times, this weight was called the tare (Goitein 1967: 335). The tare could be weighed on the balance either with actual weight-stones or more easily with any uncalibrated stones, balancing the empty vessel on the other balance pan. With pottery vessels coming in a traditional type and size, stones for the tare could be approximate or the scale- weights for the desired quantity of the commodity could be increased so that they balanced the cus- tomary vessel type. Weighing Larger Quantities by the Pym Standard Inscribed pym weights from the period of the Judean Kingdom have been found only as unit pieces.7 However, the finds at Tel Batash include three mute weights that may be seen as pym multiples: No. 8: 274.4 g = 36 x 7.622 g; No. 19: 232.33 g = 30 x 7.744 g; and No. 27: ca. 137.5 g = 18 x 7.639 g. Ail three weights are multiples of six units. 243</page><page sequence="252">C. OTHER STONE OBJECTS MINIATURE ALTAR Reg.

A fragment of a small, cylindrical limestone object (H. 10.6 cm; D. 10.8 cm), which appears to be a miniature altar. It is roughly worked and asym- metrical. There is a wide ridge along the center of the trunk. At Tel Miqne-Ekron, where a large number of stone altars were found in 7th century contexts in association with the olive oil industry, there were two circular altars, both 22 cm high (Gitin 1989b: 57*, Types E and F, Table 1, Nos. 30, 32). A third round altar from Ekron (ibid.: Type L, Table 1, No. 25) is only 11 cm high. These have a ridge along the middle of the body, like our example. They also have three or four small horns along the rim, which are lacking in ours. Two round altars were also found at Tel Dan (ibid.: 63, Table 1, Nos. 4-5). Gitin contends that these were portable altars, due to their size and context (ibid.: 64). The altar fragment from Tel Batash was found in the destruction debris of Building F607, in a domestic context. Though most of the altars from Ekron were found in buildings associated with the olive oil industry, a few were recovered from domestic contexts as well (the round altars from Tel Dan were surface finds: ibid.: 59). The large amount of altars found at Ekron contrasts with this sole example from Tel Batash. No altars were found in the olive oil press buildings excavated at Tel Batash (Buildings 950 and H959).

The distribution, chronology, function and deco- ration of such bowls have been discussed in several studies (e.g. TBM III: 80-81; Samaria III : 463-464; Thompson 1971, 1972; Barag 1985). It is generally accepted that they were used to grind small amounts of cosmetics or possibly medicine (Thompson 1971: 61, note 1). These bowls are widely distributed in the north, in Judah and in Transjordan (Barag 1985: 215, note 4). Their main chronological range is the 8th to 7th centuries, though they possibly started to appear as early as the 9th century and continued as late as the 6th century. These bowls, which usually range in diameter from 6 to 12 cm, are mostly made of hard white limestone, though examples have been found made of alabaster, basalt and flint; a few were made from more luxurious materials, such as faience, ivory and 244</page><page sequence="253">glass. Bowls made of luxury materials were consid- ered by Barag (ibid.: 216) to have been manufactured by the Phoenicians and imported to supply the local market with an expensive version of a favorite commodity. However, as Thompson (1971: 60-62) notes, the overwhelming majority were made of local hard limestone and were probably produced in var- ious local manufacturing centers. These were more affordable by the average consumer during the Iron Age II. Whether local or imported, the meticulously executed decoration found on many examples is noteworthy in the context of the local assemblages. The cosmetic bowls from Tel Batash are few and plain in comparison with the elaborate ones found at other sites. While undecorated bowls like our No. 1 were found at other sites (e.g. Samaria III : 464; Tawilan : Fig. 9.16:1; Lachish III : PI. 64:8, Level III; TBMIIL Pis. 27B:4; 30:2, Stratum A; Megiddo I: PI. 111:28, Stratum III; Keisan : PI. 83:9, Strata 7-8), most of those found were adorned on the wide flat rim and sometimes the bowl depression, the sides and even the base, often with small drilled circles like our No. 2. The incised decorative motifs and techniques relate these objects to Syro-Phoenician ivory, stone and shell work (Bennett 1967: 199-201; Barag 1985: 219). The simplicity of our examples may be related to the relative poverty of the site's inhabitants or to the late context (late 7th century) in which they were found, or to both these factors. Note also several small stone bowls (such as Pis. 78:16 and 106:6) included in the category of "small bowls" on p. 227, which apparently served similar functions. MINIATURE VESSEL Reg.

Two similar stone stoppers from Lachish Level III had longer downward protrusions; these were deemed "lids" by Zimhoni, as opposed to the stoppers made of mud (Zimhoni 1990: Fig. 1:8-9). See also lime- stone stoppers from Lachish Levels III- II {Lachish III : PL 42:1, with grooved top; PL 64:4). Limestone stoppers (called "plugs"), more crudely executed and with a longer downward protrusion, were found at Kuntillet 'Ajrud (' Ajrud : Fig. 25:8-10). Mushroom- shaped stone stoppers were found at Tawilan in a late Iron Age II context ( Tawilan : Fig. 9.24:1-3). See also Megiddo L PL 107:17, Stratum III. Note the clay stoppers from Areas E and F (Pis. 75:10, 95:14; see pp. 140-141), which are similar in shape. It appears that such objects were made of stone as well as clay, perhaps reflecting a need to seal containers of different contents. OIL PRESS IMPLEMENTS 1. Oil Press Beam Weight Reg.

Each is a stone cylinder made of hard limestone with depressions on both ends, probably for attaching wooden handles. Similar stones, the size of our No. 1, are frequently found at Iron Age sites and explained as roof rollers. However, the fact that all three were found near the stone basin of the oil press indicates that they were used for crushing olives before the pressing oper- ation. The three different stones were possibly used for different quantities of olives or different stages of the crushing operation. 4.

However, this identification remains uncertain in several cases, and some of these stone objects are defined elsewhere in this book as pounding stones (hammerstones) or pestles. This is indicated in the appropriate places. 4 Editors ' Note : For detailed discussion of the distribution and metrology of Judean shekel weights, see Kletter 1991. His catalogue, referred to in our Table 50a, includes the four marked weights from Tel Batash. 5 Editors ' Note : The Bible mentions distortions of weights (thus Amos 8:5). Is it possible that our weight is an example of such a distortion? 6 Reineke 1963: 159, citing Duemichen 1866: 83, 91; Nissen 1892: 850 without references. 7 A strange artifact must be mentioned in this connection: a limestone prism, somewhat damaged, with the word pym incised in Aramaic letters on the front and a nicely cut cavity at the back. It was found at Tell el-Shukaf (Israel Museum No. 57-703 R 167; see Stern 1982: 216, No. 362). By kind permission of the late Mrs. R. Hestrin, the author was able to study the artifact and determine its loss in mass by plasticine complementation, taking into account the specific weight of this material and of the limestone. The original mass of the weight was calculated to have been ca. 95 g. The weight appears to represent what may be called a "heavy" pym of twelve units of ca. 7.9 g. The mass of 112 g stated by Stern cannot be accepted as correct. 247</page><page sequence="256">CHAPTER VIII VARIOUS SMALL FINDS This chapter includes the following classes of small finds: A. Clay loomweights B. Spindle whorls (stone and clay) C. Bone and ivory objects D. Beads (stone, bone, glass and faience) E. Egyptian scarab, seal and amulet A. LOOMWEIGHTS* Daniel C. Browning, Jr. A total of 288 clay and four stone loomweights (Photo 186) was discovered at Tel Batash, most of them from Strata III- II. Table 53 (pp. 253-258) contains a catalogue of these loomweights, present- ing their shape, dimensions and weight wherever possible; for technical reasons, the table lists 273 of the loomweights. STRATUM IV The seven loomweights found in Stratum IV come from domestic contexts. Three were found together in Locus D708, while the others were scattered finds. Larger numbers would probably have been found if the exposure of Stratum IV had been greater. STRATUM III Twenty-four loomweights are known from Stratum III. Their small number is probably due to the limited * Editors ' Note : Since the submission of this paper, a study of loomweights from the City of David was published by O. Shamir (Shamir 1996). It includes a comprehensive comparative study of loomweights in Israel. Note also that concentrations of 60-80 clay loomweights are known from dwellings at Tell Qasile Strata X, IX and VIII (late 11th and 10th centuries) (Shamir 1994). exposure and the nature of the buildings in that stratum, but they provide evidence for weaving activity at our site during the 8th century. Three loomweights were found in Building 737, the LMLK Jars Building ( Timnah I: 189-193); one was found on a surface (Locus 750) in the area of this building, and two were found in the foundation trench of the subsequent Stratum II building's northern wall (Locus 731). They probably originated in Stratum III, since the backfill of this foundation trench originated from the destroyed Stratum III Building 737. These finds may indicate the existence of a loom in Building 737, despite its nature as a public store building, though this cannot be securely determined. In Locus E619, a floor level of early Stratum III, at least 18 unfired clay loomweights were found, of which only five could be taken up intact and only two are registered in the catalogue. These weights were found together with a restorable assemblage of pottery dated to an early phase of Stratum III (Pis. 28-29:1-5; Timnah /: 197). STRATUM II The majority of the loomweights were found in the Stratum II destruction debris. Most excavated dwellings or industrial buildings of this stratum yielded loomweights, some in large quantities. In Building 743, 46 loomweights were dis- covered, 41 of these in Locus 743, which may have been either a roofed hall or an open courtyard {Timnah I: 207). A few additional weights were scattered in the destruction debris towards the northern part (Locus 779) and into the adjacent back room (Locus 778). Most examples in this collection were doughnut-shaped or spherical; only two were conical or bell-shaped. A few other loomweights were found in contemporary debris near this house. Building 950 (the Oil Press Building) contained 63 loomweights in two groups {Timnah I: 218). One concentration was found in Locus 947, the destruc- 248</page><page sequence="257">Photo 186. Loomweights from Stratum II buildings. tion debris covering the entrance hall and Wall 934 (perhaps representing debris from a second floor), and the other group came from destruction debris on the cobbled floor west of the line of pillars (Locus 920). The percentage of conical or bell-shaped loom- weights from this building is much greater than in the other buildings (see Table 52). A number of loom- weights were also found near topsoil in the incom- pletely excavated northwestern section of Area E. In Building F607, 53 loomweights were found ( Timnah I: 244), 44 in the debris on the unpaved floor (Loci F604, F605, F607, F612, and F621) east of the row of pillars. The situation is similar in Building F608, where 66 loomweights were found (Timnah /: 241), 60 from debris in the space east of the row of pillars (Loci F603, F606, F608, and F632). Spherical or doughnut-shaped weights were predominant in both collections; about one in five was conical or bell-shaped (see Table 52). Three additional weights were found in a stone basin (Locus F917) belonging to a third house in the western part of Area F, which was not excavated ( Timnah /: 244). LOOM PLACEMENT AND RELATIONSHIP TO ARCHITECTURE In each of the four Stratum II houses, a large group of loomweights was found in a rectangular space beside a row of monolithic pillars. The question whether one of these spaces was an unroofed court- yard was discussed in Timnah /: 261. Two possibil- ities were presented: that the beaten earth area inside the entrance to these houses remained a courtyard, or that the entire ground floor was roofed. In three of the buildings, 743, F607 and F608, the vast majority of the loomweights were concentrated on the beaten earth floor of the area that might have been either an open courtyard or a roofed hall. In Building 743, the location of the finds suggests the position of a loom underneath the stairway and gal- lery leading to the upstairs quarters (see Timnah I: 261-262). In Building F608, a concentration of loomweights was found between the two northern- most monolithic pillars, suggesting that the loom had been located here ( Timnah /: 241). In Building 950 (the Oil Press Building), the distribution of loomweights differed from the other houses: two concentrations of loomweights were discovered, one in the debris on the paved section of the central space and the other above the building's entrance hall. Both concentrations were found at comparatively high levels within the destruction debris rather than on or near the floor level. This suggests that in this house weaving was conducted in the rooms of a second floor. At Tell Beit Mirsim, Albright related the rows of pillars in domestic courtyards to the practice of 249</page><page sequence="258">weaving on vertical looms. In one case, he inferred that the stone pillars of a courtyard provided anchors for the vertical beams of the loom, "the bases of which were kept in place by double rows of packing with stones averaging about 20 cm. in length" (TBM III : 54, 56). The situation at Timnah, however, con- tradicts this suggestion, since concentrations of loomweights at the site are consistently found to one side of the rows of pillars. If the looms were in use at the time of the buildings' destruction and were placed between the pillars as Albright suggested, one would expect to find loomweights on both sides of the pillars. Nor is the feature of "packing stones" observed by Albright at Tell Beit Mirsim present in most of the Timnah courtyards. Moreover, at other sites concentrations of loomweights have been found in houses without pillars. The rows of stones at Tell Beit Mirsim are probably best understood as narrow bins between the stone pillars, as in our Building 915 ( Timnah /: 218-219). It is not possible from the published descriptions to determine the precise pro- venience within the houses of the loomweights found at Tell Beit Mirsim. A contemporary parallel is provided by Lachish House H. 15: 1003, where 69 loomweights were found on a beaten earth section of the floor against a raised cobbled paving. The loomweights were con- centrated only on the unpaved part of the floor. A plan shows the collection of weights and the charred remains of a vertical wooden post set at the edge of the cobbled surface {Lachish III : 107, Fig. 9). Other parallels exist in mid-8th century houses at Tell es- Sa'idiyeh. In House 3, a collection of loomweights was found in a back corner of a rectangular space (a courtyard?) on the side containing the entrance. Similarly, an assemblage of 42 loomweights was found in an area covering 50 by 30 cm of the unpaved half of a rectangular space (a courtyard?) in House 15. A similar situation exists in House 16 (Sa'idiyeh: 16, 25, Fig. 1), while a contrasting sit- uation is found in House 6, where 79 loomweights were found in a back corner of the cobbled space. Published diagrams of the loomweights as found in House 6 permit a more precise reconstruction of the loom's position Ç Sa'idiyeh : 17-19, Figs. 2-3). The loomweights were found lying diagonally in two rows across the floor, apparently as they fell from their suspended position. The parallel rows of weights radiate from the corner of a pilaster in line with the row of pillars and the back wall of the courtyard, indicating that one of the vertical loom beams stood there. From the position of the weights, it seems that the other beam was placed in the corner of the courtyard's walls rather than along the row of pillars. It is possible to conclude that looms in pillared houses of the Iron Age II were placed in an out-of- the-way position, generally against a wall or in a corner of one of the rectangular spaces, or between the monolithic pillars (see also Tel 'Ira: 445-449). QUANTITY, SIZE AND SHAPE OF THE LOOMWEIGHTS The number of loomweights in each concentration in the Stratum II houses at Timnah is comparable to collections of the same period at other sites in vari- ous parts of the country. At Timnah, the four houses average about 60 loomweights each, almost exactly the average at other sites. Table 51 presents the numbers of loomweights found in individual assemblages at various sites that were completely excavated and for which reliable data are available. The average number of weights in these assemblages (excluding those from Timnah) is 59. Loomweights of spherical or doughnut shape at Timnah are of a size consistent with those known elsewhere. The average height, measured along the axis of the perforation, was 5.7 cm and the average maximum diameter 7.4 cm. The average size of the hole was 1.3 cm. This falls within the limits of 5-8 cm for the height and 6-10 cm for the diameter given by A. Sheffer (1981: 81). The number of weights required per loom would depend on the width of the cloth to be woven and the use of the weights. The consistency of loomweight size (Sheffer 1981: 81) and assemblage sizes at Iron Age sites as indicated by Table 51 suggests that similar products were being woven on each of these looms. Another phenomenon noticeable in the loom- weights at Timnah is the variety of shapes (see Table 52). Spherical or doughnut-shaped loomweights (Types SPH and DON) are by far the predominant type. The only difference between the spherical and doughnut-shaped examples is the ratio of height to diameter. Whether an individual loomweight was produced as spherical or doughnut-shaped was prob- ably due to the whim or habit of the person who made it. Both appear to have functioned in the same manner (see Photo 187). With this type of weight, the warp threads could be gathered in bunches, passed 250</page><page sequence="259">Table 51.

The elongated weights (Types BEL, CNC, PEN, PYR), perforated horizontally near the top, were apparently used in a different manner. The threads were looped through the perforation and the weight hung from them like a pendant. In three of the com- pletely excavated houses at Timnah (Buildings 743, F607 and F608), these types of loomweights con- sistently make up 10-20% of the total collection. An anomaly again exists in the Oil Press Building (Building 950)', where these types comprise 51% of the total number of weights. As mentioned above, the two concentrations of weights in this building seem to have come from a second floor and may 251</page><page sequence="260">Photo 187. Reconstructed Iron Age loom (reconstruction: O. Shamir). even indicate the presence of two separate looms, each using a smaller number of weights. The weights from the Oil Press Building were also slightly smaller than those in other assemblages at the site. Perhaps they were used in weaving of a type dif- ferent from that practiced on the looms in the other houses at Timnah. Pendant-type weights are rarely noted in excava- tion reports (for example, Sheffer 1981 does not mention them) but surely existed at other sites in the Iron Age. The presence of a small number of pendant loomweights has been reported at Tell es-Sa'idiyeh (Sa'idiyeh: 35, Fig. 170:1). They also exist in small percentages in the finds from Tel Miqne and Tell Qasile, judging from examination of the finds from these sites (kindly permitted by S. Gitin and A. Mazar respectively). The function of these loom- weights, as opposed to the more numerous centrally perforated type, is unclear. The excavators of Tell Keisan suggest that smaller loomweights (at Keisan, of the same shape), which occur in consistent ratios, were used for different, perhaps lighter or more delicate, threads incorporated in the edges of the cloth being woven ( Keisan : 312). Indeed, the pend- ant-type weights are generally smaller and lighter than their doughnut-shaped and spherical counter- parts, and may have been used in this way. THE PRODUCTS OF VERTICAL WARP- WEIGHTED LOOMS Loomweights provide evidence only of weaving conducted on vertical warp-weighted looms. In such looms, the horizontal weft threads are woven between alternating groups of vertical warp threads that are kept under constant tension by the weights. The wefts did all the bending around the taut warp threads and were beaten in quite tightly so that the warps barely showed. This type of weaving is called "tapestry," whether the threads change color or not (Bellinger 1950: 2-3). Tapestry wefts frequently do not cross from selvage to selvage, but turn back in the course of a row in order to create patterns or pictures in the face of the fabric. Complicated pat- terns might be woven as easily as monochrome cloth on such a loom (Bellinger 1951: 1). Wool, the predominant fiber in Palestine, was generally used in tapestry weaving. The physical nature of loomweights from Timnah and con- temporary sites, however, makes it unlikely that they were used for wool warp threads. The average size and mass of Iron Age II loomweights in Palestine is consistently greater than those of other periods, a difference noticed and commented on by several excavators without conclusions (e.g. Lapp 1969: 47; En-Gedi : 44; Keisan : 318-320). Most recently, Z. Gal has cited the larger size of Iron Age loomweights as evidence that they are actually jar stoppers (Gal 1989). Rather, the exceptional size of Iron Age loomweights, when compared to those of other periods, serves as evidence for the mixing of linen and wool in a tapestry weave. Wool and linen could be mixed in tapestry weaving on warp weighted looms. The character- istics of the fibers, however, dictated the way in which they were combined. Linen does not take dyes well and could not be used as the visible colored weft threads. But linen threads can withstand great tension (Riefstahl: 1944: 28-29; Bellinger 1950: 2-3; Sheffer 252</page><page sequence="261">1981: 151) such as would be required on the warps to hold the wefts of a complicated pattern in place during weaving. Wool threads, on the other hand, are spongy and subject to excessive stretching if the tension, a function of the mass of the loomweights, is too great. Wool also takes dye rather well and could be used in the weft, visible but not under tension (Bellinger 1951: 2). Therefore, when mixed in a tapestry weave, linen would be used as the nearly invisible warp while the pattern-producing threads of the weft were of dyed wool. The loomweights found at Timnah parallel those from other sites in the Shephelah and the northern Jordan Valley during the latter part of Iron Age II. Indeed, the finds reveal the existence of textile industries centered in these areas. The supposition that linen and wool were woven together on the many warp-weighted looms of late Iron Age Pales- tine is quite in agreement with evidence from con- temporary Assyrian tribute lists for the type of products received from there. These products are consistently referred to in Assyrian records as linen- based garments with multicolored woolen deco- ration. It is not unreasonable to suppose that the mixed linen and colored wool garments demanded as tribute by Assyria were produced on the looms evi- denced at Timnah and elsewhere in the Shephelah for that very purpose (Browning 1988: 159-173). [Editors' Note' If this conclusion is correct, the cloth manufactured would be defined as sha ' atnez , a mixture of linen and wool which was prohibited by biblical law. Note that pieces of cloth found at Kuntillet 'Ajrud consisted of such a mixture (Sheffer and Tidhar 1991).] CONCLUSIONS The foregoing interpretation implies some gov- ernmental control of textile production, though loomweights found at Timnah and elsewhere in the Shephelah are typically connected with domestic structures. Nevertheless, royal interest in textile production may have been effected through some kind of levy system, such as that documented in the Mycenaean Linear B tablets (Ventris and Chadwick 1956: 297-301; Chadwick 1976: 154-155). A system of this type may lie behind the mention of the "families of the house of linen workers at Beth- ashbea" in 1 Chr. 4:21. The reference to potters who "dwelt there with the king for his work" in the continuation of this passage (verse 23) implies that the linen work was also done under royal auspices. This work may have been apportioned among "families" who had a tradition of textile working, and conducted in private homes. CATALOGUE Table 53 is the catalogue of the Iron Age II loom- weights found at Timnah. For the shape designations, see above, Table 52. The height was measured along the axis of the perforation for the spherical and doughnut-shaped weights, and from the base to the tip for the pendant types. The diameter is the max- imum measured perpendicular to the perforation for all types. In cases where no data appear, the loom- weight was unavailable or was too badly dis- integrated for examination. Table 53. Catalogue of Iron Age II loomweights. Reg.

The dimensions of the sherd are 5.5 x 3.5 cm. The impression, which measures about 2 x 5.5 cm., is clearly visible on the thin creamy surface of the ware (slip?). The impression was apparently made by pressing the fabric with the finger on the wet pot, before firing. The woven fabric was sheer and the threads thin, as both warp and weft threads can be easily distinguished. The weave is plain tabby, the simplest form of weaving, and in both directions there are about 12 threads in one centimeter. The threads of both systems (warp and weft) are hard spun to the right ("S"-spun). There is no distinction between the two systems, as far as the spinning of the threads or the weaving density is concerned. In the Iron Age, the material used for weaving was either wool or linen. It may be assumed that the material that left its impression on the sherd was linen and not wool. Wool fibers are covered with scales that catch on each other during the process of weaving. Consequently, wool warp is hard spun and widely spaced on the loom, while the weakly spun weft is beaten tight together. The technique with hard spun, widely spaced warp and loosely spun, tightly woven weft was standard for early wool weaving. Therefore, there is a difference between the two sys- tems in count (number of threads in one centimeter) and twist (number of twists in one centimeter). Linen is a very fine fiber, which when spun makes the tough thread smoother. The warp threads can be set on the loom touching one another and can have any number of weft threads beaten in among them. In Egypt, "the linen country," the custom was to weave with very crowded warps and fewer wefts and the number of threads per centimeter was very high (Bellinger 1950: 2). On the other hand, in Israel during the 1st century CE, the tendency was to weave linen with an equal number of warp and weft and the count of threads in one centimeter was low (Crowfoot 1955: 22). We may assume that it was already practiced in earlier times, such as during the 7th century BCE. A comparison with other textile impressions found in Israel showing a tendency to an equal number of warp and weft in one centimeter, and believed to be linen (Sheffer 1976: 85, note 8), supports the assumption that the woven textile impression on this particular sherd is also of linen. B. SPINDLE WHORLS Written with Orit Shamir Spindle whorls were rare at Tel Batash, a fact that is noteworthy in light of the abundance of loomweights found in each of the buildings of Stratum II. The apparent reason for this is that most of the whorls during the Iron Age were made of wood, and thus were not preserved. Such wooden whorls were indeed found at Tell el-Hammeh (Cahill et al. 1989: 37) and in Egypt. FLAT DISC WHORLS 1. Reg.

The perforation is slightly off center and was drilled after firing. The small remnant of the body above the base was worked to a rounded finish. This appears to have served as a spindle whorl in secon- dary use.

Its perforation, 259</page><page sequence="268">drilled after firing, is in the center. Such whorls have extreme longevity, ranging from as early as the Neolithic period on, with the main distribution in the Iron Age (Shamir 1996: 150). For examples see Beer-sheba II: Fig. 19:14 (Stratum IX, roughly worked); Fig. 25:17 (Stratum VII); Jerusalem, City of David (Shamir 1996: 149-150, Type B3h, Fig. 22:4-10, Iron Age II); Lachish III : PI. 41:14 (from a cave that apparently served as a potter's workshop); PI. 65:14 (Level III); Tel 'Ira: Fig. 14.3; Megiddo I: Pis. 93:61; 94:7, 46, 60 (Stratum III); PI. 93:68 (Stratum IV fill); Sa'idiyeh: Fig. 14:24-25 (Stratum V). THICK DISC WHORLS 4. Reg. No. D80I1, Locus 750, Building 737, Area D, Stratum III (PI. 21:33) H. 1.3 cm; D. 4 cm; perforation D. 1 cm; weight 27.93 g. A thick round ceramic disc, with a vertical perforation slightly off center. It is decorated around the edges with incised lines in a running pattern of an "X" separated by two or three vertical lines; the ex- ecution of the design is careless. Several whorls found at Tawilan in a late Iron Age II context are similar ( Tawilan : Fig. 9.29:2-3, 5, 12). Most of the thick whorls decorated with patterns are made of stone (see the parallels quoted below for No. 5 (PI. 39:3); this clay whorl may have been an imi- tation of the decorated stone whorls. 5. Reg. No. 7526, Locus 743, Building 743, Area D, Stratum II (PI. 39:3; Photo 188) Photo 188. Thick disc spindle whorl (PL 39:3). Scale 1:1. H. 1.8 cm; D. 3 cm; perforation D. 0.9 cm; weight 26.20 g. This is a thick, round perforated stone whorl made of limestone of the mizzi akhmar type. Its side is incised with a joining "X" pattern forming rather uneven rhombi which are in turn intersected in the middle by rather uneven horizontal lines; this creates a series of triangles, some of which have tiny incisions of a cross pattern inside. The entire design is bordered on top and bottom by horizontal bands, which sometime meet the apex of the rhombus and sometimes intersect it. The overall execution of this intricate design is rather careless. The whorl was found in the destruction debris in Building 743. An identical pattern was not found on other stone whorls. However, in modern Turkey, individually decorated whorls, each with their own design, are considered the personal signature of the spinner and passed down from generation to generation. This might explain the diversity of designs on the various whorls. General comparisons to decorated thick stone whorls may be found in the following: TBM III : PI. 32:12-13 (Stratum A); Beer-sheba II: Fig. 31:7 (Stratum VI); Tel ' Ira : Fig. 14.26:11 (Stratum VII; see also Nos. 12-13); Megiddo I: PI. 95:30-31 (Stratum V); Masos II: Pis. 171:4; 105:3 (Iron Age II). 6.

A thick round limestone whorl, with three deep horizontal grooves on the exterior. The vertical perforation is in the center. This whorl is similar in concept to Nos. 4 and 5, though with a different geometric design. This may be compared to Masos II: PI. 171:3 (Stratum III) and Megiddo I: PI. 94:1 (Stratum III, limestone); Pis. 93:64 (Stratum III) and 94:69 (Stratum IV) are of similar shape, but are undecorated on their exterior. A whorl made of schist from Tell el-Far'ah (N) is very similar (Tell el-Far 'ah I: PI. 75:37), while two others, one of limestone and one of schist, are similar, though with wider spaced grooves (ibid.: Pl. 75:36, 39).

Some similarly shaped objects from the City of David were considered buttons by Ariel; however, these are decorated and dated to later periods (Ariel 1990: 139-140). Dome-shaped whorls made of various materials are very common at numerous Iron Age sites, e.g. TBM III: PL 32:18-19, 21-22 (Stratum A, bone and stone); Lachish V: PL 34:5 (Level III); Lachish III: PL 65:2- 5 (Level III and Residency, clay and stone); Beth Shemesh, PEFA: PL XXX:23-26 (Tomb 1); Mevor- akh: Fig. 16:19-21 (Stratum VII, black steatite); Samaria III: Fig. 92a:5-6, 10; Abu Hawam: PL XXXVII: 109 (Stratum III); Hazor I: PL LXV:19 (Stratum VI, stone); Sa'idiyeh: Fig. 14:23 (Stratum V); Megiddo I: Pis. 94-95 (Strata V-III, bone and stone); Tel Ira: Fig. 14.4:3-6 (Strata VII-VI, stone). Comparisons to the dome-shaped whorls made of basalt continue to be found in contexts later than the Iron Age, e.g. at the City of David, Jerusalem (Shamir 1996: 150, Type B6k, Fig. 22:11-15, found in contexts up to 70 CE).

C. BONE AND IVORY OBJECTS* BONE PENDANTS 1. Reg. No. 1286, Locus 150, Area D, Stratum III street level (Pl. 57:14; Photo 193) L. 5.9 cm; W. 0.8 cm. A long, drop-shaped bone pendant, with a horizontal perforation near its top; it is decorated with two pairs of incised horizontal lines: under the suspension hole and in the center. It was manufactured from the second or fourth meta- carpal of a horse, donkey or mule. This is one of four examples of similar bone * Bone identifications mentioned in this section were made by M. Craig, of the Faculty of Agriculture, Hebrew University of Jerusalem. pendants found at Tel Batash (three additional pend- ants, decorated with drilled concentric circles, were found in Locus E602, a fill that included mainly Iron Age I pottery and some pottery that may possibly be ascribed to the 10th century and will be published in Timnah III). Piatt (1978) concluded that such pendants are limited to Iron Age Israel. Our pendant is a simple rendition, decorated only with horizontal lines; most of the pendants of this type bear the well-known "ring and dot" motif. They are found throughout the country in contexts ranging from the 10th to 7th centuries, and chronological distinctions between them are not possi- ble; however, most of the examples are found in the early part of Iron Age II and the type becomes rarer later on ( Lachish III. 205; Samaria III : 462). Sugges- tions of their possible function in divination (Tufnell in Lachish III : 194, 205, 381-383) were justifiably rejected by Piatt, who concluded that they were simply pendants. 262</page><page sequence="271">Photo 193. Bone pendant (Pl. 57:14). Scale 1:1. The relatively few pendants decorated only with horizontal incised lines are usually found together with the more abundant intricately ornamented examples (Piatt 1978: 24). For selected parallels comparable to our pendant, see Beth Shemesh, PEFA : Pl. XXX: 16-22 (Tomb 1); TBMIIL PL 32:16 (Stratum A); Ariel 1990: 136, Fig. 17:BI 148-149 (City of David Strata 10-12); Beer-sheba II: Fig. 25:5 (Stratum VII); Lachish III : PL 55:18 (Tomb 120, ca. 9th century); PL 57:30 (Tomb 1002); Jem- meh : PL XXXIII:2; Hazor II: PL CV:33 (Stratum VB); Megiddo I: PL 97:3-5, 12 (Stratum III). The pendant from Tel Batash differs from these analogies in that it has a pair of horizontal lines incised on top and in the center, and not on the top and/or bottom like most of the parallels. 2.

It was found in the destruction debris of Building 743 and was burnt black. It apparently served as a pendant, and may be compared to the analogies suggested for the stone pendant seen in PL 51:7 above (see p. 245). BONE PLAQUE Reg. No. 9588, Locus 987, Area E, Stratum III (Pl. 27:9; Photo 195) Photo 195. Bone plaque (PL 27:9). Scale 1:1. L. 7 cm; W. 7 cm; thickness 0.6 cm. A fragment of a trapezoid flat bone object, manufactured from a cow scapula. The plaque has a horizontal perforation in the center of its narrower end and is decorated with a drilled "circle and dot" motif along the edges; eight complete circles were preserved. The circle in the upper right-hand corner was not completed and is only marked. The back (medial side) is chipped away. Bone objects with concentric circles drilled along the edges are found at various Iron Age II sites, such as an object which was termed a "fan handle" ( TBM III : 83, PL 29:15, Stratum A; Lachish III : PL 63:12, Level III). Three similar objects were found in the City of David, Jerusalem, in Iron Age II contexts; these have a double row of circle and dots along the narrow perforated end (Ariel 1990: 134-136, Fig. 16). 263</page><page sequence="272">The decorative motif of a drilled circle and dot is common on bone and stone objects and ornaments during the Iron Age II, such as the cosmetic bowls and pendants discussed above. Rectangular flat bone plaques with circles and dots are sometimes ex- plained as "calendars," since some of them have 30 such perforations, perhaps representing the days of the month (Piatt 1978: 24-25; see Lachish III : PL 55:27, 28, Tomb 218, 9th century). However, these have three vertical rows of ten holes each, rather than a decorative concentric circle motif along the edge such as ours. Our object is similar in general shape and deco- ration to a group of slightly trapezoidal limestone and alabaster palettes that were used for the mixing of cosmetics (Bennett 1967; Brandl 1984: 33, Fig. 14; Barag 1985: 219-223). These have a narrow end often decorated with a female head, and some examples also have a suspension hole. This group should be dated to the 7th century (Barag 1985: 221). Bennett mentions two very similar objects from Tell en-Nasbeh ( Nasbeh II: PI. 90:23) and Tell Jemmeh ( Jemmeh : PI. XXXIV:4), which were made of bone like ours, and compares them to the stone palette from Umm el-Biyara (Bennett 1967: 198). However, it is doubtful whether such fragile bone objects were used for the same purposes as the stone palettes. Thus, though the fragmentary nature of our plaque precludes definite identification, we may suggest either that it was similar to the so-called "fan han- dle," or that it was perhaps a bone palette like those found at Tell Jemmeh and Tell en-Nasbeh. BONE SPATULAS 1. Reg. No. 7585 , Locus 778, Building 743, Area D, Stratum II (PI. 40:8) L. 6.2 cm; W. 2.5 cm; thickness 0.14 cm. The tapering, sharp tip of a thin, flat-sectioned bone spatula, burnt black. 2. Reg. No. F6I63, F606, Building F608, Area F, Stratum II (PI. 69:10) L. 2.5 cm; W. 1.7 cm; thickness 0.2 cm. The tapering rounded tip of a bone spatula. A comprehensive discussion and list of parallels of such bone spatulas is given by Ariel, who concludes that though such objects are found from Neolithic to Hellenistic times, their main concentration is in the Iron Age II (Ariel 1990: 127-134). For selected parallels, see Lachish III : PI. 63:22-27 (Levels III- II); En-Gedi : Fig. 24:12 (Stratum V); Samaria III: Fig. 115:4-5 (Periods V-VI); Megiddo I: PL 95:39-62 (Strata IV-I, various shapes and sizes); Gibeon : Fig. 33:20.24-25, 28-29 (Iron Age II winery); Sa'idiyeh: Fig. 14:35 (Stratum V, rounded edge); Hazor I: PL LXIX:12 (Stratum V); Hazor II: PL LXXVIII:24 (Stratum X); Tel Ira: Fig. 14.5:5-11. The most widely accepted explanation for the function of such spatulas is that they were used in the weaving and clothing industries (&lt; Samaria III: 461- 462; Ariel 1990: 134). Other suggestions are that they were used as writing styli, tools for net making, cosmetic application or even ophthalmic instruments (Van Beek 1990). Both the spatulas from Tel Batash were found in domestic contexts, in the destruction debris that marked the end of Stratum II. Both were found in loci together with several loomweights, which might support the idea that they were used in weaving. BONE ARROWHEAD Reg.

A small leaf- shaped and tanged bone object, similar in shape to an arrowhead, with a flattened oval section; the tapering tang is broken. The arrowhead was manufactured from the premaxilla of a cow. Though it is possible that this implement was used for other purposes, bone arrowheads are mentioned as found together with iron arrowheads {Lachish III: 264</page><page sequence="273">398). Petrie ( Jemmeh : 16) suggests that arrowheads of bone were brought in when supplies of metal were scarce. See also Gibeon : Fig. 51:3 (Iron Age II); Lachish III: PL 63:16-20 (Level III; these were found together with iron arrowheads, ibid.: 389). OTHER WORKED BONES 1. Reg.

It is the left horn core of a Capra hircus (domestic goat). The smooth exterior suggests that it was either intentionally worked or the smoothing took place as a result of its use. It has a horizontal perforation through its center, perhaps for fastening or a handle attachment. Its function is not clear; perhaps it was a small tool. 3. Reg.

No. F 643 5 /1-4, Locus F 637, Building F 608, Area F, Stratum II (PI. 69:13-16) D. 2.4 cm; thickness 0.5 cm. These are four small, burnt flat ivory discs, which were apparently game pieces. Though found above a patchy floor which was disturbed by later activity, their burnt appearance suggests their attribution to the late 7th century conflagration. Whether the pieces were reused in the Persian period or considered refuse to be dumped in this area cannot be determined. Such objects could have been used as game pieces in a board game like Senet, in which five disc-shaped pieces were utilized (for games in ancient Palestine, see Hübner 1992). Similar discs were found at several Iron Age sites such as the City of David (also 2.4 cm in diameter, considered either furniture inlays or game pieces; Ariel 1990: 126-127); Sa'idiyeh : Fig. 14:22 (seven clay discs from Stratum V, burnished on one side, defined as game pieces; Tell el-Far 'ah I: PL 67:5-9 (Strata VIIb,d,e; clay jetons ); Tawilan : Fig. 9.33:2-4.

Small disc beads made of carnelian (?) and faience were found in the City of David, Jerusalem, Stratum 14 (Zuckerman 1996: Figs. 42:1; 44:1, and parallels there). The two beads from Stratum IV and seven from Stratum II were found in domestic occupation levels. Only one of the beads was made of gemstone, while the others were of local limestone, clay, bone, glass and faience. Similarly shaped beads found in con- temporary contexts were often made of more pre- cious materials, suggesting that the inhabitants of Tel Batash were able to afford only cheaper versions of such luxuries. E. A SCARAB, A BULLA AND AN AMULET FROM STRATUM II Baruch Brandl INTRODUCTION The three objects presented below, a scarab, a bulla and an amulet, were all found in various loci of Stratum II, the latest Iron Age settlement at Tel Batash. In this study, an attempt has been made to list all excavated parallels as a basis for future studies. Parallels from collections have been used only when they are essential to the discussion. Hieroglyphic signs are referred to throughout this chapter as they appear in Gardiner's "Sign-list" (Gardiner 1973).1 The archaeological contexts of the finds should not be considered a criterion for their dating; rather, the finds date the contexts in which they were found. DESCRIPTION AND DISCUSSION 1. Scarab Reg. No. 7593, Locus 778, Building 743, Area D; IAA No. 97-1342 (PI. 39:1; Fig. 15) Material : Steatite, with yellowish glaze. Dimensions: L. 13 mm, W. 9 mm, H. 6 mm. Method of Manufacture : Carving, drilling, incising, glazing. Workmanship: Mediocre. Technical Details : Perforated, drilled from both sides. Linear and hollowed-out engraving. Preservation : Complete. Scarab Shape :2 The appearance of the scarab beetle is very schematic, and some of its natural details are replaced by other decorations. Its formal components do not fit in exactly with those appearing in Rowe's typology (Rowe 1936: Pis. 32-35 = Keel 1995: 42, 45 and 53, Figs. 44, 46 and 67), which is used as a standard. Head and Clypeus (HC): The head is a trapezoid with a small semicircle in its lower part and a small vertical notch above it, while the clypeus, shaped like a lotus flower, penetrates into its upper part. The eyes are small triangles. The Tel Batash HC resembles only partly Rowe's Type 49 and to a lesser degree his Type 57.3 Elytra and Pronotum (EP): Both parts are depic- ted as one unit, with two small incisions on the edges 266</page><page sequence="275">Fig. 15. Phoenician scarab (scale 2:1). that indicate the missing boundary line. The EP is an exact equivalent of Type 5 in Rowe's typology. Side : The legs are not depicted, though some diagonal lines in the front, the center and the rear may allude to them. The Tel Batash scarab side partly resembles Rowe's Type 17.4 Only one scarab with the combination HC 49, EP 5 and Side 17, and one scarab with the combination HC 57, EP 5 and Side 17 exist in Rowe's catalogue (Nos. 468 and 214A respectively) both from Tell Jemmeh ( Jemmeh : 10, PL 17:7-8); their dates should be corrected from the Middle Bronze Age to the Iron Age II.5 The scarab fits Type 10 in Hölbl's typology of the steatite scarabs from the first half of the first mil- lennium (Hölbl 1986, Vol. I: 172-174 [Typentafel 1:10], 178-179; Vol. II: PI. 103:3 = Keel 1995: 58, Fig. 70), represented by a scarab exhibited in the National Museum in Cagliari, Sardinia (Matthiae Scandone 1975: 59, PL 14 [No. E 18]). Hölbl com- pared that scarab to three scarabs from Ajia Irini, Cyprus, from contexts dated 650-530/520 BCE.6 Scarab Base : Within a vertical oval frame are depicted eight signs in three registers: The upper register consists of the hieroglyph 'nh "live" (S 34) in a small vertical oval enclosure, flanked by the hieroglyph šn , z3 "protection" or hm "Majesty" (V 7, U 36) on its right and left sides. The central register is occupied by a winged solar disc.7 The lower reg- ister contains two antithetical dšrt signs "the Red Crown of Lower Egypt" (S 3), one on each edge, with two hieroglyphs, one above the other, in between: a k3 "soul or spirit" (D 28) above a hprr "dung-beetle" (L l).8 The arrangement of the signs is reminiscent of some Middle Bronze Age scarabs,9 but two of the signs on our scarab clearly point to a later date: 1) The triangular "leg" of the hieroglyph 'nh10; 2) The developed shape of the wings of the solar disc.11 Four scarabs relatively similar to that from Tel Batash are known: one in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, erroneously dated to the Hyksos period (Newberry 1907: PL 11:36555); two from the former Matouk Collection (Matouk 1977: 216, 221, 365 [Nos. 2045-2046] = 411 [No. 2337], 413 [No. 2471]); and one in the Ashmolean Museum, identical in shape, erroneously dated to the MB IIB-C (Richards 1996: Vol. I: 114-118, Fig. 4.10 [AM.4]; Vol. II: 99 [AM.4]). Unfortunately, all are of unknown provenance. Typology: Generally, this scarab belongs to one of several subgroups of later "imitations" of Second Intermediate Period scarabs produced throughout the Iron Age II along the extended Phoenician coast.12 Date: The scarab should be dated to the 7th century, mainly on the basis of its shape: as mentioned above, the four scarabs belonging to Hölbl's Type 10 of the steatite scarabs were dated to 650-530/520 BCE. The two scarabs from Rowe's catalogue, No. 468 (HC 49, EP 5, Side 17) and No. 214A (HC 57, EP 5, Side 17), seem to belong to the same period. Two more scarabs that were published as con- taining Rowe's HC 57, EP 5 and Side 15 may be added: 1) A scarab from Tomb 82 at Wa'ret Darwish esh-Sharkiyeh east of Tel Gezer (Macalister 1904b: 335-336, Fig. 5; 1912, Vol. I: 334, Fig. 173 left = Rowe 1936: 70, PL 7:265). In his preliminary report Macalister identified it as a relic of the Middle Kingdom, while in his final report that statement was omitted. Rowe erroneously related it to the Hyksos,13 overlooking the other finds from the tomb.14 2) A scarab from Tomb 9 in the Eastern Cemetery of Achziv, in use between the 9th and 7th centuries (Keel 1997: 30-31 [Achsib No. 26]). 267</page><page sequence="276">Archaeological Context: Locus 778 is the south- western room of Building 743 in Area D. The scarab was found inside a holemouth storage jar sunk in its floor (PL 36:5) ( Timnah I: 210). Consequently, this scarab, found in situ , should be considered as belonging to its stratum. Previous Publications : For a color photograph of the scarab's base see Keim and Mazar 1995: 80, Fig. CI 3 (upper left corner), erroneously dated to the Late Bronze Age. 2. Bulla Reg. No. 7060 , Locus 730 , Area D; IAA No. 97-1343 (PL 61:12; Fig. 16) Material: Brown clay. Dimensions: Bulla: L. 20.5 mm, W. 12+ mm, T. 7.5+ mm; Seal : L. 13.5 mm, W. ca. 10 mm. Method of manufacture: A lump of clay was attached to a band of four strings that were tied to a sack close to their knot, but not to the sack itself. As a result of pressure, made most probably by the thumb, the clay lump was then converted into a long, thin strip. In order to reinforce the grip of the strap, one of its long sides was bent over the uppermost string, giving the bulla an L-shaped profile. Finally, the bulla's face was impressed by a seal in the direction of the strings (see our reconstruction, Fig. 17). 15 Workmanship : Bulla: mediocre; Seal: mediocre. Technical Details: Finger and seal impressions on the face, four string impressions on the back, and a knot impression on the bulla's sides. The clay seems to be have been fired at a low temperature, most probably during the destruction of Stratum II. Preservation : Broken; the right edge is missing, but nothing is missing from the impressed motif. Seal Impression :16 Within a vertical oval frame are depicted two divine figures on top of a basket-shaped element. On the left stands the lion-headed goddess Shmt (Sekhmet).17 holding two of her attributes, a w3d (M 13) or papyrus scepter in one hand raised above her head, and an nh (S 34) in her other hand.18 On the right is depicted Hr-p3-hrd (Har- pokrates), "Horus the child",19 seated on a large lotus flower.20 He brings the fingers of one of his hands close to his lips and his sidelock of youth is clearly distinguished.21 On his head he wears the atef (3tf S 8) crown,22 shown in a very schematic form.23 The lower part is occupied by the «è-shaped sign (V 30) that serves as an exergue. Such combinations of Harpokrates and Sekhmet or other goddesses are known on several seals.24 A Fig. 16. Bulla stamped by a Phoenician seal (scale 2:1). Note the reconstructed string sections in the bulla's section and three of its sides (stage a in note 15). 268</page><page sequence="277">Fig. 17. Reconstruction of the bulla's function (stages b-e in note 15). close parallel to the seal that stamped the bulla was found at Douïmès in Carthage (Vercoutter 1945: No. 435 = Gorton 1996: 89 [Type XXVII No. 8]). The motif of "the Infant on the Lotus" was adopted by the Phoenicians and was incorporated into their minor arts on ivories, metal bowls and seals (Hawkes 1982: 88-109; Culican 1968: 80-83). It also appears on Hebrew seals, mainly Israelite,25 as well as on late gem-amulets.26 Seal Shape: It seems that the impression was made by a scarab or scaraboid.27 Typology: The scarab or scaraboid from which this impression was made belongs to the category of "Scarabs bearing Names and Figures of Gods" (Newberry 1906: PL 41). Date : The bulla should be dated to the 7th century, following the date of the parallel to its scarab found at Douïmès in Carthage. That scaraboid, made of paste, whose dimensions are also close to the Tel Batash impression (L. 14 mm, W. 11 mm), was dated to the 7th-6th centuries (Vercoutter 1945: 192, No. 435). Archaeological Context: Locus 730 is the upper surface in the circumferential street north of Building 743 in Area D ( Timnah T. 200). Despite being found in an accumulation on the street, it seems that the bulla was found in its stratum. 3. Amulet Reg. No . H 10220, Locus H1007 , Area H; IAA No. 97-1344 (PI. 95:13; Fig. 18) Material: Faience or composition, traces of blue glaze. Dimensions: H. 24.5 mm, W. 10 mm. Method of Manufacture: Molding, perforation, engraving, glazing, firing. 269</page><page sequence="278">Fig. 18. Naos-shaped amulet (scale 2:1). Workmanship: Mediocre. Technical Details : Made in a bivalve (or double) mold, an eyelet on its top for suspension. Preservation: Complete. Amulet Sides : The amulet looks like a small structure with three walls and an open facade. The facade shows the front view of a cat in relief standing in an entrance. On each of the sides is a papyrus column in relief. On the back are four incised vertical lines. Typology : This object belongs to a small subgroup of three-dimensional amulets in the form of a small shrine or naos, frequently depicted with a standing 270</page><page sequence="279">cat - the goddess B3stt (Bastet)28 - in the en- trance in its facade (Petrie 1914: 46, PL 39 [No. 225]; Reisner 1958: 29-30, PL 8 [Nos. 12751-12754]; Andrews 1994: 97, 111. 98a; Herrmann 1994: 803 [Kat.-Nr. 1328], PL 78, Photo PL 68 [No. 1328]).29 Date: The amulet should be dated to the 7th century on the basis of its dated parallels. One such amulet from Memphis was dated by Petrie to the 26th Dynasty (Petrie 1914: 46, PL 39 [No. 225]). Another parallel was found in the recent excavations at Ashkelon (Herrmann 1994: 803 [Kat.-Nr. 1328], PL 78, photograph on PL 68; 30 Stager 1996: 60-61 [third from right]). It was found together with six other amulets in an alleyway between two of the 7th century buildings - the "Counting House" and "Administrative Building" - in a layer of destruc- tion debris in the stratum that was destroyed in 604 BCE.31 Archaeological Context : Locus H 1007 is part of Building H959 (Oil Press Building) in Area H. The amulet was found in an accumulation on the floor along wall H 1006 ( Timnah 1 : 161). The amulet may therefore be considered as belonging to its stratum. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS All the objects seem to be in situ. They show that during the 7th century there was a paucity of glyptic art at the site, and that all were imported. As such, they point to the economic and cultural connections of Timnah with the Phoenician coast and Egypt. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I would like to thank Prof. B. Sass for the informa- tion on a scarab from the recent excavations at Megiddo, to be published by him. I also thank Prof. L. Stager, director of the Leon Levy Expedition to Ashkelon, and Ms. S. Cohen for the information on the Ashkelon amulet. The photographs were taken by Mrs. M. Salzberger and the drawings made by Mrs. C. Hersch, both under the author's guidance. NOTES 1 This list was recently extended (Hannig 1995: 1 117- 1168). 2 See diagrams showing parts of scarab beetle in Rowe 1936: PL 23; Ward 1978: Frontispiece; Uehlinger 1990: 62, Fig. 78 and Keel 1995: 20, Fig. 1 (this is the most detailed, with the terms in four languages: German, English, French and Italian). 3 In Rowe' s types each clypeus has three small "horns," while in the Tel Batash scarab it has a lotus flower. 4 In Rowe' s type the diagonal lines are missing on the rear edge. 5 Compare Rowe 468 with Keel 1997: 706-707 (Aschkelon No. 44), dated to the 25th-26th Dynasties (728-525 BCE), and Rowe 214A with a scarab from Tell Abu Salima/Sheikh Zuweid (Petrie and Ellis 1937: PL 6:25). 6 I agree with Hölbl's grouping and observation that these are non-Egyptian products. I would add that all these four scarabs are definitely late imitations of Second Intermediate Period originals and not as stated for some of the Ajia Irini items by their publishers (Newberry 1935: 828 [No. 2273]; 829 [Nos. 2486 and 2509]; Pieper 1935: 836 [No. 2129]; 839 [No. 2273]; 840 [No. 2486]; 841 [No. 2509]). 7 Identified as the Bhdty - "The Behdetite, epithet of winged solar Horus" (Gardiner 1973: 564); "He of Behdet = winged sun-disk" (Faulkner 1962: 84; Keel 1995: 170); "The god from Edfu = Horus" (Hannig 1995: 259, 1151 [N 58 in the extended library]). 8 For this sign see also Keel 1995: 169-171. 9 For examples see Newberry 1907: PL 11:36550; Keel 1997: 632-633 (Akko No. 285); Matouk 1977: 216, 221, 365 (No. 2053) = 411 (No. 2336); Petrie and Ellis 1937: PL 6:27. 10 See for example on the scarabs from Tell Jemmeh, Ashkelon and Tell Abu Salima/Sheikh Zuweid men- tioned above in note 5, and on two additional scarabs from the latter site (Petrie and Ellis 1937: PL 6:1, 9). 11 For such wings see a scarab from Lachish ( Lachish III : 124-125; Lachish IV: Pis. 32-33:138) found in Room 1089, attributed to Level III that was destroyed in 701 BCE (Ussishkin 1996: 54-55). An exact parallel was discovered in the recent excavations at Megiddo on a floor dated to the 8th century (Locus 68, Area H, Basket 96H68 ARI); see also Sass 2000: 404, Fig. 12.42.1. 12 These are called the "pseudo-Hyksos group" (Gubel 1 993 : 110-111, 1 2 1 ), or "archaisierender Skarabäus der Spätzeit" (Keel 1995: 58, § 119). 13 Followed by Matouk 1977: 141, 349 (No. 722). 14 There was also a "bone seal" (see in general Keel 1995: 64-66) originally attributed to the 26th Dynasty (Macalister 1904b: 335-336, Fig. 5; 1912, Vol. I: 334, Fig. 173 right = Rowe 1936: 266, PL 29:S 108) and the neck of a typical late Iron Age II pilgrim flask (Macalister 1912, Vol. Ill: PL 94:19) dated to the 8th- 7th centuries. 271</page><page sequence="280">15 In our reconstruction, we have attempted to show several stages: a) To incorporate the sections of the strings in the side views of the bulla; b) To show the strings from both sides of each of their impressions on the back and one of the sides of the bulla; c) To replace the string impressions by the strings; d) To show the bulla's face as it was attached to the strings; e) To show the bulla's position on the sack (see Gerlach 1997: 18-19, 111. 17 left; Stein 1997: 107-108, 111. 108). 16 The directions in the description of this find refer to the impression, and were opposite on the seal. 17 For the goddess Sekhmet see Sternberg 1983. 18 See such representations in Patrick 1972: PI. 9; Ions 1968: 93, 95. 19 For the god Harpokrates see Meeks 1977. 20 For other gods on a flower see Schlögl 1977. 21 E.g. scarabs from Tharros (Hölbl 1986, Vol. I: 274-275, Nos. 29 and 33). 22 For the atef crown see Strauss 1980: col. 814. 23 Compare scarabs from Amrit (Giveon 1985: 148-149 [No. 35]) and Akko (Giveon and Kertesz 1986: No. 124 = Keel 1997: 600-601 [Akko 197]). 24 For scarabs portraying Sekhmet and Harpokrates see Vercoutter 1945: Nos. 66-67 = Gorton 1996: 40-41 (Type XIV, No. 1); 58-59 (Type XX B, No. 10). Other seals depicting a goddess and Harpokrates usually show the goddess Isis (Matthiae Scandone 1975: D 12 = Hölbl 1986: 171-72, Pl. 98:1 = Gorton 1996: 24-25 [Type VIII, No. 16]; Fernandez 1983: 116; Hölbl 1986: 274-275) or Hathor as a cow (Ben-Tor 1989: 75, No. 19). Three more scarabs and a metallic signet ring with the goddess Hathor as a cow were misinterpreted by their publishers: Hall 1913: No. 2545; Vercoutter 1945: No. 256; Hornung and Staehelin 1976: No. 637; Šliwa 1985: No. 86. 25 E.g. Keel and Uehlinger 1992: 282-285, 111. 241a-c = Avigad and Sass 1997: Nos. 4, 126 and 316. 26 E.g. El-Khachab 1971. 27 Incidentally, this is not the only bulla with Harpokrates depicted on it found in Israel. The other bulla was found in Stratum 7a at Tel Ashdod {Ashdod IV : 40, 154-155, Fig. 27:7, PL 24:1 1 = Keel 1997: 670- 671 [Aschdod No. 24]), but its correct identification escaped its publishers. The left side of the lower element in the original drawing is inaccurate; it should look like that on the right, and together they represent the upper part of a lotus flower (see Giveon and Kertesz 1986: No. 123 = Keel 1997: 566-567 [Akko No. 105]). The drawing of the bulla in Keel's publication is completely inaccurate. One can compare it to a paste scaraboid from Douïmès in Carthage (Vercoutter 1945: No. 377 = Gorton 1996: 81, 83 [Type XXV A No. 9]). The Ashdod bulla is also dated to the 7th century. 28 For the goddess Bastet see Otto 1975. 29 For other types of naos-shaped amulets see Petrie 1914: 49, PL 41 (No. 245 ap); Reisner 1958: 29-30, Nos. 12748-12750, 12755-12759, Pis. 8 and 25; Hölbl 1989: 42, 72-74, PL 10 [4a (8)]; Schlick-Nolte and von Droste zu Hülshoff 1990: 330-331 [Kat.-Nr. 328]; Andrews 1994: 97, 111. 98c-d. 30 Despite his correct parallels, Hermann erroneously identified the cat in the entrance as double doors. He repeated this for the back, and overlooked the existence of the papyrus columns on both sides. 31 MC 38993, 50.58 L.262 B.73 FG 14 (in a letter from Ms. Susan Cohen, August 20th, 1997). 272</page><page sequence="281">CHAPTER IX CONCLUSIONS In Timnah /, various subjects related to our site were discussed; these included a survey of the geo- graphical and environmental background, the history of Timnah according to biblical and extrabiblical data, the identification of Tel Batash with biblical Timnah ( Timnah /: 1-9) and issues relating to the town planning and architecture in the various strata (ibid.: 249-263). In this chapter, we present addi- tional conclusions that stem from the material explored in the present volume. The following issues will be discussed below: 1. Relative and absolute chronology. 2. Geopolitics and the relationship between the archaeological finds and the textual evidence. 3. Questions relating to the Iron Age society and economy. A. RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE CHRONOLOGY THE CHRONOLOGICAL ANCHORS The three Iron Age II strata at Tel Batash cover the entire span of the Iron Age II, some 400 years, while Stratum V, which will be fully published in Timnah III , represents the Iron Age I. Thus, there are four strata covering the entire Iron Age, a period of almost 600 years. The following questions can be asked in relation to the chronology of these strata: • What is the time span of each stratum? • How can these strata be correlated to the stratigraphie sequence at other sites in the region? • What is the absolute date of the construction and destruction of each of these strata? • Are there gaps in occupation between some of these strata? There are two chronological anchors to which the two major destructions at Tel Batash can be related: the destruction of Stratum III by Sennacherib in 701 BCE and the destruction of Stratum II by Nebu- chadnezzar during one of the invasions of the Phil- istine coastal plain between 605 and 603 BCE. Both of these events have been detected at other sites in the Shephelah as well. At Lachish, the destructions of Levels III and II were securely dated by Tufnell, Aharoni and Ussishkin to 701 and 586 BCE respectively (Ussishkin 1977: 50-54). The finds from our Stratum III, especially the sealed LMLK jars, can be correlated with Lachish Level III, indi- cating that our Stratum III was also destroyed in 701 BCE by Sennacherib. This is corroborated by the mention of Timnah in Sennacherib's annals. This invasion caused many other destructions in the Shephelah, such as those of Tell Beit Mirsim Stratum A and Tel Beth Shemesh Stratum lib (Bunimovitz and Lederman 1997: 30). Dagan's thorough survey of the Shephelah revealed a considerable decline in the settlement of this region following this invasion and throughout the 7th century (Dagan 1992: 259- 262). The destruction of our Stratum II corresponds to the violent destruction of Tel Miqne-Ekron Stratum IB by the Babylonians between 605 and 603 BCE. The nature of the destruction as well as that of the pottery and other artifacts at the two sites are very similar, pointing to a simultaneous conquest of these neighboring sites. Thus, these two dates can be established to a large degree of certainty. However, all other dates relating to our strata remain enigmatic to some extent. These include the termination of Stratum IV and the construction dates of all three strata (IV-II). THE PROBLEM OF DATING STRATUM IV The chronology of Stratum IV is the most debatable in light of the controversy over the chronology of the Iron Age I-IIA in Israel (Finkelstein 1995, 1996, 1998; Mazar 1997; Ben-Tor and Ben-Ami 1998). The crux of the problem is the lack of any secure chronological anchor. The closest such points are on one hand the destruction of Stratum III in 701 BCE, and on the other the dates of the earlier strata, which are also the subject of discussion and debate. Our 273</page><page sequence="282">Stratum VI, the last Late Bronze Age level, contains Mycenaean pottery but includes only a few imported Cypriot sherds. It thus recalls Level VI at Lachish and should be dated to the late 13th/early 12th cen- turies. Stratum V demonstrates a typical Iron Age I material culture, similar to that of Gezer Strata XIII- X, Tel Miqne Strata VI-V and Beth Shemesh Stratum III. A considerable amount of Philistine Bichrome ware is found in Stratum V, though the quantity and quality are less than that of Tel Miqne (the finds from Strata VI-V will be discussed in detail in Timnah III ; at present, see Keim and Mazar 1995: 103 for a selection of pottery from Stratum V). Red slip starts to appear in Stratum V in small quantities (Mazar 1998), but hand burnish is still entirely lacking. Stratum V includes only one major architectural phase ( Timnah I: 79-80), though in the streets and open areas we detected several phases of floor raising, ovens and pits. It is impossible to extend the duration of this level over 150 years, and thus a date in the 11th century for Stratum V is plausible.1 A short, scanty transitional phase, denoted IVB, is characterized by a few pits and floor levels lower than the main Stratum IV in several places; these loci contained a few specific pottery types that can be defined as transitional Iron Age I/II. These include red-slipped vessels that usually lacked hand burnish, feeding bottles and bell-shaped bowls and kraters with degenerate horizontal handles that can be defined as the last phase of Philistine pottery. In the main phase of Stratum IV, the town was rebuilt according to a new layout lacking any archi- tectural continuity from the earlier period. Aside from a few pottery types that continued, new forms appeared and the surface treatment of the pottery changed completely. The painted decoration of Stratum V in both the Canaanite and Philistine tra- ditions gave way to red-slipped and hand-burnished pottery. In fact, this can be defined as the sharpest transition in pottery treatment techniques in the entire stratigraphie sequence at Tel Batash. The strati- graphic data from Stratum IV indicate a com- paratively short life span for this level: the buildings are not substantial and there are very few cases of architectural alterations and floor raisings; the accu- mulation of debris is no more than about 0.5 m. Some of the structures of Stratum III were con- structed directly on top of those of Stratum IV, yet there is virtually no architectural continuity of plan between them, except perhaps in the incorporation of the Stratum IV gate structure into the new gate of Stratum III. On the other hand, as the pottery dis- cussion shows, there was a small degree of con- tinuity between Strata IV and III in certain forms, though in variable proportions. The assemblage of Stratum IV can be compared to those of Lachish Levels V-IV, Tell Beit Mirsim Stratum B3, Beth Shemesh Stratum IIa, Gezer Stra- tum VIII, Tell Qasile Strata IX-VIII, Beer Sheba Strata VIII-VI, Arad Strata XII-XI and the Negev highlands sites. All these strata were dated by their excavators to the 10th century, since they represent the assemblage that succeeds the painted pottery tradition of the Iron Age I. The definition of the 9th century in Judah and Philistia is based on a few sites where there is a continuous stratigraphie sequence, such as Jerusalem (City of David), Lachish, Gezer, Arad and Beer-sheba. The problem is that much of the material is unpublished (Beer-sheba, Jerusalem), published only in preliminary reports (Arad), or fully published but comprising too small a sample (Gezer). Thus, the definition of the 9th century pottery assemblage in the south remains enigmatic. Two important exceptions are Lachish and Kuntillet 'Ajrud. Zimhoni's study of the pottery from Lachish Levels V-IV (Zimhoni 1997: 57-178) shows the large degree of continuity in the pottery of these two strata. In fact, it appears that the single floor of Level V in Area S and the four superimposed floor surfaces of Level IV constitute five continuous stratigraphie phases. These are succeeded by Level III of the 8th century, with an intermediate isolated group (Locus 4421) dated relatively by Zimhoni to the transition from Levels IV to III. The pottery of our Stratum IV is similar to the Levels V-IV assemblage from Lachish. At Lachish, as at all other sites from this period in Judah, we lack any chronological anchor apart from general considerations of relative chro- nology and stratigraphy. Indeed, Zimhoni empha- sized the difficulty of dating Level V and did not offer any final conclusion. As for Level IV, she maintained that this level existed during the second half of the 9th century and continued until its destruction by the earthquake during the time of Uzziah, some time between 785 and 748 BCE (Zimhoni 1997: 172-174). This low date for the end of Lachish Level IV does not seem plausible to us, on the basis of comparison to other sites, mainly Arad and Kuntillet 'Ajrud. At Arad, three strata (X- VIII) contain identical pottery, which is similar to Lachish Level III. At Beer-sheba, both Strata III and II contain the same pottery repertoire (though little of 274</page><page sequence="283">Table 55.

If we extend the assemblage of Lachish IV until the time of Uzziah as suggested by Zimhoni, we are left with only 50-80 years for the transition to the Level III assemblage and its appearance in three levels at Arad and per- haps two levels at Beer-sheba. Moreover, the assemblage of Kuntillet 'Ajrud should be taken into consideration. This assemblage is definitely earlier than that of the Lachish Level III assemblage (as well as Arad X-VIII). It was justifiably dated by Meshel and Ayalon to ca. 800 BCE on the basis of an extensive comparative discussion of the pottery, paleography and 14C dates ('Ajrud: 196-199; Segal 1995). On typological grounds, the 'Ajrud assem- blage appears to be transitional between Lachish Levels IV and III: it is certainly later than Lachish Level IV and Tel Batash Stratum IV. Thus, in our view, Lachish Level IV terminated at some time in the second half of the 9th century. Its four sub-phases and Level V can easily be extended to cover a cen- tury or so, thus starting Level V at some time in the 10th century. The transitional group of Locus 4421 at Lachish should be dated to the beginning of the 8th century. Though Zimhoni indeed attributed this group typologically to the transition between Levels IV and III at Lachish, her suggestion of absolute dating for this assemblage appears to be too low. Most of the published pottery from Level V at Lachish comes from the constructional fills of the podium of Palace A, from the few floors in Area S and from the small cultic room excavated by Aharoni (Lachish V: 26-32). Most scholars have dated this level to the 10th century, and we tend to retain this date. Lowering the date of Level V to the 9th cen- tury, as hinted at by Zimhoni and suggested by Finkelstein, would condense into this century all five floor levels found in Lachish Area S, the only area where clear and secure stratigraphy was obtained. This is not feasible in our view. The continuity at Lachish between Levels V and IV with all its sub-phases indicates the long duration of the pottery assemblages in Judah. In fact, on the basis of comparison with the relative chronology at other sites in the region such as Tell Beit Mirsim and Beth Shemesh, the assemblage of Levels V-IV at Lachish must fill the period between the end of Philistine Bichrome pottery and the transitional group of Locus 4421. At Tel Batash, this horizon of Lachish Levels V-IV is filled only by the relatively thin occupation layer of Stratum IV. Thus, assuming that Lachish Levels V-IV covered the 10th-9th centuries, then Batash Stratum IV must have existed at some time during this long period. The estimated short duration of this stratum leads us to assume that there must have been a gap in occupation either in the 10th century (between our Strata V and IV) or in the 9th century (between Strata IV and III). It is not easy to choose between these two alternatives, as there are data that support each of them. A date in the 10th century for Stratum IV (and thus a gap in the 9th century) is supported by the continuity in the pottery from the few pits and floors of Phase IVB into main Stratum IV, as well as the continuation of certain pottery types from Stratum V (e.g. our CP 15 and S J 21). Notable too is the comparison of both typology and surface treatment (mainly hand burnish on red slip) to the material from strata traditionally dated to the 10th century. Alternatively, a date in the 9th century for Batash Stratum IV (and a possible gap in the 10th century) may be claimed on the basis of some degree of continuity between the assemb- lages of Strata IV and III. Though the general 275</page><page sequence="284">appearance of these two assemblages differs to a large extent, there are still typological resemblances and continuity in several forms. However, a date in the 10th century for Stratum IV and a gap in the 9th century appear more plausible.2 Several sites in the coastal plain and along its margins should also be mentioned. At Tel Miqne, Stratum IV is the last Iron Age level in the lower mound before it was abandoned until the 7th century. Its pottery is not yet published, though preliminary reports describe it as containing "red slip with hand burnish, debased Philistine forms and Egyptian XXI Dynasty objects"; its excavators date it to the "late llth-early 10th century" (Dothan 1995: 59). It appears that Stratum IV at Tel Batash is either con- temporary with or somewhat later than Tel Miqne Stratum IV. At Tell Qasile, Strata IX-VIII contain pottery that is very similar to that of Tel Batash Stratum IV. These two strata at Qasile were dated to the 10th century (Mazar 1985b: 127-128). The con- tinuity in the pottery industry from the 10th to the 9th century may indicate that Stratum VIII could have extended into the 9th century, though this cannot be proved or disproved. At Gezer, the 10th century horizon was excavated in Field III, which as yet is published only very partially (Holladay 1990). The resemblance between the pottery related to the six- chambered gate structure at Gezer and that of Stratum IV at our site indicates contemporaneity between the two. In Gezer Field VII, local Strata 8, 7B and 7A (general Strata IX-VIII), dated to the 10th century, include a sherd collection that shows great similarity to our Stratum IV pottery ( Gezer III : Pis. 7-10). The continuity into the 9th century is demonstrated by the small amount of pottery from the following local Stratum 6B (general Stratum VII) (ibid.: Pis. 1 1:7- 15:10), though this later level includes some new types that continue into the 8th century. Thus Tel Batash Stratum IV, Gezer Strata IX-VIII, Beth She- mesh Stratum Ha and Tell Qasile Strata IX-VIII belong to the same horizon. Ashdod Stratum X, a type site for the 10th century in Philistia proper, is also characterized by dark red slip and hand burnish. Though there are marked similarities between Ash- dod Stratum X and Tel Batash Stratum IV, there are also differences in some pottery forms and in the abundance of black painted decoration on red slip ("Ashdod Ware") at Ashdod. The latter is relatively rare at Tel Batash as well as at Gezer and Tell Qasile, indicating an independent industry at Ashdod that replaced the Philistine Bichrome pottery. There are very few additional southern sites in which stratigraphie continuity between the 10th and the 8th centuries was observed, and the pottery has been adequately published to enable the study of the typological sequence. However, the evidence from Lachish and Arad, and to some extent Gezer and Beer-sheba, is a clear indication of the long duration and conservative nature of the pottery during this period. The short-lived sites excavated by Cohen and Meshel in the Negev highlands contained a pottery assemblage that is important for our discussion as well, since it is very homogeneous and close to that of our Stratum IV (Cohen 1986: Pis. 79-138). Thus, these sites can be dated to the 10th century. The continuity in some of the forms between Stratum IV and Stratum III may appear to contradict the existence of an occupation gap in the 9th century. However, long-lived continuity in pottery typology is in fact found in virtually all the pottery assemblages of the Iron Age II; in each region the pace of change in pottery typology and surface treatment was rela- tively slow. Moreover, the types that do continue into the later stratum differ in their proportions. Thus, the similarities between Stratum IV and Stratum III should not surprise us, even if the span of these strata together was ca. 250 years and there was an occu- pation gap between the two. The long duration of the regional pottery industries during the 10th-9th cen- turies can be observed in the northern valleys too, where the similarity between the pottery of Strata VB and VA-IVB at Megiddo, Jezreel and Tel Rehov VI-IV do not necessarily indicate contemporaneity (as Finkelstein maintains, following Zimhoni), but rather a continuity between the second half of the 10th century and the mid-9th century (Mazar 1997). A large pottery assemblage recently discovered at Tel Safit (Tell es-Safi) resembles the assemblage of Kuntillet 'Ajrud in its composition: forms that are typical of assemblages traditionally dated to the 10th century appear alongside forms traditionally dated to the 8th century. This mixture of forms is typical of the 9th century. Tell es-Safi will be a key for defining the 9th century in the Shephelah (our thanks to A. Maeir for showing us the pottery). THE FOUNDATION DATE AND DURATION OF STRATA III AND II Though the destruction dates of Strata III and II can securely be determined as 701 and 605-603 BCE 276</page><page sequence="285">respectively (see above), the construction date of each of these strata is open to speculation. The rel- ative lack of floor resurfacings and subsidiary con- struction phases in both these strata indicates a rather short time for their existence. On the other hand, the fact that the people of Stratum II utilized the same town plan and continued to develop the fortification system of the previous level indicates that there was not a great lapse of time between the end of Stratum III and the reconstruction of the city in Stratum II. The foundation dates of both Strata III and II can thus be established only on the basis of assumptions and general evaluations. We would tend to claim that the building of the well-fortified and planned city of Stratum III occurred at some time during the early 8th century (see below), while Stratum II, which was a rebuilding of the partly ruined Stratum III, was constructed during the first half of the 7th century. B. GEOPOLITICS AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL FINDS AND THE TEXTUAL EVIDENCE A discussion of the archaeological material presented in this volume must include a broader view of the northern Shephelah and the inner coastal plain. This is now possible due to several excavations and sur- veys that have been conducted in the region. These include the sites of Gezer (excavated by W.G. Dever and J. Seger between 1964 and 1972 and in 1982- 1984); Tel Miqne (biblical Ekron) led by S. Gitin and T. Dothan between 1981 and 1997; Beth Shemesh (excavations resumed by S. Bunimovitz and Z. Lederman in 1990); and surveys of the Shephelah by Y. Dagan and of the Sorek Valley by Hebrew Uni- versity survey teams (A. Mazar, Z. Kallai, N. Appl- baum). Some of these issues were addressed in earlier publications (Keim and Mazar 1982; 1985; 1989; 1990; Mazar 1994; Gitin 1989; Bunimovitz and Lederman 1997). In the following discussion, we will examine aspects of regionalism and geopolitics, combining archaeological, biblical and extrabiblical data. Throughout the Iron Age, Timnah appears to have been a border town between Philistine and Israelite territories. As such, it was influenced by both regions. A major question is that of its affiliation during each of its occupation periods. It appears that during the Iron Age I, Timnah was a town in the territory of the large Philistine city-state of Ekron. This is evidenced by the relative size of the two sites (Ekron was 50 acres at this time, Timnah about 6 acres), the distance between them (7 km), the con- venient route along the Sorek Valley, and the mate- rial culture, including elements of diet (such as pig consumption, see Hesse 1990; Hesse and Wapnish: 1997: 248). This archaeological evidence fits the biblical description of Timnah as a Philistine town (the Iron Age I at Tel Batash will be discussed in Timnah ///; at present see Mazar 1994; Keim and Mazar 1995: 91-104). THE 10TH CENTURY (STRATUM IV) Stratum IV represents a rebuilding of the town fol- lowing the end of the Philistine city of Stratum V. As mentioned above, the material culture of this new town differs from its predecessor in many aspects. The pottery industry is characterized by red slip and hand burnish. These features signify the transition from the 11th to the 10th century in the Judean hills, the Shephelah, the northern Negev, and to some extent in the northern valleys (Jezreel and Beth Shean). The predominance of this new technique of surface treatment at a series of sites like Tell Beit Mirsim Stratum B3, Beth Shemesh Stratum IIa, Gezer Stratum VIII, Lachish Level V and Tell Qasile Strata IX-VIII, as well as northern sites like Megiddo Strata VA-IVB, Taanach Period IIA, Yoqne'am Stratum XIV, Beth Shean Stratum SI (Lower V) and Tel Rehov Stratum VI, calls for the linkage of this new tradition with the rise of the Israelite state. True, the correlation of ceramic traditions with ethnic or geopolitical units is a highly controversial issue, particularly when it is based on association with the biblical text. Nevertheless, it appears to us that a correlation between the rise of the Israelite state and the shift in the material culture is justified. Note the different tradition that developed during this time in the main cities of Philistia, like Ashdod. We thus suggest that Stratum IV was an Israelite town, belonging to the emerging Israelite state. The town of this period included modest dwell- ings with large open spaces between them. The town was probably defended by the outer walls of houses constructed along the perimeter of the mound, and there was no real city wall. The entrance to the town, however, was probably through a gate with an L- shaped facade and two solid towers. Similar traits indicating the slow growth of urban life can be observed at many 10th century Israelite sites such as those mentioned above as well as Tel Beer-sheba 277</page><page sequence="286">Strata VII-VI and northern sites like Megiddo Stra- tum VB and Hazor Stratum X, while other 10th century cities (such as Megiddo Strata VA-IVB, Yoqne'am XIV, Tel Rehov Stratum VI) show a sig- nificant development of urban life, including advanced central planning, sophisticated architecture and fortifications. In contrast to the above-mentioned sites, the excavations at Tel Miqne-Ekron show that at some time in the early or mid- 10th century (the end of Stratum IV), the large lower city was abandoned and the city shrank from an area of ca. 50 acres to 7-10 acres (Gitin 1989: 25). Only in the 7th century did Ekron return to its original size. This phenomenon, though difficult to explain, may have been the result of one of two factors: the rise of the Israelite king- dom of David and Solomon, which may have caused tensions in the border zone and adversely affected Ekron's economy (Gitin 1989: 41) or, though less plausibly in our opinion, the presumed Egyptian raid in Siamun's reign, which according to some scholars resulted in the conquest of Gezer and its presentation to Solomon as a dowry gift (1 Kings 9:16). Kitchen (1973: 280-281; 1997: 117-118), dates Siamun's assumed raid on Philistia and the conquest of Gezer to the beginning of Solomon's reign, ca. 970-960 BCE. However, several scholars deny the historicity of Siamun's supposed invasion of the Land of Israel (Redford 1992: 310-311; Knaupf 1997: 94). In contrast to Ekron, Ashdod grew from 20 to 50 acres during the 10th century (. NEAEHL : 93, 98). M. Dothan dated the growth of the city to the mid- 11th century on the basis of the Philistine Bichrome ware found in pits in Area M (Stratum XB), yet the finds from this period are very scanty. The actual growth of the city seems to have taken place when the for- tifications of Stratum XA were constructed. This stratum was dated by Dothan and Porath {Ashdod IV: 52-56) to the first half of the 10th century and its destruction was tentatively attributed to Siamun. The pottery from this stratum (ibid.: 115-119) can be dated to the entire 10th century. It can thus be argued that Ashdod grew at the expense of Ekron and that Israelite oppression caused many of Ekron's inhab- itants to move to Ashdod, a process that resulted in the decline of Ekron and the growth of Ashdod. The construction of Timnah Stratum IV at a time when Ekron was in a state of decline can thus be explained as related to the Israelite expansion. Three geographical sources in the Bible concern this period: the list of Solomon's districts (1 Kings 4), the town list of Dan (Josh. 19:40^46) and the description of the northern border of Judah (see Timnah I: 6-9). The short inscription incised on a bowl rim before firing mentioning "[so]n of Hanan" (above, pp. 190-191) might refer to a family of Hanan related also to the town Elon-beth-hanan, mentioned in Solomon's Second District (1 Kings 4:9). The discovery of the name Hanan in a 10th century inscription at Beth Shemesh supports this idea (Bunimovitz and Lederman 1997: 29-30). Israel seems to have controlled the entire territory covered by the town list of Dan (Josh. 19:40-46) only during the United Monarchy and perhaps also during the time of Josiah. Many scholars date the list to the United Monarchy and presume that it reflects David's conquests in this region, which was pre- viously ruled by the Philistines and the "Amorites" (Kallai 1958: 144-148; 1960: 27-28; Mazar 1960: 65-77; revised in Mazar 1986: 104-112; Y. Aharoni 1976: 7; 1979: 298-299; de Vaux 1978: 777; Na'a- man 1986a: 75-79, 107-117). Only a few scholars date the list to the reign of Josiah (Whitelam 1992: 11). The relationship between this list and Solomon's second district mentioned in 1 Kings 4:9 has been pointed out by several scholars. While B. Mazar suggested that Solomon's second district corre- sponded only to the eastern part of the allotment of Dan, namely the eastern Sorek Valley and the Valley of Ajalon (Mazar 1960), Aharoni, Kallai and Na'a- man suggested that the district included the entire allotment of Dan (Wright 1967: 64*-65*; Y. Aharoni 1976: 6-10; Kallai 1986: 49; Na'aman 1986a: 114- 116). In the town list of Dan, Timnah is mentioned in the form Timnatah (Josh. 19:43) and appears between Elon and Ekron, after the more easterly cities of Zorah, Eshtaol, Beth-shemesh, Shaalbim and Yitlah. The appearance of Ekron in this list is problematic, since the city was never conquered by Israel. We are inclined to accept Aharoni' s sugges- tion that the original text read "Timnath Ekron," in order to distinguish it from other towns named Timnah (Y. Aharoni 1979: 299). The affiliation originated, in his opinion, at the time of David, shortly after Timnah ceased to be a Philistine town of the kingdom of Ekron. This would agree with the archaeological evidence at Ekron, which shows that it lost much of its power during the 10th century. Shishak's invasion in 925 BCE may have caused destructions in this region as he passed on his way from the coastal plain to the hill country through 278</page><page sequence="287">Rubute, Ajalon, Beth-horon, K-r-t-m (Kirjath- jearim?) and Gibeon. No city in the region of the Sorek Valley is mentioned in Shishak's list of con- quered cities at Karnak, and even the mention of Gezer is disputed (Kitchen 1973: 432^47 against Y. Aharoni 1979: 325-326; Mazar 1986). Thus, there is no direct evidence for the cause of the end of Stratum IV. It could have been an outcome of Shishak's invasion or of the division of the kingdom and loss of Israelite territories in the northwestern Shephelah, or some other reason that escapes us. In any case, there is no evidence for violent destruction of this town. According to 2 Chr. 11:3-11, Rehoboam's west- ernmost fortified towns were Azekah, Adullam, Zorah and Ajalon, located in the eastern Shephelah, leaving Timnah in Philistine territory. However many scholars claim that this list does not reflect historical reality. Even if it does, it probably was not intended to mark the external border of the kingdom, which might have been slightly further to the west (Kallai 1971 : 253 places Timnah within the border of Rehoboam's kingdom). If this list has any historical value, it may reflect a situation when Timnah was uninhabited and its territory left outside the borders of Judah, perhaps during the 9th century. THE 8TH CENTURY (STRATUM III) Stratum III indicates a new era in the history of the city: a massive fortification system was constructed, including a monumental gate, public buildings and a large piazza next to the gate. This large-scale con- struction seems to follow an occupation gap that lasted from the termination of Stratum IV until some time early in the 8th century. The material culture revealed in Stratum III is a combination of Judean and coastal elements. The stone architecture, employing large limestone boulders and square monoliths and the design of the gate structure (mainly the outer gate) find close parallels at Judean sites in the Shephelah, though they are also known at nearby Tel Miqne-Ekron (Timnah /: 255-259). The study of the pottery rep- ertoire from Stratum III has shown that alongside a limited number of Judean types, there is an almost equal number of forms that appear to be coastal. However, it should be noted that the typical "Ashdod Ware" (red-slipped vessels with black decoration) is entirely absent from our site in Stratum III, though it is quite common at Ashdod at that time. It thus appears that the pottery repertoire of Stratum III signifies a regional variation, perhaps typical of the region of Ekron. Though this situation is well attes- ted in the 7th century (see below), the problem is that 8th century Ekron is hardly known. The three molds for producing nude female figurines found in this stratum (above, pp. 203-208) are also foreign to Judah and are related to coastal or Phoenician tra- ditions. The exception is the numerous LMLK jars and seal impressions found in Area D Building 737, which apparently have a special significance in the history of our site (below). The biblical and extrabiblical sources concerning Timnah should now be dealt with in light of the archaeological data. Two verses in 2 Chr. (26: 6 and 28: 18) are relevant to the fate of this region in the 8th century. However, since the historical reliability of Chronicles is suspect, each has to be examined against archaeological or other relevant sources (Na'aman 1991: 24, note 23 for appropriate liter- ature). 2 Chr. 26:6 relates that Uzziah broke down the city walls of Gath, Jabneh and Ashdod and that he "built cities in the territory of Ashdod and else- where among the Philistines." This description appears exaggerated, but even so may provide evi- dence of some territorial expansion of Judah west- wards during Uzziah's reign. According to such a scenario, Judah annexed the region of the lower Sorek Valley and built Timnah as a fortified city on its western border. This may have been possible thanks to the weakness of Ekron between the mid- 10th and early 7th centuries (Gitin 1989a: 41; Y. Aharoni 1979: 345 suggested that Uzziah controlled Ekron, though this is less plausible). 2 Chr. 28: 1 8 records that during the reign of Ahaz, the Philistines took the towns of Beth-shemesh, Ajalon, Gederoth, Sochoh, Timnah and Gimzo from Judah, and settled them. In this case, too, the his- toricity of the narrative is suspect. It is not clear which group of Philistines carried out this extensive conquest, since Ekron was still a rather small city at this time. If such a military campaign took place, it may have been carried out by a united force of Philistines who came from Ekron, Gath, Ashdod and perhaps Ashkelon. The only archaeological indica- tion of the historical validity of this source comes from Timnah. Indeed, as we have mentioned before, a relatively large part of the pottery found in the destruction layer of Stratum III that was destroyed by Sennacherib is coastal in type. It thus may perhaps be assumed that in the time between the reign of Ahaz and 701 BCE, Timnah was captured and inhabited by 279</page><page sequence="288">Philistines, in accord with 2 Chr. 28. Accepting 2 Chr. 28:18 as a reliable source, Kallai used it as a major argument in favor of dating the town list of Judah (Josh. 15:21-62) to the reign of Hezekiah; according to his argument, Timnah and Beth-she- mesh were not mentioned in the list of Judean cities because they were under Philistine control at the time (Kallai 1986: 374). However, the date of the town list of Judah is disputed and a date in Josiah's reign appears to be more plausible (Na'aman 1991: 13-33). The invasion of Judah by Sennacherib during Hezekiah' s reign was a major event in the history of the region. It started with the occupation of the ter- ritories of Ashkelon in the Yarkon region and a clash with Egyptian troops at Eltekeh. Sennacherib then moved against Ekron, which was under Hezekiah's control. The conquest of Timnah preceded the cap- ture of Ekron. The annals report: "...I besieged Eltekeh and Timnah ( Ta-am-na-a ), conquered (them) and carried their spoils away. I assaulted Ekron..." (Pritchard 1958: 287-288). The mention of the con- quest of Timnah in the context of the war against Ekron emphasizes the relationship between the two. Direct evidence of the confrontation with Assyria was found in Building 737 in Area D of our exca- vations, which apparently served as a storehouse or barracks. The ca. 33 LMLK jars and stamped handles with Judean royal seal impressions are clear evidence for the presence of a Judean royal stronghold in the town. As at Lachish Level III, both four-winged and two-winged symbols were found in the same context (compare Ussishkin 1977). One handle was marked with the seal of an official, Sapan (son of) 'Abima'as, whose seal impressions have also been found at Jerusalem and Azekah. The context at Timnah ena- bles us to examine several aspects of the use of LMLK jars, such as the proportion between stamped and unstamped handles. Only a few of the handles in this assemblage were stamped; the others remained unstamped and only one stamp of an official was found in the entire assemblage (see p. 194). Such groups of jars were probably produced, sealed and used in the framework of Hezekiah's preparations for the war against Sennacherib (Na'aman 1979; 1986a; Mazar 1984: 47^48). They probably contained food for the troops and are consequently found mainly in the northern Shephelah and in the Jerusalem area, where the war against Sennacherib took place. The fragments of several dozen clay "scoops" found in this building probably indicate activities like filling and emptying baskets or sacks containing wheat. The storeroom at Timnah may thus have been part of a barracks used by Hezekiah's troops in 701 BCE. However, while at other Judean sites LMLK jars appear as part of the Judean material culture assemblage, in Timnah Stratum III about a third of the pottery found in other parts of the town is typical of the coastal plain and another third is Judean in type. As we have seen, the finds from Stratum III show an interesting combination of cultural traits. The following scenario may be suggested: the city was founded as a border town by Judah during the time of Uzziah and was surrounded by an elaborate fortification system on royal initiative. It was perhaps captured by the Philistines during the time of Ahaz. They brought with them their own pottery traditions and other components of material culture. Shortly before the war against Sennacherib, Hezekiah, who forced Ekron to join him, sent troops to Timnah. These brought with them LMLK- type jars containing their rations. The Judean garrison stayed at Timnah for only a short time before the campaign of 701 BCE, during which the population of the city did not change. The conquest of Timnah by Sennacherib led to the destruction of many buildings, such as the inner gate, the public complex south of the gate and the LMLK Jars Building 737. However, most of the city wall and the monumental outer gate were probably not destroyed and continued in use when the town was rebuilt during the 7th century. The impact of Sennacherib's invasion at Ekron is not yet known. From the Assyrian documents one learns that the city was captured without a violent battle, and consequently a destruction level should not be expected. Beth-shemesh, however, like many other Judean cities in the Shephelah, was probably destroyed by Sennacherib and remained virtually unsettled during the 7th century, since no actual occupation layer of this period was found there (Bunimovitz and Lederman 1997: 30, 37; see note 4). The fate of Gezer at this time is not clear. As part of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, it was conquered by the Assyrians in 722 BCE together with the rest of this kingdom. However, a good number of LMLK seal impressions were found there by Macalister, and complete jars (though unstamped) were found in Stratum VI of the Hebrew Union College excava- tions ( Gezer III : Pis. 15:11; 16:2).3 The finds of LMLK seal impressions and jars at Gezer may indi- cate that Hezekiah took over the city just before the war of 701 BCE and, as at Timnah, turned it into a 280</page><page sequence="289">border stronghold. Such an action is logical in light of the strategic location of Gezer; the Gezer-Timnah line makes sense as a fortified border intended to protect Judah from the invading Assyrians. THE 7TH CENTURY (STRATUM II) Stratum II represents a relatively rapid recovery of the city after the Assyrian conquest of 701 BCE and a period of economic prosperity that lasted until the Babylonian conquest. The recovery of Timnah and the flourishing of Ekron in the 7th century stand in contrast to the situation in the Judean Shephelah, where rehabil- itation after the widespread destruction caused by Sennacherib's invasion was slow and erratic. In our region, Beth-shemesh declined4 and other towns of the Shephelah stood in ruins. Dagan's survey of the Shephelah points to a major decline in settlement during the 7th century (above, p. 273). Further to the north, Gezer, which had been part of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, was perhaps taken over for a while by Hezekiah before the war of 701 BCE (see above). Later, during the first half of the 7th century (the period known as Pax Assyriaca until ca. 630 BCE), it became an Assyrian administrative center, as indicated by two Assyrian documents and various Assyrian objects found there (Brandl and Reich 1985). Under Assyrian supreme control, Ekron flourished during the 7th century and became a dominant economic power. During this period, Ekron (Stratum IC) expanded to its original area of over 50 acres; industrial areas were constructed even beyond the limit of the lower mound, increasing the hold of the city to about 70 acres. More than a hundred olive presses found close to the topsoil provide evidence of a thriving industry of olive oil production, based on the olive groves that probably covered the region (Gitin 1989a, 1995, 1996, 1997). Two Assyrian references mention Ekron as one of the major city-states of the region (Gitin 1989a: 43). Gitin suggests that Ekron was one of the most important production centers of olive oil in the entire Near East, functioning, in his view, in the framework of the planned and centralized Assyrian imperial economy. Ekron's growth and flourishing began during the Pax Assyriaca (Stratum IC) and continued after the end of the Assyrian presence (ca. 630 BCE) until the Babylonian conquest (605-603 BCE) (Stratum IB). In this phase, the oil industry declined to some extent, as shown by the fact that some of the oil presses went out of use. In relation to this subject, we should mention the strong evidence for oil pro- duction in similar oil presses at Judean sites in the Shephelah that were destroyed by Sennacherib, like Tell Beit Mirsim and Beth Shemesh (for the latter see Bunimovitz and Lederman 1997: 30). We suggest that the technology and industry of oil production (which must have been accompanied by extensive olive groves that apparently were not entirely destroyed during Sennacherib's campaign) was taken over by the Philistines after the widespread destruc- tion of the Judean Shephelah in 701 BCE. This was perhaps the reason for the unusual expansion and growth of Ekron. The construction and flourishing of Timnah Stratum II during the 7th century appears to have taken place in the shadow of Ekron. It seems that Timnah was a town in the kingdom of Ekron during much of this period, though the situation might have changed after the rise of Josiah (see below). Timnah Stratum II looks like a miniature version of Ekron: the architecture is very similar, and two of the five buildings excavated contained olive oil presses similar to those at Ekron. The oil industry at Timnah appears to have been related and subsidiary to that of Ekron. A major part of the ceramic assemblage from Timnah Stratum II is identical to that of Stratum IB at Ekron. There is some difference between the two, however, as shown by the com- parative analysis. At Ekron, only 7% of the forms were defined as Judean and 9% were defined as "southern," namely forms that are common to both Judah and the coast (Gitin 1987: 91). In our analysis of the pottery of Building 743 at Timnah (Keim and Mazar 1985: 108-116), 26% of the assemblage was defined as Judean and 54% as "late Philistine" or "Ekronite." Among the Judean forms at Timnah were the two types of Judean cooking pots typical of the period, as well as the thickened-rim bowl, storage jars of the LMLK and rosette types, and the small bag-shaped jar. The six jar handles stamped with the Judean rosette seal, which was probably a Judean royal seal (Cahill, above pp. 197-201); disputed by Kletter 1999: 37), are of special significance, since such seal impressions are lacking at Tel Miqne-Ekron (apart from one doubtful example). Seven marked Judean dome-shaped stone weights were found at Timnah. Only a few weights of this type have been found in Philistia (at Ekron and Ashdod; Kletter 1999: 32-34). A Judean pillar figurine was also found. All these attributes indicate the strong rela- 281</page><page sequence="290">tionship of Timnah with Judah during the late 7th century. Small quantities of Phoenician, Trans- jordanian and Greek pottery show that the town may have had its own trade connections, though such special vessels could have also been traded through Ekron. Timnah's identity as a Judean or Ekronite town is crucial in the debate over the extent of Josiah's kingdom. Since A. Alt's study (1925), most scholars have agreed that Josiah gained control over large parts of Cisjordan, including parts of the coastal plain. This assumption gained considerable support from the discovery of Hebrew ostraca at Mesad Hashavyahu (see, among others, Bright 1972: 317; Y. Aharoni 1979: 403; Reviv 1979: 203-204). It is agreed, however, that Ekron remained independent. According to this theory, Josiah controlled only a corridor north of Ekron, including the entire Sorek Valley and the coast near Mesad Hashavyahu - a boundary that fits the description of the northern border of Judah in Josh. 15:10-12 (though it would be the southern border of the kingdom, if such a "corridor" indeed existed). In contrast to this view, Na'aman suggested that Josiah's kingdom was limited to the territory listed in the town lists of Judah and Benjamin in Josh. 15:20-62 and 18:21-28. In his view, the region of Timnah as well as the entire coastal plain were outside Josiah's kingdom and Mesad Hashavyahu has nothing to do with Judean control over the coast, despite the Hebrew ostraca found there (Na'aman 1989: 44-51; see also Kletter 1999: 40^3). A clear-cut decision as to Timnah's affiliation would be of great importance in this debate: if it could be proved archaeologically that Timnah was a Judean town during Josiah's reign, this would sup- port an extension of Josiah's territory to the coast. Unfortunately, we cannot offer a definite answer to this question. In a previous discussion it was argued that during Josiah's reign Timnah was probably part of the kingdom of Judah, though many of its inhabitants may have been of local "late Philistine" origin (Mazar 1985: 321; Keim and Mazar 1985: 118). It can now be suggested that the rebuilding of the town during the 7th century and the establish- ment of the oil industry at Timnah occurred before Josiah's reign, while Timnah was under the control of Ekron and within its sphere of influence. This is supported by the general similarity of the material culture of Timnah to that of Ekron and the fact that olive oil production at Timnah is very similar and was probably related to the industry at Ekron. Nev- ertheless, the question of the fate of Timnah during Josiah's time remains, in our view, open. One pos- sibility is that the town remained part of the territory of the city-state of Ekron until its conquest by the Babylonians (thus Na'aman 1991: 49). However, it can also be conjectured that Josiah annexed Timnah and the territory to its west. Such an annexation need not have resulted in a population turnover, and it may well be that the local inhabitants stayed in the town. This would explain the nature of the finds in the destruction level of Stratum II at Timnah, where an "Ekronite" pottery assemblage is mixed with many Judean components, such as rosette seal impressions, LMLK jars, Judean weights, a pillar figurine and a number of pottery forms. Most of these are missing at Tel Miqne. We raise this as a possibility, without providing a definite answer (for a general discussion of the equation between material culture and political borders see Kletter 1999). Both Timnah and Ekron were destroyed by a severe fire, most probably in the Babylonian inva- sion between ca. 605 and 603 BCE. The destruction of Ashkelon by fire (Stager 1996) is another result of these devastating Babylonian conquests. In each of the excavation areas of Stratum II at Timnah, clear evidence of the Babylonian destruction was found. In Areas D, E and F, the massive conflagration resulted in destruction debris over one meter deep. Following the violent destruction of both Ekron and Timnah, there was a short period of revival at Ekron, though probably only a few scattered houses existed in this phase (Stratum IA). At Timnah evi- dence for post-destruction activity was found in only one place, in the form of an agricultural installation constructed above the destruction level of Stratum II ( Timnah 1 : 205). This was a brief phase and may indicate that a few farmers lived in the ruined town for a short while in the early 6th century (compare 2 Kings 25:12; Jer. 52:16). The combined data from the excavations in the northern Shephelah and Ekron thus enable us to link the archaeological finds in the region with the bib- lical, historical and geographical sources into a comprehensive picture, though some crucial ques- tions still remain to be answered. THE PERSIAN PERIOD (STRATUM I) The remains from the Persian period are insignificant and comprise mainly refuse pits and scanty archi- 282</page><page sequence="291">tectural remains. It appears that at this time there were only a few houses on the mound. During this period, the site was on the assumed border between the provinces of Judah and Ashdod. C. QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE IRON AGE SOCIETY AND ECONOMY ECONOMY Timnah in the Iron Age appears to have been a typical rural town. Located in one of the most fertile plains of central Palestine, near the perennial stream of Nahal Sorek, the town enjoyed an ideal Medi- terranean climate and an abundance of land and water that enabled productive agriculture. The main east-west route along the Sorek Valley connected it with Beth Shemesh and the Judean hills to the east and with Ekron and the coast to the west. Both the political history and economy of the town no doubt derived from its location on a political border, 9 km from Gezer and 7 km from Ekron. This location on a border zone probably made Timnah vulnerable to attacks by its neighbors, causing destructions fol- lowed by occupation gaps, such as those between Strata IV and III and perhaps for a short time after the destruction of Stratum III. Yet when settled, the town enjoyed prosperity. It can be assumed that the local economy was based mainly on agriculture in the surrounding alluvial plain and on the processing of agricultural products, though the evidence for these activities is slight, as the botanical finds were almost nil. A large collection of animal bones from all the areas was submitted for research to Dr. Brian Hesse from the University of Alabama. Unfortunately, no detailed report is available at the time of publication, though some preliminary results have been presented in published papers and lectures. In the Iron Age II levels, Hesse identified a ratio of 1:67:38 between pig, sheep/goat and cattle respectively (0.9% pig), while in the Iron Age I, the ratio was 1:8:4 (8% pig) (Hesse 1990: 90). In a lecture read at the ASOR annual meeting in 1990, Hesse related that the ani- mal bones of Iron Age II Timnah were 57% sheep and goat, 35% cattle, and 7% deer. The proportion varies between Areas D and E as follows: in Area D (N = 327), 59% sheep and goat, 38% cattle and 3% deer; in Area E (N = 339), 57% sheep and goat, 30% cattle and 13%(!) deer. We have very few data on industrial installations in Strata IV-III, probably due to the relatively limited exposure of structures from these strata. In Stratum IV, one stone trough in Area D may perhaps be interpreted as the crushing basin of an olive oil press ( Timnah /: 183). In Stratum III, no industrial instal- lations of any sort were found. At that time (the 8th century), the olive oil industry was flourishing in the eastern Judean Shephelah, as evidenced at Tell Beit Mirsim, Beth Shemesh and other sites. Our data from Stratum II of the 7th century are much richer due to the wide exposure and good preservation. The two oil presses are very similar to those of Tel Miqne, though with some local mod- ifications, as are the two industrial installations in the houses of Area F, the use of which remains obscure {Timnah /: 241, 243). These installations, together with fragments of stone troughs and basins found on the surface of the mound, are evidence for the widespread cottage industries practiced in the houses of Stratum II. These industries were perhaps organ- ized according to the seasons: olive oil production was carried out in the fall, while the textile industry was mainly conducted in the spring after the shearing of the herds. Thus, a year-round cycle of production of agricultural goods and processing of by-products provided a stable economic base for the city. These industries, as well as the nature of the artifacts, recall the finds at nearby Tel Miqne-Ekron and it may be claimed that Timnah's economy was a reflection of that of Ekron. The products (mainly olive oil and textiles) were perhaps sent to the same markets; it is possible that when Timnah was part of the kingdom of Ekron, its economy was interrelated and perhaps even dependent on the trade network developed by that city. The discovery of Greek pottery of the late 7th century at Ekron, Tel Batash (above, pp. 141- 144) and Mesad Hashavyahu points to the existence of an integrated system of production and export of olive oil and perhaps textiles and other products possibly conducted through the small port- fortress of Mesad Hashavyahu. The destination of these ship- ments is still obscure: it can hardly be assumed that olive oil was sent to the East Greek islands. It may be suggested that the products were sent to Egypt, which had some control of the coastal plain during the late 7th century. It is possible that the presence of Greek pottery indicates the role of Greek merchants or mercenaries in the Egyptian administration. However, even such a line of argument can hardly explain the find of a complete Samian amphora in a 283</page><page sequence="292">house in Area F at Timnah, unless such vessels were prized as elite goods at this time. It can be con- jectured that imported Samian wine was considered a novelty already at this time and thus preceded the mass import of Greek wine amphorae in the Hel- lenistic period. The use of Judean marked dome-shaped stone weights indicates close relations with the Judean economic system in Stratum II, while at nearby Tel Miqne, such weights were rare. Note the unmarked dome-shaped stone weight from Stratum IV (PL 12:10) and another similar stone, somewhat flatter, from Stratum III (PL 21:32), which were possibly forerunners of the marked weights of the 7th century. Many of the grinding stones were made of basalt, which must have been brought from the Upper Galilee or Transjordan, probably as finished goods purchased in trade. Other grinding stones were made of beachrock brought from the coast. These domestic utensils, common at all Iron Age sites, indicate commercial connections between various parts of the country during the entire Iron Age II. The few Egyptian objects found in Stratum II may be related to the strong Egyptian presence in the coastal plain during the 7th century. CRAFTS The metal objects discussed in Chapter VI indicate a gradual increase in the use of iron between the 10th and the 7th centuries, while bronze continued to be used for specific purposes and objects. Some of the iron objects found in Stratum II are of a relatively unusual shape, like the long spear and riveted handle. The number of iron and other metal objects is modest in Strata IV-III and somewhat larger in Stratum II, when several objects were found in each of the houses. While metal objects were probably imported to the town from the outside, it appears that there was a local stone industry to produce large stone objects. Large blocks of limestone were worked into crushing vats, olive oil presses, roller stones and various sorts of basins. The limestone blocks had to be carried from a distance of 1.5-2 km. Their workmanship (at least in Stratum II) indicates tradition, skill and organization. A similar tradition is attested at nearby Tel Miqne-Ekron. Jewelry and personal ornamentation were poorly represented in the finds. They include a few beads and pendants, found mainly in the houses of Stratum II, and a few stone cosmetic bowls, bone spatulas, pendants and plaques that appear occasionally in Strata III- II and belong to well-known classes of crafted objects of Iron Age Palestine. The four ivory game pieces from Stratum II are rather rare finds. RITUAL AND ART Our excavations revealed some information on art and ritual. The two zoomorphic spouts from Stratum IV (Pis. 6:18; 8:11) probably belonged to libation vessels (ring vessels?) that indicate connections with the coastal plain rather than with Judah. The three molds in Stratum III are a unique discovery; they represent local production of plaque figurines in a style that is related to the coastal plain and to Phoenicia, and is foreign to Judah. The iconography and ritual reflected by these figurines are Canaanite- Phoenician. In Stratum II, we have a ritual installa- tion (a small bamahl ) found in Unit 914 in Area E ( Timnah 1 : 222) with two chalices (PL 56:1-2), a ritual vessel (?) (PL 56:6), a zoomorphic spout (PL 56:4) and a fragment of an anthropomorphic mask found in Unit 914 (PL 56:5). This was probably a ritual place in the open small piazza serving the nearby dwelling quarter. The miniature stone altar from Building F607 (PL 75:11) is another object related to cult activity; it could have served in a domestic ritual, like the stone altars found at Tel Miqne in relation to the oil industry. The single pillar figurine is of Judean type and again alludes to the close affinity to Judah during the time of Stratum II. WHERE ARE THE CEMETERIES? One of the riddles of our site is the lack of ceme- teries. Although no search for cemeteries was carried out by our expedition, it might be expected that development activities in the region around the mound would have uncovered such cemeteries. However, none are known. Since the mound is sur- rounded by alluvial soil, it is possible that burial caves were cut in the limestone ridges about one kilometer south of the site. However, this is no more than a guess. It should be recalled that a similar sit- uation exists at various other sites, like nearby Tel Miqne. 284</page><page sequence="293">NOTES 1 Finkelstein's (1996) suggestion to lower the beginning of Philistine Bichrome ware to the late 12th century still leaves the bulk of this pottery in the 11th century. His claim that this pottery continued to be in use until the mid- 10th century is debatable (Mazar 1997). 2 Finkelstein (1996) attempted to solve the problem of the so-called "missing" 9th century by lowering the date of the above-mentioned 10th century assemblages to the 9th century, and dating to the 10th century those Iron Age I assemblages so far dated to the late 12th and 11th centuries. However, this solution raises numerous difficulties. In our case, lowering Stratum IV to the 9th century would leave a gap in the 10th century, as opposed to the gap in the 9th century implied by our dating. Finkelstein' s solution might in turn involve the lowering of our Stratum V to the 10th century. In such a case (which is unacceptable in our view), a gap would be created in the late 12th and 11th centuries. Of all these possibilities, we prefer to claim that our Stratum IV belongs to the 10th century and was followed by an occupation gap during the 9th century. 3 Gitin (1990: 38) dated Stratum VI at Gezer to the mid- 8th century and Stratum V to the late 8th to early 7th centuries. We would suggest dating the Stratum VI destruction to the campaign of 701 BCE. The appearance of two unstamped LMLK jars in the level arouses the suspicion that the end of Stratum VI at Gezer corresponds with Lachish Level III and Batash Stratum III (end of the 8th century), unless the jars at Gezer are of the "LMLK- like" type, which already appears in the late 9th century (see above, p. 95 and note 22 there). The descriptions and the appearance of ridges on the handles appear to indicate that the jars from Gezer Stratum VI are true LMLK jars. 4 Though Tomb 14 in Mackenzie's excavations and some 7th century pottery found in the water cistern (Lederman and Bunimovitz 1997) are evidence for some recovery of Beth Shemesh during the 7th century, Lederman and Bunimovitz claim that there is no evidence for a real city at that time. 285</page><page sequence="294">LOCUS LISTS WITH REFERENCES TO PLATES Nachum Applbaum AREA D Locus Stratum Definition Plate Typ. 139 I Topsoil 78 N 142 II Accumulation on upper street level, sloping from east to west 60-61 Y 147 II Accumulation on street level 58-59 Y 150 III Accumulation on street level 57 Y 173 IIA Accumulation on floor related to Installation 174 63 Y 181 II Accumulation on stone floor 37-40 Y 190 II Northern part of courtyard of Building 743 36-37 Y 730 II Upper street level 60-62 Y 731 III-II Foundation trench of Stratum II Wall 176 14-15, 17-19, 21 Y 734 III Accumulation on white lime floor 13, 15-17, 21 Y 737 III Accumulation on white lime floor, related to Floors 734 and 748 13-19, 21 Y 738 II Accumulation on second street level 58-59 Y 739 II Drain along Wall 141a, continuation of Drain 859 in Square H-32 58 Y 740 III Accumulation on pebble floor 13, 15, 21 Y 743 II Destruction debris on floor 31-40 Y 744 III Accumulation on white lime floor 13, 19, 21 Y 745 II Accumulation on stone floor 32-33, 35-36, 39^10 Y 746 II Accumulation on beaten earth floor 31-39 Y 748 III Accumulation on stone floor 13-15, 21 Y 750 III Stone floor west of Wall 749 21 Y 752b IV?
