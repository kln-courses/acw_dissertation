<plain_text><page sequence="1">DENIS HOLLIER The Dualist Materialism of Georges Bataille* ... where there is nothing which an obsession to lay bare the reverse side of thought does not consume. a) AWAKENING The light of day is the space of thought. But this space is too hospi- table to thought for something essential not to escape from this con- formity. Day only gathers thoughts subservient to the day; the insubordinate ones never come to light; they darken like the night. It could be that the awakening brought by daylight is no more than the dream of an awakening, and that thought, offered almost without its knowledge to the diurnal order, is awakened only to maintain indi- rectly a deeper sleep. Thought feels at home in a clarity which gives it an impression of mastery, a deceptive one since it does not master its own ends. It thus moves in an illusory world where transparencies reflect one another and disappear, without anything ever happening which would offer a handle for thought to grasp on to and recover itself again, really awakening it. The awakening of thought is not its exercise because, in this exercise, thought is blinded by the good toward which it gropes. The exercise of thought correspond to a distracted attraction to moral good. Its awakening begins with the contradictory and paralyzing consciousness of evil, of something which suspends thought because it cannot be thought and willed at the same time. Thus to the exercise of thought, which is a morality, since it presupposes even a naive submission to the good as the condition of its possibility, its awaken- ing is opposed, which provokes a moral demand by which the opposi- *This is a shortened and revised version of an article published in Tel quel no. 25 (Spring 1966).

"The essence of morali- ty, says Bataille, is a questioning about morality; and the decisive move of human life is to use ceaselessly all light to look for the origin of the opposition between good and evil."' It is as though one had to choose between letting oneself be directed toward the good (one might say that in this sense the good itself, the motor of the will, is not willed) and a suspension of the exercise of thought in an awaken- ing which would place one "beyond" the opposition between good and evil which it would simultaneously bring out; the choice would thus be between doing good and knowing what it is. This tells us already that, in Bataille, dualism will not oppose Good and Evil, but morality (where one does the good) and a moral rigor which is beyond good and evil. Bataille always longed for a "lived experience" in the incandes- cence of which "knowing" and "doing" would come to merge, from within which the future would rise as though the present, having opened up, would expand and flow into it, as though the future were this very drifting of the present and no longer an escape out of the present as the structure of the project would have it. A lived experi- ence which, by tying "the terms of dialectical development" to the "elements of real existence," would effect the "synthesis-at once decisive and impossible-of consciousness and the unconscious, which is for Bataille the ultimate possibility of that which is. Such a synthesis is what interested him most in psychoanalysis: it occurs, according to him, at the "moment of the brutal efficacity of analysis," a moment which he strangely describes with Heidegger's words for death: the "possibility of the impossible."2 This synthesis requires thought to withdraw from objects and projects to become the restrained, maintained tension of a purely intensive thought, awakened to itself. This is what philosophy would consist of if only philosophy agreed to "tie reflection to such an object as would exclude the possibility of its sleeping." "What does it mean to philosophize, Bataille asks, if not to push reflection to such a degree of tension that daily existence feels like sleep and the effort of 1.

And that is why at its most acute moment of awakening, thought is moral rigor, for "moral philosophy, not metaphysics or science, is the only thought process which responds head-on, which confronts the silence of our death" ("Du rapport . .. .OC 11: 199). Rational thought plans, unifies, leading-in accordance with the principle of identity-to a monism which is its first and its last, its only word; it reduces everything by translating it into terms of equa- tion and everything soon slumbers under the light of the Same. The awakening of thought, in which thought occurs as a heterogeneous event, as a break in homogeneity, thus prompts dualism, which repre- sents for Bataille the awakened (and divided) thought about awaken- ing. This thought has obvious philosophical flaws, but these are the price one must pay for the rupture with monism, the price for the committed dissatisfaction. On the subject of dualist philosophies, Bataille wrote: "It seems to me that the point at which the attention awakens here completely is that which merits this exasperating ten- sion, which becomes irritated at any possibility of reduction. But would awakening be awakening if the one who was awakened were once to find himself satisfied with what he discovers? If he didn't prolong further and without concern the interrogation which is awakening?" (Ibid., 202). It is no longer sufficient to open one's eyes and greet the day; it is necessary to open them unto the night, to the point of opening up the day to the night and the night to the other night. In Bataille's many stories of the eye, one must always "open the eyes farther." b) DUALISM Bataille never failed to acknowledge the seduction dualist thought and its often heterodox expressions exercised over him. Furthermore, seduction itself-as opposed to reason and reckoning-is what both dualism and Bataille yield to, the means they use to communicate between themselves as well as with us. The forms historically taken 3.

Dualism itself, as a doctrine, never relinquishes the un- tenable position it imposes upon the one enticed by it, keeping him in a never resolved dissatisfaction. According to Bataille, this simply results from the fact that one must choose between a perfection which, satisfying the mind, definitely puts it to sleep, and the awakening which requires an ever unresolved dissatisfaction. Among the many oppositions upon which dualisms were constructed (that of Good and Evil, of the intelligible and the sensible, of the transcendent and the immanent, of the high and the low, of virility and femininity, of vision and discourse) the opposition between the profane and the sacred is the one we must truly consider fundamental here. Let us recall, from Simone Ptrement's book (which Bataille praised enthusiastically),4 what is generally understood by dualism: the term designates a mode of thought, bordering on philosophy, religion, and mythology, of which Manichean Gnosticism is consid- ered to be the most striking manifestation. At the core of this philoso- phy, one finds, according to Petrement, "not the opposition of two gods, but the opposition of God and Matter, [Matter being] a second principle, with its distinctive nature, different from that of the spirit, and not derived from it" (12-13). As for God: "the gnostic God is 'the Stranger', 'the Unknown', 'the Abyss', 'Silence', 'the God who is not'." Never, perhaps, has the remoteness of God, the absence, the void in which he must be sought, been so exclusively the object of a theology" (15). A theology then of the absence of God, which easily evokes Bataille's atheology: "must dualism then necessarily be a sort of atheism? It is however certain that it has relations to mysticism or at least to a profound religious feeling" (91). Rather than a system of thought in the strict sense, dualism is an attitude of thought: dualism is not a dualist system but a will to dualism, a resistance to system and homogeneity. Obviously an un- tenable attitude in the long run. For system cannot help being monistic and, since the exercise of thought is spontaneously system- atizing and monistic, dualism results from the will bracing itself against this tendency, thought itself taking a stand against the move- ment proper to reason and its tendency toward conciliation, toward 4.

Thus the radicality of original dualism degenerates into a metaphysical position; that is to say it "refines" itself and corrects (I"perfects") its founding heterogeneity into the antagonism "of con- trary and symmetrical terms," whereby it does not take long to be- come a system in which duality holds only the place of a thesis, an affirmation among others: it has already become monism. For, to be true to its inspiration, dualism must remain "imperfect," "surpris- ing," "extravagant"; instead of positing two principles in conflict within the world, it posits two worlds. Or at least-"since, having nothing in common, they are not comparable and cannot be count- ed"5-dualist thinking exerts its tension in maintaining the hiatus of this duality, in maintaining it as pure interval, pure separation, pure disjointed in-between. "Of course," Petrement comments, "it seems absurd to suppose two worlds. The notion of the world is the notion of totality. How can one suppose two totalities? Language itself refuses this expression." Dualism's resistance to expression, a resistance im- bedded in language itself, condemns it to a perpetual imbalance, discomfort, a perpetual limping and sliding: never do the two "total- ities" let themselves be grasped simultaneously, never are they side by side, next to each other, because they both equally claim to be everything, to contain everything. One is the contestation of the other: they have no other common ground than their mutual exclu- sion. "This shows," says PRtrement, "that it is not a question of metaphysics." According to Bataille, it is a question of ethics. Com- menting on her book he insists on dualism's ethical dimension, a paradoxical ethics which starts beyond the line of demarcation be- tween Good and Evil. "My will to transcendence prolongs, if not the desire to find the Good, at least a longing for moral truth, which is the unappeased passion par excellence within us" ("Du rapport . . . ," OC 11:198). These two worlds cannot exist simultaneously because by defini- tion there is only one world; they will thus have to succeed one another. But in what form? How will the passage from one to the other happen? From the world of Good in which the will reigns, how will one pass to the world of Evil? Not by willing since the will is what produces the Good. How can one escape from the will? Can one will not to will? One does not choose between Evil and the Good but 5. Petrement, op. cit., 111. And also: "To posit terms as contraries is to render them inseparable; to posit them as principles of the same totality is to reunite them in the same totality."</page><page sequence="6">DENIS HOLLIER 129 between two "goods," since choice and will cannot have any other object but one which they consider to be good, the good alone being an object. Evil, on the contrary, which is the negation of objecthood, eludes the will. Here, choice is suspended and replaced by seduction. This opposition is most clearly delineated in Bataille's article on Baudelaire, in Literature and Evil: "[Baudelaire], had no will power but an attraction moved him in spite of himself. Charles Baudelaire's refusal was the most profound form of refusal, since it was in no way the assertion of an opposite principle.... Evil, which the poet does not so much perpetrate as he experiences its fascination, is Evil since the will, which can only desire the Good, has no part in it."6 One should not content oneself, however, with saying that in wanting the Good, Baudelaire (for example) really wanted to spice up Evil, or vice versa. It is true that "if the luminous intensity of Good did not give the night of Evil its blackness, Evil would lose its appeal" (ibid., "Proust," 152; OC:9:257) [142]). But Good's complicity with Evil, far from being a double game [double jeu] of the will, resides in the structure of being itself which thwarts [dejoue] the will. For the contrast (the spice) would not come into play if the will did not fully desire the Good: how would it lend itself to a game which it had itself staged? The Good is not what the will has to pretend to want in order indirectly to attain Evil and experience the refined pleasure of transgression: transgression is in fact only possible for the one who desires the Good without any ulterior motive, with all of his will. It is even this very lack of distance on the part of the will devoted to the Good which delivers it to transgression. Bataille develops the same argument in his analysis of Proust's sadism. "If pink has to be contrasted with black in order to suggest desire, would this black be black enough had we never thirst- ed for purity? had it not tarnished our dream in spite of ourselves?" Thus "if [Proust] was virtuous, it was not in order to obtain pleasure, and if he obtained pleasure, it was because he had first wanted to obtain virtue" (ibid., 158, 154; OC 9:269, 268 [143]). Evil is then, in a way, the Good which has become a source of pleasure. It starts with virtue being seduced by the Good itself. Evil results from the merging 6.

That is to say, when after hav- ing unconditionally desired the Good, the will arrives at the extreme point where it can no longer want (for there is nothing conceivable left, no object that is better) and nevertheless remains unsatisfied, aware that there still is place for something which is not itself, which is beyond the Good and imposes itself without being wanted; when the will which had wanted nothing but the good, which had wanted everything to be Good, notices that there is a residue before which it remains helpless, a residue which has total power over it since, at this extreme point, will becomes so vulnerable that it can only yield, although it is aware that it was precisely this which, in wanting, it did not want. Such is transgression: that point where the will, reduced to impotence before the irreducibility of a residue, can only, though without wanting to (for there is nothing left to want), yield, know- ingly, to what it did not want; Good itself somehow, being compro- mised in the passivity of pleasure, veers toward Evil without lucidity of consciousness diminishing. Evil is consciousness in pleasure, a passing consciousness that cannot last. Its place is the punctual tres- passing flash when the interdiction is crossed: to dwell on the other side of interdictions, to claim to remain in evil (as Genet, according to Bataille, would have it) is nonsense (cf., La Litterature et le ma], "Genet," 203; OC 9:300). Evil does not exist independently of the interdiction which is the limit of the Good; beyond this limit reigns only another Good; not Evil. Evil never reigns. In gnostic dualism, Bataille was seduced by a contradictory mate- rialism which he opposed to the physicist's mechanical and rational materialism which, because it is monistic, he called a "doddering idealism." Thus Bataille's attitude can be portrayed as a dualist mate- rialism: an "impossible" attitude, as distant from theology as it is from even an atheistic humanism which he named atheology. In his first article about Gnosticism, "Le Bas materialisme et la gnose," written in 1929, Bataille interprets the recurrent representation in Gnostic iconography of a headless animal as an affirmation of athe- ological materialism. "The severed ass's head of the acephalic person- ification of the sun undoubtedly represents, even if imperfectly, one of materialism's most virulent manifestations."7 This is the point where the two parts of Bataille's theoretical work merge; the Somme Atheologigue and La Part maudite. 7.

God's absence is greater, it is more divine than God (I am thus no longer I, but an absence of I: I was waiting for that conjuring away and now, beyond measure, I am gay).8 Even if Bataille's references, with their sometimes scientific claims, can be bothersome, the opposition between the sacred and the pro- fane is the matrix of his thought, notably of what we have called his dualism. Let us posit an initial definition: existence is profane when it lives in the face of a transcendence, it is sacred when it lives in immanence. However, matters become complicated as soon as one asks what in the profane world is transcendent and, in the sacred world, imma- nent. Indeed, to the first question one must answer that it is the sacred itself which is transcendent for the profane: the profane is defined by the absence of the sacred from which it is separated, this separation constituting its distinctive mark. But what is the sacred? Let us clarify the question because, as we shall see, it is ambiguous: what is the sacred from which the profane is separated and which transcends it? It has many names of which the most commonly used are God, or the State, or total Man; but what is fundamental here is less what is posited as transcendent (these ab- stract entities) than the very separation as a structure of existence. It is thus profane existence itself which produces separation, institutes itself as separate from the sacred, and the transcendence by which it defines the sacred in fact characterizes the profane itself. "Everything leads one to believe," says Andre Breton, "that there exists a certain place in the spirit where life and death, the real and the imaginary, past and future, the communicable and the incommunica- ble are no longer perceived to be in contradiction to one another." Bataille quotes him and continues "I shall add: Good and Evil, pain and joy."9 But he does not add: the sacred and the profane. Dualism 8.

Moreover, this very point, this instant of the fusion of contraries defines the sacred as such and distinguishes it from the profane: the sacred confuses that which the profane opposes or distinguishes. There are then indeed two worlds, the profane in which we live, and the sacred in which we die, the world of the presence of I, and the world of the absence of I, of my absence, the world where I am not, where there are no I's. "The world we die in, says Bataille, is not the 'world we live in'." This world is opposed to the world we live in like the inaccessible to the accessible."'0 The opposition thus is not be- tween this world and then the other world, but the world of identity and its alteration; the world of thought [la pensee] and its expenditure [de'ense], the world of measure and its immoderation [demesure]. The sacred does not so much contradict the profane, as it differs from it by a difference which is the alteration of its identity. It is a strange relation which ties together these two worlds with no common ground, whose unthinkable and impossible coexistence cannot be described in terms of an addition or a totality, never amounting to a total. This situation appears clearly in Bataille's tex- tual operations involving the name of "God," the profane name of the sacred. Even if it is the highest name, God remains nevertheless just a name and from this perspective, a tributary of language, it remains bound to the profane world. Doubtless, insofar as it is the highest word, God is the key word which permits (like a weak point in the system which has called upon it to achieve its closure) the sacred to be evoked, but the profane name of the sacred, as soon as it turns away from this profane status, reveals itself to be the absence of God. But let us stop at this passage. In Bataille, the name of God refers to what is the keystone of the profane world, the world in which things are what they are. God is the one who guarantees the identity of the self, who guarantees compen- sations proportional to merits, justice, balance, stability of meanings in language; tied to the isolation of individuals in separate selves, it is the supreme self whose idea enables human selves, despite their separation and their limits, to communicate among themselves. 10. "Ce Monde oiL nous mourons," Critique, August-September, (1957); OC 12: 457.</page><page sequence="10">DENIS HOLLIER 133 These exchanges obviously escape the direct and sacrificial commu- nication of the sacred; they are indirect and result from a compromise between the integrity of individuals and the desire they have to open themselves to one another. Yet this keystone which, at least partially (from the fact that God is present under the guise of a word), belongs to the profane system itself, is considered by the profane system- which it thus sustains, or which is sustained through its mediation- as contaminated by the sacred world. Starting with this keystone, the profane world is able to edify itself into a quasi-architectural system (hierarchical and specialized parts working together to give solidity and cohesion to the whole). But this results in an architecture which hangs upon that which it rejects; the top of the edifice remains some- how heterogeneous to it, since, like a key, the name of God serves as much to close the profane world as to open it. It is as much that which separates the profane from the sacred as that which links it to it, and if the obverse of it is profane, its reverse is sacred. The name of God introduces the equivocal dimension of the presence-absence whose ambiguous play will contaminate all language. For this name which posits the divine as transcendent is the absence of God: absence of his presence; but its reverse, or the sacred (as distinct from the divine), is also a mode of the absence of God, this time however in the sense of the presence of his absence and of the immanent experience of this absence. This passage from the obverse to the reverse is what Bataille calls the sacrifice, that is the putting to death of God by man, which both consecrates the dead God and deifies his human murderer, the perpetrator of God's absence. d) MAN He who does not "die" from being only a man will never be other than a man."1 The truth of the universe is expenditure, which is not graspable, never fully thinkable. The incompatibility between thought [pensee] and expenditure [depense] is radical, similar to that between conscious 11. L'Experience intdrieure (Paris: Gallimard, 1954), 49; OC 5: 47. [We are using the English translation, Inner Experience, trans. with introduction by Leslie Anne Boldt (New York: State University of New York Press, 1988)).</page><page sequence="11">134 Yale French Studies and unconscious. Thus, since expenditure is ultimately the un- thinkable par excellence, thought itself is the suspension of expendi- ture. This is the topic of "Corps celestes," an essay published in 1938, a first version of the pages which La Notion de depense will devote to cosmology. In it Bataille refers to Eddington, the astronomer associ- ated with the theory of the expanding universe; but his reading of it transforms it into an interpretation of the world that would rather deserve the name of expending universe.'2 There is one truth in the universe; it is expenditure, which is never thinkable. But it is visible, perceptible, for the sun brings it as its own-if blinding-evidence, the sun which, fire and flame, is nothing but the incessant expendi- ture of energy with no compensation whatsoever.13 Yet, although this is the general law of the universe, one single point of the universe, a cold spot in the furnace, oddly insists on ignoring it: the Earth (the planet of thinking beings), a blind place in this luminous, bulging immensity, an avaricious planet, somber and cold, isolated in a prodi- gal, luminous, and boiling universe. While the universe, in the boundless movement which it communicates to all of its parts-so completely that it is scarcely possible to continue speaking of parts, so intrinsically alien is it to any separation-, is uniquely this very movement, the endless manifestation of an incessant disappearance, the total loss which is radiance, on Earth, on the contrary, the parts are jealously isolated, the mass becomes atomized, the particles claim for themselves an autonomy in which they withdraw, indepen- dent of the totality which gathers them. 14 Symmetrical to the cosmic 12.

Bataille's sun always split into two, between light and heat, between rays and flames (which become ashes). It is thus always necessary to make the distinction between Platonic sun and that of Prometheus-Van Gogh; between the sun which illuminates and that which consumes; between that of erection ("le dur desir de du- rer,") [the hard desire to endure] and of ejaculation. For Bataille, the shift from one to the other is dramatized in the central episode of the myth of Icarus, the passage of the sun "that was shining at the moment of elevation" to the one "that melted the wax." (Soleil pourri," Documents, 1930; OC 1: 231-32). ["Rotten Sun," VE, 57-58]. 14. "Earth, as a heavenly body, differs indeed from a star insofar as it is cold and does not shine.... The surface of the planet is formed not only of molecules, each uniting a small number of atoms, but of much more complex compositions, some crystalline, other colloidal, the latter leading to the autonomous forces of life, to plants, to animals, to men, to human society.... Cold Earth cannot keep the atoms of</page><page sequence="12">DENIS HOLLIER 135 cornucopian overflow, a general devouring movement prevails on Earth. The scientist (at once earthly body and thinking being) claims for himself the status of an exception to his own theory. Thus it is as though the Earth's surface were the theater of a reversal in the general movement of the universe. The first move- ment, unbounded, is that of "communication" between beings, the second, hierarchical, that of what Bataille describes as the "composi- tion of beings."'5 Since the autonomy of isolated beings increases in proportion to the degree to which they are composite, to the complex- ity of their constitution, composition is a movement which produces a hierarchical and pyramidal system of beings, at the summit of which Bataille places human society, the most complex of all orga- nisms, with language and discursive knowledge working as "biolog- ical binder" (the equivalent for society to what tissues are for bodies). We can translate this fact into terms whose meanings we have already established. For example, with matter-the formless matter of Bataille's "base materialism"-we can identify the generalized movement of cosmic expenditure and with form, its miserly an- thropocentric denial. Matter, the complex labyrinth of uncomposed beings, is the base of the pyramid. We could also say that matter which is spent-matter is in fact just another name for expenditure and "dissimilation"-is in this way, above all, relentless exterioriza- tion, a pure outside, while autonomous organisms whose lives are characterized by absorption and assimilation only exist by virtue of the separation between an outside and an inside. But earthly bodies (such as scientists), even if they ignore the general movement of the expenditure of energy, are not independent of it, for they consume and accumulate its energy. While resisting expenditure, they remain no less integrated into the cosmic move- ment of energy, saving what is spent, absorbing what is produced, internalizing what is externalized. The Earth is thus a cosmic hole in which the truth of the universe (expenditure, communication, glorious manifestation) gets drained, sucked in, sacrificed. But the Earth and man-since the culminating point of the will for autonomy is the epistemological species, the her surface within the power of an almost zero radiation, and the 'movement of the whole' which forms around her moves in a direction contrary to that of the movement formed within a star with high temperature."

By claiming that the universe is meant to bestow itself for them, they turn away from their aleatory origins. "All that we recognize as truth is necessarily linked to the error represented by the 'stationary earth"' ("Corps Celestes," OC 1:516 [76]). And, since anthropocentrism is the main feature of sys- tems of thought which are unable to expand, to decenter themselves far enough to conceive of the excentricity of expenditure, "the crown- ing achievement of this [devouring] tendency is anthropocentrism" (ibid., 518 [77]). Anthropocentrism, indeed, represses dehumanizing and decentering excesses; it is committed to saving "the world we live in," a world organized around the human subject, against the world of expenditure, which Bataille also calls "the world we die in," "a world for nobody, a world from which subjects have been evacu- ated, the world of the non-I." But here is precisely the point where the reversal occurs, where man's avaricious reversal of the law of the universe will itself be reversed. Even man, ultimately, has to enter into communication and expenditure. To start with, in Bataille's description of man, the ac- cumulative drive itself is so strong, that it becomes a virtually unre- stricted, unbounded, endless and aimless force which increasingly comes to resemble its opposite: unrestricted expenditure. A greed without reserve, a greed that loses its limits, becoming excessive, unquenchable. "The greater their wealth, the more they proliferate. Their productive force produces only new productive force.... Men," Bataille continues, "began. . . to observe the greed which drove them as a curse."'16 In "Corps celestes," man's greed, the very compulsion to produce and to accumulate, is what Bataille calls man's accursed share. Thus, the movement that opposes expenditure, rather strangely, was originally described with the very terms which will later characterize expenditure itself. The curse which first re- ferred to what cannot be spent will later refer to what cannot be saved. In this specific case, the logic of the shift is dependent on the concept of avariciousness, which requires limits. In becoming infin- ite, greed loses its meaning, it becomes excess instead of greed, a 16. "Corps cdlestes," OC 1:519. In Le Bleu du ciel, Dirty's excesses are identified with her voraciousness.</page><page sequence="14">DENIS HOLLIER 137 greed expanding into expenditure. Infinite avarice and infinite prodi- gality become indistinguishable. This shift or reversal reflects a hiatus which is essential in Bataille's theory of expenditure, a theory which, submitted to a sort of theoretical stuttering-the characteristic rhythm of dualism-can- not be uttered in one breath. It takes several attempts to get it out. Thus, as a first step, man discovers the law of the universe, but in so doing, he escapes it, he distinguishes himself from it. The motor does not move. The thinking of expenditure is tax deductible, it is not itself an expenditure. Instead of donating, it collects data. Denying the cost of information (that one has to expend oneself in order to know), science is the intellectual, ideological version of the earthly refusal of expenditure. The planet is not the only version of an immo- bile ground. Scientific discourse is another one, an intellectual and abstract form of anthropocentrism which the Copernican revolution did not succeed in demolishing. Thus writes Bataille: "Even if human existence is really in the process of discovering the universe that sustains it, this existence must acknowledge the universe as a specta- cle external to it or else deny itself" (ibid., 516 [76]). The existential problem of science is that of an Oedipus who risks being swallowed by the sphinx precisely because he found the right answer. Contrary to Brecht's Verfremdungseffekt, this distancing is essentially a strat- egy that prevents the beholder from being absorbed by the show. Man resists entering the spectacle, he resists identifying with it. He does not recognize himself in it. Were he to acknowledge himself "as spec- tacle viewing itself," he would risk losing his life. Yet, at the heart of this cosmology, there is a contradiction be- tween the existential position of the subject and his knowledge, the gap between what man knows and what he is. A cold minded and cold hearted vulcanologist, he develops a theory of an expanding universe from a position which is based on the refusal of expansiveness. Man withdraws from the game, he shirks expenditure. He does not partici- pate in the play of the world, imagining that he is an exception, that he rests on safe, solid, stable ground in a world invaded by movement. A first form of the break with anthropomorphism is a blind one, the Dionysian surpassing of the theoretical (Apollonian) attitude. This first way out is an explosive one. The vulcanolgist moves out to Pompey. He replaces reserve with self-sacrifice, with "the need to give, whether one's own self or one's possessions." "Through loss</page><page sequence="15">138 Yale French Studies man can regain the free movement of the universe, he can dance and swirl in the full rapture of those great swarms of stars" (ibid., 520 [78]). But the situation to which such a break leads cannot be described as the "spectacle viewing itself." This time, however, it is for the op- posite reason: the ex-beholder is blinded, and even destroyed by his proximity with the show, his participation in it. Entering depense, he lost pensee. At least, this is what Bataille says in "Corps celestes." However, it is not what happens in it: "Corps celestes" is an essay which is about blindness without being blind itself. It escapes the alternative between the two exclusive positions df a thought that distances itself from any expenditure and an expenditure which ex- cludes thought. In the final analysis, the major interest of Bataille's theory of expenditure might not be of an economic or anthropological order but, rather, of an epistemological one. Its interest stems less from its theoretical content than from what it does to the space of knowledge. A memorable discussion in Paris followed the publication of L'Expe- rience interieure, during which Bataille was grilled by the most important philosophers of his time, Sartre included. One of his last answers is literally a turning upside down of Lucretius's Suave mari magno.... It is hard to decide if it relates to the actual setting of the exchange, Bataille the self-taught eclectic being examined by li- censed philosophers, or whether it is a description in general terms of his philosophical position. Lucretius describes man's pleasure at wit- nessing the storm which imperils others from the solidity of the philosophical shores, a position in many regards analogous to what Bataille, in "Corps celestes," called the error of "stationary earth." But, in answering the various philosophers who had questioned him during the discussion, Bataille reverses the image: "Placed before you, I feel myself to be the contrary of him who tranquilly watches the dismasted vessels from the shore, because in fact, in spite of everything, I cannot imagine anyone so cruel that he could notice the one who is dismasted with such carefree laughter. Sinking is some- thing altogether different, one can have it to one's heart's content."'7 Bataille's cogito, thus, reads: "I sink therefore I am." In the violent expenditure of self, man must "perceive that he breathes in the power of death" ("Corps celestes," 5:20 [78]). This philosophical raft of the Medusa is the allegory of a thought that has 17.

A thought which sustains itself be- yond the loss of the subject, when thought keeps going even after its subject has been spent. Expenditure here is not so much an object to be thought of, as it is the mode of thought when there is no subject left to think it. Thinking expenditure, for a subject, means first of all thinking of a scene from which he has been evacuated. It means to push self-sacrifice at least to the point of the loss of ego, entering a space where the ego, having become expendable, is endowed with the glory of not being there.
