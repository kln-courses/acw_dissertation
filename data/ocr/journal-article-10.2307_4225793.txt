<plain_text><page sequence="1">J eI JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES Vol. XX No. 4 December 1986 Bellamy and Veblen's "Christian Morals" Charles G. Leathers From his first book to his last, Thorstein Veblen consistently cast institutional Christianity in a very negative light. In The Theory of The Leisure Class, Christianity appears as "a patriarchal religion of futile subservience to extravagant earthly representatives of a leisure-laden heavenly hierarchy" [Riesman 1953, p. 66]. Rooted in the animistic and anthropomorphic tendencies of ancient peaceable savages and shaped into institutional form under barbarism, religion in modem in- dustrial societies was portrayed by Veblen as an archaic irrational ata- vism, its social influence impeding economic efficiency and social progress. But he foresaw a tentative future for institutional Christianity as the mental disciplining of modem industrial processes progressively eroded the spiritual habit of "devoutness." While that erosion seemed to be most pronounced among industrial workers, he reported that even the business class had lost most of its devotional fervor. "Devout- ness" remained strong primarily among those most insulated from the exigencies of modem economic life, for example, leisure class women [Veblen 1945, pp. 293-331]. In Absentee Ownership, published in 1923, Veblen heavily ridiculed religious practices in a note on the "Propaganda of the Faith" at the end of the chapter on salesmanship and in such footnote barbs as: "When brought within the three dimensions of space and submitted to The author is Professor of Economics, The University of Alabama.

Leathers the logic of physics and chemistry the potent sacraments of the Holy Church are no different from the futile incantations of the Black Art" [Veblen 1938, pp. 319-25, 2821. Obviously, the erosion of the social influence of institutional religion suggested in The Theory of the Leisure Class either had not materialized or had been substantially slowed. But in "Christian Morals and the Competitive System," an essay published in 1910, Veblen described a different form of Christianity, one involving a natural impulse toward brotherly love and communal- ism [Veblen 1 964b, pp. 200-218]. Linked to the hereditary elements of human nature (as those elements appear in Veblen's theory of "in- stincts"), it persisted in exerting a positive moral influence over eco- nomic behavior. Indeed, his closing statements suggest that this Christian impulse toward brotherly love verged on impelling revolu- tionary social change at the expense of the business enterprise system. Veblen's vision of a potentially revolutionary natural Christianity seems to contradict his other writings.' Moreover, it proved to be an ephemeral vision, as there is no mention of a natural Christianity in any subsequent works. John P. Diggins has interpreted the "Christian Morals" essay as Veblen's response to Max Weber's thesis on Protes- tantism and capitalism [Diggins 1978, p. 133]. But that still does not explain how Veblen came by his vision of a natural Christianity, or why he quickly abandoned it. Joseph Dorfman and, subsequently, a number of other writers (re- cently, Arthur Lipow and John L. Thomas) have taken the position that Veblen's work was directly influenced by Edward Bellamy [Dorfman 1966, pp. 68-71; Lipow 1982, pp. 76, 79; Thomas 1983, pp. 259-60]. In a landmark article, Rick Tilman recently developed a close analysis of the similarities and differences between Bellamy's utopian vision and Veblen's, and demonstrated that there are "grounds for strong sus- picion" that the utopian traits in Veblen's institutional economics were rooted in Bellamy's utopian novels Looking Backward and Equality [Tilman 1985, p. 893]. One section of Tilman's article examined the similarities between Bellamy's and Veblen's views on religion and mo- rality [Tilman 1985, pp. 880-81]. In this article we propose to take the analysis a step further to explore the possibility that Veblen's curious vision of a natural Christianity was inspired in large part by Bellamy's "religion of solidarity" and its role in the new utopian society of the future. Veblen and Social Christianity Prior to 1910, Veblen not only impugned religious institutions and practices, but viewed the Social Christianity movement with either dis-</page><page sequence="3">Bellamy and Veblen's "Christian Morals" 1109 interest or skepticism. Social Christianity (or the Social Gospel) was liberal American Protestantism's response to the problems of the mod- em industrial society.2 The Christian humanitarians rejected the ethics of individualism and the philosophy of laissez-faire capitalism, and preached that a just socio-economic order could be created through a process of moral reform (social salvation) based on the application of Christ's social teachings [Hopkins 1940, pp. 318-27]. Social progress was not predetermined, but was highly probable due to the innate good- ness of humanity. Human behavior that deviates from the "law of love" is a product of inhumane social and economic institutional envi- ronments, not of flawed human nature. A progressive realization of the kingdom of heaven on earth can be expected as individuals recognize with increasing clarity the unity between God's divine plan and a just socio-economic order. In contrast to traditional doctrine, the Social Gospel emphasized the salvation of society rather than the personal salvation of individuals. The basic theological premise was the belief in the immanence of God, which reflected the influence of science, especially the Darwinian the- ory of evolution, on liberal Protestant theology (see Dombrowski [1966, pp. 14-30], and Hopkins [1940, p. 320]). A solidaristic view of society emerged from that belief in an indwelling God working out di- vine purposes in this world, which stood at odds with the individualis- tic orientation of mainstream economics and sociology. Although the Social Gospel stressed moral reform that embraced a liberal program of progressive reforms, it was a genuine religious movement with a the- istic center. While salvation was social and occurred in the kingdom of heaven on earth, it remained a divine process of redemption [Hopkins 1940, p. 321]. Seemingly, there was nothing in the Social Christianity movement that merited Veblen's approval. Claims of divine intercession in social life were irrational and unscientific, rooted in animistic fantasies and superstition. Christian utopian socialists who sought solutions to mod- em socio-economic problems in schemes that called for the re- establishment of the pre-industrial past were naive and impractical. Progressivism calling for reforms that retained elements of bourgeois individualism was inadequate to deal with the problem of concentra- tions of power and wealth that had resulted in large part from the tech- nical and economic imperatives of modem large-scale business. For Veblen, any hope for the future rested with science and social engineer- ing [Diggins 1978, p. 9]. In surveying the history of Christian socialism in America, Dom- browski observed that "For the most part leaders of the Social Gospel were liberals advocating an ethic of charity consonant with a conser-</page><page sequence="4">o10 Charles G. Leathers vative and aristocratic society and based on the assumption of a perma- nently class-divided world" [Dombrowski 1966, p. 21]. In "The Army of the Commonwealth," published in 1894, Veblen expressed very sim- ilar views. There he described preachers of the Social Gospel as "the gentle-mannered spokesmen of the pulpit, whose discourse runs upon the duties of the rich toward the poor, and of rulers toward their sub- jects-the duty of a "superior" class towards an "inferior class" [Veblen 1964, p. 102]. Yet, the "Christian Morals" essay suggests that by 1910 Veblen had made a surprising concession (if only temporarily) to the Christian hu- manitarian movement. He reaffirmed his earlier assertion that the fu- ture of institutional Christianity, the "religious cult of Christianity," was in doubt due to the "current materialistic outlook and the current skepticism touching supernatural matters," but insisted that no such doubts could be entertained about the "morals of Christianity" [Veblen 1964, p. 200]. Stripped of its mysticism and animistic properties, Chris- tianity possesses a unique spirit-a spiritual animus habitual to its fol- lowers. That "Christian animus" rests upon two elemental features unique to Christianity-an impulse toward brotherly love, and a habit of self-abnegation or humility [Veblen 1964, p. 2011. The early Christians came by these features as a consequence of their subjection to Roman oppression. Self-abnegation or humility was an acquired trait that tended to fade in the absence of those pressures re- sponsible for its emergence. The impulse toward brotherly love or mu- tual succor, however, was a ubiquitous trait springing from deep within the human fabric. It was actually an ancient hereditary trait, rooted in the fundamental elements of human nature. It was not acquired by the early Christians by divine inspiration or revelation. Rather, under the conditions of oppression they suffered, primitive human nature reas- serted itself and the brotherly love impulse reappeared among them in the forms of a "cultural reversion." According to Veblen, it was "noth- ing else than a somewhat specialized manifestation of the instinct of workmanship and as such, it has the indefeasible vitality that belongs to the hereditary traits of human nature" [Veblen 1964, p. 215]. Curiously, according to Veblen, the social influence of this Christian impulse seemed to be growing stronger in the modem system of vast interdependencies shaped by modern technology and large-scale orga- nizations. "The golden rule of the peaceable savage has never lost the respect of occidental mankind, and its hold on men's convictions is, perhaps, stronger now than at any earlier period of the modern time" [Veblen 1964b, p. 215]. In contrast, the morals of the pecuniary competitive system are rooted in concepts of natural rights that were acquired much later in</page><page sequence="5">Bellamy and Veblen's "Christian Morals" 1111 history. Such principles of right conduct were consistent at best with life under the handicraft era of socio-economic development, and are incongruent with the current economic order. Indeed, Veblen asserted that they are in a process of disintegration, particularly so as "business has taken on the character of an impersonal, dispassionate, not to say, graceless, investment for profit" [Veblen 1964, p. 218]. Readers of The Theory of the Leisure Class and Absentee Ownership are understand- ingly baffled by his closing comments: "Except for a possible reversion to a cultural situation strongly characterized by ideals of emulation and status, the ancient racial bias embodied in the Christian principle of brotherhood should logically continue to gain ground at the expense of the pecuniary morals of competitive business" [Veblen 1964, p. 218]. Despite agnostic views acquired in his youth, Veblen evidently de- cided at some point that Christianity possessed a social dimension that could be incorporated into his basic social theory (which rejects all forms of animistic, supernatural phenomena).3 But what explains the particular form that he gave it in the "Christian Morals" essay? Obvi- ously, he could have developed that vision of a natural Christianity as an original thought, but it seems more likely that his thinking on Chris- tianity was substantially influenced by the views of one Christian humanitarian-Edward Bellamy. In analyzing the relationship between Bellamy's utopian vision and Veblen, Tilman was able to meet two of the conditions set forth by Quentin Skinner as a test for direct intellectual influence [Tilman 1985, p. 893]. He showed that there was a genuine similarity between the ideas of Bellamy and Veblen, with the probability of a random rela- tionship being very low. But he was unable to show that Veblen could not have found the relevant doctrines in the works of other writers. This is similarly true in the case of Veblen's "Christian Morals." The general ideas were prevalent in the works of the Christian humanitar- ians, which included an economist with whom Veblen had direct con- tact-Richard Ely. Indeed, David W. Nobel has commented that the "Christian Morals" essay followed the pattern of Richard Ely (and Si- mon Patten) "almost to the letter" [Nobel 1958, p. 225]. Since Ely had no influence on Veblen's social thought, any similarity between Veb- len's natural Christianity and Ely's writings on social Christianity would seem to be purely coincidental. In view of Tilman's demonstration that utopian traits in Veblen's institutional economics were directly influenced by Bellamy's ideas, it seems highly probable that the same holds true for the origin of Veb- len's vision of a natural and potentially revolutionary Christianity. In Looking Backward and Equality, Bellamy went well beyond describing a rational social system resting on perfect equality of income and full</page><page sequence="6">1112 Charles G. Leathers production of useful goods. His utopian society of the future was por- trayed as a triumph of Christian social values, a "Republic of the Golden Rule." But Christianity appears in new garb. The old institu- tional Christianity of churches, creeds, dogma, rituals, and ordinated clergy has vanished along with other irrational atavistic institutions of the old order. It is in this dimension of Bellamy's utopian vision, ad- mittedly replete with "religious mysticism and spiritualism" that we seek a possible source of Veblen's "Christian Morals" (see Samuels [1984, p. 141]). Moreover, Bellamy's fictional description of how the new Christianity came to be the driving force of the "great revolution- ary" might possibly provide some insight into Veblen's comments that seemed to hint of a coming revolution of social values. Bellamy's Religion of Solidarity and Veblen's "Christian Morals" As Tilman noted, both Bellamy and Veblen viewed institutional Christianity in a very negative light. Both cited a diminishing influence of institutional religion in the late nineteenth century (and both ob- served that women in the leisure class society tended to support eccle- siastical authority more strongly than did men). But they offered different explanations for the diminishing social influence of institu- tional Christianity. Bellamy emphasized education as the destroyer of irrational institutions and spoiler of myths.4 As the masses became bet- ter educated, the "general law of progress" led them to see the illogical premises and perverse teachings of the traditional religion [Bellamy 1942, pp. 252-64]. On the other hand, Veblen emphasized the mental conditioning of those exposed to the matter-of-fact, cause-and-effect thought processes inherent in modem technology. Thus, people in close contact with the industrial production processes in the modem system tend to acquire "a proclivity to undevout scepticism" [Veblen 1945, p. 330]. That Bellamy and Veblen shared a negative view of institutional Christianity is not sufficient in itself to establish any link between Bel- lamy and Veblen's "Christian Morals" essay. To construct a case that such a link exists, we have to examine Bellamy's description of the reli- gious impulse that emerged as a strong social force at the same time that institutional Christianity was being totally rejected.5 Bellamy describes the new religion as one of solidarity: "a religion of life and conduct dominated by an impassioned sense of solidarity of humanity and of man with God" [Bellamy 1942, pp. 344-45]. More- over, he identified it as the true doctrine of Christianity, "the very dis- tillation of Christ's teaching as to the conditions of entering on the</page><page sequence="7">Bellamy and Veblen's "Christian Morals" 1113 divine life" [Bellamy 1942, p. 2691. But like Veblen's "Christian Mor- als," the religion of solidarity was a natural Christianity with the same primary attribute-a spirit of brotherly love that provides an impulsive bent in individuals' social behavior. Love of fellow man is "the very distillation of Christ's teaching as to the conditions of entering on the divine life" [Bellamy 1942, p. 269]. The enlightened rational people of the new society have recognized that "Through boundless love man be- comes a god, for thereby is he made conscious of his oneness with God, and all things are put under his feet" [Bellamy 1942, p. 267]. There is a large difference between Bellamy and Veblen in reference to God and the divine nature of the impulse toward brotherly love. Veblen rejected any explanation of the impulse as originating from di- vine inspiration or revelation, and explained it as a "cultural reversion" through which primitive human nature reasserted itself. Is the element of "religious mysticism and spiritualism" rampant in Bellamy's discus- sion of the religion of solidarity sufficient to nullify any possibility that Veblen's vision of a natural Christianity was largely drawn from Bella- my's view of a new Christianity? A close examination of Bellamy's dis- cussion leads us to conclude that it is not. In the context of his utopian social thought, Bellamy's references to God seem to be more in a metaphysical vein than a proclamation of the existence of a divinity with a definite personality. His real emphasis was not on the mastery of this world by a divine being, but rather that social justice was in itself tantamount to humanity becoming divine: "'man must be revealed to man as brother before God could be revealed to him as father" [Bellamy 1942, p. 268]. He also noted that "it was impossible that there should be any general apprehension of God as Christ saw him until social justice had brought in brotherly love" [Bel- lamy 1942, p. 268]. The following comments perhaps most effectively convey the humanistic emphasis of Bellamy's references to God: "If we love one another, God dwelleth in us," and mark how the words were made good in the way by which at last the race found God! It was not, remember, by directly, purposely, or consciously seeking God. The great enthusiasm of humanity which overthrew the old order and brought in the fraternal society was not primarily or consciously a godward aspira- tion at all. It was essentially a humane movement [Bellamy 1942, p. 269]. At Yale, Veblen commented to an associate that he was willing to accept God as a metaphysical necessity, but was undecided as to the role of Christ in the scheme of things [Dorfman 1966, p. 42]. On that basis, he could have accepted Bellamy's vision of natural Christianity as a social force. But even such a concession would not have been nec-</page><page sequence="8">1114 Charles G. Leathers essary. He could simply replace Bellamy's concept of the immanence of God with a "scientific" explanation of the origin of the impulse to- ward brotherly love. Bellamy, like Veblen, asserted that the impulse was older than Christianity. The doctrine of love had been taught since the beginning of history and doubtlessly even earlier, although it was most fully and clearly enunciated in Christ's teachings [Bellamy 1942, pp. 267-68]. That would accord with Veblen's assertion that the im- pulse toward brotherly love was an element in the nature of the ancient peaceable savages. Since Bellamy's utopian society represented a full blossoming of the uncontaminated instinct of workmanship, it would have been relatively easy for Veblen to attribute the impulse to that instinct without affecting its character as a positive social force. "Christian" Revolutions The most intriguing aspect of the "Christian Morals" essay was Veb- len's conclusion that the social influence of natural Christianity would gain ground at the expense of the morals of the capitalistic system. Dorfman has commented that the essay "is almost suggestive of The Communist Manifesto and its ringing close" [Dorfman 1966, p. 293]. Did Veblen really believe that the impulse of brotherly love was man- ifesting into a revolutionary social force? He provided no further dis- cussion that would offer any clarification, and it would be futile to speculate as to what he might have been thinking as he wrote the closing comments of the "Christian Morals" essay. But it is interesting to note that in Bellamy's fictional account of how the "Republic of the Golden Rule" came into existence, the "great revolution" culminated in a great revival of religious fervor. The revolution began as a rational rejection of the inefficient and in- humane system of capitalism. The general level of intelligence and edu- cation of the populace had risen to such a level that the flaws of the old system and the wonderful logic of the new system were starkly evident to the masses. From the start, the revolution and its theme of economic equality was opposed by the religious establishment on grounds that it violated religious principles. But the masses of Americans, whom Bel- lamy called "the most intelligently religious people," soon recognized that the revolution was actually the ultimate Christian movement and that the plan for perfect equality was a literal fulfillment on a complete social scale of Christ's golden rule [Bellamy 1942, p. 343]. As that con- viction took hold, the masses gave it their most fervent support and the revolution surged forward to its ultimate consumation on the crest of a wave of tremendous religious emotion [Bellamy 1942, pp. 340-42].</page><page sequence="9">Bellamy and Veblen's "Christian Morals" 1115 This surge of religious enthusiasm, labeled by Bellamy the "Great Revival," marked the beginning of the new Christianity-the religion of solidarity. But it was a completely different type of revival than any of those that had occurred in the old order. It was a spontaneous out- pouring of enthusiasm by the masses for social, rather than personal, salvation. "It was the general awakening of the people of America in the closing years of the last century to the profoundly religious charac- ter and claims of the movement in an industrial system which should generate the economic equality of all the people" [Bellamy 1942, p. 340]. We do not suggest that Veblen necessarily viewed the Christian im- pulse toward brotherly love as leading to an emotional fervor for social change moving toward an egalitarian society. But he may have been captivated by Bellamy's fictional use of a "great revival" to perfectly merge the Christian impulse toward love (as a social phenomenon) with the rational principles of production and distribution in a modem industrial system. According to Bellamy, the new economic truth was that maximum efficiency in wealth production was conformity on a na- tional scale to the ethical principle of the Golden Rule. While rational intelligence allowed people to see the compelling economic basis for abandoning the old system, it was the religious impulse of brotherly love that made them embrace the concept of equality with such enthu- siasm. But there is a difference between Bellamy's account of the "great re- vival" and Veblen's vision of the social force of natural Christianity (although admittedly our understanding of the latter is quite murky). The way was cleared for Bellamy's "great revival" by the early phase of the "great revolution," which was not religious in nature. Social jus- tice created an environment in which the natural impulse toward love of fellow man could flourish. In contrast, Veblen saw the morals of Christianity as provoking a social rejection of the morals of capitalism. As Diggins states: "Veblen believed, or perhaps desperately hoped, that the 'instincts' of natural Christianity would prevail over the institutions of capitalism" [Diggins 1978, p. 135]. That difference aside, Veblen undoubtedly responded warmly to Bel- lamy's description of the attempt by conservatives (including the clergy) to prevent the revolution being recognized by the masses as nothing more than a controversy between "the almighty dollar and the Almightly God" [Bellamy 1942, p. 345]. In Bellamy's fictional account, the latter won, hands down. Perhaps there is an element of this reflected in Veblen's assertion of an effectual discrepancy between the Christian impulse toward brotherly love and the morals of capitalism, and espe-</page><page sequence="10">1116 Charles G. Leathers cially in his statement that "the Christian principle of brotherhood should logically continue to gain ground at the expense of the pecuniary morals of competitive business" [Veblen 1964, p. 218]. In thinking that he could substitute the instinct of workmanship as the source of the Christian bias for brotherly love, Veblen may have momentarily suc- cumbed to a vision that Bellamy's fictional account of a "great revolu- tion" that included a "great revival" might not be totally unrealistic. If our supposition is correct, however, several additional questions remain to be answered. What immediate factors prompted Veblen to actually put his vision of natural Christianity into words and attempt to link it to his social theory? Why did he subsequently abandon natural Christianity, as its absence in subsequent writings suggests that he did? We will briefly address these two questions, but in admittedly specula- tive fashion. External Factors and the "Christian Morals"Essay The date of publication ( 1910) leads us to suspect that several devel- opments in the early 1 900s probably contributed to Veblen's decision to write the "Christian Morals" essay. The major factor has been noted by Diggins-Weber's thesis on Protestantism and the development of capitalism. But Veblen could have critiqued Weber without revealing any of his own views on the "Christian animus" and capitalism. Two developments in 1907 may have at least marginally contributed to Veb- len's decision to offer an alternative view of Christianity and capital- ism: the Panic of 1907 and the publication of Walter Rauschenbusch's Christianity and the Social Crisis in 1907. How could these two developments have been related to Veblen's "Christian Morals" essay? In commenting on the essay, Dorfman ob- served that "the setting is ostensibly the period of devastation and sub- jection by imperial Rome, but the article reads more like a description of the period of depression after the the panic of 1907" [Dorfman 1966, p. 293]. At approximately the same time, the popular reception of Rau- schenbusch's book brought the Social Gospel movement to a new high: "Coming at a time when the progressive movement was rising in pop- ularity and affecting national legislation, it touched a public which rec- ognized the need for social changes" [Handy 1966, p. 258]. Already stimulated by Weber's thesis to deeper thought on the subject, Veblen may have responded to these two events with uncharacteristic opti- mism. More specifically, he may have concluded that the popularity of Rauschenbusch's book was evidence that his envisioned natural Chris- tianity was a real social phenomenon with increasing strength, and the</page><page sequence="11">Bellamy and Veblen's "Christian Morals" 1117 economic misery of the depression was substantially eroding public faith in the business enterprise system. Veblen's Abandonment of Natural Christianity Critics have noted a number of inconsistencies and contradictions in the "Christian Morals" essay. Criticisms by Diggins are particularly worth reviewing here (see Diggins [1978, p. 135]; see also Riesman [1953, p. 189], and Noble [1958]). The essay amounts to a concession that Veblen would find an "animistic"-inspired principle of brotherly love preferable to a technologically inspired principle of rational calcu- lation that constitutes the "spirit of capitalism." Veblen failed to make it clear whether the early Christians were communalists because they were Christians or vice-versa. Moreover, it conflicts with Veblen's ear- lier argument that competitive exploits developed with the emergence of a monotheistic, patriarchal religion. From the perspective of this article, Diggins's most penetrating criti- cism identifies a contradiction between the worthiness of work in Veb- len's value scheme and the traditional view of work in religion. "Veb- len's sudden discovery of the value of primitive Christianity as a weapon with which to attack modem Protestant morality raises an- other embarrassing question-how to reconcile the 'instinct of work- manship' with the Judeo-Christian tradition of labor as a punishment imposed upon humanity by God because of man's original sin" [Dig- gins, p. 135]. Veblen's failure to mention natural Christianity in his subsequent works suggests that he soon became painfully aware of the inconsisten- cies and contradictions in his argument, but was unable to satisfactorily resolve them. Perhaps the bitterness toward religion revealed in Absen- tee Ownership reflected in part a deep sense of frustration and disillu- sionment arising from his inability to fit a positive form of Christianity into his technocratic vision of the economic world. Notes 1. Diggins has called the "Christian Morals" essay Veblen's "most desperate and inconsistent" [Diggins 1978, p. 135]. 2. Robert T. Handy notes that before 1900 the most widely used term was "Social Christianity." "Social Gospel" became a popular term after 1900. He further notes that the Social Christianity activists included those of a conservative bent who attempted to avoid challenging the dominant indi- vidualism and those of a more radical nature who tended to favor sweeping reconstruction of the socio-economic institutional order. The latter often</page><page sequence="12">1118 Charles G. Leathers referred to themselves as "Christian socialists," although their socialism was usually "mild, evolutionary, and non-doctrinaire" [Handy 1966, p. 5]. 3. Veblen's personal alienation due to his agnosticism is a dominant theme in Leonard S. Silk's play "Veblen." 4. Ministers in the new order who gave sermons over the "telephone" or the "electroscope" were not professionals, but were respected for their wisdom. Bellamy describes them as "prophets, not priests" [Bellamy 1942, p. 261]. Any minister promulgating false ideas would quickly be rejected as a fraud by the highly intelligent listeners. Undoubtedly Bellamy would be dis- mayed to discover that the modem "electronic ministers" were evangelical fundamentalists and that many of them are now using their "TV minis- tries" to promote a political/religious power base. 5. Veblen would not have had an opportunity to read the essay "The Religion of Solidarity," which Bellamy had written as a young man [Bellamy 1955]. This was not published until much later.
