<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE QUESTION OF BLAKE'S HOSTILITY TOWARD THE JEWS BY KAREN SHABETAI When Blake mocks Judaism by invoking a stereotype about the Jewish proboscis-"I always thought Jesus Christ was a Snubby or I should not have worship'd him, if I had thought he had been one of those long spindle nosed rascals"-he was writing in what he thought was the privacy of a notebook.' Blake's most hostile remarks about Jews, in fact, appear where the public presumably was not to be invited. In his works intended for the public, he is more subtle, or at least more obscure, which might explain how Blake's seeming anti-Semitism has managed to fly under critical radar. My own initial sense of Blake and Jews leaned toward an indulgence of Blake, or rationalization of his "lapses." Most of Blake's references to Judaism, including most of his more virulent anti-Jewish remarks, are directed not at Judaism but at other targets such as deism and organized religion. Further, the intolerant attitude implied in Blake's treatment of Judaism is offset by what Northrop Frye calls the "visionary tolerance" of Blake's claim that all religions are one, though what Frye doesn't remark is that by the time of Jerusalem that "One Religion" is called "the Religion of Jesus."2 Other critics point to his more generous moments in works like Jerusalem in which he invites the Jews to convert, as evidence of a positive attitude toward Jews.3 Another reader acknowledges an early ambivalence in Blake towards Judaism that he overcomes, though, the critic laments, Blake "disliked the London Jews."4 One critic remarks that such blatant anti-Semitism in Blake is negated by his more noble moments: "If he criticizes the Jews in the 'Annotations,' a Christian would say that he praises them in "To the Jews."5 Most critics, though, simply ignore the problem; even when examining passages which rage against Judaism, they fail to entertain even the possibility of their anti- Semitism.6 If I do not think that Blake is anti-Semitic, I remain puzzled and disturbed by the many examples of hostility that pepper his works. His position on the Jews tends to be inconsistent if not confused, perhaps because, as one critic speculates, "the Jews qua Jews were irrelevant to Blake, other than as the antagonists of his personal myth of the Christian dialectic."' Such a position rings true, not only because of Blake's ELH 62 (1995) 139-152 g 1995 by The Johns Hopkins University Press 139</page><page sequence="2">confused position but also because Blake's attitude toward Jews is strikingly connected to his attitude toward deism. Blake demonizes deists as well as "false" Christians along with the Jews. This suggests that Blake's seeming anti-Semitism is only a means and not an end. Rather than making Jews a particular target, his primary interest is to justify his version of Christianity. While I find such a position to be consistent with most of what I find in Blake, I do not feel satisfied that this is all there is to the matter. In this article, I will focus on Blake's use of the Jews in his version of salvation history, especially at those moments when his anti- Jewish attitude is most strikingly unBlakean, that is when it exceeds the rhetoric necessary to make his more positive argument about a re- deemed Christianity. Because I will be isolating examples of Judeo- phobic language in this paper, it will have the effect of exaggerating the force of Blake's hostility toward the Jews; still, I believe that these passages deserve closer scrutiny than they have enjoyed. Blake's remarks about Jews fall into three categories. The first reflects Blake's general tolerance toward the beliefs of others as well as his philo- Semitic conversionist rhetoric. The human form that all must love in "Heathen, Turk, and Jew" expresses perhaps the most generous and most familiar Blake. The poet's call for the conversion of the Jews in his address "To the Jews" in Jerusalem is only mildly intolerant. His words invoke the tradition of conversionist philo-Semitism still thriving in England during this period.8 Such an attitude was most prevalent in the years closer to the civil war, but the groups in which it survived in Blake's day would have been those with whom Blake would have had affinities. The expression of millenarian hopes persisted throughout the eighteenth century, especially among but not limited to the sectarian fringe, and millenarian aspirations included a belief that the conversion of the Jews would precede the Second Coming. But while the Jews hold what one historian of Judaism has called an "extraordinarily positive position . .. in one major strain of English religious thought," Blake is frequently hostile toward them.9 There was even fairly recent precedent in Blake's day of philo-Semitism not connected with Jewish conversion; disgust with anti- Semitism is expressed in a series of articles published in The Gentleman's Magazine in the 1770s "attacking the hostile views of Voltaire and the English deists on Judaism, divine revelation and contemporary Jewry."'1 These articles were not written by sectarians, but by those within the Anglican church. I point this out to refute any claim that Blake was simply reflecting the unmitigated hostility toward Jews common in his day. Blake's hostility, even in a nation already remarkable for its examples 140 Blake's Hostility toward the Jews</page><page sequence="3">of philo-Semitism, leads to my second and third categories. The second includes remarks that are certainly intolerant but seem directed against other groups and only condemn the Jews on the way to attacking other more immediate enemies like priestcraft and deism. The third category includes these same attacks when they are in excess of the rhetoric required to level the attack on his ostensible target. This final category also covers gratuitous attacks including negatively charged images of the Jew, such as the vehement, hateful remarks about Jews in Blake's annotations of Watson, as well as the invocation of negative stereotypes, as when Blake calls to Jews to "leave counting gold!" (E, 44), and remarks on their "spindle" noses." The rejection of the idea that Jesus was a Jew reveals a rather eccentric interpretation of the controversy still current in Blake's day about whether Judaism was the basis of Christianity. Even infamous Jew haters conceded that Jesus was Jewish but followed his example in rejecting Judaism. Deists, wanting to undermine the founda- tion of Christianity, attacked Judaism. Blake borrows from each account, worshipping Jesus while attacking Judaism, but goes even further by denying that Christ was a Jew. Such intolerant moments in Blake, however infrequent, rival in their intensity the vituperative attacks against Jews made by traditional Christians attempting conversion, by Sectarians disputing the authentic- ity of the Hebrew Bible, and by deists seeking to discredit Christianity by undermining its source in Judaism. Blake participated in the deist controversy-or what was left of it in his day-as well as debates within Christianity, if only in the privacy of his annotations.'2 Edmund Burke wondered in 1790, "who, born within the last forty years, has read one word" of the deists?'3 Blake of course had. While the influence of such debates on Blake has long been recognized, what hasn't been examined is their particular relevance to Blake's attitude toward Jews. It was in such debates carried out in periodicals, tracts and pamphlets, that Blake's anti-Semitism, perhaps, found its origins. Deists' writings are full of anti-Christian anti-Semitism. Sectarians often railed against the Jews. The mythographers speculated about Jewish origins and fuelled, if unintentionally, debates about the origin and the verity of Judaism and Christianity. Blake dipped into all of these traditions. For instance, Blake's contention-whether he meant it meta- phorically or literally-that all religions originated in England was argued by many of the speculative mythographers, including the well- known Jacob Bryant, whom Blake specifically refers to: "The antiquities of every Nation under Heaven, is no less sacred than that of the Jews. They are the same thing, as Jacob Bryant and all antiquaries have Karen Shabetai 141</page><page sequence="4">proved" (E, 543). Another likely source of these ideas is Richard Brothers, founder of Anglo-Israelism, well-known during Blake's day. If Blake didn't discover him independently, he would have known of him though his friend, the engraver William Sharp.14 Brothers wrote that "the greatest number of the inhabitants of this land (called Great Britain, &amp;c.) are Israelites, of the tribe of Benjamin, that there are some of Judah and some of Levi."'5 The question is asked at the beginning of "To the Jews" in Jerusalem, "Was Britain the Primitive Seat of the Patriarchal Reli- gion?" (E, 171). For Blake, Albion and Jerusalem were one, and "Adam was a Druid, and Noah also" (E, 542). Does Blake mean in particular to challenge the antiquity of the Jews in his remarks on this subject, or is he simply allowing all nations to share this antiquity? The accounts of religions and nations had theological consequences in Blake's day. While not all the speculative mythographers were specifically interested in proving or disproving Christianity, their arguments and speculations were put to the service of those who had such interests. While deism had slipped out of the popular view by Blake's day, for Blake it remained current. For him, being a deist was no small offense, but the range of people he identifies as deist is so large that one must suspect that he has his own particular understanding of deism. Though often railing against deists, it is generally recognized that Blake in fact supports many deist notions: specific ways in which Blake attacks clerical orthodoxy are clearly indebted to deist formulations. Also, he vehe- mently confronts an attacker of a deist in his 1798 annotations to Watson's Apology to the Bible (1796). So while Blake repeatedly attacks deism and the deists, he reveals deist sympathies, most explicitly in his annotations to Watson's Apology, itself an attack on the deist Thomas Paine's The Age of Reason (1794-1795). In those marginalia Blake makes some of his most vehement Judeophobic remarks in terms that greatly resemble what in Blake's times were commonplace attacks on Jews by deists attempting to discredit traditional Christianity. One example, telling both for its exposing of Blake's participation in these debates and for revealing his particular Judeophobic ends, concerns the veracity of Judaism, both as the original monotheism and God's chosen religion. Deists used arguments--often arguments indebted to the speculative mythographers-about the unity of all religions to discredit Judaism. They sought to show, for instance, that other ancient religions practiced monotheism and shared other beliefs that were considered to originate with the Jews. Blake is clearly indebted to these arguments in such works as ALL RELIGIONS are ONE, though he seems to have no intention in this 142 Blake's Hostility toward the Jews</page><page sequence="5">work to comment on Judaism specifically, and instead celebrates the universality of the poetic genius. His claim that the "Jewish &amp; Christian Testaments are An original derivation from the Poetic Genius" (E, 1) is his 1788 answer to the debate about which religion is closest to God; by his later prophecies, his account is less inclusive. But even in his address, "To the Jews" in Jerusalem (1804), he invokes Adam Kadmon of the Jewish Kabbalah (but also found in Jacob Bohme)-"your tradition that Man contained in his Limbs, all Animals"-to maintain again that all religions have a common source, the Giant Albion in this case. Blake writes, "Ye are united O ye Inhabitants of Earth in One Religion" (E, 171). But his next line reveals how far he has moved from the generous tractates of the 1780s; the one religion is "The Religion of Jesus: the most Ancient, the Eternal" (E, 171). Likewise, Blake's views on Jewish prophecy reveal both a deist debt and his own particular anti-Jewish conclusions. Deists attacked the reliability of prophecy recorded in the Old Testament in order to undermine Christianity. In Discourse on the Grounds and Reasons of the Christian Religion (1724), Anthony Collins writes that "if proofs for Christianity from the Old Testament be not valid; if the arguments founded on those books be not conclusive; and the Prophesies cited from thence be not fulfill'd; then has Christianity no just foundation."'l In A Discourse of Free-Thinking (1713), Collins contended that the prophets were social rebels, not mouthpieces of God or predictors of the future. Blake seemed to believe in visions and events at least as fantastic as those of the prophets, relating in everyday terms to Henry Crabb Robinson, for instance, his conversations and arguments with Milton, and angels, among others. When Blake makes the prophet "the voice of honest indignation" (E, 38), and credits prophets with a "firm perswasion" (E, 38, 39), he is both invoking important beliefs of his own and ironizing them in relation to these Jewish prophets. In The Marriage of Heaven and Hell he is equivocal about whether prophets are social rebels, visionaries, or frauds. Isaiah describes his inspiration as Blakean vision- ary perception and social protest: "my senses discover'd the infinite in every thing, and I was then perswaded. &amp; remain confirm'd; that the voice of honest indignation is the voice of God" (E, 38). So far this sounds like the familiar Blake, the visionary with a touch of free- thinking. But in the next section of this Memorable Fancy, prophetic "perswasion" and "perswading" take on other meanings, so that the preceding phrase might be revised as "the voice of dishonest indignation is the voice of the Jewish God." Karen Shabetai 143</page><page sequence="6">Then Ezekiel said. The philosophy of the east taught the first principles of human perception some nations held one principle for the origin &amp; some another, we of Israel taught that the Poetic Genius (as you now call it) was the first principle and all others merely derivative, which was the cause of our despising the Priests &amp; Philosophers of other countries, and prophecying that all Gods would at last be proved, to originate in ours &amp; to be the tributaries of the Poetic Genius, it was this. that our great poet King David desired so fervently &amp; invokes so patheticly, saying by this he conquers enemies &amp; governs kingdoms; and we so loved our God. that we cursed in his name all the deities of surrounding nations, and asserted that they had rebelled. (E, 39) Ezekiel's reference to "the Philosophy of the east" implies that it is prior or at least larger than the religion of Israel. In his account, "Israel" is one nation among others, but the one that comes to be thought the original, through the Jews', especially King David's, "firm perswasion." He then equates "firm perswasion" with armed aggression. Judaism is not, then, original, but achieves priority through "firm perswasion." He claims that Israel's belief in its own priority caused it to "despis[e] Priests &amp; Philosophers of other countries." Further, and more damning, Ezekiel claims that "we"-presumably the prophets-were "prophecying that all Gods would at last be proved to originate in ours." He then calls this the fervent desire of King David, so fervent that "by this he conquers enemies &amp; governs kingdoms." By mentioning a king of Israel and his conquests, Blake is subtly invoking the deist argument that condemns Judaism for its acts of war, specifically justified by being fought in God's name as collaborations between prophets and kings. Blake ironizes "prophecying" and "firm perswasion" by making them Jewish code words for bloody acts of war. "Prophecying that all Gods would at last be proved to originate in ours," Ezekiel recounts, "is come to pass," by "conquer[ing] enemies &amp; govern[ing] kingdoms" (E, 39). Other phrases in this passage suggest this irony, like "and we so loved our God, that we cursed in his name all the deities of surrounding nations." Ezekiel then asserts, "from these opinions the vulgar came to think that all nations would at last be subject to the jews," which he claims "is come to pass," because "like all firm perswasions"-his definition of prophecy-"for all nations believe the jews code and worship the Jews god, and what greater subjection can be?" (E, 39). By the end of this account Blake has not only undermined traditional accounts of prophecy but challenged the originality of Juda- ism and implicitly attacked its means of achieving its present status- 144 Blake's Hostility toward the Jews</page><page sequence="7">however ironic this may sound, given the low status of Jews in Blake's day. Blake concludes this episode, his dinner conversation with Isaiah and Ezekiel, with an allusion to other popular deist attempts to discredit the originality of Judaism by equating the actions of these Jewish prophets with those of the Greeks and the "North American tribes" (E, 39). Again, Blake's desire here is probably to demonstrate the identification of true religions; my point is simply to suggest that he is indebted to deist arguments specifically at moments when he is criticizing Judaism. Attempts by early Church Fathers to explain similarities between Greeks and Jews were "epitomized in the question; had Moses plagiarized Homer or vice-versa?"'7 The Church fathers were attempting, of course, to prove Judaism original, but the deists used such concerns to question the priority of Judaism, attempting to demonstrate that either it was one faith among many or a derivation of more ancient cultures. Travel literature from explorers and missionaries, which included descriptions of religious practices of groups including North American Indians, was seized upon by deists to challenge the originality of the Jews. In "Night the Eighth" of The Four Zoas, completed just before the writing of Jerusalem, Blake offers a particularly startling and original comment on the origins of religions. In this night that culminates in the Crucifixion, Blake describes the re-creation of Natural Religion out of Judaism. The references to Judaism in the account are particularly harsh, an example of my third category: if Blake's ostensible target is not Judaism, he condemns it beyond what is necessary to make his point. What I want to consider here is the covert language associating Jew and Satan, as well as the link between Judaism and deism. Historians of anti- Semitism have contended that "some of the main sources of modern anti-Semitism lie in medieval religious beliefs," which view "Jews as a league of sorcerers employed by Satan for the spiritual and physical ruination of Christendom." Such "demonological superstitions inherited from the Middle Ages," would explain the repeated linking of Jews and Satan.'8 If I am right, then Blake's anti-Jewish sentiments differ greatly from modem anti-Semitism that focuses on "ineradicable ethnic and racial differences between Jews and Gentiles."'9 Historians of Judaism in England have provided ample evidence that such Medieval influences remained in the England of Blake's day. The association between Jew and Satan is one of the features of the following passage: Karen Shabetai 145</page><page sequence="8">The Synagogue of Satan therefore uniting against Mystery Satan divided against Satan resolvd in open Sanhedrim To burn Mystery with fire &amp; form another from her ashes For God put it into their heart to fulfill all his will The Ashes of Mystery began to animate they calld it Deism And Natural Religion as of old so now anew began Babylon again in Infancy Calld Natural Religion. (E, 386) At the end of the eighth night of The Four Zoas, in a particularly odd turn, the "Synagogue of Satan" burns the tree of Mystery-Urizen's tree-thereby creating Natural Religion. Satan decides in "Sanhedri[n]"- that is, the court of the Jews-to re-create deism-Judaism creates Natural Religion.20 Such language also occurs in Blake's preface to chapter three of Jerusalem, "To the Deists." There, he doesn't specifically refer to Judaism, but again associates deism and Judaism: If [Man] has not the Religion of Jesus, he will have the Religion of Satan, &amp; will erect the Synagogue of Satan. calling the Prince of this World, God.... Every Religion that Preaches Vengeance for Sin is the Religion of the Enemy &amp; Avenger ... their God is Satan, Named by the Divine Name. ... This was the Religion of the Pharisees who murderd Jesus. Deism is the same &amp; ends in the same. (E, 201) The claim here appears to be not that all religions are one but that there is only one true religion, the religion of Jesus; the false religions are called deism. The language used to describe deism invokes anti-Jewish rhetoric ("Synagogue of Satan," "Vengeance for Sin," "Satan, Named by the Divine Name" "Religion of the Pharisees who murdered Jesus"). The obvious target is deism but, in indicting it, Blake goes beyond the language of deism by associating it with a Judaism recognizable only through negatively charged terms. Blake, in fact, makes this move in other works as well.21 Is deism a code word for Judaism for Blake or does he invoke Judaism to condemn deism? Or is this an example of the theory of anti-Semitism that claims that the hatred of the Jews has nothing to do with real Jews but makes them representatives of all that is despised in a culture, so that the actual terms of abuse shift with the cultural representations of the alien? If this is the case, then the Jews qua Jews are nothing to Blake but a vehicle for attacking enemies of his Jesus. But Blake's attitude does seem to be more specifically about the Jewish religion than contemporary theory about anti-Semitism would allow. The pervasive figure of Urizen is a case in point. 146 Blake's Hostility toward the Jews</page><page sequence="9">Urizen, a principal actor in these events in The Four Zoas and Jerusalem, epitomizes Blake's attitude toward Judaism. One of Urizen's many roles in Blake is of the God of the Jewish Bible. Urizen is of course a false God for Blake, but the particulars of his character reflect eighteenth-century as well as earlier conceptions of the God of the Jews. "The Jewish conception of God was material, fleshly, anthropomorphic," Frank E. Manuel writes of age-old Christian beliefs.22 Blake emphasizes these qualities in his Urizen when he associates him with rocks ("dim rocks of Urizen," Book of Urizen, E, 71), and when he has him write "the secrets of his wisdom" in "books formd of metals," called "the Book of eternal brass" (E, 72). In The Four Zoas, Urizen, depicted as a material, anthropomorphic God with his religion Judaism becomes, in fact, entangled in the web of a Religion that, because of its material weight, literally falls on him: "the direful Web of Religion; swagging heavy, it fell" (E, 375). The consequences of that fall are then detailed: "till Urizen, / Sitting within his temple, furious, felt the num[m]ing stupor, / Himself tangled in his own net, in sorrow, lust, repentance" (E, 376). It is Urizen's temple-called the "Synagogue of Satan" in the passages from The Four Zoas and Jerusalem quoted above-that links Judaism to Satanism. The phrase Synagogue of Satan, which appears in both of these passages, had particular resonance in Blake's day. The Synagogue of Satan invokes not only the Book of Revelation, where the phrase occurs twice, but also the Jews, as perhaps Revelation's author also intended. It was a phrase used synonymously with Jews in many pamphlets and tracts about various controversies involving the Jews. Perhaps, as S. Foster Damon suggests, Blake is referring to "the worldly church," which is a more immediate target for Blake than the Jews.23 But even granting this best-case scenario, one cannot ignore that he uses specifically Judeo-phobic language. Even Damon's gloss of the term simply as "the school of the Ten Commandments" implicitly acknowl- edges the Jewish connection.24 In fact, in another work, Blake equates "State Religion" with the God of the Jews (E, 615). Blake's most vehement remarks against the Jews appear in his Annotations to Watson's Apology, in defense of the deist Thomas Paine (E, 611-20).25 Blake appears here eager to endorse many of Paine's particulars in his attack on the veracity of the Hebrew Bible. A key argument that captured Blake's attention is restated by Watson as follows: "You hold it impossible that the Bible can be the Word of God, because it is therein said, that the Israelites destroyed the Canaanites by the express command of God" (E, 614). Watson is referring to the episodes in Judges and Kings that detail the massacre of the Canaanites. Karen Shabetai 147</page><page sequence="10">Watson defends the Bible: "I think, it will be impossible to prove, that it was a proceeding contrary to God's moral justice, to exterminate so wicked a people" (E, 614). Blake furiously replies: "God never makes one man murder another nor one nation . . . . the destruction of the Canaanites by Joshua was the Unnatural design of wicked men To Extirpate a nation by means of another is as wicked as to destroy an individual by means of another individual which God considers (in the Bible) as Murder &amp; commands that it shall not be done" (E, 615). Blake then calls Jews "Murderers and Revengers" (E, 615). Watson defends the Bible, though he doesn't comment directly on Paine's Judeo-phobic rhetoric. Blake's virulent attack on the Jews as "liars" wicked, deceitful, "murderers &amp; Revengers," to say nothing of his attacks on Jewish law and Scriptures, upon which he pours more abuse, goes unremarked by scholars. It is odd too that elsewhere Blake explicitly includes Judges and Kings--the specific biblical books that Paine attacks-in his list of inspired or "Spiritual Verse" (E, 196). In other words, one must doubt that Blake's purpose here is simply to challenge the verity of the Hebrew Bible if, in a later work, he specifically singles out these biblical texts as the word of God. This disparity exemplifies my third category of Blake's anti-Jewish remarks. Blake both exceeds in language and argument what would have been necessary to make his point in defense of Paine. In these same annotations, Blake replicates-though with less subtlety and humor-his own argument in The Marriage, discussed earlier, in which he recounts the origin of the belief in the Jews as chosen people. In The Marriage, Blake wonders "What greater subjection can be" (E, 39), than the belief that the Jews are chosen by God. Blake calls the Jews "liars" for claiming to converse with God in the Watson annotations. But, he contends, and this underlines what was so subtle in The Marriage, "God does &amp; always did converse with honest Men" (E, 615). In other words, Blake explicitly denies that the Jewish prophets spoke with God but claims that God does speak to "honest men." Blake reasserts his objection to the Jews as chosen when he next rails against Jews for "assum[ing] a right &lt;Exclusively&gt; to the benefits of God" (E, 615).26 The Hebrew Bible, elsewhere called inspired and "True," is described in his Watson annotations as "an example of the possibility of Human Beastli- ness in all its branches" (E, 614). He insists that Jesus could not have been a Jew: "Christ died as an Unbeliever" (E, 614). In the exasperation of his hatred in these passages, Blake doesn't mind contradicting himself to aid Christ in "abolish[ing] the Jewish Imposture" (E, 614-15). The notion of the Jewish imposture brings me back to Blake's quip about Jewish noses with which I began. There too Blake rejects the Jewish 148 Blake's Hostility toward the Jews</page><page sequence="11">imposture, rejecting the idea that Jesus was a Jew (a "long spindle nosed rascal"). Even if most of Blake's references to Jews and Judaism reflect attitudes that would have been available if not commonplace in his day, a reader of Blake would expect him to protest against religious bigotry. There would have been plenty of precedent in England for a philo- Semitic attitude-Henry Crabb Robinson prides himself "for how early I embraced liberal opinions concerning Judaism"-whereas Blake ap- pears at best uninterested in the "Jewish question," and at worst hostile toward both the religion and its followers.27 The remark by one critic that Blake wasn't especially interested in Jews rings true, despite the fact of his repeated rhetorical attacks. For one thing, his attacks appear some- what contradictory-moderately philo-Semitic to virulently anti-Semitic. Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno stressed the "blindness and lack of purpose of anti-Semitism," finding that "there is no genuine anti- Semitism" for often its targets "are interchangeable according to circum- stances.2"" This understanding of anti-Semitism comes close to what occurs in Blake. Blake's shifting attitude, marked by shrill moments of intense hostility, bespeaks at the very least classic symptoms of anti- Semitism ranging from demonological superstitions inherited from the Middle Ages to resentment and anxiety about the Jews as the chosen people. More important, Blake's anti-Semitism, while greatly at odds with his largely humanitarian program, casts a shadow-a haunting specter, perhaps-upon this received wisdom.29 University of Washington NOTES I am grateful to Andrew Parker, who accepted an early version of this paper for his MLA panel on Romanticism and anti-Semitism (1992).

Bogan follows Desiree Hirst's lead that Blake was probably influenced by the Anglican clergyman Richard Clarke, especially in his format of prefaces in Jerusalem. Bogan applauds Blake for not following Clarke's lead in insulting the Jews while calling for their conversion. His main evidence is the absence of Clarke's negative rhetoric and Blake's complimenting the Jews for their humility. Blake often questions the value of humility, such as in The Everlasting Gospel, where he praises Karen Shabetai 149</page><page sequence="12">Jesus for his "triumphant Pride," not his humility (E, 518-19, 520). Bogan claims that Blake means humility in a positive sense as defined by Lavator, but he gives no reason why the reader should be certain of this (117-18).

When Blake says Jews, Erdman says "London merchants"; counting gold becomes the trade of banking, and returning to oil and wine is glossed as a return to the exchange of useful commodities: "When Blake urges the London merchant to turn from banking to the exchange of useful commodities" (226). 7 Spector (note 5), 219 nl6. While speculations about Blake's attitude toward Jews is, she claims, beyond the scope of her study of Blake as a Hebraist, she intimates that she doesn't view Blake as anti-Semitic if only because he appears to have little interest in "Jews qua Jews." It is not much of a jump, using the evidence that Spector herself provides, to see Blake sharing the anti-Semitic attitude of the eighteenth-century Hebraists. See my review of her piece in Blake: An Illustrated Quarterly 25 (1991). Spector's work is an excellent original consideration of Blake in contexts relevant to his attitude toward Jews, even if such conclusions are not her aim. " See Todd M. Endelman's "Philo-Semitism in Anglo-Christianity," in The Jews of Georgian England, 1714-1830: Tradition and Change in a Liberal Society (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of" America, 1979), 50-85. 9 Endelman (note 8), 56. 10 Endelman, 97. 11 While the stereotype of' the "grasping Jewish Usurers" predates Blake by several centuries, Endelman notes that this particular characterization of the Jew "gained in popularity" during this period (103-4). 12 Not only Blake's works, but also remarks recorded by Henry Crabb Robinson, show Blake to appear much less eccentric in the context of' religious thinkers, deists or Christians, than in the literary company in which he is found in bookstores and course syllabi. Even when responding to the poems of Wordsworth his critique is theological, not literary; he objects to the notion of "natural piety" because, he says, "The Natural Man is at Enmity with God" (E, 665). His target here of course is natural religion or deism. 13 Edmund Burke, Reflections on the Revolution in France (New York: Macmillan, 1987), 107. 14 See Michael Ferber's discussion of Blake and "respectable and secular dissent," in chapter 2 of The Social Vision of William Blake (Princeton: Princeton Univ.

Manuel writes: "While both Toland and Collins labored to dismiss the worth of Old Testament prophecy and miracles, they betrayed no particular animus against the Jews living in England in their day. In fact, Toland was intent upon granting them naturalization and wrote the most psychologically acute analysis of Judeophobia in the eighteenth century, Reasons for Naturalizing the Jews in Great Britain and Ireland on the Same Foot with All Other Nations. Containing Also, a Defence of the Jews against All Vulgar Prejudices in All Countries (1714)" (186-87). I cite this long passage to make the point that there were prominant examples of philo-Semitism in the eighteenth century. 17 Manuel (note 16), 178. 1" The quoted passages are from Norman Cohn, Warrant for Genocide: The Myth of Jewish World Conspiracy and the Protocols of the Elders of Zion (New York: Harper and Row, 1967), 15-16, quoted by Robert Casillo, The Genealogy of Demons: Anti-Semitism, Fascism, and the Myths of Ezra Pound (Evanston: Northwestern Univ. Press, 1988), 51. 19 Casillo (note 18), 52. 20 That these events are determined in Sanhedrin point to another enemy for Blake: Mosaic law. One well known sectarian in Blake's day suggested that natural religion is the source of' Mosaic law, connecting natural religion and Judaism, as Blake does in the passage from "Night the Eighth" quoted above. Though not in order to make this particular connection, Leslie Tannenbaum (Biblical Tradition in Blake's Early Prophe- cies: The Great Code ofArt [Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1982]) quotes the line from Warburton-"The Mosaic Religion was a REPUBLICATION of natural Religion to the Jews"-as a possible source in "The song of Los" for the introduction of Mosaic law (487). Tannanbaum explains, "According to Blake, Moses delivered Israel from the bondage of' Egypt only to impose upon his people the bondage of moral and ceremonial law, which he had actually taken from the Egyptians" (188). Blake, then, turns Warburton's account to his own end: to condemn Mosaic law as bondage. This idea is central throughout Blake, and is implicit in such attitudes in Blake as his rejection of the letter for the spirit of the law. Warburton is one of the few participants in the deist debates to defend Jews as Jews and not just to defend the foundation of' Christianity. One of his headings in The Divine Legation is the Jews "vindicated from the calumnious falsehoods of the poet Voltaire." Sir Leslie Stephen quotes one instance of Warburton's response to a "statement of Voltaire's about the Jewish hostility to the human race": "I think it will not be easy to find, even in the dirtiest sink of freethinking, so much falsehood, absurdity, and malice heaped together in so few words" (Quoted by Stephens, English Thought in the Eighteenth Century, 2 vols. [London: John Murray, 1927], 1:346, 1:352). Stephen's intention is not to defend the Jews against Voltaire but Voltaire against Warburton. 21 A study on anti-Jewish sentiment in eighteenth-century England lists the phrase "Synagogue of Satan" as a "commonly used epithet" in anti-naturalization literature culminating in the repeal of the Jew Bill of 1753 (three years before Blake was born). See "Anti-Jewish Sentiment-Religious and Secular," chapter 3 in Endelman (note 8), for a discussion of the anti-Jewish propaganda in the Jew Bill controversy, especially 88-89. In a deleted line early in "Night the Eighth" of The Four Zoas Blake equates Urizen's temple with the Synagogue of Satan: "which join'd to Urizen's temple / Which is the Synagogue of Satan" (E, 840). Blake repeatedly identifies Urizen with the God of the Hebrew Bible. Also in Milton, Satan is worshipped in a synagogue "under the Unutterable Name" (E, 104) a reference to the name of God that the Jews were forbidden to pronounce. 22 1 am quoting from Manuel's invaluable book, The Broken Staff (note 16), 186. 2:3 Damon (note 4), 395.

The best study of Blake's annotations, which is especially fair to Watson, is Florence Sandler's "'Defending the Bible,' Blake, Paine, and the Bishop on the Atonement," in Blake and his Bibles (note 5). While providing the context for the annotations, Sandler doesn't mention the seeming anti-Semitism of Blake's remarks. 26 Oddly, though, he adds "&amp; the same will be [of] against Christians," suggesting that Blake's real target is not the Jews "exclusively" but what they have come to represent for him (E, 615). 27 Robinson, Diary, Reminiscences and Correspondence of Henry Crabb Robinson, ed.
