<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS I 2 5 SHORTER NOTICES HUMANISM AND AMERICA. Edited by Norman Foerster. New York: Farrar &amp; Rinehart, I930. The ethical content of literary Humanism, reflected in this symposium, is familiar. It rests on an ancient dualism ("a law for man and a law for things"), and turns on an axis of two questionable theological dicta: the myth of the fall of man, and the dogma of grace. In brief, it uses "selective emphasis" to bring forth the metaphysical concept of free will, and to press it into ethical service. Free will ("the will to restraint") is the basis of the specifically human in man, and it lifts him from the naturalistic to the humanistic and religious planes of conduct. This attitude is fortified by a misappropriation of the word "Human- ism," and an arrogant assumption of comradeship with sages and writers rang- ing from Confucius and Buddha to our own James Russell Lowell. The main bases of the movement are the sacred writings of the East, Classical Greece, neo-Classical France, and our calvinized New England. With these aids, it seeks to make "humane letters" the center of gravity in education, talks dryly and polysyllabically of decorum, common sense, and common decency, and erects an unlubricated machine of judgments which grinds out all warmth and positive enjoyment from human action. Its preachment is largely negative (as if all ethical conduct were a forlorn prescription of denial); it defines prac- tically all modern attempts at readjustment invidiously as humanitarianism, and it displays a profound misapprehension of the nature of social forces, the import of the scientific method, and the hope of a scientific realignment of so- cial institutions (for the economic naivete of Dr. Babbitt, see his Democracy and Leadership, p. i98). Back of it all is the old human desire to rest on couches of easy certainties, to organize existence on a basis of personal prejudice, where- by this organization is transmuted suddenly into the only picture of "reality." This symposium is open to other criticisms: its use of the technique of the religious revival, its arrogance, and its general toryism. The influence of Babbitt and More is apparent in practically all the con- tributors. Many of them are middle-aged professors of literature; one is an advanced poet signing his death warrant in political fascism, royalism, and orthodox religion; another is a New York "literary stockbroker," Mr. Gorham B. Munson; a third is Louis Trenchard More, whose writings offered Bryan aid and abettance at Dayton, Tennessee. The symposium also raises a number of questions concerning literary criticism and aesthetics, but these are irrelevant in this Journal. JAMES T. FARRELL PLATO AND His CONTEMPORARIES. By G. C. Field. London: Methuen, I930. Large 8vo. Pp. 242+Index. Price, I2s. 6d. net. Professor G. C. Field of the University of Bristol, England, is already well known for valuable work on ethical theory. In this new book he surveys a wider field, for the advantage of those who are beginning to study general philosophy. It is in the best tradition of British scholarship. The personality</page><page sequence="2">I26 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS of Plato stands out clearly; and the circumstances of his life are very well ren- dered. The philosophy of Plato is not discussed at length; but perhaps it is all the more useful that those who propose to study that philosophy should see it in its setting. The danger of most ethical and metaphysical commentary on Plato is that it tends to modernize the problems and the conclusions of Plato. Professor Field's book will be useful in correcting such mistakes as arise from a too abstract view of the history of philosophy. C. D. B. MORAL SENSE. By James Bonar. London: Allen &amp; Unwin, Library of Philos- ophy. Large 8vo. Pp. 304+Index. Price, I 2s. 6d. net. Dr. Bonar's well-known work on the relation between philosophy and eco- nomic science is now followed, after many years, by these studies in the theory of the "moral sense" as expounded by Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, Hume, Adam Smith, and some minor writers. The studies are short and clear. They give an admirable summary of eighteenth-century British ethical theories: and the last chapter gives us Kant's criticism of the theory of moral sense. An Appendix, in the form of a Platonic dialogue between Shaftesbury and an admirer, gives Dr. Bonar an opportunity of putting the case for those graces and talents which were somewhat neglected by theorists. Dr. Bonar is a skilled commentator. He gives us the true color of the time of which he writes. C. D. B. RENASCENT INDIA. By K. S. Venkataramani. Madras: Svetaranya Ashrama Mylapore. 2d ed., I929. Pp. I05. Price, One Rupee. Whither the Indian Renaissance? Will it be whirlwind or rain? Urged on by material hunger and a longing for freedom it is a creative urge in need of the wisest direction. The ideal is the decentralization of government and the achievement of an autonomous, self-sufficient, simple life in the idealized Indian village, with federation in concerted enterprises. There are great obstacles, agricultural indebtedness, illiteracy, military expenditure, high cost of present administration, heavy taxation, and the perpetuity of small holdings. But their surmounting rests upon the solution of a higher problem, "the emergence of a full, well-regulated and active life from the illusions of a quietistic philosophy, from dreams of virtue to the practice of it in daily social life." A model "swaraj constitution for India" is offered and a "programme of rural reconstruction." The new order will require a "new sanyasin order of men," public servants who combine a high degree of culture, gentility and character with non-ownership of property. Within the structure of this Utopia renascent India will be free, out of its creative energies to make distinctive contribution to the higher life of mankind. This notice cannot do justice to the exquisite literary beauty with which the author's idealism is expressed. C. H. HAMILTON</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS I 2 7 FROM ORPHEUS TO PAUL: A HISTORY OF ORPHISM. By Vittorio D. Macchioro. New York: HenryHolt&amp;Co.,I930. Pp.262. Price,$3.00. Orphism is here set by a historical student in the midst of the vast and murky sea of "primitive mentality." Almost half the book is given over to proving the primitiveness of Orphism (its "collective ecstasy," its "collective commu- nism," its doctrine of "spiritual rebirth"); and the other half to proving its dis- tinctiveness. Orphism is described as being of Thracian origin, indifferent to Hellenic state religions, and as alien to the Greek spirit in general. And yet it captured Pythagoreanism, heavily influenced many of the pre-Socratic philos- ophers, Heraclitus notably, and flowered in the mystic side of Plato. Chris- tianity as Paulinism is Orphic mythology point for point with hardly more than a change of name for the hero. The similarity is so great that Justin Martyr thought it "not convenient to pass over in silence a fact which might deeply affect the faith of Christians, and he therefore explained the points of connec- tion between Zagreus and Christ by supposing that the commentators of an- cient poets, having known through prophets the future advent of the Savior, invented the myth of Zagreus in order to make people consider the Savior him- self as a mythical person." Orphism, indeed, emerges from this treatment as "the mediator between the Jewish revival of Jesus and the Greek world." Let one not look for rigorous proof of this thesis or of any of the sub-theses that ornament the pages of this book. Here, in spite of footnotes and other para- phernalia of proof, all is suggestion, analogy, allusion. But of such stuff is made the history of semihistoric times. The book, though popular in form if not also padded in content, will pass for interesting if not for brilliant historic specula- tion. It preserves permanently the first series of Schermerhorn Lectures in Religion at Columbia University. T. V. S. PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION. By Clement C. J. Webb. Oxford Univer- sity Press, I929. Pp. ii8+Index. Price, $2.00. We have here an estimate of the religious philosophy of the celebrated Cath- olic apologist and supposedly great French philosopher by one who claims no particular enthusiasm or interest other than that of setting forth an impartial interpretation. Though a man of science, a saint, mathematical and religious genius, Pascal is hardly a philosopher and certainly no systematic thinker. Though he re- flected deeply and widely on life he evinced no such interest in questions which have troubled the minds of our great philosophers. By training, temperament and circumstance, he lacked the qualifications which mark out the philosopher's path. His writings reveal how ill-equipped he was in philosophical and theolog- ical literature. The distrust and subjugation of his keen rational insights and fine moral intuitions in favor of an ecclesiastical tradition together with a patho- logical and morbid outlook (cf. his Pense'es) prevented that freedom of in- quiry and hunger after truth for truth's sake which mark out the true philo-</page><page sequence="4">I28 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS sophical minds. Rent asunder by the enigmatic and paradoxical character of his own nature, he sought refuge in the traditional Augustinian theology which resolved the conflict for him in a reassuring soteriology. Hating the body, con- demning the self and all human nature, chiding human reason, placing under suspicion any so-called revelations in nature, affirming utter depravity and the impotence of the will for any good, he found peace and saintliness in complete acquiescence to an all-sufficient divine grace to which le coeur and not la raison gave its warm approval. Over against Pascal, the author sets up some contrasting views contained in the ethical and religious philosophies of such men as Descartes, Voltaire, Kant, Butler, Otto, and others, which makes this study especially valuable to the spe- cial student. VERGILIUS FERM THE JACK-ROLLER: A DELINQUENT Boy's OWN STORY. By Clifford R. Shaw. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, I930. Pp. XiV+205. Price, $2.50. This volume represents the first of a series of detailed case studies of young male delinquents as a part of the program of sociological research at the Insti- tute for Juvenile Research and Behavior Research Fund at Chicago. Of largest interest in the book is the autobiography of a Chicago boy whose official record of arrests and commitments, beginning when he was six years of age, covers four pages, thirty-eight items, before he was out of his seventeenth year. The story enables the reader to look at that record and all that it involves, from the boy's point of view. But of largest significance is the analysis on the part of the editor-author of the boy's case and of the "own story" technique as sociological and moral methodology. Professor Ernest W. Burgess, of the University of Chicago, in a Preface, claims for the life-history technique in sociology the same pivotal place as the microscope has held in biological sciences. Even those who dispute that claim will after sober second thought find it harder to dispute the moral drawn by the boy from his own experiences: "Society can force chil- dren into correctional institutions but it cannot force them to reform. In order to reform a boy you have to change his spirit, not break it, and only sympathetic treatment will do that." His moral is illustrated by the close of his story at twenty-two as a socially oriented person on the road to a conventional success. T. V. S. THE INFLUENCE OF CHRIST IN THE ANCIENT WORLD. By T. R. Glover. New Haven: Yale University Press, I929. Pp. I22. Price, $I.50. A delightful and most illuminating tour amidst the social, political, philo- sophical and religious life of the historic Mediterranean world in the company of a seasoned and celebrated guide and interpreter is offered in this book of a couple of hours' reading. One feels that back of these pages of so much inter- pretative insight and set forth with such elegant style are years of painstaking scholarship and wide cultural contacts.</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS I29 There is one main thesis in the book around which so many contributory illustrations and reflections revolve, viz., that the uniqueness of Christ's Chris- tianity and the reason for its triumphant march down through the centuries are to be found in its liberating power over the human mind. It has stabilized that mind without sterilizing it; it has given to it the benedicton of self-develop- ment in the face of cruel social cultures which have wholly or in part aimed at its subjugation; it has extended that benediction beyond the limits of the so- cially elect. Once understood and realized, man has emerged, though not with- out terrific struggle, from the innumerable bondages set up by social habits into a new sense of life and power and with a totally new sense of perspective. Why did this religion succeed in that ancient world in the face of so many religious and secular cultures? The answer: it had to offer what men needed most of all and what others had failed to give-a new freedom licensed only by a new per- spective. It is in the light of this principle that any Christian ethic is to be constructed; that any Christian society is to be molded; that any Christian thought about life and its mysteries is to be held; that any so-called Christian institutions and practices are to be evaluated; and, similarly, any adequate historical interpretation of the phenomenal rise and development of the religion of the Galilean is to be understood. The author's concrete illustrations setting forth the working-out of this principle amidst the cultural framework of that ancient world are truly remarkable. VERGILIUS FERM EMERSON AND ASIA. By Frederic Ives Carpenter. Cambridge: Harvard Uni- versity Press, I930. Pp. Xiii+282. Price, $3.00. Done originally as a doctoral dissertation at the University of Chicago, this volume is valuable both for those who seek to understand the mind of Emerson and for those who are interested in ideological migrations. It is obvious to any reader of Emerson that he found differentially seductive the names and ideas and lore of the East, but now for the first time we have in a single volume a careful study of the rise and function of this seduction as revealed by a careful study of his total literary output. Written so as to be intelligible for every in- terested reader, this book will be read with profit by scholars also; for it focuses a new light upon Emerson as poet and thinker. The influence of the East upon him and his use of its lore is developed through these successive chapters: "The Undiscovered Country," "Mine Asia," "The Neo-Platonists-Forerunners," "Neo-Platonism," "The Wisdom of the Brahmins," "Persian Poetry," "Arabian Literature and the Koran," "The Zoroastrian Forgeries," "Confucius and China," "Emerson, Asia, and Modern America." Emerson emerges from this study not only more fully understood but also more fully appreciated as a seminal thinker in many fields. There is an Appendix listing chronologically all the oriental titles appearing in Emerson's annual reading lists. T. V.

Price, $2.50. Written in the manner and from the point of view of literary criticism, this book draws from sources much wider than those ordinarily consulted by the literary critic. It is a sympathetic account of what are regarded our weak as well as our strong points. The author is proud of his country, looks at its prom- ise as well as at its achievement, and in the dedication of this book to his chil- dren calls them "fortunate that they may live to see wonderful things in Amer- ica." In all truth he is kind to the point of being apologetic; but it is evident, too, that his mood renders him sensitive to many things frequently overlooked by both native and foreign critics. He sees, as the title indicates, the spirit of the pioneer still at work in multifarious forms in our contemporary life, but notably in the business man who combines humanity and efficiency. The chap- ter on "A New Type of Business Man" is almost certainly a too rosy rendering of contemporary industrialists, but it presents an undeniably legitimate and refreshing point of view. "The Other Side of Main Street" has the grace to render for other towns and communities what most men feel toward their own, with a reassuring picture thrown in of the author's own city, Nashville. There are, after all, worse indulgencies than seeing the good side of things. But the temper of the book is best caught in the discussion of the golden mean as itself a venture. Between "the jesters" and the superpatriots and apologists the au- thor thinks to find his way to an evaluation of the spirit of America the more sane because it looks to possibilities as well as to actualities. He sees in coura- geous liberalism a new religion of life that can be proclaimed from the pulpit as well as practiced in the daily relations of men. T. V. S. ABOVE POMPEII. By Ernest Hatch Wilkins. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, I930. Pp. "x+73. Nine brief essays and a sonnet form the letter of this booklet. But its spirit -that's a longer story, of another kind. "The future, far longer, far more im- portant, than the past, is past-given, but it must not be past-bound"; this, the burden of the first essay, from which the title is taken (an essay published ear- lier in this Journal under the title "Past and Future: An Ethical Perspective"), is also the golden thread which makes the essays into a book. If, through com- mending the pregnant brevity illustrated here by the President of Oberlin College, one could inculcate a similar manner of speech and writing in all those who address college audiences, the public side of college life in America would be immeasurably improved. Especially to be noted in this Journal are the essays "Truth Increasing," "Art as Spiritual Energy," and "Liberalism." The book has already been, and is here again, nominated for a place among the fifty best books of the year from the point of view of book-making. Mens sana in cor- pore sano. T. V. S.</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVIEWS II A COLLEGE MAN'S RELIGION. By E. M. Waits. Fort Worth, Texas: Stafford- Lowdon, I929. PP. 4i8. Price, $2.00. This book contains thirty-odd lectures, addresses, and studies that have grown out of a Christian denominational college presidency. President Waits boldly burned "the barrel of sermons" carried by him from the pulpit to the presidency many years ago, and set out to tread the conceptual divide between fundamentalism and modernism and thus keep touch with the college genera- tion passing before him. In these inspirational addresses may be judged the measure of his success. Even the linguistic strategy which such an audacious task imposes must be of high order. The pervading genius of this strategy may be divined from the following description of the attitude toward heaven of the "college man" (St. Paul) whose religion gives title to the book: "He did not look forward to a heaven that Frederic Harrison cynically described as 'a future of ceaseless psalmody, a vacuous eternity of harp and tabor, a dythyrambic hypothesis of evasive tropes and metaphors,' but a place where our dreams shall be realized, where our hopes shall be fulfilled, where all that is dark shall be made plain." T. V. S. THE MEANING OF MYSTICISM. By Woodbridge Riley. New York: Richard R. Smith, Inc., I930. Pp. I02. Price, $I.25. This little book will serve to correct the popular impression which confuses mysticism with the mysterious and the occult, and makes people victims of pseudo-mystics who try to exploit mysticism commercially by giving lessons or selling books on how to strengthen the will, and gain peace, power, and money through mystical repose. On the contrary, true mysticism is shown to be a work of art. It is a "lyric strain," "a reaction from the head to the heart," the "dialectic of the feeling." The three stages in the mystic ladder are the purga- tive, the illuminative, and the unitive. Mysticism is characterized by the four marks noted by William James in the Varieties of Religious Experience-in- effability, poetic [apparently a misprint for noetic] quality, transience, and passivity. What these phrases mean is not explained, however, and will hardly become clear to the reader by the numerous quotations from ancient pagan, ancient, medieval, and modern Catholic, and modern German, British, and American Protestant mystics, which constitute the bulk of the volume. W. K. WRIGHT CONSTRUCTION AND CRITICISM. By John Dewey. New York: Columbia Uni- versity Press, I930. Pp. 25. Price, $0.75. This is the first Davies Memorial Lecture for the Institute of Arts and Sci- ences, delivered February 25, I930. It develops the interrelation between creation and criticism. Mr. Dewey finds significant originality in every child, and wonders why it gets so easily daunted and lost in the process of growing up. He suspects that the explanation lies in the fact that the various agencies of culture train rather than educate the child and the man who the child becomes.</page><page sequence="8">I32 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS The way to avoid this sacrifice of the unique is for all the forces that make for education to become self-conscious and critical of the role they play. But con- sidering institutional lag and the poor beginning that every age must therefore make, the only way this fluidity can come about is for every individual to sup- plement and protect his creative side by a skeptical attitude toward all that he accepts. There is no real conflict between creation and criticism. Indeed, "creative activity is our great need; but criticism, self-criticism, is the road to its release." T. V. S. PHILOSOPHY WITHOUT METAPHYSICS. By Edmond Holmes. London: Allen &amp; Unwin, I930. PP. I75. Price, 7S. 6d. net. After writing several "uplift" books, Mr. Holmes has turned to a few books on philosophy and found himself troubled by Bradley's Logical Metaphysics, Alexander's Empirical Metaphysics and by the Supernaturalism, Materialism, and Agnosticism which he calls Popular Metaphysics. In place of them all he will set Intuitional Philosophy which allows due weight to feeling and to that childlike innocence which grasps the whole truth and sees that the ideal is real. In spite of some acute remarks here and there, the book contains plenty of metaphysics even if rather superficial, and hasty thinking allows most of it to be omitted. Really another uplift book. E. F. METTRICK THE MODERN STATE. By R. M. MacIver. Oxford University Press, I930. Pp. xii+5o4. Price, $4.50. Continued demand for The Modern State has resulted in this college edition of it, with content the same as before but price somewhat lower. It is enough to say in welcoming the new edition that many readers, in college and out, have found in Professor MacIver's treatise a well-balanced, highly informed, and notably dynamic account of the modern state-its genesis, its nature, its func- tions. T.V. S. SAMKHYA AND MODERN THOUGHT. By J. Ghosh. Calcutta: College Square Book Co., Ltd., I930. Pp. iii+I4I. Convinced that only an external Indian culture will arise from neglect by In- dian scholars of their own literary and moral sources, Professor Ghosh attempts in this small volume to call attention to the significance for modern life of one indigenous classic, Samkklya. He finds the keystone of its significance in its theory of causality. A gloomy view is taken of natural life. Man's only hope is emancipation through knowledge, and the knowledge to be emphasized partakes more of rigorous common sense than of mystical absorption. T. V.

PHILOSOPHY BY WAY OF THE SCIENCES. By Ray H. Dotterer. New York: Mac- millan Co., I929. PP. xv+469. Though the first of these books is intended as a text for a course in orienta- tion and logic and the second as a text in a course on the problems of philosophy, either is admirably fitted to be the basis for an introductory course in philos- ophy. The first section of each volume is devoted to a survey of the results of the special sciences; and each volume covers, however briefly, most of the main problems of philosophy. There are, however, considerable differences both in content and in method of approach. Professor Dotterer gives little attention to logic, as distinguished from theory of knowledge, whereas a good third of The Fields and Methods of Knowledge is devoted explicitly to logic and much of the remaining material is presented from the point of view of logic. Indeed, this book contains one of the most competent brief treatments of logic and logical problems to be found anywhere. The two books differ further in that The Fields and Methods of Knowledge attempts to give the student a brief account of ex- isting knowledge in regard to man and the universe regardless of how much of such an account constitutes philosophy, whereas Philosophy by Way of the Sci- ences proposes to introduce students to philosophical problems. This difference in approach may be illustrated by reference to the fact that Professor Dotterer divides his review of the sciences into "achievements" and "perplexities," such division being based, in part at least, on the doctrine that problems not solved, or unsolvable, by science, are philosophical problems. Which approach is pre- ferred is perhaps a matter of taste. Both books are sufficiently impartial to rec- ommend themselves regardless of the particular philosophical persuasion of the reader; but for purposes of classification it may be desirable to say that Philosophy by Iray of the Sciences is realistic and somewhat naturalistic, while in The Fields and Methods of Knowledge faint odors, subtly mingled, of idealism and instrumentalism may be detected. CHARNER M. PERRY A WORLD COMMUNITY. By John Herman Randall. "World Unity Library Se- ries." Frederick A. Stokes Co., I930. Pp. XVii+294. Price, $2.50. NATIONALISM AND INTERNATIONALISM. By Herbert Adams Gibbons. "World Unity Library Series." Frederick A. Stokes Co., I930. Pp. Xi+270. The first of these volumes serves as the introductory volume of the "World Unity Library Series," a series having as its purpose "a free discussion of those facts, conditions and principles which afford a sound basis of hope for the tri- umph of the spirit of co-operation as the organic truth of human life." In A World Community Mr. Randall surveys the changes in the economic and social order resulting in recent generations from improvements in means of communi- cation and from the industrial revolution, arriving at the conclusion that man-</page><page sequence="10">I34 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS kind faces greater and more deadly wars unless men and peoples can "achieve a degree of co-operation in the life of nations that has never yet been tried." Then, after stating briefly the chief steps involved in the attainment of world- unity, he outlines some of the obstacles, such as nationalism and economic im- perialism, and finally indicates the progress that has been made in political and economic co-operation. Nationalism and Internationalism has a brief concluding chapter on the de- velopment of international co-operation since the war, but the major portion of the book is an account of the development of nationalism and of its influence, sometimes beneficent, sometimes not, in recent history. While the author points out that appeals to nationalism have often been misused by diplomats, he con- cludes that "the hope of internationalism lies in nationalism," and that "interna- tional co-operation has best been exemplified in the world so far by practical achievements of countries with a vigorous national life." CHARNER M. PERRY CHARACTER BUILDING FOR JUNIOR-HIGH-SCHOOL GRADES. By Elvin H. Fish- back. Boston: D. C. Heath &amp; Co., I930. Pp. Vii+232. Made up of simple problems, suggestions for discussion, and brief selections from exhortative verse and fiction, this volume attempts to persuade children to safeguard their health, to be socially helpful, to get an education, and to play the game of life according to the rules. CHARNER M. PERRY CONDUCT PROBLEMS FOR JUNIOR-HIGH-SCHOOL GRADES. By Elvin H. Fishback and Edwin A. Kirkpatrick. D. C. Heath &amp; Co., I930. Pp. 6o. The authors present here a textbook of fifty problem-situations in ethical theory. The exercises cover some thirty-three moral qualities, e.g., Courage, Kindness, Loyalty, Thrift, etc. The exercises are constructed on a uniform plan: an outline of some episode or situation involving a concrete moral problem; and a set of questions based on the incident, to be answered by the pupil. The ques- tions are framed so as to bring to the surface some of the unsuspected ethical implications of everyday living, and to test the pupil's judgment in such matters. It is not easy to see how the answers can be graded and evaluated. A. C. HOBBES: SELECTIONS. Edited by F. J. E. Woodbridge. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, I930. Pp. 4i8+xxx. This recent addition to Scribner's series of selections from the writings of the major philosophers is similar in form to its predecessors, comprising an In- troduction, a Bibliography of primary and secondary sources, and some four hundred pages of material chosen from Hobbes' own books. This new number should prove valuable. Its contents are drawn from the De Corpore and the Leviathan, but Professor Woodbridge has supplemented the passages from these works by copious extracts, in the form of footnotes, from Hobbes' other books. This gives the little volume a range which a mere reprint of the Levi-</page><page sequence="11">BOOK REVIEWS I35 athan would not have had. It should help to dispel the notion that Hobbes begins and ends with what is, in fact, only his major political treatise. In the editor's words, "The selections in this volume are so arranged that the reader can follow through Hobbes' system from the logic to the politics after the man- ner he himself conceived it." One reader, at least, is disappointed in the Introduction. Several of the introductory essays in this series have been little masterpieces of orientation and perspective. Professor Woodbridge has written only seventeen small pages; and of these, nine are biographical. There is little attempt to "place" Hobbes in his times, politically or intellectually. There is less attempt to relate the selections which follow to the general context of Hobbes' philosophy. The charm with which Professor Woodbridge writes, and his obvious familiarity with Hobbes' aims and ideas, only serve to increase the regret created by the tantalizing thumb-nail sketch which he has given us. ALBUREY CASTELL OUR KNOWLEDGE OF OTHER MINDS: A STUDY IN MENTAL NATURE, ExIST- ENCE AND INTERCOURSE. By W. Wylie Spencer. New Haven: Yale Univer- sity Press, I930. PP. I45. It is refreshing to come upon a little book which deals with the mind in the manner of a medieval thesis. This essay considers the problem of our knowl- edge of other minds. It is two-fold: How do we come to know that other minds exist? How can we prove that other minds exist? The author calls the first the psychological problem and the second the logical problem; and devotes five readable chapters to reviewing and rejecting the arguments advanced by Alexander, Balfour, Broad, Burns, Fichte, Hocking, Laird, Mill, Moore, Royce, Stout and others. The author's own conclusions, which emerge in the final chapter, are that our belief in the existence of other minds rests on the co-opera- tion and opposition which we experience in our contact with others; on their capacity to see our needs and help or hinder us in a manner intelligible to us. The author's own words are available. "The belief in other minds rests on the conviction of the existence of a social order in which one plays one's part with similars. This conviction is not innate but is ac- quired by the individual through experience with what are in fact social situations, though they are not at first known to be such. The conviction grows upon the indi- vidual beginning with a conviction of the existence of a material order merely then passing to a realization of an order responsive to will and finally deepening to a belief in an order responsive in a way that implies a sharing of one's inner, conscious life." This little treatise reveals very convincingly the unsuspected difficulties which beset the attempt to prove the existence of minds other than one's own. It is faintly reminiscent of those "proofs" of God's existence which were once so popular with philosophers. It presents clearly and critically the ideas ad- vanced by previous thinkers who have labored in the same field. And it exhibits throughout a commendable enthusiasm on a subject of considerable interest but of so little "practical" importance.

Price, I5s. net. This is a useful study of the effect of a religious revival upon economic cir- cumstances. It follows the line opened up by Max Weber and R. H. Tawney: and the author has used material from the British Museum. The Wesleyan movement has had a very great influence on politics and business enterprise in England. It combined a liberal view of political activities with the sort of pious practical life which made a "concordat" between God and Mammon. Dr. War- ner has given us a well-balanced and critical review of the contribution made by Wesleyanism to social progress. The humanitarianism, which it promoted, turned easily to reaction when the assumptions of capitalist individualism be- gan to be questioned. This is a more valuable example of ethical principle in operation than is to be found in textbooks of ethics. C. D. B. THAT NEXT WAR? By Major K. A. Bratt; translated by E. Classen. London: Allen &amp; Unwin, I930. Large 8vo. Pp. 280. Price, ios. 6d. net. This is a vigorous study by a Swedish army-officer of the tendency toward a new war. The author deals with actual political and strategic facts and with the growth in armaments: but his argument has great value for a student of moral philosophy, since it is to the change of mind or spirit in men of today that he looks for the abolition of war. But he himself, being a military man, overestimates the place which is likely to be held in a peaceful world by armed forces. He is still at the stage of requiring an international army, navy, and air force. Since, however, it is precisely the "international" aspect of the problem which is obscure, the character of the force which is required is a secondary question. The author wants to fight. Clearly he wants to fight on the side of "internationalism"; but which side, in practice, is that? He has not a clear idea of what he means by the word. C. D. B. DE ELECTIONE GRATIAE AND QUAESTIONES THEOSOPHICAE. By Jacob B6hme; translated from the German by J. R. Earle, with a biographical sketch. London: Constable, I930. Large 8vo. Pp. 326. Price, ios. 6d. net. The life of Jacob Bdhme is admirably rendered in the long Introduction to this book. Dr. Earle is critical but appreciative of this mystic of the Renais- sance, who seems to have been ignorant of all the best intellectual work of his time. The shoemaker who was certain that he was inspired directly by Christ, was opposed by formalists no less certain that their authority was divine. The actual works of Bbhme are Protestant commentaries upon certain Biblical texts: but they are interesting historically for the attempt to rationalize the certainty of the mystic. The book, therefore, is essential for any library of the history of thought. C. D. B.</page><page sequence="13">BOOK REVIEWS I37 THE IDEALISM OF CHRISTIAN ETHICS. By George Walker. Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark, I929. Pp. 254. Price, 7s. net. This quiet, sane book stands out of the present flood of works on Christian Ethics. The treatment is traditional and there are several omissions which will be noticed by those not so fully persuaded of the basic rightness of Christianity as those to whom this Scottish minister appeals: e.g., several metaphysical difficulties are passed over and there is no handling of economic and racial prob- lems as anything other than simple hindrances to Christian determination. But let those looking for a work on Christian Ethics take this and open it where they will, they will find it is Christian Ethics. E. F. METTRICK MAN AND THE IMAGE OF GOD. By Hubert M. Foston. London: Macmillan &amp; Co., I930. Pp. 228. Price, 7S. 6d. net. Feeling, Intellect and Will, the three phases of the human mind, which are distinct yet inseparable-being of one mind, correspond to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, of the Trinity; but instead of this correspondence indicating an anthropomorphic creation of the Triune Deity of Christian Orthodoxy, the truth is that God has made man in his own Image-in the three "phases" of Himself. Perhaps some will find the elaboration of this idea to their liking. E. F. METTRICK NATURE: COSMIC, HUMAN, AND DIVINE. By James Young Simpson. New Haven: Yale University Press, i929. PP. ix+I57+Index. Price, $2.00. Our contemporary age is witnessing the rise of a new line of prophets in mat- ters of cosmic interpretations. We seem to have passed beyond the purely theo- logical stage of the theologians through that of the professionally philosophical of the philosophers, in truly Comtian fashion, to the new era of the scientific- philosophical of the scientists. We are getting our philosophies and theologies from rather unexpected quarters. Professor Simpson belongs to this new class of prophets; his book is typical of this newer leadership. No theology, it is asserted, can gain a respectful hearing in this critical age, without its being grounded in a scientifically defensible cosmology. We must construct our cosmology first and then deduce our theology. After a detailed and most interesting examination of some of the latest findings of the natural sciences, the Terry lecturer rises to give his testimony on matters philosophical and theological. When all is said and done, he says, we find ourselves in a habitat which exhibits, on the whole, Order, Progress, Creative Spontaneity, Intel- ligibility. No better synthesis of these suggestions and trends found in Nature, both cosmic and human, has been offered than that set forth in the Christian theistic outlook. That traditional point of view may be wrong in many of its details but it is not far from right in its general perspective. VERGILIUS FERM</page><page sequence="14">I38 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS THE NATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS. By E. R. Rost. London: Williams &amp; Nor- gate, I930. PP. I58. I2s. 6d. Mr. Rost's thesis is the "absolute agreement" of the new concepts of physics with the principles of ancient Buddhism. The passing of materialism, due to the destruction of the traditional concept of matter, its manifest inability ever again to serve as a metaphysical first principle, is made the background for an impassioned defense and elaborate exposition of Buddhistic psychology and ethics. The explanations and arguments are popular rather than critical, and the scientific analogies are hardly contributions to knowledge; nevertheless the author, who appears to have much first-hand knowledge of contemporary Buddhism in Burma, makes an interesting case for Buddhistic doctrine as an analysis of human nature and a practical philosophy of life. His defense comes from the heart and is eloquent testimony to the possibility of occidental con- version to an Eastern faith. Now that the subtlety of the universe has been re-established against the crudities of nineteenth-century materialism, we may perhaps expect such turnings toward the almost excessively subtle thought of the East to occur with increasing frequency. CHARLES HARTSHORNE WHAT Is LUTHERANISM? Edited by Vergilius Ferm, Ph.D. New York: Mac- millan Co., I930. Price, $2.50. "What is Lutheranism?" The twelve answers contained in Professor Ferm's book will appeal to Lutherans, to leaders of other religious bodies, and to stu- dents of American philosophy. Lutherans will read the book because spokesmen of several synods present their views. These views are interesting to compare now that there is a movement on foot to undo the work of nineteenth-century schisms. Leaders of other religious bodies will read the volume because many sections of the Lutheran church are now co-operating in interdenominational enterprises. Students of American philosophy will read the book in the hope of understanding the mind of America's German and Scandinavian population. Lutheran colonists were attracted in considerable numbers to Pennsylvania early in the eighteenth century, but the great influx took place between i830 and i870, when the Lutheran church increased three times as rapidly as the general popu- lation. The presence of this Teutonic stock had a profound effect upon American customs and opinions. The proper adjective for characterizing Lutheranism as here described is "vigorous." Its intellectual formulations are as sturdy as the bodies of its adher- ents. The frontal attack on problems reveals the reason why this branch of Protestantism has always been favorable to the virtues of industry and honesty. The non-Lutheran reader is impressed by the conviction of all the contribu- tors to the symposium. Lutheranism has a mission. Lutherans are proud to be- long to this movement, which now numbers seventy-five million members. They do not wish to be confused with other religious groups whose tenets they cannot approve, especially Calvinism. Here is a group which is frankly and proudly conservative. They do not call</page><page sequence="15">BOOK REVIEWS I39 themselves fundamentalists, but they hold to a religion of salvation. These men are highly trained in theology. They know what the higher critics did. They are conversant with the teachings of modernism and naturalism. But they point out arguments which in their eyes give conservative Christianity a place in modern society. Justification by faith and a supernatural Christ retain their ancient im- portance in Lutheran doctrine. Several of the authors appear to be in the stage passed by liberal religious thinkers a generation ago: that is, their beliefs are Christocentric. An appreciation of modern conditions is not lacking. But the treatment is theological. The majority of the contributors received part of their education in Europe. Dr. John 0. Evjen, particularly, is ambitious to bring American Luther- anism forward to the "spiritual Lutheranism" of the European church. Anyone, therefore, expecting to find a social or economic interpretation of Lutheranism's relations to American life will be disappointed. The book is chiefly useful to students of American philosophy in disclosing the religious heritage of an influ- ential section of our population. The contributors are Luther A. Weigle, John 0. Evjen, Henry F. Offermann, Abdel Ross Wentz, J. M. Reu, Samuel Gring Hefelbower, Melanchthon G. G. Scherer, John A. W. Haas, William H. T. Dau, C. A. Wendell, J. Magnus Rohne, and Vergilius Ferm. WAYNE LEYS THE MYSTIC WILL. By Howard H. Brinton. New York: Macmillan Co., I930. Pp. xiii+2 5 7. Price, $2.50. Not many persons make the attempt to read the works of Jacob Boehme at first hand. To those who consider him as being of sufficient interest or impor- tance to be known, this volume will perhaps be of value. On the whole, however, the place of Boehme is probably not so great as Mr. Brinton would have us be- lieve. Boehme was a mystic. Like all mystics, his writings are cryptic and enigmati- cal. For that reason they are difficult to read and subject to personal interpreta- tion. It is nearly impossible to know what words used by such men mean. It is even less possible to be sure that any person has found the key to open the seal of symbolism. According to the author of this volume, Boehme's problem was that of all the great mystics: that of bridging the gap between the outer and the inner world. Outwardly he seeks totality; inwardly he struggles for unity. The thesis is that in this cobbler-philosopher the connection is made through an evolutionary process. In this evolutionary mysticism are supposed to be the seeds of the Ger- man Romantic philosophies. The volume opens with an introduction by Rufus M. Jones. This gives it standing in the field of contemporary mysticism. At the close is a bibliography with separate lists of the works of Boehme and those of commentators. MERRITT H. MOORE</page><page sequence="16">I40 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS Russo-AMERICAN RELATIONS i8I5-i867. By Benjamin Platt Thomas. Balti- more: Johns Hopkins Press, I930. Pp. ix+i85. Price, $I.75. It has been said that Russia, with few exceptions, was America's faithful friend from the birth-throes of the nation to i87I. This was a friendship be- tween two nations which "in most other respects were the antithesis of each other, one a liberal democracy, the other a repressive despotism." Professor Thomas traces these relations from i8I5 to i867 in chronological order and indicates that Russia's friendship was due not to her concern regard- ing the democratic development of the United States but rather to Russia's de- sire to safeguard her own interests. She wished to preserve the "universal equi- librium" advocated by Prince Gortchacov. The fact that Russia and the United States were both "animated by a lively fear of Great Britain" accounted for the amiable relations. However, these were often in themselves paradoxical, as in- dicated throughout this work. In i8i6 when Alexander was fostering a "Holy League of Allied Sovereigns" for the peace of the world and desired the support of the United States, he was increasing armaments in order to humble Great Britain on the sea. Later, while corresponding with American peace societies concerning the blessings of peace, he was sending ships and several thousand promoters of peace armed with bayo- nets, to be used against the Spanish-American insurgents. After i823 he thought it best to desert Spain rather than augment friendlier relations between the United States and Great Britain. Negotiations for a commercial treaty failed until Buchanan intimated that the Black Sea regions, where Count Nesselrode owned extensive lands, would be benefited through increased trade. During the Crimean War, Russia attempted to involve the United States against Great Britain. She suggested sending American vessels with Russian goods through the blockade in the hope that England's seizure of free vessels would lead to war. This failing, she urged the outfitting of Russian privateers with American seamen. This also failed. At the close of the war Russia sup- ported the United States against the article in the Peace of Paris concerning pri- vateering, even though Russia had been forced to accept it. All of these acts were directed especially against England. The chapter "The American Civil War" displays Russia's desire to aid the United States not because of her interest in the emancipation of slaves but pri- marily in order to preserve the Union as a means of strength against England. Russia opposed European intervention in America in i862-63. The United States was able to reciprocate by refusing to intervene in Polish affairs in i863. The interesting episode of the Russian fleet, discussed upon the basis of Profes- sor Golder's investigation relating to the same incident, resulted in unintentional aid to the United States. Russia's desire to check Great Britain, together with her inability to exploit the region to her own advantage, was a prime factor in the sale of Alaska. The Perkins claim, "the dirtiest diplomacy on record," together with the question of the appropriation for Alaska conclude the study.</page><page sequence="17">BOOK REVIEWS 14I Professor Thomas has accomplished a very able and scholarly organization of Russo-American problems. The chapters concerned with the period prior to i856 represent practically a new field in Russo-American investigations. Through- out the entire study one is impressed by Russia's self-interest dictating her poli- cies. A complete bibliography makes this work a valuable source for further investigation. ROBERT G.
