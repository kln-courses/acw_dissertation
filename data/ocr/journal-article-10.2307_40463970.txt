<plain_text><page sequence="1">Goldberg, Harvey E. (ed.): Judaism Viewed from Within and from Without. Anthropological Studies. Al- bany: State University of New York Press, 1987. x + 352 pp., tab., fig., illus. Price: $ 44.50 This book consists of three parts. One part is devot- ed to "History and Patterning," another part to "Juda- ism in America," and, almost inevitably, a third part is devoted to "Judaism in Israel." Each section is convinc- ingly introduced by Harvey Goldberg, who in his first in- troduction discusses the place of Jewish studies in an- thropology. He justifiably points out that the anthropol- ogy of Judaism has lagged behind because only few peo- ple have combined the two disciplines (3). Both anthro- pology and Jewish studies can, however, learn from each other (4). The examples from rabbinical literature which he uses to illustrate this (12) are, to my mind, less reveal- ing than they could have been in a study which focuses on symbolic anthropology. In my view, his argument would have been better illustrated by, for example, the connections made by the medieval commentator Rashi between the points of the compass and other spatial di- mensions (cf. Rashi on Numbers 34:15). The first two articles, by Cooper and Zohar, deal with the extremely complicated laws of forbidden mix- tures and the consumption of products from the Sabbati- cal year. These articles, which reveal a vast knowledge of the subject, derive their strength particularly from the way in which they describe hitherto unnoticed symbolic patterns. However, description is one thing, explanation another. Moreover, although it is clear that symbolic meanings can also change in the course of time, the ar- ticles fail to deal explicitly with the question of the conti- nuity of symbolic patterns. When such a change does not occur, this too requires explanation. Cultural continuity does not constitute a lesser problem than cultural change (see, for example, Meijers on the Jewish calender in Anthropos 82. 1987: 609). Furthermore, Zohar offers a critical analysis of Victor Turner's concepts. Goldberg's article on the symbolic meaning of the Torah scroll also describes more than it explains. That the Torah has an anthropomorphic meaning is in itself an interesting dis- covery. The implications, however, remain unclear. Incidentally, this same observation recurs in an ar- ticle by Prell in the second part of the book, which deals with Judaism in America. This part also contains a good introduction by Goldberg, which I recommend to any- one looking for concise information about Judaism in this part of the world. Prell's article on a typical Ameri- can-Jewish atraditional community is one of the better articles in this book. It is not only a good ethnographic study, but it also describes a development which is spe- cific to American Judaism. This immediately brings me to my main point of criticism. Surely a book about Juda- ism in different parts of the world should have included less papers which, regardless of their possible merits as such, deal with issues which are not typical of Judaism in the respective cultural contexts. For example, the contri- bution by Barbara Myerhoff would not have been mis- placed in a study of the anthropology of aged immi- grants. The main, somewhat trivial, conclusion of this article is perhaps that old people reflect upon the experi- ences of their youth, which is something we are all aware of. However, the other contributions are certainly interesting. Shifra Epstein, for example, describes and gives a symbolic analysis of a theatrical performance during the Purim feast among the Bobover Hasidim in Boro Park, New York. She was perhaps unaware that in Europe such performances are still staged, among the Hasidim in Antwerp, for example. However, much more could have been written about American Judaism than is found in this part of the book. It is indeed a pity that one separate volume was not devoted to American Judaism, and one to Judaism in Israel. I can hardly imag- ine that there was a shortage of material for such an un- dertaking. This brings me to the last part of the book. Here, too, we find an excellent introduction by Goldberg. The orthodoxy is surveyed by Menachem Friedman, who de- scribes the process of "orthodoxization." Many people for whom this side of Judaism is a closed book will find Friedman's lucid discussion a great help. One shortcom- ing in his article is that he pays a disproportionate amount of attention to the so-called Lithuanian variant at the expense of the Hasidic movement, which is no less important. Doleve-Gandelman's article on Zionist sym- bolism also offers a good historical meaning of an important part of the Israeli population. In my view, the most interesting article is by Bilu, who deals with the in- creasing hagiolatry among oriental Jews. It is, however, the ethnographic information which makes this article particularly interesting, whereas Bilu draws on the field of psychology rather than on anthropoplogy for the ex- planation of this phenomenon. For example, it is surpris- ing that he failed to notice that dreaming about the Old Testament prophet Ahiyah Hashiloni is a central theme in the Hasidic tradition. According to this tradition, Ah- lyah Hashiloni appeared repeatedly to the Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidism, during a period of ten years. It is therefore not surprising that Bilu's informant Anthropos 84.1989</page><page sequence="2">Rezensionen 597 should in turn dream that the Baal Shem Tov appears to him. There is a striking link between the two dreams which has gone unnoticed. These dreams are less a ques- tion of the "sustaining [of] cultural traditions" (311) of the oriental Jews than an instance of symbolic overpow- ering of European Judaism by oriental Judaism. The subordinate position of oriental Jews in Israel justifies such a conclusion. Finally, Goldberg concludes this last part with an epilogue. In spite of the above points of criticism, and in spite of certain small inconsistencies, such as different spell- ings for one word, sometimes even on the same page (Shabbat, Sabbath, shabbat 168, 187, 282), "Judaism" is an interesting anthropological study with new ideas about largely unexplored subjects. Given that most of the contributors are Israeli scholars, "Judaism" certainly promises well for Israeli anthropology. Daniel Meijers</page></plain_text>
