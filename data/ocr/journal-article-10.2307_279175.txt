Karen Wood Workman, State Archaeologist, reports that the Alaska Division of Parks made surveys in advance of proposed highway construction projects, some in areas that were archaeologically unknown. These included the routes from St. Mary's to Mountain Village, and from Canyon Creek to Shaw Creek on the Alaska Highway, and the area of the Indian River dike project on the Glenn Highway. The surveys produced little archae- ological data, but data on site locations and use was obtained from many informants for the Alaska Heritage Resources Survey. A survey of gravel sources along the Denali, predictably, turned up several lithic sites. The Western Access Road, from Fairbanks to Nome, will traverse more archaeologically unknown territory; some of it will be seen to have significant sites. The Division of Parks made a preliminary aerial reconnaissance of the route in 1974, and will make further surveys as planning progresses. Survey prior to the construction of an airstrip at Nightmute produced no archaeological data. The Division of Parks, with the Youth Conserva- tion Corps and Alaska Methodist University, made test excavations for five days on Chugachik (Indian) Island in Kachemak Bay. This extremely productive site promises to yield much information on the middle Kachemak tradition. Alaska is experiencing more acutely than most states the combined pressures of development and awakening public concern for the scientific and cultural value of the natural landscape. The capa- bilities of Alaskan scientists and scientific institutions have increased dramatically in recent years; but an editor still must hope, rather than predict, that they will be able to do the prehistory we expect of them under these circumstances. ALEUTIANS. Jean Aigner (University of Con- necticut, Storrs) in 1974 directed excavation and ethnographic work by Doug Veltre on Atka Island and the western tip of Amlia. Sites reported by Jochelson and Hrdlicka were revisited, and 17 new sites were identified, one on Amlia, most of the rest in Korovin and Nazan Bay. Future plans are to focus on Korovinski, the locus of significant Russian and Aleut activity. Academician A. P. Okladnikov and W. S. Laughlin, (University of Connecticut), with a team of Soviet and American archaeologists conducted five weeks of excavations in the Anangula unifacial core and blade site and in the nearby Anangula Village site, in the eastern Aleutian Islands as a part of USA-USSR joint archaeological research in the Aleutian Islands. They secured over 10,000 artifacts and specimens for radiocarbon dating, identified seven Asiatic traits in the core and blade culture, and discovered the Transition culture in the Village site, on Anangula Island. They also excavated a stone box in an umqan and made surface collections in a pebble tool site on Umnak Island south of Nikolski Bay. The Soviet party consisted of Academician A. P. Okladnikov (Director of the Institute of History, 213</page><page sequence="2">214 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 41, No. 2, 19761 Philology and Philosophy, Siberian Division of the Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk), A. P. Derevyanko (Deputy Director), V. E. Larichev (Section Chief), R. S. Vasilievsky (Senior Laboratory Researcher), and A. K. Konopatskij (Laboratory Assistant and Inter- preter). The American team consisted of nine persons from the University of Connecticut and three from Nikolski: S. B. Laughlin, B. Frohlich, M. E. McDowell, G. Frechette, D. Rohrbach, L. F. Laughlin, Marcia Dushkin, Clara Dushkin, A. B. Harper, S. I. Wolf, R. F. Laughlin, and 0. Krukoff. A tent camp was established in a cove on the Bering Sea side of the island and the preparatory work was initiated in June by Sara Laughlin, crew chief, and Bruno Frohlich. Two areas in the central portion of the Anangula Blade site were excavated, one 6 x 10 m and the other 3 X 9 m. About 10,000 stone tools were recovered, excluding waste flakes, etc., yielding a density of 115 tools per m2 for the culture horizons, which are approximately 15-30 cm in thickness. Using the figure of 1 15, which is lower than the areas on the Bering Sea side, the 24,800 m2 of the existing Blade site are estimated to contain over 2,967,000 tools. Among the kinds of specimens recovered were: a carved stone dish, grooved abraders, polishing stones with red ochre, one large carved stone-lamp, sinkers, hammerstones, pebble tools, cobble stones, and the core and blade industry. The latter included some four kinds of cores with torzovi frontal or Gobi among them, prismatic blades ranging from 1.5 cm to 20 cm in length, burins, burin spalls, scrapers (obsidian end scrapers and the Siberian scraper), gravers, Mousteroid points, platform flakes, and utilized flakes. (The recognition of Mousteroid points appears to be an interesting result of Russian-American collabora- tion-Ed.) House depressions were easy to see but difficult to define. One house depression had an extensive layer of red ochre and many tools including a 20 cm retouched blade. Tool clusters often appeared distinctive in the frequency of the kinds of products. Thus, one cluster or workshop area might have emphasized the manufac- ture of prismatic blades, or scrapers, and another the production of burins. Okladnikov, Vasilievsky, Konopatskij, and W. S. Laughlin excavated in the nearby Anangula Village site. Okladnikov found the first true prismatic blade and then a long stemmed point made on a blade, like those of the Ushki site in Kamchatka. The site contained a persistence of the unifacial industry of the Blade site and added bifacially flaked pieces. It is a transitional culture between early unifacial and typical Chaluka Aleut. As the radiocarbon dates indicate, the Blade site Aleuts moved uphill when rising sea level forced them off the low Tail of Anangula. Laughlin and his Soviet and American colleagues identify seven Asiatic elements which indicates that the culture was founded on an Asiatic template. SOUTHWESTERN ALASKA. In 1974 a party from the University of Oregon returned for its second consecutive year of research on the Alaska Peninsula in southwestern Alaska. Led by Don E. Dumond, who was assisted by Winfield Henn, the party completed the survey of the lower Naknek drainage system, and Table 1. 1974 USA-USSR Dates for Anangula Blade and Village Sites.

W. S. Laughlin and A. P. Okladnikov. conducted tests at site 49-Nak-6 on the upper Naknek River, which proved to consist largely of semisub- terranean habitations of the Norton cultural period. Altogether, results indicate that the upper portion of the Naknek River proper was heavily occupied by peoples both of Norton and later Thule cultural affiliation. Occupation of the lower portion of the river, on the other hand, appears to have been confined to peoples of the Thule period. In mid-summer, the focus of work was shifted to the upper portion of the Ugashik River and Lake system approximately 80 miles to the south. There, at sites designated 49-Uga-1 through 49-Uga-6, evidence was found of a sequence apparently consisting of at least five distinct prehistoric units. The earliest of these, including microblades, wedge-shaped cores, burins, some ellipsoidal bifaces, and a thick lanceolate projectile point or knife, is believed to be dated about 7675?260 radiocarbon years: 5725 B.C. (SI-1998). Next earliest includes side-notched and stemmed projectile points, crude bifaces, and scrapers. Ap- parently next are some scant but nevertheless fairly convincing remains at one site of occupation of people of the Arctic Small Tool tradition. This is followed by abundant materials of the Norton cultural horizon, and by those of Thule-related culture.</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT RESEARCH 215 Late in the season, acting on information provided by Karen Workman (Alaska State Archaeologist), Dumond succeeded in locating a site reported by fishermen to lie on the coast of the Bering Sea approximately ten miles north of the Naknek River and to have produced a number of side-notched projectile points. Eroding hearths in a blown-out area produced evidence of what are thought to be two assemblages. The later of these, including side-notched projectile points and scrapers, is thought to be dated at about 5015?70 radiocarbon years: 3065 B.C. (SI-1957). The earlier, including blades, microblades, and a single biface fragment of cherty shale, is thought to be dated at about 7895?90 radiocarbon years: 5945 B.C. (SI-1956); typologically, this assemblage appears to differ from the earliest cultural unit in the Ugashik sequence. The Archaeology of Cook Inlet, Alaska, by Frederica de Laguna (1934), will be reprinted with additional plates and a new introduction by the author, in November 1975. Advance orders may be sent to George Hall, Treasurer, Alaska Historical Society, Box 4108, Star Route A, Anchorage, Alaska 99502; the price will be about $12.00. This corner- stone of southwestern Alaskan prehistory has figured prominently in recent syntheses by Clark and Dumond; the Alaska Historical Society is to be congratulated on its very timely reprinting. The Laboratory of Anthropology of Alaska Methodist University was involved in four field projects during the summer of 1975. In May Alan Boraas (Kenai Peninsula Community College) with a crew of 15 excavated a large late prehistoric Tanaina housepit near Soldatna on Alaska's Kenai Peninsula. As has been characteristic of such excavations to date, positive results were slight for ten days invested. A very large barbed slate lance point or knife was the only diagnostic artifact recovered. As anticipated, a central fire hearth area was located. From early June until mid-July the annual AMU field school in archaeology worked at the Cottonwood Creek site in Kachemak Bay, a site first excavated by Frederica de Laguna 44 years ago. This project, which had the support of the Anchorage Community College and the Anchorage Senior College of the University of Alaska as well as AMU, was directed by John Lobdell (ACC) and William Workman (AMU). The artifact yield, modest by North Pacific shell midden standards, confirmed de Laguna's original placement of the main component at the site in the late (final) Kachemak tradition. Appreciable new data on burial practices was gained through recovery of 11 human burials. A number showed the (ritual?) mutilations and dismem- berments noted previously from late Kachemak tradi- tion burials in Kachemak Bay and on closely related Kodiak Island. Status differentiation in late Kachemak tradition society is strongly suggested by a mature female burial accompanied by over 3,000 shell and bone beads and two huge labrets-otherwise grave goods were rare. The physical condition of the remains is excellent permitting hlope for the detailed study of the racial affinity of anl essentially contemporaneous populationl. Anotlher significant result was the isolation of a small upper component clearly separated strati- graphically from the main late Kachemak tradition occupation. Triangular stemless slate end blades and a splitting adze suggest a second millennium A.D. date. Cannibalism is strongly suggested for this occupation. Throughout the summer Gerald Clark directed Laboratory of Anthropology survey and salvage opera- tions along the southern 120 miles of the Trans Alaska Pipeline route. A series of small surface sites, two of which yielded microcores, were found on exposed glacial features in the Little Tonsina and Tiekel River areas, Copper River drainage. Modest though these various inventories are, they represent the first traces of prehistoric remains of, presumably, some antiquity uncovered to date for the entire Copper River drainage. In early September salvage excavations were under- taken by a crew under Clark's direction at a late prehistoric Ahtna housepit village at the confluence of the Gulkana and Copper Rivers. Two rectangular housepits with supplementary rooms and associated features were excavated. Both housepits, while quite small, had tightly laid plank floors. In both cases, the larger and smaller rooms were separated by sterile areas rather than joined. Absence of interior hearths and evidence for outdoor activities adjacent to the larger of the two houses suggest a summer occupation. The larger house had burned, preserving fragments of five spruce bowls, fragments of a birchbark container and woven bark, and a stone maul, in addition to the charred remains of dried fish. A copper awl and several flaked implements and waste flakes were found outside the house area, as were the remains of substantial hearths. A late prehistoric date (A.D. 1400-1700) is suggested for the house pits, which are smaller than those reported ethnographically for the area. Radiocarbon dates will be forthcoming. CENTRAL ALASKA. In 1974 Jim Dixon (Brown University) completed a second field season at Old Fish Camp, an early contact/late precontact Athabascan site located on the Khotol River, a tributary of the middle Yukon River. The study focuses on Eskimo and Athabascan relations in this area of Alaska as well as subsistence patterns and adaptive techniques of the lower Koyukon Athabascans. The research is under the general direc- tion of Douglas D. Anderson (Brown University). NORTHERN ALASKA. During summer 1974 Edwin S. Hall, Jr. (SUNY Brockport), accompanied by Richard 0. Stern (SUNY Binghamton), carried out surveys in four separate areas of Northern Alaska sponsored by the SUNY Research Foundation, the American Philosophical Foundation, Sigma Xi, and the National Park Service through a contract with the Center for Northern Studies of Wolcott, Vermont. Survey along the lower Noatak River located numerous historic sites and one or two late prehistoric sites probably inhabited by the Lower Noatak Eskimos. Two weeks were spent in the upper Kugururok and Nimiuktuk River Valleys, both streams being tributary to the Noatak, in an effort to locate possible early sites and to revisit the Kugururok knolls where a U.S.G.S. party recovered fluted points in the 1950s. Though numerous cllipping stations were dis- covered, few diagnostic artifacts were found; the</page><page sequence="4">216 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 41, No. 2,19761 fluted point site had been well picked over by helicopter-borne souvenir hunters. A reconnaissance of selected portions of the Yukon River Valley between Circle and Eagle and along the lower course of the Charley River proved negative, though several historic cabins were noted. However, the archaeological potential of this area is high and a more exhaustive survey should be undertaken. Finally, an extensive survey was made of the shores of Walker Lake, at the Kobuk River headwaters. Over 30 sites, almost all small chipping stations, were located; the few re- covered artifacts may relate to "notched point cul- tures" known from elsewhere in Northern Alaska. In June 1975 the Northern Yukon Research Programme, based at the University of Toronto and supported by the Canada Council and other institu- tions, began five years of research into the archaeology and ecology of the larger Old Crow region, in easternmost Beringia. Research reported to date shows that Man was present 25,000-30,000 years ago, and probably continuously from 12,000 years ago on- wards. The aims of the Programme are to validate and enlarge upon previous findings, which suggest that Man in Beringia of 25,000-30,000 years ago had a technology that bears some relationship with the Early Paleolithic of the Far East, and to bring specialists in such fields as Botany and Vertebrate Paleontology to work on the ecology of Man from that time until the present. The Programme entails work on nineteenth century ethnQgraphy and intensive study of modern flora, fauna, and subsistence activities. It begins with six principal investigators and eight Ph.D. candidates; it will expand as research and funds direct and permit. Personnel include W. N. Irving, Director; Jacques Cinq-Mars, Associate Director; J. C. Ritchie (Botany); C. S. Churcher (Vertebrate Paleontology); H. G. Savage (Faunal Osteoarchaeology), and John Westgate (Geology). The Programme will share a base camp with the Bering Yukon Refugium Project supported by the Archaeological Survey of Canada and the Geological Survey of Canada. This project is aimed at the environmental history of Beringia throughout the Quaternary, with special attention to evidence for human activity. It is coordinated by R. E. Morlan (Archaeological Survey of Canada) and Owen Hughes (Geological Survey of Canada); other participants include C. R. Harington (National Museum of Natural History), John Mathews (Geological Survey of Canada), Charles Schweger (University of Alberta), and Robson Bonnichsen (University of Maine). Robson Bonnichsen (University of Maine) is con- tinuing his analysis of Pleistocene faunal remains from the Old Crow Flats, Northern Yukon. Over 14,000 mammal remains have been collected from this area to date. More than 30 of the 115 fossil localities have yielded modified bones and artifacts, hundreds of which appear to have been broken by man. Mammoth, bison, horse, and caribou bones have been broken by spiral fractures, and in some instances modified into tools. Perhaps the most significant discovery is that large mammal bones can be flaked like stone. Of over 100 bone implements discovered in the collections, bone cores and flakes are the most common. ALASKA/YUKON BOUNDARY AREA. With a crew of one, Jeff Huntson (University of Calgary) returned to the Dawson City area to conduct excava- tions at LaVk-2 and to extend archaeological survey to the Alaska/Yukon boundary. The fieldwork was sup- ported by a research contract from the Archaeological Survey of Canada, National Museum of Man, Ottawa. Survey work was conducted downstream from Daw- son by boat, and resulted in the location of a small number of Late Prehistoric Athapaskan campsites. Brief testing of the Deadwood Creek site, LaVk-7, originally located by D. Stothers, yielded microblades and a side-notched point. Most of the summer was spent in excavating 38 m2 of the LaVk-2 site, an essentially single component, late Little Arm manifestation at Moosehide, near Dawson. This site was originally discovered in 1957 by MacNeish, and partially excavated by him in 1960. Present excavations encountered four intrusive historic period burials, which contributed some illumination of MacNeish's stratigraphic interpretations, although his conclusions do not suffer. The 1974 artifact collection yielded wedge-shaped microblade cores, microblades, transverse burins, notched and lanceolate points, notched hammerstones, bifaces, end-scrapers, flake tools, and detritus. Analysis of MacNeish's and the 1974 material is underway. Faunal remains are emphatic with regard to Rangifer tarandus sp. and should motivate future testing of Osgood's (1971) interpretation of Han Athapaskan subsistence, utilizing Late Prehistoric data. Radiocarbon samples have been submitted for dating. The presence of a Klo-kut Point in MacNeish's (1957) surface collection from the Moosehide area and the recovery of a diagonally-flaked lanceolate projectile point from an- other area at the village of Moosehide bode well for future research in the area. NORTHERN ONTARIO. K. C. A. Dawson (Lake- head University) carried out a reconnaissance of the north shore of Lake Superior between the Pukaskwa and White Rivers during summer 1974, supported by the National Parks Branch, Department of Indian and Northern Affairs, Canada. The survey found firm evidence for prehistoric populations on this remote and little-known coast; one habitation site and 39 rock formation sites were recorded. Metric and other observations on over 200 rock features suggest classi- fication as invocation structures, dedication cairns, living floors, and hearths. One unique rock feature had a boulder wall some three feet high, and outside dimensions of roughly 50 by 130 feet. Cultural affinity of the sites is assigned provisionally to Laurel and Algonkian Woodland. Your editor feels obliged to mention the recent publication of rock structures in the Ottawa Valley by Alan Tysska. This may suggest a topic for further study- Joyce A. Kleinfelder (Chief Archaeologist, Fort William Archaeological Project, Lakehead University) reports that the Project was officially completed this year, and manuscripts based on the research done between 1971 and 1973 have been turned over to the Ontario Ministry of Cultural Affairs and Recreation for publication. Although research was oriented toward providing information for the provincial government's recon- struction of the North West Company's Fort William</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT RESEARCH 217 depot, the archaeology necessarily involved the sub- sequent Hudson's Bay Company and Canadian Pacific Railway occupations of the site. Consequently, by the end of 1973, the Project had accumulated a mass of data that represented all occupations of the site since 1800 and that had not yet been thoroughly analyzed and digested by the researchers themselves. CENTRAL ARCTIC. Brian Gordon (Archaeolog- ical Survey of Canada) surveyed and tested sites near Baker Lake, N.W.T., in June, 1974. Seven Thule winter houses-the first to be reported inland-were found near the mouth of the Thelon River. They support Elmer Harp's earlier diagnosis of inland Thule, and make wormwood of Irving's skepticism of this possibility. Little bone or antler was found; most of the implements are of quartzite. The Thule settlement appears to be oriented toward wood-gathering and caribou hunting at crossings. In contrast, the historic Caribou Eskimo sites-tent rings, meat caches and hunting blinds-show a sys- tematic plan to intercept caribou of the Kaminuriak herd as they moved south from the calving grounds. These sites are widely distributed, in further contrast with the somewhat limited Thule evidence. During July and August Gordon dug at the Migod site on the Dubawnt River near the Grant Lake site. The site had been tested by J. V. Wright in 1973. The 1974 excavations confirmed that the site contains ten separable levels. The oldest contains Northern Plano (Agate Basin) and is estimated by Bryan to date about 6000 B.C. Above this are three levels of Shield Archaic, a level of Arctic Small tool tradition, and five levels ranging from Earliest Thaltheilei to late Chipewyan. Except for incursions by the Eskimo Arctic Small Tool tradition and the historic Caribou Eskimo, this part of the Barrens appears to have been Indian caribou hunting and fishing territory through- out most of prehistory. Urve Linnamae (University of Saskatchewan) reports that the Rankin Inlet Archaeological Project carried out its second year of excavation at the Meliadine-1 site (Thule: KfJm-3). The scope of activities was curtailed by a shortage of funds. One semisubterranean structure was completely excavated, and the middens of the other four structures were tested intensively. In the excavated structure, the lack of whale bone, roofing flags, and sods in the interior shows that the superstructure probably was a skin tent over a light framework of wood and/or bone, or, possibly, snow blocks. The structure(s) are not Classic Thule winter houses; rather, they indicate a transition- al phase of that culture. This conclusion is bolstered by the artifact sample, which contains several pieces of iron. On this basis and the attributes of harpoon heads, the date of this component is estimated to be between A.D. 1600 and 1700. The site will have an important bearing on the origins of the peoples of western Hudson Bay, and especially the Caribou Eskimo. This research may well be crucial to the solution of the problem of where the Caribou Eskimos came from. Usually reliable sources say that the Canadian Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development will support an extensive survey of Thule Eskimo sites which are being despoiled of whale bone, now negotiable in the art market. Father G. Mary-Rousseliere, O.M.I. reports from Ponds Inlet: Nunguvik, on the west coast of Navy Board Inlet, appears to have been inhabited almost continuously from early Dorset times until late Thule. Since the land uplift has been much slower on the northern coast of Baffin than on the Foxe Basin coast, the same spot has sometimes been occupied again and again, and the culture layer exceeds sometimes 60 cm; stratification is found in several places. The conditions of preservation are generally good, and in one house partly excavated (N73) stone material forms less than 40% of the total, the rest being almost equally divided between bone and wooden artifacts, which shows how much we are probably missing in many other Dorset sites. In another house, also incompletely excavated, (N76), in which two main levels of occupancy have been dated-1310 radiocarbon years: A.D. 640 (S845) and 1525 radiocarbon years: A.D. 425 (S883)-a microblade was found in its composite wooden handle, complete with sinew binding, as well as a burin-like implement with a composite wood and bone handle and sinew lashing. The latter artifact shows how one face of the stone part was polished, probably by use,.after having been placed in its handle. Several pieces of boots and other clothing were also found among an abundance of skins of all kinds, as well as a wooden "horned human head" similar to specimens found previously at Button Point and Saatut. In the same house was found what is almost certainly a kayak rib. It is flat, well smoothed over, and differs from modern kayak ribs in that it is not curved but bent at an angle with the help of a cut on each face of the wood. Tiny holes on the side show how the longitudinal strakes were tied to the rib with sinew. The shape of this rib corresponds with that of some toy kayak ribs previously found at Nunguvik (N71) and Button Point. House N73, the floor of which is less than 1 m above high tide, seems to differ from the usual rectangular model with two side platforms, as illustrated by N71. It has a well-paved entrance passage lined with vertical slabs, and seems to have included some sorts of alcoves. The date 1490 radiocarbon years: A.D. 460 (S-846) given by a plant sample for this house does not seem satisfactory, as typologically it looks younger than N76. At Nunguvik, we have now two dates that seem to close the gap between Dorset and Thule: 855 ?70 radiocarbon years: A.D. 1095 (S-766) for the late Dorset house N71, and 860?90 radiocarbon years: A.D. 1090 (S-477) for the first occupation of an early Thule house. Both dates come from platform cover samples of Cassiope tetragona, yet the tool assemblage of N71 does not show any sign of Thule contact. A short time was also spent last summer at the small nearby site of Arnakadlak, which apparently dates from the transitional period (a date on a sample of seal bones gives 2725?140 radiocarbon years: 775 B.C. (S-591). Burins and burin spalls constitute a high proportion of the stone artifacts (47%). Unfortunate- ly, only much-damaged and puzzling fragments of two harpoon heads have been found. At the rapidly eroding site of Saatut (average 45 cm per year), about 25 miles to the south, more</page><page sequence="6">218 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 41, No. 2, 19761 artifacts have been recovered, as well as a lock of human hair. Although typologically the specimens seem to belong to the same period of middle Dorset, the six dates we have from this site vary wildly, ranging from 2405 radiocarbon years: 455 B.C. (S-67 1, on seal bones) to 1180 radiocarbon years: A.D. 770 (S-850, on caribou bones). At this site, the most important and characteristic artifact is the tool made from caribou leg bone, which may have a blunt, rounded, or pointed end. These tools are also abundant at Nunguvik, as well as the bones from which they have been manufactured. It makes me wonder if the so-called "double-handed scrapers" found in other Dorset sites are not just "negatives" of such implements; the many that we have found do not show any sign of wear. While the Nunguvik people hunted mostly caribou, the inhabitants of Saatut lived mostly on seal and fish. Before closing, I would like to report on the discovery at Hall Beach of a very interesting and puzzling piece. It is the curved side of a composite box. On the convex face, there is a line engraving representing a caribou behind which is a pointed, cross-hatched object. On the concave face, what seems to be the same object is engraved, without the cross-hatching, but more carefully and on a bigger scale. It looks much like a missile or a supersonic jet not unlike the "Concord"! Graham Rowley has suggested a Lapp-type sledge, but I am still waiting for a more satisfactory explanation. The piece comes from a late Dorset site which was much disturbed by bulldozers during the construction of the strip. It was sent to me by Fr. Van de Velde: he had received it from the little girl who found it, and it does not look like a hoax. Robert McGhee (Memorial University of New- foundland) and Peter Schledermann (University of Calgary) did a four-week survey of selected areas on northern Devon and southern Ellesmere Islands, N.W.T. Small sites relating to the Independence I, Independence II, and Thule cultures were located at Cardigan Strait, northern Devon island. At Cape Storm, on the south coast of Ellesmere island, a series of raised beaclhes produced 11 Independence I struc- tures, as well as 21 structures relating to a later ASTt variant. Two Independence II sites, three Dorset winter house sites, and three Thule villages were found along the neighboring coast. One of the Thule sites was marked by approximately 50 fox traps, and two bear traps were associated with the Thule villages. On Porden Point, on the south coast of Grinnell Peninsula, small Independence I and II sites were found, as well as a Dorset village and a large village of 13 Thule winter houses. The work tends to confirm the sequence of period, i.e., occupations of this part of the High Arctic which was earlier traced at Port Refuge on Grinnell Peninsula. M. Patrick Plumet (Universite de Quebec a Montr6al) reports: In summer 1974, the field crew from the Laboratoire d'Archeologic de l'Universit6 de Quebec i Montr6al pursued research in the Ungava. The mission, supported by the Programme of Urgent Archaeology of the Archaeological Commission of Canada, carried out a survey of the island of Akpatok. Many Paleoeskimo summer camps (Dorset) were located at the west and northeast of the island, as well as a group of semisubterranean habitations of the Thule type at the extreme south. At the end of July and August, structure A was excavated at site DIA.4 (JfEl-4). The excavation determined the precise loca- tion of the southeast wall and of the storage area and the arrangement of a system of caches. The radio- carbon dates suggest that the site had been occupied from 2180 radiocarbon years: 230 B.C. to 470 radiocarbon years: A.D. 1480. The last date is from Habitation A which is contemporary with the Thule occupation of the region. Habitation A has a mixed character: Thule in its semisubterranean passage and the southern portion comprising a kitchen; Dorset in the axial structure with lamp support. The chipped stone is entirely Dorset. EASTERN ARCTIC. Gilles Samson (University of Toronto) reports that during 1973 and 1974 surveys were carried out at Indian House Lake (54 miles long by 3 miles wide), Nouveau Quebec, about 155 miles northeast of Schefferville (55 55' N-64 45'W). Follow- ing up research by Geoffrey Conrad and William Fitzhugh in 1969, the surveys yielded 73 sites. Forty-five of the sites at elevations varying between 3 and 12 m above lake level revealed camping remains of historic Algonkian Indians and more precisely those of the Barren Ground Band (Naskapi) known to have occupied the area from the 1850s to about A.D. 1916. Remains consist of numerous earthrings of two pre- dominant shapes, circular-truncated and rectangular with rounded ends. All have at least one interior central lhearth. The rim, the central hearth, and, in some cases, the ramp at the entrance are elevated above the floor level. A total of 655 habitation infra-structures are present at these sites. They are similar in many respects to the Naskapi earthrings identified at Fort Chimo by Thomas E. Lee. So far, most of the European trade material found associated with the earthrings dates to the late nineteenth century. One site, called Tshinutivish, is dated A.D. 1910 on the basis of historic accounts and photo- graphs produced by William B. Cabot, an early explorer of interior Labrador. It is also expected that some of these sites may date to earlier contact times. The 28 sites containing lithic material average between 10 and 14 m above lake level. Fifty-one lithic concentrations were identified and yielded about 118 artifacts and 3,126 flakes. Associated with chipping concentrations were hearths characterized by fire- cracked rocks and calcined bone. The lithic material is composed of a variety of stemmed points, side- notched points, and square based bifaces; ground stone is found at many of the sites. A few sites were culturally affiliated with the Maritime Archaic tradi- tion, while others are more related to Archaic atnd Woodland periods. No Eskimo remains have yet been found in the area surveyed. Further surveyiing will be carried out along the higher pro-glacial terraces of the lake (700-800 feet above lake level). It is hoped that the terraces may yield cultural remains comnparable in age (7,000 years ago) with those found on the coast of Labrador by James A. Tuck and William Fitzhugh. Indian House Lake is only about 100-120 miles from the coast. Environmental research also began in 1974 with</page><page sequence="7">CURRENT RESEARCH 219 the collection of surface pollen samples and dendro- chronological samples now being processed by Jaan Terasmae (Brock University). In 1975, collection of pollen cores in bogs and lakes will be undertaken, together with detailed geomorphological studies of the lower terraces and deposits along the shores of the Mushuau Nipi (Indian House Lake).

The University of Utah field school, under the direction of Jesse D. Jennings, excavated Cowboy Cave during June and July 1975. Three major com- ponents were noted, Archaic, pre-Basketmaker, and B asketmaker. The pre-Basketmaker component produced split twig figurines and a cache of corn. Patrick Hogan (University of Utah) and Richard Holmer (University of Utah) concluded a contract survey of the Central Utah Project for the Bureau of Reclamation. The major portion of the survey area was located in the Uinta and Wasatch mountain ranges; 23 sites were noted. A survey of the Maze District of Canyonlands National Park was completed during the 1975 field season by crews led by Patrick Hogan (University of Utah) and Leonard Losee (University of Utah) under contract with the National Park Service. A total of 248 sites were recorded, yielding evidence of Archaic, Anasazi, and Fremont occupation. The data obtained indicate heavy Archaic use of the upland areas of the district followed by Anasazi farming on the Green and Colorado River bottoms and light Fremont use of upland and canyon area. Survey was carried out in the San Rafael Desert area northeast of Hanksville and in the upland area west and northwest of Moab by William D. Lipe and Don Keller (Museum of Northern Arizona) in connec- tion with Tennessee Valley Authority uranium ex- ploration. Fremont and Archaic materials were found west of the Green River, while sites of undetermined age and culture, and a very small amount of Proto- Hopi material, have been found on the east side. William Lipe collected additional tree-ring speci- mens from Pueblo cliff ruins in the Cedar Mesa Project. Charlotte Benson (University of Washington) surveyed all Pueblo sites in a nine km2 portion of Cedar Mesa, in order to refine the Pueblo chronologic sequence, to define community patterns, and to investigate change and continuity in these patterns. COLORADO. Directed by David A. Breternitz, the University of Colorado Mesa Verde Research Center conducted a number of archaeological projects during the past year. Salvage excavationis for the BIA along the Mancos Canyon Road, Ute Mountain Reservation, were continued, and Pueblo I through Early Pueblo III sites were excavated. Important information concern- ing the Pueblo I-Pueblo II transition was collected. The most significant architectural feature was an early Pueblo II Great Kiva dating to the early 900s that exhibited features of both Pueblo I and Pueblo II. Excavation and ruin stabilization were done for the BLM at the Escalante Ruin west of Dolores. The site may have been described in Escalante's 1776 journal. It is not a Mesa Verde pueblo but rather is built in Chacoan layout and masonry and may relate to sites such as Chimney Rock Pueblo and the Houck Ruin. The BLM sponsored a series of stabilization pro- jects providing training for students. These projects included work at the Lowry Ruin, where a unique painted kiva was stabilized and roofed, and at a cliff dwelling in East Rock Canyon west of Cortez, where a two-story painted wall and associated roomblock were stabilized. An inventory of the lower 167 miles of the Dolores River was made for the Montrose District of the BLM, and 138 sites were recorded. Inventory of the San Miguel River also has been completed and 304 sites are now known to exist on public and private lands below the Norwood Bridge. In addition, evaluation of 41 cliff dwellings in Sand Canyon west of Cortez was made to determine their significance and needs for future protection and stabilization. Work for the Bureau of Reclamation included field checking all construction-related activity areas on the Dolores River Project. The 564 sites recorded represent cultural remains from at least Basketmaker II through historic Ute. Currently planned construc- tion areas within the BOR's Animas-La Plata Project were field inventoried, and 115 sites were recorded. Occupations representing Basketmaker III and, in the Colorado-New Mexico border area, a series of Pueblo Refugee and Navajo/Ute sites were found. An additional 229 sites were recorded in the continuing inventory of resources within Mesa Verde National Park. Moccasin Mesa was inventoried and large concentrations of Pueblo II sites were located. A survey of the mesa top above and between Mancos and Johnson Canyons on the Ute Mountain Reservation was carried out to sample surface ruins in order to relate them to cliff dwellings excavated in 1974. In one cliff dwelling a broken shovel that had belonged to Clayton Wetherill was found in a partially ex- cavated kiva. It had been left on January 10, 1890. Jonathan E. Reyman (Illinois State University) spent the second year of an NSF-sponsored project investigating interrelationships between adaptation, architecture, and astronomy at Mesa Verde National Park. The results indicate a lesser degree of socio- ceremonial and architectural integration at Mesa Verde than at sites in the Chaco Canyon area. Major results include confirmation of a solstitial alignment at Balcony House and refutation of Fewkes's argument for a solstitial alignment of the front wall of Sun Temple. NEW MEXICO. Under the general field supervision of Jim Judge, the Chaco Center (National Park Service) continued research in Chaco Canyon from May to September 1975. Research orientation con- tinued to focus on establishing a solid chronological framework in Chaco, as well as attempting to under- stand the social dimensions of Chacoan prehistory in order to provide both a theoretical and metliodolog-</page><page sequence="8">220 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 41, No. 2, 1976] ical basis for research during the forthcoming excava- tion of Pueblo Alto. The inventory survey of Chaco Canyon National Monument and its immediate surroundings, begun in 1972 by the Chaco Center, is now complete. Under the field direction of Peter McKenna, the survey crew completed work north of the Monument in mid-July. To date, a total of 2,372 sites have been recorded, yielding a density of about 49 per square mile (18.8/km2). The survey report is now in press. Excavation was carried out at five different sites during 1975. Under the direction of Marcia Truell, fieldwork at Site 29SJ627 was completed, after two seasons' work. This site consisted of 24 rooms, three pithouses, two proto-kivas, and three kivas, inter- meshed in an extremely complex stratigraphic sequence. It was occupied from BM III to P III times with little temporal discontinuity. Tom Windes initiated excavation of Site 29SJ629, adjacent to Site 627. This site, consisting of 12 rooms and a kiva, contains two distinct occupationis, late P I and early P II, and work will continue here next field season. Since this site and 29SJ627 are both located in the same rincon, it is hoped that their analysis, when compared with the results of excavations elsewhere in the canyon, will yield information on the character of prehistoric Chacoan social units. Elsewhere in Cliaco Canyon, excavation was carried out at Site 29SJ 1010, directed by Tom Lyons. This site, located about 4 km ENE of Pueblo Alto, consists of a series of overlapping masonry circles, one of whiclh was excavated. A large fire pit in the center suggests a signaling station. It is located along one of the Chacoan roads wliclih runs northeast from Clhetro Ketl. Dave Brugge excavated a complex of late eighteenth century Navajo lhogans at Site 29SJ1613, located on the mesa across from Wijiji. Evidently occupied in port-Refugee times, the site has a definite defensive character. Though most of the eight hogans excavated were habitational, at least one was primarily defensive in function. The excavated hogans have been stabilized for Park Service interpretation purposes. Under the direction of Tom Matlhews, excavation was carried out at 29SJ 1156 for two weeks in August. This site is a late Archaic-early BM II rockshelter located across the canyon from Pefiasco Blanco. Due to excellent preservation, a great deal of perishable material was recovered, including atl atl fragments, other wooden weapons, and large quantities of floral and faunal remains. Further work is planned for the 1976 season. The Museum of New Mexico conducted clearance surveys for 43 projects during 1974-75 and recorded 402 prehistoric and historic sites. An additional 531 sites recorded by other institutions or individuals have been listed in the State Inventory. David H. Snow (Museum of New Mexico) super- vised excavations at eight prehistoric sites along a transmission line between Farmington and Chili. These sites included four lithic sites representing seasonal food-gathering and preparation camps, a chert quarry and workshop, and a temporary hunting basecamp with multiple components. Cultural affiliations range from San Jose to proto-historic Pueblo and, possibly, early Navajo. Three Gallina phase sites and an early Rio Grande Classic period unit consisting of ten contiguous rooms and extensive terracing, channeling, and waffle-gardens, were also excavated. Snow also supervised excavation of a small temporary camp-site containing lithic debris and Rio Grande Classic period Pueblo sherds in the lower Chama River Valley for the Highway Department. Salvage excavation of a small Gallup Black-on-white sherd area and a recent Navajo ramada structure northeast of Gallup was completed by the Museum of New Mexico. Under the direction of C. R. Morrison (Museum of New Mexico), three sites on a proposed realignment of US 666 north of Gallup were excavated. Two con- temporary Pueblo II field houses occupied different biotic communities suggesting crop specialization. Water control devices were associated with one field house in a dune area, but a similar structure in a level drainage basin lacked water control systems. A Navajo rockshelter was also excavated. C. R. Morrison (MNM) supervised archaeological work for the Highway Department on three projects in Tijeras Canyon east of Albuquerque. The first project involved excavation and ethnohistoric and eth- nographic researclh at San Antonio Pueblo and com- munity (LA 24). Evidence for an occupational sequence spanning late Rio Grande Coalescent (A.D. 1250-1300) through 1973 was collected, and an ethnohistory of Spanish occupation of the area was made. Application of remote sensing analysis, made available by Thomas R. Lyons (NPS-Chaco Center), and mapping of prehistoric and Spanish water systems in the San Antonio area by David W. Kayser have added considerable data to the interpretation of the community development. The second project involved excavation of two sites of indeterminate function. These sites contained Lino-like ceramics, but no evidence for permanent habitation was found. The third project was carried out at Carnue and involved excavation in a Late Coalesceiit Period pueblo with definite Western Pueblo affiliation, and partial testing of an eighteenth century Spanish Colonial village near the site of San Miguel de Laredo de Carnue. The latter site is a strong contender for the location of the original site of Carnue occupied from 1763 to 1769. Eastern New Mexico University's twelfth season at Blackwater Draw under the direction of Scott Price was relatively unproductive. Although work was con- centrated in an area that had produced Firstview material, it proved unfruitful this season leading to speculation that Firstview occupation at the site was limited. Frank C. Hibben (University of New Mexico) continued work at the Commanche Springs site south of Albuquerque. Two of the three fortified Spanish haciendas at the site were excavated. Majolica, frag- ments of Spanish armor, arquebus parts, chain mail, a cannon ball, and other evidence suggested a date for the Spanish occupation at about A.D. 1600. Slag with a high percentage of silver indicated mining and smelting in the area at a very early date. Hibben also supervised salvage opera4ions at the pueblo site of Pottery Mound south of Albuquerque. Pothunters had revealed another painted kiva, and Hibben recovered 14 additional paintings.</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT RESEARCH 221 Sponsored by Ghost Ranch in the Chama Valley, Florence H. Ellis (emeritus, University of New Mexico) directed a field school concerned with Gallina village life patterns, intra-village communication, and relationships between the home village and seasonally occupied mountain sites. The latter are found from 8,300 to over 10,000 feet in altitude, but garden plots at lower levels indicate use throughout the growing season. It has been proposed that the relatively small capacities of Gallina Black-on-white ware and gray cooking pots and water jars indicate that limited groups rather than entire families were supplementing a flagging economy with hunting and gathering. Increasing evidence for the descent of Jemez Pueblo from a Gallina background permits good use of ethnographic analogy. A survey directed by Frank J. Broilo and Charles A. Reher (Office of Contract Archeology, University of New Mexico) has been completed for the Coal Gasification Project in northwestern New Mexico. Survey research design was structured to test relation- ships between Archaic site placement and vegetational diversity, Anasazi agricultural strategies and hydrolog- ical variables, and Navajo pastoralism and grazing productivity. The survey covered 68 square miles and recorded 412 Navajo, 190 Pueblo, 5 Basketmaker, 93 Archaic, 3 Paleoindian, and 5 unidentifiable com- ponents. Further work in the Corps of Engineers Cochiti Reservoir Project on the middle Rio Grande was initiated in the winter of 1974 by Frank Broilo, Jan V. Biella, and Richard C. Chapman (OC.A., U.N.M.) in cooperation with the National Park Service and Stanley D. Bussey (New Mexico State University). An inventory survey recorded a total of 319 Archaic to Historic sites. The mitigation program for the permanent flood pool involved excavation or testing of 35 sites. David E. Stuart and Frank Broilo (O.C.A., U.N.M.) have also implemented a Small Projects Program in the O.C.A. In the past year 23 projects have been undertaken, primarily in the San Juan Basin. A major focus has been to develop a regional ecological research strategy so that each project may contribute maximally to the general research interests of O.C.A. One study examines the ecological parameters of distinct wet and dry season adaptations. The final phase of fieldwork supported by the Bureau of Reclamation on the Nambe Falls Project was completed in August 1975, by the Archaeology Research Program (Southern Methodist University), resulting in the excavation of 13 sites. A Preceramic occupation was dated at 1340, 2510, and 1550 (TX 1992-1994) radiocarbon years, but four pithouse sites with "Kwahe'e" ceramics were inadequately dated. A series of 14 tree ring dates (A.D. 1228 to 1269) were obtained from three "Santa Fe" component adobe- walled pueblos. In addition, five "fieldhouses" have been excavated but are only dateable by association with Biscuitware sherds. A second season at the Brantley Reservoir on the Pecos River between Artesia and Carlsbad was directed by Joseph Gallagher (A.R.P., S.M.U.) and sponsored by the BOR. Survey collection and testing of selected sites was completed. Excavations were carried out at a burnt rock-midden, a ring midden, several lithic scatters and two historic houses. The presence of buried Archaic horizons was revealed at several sites. Intensive historic research was carried out to provide background on the abandoned (approximately 1890) town of Seven Rivers. Analysis is underway to test and refine a settlement model proposed for this portion of the Middle Pecos River. Frances Levine and Charles Mobley (A.R.P., S.M.U.) completed a survey for the Corps of Engineers' Los Esteros Reservoir Project on the Pecos River near Santa Rosa. A total of 246 sites was inventoried, including sites from Archaic, Pueblo, Plains-Indian, and Historic horizons. Three rockshelters, one camp- site, two tipi ring sites, and two historic sites have been excavated. Analysis is focusing on evaluation of techno-economic shifts through time, as well as investigation of problems concerning eastern peripheral Pueblo population dynamics and Plains- Pueblo relationships. The Mimbres Archeological Center directed by Steven A. LeBlanc (Institute of Archeology, UCLA) completed its second season of survey and excavation in the Mimbres area. Excavations continued on the Mattocks (LA 676) and Janss (LA 12077) sites. First season tree-ring dates from LA 676 show major building activity in the late 1000's to A.D. 1107. Excavations were initiated on a classic Mimbres pueblo (ASM: N.M. Z:1:30), a late pithouse village (ASM: N.M. Z:1:27), and the Stailey site, a "Salado" village (ASM: N.M. Z:1:78). During 1975 Frank Findlow and Suzanne De Atley (U.C.L.A.) initiated a series of investigations in the Animas and San Luis Valleys of Hidalgo County. While a number of discrete projects are involved, research is focused primarily on obtaining a greater understanding of twelfth to fifteenth century settle- ment spacing priorities and related changes in raw materials procurement systems. A 1.5% stratified random sample of the area was surveyed, and 55 sites were recorded and systematical- ly collected. In 1976 the project will be expanded to include an additional .5% survey sample and a series of limited excavations designed to gather ecofactual data to supplement survey collections. ARIZONA. Survey has been done on Hopi, Kaibab Paiute, and White Mountain Apache tribal lands by Don Keller (Museum of Northern Arizona) in connec- tion with the proposed installation of water and sanitation facilities by the U.S. Indian Health Service. Considerable prehistoric material was found in each area. A proposal has been made to excavate for pollen samples in an early twentieth century check dam system on Second Mesa on the Hopi Reservation. Material from the surface collection of a Tolchaco lithic/gravels site in the Little Colorado River valley near Leupp has been analyzed and reported by Don Keller and Susanne Wilson (M.N.A.). The results show the site was a locus of lithic material procurement and was probably used over a long period of time by various groups. The findings support the hypothesis that Tolchaco delineates a site type rather than a specific cultural complex or focus. Paul Fish and Don Keller (M.N.A.) and Peter Piles (U.S. Forest Service, Coconino National Forest) are</page><page sequence="10">222 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 41, No. 2, 1976] investigating a cluster of sites, which include extensive Tolchaco lithics/gravels and numerous petroglyph oc- currences, in the Little Colorado River valley just east of Joseph City. The investigations are sponsored by the Arizona Public Service Company in connection with expansion of the Cholla generating station at Joseph City. James Trott (M.N.A.) supervised the salvage ex- cavation of eight sites within the proposed right-of- way of Navajo Route 15 between Leupp and Dilkon on the Navajo Reservation. Sites range from Basket- maker II to Pueblo III. The research thrust of the project includes investigation of cultural continuity and change as reflected in material remains, settlement variation and its relation to environmental variables, and social correlates of ceramic variation between Pueblo III villages represented in the sample. The Coconino National Forest employed Peter J. Pilles, Jr. as Forest Archaeologist in May, 1975, to comply with current legislation and to provide cultural resource management direction. Some Sinagua pat- terns are emerging as a result of clearance investiga- tions by Pilles. Masonry field houses associated with check dams occupied during the Rio de Flag phase (A.D. 900 to 1 100), are contemporary with pit house sites near large alluvial parks that were probably intensively farmed. Established Sinagua concepts have not recognized field houses or masonry architecture prior to the eruption of Sunset Crater in A.D. 1066. Post-eruptive field houses in the cinder fall area seem associated with alluvial pockets and are rapidly followed by residential expansion into the cinder fall area. Surveys along the Mogollon Rim have identified another small house pattern which seems more related to exploitation of wild plant food resources. The Black Mesa Archaeological Project, sponsored by Peabody Coal Company and directed by Stephen Plog (Southern Illinois University at Carbondale), continued its research in 1975. Three sites excavated during the summer included two of Dinnebito phase (A.D. 875 to 975) and one of Wepo phase (A.D. 975 to 1050). During the fall an intensive survey of a 130 km2 area between Moenkopi and Dinnebito Washes was completed. With the appointment of Robert C. Euler as Research Anthropologist at Grand Canyon National Park, two survey projects were carried out. One involved a study of A.D. 1100 Cohonina adaptation to the arid environment of mid-Havasu Canyon con- ducted in collaboration with Dee F. Green (Regional Archaeologist, U.S. Forest Service). The second survey was done in environmentally diverse areas of the Grand Canyon North Rim. While Kayenta Anasazi architectural components seem to be confined to a ponderosa pine zone, numerous hunting camps of these people were recorded at higher elevations on the fringes of fir-spruce forests. Survey of Canyon del Muerto under the general supervision of Don P. Morris (Western Archeological Center, National Park Service) recorded 300+ sites ranging in age from Basketmaker II to modern Navajo. Data recorded emphasized rock art, and architectural and environmental information in an attempt to delineate major social units within the canyon system and changing settlement systems during the occupa- tion span. Extensive prehistoric use of the canyon rim and plateau area was observed. William J. Beeson and Howard P. Goldfried (Cali- fornia State University, Sacramento) directed a second season of excavations at NA 10937 (Kahorsho Site) east of Flagstaff. The site is a post-eruptive Sinagua village with three occupation phases. Nine structures including masonry rooms, stone-lined rectangular pit houses, and a large clay plastered pit house were completely excavated together with adjacent activity areas. A supposed checkdam was trenched but proved to be the result of natural deposition. Both extended burials and cremations were found. Lyle M. Stone and Dan J. Opfenring (Archaeolog- ical Research Services, Tempe, Arizona) recently completed a survey near Snowflake for the Soil Conservation Service. The intent was to locate and inventory archaeological sites within a 2,000 acre area to be affected by a S.C.S. watershed project on Cottonwood Wash, and to provide recommendations for the mitigation of project impact upon these sites. Of the 50 sites located, 35 will be directly affected by project activities; 24 by inundation and 11 by dam construction and associated borrow excavations. Re- commended mitigation activities include additional archaeological research (29 sites) and avoidance or management (six sites). This survey has defined a major prehistoric occupation within this portion of the Cottonwood Wash Drainage. It is suggested that this occupation existed from approximately A.D. 200-1250, and that it was basically Mogollon in character, with an evident increase in Anasazi in- fluence through time. Archaeological personnel of the U.S. Forest Service carried out several projects during the year. Results of these projects appear in a new U.S.F.S. Southwest Region publication series. Landon D. Smith conducted excavations near Superior at a small early twelfth century settlement of five houses with a well developed water control system. A major goal of the research was to delineate the particular man-land relationships at the community. Pollen sampling and analyses focusing on site use will aid in interpretation of the environmental exploitative strategies used. Donald G. Wood conducted excavations along the Blue River, Apache National Forest, on small Mogollon sites threatened by road constuction. The third field season of the Central Arizona Ecotone Project (CAEP), sponsored jointly by the NSF, NASA, and Southern Illinois University, was completed in the New River-Black Canyon City area north of Phoenix under the direction of John Hanson. Fieldwork included some site survey on the terraces of the Lower Agua Fria south of Black Canyon City to Calderwood Butte and test excavations at a number of sites in the Lower Sonoran life zone, including one large pithouse village near New River. Research was oriented toward a better delineation of the temporal sequence in the area and a better understanding of the nature of prehistoric land utilization and water management. Albert C. Goodyear (Arizona State University) finished three consecutive seasons of mitigation phase research on the Hecla Mine property located in the Slate Mountains of the Santa Rosa Valley. A series of</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT RESEARCH 223 models relating to prehistoric subsistence systems in the paloverde-saguaro community were tested. These models were constructed from information drawn from desert plant ecology and ethnohistory. Intensive and probability-based sampling methods were used to collect artifacts and scatters in behaviorally significant terms. A quantitative approach was used to collect floral data including plant counts and biomass estimates using transects and randomized point quadrats. Correlations were found between specified floral biomass and predicted lithic-ceramic tool kits. Evidence of Hohokam-related groups, especially Sells phase, was found to dominate processing camps. A possible protohistoric phase may be recognized, while post-I 860 Papago sites were common. James B. Rodgers (Office of Cultural Resource Management, Arizona State University) surveyed the Buckeye Hills East area in the Bureau of Land Management Greenbelt Planning Unit to provide long- range cultural resource management recommendations and fulfill the requirements of Executive Order 11593. The survey recorded 21 sites including hunting and gathering camps, temporary domestic structures, canals, petroglyphs, storage structures, and lithic workshops. In addition, 192 cultural loci, which included sherd and lithic scatters and isolated artifacts, were recorded. Cultural affiliation appears to be primarily Hohokam but strong Lower Colorado influences occurred in the late prehistoric period. Early historic Papago materials were also noted. B ernhart Johnson and Bettina Rosenberg (O.C.R.M., A.S.U.) directed an intensive survey of the southern Sierra Estrella on the Gila River Indian Reservation due to be impacted by the Montezuma Hydroelectric Pumped-Storage Project. The survey recorded several relatively large villages high on the mountain and numerous gathering camps at the base. Preliminary evaluation indicates both prehistoric Hohokam remains and early historic materials as- sociated with Papago-Pima and/or Maricopa occupa- tions. Mitigation excavations should shed light on the Hohokam-Pima continuum problem. Continuing work at the Hecla Mine on the Papago Indian Reservation resulted in several clearance survey projects directed by J. Simon Bruder (O.C.R.M., A.S.U.). Bettina Rosenberg and Patricia Brown (O.C.R.M., A.S.U.) conducted 11 clearance surveys through Arizona and southern California as part of the cultural resource management program. David E. Doyel (Arizona State Museum) conducted excavations for the Continental Oil Company in the Gila River Basin near Florence. One Sacaton phase pithouse, three Soho phase compounds, and a large Civano phase compound-platform mound site were excavated. The Soho phase sites are significant as little is known about this time period; while the Civano phase site will help reconstruct this final phase of the Classic period development. For purposes of highway realignment, David E. Doyel (A.S.M.) conducted excavations for the Arizona Department of Transportation in the Globe-Miami area. Eight small sites located above a floodplain were excavated. Most are dual component with indications of early Hohokam and later Salado occupations. Hohokam components usually consist of a single pithouse structure; while the later Salado components consist of one or two room cobble masonry structures. A new phase, the Miami phase, was established at a single site and represents a transitional period between the latest Hohokam and the earliest Puebloan occupation of the area. The Cultural Resource Management Section of the Arizona State Museum recently completed two archae- ological surveys for the Bureau of Reclamation Central Arizona Project. The proposed Buttes Reservoir is located along the Gila River approximately 13 miles east of Florence and is expected to affect about 21,500 acres. Phase I of the archaeological evaluation was undertaken in summer 1973 along the south side of the Gila River, and Phase II, survey of the north side, was implemented in spring 1975. A total of 278 sites (Cochise, Hohokam, Salado, historic Apache, and historic Anglo) were located. Surveys were also made by C.R.M.S. at Roosevelt Lake and Horseshoe Dam Reservoir, east and north of Phoenix respectively. Modification of these areas is a possible alternative to construction of the proposed Orme Reservoir. The study involved 20% of the reservoir area; 1801 acres at Roosevelt Lake and 1108 acres at Horseshoe Dam were surveyed, resulting in the location of 93 sites. Cultural affiliation included Sinagua and Hohokam in the Horseshoe Reservoir and Hohokam and Salado in the Roosevelt Lake area. Following completion of intensive survey, Con- tinental Oil Company (CONOCO) contracted with C.R.M.S. to do work necessary for archaeological clearance of an area near Florence. This involved mapping and collecting of seven sites and intensive sampling of nine percent of the total area (7,387 acres). The intensive sampling strategy, which involved collection of archaeological and environmental data, was developed to allow adequate recording of non-site cultural and environmental relationships. Excavations at Tubac Presidio State Historical Park were undertaken by C.R.M.S. during fall and winter 1974-75. Work concentrated in the western half of the Presidio structure which was in use during Spanish, Piman, Mexican, and historic Anglo occupations of the site. Under contract with the National Park Service, C.R.M.S. conducted excavations at the Great House in Compound A at Casa Grande National Monument and at Fort Bowie National Monument. Both projects are associated with pre-stabilization studies. C.R.M.S. fieldwork in progress during fall 1975 includes a survey of the Arizona Public Service Cholla to Saguaro 500 KV Transmission Line, a 200 mile transect through major cultural and environmental zones in Arizona. In addition, a partial survey of a 24 square mile area within the Coronado National Forest in the Santa Rita Mountains is part of a multi- disciplinary approach by University of Arizona specialists to examine environmental and social rela- tionships occurring in the area. At the ANPP plant site in Wintersburg, Pat Stein (M.N.A.) has studied material from 12 sites east of the Palo Verde Hills. One hunting/cactus-processing camp may prove significant in clarifying the nature of the relationship of Desert to Riverine Hohokam and the role of wild resource exploitation in the support of</page><page sequence="12">224 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 41, No. 2, 1976 more permanent, agriculturally based Hohokam villages in this part of the Gila drainage. Material from four homestead sites is being integrated with data from "Le Project du Garbage" (Rathje and Hughes, University of Arizona) to compare rural consumer behavior with that of an urban counterpart. The Papago Indian Roads Project of the Western Archaeological Center, National Park Service, directed by John Clonts, has completed Phase II fieldwork in the Quijotoa Valley on the Papago Reservation. Douglas Brown, with a crew of five tribe members, surface-sampled, tested, and excavated ten sites. These included portions of two Sells phase (Classic period) villages, and an extensive Archaic campsite and activity area. Laboratory analysis by Jane Rosenthal is focusing on problems of settlement and subsistence in this little-known area. Phase III roadwork, survey, and site location was initiated in June 1975 by Gary Somers. Seven major sites were encountered including historic mines, Papago villages, Topawa and Sells phase villages, and an elongated area of bedrock mortars. During 1974-75 the Arizona Archaeological and Historical Society conducted an intensive survey of Tumamoc Hill, a large Classic period Hohokam "fortified" hill site west of Tucson, to inventory the rapidly disappearing archaeological resources and provide a plan for a public educational archaeology trail. In addition, research was oriented toward gaining an understanding of the relationship between "fortified" hills and villages that often occur at their bases, as well as the relationships among the various aspects of a "fortified" hill: work areas, structures, wall systems, trails, agricultural features, and petro- glyphs. The feasibility of dating plainware sherds by the alpha-recoil track method is being examined. W. Bruce Masse (Arizona College of Technology) is directing a field school at the Big Ditch site, a Hohokam village near Winkleman. The site is believed to have been continuously occupied from A.D. 600 to 1300. Information gathered from the site and from three small multicomponent villages excavated by the Arizona State Museum Highway Salvage Program near Redington should provide new insights into the nature of the relationships between the Hohokam, Mogollon, and Ootam cultures in the San Pedro River Valley. TEXAS. In July 1975 the Archaeology Research Program (S.M.U.) directed by S. Alan Skinner tested four sites on Sulphur and Three-Mile Draws on the western edge of the Salt Basin, north of Van Horn, Culberson County. The sites will be affected by Soil Conservation Service floodwater-retarding structures, and testing was conducted to determine if future excavation was warranted. Three sites have El Paso phase components, and one is Archaic. Preliminary analysis suggests that these sites are part of a seasonal round in which a population indigenous to the Salt Flat Basin participated. RICHARD G. VIVIAN MESOAMERICA HONDURAS. Paul F. Healy (Rutgers University) has been engaged in fieldwork in N.E. Honduras. When work began there in 1973 he served as field director for a Peabody Museum site survey, directed by Gordon Willey. Some 16 aboriginal sites dating from about 1200 B.C. (Cuyamel Caves) to the Historic period were located and sampled. Excavations in 1973 concentrated on a Selin period (A.D. 600-900) site (H-CN-4: Williams Ranch) with surface reconnaissance of other earlier and later localities. In the summer of 1975, a Rutgers-National Geographic Project was led by Healy into the same region. Efforts were con- centrated on a sizable Cocal period (A.D. 900-1526) settlement called Rio Claro (H-CN-12). This site covers nearly 1 km2 and was marked by more than 50 stone-faced earthen mounds of sizes ranging from 5 to 30 m in length. The site shows indications of having been fortified. Radiocarbon dates are expected in 1976, and work will continue near Trujillo (Depart- ment of Colon) next year. Between May and August 1975, through the Proyecto de la Universidad de Honduras, Roberto Reyes Mazzoni (Banco Centroamericano de In- tegraci6n Econ6mica), assisted by Ricardo Agurcia (Universidad de Honduras), carried out investigations in Comayagua and the zone of Tegucigalpa. One result was the discovery of six sites with rock art not previously reported; four have petroglyphs and two have pictographs. All are rockshelters except the last, in which three caves were found with paintings in two styles, one superimposed over the other. The floor was cleaned, and sherds with Usulutan negative decoration were found opposite, but not in association with, the paintings. The paintings and petroglyphs are believed to be Late Classic to Protohistoric on the basis of the motifs that appear in them. Most important is the superimposition of designs that allows a relative sequence to be established. The investigators believe that most of the motifs are Mesoamericani. From June 22 to 28, the Primera Reunion de Antrop6logos e Historiadores de Centroamerica y Mexico, organized by the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Honduras and the Sociedad Mexicana de Antropologfa, on "The Frontiers of Mesoamnerica," was held. Two hundred seven participants from Central America, France, Germany, and Spain were registered. NICARAGUA. Paul F. Healy (Rutgers University) has finished the write-up of a sizable portion of the Norweb and Willey S.W. Nicaragua materials from 1959-61. These were analyzed and presented as his Ph.D. dissertation entitled "Archaeological Survey of the Rivas Region, Nicaragua." The study serves to firm up the chronological sequence for the Rivas region of the so-called Greater Nicoya Subarea and includes a detailed description of the ceramics from Rivas (order- ing these within a Type-Variety system). The study provides the only in-depth analysis of the archaeology of S.W. Nicaragua and a detailed culture history from the Zoned Bichrome period through the Late Poly- chrome and Historic periods. SAN SALVADOR. Karen 0. Brulms, assisted by Charles Cecil (San Francisco State University) and F. Margarita Solis (Museo Nacional "David J. Guzrnan"), began a survey and mapping project at the site of</page><page sequence="13">CURRENT RESEARCH 225 Cihuatan, Department of San Salvador. One hundred eighty-one structures were mapped, including some large pyramidal structures and a new ball court, as well as numerous house mounds, small platform mounds, terraces, and so on. The urban nature of the site was established, and the preliminary work suggests that Cihuatan has both a Classic and a Postclassic com- ponent, although it is generally regarded as a single (Postclassic) period site. Further survey to establish the site's absolute limits, mapping, and excavation are planned. JAIME LITVAK KING CENTRAL AMERICA NICARAGUA. Lydia L. Wyckoff (University of New Haven; Museum of the American Indian) reports on an archaeological survey of 22 sites, from the Pacific Coast along the Le6n-Metagalpa road, north- east to the foothills of the Cordillera Dariense. The aims of the survey were to locate trade and migration routes from Mesoamerica into the Nicaraguan Pacific Coast, and to define settlement patterns during the Early Polychrome and later periods. Richard W. Magnus (Yale University; Banco Central de Nicaragua) continues his efforts to define cultural complexes and ecological interactions between the central (Chontales) and the Atlantic (Zelaya) sectors of eastern Nicaragua. He suggests that the Atlantic coast cultural traditions extended inland as far as La Gatiada in Chontales, from where the central zone traditions extend westward. The central zone appears to have had little contact with the Pacific coast, and virtually none with the Atlantic. Ecological interactions between the highlands and the lowlands were minimal. Within the lowlands, however, there seems to have been an extensive interchange which Magnus is trying to document by large-scale excava- tions of two sites, one on the coast, the other inland, belonging to the same archaeological complex. COSTA RICA. Michael J. Snarskis (Columbia University; Museo Nacional de Costa Rica) reports on a lithic site from the Linea Viegja region which, on preliminary inspection, suggests a two-component Paleoindian occupation with fluted and fishtail pro- jectile points. Careful stratigraphic excavation is con- templated for the future. Carlos H. Aguilar (Laboratorio de Arqueologfa, Universidad de Costa Rica) has continued his research on the Central Plateau, at the site of Tatiscu, about 2 km east of Cartago. His efforts to document the period between 300 B.C. and A.D. 300 have proven fruitful. Frederick Lange (Beloit College and Museo Nacional de Costa Rica) made a preliminary survey of the Rio Sardinal Valley in Guanacaste Province during January 1975. The valley connects the Pacific Coast with the Tempisque River Valley, and has large shell middens present as much as four hours' walk inland. The sites found in the course of survey fall within the 300 B.C.-A.D. 1520 time-span. They will be the focus of future researchi. Laura L. de Minelli (Institute of Anthropology, Bologna) has been surveying the Barrahonda de Nicoya area in Guanacaste. The Primer Congreso de Antropologia de la Defensa del Patrimonio Cultural de la Am6rica Central met in San Jos6 between June 30 and July 6, under the auspices of several national institutions: Instituto de Estudios Centroamericanos (IECA); Fundaci6n CEDAL; Ministerio de Cultura; Escuela de Ciencias del Hombre; and Museo Nacional. Two simultaneous sessions were held on different campuses. At La Catalina, official delegates from the Central American nations, (educators, lawyers, civil leaders, and archae- ologists), met to discuss the formulation of policies that would effectively protect the antiquities of these areas. At the Laboratorio de Arqueologfa, en la Universidad Nacional, a group of European, Central and North American archaeologists, under the joint chairmanship of Claude F. Baudez and Carlos H. Aguilar, met to work out, with the help of artifactual collections brought by each participant, the space-time coordinates of the most important archaeological complexes in this area. Some attempt was also made to define the frontiers between the Mesoamerican, Central American, and northern South American culture-areas. PANAMA. Between January and May, 1975, Richard G. Cooke (Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute), assisted by Katherine S. Sargent (Idaho State) resumed excavations at Sitio Sierra on the north bank of the Santa Marfa River in Cocl6 Province, after two previous seasons of testing in 1971 and 1973. This year, a far larger area of Sitio Sierra was opened up to document more fully the ecological history of this site during its 1,700 years of occupation. Although the four major polychrome periods of the central provinces are represented (R. Cooke, The Archeology of Cocle Province, Panamd. Unpublished Ph.D. dis- sertation, University of London), the most important occupation was that of phase IV (A.D. 200 to 500), which pre-dates the well known Sitio Conte graves (S. K. Lothrop, Cocle, an Archaeological Study of Central Panama, Parts I and II, Memoirs of the Peabody Museum, Harvard University, 1937 and 1942). Phase IV at Sitio Sierra yielded a number of house-structures with their associated fire-pits, hearths, refuse-areas, and a cemetery whose contents (including a celt- maker's tool-kit) suggests craft-specialization of a high order. Preservation of faunal and floral remains in this semi-arid zone was excellent. Among the organic remains found by Cooke and Sargent were those of open savanna and scrubland species (Odocoileus, Dasypus), numerous fragments of charred maize (C. Earle Smith, personal communication), and a localized riverine and estuarine fauna that included, besides river turtles (Pseudemys and Kinesternon), iguana, and ducks, a large sample of Pimelodid and Ariid catfish. Cooke's research shows that the ecological transforma- tion of the central Panamanian provinces was well underway at the beginning of the Christian era, and was associated with deforestation and seed-agriculture in annually replenishable alluvial soils. During the months of July and August 1975, the early ceramic shell midden of Monagrillo (Parita Bay, Central Panama) was re-excavated by Anthony J.</page><page sequence="14">226 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 41, No. 2, 1976] Ranere (Temple University) and Olga F. Linares (Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute), in col- laboration with Richard G. Cooke (Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute) and Oscar Velarde (Museo Nacional de Panama). C. Shelton, R. McCarty, E. J. Rosenthal, K. Sargent, and R. White assisted in the excavationis. Monagrillo had been extensively ex- cavated in 1948 and 1952 (see G. Willey and C. McGimsey, The Monagrillo Culture of Panama, Pea- body Museum Papers, v. 49, No. 2, 1954), when approximately 435 m2 of the site were removed. In conitrast, the recent excavations were rather more intenisive (three cuts were opened), with excavations being conducted by hand-trowelling in micro- stratigraphic units. Fine screening of the deposit and column sampling were employed to collect floral and faunal remains whichi will be used to reconstruct the subsistence patterns in existence at that time, and the enlvironmenital conditions under whiclh they were developed. A number of living surfaces were identified in the two-meter thick deposits, both above and below the level from which came the single radiocarbon determination of 4090?70 radiocarbon years: B.C. 2140 (Y-585) (see Radiocarbon Supplement 1:166-67, 1959). In late August, 1975, Antlhony J. Raniere and Richalrd McCarty (Temple University), assisted by R. G. Cooke anid 0. F. Linares (Smitlhsoniian Tropical Researchl Institute) anid 0. Velarde (Musco Nacional de Paniamd) and C. Shelton (Temple University), conducted a brief second field season of excavations at the preceramic and early ceramic Aguadulce Shelter, located in the coastal lowland plains of Central Panama (see Current Research, American Antiquity 39[2, part 1], 1974). Two cuts were excavated to a maximum depth of 80 cm in order to increase the size of floral, faunal, lithic, and ceramic samples recovered in the previous 1973 excavations. This season's excava- tions provided better stratigraphic separation of ceramic and preceramic components, and more reliable charcoal samples for dating these components. The ceramics and associated edge-ground cobble com- plex of the upper component is identical to that found at the Monagrillo site. The preceramic component shared a number of characteristics with the nearby preceramic shell midden of Cerro Mangote (see McGimsey, Cerro Mangote: a Preceramic Site in Panama, Americani Antiquity 22[2], 1956), which has a single radiocarbon determination of 6810?100 radio- carbon years: B.C. 4860. Finally, from March 23 to 30, Panama had its own special symposium on tropical-forest agro-ecosystems, organized by Olga F. Linares, and financed by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute under the direction of Ira Rubinoff. The seminar was held at Barro Colorado Island, which encouraged the free interaction of the invited participants (Alicia and Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff, Erika Wagner, Alberta Zucchi, C. Earle Smith, Alan Covich, Anthony J. Ranere, and Richard G. Cooke) with a number of STRI biologists who are working on the dynamics of tropical-forest "natural" ecosystems. A number of interested Panamanian and North American biology and anthropology students also participated in the informal discussions, and in the more structured presentations of current research. OLGA F. LINARES NORTHWESTERN SOUTH AMERICA COLOMBIA. John P. Marwitt (University of Akron) and Rupert K. Spillman (Fundaci6n Vivimos Mejor, Cali) conducted a brief reconnlaissance near Valle. At least four distinctive shaft tomb and burial urn styles are present in the area which is affiliated with the poorly known Calima culture (500 B.C.-A.D. 1500). Carson N. Murdy (INDERENA, Peace Corps) is conducting a survey in the Tayrona National Park to inventory the resources, provide estimates of prehis- toric population density, and determine the interrela- tions between various economnic and social activities. To date, there is evidence of villages composed of clusters of houses in dispersed nuclei (e.g., Pueblito), village clusters in small valleys, cemeteries with burials arraniged in plots according to the status or social affiliation of the deceased, agricultural terraces, water reservoirs, fishinlg camps, salt works, ceremoniial sites or shrinies and anl extensive road system partially paved wvith granite slabs. ECUADOR. Henning Bischof (Museum of Anthro- pology, Mannheim) continued work on late Valdivia and early Machalilla materials from sites near Palmar and Valdivia (Prov. del Guayas). A four-part sequence was establislhed for Maclialilla on the basis of the Palmar stratigraplhy. Period II appears to have arrived on the Guayas coast already fully developed; it is the oldest Machalilla period present in the Palmar/Valdivia area. At six of eight sites it is associated with Valdivia C/D (VII/VIII) materials. It is suggested that this is due to the continued occupation of the sites rather thani to prolonged coexistance of the two traditions. Diagnostic for Machalilla II are the Machalilla Double- line Incised; Incised anid Red Zoned; and Punctate and Red Zoned pottery types hitherto attributed to later Machalilla periods. Ayangue Incised is the main decorative pottery type of Machalilla IV. In January 1975 Bischof and Julio Viteri G. resumed work at the Valdivia site (G-31). The 1971 cut and part of Emilio Estrada's 1961 cut J were reopened and excavation continued to the south. The superposition of Valdivia phase refuse over stratified San Pedro phase layers was again clearly established. Beside stone and shell artifacts, 30 additional San Pedro phase sherds were recovered from a series of superimposed hearths (some of them paved), with no Valdivia materials associated except in the uppermost two strata (of 13, totalling 120 cm in depth). Only the lowermost 20 cm of the midden did not yield sherds. Considering the low sherd density of San Pedro midden, this might be due to a sampling accident. The case for a preceramic occupation at the site is weakened. Another late Valdivia/Machalilla II contact site was discovered and sampled 200 m south of the Valdivia</page><page sequence="15">CURRENT RESEARCH 227 type site. There are now five known sites of this period from within 750 m of the Valdivia site. From August 1974 through August 1975, exten- sive field investigations have been carried out by a team involving the University of Illinois, the Banco Central of Ecuador, Florida State Museum, and the University of Guayaquil. The work was cenitered at the Valdivia culture site of Real Alto, a short distance from Chanduy. Real Alto is a large site about 400 by 500 meters. It is clear that the depth of midden has been greatly reduced by wind erosion sinice the terminal occupation of this site, but a meter of midden remains over much of the site. It was the purpose of the field session to determine the nature of the Valdivia community and the nature of the economic system which supported these very early ceramic making people. It was possible during the year to locate anid map remains of over 70 houses, anid the occupational floors of three houses were totally excavated with very precise controls. Some prelimi- nary statements as to the history of occupation at the site can now be made. The earliest component consists of a shallow midden of Anadara tuberculosa. Within this midden the remains of several small oval struc- tures were recovered. The evidence suggests that flexible poles were bent toward the center of the structure so that the basic construction was rather like the typical wigwam of the northeast United States. Overlying the pre-Valdivia midden, which contained only a few sherds of a thin hard pottery not in the Valdivia tradition, and extending over about a quarter of the site was an occupation representing early Valdivia II. No complete ground plans of Valdivia II houses were recovered, but the impression from various living surfaces which were exposed was that the houses were larger and more permanent than was the case with the pre-Valdivia occupation. During the Valdivia III occupation, the site reached maximum size with orderly rows of houses extending at least 400 meters and surrounding a central open area which must be considered as a plaza. Two structures of specialized function faced each other across this public space. In Valdivia VI and VII times the on-site population seems to have decreased while dispersed hamlets became common. "Ceremonial" activity in the two specialized structures increased in frequency. We would seem to be witnessing a shift from the kind of compact inward-lookinig community typical of the modern G6 and Bororo towns to a community with a central, ceremonial precinct serving a more widely distributed population, a situation with at least the potential of growing into a Mesoamerican type ceremonial center. The large, sturdily constructed houses typical of the Valdivia III occupation were oval with vertical closed walls finished in the wattle-and-daub technique. The interior post arrangement suggests high thatched roofs. Each house was occupied over a considerable span of time. All economic data suggest a dependence on inten- sive maize agriculture. Two domesticated dogs from a secure Valdivia III context are the earliest so far encountered in South America. Laboratory research on the preceramic occupations of the northern highlands is under way at the University of Oklahoma. Typological analysis of sur- face collections, undertaken by Ernesto E. Salazar, has shown that an archaeological complex may have developed in the highlands, around Ilalo mountain (Pichincha Province). The little variability of the assemblages may indicate conitemporaneity, or a short span of time involved in the different occupations of the sites so far analyzed (Chinchiloma I, Chinchiloma II, Pucara I, Pucara II, Bellavista, and San Cavetano sites). An opposed view, however, may arise from obsidian hydration studies, recently undertaken by Robert E. Bell. The thickness of hydration rims of artifacts from several sites ranges between 1 and 11 microns. This suggests that the preceramic occupations of el Inga complex may cover a longer span of time thani Salazar's analysis indicates. Since the hydration rate for the highlands of Ecuador is still unknown, no obsidian dates are available yet. Alan Osborn and Stepheni Athens (New Mexico) continued work in the north highlands in cooperation with the Instituto Otavelafio de Antropologfa. At the Socapamba site, near Ibarra, they excavated three mounds. Mound 18 is a low-lying mound about 60 m in diameter. It contained several floors of prepared earth. At the base of the mound part of an irrigation canal was discovered. Ceramics from the upper fill included red line on buff ware, characteristic of the latest period. Pottery from the lowest level is different but resembles the ceramics from the lower levels of the La Chimba site. Four burials and lithic, floral, and faunal remains were also recovered. Mound 19 is a hemispherical mound, 30 m across and 5 m high. It was constructed in several stages from earth blocks and loose fill. The burial accompanied by the largest number of vessels had been placed in a large shaft prior to the completion of the last stage. Other burials had been placed in shallow shafts after the completion of the last stage. Grave goods included compotes of thin orange ware and red slip ware, sometimes with zoomorphic applique figures peering over the rim. Pieces diagnostic of the earlier of later phases of Mound 18 were not found. Tests on the summit of Mound 21, a pyramidal mound with ramp, identified an eroded surface into which a fired trough-like feature had been molded. Red line on buff sherds were found in the fill and on the surface. The radiocarbon date of A.D. 760 (CWR 146) previously reported probably represents an earlier occupation incorporated in the mound fill. Osborn's and Athens' renewed excavations in a refuse mound at the La Chimba site (3171 m a.s.l.) near Mt. Cayambe revealed 2.5 m of stratified midden which included material suggestive of trade in manioc, maize, obsidian, occa, and sea shells. Examination of lithic debitage in conjunction with the analysis of 70 kilos of faunal material by Elizabeth Wing (Florida State Museum) and floral analysis by Barbara Pickers- gill (U. Redding) will provide data to generate a model of human population growth in the nearby valley. Early materials from the site are associated with a date of 1220?140 radiocarbon years: A.D. 730 (CWR-72).</page><page sequence="16">228 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 41, No. 2,19761 A radiocarbon assay on bone from a shaft grave (without chamber) from Im-1 1, near Otavalo, has produced a date of 2270+130 radiocarbon years: 820 -140 B.C. (DIC-195). THOMAS P. MYERS AMAZON AND EASTERN BRAZIL PERU. Warren DeBoer (Queens College, CUNY) and Peter Roe (University of Delaware) continued their investigation of contemporary Shipibo and Conibo art of eastern Peru. This art style derives from the Cumancaya tradition, archaeological traces of which have been extensively studied at several sites along the Ucayali River. During the summer of 1975, DeBoer studied developmental stages in children's acquisition of the rules of their art style, while Roe focused on the applicability of various gramrnatical models for the generation of Shipibo art. COLOMBIA. During July and August 1975, John P. Marwitt (University of Akron) and Robert V. Morey (Western Illinois University) continued a series of test excavations in the Ariari river drainage of Western Meta. The ten sites sampled to date pertain to small villages located on the alluvial floodplain of the Rio Ariari, and are tentatively dated to about A.D. 1000. No sites have been found in the interfluvial savannas. Sherd tempered pottery is most common, but sand and cariape tempered pottery has also been found. The dominant decorative techniique consists of red paint on unslipped exterior surfaces. Incised sherds and zoomorphic adornos are fairly common, and a sinigle anthropomorphic burial urn has been reported from a private collection. Other materials from the excavated sites include large manos and petaloid stone celts. Cultural at'finities of the Ariari are believed to be with the polychroine styles of the Amazoni Basin. EASTERN BRAZIL. Parand. Igor Chnmyz (Univer- sidade lederal do Parana) reports that research was performed in four areas of Parana. Participating in this research were Igor Chmyz, Lygia G. Chmyz, Jodo Carlos G. Chmyvz Alicia Duran, Elve Lamb, Elianie Maria Romanowski, and Celso Perota. Both ceramic and preceramic sites have beeni recenitly discovered along the coast of Parand. One preceramic site was excavated in the district of Alexanidra (municfpio of Paranaguc). Flaked projectile points, scrapers, axes, choppers, and anivil stones were found. An absence of evidence for the utilization of marine resources in- dicated that the site pertained to a huntinig and gatlhering culture. The closest affiniities of this hunting and gathering site are witlh the Bituruna phase of the Igauyu subtradition of the Planalto of Parand, whiclh has been tentatively dated to about 4,000 years ago. The second area of Paranid subject to researchi is the Devoniana escarpmenit of the Planalto. One ot the many rockslhelters of this area containis pictographs of deer, rhea, and anthropomorphic figures. Designs composed of lines and dots are also found. Excava- tions into the one meter of cultural deposits of this rockshelter have yielded great quantities of stone artifacts including projectile points, knives, and scrapers. Pieces of hematite of the color used to make the pictographs were also found. This cave with pictographs is believed to be of the Potinga phase of the Iguaq6 tradition which dates to about 3,000 years ago. A nearby cave with 3.40 m of cultural deposit was found to include three distinct occupations. The most recent component dating to A.D. 1050, conitains ceramics of the Casa de Pedra tradition. The affinity of the middle, preceramic component has not been identified, while the deepest component is believed to be of the same phase as the rockshelter with the pictographs. The third area of research investigated by Igor Chmyz and hlis team of archaeologists is the upper portion of the Iguaqu river. A concentration of preceramic Potinga phase sites has been found near Umbara. Test excavations revealed up to 50 cm of cultural deposits. These preceramic sites are found to extend below the high water level of the Iguaqu river, while ceramic bearing sites of the Itarar6 and neo- Brazilian traditions are always found well above the high water level. The fourth research project was begun in July and will continue for the next seven years. The project is designed to carry out research in the area of the future Itaipu hydroelectric plant and reservoir. The project is being co-sponsored by the Empresa Binacional Itaipu, Instituto do Patrim6nio Hist6rico c Artistico Nacional and the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimenito Cientifico e Tecn- ol6gico. Goids. The Goias archaeological program of the Instituto Anchietano de Pesquisas and the Universi- dade Cat6lica de Goias has continued into its third year of research. Pedro Ignacio Schmitz (Instituto Anchietanio de Pesquisas) is directing the program with the collaboration of Irmhild Wiist, Altair Sales Barbosa, and Humberto A. Lagiglia. The 1975 season was spent surveying and testing sites along two tributary rivers of the Paranaiba, the Claro and the Verde. Five Tupiguarani sites and thirteen rockshelters with pictographs and petroglyphs were found. The painted subtradition is evidenced at four of the Tupiguarani sites, while at the fifth site only cor- rugated pottery occurs. None of the ceramic bearing sites yields materials that can be related to the phases of the nearby Araguaia river. The rockshelters are found in the sandstone of the Bauru formation. Gray, black, and red ceramic wares with either vegetable fiber or cariape temper are found in the upper levels of the shelters. These ceramic wares cannot be placed in any of the known coastal traditions of Brazil, and Sclhmitz suggests that they may be more closely related to the ceramic traditions of Matto Grosso. In the larger shelters, cultural deposits extend to a depth of 170 cm. These deepest levels only contain chipped stone artifacts and are believed to be as much as 6,000 years old. Rock paintings found associated with the shelters have been classified as either naturalistic or geometric, and it is believed that the geometric paintings are older. The petroglyphs which consist of parallel anid converging lines and cross-hatching are believed to be most recent. Minas Gerais. Ondemar Dias (Instituto de Arqueologia Brasileira) continued to work in the</page><page sequence="17">CURRENT RESEARCH 229 upper portion of the Sao Francisco River Valley. Three cave sites containing artifacts of the Bambuf series and one open site of the Pinhuf phase of the Una ceramic tradition were found. Two other open sites with ceramics of the Sapucaf tradition are being salvaged in the area of the Grande and Sapucaf rivers to the east of the Sao Francisco. Rio de Janeiro. Ondemar Dias reports that test excavations were performed at ten sites on the central coast of Rio de Janeiro. Nine of these were sambaquis, while the tenth was a cave containing neo-Brazilian artifacts. Three other sites on the north coast of Rio de Janeiro were tested. Two of these were sambaquis, while the third was an open hunting and collecting site of the Itaipu tradition. Ondemar Dias, Eliana Cara- valho, Marcus I. Vieira, and Lilia Cheuiche continued to excavate the three-component Fazenda Botafogo site (RJ-JC-64). A total of 80 m2 of this site have been excavated to a depth ranging from 1.60 m to 2.20 m. Of the approximately 50 burials that have been excavated most have been found in primary, extended positions with a thin covering of ocher. Shell and bone artifacts have been found associated with many of the burials. Linear and circular arrangements of post holes have also been found at the site. The stratigraphy of the central portion of the site indicates that there has been an alternation of wet and dry climate. The stratigraphy of the surrounding refuse area of the site gives further indications that there may have been a corresponding shift in subsistence patterns, alternating between hunting and fishing and mussel gathering. By comparing the Fazenda Botafogo site with other Itaipu sites, Ondemar Dias estimates that the site was occupied by about 4000 B.C. An Una phase com- ponent of a much younger date overlies the Itaipu componient at Fazenda Botafogo. Guanabara. Eliana Carvalho and Marcus Vicira (Centro de E'studos Arqueol6gicas and the Instituto dc Arqueologia Brasileira) are analyzing archaeological remains that continue to be found in excavations for the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitano. A number of incomplete skeletons, colonial and neo-Brazilian ceramics and metal artifacts have been collected and studied. Piaui. In the southeast of Piaui, Niede Guidon and Silvia Maranca have continued their research under the sponisorship of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique and the Museu Paulista da Universidade de Sao Paulo. This research has led to the discovery of 115 cave sites with pictographs. Niede Guidon has established a typology of the pictographs, and Silvia Maranca is now applying that typology to the zoo- morphic paintings of Piauf. Silvia Maranca also has recently completed excavations at the ceramic bearing site, Aldeia da Queimada. RONALD L. WEBER ANDEAN SOUTH AMERICA PERRU. In a study of ethnicity on the North Coast, Richard Schaedel (University of Texas) carried out extensive reconnaissance between Tumbez and Casma to identify Chimu sub-capitals and capitals of Inca provinces. He was assisted by Luis Millones (Univer- sidad Cat6lica), Maria Rostworoski de Diez Canseco, Susana Ramirez, and Patricia Netherly (SUNY Fredonia), who provided ethnohistorical data from their own North Coast research projects. John R. Smith (University of Texas) and Walter Alva (Instituto Nacional de Cultura) surveyed from the Motupe to Santa valleys to determine the extension of highland occupation into coastal environments during Early Intermediate anid Middle Horizon times. In collabor- ation with Alva, Armando Pereira, Oscar Lostenau (Instituto Nacional de Cultura), and Herbert Eling (University of Texas), Schaedel excavated at Cerro Canoncillo (Mojullape) on the south bank of the Jequetepeque, a site with Mochica, Cajamarca, and Middle Horizon components. Eling will continue work at Ventanillas, upstream from Cafioncillo, in a study of the water control system of the south bank from Early Intermediate times to the sixteenth century. Martha Anders (Cornell University), working for Kent Day (Royal Ontario Museum) in the Lambaye- que Valley, writes that functional differentiation of storage structures has beeni identified at Pampa Grande. Apparently only finished products were kept in the formal stores; raw products were put in large "warehouses" conveniently located on major access/ entry points to the site. From there, material may have been redistributed for processing, then collected and placed in stores in the restricted-access core area of Pampa Grande. Shelia and Thomas Pozorski (University of Texas) analyzed material from their previous excavations in the Moche Valley and studied the storage areas at Cahioncillo. T. Pozorski reconnioitered formative sites in other North Coast valleys and S. Pozorski in- vestigated maritime resource procurement and con- sumption through time and space in fishing villages between Viru and San Jose. Antonio Rodriguez SuySuy (Universidad de Trujillo) excavated in a small huaca near Chiquitoy and at Cerro Yugo in the Chicama Valley. The latter site showed evidence of occupation from Preceramic through Inca times, almost all of which appears to have been temporal and related to the function of the site as a node of exchange between permanently settled centers in different ecological zones of the Chicama and adjacent valleys. Michael Moseley (Harvard University), assisted by Eric Deeds and Colleen Beck, surveyed and mapped parts of the irrigation and field systems on the pampas north of Chan Chan. In Chan Chan itself Elizabeth Hart studied the subsidiary annexes to the ciudadelas. Alan Kolata and Anthony Kurland worked on the temporal development of the city, studying changes in the manufacture and use of adobes. Erik Trinkaus analyzed skeletal material from the Chan Chan-Moche Valley Project. Robert Feldman (Harvard University) completed analysis of his Preceramic and Early Horizon collec- tions from Aspero and other sites near Supe. The Aspero materials indicate that a much higher level of social complexity was possessed by Perceramic peoples than has previously been recognized, a complexity based almost entirely on marine resources. Survey in the Supe Valley shows a substantial early ceramic</page><page sequence="18">230 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 41, No. 2,1976] occupation that continues the patternis set in Pre- ceramic times. Curtiss Brennan (University of Arizona) mapped and excavated at the Saliniar phase site of Cerro Arena in the Moche Valley. Building on results of previous investigationis by 'liaas Mujica, Brennan mapped two square kilometers of the central area, structure by structure, and cleared a variety of structures in an attempt to define patterns of status ditferentiation and functional specializationi. In additioni to surveys of the lower Huarmey Valley anid studies of lithic techniiology anid typology, Duccio Bonavia (Universidad Cayetanio Heredia) ex- cavated at Los Gavilanies, the anicient name for Huarmey North 1 or PV35-1. He recovered more remains ot maize, dating to late Preceramic times, which are under study by Alexander Grobman. This maize is probably related to the Andean race Confite Moroclho. Bonavia's report will cover both current excavations and those from 1960. Craig Morris (American Museum of Natural His- tory) continues his researchi on Inca urbanism at Huanuco Pampa; the 1975 seasoIn was devoted to study of the cnormous ceramic collections from previous seasoIns. The alim of the pottery analysis, which emphasizes functionial attributes, is understanid- ing of the Inca period use of the various buildings and sectors of the city. The French archaeological mi.ssion in Junin, super- vised by Dani&amp;lc Lavallhe (Institut Franyais D'Etudes Andines) conitinued its work in the districts of San Pedro de Cajas and Palcamnayo. Sites discovered in 1974 and 1975 include 21 villages or clustered habitats probably dating from the Late Intermiiediate period, 15 rockslhelters of the same age, 9 shelters occupied since the Formative period, and 7 slhelters occupied since Preceramic times. F'xcavation begani at Telarmaclhay, a slhelter located at 4,420 meters eleva- tion in the puna, where occupation spans the Pre- ceramic and lormative periods. Formative use of the site was probably seasonial, from November until June. William Isbell (SUNY Binghamtoni) has mapped several Middle Horizon sites in the Ayacucho Valley, including Jincamiioqo at Cabana anid parts ot Huari. At the latter visible remains were mapped over a strip about 1.5 km by .5 km, from Ushpajoto to Capilla Pata. He also collected slherds from the surtface anid from a road cut made through the ceniter of Huari in 1974. Isbell collaborated with the Instituto Nacional de Cultura, Rogger Ravines, and Alberto Carbajal in 1975 excavations at the U-shaped pyramid complex of Garagay betweeni the Rimac and Lurin valleys near Lima. Modeled anid polychrome murals near the top of the main pyramid predate Chavinoid murals founld by Jose Casafranca in 1959. Other major finds include a circular sunkeni court in the southeastern portion of the great plaza and several examples of portable art, two of which represent the "smiling god" of Chavin de Huantar. In Lima Isbell mapped and excavated in the large enclosure in the soutlhwesterni part of the Maranga site. Alberto Carbajal (Instituto Nacional de Cultura) continues to work at Maranga. The large enclosure is clearly late, containing muclh Huanclho refuse anid some local Inca style pottery. Although parts are underlain by a substantial settlement with late Lima style pottery, all visible features associated with the great enclosure belonig to the Late Intermediate period and/or Late Horizon. The enclosure includes the Huaca Palma and was probably the residence and ceniter of power of a curaca governing at the time of the Spaniislh conquest. At least part of the walled enclosure was densely occupied by a permanent population, which was probably the source of the late burials reported by Kroeber and others from the pyramids just to the north. John Rowe and Patricia Lyon (University of California, Berkeley) excavated near Cuzco witlh the participation of Catherinie Julienl, Coleen Beck, and Percy Paz Flores (Universidad del Cuzco). They made a number of stratigraphlic tests at Tarawi, finding what appeared to be undisturbed habitation refuse. Lyon's preliminary analysis shows that Tarawi was apparently conitinuously occupied from early in the Middle Horizon until almost the end of the Late Intermediate period. She was able to establislh a ceramic sequence for this occupation that includes the beginnings of the K'illki pottery style. Julien studied Inca burials in the Cuzco area and is preparing a report on a group trom Sacsalhuamani excavated for Valcdrcel in 1934. George Miller undertook a study of Andean camnclid osteology, the aim of whiclh was to develop methods for identifying the closely related camelids trom their bones, an obvious prerequisite for studyinig the arclhaeological evidenice for domestication. Miller was assisted by IVITA (Instituto Veterinario de Investigacionies Tropicales y de Altura), clliefly througlh Dr. Julio Sumar and the staff of the camelid experimenit statioin at La Raya. In addition to the study of bones of animals witlh known histories, Miller made controlled studies of moderni butclhering techi- niques and studied moderni refuse for bone conltenlt. He then analyzed two collectionis of archiaeological bonies, onie trom Marcavalle for Lufs Barreda, and one from the Inca site of Qhata Q'asa Llaqta for Jose Gonzales Corrales. Miller also trained Percy Paz Flores in bone identificationi and made samnple collections for a number of interested Peruviani institutions. Richard Burger continued hi.s studies of Peruvian obsidian with the collaborationi of Frank Assaro (Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, Berkeley), who made available the Laboratory's facilities for neutroni activation analysis. This teclhnique provides an ideal control for the rapid scani X-ray fluorescenice analysis with whiclh Burger did his initial work. The obsidian from Peru and Bolivia anialyzed so far comes from a surpr-isingly limited numiiber of sources miostly, dis- tributed southi of Huancavelica. Rowe served as a UNFSCO consultanit in arclhae- ology at Cuzco from July throughi Septemnber. 1975, participatinig in an interniational training course ill Andean archaeology and making recomn mendatiolls for arclhaeological work at sites sclheduled for develop- mient as tourist attractionis (Maclhu Picch1u, Pisac. Tamnbomachay, and Qorikanclha). Other arclhaeological lecturers were Alberto Rex Gonizalez (Museo de La Plata), HeruTahi Crespo Toral (INAH, Ecuador), and Lufs G. Lumbreras. Lumbreras (Museo Nacional de Antropologfa y Arqueologia) also conducted a field school at Pucara (Puno) excavating principally in the</page><page sequence="19">CURRENT RESEARCH 231 area of Inca occupation. Percy Paz Flores directed a small salvage excava- tion at an early colonial site in Cuzco cleared for a construction project. Alfredo Valencia and Arminda Gibaja de Valencia directed excavations at Qorikancha in the area of the Inca terraces below the famous curved wall. They found very complex stratigraphy with much colonial construction overlying the Inca terracing, including a street paved with cobblestones. Joel Grossman will return to Andahuaylas to refine the chronology. Earlier excavations revealed a long and discontinuous sequence from early in the Initial period to the Late Horizon. Work will focus on an effort to understand apparent massive demographic and economic changes near the beginning of the second millennium B.C. John Hyslop (Columbia University) completed his archaeological investigation of the Lupaca kingdom on the southwest side of Lake Titicaca. Ren6 Santos R. (Universidad Cat6lica Santa Maria, Arequipa) com- pleted his excavations in the Quebrada de la Vaca (Chala) and in the Valle de Sama (Tacna). At present, his activities are oriented toward the late prehistoric archaeology of the extreme south of Peru. Frederic Engel (Universidad Agraria) announces a serial publication for research in South American Prehistory and Ecology. The SAPE Papers will be available on a modular basis and will carry the complete text in Spanish, French, and English. The archaeological atlas of the Peruvian coast, drawn at 1 100,000 and showing all sites in their environmental context, will soon be available. Engel's exploration of the far South Coast is complete; he reports that sites south of the Acari River have clear affinities with Chilean (e.g., Atacameino), rather than Peruvian, cultures. Sites date from 7000 B.C. to Inca times. Particularly interesting finds include a cane raft decorated with Spondylus amulets, dated by radio- carbon to A.D. 1100, and, from a grave near Camana, a harpoon with a copper point and a toy wooden boat with paddle, fish line, and fish hook. Robert Ascher (Cornell University) and Marcia Ascher (Ithaca College) spent several months in South America and Europe rediscovering, describing, and extending understanding of Andean quipus. They have inspected and analyzed about 400 specimens beyond the 50 or so that were commonly known. The Aschers would appreciate learning about quipus that they have not yet seen. BOLIVIA. All archaeological work is now co- ordinated by the newly formed Instituto Nacional de Arqueologia, directed by Carlos Ponce Sangines. The Instituto encompasses four major research centers, plus about a dozen smaller research projects. Applica- tions for research permits must be made through the new Instituto and budgets should include an equal amount for support of Bolivian co-investigators. The Centro de Investigaciones Arqueol6gicas en Tiwanaku has completed the major portion of the excavation and restoration of the Kalasasaya temple. Gregorio Cordero Miranda directs excavations at the Putini temple, where 1974 excavations uncovered a new monolith, painted blue, and of early Classic Tiwanaku style, very similar to the monoliths from Huacullani or Luqurmata. Excavation and restoration of the Pumapunku temple are underway. The Centro de Investigaciones Arqueol6gicas en Samaipata, under the direction of Alfredo Mena, has cleared half of the site. Mena is intrigued with the recurrent pattern of constructions in units of nine. Ceramics are of both Inca manufacture and local styles. Samaipata apparently served a dual purpose as a front-line pucara and an important temple or religious center. The Centro de Investigaciones Arqueol6gicis en Iskanwaya, directed by Jorge Arellano, completed clearing operations and is excavating the structures in an attempt to work out ceramic styles. "Iskanwaya Mollo" resembles the Mollo style of the east side of Lake Titicaca. Although the architecture shows Inca influence, few Inca goods have been recovered, sug- gesting that the relationship of this site to other Inca pucaras is more complicated than originally postu- lated. An obsidian hydration date of A.D. 1530 has been reported for the complex. The Proyecto Mixto of Quallamarka, based on the earlier findings of the Portugals, was directed by Luis Girault and Juan Faldin in 1973. They delineated a small kalasasaya and its entry. In 1974, a Tiwanaku III assemblage was found, including many new forms and wares previously unrecorded. Girault returned in July, 1975, to investigate the origins of Tiwanaku, but tragically died of a heart attack shortly after he arrived. Gregorio Cordero Miranda and David L. Browman jointly excavated the temple of Chiripa during 1974 and 1975 seasons. The Middle Horizon temple was cleared, and one new stela and a fragment of a second were recovered, bringing to five the number of complete and partial stelae found at Chiripa. Browman also tested the earlier Chiripa phase temple, recovered a new pre-Chiripa ceramic style, and began preliminary work on the floral and faunal remains, reporting quinoa and potatoes at the 1000-500 B.C. level and a very elaborate bone industry. The Proyecto Arqueodemogrifico, headed by Waldo Villamor, analyzed ethnohistoric documents from Tiwanaku in an attempt to estimate population size. He investigated the relationships of various mitmaqkuna in the Lake Titicaca area, stimulated by earlier work of John Murra in Chucuito. In Cochabamba, John Knutson has been working with Rafael Urioste to better define the Mojocoya culture. New boundaries are Comarapa and Mairana on the east, Mojocoyoa on the south, and Mizque on the north. Considerable influence from Amazonia is ap- parent in the redefined Mojocoya style. Geraldine Byrne de Caballero, now director of the Museo de San Simon in Cochabamba, worked at several Inca sites in the area. At Cotapachi she recorded 2,400 circular structures that she believes are storage colca. If so, Cotapachi may be the largest Inca storage center yet recorded. She also began the mapping of Incallacta. David Davies has decided that the Jaihuayco skull from Cochabamba has certain Neanderthaloid fea- tures. Amino acid dates are said to range from 13,000 to 22,000 years ago, relating the Jaihuayco skull to the Vilcabamba skull, dated to 28,000 years ago, as</page><page sequence="20">232 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 41, No. 2,19761 part of a new Neanderthaloid stratum in South America. In Oruro, Luis Guerra and Leonardo Branisa continiue to work on the problem of the Andean mound culture. A provisional sequence beginning 1,000 years before Christ, and extending into Classic Tiwanaku times, has been proposed. Ceramic styles correlate with both the Titicaca and Cochabamba areas. Investigationis in lowland Bolivia are very limited. Under the Instituto Nacionial de Arqueologfa, a new Centro de Investigaciones Arqueol6gicas was estab- lished in Yungas. Its investigators report that fortifica- tions, causeways, etc., are much wider spread than Denevan had reported earlier. A numnber of very specific resemblances between Tiwanaku III and these Amazoniian cultures are postulated. The enitire section on Bolivia was reported by David Browman (Washinigton University). CHILE. Mario Rivera (Universidad del Norte, Arica) reports that his branch of the University has been developed primarily as a research ceniter. Rivera, Gonzalo Ampuero, Oscar I,spoueys, Guillermo Focacci, Sergio E rices, and David Berwick are working at several sites in the Azapa Valley, from 4,000 m elevation in the Altiplanio down to the coast. They hope to relate the regional cultural sequence to that of the circum-Titicaca area. Patricia Soto is studying the humnan skeletal remainis, Liliana Ulloa the textiles, Berwick the fauna, anid Erices the vegetal remainis, while Ampuero continues his very productive excava- tions at Alto Ramirez. Espoueys anid Focacci are occupied with the cataloging and documnentation of the 25,000 piece collection of the Musco Saii Miguel de Azapa. Working at the Boliviani National Archives in Sucre, Jorge Hidalgo sought ethnohistoric informna- tion on the Norte Grande for the sixteenth anid seventeenth centuries. Tristan Platt's study of Andean pastoralismn has also contributed to the understaniding of the prehistoric econiomy, as has fieldwork by Brigitte de Gonneville (Cornell University) at the precordilleran town of Belen. Agustin Llagostera, Hector Garces, Victor Bustos, and Nelson Vergara (Universidad del Norte, Anto- fagasta) continue their excavations at several sites on the coast between Tocopilla and Antofagasta. Lautaro Nufiez (Universidad del Norte, Antofagasta) has as- sumed responsibility for the Smithsonian Paleoindian Program in the Chilean North. After finishing his work at the Aragon and Tiliviche preceramic sites, N6fuez has turned his attention to the area around San Pedro de Atacama. He found deep stratified refuse at the open campsites of Tambillo and Puripica, and new work has begun at Tulan. Gustavo Le Paige (Museo San Pedro de Atacama) cooperates with the Smith- sonian program, as well as continuing his own analysis of the rich surface collections and undertaking oc- casional salvage projects. Le Paige, in recognition of his lengthy, arduous, and pioneering work on the archaeology of the Atacama, was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Universidad del Norte. Virgilio Schiappacasse and Hans Niemeyer con- tinue to work at Punta Teatinos, a Preceramic shell midden and cemetery north of La Serena. They anticipate total excavation of the cemetery, to facilitate a paleodemographic study of the population, as well as a complete, quantitative analysis of the content of the midden. The Niemeyer and Schiap- pacasse study of the Inca occupation of the Camarones Valley, south of Arica, is essentially complete. They found systematic exploitation of ecological niches ascending from the coast to the altiplano. The Inca period sites, differentiated by functioni, include administrative centers, tambos, and colonies-both agricultural and pastoral-of mitimaes from the altiplano. In 1976 they are completing the excavationi of several preagricultural sites, as part of their investigation of transhumance by late hunters and gatherers in the Camaronies Valley. Following his first volume on settlement patterns and cultural ecology in the Norte Grande, Gordon Pollard (SUNY Plattsburgh) has completed a second tome on the prehistory and desert adaptation of 13 1 ceramic stage sites surveyed anid tested from 1966-69. In the Norte Chico, Hans Niemeyer continued his independent program of excavations in the upper basin of the Copiapo River. He excavated at a well-preserved metallurgical establishment and as- sociated settlement (Vina del Cerro), a pucara (Puntilla Blanca) supposed to lhave been taken by Pedro de Valdivia, its nearby walled town (Poblado de Iglesia Colorada), a cemetery (Altos Blancos) on the banks of the El Potro tributary, and several late tambos of uniform construction, associated with the trans-Andean trails along the Pulido and Jorquera headwaters. Niemeyer calculates that there was a fairly dense population along the upper Copiapo during the time of Inica dominationi. Participants in his Copiapo culture practiced irrigation farming along the riverbanks, seasonally pastured flocks of llamas in the montanie meadows, exploited mines, mastered copper anid silver metallurgy, and maintained traffic between the lower eastern anid western slopes of the Andes. Their characteristic pottery is called Copiapo Black on Red. THOMAS F. LYNCH SOUTHERN SOUTH AMERICA ARGENTINA. (Current research, 1973-1974). Northwestern Argentina. In the Puna region, Rin- conada, Doncellas, and other ruins were explored by Lidia A. de Lanzone and Diana Rolandi de Perrot. During this work a cache, consisting of two Tiahuanacoid Keros of gold alloyed with silver, a bracelet of copper and zinc, three circular pendants of silver, and a necklace with beads of malachite, all in the interior of a vessel, was found. Pedro Krapovickas and Marta Ottonello de Garcia Reynoso worked in Yavi and in Santa Ana de Abra Laite (extensive ruins at the western foot of the Sierra de Aguilar, probably late Preincaic). Continuing his research on preceramic hunters. Jorge Fernandez (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas Y Technicas) finished excavation and study of the stratified open-air site of Rio Grande, with Saladillo unifacial and Morro Blanco Groad stemmed</page><page sequence="21">CURRENT RESEARCH 233 points, dated in 5520?270 radiocarbon years (3560 B.C.). In mid-1974 he excavated several other sites in the region of Mina Aguilar: Rio Despensas II rock- shelter (late Preceramic), Quebrada Experanza cave (material scarce, partly ceramic), Socochita rock- shelter (ceramic), Tres Cruces painted cave (ceramic), Cueva de Crist6bal (Preceramic and early ceramic, with corrugated sherds). This work forms part of a project sponsored by the Instituto de Arqueologia y Etnologia of the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo (Mendoza). Fernandez is now working out the ecolog- ical and archaeological sequence of the area, with emphasis on the typology of the projectile points. Oscar Marin (Colegio Nacional de Jujuy) and a team of students surveyed the terraced borders of the Quebrada de Humahuaca, and discovered a new coarse lithic industry, with basaltic choppers and bifaces. Jos6 Togo explored the nearly unknown region of Santa Victoria (Salta province, facing Bolivia), which yielded material belonging basically to one Preincaic ceramic culture. Alicia Femindez Distel continued studying the transition and articulation of the late Preceramic with the first agricultural and ceramic influences in the Jujuy province, surveying and excavating some sites west of Mina Pirquitas, Angosto de Sapagua, and Tiuiyaco. She recorded two important petroglyph sites: Campo Colorado near Yavi, and Angosto de Hornaditas. Bemard Dougherty (Museo de La Plata) continued the systematic study of the San Francisco complex (700 B.C.-A.D. 400) in the humid eastern Jujuy and northeast Salta region, at present the oldest ceramic group in northwestern Argentina. He found common roots between one of his components and the more southern Candelaria culture. West of Salta, the Museo de la Plata Anthropologi- cal Division continued work, directed by Eduardo M. Cigliano, in the Valle de Lerma, Quebrada del Toro, Quebrada de Las Capillas, and Pascha-Incahuasi, cover- ing all phases of the Ceramic period (mainly the Early, about 550 B.C.-A.D. 650), and his architectual round house system. Fieldwork in the Late Preincaic ruins of Osma at the southern end of the Valle de Lerma was carried on by a team from the Universidad Nacional de Salta directed by Osvaldo Maidana. Lithic workshops and ruins of several phases of the Ceramic period were also found. Pio P. Diaz and collaborators (Museo Arqueologico de Cachi) are currently prospecting the rich archae- ological region of the Valles Calchaquies and con- tinuing excavations in the late ruin complex of Las Pailas. The "Club de Amigos de la Montania" of Salta, directed by Roberto Vitry, discovered some archae- ological sites in the west of this province. On the slopes of Cerro Saladillo at 5,000 m Precolumbian ruins were found. Near the summit of Cerro Qu6huar (6,180 m) well-preserved remnants of pirca buildings were observed, with ceramic and textile fragments apparently belonging to a tomb. In the central Valle Calchaquil region, at 3,000 m on a high plateau, a fortified town was located: the "Fuerte de Mayuco," which includes petroglyphs and rocks with mortars or cup-marks. In the interior of a dwelling a re- markably well-polished "toki" or axe of stone was found. In December of this year the same group explored the ruins of "Inca Viejo," at 4,400 m in the Puna region. This mining and ceremonial complex consists of the ruins of a village, connected by a stone-flanked road with old galleries excavated in the flanks of a mountain and a cave with rock-paintings. Members of the Club Andino Mercedario of San Juan continued exploring the Cordilleran region. The most important report concerns the Volcan Socompa (6,030 m, bordering Chile in the Puna region); at 5,000 m they found a pirca structure with wood in its interior and traces of a high road; at 5,400 m, a bundle of wood, and at 5,700 m, in the interior of the crater, a group of dwellings with broad walls and remains of the timber which originally supported the roof. At some 40 m below the surface they found charcoal belonging to ancient hearths. In Tucumin, Eduardo Berberian, aided by Horacio Calandra, completed fieldwork in the region of Dique El Cadillal, and installed a local museum. A late phase of the Candelaria culture was radiocarbon dated at A.D. 1050?100, by means of material contained in the interior of a funerary urn, which also included metal. At the end of 1974 they began research work in the region of Tafi del Valle, seeking more knowledge about the early Tafi culture. With the same purpose, an interdisciplinary staff of the Universidad de Tucuman worked in La Ci6nega (same region); the archaeological portion is directed by Ana N6lida Baraza and Maria T. Bernasconi de Garcia. In the province of Catamarca, Osvaldo Heredia and his coworkers (Universidad Nacional de C6rdoba) excavated in the important archaeological region of departamento Ambato. In 1973 they analyzed middens (basurales) and complex dwelling structures belonging to the Condorhuasi and La Ci6naga I phases (El Altillo site), and to a rich new variety of La Aguada culture, with funerary urns (Martinez site). Some of the ruins have platforms and mounds which suggest ceremonial buildings. Alberto Rex Gonziles (Museo de La Plata) con- tinued fieldwork in the more western valleys of Hualfin and Laguna Blanca. New sites of the oldest phases of the Condorhuasi ("Diablo") and La Ci6naga ("La Manga") cultures were located. Recent radio- carbon datings for both yielded ages: for Diablo, between 540 B.C. and A.D. 97; and for La Manga, between 280 B.C. and A.D. 460. The Instituto de Antropologia of the new Univer- sidad de La Rioja has done archaeological work in several parts of this province. Rupestrian art has been studied, belonging to local ceramic groups: Joliin (paintings), Corte de Casangate (deep engravings), and Villa Casana (paintings), by Julian Caceres Freyre, and Palancho (a complex petroglyph group), discovered by an amateur, Martin Juairez. Region of Cuyo (San Juan and Mendoza). Mariano Gambier (Museo Arqueologico, Universidad Nacional de San Juan) continued intensive fieldwork in western parts of this province. While finishing the study of early farming systems in the Valle de Iglesia (about 300 B.C.-A.D. 400), he excavated some pit houses in Bauchaceta, belonging to the Middle period of that</page><page sequence="22">234 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 41, No. 2, 19761 regioin. Other pit houses were found and excavated in Punta de Agua de Los Morrillos (S.W. of Calingasta), belonging in this case to early agriculturalists, whose traces were also tound in the cave "Encrucijada de Aguas" on the arroyo Salado de Ansilta, and in some rockshelters on the arroyo Fiero de Ansilta. New excavations were carried on in the Los Morrillos caves (late hunters and early farmers), discovering new burials and art. Test pits were made in rock shelters on the Rio Volcdn, in the extreme southlwest of the province of San Juanl. In northern Mendoza, the Instituto de Arqueologia y Etnologia (Universidad Nacional de Cuyo) con- tinued surveying and mapping sites in the Valle de Uspallata: J. Roberto BWrcena explored thle regioin of Yalguaraz, with Preceramic and Incaic remains. Pablo Sacclhero worked in the valleys of Tupungato and Potrerillos. Humberto A. Lagiglia (Museo de Historia Natural de San Rafael) continued working in the Rinc6n del Atuel, and discovered a peculiar large tlake industry in the "Planchada del Atuel." He collaborated with North American researchers whlo visited the region in 1974. Survey trips were made to EIl Nihuil, Alto Rio Tunuydin, Paso de las Carretas, and Volcin Overo in the cordilleran region, where a late Precolumbiail village formed by round stone houses had beeil found by Andinists. A burial site with extended skeletons probably belonging to very late hunters was excavated near the Cerro Diainante. End of 1974 M. Gambier begun the excavation of a cave situated on the upper Rio Diamante (Gruta del Carrizalito). Central region (province of C6rdoba). Alberto J. Marcellino (Universidad Nacional de C6rdoba) worked in the large Preceramic site of Chlufia, discovered in 1972. This site and its burials date to Mid-Holoceile time. A team of the Museo Etnografico (Universidad Nacional de Buenos Aires) headed by Luis Abel Orquera, Arturo Sala, aild Ciro R. Laf6n carried out excavations in Saucerfa, on a terrace of the Qudlinzo river. A complex Preceramic sequence was determined, in which several phlases of thle bifacial "Pasotranl- quense" industry alterilates with the "Ayamphiti- nense" with its characteristic lanceolate projectile points, during several millennia between Middle and Late Holocene. Two buried skeletons were associated with typical Pasotranquense material. Litoral (Eastern Argentina). Amflcar Rodriguez explored and recollected coarse Preceramic material on terraces of the Uruguay river. To sites in the vicinity of Concordia already known, Tres Cerros, in the province of Corrientes, an industry characterized by broad flakes, was added. Marfa Amanda Caggiano (Museo de La Plata) began a systematic study of the archaeology of the lower Plata basin, examining the material deposited in museums and visiting some of its sites. In Punta Negra (Necochea, southl of Buenos Aires province) she studied a rough pebble industry, belonging to a variant of the "Puntarrubiense." The lower Uruguay river area (surroundings of Gualeguaychu) was studied by Antonia Rizzo, aided by the Uruguayans Jorge Baeza and Rene Boretto. Different types ot dwelling sites were identified: on sand bainks (without stratigraphy); on "cerritos" (low mounds, similar to those in E'astern Uruguay and Southern Brazil); and superficial withl Guaraini mate- rial. Inner Pampa and Patagonia. Carlos J. Gradin (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y TVchnicas) surveyed sites in the central and western part of La Pampa province, and studied rock-paintings in this region. Rather simple geometric motifs relate the latter with recent styles of northern Patagonia. In Mallin del Tromeil (estailcia Yamuco, western Neuquen) Marta Pastore (Instituto de Antropologia, UJniversidad Nacional de Buenos Aires) located some workshops with basaltic material related to the Neuquense II (with pebble-tools, flakes, and rough bifaces). Other sites, including some rock shelters, belong to late hunters. The excavation of one of them, No. IV, yielded two stratigraphlic units, both dated with radiocarbon. The lower has triangular poilnts, side scrapers, grindiilg stones, and bone in- dustry (A.D. 135? 145); the upper has small triailgular points, eild scrapers, a few incised ceramic fragmeilts, and a metal pendant (A.D. 1060?120 for the begin- ning of this phase). Rita Ceballos (Universidad Nacional de Rosario) anld Adamn Hayduk (Universidad del Comahue) con- tinued fieldwork in western RIo Negro. They carried on excavations in a cave on the Rio Pichileufu (Campo Mufioz), with stratified material ranging from the early Postglacial to modernl times. Another cave in the same region is currently being excavated under the direction of Gloria Arrigoni (Centro de Investigaciolnes Cienltificas de Rio Negro); the site is located near Comallo (Campo Frfas). Eixcavated material belonlgs to the recent hunters who were the authors of the abunidant and complex paintings whichl adornl the walls of this cave. Carlos J. Gradin continlued his estival expeditionis to Patagonlia. Old lithlic workshlops anld rock paintings vere located in cenltral-western Rfo Negro. In western Chubut he recorded the great rupestrian site of Cerro Shequenl, withl simple and complex geometric paint- ings executed on a long basaltic wall facilng the Cerro Apeleg, a peak whliclh hiad a sacred character for the recen t Tehuelche. Some associated sites with Patagonlianl and Araucanian material were examined. In northlwestern Sanlta Cruz he carried out a second season of excavations in the "Cueva de las Manos" of the Rio Pinturas (whose important paintings, mostly negative hanlds and men/animal scenes he had already recorded). The lowest level contained triangular points of "Toldense" traditionl; its radiocarbon date of about 5300 B.C. (7280?60 B.P.) serves to date the paintings, tor a block corresponding to this level, fallenl from the cave wall some time before 1400 B.C., had negative hanlds painlted on it. Gradin visited also the region of Rio Turbio (southwestern Santa Cruz), where he explored sites belonging to the forerunlnlers of the "Canoeros" Indians. Amialia Sanguinietti de B6rmida and coworkers ot the Instituto de Antropologia (Univ. Buenos Aires) carried on extenlsive work in southern Santa Cruz in 1974. Terraces of the Rio Gallegos and its effluent the Rio Chico were explored and "epiprotolithic" mate- rial studied. Several sites with simple geometric paint-</page><page sequence="23">CURRENT RESEARCH 235 ings were recorded. Test pits were done in shelters formed in the interior of old craters existing between the Rfo Gallegos and the Magellan Strait (the industry is of type Rfogalleguense Ill), and in some caves formed in the basalt bordering the upper Rfo Chico, in the estancia Palli-Aike (coarse basaltic instruments and an Archaic spear point, a variant of the "fish-tail" points already known from this region were found). The first season of an important excavation was carried on in the cave Las Buitreras I, located on the 25 m terrace of the Rfo Gallegos. In upper levels the material responds to Rfogalleguense tradition, more or less influenced or mixed with ancient Patagonian hunter tradition with triangular points of Fell III type; the bone industry is abundant. The lowest level at 2.70 m yielded remains of the extinct ground sloth, Mylodon darwini apparently associated with some flakes. New excavations and radiocarbon datings should aid to solve the problem of this "Argentine Mylodon Cave." URUGUAY. Results of recent fieldwork were preseilted at the III Congreso Nacional de Arqueologfa (Montevideo, November 1974), organized by the Centro de F'studios Arqueologicos directed by Antonio Taddei: Emilio Pelaez recorded pictographs located on the Sierra de Mahoma, near Malabrigo (departamento San Jos6i); they are of the geometric-hlistomorph style also present in Cerro Pan de Azucar, Maestre de Campo, and other sites in southern and central Uruguay. The Colonia Concordia site in dep. Soriano (south- western Uruguay) was studied by a team from the Centro de Estudios Arqucol6gicos. Ceramics are related to the "riberenos Plasticos" (a Preguaranf group of easternl Argentina); lithics are poor, but the bone industry is developed. A skeleton was assigned to the tall and dolichoid "Pampid" race. In the same region, Rene Boretto (Museo Municipal de Historia Natural de Rfo Negro, Fray Bentos) excavated a site on the cliffs of the Rio Negro, identifying a new phase of Guaranf ceramics, in addition to the two already determined in 1970. Besides the corrugated and undulated types, one type has red bands on the borders of vessels. It seems to correspond to the contact period of Guarani invaders and local populations. In the departamento Cerro Largo, the local work- ing group of the Centro de Estudios Arqueol6gicos studied the "cerritos" of the Bafiado de Acegua, near the Brazilian border. In the same region, Jorge Baeza excavated a site with lithic material at the base (including small stemmed "fish-tail" points, locally called "La Paloma-type"), and ceramics of Brazilian Vieira type, without points, on the top. A similar sequence was found by the same individual on the Rio Santa Lucia, near Montevideo. G. Lafourcade and J. Ambrosini explored a lithic workshop near the confluence of the Arapey and Uruguay rivers; it includes projectile points, bifacial side scrapers, and a few bola stones. Adhemar Bosch and a group from the Centro de Estudios Arqueol6gicos did extensive survey and excavation work in the 15 km long area of Cabo Polonio, facing the Atlanltic Ocean. Most of the material from the 36 superficial sites identified is related to "cerritos" and south Brazilian Sambaquf culture, including grinding stones and manos (some of them with holes), Guarani ceramics, etc. Lithic mate- rial suggests an older occupation of some of these sites by hunters, for it includes scrapers, perforators, and some "fish-tail" points. (The occurrence of this important type of projectile point in Uruguay, with and without fluting, has been analyzed by A. Bosch and Jorge Femenias, who have listed 32 pieces already existing in collections.) JUAN SCHOBINGER</page></plain_text>
