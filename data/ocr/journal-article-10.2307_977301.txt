Whetten, eds., Readings in Organizational Decline (Cambridge, MA: Ballinger Publishing Company, 1988), 352 pp.; $39.95 hardcover, $22.95 paper. Mary E. Guy, Organizational Decline to Organizational Renewal (New York: Quorum Books, 1989); $39.95. The organization decline literature seems robust after its tenth birthday, as its proponents reckon time. Many see the 1977 publication by Hannan and Freeman' as the aca- demic birth certificate of decline research. Cameron and his colleagues observe (p. 5) that three-quarters or more of the available literature has been produced in the last decade. The two focal books variously derive from decline as a central theme and provide sustenance to it. Conveniently, the book edited by Cameron, Sutton, and Whetten pro- vides a useful and broad-ranging set of readings that high- light the emerging field of decline. Complementarily, Guy utilizes one metaphor-the phoenix-in a development- in-depth within this tradition of inquiry. In a global sense, the literature on decline provides yet another reminder that one can have too much of even very good things. That is, the several organization litera- tures-Organization Behavior, Organization Develop- ment, and Organization Theory, to rely on convenient labels for the three dominant approaches-have more or less explicit biases toward growth, toward how to do bet- ter while getting bigger. This tendency influences both theory and practice, and it leaves significant deficiencies in each when it comes to coping with the central organiza- tional phenomena of the past decade-growing scarcity, downsizing, and doing better, or at least not much worse, with less. The two focal books here highlight this major blind spot in the organization literatures. Hence both books are welcome. However, the two books also try to make too much of their good things. Although each book provides a needed correction for a growth myopia, the two books try to do too much with decline or do it in unconvincing or under- whelming ways. The Comprehensive Survey Consider the good news about the Readings and then the less attractive. Note that, beyond this point, page refer- ences in parentheses direct readers to specific parts at issue in one of the books or the other. Especially Attractive Features Five major strengths argue that the volume does a well- rounded job of highlighting major trends. Twenty-two reprinted articles do the heavy work, which is organized as conceptual, empirical, and normative. A useful introduc- tion provides solid tethering for the user, and, of special value, three serious commentaries conclude the volume and guide sense-making about the characters and qualities of the 22 reprinted pieces. In addition, the Readings book highlights competing theoretical viewpoints for understanding the life cycles of organizations. Three theories can be distinguished, but each covers substantial or even vast conceptual territory. Briefly: * Population ecology theories propose that most vari- ability comes through the creation of new organiza- tions and forms that replace prior ones, largely due to exogenous conditions. Variants range widely. Some see chance as dominant, as does Herbert Kaufman. Others propose a kind of Darwinian evo- lution, largely in response to exogenous factors in the environment, but allowing variable scope for human wit and will in a competitive struggle. * Rational adaptation theories emphasize designed changes in the strategies and structures of organizations in response to emerging conditions, threats, or new opportunities. * Random transformation theories highlight organi- zational responses to internal processes, but those which are only gently associated with environmen- tal forces or elite desires. The common targets of such theories deserve respect. Thus a greater sense of life cycles can facilitate less trau;- matic organizational transitions. Ideally, today's transitions can be made with tomorrow's probabilities in mind. This implies greater leverage, as in avoiding short-run problem solving which encourages greater problems down the line. In addition, different stages seem to require different strategies, interventions, and criteria of effectiveness. Moreover, the Readings book gives attention to both process as well as variance models. The former seeks to explain outcomes in terms of sets of events, as in the sim- ple and simplified case of distinguishing an organization's life cycle as birth, youth, maturity, and death. Variance models seek more specific explanations of outcomes as dependent on some independent variable, often as condi- tioned by moderator or intervening variables. For exam- ple, one of the reprinted selections (pp. 95-116) uses the threat/rigidity hypothesis to explain maladaptive responses in organizations under conditions of ambiguity or turbu- lence. Further, the Readings book at several points (e.g., pp. 24-25, 117-128, 158-160, and 129-149) differentiates JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1990</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 109 types of decline and also associates them with families of adaptive or maladaptive managerial strategies. This reflects a thrust toward linking informed practices with research and theory, of course. Finally, and a definite plus, the Readings recognizes public-sector perspectives and contributors. Thus Kauf- man, Levine, March, and others are cited with regularity. Indeed, so significant are public administration scholars, as well as public-sector policies and practices, that the lit- erature on decline could neglect them only at great cost. Less Attractive Features Several features of the book exacerbate its inherent lim- itations as a reader. Paramount for this reviewer, Read- ings and most selections try too hard to be new and unique. This distances the decline literature from poten- tially valuable resources, and at times it ill fits the historic record. * The reasonable desire to establish decline in the face of a real-enough bias toward growth encour- ages the neglect of relevant topics that have received substantial attention elsewhere and over long periods. Consider that demotion, which occurs in practice more than most people acknowledge, has broader potential uses, and it has been around in the literature for decades. Demotion gets not a single mention in Readings, as far as I can tell. My associates and I published an article of action- research a long while back,2 and the design has been replicated and reported on several times since.3 Thus, I feel some of the neglect. More curiously, demotion has been a long-standing theme in sociology,4 and the decline literature features the sociological--in the major figures contributing to the literature, the sources publishing leading pieces, and so on. * The Readings and the decline literature have a macro-organizational focus, in the main, although exceptions exist in both the Readings (e.g., pp. 241- 263) and in the literature. The costs include a gen- eral neglect, inter alia, of small group and individu- al properties, which impovershes any theoretical development. One of the commentaries in the Readings (p. 417), in fact, emphasizes the signifi- cance of this limitation. * Relatedly, the decline literature also distances itself from useful technology for change. A thrust toward application appears in the decline literature but mostly in the form of general prescriptions that dis- courage useful linkages. For example, organization development (OD) specialists have devoted grow- ing attention to action research for ameliorating decline and downsizing, with general success.5 However, I recall no mention of OD in the Read- ings. Consider only one other less-attractive feature of the Readings. The balance there definitely favors process JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1990 models of explanation and understanding. They can be very valuable, and the Readings book contains several examples of the genre at its best (e.g., pp. 381-396). How- ever, process models also encourage excessive reliance on verbalisms--often anthropomorphic and metaphorical, as in the common focus on organizational "birth" and "death." Several selections in the Readings illustrate this general overreachingness (e.g., pp. 323-332, 348-350), with one illustratively advising planners in a cutback mode to (pp. 348- 350): * decide what to cut, * maintain morale, * attract and keep top quality people, * develop the support of key constituencies, * create opportunities for innovation, * avoid mistakes. This advice is well intentioned, but helpful only in the most general sense. The Extended Metaphor In effect, Mary E. Guy complements the breadth of the Readings via the development-in-depth of a single metaphor-that of the phoenix. This mythological bird, the reader may remember, is capable of living for five cen- turies or more and, after being consumed by a fire of its own making, rises from the ashes for another long stint, rejuvenated. Guy observes that organizations often are renewed, and this she labels the Phoenix Syndrome (p. xiii). To me, Guy's book exemplifies the full range of the characteristics associated with process models. At their best, they can power what Guy calls "frame-breaking" advances that she rightly distinguishes from "converging" or incremental progress. At their worst, process models succumb to seeking an unruly denotational fullness of their underlying ideas or metaphors. The art form involves letting the metaphor captivate without capturing one. Let me provide three specifics about Organizational Decline to Organizational Renewal. First, Guy could mod- erate the metaphors. Consider one fair example of much of the text. Guy notes that the key period in the decline/renewal cycle is just after "heart death" but just before "brain death," while things are bad but before the organization is "reduced to ashes" (pp. 5-6). Subsequently, the focus turns to organizational "resurrection," which (p. 80) "is the notion of evolution downward met by a revolu- tion upward." Also troublesome is Guy's early listing (p. xiv) of the Phoenix Syndrome along with the Peter Princi- ple, Parkinson's Law, Murphy's Law, and Janis' group- think. Three of those four have their tongues firmly plant- ed in their conceptual cheeks, and they intend more humor than explanation. Second, Guy illustrates her argument with numerous cases in point-mostly micro, if you will, but she includes detailed attention to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Implementation of this useful idea is troubled.</page><page sequence="3">110 PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW * 50th YEAR As for the micro cases, overkill and undertargeting often exist. Short cases dot the early pages, even dominate them. I counted 53 micro cases on 115 pages, in fact. On sufficient ocassions to be troubling, I remain unclear as to what case supports which point (e.g. Bartles and Jaymes, p. 64). Guy does not close the loop in tying her reasonable NASA narrative to the Phoenix Syndrome. The Chal- lenger tragedy admits several interpretations, most nestled comfortably in quite-ordinary conceptual networks. To illustrate, singly or in combination, one can interpret the NASA case as reflecting: * a tragic, but honest, difference of opinion between technical and managerial personnel as to likely occurrences at such and such temperatures, based on different interpretations of more or less the same data base; * an agreement between engineers and managers about possible occurrences, but with the latter opt- ing to launch because of considerations related to public relations or the convenience of White House officials; * the explicit or implicit unwillingness of technical people to persist in aggressively seeking to stop the launch after being informed the decision was not technical but "managerial"; * the explicit or implicit unwillingness of the Chal- lenger flight crew to refuse to fly, which is an option that I presume was available to them; * a "conflict of agreement" in which all or most actors agreed as to the danger of the launch, but in which none pressed the point for fear of being the sole dissenter and, hence, as futilely risking mem- bership; * a risky-shift phenomenon in which segmented responsibility encourages greater risk-taking than many actors would accept personally; * a complex "communication problem," compounded by time urgencies and perhaps by the physical and emotional fatigue of many actors; * the hubris of past successes; * the tragic culmination of an extended series of cut- backs in NASA staff, exacerbated by an erosion of standards due to hubris or budget cuts; * extraordinarily bad fortune, as numerous factors-- unaccountably and even uniquely-all fell out in a single direction. None of these interpretations is unique to the Phoenix Syndrome. Although one could propose a degree of fit for all of them, this provides no guidance for making choices between alternative interpretations. Third, Guy provides most help when she deals with how to load the odds in favor of the Phoenix Syndrome. She details how positive organizational things will result from these "forces for renewal": clear goals, leadership, open channels of communication, can-do cultural norms, up-to-date technology, adaptability, and appropriate reor- ganization or merger. Guy also describes four steps of organizational "resurrection," and she discusses the char- acteristics of the "plateaus" connecting them. These "forces" seem reasonable enough, in general, but why not a shortcut? If management initially acted in accord with them, there would be far less decline, obviat- ing the need for finding that crucial interval just after "heart death" but before "brain death." Robert T.
