      <p>“Never Bet the Devil Your Head: A Tale with a Moral” has never been among Poe's more popular works of fiction. It may strike casual readers as superficial and straightforward, an unsophisticated satire of the type of moralizing tale Poe was regularly admonished for not writing, but there is more here than is at first evident. In fact, the tale has attracted the attention of various critics and has elicited a wide range of responses. In <italic>Edgar Allan Poe: A Critical Biography</italic>, Arthur Hobson Quinn uncritically dismisses the tale as “a trifle.”<sup>1</sup> Likewise, Eliot Glassheim, in “A Dogged Interpretation of ‘Never Bet the Devil Your Head,’” initially concedes, “Taken at face value, the point of the tale is somewhat weak.”<sup>2</sup> However, in his introduction to <italic>Great Short Works of Edgar Allan Poe</italic>, G. R. Thompson more generously sums up the tale as “a satiric slap at the high moralizing of the Transcendentalists and at their journal, the <italic>Dial.</italic>”<sup>3</sup> Even more complimentary of the tale's satirical aim, Daniel Royot, in an essay in <italic>The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe</italic>, remarks on the superlative nature of the work's satire: “Probably the most biting castigation of Transcendentalist misconception and idealization of the dogged facts of life is ‘Never Bet the Devil Your Head,’ a riddle progressively leaking its secrets.”<sup>4</sup> Indeed, Poe's sardonic intention makes itself felt from the citation of Don Thomas De Las Torres in the opening lines to the narrator's concluding assertion that the “transcendentalists” refused to pay for the protagonist's funeral, forcing the narrator to dig up the protagonist and sell him for “dog's meat” in order to make expenses.<sup>5</sup> As Thomas Mabbott puts it:
<disp-quote>
            <p>This comic story conforms very well to the author's peculiar ideas of what constituted humor. Relatively few readers share his belief that any impossible combination of events is laughable; and the tale is never, or hardly ever, anthologized. Nevertheless there are amusing hits at those commentators who give a profound meaning to mere extravagancies of imagination.<sup>6</sup>

         </disp-quote>
George Porcari puts it even more succinctly, commenting on the tale itself in a review of Federico Fellini's modernized film adaptation <italic>Toby Dammit</italic>: “Poe's work is a brief comic satire of the transcendentalist movements that were then popular in Europe and America.”<sup>7</sup> Of these brief assessments, the most insightful is Royot's description of the tale as “a riddle progressively leaking its secrets,” for Poe's protagonist, Toby Dammit, may not even <italic>be</italic> a Transcendentalist, per se, but a young boy's canine companion, undermining Transcendentalists' moral sense through his doggery, which presumably omits the Transcendentalist emphasis on “individual conscience.”<sup>8</sup> Indeed, cursory assessments fail to appreciate the essential cleverness of the tale's multipronged rhetorical strike against “the high moralizing of the Transcendentalists.” In other words, just as the tale's plot is farcically extreme, so is the language that is the vehicle for that plot. What is more, the tale's immoderate rhetoric brings to light an underlying and quirkily ironic “moral,” which is the subversion of “moralizing” through an emphasis on rhetoric itself. In fact, one of the tale's first rhetorical gestures depends on the word “moral.” Consider the narrator's interpretation of the opening Spanish quote from Don Thomas De Las Torres: “Provided the morals of an author are pure, personally, it signifies nothing what are the morals of his books.”<sup>9</sup> In this translation of Las Torres, the narrator uses the word “morals” twice, but in two different senses. According to the <italic>Oxford English Dictionary</italic>, the definition that corresponds to the first use of the word involves “a person's lifestyle or self conduct (esp. in sexual matters) considered with regard to morality.”<sup>10</sup> The second use, when converted to the singular “moral,” suggests a “moral maxim or practical lesson to be drawn from a story, event, etc.”<sup>11</sup> In this instance, Poe has employed the figure antanaclasis, the “repetition of a word in two different senses.”<sup>12</sup> In claiming through its subtitle that “Never Bet the Devil Your Head” is “A Tale with a Moral,” Poe superficially suggests that the tale will conform to the second of the two <italic>OED</italic> definitions. However, he subtly reveals his subversive rhetorical scheme in the opening paragraph by using the word “moral” in two different senses, a harbinger of his “amusing hits at those commentators who give a profound meaning to mere extravagancies of imagination.” Building on his sense of “morals,” Poe proceeds to <italic>unleash</italic> a tale of uncertain identity, rhetorical flourish, and double meaning.</p>

         <title>What Is Toby Dammit?</title>
         <p>In his introduction to <italic>Great Short Works</italic>, Thompson refers to “Never Bet the Devil Your Head” as “an <italic>animal</italic> fable in the manner of Aesop and La Fontaine: the comic burlesque of the ‘dissolute’ life of the ‘immoral’ but transcendentally gifted Dammit which culminates in such ‘tragedy’ for him becomes even more comically pointed when we see that it is merely the story of a boy and his dog.”<sup>13</sup> The tale does offer some evidence for this reading. Early in the text, for instance, the narrator says of the protagonist, Toby Dammit, “He was a sad dog, it is true, and a dog's death it was that he died.”<sup>14</sup> Simply, if one takes the canine references in this sentence literally, then Toby Dammit is a dog. Moreover, the interpretation of the narrator as a child gains some purchase when the narrator responds to a purported inquiry from Dammit about whether the narrator's “maternal parent” is aware that he is out of the house.<sup>15</sup> According to the narrator, his mother certainly is cognizant of his absence: “My mamma <italic>was</italic> very well aware of my merely temporary absence from home.”<sup>16</sup> The narrator's whingeing use of the diminutive “mamma” in this instance certainly suggests his adolescence. Further, near the end of the tale, Dammit proposes his titular wager, betting the archfiend his head that he can leap a stile at one end of a covered bridge.<sup>17</sup> When a character who is apparently the devil appears and takes up Dammit's challenge, the narrator responds with an adolescent epithet: “‘What right,’ said I, ‘had the old gentleman to make any other gentleman jump? The little old dot-and-carry-one! who is <italic>he</italic>?’”<sup>18</sup> The phrase “dot-and-carry-one” is a “schoolboy's expression in some processes of elementary arithmetic (subtraction, division, and addition).”<sup>19</sup> The narrator's use of this expression clearly bolsters Thompson's interpretation of the narrator as a child. However, ultimately prefiguring the true nature of the tale's “moral,” Poe makes certain that virtually nothing is straightforward in “Never Bet the Devil Your Head”: the tale, in its use of language, simply resists any definitive interpretation as expedient as Thompson's. The narrator's characterization of Dammit as a “sad dog” who dies “a dog's death,” for example, does not easily lend itself to a literal interpretation. According to the <italic>OED</italic>, “dog” can simply mean “a worthless or contemptible person; a wretch, a cur.”<sup>20</sup> What is more, the phrase “sad dog,” which the <italic>OED</italic> parenthetically notes is used “in playful reproof, congratulation, or commiseration,” can simply refer to “a fellow, a chap.”<sup>21</sup> The phrase “a dog's death” simply means “to die a disgraceful or miserable death.”<sup>22</sup> In short, one can plainly dispense with a literal reading of the narrator's canine references if one so chooses. As Glassheim argues, “Though I think there is sufficient evidence to establish Toby as a dog, the point of the story does not require that the case be conclusive.”<sup>23</sup> He adds, “Depending on which mentality the reader favors, Toby can be seen as a transcendentalist, a simple dog, or an immoral person.”<sup>24</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Indeed, from one perspective, Dammit's physical attributes are distinctly anthropomorphic. Claiming to have upbraided the incorrigible Dammit for his oath-making, for instance, the narrator explains that Dammit was initially silent:
<disp-quote>
               <p>But presently he threw his head to one side, and elevated his eyebrows to great extent. Then he spread out the <italic>palms</italic> of his hands and shrugged up his shoulders. Then he winked with the right eye. Then he repeated the operation with the left. Then he shut them both up very tight. Then he opened them both so very wide that I became seriously alarmed for the consequences. Then, applying his <italic>thumb</italic> to his nose, he thought proper to make an indescribable movement with the rest of his <italic>fingers</italic>. Finally, setting his <italic>arms</italic> akimbo, he condescended to reply.<sup>25</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>
In this passage, the words “palms,” “thumb,” “fingers,” and “arms” are quite possibly derivations of the narrator's fancy, anthropomorphisms applied to the narrator's canine companion, who, as Thompson points out, “wears moustaches” from a young age and “is constantly wiggling, leaping, running.”<sup>26</sup> If Dammit is a dog, then he is a very cartoonish dog indeed. However, the narrator's description also suggests that his companion is not canine, but <italic>human</italic>. Critic Ecaterina Hanţiu, for instance, does not hesitate to identify Dammit as a human being: “Toby Dammit is a foolish young man who would bet on anything.”<sup>27</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Intriguingly, this confusion about Dammit's species has some basis in two of Poe's earlier works, specifically “The Bargain Lost” and “Bon-Bon.” Both tales (the latter is a rewrite of the former) contain archetypes subsequently found in “Never Bet the Devil Your Head,” including the crucial plot element of a bargain or wager with the devil. Each tale also features a “water-dog” who is the companion of the protagonist.<sup>28</sup> As Glassheim surmises, this canine most likely serves as a model for Toby Dammit: “Merely as a conjecture I would guess that Toby Dammit is the same ‘water-dog’ who appears at his master's feet in ‘Bon-Bon,’ another Poe story in which the devil arrives to claim a soul.”<sup>29</sup> Moreover, both tales' protagonists are oath-making metaphysicians, and the latter tale's protagonist, Pierre Bon-Bon, has the stated character flaw of liking to haggle: “He could never let slip an opportunity of making a bargain.”<sup>30</sup> Finally, both protagonists are cartoonish figures. Pedro Garcia, the main character of “The Bargain Lost,” is, for instance, rather squat: “In all mental qualifications our hero was gigantic. Moreover, in bodily circumference, he had no cause of complaint; but, in right ascension, four feet five was the philosopher's ne plus ultra.”<sup>31</sup> In “Bon-Bon,” Poe rewrites Garcia as a truly farcical personage: “If, however, Bon-Bon was barely three feet in height, and if his head was diminutively small, still it was impossible to behold the rotundity of his stomach without a sense of magnificence nearly bordering upon the sublime.”<sup>32</sup> Thus, “Never Bet the Devil Your Head” derives more than its basic plot from the earlier works, for Poe has also swapped various characters' traits: Toby Dammit is likely the “water-dog,” as Glassheim notes, and he has inherited a penchant for oath-making from the two metaphysicians, Garcia and Bon-Bon. Additionally, Bon-Bon's weakness for bargaining has become Dammit's weakness for wagering, and the cartoonish qualities of Garcia and Bon-Bon are now the cartoonish qualities of Dammit. As an additional point, the narrator of “Never Bet the Devil Your Head” is in effect a recasting of the Garcia–Bon-Bon metaphysician as a Transcendental moralist who is worried about the fate of Dammit's soul: “Mr. Dammit's soul was in a perilous state. I resolved to bring all my eloquence into play tosave it.”<sup>33</sup> In short, the archetypes of “The Bargain Lost” and “Bon-Bon,” considered in conjunction with the narrator's occasional anthropomorphic word choices in “Never Bet the Devil Your Head,” suggest both canine <italic>and</italic> human qualities for Toby Dammit.</p>
         <p>Poe's goal in regard to the uncertainty surrounding Toby Dammit's identityis to destabilize the ostensible moral of “Never Bet the Devil Your Head.” How can “Never Bet the Devil Your Head” be “A Tale with a Moral” when one cannot with any certainty establish the species of the character who is to provide the moral lesson? For if Toby Dammit is literally a dog, he would, on the face of it, not even be capable of the human intuition associated with Transcendentalist moral judgment (save for that imposed on him fictionally as the narrator's construct, in which case the intuition would be the narrator's and not Dammit's).<sup>34</sup> Thus, the cathartic potential of the tale's titular moral, “Never Bet the Devil Your Head,” sensibly diminishes because the protagonist, if canine, would not be capable of making such a “bet” or of appreciating the moral error involved in doing so.</p>
         <p>Tellingly, the meaning of the name “Toby Dammit” is no less uncertain than the character's species. Porcari, for instance, points out that “Toby” was “an English slang term for ass in Poe's time,” an interpretation that the <italic>OED</italic> bears out.<sup>35</sup> Michael Begnal, another reviewer of Fellini's <italic>Toby Dammit</italic>, argues that the “name Dammit is Poe's excuse to curse in public and get away with it.”<sup>36</sup> What is more, as critic John Gruesser and others have noted, Poe's characters can have names of homophonic significance, as Gruesser suggests in the case of Poe's archetypal detective C. Auguste Dupin and the word “duping.”<sup>37</sup> In light of the fact that Dammit loses a bet with the devil, his damnation is all but certain, Poe having foreshadowed it in his admonitory title. Thus, Benjamin Fisher, editor of <italic>The Essential Tales and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe</italic>, has noted that the character's name is close to a revealing counterpart: the phrase “to be damned.”<sup>38</sup> (Can dogs be damned?) In short, the uncertain significance of Toby Dammit's rather unusual name complements the uncertainty of his species and further destabilizes the text, undermining consideration of the tale's supposed “moral” through the allure of distractingly farcical textual minutiae.</p>

         <title>Schemes</title>
         <p>Thompson and Glassheim not only suggest that Toby Dammit is a literal dog, but Thompson also suggests that the narrator is “a boy.” As noted, the narrator's use of expressions such as “mamma” and “dot-and-carry-one” supports this interpretation. However, the narrator's rhetorical erudition does not. Indeed, the narrator deploys schemes of language with the facility of a schoolmaster rather than a schoolboy, but his childish subject matter paradoxically undercuts his (and the tale's) didacticism. For instance, in the passage cited above wherein the narrator describes Dammit's “palms,” “thumb,” “fingers,” and “arms,” six consecutive sentences begin with the conjunction “then,” a clear use of anaphora, or the “repetition of the same word or group of words at the beginnings of successive clauses.”<sup>39</sup> As Edward P. J. Corbett and Robert J. Connors note in <italic>Style and Statement</italic>, “Whenever anaphora occurs, we can be sure that the author has used it deliberately. Since the repetition of the words helps establish a marked rhythm in the sequence of clauses, this scheme is usually reserved for those passages where the author wants to produce a strong emotional effect.”<sup>40</sup> In this instance, the narrator wants to draw attention to Dammit's incorrigible nature. However, Dammit's ludicrously affected gesticulations undercut any “strong emotional effect”—associated with censure—that the narrator could otherwise achieve via anaphora. In other words, the narrator's rhetorical insistence on Dammit's farcical body language ultimately negates any gravity the reader might be tempted to associate with the narrator's remonstrance in regard to Dammit's oath-making. Rather than suggesting a grave matter calling for moral tuition, the description of Dammit's physical reaction to the narrator's stated indignation starkly contradicts the anaphora's potential for a “strong emotional effect,” conjuring something ridiculous—and childish—instead.</p>
         <p>In his review of Fellini's <italic>Toby Dammit</italic>, Begnal suggests that the tale and the film seek to separate art from moral obligation: “The moral, if there is any, is clearly that there is no conventional moral in these works, and it is not the responsibility of the artists to provide one.”<sup>41</sup> In light of this proposition, consider the following passage from “Never Bet the Devil Your Head,” where the narrator, speaking generally of a writer and his moral, mixes two schemes: “When the proper time arrives, all that the gentleman <italic>intended</italic>, and all that he did not <italic>intend</italic>, will be brought to light, in the ‘Dial,’ or the ‘Down<italic>-</italic>Easter,’ together with all that he ought to have <italic>intended</italic>, and the rest that he clearly meant to <italic>intend</italic>: —so that it will all come very straight <italic>in the end</italic>.”<sup>42</sup> One scheme, epistrophe, involves the “repetition of the same word or group of words at the ends of successive clauses.”<sup>43</sup> The other, polyptoton, involves the “repetition of words derived from the same root.”<sup>44</sup> In a creative adaptation of epistrophe and polyptoton, the narrator repeats variations of the word “intend” at the ends of select clauses and phrases. At the very end of the quote, he even stretches out the word “intend” as he writes “in t[he] end,” implying that some critics will stretch a literary work beyond the artistic boundaries its writer has established in order to “discover” some sort of moral intention. As Royot argues, “The butt of the fable is the Transcendentalist postulation of secret essence before even considering the object concerned.”<sup>45</sup> In a review of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's <italic>A Drama of Exile, and Other Poems</italic>, Poe himself writes, “What is worth thinking is distinctly thought: what is distinctly thought, can and should be distinctly expressed, or should not be expressed at all.”<sup>46</sup> Obviously, Poe “distinctly” expresses the moral of “Never Bet the Devil Your Head” in the tale's title, but the critics of the <italic>Dial</italic> or the imaginary <italic>Down-Easter</italic> would not only gather all that Poe “intended,” that is, the stated “moral,” but “all that he did not intend” or the “secret essence” to which Royot alludes.<sup>47</sup> For Poe, such “secret essence,” owing to its inherent obscurity, “should not be expressed at all.” However, Poe adds that a “justifiable exception” to this requisite clarity “is where the design is to convey the fantastic—not the obscure.”<sup>48</sup> The fantastic, he adds, “may be materially furthered in its development by the <italic>quaint</italic> in phraseology.”<sup>49</sup> Although Poe uses “quaint” here as a noun, the most fitting sense of the word derives from an adjectival definition referring specifically to “quaint” language: “carefully or ingeniously elaborated; highly elegant or refined; clever, smart.”<sup>50</sup> The rhetorical excesses of “Never Bet the Devil Your Head,” in terms of even the few puns and schemes already discussed, clearly qualify as “clever,” if not “ingenious.” In short, in this case, the ludicrously fantastic subject matter of an unidentifiable dog or human gambling his own head in a wager with the devil justifies the “<italic>quaint</italic>” language that is not justified in works that are simply “obscure” rather than “fantastic.” Poe, in other words, actually mocks the Transcendentalist sense of “secret essence” by replacing it in “Never Bet the Devil Your Head” with rhetorical sophistication. He unmistakably states the moral in the title of the tale and then proceeds to subvert any derivation of “secret essence” through an acceptable emphasis on the outrageously fantastic and the commensurably “<italic>quaint</italic> in phraseology.” Ironically, owing to his “<italic>quaint</italic>” language, using which he fails to remonstrate with Dammit successfully, the narrator of the tale, as Glassheim argues, actually “shows himself to be an obtuse, pompous moralizer.”<sup>51</sup> In <italic>American Bloomsbury</italic>, Susan Cheever writes of the Transcendentalists' belief in a “divine spark”: “They thought every man and even some women harbored a divine spark—every man including the poor and the rich, the hermit and the railroad worker and the landowner. They called this divine spark ‘reason.’ Sometimes this was an inner light; sometimes it was the voice of God.”<sup>52</sup> As Pedro Garcia and Pierre Bon-Bon parody the metaphysician, so does the nameless narrator of this tale parody the Transcendental moralist as he tries to ignite a “divine spark” in the conscience of his bizarre companion, who is neither railroad worker nor landowner and may, in fact, be a dog.</p>
         <p>In another example of rhetorical sophistication or “the <italic>quaint</italic> in phraseology,” Poe combines three schemes of language in a grand satirical gesture. Describing his disgust at Dammit's habit of saying “I'll bet you so and so,” the narrator remarks:
<disp-quote>
               <p>The habit was an immoral one, and so I told him. It was a vulgar one—this I begged him to believe. It was discountenanced by society—here I said nothing but the truth. It was forbidden by act of Congress—here I had not the slightest intention of telling a lie. I remonstrated, but to no purpose. I demonstrated—in vain. I entreated—he smiled. I implored—he laughed. I preached—he sneered. I threatened—he swore. I kicked him—he called for the police. I pulled his nose—he blew it, and offered to bet the Devil his head that I would not venture to try that experiment again.<sup>53</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>
At the beginnings of the second, third, and fourth sentences, the narrator repeats the words “It was,” another instance of anaphora. In using anaphora here, the narrator provides the passage with a seemingly grave tone at the outset, a tone thwarted by the next scheme: antithesis. Corbett and Connors define antithesis as the “juxtaposition of contrasting ideas.”<sup>54</sup> Antithesis dominates the later part of the passage in such sentences as “I implored—he laughed. I preached—he sneered.” Dammit's disdain, his seeming lack of “individual conscience,” evident in his laughing and sneering and other reactions, contrasts with the narrator's moralism (his imploring and preaching), itself a rhetorical complement to the seemingly grave tone he adopts when he uses anaphora at first. This back-and-forth movement between gravity and disparagement can only have one result, bathos, which the <italic>OED</italic> defines in terms of rhetoric: “Ludicrous descent from the elevated to the commonplace in writing or speech; anticlimax.”<sup>55</sup> This passage moves from the high-minded statement “The habit was an immoral one, and so I told him,” which receives reinforcement from the solemnity generated by the anaphora that follows it, to the final moment when the narrator's attempt to teach Dammit a moral lesson descends to the following: “I pulled his nose—he blew it, and offered to bet the Devil his head that I would not venture to try that experiment again.” In other words, the passage goes from speaking the truth about an immoral habit to preaching to nose pulling. The anticlimax of the nose pulling points up what is retroactively the mock-serious quality of the passage's beginning and, in microcosm, casts into satiric relief the entire attempt at a “moral” that is this tale's supposed reason for being. In fact, the bathetic rhetorical movement of this passage parallels the rhetorical movement of the entire tale.</p>

         <title>Pigeon-Winging</title>
         <p>In the first paragraph of “Never Bet the Devil Your Head,” the narrator informs the reader of a literary opinion that on its face one could take as sober: “Every fiction <italic>should have</italic> a moral; and what is more to the purpose, the critics have discovered that every fiction <italic>has</italic>.”<sup>56</sup> Of course, Poe spends the remainder of the text pretending, through the vehicle of his comically moralistic narrator and the example of Toby Dammit's comeuppance, to approve of this opinion, ending the tale in grisly fashion as his oath-making protagonist receives his punishment by way of decapitation. However, as is the rule with this tale, the rhetorical details are at odds with the purported gravity of the subject matter.</p>
         <p>During a walk one day, the narrator and Toby Dammit come upon a covered bridge, at the far end of which is a turnstile. As aforementioned, Dammit insists to the narrator that he can leap the stile: “He straightaway offered to <italic>bet the Devil his head</italic> that he could.”<sup>57</sup> The narrator, who had only recently decided to give up his attempts to correct Dammit, continues, “I was about to reply, notwithstanding my previous resolutions, with some remonstrance against his impiety, when I heard, close at my elbow, a slight cough, which sounded very much like the ejaculation ‘<italic>ahem!</italic>’”<sup>58</sup> The “ejaculation” is that of a little old man, who has appeared on the bridge. However, what exactly does the old man say? According to the narrator, the utterance sounds “very much like” the interjection “<italic>ahem</italic>,” his own words revealing his uncertainty about what he has heard. The narrator's construal of the expression, in other words, lacks conviction. Moreover, Dammit has just proposed “to <italic>bet the Devil his head</italic>” that he can jump the stile, “<italic>Devil</italic>” being one of the words on which Poe places emphasis in the passage. In the narrator's statement, the word “<italic>ahem</italic>” also receives emphasis. Is this an emphatic variation on apposition? Could the old man's utterance not conceivably be the ungrammatical, yet colloquial statement “<italic>I'm him</italic>,” that is, the devil? The narrator then tries to get Dammit's attention by repeating variations of the same complaint: “‘Dammit,’ said I, ‘what are you about? don't you hear?—the gentleman says ‘<italic>ahem!</italic>’”<sup>59</sup> Dammit's response to the narrator, when it finally comes, is revealing: “‘You don't say so?’ gasped he at length, after turning more colors than a pirate runs up, one after the other, when chased by a man-of-war. ‘Are you quite sure he said <italic>that</italic>? Well, at all events I am in for it now, and may as well put a bold face upon the matter. Here goes, then—<italic>ahem</italic>!”<sup>60</sup> Dammit's reaction belies the narrator's interpretation of the old man's “ejaculation” as “<italic>ahem</italic>.” Why, for instance, does Dammit “gasp” and say, “I am in for it now”? According to the <italic>OED</italic>, to “gasp” means “To inhale or exhale convulsively with an open mouth, as a result of distress, exertion, surprise, etc.”<sup>61</sup> Why would Dammit react “convulsively” to a simple interjection? Moreover, what does Dammit believe he is “in for”? In fact, after a brief consideration of the exchange's homophonic potential, it is not implausible to wonder whether the narrator misunderstands Dammit's <italic>own</italic> response—“<italic>I'm in</italic>”—for a counter-enunciation of “<italic>ahem</italic>.” Has Dammit recognized the old man's true utterance—“<italic>I'm him</italic>”—and signaled to the archfiend that he is willing to back up the bet? Is this why he believes he is “in for it,” his words finally indicating the action of a “divine spark”? Indeed, Dammit's “gasp” foreshadows his death given the eschatological significance of phrases such as “to gasp one's last.”<sup>62</sup>
         </p>
         <p>In point of fact, the homophonic uncertainty that informs this exchange between the old man, the narrator, and Dammit complements the doubt that informs Dammit's species and name. There are two basic interpretations for this part of the text: either Dammit and the narrator both react with hyperbole to a simple interjection for the sake of the tale's satire, or the narrator really does misunderstand what the old man and Dammit actually say—for the sake of the satire. Either way, the text's minutiae once again undermine its “moral.” In “Never Bet the Devil Your Head,” Poe has replaced “secret essence” with “the <italic>quaint</italic> in phraseology,” which he associates with “the fantastic.” The combination produces a lampoon of those who would seek out “all that he did not intend.” As Brett Zimmerman argues in <italic>Edgar Allan Poe: Rhetoric and Style</italic>, “Poe's command of linguistic humor is precise, deliberate, and masterful—just as he was more generally a precise, deliberate, and masterful literary craftsman.”<sup>63</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Ultimately, “Never Bet the Devil Your Head” is an exercise in <italic>stile</italic>, not substance.<sup>64</sup> The tale's denouement has Toby Dammit committed to doing a “pigeon-wing” over the oft-mentioned turnstile. As the three characters—the narrator, Dammit, and the old man—stand on the bridge before Dammit's attempt, the old man says to Dammit, “Wait here, till I take my place by the stile, so that I may see whether you go over it handsomely, and transcendentally, and don't omit any flourishes of the pigeon-wing. A mere form, you know.”<sup>65</sup> A “pigeon-wing,” according to the <italic>OED</italic>, is a “dance step performed by jumping up and striking the legs together whilst in the air.”<sup>66</sup> In other words, Dammit not only has to leap the <italic>stile</italic>, but he has to do so with <italic>style</italic>, “handsomely” and “transcendentally.” Indeed, Poe brings his satire full circle with Dammit's leap. Having suggested the uncertainty of Dammit's species early in the text, Poe makes a pun out of the climactic leap, calling to mind a noteworthy colloquialism: “to help a dog over a stile.” The <italic>OED</italic> defines this phrase as follows: “to come to the aid of someone in need.”<sup>67</sup> Of course, Dammit, whether dog or human, suffers horribly for his Transcendental flight as an unseen support bar beheads him during his pigeon-wing, and his headless body falls backward, short of the stile. No one helps the “sad dog” Dammit over his stile. However, Poe does “come to the aid of someone in need,” and that someone is a writer who appreciates “the <italic>quaint</italic> in phraseology” when used in its proper context: Poe himself. As David Grantz puts it in his essay “I Am Safe,” “Poe purposes ridicule of those who presume to judge him, and of their small-mindedness. This ridicule is his theme.”<sup>68</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The title of “Never Bet the Devil Your Head” contains its ostensible “moral,” but the tale continually mocks this moral through its use of uncertain identity, rhetorical flourish, and double meaning. Perhaps, instead of a “moral,” this tale contains a <italic>lesson</italic>, one which Begnal, as noted above, has perceived: “Never Bet the Devil Your Head” includes “no conventional moral,” and, more important, “it is not the responsibility of the artist to provide one.” In this tale, the devil really is in the details.</p>
