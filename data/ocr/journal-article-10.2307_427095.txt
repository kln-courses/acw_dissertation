<plain_text><page sequence="1">PETER FINGESTEN The Six-Fold Law of Symbolism I Symbolism has risen to great prominence in our time due to the pioneer work of Cas- sirer, Whitehead, Freud, Jung, Tillich, and others. In spite of the widespread recogni- tion of this relatively new field, the confu- sion that still surrounds such concepts as ab- straction, symbol, or allegory is appalling. Certain scholars and psychologists consid- ered symbols bottomless containers into which interpretations could be poured more or less arbitrarily. This practice, instead of bringing order and system to an already dif- ficult subject, has further compounded its difficulties. Thus far, philosophers and art and literary critics have been more scientific in that they treated symbols descriptively, without forcing them into foregone conclu- sions. We hope to clarify this subject by outlining a six-fold hierarchy of symbols which follows a predictable sequence and constitutes a new law of symbolism. "Symbol" stems from the Greek symballo, to throw together, join, or unite. It derives from the ancient custom, the symbola, signs of recognition between a host and his guests.l The host would break an earthen- PETER FINGESTEN, author of East Is East (Muhlen- berg Press, 1956), is associate professor of art and Chairman of the art department at Pace College, New York City.

When host and guests met again, the broken pieces would be joined together and served as a sign of recognition. Symbol, in its original context, meant secret sign of recognition, since only the pieces held by the host and particular guests would fit together to make a meaningful whole. This implies that the pieces, or the idea and its symbol, must per- fectly correspond to each other. Notwith- standing primitive usage, where anything could serve as a symbol of the numinous, not all symbols are commensurate to the idea. There is important corroboration to this effect in Matthew 12:6, "I tell you, something greater than the temple is here." In other words, the spiritual reality is not only greater than the symbol, but even an abstract symbol may be unable to express or contain it. Symbols are not created by gifted indi- viduals but are the anonymous expressions of mankind that reach back into pre-history. Creative art is personal, symbols are im- personal. They have no pathos, and their appeal is neither strictly formal nor self- expressive. The moment a symbol attracts attention to itself it either has been trans- formed into art, or has become magical. As Jane Harrison puts it, "What might have been an ideal becomes an idol."2 This was the fate of many symbols which were be- lieved to be imbued with "virtues." Nor does a symbol need to be executed in an</page><page sequence="2">388 PETER FINGESTEN exquisite formal manner. A rude graffito, such as the anchor cross in the Catacombs, is sufficient to evoke that "other," the ab- stract concept it stands for. A creative work of art exists on so many levels-formal, ideational and symbolic-that its complex- ity alone lifts it beyond mere symbolism. Susanne K. Langer expressed this succinctly: "Artistic forms are more complex than any other symbolic forms we know."3 As a matter of fact, works of art that are pre- dominantly symbolical tend to fail as pure aesthetic forms. A work of art exists by virtue of its ex- pressiveness, its formal values, its force of conviction and its compositional arrange- ment. It is self-explanatory, while a symbol is not. Most symbols, unfortunately, do not have just one definite meaning but are sus- ceptible to various interpretations. They can be read in contradictory terms. The fish symbol, for example, may be female (Venus) or male (Christ); the pig, clean or unclean; the serpent, wise or evil; the rose could represent passion or purity; the cross, life or death; the dove, sexuality or the Holy Ghost; and so forth. Also, ignorance of the meaning of a specific symbol may lead to erroneous ex post facto explanations or etiological myths. A curious instance of this is the famous I H S. Originally, this mono- gram derived from the first three Greek letters of the name Iesous. Another, later interpretation, ascribed to Constantine's vision before his battle against Maxentius, interprets the same three letters to mean In Hoc Signo [Vinces]. In its Latinized form this monogram also yields the popular ver- sion, Jesus Hominum Salvator. More re- cently, the same letters were interpreted in English to mean I Have Suffered, and also I Have Saved. A German version is Jesus Heiland Seligmacher. This is but one in- stance of five different concurrent interpre- tations of the same symbol. Today we stand at the crossroad where most traditional sym- bols have lost their power and where new ones have not as yet made their appearance. Symbols, when alive, have a deep psychic impact. They are kept alive as long as belief in their efficacy and power breathes life into them. When faith is lost in a symbol-that is, in the abstract concept for which it stands-the symbol will automatically be- come meaningless. We are reminded of the symbols of Gnosticism which once promised immortality but are now just the lifeless debris of a forgotten religion. This phe- nomenon was clearly recognized by Dean Inge. "It is the tendency of all symbols to petrify or evaporate, and either process is fatal to them. They soon repudiate their mystical origin, and forthwith lose their religious content."4 The transformation of abstract symbols into figurative ones is characterized by an increase in the realism and sensuality with which they are depicted. This process infers also a gradual loss of the abstract concept for which the symbol stands. This principle can be verified with the development of the cross. At first only a plain cross was de- picted, then a cross with a lamb, and finally a cross with the corpus. The Seventh Gen- eral Council (in Trullo), 692 A.D., decreed that icons which represent the lamb be henceforth substituted with the crucified. "... In order therefore that 'that which is perfect' may be delineated to the eyes of all, at least in colored expression, we decree that the figure in human form of the Lamb who taketh away the sin of the world, Christ our God, be henceforth exhibited in images in- stead of the ancient lamb, so that all may understand by means of it the depth of the humiliation of the Word of God, and that we may recall to our memory his conversa- tion in the flesh, his passion and solitary death, and his redemption which was wrought for the whole world" (Canon LXXXII).5 The crucifixion appears during the Fifth Century A.D. and is of the so-called tri- umphant type. The famous wooden panel of S. Sabina, Rome, shows an erect male figure with slightly outstretched arms, flanked by two smaller figures in similar at- titudes. No crosses are present, however, and it may represent a transitional or hesitant attempt to represent this scene. The ivory panel from a casket, British Museum, also of the Fifth Century, is probably the first unmistakable crucifixion, for in it are the cross, inscription, John, Mary, the legion- naire, and Judas hanging from a tree. Such examples are rare before about the Eighth</page><page sequence="3">The Six-Fold Law of Symbolism 389 Century and were often greeted with aston- ishment. "In sixth-century-France the paint- ing of Christ on the Cross in a church still excited such scandal that the bishop had to have it covered with a veil."6 The process of symbolization of an ab- stract concept is a long and complicated one. Until the concept emerges as an anthro- pomorphic symbol, as in the case of Osiris or Buddha, it goes through several stages that seem to follow a distinct order. First there is the abstract concept, symbolized by an abstract (aniconic) symbol. This in turn is symbolized by a zoomorphic one and that eventually is combined, associated or re- placed by an anthropomorphic symbol. Ab- stract symbols do not maintain their hold over the imagination of the people who de- mand more concrete embodiments or per- sonifications in their need to visualize an abstract concept. Organized religion en- couraged this transformation of symbols. Following are several examples tracing the transformation of symbols (we omit dendromorphic and other minor forms in order to emphasize the principle): Abstract concept Holy Ghost Abstract symbol Golden rays Theriomorphic symbol Dove Anthropomorphic symbol Third person of Trinity Abstract concept Soul Abstract symbol Shadow or Breath Theriomorphic symbol Butterfly, Bird Anthropomorphic symbol Winged youth Abstract concept Divine power Abstract symbol Thunderbolt Theriomorphic symbol Eagle Anthropomorphic symbol Zeus Abstract concept Life Abstract symbol Flame Zoomorphic symbols Panther, Lion, Ox and Goat Anthropomorphic symbol Dionysus Abstract concept Life Abstract symbol Ankh cross, or moon Zoomorphic symbol Cow Anthropomorphic symbol Isis Abstract concept Sun god Abstract symbol Djed pillar Zoomorphic symbol Bull Anthropomorphic symbol Osiris Abstract concept God, the Preserver Abstract symbol Solar discus Theriomorphic symbol Garuda Anthropomorphic symbol Vishnu Abstract concept Timelessness Abstract symbol Circle Zoomorphic symbol Snake biting its own tail Anthropomorphic symbol Buddha in Nirvana</page><page sequence="4">390 PETER FINGESTEN Abstract concept Storm god Abstract symbol Axe Zoomorphic symbol Bull Anthropomorphic symbol Adad Abstract concept Great mother Abstract symbol Meteoric stone Zoomorphic symbol Pair of Lions Anthropomorphic symbol Kybele With certain symbols some of these stages may be omitted, as in the case of the concept of Innocence, for which no abstract symbol is known, but whose zoomorphic symbol is the lamb which also symbolizes Christ. In the instance of the Logos, its abstract sym- bol is the Alpha and Omega, no zoomorphic symbol is known (unless we take the Lion of Judah, Rev. 5:5, as its zoomorphic sym- bol-but confusion arises from the fact that it applies to the second person of the Trin- ity which, according to the Nicene Creed, is consubstantial with the first and third per- son) but its anthropomorphic ones are a hand issuing from clouds or a rainbow, and, later, an Old Bearded Man. In the case of visual symbols of abstract concepts, al- legorism is the last stage of transformation into figurative substitutions until, in some cases, the original abstract concept is lost. An allegory is a more literary device that substitutes the anthropomorphic symbol with further, ever more remote, imagery. Typical symbol sequences are: Logos- cross-fish-bearded male-unicorn; sky father-keraunos-eagle-bearded male- bull raping Europa; destructive principle- drum-bull-dancing Shiva-infinite lin- gam. The principle of the transformation of symbols can be tested in reverse. Every al- legorical scene covers up earlier, more ab- stract types of symbols. For instance, in typical scenes of the Enlightenment of Buddha under the Bodhi tree, protected by the naga (hooded serpent), there are present an anthropomorphic symbol (the Buddha), a zoomorphic one (the serpent), and a dendromorphic symbol (the Bodhi tree). All of these symbols replaced the more abstract and earlier wheel of the law, throne, stupa, trisula, umbrella, mountain, and so forth. Discussing the four Gateways of the great Stupa at Sanchi (Andhra Dy- nasty, c. First Century B.C.), Sir John Marshall wrote, "Most of the inscriptions carved here and there on the gateways record, like those on the balustrades, the names of the pious individuals or guilds who contributed to their erection, or take the form of imprecatory curses on anyone so impious as to appropriate the gateways to the use of an unorthodox sect. Not one of them says a word, unfortunately, of the scenes and figures delineated, the interpre- tation of which is all the more difficult owing to the practice, universal in the Early School of Indian Art, of never portraying the Buddha in bodily form, but of indicat- ing his presence merely by some symbol, such as his foot-prints or the throne on which he sat, or the sacred tree associated with his enlightenment."7 (Anthropomor- phic representations of Gautama Buddha, originated over 500 years after his death, at Gandhara in the so-called Graeco- Buddhist style of sculpture during the First Century A.D.) This principle applies to Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Hindu, Buddhist, Greek, Roman and Christian art. Exceptions are Prehis- toric art where the process was in some cases reversed, from figurization to abstract-pos- sibly because of a simplification of outlines that, through timeless repetitions, became abstracted. It is possible that many Mezo- lithic and Neolithic symbols and signs were once zoomorphic or anthropomorphic. Also, the arts of Judaism and Islam are excluded because of the prohibitions against repre- sentations of men and animals, except in a decorative or illustrative sense. These two religions, with rare exceptions, developed only abstract, symbolic vocabularies. There are still two higher degrees of sym-</page><page sequence="5">The Six-Fold Law of Symbolism 391 bols as yet neither recognized nor named by scholars which, in conjunction with the known four main stages (abstract, zoomor- phic, anthropomorphic, allegoric), delineate the whole scale of human religious and aesthetic experience, from non-symbolic to allegoric processes. The two higher degrees are (1) metasymbolic, or that style of mod- ern art in which the forms, lines and colors do not symbolize anything outside of them- selves, and (2) asymbolic, the highest degree, mystic identification with Ultimate Reality. II Several modern philosophers assert that all of our perceptions take place on a sym- bolic level, for the encounter with reality undergoes so many transformations that what we ultimately experience is not the reality itself but a symbol thereof. How- ever, in spite of the arguments of logicians, semanticists, and psychologists, we believe that there are at least two kinds of experi- ence of reality which may be said to be non- symbolic. One is the mystical experience, the other a certain kind of abstract art which we call metasymbolic. We live in a time without a vital tradition of symbolism, but we do not live in a time without creative art. Rebelling against all traditions, symbolic as well as stylistic, the abstract artist shows a way to a new aware- ness of the Absolute. What traditional sym- bolism has lost in validity has been regained by the abstractionists in private imagery. The personal experience is the only experi- ence that has validity; this has long been true in the field of religious experience as well as art. Among the qualities which lend signifi- cance to the historical styles of art is their degree of abstraction. One style overcomes and spiritualizes the form with mysterious shadows, another with light. Certain styles distort, others perfect a heightened magic or sur-realism which reveals the world anew -but there is always an attempt to abstract. Abstract, or, more correctly, non-objective art, can be compared to a screen that filters out representational elements. This does not imply that representational styles can- not evoke a spiritual reality, but it is ex- tremely difficult to transfigure the world of appearance. Non-objectivism hurdled all such barriers and penetrated beyond nature into the very heart of the energies and spiritual tensions of the cosmos. Since the direct, visual translation of spiritual states of mind could not be real- ized before the advent of non-objectivism, the earlier styles either had to disguise them, as Rembrandt did, with the use of his inner light, or suggest other dimensions by break- ing up the apparent solidity of form, as in Cubism. Non-objectivism in its purest state rejects all references to nature, objects or symbolism, and represents the first meaning- ful yet non-symbolic style in the history of art. What it communicates lies hidden solely within its own formal world which carries no associative or denotative values whatsoever. In the masterpieces of this style, which we called in another context meta- symbolic,8 there is an indissoluble unity be- tween energies, form, and meaning. Piet Mondrian's severe, mathematically-perfect compositions transubstantiate line and right angles into pure spirit. Those who can understand the mysteries of his grid system can understand an aspect of the Absolute. Pure abstraction has been in existence for about fifty years. It was started by Kandin- sky and Mondrian, each finding in it an avenue for personal expression. Both ar- rived at their respective styles out of spirit- ual necessities. To them the destruction of natural forms, traditional symbolism, and superficial imagery liberated the spirit. What they aimed at were eternal images re- moved from the accidental time-bound con- formations of manifested nature. That the genesis of non-objective art is not due to aesthetic considerations but primarily to spiritual ones is carefully documented in their published writings.9 Even if non-objective art has entered its decline, as some critics believe, due to a movement to return to the figure and na- ture, any future criticism should give its due to the heroic attempt of many artists to transcend man and the visible world in favor of an absolute ideal. Non-objective art, the aesthetics of the Absolute, demon- strates the possibility of apprehending and</page><page sequence="6">392 PETER FINGESTEN expressing metaphysical concepts without recourse to symbols, language or subject matter. III Plotinus, St. Augustine, Dionysius the Areopagite, Erigena, Thomas i Kempis, Meister Eckhardt, St. John of the Cross, Jacob Boehme, George Fox, and many other Western mystics have experienced a direct encounter with the Absolute which is, by definition, a non-symbolic experience. Well- trained yogins, also, know that when they have achieved the highest state of medita- tion, identification with Brahma, they have risen beyond myths and symbols. The true yogin stills his mind to such a degree that all thought processes and all sense impres- sions cease to exist for the time being. As the Maitri Upanishad 6:24 puts it: But when the mind has been dissolved, And there is the joy whose only witness is the self- That is Brahma, the immortal, the pure! That is the wayl That indeed is the worldl10 Dr. Mircea Eliade, the eminent historian of religion, has recently made the follow- ing assertion: "... reality that is strictly metaphysical... can be approached in no other way than through myths and sym- bols."" These limitations raised by Dr. Eliade have been refuted countless times by mystics, both Christian and non-Christian, who achieved mergence into Ultimate Real- ity. The classic Christian instance is the saying, "I and the Father are one" (Jn. 10:30). This was spoken viva voce in Ara- maic to the Jews in the temple in the por- tico of Solomon in an historical situation. Significantly enough, Dionysius the Aero- pagite quoted this saying in his famous mys- tical treatise, The Divine Names, Chap. II.12 St. Augustine and Dionysius have set the pattern for the mystic ascent in Christian terms. Most important later mystics have taken their inspiration from one or the other. St. Augustine describes in his Con- fessions (IX:25) how every activity, physi- cal and mental, and every sound and symbol must be "silenced" in quest of identifica- tion with the Absolute. Suppose, for any person, that the tumult of the flesh be silenced-silenced, the images of earth and water and air; silenced, the very heavens; silenced, his very soul unto himself, then, if he pass beyond himself, ceasing to think of himself by means of images-silenced, his dreams and imaginary apparitions, every tongue and every sign [i.e., symbol] and whatever comes to be by transition, if he be granted this complete silence ...and if, having said this, they become quiet, once they have lifted up his ear to Him who made them; then, if He alone speak, not through them, but through Himself, so that we might hear His Word, not through fleshly speech, or through the voice of an angel, or through the crash of thunder, or through the darkness of a similitude, but Him- self whom we love in these things-and if we might hear Him without these things, just as now we reached out and, with the speed of thought, touched the Eternal Wisdom abiding above all things-and if this could continue, and other visions of a much lower type were taken away, and this one vision were to enrapture, absorb and enclose its beholder in inner joys, so that life might forever be like that instant of understand- ing, for which we have sighed, then surely, this is the meaning of: "Enter into the joy of Thy Master"?3 Dionysius the Areopagite, who, like St. Augustine, belongs to the Neo-Platonic tra- dition, makes the conditions for mystic union even clearer and insists that the seeker must renounce "all the apprehen- sions of his understanding" which, as a mat- ter of course, include myths, symbols, and language. ... let us set before our minds the scriptural rule that in speaking about God we should declare the Truth, not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the power which the Spirit stirred up in the Sacred Writers, whereby, in a manner surpassing speech and knowledge, we embrace those truths which, in like manner sur- pass them, in that Union which exceeds our fac- ulty, and exercise of discursive, and of intuitive reason.14 In another place he states the paradox of mysticism, that one must renounce all knowledge in order to rise to absolute knowledge. ... the divinest and highest of the things per- ceived by the eyes of the body or the mind are but the symbolic language of things subordinate to Him who Himself transcendeth them all. Through these things His incomprehensible pres- ence is shown walking upon those heights of His holy places which are perceived by the mind; and when It breaks forth, even from the things that are beheld and from those that behold them, and</page><page sequence="7">The Six-Fold Law of Symbolism 393 plunges the true initiate unto the Darkness of Unknowing wherein he renounces all the appre- hensions of his understanding and is enwrapped in that which is wholly intangible and invisible, be- longing wholly to Him that is beyond all things and to none else (whether himself or another), and being through the passive stillness of all his reasoning powers united by his highest faculty to Him that is wholly unknowable, of whom thus by a rejection of all knowledge he possesses a knowl- edge that exceeds his understanding.s The consensus of all mystics is that Ulti- mate Reality can be experienced on an asymbolic level of absorption, merger, un- ion, or identification. But when a mystic wants to speak of it, he is forced to utilize a symbolic system like language, or, in Plo- tinus' words, "the image" (Enneads V:3,6). To assert, however, that without myths and symbols the Absolute cannot be appre- hended contradicts, without evidence to the contrary, the long tradition of Christian and non-Christian mysticism. "The philosopher Isidorus (5th Cent. A.D.), we are told in the fragments of the life of him written by Damascius, 'did not care to offer homage to images: he went to the gods themselves di- rect, the gods who are hidden, not in the holy places of temples, but hidden within the soul, in the inexpressible region, what- ever it may be, of nescience (agnosia). How then did he go to the gods such as these? He went by a kind of mighty love, itself inex- pressible. What we mean by this love those who have experience of it know, but to say what it is in words is impossible, even to conceive of it in thought is not any eas- ier.' "16 IV Those who call for a return to symbolism, including theologians concerned with the liturgical revival, rarely, if ever, suggest which of the wealth of traditional symbols they would like to see revived. Do any of these still have the power to teach, shock, or convert us? We shall limit ourselves to a concise discussion of one symbol, the fish, and one myth, the unicorn. The fish has been a popular magical amu- let, symbol of life and fertility, as well as an astrological sign since pre-Babylonian times. One of the most ancient gods of the Meso- potamian plain, Ea, god of water and wis- dom, was represented by a composite sym- bol, an ibex and fish. From Mesopotamia, this symbol diffused over most of the an- cient world. In India it became the symbol of Vishnu's first incarnation (matsya) who, in this form, as divine fish, saved Manu, the first man, from the flood. The Buddhists in- cluded the fish as one of their eight auspi- cious symbols. In the West, the fish was mainly associated with female goddesses. The Egyptians, for instance, worshipped the oxyrhynchus fish as sacred to Isis, Hathor, Mut, and other goddesses. According to Ovid, Venus transformed herself into a fish. Derceto (or Atargatis) was a goddess of Hieropolis, in Syria; fish were sacred to her because she was believed to have either fallen into a lake and been saved by a fish, or transformed into one. She was therefore depicted as a half-woman, half-fish. Eros, god of love, the child of Aphrodite, is repre- sented in classic art as riding upon a dol- phin (confused in classic times with a fish). In this manner various symbols were com- bined in one image, the creative sea, the fish symbol itself, and the divine child. The fish became a secret sign of recogni- tion among Christians during the period of persecution. Clement of Alexandria per- mitted its use on seal rings, and Tertullian enlarged its meaning to include baptism, "But we, little fishes, after the example of OUR FISH Jesus Christ, are born in water."17 About three centuries later, St. Augustine said that in the word fish "Christ is mysti- cally understood, because he was able to live, to exist, without sin in the abyss of this mortality as in the depth of waters."18 He, no doubt, referred to the famous acrostic Ichthys which yielded, in Greek, the sen- tence, "Jesus Christ Son of God, Saviour." There is still no agreement among schol- ars which particular instance in the New Testament gave the Fathers the authority to call Christ "fish" nor why the Eucharist was symbolized by a fish, as in Roman catacomb paintings and on many early Christian sarcophagi (Fig. 1). An early third-century inscription by Abercius, Bishop of Hieropo- lis in Phrygia, (recognized, however, as pagan by several scholars, such as Robert Eisler and Albrecht Dieterich), is still cited</page><page sequence="8">394 PETER FINGESTEN as historical support of the fish as a symbol of Christ. The important point is that at no time did Christ refer to himself as fish or fisherman. Peter, as we know, is connected with fish, both professionally as well as symbolically (Mk. 1:17). The feeding of the multitudes (Mk. 6:35-44) gives no direct support to this symbol, nor does Christ's partaking of broiled fish after the Resurrec- tion (Lk. 24:42-43). There is nothing in the account of the miraculous drought in Lake Gennesaret to suggest convincingly the fish as a symbol of Christ (Lk. 5:4-9). The feeding of the disciples with bread and fish after the Resurrection (Jn. 21:9-14) has traditionally been connected to the Eucha- rist. But in New Testament context itself the fish is not a Eucharistic symbol, and there is no compelling reason to interpret the above passages as such. The Last Sup- per, as will be remembered, consisted only of bread and wine (Mk. 14:22-25). In one instance, Christ mentioned the "sign of Jonah" (Mat. 12:39) as referring to himself. "For as Jonah became a sign to the men of Nineveh, so will the Son of man be to this generation" (Lk. 11:30). His three days in the belly of the fish were compared by Christ to the three days he spent in the "heart of the earth" (Mat. 12:40). But even in this instance the fish neither symbolizes Jonah nor Christ who is "greater than Jonah" (Mat. 12:41). The parable of the fish net (Mat. 13:47) and the story of the shekel in the fish's mouth (Mat. 17:27) are too indirect to have any bearing upon the symbol (of Christ) under discussion. Jere- miah's "many fishers" (16:16) applies to the scourge of Israel and other, even more ob- lique references to fish hooks (Amos 4:2) or fish nets (Hab. 1: 14-17) are either not com- plimentary to Israel or refer to its enemies. Even if forced into allegorical interpreta- tions, these instances would lend no support to the fish as a symbol of Christ although they admit, of course, as some of the above references, to other allegories. This ex- hausts the scriptural possibilities, except for Leviathan, a gigantic fish monster who was destroyed by the Lord (Is. 27:1). The Chris- tian fish symbol, therefore, must be con- sidered an accretion that cannot be logically explained as having risen out of scriptural soil. Erwin R. Goodenough has recently dem- onstrated conclusively that the fish is an an- cient, extremely diffused symbol of life and immortality that was adopted even by the Jews in the decoration of synagogues (Dura), catacombs, and amulets.19 This symbol con- stituted a lingua franca in the Graeco- Roman world and was borrowed freely by nearly all the religions of that time. "Chris- tianity and Judaism alike rejected Dionysus and his rites and myths with horror, while they kept his symbols." Elsewhere in this monumental study, Goodenough states that "the Jews themselves seem to me to have been enriching the fish symbol with ex post facto interpretation when in later writings they joined it with the zodiacal Pisces, in ascendance in the month of Adar, the last month of the Jewish year and so, they said, the symbol of the last age, that of the Mes- siah."20 The fish symbol was incorporated into Christian allegorical thinking during the post-Apostolic period, for it was a popular symbol which could easily be joined to cer- tain Old and New Testament statements. The Jews of the dispersion had already ac- cepted it as a messianic symbol (according to post-exilic rabbinic legends the great fish Leviathan would be sacrificed during the messianic age) in spite of the ancient prohibitions in Deuteronomy 4:18 which, at least until the period of kings, applied also to its symbolic usage.21 In Old Testa- ment context the fish is still an inferior creature subject to Adam (Gen. 1:26), fear- ful of Noah (Gen. 9:2). Men, like fish, are victims of cruel fate (Ecc. 9:12) and fish fear the presence of God (Ez. 38:20). In short, the fish, as a sacred Christian symbol, must have come from other than Old Testament sources. Indeed, Goodenough's conclusion is that Jews and Christians alike borrowed their symbols, among which is the fish, from a common pagan (Dionysiac) source. The fish, in addition to symbolizing Christ, is also used as a symbol of baptism, the faithful, and the Eucharist.

The fish symbol has been utilized by Christianity for almost two thousand years, and by non-Christian religions for about five millennia. It is inadequate to symbolize Christ, the Incarnation of the Absolute, ambiguous as to its significance, and acts like a palimpsest from which the earlier contents have not been completely erased. The unicorn is more complex than the fish symbol, for it is a myth, allegory, and symbol at the same time. It was one of the favorite images of Christ during the Age of Faith (Fig. 2). So-called unicorn horns were kept and exhibited in many churches. They were regarded as sacred objects worthy of devotion. The church of St. Denis, near Paris, boasted of a seven-foot-long specimen. St. Marks, in Venice, exhibited two horns that were looted in Constantinople, one of which was inscribed on its silver handle, "John Palaeologus, Emperor, Unicorn good against poison." The Cathedral of Milan and Westminster Abbey kept large speci- mens, and many other less wealthy churches had fragments of this miraculous material. There was no royal treasury or wealthy prince who did not have one. A section of a "true unicorn's horn" (verum cornu mono- cerotis) was worth over ten times its weight in gold; entire horns sometimes brought twice as much as that. Its popularity is ascribable in part to the then universal belief that the horn itself, or beakers made of it, could detect the pres- ence of poison. Even leading thinkers of the Middle Ages like Hildegarde of Bingen, Albertus Magnus, and Peter Albano were convinced of this. Beakers of this miraculous material were used at the tables of those who could afford them, due, no doubt, to the widespread fear of being poisoned. This particular aspect of the unicorn myth can be traced to India. The Greek physician Ctetsias, who was employed during the fifth century B.C. at the court of the Persian king Darius II, wrote the first account of this myth. In a lost book of his, Indica, preserved in an ab- stract by the ninth-century Greek philoso- pher and churchman Photius, we find the following description of the unicorn, sub- stantially the same as was circulated during the Middle Ages, but at which time it had already become a symbol as well as allegory of Christ. "There are in India certain wild asses which are as large as horses, and larger. Their bodies are white, their heads dark red and their eyes dark blue. They have a horn on the forehead which is about a foot and a half in length. The dust filed from this horn is administered in a potion as a pro- tection against deadly drugs. The base of this horn, for two hands breadth above the brow, is pure white; the upper part is sharp and of a vivid crimson... and the remain- der, or middle portion is black. Those who drink out of these horns, made into drink- ing vessels, are not subject, they say, to con- vulsions or to the holy disease [epilepsy]. Indeed, they are immune even to poisons if, either before or after swallowing such, they drink wine, water, or anything else from these beakers ... The animal is exceedingly swift and powerful, so that no creature, neither the horse nor any other, can over- take it."22 In this description can be found the origin of the theory of the curative ef- fects of the unicorn horn and of the ani- mal's capacity to elude would-be captors. The other, more well-known aspect of the unicorn myth, the "Virgin Capture," un- doubtedly derives from an independent tra- dition, perhaps Arabic or Chinese. It is the latter version, popularized by the Bestiaries, which we find represented in so many manuscripts, tapestries, stained glass win- dows, and vessels of the High Middle Ages (Fig. 3). One Bestiary (Physiologus) asserts, "He is a small animal, like a kid, but sur- prisingly fierce for his size, with one very sharp horn on his head, and no hunter is able to capture him by force. Yet there is a trick by which he is taken. Men lead a vir- gin to the place where he most resorts and leave her there alone. As soon as he sees this virgin he runs and lays his head in her lap. She fondles him and he falls asleep. The hunters then approach and capture him and lead him to the palace of the king."23 Other sources assert that the unicorn is attracted by the "odour of virginity" and can also be employed to test the chastity of young girls. A Syriac version of the Bestiary gives the</page><page sequence="11">396 PETER FINGESTEN following somewhat more erotic variant. "There is an animal called dajja, extremely gentle, which the hunters are unable to cap- ture because of its great strength. It has in the middle of its brow a single horn. But observe the ruse by which the huntsmen take it. They lead forth a young virgin, pure and chaste, to whom, when the animal sees her, he approaches, throwing himself upon her. Then the girl offers him her breasts, and the animal begins to suck the breasts of the maiden and to conduct himself freely with her. Then the girl, while sitting quietly, reaches forth her hand and grasps the horn on the animal's brow, and at this point the huntsmen come up and take the beast and go away with him to the king.- Likewise the Lord Christ has raised up for us a horn of salvation in the midst of Jeru- salem, in the house of God, by the inter- cession of the mother of God, a virgin pure, chaste, full of mercy, immaculate, invio- late."24 Elusiveness, eroticism, poison protection, and virgin capture became fused and con- fused, assuring this myth great popularity in the mediaeval mind. In the Chinese ver- sion, in spite of the more pronounced phallic elements, there are undeniable typo- logical connections to the West. Chinese writers themselves say that the unicorn, or Ki-lin, is not native to China, but that it comes from "afar." A Ki-lin is supposed to have appeared to the mother of Confucius just before his birth, holding in its mouth a jade tablet bearing an inscription which de- clared her son's future greatness. Pictures of the Ki-lin were used in women's quarters of Chinese homes as charms to promote the birth of great men, or, at least, of boys rather than girls.25 The unicorn myth persisted until about the seventeenth century when so-called uni- corn horns were finally recognized as nar- whale tusks brought to the European mar- ket by increased whale-hunting activities in the far North. Before that time Islamic traders sold them without divulging their sources, contributing to their alleged mys- terious origin. The narwhale tusk is not horn, but a long, pointed, and twisted ivory extension of its nose. This realization of a more scientific age dealt the final blow to this myth. The very fact that the unicorn myth has ingloriously died as an allegory of Christ proves that it could not sustain its claims to make possible an apprehension of the Abso- lute. The purpose of symbols is to simplify and to convey complex, abstract concepts, but they can also distort and misrepresent them. Whatever will emerge by way of a future religious symbolism, one thing is sure, one cannot catch the Absolute in a unicorn or a fish. V Man cannot be limited in his attempt to understand himself, his world, or the Ab- solute. Mystics, since time immemorial, have gone beyond traditional symbols. Ab- stract artists, too, have discovered a new dimension in our time. Modern science has overwhelmed us with new symbols, and there is no reason to assume that this will stop. As old symbols fall into disuse, new ones will be developed. It is the nature of the human mind to personify and to assign attributes to abstract concepts. As we have seen above, the ab- stract symbol becomes increasingly removed from the fundamental concept as it goes in turn through its zoomorphic, anthropomor- phic, and allegorical stages. These obey law- ful behavior which can be formulated as follows in The Six-Fold Law of Symbolism: There is a hierarchy of symbols consisting of six stages, from asymbolism to allegorism. In this hierarchy the so-called abstract sym- bol does not occupy the highest place but is preceded by two higher stages and suc- ceeded by three stages of relative decline. 1. asymbolic (mystic experience) non-symbolic, non-verbal encounter with Ultimate Reality 2. metasymbolic (non-objective art or non-denotative, non-connotative, self-refer- analogous forms) rent; form and meaning fused</page><page sequence="12">The Six-Fold Law of Symbolism 397 3. symbolic abstract (aniconic pat- connotative of larger, abstract concepts terns) 4. zoomorphic, theriomorphic, ichthyo- once removed from the abstract symbol; con- morphic (representations of ani- cretization of attributes and qualities mals, birds, fish) 5. anthropomorphic (human ideal types) twice removed from the abstract symbol; personification of an abstract concept 6. allegoric (figurative substitutes, dis- thrice removed from the abstract symbol; guised symbolism) narrative, moralizing, popular imagery; also hidden esoteric message Growing out of this law is the following principle: Each successive stage of symboli- zation after the third entails a progressive weakening of the abstract concept until the sixth stage is reached in which the abstract concept is lost. Although any single stage in itself is not essential to the process stated above, the order is nevertheless irreversible and all at- tribution necessarily follows this law. An association is made which is irreversible, for once an abstract concept is symbolized in any one or all of the various degrees, it is impossible to conceive of it again in its purity. 1Max Schlesinger, Geschichte Des Symbols (Ber- lin, 1912), p. 14, 19-20. 2Ancient Art and Ritual (Oxford, 1948), p. 227. 3Problems of Art (New York, 1957), p. 25. 4 Christian Mysticism (London, 1948), p. 5. 5Ante-Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers (Grand Rapids, 1956), v.
