<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME OF US MUST DEPART: AN INTERTEXTUAL READING OF THE MOUNTAIN POEM BY IBN KHAF?JAH The twelfth century Andalusian poet Ibn Khaf?jah has enjoyed considerable critical attention in recent years. Magda Nowaihi has recently written a book-length literary analysis of his poetry. Salma Khadra Jayyusi gives him a prominent place in one of her articles on Andalusian literature in The Legacy of Muslim Spain, as does James Monroe in his earlier student anthology of Andalusian Literature. Arie Schippers has published transla tions of his poetry on aging and death, and with John Mattock a discussion of the theme of the battlefield of love in his work, and J.C. B?rgel has done an analysis of his cosmological imagery.1 These works have gone a long way toward increasing our understanding and appreciation of Ibn Khaf?jah and of Andalusian poetry generally, a literature which heretofore had been dismissed by many as overly ornamental and derivative of eastern (some would say superior) literary models.2 These scholars have not only described Ibn Khaf?jah's place in Arab literary history, but have provided us with studies of his rhetorical style and have begun to explore the philosophical underpinnings of his more contemplative works. Those works mentioned above which strive to analyze Ibn Khaf?jah's poetry serve as useful exercises in examining the literary devices and imagery across the entire corpus of Ibn Khaf?jah's poetry, but what we con tinue to lack are careful studies of single poems. Lines from various com positions are grouped together and compared, but are not analyzed in the 1 Magda M. Nowaihi, The Poetry of Ibn Khaf?jah: a Literary Analysis (Leiden: EJ.

And Jayyusi, although gen erally appreciative of Ibn Khaf?jah's talents, laments the fact that he "was born in an age of embellishments" which "dilute and obscure what is genuinely 'poetic'."

Moreover, these analyses often stop short of exploring the significance of the imagery, diction, and rhetorical devices that have been so thoroughly enumerated and described. We know, for instance, that Ibn Khaf?jah wrote a considerable amount of poetry in the "Arabian" style, that is, with extensive use of the imagery and diction of the poetry of pre-Islamic Arabia. But what is the significance of this use? Why has Ibn Khaf?jah, living (and, as we know from his other poetry, delight ing) in the lush gardens of al-Andalus, chosen so frequently to evoke the inhospitable desert of a distant past? Is it nostalgia for the pre-Islamic past as Jayyusi has suggested?3 And if so, why a nostalgia for this particular era? And what may be the relationship between this diction borrowed from another time and place, and the ideas and emotions that Ibn Khaf?jah seeks to convey in his works? In other words, how can the intertextual patterning created by the introduction of the pre-Islamic diction enrich our reading of the poetry? If we begin, as Michael Riffaterre does, with the supposition that it is the uniqueness of a work that defines its literariness, then the limitations of any study that does not take the individual poem as the unit of analysis will be immediately clear.4 A project that groups lines from various works for com parison and classification can define a poetics for the poet, a Khaf?jan style, but it will do little to help us to understand individual works. It may tell us how much the poet has conformed or deviated from his own stylistic norms, but rather than exposing and explaining the extraordinary in a poem, it emphasizes its conformity. Poems can be classified?a descriptive nature poem here, a metaphysical poem there, a poem on old age somewhere else?but their literary quality, what makes each one different from others of similar theme, structure, or style cannot be explained. As a first small step, then, in the process of describing Ibn Khaf?jah's literary achievements, I offer a reading of one poem by Ibn Khaf?jah in which I examine the linguistic, thematic, and structural intertextuality be tween this poem and selected pre-Islamic works. My reading will rely largely on the semiotic approach to analyzing poetry outlined by Michael Riffaterre in The Semiotics of Poetry5 and Text Production. The poem I have chosen to examine is probably his best known. It has been translated at least three times into English and is often chosen as exemplary of his work.6 This 3 Jayyusi, "Nature Poetry in al-Andalus," 380. 4 Michael Riffaterre, Text Production, trans.

Most obviously, it is one of his "Arabian" works, characterized not only by it pre-Islamic diction and imagery, but also by its form; the poem is cast as a rahll, that is, a description of the lonely perilous journey which is the second movement of the classical tripartite qasldah. Ibn Khaf?jah's b?'lyah on the mountain7 1. By your life, do you know whether it is the violent south winds that are heaving my saddles, or the backs of noble camels? 2. For I had hardly emerged as a star at the east's beginning before I had tra versed the ends of the west. 3. Alone, the deserts passing me from one to the other, until I was seeing the faces of death under the mask of darkness, 4. With no neighbor but a cutting sword, and no home but the frame of camels' saddles, 5. And no company but to laugh, for a while, with the mouths of hopes in the faces of desires. 6. In a night which whenever I said it has passed away showed this belief to be a false promise, 7. [A night] in which I trailed black-haired darkness, to embrace white bosomed hopes. 8. So I tore open the shirt of night to reveal a grayish figure who appeared as a white-toothed mouth, scowling. 9. I saw in him a dark piece of dawn, he contemplating a piercing, lit star, 10. And the peak of the lofty, high forelocked [mountain], rivaling the highest heavens with its withers, 11. Blocking the blowing of the wind from every direction, and crowding the stars at night with its shoulders. 12. Stately on the surface of the desert, as if throughout the nights it was think ing of consequences, 13. The clouds wrapping around it as black turbans, with red locks made of the flashes of lightning. 14. I listened to it though it was dumb, silent, for it talked to me, during the night of travel, of wondrous things, 15.

It would seem that the existence of a study of this work as an individual poem would obviate the need for the present analysis. However, Nowaihi's analysis consists largely of a line-by-line description of the rhetorical techniques employed in the work. She notes the continuation of particular themes and imagery throughout the work, but only occasionally explains the literary significance of the tropes she describes. Moreover, her reading of the poem differs significantly from that presented here. 7 Abu Ish?q Ibn Khaf?jah, Dlw?n, ed. Sayyid Mustafa Gh?zi (Alexandria: Mansha'at al Mac?rif, 1960), pp. 215-17.

And how often have night travelers, going and coming, passed by me while mounts and riders napped in my shade? 17. And how often have veering winds slapped my flanks, and green seas crowded my sides? 18. Only to have the hand of death enfold them, and the wind of distance and disasters carry them away. 19. The shaking of my trees is none other than the trembling of ribs, and the moaning of my doves, the cry of a lamenter. 20. And solace has not diminished my tears; rather, I have exhausted them over separation from friends. 21. How long will I remain, while a friend leaves, and bid farewell as he departs, never to return? 22. And how long will I shepherd the stars as they rise and set to the end of time? 23. So, show mercy, my Lord, at a prayer from an entreater, who extends to Your grace a supplicating palm." 24. It let me hear in its sermon every lesson that the tongue of experience inter preted, 25. And it consoled with what caused tears and comforted with what brought grief, and was, throughout the night journey, the best of companions. 26. And I said, having turned from it toward my destination, "Farewell! For some of us must remain, and others depart." It will be immediately obvious to any reader familiar with early Arabic poetry that the work at hand borrows heavily from pre-Islamic imagery. The narrator of the poem is introduced as riding a camel, as traveling from sun set to sunrise, as being led from one desert to another. He says in line 3 wahldan tah?d?nl al-fay?fi, which brings to mind a similar phrase in the famous l?mlyah of the pre-Islamic brigand poet, al-Shanfar?: azallu tah?d?hu al tan?'ifu athalu (a spleen-colored wolf whom the wastelands hand around).8 Like al-Shanfar? and Tarafah in his mu'allaqah, Ibn Khaf?jah's narrator travels with his sword as companion.9 His brief encounter with the gray wolf (shakhsin atlasi) evokes al-Shanfar?'s lupine companions as well as the 8 Al-Shanfar?, Qas?dat L?mlyat al-cArab wa yal?h?. . . . (Istanbul: Matba'at al-JawaDib, 1300 H.), line 26. 9 Al-Shanfar? in line 11 of his l?m?yah expresses exactly this emotion. Tarafah, in line 84 of his mucallaqah, describes his unwillingness to part with his weapon: fa'?laytu l? yanfakku kashh? bit?natan l?adbin raq?qi al-shafratayni muhannad?

The massive, turbaned mountain with whom the narrator speaks also brings to mind Imru5 al Qays's thablr, a mountain clothed in striped cloth (line 79 of the mucalla qah).n Before the mountain speaks, it is described as mute (asakhtu ilayhl wa-hwa akhrasu s?mltun). One is tempted to understand its speech, then, as answer to the question which Labid poses in the wuq?f cal? al-atl?l (stop ping before the ruins) of his mucallaqah.n Jaroslav Stetkevych has further pointed out that the mountain's plaint: "wa hatt? mat? arc? l-kaw?kiha s?hlranlfa min t?Win ukhr? l-lay?ll wa-gh?rihr (line 22) echoes one that appears re peatedly in pre-Islamic poetry.13 Through the extensive use of pre-Islamic imagery, then, the poet creates an intertextual patterning within his work. Because of the formulaic nature of pre-Islamic poetry, we cannot say beyond a doubt that the famous poems mentioned above are being consciously addressed by Ibn Khaf?jah, but it is clear that a pre-Islamic context is being evoked.14 The diction serves as an interpr?tant, to use another term from Riffaterre, that is, a sign that indicates the existence within the text of two signifying systems. Textual interpr?tants "lay down the rule of the poem's idiolect, guaranteeing, with the authority a normative grammar, a tradition, or a convention would have the semiotic 10 See lines 26-35 of Al-Shanfar?'s l?mlyah and lines 49-50 of Imru3 al-Qays's mucallaqah. 11 See line 79 of the mucallaqah in which he says: ka'anna thablran fi car?nayni wablih? kab?ru un?sin fi bij?din muzammall And Thabeer?why, when the first onrush of its deluge came, Thabeer was a great chieftain wrapped in a striped jubba (Arberry, 66). 12 Line 10 reads: waqaflu as'aluh? wa-kayfa su'?lun? summan khaw?lida m? yab?nu kal?muh?? So I stood and questioned that site; yet how should we question rocks set immovable, whose speech is nothing significant? (Arberry, 142). 13 Jaroslav Stetkevych, The Zephyrs of Najd: The Poetics of Nostalgia in the Classical Arabic Nasib (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993), 156. 14 Ibn Khaf?jah himself notes that he was influenced by al-Shar?f al-Rad?, Mihy?r al-Day lami, and al-Mutanabbi in his "Arabian" poems (Nowaihi, p. 1), but we must assume that he would have been completely aware of the pre-Islamic and early Umayyad underpinnings of this style and of the fact that any educated Arab reader of his works would be immediately reminded of the earlier works when reading his compositions. The complex relationship between Ibn Khaf?jah's work and that of his predecessors points to the distinction between influence as Harold Bloom defines it, and intertextuality.</page><page sequence="6">SOME OF US MUST DEPART 245 practice peculiar to the poem."15 The existence of an interpr?tant, then, is necessary to justify an intertextual reading of a poem. By relying on diction and imagery from another era, then, Ibn Khaf?jah invites us to bring that era into the present work, to read his poem not as a pre-Islamic work or even as an imitation of a pre-Islamic work, but as a text which seeks to cre ate a dialogue with works from that earlier time. Having established that Ibn Khaf?jah's work maintains a dialogic rela tionship with works from the pre-Islamic period, we must now explore just what sort of conversation he wishes to undertake. One could interpret his use of pre-Islamic imagery and diction as an attempt to recapture that time, as a yearning or even idealization of a simpler, nobler era. Indeed, Jayyusi has noted that much of Ibn Khaf?jah's poetry expresses just this sort of nos talgia. However, the tone of Ibn Khaf?jah's mountain poem is certainly not nostalgic, for although the j?hillyah period is evoked, one cannot say that it is in any way glorified or yearned for. Consider, for example, the type of rahll that Ibn Khaf?jah has created here. Typically, the pre-Islamic rahll treats two central themes: first, the prowess and endurance of the poet and his mount, expressed through a detailed description of the riding beast and boast and praise of both the animal's and the poet's physical attributes and abilities; and second, the difficulty of the journey?its length and hard ship, the solitude of the traveler, and the inhospitableness of the country through which he must pass. Ibn Khaf?jah, however, has eschewed the first theme, that is, the glorification of the poet and his mount, and chosen to emphasize the darker side of the rahll, the difficulty of the journey. His mount is not described, but only alluded to;16 the formulaic attributes that a poet often claims for himself in the rahll, that is, strength, fortitude and bravery in the face of danger and discomfort, are entirely absent from the poem. There is no glory, then, expressed in Ibn Khaf?jah's poem for which he can be nostalgic. Moreover, even if one were to read the poem as nos talgic, one would still have to ask the question, why nostalgia for this par ticular era and why express that nostalgia with a disembodied rahll? I will be arguing instead that through this poem Ibn Khaf?jah is evoking the ethos of the pre-Islamic qasldah, and particularly that of the rahll sec tion, as a means of presenting his personal philosophy. With this aim in mind, we must re-examine the poem, this time paying special attention to 15 Riffaterre, Semiotics of Poetry, 81. 16 Of course, we must be conscious of the fact that this late in Arabic literary history a mere mention may be enough to evoke the images of strength and endurance that are typi cally associated with the poet's mount. There is a significant difference, for instance, between the matter-of-fact allusion to a mount at the outset of this poem, and its pointed lack in al Shanfar?'s l?m?yah.</page><page sequence="7">246 SOME OF US MUST DEPART the way that Ibn Khaf?jah takes the characteristics of the traditional rahll as a point of departure for the theme he treats. The first six lines consist of a description of the narrator's solitary noc turnal journey lost in the desert during a violent storm. Most significantly, he is not in control of his own journey, for it is the desert winds that push him and the wastelands themselves that determine the direction of his travel. We learn in line 6 that the journey of life has not only been harsh and soli tary, but long as well, for the narrator dwells on the seemingly interminable night. Line 5, however, stands out as inconsistent with the theme of a desert night journey. Why would the poet laugh with "mouths of hope" during a solitary desert journey? The apparently misplaced line acts as an ungram maticality, that is, a distortion on the level of grammar or meaning that is inconsistent with the literary representation of reality in the text.17 The pres ence of the mouths of hope here indicate to the reader that, although mimet ically the subject of the poem is a desert journey, there simultaneously exists another level of meaning to the poem, one that can accommodate this prob lematic image. The mouths of hope in the faces of desires have no place in the inhospitable desert, but metonymically alluding to the beloveds of tran sient love affairs, they do have a place in the poet's life. If we read the jour ney as a metaphor for the narrator's own life, then, the apparent anomaly is cleared up. Note, however, the poet's use of the word ud?hlka in line 5 {wa l? unsa ill? an ud?hika s?catan/thugh?ra l-am?nl fi wuj?hi l-mat?libi) which is echoed somewhat sinisterly three lines later (line 8) in the word mud?hiki, referring to the wolf's teeth. Reading the journey as a metaphor for life, we can assume that the narrator feels himself to be close to death, for he is now traveling at night, a symbol for the end of life, and he sees the fates (i.e., death) lurking in the darkness. Lines 7 and 8 are particularly interesting, for here the narrator seems to relinquish the passive role he has taken so far. In line 7 he describes him self as trailing the black locks of the night so that he may embrace white bosoms (sahabtu d-day?jlfihi s?da dhaw?'lbinlli-a'taniqa l-?m?la bld? tar?'ibi). Ibn Khaf?jah has neatly combined two recurrent images from Arabic poetry, that of the night personified metonymically as a woman when it is equated with black locks, and that of the lovers (and this image also appears in Imru3 al-Qays, among others)18 trailing a mantle behind them to hide their 17 Riffaterre, Semiotics of Poetry, 2. 18 Line 28 of his mucallaqah reads: fa qumtu bih? amshl tajurru war?'an? cal? ithrin? adhy?la mirtin murahhal? Out I brought her, and as she stepped she trailed behind us to cover our footprints the skirt of an embroidered gown (Arberry, 62).</page><page sequence="8">SOME OF US MUST DEPART 247 footsteps in the sand, thus preventing them from being found and separated. We find, then, that this night, which heretofore has been presented as a time of interminable loneliness, is actually of the narrator's own making and hence one over which he can exercise some control. In line 8 he tears open the night's shirt to reveal the dawn. Unlike Imru3 al-Qays, who can only await the passing of the night whose stars seem to be tied to a mountain, their progress through the sky being so slow, and unlike Ta'abbata Sharran who in his l?mlyah on sleeping with a gh?l must wait for the morning to rip the night's cloak, our narrator is not at the mercy of natural forces, but brings on the arrival of the dawn himself.19 Here we have our first hint that Ibn Khaf?jah intends not to imitate the pre-Islamic masters, but to use their works as a point of departure from which to explore his own quite different ideas. In lines 8 and 9, the dawn is described as a glowering, gray wolf, the sunrise its flashing teeth. The metaphor suggests that although the night has been long and difficult, the narrator finds the approach of day to be no improvement, an idea already treated by Imru3 al-Qays in his mucallaqah.20 With line 10, the mountain is introduced, described as rising monumen tally above the desert, so huge that it blocks the wind and crowds the stars. Significantly, the mountain blocks the very winds that served as such a pow erful opening to the poem. The personification of the mountain begins with line 13: it has hair and a turban, a description which, as we have already mentioned, brings to mind Imru3 al-Qays's thablr, but in line 14, Ibn Kha f?jah's mountain, unlike that of his pre-Islamic predecessor, begins to speak. The mountain's speech, however, is a complex phenomenon. We have See line 47-48 of Imru5 al-Qays's mucallaqah: fa y? laka min laylin ka'anna nuj?mah? . . . bi-amr?si katt?nin il? summi jandal? What a night you are! It is as if the stars were tied with hemp ropes to solid rock (Arberry, 64). Ta'abbata Sharran says of the night: il? an had? al-subhu athn?'ah? wa-mazzaqa jilb?bahu al-alyal?

Equally important is the fact that here we are once again faced with an ungrammaticality, an apparent contradiction on the mimetic level of the poem which alerts us to the presence of a deeper signification. In this case, the ungrammaticality encourages the us to read the line within the con text of the pre-Islamic tradition of al-su'?l. As Jaroslav Stetkevych has noted, al-su'?l has a long and rich history in Arabic literature.21 The incessant questioning of the traces of an abandoned campsite expresses a yearning for the past and its lost loves. The question, then, is an existential one, concerned with the nature of time and human mortality. It is not difficult to see the connection between this questioning and that of elegiac Arabic poetry, also discussed by Stetkevych, in which the questioning of the dead is equally unanswered and unanswerable.22 Both are evoked in the words of Ibn Khaf?jah's speaking mountain who seems to answer the question about the ephemerality of human life with a de scription of the horrors of immortality. Also evoked is the line of the poet Mihy?r al-Daylami whom Ibn Khaf?jah himself counts as having a direct influence on his own work: wa qad yu?buka wahyan man tukh?tibuh? wa tafhamu l-qawla mimman l? turaj?uhu Though one you speak to may yet reveal the answer, And you may understand the speech of one you do not query.23 For the narrator of Ibn Khaf?jah's poem, though he has not asked a ques tion, is able to understand the mountain's speech. There appears to be a pro gression here, from the unknowable as expressed in the pre-Islamic su'?l to the suggestion of an answer in al-Daylami's line, to the actual speech of the mountain in Ibn Khaf?jah's poem. We will return to this point below. The contradiction inherent in the notion of a silent mountain speaking may also be resolved if we take the mountain's speech as the product of the narrator's own imagination, and not just the poet's.24 It is its contemplative form which suggests to the narrator the anthropomorphic thoughts and feel ings of the mountain. In other words, although the narrator casts this speech Well, now, you tedious night, won't you clear yourself off, and let dawn shine? Yet dawn, when it comes, is no way better than you (Arberry, 64). 21 Jaroslav Stetkevych, "Toward an Arabic Elegiac Lexicon: The Seven Words of the Nasib in Reorientations/Arabic and Persian Poetry, ed. Suzanne Pinckney Stetkevych (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1994), 58-129. 22 Ibid., 113-6. 23 Ibid., 112. 24 Nowaihi interprets the passage thus. See p. 167.</page><page sequence="10">SOME OF US MUST DEPART 249 as the words of another being (i.e., the mountain), they are really his own. The movement in the poem away from the helplessness described in the opening lines toward greater self control, which has already been sug gested by the narrator's trailing of the black locks of the night and ripping of the collar to reveal the dawn, has continued, for it is the narrator's own thoughts which result in his eventual change of outlook and regaining of some measure of control over events in the poem. Lines 15-22 present the mountain's story, how he has watched travelers come and go, offering them temporary refuge, but has always ended up mourning their death until the repeated bereavement has exhausted his sor row. In stark contrast with the narrator's newfound recognition of his abi lity to determine his own fate, the immobility, as well as immortality, of the mountain is emphasized here. Like the narrator who was buffeted by winds at the outset of the poem, the mountain is slapped by winds and crowded by the seas. In the final lines of the piece, the narrator finds solace in the mountain's words for he, unlike the mountain, is mortal. However, since the mountain's words are really a projection of the narrator's own thoughts, he has really comforted himself. In the last line of the poem, the narrator bids the mountain farewell and continues on his journey. His journey, we must assume, is still a solitary one through an inhospitable desert, but this time, he chooses to move rather than allowing the elemental forces of nature to move him, and he chooses the direction of his movement. Significantly, it is in this line that we find the first mention of a goal (tlyah). The journey is, after all, neither unend ing or directionless. The narrator has moved far beyond the state of con fused aimlessness that characterized the first few lines of the poem. Let us turn now from the diction and imagery of the poem to its struc ture. I mentioned earlier that the poem at hand takes the form of a rahll, that is the description of the perilous desert journey which makes up the second part of the classical Arabic qasldah. This is particularly signifi cant in that the general tendency in Arabic poetry after the advent of Islam was to reduce or even eliminate the rahll section of the qasldah.25 By insist ing on the rahll, then, Ibn Khaf?jah not only brings us back through yet another device to the pre-Islamic period when the rahll flourished, but, as we shall see shortly, he is able to use this manipulation of the very struc ture of the qasldah itself as a tool for effectively expressing a particular philosophical idea. The dominance of the rahll in Ibn Khaf?jah's poem begs comparison 25 See Renate Jacobi, "The Camel-Section of the Panegyrical Ode," Journal of Arabic Literature, 13 (1982): 1-22.</page><page sequence="11">250 SOME OF US MUST DEPART with al-Shanfar?'s l?mlyah, for the rahll also dominates the master ode of this pre-Islamic brigand poet. However, there is a central difference between the two; al-Shanfar? in his outcast state, constantly harks back to the so ciety which he has rejected. He decries its immorality and hypocrisy and boasts that he is better off without its benefits. Al-Shanfar? also finds another society among the wild animals he encounters to replace the human companionship he rejects. Ibn Khaf?jah, on the other hand, makes little mention of any social order that may exist outside the lines of his poem. Aside from the brief and rather cryptic reference in line 5 to "the mouths of hopes in the faces of desires" (thugh?ra al-am?nl fi wuj?hi al-mat?l?b?), a line which we will treat further below, and the terrifying encounter with the wolf, the narrator is utterly alone until he approaches the mountain. Indeed, the only other humans mentioned are the other travelers who have sought refuge by the mountain, and they, too, are, for the most part, soli tary figures: murderers, penitents, and night travelers, and the narrator never meets up with them himself. In her article "Structuralist Interpretation of Pre-Islamic Poetry: Critique and New Directions," Suzanne Stetkevych demonstrates that the rahll of the pre-Islamic qasldah corresponds to the liminal stage in a rite de passage, the second of three stages?separation, liminality, and reaggregatation that characterize any change in social status.26 Liminal moments are charac terized by antisocial behavior?the breaking of taboos and leveling or in verting of hierarchies. Individuals in a liminal state may be outcast from society, either physically or metaphorically; they are wild, dangerous, alone, and in temporary communion with nature. The rahll section of the classical Arabic qasldah is typically followed by a fakhr or madlh section which rep resents the initiate's r?int?gration into society. The rahll of the classical tri partite Arabic qasldah, then, reflects one stage in a pre-Islamic man's life, a time of temporary separation from society. Suzanne Stetkevych has fur ther shown that in his l?mlyah, al-Shanfar? extends this notion of separation to depict a permanent, rather than temporary, withdrawal from society, for this ode does not end with a culturally reaffirming madlh or fakhrP Rather, the narrator of the work remains isolated from human society. Ibn Khaf? jah's rahll takes al-Shanfar?'s extension of the notion of separation from society in the pre-Islamic rahll to an even further extreme, representing it, not only as a wild, solitary journey fraught with danger, but also as the only journey which he can take. Ibn Khaf?jah's narrator has not left society 26 Journal of Near Eastern Studies 42 (1983): 85-108. 27 Suzanne Pinckney Stetkevych, "Archetype and Attribution in Early Arabic Poetry," International Journal of Middle Eastern Studies, 18:4 (1986) 361-90 and eadem, The Mute Immortals Speak, 87-118.</page><page sequence="12">SOME OF US MUST DEPART 251 either temporarily or permanently; in the world of his poem, there is no society for him to leave. If, as we are arguing, Ibn Khaf?jah is casting his entire life as a rahll, a wild and lonely desert journey, then it is a particularly grim one, for unlike that of his pre-Islamic counterparts, his is no test of endurance or challenge to be met and then boasted of. Rather it is a painful, apparently interminable journey with no real aim. Note that in this journey the narrator has no clear destination; it is not until the last line of the poem that a goal is somewhat offhandedly mentioned, and there is no mamd?h to whom he travels to offer praise, nor audience for a closing fakhr.1* Nonetheless, there is a curiously optimistic note to the poem as well. Life is a solitary, directionless journey through an inhospitable landscape, but the modal movement within the poem from the passivity of the narrator to his taking active control over his environment suggests not a terror of the difficult journey that is life nor a fear of death, but an acceptance of responsibility for his own fate as well as a recognition of some measure of control over the course of his own life. If Ibn Khaf?jah presents life as a solitary rahll in this poem how, one might ask, does he treat death? Again, an examination of the pre-Islamic antecedents that are so clearly evoked by the poem can help us to answer the question. Several prominent pre-Islamic poems suggest that death be accepted because it is inevitable. In his mucallaqah, Tarafah accepts his death defiantly, saying that there is no point in shunning danger since death comes to everyone eventually.29 Ta'abbata Sharran, in a short poem rhyming in "cayn" goes even further, maintaining that for him, an early and violent 28 Suzanne Pinckney Stetkevych, personal communication. Moving outside the text at hand to a consideration of the political and social climate of the time in which Ibn Khaf?jah was writing, we can perhaps understand the source of so relentlessly negative a depiction of life. Ibn Khaf?jah lived during the T?'ifah and Almoravid periods of Andalusian history, periods marked first by political instability and the constant threat of invasion from Christians to the north and east of his home city of Valencia, and then by repression and intolerance which forced scholars to hide their beliefs. Christian occupation of Valencia forced Ibn Khaf?jah to spend some years in exile in North Africa. See Mahmoud Makki, "The Political History of al-Andalus (92/711-897/1492)" in The Legacy of Muslim Spain, ed., Salma Khadra Jayyusi (Leiden: EJ. Brill, 1994) 1:3-87. Many poets felt alienated from these rulers whom they did not respect and who, in any case, were not inclined to artistic patronage. Thus, Ibn Khaf?jah eschewed court life and lived almost exclusively on his country estate, perhaps following the course of action suggested by his contemporary, the philosopher Ibn B?jjah, that intellectuals in an unfavorable environment withdraw from society. I am indebted to James Monroe for pointing out to me the possible connection between Ibn Khaf?jah and Ibn B?jjah. 29 Several lines of his mu'allaqah treat death. Perhaps the one that most clearly conveys this sentiment is line 54: al? ayyuh?dh? al-Wim? ahdura al-wagh? wa-in ashhadu al-ladhdh?ti hal anta mukhlid?? So now then, you who revile me because I attend the wars and partake of all pleasures, can you keep me alive forever? (Arberry, 86).</page><page sequence="13">252 SOME OF US MUST DEPART death is inevitable.30 Labid, in the context of the related theme of departure rather than of death, speaks of forbearance. In the atl?l section that opens his mucallaqah, he cautions against over-attachment to those who have left and will not return: "Why question dumb eternal rocks that can tell us noth ing significant?"31 he asks, in reference to the traditional weeping over the remains of an abandoned campground. Irnru5 al-Qays offers a slightly dif ferent view in the storm scene of his mucallaqah. Here, too, death comes to everyone in its path?to the wild beasts from the mountains and the palm trees in the plain (symbols of civilization). However, the agent of death, the storm, is also the bearer of life, for it causes new vegetation to grow and attracts songbirds.32 For these poets, then, death must be borne bravely because it is inevi table. Indeed, it is the inevitability of death and the inability of man to alter his fate which is stressed in their works. Ibn Khaf?jah picks up this theme of inevitability. Death awaits Ibn Khaf?jah as it has awaited and finally overpowered all the other night travelers the mountain has known. He, how ever, does not leave it at that. The narrator finds comfort in the mountain's story because he realizes that his own situation as one who will pass away is preferable to that of the mountain who must remain in the world with only the temporary companionship of travelers to comfort him. Here death is accepted not because it is inevitable, but because it is preferable to eter nal life. Again, Ibn Khaf?jah has taken a concept from pre-Islamic poetry and pushed it to its logical extreme, thereby using the ancient imagery of his literary ancestors to express a philosophy distinct from theirs. I have presented the poem as a disembodied rahll and pointed out the ways in which Ibn Khaf?jah is able to exploit the traditional relationship of rahll to the two other sections of the classical qasldah to make a philo sophical point. But if this poem is indeed a rahll, it is a somewhat strange one, not only because of its apparent independence from a naslb or madlh section, but also because of the modal shifts that occur within the poem. How one might ask, can there be so much psychological movement, so much development of an idea within a rahll! After all, for all its physical movement, being a description of a journey, the rahll traditionally describes In line 9 he says, wa-inni wa-in cummirtu aclamu annanl sa'alq? sin?na al-mawti yubriqu aslac? However long I live, indeed I know that I will meet death's spearhead, glistening, bare.

And then, there are those troubling lines that seem more appropriate to a naslb than a rahll?the mouths of hope in the faces of desires which appear to have no place in the inhospitable desert through which the narrator is journeying, the white bosoms he seeks to embrace, and the black locks of the night which the narrator trails behind him. Within the rahll, then, we seem to have clear allusions to a naslb. For this llth/12th century poet, writing with the weight of six centuries of Arabic poetry behind him, allu sions are all that is needed to evoke the longing and recollection that tradi tionally characterizes the naslb. Jaroslav Stetkevych has addressed what he calls "the obliteration of a dis tinction between the naslb and the rahlF in another of Ibn Khaf?jah's poems.33 The blending of the two is possible, he says, because, as the sub jective parts of the tripartite qasldah, they share the same voice. This poem, however, is characterized not only by a blending of naslb into rahll, but by the introduction into the rahll of a full tripartite structure.34 In other words, like a poem within a poem, an entire qasldah lives within the frame of Ibn Khaf?jah's rahll. The naslb diction which we have just described gives way in line 8 to a more purely rahll-likt mood, to a time of, and here I quote J. Stetkevych, "breaking away, of a desire to change, of the inevitability of change." Stetkevych describes the rahll further as "a medial zone between what is lost and what is not yet gained, or regained. In the ultimate conse quence of poetic vision, the rahll is the poet's self-view in a moment of cri sis?of his undoing and becoming."35 In this line, in which the narrator tears the collar of the night to reveal the wolf, we have a clear modal shift, a transitional one preceding the new psychological state which the narrator will enter as a result of his encounter with the mountain. Significantly, it is in this line that we find an allusion to that liminal character, the grey wolf, and it is in the mountain's speech that we find references to other liminal figures ?murderers, penitents, and night travelers. We have here, then, something of a rahll within a rahll. The new state that the narrator then enters after receiving solace from the mountain, and that enables him to resume his journey with greater equanimity, marks the third part of the poem (lines 24-26) and corresponds to the reaggregation section of the clas sical qasldah. 33 Jaroslav Stetkevych, Zephyrs of Najd, 131. 34 Jaroslav Stetkevych notes a similar tripartite structure to the pilgrimage poem of Ibn al-Farid which he analyzes. This poem, although cast in the diction of the naslb also exhibits a psychological movement similar in structure to that described here. Ibid., 79-102. 35 Ibid., 28-29.</page><page sequence="15">254 SOME OF US MUST DEPART In fact, there are two layers of tripartite structure to the poem, one exist ing on the literal plane of the journey and encounter with the mountain as it is mimetically represented in the poem, and the other on the psychologi cal plane of the narrator's state of mind. On the literal plane, the poem shifts from movement (the narrator's journey through the desert) to stasis (when the narrator listens to the mountain's story) to renewed movement when the narrator leaves the mountain to continue his journey. Ibn Khaf? jah's poem begins not with the usual wuq?fcal? al-atl?l (stopping before the ruins) but in the midst of a journey; the narrator is already lost and buffeted by winds. It ends, not with the narrator standing before the patron deliver ing his madlh, but with a resumption of the journey. In a qasldah structured within a rahll, reaggregation is to the journey rather than the community. This pattern from movement to stasis and back to movement is the exact opposite of that described by Jaroslav Stetkevych for the Arabic qasldah in which the poem shifts from the stasis of the naslb to the movement of the rahll and then returns to stasis in the final madlh section. It is, of course, entirely appropriate that a Bakhtinian reversal of the normal order of things should occur in a poem cast as a rahll which, in the classical qasldah, rep resents a liminal moment. At the center of that reversal and of the poem as a whole, we find the mountain's speech, which we have heretofore interpreted as an answer to the pre-Islamic poets' su'?l. As questioning by an inanimate object, rather than by the narrator of the poem, as a question concerning the state of im mortality rather than of mortality, and as an utterance which in itself serves as an answer to the traditional su'?l (albeit an answer phrased as a series of questions), the mountain's words are a formal reversal of the classical su'?l. Note, however, that the mountain's speech is also a series of questions, his own su'?l, not concerning mortality and the passage of time, but immortal ity and the passing away of companionship that must necessarily accompany it. Within the realm of content, too, then we have a reversal. On the psychological plane, however, Ibn Khaf?jah's mountain poem actually replicates rather than reverses the modal movement described by J. Stetkevych, for the poem opens with a description of the state of passiv ity and loneliness in the desolate landscape that characterizes the narrator's view of life. The stopping of the poet by the mountain side to watch the approaching dawn and hear the mountain's speech is marked by action: the narrator's rise from passivity to dispel his own despair. (Remember that we suggested above that the mountain's speech may be a second interior voice of the narrator.) Finally, the work ends with the narrator once again in a state, this time a state of consolation. By exploring the nature of the intertextuality that obtains between Ibn</page><page sequence="16">SOME OF US MUST DEPART 255 Khaf?jah's b?'lyah on the mountain and the works of his pre-Islamic pre decessors, and by remaining conscious of the ways in which that inter textuality can enrich our reading of the poem, we are able to highlight the special and the unusual in this work. We can see how the poet is able to mold new forms from old clay, to reuse familiar language in unfamiliar ways to create a truly literary work.
