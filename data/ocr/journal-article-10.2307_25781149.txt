<plain_text><page sequence="1">BECKETT, EARLY NEUROPSYCHOLOGY AND MEMORY LOSS: Beckett's Reading of Clarapede, Janet and Korsakoff Jean-Michel Rabate* convincingly argues for the presence of a complex argument about psychology in Murphy, particularly a struggle between the Gestalt and Wurzburg schools and the influences of Bion, Klein and Jung (Rabate 135-151). At one point, Rabate suggests that study of the specific cases of schizophrenia known by Beckett would be of intense interest in furthering understanding of Beckett's work (148). Interesting work has been done by both Francis Doherty and Michel Beausang on aphasia in Beckett's Watt. The fascinating relations between Beckett and Bion are being rigorously followed up in many quarters. This paper hopes to contribute to this branch of Beckett studies by demonstrating close analogues in early neuropsychological case studies, and by going some way toward explaining why psychology was of such interest to Beckett. Beckett's work may fitfully be described as madly combining insanely formal prose energies with elegies for broken voices, broken minds. It seems Beckett discovered in Murphy's Mercy seat, with its crowd of thoroughly modern madmen and women, a hunger for companionable stories that could be assuaged by psychologists' case studies; less a philosophy of mind than a psychology of near mindlessness. Two broken strands come out of his investigations. Firstly, that if somehow you lose your memory, you lose the world of representation. The first section of my paper on the Korsakoff syndrome and Clarapede will cover this. Secondly, Beckett found that the trauma of one unbearable memory can run and ruin your mind for you. The second section will look at one of Janet's case studies as the key source for Footfalls. With both discoveries, Beckett was finding his way towards a working-together of literary and neuropsychological concerns, not in any easy Freudian or Jungian perspective, or with any eye towards a geriatric metalanguage, but reading case studies as stories that help define relations between story-telling as such and terrifying failures in ordinary memory-work. I will not be trying to diagnose the particular mental disorders of Beckett's characters ? but showing the way Beckett creates a composite madness out of many different kinds of case-study stories: unnamable fabling and a madman's confabulation, both seek the last resort of fable out of the twin hells of absolute amnesia and pathological hypermnesia. One of Murphy's patients is a Korsakoff: "A hypomanic teaching slosh to a Korsakow's syndrome" (Murphy 96). 'Slosh' is a bad joke</page><page sequence="2">for the Korsakoff patient since it can mean 'weak and watery drink' and the syndrome is famously brought on by chronic alcoholism. Like most of the patients observed by Murphy, their symptoms resonate throughout Beckett's work. Korsakoff s syndrome was analyzed by Carl Wernicke and S.S. Korsakoff in the 1880s. Wernicke had three patients with a neurological syndrome that included severe gait disorder (one thinks of Watt), psychological confusion (where is this not true in Beckett), and opthalmoplegia or abnormal eye movements (the "fitful" perceiving of The Unnamable 270). This confusional stage was observed by Korsakoff to develop into a syndrome with powerful amnesic symptoms in long-term alcoholism, accompanied by intestinal obstruction (Malone and his stool, Heidel, Salmon, and Butters 227-28; henceforth HSB). The Korsakoff syndrome was brought on not only by long-term alcoholism, but by serious front-lobe lesion. Both these causes haunt the backward minds of Beckett's people: alcoholism not only with Krapp, Mercier, and Camier, but the little indication in the medical report to the Unnamable: "does he drink, good God yes, passionately" (354); Malone wonders if he had been "stunned by a blow," living in "a kind of coma," talks about his vague recollections of Molloy (The Beckett Trilogy 169). *** The Korsakoff patient, when "left to his own devices," is likely to remain "in bed for long periods of time" (HSB 229). He or she has a strong tendency to confabulate: "When asked to recall his activities of the previous day, an alcoholic Korsakoff patient may 'fill in' a gap in his memory with a story" (HSB 229). 'Confabulation,' as defined by Collins dictionary, fills "the gaps left by a disorder of the memory with imaginary remembered experiences consistently believed to be true." Imaginary remembered experiences: the Korsakoff patient's desperate ontological manoeuvre and the author's burden and duty. Both are found in the Unnamable's struggle with the memory, self, stories, voices possessing him, stories possessing him, crying out against the imaginary remembered experiences that take over the novel's voice: The place, I'll make it all the same, I'll make it in my head, I'll draw it out of my memory, I'll gather it all about me, I'll make myself a head, I'll make myself a memory (...) the memory is so bad, the words don't come, the words fail. (179) the resorts of fable (...) It was [Mahood] told me stories about me, lived in my stead, issued forth from me, came back to me, entered 42</page><page sequence="3">back into me, heaped stories upon my head (...) his voice continued to testify for me, as though woven into mine, preventing me from saying who I was. (283) Those fundamental contradictions, "make myself a memory" versus "the memory is so bad," "stories about me" versus "voice (...) woven into mine," are the Korsakoff patient's peculiar hell, an amnesic's sick sense of his own confabulation, felt to be so close to the writer's panic at the fabling power of words. "The Korsakoff patient's attempted recall of prose passages is often characterised by the intrusion of episodes, objects, and individuals not included in the original story. Such extra-story intrusion errors may be confabulations provoked by the recall demands of the task and the patient's faulty memory" (HSB 230). Korsakoff patients' own stories, then, break down, allowing panicky confabulations to inhabit their voices, all under the intense pressure of the psychologists' listening attention, strangely neutral, horribly demanding (note the cold tone of "recall demands of the task" in HSB's account). The Unnamable's story breaks down in this way, voice under pressure from the "them," at one point referred to as "specialists," close to the "medical advisors" of Watt: uick now and try again, with the words that remain, try what, I on't know, I've forgotten, it doesn't matter, I never knew, to have them carry me into my story, the words that remain, my old story, which I've forgotten. (381) This extra-story intrusion acknowledges Korsakoff-style amnesia whilst sustaining the illusion of the original representational force of confabulation ("my old story"); once again Beckett is feeling the force-field of comparison between broken minds and broken writing. Korsakoff memory disorders accord with the general predicament of the Beckett voices, entailing impairments in episodic memory, with relatively well-functioning short-term memories, and semantic memories that, though usually undamaged, are "totally independent of contextual clues for their retrieval." This means that Korsakoff patients have bad amnesia for all memories of events in their lives prior to and subsequent to cause (alcohol abuse or lesion), but do remember things fractionally before the present moment; and that they "do not forget the meaning of words, the rules of syntax, or basic arithmetical skills" (HSB 230-31). Impaired episodic memory is the paradigm ruling the Unnamable's anger at the stories heaped on his head, all the "ostensibly independent testimony in support of my historical existence" (292), the "old thoughts...visions, shreds of old visions" (373). The amnesia is clear: 43</page><page sequence="4">"no hope of anything, no knowledge of anything, with no memory of anything, no history and no prospects" (358), whilst the short-term memory coupled with a working but random semantic memory is demonstrated in the ferocious self-corrections, shreds and patches of general knowledge, the continual self-contradictions, the accelerating anarchy of "the meaning of words, the rules of syntax." The Unnamable is caught in a situation that with paranoid intent comes to resemble the madness of the damaged brain.1 The "them" are suspiciously like neurologists practising word- and memory-games on their witless patient. This description, for instance, is an accurate representation of image and name lists used by researchers to test for semantic and short-term memory: all the words they showed me, there were columns of them, oh the strange glow all of a sudden, they were on lists, with images opposite, I must have forgotten them, I must have mixed them up, these nameless images I have, these imageless names, these windows I should perhaps rather call doors, at least by some other name, and this word man which is perhaps not the right one for the thing I see when I hear it. (375) With his "mad need to speak," the medical report and its "locomotor ataxy" and paralysis (354) ? normal terminal stage of the Korsakoff syndrome ? the specialists and lunatics (328, 282), the obligation to tell his story, invent, confabulate, acknowledge representations of his own forgotten memories, the Unnamable breaks down into a horrifying, broken parody of writer-doctor, written-madman, words on a page like words spilt by a brain-damaged voice. *** In 1911, the Swiss neuropsychologist Clarapede studied a Korsakoff patient whilst investigating the relations between recognition and the sense of self, the 'moiiteV For Clarapede, the Korsakoff syndrome was "un trouble pathologique de la fonction de connexion egocentrique" (87). His patient's symptoms are proof of this: Elle oublie (...) d'une minute a l'autre, ce gu'on lui dit, ou les 6v6nements qui se sont passes. (...) Ce qui m6rite de retenir ici notre attention, c est son impossibility d'evoquer volontairement ses souvenirs ricents, et lorsqu'ils ont it6 d'aventure 6voqu6s automatiquement, de les reconnaitre. Si on lui raconte une petite histoire, si on lui lit le fait divers d'un journal, trois minutes apris elle ne se souvient de rien, pas meme du fait qu'il lui a 6t6 lu quelque chose; on arrive cependant, par certaines questions, a susciter, d'une 44</page><page sequence="5">facon r^flexe, certains des details contenus dans ce fait divers (...) Mais une fois que ces details se sont retrouv6s dans sa conscience, elle ne les reconnait pas pour des souvenirs, elle croit que c'est quelque chose qui 'lui traverse l'esprit' par hasard, une id?e qu'elle a 'sans savoir pourquoi,' un produit de son imagination du moment, ou mdme un r?sultat de sa reflexion. (87) In losing their memories in the radical way described, Korsakoff patients are exiled outside the world of ordinary representations, i.e., a world mediated by memory, perception and language, into an imaginary world where representation strikes them as "some story heard long before, an instant in the life of another, ill-told, ill-heard, and more than half-forgotten" (Watt 71). Personal memories are dependent on recognition and recognition is dependent on a working sense of self-ness, i.e., the capacity to recognize a memory as 'mine.' Clarapfcde saw that the Korsakoff syndrome attacked the egocentric connections between representations and the self, though not necessarily impairing marginal connections between the representations themselves (86). Quand on examine la facon dont se comporte un de ces malades, on constate que tout se passe comme si les divers 6v6nements de la vie, quoique susceptibles de s'associer entre eux dans 1'esprit, 6taient cependant incapables de s'integrer a ce qui constitue le moi lui-meme. Le malade vit, et est conscient. Mais les images qu'il receuille au cours de cette vie, tout en p?n&amp;rant et se fixant plus ou moins dans sa memoire organique, y demeurent comme des corps Strangers, et lorsque d'aventure elles franchissent a nouveau le seuil de la conscience, elles n'evoquent pas cette moi'ite* capable d'en faire des 'souvenirs.' (86) Here, I believe, can be traced the beginnings of the concern held by Beckett and our culture generally about the fragility of the self and its little stock of personal effects; "another little story about me, about the life that might have been mine (...) the fable must be of another" (366). The Unnamable's nightmare, the loss of any sense of self, any power of recognizing representations as 'mine,' any faith in his language's relations to his broken mind, find part of their root matter in the patients studied by Clarapfcde in the 1910s, Korsakoff patients exiled outside the ordinary world of me and my own. Beckett contemplating the move into representation as such, prose fiction with its mock I and distant little creatures, felt the danger lurking there, dark in the damaged brain, memory become story, self another's voice. *** 45</page><page sequence="6">"The hysteric," Freud wrote, "suffers from reminiscence" (4).2 One of Janet's most celebrated case studies, the case of Irene, was a terrifying proof of this. He saw her at the age of 23, in an acute state of hysteria two years after her mother's death, suffering from sleepwalking crises and hallucinations. Her father was a drunkard, her mother had been psychotic and had caught tuberculosis when Irene was 20. Irene from then on had had to look after her mother and suffer her mad and cruel demands. She went sixty nights with next to no sleep, in constant care for her mother and having to live through ugly, drunken scenes with her father. On 7 July 1900, her mother died after last days described by Janet as "6pouvantablement dramatiques" (1911:509). When Janet began seeing her in early 1901, he witnessed a mind broken in two in the most fearful way. Ir&amp;ne, in waking state, had no recollection of her mother's death; worse, she refused to acknowledge it had even happened. She had near absolute amnesia not only of the death but of all the events surrounding it up to her admittance to hospital. But at night she would enter into her terrifying sleepwalking, and live out an intense enacted hypermnesia of the tragic night. She would, in these hallucinatory states, relive the events of that night, both acting them out, and telling the story.3 During these dramas, she would also speak in her mother's voice: "Ir&amp;ne, ma fille, il vaut mieux que tu meurs, la vie ne fait que commencer pour toi et tu en as d6$ trop vu. "(1911:511) She also suffered auditory and visual hallucinations of her mother's face and voice urging her to suicide, and could recall many memories of the lost two months unknown to her waking self. The sleepwalking, story-telling reenactments would last four hours, four hours of automatic repetition of the motions of that night (1911:205-13). This double personality, at once suffering acute retrograde amnesia and somnambulist hypermnesia, led Janet to construct a theory of the narrative nature of memory, memory as 'fabulation': "La fabulation est le stade de la memoire developpee par elle-meme' (1928:292). There are many analogues between Beckett's Footfalls and Janet's Ir&amp;ne case study. The deep sleep, the sleep-walking, the hearing of the mother's voice are clear. The fact Irfcne is tending to her mother whilst she dies during the reenactment appears as a strong element in Beckett's play with the straightening of the pillows, the dressing of the sores, the sponging her down, etc. The story-telling nature of Irene's 'crise de reminiscence' is picked up by the third person dear-reader style: "Tells how it was."4 Amy's vision of her mother as a ghost ("a pale shade of grey") recalls Irene under hypnosis, beginning to see her mother: "Je vois son ombre, je vois ce qu'elle faisait, quand elle devenait m?chante 46</page><page sequence="7">avec moi, mais je ne la vois pas bien, il faut encore que je lui compose une tete." (1911:523).5 Amy's "I was not there," that tacitly alludes to her double personality and split self, recalls a moment when, under hypnosis again, Irfcne recalled her mother's funeral: "J'ai pourtant suivi a peu pr&amp;s comme tout le monde, mais je n'y ?tais pas" (1911:525). The repeated motif in Beckett's play, "will you never have done," gains a sinister edge when set beside Irene's mother's urging her to end it all. Above all, the terrifying extreme of Irene's fabulation, the drama of deadly reenactment, of pathological memory possessing the body and mind of the traumatized hysteric, at the mercy of the hypermnesia of the mother's death, returning again and again each night, like in a nightmare private theatre, to force Irkne to act it all out again, to tell the story all over again ? this terrible story of Janet's haunts Beckett's haunted stage. And it goes some way toward giving us clues as to Beckett's feeling about the drama, about dramatic enactment and the fabling imagination at the back of the dramatist's tormented mind. Irfene caught in the madness of her split mind, a mind incapable of recognizing her memories as her own during the day, and forced to reproduce those same memories at night, is a figure lying at the heart of Beckett's writing. Writing itself splits the mind in two, denying personal memory, forcing the acceptance of fabulous tales. Beckett's writing remembers Irkne, remembers human madness, its power and narrative and broken memory. Adam Piette NOTES 1.
