<plain_text><page sequence="1">51 BABA PYGMY HUNTING RITUALS IN SOUTHERN CAMEROON HOW TO WALK SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE ELEPHANT DAOU V. JOIRIS RESUME Comme en de nombreuses sociétés d'Afrique Centrale, les Pygmées Baka pratiquent des rites de chasse qui prennent place avant, pendant et après l'activité cynégétique. Les rituels associés à la grande chasse à la sagaie ou au fusil sont particulièrement complexes, l'éléphant correspondant, dans la pensée Baka, au paradigme du gibier. "Comment marcher à côté des éléphants" propose une approche comparative intra-culturelle d'un corpus de rites qui se complètent ou se répètent au cours d'un même cycle cérémoniel. L'auteur décrit l'encadrement rituel de la chasse dans deux sous-aires culturelles Baka, d'une part dans des campements établis à proximité d'agriculteurs sur brûlis Bangando/Mbomam et dans des campements en contact avec des essarteurs Kwele/Konabembe, d'autre part. Malgré la grande diversité et la forte fluidité des pratiques, et quelles que soient les cérémonies réalisées, les constantes ont été dégagées pour finalement rendre compte d'éléments qui s'articulent en un système rituel complexe. Introduction Game spirits - spirits of the deceased When it was first explained to me, in hushed voices, that wild animals were accompanied in the forest by spirit families of the deceased, behaving like Haousa herdsmen with their zebus, I started to understand something about the Baka hunting rites which I had the opportunity to observe for a number of years.1 It was to these forest powers of human origin (and thus associated with the ecosystem) that hunting rites with their magnificient yodel songs were addressed. It was herein possible to recognize a well-known structure of hunting societies where tutelary spirits protect game while guiding the hunters towards it. It became possible meanwhile, to discover a wider dimension of a belief</page><page sequence="2">52 system in which the spirits of the deceased contributed to the endeavors of the living. Contrary to what has been written about the Aka pygmies of the Central African Republic (Bahuchet, 1985) and those of the Popular Republic of the Congo (Demesse, 1978) or on the Ngbaka-Ma'bo also from the Central African Republic (Arom and Thomas, 1974), some of these entities were fairly well personified. This is so, to the extent that they were organized according to spirit lines, clearly differentiated among themselves, by the adhesion to a specific class (seven such classes have been identified so far), by a personal name other than that of the deceased, or by belonging to this latter's patrilinear clan (or emblematic group). Rather personal relations were knit between these game spirits and certain grand initiates, specifically, those who led the hunting ceremonies (among others). Thus, and without really raising the ancestor worship question, the ancestrality concept is clearly present in Baka philosophy. It seems that it is along these lines that hunting rites should be interpreted. In due course, while a ?èbùmà ceremony was in full swing with two dancers twisting and turning, an elderly Baka whispered to me, "the mě spirits have now arrived". I nodded in agreement even though I was unable to sense the presence of any spirits : no mask, nor trance, nor horn sounds. The ceremony had undoubtedly, however, reached its paroxysm. Feminine polyphonies and tambourines rhymed to the sound of the jingling of cattle-bells attached to the dancers' calves. Their music seemed to climb up into the high trees, as if at that very instant, a kind of balance was attained, between the worlds of men and the forest. This also took time to understand. I finally interpreted it by establishing a parallel between the extreme intensity sought after in collective ceremonies and a fundamental Baka notion: the balance of luck, identified by Boursier (1984) as well as by other scholars. It does not however correspond solely to a psychic, individual balance (seated in the forehead) but also to a relational balance between both the living (a ceremony can not take place after a dispute for example) as well as between the living and spirits of the deceased. Everything happened as if access to the forest depended on the songs and music, whose power to attract</page><page sequence="3">53 game is well-attested in hunting rites. Moreover, it seemed that the grand initiates who make contact with the game spirits through specialized technics, (e.g. divining, mediumnistic^ or orneiric) can not really achieve their ends unless they are indirectly supported by the adhesion of the entire community during these musical performances. Images of these anthropomorphic dwarfs dressed in traditional loin-cloths, bearing hunting charms and elephant spears came back to me. They walk next to the elephants. It is for those spirits that these songs are destined and who will be followed by the initiates- hunters when they leave for the deep forest. Thus, while the hunters' savoir-faire (which entails handling weapons and understanding ethno-zoology) is indispensable to the hunt's success, intellectual strategies of the control of nature (Descola, 1986) applied in hunting rites are no less determinant. As in most other hunting societies, Baka pygmies have developed rites which amplify hunters' capacities and attract game toward them. The present article will accordingly focus on the complex ritual Baka system which gives rise to many types of ceremonies, whose remarkable variability is manifested from one region to another and even from one camp to another.3 Baka pygmies from southern Cameroon (Province de Г Est ) constitute a linguistic and cultural entity which distinguishes itself from other Pygmy ethnic groups in western parts of the Congo basin. They speak an Ubangian language (of the Niger-Congo family) whereas the Gyeli from south-west Cameroon speak a A80 Bantu language, Bongo from Gabon а В 70 bantu language while the Aka from the Central African Republic and the Popular Republic of Congo employ a CIO bantu language. Baka pygmy cultural, economic and social patterns do nonetheless resemble those of the Aka pygmies with whom they share common origins as attested to by recent ethno-linguistic research (Bahuchet, 1989).The Baka population totals between 30,000 and 40,000 persons according to approximative surveys (Ndii,1968 ; Око Mengue, 1977) and is settled near non-pygmy families with whom the pygmies keep up old economic and ritual relationships during a process of sedentarization commenced in the 1950s (Althabe, 1965). Ranging anywhere from thirty to one hundred people on the average (Althabe, op. cit.; Vallois and Marquer, 1976 ; as well as the author's own observations), their permanent camps</page><page sequence="4">54 are located close to trails in the vicinity of, according to the regions, villages inhabited principally by the Nzime and Konabembe in the north of the Baka area, the Mbomam and Bangando in the east and the Kwele in the far south near the Congolese border. Available published works on the Baka up to now have been devoted most notably to Pygmy groups in contact with the Nzime (Dodd, 1979, 1980, 1986; Brisson and Boursier, 1979; Brisson, 1981-4, 1988), the Bangando (Higgens, unpublished, 1981; Althabe; Vallois and Marquer; Brisson and Boursier; Boursier, 1984). I have conducted investigations in camps having contacts with the Kwele, the Konabembe, the Bangando and the Mbomam. Method The hunting rites which will be emphasized here are those which surround the great hunt - spear hunts which imply covering long distances in the forest, looking for, most notably, elephant. Even though these ceremonies are not specifically devoted to this pachyderm, they make frequent reference to it. The symbolism associated with, as the Baka say, this really enormous beast is of such wealth that the elephant appears as the paradigm of all game in their thinking.^ This type of rite has already been the object of numerous studies in pygmy societies: the Aka of the Central African Republic (Bahuchet, 1985; Bahuchet et Thomas, 1987; etc.), the Aka-Mbènzèlè in the Popular Republic of the Congo (Demesse, op.cit.) and the Zairian Mbuti (Shebesta, 1952; Turnbull, 1965; etc.). Literature on the Baka also touches on this question. (See for example Brisson and Boursier,1979; Boursier, 1985; Dodd, 1979, 1980; Dodd in Woodburn, 1982; Higgens, s.d.; Vallois and Marquer, 1976; Kilian-Hatz, 1989) but only in a secondary manner. The most enriching information can be found in collections of song-fables as well as in dictionaries. Bahuchet (1989) has discussed the relevant vocabulary in his comparative ethnolinguistic study of the Aka and Baka pygmies. This offers, from a lexical angle, a rather stimulating comparative perspective. The hunt and particularly the large game hunt is the object of an important ritual accompaniment before, during and after</page><page sequence="5">55 cynegetic activity. Hunting ceremonies are organised within the framework of ritual institutions of an informal nature which the Baka refer to as dances. These will be translated as ritual associations here. These latter, as will be seen futher on, are not solely of a cynegetic vocation. They correspond to groups of affiliates who share, to varying degrees, a specefic ritual patrimony (songs, dance steps, ritual substances) and who organize public ceremonies which non-affiliates may observer or sing in. These can be of three types: feminine, masculine or composed of both genders. From as young as 12-14 years old, the hopefuls who demonstrate singing and dancing aptitudes are integrated into the ritual association after an informal rite. (An application of ritual substances stimulates singing and dancing.) Those who manifest predispositions for the utilization of ritual substances or the interpretation of dreams for example undergo an apprenticeship at the end of which they become specialized ritual agents. The ethnographical elements presented here were observed between 1986 and 1991 in two Baka camps in the départements of Boumba-et-Ngoko (province de l'Est). The inhabitants of the first camp (Salapoumbe-Ndongo) settled on the Yokadouma- Moloundou axis (near the Bangando-Mbomam slash and burn agriculturalists). They prepare the hunt in the framework of ?àbàlè and yélì ritual associations. Members of the second camp (Bele) maintain close relations with the Kwele slasher-burner and fisher peoples, near the Congolese border. They prepare the hunt according to the same ?àbàlè ritual association but also according to those of ?èbùmà and Yenga Poto. The ceremonies observed in the Salapoumbe-Ndongo camp will be described in the first part of this article while the hunting rites in the Bele camp will be the subject of the second part. The presentation of ceremonies is divided into the three phases of which they are made up and which take place, first in the camp before the hunt, then in the forest during the beat and third, after the killing. The historic evolution of some of these practices will be considered. A comparative perspective with the pygmy ethnic</page><page sequence="6">56 group historically closest to the Baka, the Aka of the Central African Republic (principally Bahuchet, 1985, 1989) and their near neighbors the Aka-Mbenzele of the Popular Republic of the Congo (Demesse, 1978) will be introduced. Hunting ritual ethnography in the Salapoumbe-Ndongo camp In the Bangando land, preparatory rituals in both yélî and ?àbà 1 è ritual associations take place in different locations but at the same time. Main sequences of the female yélî ceremony before the hunt There are yélî initiates in most camps at the East of the Boumba river, particularly along the Yokabouma-Moloundou track, in the Bangando and Mbomam regions. However, it does not seem to have initiates at the West of the Boumba river, in the Kwele region or in the Konabembe land. The data for the following description was gathered in four yélî ceremonies. The first was witnessed in the Salapoumbe-Ngongo forest camp in 1987. The other three initiation ceremonies took place in 1989 in Dissassaoui, Ngola (in the Bangando land) and Mikel camps (in the Mbomam region). Translations of songs recorded during these ceremonies have provided invaluable insight into the workings of yélî ritual association. Most sequences in the hunt preparation ritual are quite similar in all four cases but can vary considerably depending on the personality of the ngàngà initiates leading the ceremony : "we have forgotten the old yélî songs, the initiates say, we all have our time, we each arrange the song each as we like". What follows is more a synthesis of the common phases than an account of a uniform ceremony. The Baka use the Bantu term ngàngà to refer to specialist initiates. The meaning of this word has evolved and it can designate different categories of people, both male and female : the ngàngà who have become witches (và.mbù) unwillingly</page><page sequence="7">57 following a poor use of ritual substances; the ngàngà who are willing witches^ and perform witchcraft for a long period of time; and the ngàngà who are real sorcerers because they are affiliated to và.mbù sorcerer ritual associations such as that of the son jo. The Baka say that ngàngà specialist initiates become và.mbù witches when they spill human blood instead of animal blood. Each ngàngà initiate has a patrimony of personal secrets. The most competent are called old initiates (dí-ngàngà) and the least experienced ones are small initiates (lè-ngàngà). The strongest ngàngà initiates from the entire Bangando- Mbomam region (a dozen mature or old women) officiate in the yélî ceremonies. They all have privileged relationships with yélî spirits who prolong their own category of initiates or members of their family in the hereafter : "I am a ngàngà, says the old A. from Ngola, m£ spirits give me strength to work in yél Î. My mother's spirit must be there, with the other ml spirits. If you guard spirits, it means you are very strong. It is only when I lost my first son (a young man called Yengo) that I started guarding ml spirits. One night, when some women where singing yélî, my son's spirit came to the center of the camp to dance. His name is Anani and he belongs to the male buffalo patrilinear clan (yè-mbok5) like my deceased son. He does not have a kùlàvë ritual translator, he just whistles. Nowadays, he gives guidance on game to two türaäo master-hunters: my husband and one of our sons, K.D. My husband is the chief of the master-hunters. To kill animals, men do not sleep (do not have sexual intercourse). They are ready for the struggle with elephants. Yes, this ml spirit could also guide a master-hunter who does not belong to the male buffalo patrilinear clan (the same as his). This spirit came because my husband and I were doing good things. He came out to help his father and younger brother..." According to the Baka, the good people or jó kò do not perform witchcraft and sorcery, which means that they slay animals, not people. The jókò people contribute to the success of the hunt which benefits the whole community. Although the và.mbù sorcerers also become tutelary mi spirit when they die, it is</page><page sequence="8">58 necessary to be good to be metamorphosed into spirits who guide and protect hunters. The forest morphology of the yé 1Î spirit is that of anthropomorphous dwarfs wearing very simple loin-cloths and carrying the short traditional elephant spear and hunting charms called s ìmbò. They are silent, unlike others who shout out cries in the forest. I did not have the opportunity to see the mask of this yélî spirit when it came to dance in the center of the camp: in Ngola he is said to have his head covered in macabo leaves with a raffia skirt attached to his belt. This costume is presumably worn only in that particular camp. Although the yélî spirits walk side by side with wild animals (mammals and birds), their purpose is to help the master-hunters by guiding them and protecting them in case of danger. The element undergoing metamorphosis is mostly the initiate's molili shadow, except in the cases of jèngì and jiabùlà spirits for which, as we will see, it seems to be their vision initiatory power, ndàmbù. Thus far, there is usually reference to shadow in the literature on the Baka. It nonetheless seems that the term "reflection" is more appropriate because molili corresponds to a miniature shadow residing in the eye, like the reflection of a person in the pupil of another. Dodd (in Woodburn, 1982; 195) defines it as " the light in... (the person's) eye ... perhaps best translated as his vitality or his essence ...). The ndàmbù initiatory power (litterally the sorcerer's point), on another hand, is located in a person's guts, or intestines. The dictionary (Brisson and Boursier, 1979) states that it is also a ritual substance which enables one to struggle against sorcerers. During the yélî ceremony, which lasts a week before the hunters depart, the ngàngà initiates spend a night in the forest. They perform divining rituals to locate game : The ngàngà gathers ritual substances (bark, leaves, etc.) and rubs them until her palms remain stuck together; the direction her hands take indicates the zone where one will find game (the other initiates repeat the</page><page sequence="9">59 same operation each in turn with her personal stock of ritual substances). A second ritual reinforces the first : the ngàngà burns young tree shoots. The direction of the smoke curve points to where the hunters should aim. The ngàngà initiates also lead the yélî 's polyphonic yodel to attract game. Some of these songs called ndãndõ refer to the first hunt as it is described in the t ìbo là song-fable which explains the origin of hunting power thanks to which ngàngà women initiates now work hand in hand with the m? spirits to locate and call to animals.6 The intiate's singing is compared to the ngòmbì musical instrument (a four-chord cithara-harp) which was used by the kõmbã creating God to attract wild animals. In part characterized by a moving nostalgy, these songs may invoke the name of a renowned master-hunter having passed away recently. "When the yélî initiates sing, spirits dance in the bush, side by side, or it is rather the spirits of several hunters who died some years ago who dance together. These me spirits stay in the bush and start dancing when they hear women who sing yell. They dance in the bush but we do not see them." The ngàngà initiate is the solist specialist of singing-forward ; now and again she utters short sentences which are covered by vocal polyphony : -ngombî from k6mb5, t ì Ъ5 1 à! -lye, you swing ! ' -t ì b3 1 à is the master of ng omb Î! -ngombî from kõmbS, eh! -Young one ! Come and shoot njàbò elephant with the spear ! (Dissassoui camp, 17-07-1989) The ngàngà initiates prepare other divining rituals which enable them to identify and designate the hunter who is to kill the game. To do this, they take a shoot from the 6òtungã tree** and tie leaves at the top of it. This stick is called mò jumã . However, they may sometimes use other types of ritual substances. The same yélî songs are resumed when the women return to the camp.</page><page sequence="10">60 The ngàngà main initiate precedes the other initiates with the mò jüma stick in her hands. One behind the other, the initiates walk round the camp and start dancing in circles in front of the hunters who are waiting for their return. One of the master-hunter steps forward and starts to dance (imitating a hunter who is stalking game). As he comes near the ngàngà initiate, he reaches for the mò jumã stick. 9 The ngàngà immediately starts to tremble. The master- hunter crushes the leaves attached to the stick whilst the ngàngà is thrown into convulsions and collapses on the ground : this is the signal to show that this master-hunter will kill the game. Apparently, this knot symbolizes the mó 1 î 1 î shadow of game. It should be emphasized that animals have a shadow just as humans do but when they die the spirits which come around are those of humans, they do not proceed from their own shadow. The master-hunter then performs a dance to express his joy (at the forthcoming killing) and mimes a hunting scene. He then sets aside the mò juma stick which nobody is permitted to touch and prepares to leave on the same or following day. The ngàngà performs a luck blessing on the hunters and their families (but not on her husband if he is the master-hunter) by crushing the mò lombi ritual substance (to make invisible) in soot and applying it to foreheads, along spines and, following the same axis, on stomachs (in the past, it was applied to the whole body). The state of luck or of grace is considered to be located in the forehead, or lìbànjò-. As we have seen, it is determined by the harmonious quality of relationships between people among themselves as well as between people and forest spirits. This state of grace is conditioned by the respect of behavioural, sexual and dietary taboos. In addition, everybody in the camp drinks the yélî pot liquor, a kind of hydromel which is said to be a powerful ritual substance used to facilitate the hunt. "When we talk about yélî, say the ngàngà, we talk about the ritual substance from the pot and the</page><page sequence="11">61 great memory left by an old woman after her death. It is only when this ritual substance is in the ye lì initiate's home that the women can call to the animals. The ritual substance can stay there for a long time, one year or two years. The yélî spirit stay in the bush, they are two different things." Main sequences in the ?àbà 1 è ceremony before the hunt The ?àbà 1 è ritual association, also called ngàngà^, has initiates in the Bangando and Kwele regions. Whilst the yé lì women were singing in the forest, an ?àbàlè dance (which involve initiates of both gender) was taking place in a small neighbouring camp where the hunters were preparing for the same beat. According to informants, this ceremony was identical in every respect to others I had observed. The mï spirits guarded by ?àbàlè initiates are generally called mo к ondi in the Kwele region and kosi in the Bandango region, but they belong to the same category and use fire-divining rituals. H These ms spirit families are the spirits of dead male and female initiates who used to make contact with me spirits through fire- divining and medium technics when alive. When such ritual personalities die, their molili shadow turns into an anthropomorphous spirit very similar to yélî and serves the same tutor purposes. On the other hand, when this spirit appears during healing ceremonies he is in the form of a mask made up of different fabrics and vegetable fibers. He wears a long raffia fiber skirt over a shorter one. His chest is completely covered up with a pagne and he keeps his arms folded on his torso. The ?àbàlè spirit shouts out fast, repetitive cries on the center of the camp and utters sounds (similar to the clacking of hollow nutshells) when he is out of sight of non-initiates. These masks often go out in couples. (See Drawing 1) : The initiates build a sacred enclosure with two entrances for them in the camp. Like the yélî spirits, the ?àbàlè spirits belong to the dead person's patrilinear emblematic group or clan (yè-) .</page><page sequence="12">62 Unlike the yélî ceremony which is mainly designed to prepare for the large game hunt, the ?àbàlè orngàngà divining technics are also used to locate small game, such as antelopes, and always involve the quest for the cause of evil (recurring illness, death, etc.). In the many rituals I have observed, two possible situations have occurred : either the ms spirits are masked and dance in the center where there is no fire and hand out healing ritual substances, or the mò k ondi spirits who are present but invisible and stay close to the ?àbàiè initiate who reads in the fire where he sees the molili shadow of other mòkòndì spirits. In ?àbàlè ceremony, these two possible situations are sometimes performed by the same ritual actors in very different performances. In the Bele local group, for instance, ?àbàlè dances are performed around the fire for a while, then the masks come out and dance without fire for a certain period. During the ritual preparation for the hunt, the ngàngà initiate dances around the fire and looks intently into the flames where he sees the mó 1 î 1 î of the forest people (i.e. animals, long-since dead ngàngà initiates, and even other spirits such as jiâbùlà, the spirit of dead master-hunters). His vision points to where game is located. This fire-divining technic is often supplemented by the reading of a civet skin. This latter technic was borrowed from the Bangando and the Kwele^. ¡n addition, civet-skin reading may give rise to medium sessions, without a ceremony and without fire : the ngàngà initiate uses a ritual substance to look into the civet skin and is thrown into convulsions. In May 1990, this ritual took place in day-time, in a deep-forest Bele camp : "Carrying a civet skin in his hand, the ngàngà suddenly starts to tremble all over and says he can see where the animals are. The people are still going about their business, they are calm, some of them are watching, some are not, everybody is listening. A few men are supporting the ngàngà up to prevent him from falling. Later the ngàngà will say that he has felt oppressed, as if he were being squeezed, when his eyes fell upon a spirit's eyes.</page><page sequence="13">63 A clairvoyance ritual substance lo kò is dropped into the ngàngà's eyes to enable him to have visions. The same kind of ritual substance is instilled to look into fire and to interpret dreams in which the ngàngà initiate and mě spirit also pass by. The word molili shadow, which has a Ubangi root meaning dream (Bahuchet, 1990: 459) alludes to the appearance of spirits in dreams. Interpreting these dreams requires the use of the same divining technique with 15 ко ritual substance (seeing the spirit's mó 1 î 1 î shadow, meeting their eyes). The ngàngà also swallows a ball of ndàmbù ritual substance which provokes convulsions when the game is nearby. For his part, as we have seen, the master-hunter has received ndàmbù vision power by initiation (this power being named after the ritual substance). During the hunt In the morning before the start of the hunt, the jiabùlà spirit (which is, as we have seen, the spirit of a dead master-hunter) shouts from the edge of the forest to announce that the beat will be fruitful. The hunters leave with an ?àbàlè initiate. They will sleep only when they find the place indicated by the yen initiate to the master-hunter. The master-hunter is guided and protected by ye lì spirits^, jiabùlà spirits (which only the hunters who have ndàmbù visionary powers can see) and ?àbàlè spirits (who, unlike the previous spirits do not appear in an anthropomorphous shape but manifest themselves directly to the ?àbàlè initiate when he performs his divining and medium rituals) which are said to aid the hunters' progress. Now and again, this ngàngà initiate uses ritual substances he has received from the yélî women to divine by palm-rubbing.</page><page sequence="14">64 The yéiî ritual substance serves the same purpose as that of the ndàmbù : it signals the nearness of a big animal by provoking trembling in the master-hunter. As soon as the elephant has been killed, jsng ì and jilbùlà spirit families who were walking by its side show themselves, especially when it is a tusk elephant (i.e. not a njàbò sacred elephant). First, jiabùlà spirit utters thundering tones similar to those of the male or cow-elephant that has just been slaughtered. Then, the eldest me of the jěng i spirits family gets close to the elephant's head. He belongs to the same clan (yè-) as the lineage chief (kõbõ) of the camp for which the master-hunter has led the hunt. The eldest jfngì spirit remains silent. The initiates build a sacred enclosure (njàngã) for him. The other spirits are also present but do not reveal themselves. After the hunt The master-hunter heads for the camp where the women are waiting whilst the other hunters build canopies and large meat smoking mats. The jiabùlà spirit goes before him, uttering cries. He is the first to impart the news that the elephant has been killed. When the master-hunter reaches the camp, he starts singing the female yélî ndãndõ-ngòmbí songl4 (which in the past used to be played by men on a notch flutes called mòb io). The women take up the master-hunter's song and set off with their baskets to carry the meat. When they get to the place where the elephant has been killed, they start singing the same yélî songs (jiabùlà spirit is said to hold the tusks for a while and then disappear). The women sing : -Where are the hunters ? -We must sing, we shall dance -We are liars. -We are cheats (the ngàngà makes fun of the men who do not believe in the yélî women's power). (Dissassoui camp, 17-07-89).</page><page sequence="15">65 During the first night, as the mats are heavy with meat and the crackling sound of the fires lit under them can be heard everywhere, an ?àbàlè spirit runs around the camp and utters cries which cause a yélî initiate to be thrown into convulsions. When the lineage chief divides up the carved meat, he gives pieces of meat to the ngàngà initiates who have been involved in the hunt. They will offer the meat to the y e 1 î, ?àbà 1 è and j eng ì spirits to thank them for their protection and assistance. For the yé 1 î spirits, the offering ( 1 ìkàbò )15 thrown in the bush consists of raw pieces: heart fat, heart and ribsl6, for the ?àbàls spirits, it consists of cooked, sometimes seasoned and salted, ribs and heart pieces and for the jëngi spirits, cooked but unseasoned ribs and heart pieces, jiâbùlà excepted (this spirit does not eat like the others ), the me spirits are sometimes offered dàndù honey, for which they have a marked preference. The spirit's food may vary slightly from one camp to the next but it seems to be generally the same. Compared approach of hunting rituals in Bele and Mbondo camps Let us now turn to the hunt preparations in another sub- cultural area. There are no yélî ritual associations in the Kwele land. Informants say they are not initiated to the pot ritual substance which reinforces the attraction effect of the yodel songs and produce powers enabling the initiates to locate and attract animals. 17 Bele initates on the other hand do sing the yenga poto yélî and Mbondo women, who live ten kilometers away, sing ?èbùmà yélî. Just as in the Bangando land, the ?àbà 1 è ceremony takes place at the same time as yenga poto or èbùmà songs. The treatment of game in the Yenga Poto framework A recent association, yenga poto has followers only in some camps in the Kwele area. The ngàngà women who founded it was the old Amendi who belonged to the cow-elephant patrilinear</page><page sequence="16">66 clan (ye- ) and had passed three spirits (a female spirit who belonged to the same ye- and was called Yenga Poto and both her sons, Ndewe and Luna). The old Amendi used to preside over ceremonies which involved neither fire nor civet skin reading, but during which ritual substances were distributed. In the forest, the Yenga Poto spirit keep all sorts of wild animals such as antelopes, potamochoerus and elephants. The ngàngà who guards these spirits offers them a piece of the game's heart so that, as she says "the ms who has helped us to find meat (game) may give us the opportunity to kill again". If yenga poto spirits are very much like yélî spirits in the forest, in the camp their masks are much more like those of the mòkòndì spirits although they do not make sounds, their skirts are shorter and they dance backwards, bending forwards. On their legs they wear trousers and on their feet, a piece of cloth or banana leaves. I have not had the opportunity of witnessing a divining ritual for the hunt but this information reveals a close relationship between Yenga Poto spirits and game, similar to that of yélî and ?àbàiè spirits. In addition, the medium session with a civet skin that has been described above and was performed by an ?àbàlè initiate in a deep forest camp, took place after the initiate had taken a ritual substance given him by the guardian of a Yenga Poto spirit. Asked about the way people used to prepare for the hunt, the ngàngà initiate say that, like themselves, their mothers were not initiated to the Baka from Bangando 's yélî : "When there were no ngàngà who could see in the camp (who were powerful enough), who knew the way (to the game), the master- hunter simply asked his wife to make him some lucky ritual substances and one or two others. The master-hunter said himself where the beat was to take place." There is obviously a different procedure in the Kwele and the Bangando land. The Yenga Poto women's knowledge is</page><page sequence="17">67 presumably less powerful than the medium and divining ?àbàlè technics which are used in parallel. Yenga Poto being a recent ritual association, it is likely that ?àbàiè or an older version of it used to obtain. Informants say that the hunt used to be prepared within the framework of various ritual associations : 1)- mbõmbã ritual association which was progressively replaced by ?àbàlè 2)- ngàngà dance (the Baka from the Bangando regions still remember this association too), 3)-?èbùmà dance, such as it is still performed by the inhabitants of the Mbondo hamlet next to Bele. Let us look into the mbõmbã ritual association and how the Baka from Bangando and Kwele land came to prefer first ngàngà and then ?àbàlè ceremonies. ThembõnbS dance and its replacement by ngàngà and ?àbà 1 è In bygone times, as they say in Bele, only men prepared the hunt in the mbõmbã dance. Women sang and men danced to the rhythm of sticks struck against a piece of wood, not drums. The ngàngà wore a mo к puke, a feather head-dress. He fluttered 1 igbsgbe, the divining rattle and looked into the fire. He was thrown into a trance when his eyes met a spirit 's and he then collapsed to the ground. The position he fell to indicated the direction of game^. Within this ritual association the spirits were called á là and did not have masks (they did not come to the camp to dance). Nor did they eat anything special. In the Bangando land on the other hand, it seems this dance made use only of the divining rattle : "Originally, s es ê (original diviner and sister to the creating entity kõmbã) danced ngàngà with ligbsgbe (rattle) and gave the wanted information after hearing the sound of ligbšgbš. The elders say they learned fire-reading from the Kaka (villagers). .."19 It appears that it was around 1960 that the old category of a 1 à spirits changed its name to become mò k ondi spirits, the divining ritual which involved them undergoing changes at the same time^O. The ngàngà who introduced mòkòndì spirits in the Kwele</page><page sequence="18">68 and Bangando land came from the Konabembe and Nzime land from around Djoum or Abong-Mbang according to informants). They initiated some people who in turn spread ?àbà 1 è from camp to camp. The dance traveled from North to South, crossed the Boumba river and reached the Bangando land. The mòkòndì mask they wear nowadays seems to be identical to what is worn in the Konabembe land. This is how informants from Welele-Salapoumbe (Bangando land) describe the introduction of mòkòndì dance : "The ngàngà from Djoum-Abong-Mbang who brought mòkòndì to Welele-Salapoumbe initiated many people since nobody knew the dance before he arrived. He organized the ceremony every night and a móngü lu (dwelling-place) was built with two entrances. Four ngàngà initiates from Ngato Ancien (Konabembe area) were also present. The mòkòndì he brought was from the ? è s ì lo patrilinear clan and his name was gbanjàmbù (pack of n jàmbù ritual substances). An initiate translated what he said when he was hungry. People sang a lot. Later, when the mbõmba dance was replaced by ngàngà ritual association, the kò se spirit appeared and danced on the camp center. This spirit is the same as mòkòndì ; kò sê replaces aí à. The spirit is the same but the name is different and one wears a mask and the other one does not. But these mï are not the same as the yélî spirits". At that time, it appears that the hunt was prepared in two parallel ceremonies, which is practically what occurs in the Bangando land. "At the ala time (when there were ai à Spirits), yél"i already existed, say the informants, men danced the mbõmbã dance and women sang yélî all night long. The hunters and the ngàngà initiates got going. They performed their magic. The ngàngà rubbed the ritual substances into his hands to see where the game was". yélî has been known for many generations. The initiates, whose great grand-mothers already knew yélî, say that yélî initiates borrowed the pot ritual substance from the dance they</page><page sequence="19">69 call ngàngà but which corresponds to the description of the mbõmbã fire-divining dance. M. says : "When I was a little girl, I saw the ngàngà Aduamani. He was ye- vala and lived with his family in Yenga (Bangando land). He located and called out to the animals, it always worked. He brewed the ábàng5m5 ritual substance (tree-bark, honey and buffalo excrement in a pot) Everybody drank it. My father was initiated and carried on this ngàngà (continued to exert this power) after Aduamani's death. My mother included this ritual substance in the yélî and I took it up too. It is him, my father, who gave me this ngàngà (this power)." The divining and medium techniques used during these ceremonies have obviously changed in the span of three or four generations. Chronologically speaking, it seems we can roughly agree that ligbëgbë rattle-divining is the oldest, fire-divining was appended to it and civet skin divining was eventually adopted. These techniques are often coupled, rattle and fire-divining go together (such as in the mbõmbã dance, above), fire with civet skin- divining (such as in ?àbàlè dance). As far as the hand-rubbing and the smoke direction divining techniques are concerned we know that they are at least as old as the mbõmbã dance and the á là spirits. They are still used today in the yélî, ?àbà 1 è and ?èbùmà ceremonies with which we will conclude. 7èbùmà Dance ?èbùmà is a very widespread ritual association, with initiates in each of the designated sub-cultural areas. The Baka from Bele (in the Kwele land) say that it came from Ngato Ancien (in the Konabembe land), was adopted in Gribi (also in Konabembe) as well as along the Lomié track (in the Nzime land) and spread into the Congo after having been adopted in the Cameroon part of the Kwele land. This dance is often used to celebrate mourning^l. It has initiates in the Bangando and Mbomam land but ?àbàiè ritual association is generally preferred there in ritual preparation for the hunt. Other informants say they gave up ?èbùmà dance when yélî ritual association was adopted</page><page sequence="20">70 The ?èbùmà ceremony is public. Fire-divining does not take place in it 22# д female spirits guardian leads the women's chorus while her marital partner, who guards the same spirits, dances. Several couples of initiates take over from one another and two or three men dance at the same time. They wear a magistrate-ape skin skirt with bells attached to their calves . This costume is indicated by the spirit. It has been changed four times since ?èbùmà dance was brought to Mbondo. (See Drawing 2 : ?èbùmà Dancer, and Details of the Bells ). At death, ?èbùmà dancers become ?èbùmà spirits They present the same characteristics as others categories of spirits except for the backwards and forwards motion in their walk. As the ?àbàl! and yenga poto spirits, they not only point to large game but also to small game, honey and yams The offerings which they are presented with are the heart and ribs of the game. They do not come out as masks, although they used to come and join in the dance, by day, alongside the initiates. Their sacred enclosure is built on the camp ground. This is where the Baka are initiated. It has two entrances like the ?àbàlè sacred enclosure. The inhabitants of the Mbondo camp (of the mombito patrilinear clan) used to guard a spirits family belonging to the same clan and made up of a couple and their son : the mother's name is Kati {downstream side of a river); the father's name is Mola n da (millepede). Their son is called Akpomoe (someone who refuses mouths). These spirits suggest ritual substances to "?èbùmà mothers" in their dreams. Among these ritual substances designed to improve the singing, dancing and hunt preparation is ndàmbù. The ritual substances are mixed with soot and "vaccinated" onto the glottis and loins so that "the singers' voices, the drums and the bells to be as one". The significance of ?èbùmà dancers is probably due to the fact that if they dance well and are in perfect harmony with the singers and drum players, all cynegetic activities will be successful. The songs and dances act as ritual powers. The quest for balance or harmony, which has been</page><page sequence="21">71 mentioned already in relation to the lucky ritual substance in ye 1 Î, is central to the Baka philosophy. In order to locate game, ?èbùmà women use the palm-rubbing divining technique and the drinking of the njàmbù liquid which enables them to perform the ?èbùmà yéiî to attract animals. Lastly, unlike yélî initiates who only designate the master-hunter with their mò jüma stick, ?èbùmà women prepare small packs of bark powder called тэкэ бака and hand them in to all the hunters who tie them to their hunt charms. Despite the many differences between yélî, ?àbàlè and ?èbùmà performances, the song and hunt ritual substances used in all three ceremonies are said to be identical. Although they prepare it differently, initiates say that the njàmbù liquid made by ?àbàlè and ?èbùmà initiates (which stimulates singing and excites dancers and hunters) amounts to precisely the same as yélî pot-medicine. Conclusion The analysis of the hunting rites discussed above highlights the importance of collective music in relations between the Baka and game as well as with spirits of the deceased. Even though numerous aspects remain to be clarified, the cultural puzzel is gradually taking form and a symbolic system is coming to be identified. It has been clearly demonstrated that the Baka process of metamorphosis concerns very specific initiates (and the members of their families) more than social actors taken randomly. Thus, at the time of death, the yé 1 î, ?àbà 1 è,?èbùmà, yenga poto, j eng ì and jiàbùlà ritual association initiates are transformed into spirits belonging to distinct spirit classes. Game spirits are indeed to be of human origin and are not animal spirits. The latter do have a molí lì shadow similar to that of humans and this shadow enables the diviner to locate the game. These game spirits are generally anthropomorphic in the forest where they are visible</page><page sequence="22">72 only to initiates. In camp, however, they sometimes appear to non-initiates wearing mask. Either masked or invisible, they are often invoked in collective musical performances. Whatever the type of ceremonial dance, ritual substances used to stimulate songs and dances (herbs, plants, bark, dung, etc.) play a crucial rule. The metaphoric analogy traced by the Baka in the song-fable of Tibola between songs and the power to attract game reveals the efficiency which the Baka attribute to yé lì, y enga poto and ?èbùmà songs. As we have seen, intense individual and collective creativity gives rise to variable ritual expression through very different "dances". In spite of the mobility and sociological adaptability of the religious institutions (Barnard, 1988), there is one constant which is as difficult to grasp as the fluidity of the system but nonetheless fundamental: the quest for harmony, the indispensability to keep nature under control and achieving this through dancing and singing in every ritual. This constant, which the Baka themselves acknowledge when they say that song, dance and hunting ritual substances, although made differently, are identical from one ritual association to the next, discloses a deep philosophic reality which is common both to the Baka and the Aka pygmies from the Central African Republic. According to Arom (1978), Bahuchet (1989; 467-66) shows that while the Baka term yé 1 î refers more to the ritual semantic field, the corresponding Aka term di.yèí refers specifically to the yodel song technic. This stresses a key notion in Pygmy philosophy for whom the song that propitiates the most dangerous and prestigious hunt is inherent to the symbolic system. The ambiguous character of the specialized Baka initiate is relevant here because it not only raises the contentious question whether or not pygmies practise witchcraft and sorcery but it also opens the debate about the power attributed to music. The ngàngà initiate is ostensibly a beneficial agent doubled with the sorcerer (và.mbù) who brings to mind the nganga found thoughout the Bantu world. 23 Even if the action of Baka ngàngà specialists (which can be of either gender and rather numerous in a given</page><page sequence="23">73 local group) is fundamentally advantageous in hunting rites, the possibility of using degrees of witchcraft is not entirely ruled out. The initiate is considered, to a certain extent, ignorant of his ill- will. The Baka ancestors initiate (or one of his relatives) can become a tutelary spirit only if he has not been extensively involved with witchcraft during his lifetime. (If he has not "spilt too much human blood instead of animal blood" as the Baka say.) While spirits are normally transfered through inheritance, they can also be acquired in exchange of a relative's life. This type of widespread transaction is similar to that practiced by the Mbolia (de Heusch, 1971; 174) which is a clear example of sorcery. According to the Baka, ngàngà women are more witches than men. Surprizingly, the most powerful of those women are those that play the solist role and those who lend the intermingling of polyphonic voices. The ritual efficacity and cynegetic power attributed to these voices has hopefully been demonstrated. The element of personalities being metamorphosed into spirits is another important aspect to be considered in hunting rites. The molili "shadow" is the element for most initiates. However amongst the j eng ì and jiàbùlà initiates, this element seems to be the ndàmbù initiatic power. Much research is needed before being able to fully comprehend the ndàmbù hunting power (literally the socerer's point) which corresponds to both a power acquired through initiation and a ritual substances which facilitate the hunt's success. The mó 1 î 1 î "shadow" concept, on the contrary, is rather well documented. Numerous cases of soft trances observed during hunting ceremonies always imply relations with mó 1 î 1 î "shadow", either visually (the initiates "cross" looks with the spirit, see its "shadow" as well as those of forest animals into fire, civet skin or dreams ) or by metaphoric manipulation. (Here the yélî initiate goes into a trance after a knotted leaf symbolizing the molili shadow of game has been crushed.) Thus, even if the register of specialized technics used to communicate with spirits varies from one ritual association to another, the trance seems to be reached by applying a similar concept. The febrile state is not unlike that one described by Demesse (1979; 208-9) or Rouget (1990; 277) for the Aka-Mbènzèlè</page><page sequence="24">74 pygmies or by Bahuchet (1985; 436-37) and others for the Aka. This context is almost the same as the one emphasized by Rouget (1990; 264-77) for the Bushmen (using Lorna Marshall's data). With respect to the Baka, however, the trance was not only used therapeutically but also cynegetically and collective musical performances are used more as catalysts in the relations between humans and animal spirits than in provoking trances. Collective music thus plays a significant role in hunting rites. When A., a senior woman of the Bele camp and grand initiate of the Yenga Poto ritual association had died, we cried over her death. Over a year latter, I asked A. fs daughter if A. had now become one of those tutelary spirits who walk side by side with the elephant. Suddenly locked into the sardonic silence of forest people, A.'s daughter gave me no answer. But in the evening of the same day, theYenga Poto women initiates organized a ceremony and sang "in her great memory".

I would like to kindly thank Luc de Heusch, Serge Bahuchet, Robert Brisson, Anne-Marie Lozonsky, Philippe Jespers, Danielle Jonckers, Pierre Van Leynseele and Pierre de Maret for their invaluable advice; Catherine Daems and Theodore Trefon for the translation; Paul Joiris for the drawings. This analysis is the object of a doctoral dissertation being completed at ULB. 2 According to de Heusch 's categories (1971; 214, 269-79). 3 What could be described as the adaptability of the ritual institutions, the productions of variants and the use of versatile representation systems is in fact one of the caracteristics at the root of Baka society. Without going into detail, it is this intracultural dynamic of the ethnographic elements presented here which is taken into account. A related analysis is the subject of a forthcoming article ^ The symbolic elements surrounding the elephant were developed in a paper delivered during the international symposium on L'Alimentation en forêt tropicale : Interactions bioculturelles et Applications au développement, Paris (UNESCO), 10-13 Septembre 1991. See Joiris (In press, 1993). 5 According to Evans-Pritchard's classification (1937), Baka "willing và.mbù" seems to be a witch even if he willingly performs for a long period. Numerous aspects remain to be clarified, see for example Sevy, 1960. " I wish to express my sincere thanks to Robert Brisson who translated this song-fable which we recorded in Bele in 1990. This version corresponds to a variation told in Salapoumbe (Brisson, 1981-4) and to that of Kaloma in the vicinity of Lomié (Kilian-Hatz, 1989; 152-69). rj ' Allusion to the motion of the hunter when he approaches the elephant. 8 Polyalthia suaveolens (Brisson et Boursier,! 979; 52). 9 When the ngàngà puts the stick in the master-hunter's right hand, he will kill a male elephant, in his left hand, a cow elephant. 1" The word ngàngà refers to a whole ritual field and consists of a number of categories (ritual association, dancing performance, ritual agent and ritual power).</page><page sequence="30">80 H The present ngàngà dance is the same as mòkòndì, ?àbà 1 è and kosë . They are said to have different names "because everybody has his own way". The dictionary, which includes vocabulary from the Salapoumbe and Lomié areas, confirms the nexus between mòkòndì, ?àbà 1 è and ko s 5. According to Brisson and Boursier (1979 ; 153-253) mòkòndì is a fire spirit (m£ nã và) whose dance is similar to kòse's dance, ko s 6 is a spirit who presides over divining sessions (m£ n5 ngàngà) to cure people and prepare the hunt, ko s 5 dances ?àbàlè. The importance of the part played by these spirits to divining powers is attested on the one hand in oral literature, particularly in the mòkònd"i song-fable which involves s£s?, the divining bird (personal communication Brisson), and in the origin of the term kosë on the other hand. The original *kose was a kind of "trouble making evil". In the old Baka civilization, the diviner looked for *kose in fire. Bahuchet (1989 ; 465) points to the meaning of the original *kose which may explain that the present Baka kosë is a spirit who helps the diviner in his introspection. 12 Fire divining has been progressively abandoned in favor of civet-skin divining which the Baka learned from the Bangando. According to the Baka, the Bangando use it in the sorcerers' dance "bidi", a "villagers'" equivalent to the ngàngà dance. 13 "In the forest, the master-hunter may be guided by a former great master- hunter (his mother's brother, an older brother, etc). If the elephant charges, the spirit performs his magic to protect the hunter. He warms his heart and shouts " j êng ì!", then he moves away giving the hunter free reign to shoot and slaughter the elephant. A master-hunter's spirit is so strong he is able to lift an elephant. When the hunter returns to the camp, the ml who has guarded him stays in the forest and waits for yélî to call for another hunt." 14 "The women's voices become those of men", say the informants: "the women's yélî are their voices, the men's voices are the mòbìS flute. The master-hunter have heard the women's voices, they have kept them in their hearts turning them into mòb Ì5 music." 1D Only old ngàngà -master-hunter and yélî initiates are entitled to making this offering to ml. 16 The heart in the moral sense is búmá or t Bm£ which literally means "spirit's pocket". The ribs are mbàn jà.</page><page sequence="31">81 1' These songs play a prominent part for initiation in ritual associations. Their ritual power is not always sufficient to ensure the success of cynegetic activities. *" The present version of this dance (which I observed in the Bangando and Kwele lands) implies the simultaneous use of fire and civet skins but does not involve rattles. It includes a phase of fire-divining (without trance) which overlaps another therapeutic phase when the heat of a white-hot machete edge is applied. 1" Komba et les Origines, Archives de l'Evêché de Bertoua, p.6. ™ Identification of various spirits categories (e.g. mask, food, etc.) seem to be a criterion for pertinent differentiation allowing us to establish a chronology of the evolution of ritual associations. It is nevertheless a difficult task because words which refer to classes of spirits are often used as generic terms as well. " ai à" and "mòkòndì" for example, used to refer to "the spirit's race" as a whole, every category included. The Aka-Mbènzèlè from northern Congo and southern Central African Republic used the word "mukondi" in the same way (Demesse, 1978 : 207). Nowadays, the generic term m£ used in the Bangando and Kwele lands seems to be "sisimi", "bela" or áíà in the Konabembe land. 21 From the data I have gathered thus far it appears that it is not exactly a mourning dance but rather a ritual association which, in the time of mourning, much as the other associations, organizes a dance to honor the initiates once they have passed away. A number of dances : ?àbà lè, yenga poto, etc. are performed in succession during the mourning ceremonies. It can be hypothesized that there are many ?èbùmà initiates given the fact that ?èbùmà dance are often performed in mourning ceremonies. ¿¿ An ébúmbá primitive dance seems to have been linked to fire-divining and was then transformed and diversified by the Baka. According to Bahuchet (1989:465-466), the Baka mbömbS is the semantic equivalent of the Aka èbùmà which does not refer to a dance but to the clairvoyance remedy instilled in the diviner's eyes to help him read into fire. 23 n-*gàngà proto-bantu radical designates the magic protective agent (de Heusch, 1971; 180).</page></plain_text>
