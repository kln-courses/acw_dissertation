<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN UGRIAN CREATION MYTH ON EARLY HUNGARIAN PHALERAE PLATE 93 The Hungarian people migrating into the Car- pathian basin in A.D. 896 brought along a remarkable industrial art1 to its new homeland. The pleasant orna- mental style in which its products were adorned is, however, not due to an indigenous Hungarian initia- tive: it is one of the varieties of the post-Sassanian art of Persia, which had such a tremendous impact on the peoples of the Near East as well as on Byzantium. This style emerges not only in Russia in the ninth century2 (where it might be Hungarian but need not be, since it was certainly embraced by many peoples),3 but it also has ramifications throughout the Eurasian steppes to Mongolia,4 and moreover had some influ- ence on Scandinavian craftsmanship.5 The decorated bronze segment of a spear-standard in the Norwegian church of Heggen6 shows the same bird-griffon and lion-griffon as the Hungarian sabretache of Bezded,7 transformed according to the Scandinavian "Flecht- band" style. The enameled mace-head of the royal scepter of the last Avar ruler, made in the Near East, shows a close relationship to contemporary glazed tiles in Preslav (Bulgaria) and Byzantium, but the floral pattern of the tiles just mentioned is the same as the early Hungarian ornament.8 The existence of this Persian decorative style in ninth-century Hungary is all the more natural, as the mounted shepherds and warriors of the steppe had little inclination toward industrial work and usually had blacksmith and goldsmith clans of foreign origin with them. In the case of the Avars in Hungary, the post-Sassanian influence has been established long ago.9 With regard to the Hungarians, the presence of the so-called Ismaelites1o in their midst since the eleventh century is well known; in all likelihood, some of these were Persian sectarians who migrated with the Hun- garians into the region of the Middle Danube. On the other hand, it would be an error to suppose that every- thing in this art depended on the craftsmen and noth- ing on their patrons.

Roman portraits truly reflect Roman mentality and character, although Greek sculptors were prominent in their manufacture. This is also true, even if on a modest scale, in the case to which we now turn our attention. The post-Sassanian art of the Hungarians is lost as far as it was applied to perishable materials; what has survived is the metal ornament of their costumes and weapons. But the entire production must have had one general characteristic: the decorative motifs are mainly of vegetal nature. Zoomorphic elements occur in very few cases, such as the bird-griffon and the lion-griffon flanking the Christian cross on the sabre- tache from Bezded,11 the griffon on the silver end- piece of a strap from Benepuszta,12 and the same fabulous animal on the perfectly preserved damascened blade of the sword of a Hungarian king,'3 saved from destruction in the Schatzkammer of the German em- perors in Vienna. Recently, however, some more elaborate figural rep- resentations have emerged on newly found silver phalerae, once mounted on leather by means of round bosses, like the ornaments on the sabretaches. Two such phalerae in the Museum of Zemplin (now in Slovakia, in old Hungarian territory) can be only briefly mentioned:14 one shows in a somewhat de- generate form the same device as do the specimens which will be discussed presently; the other represents a horseman.15 Another such pair of silver discs (pl. 93, figs. 1-2) was found in a tomb in Rakamaz near Nyiregyhaiza in Hungary; they were published by an excellent con- noisseur of early mediaeval finds in southeastern Eu- rope, D. Csalliny.'6 They show identical decoration; the repouss6 work and the incised details as well as the style in general agree with the characteristics typi- cal of that ambiente, and need therefore no special analysis. The floral ornament which grows out of the head and beak of the eagle is one of the devices usual in this artistic milieu. The subject is easily recog- nizable: an eagle in frontal view, with wings out- spread, holds up some sort of duck in each of its talons. The problem is the interpretation of the scene. Many years ago'7 I demonstrated that the zoo- morphic figures and compositions of the animal style in Northern Asia always refer to a myth of origin, in general connected with some sort of cosmogony. Nothing could be more deeply rooted in the thinking of those nomads than this concept. When their envoys were asked about their people by the Chinese, or by Persians, or again by men at the court of Byzantium, they began their answer by reciting their myth of origin. And this happened not only in private con- versation. On an inscription of the eighth century A.D. at the river Orchon in Mongolia, a famous ruler of the Uigurs speaks to the reader, beginning with the following statement:18 "When the blue sky above and the dark earth below were created, between the two the children of man were created. Over the chil- dren of man my ancestors Bumin qagan and Istimi qagan set themselves (as rulers)." This hieratic pattern of self-identification goes back to prehistory. Herodotus heard it from Scythians in South Russia:19 the first man on Scythian soil and the first king of that people was the son of the heaven- ly father (Herodotus of course calls him Zeus) and of the daughter of the great river, Borysthenes. I have tried to illustrate another aspect of this mythical com- plex by examining the headgear of the Achaemenid king,20 originally a horse's head with a cockscomb in place of the mane, thus identifying him with the zoomorphic "first man and first ruler" of the myth of origin. This theriomorphic concept is well attested for the old myth of origin of the Hungarians. The female ancestor of the nation saw in a dream a hawk, by whom she was made pregnant and thus gave birth to the first king.21 This hawk, turul in Hungarian, was the badge on the shields of the Hungarian kings,22 who were called "descendants of the turul."23 11 Fettich (supra n. 1) pl. 49. 12Fettich, pl. 32, I. 13 Fettich, pl. 78. 14 V.

The keynote must be the myth of origin. As an eagle, not a hawk, is shown, something more general than the totem of the nation must be represented. In fact, we know that the eagle was venerated in the world of the Eurasian steppe as the "father of heavens." An excellent study by L. Sternberg collected the whole evidence in folklore and myth for this concept.24 The amazing tenacity of tradition in thought and picture in this region of the world, until recently isolated to a large extent from the other parts of Asia, warrants the antiquity of the data reported by travelers and ethnographers. Stern- berg documents the veneration of the eagle as the Father of Heavens by the Yakuts on the Yenissei river, for whom the eagle is the Creator. The Ostyak neigh- bours of the Yakuts have the same notion; they be- lieve that the eagle created the shamans. The Finns, too, called their shamans "sons of the Heavenly Fa- ther," Ukko Aiydi, corresponding to the Yakut epithet for the eagle, Aiy. Further, the people of the Katchins honor the eagle as their eponymous spirit and heaven- ly patron. The Orotchens of Transbaikalia and many other tribes venerate the eagle as the "lord of light- ning and thunder." As the materials given by U. Harva25 illustrate, the sovereign role of that mighty bird became less important under the influence of anthropomorphic concepts of the deity. He is in many cases the envoy of the Supreme God,26 but remains a mighty creature: the totemic ancestor (merkiit) of the people of the Merkiit, a giant "whose left wing covers the moon and whose right wing covers the sun."27 The Dolgans represent him at the top of the world-pole, etc. His original role was, as we saw, much greater: the Creator was imagined in his shape. As the Hungarians are an Ugrian tribe (with a strong upper stratum of Turkish origin),2 the ex- istence of the concept of the eagle-Father of the Heaven by the Ugrians of Western Siberia (Vogul and Osty- ak) is all-important for our problem: it makes it likely that the eagle of our phalerae could also be the Heav- enly Father and Creator himself. This can be proved by the following considerations. Our eagle (pl. 93, figs. 1-2) holds in his talons two birds, both some kind of wild duck. It is not by chance that, instead of devouring them, he supports them gently. The duck on the left looks up as if waiting for his word, that on the right sits or leans on the mighty talon of the big bird, quite undisturbed. This curious and peculiar relationship can well be explained by the myth of Creation of the Ugrians established at the river Ob. The southern group of the Voguls in the past century still cultivated the epic songs on the primeval flood and the extraction of the earth from it by a duck-by one of two ducks which received the order from the Father of Heavens.29 The creator sent the merganser and the grebe to the bottom of the Ocean which covered everything. One of these waterfowl30 succeeds in bringing a bit of mud to the surface in its beak; this mud swells in a short time to the earthly world. The same cosmogony was found among the neighbouring Ostyaks,31 and varie- ties of this myth exist in northern Asia as well as among the Indians of North America.32 Traces of old beliefs, pointing to the same northern sphere, are not lacking in Hungarian folklore.3 But such early, authentic documents of the archaic Ugrian myth of Creation, as our phalerae, are unique.

Csalliny 324 (supra n. 16) would like to identify the eagle of the phalerae of Rakamaz with the turul of the Hungarian myth of origin; but this bird is not an eagle but a hawk, astur in Latin. 24 L. Sternberg, "Der Adlerkult bei den V6lkern Sibiriens," ArchRW 28 (1930) 125-153. Csalliny (supra n. 16) 322ff connects the eagle of our phalerae with the eagle on a gold ewer of Nagy-Szent-Mikl6s. But the motifs on each are totally dif- ferent, and the treasure of Nagy-Szent-Mikl6s is not Hun- garian, cf. A. Alfoldi, CahArch 6 (1952) 43ff. 25 U.
