      <p>Andrew Linzey has written more books about the ethics of humans’ relationships with nonhuman animals than most people—even people professionally interested in ethics—have likely read. The sometime holder of the world’s first named academic positions in animal ethics, Linzey has been a tireless campaigner for animal welfare in print and in person. In <italic>Why Animal Suffering Matters</italic>, he has sought to synthesize his theoretical insights regarding animal ethics while also illustrating their application by considering three case studies. He also offers a thoughtful critique of the strategies we employ to reduce our awareness of the harms humans cause other animals.</p>
      <p>Linzey begins by arguing that animal suffering is morally significant. His principal focus is the demolition of arguments against the moral equivalence of human and nonhuman suffering, although he also introduces a specifically theological analogy between the crucified Jesus as innocent victim and the helpless animal sufferer. He seeks to undermine the claim that animals are natural slaves and to rebut arguments that animals’ putative soullessness and failure to reflect the divine image and their supposed lack of rationality, moral agency, or linguistic competence should be thought to reduce their moral standing. He goes on to consider the ways in which we may be inclined to insulate ourselves from the impact of animal suffering, examining strategies including the misdescription of animals, their misrepresentation, what he labels “misdirection” (including arguments that concern for animal suffering presupposes an illegitimate anthropomorphism and that animals’ experience of pain is sufficiently different from ours to make concern with it unnecessary), and misperception—all of them institutionalized and all capable of being undermined via education, consumer choice, and legal change.</p>
      <p>In the central portion of the book, Linzey applies his analysis to three case studies: hunting with dogs, fur farming, and commercial sealing. In each case, he evaluates arguments offered in support of these strategies and shows convincingly why they are unsuccessful. He is quite aware that animals are subjected to other, arguably more pervasive, sorts of abuses in our society—animal testing and killing animals for food come readily to mind. But he maintains, plausibly I think, that we should at least be able to agree that the sources of suffering on which he focuses can and should be eliminated.</p>
      <p>In a final chapter, Linzey envisions and addresses several challenges to his position: that he has focused only on relatively limited and relatively noncontroversial cases, that he has unreasonably focused on suffering rather than killing, that he has paid insufficient attention specifically to the idea of rights, that he ignores cost‐benefit analysis, that his arguments are unduly theological, and that he has failed to offer the full available range of evidence for animal sentience and rationality in support of his thesis. To these challenges, he responds that the cases he has considered are especially egregious and that we should at least be able to agree on eliminating the suffering they involve; that killing is sometimes permissible (as in cases of self‐defense), but that this does nothing to show that causing suffering to animals to benefit others is reasonable; that, while he regards animals as rights bearers, he believes his case can be made without controversial appeals to rights; that cost‐benefit analysis of the sort envisioned is both impossible and likely to serve as a cloak for special pleading; that, while some of his arguments are theological, the nontheological ones can stand on their own two feet; and that a strength of his arguments is precisely that they show that causing animal suffering is unreasonable even without appeals to evidence regarding animals’ relatively advanced mental lives.</p>
      <p>Also in the final chapter, Linzey seeks to distinguish himself from Peter Singer by critiquing Singer’s (very limited) endorsement of infanticide. Rejecting Singer’s utilitarianism, Linzey argues that Singer errs in failing to attend to “innocence, vulnerability, and the capacity to give informed consent” (154) as factors relevant to the appropriateness of our treatment of both infants and animals. Linzey suggests that Singer is guilty of “adultism,” by privileging the defining characteristics of mature individuals over those of children, the handicapped, and others.</p>
      <p>Linzey’s arguments are in significant part persuasive, it seems to me: the support characteristically offered for routine harm to animals, especially the sort on which he focuses in the central sections of this book, is very weak indeed. The analogies between suffering animals on the one hand and the suffering Christ and vulnerable children on the other are aptly drawn and suggestive, even (in the case of the former) if theology isn’t to one’s taste. In the interest of advancing the conversation, I will focus on two areas of disagreement, neither of them decisive. Because Linzey’s approach doesn’t draw on a systematic moral theory, one can perfectly well differ with him about these points, as about the relevance of Jesus’s suffering to the debate in which he’s engaged, without dismissing his battery of arguments as a whole.</p>
      <p>Linzey’s focus on suffering—understood as harm that is consciously experienced, as “the mental experience of pain, including such sensations as shock, fear, foreboding, anxiety, trauma, anticipation, stress, distress, and terror” (10)—is relatively undefended. He might have focused, after all, on harm—understood as violating animals’ well‐being or welfare or interests (in the objective sense). But he chooses instead to object to actions that cause subjective discomfort to animals. No doubt there is an echo here of Bentham’s famous assertion that what matters about animals is not whether they can reason but whether they suffer. Linzey clearly intends to reject the idea that only harms to the intellectually gifted, for instance, really matter, and he is surely right to do so. But I am not sure that he takes with sufficient seriousness arguments designed to show that subjective states as such have, at least in general, no moral significance, that such states matter only to the extent that they signal violations of welfare objectively specified. (Broadly Aristotelian points of this sort have been made effectively by, e.g., John Finnis and Mark Murphy.) Linzey might, that is, have called his book <italic>Why Harm to Animals Matters</italic>. Most or all of the arguments he offers against minimizing the awfulness of harm to animals would still be relevant, but he would not be subject to the criticism that he treats subjective awareness of welfare (and so of harm) as basic, rather than focusing on welfare itself.</p>
      <p>While Linzey is himself comfortable with rights talk, he seeks to respond to theological objections to the language of rights—rooted, he says, in “the notion that creation is grace” (161)—by suggesting that we might think of animals as benefiting from what he calls “theos‐rights”: that is, God’s rights as creator that these aspects of the creation be respected. On this view, acknowledging animal rights would be a matter of taking seriously “God’s <italic>own right</italic> in the creatures she has made” (162). Linzey may grant too quickly that theological objections to rights talk merit “respect” (161). (Nicholas Wolterstorff’s <italic>Justice: Rights and Wrongs</italic> [Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2007] carefully rebuts such objections.) And his appeal to theos‐rights is unpersuasive. For nontheists, obviously, it won’t matter. But even theists ought to find it troubling. If animals already have morally cognizable interests, then theos‐rights would seem to be irrelevant. On the other hand, if they lack such interests, then claiming these theos‐rights on their behalf seems problematic. At any rate, the picture of God that emerges is unattractive since it seems to involve God in disregarding the (putative) welfare of moral subjects—humans—not in the interest of other moral subjects but instead on what must be judged essentially aesthetic grounds.</p>
      <p>There are therefore a priori reasons to doubt the plausibility of appeals to theos‐rights to make up for the (purported) lack of other sorts of rights for animals. In addition, even granting the reality of God, the credibility of the idea of theos‐rights, and God’s accessibility through one or more media of revelation, it is difficult to identify putatively revelatory authority in the Christian tradition (among others) for belief in the moral importance of respect for animals’ interests. To be sure, there are particular theological themes that might be invoked here, and Linzey identifies them, but outlining these themes is hardly the same thing as showing that God has claimed theos‐rights on animals’ behalf. In short, if the only sorts of rights animals can reasonably be thought to have are theos‐rights, it does not seem as if animal rights are on very secure footing.</p>
      <p>Of course, Linzey does not rest his claims on appeals to rights, per se, and the materials for a more persuasive account of animal rights than the one he offers are arguably available. In brief (here following the approach of Murphy, Finnis, et al., although not their conclusions), we can give determinate content to the notion of an animal’s well‐being, observing that it includes such dimensions as life, friendship, peace of mind, play, and perhaps on occasion knowledge and aesthetic experience. Each of these dimensions, and each instance of welfare in each dimension, is incommensurable and nonfungible. While many or most animals may not be moral agents, humans are, and a human can acknowledge the value, the incommensurability, and the nonfungibility of each of these aspects of well‐being and each instance of each aspect. But to harm any such instance purposefully or instrumentally would only be reasonable if some other value outweighed the value of the instance being harmed or if the instance weren’t, in fact, valuable. Since, however, each instance is, ex hypothesi, valuable, and since it makes no sense to talk of the incommensurable value of one aspect of well‐being as outweighed by another (if their weights could be compared, they wouldn’t be incommensurable), it will never be reasonable to cause purposeful or instrumental harm to a basic aspect of an animal’s well‐being. (It may, of course, be reasonable to cause harm knowingly but inadvertently—as, e.g., in self‐defense.) I would be inclined to argue that, although the goods involved are goods even for an individual not consciously experiencing them, an individual needs a certain capacity for consciousness to qualify as a moral subject (I will not argue the point here), but most animals (and certainly those on whose well‐being Linzey concentrates) do have this capacity. If it is wrong for a moral agent ever to cause purposeful or instrumental harm to an authentic dimension of an animal’s well‐being, then it seems clearly reasonable to say that the animal has a right against the moral agent that such a harm not be committed. A natural‐law approach of this sort can ground a robust account of animal rights that ought to be attractive to theists sympathetic to the broader natural‐law tradition, without requiring the defender of animal rights to endorse the questionable voluntarism that seems to lie at the root of appeals to theos‐rights.</p>
      <p>
         <italic>Why Animal Suffering Matters</italic> does not break substantially new ground as a philosophical work. It does, however, discuss issues and marshal arguments in a clear and accessible way. Linzey shows himself an effective moralist and an engaging teacher, and this book deserves to be used widely as an introductory text—both in courses related specifically to ethics and animals and in those concerned with practical ethics more generally—as Linzey makes clear he intends it to be. More advanced readers will also benefit from the clarity of Linzey’s analysis and the detail with which he addresses relevant issues.</p>
