<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MEDALLION AND BLOCK RELIEF AT PETRA PHILIP C. HAMMOND Near the ancient path leading down from the Great High Place at Petra, toward Wadi Farasa on the western side of El-Madhbah, is a secluded rock platform in the side of which is carved a niched Dusares block above which appears a framed medallion containing a human bust. The latter is greatly defaced, through either weathering or' vandalism, but certain features can be discerned: the general outline of the upper torso, the trace of a garland or coiffure, the (faint) trace of a necklace, and two bracelets. Above the head are two holes, so weathered that it is impossible to decide whether they are natural or served to mount some addition. The weathered hole at the right of the medallion would, however, tend to suggest the former. The outlines of the medallion frame are also weathered, but the surface appears unornamented. All the surfaces, except for the bust, were dressed smooth, with a trace of the diagonal dressing commonly used by the Naba- taeans for finishing. The medallion niche is slightly concave, allowing the bust to stand out more prominently. The sides and back of the block niche are squared and straight, as usual.</page><page sequence="2">Number 192 December, 1968 The total carving stands about 1.45 m. from the bottom of the niche, which begins ca. 17 cm. from the platform floor, separated from it by a recessed cutting. The Dusares block is of the " standard " type, with its height double its width (ca. 20 cm. x 40 cm.), with a socle of ca. 2.5 cm. The medallion is slightly oval, measuring ca. 30 cm. wide and ca. 37.5 cm. high, although greatly weathered, especially at the bottom. :::i liilliii:ij.: M ?T, 4"N ms sti? ?

(Photo: Hammond) This combination appears to have definite relevance to Nabataean cult, but the monument seems never to have been published, discussed, or even noted, although it is completely unique at Petra and no parallel to it is, to the writer's knowledge, known elsewhere in Nabataean iconography. If the two parts of the carving belong together,. then both must be Nabataean and cultic, on the basis of the Dusares block. Likewise, if such a relationship exists, certain chronological suggestions are possible. 17</page><page sequence="3">Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research The medallion torso raises specific problems on its own. Most important is that of identification. Is the figure male or female ? Is it a deity ? If so, which one? What is its relation to Dusares? And, finally, what is the significance of the carving as a whole ? As far as relating the two carvings is concerned, the two appear, in their present form, as a interrelated unit, without apparent demarcation between them.

(Photo: Hammond) added above the block, at a later date, is further suggested by the over-all patination (a major criterion for chronological sequences in stone work) which indicates the probability of contemporaneity. That a cultic signifi- cance is to be attached to the medallion is thus assured by its integral relationship to the Dusares block and the geographical setting of both, appearing together on the way to the major cultic shrine of the area (i.e., 18</page><page sequence="4">Number 192 December, 1968 the Great High Place). Hence we have two religious emblems, carved at the same time. The sex of the medallion figure is somewhat difficult to determine because of weathering. The bracelets, the possible torque, and the long side-locks could all apply to either males or females in Nabataean iconography. Similarly, the relatively flat chest of the figure is inconclusive. However, the hair styling on top of the head may well be definitive.1 The central upsweep style, either with the true " chignon ", or with a simple upsweep, appears on Nike and Atargatis types at Jebel et-Tannur and else- where. The Nike examples usually seem to have the chignon, without side- locks, while Atargatis does appear with simple central upsweep and side- locks. The side-locks of males are also of the same type, but without the center upsweep. That a veil is also combined, in the Petra medallion, with side-locks, appears doubtful, although a widening of the side-lock on the right side, and the suggestion of a double plane in both locks, might be noted. Details of the medallion seem to have parallels at Tannur in the various treatments seen in the forms of Atargatis as vegetation and grain goddess, and even with that of the hair treatment on the " decorative " type of female deity used there.2 The " leafy " rendering of the hair on the Atar- gatis examples, reflecting the background and the attributes of the goddess, is hardly unplanned. Likewise, the suggestion of a ragged sleeve edge, still visible on the left shoulder of the Petra example, further heightens the parallel with the Tannur renderings, where a foliate effect is introduced into the dress of the vegetation goddess. Hence, it is suggested that the medal- lion relief at Petra represents a goddess, and especially Atargatis as grain or vegetation goddess. On the basis of the inscription found on the way to the Great High Place, referring to the consecration of sites there to " the Lord of the temple (i.e., Dusares) " and to al-'Uzza,3 as well as the dedication of Dusares blocks in the el-Khubtha area to Dusares and the same goddess,4 it may be supposed that the goddess associated with a Dusares block is to be identified with the original North-Arabian deity. However, by the time of the Tannur sculpture, the Arabian goddess had become identified with the more powerful Atargatis, who became the chief female deity of the Nabataeans. Thus, by the time of the Petra relief, the process was complete, and with the adoption of a " foreign " mode of representing deities (i.e., anthropomorphically), the form as well as the attri- butes of such foreign models was taken over. Hence all representations of Atargatis used in Nabataean iconography would have certain common features, as Glueck has pointed out in his discussion of the portrayals of Atargatis in her various roles at Tannur. Thus the Petra example could 1 Nelson Glueck, Deities and Dolphins (New York, 1965), p. 183, c, d, p. 405; P1. 180, p. 180, p. 402; P1. 25, p. 49, P1. 26, p. 50; see pp. 196-197, 227 for discussion and p. 45, p. 97, P1. 135, p. 301, P1. 46, p. 108, P1. 53 b, p. 115, inter alia; see also the Mescad figure with veil, P1. xxvi, #110, in Maurice Dunand, Le Musde de Soueida (Paris, 1934); cf. the Helios reliefs, Glueck, Pls. 136-138, pp. 302-304. 2 Glueck, op. cit., P1. 26, p. 50, P1. 32, p. 66, P1l 33 a, p. 67; and cf.

This raises the chronological question of the relationship of the Petra relief to those of Tannur. Since the latter are dateable, possible chronological data are offered for the Petra monument. If Atargatis in anthropomorphic form is seen here in company with a Dusares block (i.e., the chief male deity of the Nabataeans still represented in a non-anthropomorphic form) and if nowhere else this combination is found, we have evidence, for the first time, of an intermediate step in the anthropomorphization of the Nabataean cult. At Tannur Dusares has been anthropomorphized (if not well before); hence the Petra relief stands between the representation of the god by a block alone, and the final stage of representation in human form. Assuredly the block itself is an advance over the portable stone, or unhewn stationary " residence " of a deity, of the traveling nomad and already indi- cates the adoption of sedentary (agricultural/commercial) cultic influences. The step toward anthropomorphic representation of gods, even of adopted ones (who perhaps perforce had to be accepted in that form), was still an- other modification of culture experienced by other nomadic or semi-nomadic peoples, as they settled in the Sown, and illustrates further the changes noted by Strabo, in contrast to Diodorus.5 If, at Tannur, Atargatis and Dusares-Hadad are both shown in anthro- pomorphic form, a terminus ad quem is given for the Petra example (i.e., before Period III of Tannur, following A. D. 106).6 Nowhere are Dusares blocks dated, per se. However, in the El-Medras area at Petra, an inscription dated to A. D. 17 (so Dussaud),7 refers to cultic sites there, in which Dusares blocks must be included. Among the monu- ments is also a Dusares block with an associated eagle carving above it, as at Meda'in Saleh.8 At the latter site, the eagle motif also is in association with tombs of an elaborate type, dated by inscriptions from the first century B. C. into the second century A. D., especially during the reign of Aretas IV (9 B. C.-A. D. 40). At Sic, also the eagle appears from the first century B. C. on.9 Hence by the period of Aretas IV, the Dusares block, in company with another symbol, is already known.. The eagle, in particular, establishes a solar identification for Dusares, which agrees with Strabo's report of a sun god as chief of the Nabataean pantheon. Anthropomorphic representations of Dusares also appear about this time, probably as a Dionysos figure.10 5 Cf. Strabo, Geog. 16.4.26 with Diodorus XIX. 94 ff., II, 4811.2. 6 Glueck, op. cit., pp. 138, 213. 7 Gustaf Dalman, Petra und seine Felsheiligtiimer (Leipzig, 1908), p. 127. 8 Idem., fig. 34, p. 117 (#51e). 9 H. C. Butler, Publications of the Princeton University Archaeological Expedition ... I, A, p. 401; as also at Meda'in ?aleh and elsewhere. 10o Dalman, Neue Petra-Forschungen, p. 22; Th. Wiegand, et al., Petra (Deutsch- turkische Denkmals Schutz-Kommando, 3; Berlin, 1921), p. 10, suggests a date which appears to fit the data, as well; see Butler, op. cit., p. 390 for Sic; Dunand, op. cit., p. 73 also on the date, which again correlates with Strabo and with the eagle combina- tion; see also Dalman, Petra .. ., pp. 277-278 and fig. 220. Even if the medallion figure be construed as masculine (i.e. Helios, or some other " borrowed " deity), the argument in regard to the process of anthropomorphization of cultic representation would still be valid. The possibility of some closer chronological referent for the Dusares block, closely related to the argument made here, will be suggested in a forthcoming publica- tion elsewhere. 20</page><page sequence="6">Number 192 December, 1968 Thus the Petra carving would seem to date probably not before the late first century B. C., before which the combination of block and associated symbol does not seem to appear, but well before the Tannur III period, where anthropomorphic representations are fully developed. Because of a number of innovations in the long reign of Aretas IV, it may well be that the pro- gress from block to anthropomorphic representation took place during the period of his rule. Hence the combination seen in the block and medallion carving seems to represent the intermediate step in the development of Nabataean cultic iconography toward full anthropomorphic representation of the gods.</page></plain_text>
