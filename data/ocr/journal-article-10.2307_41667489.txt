<plain_text><page sequence="1">CASCIOARELE The valley of the Lower Danube has since earliest times been a favorable region for human settlement. The numerous lakes which the river forms all along the left bank, in Roumanian territory, from the Iron Gates to the delta, as well as the deep forests and the many sheltered islets, attracted man with their mani- fold possibilities of food and shelter. It is therefore no wonder that archaeological exploration during re- cent decades has identified many settlements and cem- eteries in this zone, from the relatively scarce sites of the Palaeolithic period to the numerous ones of the Neolithic and following periods. Among the Neo- lithic settlements situated on the river terraces as well as on the various larger or smaller islands in the Danube and the neighboring lakes, which are joined by numerous canals, there are some in which more systematic soundings or excavations have been made. It was in one of the smaller regions of this zone that Vasile Pârvan, the master of modern Roumanian archaeology, initiated systematic study of the Neo- lithic south of the Carpathians. Through this research a series of Neolithic cultures were identified, complet- ing our then limited and hazy picture of those ancient times. It was only natural that once the new impulse for archaeological research was given some fifteen years ago, under the direction of the Academy of the Roumanian People's Republic (first through the Na- tional Museum of Antiquities and later, since 1956, through the newly created Institute for Archaeology) , some of the sites, which had been identified as long as forty years ago, should become the object of new re- search on a larger scale, with greatly augmented means. Among these settlements is one situated on an islet in Lake Cãtãlui, near the village of Cãscioarele, some sixty kilometers (37 miles) south of Bucharest. This islet, called Ostrovelul, where the first sounding had already been made in 1925, is rather small, its diam- eter less than 100 meters; and when the water level is low the islet does not emerge more than 3-4 meters. Therefore, wishing to undertake a systematic and complete excavation, layer by layer, of a Neolithic settlement, we thought that this one was the most suitable for our purpose. Considering its small area, we were entitled to hope that in a short time we could unearth the whole upper level. At the same time, the fact that at a depth of about two meters there is at least one other Neolithic stratum belonging to the same culture should enable us to determine the dif- ferences between these phases. The work, which was started in the spring of 1962 by a group led by the author, was continued on a larger scale in 1963, so that at the end of the second campaign the whole upper layer of the settlement was unearthed, and it was thus possible to draw a plan of the Neolithic dwellings of this stratum. Besides, it is the first settlement of the Gumelnitza culture any- where in Roumania or Bulgaria where a whole layer has been completely excavated ; as a result it has been possible to determine the layout of the dwellings within a Neolithic settlement. As is well known, the Gumelnitza culture spread during the late Neolithic period north of the Danube in Wallachia, south of the Danube in Dobrudja (Roumania) and north and south of the Balkan range in central and eastern Bul- garia. This culture, of the late Neolithic period, suc- ceeded the Boian culture, from which it was derived. It is true that in the humus and even as low as the level at which the ruins of the dwellings lie (30-60 cm.) there are also more recent remains. But strictly speaking, in no place do these constitute a stratum, being only sporadic and much scattered. They belong partly to the late La Tene period (Daco-Getic culture, with native or imported pottery, coins, etc.) and in larger part to the Hallstatt period (phase B) and to the period of transition from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age (Cernavoda culture). The Hallstatt re- mains are found in ritual pits full of broken pottery, especially large vessels, while those belonging to the Cernavoda culture are scattered over the whole area of the settlement. The Neolithic remains, however, are the most ex- tensive, providing evidence of a well established set- tlement of a late phase of the Gumelnitza culture. In an area of four to five thousand square meters the remains of sixteen dwellings were found, all rectan- gular in plan and of rather large dimensions. The smallest are 8 x 6.50 m., while others are as large as 12 X 8 m. One of the buildings is only 4 x 4 m., but in our opinion this one must be considered as an an- 34</page><page sequence="2">View of the island of Ostrovelul from the village of Cãscioarele, during the excavations. A Late Neolithic Settlement on the Lower Danube By VLADIMIR DUMITRESCU nex, not really a house, especially as there were no remains of a hearth among its ruins. In any case, it was found that the dwellings had been destroyed by a great fire - as was the case in all the Neolithic settle- ments of the region - after which the inhabitants left the islet, and no other people of the same culture came to settle in that place again. But the very fact that the dwellings were burned enables us to make a series of observations regarding the way they were built: on the large fragments of baked clay which represent the burnt walls one can see the marks of large posts, of rods and even of the reeds on which the clay was thickly spread. Hence there is no doubt that these dwellings had a framework of heavy posts and that the walls were plastered with clay. As re- gards the roofs we have no direct evidence, but a series of clay house models discovered in our excava- tions shows that they were gabled, made of wood and probably covered with reed or thatch. Since the cal- cined ruins of the dwellings were often scattered, they do not permit us to come to any conclusion regarding the possible inner division of the houses into two or more rooms. However, since we found remains of two hearths in only a few of the houses, while even the larger ones had only one hearth, we are inclined to believe that these houses generally consisted of a sin- gle large room. Besides, no inner divisions are seen in the clay models. Some of the hearths are preserved in such condi- tion as to permit specific observations. Generally they are square in shape, more than one square meter in size, with a high, often double or triple, sometimes even quintuple, relief border, reaching a height of 40 cm. and interrupted on one side for the introduc- tion of the fire. In one of the dwellings we even dis- covered a horseshoe-shaped oven with a quadruple 35</page><page sequence="3">(Left) The remains of a Neolithic hearth beside which were found more than 100 clay loom weights and fish-net weights and a stone quern.

Cãscioarele continued border, but its dome was broken and shattered. Inside some of the houses a floor of baked clay (10 cm. thick) was discovered, without any wooden support below. In this respect they differ from the dwellings of the Cucuteni-Tripolye culture, found in northern and eastern Roumania and the Ukraine. This culture, characterized by its painted polychrome wares, ex- tended from the East Carpathians to the Dnieper and, generally speaking, was contemporary with the Gumel- nitza culture. The dwellings of this culture are often provided with a wooden support below the baked clay floor. In the house with the oven we discovered two hu- man skulls under the clay floor near the oven. These had been purposely detached from the bodies, which were not found. The skulls must be connected with some magical practice performed before the building of the house, as is shown by the fact that the floor had not been broken through. Such finds are known from other Neolithic settlements in Roumania and neighboring regions. Unlike the houses of the Cucuteni-Tripolye culture, the dwellings in the Cãscioarele settlement do not seem to have been placed according to a well estab- lished plan, but are scattered about somewhat at ran- dom, over most of the area of the village. Their orien- tation also varies. On the other hand, no remains of Neolithic dwellings were discovered in the whole northwest zone, at the edge of which was found the small building without a hearth, and also an 'open air" hearth. This leads us to think that this zone was intentionally left free of houses. If, during the more than four thousand years which have elapsed since the great fire wiped out the Neolithic settlement, flood waters have destroyed a large part of this side of the island, it might be thought that this zone was once surrounded by dwellings and was possibly de- voted to various ceremonies. If, on the contrary, there 37</page><page sequence="5">Horn harpoons. Vase with lid, both painted with white zigzag lines. Cãscioarele continued were no houses in the area which may have been de- stroyed by floods, then it is probable that this zone was reserved for other purposes, such as sheltering domestic animals. Within all these houses as well as around them, numerous remains were found which enable us to form a fairly clear picture of the inhabitants' life in this Neolithic settlement. Stone querns appear in all the dwellings and prove that the tribes of the late Gumelnitza culture were grain-producers. The dis- covery of a plowshare made of an antler shows that these tribes had passed the economic stage termed "incipient agriculture" and were real farmers. Worked flint, polished stone, bone and horn tools and of course pottery are the most frequent finds, while copper tools are extremely rare. Among the flint tools and weapons we note massive axes specific to the Gumelnitza culture, blades, scrap- ers etc., and beautifully finished triangular arrow- heads. Even a flint workshop was discovered in one of the dwellings - the first of its kind in a Neolithic settlement in Roumania. Among the tools made of bone and horn we must mention the numerous har- poons for big fish, as well as various types of awls. We cannot describe here all the kinds of objects dis- covered, but we should at least mention the many clay weights - perhaps used for weaving looms as well as for fish nets - and the clay spindle whorls which show that spinning and weaving were practised. The pottery is extremely varied, but three main fabrics can be distinguished: a fine one, of carefully 38</page><page sequence="6">Terracotta female figurine.

The forms are fairly varied as well. These cannot be presented here, since not all the material has yet been restored in the laboratories. With regard to the decoration, it is in relief (simple or patterned barbotine, fluted and pitted bands and bosses) or in- cised or painted. The last ware is the least frequent, but along with the graphite-painted vessels there are also some painted in white. Regarding the patterns, one may say that the spiral was not in great favor, as it is seldom found. An important group of discoveries is connected with magical practices and religious beliefs. Many figurines, mostly female, were discovered. These are made of baked clay or bone, and all of them are known from settlements of the Gumelnitza culture, some being peculiar to that culture. We must also mention three statuettes of the well known Thessalian type (modeled, without a head, but provided with a hole so that a separately modeled head, probably of perishable material, could be attached) ; two of these are the largest hitherto discovered in the area of the Danube. As is well known, such statuettes did not spread northward and are considered peculiar to Gu- melnitza B. Likewise connected with the supernatural elements of the life of this primitive community is a series of theriomorphic vessels and a few clay rhytons (drinking vessels), which indicate relations with the Aegean and Western Asia. On the other hand, there is a fragmentary anthropomorphic vessel imported from the Cucuteni culture (phase A) which, along with other finds in other Gumelnitza B settlements, shows that Gumelnitza B and Cucuteni A phases were at least partly contemporary. During the excavations we found a great quantity of animal bones, among which the bones of game are twice as numerous as those of domestic animals. This proves that hunting was a flourishing occupation - two kinds of deer ( Cervus elaphus L., Capreolus ca- preolus L.), wild boar (Sus scrofa L.), wild ox (Bos primi genius) and other animals were frequently hunted. The harpoons mentioned above, as well as vertebrae of large and small fish, show that fishing provided this primitive community with a large part of its food. This is quite understandable in view of the exceptional amount of all kinds of fish found in the lakes and marshes of the Danube. Among the bones of domestic animals, the most frequent are those of cattle ( Bos tour us L. ) ; next are those of dogs ( Canis familiaris L.) and of swine (Sus scrofa dom.), only a few of sheep, goats and other animals. Horse (Equus caballus L.) bones are also numerous, but until a complete study of them is made, they must tentatively be considered as those of wild horses. From the evidence mentioned we can see that cat- tle-breeding played an important, if not the most im- portant, part in the life of the Cãscioarele community. Surrounded by the waters of Lake Cãtãlui, which assured it protection against possible attacks of hostile tribes as well as against wild beasts, situated in the midst of a rich region, with a plain for agriculture nearby, the Neolithic settlement on the islet of Os- trovelul fulfilled every condition for its inhabitants to enjoy a fairly easy, quiet life. That this islet is easy to defend is proved by the fact that it was inhabited before the stage represented by this upper layer as well as later on. Although neither charcoal nor cal- cined grains were found, which would give a precise chronology by the Carbon 14 method, on the basis of our knowledge of the various phases of the Gumel- nitza culture we can state without fear of error that the settlement of Cãscioarele, belonging to the early stage of Gumelnitza B, must be dated in the second half of the third millennium b.c. It is one of the nu- merous settlements of this important culture of the later Neolithic period in southeastern Europe, whose connections, on the one hand with the Cucuteni- Tripolye culture, on the other with the more southern regions, have long since been demonstrated. The research which we hope to continue on this settlement should enlighten us not only about the deeper layers and the features of each of them, but at the same time show us the rhythm and direction of development of the Gumelnitza culture, the influences it underwent and the part these played in its develop- ment. At the same time, our research will give us a complete reconstruction of the life of a primitive community of this late phase of the Roumanian Neo- lithic on the Lower Danube.
