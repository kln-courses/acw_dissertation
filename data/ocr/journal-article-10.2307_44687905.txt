Neal-Sturgess, A. M. Hassan and Rong Guo University of Birmingham Copyright Â© 2007 SAE International ABSTRACT The aims of this study are to investigate the responses of a Hybrid III dummy and a human body model in rollover crashes of an SUV, and to assess the effect of seat belts on occupant kinematics in rollover events. A SAEJ21 14 rollover test of a 1994 Ford Explorer for two front row dummies with an inflatable tubular structure (ITS) is reconstructed and validated in MADYMO. By removing the ITS, the simulations of the Hybrid III dummy occupants with and without seat belts are obtained. By replacing the dummy models with human body models, with and without seat belts, two other combinations are also modelled. The kinematics and injury risks of two kinds of occupant models are compared and evaluated. Significant differences exist in the motions, and injury levels of the dummies and human body models with and without seat belts. Seat belts can significantly mitigate against occupant ejection. The flexibility of the spine and the neck of the human body models significantly affects the kinematics and the severity of the injuries of the occupants modelled compared to that of the dummies. INTRODUCTION The increased interest in understanding and preventing occupant injuries in rollover crashes has resulted in a corresponding increase in the complexity of rollover crash analysis. Full-scale rollover tests are established and in use to develop occupant protection systems. Also, by conducting rollover tests, researchers expect to understand the kinematics of the vehicle and occupants, and to assess the potential injury causation during rollover. The modelling of human kinematics in rollover tests has received little study. To date, there is no bio- fidelic Anthropomorphic Test Device (ATD) or dummy designed for rollover crashes. Researches usually use the Hybrid III dummy [1], which is designed for front impact, to represent occupants in such rollover tests. The Hybrid III dummy kinematics in a long duration rollover test cannot realistically represent that of a real human being due to the limited biofidelity. Therefore it is still a major problem to try to predict the actual kinematics of a human occupant in a rollover test based on the dummy kinematics. Most of rollover simulations still use rigid body models or dummy models to represent the occupants [2-5], although some human body models are available (MADYMO, TOYOTA), many improvements are still needed before they are widely applied and accepted. These simulations are in fact just a numerical copy of dummy tests and cannot get the actual human kinematics either. Up to the present time, only Praxi [6] has simulated two different rollover crash scenarios (soil-trip and curb-trip rollovers) using MADYMO. He found that the human body model contacted the side window 9ms prior to the head of the dummy model, in a rollover test simulation of a vehicle sliding laterally against a curb, while it was delayed by about 13ms compared to the dummy model in another rollover simulation, when the vehicle slid sideways into a gravel pit. Praxi also pointed out that "the dummy and human model kinematics cannot be transferred from one accident scenario to another". Praxl's study provides useful information about the behavior of the human body model in rollover tests. Dummy models cannot represent occupants exactly, and here is also a need for more investigations into active human movements. However, there are some limitations in Praxl's study. First, Praxi only investigated the first impact of head-to- side window within 350ms of the rollover. As a long duration event, rollover usually goes on for several seconds, and some rollovers can last more than 6 seconds. The first 350ms of a rollover test may not show the more important or more meaningful differences between the dummy model and human body model. Second, Praxi did not discuss the SAE J2114 rollover test, Although SAE J2114 rollover test is not field relevant [7] and even was removed from FMVSS (Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards) 208 [8], it is the most widely applied rollover test and the occupants may have the most drastic movements in the 1392</page><page sequence="2">compartment under high-roll conditions, which may provide important and significant differences between dummy model and human body model. For this reason, this study used SAEJ2114 dolly rollover test. Furthermore, Praxi only analysed the occupant kinematics with seat belts. The restraint system obviously has a great effect on the occupant kinematics. Without seat belts, the occupants' movements would be wider than those with seat belts, and may show more significant and more important differences between the dummy model and human body model. Also he only investigated the driver's movement of the drive leading side rollover. For the far side passenger, the occupants may possibly show other important movements, due to the geometry of lap and diagonal seat belts The aims of this study are to investigate the possible responses of a Hybrid III dummy and a human body model and to assess the effect of seat belts on occupant kinematics in a controlled rollover test of a sport utility vehicle (SUV). In this study, a SAEJ2114 dolly rollover test was reconstructed and validated in MADYMO. Based on this reconstruction, four simulations with MADYMO dummy models or MADYMO human body models, drivers and front seat passengers, with/without seat belts were compared to reach the objectives. RECONSTRUCTION AND VALIDATION OF A ROLLOVER TEST ROLLOVER TEST DESCRIPTIONS A SAE J21 14 dolly rollover test (Test No. 2553) from the NHTSA vehicle crash test database was chosen for the simulations. In this test, a 1994 Ford Explorer, containing two Hybrid III 50th percentile male dummies, was placed upon the rollover test device at 23 degrees above the horizontal and was released at 30 mph. The inflatable tubular structure (ITS) devices were inflated just prior to the start of the test. The doors were locked and the front side windows rolled down before testing. The vehicle rolled 10 quarter turns and came to rest on its roof. Due to the application of the ITS, both dummies remained in the compartment. The HIC of the driver dummy was 89 at 1687.6 to 1697.3 ms while the HIC of the passenger dummy was only 44 from 1300.75 to 1304.5ms [9]. RECONSTRUCTION OF THE ROLLOVER TEST The rollover test was reconstructed for 9 quarter-turns (3 seconds) in the MADYMO, as there was little roof intrusion (less than 1 inch) in the first 9 quarter-turns. The vehicle was a MADYMO facet model, which was converted from the public domain finite element model of a Ford Explorer, developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratories (ORNL). To further save the CPU calculation time, some unimportant parts i.e. the rear of vehicle, tyres, engine, suspension, bridges, side window glass, bumpers, transmission, etc., which did not affect the occupant kinematics, were removed. The tyres were built from solid cylindrical models to assist visual comparison. The vehicle motion was simulated from the recorded test data of the linear accelerations (longitudinal, lateral, vertical) and the rotational velocities (roll, pitch, yaw). This data was transformed from the local vehicle reference system to the inertial reference system using Euler parameters or Quaternions. Three practical factors: the gravity effect, the offset correction, and filter values were taken into consideration when the transformation from local to global coordinate data was computed. The details of the procedure, and the validation were described in [10]. The processing of the sensor outputs resulted in the vehicle kinematics in the inertial coordinate system. In this study, all the simulations used the same vehicle motion as shown in Figure 1. The upper frames were from the test video, the lower frames were the resulting simulation. The MADYMO ellipsoid model of the Hybrid III 50th percentile male dummy was used, as ellipsoid models are the most CPU-time efficient type of models. Both dummy models were put in the same initial positions as in the test as far as possible by adjusting the initial positions and angles of the dummy model's joints. The vehicle interior compartment definition was needed for evaluating the contacts between the occupants and the interior objects. Only those objects having possible contact with the occupants were required to be defined, although some objects were included for graphical viewing purposes. These objects included the seats, steering wheel, front instrument panel, and ITS as shown in Figure 2. The dimensions and locations of these objects were derived from physical measurements of a Ford Explorer. The important contacts are between the dummy models and the seat, belts and the ITS, while for other contacts such as vehicle interior (steering wheel, front instrumental panel, side window, roof, side door, windscreen, knee bolster etc.) and the ground, they can be treated as rigid bodies, as this research are to investigate the responses of a Hybrid III dummy and a human body model in rollover crashes of an SUV, and to assess the effect of seat belts on occupant kinematics in rollover events. Therefore, some contacts are not necessary to detail which would be needed for the front impact. The steering wheel, front instrument panel, which were constructed by ellipsoids and were fixed in the vehicle by bracket joints, vehicle floor, SUV vehicle surface, and the ground were considered to be infinitely stiff. The characteristics of contacts between dummy and them were determined by the properties of MADYMO dummy model. This is a commonly made reasonable assumption, because the combined stiffness of the two interacting surfaces are modelled as two springs in series, hence if one spring is say 10 times more stiff than the other, the error will only be of the order of 10%. Lager stiffness differences result in smaller errors. The seat model included the seat cushion, seat back, arm bolster, seat ramp. All these were built by ellipsoid models. Their contact properties referred to the paper of 1393</page><page sequence="3">Verver et al [11]. Each part had its own penetration-force function, friction function and hysterisis, which produce the elastic force, and the friction and damping forces respectively. The ITS's were simulated by finite element models, which were expanded with gas dynamics. The fabric skin of the ITS was modelled using membrane elements with an element size 10mm. The fabric skin of the ITS model was considered as linear elastic isotropic material. Mass density was equal to 750kg/m3. The Modulus of elasticity was 250E6 N/m2, and Poisson's ratio was 0.3. The thickness was 0.001m. All these contacts were defined and adjusted to get the correct kinematics. INJURY EVALUATION The head, neck and thorax injury criteria [12,13] were used for the injury evaluation. As these injury risk functions are developed from front and side impacts, they cannot be treated as injury prediction in rollover, nevertheless they are still valuable reference points for rollover tests. The injury severity was grouped by Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) system [14]: no injury (AIS = 0) or slight injury (AIS is 1-2) and serious to fatal injury (AIS is 3-6). The head injury risk was evaluated on the basis of Head Injury Criterion (HIC). The head injury risk curve [12,13], is P(Head Injury ) = &lt;Ä¼&gt; ln(///C1 5) ~ ^ (1 ) L CT J where is the cumulative normal distribution and can be expressed as i X 1 2 (j)(x) = -= fe ^ dt (2) V2^ i u =6.96352 and o=0. 84664 for AIS 2+ head injuries, p=7.45231 and o= 0.73998 for AIS 3+ head injuries, and p=7.65605 and o=0. 60580 for AIS 4+ head injuries. The neck injury risk can be evaluated by Ny, which is a linear combination of neck axial force and the moment about the dummy's occipital condyle. The risk of neck injury can be calculated by the following equations [12,13] 3&gt;=, 1 + 3Â»-, J &lt;3&gt; 1 + e J P(AIS &gt; 5) = (4) 1 + e J The Combined Thoracic Index (CTI), which is a combination of the maximum chest deflection and the 3 ms clip maximum value of the resultant upper spine acceleration, was used for analysing the thoracic injury risk, as injury risk curves were available. The risk of chest injury based on the CTI value can be calculated by the following equation [12,13]. P(AIS &gt; 3) = J^&lt;3ICT (5) 1 + e P(A1S&gt;S) = Â¡ + eJt_Ã­mcr, (6) VALIDATION OF THE RECONSTRUCTION The fidelity and accuracy of the dummy's kinematics were evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively. Qualitative evaluation examined the visual comparison between the test and simulation in terms of rigid body motion of the dummies, while the quantitative evaluation focused on the comparisons of the accelerations and injury values of the dummies. The motions of the dummies recorded in the test were compared to the corresponding results from the simulation. Figure 3 shows the visual comparison of the simulation and the test at a number of rollover positions. From the comparison of the motions of the arms, the heads, and the bodies, it showed that the simulated motions of the dummy occupant models was in good agreement with those of the actual Hybrid III dummies used. The comparisons of the accelerations of the test and the simulation at the locations of the head and the thorax sensors are shown in Figure 4. From the comparison, the accelerations of the driver and the passenger, both in the test and in the simulation, showed good agreement for the general trend of the curves. The peak value, peak timing and overall signal shape for the driver showed good similarity. There were however significant differences evident in the timing, and values of some of the details of the head accelerometer outputs for the passenger. The far side occupant, the passenger, had a wider movement than the driver. The impact timing of the head depended on the contacts between other body parts (the pelvis, thorax, neck) and the interior. Some small errors of these contacts in timing and values would have major effects on the outputs of the head accelerations. The injury values and injury risks are also compared in Table 1. The head and thorax show good consistency, while the neck injury values of the passenger show some differences. This is because the Ny value is determined by two parameters (axial force and the moment) and it is very difficult to keep the parameters consistent in a long duration event. Overall, however, the simulation and the test data correlated well, and the simulation provided a good approximation of the occupants' kinematics for the rollover test modelled. 1394</page><page sequence="4">Table 1 Injury Comparison TEST SIMULATION Driver Passenger Driver Passenger HIC 89 44 82 35 &lt;=5 AIS2 0.1% &lt;0.003% 0.1% &lt;0.003% lu =5 AIS2 ^ Z d ;Ã§i/ Â«i " AIS3+ &lt;0 003% &lt;0 003% &lt;0.003% &lt;0.003% N,j 0.30 0.91 0.39 0.63 RIiLÂ°f AIS3 3.7% 12.8% 4.5% 7.4% LU =Ä¼ AIS3 Z f?ÃQk oÃ­ ~ AIS5 20% 4A% 2-2% 31 % CTI 0.36 0.25 0.34 0.30 &gt;s &gt;- Â§ R'^Â°f AIS3 0.5% 0.3% 0.5% 0.4% O =5 AIS3 Z Z Piok oÃ­ H " AIS5 0 02% 0 01 % &lt;0 02% &lt;0 02% RESULTS OF SIMULATIONS Four simulations with the MADYMO dummy model or MADYMO human body model, with/without seat belts (the ITS and its contact characteristics were removed) were derived from this validated reconstruction and compared in MADYMO. Following the MADYMO recommendation, the seat belt was a combination of a standard belt model (the conventional spring belt model) with finite element parts, which allow the seat belt to slide on the occupant body in an arbitrary direction. The seat belt was modelled as a 3-point belt, of which the total elongation rate was 11%. Table 2 showed the simulation matrix. Table 2 Simulation Matrix Dummy Model Human Body Model Simulation without seat belts Simulation without seat belts Simulation with seat belts Simulation with seat belts DUMMY SIMULATION WITH SEAT BELTS Dummies Kinematics Figure 5 shows the simulation with seat belts. The seat belts kept the dummy models in the compartment with partial ejection. The movements of both dummy models were restrained although they still moved up/down, left/right relative to the compartment. The upward restraint was maintained by the lap belt and the shoulder belt constrained the motion of upper torso. There was no contact between the driver and the passenger. However, the driver and the passenger had frequent contacts with the roof and the roof rail, which could result in relatively high head accelerations. Injury Analysis Table 3 showed the values for injury criteria and the injury risks of this simulation respectively. The driver and the passenger had an extremely low risk of serious to fatal head or thorax injuries. The Ny (NCf) of 0.49 for the driver was estimated to represent a 5.6% risk of AIS 3 neck injury, a 2.6% risk of AIS 5 injury, while The Ny (NCe) of 0.28 for the passenger was estimated to represent a 3.6% risk of AIS 3 neck injury, a 1.9% risk of AIS 5 injury.

In the period 0.0s~0.775s, because of the centrifugal effects, the head of the dummy passenger was thrown out of the right side window at 0.62s. It had a contact with the window frame at 0.645s, which resulted in a relatively high acceleration. At the same time the dummy driver moved up and impacted the roof. Its left arm was thrown out of the right side window. In the period of 0.775s~1.69s, the passenger was completely ejected out of the window and contacted the ground. Its head impacted on the ground first at 0.85s followed by the whole body. The driver continued to move up until its pelvis was out of the side window. Due to centrifugal effects, it was thrown out from the side window at 1.41s and fell to the ground at the front of the vehicle. Its right shoulder contacted the ground first then the pelvis, and the head at 1.632s. From 1.69s to 3.00s, the driver and the passenger slid along the ground. The passenger stopped behind the vehicle at 2.12s, while the driver still 1395</page><page sequence="5">had a translational and rotational velocity at the end of the simulation at a time of 3.0s. Injury Analysis Table 4 showed the values for the injury criteria of this simulation and the corresponding risks of injury levels on the head, thorax and neck. The critical time for generating the potentially serious injuries was the period in which the dummy models impacted the ground. Although both dummy models were ejected completely, the injury risks were quite different. The velocity, height, direction of ejection, contact area, and contact objects determined the severity of impact and hence injury. The dummy driver was ejected upwardly with a high velocity and a large displacement, which meant that the driver had a higher risk of receiving same injury than that of the passenger. Moreover, the maximum head acceleration 85G of the driver was higher than the critical value 80G, which also meant that the driver had a high risk of experiencing facial and skull fracture.

The lap belts also played an important role of mitigating the ejection. However, the motions of the torso of the occupants were significantly different because of the shoulder belts. For the near side driver, the shoulder belt was in the correct position and efficiently restrained the outward movement of the torso, although the head still had some opportunity to move out. For the far side passenger, the initial lean and the flexibility of the spine made the shoulder belt slip away from the right shoulder. In the subsequent simulation, the shoulder belt did not constrain the torso's movement very well, although it still provided some mitigation of ejection. It increased the opportunities of impact the interior or other objects in the compartment. Injury analysis The values for the injury criteria and the corresponding injury risks of this simulation were shown in Table 5. The HIC of 579 for the driver was estimated to represent a 47% risk of AIS2 head injury, a 7% risk of AIS3 injury, and a 1.6% risk of AIS4 injury, when the driver's head passed through the side window with an impact of side window frame. While the HIC of 92.4 for the passenger was estimated to only represent a 0.2% risk of AIS 2 head injury, and a less than 0.01% risk of AIS3 injury. This meant that based on the HIC values, the passenger had an extremely low risk of head injuries of AIS 2, while the driver had high probability to receive head injuries of AIS2+. The Ny (NCf) of 0.51 for the driver was estimated to represent a 5.8% risk of AIS3 neck injury, and a 2.6% risk of AIS5 injury, while The Ny (NCf) of 0.26 for the passenger was estimated to represent a 3.4% risk of AIS3 neck injury, and a 1 .9% risk of AIS5 injury. The driver had a higher risk of neck injuries for AIS 3+ than the passenger. The driver and the passenger had a risk of 28.8%, and 1.4% of receiving AIS3 thoracic injury, respectively, and less than a 1% risk of receiving an AIS5 thoracic injury.

Both occupants had a tendency to move outward, due to the centrifugal effects. The driver moved up to the roof until its left arm was out of the side 1396</page><page sequence="6">window, which resulted in the upward movement being resisted by the shoulder against the window frame. The complete ejection of the passenger was also mitigated by the right shoulder against the window, which resulted in its head being maintained in the compartment and resulted in the neck bending. When the vehicle rotation slowed down in the period of 2.48s~3.00s, the driver moved downward a little, the head and the upper body was out of the compartment. Without any drastic change, the driver would be ejected totally. While the passenger had a tendency to move to the driver, its right arm held itself by catching the side door. There was no contact between the driver and the passenger. Injury Analysis The injuries of both occupants were analysed in Table 6. Although neither human body models were ejected totally, the driver still had some risk of receiving serious to fatal injury. Its thorax had about a 73% risk to receive an injury of AIS 3. The maximum of the head acceleration 1 1 1 G was significantly higher than the critical value 80G. It indicated that the head had a significant risk of experiencing facial injuries and skull fracture. The passenger did not show any significant possibility of experiencing serious to fatal injuries to the head, neck or thorax.

The structural differences in the neck, rib cage and spine between human body model and dummy model determine and explain why they have different kinematics, injury levels and injury risks in the same crashes. For the Hybrid III dummy, the neck is made up of metal discs, steel cables, and hard plastic spacers. The rib cage is represented by six high strength steel ribs with polymer based damping material to simulate fore-aft human chest force-deflection characteristics. The lumbar spine of the dummy is a curved polyacrylate elastomer element, molded between steel end plates [15]. The material and the structure of the neck, lumbar and thoracic spine of the dummy are significantly different to those of the human spine. To simplify the comparison, the deflection of the head/thorax, can be simply modelled as a beam in bending and can be expressed as FÃ Deflection = (?) where E is Young's modulus, I is the second moment of area about the neck/thorax axis, L is the length of the neck/thorax, F is the force acting on the neck/thorax. For the same size necks/thoraxes of a dummy and a human being, the value of E of the dummy's is larger that of the human, assuming that L and I are the same for the same size of a human being and a dummy model. When the same force acts on the head/thorax, the head/thorax of the human would have more deflection than that of the dummy. In other words, the head/thorax of a human being would travel more, and need more time to change/recovery its status, other researchers have already found such differences [16-23]. In the simulations with seat belts, when the passenger moved towards the driver, the lateral movement was constrained by the lap belt. For the dummy passenger, due to the stiff spine and stiff torso, the constraint was shifted towards the lumbar and thoracic region of the spine, so that the torso was also constrained and the seat belt did not slip off the right shoulder as shown in Figure 9. For the human passenger, because of the flexibility of human spine, the torso was not restrained as well and continued to move towards the driver. This resulted in the shoulder belt slipping off the shoulder. Consequently, the torso of human passenger in the following rollover simulation was not restrained very well and increased the opportunities for impacting the interior or other objects in the compartment. Unlike the passengers, both the dummy driver and the human driver were well restrained because of the geometry of the lap and diagonal seat belt. However, there were still some significant differences between them because of the structural differences. The dummy spine was upright, while the human spine was bent due to shoulder belt restraint. This resulted in the dummy head contacting the roof frequently, while the human head impacted the window frame frequently, and even had the opportunity to be out of the compartment. This was thought to be the reason why the human driver had higher injury risks on the head (47% of AIS2) and thorax (29% AIS3) than the dummy driver (less than 1%). 1397</page><page sequence="7">The case without restraints is shown in Figure 10, the outward movement of the passenger included two motions, the lateral movement and the upward movement. Because of the flexibility of the human spine in the human body model, the lateral movement of the human passenger was delayed compared to that of the dummy passenger. This meant that the human passenger moved up more than the dummy, but also moved to the right a little. Whereas the human passenger had already moved up and impacted the roof before the head arrived at the side window. The human passenger moved up until its neck contacted the roof rail, which prevented it from complete ejection. While for the dummy passenger, the head passed through the side window, and the whole body was ejected completely. Although the ejected dummy passenger did not show any higher risk of experiencing serious to fatal injuries than the human passenger, the ejection would result in contusion and abrasions to the whole body, and also increased the risk of impacting with other objects, such as other vehicles, trees, curbs etc. in real world crashes. The drivers also tried to move outward and showed the structural differences between the dummy and the human body. When the driver's head contacted the roof rail, the force was transferred to the upper body with a force and a moment shown in Figure 10. For the dummy driver, because of the rigidity of the neck, the forces and the moments were larger than those for the human driver. This forced the dummy driver to be rotated towards the passenger, whereas the human driver continued to move outward until the shoulder contacted the window frame, which prevented it from ejection. DISCUSSION HUMAN BODY MODEL Although the human body model has been validated both on the segment and full body level with volunteer and PMHS test data, and showed good agreement under some limited conditions [24], the joints and soft tissues such as ligaments, muscles, fat, skin and internal organs have non-linear anisotropic characteristics and strain rate dependency. Therefore, the model needs more validation for a variety of impact conditions. The human body model is developed from PHMS tests, which do not have the muscle action and consciousness of living humans in crashes. Also the human body model has not been validated in rollover tests. The initial use of the human body models is for frontal impact scenarios where some joints do not rotate through 90 degrees, and this does not consider the complex kinematics in rollover crash. Some joint restraints, which are used to define the actual human joints ranges of rotations, would terminate the simulation for rollover crashes. Such a situation can affect the occupant kinematics. Therefore, to some extent, the human body model can provide some insights on actual human occupant kinematics in rollover, but still needs more development. MUSCULAR ACTIVATION Depending on the level of muscular activation, the human muscle is capable of generating a range of bending stiffness's. In a real world crash, the human muscular neck and spine may have a much higher bending stiffness when occupants brace themselves for the impending collision. Such action can affect the occupant kinematics, and even the injury severity. However, King et al. [25] thought, "the lack of muscle tone is not a serious drawback because muscular response usually occurs too late to affect body kinematics in a crash". This may apply for front impacts. However, for rollover crashes, which are much longer duration events, the effects may be different. SEAT BELTS The slack, pretensioner and the position of seat belts are all important factors that may affect the kinematics in rollover crashes. This study did not consider the effects of seat belt slack and pretentioner of seat belts. With different slack and pretentioners, the occupants may have significantly different movements, injury severity and risks. Although the exact results are not predictable in detail, the tendency should be: that the more the slack, the less restraints and the higher injury risk; the more pretension, the more restraints and the lower injury risk; the better the position of the seat belts, the more restraints and the lower injury risk. ROOF INTRUSION In these simulations, the vehicle was considered as a rigid body without any deformation and roof intrusion. Intruding surfaces can change the occupant contact locations, body shape or stiffness, the contact acceleration, and even the injury level [26]. Researchers had not found a relationship between roof crush and head/neck injury [27-30]. Although Chirwa et al [31] considered that there is a causal relationship between roof intrusion and injuries sustained by occupants by re- investigating the Malibu I and II rollover tests. However, neck injury is determined not only by the loading and roof crush acceleration, but also by the relative position, angles and acceleration between the head and the body. If without the body inertial, the force on the head due to roof intrusion cannot be transferred to the neck. Therefore, when considering the relationship between the neck injury and roof intrusion, the neck cannot be isolated from the body. Neither "diving theory" nor "roof intrusion theory" ignores the system of head, neck and body. Although the neck is the vulnerable part, neck injuries in rollover crashes are not high, as rollover is a complicated and chaotic event and many factors can affect the kinematics and injuries of the body system. In fact, statistical analysis indicates that neck injury only account for 5% of AIS 3+ injuries in rollover crashes [32]. The likelihood of injury in a rollover accident may increase as the roof intrusion increases. However, in this study it was observed that there is no significant roof 1398</page><page sequence="8">intrusion in the first three seconds of the selected test. Also, even in the real test, the HIC value was only 89 for the driver dummy, and 44 for the passenger dummy. This only represented less than 0.1% head injury risk of AIS2. VEHICLE MOVEMENT In rollover crashes, the kinematics of the vehicle and the occupants can affect each other. Occupants' motions have an effect on the mass distribution of the vehicle- occupant system, and can change the vehicle motion. Equally, the vehicle motion also affects the occupant movements. The eight simulations shown here used the same vehicle movement. Therefore, the occupants' movements derived from the test probably were not exactly the same as actual ones, but the errors are considered to be small due to the mass ratio between the vehicle and the occupants. The ratio of the mass of two dummies (154kg) to the vehicle mass (1729.5kg) was about 8.9%, and so it is considered that the simulations using the same vehicle motion are still reasonable. INJURY EVALUATION Injury criteria in this study is borrowed from front and side impact. However, rollover crashes are long-duration events (approximately 30 times as long as a front impact), and so the occupants are potentially exposed to numerous repeated contacts with the vehicle structure. Obviously, the pulse duration is one of the important factors for rollover crashes. Therefore, the HIC, Ny, CTI values based on the maximum pulse may not be good indexes to evaluate the injuries in rollover crash. However, these values still have some valuable reference and to a certain extent reflect injury severity. CONCLUSIONS In this study, a SAE2114 dolly rollover test was reconstructed and validated. Four simulations with MADYMO dummy model or MADYMO human body model, with/without seat belts were derived from this validated reconstruction and compared in MADYMO. The occupant models showed different kinematics in these simulations. The structural differences between human and dummy models explain their different kinematics, injury levels and injury risks in the simulations. The Hybrid III dummy has a stiffer neck, a stiffer rib cage and a stiffer spine than a human being. These differences highlight the poor ability of the dummy to reproduce occupant kinematics in rollover crashes, and the injury level and injury risk. Consequently, they significantly affect the corresponding countermeasure design. From the simulations with seat belts, it was found that when the pelvis of a dummy model was restrained by lap belt, the constraint might be shifted towards the lumbar and thoracic region of the spine quickly, so that the torso was also constrained and the shoulder belt did not slip off the dummy shoulder, due to the rigidity of dummy model. While for the human body model, the upper body continued to move laterally due to the flexibility of the spine, so that the shoulder belt slipped off the shoulder. Consequently, the torso of human body model in the following rollover crash possibly was not restrained very well and increased the opportunities of impacting the interior or other objects in the compartment. This effect of the seat belt geometry needs considering in the case of real-world rollover crashes. If such a rollover test using dummy model with seat belt is performed, it may result in the wrong conclusion that the seat belt also constrains human occupants very well in rollover, without considering the differences between the dummy and human being. Similar differences between dummy model and human body model were also found in the simulation without any restraints. The dummy occupants were thrown out while human occupants stayed in the compartment. The flexibility of the human spine and human neck mitigated the ejection. The flexibility of the human spine made the human upper body move up more and resulted in the neck contacting the roof rail, which prevented it from ejection. The flexibility of human neck made the shift of the forces from the roof acting on the human head to the thorax being smaller than that on the dummy head. It did not force the human body to rotate, and the human body continued to move outward until the shoulder contacted the window frame, which prevented it from ejection. Seat belts restrained the occupant movement to be in a small range and mitigated against complete ejection. The lap belt made a good contribution to restraining the upward and lateral movements of the pelvis and even the whole body, especially the upward movement, which decreased the opportunities of head impact to roof. The shoulder belt provided upper body restraints, especially in the longitudinal direction and particularly for the driver. As the shoulder belt slipped off the upper body of the human passenger in the simulation it still had a wide movement, which increased the opportunities of impacts with the interior and other objects. Even if the shoulder belt was in a good position, the occupants still had chance of side window and B pillar impacts, which could result in relative high acceleration on the head, neck and thorax. It showed that the seat belts restrained the movement of occupants but did not cushion the impact. With serious impacts of head or thorax to the side window, side door, the occupants still had high risks of serious to fatal injuries. The geometry of seat belts needs further consideration for the protection of occupants in rollover crashes.
