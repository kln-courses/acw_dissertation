<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mark Cioc, The Rhine: an eco-biography, 1815-2000 (Chesham: University of Washington Press, 2002. Pp. xiv + 263. ?22.95) This book represents a momentous venture and aims to create a new genre: an eco-biography. Cioc traces the history of the Rhine as his 'hero' over almost two centuries bringing together environmental economic, political, and cultural perspectives. Its story is largely one of regulation, domestication, re-engineering, exploitation, and degradation. After setting out his general intentions in the introduction, Cioc presents the Rhine in the second chapter in hydrological, biological, and geographical perspective. The starting point is the Congress of Vienna in 1815, at which the Rhine was placed under an international regime. But the early nineteenth century not only produced a new territorial map for Europe, it also gave birth to new approaches in economic doctrine, as reflected @ Economic History Society 2003</page><page sequence="2">580 BOOK REVIEWS in a liberalization of Rhine shipping from 1831 onwards, and in river engineering. Fundamental to this new river engineering, Cioc's principal villain, was the idea that rivers needed to be improved by man to render them more useful and less dangerous to riparian inhabitants. In this vein Johann Tulla, in charge of water engineering in the new state of Baden, developed his far-reaching proposals to 'rectify' the Upper Rhine in the 1810s, in order to prevent flooding and create more agricultural land. His approach to modifying the river course became paradigmatic for river engineering in the nineteenth century and for much of the twentieth. In the third chapter Cioc shows how this regulation was carried out over the entire length of the Rhine and points out the dramatic and long-term environ- mental effects this had on the river, substantially shortening its course, increasing flow speed, lowering the water table, and practically eliminating the former flood plains, including some 3,000 islands. Engineering measures frequently necessitated further intervention, such as building flood defences because the flood hazard had been transferred downstream as floodplains disappeared. Next Cioc emphasizes the fundamental significance of the Rhine for the coal basin of the Ruhr and the Lower Rhine. He demonstrates the profound hydrolog- ical changes to the Rhine and its tributaries brought about by coal mining and related industries. Here as well as in the fifth chapter which concentrates on the chemical industry and its polluting effects, economic history is blended with environmental history. The consequences to the Rhine as an aquatic habitat are analysed in Chapter 7, where the radical decrease in the number of species in and along the river and the deteriorating water quality are stressed. From the nadir in terms of biodiversity and water quality, reached in the early 1970s, the Rhine made an astonishing recovery, based on more efficient international measures to reduce polluting effluents and the massive decline of coal mining. But despite clearly improving water quality, a significant rise in the number of species, and new approaches to river-engineering by recreating floodplains, there is no prospect that the Rhine will be restored in the near future to its condition at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Cioc's book demonstrates a mastery of many fields outside mainstream history and is based on extensive reading of primary and secondary sources in German, Dutch, and French as well as English. It is engagingly written and the author's anger about what happened to the Rhine shows through clearly, but at times he seems to underestimate the priorities of contemporaries. The voices we hear are mostly those of the elite: leading scientists, industrialists, politicians, engin- eers. The common people do not feature prominently in this book, although this is perhaps a minor criticism in view of the time-span and complexity of the subject. But occasionally one would have wished to learn more about local and regional dissent and about early environmental movements, even if they were not successful at that time. Cioc has clearly produced an excellent book, which will be the standard reference on the Rhine in environmental history in English for many years to come, but a final question remains about the concept of an 'eco-biography': how we can actually write a 'biography' of a river? In many chapters the passive 'suffering' of the Rhine dominates, but in the conclusion Cioc, when talking about its tendency to 'recoup every hectare of floodplain, as if it possessed a memory of its former contours' (p. 206) clearly uses anthropomorphic metaphors.
