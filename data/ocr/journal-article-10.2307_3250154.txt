First, the rich body of art-historical, architectural, and epigraphical material'at Sanchi and neighboring monastic sites attests to a sequence of Buddhist occupation from around the third century BCE to the twelfth century CE .I Second, the famous Heliodorus pillar site at the nearby city ofVidisha illustrates the local prominence of the Pancaratra system of the Bhagavata cult from around the second century BCE, or possibly earlier.2 A strong local Vaisnava presence continues in later years, reaching a climax during the Gupta period as illustrated by the sculptural program at Udayagiri (fig. I).3 Finally, the Sanchi area is also home to an important group of early naga and yaksa sculptures which, together with vari- ous stiIupa railing carvings and donative inscriptions at Sanchi, have been used to infer the prominence of these cults in the region.4 Despite a long history of archaeological, art-historical, and epigraphical research in the area, little is known about how these religious traditions related to one other.5 Further, despite various textual references to the links between Vidisha, Sanchi, and the Mauryan empire, there is still little integration between the study of local religious history and that of wider processes such as urbanization and state formation.6 Finally, the aforementioned sites are usually studied in isolation from lesser known archaeological remains in the surrounding countryside. These lacunae reflect, in part, the traditional "monumental" and site-based focus of Indian archaeology, which until recently has profited little from theoretical shifts within the wider discipline of archaeology, such as the recog- I Cunningham I854; Marshall et al. 1940; Willis 2000. 2 Also known as Besnagar, after the village Bes, which occupies a key position amidst the ancient city mounds.

Sanchi is described in these texts as Cetiya- giri or Vedisagiri, the setting of the "beautiful monastery" to which Queen Devi accompanies her son, Mahinda, dur- ing his visit to Vidisha. Asoka's marriage to a local woman demonstrates Vidisha's prominence within the pan-Indian political scene, but also alludes to its importance in the pre-Mauryan period; the character of the town during this period, however, remains largely unknown. This stems primarily from uncertainties over the chronology of North- ern Black Polished Ware and other early ceramics, but also because the nature of the transition between the Chalco- lithic and early-historic period has not yet been understood. Further problems arise from the fact that the urban sequence at Vidisha has not been related to settlement patterns in the rural hinterland. 5</page><page sequence="2">nition of entire landscapes as foci of archaeological enquiry.7 This paper calls for an approach which combines the methods of art-historical analysis with those developed in "landscape archaeology," examining sculptures not as isolated objects of enquiry, but as components of multifaceted cultural landscapes.8 To this end, this paper introduces a group of sixteen sculptures documented by the author during a multiphase archaeological survey carried out over approximately 750 square kilometers around Sanchi (fig. i and Appendix).9 Aimed at situating the monuments at Sanchi within their wider archaeologi- cal landscape, and relating religious changes during the late centuries BCE to other key processes such as urbanization, state formation, and agricultural innovations, the survey resulted in the systematic recording of about 35 Buddhist sites, I45 settlements, 17 irrigation works, and over I,000ooo sculptures.10 Of the latter, sixteen sculptures ranging in date between the first century BCE and the fifth century CE were chosen for discussion here." Twelve of these may be described as nagas ("snake deities") or naginTs, their female counterparts. Each is shown in human form, with the body of a snake coiling up the back and a multiheaded snake canopy over the head. There is some sectarian diversity within this broad naga category: at least four of the earliest ndgas appear to follow the iconographic program of Balarama-Samkarsana, one of the chief deities of the Pifancaratra system of the Bhagavata tradition, a prototypical form of Vaisnavism; one of the later ndgas is shown as Visnu himself; and others display an increasing orientation towards Vaisnava iconography. The thirteenth sculpture in the group, dat- able to around the first century CE, is not a naga but is included here because it appears to depict Balarama-Samkarsana in his non-serpent form, and thus is related to the four Balarama-nagas. Also published here for the first time are two second-century-CE Sivalingas and a yaksa figure, the latter stored in the Vidisha Archaeological Museum. The principal aim of this study is to describe these sculptures, focusing on style, chronology, and iconography, the context being provided by a smaller group ofndga sculptures discussed in an earlier study by Joanna Williams.I2 I will also examine their temporal and spatial position within the 750- 7 For theory and methodology of landscape archaeology, see Ucko and Layton 1999; for recent developments in South Asia, see Harding, in press; Shaw, in press-b. 8 A rare example of this kind of approach is Hans Bakker's (I986; 1997) pioneering work on the religious and political history ofAyodhya and Ramtek, which, while not necessarily drawing from principles developed in landscape archaeo- logy, applies a "synthetic method of investigation" to philological, art-historical, and archaeological sources within their geographical setting. 9 All previously unpublished, with the exception of the Chandna and Morel Kala nagas (Shaw and Sutcliffe 2003a, 68-69, figs.

The survey has continued in sub- sequent years as part of a collaborative project between the Madhya Pradesh Directorate of Archaeology, Archives, and Museums (Bhopal) and the Vidisha Research Group (http://www.britac.ac.uk/institutes/SSAS/vidishareport. html).

Most of the naga sculptures discussed here are located on top of or close to ancient dams, for which they provide terminus ante quem dates.13 As discussed in detail elsewhere, these dams appear to have been built for the irrigation of downstream crops as a response to increased population levels brought about by the proliferation of urban centers and Buddhist monasteries during the early-his- toric period.14 The relative configuration of dams, Buddhist sites, and habitational settlements has also provided an empirical basis for suggesting parallels with systems of monastic landlordism in Sri Lanka, where the sangha's management of irrigation facilities was a key factor in the development of exchange networks between monastic and lay sections of society. The positioning of naga sculptures on the banks of these irrigation tanks accords with the naga's role as an agricultural deity believed to have the abil- ity to regulate the forces of nature: similar patterns found throughout South Asia accord with textual accounts of the worship of nagas for rainmaking purposes.15 This association also provides clues as to the possible identity of the dams' patrons; my argument, briefly introduced in an earlier paper but developed further here, is that the sculptures doubled as symbols of the local Naga clan, whose polit- ical prominence in the Sanchi area is attested by numismatic and epigraphic evidence.,6 The nagas' position within the wider archaeological complex also sheds important light on inter- religious dynamics, and we may now address questions such as whether the relative positioning of nagas and Buddhist sites fits with current models of religious change regarding the dynamics between the sangha and "local" agricultural cults. Iconographic and stylistic trends within the regional sculptural dataset also raise important questions about the relationship between the history of the naga cult and Vaisnavism. What, for example, was the sectarian link between the first-century-B C E Balarama-naga images and the Panficaratra system as represented by the Heliodorus pillar and associated sculpture at Vidisha? How did both of these traditions relate to later developments in Vaisnava theology, such as the Avatara system as represented by the Gupta sculptural program at nearby Udayagiri ? This paper is divided into three parts. Part I provides a historical and theoretical context for under- standing the sculptural dataset, which is described in part II. It includes a summary of the main cur- rents in local political and religious history, drawing largely on available epigraphical, art-historical, and archaeological sources. In part III, the sculptures' position within the wider archaeological land- scape will be used to assess theories of religious change and patronage in the Sanchi area. 13 Shaw and Sutcliffe 200I.

EARLY RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL HISTORY OF THE SANCHI-VIDISHA AREA The Pan-Indian Dynastic Framework According to most historical accounts of central India, the period between the third century BCE and the fifth century CE is divided into four main phases: Mauryan (ca. third century BCE), post-Mauryan or "Sunga" (ca. second to first century BCE), Satavahana-Ksatrapa (ca. first to fourth century CE), and Gupta (ca. fourth to sixth century CE). This historical framework is useful for contextualizing the sculptural material discussed in this paper. However, as we shall see below, it is important to temper these broad dynastic categories with more localized power structures. The earliest inscriptional evidence in the area is the Asokan pillar at Sanchi, which provides a time frame of ca. 269-232 B C E for the first Buddhist monuments there.I7 The earliest urban phase at nearby Vidisha has also been dated to the Mauryan period on the basis of Northern Black Polished Ware dis- covered in the city ramparts.18 Whilst many of the fortified capitals in the Gangetic valley had already reached a level of urbanism by the sixth century BCE, Vidisha, along with other central Indian sites such as Eran, Tumain, and Pawaya, belonged to a somewhat later phase of urbanization. Although the intertwined histories of Buddhism and urbanization in this area appear to have coincided, in part, with the expansion of the Mauryan empire from its epicenter in the Gangetic valley, the precise nature of this relationship is still open to question. In recent years, for example, it has been suggested that the Mauryan empire was considerably less centralized than implied by the distribution of Asokan edicts, and that just as significant as the state in the forging of pan-Indian political and economic unity, was the expansion of heterodox religious institutions such as Buddhism and Jainism.19 In most historical accounts, the period following the dissolution of the Mauryan empire around 232 B CE is referred to as the uniga period. This name is largely based on textual accounts that describe Pusyamitra Sunga as the successor to the Mauryan empire. Although Pataliputra was retained as the state capital, Vidisha is thought to have played a significant role, first as the residence of Pusyamitra's son and viceroy, Agnimitra,20 and later as the gunga capital, following the Indo-Greek invasion of Pataliputra.21 Vidisha's link with the Sungas is further attested by two inscriptions from here. The first is the Heliodorus pillar inscription, the most important epigraphical marker in the area after the Asokan inscription at Sanchi.22 Closely linked with the Pancaratra system of the Bhagavata tradition, 17 Marshall et al. 1940, 287. It should be noted, however, that suggestions for a pre-Mauryan, "pre-monumental" phase of Buddhism in the area are provided by the frequent occurrence of prehistoric shelters at Buddhist sites that show evidence of having been re-used as monastic dwellings (Shaw, in press-a; forthcoming). I8 Unfortunately, apart from several summarized versions in the Indian Archaeological Review (1963-64, 16-17; I964-65, I8; I965-66, 23; I975-76, 30-3I; I976-77, 33-34), the excavations here have not been formally published. I9 Such a view is supported by a growing body of evidence, both textual and archaeological, for the sangha's active involve- ment in trade (Smith 2001, 32) as well as agrarian production (Gunawardana I979; Shaw and Sutcliffe 2003a; 2003b; 2001). 20 Kalidasa's Malavikdgnimitra, verse 370. 21 Sircar I969, 59-60. 22 For references, see note 2. 8</page><page sequence="5">it records the erection of a Garuda pillar by Heliodorus of Taxila, an ambassador of the Indo-Greek king Antialcidas; coins found in the northwest and bearing the latter's name provide a time frame of ca. II5-80 BCE.23 The inscription also mentions the local ruler, King Bhagabadra, who is usually identified as the fifth ruler of the Puranic list often Sunga kings.24 The second inscription from Vidisha refers to the construction of a Bhagavata temple by King Bhagavata, generally identified as the ninth Sunfga king of that name.25 There are, however, many uncertainties surrounding the Sunigas, largely due to the paucity of supporting epigraphical evidence for such a dynasty.26 Further, the nature of the "state" at this time remains somewhat obscure. That it may have been less centralized than tradi- tionally assumed is suggested by the distribution of tribal coins bearing the names of what appear to have been autonomous city-states.27 The two most important series are those bearing the names Bhag- ila and Kurara, both of which appear to have been urban sites in the Vidisha area.28 These suggest that even if the Sungas ruled from Vidisha, their authority may only have been of a titular nature. During the third major phase, from the first to the fourth century CE, control of central and west- ern India oscillated back and forth between the Satavahanas and their long-standing rivals, the west- ern Ksatrapas. Copper coins from Vidisha, Ujjain, and Eran bearing the name .ri Satakarni (or sim- ply Sata) show that by the first century CE, this part of central India had already been incorporated into the Satavahana empire, with its base in the Deccan.29 The same name is also mentioned in the inscription on the top architrave of the southern gateway at Sanchi.30 The inscription of Rudradaman atJunagadh shows that the Satavahanas had been temporarily ousted by the Ksatrapas during the sec- ond century CE.3I By the mid-third century CE, the Sanchi-Vidisha area had also come under Ksa- trapa rule, as demonstrated by coins found here bearing the name Rudrasena II (ca. 255-278).32 That the Ksatrapas were still in control of the area as late as the late fourth century CE is attested by the well inscription from Kanakherha village on the lower saddle of Sanchi hill.33 The inscription describes the construction of a well by the Saka chief and "righteous conqueror" (dharma-vijayi) Mahadandanayaka Sridharavarman. As will be discussed later, the same ruler is mentioned, alongside 23 Bopearachchi I989, 63-64, no. 40I. 24 Sircar I965, 88, no. 2. 25 Bhandarkar I9I4, I90; Chanda I920, 152. The temple is described as the "excellent temple" (prasadottama) of the Bha- gavata, the latter being thought to correspond to Vasudeva-Krsna, the principle deity of the Bhagavata tradition. 26 In this respect, mention should be made of the inscription from Bharhut that refers to Dhanabhuti of the Sunga king- dom (Sircar I965, i, 87; Majumdar and Pusalker I954, 95-98). 27 Bopearachchi and Pieper 998, 35. 28 Willis 2000, 59. 29 A recent revision of Satavahana chronology is given in Cribb 2000. 30 Marshall et al. 1940, 342, inscrip. 398. Numismatists are now in general agreement that the king in question is gatakarni I, who ruled in the Malwa area from around 25 CE, and not SaIitakarni II, or the later Gautamiputra gatakarni I (Cribb 2000). 31 Sircar 1969, 67. 32 Jha and Rajgor I992, 38; 7I. 33 Sircar I965, I86-187; Mirashi I955a; Marshall et al. 1940, 392-393, inscrip. 839. This date follows Majumdar and Pusalker's (I954,47) reading of the Saka year given in the inscription as 241 (3I8/I9 CE), as opposed to Banerji (I92I- I922), who read it as 201 (279 CE). 9</page><page sequence="6">his Naga military commander, in an inscription from Eran.34 This evidence helps to strengthen the view that Kusana rule, which covered most of the Gangetic valley and the northwest during this time, did not extend into this part of central India; several Kusana-style images from Mathura have been found at Sanchi, but none appear to be local products.35 By contrast, many of the sculptures documented in the surrounding countryside during the Sanchi survey, including some of the nagas described in this paper, are closely related to the typical Kusana style at Mathura. However, this merely attests to the spread of pan-Indian artistic idioms rather than to the actual political control of the Kusana dynasty. The fourth major phase covers the period from the fourth to the sixth century CE, towards the beginning of which the Ksatrapas were defeated by the Guptas. Samudragupta's (ca. 33$-37$ CE) Allahabad pillar inscription alludes to the subjugation of gaka Mahaksatrapa Rudrasena III during the mid-fourth century CE, while his Eran inscription attests to the conquest of eastern Malwa.36 However, the Gupta's victory over the western part of the Ksatrapa dominions, including the Sanchi- Vidisha area, did not take place until the reign of Chandragupta II (ca. 376-412 CE). The main evidence for this is the cave 4 inscription at Udayagiri, GE 82(400-401 CE), which records the com- mission of the shrine by Sabaravirasena, minister of Chandragupta II.37 The Guptas' support of Brahmanism, particularly Vaisnavism, was a major factor influencing the changing configuration of the ritual landscape during this period. The Naga Clan While the foregoing summary helps to place Vidisha's political history within a broad dynastic frame- work, relatively little is known about how these pan-Indian forces played out at a local level. The afore- mentioned Bhagila and Kurara series coins indicate that from around the second century BCE local tribal leaders were issuing their own city coins, but the position of these rulers within the larger polit- ical arena is unclear. Similar uncertainties surround the Naga dynasty, which from at least the second century CE appears to have been one of the most prolific coin-issuers at Vidisha; large hoards of tiny copper Naga coins have been retrieved from the ancient city mounds.38 Analyses of these coins, and other numismatic, epigraphical, and textual evidence, have led to the suggestion that the dynasty orig- inated during the second half of the second century CE in Vidisha, from where it moved north to 34 Mirashi I955b. 35 These include a seated Bodhisattva figure whose inscription, written in Kusana Brahmi and dated to the year 28, records a gift during the reign of King Vasiska (Marshall et al. 1940, 387-388, inscrip. 828, pl. 124b; Hamid et al. I922, no. A82). Following recent revisions of the Kusana era (Willis 2000, 269-270), this cap now be viewed as year I28 (ca. 228-253 CE). Three other images carved from Mathura sandstone have been found at Sanchi. One of these bears an inscription dated to the year 22 (ca. 222-247 CE) and mentions a king called Vaskusana, thought to be a member of the Kusana dynasty (Marshall et al. 1940, 386, inscrip. 829, pi. 10o5c; Hamid et. al. 1922, no. A83). The other two Mathura images, a Bodhisattva and a Buddha, were found deposited in late- or post-Guptastupas (Marshall et al. I940, 387, inscrip. 830; 47, pi. Io0b). 36 Sircar I965, 268-270; Bhandarkar I98I. 37 Fleet i888a; Sircar I969, 271-272. 38 Bhandarkar 1914, 2Io-2II. These coins continue to be collected and sold by farmers. IO</page><page sequence="7">Mathura, Pawaya, and Kantipurya, the three major Niaga centers mentioned in the Visnu Purana.39 That it may have been connected with the Vidisha area during earlier periods is suggested by the high number of Naga-related names in the first-century-BCE donative inscriptions at Sanchi. 40 I also sug- gest that the naga sculptures in the area doubled as symbols of the Naga clan and, in particular, their patronage of major irrigation projects in the area.41 Although the Nagas' later history is relatively well attested from indirect references in Gupta and Vakataka inscriptions, how they related chronologically or politically to earlier pan-Indian dynasties such as the Ksatrapas is less clear. Preliminary insights have been provided by an inscription from Eran, which mentions the Saka chief Mahadandanayaka Sridharavarman, also the subject of the Kana- kherha well inscription at Sanchi. The object of the Eran inscription is to record the erection of a memorial pillar (yasti) by ridharavarman's military commander (senapati), a Naga chief from Maha- rashtra called Satyanaga.42 This reference supports the image of the Nagas as a powerful oligarchy, with family ties extending far beyond the Vidisha-Eran orbit and close allegiances to the Ksatrapa authority. Later inscriptions provide clear evidence that the Nagas' political clout came to be seen as a threat to Gupta authority. It is ironic, for example, that although the inscriptions of Samudragupta (3 50-376 CE) and Skandagupta at Allahabad and Junagadh respectively are primarily concerned with record- ing their victory over the Ksatrapas, the most dramatic language of subjugation is reserved for the Nagas. Samudragupta's inscription refers to the "uprooting singly and in a moment" and the " forcible extermination" of sections of the Naga dynasty.43 It has been suggested that the three Naga kings men- tioned by name, Achyuta, Nagasena, and Ganapati, had been part of a coalition aimed at removing Samudragupta from power. In Bhandarkar's words, that the formation of this confederacy was a great menace to the Gupta power and that its destruc- tion was consequently regarded as the greatest ofSamudragupta's military feats is inferred from the fact that this achievement alone has been described in the verse portion with which the Alla- habad pillar inscription begins.44 39 Scholars are divided, however, as to whether in the Puranas the word nava refers to the "nine" Naga rulers (Trivedi I957) or to the three "new" houses at Mathura, Kantipurya, and Pawaya, as opposed to the older, aforementioned lin- eage at Vidisha (Bhandarkar I98I, zo-2I). 40 Hitherto these have been interpreted solely within a religious framework, being seen as evidence for the strong influence of local cultic practice in the area (Schopen 1996; Misra 1981). Such an approach illustrates the general dis- location between the study of religious and political history in South Asia. There are also suggestions that the Nandin kings who succeeded the so-called "gunigas" had Naga affiliations (Bhandarkar I98I, Io). 41 Shaw and Sutcliffe 2oo003a. 42 Mirashi I955b.

II</page><page sequence="8">There are also epigraphical allusions to the defeat of the Nagas' allies, the Vakatakas, leading to their forcible relocation from their original territory in Bundelkhand to Nandivardhana in the Deccan.45 However, that the continued enmity of these two subjugated dynasties was considered too dangerous a threat to political stability is suggested by the Guptas' concerted efforts to maintain peaceful links between the three houses. This three-way confederacy was consolidated by the marriage between Samudragupta's son, Chandragupta II, and the Naga Princess Kuberanaga, who had been raised in Samudragupta's court.46 Their daughter, Prabhavati, later became a powerful independent ruler following the premature death of her husband, the Vakataka prince Rudrasena II.47 Although the Guptas clearly kept the upper hand in this alliance, Prabhavati's mixed political and familial alle- giances were instrumental in ensuring the political standing of her Naga relatives back in the Vidisha area.48 For instance, the marriage between her daughter and her half-brother, Ghatotkaca, the viceroy in Vidisha, during the reign of her other brother, Kumaragupta (4I5-454 CE), ensured that by the time the latter's illegitimate son, Skandagupta (455-467 CE), came to the throne, the three-way ties of the Gupta-Naga-Vakataka alliance remained intricately intermeshed.49 This alliance may have influenced the battle for the throne between Skandagupta and his uncle Ghatotkaca, and the result- ing split between the western and eastern halves of the Gupta empire. o50 Bakker writes that during this conflict, "the Guptas [at Vidisha] may have been supported by Naga feudatories who hadn't yet for- gotten their defeat by Samudragupta and were biding their time."5, This would have led to the re- enforcement of the "old Vakataka-Vidisa-Naga axis," the Nagas here being Ghatotkaca's allies rather than his adversaries, as assumed by earlier writers.52 According to Bakker, there are strong allusions to these developments in the Junagadh inscription, which describes Skandagupta as he "who forged an order with an effigy, namely Garuda, which rendered devoid of poison the serpent rulers [i.e. the Nagas] who uplifted their hoods in pride and arrogance."53 On a religious level, the reference to Garuda, the traditional slayer of serpents, is a clear pun on the Gupta's strong Vaisnava allegiances and the long-standing relationship of ambivalence between Visnu and nagas.54 On a political level, though, it seems that the Nagas, once again, had become a force to be reckoned with. These epi- 45 For recent views on this subject, see Bakker 2002. 46 As described in the Vakataka inscription of Kevala Narasimha Temple on Ramtek Hill (Bakker 1997, appendix I, v. 5). 47 Bakker I997, I. 48 Bakker 2002, I-3. 49 Bhandarkar I98Ib; according to Bakker (1997, 7), this probably took place between Chandragupta's death (415 CE) and Damodarasena's succession to the throne (4I9 CE). 50 Ghatotkaca is known from the Tumain inscription of 435-436 CE and two gold coins (Bakker 1997, 26; Bhandarkar I98Ib; Bhandarkar I98Ic). 5I Bakker 2002, I7. 52 CII, 3, 8I; Bakker 2002, n. 62. 53 Bhandarkar I98Id, 299, 302 (Fleet I888b). 54 E.g., in the Bhagavata Purana, Garuda, the symbol of birth and light, slays the serpent Kaliya, the epitome of dark- ness and poison. However, "Visnu combines both of these symbols within himself for he sleeps on the serpent of eter- nity (Ananta or gesa - the good alter ego of the evil Kiliya) and then awakens to ride on the Garuda bird" (O'Flaherty 1975, 22I). I2</page><page sequence="9">graphical sources provide a useful political context for explaining the "royal" attributes of the Gupta- period ndga sculptures in the Sanchi area, which I argue may have embodied references to the local Naga rulers. Buddhism in the Sanchi Area The earliest religious monuments in the Sanchi area belong to the Buddhist tradition. The establish- ment, or at least the monumentalization, of Buddhism is datable to around the third century BCE, on the basis of the Asokan inscription and related monuments at Sanchi.55 There are also suggestions of a Mauryan phase at nearby Satdhara, one of the four outlying sites first documented in the nineteenth century by Alexander Cunningham, and recently taken up for renewed investigations.56 Significantly, while the establishment of Buddhism at Sanchi was closely connected with state patronage, it was somewhat later, toward the end of the second century CE, that Buddhist monasteries began to appear throughout the surrounding landscape, funded by extensive programs of collective patronage by powerful families and guilds throughout central India.57 Sanchi and Satdhara were greatly elaborated during this "second propagation," while the three other Buddhist sites documented by Cunningham - Sonari, Morel-khurd, and Andher, all situated within a fifteen-kilometer radius of Sanchi - appear to have been established during this phase.58 Most of the thirty-five Buddhist sites documented dur- ing the Sanchi survey belong to this second phase of Buddhist expansion. Buddhist remains such as stupas and and animal capitals datable to around the second century BCE were also found within habita- tional settings.59 Thus, the spread of a pan-Indian artistic style into "interior" areas appears to have been directly linked to the onset of Buddhist building programs during this time: the only evidence for stone sculpture in these areas prior to the first century BCE is found within monastic settings or at urban stupas or shrines with a strong link to Buddhism. This point suggests that the growth of the patronage base of Buddhism between the third and second centuries BCE was closely related to the increasingly urban character of settlements in the area. The material at Sanchi indicates an unbroken tradition of Buddhist activity up to the eleventh or twelfth centuries CE, with major construction peri- ods taking place around the fifth, seventh, and tenth centuries. However, there is little evidence at interior sites for ongoing occupation during the post-Gupta period. By the ninth or tenth century, the proliferation of Brahmanical temples, often within or close to monastic complexes, attests to the dimin- ishing influence of the sangha, and to a major reorientation in the focus of religious patronage. The Bhagavata Cult The other major religious tradition during the late centuries BCE is the Pancaratra system of the Bha- gavata tradition as represented by the Heliodorus pillar site at Vidisha. Datable to the late second cen- tury BCE following the chronology of Antialcidas, the Indo-Greek king mentioned in the pillar 55 However, see note 17. 56 Cunningham I854; Agrawal 1997. 57 Dehejia 1992. 58 Agrawal I997; Cunningham I854; Willis 2000. 59 Shaw, forthcoming.

Datable to the second century BCE, the Greek, or obverse, side shows Samkarsana carrying a plough (hala) and a pestle (musala), while the Brahmi, or reverse, side shows Vasudeva carrying a wheel and a conch.64 Similar depictions have been reported in rock-painted con- texts datable to the second century BCE from both northwest and central India.65 The same deities are mentioned in a number of early texts and inscriptions.66 In later years, these deities become part of a larger group of five heroes (Pancavira): Samkarsana, Vasudeva, Pradyumna, Samba, and Aniruddha.67 Later still, when the Viravada develops into the Vyuhavada, the system of emanations, the members of the Vrsni clan are no longer seen as earthly beings; the former family structure is dropped, with Vasudeva taking the supreme position and Samba being discarded altogether.68 The order of succes- sion is now Vasudeva, Samkarsana, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha.69 60 See Willis 2000, 57, for a recent discussion on the dating of the pillar and inscription. The foundations of an earlier apsidal building underlying the associated temple remains may be as early as the third century BCE (Khare 1967; Indian Archaeology: A Review (I963-64), 17; (I964-65), I9-20). 61 Hartel I987, 575, n. 7. 62 Hartel (i987, 580) attributes the coining of these terms to J. N. Banerjea. See also Srinivasan 1979 for distinctions between Viravada, Vyuhavada, and Avatara. 63 Vasudeva's association with the Vrsni race is mentioned in the Mahabharata (6.32.37). 64 Bernard 1974; Narain 1973; Hartel I987, 2, pi. II, a-b. 65 See Fussman (I989, 3-7, pl. 4; I5-I6, pi. I8) for examples at Chilas on the river Indus; and Neumayer (I992-1I993) for a group of paintings at Tikula (district Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh). 66 E.g., the second-century-BCE Nanaghat Cave inscription (district Pune, Maharashtra) invokes Samkarsana and Vasudeva in a list of other gods (Chanda I920; Sircar I965, I:I92). Another is the roughly contemporary Ghosundi inscription (Chitogarh, Rajasthan), which refers to the erection of a stone railing for the purpose of worshipping (puijd- sila-prakara) the Blessed Ones, Samkarsana and Vasudeva (Sircar 1i96, I:90;Jayaswal I92I-1922; Bhandarkar I920; for the remains of an elliptical shrine at nearby Nagari, see Chanda I920, I63). Vasudeva and Baladeva (Samkarsana) are also mentioned in a list of heterodox sects in the early Buddhist Mahanidessa (I, 89). 67 E.g., the Mora well inscription from Mathura, inscribed during the time of Sodasa (beginning of the first century C E ), describes the installation of cult idols of the five heroes (Pancavira) of the Vrsni race in a stone temple (Sircar I965, 1:122; Liiders 1937-1938, I94-200). These deities are listed by name in the Vayumahapurana (Bombay: Venkatesvara Press), 164; cited in Hartel I987, 575, n. 6). 68 Although the system reaches full maturity in the Pancaratra texts of the ninth century CE, the oldest textual sanc- tion for this new system is found in the Narayanlya section of the Santi-Parvan of the Mahabharata (XII, 326, 31-4I), in which the cosmic Narayana is manifested as the god of fourfold form. He announces himself to be the god of cre- ation, Vasudeva, from whom his other forms emanate one after the other: from Vasudeva emanates Samkarsana, from Samkarsana emanates Pradyumna, and so on." The Avatara doctrine, developing at the same time, comes from another current. It crosses, of course, the Vyuha conception, but does not merge into it" (Hirtel I987, 58I). I4</page><page sequence="11">Despite the significant body of textual and archaeological material relating to the Pancaratra tra- dition, there are still gaps in our understanding. When, for example, did the cult of the two heroes develop into five ? When did the transition from Viravada to Vyuhavada take place ? And in what form were the Vira deities depicted? A major problem is that prior to the early centuries CE, there is no clear evidence for sculptural images of the Vira deities as they appear on the earliest coins and in inscriptions. By the Kusana and Gupta periods we begin to find images identifiable as Samkarsana as well as Vasudeva in their Vira form,70 but as Hirtel states, "we can only hope that the soil of India [will] once yield an old vira also."71 Prior to the Kusana period, the only sculptures with any link to the Pancaratra tradition are of Balarama in his serpent manifestation. Discussed in more detail below, these sculptures are nagas, the only iconographic link with the human figures on the Ai Khanoum coins being the plough and pestle that they hold. Given the close ritual roles of Sahkarsana as an agricul- tural deity and the nagas as spirits of water and fertility, the transplantation of these objects from one religious tradition would presumably have been a fairly seamless process of" cultic assimilation. " How- ever, it has been suggested that it was not until the development of the Vyaha system that Balarima in his serpent manifestation became fully incorporated into the Bhagavata cult. Hartel argues that dur- ing the late centuries BCE, it is unlikely that Samkarsana in his Vira form was represented as a snake god, but rather as a human deity in the manner of the depictions on the Ai Khanoum coins.72 The early plough-wielding nagas may thus have been only loosely connected to the Bhagavata tradition and were probably worshipped as independent deities.73 These issues are of some importance when considering the Pancaratra material at Vidisha and its relationship to the Balarama images in the surrounding countryside. The Heliodorus pillar is described in its inscription as a "Garuda stambha." Since Garuda is traditionally the vehicle of Vasudeva, it is assumed that the pillar was dedicated to this deity.74The remains of a Garuda image, now in the Gujari Mahal Museum, Gwalior, evidently stood on the top of the pillar as a standard to Vasudeva.75 This Garuda stambha appears to have been part of a row of pillars, as suggested by post holes found during excavations, and associated capitals scattered around the site.76 Of the latter, the most significant is a group of fan-palm capitals (tdladhvaja)77 that, along with similar capitals from other sites in north 69 These developments correspond to the appearance, during the late Kusana period, of sculptural representations of the caturvyuha concept. The best-known example, now in the Mathura Museum (ace. no. 13. 392-95), depicts Samkarsana rising out of the shoulder of Vasudeva (Haiirtel 1987, 584, pi. IX). It has also been argued, although not entirely con- vincingly, that a four-sided image from Bhita datable to around the first century BCE may be an earlier interpreta- tion of the caturvyuha principle (Srinivasan I979). 70 For a Gupta example from Vidisha, see note 144. 71 Hirtel I987, 583. 72 Hartel I987, 582. 73 Hirtel I987, 585-586. 74 E.g., Mahabharata I, 33.

I5</page><page sequence="12">India,78 have been viewed as standards of Samrhkarsana; this link is supported by early textual descrip- tions.79 Nevertheless, the probable association of these aniconic standards with Vasudeva and Samkarsana-Balarama does not mean that they were set up in lieu of anthropomorphic images: the practice of installing standards in honor of deities whose images appear in adjoining shrines was an ancient custom well attested in the textual record.80 It is very likely that the temple described in the second inscription from Vidisha as having been constructed by King Bhagavata contained images that have not survived,81 and furthermore that these images were not dissimilar to those found on the sec- ond-century-BCE Ai Khanoum coins and contemporary depictions discussed earlier. Also included within the sculptural material at the Heliodorus pillar site was a large crocodile cap- ital, which has been interpreted as the standard of Pradyumna.82 Hartel suggests that "the evidence of the pillars for three of the Pancaviras makes it obvious that in this temple at [Vidisha] also all the five heroes were worshipped. "83 This final conjecture needs to be considered with some caution, how- ever; the existence of the crocodile capital cannot be taken as conclusive evidence for the full devel- opment of the Pancavira system during this time. Further, although the standards of Vasudeva and Samkarsana are described in the Mahabhahrata, those of the other Panficaviras do not find textual sanc- tion until well after the post-Gupta period, and when they do so, it is within the context of the Vyuha, and not the Vira system.84 78 Two fan-palm capitals from Pawaya are in the Gujari Mahal Museum, Gwalior, while another from Kausambi is in the Allahabad University Museum (acc. no. J5841; Sharma 1982, 32). Another example from Mathura is stored in the State Museum, Lucknow (Joshi 1979, pl. 5). Samfkarsana's association with the fan-palm capital is also supported by later sculptural evidence, such as the well-known Kusana-period caturvyuha image from Mathura in which he is shown emanating from Vasudeva's shoulder in his serpent manifestation (see note 69). An additional feature that has hith- erto attracted little interest is a small fan-palm capital upon which Samkarsana appears to be standing. This final obser- vation provides a useful key for relating the serpent and non-serpent forms of Balarima-Sarhkarsana. 79 E.g., in the Mahabharata 9.22.2 (also 9.36.20e and 9.53.Iob) Balarama is given the epithet taladhvajah: "he who has the fan-palm standard." Thanks to Alexis Sanderson for this reference. 80 In the Srivisnudharmottarapurdnam (ed. Krsnadasa, v. 3.85.28), for example, it is stated, "O King, fine standards on poles with their appropriate banners should be fashioned at the left side of [each of] the deities" (vamapdrsvagdh kdryad devandm pravard dhvaj4hlsvapatdkiyutd rdjan yastisths).

See also Banerjea I985, 387-388; Chanda I920, I62. A crocodile capital from Kausambi, now in the Allahabad Museum, has been dated to the same period and used to infer the existence of an associated temple of Pradyumna (Chandra 1970, 56-57). 83 Hartel I987, 579-580. Others such as Banerjea (I985, 387-378, n. I) interpret these standards as symbols of the Four Vyuhas, rather than the Five Viras. 84 Examples include the Pancaratra text, the Sdtvatasamhitad (5. 9-18; also Laksmi tantra I0.27C ff.), which gives instruc- tions for the visualization of the four vyuhas through the construction of associated banners (dhvaja). Grateful thanks to Alexis Sanderson for this reference. Hartel (I987, 577, n. II) also cites the Visnudharmottara Puradna (ed. Shah, Part I, 54 (p.I77)), which appears to correspond to Khanda 3, verse 54 of Krsnadasa's edition (Srivisnudharmottarapurdnam). This chapter, entitled garudarupanirmdnah, "the chapter on the making of the image of Garuda," provides instruc- tions for how the images of Suparna(= Garuda), the fan-palm (tdlah), crocodile (makarah), and deer (mrgah), are to be made. However, there appear to be a number of corruptions in the textual transmission, meaning that while it is i6</page><page sequence="13">A number of points regarding the relationship between the Bhagavata system and the state should also be made. The wide geographical distribution of the material relating to the Pancaratra system is in keeping with the inter-regional political alliances attested by the Heliodorus inscription. Its "pan- Indian" status is also confirmed by the inter-regional style of the Heliodorus pillar and its associated capitals: its inverted lotus capital belongs to a recognizable "post-Mauryan" pillar type found within both Buddhist and Brahmanical contexts throughout the Sanchi area,85 while similar fan-palm capi- tals have been found as far away as Pawaya in the north and Kausambi and Mathura in the east.86 The obvious availability of state patronage may be taken as one of the main factors behind the relatively early monumentalization of the Bhagavata tradition. While the early histories of Buddhism and the Bhagavata cult thus share certain attributes, it is significant that in contrast to Buddhism, which takes on a very visible presence even in the most interior areas from at least the second century BCE, the Heliodorus pillar material finds no direct equivalent in the surrounding countryside. However, as shown by the sculptures discussed in this paper, the appearance of anthropomorphic depictions of Balarama in his serpent form inin these rural areas from the first century BCE raises important questions regarding the relationship between the various strands of what have come to be grouped together as a single religious tradition. Naga and Yaksa Cults Nagas, like their yaksa counterparts, are ancient fertility spirits traditionally worshipped as place- bound tutelary deities.87 Early texts describe them as serpent deities residing in the nether regions of the earth or in ponds and rivers.88 This association is borne out by the frequency with which naga sculp- tures, both at Sanchi and elsewhere, are situated in close proximity to bodies of water.89 Traditionally believed to have powers over the forces of nature, they were worshipped as a means of regulating the monsoon rains. Their ritual status is thus an ambivalent one, because while being able to ensure instructed that Garuda be shown with his vehicle, Vasudeva, on his back, the link between the other three standards and their corresponding deities is less certain. The passage cannot be taken as evidence, therefore, for the aniconic symbolism of the Pancaviras, "but only, and then not certainly (because of the dubiousness of the textual transmis- sion), of that of the Four Vyuhas" (Alexis Sanderson, letter dated May 3, 200oo4). Further, while acknowledging the continuity of older idioms in later texts, there are obvious problems with using a post-Gupta Kashmirian text for interpreting second-century-BCE sculpture in central India: according to Alexis Sanderson (personal communica- tion), the iconographical section of this text cannot be dated earlier than ca. 850 CE. This is because it prescribes a four-faced Vaikuntha image with the Kapila head at the back, something which finds no equivalent in the sculptural record before the mid-ninth century. This provides a terminus for two of the earliest known Pancaratrika Samhitas: the Jayakhya and the Sdtvata, for these too teach the worship of this four-faced deity. 85 Willis 2000zooo, 56-58; Shaw, forthcoming. 86 See note 78. 87 The earliest stone yaksas in eastern India date to between the third and second centuries BCE (Chanda I92I). For the Parkham yaksa, see Vogel 1930; for the Noh yaksa, see Agrawala I933. The cult is no doubt much older; early Buddhist texts, for example, describe the worship ofyaksas at small tree-altars known as caitya, which are unlikely to have left archaeological remains (Misra 1981, 90). 88 Vogel 1926; Misra 1981, 90. 89 Shaw and Sutcliffe 2003a; 200o; Puri I968, 50.

Their obvious importance in an agrarian economy made them susceptible to assimilation into both Buddhist and Brahmanical contexts. The relationship between the ndga cult and each of these religious traditions will be discussed below. Ndgas and Buddhism Much of what we know about ndga worship comes from early Buddhist texts, in which serpent deities are often described as dangerous local spirits that eventually become subdued and "converted" by the power of the Buddha.9? They then take on their new "Buddhist" role as protectors of the Buddha, the dharma, or the Buddhist relic.91 Depictions of nagas are thus common at Buddhist sites across India, often with reference to the well-known story of Buddha's protection from a storm by Naga Muchalinda during his quest for enlightenment. Nagas are presented as dangerous and requiring external control because of their venomous bite, but also because of their ability to bring about environmental havoc by either withholding the monsoon rains or causing excessive deluges. There is another related reason for their assimilation into Buddhism: because of their perceived status as guardians of particular places, their appropriation is essential to the sangha's establishment, or localization, in new areas.92 By assert- ing his superiority over the local nagaraja, the Buddha takes on the attributes of the divine ruler of the place, and thus gains ritual legitimization for the presence of the nsangha. Further, because of the close link between ndgas and kingship, the Buddha becomes linked in the minds of the local populace with the othe other major symbol of local authority, the king: there are numerous tales relating how the king's rule is dependent upon the "authorization of the naga who is the primary guardian and master of the territory," and who will withdraw his support if the king fails to behave properly.93 Not only does the sangha adopt a similar legitimizing role in its relationship to the Cakravartin kings, it also appropri- ates the nagas' ritual function by claiming to possess ultimate control over the natural elements. This is attested by the elaborate rainmaking rituals described in Mahayana texts such as the Mahdmegha- sutra; although nagas continue to feature as the facilitators (and also withholders) of rain, it is the Bud- dha who ultimately grants them this power.94 The image that this text presents, of the sangha having established a monopoly over the " religious business " of weather control through an alliance with pow- erful, albeit subordinated, ndga deities, is supported by the writings of the fifth-century-CE Chinese pilgrim Fa Hsien, who describes monks worshipping at naga shrines inside monastic compounds in order to ensure adequate rainfall and to protect against "plagues and calamities. 95s According to Cohen, the well-known ndga shrine in cave 16, Ajanta, would have been worshipped in a similar way. go90 Misra I98I.

Composed sometime between the middle of the second and end of the fourth century CE, this "proto-tantric" text contained rituals and invocations that were to become part of the state-spon- sored apparatus of state protection in the Far East; Alexis Sanderson, personal communication, and "Notes on the Mahdmeghasutra," unpublished paper (April 16, 2004). 95 Cohen I998, 377-378. I8</page><page sequence="15">For the most part, the theoretical framework for interpreting these developments has derived from Brahmanical models of" tribal absorption" or "cultic integration, "96 whereby "local" deities are incor- porated into the mainstream religious framework through a process of"Hinduization" or "Sanskriti- zation."97 There are two major problems with such an approach. First, there is a disproportionate emphasis on the ritual motives behind "Buddhist" nadga worship, as opposed to the possible "practi- cal" or economic incentives. This paper will draw on more functional models of religious change as developed in relation to the spread of Islam and Christianity,98 arguing that the relationship between Buddhism and ndgas needs to be viewed as part of a wider set of evidence for the sangha's active par- ticipation in agrarian production as an instrument of lay patronage. Particular attention in this respect will be paid to the relative configuration of ndgas, monasteries, and ancient irrigation works in the Sanchi area. The second problem is that references to nagas in the early Buddhist texts are set almost exclusively in the Gangetic valley, where most of the Buddha's historical life was spent. We have no such evidence for central and western India, which were outside the Buddha's main geographical orbit. Current models of religious change are therefore built on the hitherto untested assumption that similar "local" cults were a universal phenomenon throughout India as a whole prior to the arrival of Buddhism in the third to second century BCE. This paper questions that assumption, and attempts to assess the degree to which the archaeological patterns in the Sanchi area fit current models of re- ligious change.99 Nagas and Brahmanism: Balardma in His Serpent Form A number of the ndga sculptures introduced in this paper represent Balarama, who as discussed ear- lier is synonymous with Vasudeva's elder brother, Samkarsana. These begin to appear throughout the rural landscape to tin the east of Sanchicentury Bbetween the first century BCE and the centurcentur CE, thus form- ing a contrast to the exclusively urban context of the Pancaratra-related material at Vidisha and other north Indian city sites. There are also major iconographic differences. In contrast to Samkarsana's depiction as a a fan-palm standard or as a deified human hero (Vira), here he appears as a serpent deity, with a human body and a serpent canopy outspread over his head. The earliest Balarama images in north India, datable between the second and first centuries BCE, are shown holding a pestle in the right hand and a plough in the other.100 By the early centuries CE, a second iconographic model appears 96 Kulke 1993. 97 Weber I920; Srinivas 1967. 98 Eaton 1993; Goody 1975. 99 Despite allusions to nagas in the Sanchi railing carvings and donative inscriptions, these are very much cast within the aforementioned Muchalinda story; the appearance of "place-bound" ndga cult spots does not occur until several centuries after the arrival of Buddhism. Possible explanations for these patterns will be ventured in the discussion on religious change towards the end of the paper. Ioo00 The earliest known examples are the two-armed Balarama from Jansuti, Mathura district, now in the State Museum, Lucknow (ace. no. G2IS; Hartel 1987, 582, pi. 7); and two separate images from Tumain, now in the Hari Singh Gaur Museum, Sagar (Joshi 1979, pls. 8a-c). i9</page><page sequence="16">in which the right hand is raised over the head, the left hand holding a wine goblet against the chest.101 The appearance ofBalarama images in the form of nagas is thought to coincide with the shift from the Viravada to the Vyuhavada system ofVaisnavism.102 Although there are references in the Mahdbharata that link Samkarsana with the snake incarnation of Sesa Narayana, it has been argued that the links between Visnu and Sesa Narayana on the one hand, and Balarama and nagas on the other, stem from two quite distinct traditions, and that the connection between Balarama and Sesa Narayana is thus a "confused" one.I103 Following this line of reasoning, Hartel views Balarama's naga manifestation as a mechanism for keeping the naga cult "under Orthodox control."104 While Balarama's manifestation as a ndga is thought to be a later development involving a process of cultic assimilation into the Bha- gavata tradition, there is a danger here of extrapolating back into the past from a set of connections that may only have been formalized in later years.105 We cannot assume, for example, that the sectar- ian link between these Balarama-naga images and the representation of the Pancaratra deities in Vidisha was an established fact. This is just one of a set of problems regarding the relationship between the various sectarian strands of early Vaisnavism that this paper seeks to address.106 The wider archaeo- logical context of these plough-wielding naga sculptures, and their later, Vaisnava-orientated counter- parts, also sheds light on the changing patterns of religious patronage in the Sanchi area. In particu- lar, their location on the edge of ancient irrigation systems provides an empirical basis for assessing wider theories regarding the involvement ofBrahmanical institutions in land ownership and agrar- ian production, and for suggesting a level of competition with Buddhism in this respect. IOI Other than the tradition ofBalarama's habitual drunkenness (Joshi 1979, 48-49), however, it is difficult to locate the textual sanction for this association. One possible source is the rule given in Varahamihira's Brhatsamhita that images of Baladeva should be white, have their eyes rolling with intoxication, and should carry a plough and "one pot" (kundakam) (57.36: baladevo halapanir madavibhramalocanas ca kartavyah/bibhrat kundakam ekam. Sankhendumrnala- gauratanuh). I am grateful to Alexis Sanderson for this reference. I02 Hartel I987, 582. 103 Mahabharata 12, 326; Banerjea 1942. 104 Hartel 1987, 582; Vogel 1926, 89. It is important to stress that Pancavyuha and Pancavira iconography do not unfold in a unilinear manner, as illustrated by the co-existence of various iconographic elements right through to the Gupta period, e.g., the lion-headed mace/plough idiom, which appears in early serpent forms of Balarama as well as in later non-serpent forms such as the Gupta-period image from Vidisha discussed below (see note I44). Indeed, there are con- siderable problems when it comes to relating these iconographic strands. 105 Grateful thanks to Lance Cousins, who helped me think more clearly about these matters. IO6 There are also problems when it comes to relating these early strands ofVaisnavism to later developments as typified, for example, at Udayagiri, whose sculptural program during the Gupta period reflects wider theological shifts, such as the full development of the concept of Avatara (see note 3). Accordingly, Visnu now appears as an independent deity in cave 6. There are two Visnu images, the larger of which (fig. 25) stands to the right of the door with his two personified weapons (ayudhapurusas), cakrapurusa and gadadevst. The smaller Visnu to the left of the doorway holds a cakra and gada in their unpersonified forms (Williams 1982, pi. 35). Two ofVisnu's avataras, Varaha and Narasimha, are depicted in excavations 5 and 12 respectively. Bakker (I986) gives a detailed discussion of the relationship between the textual and archaeological manifestations of these developments. 20</page><page sequence="17">II. NAGA SCULPTURES IN THE SANCHI AREA Although allusions to nagas can be found in the stupa railing carvings and inscriptions at Sanchi, there is no evidence for free-standing sculptural representations prior to the first century BCE. The earliest known group, published by Williams, consists of a naga-nagint couple from Gulgaon (fig. 2), a village about two kilometers to the west of Sanchi, and another similar couple from Nagauri hill (fig. 3), immediately to the south of Sanchi. Slightly later in date are a group offouryaksa and yaksi sculptures from Vidisha, including the well-known Kubera yaksa, now stored in the Vidisha Archaeological Museum (fig. 4). The generally accepted dted date range for these sculptures, in the above order, is from the middle to the end of the first century BCE. Williams' study also includes a later group of naga sculptures, datable to the Gupta period (ca. fifth century CE). This consists of two nagas and a nagini at Sanchi, and a naga-nagin couple and naga pillar capital at Ferozpur, a village to the west of Sanchi.107 The group of nagas introduced in this paper may also be divided into an early (ca. first century BCE to first century CE) and a late phase (ca. fifth century CE), in keeping with Williams' framework; an additional, intermediary phase is datable to the second or third century CE . Taken together, these three phases will henceforth be numbered I, II, and III . The phase II sculptures are closely related to Kusana images of the Mathura region, in distinct contrast, therefore, to the lack of locally produced images of this period at Sanchi itself. However, given the lack of evidence for Kusana dynastic control of the area, it is inappropriate to refer to these sculptures as "Kusana."8 There are also differences in geographi- cal distribution: Williams' group is concentrated in and around Sanchi, extending into the hilly area immediately to the west. By contrast, most of the sculptures introduced in this paper are situated on the flat agricultural plain to the east of Sanchi, with an additional two sculptures at Amacchar, on the western bank of the river Betwa immediately to the north of Vidisha (fig. I). Another difference is that when both groups of nagas are viewed together, an element of cultic diversity becomes evident that was not immediately apparent on the basis of Williams' group alone. Not only can we identify "inde- pendent" naga cult spots; it is also possible to identify Brahmanical (particularly Vaisnava) and Bud- dhist serpent deities.109 The role of the naga cult in relation to each of these religious traditions was discussed in the previous two sections. Phase I Nagas (first century BCE to first century CE) In total, six sets of naga sculptures are known from this period. Two sets, which happen to be the ear- liest, were dealt with in Williams' study; the remainder were documented during the Sanchi survey and, with two exceptions, are presented here for the first time.110 Three of these appear to represent I07 All of these nagas are described by Williams (1976). For the yaksas, see Chandra 1966. I08 Alternative suggestions will be offered in this paper, drawing largely on evidence regarding the political alliances between the Ksatrapas and the local Naga clan. Iog Jaina nagas, most of them datable to the post-Gupta period, are also known in the area, but are dealt with elsewhere (Shaw, forthcoming). IIo See note 9. 2I</page><page sequence="18">Samkarsana-Balarama in his serpent aspect; an additional sculpture of Samkarsana-Balarama in his non-serpent form also belongs to this period. I will now describe these in chronological order, begin- ning with the two known sets of sculptures. Such an approach is necessary for the purposes of context and to build up a comprehensive picture of the temporal and spatial patterns throughout the study area. Gulgaon and Nagauri Ndgas The earliest known serpent sculptures in the area come from Gulgaon, a settlement (and modern village) around two kilometers to the west of Sanchi. Here a naga-naginm couple originally stood on the embankment of an ancient irrigation reservoir."' During the I98oS, the ndga (fig. 2) was shifted to the Sanchi Archaeological Museum following the theft of the nagini partner. Another, almost iden- tical ndga stands on Nagauri hill immediately to the south of Sanchi, whose monuments it overlooks (fig. 3).112 When it was first described by Marshall it was still part of a couple, but as with its Gulgaon counterpart, the smaller nagini has been stolen.113 Like the Gulgaon example, there is a close link with water: the naga would have stood just meters from the southern edge of a large reservoir held up by the ancient embankment which runs between Sanchi and Nagauri hills.II4 In keeping with early anthropomorphic serpent sculptures from other parts of India, both nagas consist of larger-than-life standing deities, with the body of a coiled serpent rising up the back and an outspread serpent canopy over the head.115 Both wear circular turbans piled up in a spiral on the head. Similar turbans are found at western Deccan cave sites such as Pitalkhora or Bhaja.,,6 Despite these "pan-Indian" comparisons, Williams has argued that the Nagauri and Gulgaon ndgas belong to a "localized" style, which gives the impression of a folk tradition not fully accustomed to working in stone.117 This view rests on the low relief of the sculptures as well as their stocky, rather stiff frontal stance; the feet protrude straight out from the body, in contrast to the natural standing position of the stupa I gateway figures at Sanchi. At the same time, there are points of convergence, such as the "soft" modeling of the stomach and the prominent breasts, which are not dissimilar to the first-century-CE stupa I gateway figures. Other notable features - the tightly clinging dhoti, the deep-set eyes, and the pouting lips - are uncommon before the early centuries CE. Such observations led Marshall to assign the Nagauri naga to around the first or second century CE .II8 Yet despite these "late" stylistic features, dating is complicated by the overall awkwardness of the sculptures and the flat modeling technique. iii Shaw and Sutcliffe 200I, 68-69. II2 Shaw 200ob, 35, fig. 14. 113 Marshall et al. 1940, 244. 114 Shaw and Sutcliffe 200I, 55; 69. 115 Joshi I979. 116 Deshpande I959; Bachhofer I939, pl. 63. The small cockade visible in the center has also led to comparisons with the circular crest ornament and the central tassel (referred to as the maulimani type of turban) found in Kusana sculpture from Mathura (Czuma and Morris I985, pi. 20). However, as discussed later, the full development of the maulimani in the Sanchi area does not become apparent until the first or second century CE. 117 Williams I976, I76-I77. 118 Marshall et al. I940, pls. I25a, c. 22</page><page sequence="19">It is therefore important to go beyond the isolated iconographic particularities to a holistic appraisal of the complete image. Williams, pursuing a similar logic, assigned both nagas to a period midway between the carved railings on stupas 2 and I, by which time much of the rigidity and flat appearance had been remedied.119 Following this line of reasoning, together with the latest understanding of the relative chronology between stupas 2 and I, a date of ca. 50 BCE for both the Nagauri and Gulgaon nagas seems acceptable.,20 Vidisha Yaksas Closely related in date are the well-known Kubera yaksa (fig. 4) and three related sculptures from Vidisha.I21 All four sculptures share the same erect and frontal posture, with the body weight distrib- uted evenly between both legs. Although the overall stance is much more natural than the Nagauri and Gulgaon nagas, there is a similar incorporation of both early and late stylistic influences from cen- tral and western India. According to Chandra, the Kubera yaksa retains the older Bharhut features, such as the multiple flower-and-bead bracelets, the fleur-de-lys armlets, and the large spiral earrings. However, the solid sculptural volume and the broad chest and shoulders are more closely related to later developments in the Deccan. For example, the dhott falls over the legs in two angular points, a characteristic also found at Pitalkhora.122 Similar influences are seen in the fleshy modeling of the stomach, reminiscent of the stupa I gateway figures at Sanchi. Chandra thus assigns the yaksa to mid- way between stuiipas 2 and I. In general, this is the chronology followed here, although it is important to stress that the dating of the carvings on stupas I and 2 at Sanchi, upon which this framework is based, is in itself an unsettled matter.123 Thus, a late-first-century-B C E date or even later diverges somewhat from the earlier date range posited by Chandra.12^ II9 Williams I976, I76-I77. I20 Willis (2000, 56-58), noting similarities between the carvings on the Heliodorus pillar and stupa z, Sanchi, has sug- gested a date range ofca. II5-80 BCE for the latter. See note 123. I2i The Kubera yaksa and its yaksJ counterpart are in the Vidisha Museum. Both were discovered in the I96os at the con- vergence of the rivers Bes and Betwa (Chandra 1966, figs. 4-6). The famous "Besnagar yaktf, " now in the Calcutta Museum, was discovered much earlier by Cunningham (1880, 44; also Chandra 1966, fig. I) on the bank of the river Betwa about one kilometer northeast of the Heliodorus pillar. A kalpadruma capital, also in the Calcutta Museum, was found at the same site. Cunningham's suggestion that this was originally part of the Heliodorus complex is uncon- vincing given the distance between the two sites. Furthermore, given the kalpadruma and the yakst s shared symbolic reference to wealth and fertility, it is more likely that the two formed part of a single pillar capital (Dass and Willis 2002, 30-3I). More recently, the upper portion of a second ya}ks, now in the Bhopal Archaeology Museum, was dis- covered (Bakshi I945). 122 Chandra I966, I63; Deshpande I959, 80-81, pi. 56a. I23 Attempts to date this material have generally revolved around theories that draw on the element of discontinuity between Mauryan and post-Mauryan art forms, traditionally characterized as a movement from an " imperial, " courtly idiom to more regionalized styles derived from folk art and carried out by artists more familiar with non-durable media, such as wood or terracotta. This approach is typified by Ray (I945, 65-8I), who views the "naturalism" of post-Mau- ryan art as a nationalistic reaction to the foreign-inspired, imperial art of the Mauryan period. After the Mauryan period, everything is referred back to the carvings of Bharhut, whose low-relief and "flat" features become the defining style of the post-Mauryan period. Similar material, although in less complete form, is found at other sites in the Gangetic valley, for example in Mathura and Pratapgarh. There are also close parallels with Bharhut-period sculpture 23</page><page sequence="20">Chandna Balarama Four sculptures belonging to this early phase were documented during the Sanchi survey. The earliest comes from an ancient irrigation embankment at Chandna, around I.5 kilometers to the south of the Buddhist stupas at Morel-khurd (figs. 5, 6).125 Broken from the thighs downwards (surviving height: 52 centimeters), it is markedly smaller than the other sculptures discussed so far. It consists of a stand- ing anthropomorphic deity, with a five-headed serpent hood spread out over the head. The serpent rises up the back in a single column rather than with the more usual horizontal coils. Local parallels, such as the lower portion of a second-century-CE naga in the village of Salera (fig. 17) and a Gupta sculpture at Amacchar (fig. 31), indicate that it would have risen from a pile of coils beneath the stand- ing figure. The body is small and squat, with a stocky chest and stomach, between which there is little differentiation. The right arm is missing, but the damaged upper section of what appears to be a plough can be seen rising behind the left shoulder. This detail justifies identifying the naga as Balarama. A thick, plain sash is hung low over the hips and tied in a simple cross-knot at the center. Both the sash and knot find close parallels in the Vidisha Kuberayaksa (fig. 4), as do the long chunky necklace and bulky, piled-up turban. Although the Chandna image is considerably smaller than the Vidisha yaksa, this broader set of stylistic parallels suggests a similar date of ca. 25 BCE. from sites farther south such as Bhaja and Amaravati (Willis 2000, 58). The date for Bharhut is uncertain, although I5o BCE may be taken as a general marker for the earliest sculpture there. The date of Bharhut rests largely on the unresolved dating of the "Sunga" king Dhanabhuti, mentioned in the inscription on the east gateway of the main stupa (Sircar 1965, 87). Some of the discrepancies over the dating of stupa 2 have arisen from differences of opinion regarding the date of Bharhut. For example, some confusion is introduced by the fact that Behrendt (2000), in his recent paper on a sculpted panel from Andher, follows 80 BCE rather than I5o BCE, the latter being favored by Willis (2000). This generally acts as the baseline against which everything else is measured. Consequently, the rail- ing carvings ofstipa 2 are generally, by virtue of an increased movement towards three-dimensionality, placed slightly later than Bharhut, i.e. around the last quarter of the second century BCE. It is important to remain open to the pos- sibility that a number of different carving styles could have co-existed at the same time: the fact that artists were carv- ing in low relief should not imply that they were incapable of three-dimensionality. We know from the pillars and capitals at Sanchi and Vidisha, and indeed the naga and yaksa sculptures discussed above, that three-dimensional sculptures were being produced at the same time as the sculpted reliefs on the stupa railings. As discussed recently by Willis (2000), the Heliodorus pillar, dated by virtue of the associated inscription to ca. II5-80 BCE, bears lotus medallions almost identical in style to the more rudimentary railing carvings on stupa 2. As well as corroborating a late-second-century-BCE date for the latter, this point also illustrates that whilst railing carvings and pillars were most probably produced by two different sets of artisans, the two styles could also appear together. It would seem to be a circular argument, then, to use the relative "complexity" or depth of relief as a basis for dating the railings. I24 This follows the assumption that the stupa I gateways date to ca. 25 CE, as opposed to the "middle of the first century BCE" as maintained by Chandra (I966, I60). For a recent discussion of the relative dating of the railing carvings on stupas I and 2, see Willis 2000, 56-58. I25 For an earlier description and illustration of the sculpture and the associated dam, see Shaw and Sutcliffe 2001, 69, figs. I3-I4. 24</page><page sequence="21">Andher Balarama Sculptures Two more previously unrecorded sculptures representing Balarama in both his serpent and non-ser- pent forms, were noted at the western base of Andher hill, immediately below the Buddhist stupas.26 The larger of the two figures (height: 2.27 meters), shown in serpent form, is set in a mud platform facing away from the stupas above (fig. 7). The second, purely anthropomorphic image lies in a broken state on the same platform (fig. 8). Again, there is a link with water: the platform is positioned sev- eral meters to the south of a small stone tank (bauri).127 The larger deity is four-armed, with a serpent that rises up the back in horizontal coils and terminates in a seven-headed canopy over the head. Un- fortunately, much of the detail has been obscured by recent clay remodeling of the face and upper torso, while the entire image has been painted as Siva. The original stone of the serpent canopy is still visi- ble, however, and one of its individual serpent heads was found nearby (fig. 9). A fragment of a heav- ily eroded circular headdress lies on the same platform (fig. IO). Its halo-like appearance and central medallion are comparable to the tall circular cockade seen in Kusana images of the Mathura region, not to the Deccan-inspired, spiral turbans of the Nagauri and Gulgaon nagas described earlier.128 Both of the upper arms are upraised. The upper right hand holds what appears to be a pestle; extended horizontally over the head, it is carved with circular bands, each of which is decorated with vertical cross spokes. The upper left hand supports the extended end of the pestle; the palm faces out- wards to reveal an indeterminate object.129 The lower right arm, the hand of which is missing (fig. 7), hangs down by the side of the body, while the lower left hand rests on the hip in a position similar to that of the Gulgaon naga. The pestle, referred to in the Harivamsa as one of the objects associated with Balarama, is seen in some of the earliest known Balarama sculptures, such as the one from Jansuti near Mathura.30 The latter w, simply holds the pestle against the shoulder. Parallels can also be drawn with another early Balarama sculpture from Tumain; in this case the long object that rests on the ground, supported by the right arm, is ma club (gad) ore like a club staff than a pestle.3 Quite a dif- ferent type of iconography emerges during the Kusana period: the right arm, now empty-handed, sim- ply rises up and over the head in a similar manner to the Andher figure. Meanwhile, instead ofa plough, the left hand holds a wine goblet against the chest. This type of Balarama occurs in large numbers in the Mathura region,132 the best-known example being the misnamed "naga" from Chargaon, dated year 40 of the Kaniska era.133 In all of the known examples from Mathura, however, the extended right hand remains empty, although in later four-armed versions, the pestle sometimes reappears in one of 126 For the stupa site, see Cunningham I854, 342-350; Willis 2000, 95-99. I27 Significantly, this appears to be the nearest source of water for the monastic site on the hill above, which may have played some role in the level of religious competition discernible in the relative positioning of the stupa and Balarama images (Shaw, forthcoming). I28 A close parallel is provided by the turban worn by the Brooklyn Museum naga datable to the first or second century CE (Czuma and Morris I985, pi. 25). I29 This is not clear, but closely resembles a miniature female figure. 130 Hartel 1987, pi. 7; see note Ioo. 131 Joshi I979, pls. 8a-c; see note Ioo. 132 Joshi I979, pls. 20-22. I33 Bachhofer I939, pl. 97a. 25</page><page sequence="22">the back hands.134 It seems, therefore, that the Andher example combines elements that elsewhere belong to two quite distinct stages of Balarama iconography.135 The second image on the same platform (fig. 8) provides further indications that we are dealing with Balarama. It survives only from the waist upwards (surviving height: 43 centimeters), and when complete, would have been less than half the size of the standing figure. Unlike the larger sculpture, it is entirely anthropomorphic, with no serpent attributes. However, close iconographic similarities between the two sculptures suggest that both belong to a single religious tradition: the position of the right hand, raised over the head, and the pestle-like object which it holds are almost identical to those of the larger image. The pestle is carved with the same circular bands, although the vertical cross- spokes found on the larger sculpture are absent. Distinctive to the smaller figure are the remains of what looks like the upper portion of a ploughshare emerging from behind the left shoulder, a clear indication of the image's Balarama identity. Dating clues are provided by the bulbous, piled-up tur- ban secured by two bands and fastened in the center by a large circular medallion. Similar, albeit not identical, turbans occur in many of the gateway panels of stupa I, datable to around 25 CE. Further cor- roboration of an early-first-century-CE date is provided by an interesting detail on the right side of the image (fig. II). Hanging from the lower end of the club, at the proper left side of the image, is a long garland of Asoka leaves, the large bulbous fruit of which can be seen on the top left corner of the sculpture. Although the Asoka tree occurs on the stupa z railings, it is not until the stupa I gateway carvings that we encounter the realistic three-dimensionality of the Andher carving. An almost exact parallel can be made with the Asoka fruit and leafy garland shown in the background of the eastern gateway figure of stupa I (fig. I2). The discovery of an early-first-century-CE Sarmkarsana in his non- serpent form calls for a rethinking of Hartel's view that there are no known images of Vira Samkarsana during the pre-Kusana period. It also raises important questions regarding the changing relationship between the Viravada and the Naga-Balaramna traditions, which, at least during the earlier period, were assumed to have operated as independent cultic strands. I36 Mehgaon Balarama A fourth image with close iconographic links to the Balarama tradition was noted at Mehgaon, a major early-historic settlement to the east of Sanchi (fig. I3 ).137 The image is now embedded at thigh level in the central village platform, but according to villagers it originally stood on the embankment of a dried-up tank to the north of the village. The sculpture (total height: 82 centimeters) is two-armed and intact apart from a missing right hand. A thick serpent shaft rises up the deity's back, expanding into a five-headed canopy above the head. The individual serpent heads, each of which has protruding two-pronged tongues, are arranged in an almost horizontal line, as opposed to the circular, halo-like 134 Hartel I987, 582. I35 The only other context I am aware of in which this particular arm posture occurs together with a musala is in a carved panel from Amavarati, now in the Musee Guimet, Paris (acc. no. MG 17066), depicting the attack ofMara. One of Mara's troop of demons is shown holding a pestle-like object in the right hand and extended over the head; the other end of the pestle is supported by the left hand (Okada 2000, 50, fig. 5o). I36 See the discussion in part I, and note 71. 137 Surface pottery from this site dates to between ca. Iooo BCE and the third century CE (Shaw, forthcoming). 26</page><page sequence="23">serpent canopies already described. A similarly shaped canopy occurs on the two-armed Balarama from Jansuti, Mathura.138 Stylistically, the closest local parallel is the stupa 3 gateway figure at Sanchi, datable to around 50 CE, that is, slightly later than the stupa I gateway figures.139 The tightly framed composition, the slight, upright stance of the body, the soft, fleshy modeling around the chest and stomach, and the treatment of the thick sash, wrapped around the waist and secured at the front with a barely visible knot, are all features directly comparable to the Sanchi figure. However, despite these similarities, the Mehgaon figure belongs to a more localized school: clumsy modeling has resulted in heavy distortion on the proper right shoulder; the flat, rounded face and the rope-like plait of hair, pulled over the top of the head and hanging in straight braids on either side, all create a reductive, folklike style. A disproportionately large, bulbous turban balances in an unnatural and precarious manner on the proper right side of the head. It is a far cry from the natural ease and symmetry of the Sanchi figure. There are also iconographic idiosyncrasies and uncertainties: the left hand holds a long staff sur- mounted by what at first looks like a three-pronged fork (trifula), with a missing third prong on the proper left side. It is not impossible that we are dealing with a Saiva image: although most of the early texts present Samkarsana as a Vaisnava deity, there are occasionally some interesting Saiva allusions.140 Alternatively, there could be some allusion to Samkarsana's three-forked palm standard.141 Further inspection, however, suggests that the missing prong may have extended further out and down to the left in the form of a ploughshare. The same can be said of the three-pronged object held in the left hand of a recently noted naga-Balarama image found just to the north of Vidisha (fig. I4) 42 Additional insights into the original appearance of this object are provided by the Samkarsana-Balarama figure depicted on second-century-B C E coins ofAgathocles from Ai Khanoum. The object held in the deity's left hand could quite easily be mistaken for a trisula if not for the down-turned element of the ploughshare, this time on its proper right-hand side.143 Emerging from the proper right side of the pole of the Mehgaon image, at the point where it meets the "ploughshare," is a grooved, spherical object. A precise identification is difficult, but it is possible that we are dealing with a roughly carved lion head, a feature of Balarama iconography that sometimes occurs on top of ploughs or maces.144 Further still to the right is what looks like a bulbous 138 See note ioo. 139 Willis 2000zooo, 60-6I, fig. 37. I40 In the Pancaratra Samhitds, for example, Samkarsana is sometimes linked with Rudra Siva (Jaiswal I967, 54). 141 Ibid. 142 Noted during field investigations inJanuary 2004, this image is situated on the grounds ofthe Forestry Department on the northern bank of the river Bes. Its current trisla-like appearance no doubt explains why the image is currently under worship as Siva, but a breakage on the proper left side evidently marks the spot where it originally continued into a ploughshare shape. More detailed descriptions are given in Shaw, forthcoming. 143 See note 64. 144 The textual sanction is provided in the Harivamsa (Visnuparvan, I2I, Ioo, 705). Early sculptural examples include a first-century-CE Balarama from Mathura (Mathura Museum, ace. no. CI9 ;Joshi 1979, pi. 18), and another in the Bharat Kala Museum, Varanasi (acc. no. 279; Joshi 1971, 245). This identification continues in later, non-serpent forms of Balarama, as illustrated by a Gupta image from Vidisha, originally described as Visnu (Lake I9IO, I39; Harle I974, fig. I8), but which, on account of the musala in the right hand and lion-faced standard in the other, has been convinc- ingly re-identified as "Balarama without snake and snakehood," i.e. Vira Samkarsana (Hartel I987, 584, n. 34). 27</page><page sequence="24">vase, with a narrow neck and flared rim, placed on its side directly on top of the deity's head. The vase, although more commonly held in the hand than balanced on the head, is a common attribute of nagas. There may also be some indirect reference to another of Balarama's traditional attributes: a wine glass.145 Alternative interpretations, though, cannot be ruled out: it is possible that both of these objects are simply extensions to what is already a rather unwieldy turban! This level oficonographic syncretism, and indeed confusion, acts as a powerful reminder that while textual iconographic for- mulas provide a basic framework for interpreting ritual images, the trajectory oficonographic devel- opment at the village level often unfolds in a less predictable, non-linear manner. Phase II Nagas (ca. second century CE) Five of the serpent sculptures documented during the Sanchi survey belong to phase II. Unlike the earlier phase, the fragmentary nature of these sculptures has resulted in the absence of any distin- guishing features directly associated with Balarama. It is therefore difficult to attribute a specific sec- tarian affiliation to any of the phase II naga images.146 Morel Kala One such naga comes from Morel Kala, a settlement around 2.5 kilometers southeast of Morel-khurd. The lower half of the sculpture (total height from waist to ankles: 94 centimeters) lies propped up on an ancient irrigation embankment (fig. IS).147 Both arms are missing, but serpent coils, rising in hor- izontal piles up the back, are still visible, as are the remains of a kamandalu in the left hand. A trans- parent dhoti terminates in a light hem just below the knees, with extra cloth falling in spiral, zigzag folds between the legs. A heavily striated sash skims the knees in a "square-on" angle, rising to the left of the body, where it would have hung over the left arm. The remaining length of cloth flanks the left side of the body, terminating in a finely fluted border. A small loop, which presumably formed part of a knotted waist sash, is visible below the left hip. For a possible date, one may turn to early Kusana sculptures from the Gangetic valley area, which share the same sense of solid yet refined strength of bearing. The striated sash, its fluted border, and the way in which it is arranged on the body are all comparable to the Sarnath Bodhisattva, datable to the first quarter of the second century CE .I48 The spiral, zigzag pleating between the legs is also a feature of early Kusana images, such as the Ahicchatra Indra, datable to the early second century CE.I49 145 Joshi I979, 48-49. 146 The identification of sculptures belonging to this stage is of some significance for local religious and political his- tory in that it presents a striking contrast to the absence of locally produced "Kusan.a" sculpture at Sanchi itself. See note 35. 47 Illustrated and described briefly, together with the associated da, togetherwith the associated dam, in Shaw and Sutcliffe 200, 70, fig. I5. 148 Williams I982, pi. 6. The Sarnath Bodhisattva is usually placed several years earlier than the Bala Bodhisattva, the latter being dated year 3 of Kaniska's era. Given the revised thinking on the dating of the Kaniska era (year i = I26 CE), the Bala Bodhisattva is assignable to ca. I29 CE, as opposed to the usually accepted date of 8i CE (Bachhofer 1939, pl. 79)- 149 Czuma and Morris I985, pl. 57. 28</page><page sequence="25">These "pan-Indian" parallels may also be tempered with local comparisons: an unpublished male sculpture from Vidisha, now in the Vidisha Museum, belongs to broadly the same style (fig. I6).150 This deity's identity is unknown, but the sacred thread (yajnopavita) worn over the left shoulder pro- vides evidence of its Brahmanical orientation. The face and arms are missing, but the surviving height (98 centimeters) suggests that the complete sculpture was approximately the same size as the Morel Kala image. The figure has a robust physique, with a broad, expanded chest and fleshy modeling around the waist. A transparent dhotzi with extra fabric gathered in folds between the legs is held in place by a striated hip belt, while another striated sash skims the knees in the same square-on angle as the Morel Kala image; tucked into the belt at both hips, it forms a small loop on the left side, falling in folds on either side of the body. Strong muscular thighs are visible beneath the tightly clinging gar- ment, which accentuates the area around the genitals. All of these are features shared by the Mathura sculptures discussed above, but both the stone and the slightly distorted treatment of the legs provide confirmation of the figure's local provenance. Salera Around 2.5 kilometers to the west of Morel Kala is the ancient village of Salera, where another naga (fig. 17) was discovered on the bank of a ruined village tank.15 Only the lowermost portion of the image survives: a single mass of serpent coils, upon which the deity's feet are still visible. Clues as to the original appearance of its upper portion are provided by the Chandna Balarama described above, as well as a Gupta-period ndga from Amacchar described later (fig. 3I): in contrast to the Nagauri and Gulgaon examples, they stand on a pile of serpent coils that ascend the back in a single shaft. Similar images, such as the Brooklyn Museum naga or the Cleveland Museum nagint, are known from the Mathura region.152 A ca. second-century-CE date for the Salera ndga is supported by the treatment of the two heads (fig. 18) lying on a nearby platform, one of which may have originally belonged to the ndga in question. Pagneswar The locational context of the ndgas at Morel Kala and Salera is in keeping with the traditional associ- ation between ndgas and water. However, a major shift takes place during this phase: rather than stand- ing aloof, ndgas are now found within multi-denominational religious complexes, including yaksas, yaksts, and, for the first time, Saiva sculptures. An example of this new development, at least as far as its manifestation in stone is concerned,15 occurs at Pagneswar, a major settlement on the river Betwa about 3.5 kilometers south of Sanchi. Lying in the middle of the village, amidst a multiphase pile of half-buried sculptural fragments, including a second-century-CE yaksa and Sivalinga (fig. I9), is an 15o Exact provenance unknown, but according to the Vidisha Museum accession book, it was found "on the road between Besnagar and Udayagiri." II The hills behind the village bear extensive Buddhist stupa and monastery remains (Shaw, forthcoming). I52 Czuma and Morris I985, 83-87, pi. 26. I53 It should be stressed that this movement towards durable media of representation probably indicates major shifts in religious patronage rather than religious practiceper se. 29</page><page sequence="26">anthropomorphic naginm, of which only the face and seven-headed serpent canopy survive(fig. 20). The dimensions of the canopy (40 x 50 x 20 centimeters) give some indication of the size of the complete image. The face is full and rounded, with protruding eyes, a snub nose, and thick lips set deeply in a grimacing smile. Thick, heavy ringlets are piled on top of the head. This particular hair arrangement is quite unusual, but the facial type is closely related to a wide range of Kusana images datable to the second century CE, such as the Bala Bodhisattva'54 or a caturmukhalinga from Mathura, now in the National Museum, Delhi.155 The treatment of the aforementioned Sivalinga is also supportive of a second-century-CE date for the nagint: standing at a height of 70 centimeters, it belongs to the "realistic" category as opposed to the stylized version that becomes common in later years. Rather than rising from a yoni base, a common attribute of later lingas, it emerges straight from the ground, terminating in a nut-shaped element representing the glans penis (rudrabhAga).56 Similar lingas occur at widely dispersed locations throughout India from the second century BCE to the early centuries CE. 57 The best-known example is the Gudimallam linga, dated variously between the second century BCE and the first century CE .I58 Apart from the two-armed Siva carved on one side of the shaft, its shape is similar to the Pagneswar linga. Other inter-regional parallels provide a broad framework for dating the Pagneswar linga to around the second century CE.159 Gehunkheri Although it is possible that the Pagneswar linga dates to a slightly earlier period,,60 a ca. second-cen- tury-CE date is consistent with the chronology of sculptural and ceramic remains at two other sites in the area where similar lingas were noted: Murlikheri, a large settlement near Satdhara, and Gehunkheri, to the east of Sanchi (figs. I, 21). Like Pagneswar, the latter forms part of a larger group of second-cen- tury-CE sculptures including a yaksa and a naga-nagini couple. The naga (fig. 22) survives only from the waist down and the feet are missing, but the current dimensions suggest a total height of about 60 centimeters, smaller than the nagas described thus far. The nagint (fig. 23), in an equally fragmen- tary condition, is of similar proportions. Both stand in samapdda, with serpent coils rising up the back in horizontal piles. The naga wears a transparent garment down to the ankles, falling in striated folds I54 Bachhofer I939, pl. 79. I55 Acc. no. 65.I72. A similar caturmukhalinga from Kausambi is in the Allahabad Museum (Chandra I970, pl. 88). 156 However, there is no textual evidence that the notion of the rudrabhcga and the portions assigned to Brahma (brahma- bhagah) and Visnu (visnubhagah) existed during this period; these terms are unlikely to be earlier than the sixth-cen- tury-CE Brhatsamhita (57.53-54) (Alexis Sanderson, personal communication). 157 Sharma I982, 47. I58 For the second-century-BCE date, see Sharma I982, 6I. Others (e.g., Sivaramamurti I964, 46-47) position it in the first century CE. 159 E.g., a similar, undecorated linga is depicted on a carved frieze from Mathura datable from around the second century BCE to the first century CE. "Realistic" lingas are also depicted on early coins (Sharma I982, 60, pi. 36). An early free- standing example is the early Kusana ekamukhalinga from Aghapur, which differs from the Pagneswar linga only with respect to the central Siva face (Agrawala 1967, pi. z). I60 Cf.

It flares out at the lower hem in a manner similar to that of the sanghati robe worn by certain Kusana-period Buddha and Bodhisattva images from Mathura.161 The nagini wears a trans- parent skirt secured by a jeweled belt fastened low on the waist. Above the waistline, the slightly pro- truding stomach is modeled in such a way as to accentuate the fleshy, rippled quality of the skin. The upper fragment of a deity consisting only of head and shoulders (fig. 22), which may have belonged to the nagint figure, is also embedded in the same platform. The rounded face, elongated earlobes, and piled-up hairstyle set in a high bun all find close equivalents in Mathura sculpture of the Kusana period. These comparisons are all supportive of a ca. second-century-CE date. Phase III Nagas (ca. fifth-sixth centuries CE) The changing ritual context of naga sculptures during phase II culminates during the Gupta period with the incorporation of naga images into both Brahmanical and Buddhist ritual complexes. There are also changes in terms of style and iconography, the most notable of which is a pronounced "Visnuization" of naga images. These developments can be interpreted from three points of view. First, they are important for assessing current models of religious change in the relationship between Buddhism, orthodox Brahmanism, and "local" cults. Second, they reflect internal developments in Vaisnava theology, namely the reorientation from the Vyuha to the Avatara system. Finally, they may also be positioned within the political framework provided by epigraphical evidence for the changing dynamics between the Guptas and the local Naga Dynasty. Before introducing the three phase III nagas documented during the Sanchi survey, I shall provide the necessary context by discussing a group of known naga sculptures from this period. This includes nagas from two sites included in Williams' study: i) the Buddhist complex at Sanchi, and ii) Ferozpur village, several kilometers to the west. The third site to be discussed here is the Brahmanical rock-cut complex at Udayagiri, where despite the absence of free-standing naga sculptures, the serpent idiom is powerfully present in two of its carved Vaisnava panels. Sanchi The incorporation of two anthropomorphic nagas at Sanchi (fig. 24), assignable on stylistic grounds to the beginning of the fifth century CE, marks a departure from the earlier spatial dislocation between Buddhist sites and naga cult spots.162 Broadly speaking, the sculptures follow a similar iconographic program to earlier nagas, e.g., the outspread serpent canopies, the lotus flowers held in the right hand, and the kamandalu in the left. There is, however, a marked Visnuization in terms of apparel and orna- mentation: the dhoti, vanamalad, and elaborate torque are all similar in style to those worn by the two cave 6 Visnu images at Udayagiri (fig. 25).I63 These parallels suggest a date somewhere in the first half 161 See, for example, the second-century-CE standing Buddha in the Mathura Museum (Czuma and Morris I985, 30, fig. 6). 162 Both nagas (acc. nos. 2858 and 2859) are now in the Sanchi Archaeological Museum. The former, the larger of the two, is illustrated here (see also Williams I976,174, fig. 6; n. 5). For the latter, see Marshall et al. 1940, pl. I25b; Harle 1974, 42, fig. 40. 163 The larger of the two Visnu images to the right of the doorway is illustrated here (fig. 25). For the smaller image on the left, see Williams I982, pi. 35. 3I</page><page sequence="28">of the fifth century CE, although Harle, noting a certain " meanness and lack of vitality," assigns them slightly later than the Udayagiri sculptures.164 Also notable is the fact that in contrast to earlier peri- ods, the nagas now wear crowns distinguished by "three high circular lobes, the central of which bears a lion's head (kirntamukluta) from whose mouth festoons of pearls are draped. "i65 The similarity to the crown worn by the Udayagiri Visnu figures is striking. Apart from the fact that the crowns of the lat- ter follow a square rather than circular outline, the central kiritamukuta motif, which in shape can be seen as a continuation of the maulimani turban of the Kusana period, is almost identical.e66 The kirttamukuta motif, which becomes increasingly popular in the Gupta period as a symbol of noble birth,i67 is just one of several factors that lie behind my twofold contention regarding the changing ritual and political status of the naga cult during the Gupta period: i) nagas begin to look more and more like Visnu, and ii) there are increasing allusions to the royal identity of naga images. From Maisey's descriptions in I892, it seems likely that one of the Sanchi nagas originally formed a pair with the nagini that stands outside temple 3I (fig. 26).,68 This assumption may be confirmed by photographs in the India Office Library in which a naga is shown lying amongst a pile of sculptures outside temple 3I.169 As Marshall points out, the tenon at the base of the nagint shows that it was orig- inally set in a plinth, and was most probably moved to its present location in the tenth century CE .I70 Maisey writes that the second naga was discovered on the summit of the tenth-century-CE platform to the east ofstupa I, and must therefore have been brought from elsewhere on the site.171 Insights into the original provenance of these images are provided byJames Cunningham's description that " in some [temples] the halo which usually invests the head is carved to resemble the expanded hood of snakes. "I72 Earlier in 802, Fell described an image of"Parsvanath" wth h "five expanded serpent hoods" in one of the shrines to the east of stupa I.173 Given Fell's lack of familiarity with Indian iconography, one may assume that he was referring to one of the nagas in question. The temple(s) described by Fell and Cunningham must have been destroyed during the early "excavations" at the site, following which at least one of the nagas was moved to the eastern platform, where it was found by Maisey.174 164 Harle I974,42.

An increasing Visnuiza- tion ofnaga sculptures has also been noted. A third development that is intricately bound up with the second is an increasing "royalization" of naga iconography. All of these processes are well illustrated at Ferozpur, an early settlement about 2.5 kilometers to the west of Gulgaon where a group of naga sculptures are now housed in a makeshift temple at the western edge of the modern village. The group, consisting of a free-standing ndga and naginz, and a grooved lotiform bell capital surmounted by two naga-nagin couples standing back-to-back, was described in some detail by Williams (figs. 27, 28).175 The wider archaeological context of these important sculptures, however, has not been consid- ered. The recent discovery of Buddhist monastic remains on the summit of Ferozpur hill, and a large irrigation embankment further to the west, provide a crucial ritual and political context for the sculp- tures.176 In terms of style, iconography, and ornamentation, the Ferozpur sculptures belong to a unified idiom typified by the Gupta ndgas already discussed. For example, the naga's dhott, vanamdald, torque, and crown, with its three circular lobes and central kirztamukuta, are all closely related to the Sanchi ndgas. Also notable is the treatment of the nagints anatomy and clothing, which are almost identical to those of the temple 31 ndgini at Sanchi. There are also stylistic and iconographic parallels between Ferozpur and the ndga in the Udayagiri Varaha panel (discussed below). For example, the aquatic plants on the abacus of the bell capital are treated in an almost identical manner to those on the Varaha panel. This feature means that the standing nagas are, like the kneeling naga figure at Udayagiri, con- ceived as rising out of the primordial waters. It is also significant here that as with the other nagas, there are obvious iconographic parallels with the Visnu figures at Udayagiri (fig. 25). Despite these parallels, Williams suggests that the Ferozpur sculptures are closer to the Sanchi ndgas in date (first half of the fifth century CE), largely on account of the "planar organization, static pose, and heaviness in the articulation of the legs. "I77 The significance of these chronological and iconographic observations is made clearer by the pow- erful regal associations of the Ferozpur sculptures which, I would like to argue, help to strengthen the view that the kneeling naga at Udayagiri is a symbolic reference to the Naga dynasty and its relation- ship to the Guptas. The first royal allusion at Ferozpur is the crown worn by the free-standing ndga and the ndgas depicted on the pillar capital; it is similar to that worn by the kneeling figure at Uday- agiri. The second imperial reference is the pillar capital (fig. 28), which, as noted by Williams, is closely related to the Budhagupta pillar at Eran.178 Many of the free-standing pillars in the Gupta period embody much older imperial symbolism developed during the Mauryan period. Indeed, some, such as the small four-lioned pillar capital at Sanchi and the Iron Pillar at Delhi, are direct copies of Mauryan originals.179 In light of the Gupta's archaizing tendencies, therefore, it is not too far-fetched to sug- I75 Williams I976, pls.

I4I. 45</page><page sequence="42">gest that the back-to-back arrangement of the ndga-nagini capital at Ferozpur may also have been a pun on the original Asokan pillar at Sanchi crowned by two pairs of addorsed lions. In William's words, the elegant recasting of Mauryan-derived cliches to represent serpents rising from a pond and crowned by celestial hoods shows the sophistication of the alamkaras, or poetic conceits, favoured in Sanskrit poetry. The folk image had been taken over by the " great " or uniformitarian tradition.8?0 Certainly, their transposition into a sculptural idiom usually reserved for symbols of royalty or for "orthodox" deities suggests some reorientation in the ritual and political status of the naga cult dur- ing the Gupta period. However, I would argue that the process is more complex than a simple case of cultic integration or Sanskritization, as suggested by Williams. The naga cult had long since been aligned with the "great" tradition in the form of the Bhagavata cult; the fact that the nagas during the Gupta period begin to look more and more like Visnu can be seen as a culmination of a long-standing ambivalence between Vaisnava and naga traditions. Further, I would argue that the Ferozpur sculp- tures, with their strong imperial references, have a deeper political significance connected with the changing dynamics of the relations between the Naga and Gupta houses during the first half of the fifth century CE. The epigraphical evidence discussed in part I suggests that the conflict between the western and eastern halves of the Gupta empire may have led to a reassertion of Naga power in the Vidisha area. I propose, therefore, that the Ferozpur sculptures, by symbolically conflating the polit- ical power of the Nagas as kings with the divine power of nagas as deities, can be seen as a direct com- petitive reference to the Gupta's symbolic identification with Visnu. Further support for viewing the nagas as having both cultic and regal associations is provided by their location at the edge of a dried- up irrigation reservoir. On the one hand this reflects the traditional link between nagas and water; it may also be a symbolic reference to the patronage of the Naga clan.18i Udayagiri The serpent idiom also figures prominently at Udayagiri, whose sculpted panels and caves are directly connected with the patronage of the Gupta court and its alignment with Vaisnavism. The most obvious illustration is the gesa Narayana panel in cave I3, in which Visnu is shown lying on a bed of serpent coils in the interval between two periods of creation.182 Although the iconographic roots of the gesa Narayana idea, formally speaking, follow a trajectory distinct from that of the Balarama images discussed in this paper, it would be surprising, given the long-entwined history of Bhagavata and naga iconography in the region, if the panel did not trigger more place-bound identifications in the minds of local visitors: the n,dga, quite literally, is supporting Visnu. Elsewhere, for example, it has been sug- gested that the image of Visnu resting on the serpent gesa "indicates the subordination of the non- I80 Williams I976,179. I8I Similarly, Bakker (in press) has suggested that the Vakataka-period ndga image found in a "burial shaft" at Mansar was part of a memorial to Prabhavati Gupta, the Vakataka queen descended from mixed Naga-Gupta stock. I82 Williams I982, pl. 39. 46</page><page sequence="43">Brahmanical divinity of the agricultural masses to the Brahmanical god Narayana Visnu. "I83 At the same time, however, the coils can also be seen aspart of Visnu's body, just as in earlier free-standing images the naga coils were part ofBalarama's body. This possible appropriation, or even subordination, metaphor is even clearer in the second serpent reference at Udayagiri: the lower right-hand corner of the Varaha panel in cave 5 shows a naga kneel- ing in a position of supplication at Varaha's feet and belittled by the latter's gigantic proportions (fig. 29). With its anthropomorphic body and thirteen-headed serpent canopy, it is similar to the earlier free-standing nagas in the area. Although the naga wears a turban rather than a crown, the central, cir- cular kirttamukuta torque is almost identical to that on the crowns of the Sanchi examples; although the lion element is damaged, the triangular fan of pearls below is clearly visible (fig. 30). Central to the debates regarding the political dimensions of the panel, is the question of the iden- tity of the second kneeling figure behind the naga just described.184 Some scholars have viewed him as Chandragupta II, whose depiction as a devotee of Visnu accords with the associated inscription in cave 4.185 The second theory, which may not be mutually exclusive of the first, is that Varaha, shown rescuing the goddess Earth (Bhumi) from the primordial ocean, is an allegoric reference to Chandra- gupta's restoration of political and moral order after years of Ksatrapa domination.186 The supplicant naga figure, from either standpoint, is viewed as a representative of the Naga dynasty, whose complex relationship of alliance, loyalty, rivalry, and subordination to the Gupta empire is borne out in the textual and epigraphical sources discussed in part I. Further, it has been argued that the site was intri- cately bound up with astronomical principles aimed at predicting key events in the agricultural year; the manipulation of water, in particular, seems to be a key element at the site.i87 Given the Guptas' known involvement in agrarian expansion in the form of Brahmanical land grants, it is tempting to see an additional layer of meaning in the relationship between Varaha and the naga in the Udayagiri panel. Both are shown emerging from the primordial waters, with the naga being pushed back down with the force ofVaraha's foot on his head: could it be that the Guptas are presenting themselves as the new masters of the land, thus usurping the position of the local Nagas on the one hand, and the Buddhists on the other, both of whom appear to have been closely connected with the irrigation works in the area?188 This association is most apparent during the Gupta period, but was probably already in 183 Jaiswal I967, 59. 184 Harle (1974, ii) also notes that a similar figure is shown kneeling at the base of the Sesa Narayana in cave 13. 185 The inscription, dated GE 82 (400/OI CE), records the commissioning of the shrine by Chandragupta II's minister, Sabavirasena (Fleet I888a; Sircar I965, 271-272). 186 The rescue of Bhumi has also been linked to the story, retold in a Sanskrit drama, ofChandragupta's rescue of Dhru- vadevl, the wife of his elder brother, Ramagupta (Asher I983). The latter's shameful surrender of his wife to the Sakas is presented as one of the primary factors behind Chandragupta's final campaign against the Sakas. Although some have doubted the historicity of Ramagupta, the local presence of a king of that name in the latter half of the fourth century CE is attested by the discovery of coins and three inscribed Jain images at Vidisha bearing the name Ramjnagupta (Williams I982, 25). Further discussion of these debates and their position within nationalistic Indian historiography is given in Willis, in press. I87 Willis, in press. I88 Discussions with Michael Willis have helped to improve my understanding of this issue. 47</page><page sequence="44">place much earlier, as attested by the spatial and chronological link between naga sculptures, monas- teries, and dams from the first century BCE onwards.189 Further evidence is provided in the form of the Naga coins at Vidisha and the Naga appellations in the Sanchi inscriptions. Beyond the political allegory, the Udayagiri panel's most obvious message is, of course, religious: Visnu emerges from the primordial waters, which, being the traditional abode of nagas, also gives rise to the worshipping serpent king. Again, there seem to be several layers of meaning. First, we have the pun on the ambivalent relationship between Visnu and snakes: although Garuda is the traditional slayer of nagas, Visnu paradoxically embodies the attributes of the latter, as illustrated by his iesa manifestation in cave I3. Second, there may also be some reference to a Sanskritization or "conversion" narrative, whereby a local spirit is being demoted to the position of a Vaisnava devotee. There is also a third layer, which only begins to emerge when we situate the panel within the wider body of naga sculptures discussed in this paper: from the first century BCE onwards, most nagas in the area are closely aligned with the Bhagavata tradition; the process of cultic absorption or appropriation, there- fore, goes back to the much earlier conflation between Balarama and naga iconography. The major shift that occurs during the Gupta period is that Balarama becomes replaced by Visnu in keeping with the shift from the Vyuha to the Avatara system ofVaisnavism. It is tempting to suggest, therefore, that the Udayagiri panel also contains some indirect reference to these internal theological developments, the kneeling naga representing Balarama's submission to the power of Visnu in his boar incarnation. Finally, the full potency of the panel derives from a complex intertwining of both religious and polit- ical symbolic references. The naga image is at the same time the deity and the dynastic symbol, just as Varaha is at the same time Visnu and the royal power of the Guptas. Amacchar The twofold suggestion that Gupta nagas increasingly adopt the attributes of Visnu on the one hand and royalty on the other, is further supported by three naga sculptures documented during the Sanchi survey. The first two, a naga and nagint, were noted at Amacchar, a large settlement on the bank of the river Betwa, I.5 kilometers to the east of the Heliodorus pillar site. The naga (figs. 31, 32), the more complete of the two, stands semi-embedded in the ground amidst a large pile of sculptures ranging in date from around the fifth to the tenth century CE.190 In contrast to the Ferozpur sculp- tures, it does not belong to an immediately identifiable Gupta style. Rather than standing in samapada in the manner of the other nagas described so far, the two-armed deity sits in lalitdsana on a pile of ser- pent coils that rise up the back in a single shaft, extending over the head in a five-headed canopy. Significantly, this position of " royal ease " accords with other indicators of royal stature noted at Sanchi, Ferozpur, and Udayagiri.191 I89 Shaw and Sutcliffe 2003a. I90 Its position within a multiphase Brahmanical complex, including fragments from a large Harihara figure and two lion-cornered abacuses from a Gupta temple (Shaw, forthcoming), attests to the increasing rarity of independent naga cult spots during the Gupta period. 191 Another parallel is the well-known Nagaraja outside cave 19 at Ajanta (Harle 1974, fig. 84), whose royal status is sug- gested by the lalitasana pose and elaborate crown, which follows the same three-lobed circular form as examples from Sanchi and Ferozpur. Interpretations of this figure are usually confined to a purely religious framework. E.g., Cohen 48</page><page sequence="45">Further idiosyncrasies include the fact that instead of the usual circular halo-like canopy, the indi- vidual serpent heads overlap each other and protrude at a pronounced horizontal angle to form a pro- tective shelter over the deity's head. The figure's body is heavily eroded, but the lines of a transparent dhotis and a sash tied in a simple knot at the center of the waist can still be made out. A sacred thread (yajnopavita) is visible over the left shoulder, strong evidence of the deity's Brahmanical identity. The right arm is bent at the elbow, with an unidentifiable object held against the chest. The fact that Balarama images are often shown in a similar pose, with a wine-glass held against the chest,192 pro- vides clues as to the image's possible Vaisnava associations. Multiple beaded bangles, found on some of the earlier yaksa figures, adorn the wrists. Dating is complicated by the absence of direct parallels, as well as the heavily eroded state of the sculpture. Yet one detail in particular suggests a Gupta date: the left hand holds a bunch of lotus flowers, the stalks of which bend with pronounced fluidity upwards and over the shoulders, leaving the flowers to adorn the left side of the body (fig. 32). One of the flowers is a closed bud; the other is fully expanded, its concave appearance accentuated by the deeply carved striations on its inner surface. This kind of lively, three-dimensional fecundity finds an almost direct parallel in the flowers held by the Ferozpur ndga (fig. 28). Comparisons can also be made with the aquatic plants on the Varaha panel at Udayagiri. Additional support for a Gupta date is provided by the accompanying nagini(fig. 33), which, with serpent coils piled horizontally up the back, follows a more conventional iconography. Although only the lower half survives, enough detail remains to make direct comparisons with the ndgin outside tem- ple 31 at Sanchi (fig. 26): the position of the left hand, resting on the hip and gripping a fold of the transparent garment between the second and third fingers, is almost identical to the Sanchi figure. Another shared attribute is the manner in which the striated sash is looped over the right hip. Devalkhera The increasing dissolution of the distinction between Vaisnava and ndga iconographic programs dur- ing the Gupta period reaches a climax in the final image in this group, a syncretic Visnu-naga sculp- ture found at Devalkhera, an early settlement near Morel-khurd in the eastern part of the survey area (fig. 34). The four-armed image is broken in two, but apart from the missing upper right hand and a small section below the chest, the sculpture is almost complete. The upper left hand holds a sankha, with a personified gada and cakra in the lower right and left hands respectively. The most obvious par- allel is the larger of the two cave 6 Visnu images at Udayagiri (fig. 25). Unfortunately, the outer detail of the face and headdress has been damaged, but the square outline of the latter is so close to the crown worn by the Udayagiri Visnu that it can be regarded with confidence as a proper kirztamukuta crown. A transparent dhoti that accentuates the outline of the knees and clings tightly to the area around the genitals is secured by a waist belt; a vananzmald is arranged over the knees. Quite clearly, we are deal- (1998), following on from the associated inscription, views it as a local spirit "assimilated" into the complex as part of the sangha's localization strategies. Consequently, the possibility for wider dynastic references has not been explored. I would argue that given the political and genealogical links between the Vakataka and Naga houses discussed in part I, some reference to a Naga ruler would not have been out of place at Ajanta. I92 Joshi I979, 48-49. 49</page><page sequence="46">ing with a standing Visnu closely related to the a standing Visnu closely related toalthough the Udayagiri Visnu figures, although the rather stocky legs may be suggestive of a slightly later date, more in line with the Sanchi nagas. The most obvious difference, however, is that the Devalkhera image has a serpent rising up its back in horizontal coils, expanding into a seven-headed canopy above its head (figs. 34, 35). This rare form of Visnu may be seen as a variation of the Ananta Narayana theme at Udayagiri, but given the local importance of the Balarama cult in earlier periods, a more plausible explanation is that it forms the culmination of a long history of syncretism between the Vaisnava and naga traditions: just as the Panficaratra tradition had spread into this part of the study area through the appropriation of naga iconography, so does the first Visnu image appear in the guise of a naga. III. NAGAS IN THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL LANDSCAPE The nagas' relationship to both Vaisnavism and Buddhism has been touched upon in this paper, and will form the focus of further discussion in the following two sections. Attention will also be paid to another aspect of the nagas' archaeological setting, that is the ancient reservoirs on whose banks they are often situated. Taken together, these patterns provide a basis for building an integrated model of religious change that considers both the ritual and economic dimensions of the changing dynamics between these religious traditions and their position within the wider cultural landscape. Models of Religious Change: Buddhism and "Local" Agrarian Cults As discussed earlier, scholarship on religious change with regard to early Indian Buddhism has tended to focus on the ritual dimensions of religious experience, drawing heavily on textual accounts of the subordination and ultimate conversion of local deities through the power of the Buddha's teachings. Because nagas preside over specific places, their assimilation into Buddhism is viewed as a crucial ele- ment of the sangha's "localization" in new areas.193 The assumption behind this kind of approach is that there was a pan-Indian naga cult that was assimilated by Buddhism. It is important to assess the degree to which the patterns at Sanchi fit with this model. The first point to stress is that in central India, there is no material evidence for nagas or yaksas prior to the mid-first century BCE . The earliest free-standing nagas at Nagauri and Gulgaon post-date the establishment of Buddhism by around two hundred years, while in the outlying areas they do not appear before the first century BCE. It is important to consider explanations for these patterns. While there is every possibility that these "local" deities were worshipped in non-durable forms, it is per- haps necessary to question the validity of the traditional distinction between "Buddhist" and "non- Buddhist" deities, which presupposes that nagas were suppressed or appropriated by Buddhism. For a more nuanced understanding, we should distinguish between the practice and the representation of the naga cult. For example, serpent worship no doubt existed, as it does today, throughout ancient India, but in many divergent forms. The appearance oficonographic and stylistic conventions for re- I93 Cohen I998, 377-378. 50</page><page sequence="47">presenting nagas is something altogether different, and it seems not unreasonable to suggest that this could have formed part of the cultural package that accompanied the spread of Buddhism, urbaniza- tion, and state-formation from its cradle in the Gangetic valley area.194 At first glance there is little to suggest any real spatial connection with neighboring Buddhist sites: the first time any parallel can be drawn with the patterns observed by Cohen at Ajanta, or Fa Hsien in eastern India, is during the Gupta period, when to the construction ofnaga shrines within the monastic complex on Sanchi hill itself. The motives behind this kind of assimilation appear to be quite different, however: given that Buddhism had already been established in the area for around seven hundred years, it is doubtful that we are dealing with a mechanism for "localizing" the satngha. More importantly, though, the installation of these shrines appears to be a culmination of a much older history of interaction between monks and nagas. Although all of the pre-Gupta nagas were situated at a distance from Buddhist sites, as typified by the first-century-BCE naga at Nagauri, the latter's posi- tion is less at odds with later patterns than it at first appears: once the Buddhist monuments on Sanchi hill ate viewed as components of an interconnected, early-historic landscape that includes the reser- voir and settlement at Nagauri, the naga ceases to be "external" to the monastic complex. Elsewhere I have suggested that the naga was placed here to guard the Buddhist relic at Sanchi from afar.195 At the same time, it overlooks the reservoir because of its association with water and fertility. Fa Hsien's accounts show that by the Gupta period, naga shrines were placed within monastic settings precisely because of the nagas' ability to ensure adequate rainfall and, in turn, agricultural success. The posi- tioning ofnaga shrines on dams is entirely in keeping with such a model, particularly since, as sug- gested elsewhere, the sangha appears to have played a role in the management of local irrigation.196 Naga worship was thus part of Buddhist practice, not because the sangha sought to convert local pop- ulations, but rather because its effects were in harmony with the sangha's wider economic concerns with water-harvesting and agrarian production. This hypothesis, based on the relative configuration of dams, settlements, and monasteries in the Sanchi area, as well as similar patterns in western India and Sri Lanka, forms part of an active model of religious change which suggests that monks moved into new areas with a set of incentives for locals to give their economic support to the monastery.I97 The development of sophisticated water-harvesting systems was a means of alleviating suffering (dukha), as well as an instrument for generating patronage networks. Additional evidence, discussed earlier, for the sangha's monopolization of the rain-making business supports, the impression of a re- ligious institution deeply embedded in the rural infrastructure. The placement of nagas, the ritual 194 I am grateful to Michael Willis for helpful discussions on this issue. 195 Shaw 2000ooob. I96 Shaw and Sutcliffe 20zoo03a. 197 Ibid. Parallels may be drawn here with functional models of religious change as developed in relation to the spread of Islam and Christianity. Eaton (1993, 264-297), for example, has shown how, in contrast to the traditional "conver- sion by the sword" theory, the acceptance of Islam in east Bengal was intricately tied up with the introduction of new agrarian schemes. Others such as Peel (I968, I24-I25) have used medical analogies to understand the spread of Chris- tianity in west Nigeria, arguing that each religious "technique" is viewed as an independent means of reaching cer- tain spiritual or social goals, just as a new cough medicine may be used alongside a traditional flu remedy. 5I</page><page sequence="48">channel for the sangha's rain-making activities, next to the reservoirs - the ultimate symbol of the effects of timely rainfall on the one hand and skillful water-storage techniques on the other - would have helped to build greater trust between the sangha and local farming communities. Nagas and Vaisnavism Another important pointh the sculptural patterns across the landscape as a whole, s that from the mid-first century BCE, local naga deities had already been undergoing a process of cultic integration: when they first move into the rural, hinterland areas, they do so within a Brahmanized mold, that is, as Balarama. While this point could be taken as evidence against their posited link with Buddhism, it should be reiterated that as a deity of fertility and agriculture, Balarama is simply a naga with the addition of a plough and pestle. It is possible that the question of his sectar- ian affiliations was of little concern to local inhabitants, who may have seen him as a naga standing, as expected, at the edge of a body of water. The assumption is, therefore, that Buddhist monks were less concerned withgas' shifting sectarian affiliations than with their perceived inhtarian affiliations than with their per, i.e. their ability to ensure climatic stability. However, while we cannot assume a direct sectarian link between Balarama in his naga form and the Pancaratra material at Vidisha, it is significant to note that Balarama's position on ancient dams accords with evidence from northern Madhya Pradesh that sim- ilar linkages may have existed between the Pancavira tradition and water bodies.i98 By the first cen- tury CE, the link between Naga-Balarama and Vira-Samkarsana manifests itself in the sculptural record through the co-existence of Balarama in both his serpent and non-serpent form at Andher. It is not until the Gupta period, though, that the Vaisnava orientation of these images becomes explicit, with many depicting either Visnu himself, or attributes closely associated with Visnu. Interestingly, this is also when naga shrines become incorporated into the monastic compound at Sanchi for the first time. In this light, the nagas at Sanchi are less a concession to "local" folk cults than to the Brahman- ical tradition. Indeed, it is from the Gupta period onwards that we start to witness the increasing prominence of Brahmanical deities at Buddhist sites. These points raise interesting questions about the changing focus of religious patronage between the second century BCE and the fifth century CE. They are also suggestive of a growing level of competition between Buddhism and Brahmanism with regard to agrarian production. This view is supported by wider evidence for the growth ofBrahman- ical land grants during the Gupta period. 198 Of particular note is a painted Brahml inscription from a rock shelter in Shivpuri district, not far from the rock-painted depiction ofSamkarsana and Vasudeva at Tikula (district Gwalior) mentioned in note 65. This refers to a person called Sivarakhi who, as a devotee of Krsna, caused a rock shelter (?) and a tank to be constructed (Neumeyer 1992-1993). 52</page><page sequence="49">CONCLUSION The new body of material presented in this paper has contributed to our understanding of early-his- toric religion in several important ways. First, the identification of a number of early Balarama images closely aligned to the naga tradition has provided insights into the hitherto neglected subject of how the Bhagavata cult, as represented by the Heliodorus pillar site in Vidisha, spread into surrounding rural areas. Second, the shifting trends in the stylistic and spatial treatment of naga sculptures between the first century BCE and the fifth century CE can be shown to reflect the changing relationship between Buddhism, Brahmanism, and local cults. On a more general level, the approach described in this paper has broken ground by combining the methods of formal art-historical analysis with those developed in landscape archaeology, and by examining the spatial and temporal distribution of sculp- ture throughout the archaeological landscape as a whole. Such an approach has provided a multi- layered ritual context for the Buddhist and Vaisnava remains at Sanchi and Vidisha, sites which have hitherto dominated the understanding of local religious history. It also demonstrates that these re- ligious developments were not isolated processes, but part of a wider set of cultural and economic developments, such as the spread of urbanization and new agrarian policies. Finally, the argument that the sculptures doubled as representations of the local Naga dynasty supports the view, also suggested by numismatic and epigraphic evidence, that the Nagas were powerful local oligarchs closely con- nected with the patronage of Buddhist and agricultural building projects in the area. Both their role as facilitators of agrarian expansion and their identification with a totemic deity are features more commonly associated with the Guptas (and their link with Visnu), who from the fourth century CE appear to have usurped the Nagas' authority in the area.
