<plain_text><page sequence="1">Chronicle FILMS BEFORE catching up with current events I should like to recall The Great Adventure, Arne Suckdorff's Swedish nature film, which ran at the Astor during the autumn. It may return to Dublin another time, but let us hope it goes into general circulation in the provinces, since the countryman will, I feel, be absorbed and delighted by it. All credit is due to Disney (Nature's Half Acre and The Living Desert) for the patient microscopic eye that revealed the growth of plants and intimacies of animal life which few countrymen can have observed personally. But a fatuous commentary, and "comical" music besides, expressed a grossly sentimental and anthropomorphic attitude. People are delighted and reassured to find that animals are just gawky and pathetic imitations of humans. But the look in the eye of Suckdorff's young fox is not distorted: it is alert, curious, clever and cruel. The lynx, the fox, the otter, the woodcock are caught magnificently, absorbed in their own life. The setting is more limited and domestic than Disney's: we are never far from the farmyard, the house, reapers with the gun at the ready for a fox. Here is not the range of nature which Disney so spec tacularly presented, or the magnificent colours of the American continent; but (caught in black and white) the spirit, the atmosphere and the poetry of a farm in central Sweden. "I remember it all now," begins the commentary?and so we do, for these are our latitudes too, the corn stacked silently in the moonlight, the stormy light of September flaring on frantic waves, loam followed by snow, and the eternal tide of spring filling in from the south with returning cranes high in the evening skies. Not that the film is merely an exercise in seasonal nostalgia. The rapid symbolic shots of the four seasons is a clich? difficult to avoid in nature films; but Suckdorff's glance at this theme is only cursory. He chooses his scenery, as he chooses his favourite animals, according to personal mood and fancy, and if he has a favourite season it is high spring and early summer. The opening sequence of this film is a magical composition of early mist and daylight, dew beaded on grass and cobwebs, drippings from above and bubbles from below the surface of the river. His eye for delicate linear beauty (here, and in other shots such as the saplings shadowed on the snow or white birches soaring into the sky), might be rivalled by other directors, but no film I know has suggested the seriousness of nature like this one. This is partly due to the use of a magnetophone which has collected all the</page><page sequence="2">752 THE FURROW vivid suckings, breathings and cries of the forest. And this flavour is strangest in that climactic episode of spring?the mating of the woodcock, which is proud, savage and magnificently ceremonial. The vitality of this film then derives from Suckdorff's devotion to certain aspects of his world, and a personal poetic style of com position which is in no way consciously "arty." In fact the film as a whole is not as artful or satisfactory a unit as, for instance, Flaherty's Louisiana Story. It falls into two parts : the first being the story of the fox cubs; the second a story of an otter rescued and secretly held captive by two boys on the farm (one of them being Suckdorff's own son). The connection between the two parts is casual (though this hardly jars at all), but the attempt to view the natural world in the second story through the eyes of the boys is not asuccess. The vision remains adult on the whole; it is a song of experience in which the boys do not sing the principal part, engag ingly as they do their own piece. The most startling sequence, in which the camera enters the eye of a fox who has just been shot and is making his last desperate and dizzy flight, shows how Suckdorff has identified himself in reflection and sympathy with the great adventure. By the habit of a lifetime the animal world absorbs him; he cannot project himself into boyhood again. Two ambitious and serious American films have come to Dublin in November: Blackboard Jungle to the Adelphi, and East of Eden to the Capitol. The former has perhaps been taken seriously in the wrong way. It was withdrawn from the Venice Festival at the instigation of Claire Booth Luce, who thought it might slander American school-life. It is a frightful picture of a tough high-school, but it can scarcely be taken as a general indication ,since it is not presented as typical. We are shown at one point the other sort of school where "the kids" keep off the grass and play ball in regulation dress. The teacher-hero (played admirably throughout by Glenn Ford) regards the "garbage-can" as a special case, and his job there as a special challenge or mission. It is simply that the school caters for an area of urban juvenile delinquency, and the film studies this modern jungle as it spreads into the school. As so often happens, the study is more convincing than the solution. The headmaster (not sufficiently credibilized, I think) will not look at the problem and the older teachers have capitulated or com promised, so that the gang element dictates in class, both to the sheep and the shepherd. Dadier, the new English teacher, tries to break up this?by humour, by toughness, by patience and by</page><page sequence="3">CHRONICLE 753 trying "to break through" to them, to understand their factitious hostility to society. In suggesting motives or pseudo-motives for lawless malignity the film does not probe very deeply or undertake much social analysis. Of the two articulate characters, Millar, the negro boy, feels that nobody cares whether he makes a success of his school period?neither his parents, nor teachers. To support this, the camera sketches in (very slightly) the broken-down urban background with its hotch-potch of Jews, negroes, half-castes, Irish and Italians. We may deduce parental unconcern, perhaps ; and in fact the concern of the teacher Dadier begins to win over the negro boy. On the other hand, West, the gangleader and centre of opposition feels that he is cosh-king on the streets, and that he knows more of real life than any teacher. ("This is my school. Boy, what I could teach you . . .") He has picked up a vague justification, vacuous, second-hand, from the disillusioned post-war adult world around him. Why should he take notice of school? In a year or two somebody will come along and say?"you join up now and be a hero . . . And then you get your bloody head blown off . . ." The film points accurately to the dependence of the rest, in their common unsureness, on the leader; and to the com monly observed characteristics of the type?the posing, the ruffled head, sullen lip, hands-in-pockets, wad-chewing facade, so pathe tically imitative and synthetic in its turn; and here, in the end, so cowardly dependent on the gang-support. Here are the elements of the pseudo-personality, which is the common denomination of "teddy-boys" and other such youth-gangs in the cities of Europe, England, and America: and which has been analysed in a recent book of Karl Bednarik's The Young Worker of Today. In view of the effect of films themselves on the mentally under-developed, it may not be too curious or unfair to note in this context the cult of Marlon Brando. All that is wrong with Vic Morrow's very fine performance in this role is, perhaps, too close a resemblance to the mannerisms of Brando. The film's surest touch is the contrast with this character of a real personality, that of the negro, gifted, musical, sympathetic and idealist as he turns out to be. Another is the scene where the boys lure the weak soft-hearted mathematics teacher to play his jazz records to them in class, deceiving him with sudden friendliness and then turning on him and smashing every record in a frenzy of vandalism. There at least the teacher working in a normafworld will recognise the schoolboys' perennial instinct for the weak, and their consequent callous and cowardly cruelty?enlarged, thought it be,</page><page sequence="4">754 THE FU&amp;R?W to monstrous growth. Dadier's classes are neatly and tensely handled, teetering as they do between moods of dangerous badinage and sudden violent rebellion. Absolutely considered, the violence in this film (e.g. the beating-up of the two teachers in the alley, the final knife-slash) does not compare with the G.I. brutality o? From Here to Eternity or that of recent Italian and French films. It is shocking, however, in the classroom. Some viewers find the psychological victory of Dadier and the sudden collapse of West in the last sequence improbable. A more definite fault is the American one of over-plugging the commercial, spoiling the moral or message by over-emphasis. When Dadier's wife (Anne Francis) finally com prehends his ideals she utters such words as these: "Kids are people ... and people are worthwhile_What everybody needs is sympathy etc. etc." Banality is increased by fervour at such a point, and, to give him his due, Glenn Ford looks particularly uncomfortable as he listens. This is but a minor blemish on a responsible, adult film; optimistic film too, though with a tougher and more realistic optimism than Father Flanagan's. Dadier "breaks through" in the end at the visual-aid level. He awakens interest and mental reaction by showing a movie of Jack and the Beanstalk. But two of the leaders are incorrigible and he gets rid of them. Even if the cockle is not to be turned, this film recognises that there is always cockle and that, for the sake of the wheat, it must get separate treatment. East of Eden (at the Capitol, in Cinemascope and Warner-Colour). This film-version of an episode from Steinbeck's novel mercifully escapes from the heavy and pretentious Biblical parallels of the book. Only once is the story of Caleb and Aron explicitly allegorised, and the film as a result is a neater and clearer affair. Steinbeck's feeling for the various natures of love survives and is clarified as the basic theme of the film. Set in a California!! town of forty years ago, the main story is that of the rivalry of the two brothers, Cal and Aron, for first place in their father's affection, and, later, for the same girl, Abra. Aron is in possession in both instances, when the story opens. Adam, the austere father, "full of conscience and forgiveness" according to common estimate, is a lonely man whose wife had left him twenty years before. He feels akin to his elder son Aron, but cannot understand the unhappy, unsettled Cal. Cal himself senses that he takes after his mother, and discovers by chance that she is a "fallen woman," running the "toughest house on the coast," in a town across the mountains. His desperate, awkard attempts to win his father's recognition and love lead nowhere, and he stakes all on recouping Adam for the</page><page sequence="5">CHRON?CL? 755 total loss they have suffered in a farming experiment. His mother, lonely also, bitterly and wryly reflecting on Adam's righteous conscience, lends Cal several thousand dollars. In the boom for beans during the first World War Cal succeeds, and presents the fruits to his father. They are rejected as the price of blood, and Cal, maddened by this supreme rejection, introduces his brother Aron to their fallen mother. In horrified revulsion Aron rushes away with the enlisting soldiers (presumably to meet his death); and Adam has a heart-attack. At the end, however, he accepts, for the first time, Cal's services; moved by Abra the girl. She crystallizes, from her own story, the theme of loneliness; the loneliness which all the characters have suffered because of the distortions of love. For love has been distorted by corruption, by over-righteousness, by blind idealization. Abra herself, engaged to Aron, had been afraid of his idealized image of herself, and is spite of her efforts to resist is drawn to Cal. The theme, and its direction, are thus somewhat static and cir cuitous, but James Dean as Cal crowns a first-class performance by managing a very difficult emotional climax. Julie Harris as Abra is equally winning; and Jo Van Fleet as the mother gives one of the best supporting performances of the year, notably in the finely directed scene when she and Cal recognise their psychological affinity. Parts of the film however are violently over-directed by Elia Kazan (director of On the Waterfront and A Streetcar Named Desire, and exponent of a very personal style which tends to be over-emphatic and explosive). The direction is intended, no doubt, to emphasize the jerky, blundering, uncertain character of Cal; but it is at times too emphatic, or rather disproportionately stressed. This is notably true of the early scene where Cal hides among the ice-blocks and glares at Aron and Abra. At this stage we have not yet fully caught Kazan's style, which remains, of course, intriguing and original. This early scene and many others can be compared with the absolute and plausible validity of two others?the scene where Cal and his mother become en rapport, and the scene where Abra admits to her reluctant instinct for Cal. There, the oblique mannerism of Kazan is dropped, and the actors can indulge in direct acting. The end of the film is marred only by a violently exaggerated "character-study" of the Hard-Bitten Nurse. Para doxically enough this film is worth visiting as much for the flavour of Kazan as for Steinbeck's diluted broodings on love. PETER CONNOLLY St. Patrick's College, Maynooth</page></plain_text>
