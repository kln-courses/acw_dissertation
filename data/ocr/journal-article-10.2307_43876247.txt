Roger Caillois 19351 Who am I? If this once I were to rely on a proverb, then perhaps everything would amount to knowing whom I "haunt." André Breton 19282 A curious garden has alighted on the newly made-over MoMA, the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Not visible from the gallery itself, since it is on the roof, Ken Smith's camouflage garden is modeled on the generic splotchy pattern of army uniforms and military machines. Smith's garden is presented as "ironic" and a "subversion of camouflage's function to hide or conceal."3 Such commentary is intended to allude to the artifice of the practice of landscape architecture, where the fake natural is used to disguise "ugly" elements in the environment. Yet this is an underreading of both the garden, and the nature of camouflage. The interpretation of camouflage as intentional disguise is a kind of misprision. The function of camouflage is not simply to hide or conceal. It is a symptom of the perplexing and paradoxical relationship of self and other, and the positioning of an object within its milieu. Camouflage and mimicry are predicated on concepts of simulation and resemblance, and the desire to produce and discern likeness is ingrained in human experience. In his 1933 essay, "On the Mimetic Faculty," Walter Benjamin aligned mimetic imitation, or mimicry, with all of the "higher functions" of humanity, and pointed to a time when the "law of similarity" governed life, ruling both "microcosm and macrocosm."4 Benjamin conceived of mimesis as a powerful impulse, and a desire to assimilate the self into the other, a social practice, as a foundation for art and language, stating, "Nature creates similarities. One need only think of mimicry. The highest capacity for producing similarities, however, is man's. His gift of seeing resemblances is nothing other than a rudiment of the powerful compulsion in former times to become and behave like something else. Perhaps there is none of his higher functions in which his mimetic faculty does not play a decisive role."5 As a social practice, mimicry is inherently anthropomorphic, a subjective rather than objective perception. Roger Caillois, in "Mimicry and Legendary Psychasthenia" (1933), alluded to the anthropomorphic aspect of mimicry, noting that "the resemblance exists solely in the eye of the beholder."6 The arbitrariness of apparent camouflage could be illustrated in a landscape context with a plant such as the Chinese Quince, Pseudocydonia sinensis. The bark of the Chinese Quince bears an uncanny resemblance to camouflage patterning, it looks as though is has been painted in Flecktarn.7 The finding of resemblance, however, lies with the beholder, there is no necessary intent on the part of the tree to camouflage itself in such a fashion. Instead it presents the curious spectacle of nature camouflaged as 'nature.' Camouflage plays an important role in the world of art, far beyond that alluded to in Peter Reed's reference to similarities between Smith's garden and Andy Warhol's Camouflage series, some of which are held by MoMA. The links between 17</page><page sequence="3">the abstracting of nature into camouflage patterns and subsequently into this faux-natural garden are giddily circular. As a shift from the often brightly colored uniforms worn by the military, naturalistic camouflage patterns were developed early in the twentieth century, and became widely used in both World Wars. Artists such as Franz Marc, Arshile Gorky, László Moholy-Nagy and Ellsworth Kelly were enlisted amongst the 'camoufleurs', artists, designers and architects, who developed the various "disruptive pattern" schemes used in battledress and for military equipment. British artist Norman Wilkinson developed the unlikely "dazzle" camouflage to be used at sea, creating a series of patterns based on Cubist principles. Rather than attempting to disguise the ship by means of blending in, the dazzle approach breaks up the surface through the use of line and color, accepting that within the constantly changing conditions of sea and sky, to attempt a perfect color match was not possible. Instead, patches of bright or contrasting colors and lines were used to counter the actual shape and size of the craft, for example taking a dark color around the bow, from port to starboard, to create a sense of ambiguity about the length of the ship. While the ships were made to appear quite visible in an absolute sense, they were deceptive in terms of their form and scale, and speed and direction, and thus the dazzle scheme underscores the paradoxical relationships between self and other that underlie any philosophy of camouflage. Bernard Lassus echoes these observations on the apparent incongruity of camouflage. Recalling a 1969 stroll along a quay in Stockholm, the French landscape architect tells how he was "suddenly pulled up short. Emerging from the vegetable mass of building sections I thought I saw in the distance, on the port's horizon, there materialized before me the shape of a long and powerful warship. It had remained hidden thanks to its camouflage. Until then I had thought that camouflage was reserved for the land army. But here the pattern of a paratrooper's battledress, mainly green but also strewn with maroon and streaked with some black, represented a design that had grown to envelop the whole of the boat."8 The absurdity of a sea-going ship painted in the colors of the land is perplexing, and not unlike the vision of a camouflage garden marooned on the roof of MoMA. At MoMA the act of camouflage, of a garden simulating a simulation of nature, amplifies the ambivalence that lies at the heart of mimicry. Through the replication of things beyond one's self there comes a sense of porosity and fluidity with the environment. One collapses into one's context, whether from the perspective of an insect or a human. Notions of doubling, uncanniness and mirroring haunt camouflage and mimicry, and are embedded within the perspectives of alterity and selfhood. Roger Caillois destabilized the benign reading of mimicry, presenting a psychoanalytical examination where the dialogue between self and environment is called into question. Caillois drew attention to the lack of a rational connection between camouflage and survival, and as Dawn Ades explained, both Caillois and fellow camouflage essayist, Jacques Delamain, "challenge any neat division between scientific classification of natural phenomena and poetic metaphors found in nature."9 Caillois pointed out that the adaptation hypothesis of camouflage is flawed in numerous ways. For example, insects which are unpalatable anyway are still camouflaged, as are insects which are hunted by smell, which makes any efforts at visual disguise redundant. Some insects are so well- camouflaged that they are pruned by gardeners, or the "even sadder" case of the Phyllia, who "browse among themselves, taking each other for real leaves..."10 or cannot find each other when it comes time to mate. The enigma of disguise as display is evident in the Oxyrrhyncha, or spider crabs, who 18 HMS Argus (14g) in harbor in 1918, painted in dazzle camouflage.</page><page sequence="4">"haphazardly gather and collect on their shells the seaweed and polyps of the milieu in which they live ... decking[ing] themselves in whatever is offered to them, including some of the most conspicuous elements..."11 Caillois went on to argue that mimicry is thus a "luxury and even a dangerous luxury."12 In fact, camouflage is an act of renunciation of self, a dispossession through mutation. The premise of camouflage as a form of protection and disguise is thus undone, and Caillois reveals its anti-Darwinian tendency, the notion of the instinct d'abandon, the instinct to abandon one's self, a motivation more akin to Freud's death drive than any survival instinct. Caillois's psychoanalysis linked closely to ideas of space, most powerfully with his allusion to schizophrenia. In this context he noted that the invariable response to the question "Where are you?" is, "I know where I am, but I do not feel as though I'm at the spot where I find myself i"13 At MoMA, the sense of an "absent garden" is amplified by the very fact the work is not visible from the gallery itself, adding to the sense of psychosis through feigning the faux, a haunted other. There is a sense of melancholy which pervades such an absent presence. The renunciation of one's presence is perplexing, as a kind of "derealizing" of the experience of space, as a type of depression. This is the "legendary psychasthenia" that Caillois connected to mimicry, derived from psychologist Pierre Janet's writing. Here, at the "edge of surrealism," the relationships between recognition, estrangement and uncanniness are opened up. The strangeness of the MoMA camouflage garden is in danger of being glossed over through being labelled merely "ironic." Reading the work as surrealistic, however, mines a potent legacy of art, psychoanalysis and formalism that connect the self and camouflage in much more profound and unsettling ways. Caillois had a contentious relationship with surrealism, and was largely marginalised from the mainstream movement of art and literature, yet his influence and connections permeate thinking on the uncanny in many ways. Rosalind Krauss retrospectively applies his approach • to Man Ray's photographs which predate Caillois's writings by a decade, and in her analysis of Return to Reason (1923) she describes how the "nude torso of a woman is shown as if submitting to possession by space."14 Man Ray's explorations of the dissolution of the body into space were subsequently echoed in René Magritte's paintings, such as Discovery (1927), where the shadows cast on the nude form are transfigured into patches of wood grain veneer. These images from Man Ray and Magritte evoke ideas of camouflage through the surface patterning of the female form, the sense of what happens when an "object fuses with an another object."15 Russian Formalist Victor Shklovsky's work on "ostranenie" or "strange making," was closely associated with surrealism.16 Shklovsky identified a number of devices which make a work "strange" in his efforts to discover the literariness of writing, that is what makes a work poetic rather than prosaic. In the context of the MoMA roof garden, the Shklovskian devices of scale play and the undoing of the connection of cause and effect are of particular significance. The garden is also made strange by the use of fake materials as a substitute for real garden components, recalling Shklovsky's description of substitution in Tolstoy's writing, for example in having a story narrated by a horse. Such a shift causes a change in the apprehension of an object or plot, revealing the extraordinary within the ordinary. The defamiliarizing potential of Caillois's theory in the context of a psychoanalytical critique is reinforced by his notion of "diagonal science." As opposed to the precise categories of orthodox science, Caillois's in-between or "diagonal" classifications presented the possibility for unlikely juxtapositions. Poetic visions of science weave through the discourses of surrealism and Russian Formalism, as advocated by Caillois's contemporaries, Breton, Bachelard and Shklovsky. In his "Manifesto of Surrealism" Breton proposed a type of epistemologica! anarchy, because "Our brains are dulled by the incurable mania of wanting to make the unknown known, classifiable."17 It is thus necessary to navigate beyond the known, the rational, into the dark spaces in between. Indeed the lack of a logical connection between camouflage and survival is what Gaston Bachelard might have referred to as an "epistemologica! obstacle," something which stands in the way of a logical connection. Bachelard embraced such illogical empiricism, strange coincidences on the axes of poetry and science, and believed it was necessary to "question everything," "to escape from the rigidity of mental habits formed by contact with familiar experiences."18 In proposing surrationalism, Bachelard wrote, "If one doesn't put one's reason at stake in an experiment, the experiment is not worth attempting."19 Moving across categories in such a way was described by Victor Shklovsky as a "knight's move," where 19</page><page sequence="5">Camouflage stripes: 1. Flecktarn, 2. Chinese Quince, 3. Andy Warhol, 4. Ken Smith</page><page sequence="6">things that are not linearly connected become juxtaposed through an illogical leap. Such unlikely connections created the conditions for "ostranenie."20 Now you see Me Putting the garden on the "couch" reveals much more than a superficial irony in the deployment of camouflage patterning, or a simple statement about artifice in landscape architecture. The camouflage garden is read not as a bravura play on surface, but as a melancholy statement within the urban fabric of Manhattan. Not so much the "apocalyptic wallpaper"21 of Harold Rosenberg, but perhaps a psychasthenic carpet, or even a ghostly mirror. Camouflage is seen not as benign, but as a locus of "dark space" and "magic," and one of the most significant inheritances of Caillois' work was the response from Jacques Lacan, most notably in the development of his essay "The Mirror Stage." Lacan made direct reference to Caillois and his illumination of the subject through "using the terms legendary psychasthenic! to classify morphological mimicry as an obsession with space in its derealizing effect."22 Lacan further developed this notion of the spatial or material mysticism founded in "Mimicry and Legendary Psychasthenia" in his review of Minkowski's "Le Temps vécu", describing, "another space besides geometrical space, namely the dark space of groping hallucination and music, which is the opposite of clear space, the framework of objectivity. We think we can safely say that this takes us into the 'night of the senses,' that is, the 'obscure night' of the mystic."23 Inhabiting this twilight space between an objective abstract pattern, and the troubled subjectivity of the mimic, the garden is something of a haunted Nadja. In André Breton's novel of the same name, the curious Nadja, hovering on the edge of insanity, is characterized by her mimetic skills, taking on various guises and effects, weaving in and out of the city, merging then re-appearing from the milieu. Adding to this twilight zone of mimicry is the construction of the garden in materials which are fake versions of nature - mock rocksand fauxfoliage. This evokesa sense of soul sickness as a commentary on the contemporary human condition within the city. It is a garden with a "malady of the soul," one which reveals how the attempts at concealment paradoxically create a condition of weakness. The garden becomes a microcosm of a societal psychoanalysis, simultaneously pushing and pulling itself through its milieu. Disguise becomes display, and the gallery is like one of Caillois's spider crabs, who in grabbing at the things around it in an "automatic" act of camouflage, unwittingly choose something very obvious and make themselves more conspicuous. So, is this what the designer intended? Ultimately it matters little whether or not this reading is consistent with authorial intention: what matters most is the frisson that comes with reading against the grain. And of course, sometimes a garden is just a garden. Epilogue I am picturing a sprawling metropolis with glass and steel buildings that reach to the sky, reflect it, reflect each other, and reflect you - a city filled with people steeped in their own image who rush about with overdone make-up on and who are cloaked in gold, pearls, and fine leather, while in the next street over, heaps of filth abound and drugs accompany the sleep or the fury of the social outcasts. This city could be New York; it could be any future metropolis, even your own. What might one do in such a city ? Nothing but buy and sell goods and images, which amounts to the same thing, since they both are dull shallow symbols. Those who can or wish to preserve a lifestyle that downplays opulence as well as misery will need to create a space for an "inner zone" - a secret garden, an intimate quarter, or more simply and ambitiously, a psychic life. julia Kristeva, 199524 21</page><page sequence="7">22 endnotes 1 Roger Caillois, "Mimicry and Legendary Psychasthenia," in Roger Caillois, The Edge of Surrealism: A Roger Caillois Reader, ed.
