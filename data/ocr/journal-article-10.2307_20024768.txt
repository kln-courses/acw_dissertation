<plain_text><page sequence="1">FRANK E. MANUEL Israel and the Enlightenment This meditation on israel in the enlightenment passes over the mass of eighteenth century Christian believers who dutifully performed their pre scribed religious ceremonies, while in secret practicing pagan and primitive rites. It is engaged, rather, in converse with priests and bishops, doctors of divinity, professors of theology and ancient languages, and writers in various conditions of independence?literary men who lived on their estates or survived by their wits, philosophes who published journals and were occupied in remolding what Thomas Jefferson called the opinion of mankind. To this heterogeneous group a simple question was posed: What did they make of the ancient God of the Jews who lived among them, sometimes legally as in Holland, more often under murky arrangements as in France, but always on the margin of society? During the period of the Enlightenment there was a growing curiosity about the Jews and their God, as He and His chosen people were becoming more visible. The responses constitute a reappraisal of ancient Judaism by Christians, many of whom were in the course of divesting themselves of the complex theological and dogmatic raiment of their own ancestors. The nature of Judaism?not only the physical existence of the Jews?has always been a prickly subject for Christianity. In the age of the Enlightenment new ways of ending the ambiguous position of Judaism in the bosom of Christendom were proposed. An attempt among certain literate elements of European society to cut the umbilical cord that had bound Christianity to Judaism from the moment of its origin was the most conspicuous break with tradition. More radical thinkers, reaffirming the historical tie with great fanfare, deliberately painted Judaism in gruesome colors to undermine the foundation of their own Christian religion. Others conceived of a new relationship between Judaism and Chris tianity that allowed for their coexistence through a redefinition of the nature of religion itself. / The revolutionary character of the reexamination of Judaism may be communicated more fully if set against the background of Christian views of ancient Judaism that still prevailed on the eve of the Enlightenment. In seventeenth century Christian universal history, the binding of Jewish and 33</page><page sequence="2">34 FRANK E. MANUEL Christian experience was taken for granted. The survival of the Jews was conceived as an eternal punishment for the sin of deicide or as an everlasting witness of the Crucifixion. In the eyes of Catholic theologians, Jews had been burned by the secular arm after an inquisition, not because they were Jews, but because they were relapsed Christians or demons luring Christians to apostasy. The major state religions of western Europe?Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican, and Calvinist?taught that, although the Jews in their stubborn blindness had balked at accepting Jesus as the Messiah, there was one continuous sacred history from Adam through the present; with the insertion of pseudepigrapha, like the books of the Maccabees, and the inclusion of the histories of Josephus, it was possible to join the Old and the New Testaments in an unbroken narrative. The universal history composed by Bossuet, the official churchman of Louis XIV, was really a history of Judaic experience joined to the history of Christianity, with the Roman Empire subordinate to the future needs of the Church, and the Chinese or other pagan histories ignored as having no intrinsic worth. This drove Voltaire in his passion to overturn Bossuet's universe and spitefully to start his world history with the Chinese. Anglican divines of all species?and there were many?adhered to a Bossuet-like central narrative. In his Old and New Testament Connected,1 Humphrey Prideaux revealed the coherence of the divine plan in its totality, Isaac Newton, who devoted thousands of manuscript pages to the subject, many of them now in Jerusalem, fortified the structure with a new method of astronomical dating based on the precession of the equinoxes, and with proofs that in the great civilizing enterprises of mankind?architecture, the laws, the belief in the true God, writing?the Hebrews had preceded all other nations chronologically. Homer had derived his wisdom from Moses, as Clement of Alexandria had affirmed. In the seventeenth century there were many idealized portrayals of ancient Israel as the progenitor of Christianity. The Abb? Fleury's Les Moeurs des Isra?lites (1681) made of it a pastoral utopia that was a pendant to F?nelon's Telemachus. Moses was the great legislator of antiquity, far superior to the nomothetai of the Greeks. In the political debates of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in northern Europe, it was common to draw on Old Testament biblical texts to find sanction for either monarchy, democracy, or aristocracy in a Christian polity; James Harrington in his Oceana even discovered a mixed establishment of the three in Moses' structuring of the Hebrew republic.2 In the lively, often scratchy political pamphleteering of the English Civil War, there was a complete identification of the Commonwealth saints with Israel, and men busied themselves drafting law codes that would incorporate the rules of Deuteronomy down to the last tittle, or almost. The theocracy of Massachusetts was meant to be a literal implementation of the Mosaic code, with a few exceptions. The glorification of the Sabbath as the only day of the Lord and the rejection of Christmas as the residue of a pagan festival were symbolic of the Puritans' self-image as Israelites. The hope of effecting the conversion of the Jews and moving on to the millennium was a common Protestant expectation that lasted well into the eighteenth century. Judah Monis, a rather enigmatic wandering Jew, who came from someplace in the Mediterranean, ended up at Harvard, was given a degree</page><page sequence="3">ISRAEL AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT 35 in 1722, and appointed an instructor in Hebrew after being duly baptized. His formal sermon celebrating that event dealt with the interpretation of the proof texts in the Old Testament on the coming of Christ, supported by rather obscure rabbinic citations.3 Increase Mather, as President of Harvard College, often lectured on the mystery of the survival of the Jews. Among Calvinists, it was only the failure of the Jews to accept Christ that stood in the way of a total approval of Jewish experience. Lutheran tradition was more tightly bound to the Judeophobia of its founder. Christian preoccupation with Judaism became more intense in the Protes tant world as the Old Testament, translated into the vernacular, was widely diffused. It was discovered to be veritably bursting with figures and types of the New Testament. Few verses could not be adapted to demonstrate a pr?figura tion of sacred Christian history that was later fulfilled. Catholic theologians had been engaged in such practices since the time of the Church Fathers; and if the texts illustrating concordances between the Old and New Testaments, such as those of Joachim of Fiore, are no longer commonly read, the idea of their linkage may be quickly grasped through visual examples. A medieval tapestry in the Metropolitan Museum in New York depicts on the lower level scenes represent ing the seven sacraments, while on the upper level are parallel Old Testament events: the anointment of David is a type for the sacrament of extreme unction. Cotton Mather in his Magnalia Christi Americana of 1702 still saw a virtuous contemporary divine in New England as a Bostonian incarnation of an Old Testament figure. It was no burden on a young member of the Massachusetts Bay colony to go about with a weighty name such as Shearjashub. In the wilderness of New England, the colonists were reliving the sufferings of the Israelites. And a bit of rabbinic gematria?the translation of words into numerical equivalents?applied to prophecies in Daniel and Revelation, which conformed to each other, sustained the dating of the Second Coming. The weaving together of pre-Christian Judaism and Christianity was constant in the centuries before the Enlightenment. It was perhaps most complete in the Swiss, Dutch, and English (including the American) scholarly worlds of the seventeenth century. And if hardworking believers could not themselves research the rabbinic commentaries for types, foretellings, and pr?figurations, their pastors?usually chosen for their learning as well as their eloquence?poured something of this knowledge, garnered from the works of Christian Hebraists, into the willing and unwilling ears of members of their churches, who were subjected to a continuous round of sermons on the Holy Sabbath, on special fast days, and on days of thanksgiving. // Christian Hebraism of the seventeenth century occupies a corner in the cemetery of baroque learning, that magnificent age of scholarship when the production of a hundred volumes in a lifetime was considered a feat, but not an unsurpassable one. The grand folios of the Christian Hebraists were produced by the presses of Amsterdam, London, Venice, Leyden, Rome, and Frankfort, and are now preserved in university treasure rooms, rarely disturbed by intruders. Modern scavengers have hardly bothered to pick the bones of these</page><page sequence="4">36 FRANK E. MANUEL worthies or plagiarize them, let alone savor the content of their works. An occasional essay on them has appeared, but few have ventured to encompass the writings of John Seiden, John Lightfoot, John Spencer, and Edward Pocock in England, Johann Buxtorf, father and son, in Basel, the Dutchmen Jan van den Driesche, Adriaan Reeland, Antonius Van Dale, Pieter van der Cun, Wilhelm Surrenhuis, Philipp van Limborch, the heterodox P?re Richard Simon in France, or the scholar who published in Leyden and bore the sonorous name Constantin L'Empereur van Oppick. The bibliographical zenith of this out pouring of Christian Hebraism was reached in the Catholic world with the publication of Giulio Bartolocci's four-volume Bibliotheca Magna Rabbinica de scriptoribus, &amp; scriptis hebraicis (1675-93) by the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith. Often the Christian Hebraists were helped by rabbis or converts, but sometimes they heroically confronted the rabbinic corpus alone, doubtless making egregious errors, but in solitude producing monumental works of interpretation that, in the prearchaeological world and in a primitive period of Oriental philology, transmitted rabbinic thought to Christian divines, littera teurs, and even ordinary middle-class readers possessed by a desire to learn about the ancient religion of the Jews. There was no consensus among the seventeenth century Christian Hebraists about what worth they should bestow upon the interpretations of the Talmud ists and rabbinic commentators. But they were generally prepared to consult them, to learn Hebrew and, less frequently, Aramaic, and to accept their descriptions of the rites of the Hebrews at the time of Christ as indications of the Lord's meaning in difficult passages of the Scriptures. There was a general presumption that Judaism had been frozen for sixteen centuries and that the evidence presented by contemporary Jews and their writings was a fairly accurate reflection of belief and practice among the ancient Hebrews. If few would credit Lightfoot's long lists of parallel passages in the New Testament and in the Talmud,4 and if others like Jacques Basnage saw no reason to appreciate a rabbi's explication of the Bible more than that of a Christian divine, there was rarely a scholar who would deny that he had profited to some extent from the linguistic knowledge of the rabbis. The Christian scholars might feel that the rabbis multiplied distinctions excessively and exaggerated their capaci ty to deduce new laws and rules from brief texts in Scripture, but they could not reject them outright. Except for a minority of Christian mystagogues who were seduced by Christian Knorr von Rosenroth's potpourri, the Kabbala Denudata (1677, 1684), the Protestant sects of the post-Renaissance world were commonsensical and preferred to steer clear of the cabbalists. And, when in the eighteenth century the French Abb? Augustin Calmet published his gargantuan twenty-two volume commentary on the Bible,5 he was careful to call it literal, to distinguish it from allegorical interpretations, which had gone out of fashion. Seventeenth and early eighteenth century Christian commentators frequent ly raised questions that involved matters of fact?the scientific and business spirit introducing mundane concerns into the realm of the sacred. Chorogra phy?really, sacred geography?was ordered, biblical chronology set aright, and sacred chronology inserted into a world chronology of ancient peoples in</page><page sequence="5">ISRAEL AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT 37 such a manner that no gentile nation might appear to have priority over Israel. But meticulous historicization in the long run led to desacralization. The trickle of printed Latin translations from the rabbis in the fifteenth century-incunabula like the Aphorismi of Maimonides and Rashi's commen tary?had by the eighteenth swelled to a steady flow. In the years 1698 to 1700, under the direction of Surrenhuis, there had appeared in Amsterdam three vast folios containing the whole of the Mishna in Hebrew, a parallel Latin translation, along with Latin versions of the commentary of Maimonides and of Rabbi Obadia of Bonitera. The splendidly printed work of Surrenhuis?which was in Voltaire's library, now in Leningrad6?is enlivened with engravings illustrating the performance of rituals by noble Hebrews in Oriental (i.e., Turkish) costume, or depicting scenes that make vivid and realistic the intricate problems of Sabbath violations or the dietary laws. The postures of the Hebrew gentlemen resemble those of baroque saints, and the general impression conveyed is that of a civilized people with a highly developed legal system. The translator's introduction stresses the importance of the Mishna for understand ing St. Paul, the disciple of Rabbi Gamaliel?a stock justification for Hebraic studies?and dwells on the significance of Paul's legal training as an element in his skillful propagation of the faith in Christ among the Romans. Talmudic and rabbinic Judaism served pre-Enlightenment Christianity in its scholarly attempt to understand itself. The philosophes-litt?rateurs of the Enlightenment first saw ancient Judaism through the heavy lenses of the Christian Hebraists. Whenever they found them too weighty in their original form, Pierre Bayle and Jean Leclerc and Basnage, who spanned the two centuries and wrote in French, acted as guides or transmitters. The major French philosophes of the eighteenth century, educated before the expulsion of the Jesuits, read Latin fluently and did not always have to rely on haute vulgarisation. English Deists of the early eighteenth century who had gone to Oxford had available the Latin commentaries and treatises of their seventeenth century countrymen, whose texts they translated with a certain license. Thus the Enlightenment thinkers disseminated notions of Judaism that rested on information culled from respectable seventeenth century Christian Hebraists at first or second hand. What they did with the data effected a revolution in Christian Europe's perception of Judaism. Many of the Christian Hebraist commentators had produced rather sympa thetic accounts of the ancient Hebrews, even when peppered with derogatory asides about Judaic rites. Their studies of the chronology and the chorography of biblical literature, of surviving manuscript texts from all centuries, were intended to eradicate discrepancies among the variant versions, so that the proof of prophecies might be accurately demonstrated. They found the coming of Jesus the Messiah foretold in hundreds of Old Testament verses. The Deists and philosophes of the next century took these writings, with their profuse citations from rabbinic sources, as evidence that the whole postbiblical Judaic inheritance was a confused mess, and they quickly exploded the relevance of the Messianic proof-texts. Christianity was being loosened from its Judaic moorings in one breath, while in the next, everything that was muddled, miraculous, or counterfeit in contemporary Christianity was tarred as a derivation from</page><page sequence="6">38 FRANK E. MANUEL Judaism. In approaching the philosophes' attack on the God of the Jews, it would be futile to look for consistency. Just as nineteenth century Jews were denounced as subversive revolutionary communists and pillars of international capitalism at the same time, in the eighteenth century Judaism was at once proclaimed the progenitor of an absurd and iniquitous Christianity and denied as having any true connection with so universal and spiritual a religion. /// The brazen reexamination of reality by men of the Enlightenment? including their radical revaluation of Judaism and Christianity?was based on a set of conceptions that they rarely doubted. It was assumed that the remote origins of a phenomenon, or the early history of a collective body such as the Hebrews, told what was most important about the thing itself. They thought it was possible to arrive at these origins by a procedure they often called unveiling. There was a Platonism unveiled, a Christianity unveiled, an antiquity unveiled, the human heart unveiled, nature unveiled. And to unveil Judaism was an undertaking of the same character. All collectives, like persons, had a quintessential core, an esprit that was their epitome. The idea is traceable to theories of humors and characteristics and psychologies that implied the existence of a dominant passion in individuals and in nations. Montesquieu's Spirit of the Laws and Herder's doctrine of the Volksgeist are examples of this conviction. The esprit of a nation or a religion was thought to be readily discoverable, definable, and identifiable in simple terms. It was held to be pervasive throughout the organism and relatively impervious to the ravages of time. In harmony with this presupposition, books on the esprit of various nations multiplied. In the twentieth century, the working out of the esprit of a religion or culture might become rather sophisticated in the hands of an anthropologist or a sociologist, but the fundamental conception has not changed much since the Enlightenment. The French literary men of the eighteenth century, unlike the polymath philologists of the seventeenth, generally rendered pejorative judgments of ancient Judaism in terms that went far beyond a formal indictment of its principal theological beliefs. In the writings of one of the patres majores of the Enlightenment, Voltaire, aversion to Judaism assumed the proportions of an obsession, especially in the last fifteen years of his life. With the critical edition of the one hundred volumes of Voltaire's letters, it is possible to follow the constancy of his Judeophobia, from a shadowy period of his life in the 1720s? when he was flirting with Cardinal Dubois, with espionage, with court Jews in Germany deeply involved in the munitions business and thus having access to state secrets?through his last years, when this indefatigable defender of the rights of Protestants and freethinkers against the Catholic Church would never use the word "Jew" without prefixing it with the adjective "execrable." In a letter written toward the close of his life he burst out that a Jew was a man who should have engraved upon his forehead the words "fit to be hanged."7 Personal psychological explanations for Voltaire's fixation have been at tempted since the eighteenth century, when it was first observed and his vituperative attacks on historical Judaism answered by a learned French abb?</page><page sequence="7">ISRAEL AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT 39 posing as a spokesman for Polish, Portuguese, and German Jews.8 The "cause" of his hatred has been found in his money quarrels and lawsuits with court Jews, bankers, and speculators, some of whom had worsted him in business dealings. Jewish historiographers have toyed with the question at least since Heinrich Hirsch Graetz, and many have related it to his crusade against all positive religion. By some diabolical pr?figuration of future events, one of Voltaire's nicknames in his select circle of friends was "Goebbels."9 One might half-seriously venture the idea that Voltaire found in Jews and ancient Judaism a fetish into which he could pour those aspects of his being that he loathed in himself. Fran?ois-Marie Arouet, a mere notary's son on the make, who had changed his name and became a rather sycophantic court Christian, hated the fawning court Jews who had also changed their names. One cannot read Voltaire's descriptions of massacres and buttocks-beatings in Candide?and his obvious enjoyment in describing Phineas the L?vite entering the tent of the Jew lying with a Midianite woman, and piercing her belly and his private parts with one thrust of the spear?without being aware of the cruelty in the man, which expressed itself in his tirades against the cruelty of the Jews. If personal psychological and socioeconomic motives are underplayed, left as a sort of grim obbligato, and the traditional Joshua-like bifurcation of Christians into Judeophobes and Judeophiles is avoided, there remains the broad question of the ways in which, on the overt level, the Enlightenment responded to ancient Judaism. Granted that the perception of ancient Judaism cannot be divorced from the realities of eighteenth century Jewish life, the portraits of the God of the Jews that were drawn during this period survived the Enlightenment and became dynamic historic forces in their own right. This was the first encounter of secular European intellectuals (emancipated or quasi emancipated from traditional Christian angels and devils) with ancient Judaism, and new cultural stereotypes were fashioned that have endured for centuries. IV To attack with violence the barbaric customs and punishments of the ancient Hebrews as they were profusely recorded in the Bible, to lay bare the treacheries and butcheries of the kings of Judaea and Samaria, to expose the falsehood of pretensions to miraculous performances in violation of the laws of nature, was a primary mission of the philosophes. To neglect a commonsensical evaluation of the sacred writings of the Jews would have violated the very motto of the Enlightenment, Kant's Sapere aude. The Enlightenment witnessed the falling apart of that uneasy Renaissance syncretism between the inherited traditions of Christianity and pagan Graeco Roman philosophical conceptions. In some quarters it also meant the disengage ment from each other of the Jewish and the Christian inheritances, which had once been linked with the bonds of Scripture and inveterate mutual loathing. As long as the Jews were condemned to continue their miserable lives as an eternal witness to the horror of deicide, they were a part of the world order with a role to play. Their existence had at least a satanic meaning. If the prophetic proof texts of the Old Testament were miraculous demonstrations or pr?figurations of the truth of Christianity, the Jews had deeper meaning, even if they refused to</page><page sequence="8">40 FRANK E. MANUEL accept the plain evidence of their own Messianic writings. But what if philosophes or Deists showed that the essential moral truths of Christianity were as old as creation? What need was there then for Hebrews, ancient or modern? The later English Deists hoped to transform the existing orthodox ecclesiastical establishments into a Christianity even more watery than Herbert of Cherbury's original five tenets of religion. In this so-to-speak third dispensa tion, there was neither room nor need for Judaism as a prolegomenon to Christianity. If one believed that Christianity was as old as the Creation?to adopt the title of a well-known pamphlet by the Deist Matthew Tindal? Judaism had not fulfilled any special theological purpose in the past and was of no worth in the present. Judaism was, in effect, an outlandish example of the heavy incrustation of man-made ceremonials and priestly impositions on a pure and simple set of Deist principles. Since miracles were exposed as frauds, and prophecies shown to be superstitions or errors, what was the point of studying the texts of the Jewish prophets to prove the coming of Christ? The truths of Deism were engraved in the heart and mind of every man, and the rout of ceremonials and dogmas about which men disputed was so much arrant nonsense. Judaism had accumulated more ritualistic prohibitions than other religions, and was the more ridiculous for it. One branch of the Enlightenment made Judaism useless: it was not necessary for a purified Christianity in Europe. The Jews lost their place in a Christian divine order of things, and they soon stood as naked aliens in a secular society. To the extent that Deism triumphed, it left Jews isolated, irrelevant, a sport in the history of Christianity. They became a mere remnant of ancient barbaric tribes, living on in the midst of civilized Europeans, preserving bizarre fanatical customs. Lessing is regarded as a Judeophile in popular Jewish historiography, and his relations with Moses Mendelssohn are a touching record of friendship; but if one reads carefully the hundred theses of Lessing's Education of Mankind,10 Judaism is stage one, Christianity stage two, and the new Enlightenment supersedes them both in a stadial succession. Judaism has lost its reason for further existence. When Voltaire played the Deist, his weapons were cruder. His underlying purpose?to attack Judaism and Christianity by conflating them?was plainly expressed in a letter of 1765 addressed to the Count and Countess d'Argental. He was writing a commentary on his own Philosophie de l'histoire, which had appeared pseudonymously as the work of the Abb? Bazin: "This book modestly shows that the Jews were one of the latest peoples to appear, that they took from other nations all their myths and all their customs. This dagger once dug in can kill the monster of superstition in the chambers of men of good will without the fools even knowing it."11 On another occasion he had written: "It is good to know the Jews as they are and to see from what fathers the Christians are descended."12 Out of unheroic caution, which characterized many, though not all, the philosophes, the early history of the Church, the lives of Christ and the apostles, were considered off limits. Most of the philosophes were determined to illuminate mankind without being martyred by it, to adapt Beccaria's formula. As a result, the particular God of the Jews and his chosen people were</page><page sequence="9">ISRAEL AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT 41 often surrogates that the philosophes fashioned to their own purposes and then lashed. Abb? Calmet's volumes of commentary provided the raw materials for Voltaire's biblical exegesis. Received as a prominent Royal Historiographer in Calmet's monastery, Voltaire stayed for almost a month in his workshop, and has left an amusing description of the monks scurrying up and down ladders to search out texts that ultimately fed Voltaire's bonfires of both traditional Christianity and Judaism. Beelzebub took the pious facts assembled by the monks and twisted them to fiendish purpose. But he also went to original sources. Even a cursory examination of the collection of Church Fathers in his library, kept intact from Catherine the Great through Brezhnev, bears witness to the assiduousness with which Voltaire consulted the sacred writings of early Christianity. In the dense forests of patristic literature, he carefully set up his own markers, little dabs of thin paper pasted on passages that might some day be useful in the anticlerical crusade. He set out to prove that the Jews had a material and anthropomorphic image of God: He spoke, the Jews maintained, ergo He had an actual voice. Judaism was carnal. By adhering to the literal, factual meaning of the Bible, Voltaire rendered it inconsistent and contradic tory, even repulsive. Reading in the Book of Joshua that the victorious war leader circumcised all Jews who had been born during the decades in the wilderness and had been wandering about uncircumcised, Voltaire conjured up the spectacle of a veritable mountain of foreskins on Gilgal. What the Jews wrote was fiction and not to be believed. Then he turned about abruptly and uncritically accepted biblical statistics when they concerned the Hebrews on a slaughtering rampage of enemies and sinners, to illustrate the cruelty of the God of the Jews. To Isaac de Pinto of Amsterdam, who, in a respectful letter, had protested some of his remarks on the Jews, he wrote: "Remain a Jew since you are one, but don't massacre 42,000 men because they could not pronounce shibboleth right nor 24,000 because they slept with Midianites; be a philosophe."13 When literate freethinkers of the Enlightenment had to weigh the witness of the Old Testament on the nature of Judaism against the witness of their favorite Roman historian, Tacitus, in his famous excursion on the character of the Jews in Book V of the Histories, there could be no question that the scales would tilt heavily on the side of Tacitus. For them, he was a true, objective pagan historian, not involved in the quarrels of Christians and Jews. He was a first century civilized Roman official, who had sifted the tales about the Jews, the origin of their religion, their exclusiveness, the contempt in which they were held by all nations, and the hatred they reciprocated. Tacitus' account of how Moses instituted new religious rites to bind to himself the tribes of Jews driven out by the Egyptians was consonant with prevalent eighteenth century theories about the origin of Oriental religions: the religion was an invention of a leader or a priest and had no intrinsic meaning. The idiosyncratic idea of having an empty temple with no representation of the invisible god was for Tacitus a patent demonstration of Jewish absurdity. The Jews were contentious among themselves, but extraordinarily stubborn in clinging to their fatuous beliefs when the Romans attacked them. As a tribe in the Roman Empire, they were</page><page sequence="10">42 FRANK E. MANUEL peculiar, obdurate, and troublesome, nothing more. Reading Tacitus, Enlight enment philosophes thought they recognized eighteenth century Jews. One had to be wary of them. If the most relevant part of the Old Testament for theorists of the political state in Christian society was the history of kingship, particularly its cloudy inception under Samuel, for the theologians who were apologists of Christian ity, as well as for those who would crush the infamous beast or at least cut its fangs, the heart of the matter was the nature of prophecy in ancient Judaea. It was here that the English Deists and French philosophes exerted their major effort in pulling Judaism and Christianity apart. Among orthodox believers, Christianity was proved both by the miracles that Christ performed, witnessed by apostles and the people, and by the evidence of what were considered the prophetic passages of the Old Testament, verses in which the coming of Christ the Messiah had been foretold. In orthodox Christian theology of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, there was a growing apologetic movement in one direction: miracles were substantial ly underrated, especially in the non-Catholic world, and the main witness, proof, or demonstration of the truth of the Christian religion, inexorably shifted to prophecy. Protestants regularly mocked ongoing Catholic miracles such as the periodic liquefaction of the blood of St. Januarius in Naples. Locke and Newton, for whom miracles were a subject of some consequence during their frequent religious colloquies, had settled on a compromise: miracles had ceased after the first centuries of Christianity, because thereafter further demonstra tions of divine will in the natural order would have been excessive, supereroga tory, a violation of the scientific law of parsimony. Rationalism, skepticism about the accuracy of the senses, made reports of miracles that had occurred thousands of years ago weak reeds to lean on, since men of sound mind doubted even contemporary ones. The written testimony of Old Testament prophets became the preferred battleground of both believers and unbelievers. In his customary manner, Baron d'Holbach once "abridged" a work by Rabbi Isaac Balthazar Orobio de Castro and entitled it Israel veng?;14 in this polemic, Christian belief, which had found support in an interpretation of Isaiah 53 as foretelling the coming of Christ, was contradicted by a traditional Jewish reading of the text. Rabbinic Judaism was called to witness by Holbachian atheists to destroy prophecy as a persuasive demonstration of the truth of Christianity. As for the spirit of Judaism, the Holbachians took care of that in another context. The theological controversies over prophecy were a melee in which an observer from on high would often have had difficulty knowing on whose side the contenders were fighting. Did the proof-texts of Isaiah and Haggai and Malachi refer to Christ or to some more immediate political events in the history of Judaea? Or were they prophecies about a future Messiah who was yet to come? Ingenious commenta tors like Jean Le Clerc, the remonstrant Genevan popularizer who ended up in Holland editing universal libraries for the learned, held that Old Testament prophecy might be at once a prediction of some immediate event, like the Jewish release from the Babylonian captivity, and a foretelling of a more distant Messiah. Ultimately, Deist Christianity dispensed entirely with the philological refinements of rabbinic exegesis. Bereft of its primary function of prophesying</page><page sequence="11">ISRAEL AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT 43 the coming of Christ, the Old Testament lost much of its significance for Enlightenment Christianity. What was an Old Testament prophet? Once Spinoza had answered the question in the Tractatus Theologico-politicus (1670), in what appeared to many to be naturalistic terms, the character of the prophet became a key to the judgment of Judaism. Christians like the Anglican professor John Spencer, who had codified the writings of Maimonides in a Latin work, De Legibus Hebraeorum,15 adopted Maimonides' portrait of the prophet as a man learned, rational, of impeccable morals, probably rich, who after having shown himself worthy of divine inspiration, established a special relationship with God. Enlightened Anglicans with deistic leanings welcomed this portrayal of the prophet as a philosophical teacher, so totally unlike the tinker prophets and ranters who had spoken with tongues during the English Civil War, a horde of wild, mad enthusiasts, lechers, ignoramuses, living among the dregs of society. Maimonides, the respectable Moses of Judaism, was a welcome philosopher to rationalist Anglican clergymen. But the Maimonidean portrait of a prophet was soon besmirched. Voltaire and the members of Holbach's atheist conventicle, perversely called the synagogue, drew a very different profile of a prophet. They read the biblical texts literally, and spread the image of Amos, the ignorant enthusiast, of Ezekiel running naked in the streets of Jerusalem. These prophets were blubbering lunatics who performed outlandish acts, married prostitutes. While orthodox believers took comfort in the wisdom of the prophets who had foretold the coming of Christ and sometimes naively talked of the "sons of the prophets" as sorts of universities of ancient Judaea, those Deists who wanted neither Christ coming once or twice, nor a future Jewish Messiah, made the biblical prophets sound like the Protestant "prophets of London," those persecuted Huguenots from the C?vennes who were afflicted with glossolalia and held scandalous s?ances predicting doomsday. For the Enlightenment, Spinoza, whose works had been translated into the vernacular, had relativized prophecy and divine inspiration. Prophecy had acquired a taxonomy: there were different types of prophets. Some heard voices, some had dreams. The Moses who saw God was the greatest, to be sure. But prophets were legislators of a particular people, and their admonitions had no universal applicability. This rationalist and relativist attitude toward prophecy diverted the argu ment from God's nature and intent to the nation of the Jews. A Maimonidean theologian like Isaac Newton had gone to great lengths to show the absolute conformity of all prophetic utterances, Judaic and Christian. For him, the historic events of prophecy derived their unity from God himself, who could harbor no contradiction. Later in the century, ancient Judaic prophecies were still widely regarded as historic events, but for Voltaire and the Holbachians, they had become either the delusions of madmen or the planned deceptions of priestcraft. V Montesquieu taught that every nation had an esprit particular to itself that was the mainspring (ressort) of its whole being. For the Romans, it was a warrior</page><page sequence="12">44 FRANK E. MANUEL spirit; for the Phoenicians, it was commercial; for the ancient Hebrews, it was religious. This conception of the dominant passion in a nation was complement ed by another anthropomorphic analogy?that each nation experienced a stadial development that stamped a different esprit on its life in every particular period. Vico's three ages in the Scienza Nuova preceded Herder's Volksgeist, but despite marked distinctions in the definition and diagnosis of the stages, the idea itself is one of the most common and persistent notions of eighteenth century thought. Even skeptical philosophes like Diderot, Hume, and Voltaire, who were most reluctant to imprint a stadial pattern on the bewildering chaos of historical experience, distinguished at least two historical states among all nations, a condition of barbarism and a state of civilization. In passing judgment on the nation of the Hebrews and their God, the philosophes had to find a place for them somewhere in this implicit system. Was the ancient history of the Hebrew nation the account of a barbarous or a civilized people? The books of the Bible were opened to reveal harrowing delineations of the Jews and their priests and kings. For many philosophes, a barbaric Judaean kingship and a fanatical priesthood fitted together. Travel literature described customs and habits of strange peoples in all parts of the world, many of them atrocious and cruel; but the question of whether the peoples were civilized turned on whether they had a system of laws. In this respect, once the Israelites had settled on both sides of the Jordan and occupied half of the Eastern Mediterranean littoral, it was difficult for even the most rabid Judeophobes of the Enlightenment to deny them a measure of civility. Diderot, perhaps with one eye cocked on the royal censor, included a dithyramb on Moses the legislator in the Encyclop?die. But there were those like Voltaire who were intent on likening the Jews to the early Picts and Celts of Europe and the primitive Greeks: the parallel sacrifices of Iphigenia and of Jephthah's daughter became the stereotyped example. They drew from the Bible the portrait of a barbaric, not a civilized, kingdom. David was their exemplar monarch of ancient Judaism. In his Histoire du Vieux et du Nouveau Testament (1705), Basnage, the Huguenot exile and preacher at Rotterdam, who wrote what were probably the most popular eighteenth century source books of secular knowledge about Jews and Judaism, had dropped the more licentious episodes of King David's life or psychologized his misconduct, to the point where the story of his iniquities became a morality play about the dangers of giving free rein to the passions. Holbach and Voltaire took the same biblical narratives and presented them as a Tacitus or Suetonius might in writing about an emperor of Rome. Both the kings of the Jews and their God turned out to be grizzly characters if measured by the standards of Paris salon society or the club life of David Hume's London. The French anticlericals reveled in shattering the image of David. The orthodox apologists of David had celebrated the piety of his Psalms; in David, ou l'histoire de l'homme selon le coeur de Dieu (1768), the Holbach circle turned to the simple facts narrated in the books of Samuel and Kings. In the previous century, Rembrandt, in a famous painting, had drawn King David as a resplendent Oriental monarch, repentant, deep in thought, listening to the admonishments of an emaciated Nathan. For the Holbachians, David, the murderous lecher, who had Bathsheba's husband Uriah killed at the front, and David, the disloyal harpist, made more plausible portraits. They pictured</page><page sequence="13">ISRAEL AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT 45 David as the head of a gang of ruffians, and his God as a capricious creature who poured ointment about rather promiscuously. Pierre Bayle's article on David in the first edition of the Philosophical and Critical Dictionary had aroused such opposition, that he was forced in the second edition to suppress many of his acidulous comments; but they were later restored, and the philosophes had regular recourse to him. The brutal hacking up of King Agag by Samuel as graphically depicted in Voltaire's play David may tell something about the dynamics of Voltaire's personality; but whatever their motivation, Voltaire's Old Testament scenes had a convincing goriness that the most persuasive rabbinic apologies could not dispel. Not everything written in the Enlighten ment about the first dispensation was false or even malicious in the light of a plain, straightforward reading of the Bible. Comparison of ancient Hebrew rites with the religious practices of pagan neighboring nations revealed the polytheistic and idolatrous character of ceremonials described in the Bible, and diminished the reverence for Judaism as the first monotheistic religion. The philosophes quoted from the inflated volumes of Bishop Warburton's The Divine Legation of Moses Demonstrated (1742), which, in a crude fashion, propounded the thesis that the immortality of the soul was a conception introduced into Judaism only after the Babylonian captivity, and denied the very idea of a world to come among the ancient Hebrews. That the ancient Jews did not believe in the soul's immortality became a historico-religious dogma, and fed the timeworn notion that Judaism in its origins was carnal, dependent upon rewards in this world that were concrete, objective, and visible. It was but a step from there to the accusation that the Jews' absorption with accumulating money was derived from their religion and inextricably bound up with it?the worship of Mammon. While the carnal temper was often attributed to the absurd multiplication of rabbinic interpretations, an early tendency was discerned in the laws of Leviticus and Deuteronomy themselves. On a more elevated plane, David Hume jumped to the conclusion that unphilosophical monotheism, by which he meant both institutional Christianity and Judaism, was incapable of holding to its lofty, abstract tenets, and inevitably lapsed into the worship of objects and idols, and into the fear of Hell reified as a place full of pitchfork-wielding devils.16 VI In the clandestine publications of the Baron d'Holbach, one is confronted with frank, militant, blatant atheism. There was nothing in Christianity, Deist or positive, that he wished to preserve. As a consequence, in describing the relationship of Judaism and Christianity, he argued that Christianity was simply reformed Judaism?and not much reformed at that. Voltaire and d'Alembert shuddered at the prospect of atheism when they read Holbach's writings, and scribbled "dangerous work" on the flyleaves. Jefferson, who studied all three of them, vacillated, as his marginalia show.17 What Voltaire and d'Alembert feared were ten-sou popularizations of Holbach's ideas that might corrupt the populace and lead to anarchy. Holbach, secure in his belief that society was protected by the hangman, not by God, let loose all the stops. The Holbachians assimilated Judaism to other primitive religions, generated</page><page sequence="14">46 FRANK E. MANUEL and maintained by fear and terror. And fear, they had learned from the ancients, obfuscated truth and bred cruelty. The analysis of fear in primitive religion was pivotal in the attack on Judaism by Holbach and the engineer Nicolas-Antoine Boulanger, who frequented his salon. The fear of God in Judaism, the Gottesfurcht of sixteenth century Lutherans, the highest virtue in a man, became identified with cruelty in eighteenth century associationist psychology. And if the diverse branches of the Enlightenment were united in denouncing any single evil, it was cruelty. The Holbachians reached the climax of their diatribes against the God of the Jews in L'Esprit du Juda?sme ou examen raisonn? de la loi de Moyse, &amp; de son influence sur la Religion Chr?tienne (1770), a work often imputed to the Deist Anthony Collins. Actually, it is a composite in which one can recognize the rhetoric of Boulanger, Diderot, and Holbach. The twelfth chapter, "The Influence of Judaism on the Christian Religion," is an oratorical display in which the parallel between the God of Christianity and the God of Judaism is set forth with a passion rarely attained in anticlerical literature even by Voltaire and Nietzsche. The full force of the battering-ram is directed at the God of the Jews, of whom the Christian God is a mere replica. Christians, like Jews, worship a cruel and gory God; they proclaimed one who demands blood to appease his fury. But is not cruelty a sign of weakness? Did God create his creatures in order to spill their blood? Nevertheless these abominable principles have been invoked to justify the atrocious persecutions that Christians have launched a thousand times against those whom they falsely imagined were the enemies of their God. Having made of this God a veritable cannibal, they have honored him by avenging his cause with the fumes of human blood. It is in accord with these atrocious ideas that they imagined this same God demanded of the patriarch Abraham the blood of his only son and then demanded that to redeem men, the blood of a God, the blood of His own Son, be shed on the Cross.18 The Holbachians argued that, in belief, in esprit, in ecclesiastical organiza tion, the Jews were the very model of Christianity. Where orthodox Christians had seen the sacrifice of Isaac as a type for the Crucifixion, the Holbachians saw it as a despicable Oriental precedent that was imitated: Blinded by their legislator the Jews never had any sound ideas of divinity. Moses devised an image for them with the characteristics of a jealous tyrant, restless and insidious, who was never restrained by the laws of justice and who owes nothing to men, who chooses and rejects according to his caprice, who punishes children for the crimes, or rather the misfortunes of their fathers. . . . What more was needed to make of the Hebrew people a troop of slaves, proud of the favor of their celestial Sultan, prepared to undertake anything without examination to satisfy his passions and unjust decrees. This ignorant, savage people, imbued with the idea that its God was amenable to gifts, believed that it was enough to please him to make him many offerings, to placate him with sacrifices, to enrich his ministers, to work in order to keep them in splendor, to fulfill scrupulously the rites that their cupidity dreamed up. These are the horrible features with which the legislator of the Hebrews painted the God that the Christians have since taken over.19 In this portrait, the God of love and mercy was completely stricken out.</page><page sequence="15">ISRAEL AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT 47 Explaining the burning of marranos in contemporary Spanish and Portu guese autos-da-f?, the Holbachians returned Christianity to its origins? Judaism. It was as if the Jews had willed their own eventual destruction. "In a word, all the ferocity of the Judaic priesthood seems to have passed into the heart of the Christian priesthood, which since it has established itself on earth has caused barbarities to be committed unknown to humans before."20 VII The last important Enlightenment interpretation of the spirit of Judaism was made not by the enemies of religion but by a group of Christian believers. It ended in emotionalizing and romanticizing the religion of Judaism as it was embodied in the Old Testament. This novel religious conception assumed two kindred forms in France and Germany: the romantic religiosity of the Vicar of Savoy's confession of faith in Rousseau's Emile, and the exaltation by Herder of the primitive Hebrew poetry of the Bible as the most sublime expression of the religious spirit.21 Together they generated a religion of feeling that was related to moral beauty, and ultimately deflected traditional Western religions from their doctrinal and historical pathways?in some instances, a departure so radical that the whole nature of religious experience underwent a profound change. The effect on the view of Judaism was strongest in the German world, where Jewish communities were more numerous than anywhere else in western Europe. In 1753 the Oxford professor of poetry Robert Lowth, later Bishop of London, whose Hebrew was in fact rather weak, had published his lectures De sacra Poesi Hebraeorum. The German Hebraist Johann David Michaelis corrected his errors and perfected his reading of much of the Bible as poetry. Their discovery of the sacred poetry of the Hebrews was harmonious with Herder's definition of the core of ancient Judaism as its poetic nature. The essential spirit of Judaism had been made manifest in the earliest documents of the human race, the Scriptures. Language revealed the secret soul of every religious people, and the poetry of the Bible was the Geist of the ancient Hebrews in their very beginnings, their creative moment. Among the Hebrews, early poetic language was the vehicle for the most sublime religious feeling. The rationalist theologies of all religions were secondary; it was the poetic language of religion in music and in verse that was closest to the divine. When Herder, while remaining a Lutheran, abandoned discussion of Jewish or Christian theology and identified the religion of Judaism with the beauties of the Hebrew language, he freed the spirit of Judaism from the contempt of the Voltaireans and the Holbachians. But at the same time he opened the way to aestheticizing religious experience among all peoples, which subtly robbed the Judaic dispensation of its uniqueness. One aspect of Moses Mendelssohn's defense of Judaism was deeply colored by a perception that he shared with his friends Michaelis and Herder. In aestheticizing the religion of the Old Testament, Christians and Jews could have a common experience. They could read Psalms and prophetic works, Mendelssohn wrote Michaelis, as poetry, without theological glosses and</page><page sequence="16">48 FRANK E. MANUEL debates over whether or not they foretold the coming of a Messiah. They could ignore the exegetical apparatus that discovered pr?figurations of Jesus in what were poetic effusions of the Judaic religious soul.22 In his book Jerusalem,21 Mendelssohn likened religions to different languages in which the same universal humanity found a voice. Though he continued to observe Jewish rituals meticulously, he appeared no longer to hold to their absolute religious importance, regarding them as man-made, like commentaries on texts or theological deductions. It was then that the Swiss pastor Johann Kaspar Lavater summoned him to become a Christian?an invitation that Mendelssohn rejected with angry vehemence. Since the moral truths of Judaism were the same as those of natural religion without revelation, since each religion was a divinely inspired language, why should he forsake the religion into which he had been born? Proselytization was presumptuous, and conversion idiotic. The consequences of this romantic, emotional transformation of Judaism into a religion of moral beauty were far graver than Mendelssohn imagined. The reduction of Judaism to an aesthetic-moral experience inflicted a more serious wound on traditional Judaism in the Germanic world than the sneering of a Voltaire intent upon its uglification. If Judaism and Christianity were equally appealing to the romantic imagination, why hesitate at the baptismal font? The convert Dorothea Schlegel, n?e Mendelssohn, was the visible outgrowth of this movement. The raison d'?tre for Judaism was being shattered by the celebration of the ancient God of the Jews as an inspirer of sweet and lofty poesy. Despite his Judeophobia, Voltaire, too, was an admirer of the Old Testa ment as literature. He thought its dramatic incidents more gripping and vivid than those of the Homeric epics. Of course, like Shakespeare, the Bible violated the canons of good taste, and one spurned its wild coarseness in an enlightened age. The Bible was an incarnation of the barbaric spirit and vigor of antiquity, not a model for civilized Europeans. Thus, after the rupture of the traditional union of Christianity and Judaism, in which Judaism had played the stock role of a prolegomenon to the dominant European religious culture, there were at least three principal positions on Israel assumed in the Enlightenment. Some thinkers maintained that the essence of a spiritualized Christianity was universal from the beginning of time, and they eliminated Judaism as a forebear. Others maximized the importance of Judaism, but saw it as the archetypal fanatical religion of which Christianity was a descendant, and piled up the evidence that it was unfit for any but barbarian peoples; the time had come for both Judaism and Christianity to be superseded by reason alone. Still others emotionalized or aestheticized religion, allowing for the appreciation on an equal plane of all religious languages, and the traditional belief in the Covenant between God and His chosen people evaporated. VIII Edward Gibbon once said of the religions of the Roman Empire that the mass of the people considered all the religions of the empire as equally true, and that the magistrates believed them all to be equally useful. This may apply well enough to much of present-day American society. Gibbon also remarked that philosophers thought all religions equally false.24</page><page sequence="17">ISRAEL AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT 49 In the two hundred years since the triumph of the Enlightenment, the religious temper of Western society has changed more radically than in any period since the birth of Christianity. Present-day Christian views of Judaism would be incomprehensible to the heads of the established eighteenth century churches and to the theologians whose doctrinal positions have been outlined early in this essay. The pattern of distribution of Jews in the world has been dramatically altered. The Jewish inhabitants of Central and Eastern Europe have been wiped out, France has more than ten times as many Jews as it did in the eighteenth century, and North American Jews have become preponderant in the Diaspora. Christian belief has ceased to rest primarily upon miracles or proof-texts of Old Testament prophecy. Conversion of the Jews is not a major preoccupation of any Christian denomination. The acerbity of speech of many Deists and philosophes has generally been left behind. Christian giants of scholarship no longer devote themselves to Hebraism. Nevertheless, the flowering of biblical studies worldwide among Christians and Jews (stimulated in part by the discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls) has bestowed a new dignity on ancient Judaism as a religion. Israeli bibliolatry has not brought about the neglect of the rabbinic learning of postexilic Judaism, and the multifarious forms of historical Judaism are alive in Israel. Hebraic studies flourish in Jewish theological centers in America and in Jewish secular universities. Judaism as a historical religion is now rarely treated pejoratively. In Vatican II, the Catholic Church denied the collective responsibility of Jews in all ages for the Crucifixion. Though many American Fathers of the Council had favored an explicit rejection of the "infamous blasphemy" of deicide, the final text fell short of this demand.25 Nevertheless, a call was issued in the 1965 declaration Nostra aetate for the opening of a fraternal dialogue between Christians and Jews, whose common spiritual patrimony "is so great."26 Doctrinal reconstructions are evident in deeds as well as in words? Catholic priests have made forthright avowals of mea culpa. The gospel according to John cannot be amended, and teachings in some seminaries may perpetuate old ways of thinking; Jewish synagogues and cemeteries are the target of aberrant manifestations of Judeophobia as they have been through the ages. But the degree to which residual hatred of Jews draws sustenance from Christian theology has diminished. Contemporary Judeophobia has roots in racial and economic doctrines that are far removed both from the traditional arguments of the Church Fathers and from the caricatures of radical atheists of the Enlightenment. Antisemitism, the nineteenth century label for the latent malady of Christendom, has not been extirpated, and many Jews, believers and disbelievers alike, live in fear of its recurrence. Protestants, loosely organized in a world council of churches, present a broad spectrum of attitudes toward Judaism, a few of which can be traced back to their eighteenth century origins. There are Jews who feel that some Protestant sects have lagged behind the Catholic Church in their inner reformation with respect to Judaism, that the venom of Luther's Judeophobia has only been diluted. Understandably, Protestant fundamentalists and believ ers in biblical inerrancy are more involved with the Old Testament texts than are other sects, often with paradoxical consequences. The return of the Jews to the Holy Land enjoys the active support of many biblical literalists and</page><page sequence="18">50 FRANK E. MANUEL millenarians, for whom the in-gathering of Israel presages a fulfillment of prophecy. But at the same time they have questioned whether a Jew who does not recognize Christ can be saved. On occasion, the whole ecumenical position recently adopted in Christian churches has been muddled by the parochial contention that God does not listen to the prayers of a Jew. On the commonsensical level, the forms and substance of Christian and Jewish religious life in America resemble each other. All Western Christian denominations have undergone the influence of eighteenth century emotional revivalism. Romantic effusiveness in religion is on the rise, and in this sense, Western Christianity and Judaism are associated in a common religio aesthetic experience. The universal romantic religiosity of Rousseau?with more than a touch of nature worship?the pietism of Herder, and the expressive evangelical spirit of John Wesley have been victorious over the philosophical rationalism of Leibniz's conception of an ecumenical religion for all mankind. Jews who are neither Cabbalists nor Hassidim but belong to one of the three principal Jewish denominations in America?Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform?nevertheless draw the same kind of emotional sustenance from dalliance with the quasi-mystical Jewish sects. There are signs of increased religious observance among members of the three Jewish denominations, but the nature of their religious experience and their intensity of devotion are as varied as among their Christian neighbors. Memorable discourse on religious thought and feeling among Jews in twentieth century America is rare, as it is among their Christian compatriots. Ecumenicalism has been so pervasive, that a Catholic church stripped of images looks much like a Protestant meetinghouse, and a Jewish sermon focused on current events is hardly to be differentiated from its liberal Protestant counterpart. Centuries-old Judaic moral admonitions to pursue justice and righteousness make it easy for a Jew to assimilate the social gospel of liberal Christianity; both religions at times seem to be turning into a kind of eighteenth century Deism shorn of anticlerical polemics. The hyphenated adjective "Judeo-Christian," which was not in common usage in the Christian world before the twentieth century, has come to symbolize shared moral values. This idea would have been preposterous to apologists who wove theological systems around the contrast between Jewish carnality and Christian spirituality. In North America, having some religion is still a social, if not a political, requirement for election to office, but fewer Americans care which religion is professed. Jews need not subject themselves to the humiliation of a conversion to Christ without conviction, as they did in nineteenth century Germany. Religious pluralism in American society is taken for granted even more than ethnic diversity. It was a stereotype of eighteenth century thought that religious intolerance was proportionate to zealotry and fanaticism, and that, conversely, nations like the Roman, which was rather indifferent in matters of religion, tended to be tolerant of the religious practices of others. If universal religious toleration was one of the wished-for human conditions in the Enlightenment, it has been largely realized in late twentieth century America. Since World War II there has been one development in Judaism that is momentous. Messianism and the longing for the return to Israel have been</page><page sequence="19">ISRAEL AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT 51 potent forces in traditional Judaism, though the eighteenth century was probably a low point in the history of this sentiment. In our time, the existence of Israel as a state has been invested with religious meaning for a great number of Jews. Judaism, fervid or lukewarm, has been politicized. Reform Judaism of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, derived from Moses Mendelssohn, was long inimical to the commingling of religion and politics, and insisted on their complete separation, lest Jews be considered less patriotic than their fellow nationals in the lands where they lived. Today Reform Jews, once militantly hostile to Woodrow Wilson's approval of the Balfour Declaration, have joined Conservative Jews, Orthodox Jews, and other sects (except for tiny Jewish fundamentalist minorities that deny recognition to the state of Israel as a usurper of the Messiah's prerogatives) in moving the preservation of Israel as a political entity to a central position in their religious life. The prayer book of Orthodox Jews now includes a long text, promulgated by the chief rabbis of Israel, beginning: "Our Father who art in heaven, Protector and Redeemer of Israel, bless thou the State of Israel which marks the beginning of the flowering of our redemption." The careful phrasing still allows for the persistence of the traditional expectation of the coming of the Messiah at a future time. Conserva tive Jews have a briefer version that starts in the same way. And even Reform Jews, who in the nineteenth century eliminated from their devotions all references to Jerusalem and the resurrection of the dead, now pray for "the land of Israel and its people." This prayer for Israel is the only liturgical innovation on which the three Jewish religious divisions in America are in accord. It may be difficult for Christians to comprehend the internal religious squabbles among Jews, to realize that there is no pope in Judaism, no world body that can speak for religious or secular Jews, no canonical law universally recognized by Jews. There is in fact great freedom in North America for any Jew to speak his mind on the orientation of the numerous religious synods and Jewish organizations of laymen that vie for his allegiance, or on the state of Israel and any of its wise, courageous, or foolhardy decisions. The persecutions of this century, however, have made Jews hesitant to alienate themselves from the general will of their community, ill-defined as it may be. Divergent interests of rich or poor, old settlers or new immigrants, belief in a false Messiah like Sabbatai Zevi or disbelief, Zionism or anti-Zionism, in their day have torn Jewish communities apart, and there is fear of divisiveness. The survival of Israel is now at the heart of spiritual existence among American Jews. Their religious institutions have been thrust into the maelstrom of American and Israeli party politics. But the needs of a beleaguered state like Israel may not always dovetail neatly with the requirements of an ancient religion like Judaism. And an Enlightenment prophet might hold that a second coming of the Holocaust is not reserved for Jews alone.
