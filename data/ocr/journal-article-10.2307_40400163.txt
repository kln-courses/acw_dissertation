<plain_text><page sequence="1">LEONARDO DA VINCI AND THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF SCIENCE* LEOPOLD INFELD CONSIDER a special problem concerning the work of Leonardo da Vinci is like looking at a great mountain through a microscope. One thus sees only a very small part of the immense region covered by Leonardo's astounding activities. The total of such specific views can not give an insight into his genius. Yet this division of his work into fragments is the only workable method for us to follow today. I do not believe that there is a single living man who could judge completely, from the modern point of view, all that Leonardo has done. I am therefore well aware that this essay on Leonardo and the fundamental laws of nature is no more than a rapid survey of one phase of his immense and far-reaching activities. Leonardo's interest in science and its methods began early. To fill out the great gaps in his early education he was accustomed to write down exceptionally difficult words and formulate definitions for them. In his notebook we read: "Syllogism: ambiguous language (parlare dubbioso)." "Sophism: involved language, falsely issued for truth." "Science: knowledge of things that may come." This glossary of Leonardo's contains thousands of words; but those just cited are connected with his scientific view of the world. In those definitions we find his appreciation for the science which teaches us to predict phenomena, and his contempt for that de- â€¢ Speech to have been delivered in Pisa, Italy, on June 20, 1952, at the international conference to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the birth of Leonardo da Vinci. Translated from the Polish by Margaret Schlauch. 26</page><page sequence="2">LEONARDO DA VINCI AND THE LAWS OF SCIENCE 27 tached speculation which was so beloved by the ancients, and prac- ticed in a caricatured manner during the Middle Ages. Today, when Leonardo's definition of science must appear too narrow to us, it is difficult to realize how new and revolutionary it was at the time when he wrote down those words. Antiquity did not bequeath to us a knowledge of the laws of nature. The great Archimedes- one of the greatest geniuses ever pro- duced by humanity- formulated the laws of statics in a series of im- portant mathematical theorems. The Middle Ages gave us nebu- lous speculations, and the solitary voice of Roger Bacon proclaim- ing the lofty importance of the experimental sciences. Science in the sense of predicting the phenomena of nature was all but unknown to the Greeks and it was not known to the men of the Renaissance who brought to light the treasures of ancient thought. Statics was known in physics, chiefly in the work of Archimedes. The problem of discovering the future state of a system, on the basis of a knowledge of its present state and the laws governing its changes, remained foreign to Greek physics. This could not have been otherwise, for at that time the laws of dynamics were unknown, which form the foundation for such predictions. These laws will permit us to predict the position and velocity of particles only if their initial positions and speeds are known, as well as the forces acting upon them. Dynamics, as a science predicting the future of systems, begins with Galileo and Newton. But the tasks of that sci- ence, and the first approximations to the basic laws governing the motions of bodies, are to be found developed to an amazing degree in the notebooks of Leonardo. Today, when we hear talk about the law of inertia, almost from our very childhood, it is hard for us to understand that there was an epoch in the development of human thought when even a misty presentiment of that law was a very great discovery. For this reason, in order to appreciate the importance and revolutionary nature of Leonardo's views concerning the tasks of science and concerning its fundamental laws, we have to remember that all this took place in a period when the world was arousing itself from darkness; in a period when there was no ancient heritage of knowledge in the field of the dynamic laws connecting past and future phenomena. In a work entitled Mechanics which has been attributed to Aristotle for 2,000 years, we find this statement: "A body in motion will come</page><page sequence="3">28 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY to rest if the force pushing it forward ceases to operate." The entire development of physics, and especially the develop- ment of dynamics, takes its beginning with the surmounting of that error. It was an error which weighed upon our understanding of the phenomena of nature: the error, namely, that the velocity and not the acceleration of a body depends upon the force acting on it, that a wagon pulled by a team of four horses moves twice as fast as one pulled by two horses. In Leonardo we find the first attempt to surmount this false understanding of the problem of motion, an attempt which became more and more precise in the times of Galileo and Newton. The history of contemporary science begins with the establishment of the fact that it is not velocity but acceleration that is connected with force. The explanation of this problem consti- tuted a fundamental advance in the description and the understand- ing of reality. The science of nature, especially dynamics, did not exist in the period in which Leonardo lived. The whole world full of uncom- prehended things -but at the same time, according to Leonardo's conviction, accessible to rational thought- charmed and fascinated him throughout his entire life. He, who was dependent on the favors of the mighty, felt contempt for them- but admiration for the beauty of nature. He gave expression to his contempt in strong and colorful words. We read in his notebooks: I know well that because I have not had a literary education there are some who will think in their arrogance that they are entitled to set me down as uncultured- the fools! They will say that because I am uncultured I am not able adequately to express myself on the subject of which I wish to treat. . . . But they do not see that my knowledge is gained rather from experience than from the words of others: from ex- perience, which has been the master of all those who have written well. . . . They go about, puffed up and pompous, in fine raiment and bejewelled, not from the fruits of their own labors but from those of others; my own labors they refuse to recognize. They despise me, the inventor, but how much more are they to blame for being not inventors, but trumpeters and reciters of the works of others. They are little in- debted to nature, for it is only by the chance that they wear clothes that they can be distinguished from herds of animals. But for nature- nature full of problems, of cruelty, of splendor</page><page sequence="4">LEONARDO DA VINCI AND THE LAWS OF SCIENCE 29 -he possessed boundless admiration. And this solitary man spent his entire life in the labor of portraying its fragments on canvas and in words, and in the toil of comprehending the laws governing it. He understood the power of experiment better and more profoundly than did Roger Bacon; besides that, however, he understood the extraordinary power of theory, which elucidates experiment. Leonardo frequently reflected upon the relation of theory to ex- periment: that is to say, upon the fundamental methodology of sci- entific investigation. One may seriously doubt whether a sharp con- traposition of theory to experiment is correct. Today too one finds extremely contradictory opinions on the subject among physicists. As an example I should like to indicate how very varied the views on this subject can be. We know that one of the most fundamental branches of contem- porary science is nuclear physics. In this field experimentation defi- nitely preceded theory, e know a great number of experimental facts which have had as a consequence the understanding and use of atomic energy. Humanity is living in the hope that this tre- mendous result of work carried out by scientists of the whole world will not be the cause of their extermination. However, despite the knowledge of a flood of experimental facts, we do not have a satis- factory theory of the nucleus; we do not even have a satisfactory theory of the elementary particles. One often hears it said-espe- cially by experimental physicists- that we must get to know new facts, we must construct apparatus from which to obtain more and more energy; that only the best knowledge of such an increasing number of new experimental facts can lead us to the formulation of a satisfactory theory. Einstein, the greatest living theoretical physi- cist, has often said that in the field of nuclear physics we know too many facts and that a knowledge of them is rather a handicap than a help in the formulation of a satisfactory theory. Indeed, Maxwell's theory, for example- one of the most beautiful achieve- ments of human thought- can be constructed on the basis of two or three fundamental experimental facts, while a great number of other experimental facts are consequences of that theory. It is the same with the theory of quanta, applied to the interior of the atom. It grew out of an understanding of the regularity of the spectrum lines of hydrogen, and later embraced an increasing number of experimental facts. When we know too many experi-</page><page sequence="5">30 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY mental facts it is difficult to recognize those which are particularly important for the formulation of theory. Actually, the development of physics in the course of the last years shows that Einstein was right. Experimental physicists may rightly be proud of the knowl- edge obtained by them of an increasing number of facts, while the theoretical physicists are more and more dissatisfied with the grow- ing discrepancy between the scope of experiment and that of theory. These considerations seem essential to me because we can see in Leonardo a dramatic attempt to appraise properly the mutual relation of theory to experiment. His notes do not reveal a one- sided point of view; in some the importance of the role of theory is emphasized, and in others it is rather that of experiment which re- ceives stress. In one of his notes, for instance, Leonardo compares theory to a general and experiment to the soldiers. In others also he assigns a superior position to theory, saying that those who are in love with practice without theory are like a pilot who goes aboard ship without rudder or compass. How can he know in such a case, asks Leonardo, whither he is sailing? Or take this comment: "First you must describe your theory, then your practice." These are state- ments which every theoretical physicist reads with a kind of rapture, with admiration and with incredulity that such opinions could be formulated at a time when the discipline of investigating the regu- larity of natural phenomena had not yet been born. However, we sometimes find different views expressed by Leon- ardo. For example: "Remember, in arguing about water, to cite the experiment first and then explain its cause. "Experiment never disappoints; it is only our judgments that err, promising such a result as can not find a basis in our experiments. "Wisdom is the daughter of experiment." In these statements the superior role is given rather to experiment. Finally, we sometimes find a compromise position expressed: It seems to me that those sciences which are not born of experience, the mother of all certainty, and which do not end in known experience- that is to say, those sciences whose origin or process or end does not pass through any of the five senses- are vain and full of errors. If theory is so important a matter, and experiment also, then a</page><page sequence="6">LEONARDO DA VINCI AND THE LAWS OF SCIENCE 3 1 new question presents itself. Theory is a process of reasoning. What then is the instrument of that process? Here again we find in the notes of Leonardo a far-sighted reply: mathematics. His notes are full of praises for mathematics, even though he himself, strangely enough, was a poor mathematician. He understood its spirit, however, and its significance for theory. Or rather, he had a feeling for it and a pre- sentiment of its role, rather than an understanding of it. Leonardo was an amazing geometrician, but weak in algebra. (In one of his notes we read: "Let Master Luca demonstrate how square roots are extracted.") Today we would say that he was a man with a genius for geometry but not for analysis. This was only because analysis-the most important instrument of thought in the natural sciences- had not yet been born at that time. All the morÃ© are we amazed by his grasp of the fundamental philosophical difficulties connected with the relation of reality to geometry. He well understood, he beautifully and emphatically explained in his notes the differences between a physical point (such as, for instance, the point of a needle) and a geometrical point which is an idealization of reality. He was fascinated by the concepts of zero and of infinity, and on that theme we find many explanations offered which appear naive from the vantage point of today's knowl- edge. But above all we often find in his notes an explicit admiration for mathematics as the method of deductive thinking: "for no human inquiry can be called science unless it pursues its path through mathematical exposition and demonstration." And again: There can be no complete certainty in a situation where it is impos- sible to apply one of the mathematical sciences, or those connected with mathematics The man who discredits the supreme certainty of mathe- matics is feeding on confusion, and can never silence the contradictions of sophistical sciences, which lead to an eternal quackery. Let us give one more excerpt concerning mathematics from the notebooks of Leonardo. Its conclusion must evoke an ironical smile today from every modern mathematician and physicist who knows the works of Lobachevsky, Gauss and Einstein. However, those sciences are true ones whose experiments are filtered through the senses, bidding the tongues of wranglers to be silent. Those</page><page sequence="7">32 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY are true which do not nourish their students on dreams, but always pro- ceed from the first known and true principles, step by step and consist- ently to the conclusion, as can be seen in the fundamental mathematical sciences: that is, in the sciences concerned with number and measurement, called arithmetic and geometry, which yield the truest judgments about continuous and non-continuous quantity. . . . Here there is no controversy over whether twice three makes more or less than six, or whether the sum of the three angles of a triangle is greater or less than two right angles, but all controversy is destroyed by eternal silence and peace subsists between the followers of these sciences, a peace such as the mendacious mental sciences can never attain. Thus it was that Leonardo, the illegitimate son of a notary, for whose formal education little care was taken when he was a child, proclaimed to a world unwilling to hear his voice, the end of the Middle Ages and the birth of the science of nature, which "does not break its own laws"; the importance of the experimental method; the value of that theory whose instrument of reasoning is mathe- matics. II The historical development of science teaches us that mechanics forms the foundation of all the natural sciences. The mechanist view of the world developed down through the first half of the 19th century, when there appeared as its rival the field concept. What was the contribution of Leonardo to the development of this mech- anist concept which dominated in science to the middle of the 19th century? Traditionally, mechanics is divided into statics and dynamics. As we have already remarked, statics was the subject of Archimedes' works; but the results obtained by Leonardo in this field go much further than his. He knew, for instance, that machines do not really save work. What we gain in force, we lose proportionally in dis- tance. He was the first to introduce the concept of the moment of force into statics. What is known to every student in secondary schools today was a great discovery at the end of the 15 th century. In the history of the development of physics, Leonardo does not occupy the place that he deserves. History passes judgment on the achievements of men and women of science by their influence on</page><page sequence="8">LEONARDO DA VINCI AND THE LAWS OF SCIENCE 3 3 the later development of their sciences; by deciding whether this scholar founded a school or whether other scholars carried his thoughts further; whether, and to what extent, his works contributed to the development of technology. Leonardo was not only a great physicist who reflected upon theory and conducted experiments, but also a man whose imagination (as we all know) dreamed, through drawings and words and thoughts, about the adaptation of the dis- covered laws of nature to technology. This solitary man dreamed about the mastery of nature by man; about the construction of canals, the fructification of the earth, and the reversal of rivers' streams; about underwater boats and wings for men. It was not until the 18th century, almost 300 years after the death of Leonardo and 100 years after the publication of the immortal Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica of Newton, that some of Leonardo's works on physics appeared in print, published by Venturi (1797). The in- fluence of Leonardo on the essential development of physics was nil. For this reason it is good that after a lapse of 500 years his work should be reviewed: those solitary writings so long unknown, and not recognized in the course of his lifetime. If Leonardo had not lived, physics would be exactly what it is today. But if Leonardo had been created against the background of his age purely by the imagination of a writer, we should never have believed that a ca- price of nature could have incarnated a human being so far sur- passing his environment. His writings in the field of mechanics, which Leonardo called "the paradise of the mathematical sciences," are immeasurably im- portant, especially those which deal with the laws of statics and machines. But here, when we narrow our problem to the evaluation of his contribution to the knowledge of the fundamental laws of nature, we must concern ourselves with the works which do not lie in the field of statics, but in the field of dynamics- a neglected part of physics, or rather, one which did not exist at the time when Leonardo lived. And here again, the intuition of a genius told Leonardo that an understanding of the problem of motion, of dynamics, is a most im- portant thing; that "motion is the cause of life," and that "every activity must fulfill itself in motion." The principles of dynamics operate with such concepts as velocity, acceleration, mass, force. Even today physicists have different, opin-</page><page sequence="9">34 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY ions as to the proper definition of some of these concepts. So far as velocity and acceleration are concerned, general agreement pre- vails. These concepts are of a kinetic nature. Kinematics, or the science of describing motion, but not of predicting it, is in a way an introduction to dynamics. Today the definition of kinematic concepts does not cause any difficulty for a student who has mastered the elements of differential calculus. But the differential calculus, or analysis, took its origin first in the works of Leibnitz and New- ton. An understanding of the concept of acceleration is difficult without this mathematical tool. From what I know of the notebooks of Leonardo I have the impression that the concept of acceleration was insufficiently clear to him. The concepts of mass and force, which involves acceleration, appear in dynamics. And even today we still have difficulty in comprehending them, although in the history of the development of physics these difficulties appear on higher and higher levels. ; In place of the concept of mass we find in Leonardo the concept of the "heaviness" or "weight" of a body; but in this case the con- fusion would not have kept Leonardo from a correct formulation of the principles of dynamics. The cause of the confusion is rather the lack of precision in the formulation of the concepts of accelera- tion and force. Everyone knows that dynamics is based on the fundamental laws of Newton. The first is the law of inertia; the second, the law of motion; the third, the law of action and reaction. Which of these three laws were known to Leonardo? What kind of conclusions did he draw from his formulation- correct or incorrect? Let us begin with the principle of inertia. From the notes of Leonardo we conclude that he came very close to an understanding of this principle: that at times he gave it an all but correct for- mulation. The idea of a body's remaining in a certain state appears expressly stated by him. On the other hand, the idea that velocity is changed under the influence of force is not clearly formulated. The essential idea of the principle of inertia is a denial of what was affirmed by the ancients. It is the verification of the fact that not the velocity but the acceleration testifies to the force operating. We do not find so clear a formulation as this in Leonardo. But he comes close to grasping the physical content of that principle when he writes, "Every natural and continuous movement desires to main-</page><page sequence="10">LEONARDO DA VINCI AND THE LAWS OF SCIENCE 35 tain its course in the line from which it started; that is, I call each place at which it varies, its beginning." At another point, he states: "Every movement tends to maintain itself; or, rather, every body in motion continues to move so long as the influence of the force of its motor is maintained in it." We must remember that Newton lived about 200 years after Leonardo; that this formulation of the law of inertia, though not entirely accurate, in no way diminishes our admiration for the genius of Leonardo. The second law of Newton appears in a less favorable light, but an even more interesting one. This law is the most important one, incomparably more so than the one about inertia. Actually, the law of inertia is only a special case of Newton's second law. That prin- ciple, formulated mathematically, permits us to calculate the move- ments of the planets around the sun, the movements of projectiles and also all mechanical motion, when the forces operating are known. This law, later generalized by the theory of relativity, allows us to describe the motion of very swift bodies having a speed close to that of light, as for instance in the case of elementary particles with very great speed. The understanding and application of New- ton's second law gave birth to the problem of the nature of the forces operating, and that in turn led us to the formulation of the laws governing electro-magnetic and gravitational fields. The second law of Newton became the key which opened and is today opening still wider the portals leading to the understanding of the laws of na- ture. The history of Newton's second law, its evolution and its modifications, is the history of a great part of physics. It connects accelerations mathematically with force, thus initiating a develop- ment in the course of which we have obtained by generalizing this law, an expanding sphere for its applicability to microcosmic phe- nomena and to speeds comparable to that of light. Leonardo wore himself out trying to understand the concept of force. And here we find only flashes of comprehension. In a cer- tain sense Leonardo was, as it were, an inconsistent materialist. According to him, matter has its own weight and form. Let us imagine that a force (pressure, gravitational force) acts upon some material body, and that the body moves. Nevertheless that force does not, as Leonardo reasoned, change either the weight or the form of the body, but only puts it into motion. Therefore, as a result, force, as he deduced, does not possess either weight or form, and</page><page sequence="11">36 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY hence is something non-material or (as it is called) something spirit- ual. And here Leonardo suddenly falls into the trap about which he constantly warned his reader. He uses words and sentences which say nothing very much, as did the sophists or the philosophers of the Middle Ages. Increasingly enchanted by the sound of his own words, he falls deeper and deeper into metaphysics. He often re- turns to this theme, and instead of talking in more and more down- to-earth terms, he flies higher and higher into the clouds. Let us quote several excerpts: I give the name of force to the spiritual, incorporeal, invisible power coming to life in bodies for a short time, which as a consequence of an external blow are to be found outside of the place where lie their exist- ence and natural repose. I say that it is spiritual because there is an invisible life in it, incorporeal and ungraspable, for the body in which it is conceived does not increase either in shape or weight. And elsewhere, again: I give the name of force to the spiritual power, the invisible strength which has been evoked through motion in the case of a fortuitous exter- nal blow, and transferred and dissolved into bodies which are thrust out of their natural repose. Force gives to them an active life of excelling power; it compels all created things to a change of shape and position; it hastens furiously to its own desired death, and it changes in accordance with its cause. Slowness makes it great, but swiftness diminishes it; it is born of violence and dies of freedom; and the greater it is the more quickly it uses itself up. In this same note we suddenly come upon the simple sentence: "Force is the cause of motion/' Actually that sentence- although anthropomorphic- passed for a long time as a definition of force. I recall that a teacher of mine in secondary school actually gave the same definition of force. And probably it still haunts many text- books today. Thus, therefore, we have to affirm that Leonardo was still far from an understanding of force and of the second law of dynamics. The reason for this is that an understanding of this law requires an understanding of the concept of acceleration, and even of dif- ferential equations. But it was too early for that, even for Leonardo.</page><page sequence="12">LEONARDO DA VINCI AND THE LAWS OF SCIENCE 37 And so it was that in investigating the motions of falling bodies Leonardo did not penetrate to the heart of the laws governing them, as did Galileo. The greatness of Galileo's accomplishment consisted in this: he understood that in order to describe this phe- nomenon in the modest mathematical terms then at his disposal, he had to idealize it; he had to ignore the resistance of air. Only then does the phenomenon of falling bodies emerge in all its simplicity. All falling bodies possess the same acceleration, if we ignore the re- sistance of air. The distances covered in free fall vary as the square of the time, and the speeds are proportional to the time. Of these two principles only one was known to Leonardo: that the speed is proportional to the time. One of the reasons why Leonardo did not arrive at the correct laws is the fact that in describing this phenomenon he tried to take the resistance of air into consideration. The resistance of air, the flight of birds, the possibility of aviation for men, exercised a real fascination over Leonardo for many years. He writes in an almost mythological vein: "The great bird will make its first flight- upon the back of its great swan- filling the whole world with astonish- ment, filling all records with its fame, and bringing eternal glory to its birthplace." There was nothing strange, therefore, in his inability to give up speculating on this aspect of the phenomenon of falling bodies, which appeared important to him, and which is indeed unusually complicated. He did not know that by ignoring the resistance of air he would have seen the motion of falling bodies in all its simplicity. This unheard-of scientific and artistic ambition of his, this desire to explain, to reproduce many phenomena in a perfect way, has brought it about that, in the words of Leopold Staff, Leon- ardo's work "presents today . . . the spectacle of a tremendous temple in ruins. The vessel bearing these treasures to us over the waves of time- treasures acquired on the mysterious and newly discovered continents of human spirit and thought- has reached us in a state of lamentable shipwreck." How much more have lesser people left behind them for humanity, in whose hearts there was no consuming flame of wonder for nature, no desire for a complete understanding of all that surrounds them. Let us return for a moment to the problem of motion. Leonardo considered the law of falling bodies not only with regard to the re-</page><page sequence="13">38 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY sistance of air, but also with regard to the rotation of the earth. In principle he arrived at correct results, qualitatively, although the problem is not an easy one and many years were to pass before it was completely solved. Similarly the third law of dynamics, the principle of action and reaction, although conceptually giving rise to much difficulty, was not foreign to Leonardo. He understood its physical content and formulated it distinctly in the special case of motion in the air. He wrote: "An object exercises the same force on the air as the air exercises upon it." The image which Leonardo had before him when he was formulating this principle was that of the flight of a bird which raises itself aloft by beating upon the air with its wings. We have tried to present, although but briefly, the part played by Leonardo in the historical development of the laws of dynamics. We have tried to estimate his scientific contribution from the per- spective of later centuries. In such an undertaking, however, there lies a certain danger of failing to appreciate Leonardo's scientific achievement. If, for instance, we tried to estimate the work of New- ton from the perspective of later centuries, such as the point of view of the achievements of the relativity theory, we should be obliged to state that Newton did not know the laws of motion governing bodies with speeds close to that of light. But it is through the labors, works and results of Leonardo as well as those of Newton that the immortal genius of their thought shines forth, evoking an admira- tion that endures through the ages. Ill We conventionally divide physics into a number of special sub- jects: mechanics, acoustics, thermodynamics, optics, magnetism and electricity. Physical phenomena from all these fields were the sub- ject of creative researches by Leonardo, with the exception of elec- tricity. But we do not wish to talk about these. We have posed the question: What was Leonardo's part in the development of an understanding of the fundamental laws of nature? So, making use of the same method as previously, let us glance at certain general principles held by science concerning nature, in order to find the connection between them and Leonardo's thought. If a beam of light from a certain point A reaches point B, what</page><page sequence="14">LEONARDO DA VINCI AND THE LAWS OF SCIENCE 39 path does it traverse in passing from A to B? According to Fermat's law, the beam of light chooses such a path as will enable it to pass from A to B in the shortest possible time. This is merely one simple example of the so-called "principle of variation," which we apply successfully in all parts of physics. Phenomena occur in such a way that certain quantities involved (in Fermat's instance, the length of time) may remain the smallest possible. These principles of variation, with the help of which we formulate the laws of nature, are today an immeasurably valuable tool for the understanding of all parts of physics. In Leonardo we find, once again, something like a presentiment of these principles. Obviously there can be no question of a fuller understanding of them at that time. Actually, in their modern form the mathematical methods connected with the principle of variations belong to the most refined of those applied by contempo- rary physics. Here are the words of Leonardo in which we may ob- serve an anticipation of these principles: "Every natural activity takes place on the shortest path possible." In another place: "Every natural activity is carried out by nature in the manner and time that will be the shortest possible." Or this: "O wonderful, O as- tounding necessity, by your law you compel all effects to proceed along the shortest path from their causes." Let use now pass to another theme. We know that out of the impossibility of discovering a perpetuum mobile the law of the conservation of energy was brought to light. Similarly, the vain quests of the alchemists gave birth to chemistry, the science of the elements and their combinations. Much later- for only in our own age was the dogma of the immutability of elements overthrown by the progress of nuclear physics. And once again we are convinced by the notes of Leonardo that he treated the seekers after perpetual motion on the same level as those who wished to change lead into gold: "O ye seekers after perpetual motion," he wrote, "what vain goals have you set yourselves by such inquiry! You are precisely like those who are seeking after gold." Let us recall one more principle. In a short work of his done in the year 1905, Einstein reached one of the most important con- clusions of contemporary physics as a result of his relativity theory: that is, the ponderability of energy. Did Leonardo have a presenti- ment of the possibility of this conclusion- the conclusion which may</page><page sequence="15">40 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY hold in its balance the fate of mankind? Leonardo suggests the following experiment: "Take a red-hot object, and weigh it again when it is cold." In principle, an ex- periment thus carried out ought to demonstrate whether heat en- ergy possesses mass. If we were to carry out this experiment today, even with the extremely sensitive scales we have at our disposal, the result would be negative. And yet we know of a certainty that the mass of every body increases with heating, although the most sensitive scales are not able to reveal this infinitesimal increase in mass. Nevertheless the conclusion is as certain as the discovery of atomic energy, and as the destruction of Hiroshima. Though it would be too far fetched to connect the name of Leonardo with atomic energy, yet he posed a question that found an answer only after four centuries, and it is this answer that led to the discovery of atomic energy. IV Our brief sketch of Leonardo, about whom volumes have been written, is now reaching an end. Let us ask: Is there any figure in the history of the way of thinking in physics, which reminds us of Leonardo? All such comparisons must necessarily be very superficial. For Leonardo is unique. However, it seems to me that there is a certain similarity between Leonardo da Vinci and Michael Fara- day. Neither the one nor the other had a formal education. Both of them owed their knowledge to themselves alone. Both possessed a new, fresh and original view of the phenomena of nature. Both carefully made notes of their work and their ideas. Both had a powerful scientific imagination, which is the most important factor in the creative knowledge of nature. Both of them thought rather in physical and geometrical than in analytical terms. Both lacked a sufficient knowledge of mathematical techniques. Â» Faraday had the good fortune to live in an environment which awaited his works and recognized his great discovery. But Leonardo? A man who designed new and airy cities, who designed canals, monu- ments and a huge number of technical machines, was known in the field of invention during his lifetime chiefly because he constructed mechanical toys for the amusement of princes, their wives and their mistresses. The chroniclers tell us admiringly that Leonardo con-</page><page sequence="16">LEONARDO DA VINCI AND THE LAWS OF SCIENCE 41 structed a mechanical lion. The lion moved of itself, and when it drew near to the ruler, it scattered lilies before him. How Leon- ardo must have suffered in serving people for whom he felt im- measurable contempt! Only gradually, as the image of his Last Supper darkens and dis- appears, does the figure of Leonardo brighten and increase in stature in the eyes of later generations. This great son of the Italian nation today belongs to the whole civilized world. His memory is dear to everyone who honors genius and is moved by the beautiful.
