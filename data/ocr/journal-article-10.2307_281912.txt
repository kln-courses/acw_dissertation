<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS AND BOOK NOTES antler, and ivory as raw materials, and why did they fail to develop special purpose or multicomponent tools? Why did their lithic assemblages show so little change across time and space? The answer is that cognitive domains were "walled-off' and Early Humans could not integrate natural history knowledge of animal behavior with technical intelligence. Social knowledge exists sep- arately from tool making, and these activities take place at different physical locations. Similarly, we do not observe beads or other items of personal decoration, or the ritual inclusion of animal parts in burials, because social messages cannot be integrated with technical fab- rication, and both alike are inaccessible to natural histo- ry intelligence. Nor can language serve an integrative function since linguistic intelligence remains embedded in and limited to the social module. Even technical advances like the Levallois method are thought passive- ly and unintentionally transmitted since Mithen's logic dictates that without language Neanderthal had no con- scious awareness of the cognitive processes housed in his technical and natural history intelligences. In Mithen's third phase, driven now by the integra- tive function of language unshackled from its origins in social intelligence, all domains become open to one another, and the full seamless "cognitive fluidity of the modem mind emerges. From this final redesign comes the cultural revolution of the Upper Paleolithic and our modem consciousness with its passion for analogy, metaphor, and other forms of creative imagination. Cognitive processes critical to making art, previously isolated in separate domains, now interact so that tech- nical intelligence can invest animals with human social meaning, and, in a quasi-alchemical transmutation (for Mithen never considers the sensory motor mechanisms involved), representational and symbolic image making, or art, comes into being. Also, ritualized burial practices and anthropomorphic or totemistic imagery prove con- clusively for Mithen that the mind can now violate the boundaries of specialized domains and entertain super- natural ideas necessary for religious beliefs. The plausibility of Mithen's linkup of theory with archaeology makes for heady reading, but how can we investigate its accuracy? One possibility is to check it against other bodies of knowledge about mental func- tions. Comparing Mithen's model with those sensory, motor, and cognitive functions asymmetrically localized in the left and right cerebral hemispheres immediately raises concerns. A known materialist entity, the hemi- spheric localization of language is lumped with mental- ist and perhaps speculative functions. Where are the spe- cialized neurological regions supporting Mithen's other intelligences? Why should the brain employ different evolutionary strategies for similar cognitive domains? Without confirmation from the material brain, we have no certainty that Mithen is definitively describing the basic faculties operating in human cognition. For all its comprehensiveness, Mithen's panoramic view rests on untested assumptions about the organization of the mind and the brain. Before Farming: Hunter-Gatherer Society and Subsistence. DOUGLAS V. CAMPANA, editor. 1995. MASCA Research Papers, Supplement 12. University Museum Publications, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. v + 117 pp., 34 figures, 16 tables, refer- ences. $25.00 (cloth). Reviewed by Ariane M. Burke, University of Manitoba. Editor Douglas Campana accurately describes the con- tributions to this volume as "disparate in subject and approach." The common thread that unites the five chapters in this book is a focus on subsistence systems in pre-agricultural societies. The book explores the important links between these societies and the environ- ments they exploited. A discussion of animal represen- tations in Upper Paleolithic art (Sally Casey) is followed by an analysis of the conditions under which social hunting occurs (Jonathan Driver) and three chapters that explore the changing nature of human-animal (and human-plant) relationships in the period immediately preceding the adoption of a sedentary, agricultural lifestyle in the Near East (Eitan Tchernov) and in Europe (Marek Zvelebil, Peter Bogucki). Casey discusses the visual imagery used to depict animals in Upper Paleolithic artwork from the south- western French caves of Lascaux and Le Gabillou. This methodical study highlights the detailed knowledge of animal behavior that the prehistoric artists appear to have possessed. The potential use of seasonal imagery as a means of understanding the seasonal context within which the artwork was created is considered with rea- sonable caution. Although a fairly extensive body of published work explores the themes taken up by Casey, readers unfamiliar with Upper Paleolithic art will per- haps be surprised at the level of sophisticated observa- tion on the part of the prehistoric artists, which the author makes evident. Driver models the ecological and social conditions under which "social hunting" (multiple predation, whether communal or cooperative) may become a sig- nificant component of human subsistence before the adoption of farming. Regional prey densities, prey dis- persal patterns, hunting technology, and a capacity for social organization are the determining factors for social hunting. The archaeological signature of social hunting includes the presence of artificial or natural facilities for 761</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY driving game, the presence of bone beds, and mortality profiles, which include significant portions of the prey population. In Driver's model, social hunting is predicted in sit- uations where the diversity of prey species is low, where one or two prey species are predominant, when signifi- cant seasonal changes in prey quality and dispersal pat- terns exist, and when adequate hunting technology and social conditions facilitating cooperation are also pre- sent. This model is used to explain the appearance of social hunting in the European archaeological record during the late Upper Paleolithic. The final three chapters of this volume discuss the transition to farming from very different geographical and analytical perspectives. Analytically, Tchernov adopts what he considers an integrative approach to the study of cultural change, based on the natural sciences. This approach clearly has a lot to offer given the essen- tial nature of the relationship between humans and their environment, and Tchemov uses it to good effect in his exploration of the ecological transformations that accompany sedentism. Arguably, however, both Zvelebil and Bogucki, who adopt more familiar analyti- cal stances in their contributions, are equally aware of the complex web of interactions between humans and their environment. Tchernov's attempt to frame his explanation for cul- ture change in terms of "basic ecological rules" is some- what unconvincing, since his study is restricted to the Levant. The reader is made aware of the difficulties of extrapolating universal rules of cultural transformation from a single study region in the chapters that follow. Both Zvelebil and Bogucki present well-integrated models for a transition to sedentary, food-producing economies in Europe that encompass more variability than Tchernov's model. Zvelebil proposes a longer, more gradual and varied process of economic (and cultural) transformation in Mesolithic Europe. While presenting a model of inten- sive plant use and wild pig husbandry in Mesolithic Europe, Zvelebil explores the issue of variability in human responses to postglacial environmental change, as a result of social (ideological) differences. Bogucki also explores human cultural variability in his dynamic, nonlinear model of the beginnings of agriculture in Northern Europe. He models a complex, interrelated system of Mesolithic resource exploitation and land management techniques for the Northern European plain, into which domesticated plants and animals could be easily integrated, thus downplaying the concept of "stages" or "punctuational transformations" found else- where. Before Farming offers the reader an interesting vari- ety of themes under the broad umbrella of archaeozoo- logical research. It is a healthy sign for the field of archaeozoology that its practitioners continue to con- tribute to our understanding of the complex ways in which ecosystems and cultural systems interact in a wide variety of contexts. Europe in the Neolithic: The Creation of New Worlds. ALASDAIR WHITTLE. 1996. Cambridge University Press, England. xvi + 443 pp., 126 illustrations, bibliog- raphy, index. $80.00 (cloth), $34.95 (paper). Reviewed by Sarunas Milisauskas, State University of New York, Buffalo. The large and diverse number of books published on the European Neolithic over the last decade confirms the field's vibrancy. Specifically, British archaeologists must be credited for applying new theoretical approach- es, especially postprocessual ones, to the study of the European Neolithic. Some of the best and most outra- geous studies originate from the British Isles. I strongly recommend Alasdair Whittle's book, although I disagree with some of his interpretations. Whittle is distinguishable among British archaeologists writing on the Neolithic. He is familiar with the archae- ological record and provides fair treatment to alternative explanations. It is not easy to synthesize data that are presented in numerous languages and hundreds of jour- nals. Whittle presents us with an excellent synthesis. In 1985 Whittle published Neolithic Europe: A Survey (Cambridge University Press). His most recent book is not a second edition of the earlier publication; instead, this book documents changes in his theoretical outlook on the Neolithic based on contemporary archae- ological developments. Now, Whittle stresses the inap- propriateness of uncritically applying ethnographic analogy to prehistory. He also begins each chapter with a narrative. For example, chapter 9 (p. 315) starts, "In the later fourth millennium BC, a man was caught out in the cold on the Hauslabjoch near the Tisenjoch pass in the Tyrolean Alps between Italy and Austria." Whittle then proceeds to describe the so-called Iceman and ends his narrative accordingly, "Though popularly famous for his lonely death, the Iceman best illustrates the routine flux of life in the later Neolithic" (p. 317). Throughout the book, Whittle emphasizes indige- nous developments or continuity and greater mobility of the Neolithic farmers, while deemphasizing competition and the appearance of ranked societies. In addition, he stresses the importance of values, ideals, and social sanctions during the European Neolithic. Whittle has developed a number of new and stimu- lating interpretations on the Neolithic societies. He 762 [Vol. 62, No. 4, 1997]</page></plain_text>
