<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Devious Symbols": Dante Gabriel Rossetti's Purgatorio CATHERINE MAXWELL S SHORT LYRIC "THE WOODSPURGE," A FAVORITE OF THE AN- thologists and a perennial choice for inclusion in practical criticism papers, is one of the pieces by which the work of this still underread poet is best known. The reasons for this are perhaps not hard to fathom. What Pater in 1883 called "a vocabulary, an accent, unmistakably novel,"1 and the uncanny blend of spirituality and sensuality, the peculiarly height- ened language and sustained symbolism that characterize a major piece like The House of Life, still arouse curiously ambivalent responses in many critics and readers, for whom there lingers an unsettling foreign or hybrid quality to this verse, not quite congruent with good taste. To such read- ers, "The Woodspurge" seems like a welcome release. Celebrated for a refreshing Pre-Raphaelite naturalism, it is read, as Hardy's poems fre- quently are, as a lyric of the English empirical tradition. In my opinion, such a reading grossly simplifies the poem, which may be located in another tradition entirely, one that establishes significant connections between this piece and other important and misunderstood elements in Rossetti's work. Once "The Woodspurge" is realigned with this tradition, it becomes apparent that its pared-down language is ex- traordinarily condensed and overdetermined to a degree that shatters any illusion of artless immediacy. Alternative patterns of reading emerge, and in tracing these it becomes possible to reconstruct the complex creative network of interactions which underlies Rossetti's poetics, and which makes "The Woodspurge" a cryptic key to his oeuvre. While modern critics see themselves as correcting previous overly biographical interpretations of Rossetti's poetry, it is still possible to de- tect in readings of the poetry the unquestioning or unexplained identifi- cation of the poet's self with a first-person poetic voice. "The Woodspurge" is a good example of this, and one suspects that many read- ers are subliminally affected by William Michael Rossetti's assertion that "this 'occasional poem' expresses, I have no doubt, some actual moment, in my brother's life, of distressful experience and harrowing thought. I do not know what it may have been - perhaps some crisis of Miss Siddal's 19</page><page sequence="2">2o / VICTORIAN POETRY ill-health."2 Hence such paraphrases as the following: "In this lyric, the poet, distressed by some unnamed grief, walks out at random, following the wind"; "The poet remains totally isolated in his grief."3 This identifi- cation is not accidental, for the implication of an authentic actuality is highly relevant for interpretations which see the poem as rejecting a sym- bolic mode for experiential data. It is an irony, then, that this important sense of immediacy and felt experience should, in fact, be qualified by a different kind of empirical detail, which suggests the fictive nature of the events of the poem. In his survey of nineteenth-century religious poetry, Hoxie Neale Fairchild, dis- cussing Rossetti's application of "technical skill to the production of vari- ous effects," claims: "The Woodspurge, that remarkable rendering of the blankness of exhausted sorrow, was suggested by a picture in a botany textbook."4 Fairchild gives no source for this discovery, but, in the light of Rossetti's lack of interest in the natural world, it sounds credible.5 I would suggest that the botany textbook referred to is Gerard's Herball (1597). This work, much admired by William Morris, and instrumental in the development of his designs and dyeing techniques, was among the books Hall Caine noted in Rossetti's library.6 The Herball, which is the most important work of its kind in English, containing fine woodcuts of the many varieties of plants discussed, de- votes a complete chapter to illustration and description of the group named the spurges. The ninth type of spurge listed is the woodspurge - "Tithymalus characias amygdabides" - "the seed contained in three cor- nered seed-vessels."7 Strangely, in a poem commonly viewed as refuting allegorical or sym- bolic meaning in favor of the particulars of experience, the particularity of a name - "woodspurge" (also the title of the poem) - often passes with- out comment. In their belief in the essentially random nature or arbi- trariness of experience, Rossetti's interpreters have failed to ask why he singled out this plant among all others. The Herball provides an answer, for it contains a comprehensive account of the spurge and its "vertues," which I believe Rossetti remembered and whose significance I shall ex- plain. Perhaps the critics' oversight is not so surprising when we realize that attention to this name and its implications immediately restores a level of symbolic meaning which threatens the evaluation of the poem as a record of "[the poet's] actions and sensations in the simplest possible terms" (Christ, p. 46). The spurges derive their name from their medicinal property of pur- gation and purification. The juice of the spurge is notoriously bitter to the taste, "a sharp and biting qualitie" says Gerard. This acrid juice can be employed as a purgative, and though this use was well established by</page><page sequence="3">CATHERINE MAXWELL / 21 physicians from early times, it can be a drastic, dangerous remedy, with a possible risk of fatality, so that Gerard advises his readers to substitute other herbs "that may bee taken without perill" (pp. 505, 506). Given these associations, the plant, whose detailed image the speaker offers us in the final line of the poem, functions as a rebus for the word "catharsis," whose literal meaning is "purgation," and which has a literary as well as a modern psychological provenance. The notion of a drastic purgation works in the poem in a number of ways, most obviously in the purged vision of the grief-stricken narrator. The stark and simple monosyllabic diction seems initially devoid of metaphor, as the speaker, in numbed and flattened tones, gives the reader precise coordinates for his discovery of the plant. The poem diminishes its visual field from the wind-becalmed landscape to the small patch of ground encompassed by the speaker's withdrawn and hunched posture, and then to the one weed out of the ten he finds he has arbitrarily en- closed. The speaker's crouched body seems at first almost embryonic, per- haps because he is about to experience a rite of passage, or perhaps be- cause a singular deprivation has reduced him to a state of utter vulner- ability.8 Furthermore, behind the imagery of the first two lines of the poem - "The wind flapped loose, the wind was still, / Shaken out dead from tree and hill" - there may flutter the partly repressed phrase "still- born"; the wind drops like a stillborn child, and the speaker's posture could mime a failed fruition or symbolic stillbirth experience.9 Nonethe- less, at the same time, the picture of the speaker's abandoned, bowed atti- tude could also suggest a violent retching, a bitter bringing-up, expellation or purgation of some inner burden or pressure. This emetic purgation is implied in an obsolete version of the verb "to spurge," meaning "to spout or gush out in a stream, to cast forth copi- ously" (OED). Gerard informs us that: "The iuice of Tithymale ... is a strong medicine to open the bellie, and causing vomite, bringeth vp toughe flegme and cholericke humours" (p. 506). What, we may wonder, is it that Rossetti's speaker spews out? What is it that he cannot swallow? Gerard's language of "flegme" and "cholericke humours" is not restricted to physical evacuation alone, but represents a typical sixteenth-century blend of psychical and somatic factors. Rossetti's poem enacts a drama of emotional purgation, but another purgation comes about in terms of lan- guage and content. By this, I refer not merely to the bleached laconic tones of the speaker and the emptying of pastoral lyricism, but to a more integral catharsis. Critics have sometimes plausibly read "The Woodspurge" as a reaction to Romanticism. But they have not developed this insight according to the logic of the poem. For what does it mean to spurge or purge a wood in literary terms? I would suggest that in his cast-</page><page sequence="4">22 / VICTORIAN POETRY ing out of "Wisdom" and "memory" in his last stanza, Rossetti attempts to rid himself of a particular precursor. The numbed spare tones of "sim- plicity" of "The Woodspurge" parody the simplicity of early Wordsworth, and the final lines, in their refusal of nature's moral didacticism, mock- ingly echo the language and sentiment of verse such as this: One impulse from a vernal wood May teach you more of man, Of moral evil and of good, Than all the sages can.10 "The Woodspurge" is thus a concerted purging of these Wordsworthian vernal woods. Such a view is compatible with Rossetti's own stated unease with Wordsworth: "He's good, you know, but unbear- able."11 Wordsworth's perceived treatment of nature constitutes a burden from which Rossetti is impelled to free himself. If the symbolic language of purgation makes it more problematic to speak of "The Woodspurge" as a poem that shuns symbolic meaning, the complication of a poetic revi- sion - the acrimonious emptying-out or freeing of self from a literary forebear - only adds to this, besides restoring the "sophistication" that Richard Cronin has denied.12 The specifically literary engagement that figures in Rossetti's poem makes the reader consider the scene of writing as integral to the piece, as something that creates and structures perception in a symbolic form, rather than the supposedly self-evaporating act of transcription which faithfully documents and preserves experiential data, an act whose humble traces completely disappear when a reading is but a mode of real- ization. This desire for pure realization is found in Jerome McGann's per- ception that "at that time and in that place this poet gained a measure of relief from a simple act of observation. No conceptualized knowledge or wisdom was involved, either before or after."13 The identification of poet with narrator and the phrase "before or after" betray the critic's desire to preserve the events narrated in the poem as unmediated, carrying the same authority as they did at the moment of their supposed occurrence. An innocence of vision is claimed for the poet; the business of poetry- making has to be minimized in order for the reader to heed the moral im- port offered: "[The woodspurge] is a modest yet graphic reminder that unless you approach the external world in as complete an innocence as possible life will shrink up and die . . . For us as readers, the poet's woodspurge is ... the sign of his innocent powers" (pp. 234-235). It is hard to see the creative canniness that shapes Rossetti's expul- sion of Wordsworth, an act which according to McGann's chronology would be "after" the narrated events, either as evidence of his innocent powers, or as other than wisdom, if wisdom of a singularly unWordsworthian kind. For a great difference exists between innocence</page><page sequence="5">CATHERINE MAXWELL / 23 and acting innocent; the second, antithetical to the first, reminds us of the paradox of naturalism, an artifice whose devices are every bit as con- trived as those literary modes which self-consciously announce them- selves as style. Rossetti may well mime innocence without being inno- cent. It is an irony that purges, and acts of purgation or purification, whether actual or symbolic, are themselves external to the state of inno- cence or complete purity they intend to impose or restore: they are de- pendent on a systematized knowledge or wisdom of what it is that pre- vents purity, and engage in the often squalid process of its elimination, using drastic, perhaps fatal, but certainly unbenign measures. Purgation is an (impure) act which may itself be contaminated or compromised by the object it hopes to expel. To use a familiar postlapsarian paradigm, one cannot recover full Edenic purity once one has sampled the Tree of Knowledge. McGann prefaces his treatment of "The Woodspurge" with a discus- sion of the early poem "My Sister's Sleep" to show how the same ideas are present; how Rossetti demonstrates that "significance is in the sensa- tion": [Rossetti] wants us to seek and fail to find the religious "meaning" in his stanza, and failing to find it, to recognize the purely sensational value of the lines. By this we are brought to an unexpected experience. Phenomena - things, people, places, images - are restored to a kind of innocence. Saved from their overlay or traditional symbolism, the items of experience can again be, as it were, simply themselves, (p. 233) But, representation, literature as symbolic form, surely means that once represented, items of experience cannot be "simply themselves" - as in Stevens' poem: "The man replied, Things as they are / Are changed upon the blue guitar.'"14 And yet, oddly enough, the passage just quoted from McGann opens with the words "Rossetti's art here is highly self- conscious," which seems in tension with the passage that follows. If the purgation McGann describes (although it is not a word he ever uses) is practiced self-consciously to a deliberate aesthetic end, the "saving," the "restoration to innocence" (and one might note the religious tones of this language of redemption) must then mean that "the items of experi- ence" cannot be themselves, and if they do not constitute traditional symbolism, then they create another symbolism in which they become the figures of innocence. McGann ousts one version of religious symbol- ism, but his critical language tacitly reinstates a "religious" dimension in its insistence on a state cf purity: "Rossetti keeps the scene uncontaminated by intellectual significances" (p. 233). However, I should like to examine more closely McGann's claim that Rossetti cleanses his poetic language of religious associations, with reference to "The Woodspurge," to see if that poem could be what McGann's hints might imply - a purging of religious symbolism. The un-</page><page sequence="6">24 / VICTORIAN POETRY acknowledged language of purgation is strikingly present in his comments on "My Sisters Sleep." Discussing some of the images in the poem, he says they "are purified of any possible religious content which they vaguely suggest," and elsewhere he writes that "the stanza is an artistic triumph because it succeeds in sterilizing completely the religious po- tency of the images" (p. 233). The religious suggestions in "My Sister's Sleep" are not neutralized in this way. McGann's interpretation of the poem, as various commentators have pointed out, did not take into account Rossetti's extensive revision of the poem from its first appearance in the periodical, The New Monthly Belle Assemblie, in September 1848.15 The rationale for revision seems to be Rossetti's desire to modify the more orthodox Christian pietism of the earliest version. In their revised form, the figures of the poem may have lost a pronounced Catholic character and become less explicit, but this particular symbolic dimension cannot be so easily dismissed, and the im- ages retain an integral spiritual suggestiveness. The point is important, I think, because although Rossetti may have rebelled against established forms of religious expression, the spiritual element in his work, however unconventional, is very significant. While Rossetti's belief in formal religion may have declined, the legacy of the Anglo-Catholicism he practiced from his mid- teens to early twenties was considerable and still needs more assessment.16 D.M.R. Bentley's valuable work on this topic does not seem to me to be disturbed by David Riede's championing of the claims of William Michael Rossetti as to his brother's lack of faith.17 William Michael, a firm agnostic, found it difficult to entertain the idea of Dante Gabriel's residual interest in spiritual affairs, and became visibly uneasy at the latent manifestations of his brother's spiritual inclinations.18 Residual interest in religious matters among lapsed believers is hardly uncommon, and embarrassed bluff dis- claimers made to friends and relatives unlikely to be sympathetic need not necessarily be taken at face value. Other acquaintances received a different impression. Canon Richard Watson Dixon recalled Rossetti's indignation at charges of irreligion: "He asked with great earnestness, 'Do not my works testify to my Christianity?'" William Michael remarks that Rossetti was "very much pleased" by the text of a lecture on his poetry that Hall Caine gave in Liverpool, "more especially on the grounds of the lecturer's recognition of the moral or spiritual tone marking the poems."19 Moreover, William Michael acknowledges that the second published ver- sion of "My Sister's Sleep" "shows in an eminent degree one of the influ- ences which guided [the Pre-Raphaelite] movement: the intimate intertexture of a spiritual sense with a material form; small actualities made vocal of lofty meanings."20</page><page sequence="7">CATHERINE MAXWELL / 25 Before I return to "The Woodspurge," I want to make an extended necessary detour to explain the basis for Rossetti's own thinking on an immanent spiritual symbolism, and to differentiate it from that of Ruskin, whose name inevitably occurs in discussion of the fidelity of the poem to nature. To begin with, I quote, from the group of three sonnets called "Old and New Art" in The House of Life, the first sonnet - "St. Luke the Painter": Give honour unto Luke Evangelist; For he it was (the aged legends say) Who first taught Art to fold her hands and pray. Scarcely at once she dared to rend the mist Of devious symbols: but soon having wist How sky-breadth and field-silence and this day Are symbols also in some deeper way, She looked through these to God and was God's priest. And if, past noon, her toil began to irk, And she sought talismans, and turned in vain To soulless self-reflections of man's skill, - Yet now, in this the twilight, she might still Kneel in the latter grass to pray again, Ere the night cometh and she may not work.21 William Michael Rossetti declared the group of three sonnets as "perhaps the best manifesto that [the Pre-Raphaelite movement] ever received in writing" (Works, p. 656). The argument of the octet is that painting in its historical evolution from a formal iconography to other forms of repre- sentation shows us not a refutation of symbolism, but rather a widening of the symbolic field: the picturing of natural objects becomes not an emptying-out but an alternative mode of communicating spiritual truth. The sestet discusses subsequent developments in Art which refine into introverted and sterile virtuosity. If St. Luke, traditionally the first reli- gious painter, is seen as the initiator of an interpretive symbolic mode, then this evangelical sonnet advocates a renovating return to origins which includes natural symbolism: Art "might still / Kneel in the latter grass to pray again." Modern Art, the work of Pre-Raphaelites, is a revi- sion which hearkens back to the primitive spiritual intensity of meaning apparent in the work of the early Italian painters, but communicates it through the symbolic mode of the Book of Nature and the Gospel of Ruskin. Rossetti's use of the term "Evangelist" could be construed as wit- tily predicating a continuum between St. Luke, the founder of Catholic art, and Ruskin's Protestant Evangelicalism, which fires his preaching of the good news of Art's return to Nature's immanent theology.22 Such a link, of course, is not unproblematic, particularly as Protestant and Catholic thought tend to different conceptions of materiality and the re- lation of the physical world to the spiritual. Protestant Evangelicalism</page><page sequence="8">26 / VICTORIAN POETRY does not sit very happily beside the Catholic language of "priesthood" (1. 8), which can involve a symbolic and emblematic notion of the priest's representing God and Christ to his congregation, an idea repugnant to the demos of radical Protestantism. However, by the time Rossetti comes to write "The Woodspurge," he has begun to work out the crucial differ- ences between his own thought and that of Ruskin, and the issue of symbolism becomes a key area of division. Rossetti's mergence of spiritual and sensual is not, as is sometimes hinted, a disingenuous means for elevating physicality. Reconstructing the ideological background to Rossetti's work helps make this clear and goes some way to explaining how an apparent coincidence with Ruskin's thought in "St. Luke the Painter" is achieved through the crossing of two lines of belief, which are quite distinct in origin. Pater's 1883 essay on Rossetti, still one of the acutest readings of him as a poet, offers a subtle exploration of the context of Rossetti's writing: Spirit and matter, indeed, have been for the most part opposed, with a false contrast or antagonism by schoolmen, whose artificial creation those abstractions really are. . . . Practically, the church of the Middle Age by its aesthetic worship, its sacramentalism, its real faith in the resurrection of the flesh, had set itself against that Manichean opposition of spirit and matter, and its results in men's way of taking life; and in this, Dante is the central representative of its spirit. To him, . . . the material and the spiritual are fused and blent. . . . Rossetti is one with him. . . . Like Dante, he knows no region of spirit which shall not be sensuous also, or material. (Appreciations, pp. 212-213) Rossetti's aesthetic has firm roots in Catholic incarnational doctrine, in which Christ's bodily and physical life is seen as inseparable from his divine or spiritual nature. Catholic sacramental theology insists that physical acts and concrete objects are both wholly corporeal and spiritual at the same time. A sacrament is "the outward sign of an inward grace," and the celebration of the sacrament of the Eucharist in a Catholic mass very evidently involves all five senses. In general, Catholic worship of the kind Rossetti experienced at the High Anglican Christ Church, Albany Street, which he attended with his family from 1843, places great empha- sis on the participation of the senses, especially vision, in its use of ritual; a ritual practiced in an environment designed to stimulate the believer into meditation through visual display. The Jesuit master Ignatius Loyola prescribed the use of the senses in his famous Spiritual Exercises as an aid to the imagination in evoking religious scenes and subjects for contem- plation, and the Ignatian principle of "finding God in all things" is a sen- timent curiously echoed in the octet of "St. Luke the Painter." Such thinking informs Catholic iconology in both its poetic and painterly forms; early manifestations include a substantial body of work by Jesuit writers who eagerly adopt the practice of the emblem book for their own theological purposes.23</page><page sequence="9">CATHERINE MAXWELL / 27 Protestantism typically elevates the spiritual over the material, whereas the central tenet of Catholic sacramentalism is that the two na- tures are indivisible. Ruskin's passion for Nature looks at odds with his religious affiliation, but is made legitimate by his adaptation of another strand of Protestant thought. The literalism which governs English Prot- estant reading of Scripture is applied by Ruskin to Nature, and thus pro- duces his insistence on a literalism of perception. Literalism becomes a figure in which natural objects substitute for Holy Writ; Nature, like the Bible, is a God-inspired text, and reading Nature-Scripture aright de- mands a fidelity to the observed object so that it might yield its truth about the goodness of the creator. The physical world thus assumes an importance for Ruskin which it lacks for other Protestant thinkers, and yet, because, for him, spiritual truth resides foremost in an accurate ap- prehension of design, the spiritually symbolic meaning in physical objects tends to become obscured and erased. A good example of this distinction between the literal and symbolic truth of material objects is examined by D.M.R. Bentley. Ruskin very much admired the picture he commissioned from Rossetti, entitled "The Passover," a picture in which, Rossetti explained to Patmore, the repre- sentation of the Passover was intended to convey "its actuality as an inci- dent no less than as a scriptural type." The painting is strongly typologi- cal, but Ruskin declared to Rossetti: "I call that Passover plain prosy Fact. No symbolism at all." Bentley concludes that "Rossetti's essentially Catholic conception of Scriptural types' or figurae - learned, very likely from Dante - is in direct opposition to the spirit of Protestant literal- ism."24 Much later on, in his lecture on "The Art of England: E. Burne- Jones and G. F. Watts," given on May 16, 1883, Ruskin, speaking of Rossetti's painting, acknowledges its symbolical meaning, but nonethe- less declares, "The peculiar value and character of the treatment is in what I have called its material veracity, compelling the spectator's belief, if he have the instinct of belief in him at all, in the thing's having verily happened; and not being a mere poetical fancy."25 Perhaps this distinction in the two writers' appreciation of material- ity is highlighted by the very different responses they have to the body - a key area, as, in human experience, our own bodies and those of our par- ents are the first material forms we encounter. Our perception of materi- ality is epitomized by our primary experience of the organizing machine that makes perception possible and the perceiving senses present to themselves. Ruskin's aversion to corporeality, and, in particular, sexual expres- sion, as shown in his antipathy to the painted nude, comes uncomplicatedly straight from ascetic Protestantism. Throughout the sec-</page><page sequence="10">28 / VICTORIAN POETRY ond volume of Modern Painters, "one encounters his intense dislike of things physical and physically pleasurable. ... He finds the body as body distasteful, discomforting, and even disgusting."26 Innate repulsion means the body forgoes the intense reading Ruskin bestows on other natural forms, and seemingly lacks a self-evident spiritual sense.27 For Rossetti, the body and sexuality obviously partake of spiritually symbolic truths;28 the logical reverse of this being that abstractions - such as Truth and Hope - inevitably assume bodily form and character in his verse. If Ruskin's gaze characteristically falls on landscape and away from the hu- man body, Rossetti's gaze falls on the face and form of the beloved and away from natural objects considered in their own right. William MichaePs discussion of his brother's lack of interest in Nature makes abundantly clear the distance between Ruskin and Rossetti: To the beauties of Nature he was not insensitive, but he was incurious, and he valued them more as being so much fuel to the fire of the soul than as being objects of separate regard and analysis. For him the Human Being was always the Lord of Creation - the recipient and transformer and transmitter of the natural influences. That he cared very little for descriptive poetry is perfectly true - and just on that account; that it exhibits and extols objects instead of turning them into the "medium of exchange" between the material world and the soul. (Family -Letters, 1:410-411) Needless to say, while Ruskin shuns any conspicuous dealings with corpo- reality, the repressed returns in the anthropomorphism of his landscapes. The language of the Psalms ("Let the floods clap their hands, let the hills be joyful together," Psalm 98.8) makes legitimate an attribution of bodily identity to nature. George Hersey comments: "To Ruskin the living body of Nature at her most sublime was a physique. . . . Earth's mountains are breasts and arms."29 And yet, as will become apparent, this very transfer- ence of identity is something Ruskin censures elsewhere. On January 15, 1856, Ruskin published the long-awaited third vol- ume of Modem Painters. A letter from Rossetti to Browning of February 6 reports that he is over halfway through Ruskin's latest publication, and makes special mention of Chapter 4 on "Of the False Ideal: First, Reli- gious."30 Ruskin's discussion "Of the Pathetic Fallacy," which forms the twelfth chapter of Modem Painters Illy is one of his most celebrated treat- ments of the importance of a faithful depiction of nature. The pathetic fallacy, as it is commonly used as a literary critical term, is often simply understood as the imputation of human thought or feeling to natural ob- jects; but in Ruskin's original sense, it refers to a disordered state of per- ception insofar as the strong or violent feelings of the viewer or narrator cause a false appearance in the object.31 This false appearance most often involves animation of the object or the transference of the viewer's emo- tion to what is inanimate. Ruskin draws up a hierarchy of poets in the be- lief that "the greatest poets do not often admit this kind of falseness." The discussion has the closest connection with Rossetti's poem at the</page><page sequence="11">CATHERINE MAXWELL / 29 point where Ruskin sets out "three ranks": these consisting in the first in- stance of the man who perceives rightly, because he does not feel, and to whom the primrose is very accurately the primrose, because he does not love it. Then, secondly, the man who perceives wrongly, because he feels, and to whom the primrose is anything else than a primrose: a star, or a sun, or a fairy's shield, or a forsaken maiden. And then, lastly, there is the man who perceives rightly in spite of his feelings, and to whom the primrose is for ever nothing else than itself - a little flower apprehended in the very plain and leafy fact of it, whatever and how many soever the associations and passions may be that crowd around it.32 The year to which William Michael tentatively assigns the composi- tion of "The Woodspurge" is 1856, and the poem may well be either an immediate or somewhat later response to this passage.33 At first sight, Ruskin's third rank appears to fit Rossetti's poem beautifully.34 But there is a problem in that the simple words which communicate "the very plain and leafy fact of it" - "The woodspurge flowered, three cups in one" - borrow directly from the symbolic language of Trinitarian doctrine, a doctrine which St. Patrick, and innumerable parish priests after him, have chosen to illustrate with natural emblems such as three-leafed clo- vers. Rossetti may introduce this resonance to modify or question it, choosing to admit the religious element in order to expunge it. Certainly, the last stanza adds an important qualification. If the poem consisted of three stanzas alone, lacking the fourth stanza, it might be legitimately thought a poem of religious consolation. I do not contend that "The Woodspurge" is a religious poem, that it is a covert Trinitarian tract, but it does seem to me that the "religious element" adds a level of complexity to the poem that has not been thought through before with sufficient rigor. Rather than neutralizing the significance of religious symbolism, the poem draws upon the power of a religious idea, transferring that power to another object, to make it iconic. The "very plain and leafy fact" of the plant, even as it is related in the simplest diction, becomes implicated in the symbolic and the iconographic. This is not a throwing off of symbolism, or if it is, it is in vain, because the symbolism returns to haunt "plain speech," transplants itself, even as speech claims itself pure of figure, transparent and immedi- ate. Language, especially poetic language, is shown as necessarily impure, stained through and through with the traces of earlier writings and im- ages which can suddenly permeate the apparent tabula rasa of a particular scene of writing. The piece functions rather in the manner of those words of subtraction with the suffix "-less" where, for example, to say something is "stainless" is not the same as to call it "pure." For "stainlessness" sug- gests the mental image of what it would erase, and the effect is that of a comparison between a marked presence and its withdrawal, with the lat- ter state only having meaning by its reference to the former. The stain</page><page sequence="12">3o / VICTORIAN POETRY always leaves a trace, even when it is invisible, just as a purged body can only be understood as such with reference to what has been expelled. The poem's trace may well be Catholic symbolism, and most defi- nitely contains Ruskin and Wordsworth. These writers cannot be ex- punged completely, for purgation is meaningless without reference to what it would purge, so the poem mischievously mingles these Protestant writers with an alien Catholic aesthetic. Furthermore, at the intertextual level, we can see that the apparent crystal clarity of this plain-spoken lyric is won through its lessening and diminishment of writers such as Wordsworth and Ruskin. Plain speech, the prerogative of Protestant preachers, is turned against its practitioners, is doubled and duplicitous with a hidden figured eloquence. In the surface drama of Rossetti's poem, the phenomenon of visible erasure is intelligible to the reader in the muted simplicity of the speaker's language, from which the passion of agony has been voided (1. 6). The sensed subtraction of the vivid accents of passion or lament indicates their former or suppressed presence. This reference to the emotional complexion of the poem leads into Rossetti's second subtle qualification of the pathetic fallacy. In Ruskin's view, the true appearances of things are jeopardized by the presence of strong emotion which clouds perception. As Patricia Ball has com- mented, Ruskin has a campaign to "cleanse the eye, to increase its recep- tivity, and so to help it discover that the rewards of the exercise are not less but greater than those of self-consciousness."35 But Rossetti implies that in this case it is strong emotion - "perfect grief" - which acts as a purifier of vision and brings about clearsightedness. Strangely enough, Ruskin himself had admitted something very simi- lar to this two years previously in a letter to the Times in defense of Holman Hunt's "The Awakening Conscience": "Nothing is more notable than the way in which the most trivial objects force themselves upon the attention of a mind which has been fevered by violent or distressful ex- citement. They thrust themselves forward with a ghastly and unendurable distinctness, as if they would compel the sufferer to count, or measure, or learn them by heart."36 This contradiction, not uncommon in Ruskin, is akin to those other fertile moments in his writing where desire or imagi- nation clash with will or stated rationale, as in "Of the Pathetic Fallacy," where the strength of his protest partly derives from his resistance to a strongly felt personal inclination.37 Passion and strong emotions connect very clearly to the self and the body. At times, Ruskin seems determined to remove from all observation of landscape every trace of what Thomas Hardy, an unrepentant practitioner of the pathetic fallacy, calls the "mark . . . made by man."38 The persona and the observing body of the onlooker are ideally required to remain outside and not intrude on the</page><page sequence="13">CATHERINE MAXWELL / 31 scene under scrutiny.39 Of course, Ruskin, whose own persona is so strongly marked, violates this principle continually, just as when he ar- gues against the sway of strong emotion in "Of the Pathetic Fallacy" in highly emotive and emotional language. At first glance, the narrator in Rossetti's poem seems unmarked: his abstention from the emphatic colors of grief makes him seem empty, un- til we realize what his emptiness begs us supply. He submits himself pas- sively to the movement of the wind; yet, as I have shown, this descrip- tion hides an image of failed fruition which is a transference of the speaker's emotion onto nature. The poem moves from the landscape to the position of the speaker's body, which is described in careful detail, and then to a miniature landscape, only visible and intelligible through its relation to the body which encloses it. The plant that the speaker se- lects, apparently so arbitrarily, begins to yield up a set of organized sym- bolic values that only function with reference to his grieving bodily self. This recalls William Michael's evaluation of his brother's belief: "For him the Human Being was always the Lord of Creation - the recipient and transformer and transmitter of the natural influences" (Family -Letters, 1:411). Rossetti's complication of the apparently simple account of the woodspurge results in a remarkable set of interactions between different levels and aspects of the poem. This complexity of symbolic purpose is analogous to the kind we find posited of a Catholic sacrament, often de- fined as "that which brings about the thing of which it is the sign." The sacraments are physical acts of symbolic import, which are efficacious, possessing a determined performative spiritual function, and are under- stood to impress "an indelible mark of grace upon the soul." In Rossetti's poem, the woodspurge possesses something akin to this: to begin with, in the basic narrative of the lyric, the apparently simple material fact of the plant is the end product of the speaker's grief and is a sign of purged vi- sion. However, at another level, in which the name and symbolic at- tributes of the plant are operative, the woodspurge brings about the intertextual purgation of poetic vision of which it is the sign. In doing this, we should note that it provides its own mark - a mark which indel- ibly prints the mind and consciousness of the narrator. But this mark contains within it the trace of that which cannot be purged or cast out - the previous imprints and impressions of other texts. I located Rossetti's woodspurge, not in a biographical rural scene, but in Gerard's Herball. Several other sources, well known to Rossetti, bear upon this poem. Although the speaker does not declare the reason for his abandoned attitude until the last stanza, the effective description of that posture suggests itself as a symbolic representation of grief. Such a repre-</page><page sequence="14">32 / VICTORIAN POETRY sentation Rossetti could have recalled from one of the favorite books of his boyhood, the Iconologia (i 819-21) of his father's friend Filippo Pistrucci, a book referred to by William Michael as a "series [of] coloured allegorical designs."40 Pistrucci's two-volume catalog of figured abstrac- tions, including personifications of the major vices, virtues, emotions, is accompanied by an Italian text (and subsequent French translation) de- tailing the significance of each design with regard to its appearance and posture. This concerted fleshing-out of abstraction must have made a considerable impact on Rossetti, and most likely contributed to the alle- gorical mode of his later work. The larger part of Pistrucci's figures, owing to the gender of Italian abstract nouns, are feminine, a fact not without interest when we consider the allegorical importance of the many female figures in The House of Life and other of Rossetti's works. However, the figure of lamentation - Pianto - is that of a young man, dressed in black, kneeling with his head bowed and his hair falling forward. The text tells us that the youth's dress signifies heavy bereavement such as we experi- ence in the death of our parents or those dearest to us.41 What is perhaps rather more significant is that the youth is shown kneeling among scat- tered thorns which represent the pain of his affliction. The word for "thorn" given in the text - spina - is, compared to its English counter- part, employed more directly in Italian as a synonym for torment, aching pain, sorrow, grief, or difficulty. Pistrucci's emblem of the thorns func- tions in much the same way, though to different purpose, as Rossetti 's emblem of the woodspurge. Moreover, considering the symbolic and re- bus-like status of the woodspurge plant, one can not help wondering if the near homophonic pun of Pianto/Pianta underlies both this picture and Rossetti's remembrance of it.42 This association of plants and grief underlies another poem by one of Rossetti's major poetic precursors. Browning's short poem "May and Death," first published in The Keepsake for 1857, and later in Dramatis Personae (1864), bears a strong resemblance to Rossetti's "The Woodspurge."43 While the poem does not involve the same kind of sym- bolic play on a given name, it does use the image of a specific plant to express the speaker's grief for the death of a close friend the previous May, a death often identified with that of Browning's much-loved cousin John Silverthorne in 1852. Like Rossetti's lyric, the poem is, superficially, simple, its language direct and straightforward, and the speaker's laconicism, expressed in his final eloquent "that's all," rhetorically effec- tive in expressing the sorrow he is unable to articulate. The poem also shares with Rossetti's the phenomenon of a sharpening focus, as the speaker, dismissing more extravagant gestures of grief, comes to concen- trate on the plant, familiar to him from happier springs gone by, but</page><page sequence="15">CATHER/NE MAXWELL / 33 whose blood-like markings are now the emblem of a heart-wounding loss. Browning's plant is said to be the spotted persicaria, a plant which, in legend, derives its markings from Christ's blood as it dripped from the cross, but the poem does not call on this specifically Christian associa- tion. Rather, the reference to the marks as "spring's blood" makes the as- sociation seem pagan, suggesting vegetation myth, or the mythological story of Hyacinthus, killed in a discus game and mourned by his friend Apollo. In Ovid's account, the boy's blood stains the flower afterwards known as the hyacinth, its petals henceforth marked with the letters "AI AI" signifying Apollo's cries of grief.44 Whether Browning showed Rossetti his poem prior to the composi- tion of "The Woodspurge" is not known. William Michael Rossetti was unsure about the ascription of the year 1856 to his brother's poem, which could have been written later (though not earlier if the connection with Modern Painters HI is to hold). Certainly the poets were on good terms with each other at this time and in regular correspondence. It does not seem very likely that Rossetti, reserved about his poetry in the 1850s, would have showed Browning his poem first. We do, however, know what he thought of Browning's poem, which was included in his friend Wil- liam Allingham's verse anthology Nightingale Valley (1859). A letter to Allingham, thanking him for a copy of the volume, takes him to task for certain selections. Of "May and Death," Rossetti comments drily, "not B.'s best."45 Whichever piece is prior, Rossetti may have found Browning's poem somewhat too close for comfort. While "May and Death" could be a fortuitous parallel, Browning's habit of associating flowers, names, and emotions, a tendency well illus- trated in the the early "Garden Fancy: The Flower's Name" (1844), prob- ably was influential, and it is hard not to be struck by the moment in Sordelfo (1840) where Eglamor is supplanted by his poetic rival. In his grief, he dies, and Sordello prays over the grave that the dead man's fame continue: Nor the prayer quite fruitless fell. A plant they have, yielding a three-leaved bell Which whitens at trie heart ere noon, and ails Till evening; evening gives it to her gales To clear away with such forgotten things As are an eyesore to the morn: this brings Him to their mind, and bears his very name. (1:182) The "three-leaved bell" again reminds us of the woodspurge, but lacks the Trinitarian resonance of "three cups in one" or "cup of three," which is Rossetti's own addition. Interestingly, the "three-leaved bell" is an em- blem that names a dead and conquered poetic rival, just as, in one of its guises, the woodspurge refers to Wordsworth. But if this reminiscence of</page><page sequence="16">34 / VICTOR/AN POETRY Sordello recalls its author, then it may also signify the audacious burial of Browning, Rossetti's closest and most threatening poetic rival. The third text, also mentioned by William Michael as a childhood favorite of Rossetti's, is Francesco Colonna's dream fable, the Poliphili Hypnerotomachia, printed by Aldus in 1499, one of the most prized of Re* naissance incunabulae, and famous for its beautiful woodcuts.46 Colonna's extraordinary macaronic Italian text tells the story of Poliphilus, who af- flicted by the pangs of love, falls into a dream-vision, in which he cata- logs many strange sights - famous antiquities and buildings, fabulous in- teriors, gardens, and pastoral scenes. He meets a succession of female figures including the five Senses, and eventually, Polia, whom he recog- nizes as the lady of his affections. The couple watch a series of triumphal processions, are united in a ceremony in the Temple of Venus, and are taken by Cupid to the isle of Cytherea, where Polia relates the story of their thwarted love. But the theme of thwarted love continues, for when the lovers are finally alone, Polia vanishes even as they embrace, and so Poliphilus wakes from his dream. Colonna's book is renowned for its pic- tured hieroglyphics and for certain of its illustrations, both of which pre- figure the later development of the emblem. An early moment in this tale has a bearing on Rossetti's poem; the hero, Poliphilus, grief-stricken and weary, seeks repose under an oak tree standing in the middle of a spacious grassy plain: Finalmente per tanta lassitudine correpto, . . . exposimi accumbere sopra le rorate herbe. Sopra el sinistro lato cessabondo, iacente, atreheua cum attenuati spiriti le fresche aure, piu assiduamente cum le crespe labra. He wonders in despair, Vmedun che, oue potrei io quiui trasi diuerse herba ritrouare la Mercuriale Moly, cum la nigra radice per aiuto, &amp;. mio medicamento? . . . per ultimo refrigerio prehendaua ie humide foglie rorulente, sotto la frondosa quercia riseruate, &amp; quelle porgere alii pallidi &amp; aspri labri, cum ingurgitissima auiditate, dingluuie lambendole assucare, &amp; la siticulosa uuea refrigerare alquanto.47 Several details - the hero's prostrated grief, his weary lips, his naming of a symbolic plant and his looking to the herbs for last-resort refreshment or succor, details told in an extravagant gestural way in Colonna's text - are purged into a simpler form in Rossetti's poem. Colonna's dream-narrative with its Beatrice figure has an obvious precursor in Dante's Commedia, the third and final Italian text for this poem, whose presence is hinted at in the title of this essay. Dante Gabriel's own name, his signature, which would be the poem's subscrip- tion, is, of course, in part that of the poet he was named for by his fa- ther.48 If Rossetti is, as I believe, saturated in a markedly Catholic, Ital- ian-influenced, emblematic and allegorical tradition, it does not seem surprising that Dante should also figure in the text in the overdetermined</page><page sequence="17">CATHERINE MAXWELL / 35 symbol of the spurge, which recalls the title of the second book of the Commedia - Purgatorio. Dante's Purgatory is quel secondo regno I dove I'umano spirito si purga, I e di salire al del diventa degno and, consequently, a place of cleansing, regeneration, and conversion.49 Dante's protagonist, rescued from the dark wood of sin and error, embarks on a moral journey, through Hell, then Purgatory, where the sins of those not damned must necessarily be cleansed, before the final ascent to the Beatific Vision of Paradise. In this Dantean sense, "woodspurge" can function as another name for Purgatory.50 Rossetti's poem, central to his oeuvre, is also a place of purging, a place where he attempts to wipe out the sins of his poetic fathers or to convert them into something else. "The Woodspurge" is a conversion poem, marking a move from one phase of Rossetti's writ- ing into another, and rather than demonstrating a submission to Ruskin's Evangelical aesthetics, it subtly converts Ruskin's argument into a Catholic register. The sonnet "St. Luke the Painter" tells how the "devious symbols" of early Christian art gave way to a natural symbolism, but "The Woodspurge" shows how, once we talk of symbols, the natural is perme- ated by the iconographic and cannot be anything other than devious. Consequently, this innocent-seeming poem is the most devious of Rossetti's works. "Devious" also connotes a circuitous route, not unlike the one I have been forced to take, but true to the questing pattern of symbolic narrative. Thus the poem's unromantic wisdom is that Rossetti's readers will not "see . . . Heaven in a wild flower" without experiencing his Purgatory first, just as they will not make it out of the woods if they cling to notions of innocence.

"Years later, when I came to know Rossetti personally, I perceived that the writer of the article had not made a bad shot for the truth.

For the earliest known manuscript version, see Riede, p. 40. 22 That Ruskin sees the interventions of the Pre-Raphaelites as a purifying of the corruptions of modern secularized art is evident: "Whether or not Christianity be the purer for lacking the service of art, is disputable - and I do not mean now to begin the dispute; but that art is the impurer for not being in the service of Christianity, is indisputable, and that is the main point I have now to do with." "Pre-Raphaelitism," (1853) in the Library edition of Ruskin's Works, ed. E. T. Cook and Alexander Wedderburn (London, 1903*1 2), 12:143. The sonnet also evokes Ruskin through the controversial figure of Wordsworth. Each volume of Ruskin's Modern Painters is prefaced by the same long epigraph from Wordsworth's Excursion. It is the latter part of this epigraph that Rossetti's sestet recollects in its mention of Art turning in vain to "soulless self' reflections of man's skill" (cf. The Excursion 4.987-992: "Philosophers, who . . . prize / This soul, and the transcendent universe, / No more than as a mirror that reflects / To proud Self-love her own intelligence," Poetical Works, p. 637). The allusion thus serves as a subtitle for Modern Painters rather than a reference to Wordsworth in his own right. The Ruskin- Wordsworth relation is complex in its evolution and is comprehensively discussed by Elizabeth Helsinger in Ruskin and the Art of the Beholder (Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1982), pp. 44-60. 23 English emblem books are almost solely derived or adapted from Catholic continental sources. We might reflect on what has been called "the failure of the emblem in England," a failure due to the fact that "the spiritual and the invisible are almost synonymous in the dualist vocabulary of the English Protestant imagination," and thus "the iconoclastic distaste of the English imagination for images of the invisible."

Ruskin acts as patron and counselor to the younger man, offering advice and suggestions about painting, commissioning drawings and offering financial assistance to both Rossetti and his fiancee, Elizabeth Siddal. The introduction to Ruskin's Works, 36. xliii-li, gives a full and lively description of the relationship.</page><page sequence="20">38 / VICTORIAN POETRY 25 Works, 33:288. It can be surmised that as Ruskin's faith in God diminished, the stress on materiality became more important. 26 George P. Landow, The Aesthetic and Critical Theories of John Ruskin (Princeton, 1971), p. 254. 27 Landow, pp. 255*256: "The artist who had to portray the naked body must emphasize color, the element of emotion and spirituality, at the expense of qualities which might suggest flesh. . . . Flesh must be purified ... or as Ruskin says 'redeemed' - 'by severity of form and hardness of line' (4.196)." 28 Rossetti's "sacramental" view of the body and sexuality may also be supplemented by the thought of Blake, whom he admired. In spite of his radical Protestantism, Blake validates the senses, body, and sexuality, but only by deciding that they are a kind of subset of the soul, as in "Man has no Body distinct from his Soul; for that call'd Body is a portion of Soul" ("The Marriage of Heaven and Hell," The Complete Writings of William Blake, ed. Geoffrey Keynes [London, 1966], p. 149). This is not so much a combination of spiritual and sensual as the absorption and redemption of the physical by the transcendent imagination. For "Mortal &amp;. Perishing Nature," Blake had the profoundest contempt. Notably, when Rossetti uses Blake's statement on body and soul in the fifth sonnet of The House of Life, he returns it to a sacramental meaning: "Lady, I fain would tell how evermore / Thy soul I know not from thy body, nor / Thee from myself, neither our love from God" (The Works of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, p. 76). 29 George L. Hersey, "Ruskin as Optical Thinker," in The Ruskin Polygon: Essays on the Imagination of John Ruskin, ed. John Dixon Hunt and Faith M. Holland (Manchester, 1982), p. 56. Hersey cites Works, 3:427 as evidence. 30 Letters, 1:286. That he finished it fairly swiftly is obvious by the fact that Modern Painters IV was published on April 14, and on a Friday in the latter half of April we find Rossetti reporting to Allingham on Ruskin's treatment of Longfellow and Browning (Letters, pp. 299*300). 31 "All violent feelings have the same effect. They produce in us a falseness in all our impressions of external things, which I would generally characterize as the 'pathetic fallacy'" (Works, 5:205). 32 Works, 5:209. Wordsworth's "first power" in the Preface to his 181 5 Poems is the accurate description and observation of "things as they are . . . unmodified by any passion or feeling existing in the mind of the describer" (Poetical Works, p. 752). However, Helsinger notes (p. 52), that Wordsworth goes on to say: "This power, though indispensable to a Poet, is one which he employs in submission to necessity, and never for a continuance of time: as its exercise supposes all the higher qualities of the mind to be passive, and in a state of subjection to external objects, much in the same way as a translator or engraver ought to be to his original." The passage on the pathetic fallacy represents Ruskin correcting Wordsworth through a restressing of Wordsworth's own thought and words. Carol Christ (p. 46) quotes lines from Wordsworth's Peter Bell to reveal the original of Ruskin's primrose - "A primrose by a river's brim / A yellow primrose was to him / And it was nothing more" - and this, too, is also a correction, as Wordsworth originally intended these lines to denote his protagonist's "moral insensitivity."</page><page sequence="21">CATHERINE MAXWELL / 39 33 Dante Gabriel Rossetti: Classified Lists of His Writings with the Dates, ed.

Rossetti includes "The Woodspurge"' with the other songs that accompany the sonnets of The House of Life, his own heavily symbolic Dantean pilgrimage, which, as the context assigned to this lyric, should also color its reading.</page></plain_text>
