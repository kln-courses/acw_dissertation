<plain_text><page sequence="1">Horse Stories: Perverse Victimization Natalie Corinne Hansen This paper examines the domestication of human and nonhuman bodies in Anna Sewell's Black Beauty, his Grooms and Companions: The Autobiography of a Horse, considering how moral discourses are narrated through sentimental fiction and melodrama. The didactic narra tive of Black Beauty offers a "humanizing" tale, an instructional discourse meantto guide individual self-improvement?in this case, improvement in the behavior of master toward servant, human or nonhuman. There is a tension in Black Beauty between its call for change and the narrative's grounding in liberal humanist values, which uphold social and species hierarchies. While addressing inequalities and unjust treatment for disad vantaged groups, Black Beauty remains circumscribed within the onto logical differences upon which these inequalities and injustices are based. This paper traces how the sentimental and melodramatic narrative of Black Beauty appeals to readers, positioning humans as actors in redemption stories that enforce economic, social, and political relation ships of privilege among humans and human dominion over nonhuman beings. I argue that this same sentimentality and itsontological implications characterize many contemporary animal rights and animal welfare dis courses, which, while working to ameliorate the often inhumane conditions under which animals live in contemporary industrialized societies, remain grounded in a humanist model of species difference and a hierarchical logic of relationality that perpetuates social inequalities. Given the dramatic differences in the presence of horses in peoples' lives between the nineteenth and the twenty-first centuries, the question of Black Beauty's ongoing appeal to contemporary readers merits inquiry. One way that Black Beauty moves beyond its nineteenth-century jac 30.3-4(2010)</page><page sequence="2">728 jac context is its foregrounding of "humane" behavior, the basic sympathies the novel argues that lie within each human subject. In contemporary usage, "humane" refers to an understanding of and generosity toward others: "characterized by sympathy with and consideration for the needs and distresses of others; feeling or showing compassion and tenderness toward human beings and the lower animals; kind, benevolent" ("Hu mane" OED Online). Black Beauty's didactic message is intended "to evoke or promote these [humane] qualities," with the intent of having a "refining; civilizing" effect on its readers ("Humane" American Heritage Dictionary 640). As Susan Chitty points out, "Black Beauty was not originally intended for children. It was aimed at... the simple working folk, for it was these who were in daily contact with horses" (214). For these simple working folk, "refining" and "civilizing," in the context of human izing practices, are synonymous with a certain type of domestication. Black Beauty also addresses members of the upper class who employ horses and the simple working folk who care for them, drawing its critique across class lines by appealing to masters to include in their civil responsibilities the wellbeing of their domestic servants, both equine and human. Moral campaigns of the nineteenth century were influenced by the "culture of sensibility," a social phenomenon dating to the end of the seventeenth century that stressed feelings based on sensory experience as the foundation for moral values and behaviors (Barker-Benfield xx). The culture of sensibility emerged during a time of improving economic conditions, the rise of the middle class, urban growth, industrialization, colonial expansion, and the development of a culture of consumption (Barker-Benfield xx; also see Thomas). Alongside these developments was a new interest in leisure activities and refinement, both of which functioned to differentiate the emergent middle class from the lower working classes. The culture of sensibility emphasized compassion for and empathic connection with the sufferings of others, sentiments that played an important role in shaping new sympathies for nonhuman beings. The moral and didactic discourses that characterize sentimental fiction parallel a narrative form, melodrama, which first emerged in stage plays during the middle of the nineteenth century. Linda Williams explains that melodrama involves a narrative of leaving home and experiencing the</page><page sequence="3">Natalie Corinne Hansen 729 trials of life, including a happy ending that recapitulates an originary pastoral setting of "freedom and innocence" associated with "home," a home that is, if not the actual place of home, then the return to a similar sentiment associated with home (28). The melodramatic recapitulation and return to home is a precise description of the plot sequence of Black Beauty. Williams argues that melodrama is a particularly modern form but a form that has generally been dismissed in critical studies of literature as standing outside of the norms of "classical and neoclassical stricture of good taste and high art," particularly because of its dramatic manipulation of sentiment (6). Black Beauty links the sentimental and melodramatic as it delineates moral values through emotional appeal: "If emotional and moral registers are sounded, if a work invites us to feel sympathy for the virtues of beset victims, if the narrative trajectory is ultimately concerned with a retrieval and staging of virtue through adversity and suffering, then the operative mode is melodrama" (15). The ongoing appeal of Black Beauty's sentimental, didactic, melodra matic narrative reflects how the characters and their stories are "meaning making figures that gather up those who respond to them into unpredict able kinds of 'we'" (Haraway 5). The novel's gathering together of respondents had immediate and important results for the wellbeing of horses in England, Europe, and America at the end of the nineteenth century. The novel has continued its work of gathering across the twentieth century, during which time it was adopted as achildren's classic. Drawing on Donna Haraway's suggestion that "Figures are not represen tations or didactic illustrations, but rather material-semiotic nodes or knots in which diverse bodies and meanings coshape one another" (4), this paper examines the various ways Black Beauty has been read analogically and asks how the horses as figures exceed analogical containment. Domestic Servants In nineteenth-century Britain, horses were hard workers in rural and urban settings and worked as well as figures "upon which the imperatives and anxieties of dominant gender and class ideologies are articulated and displaced" (Dorre 6).1 The representational function of horses in nine</page><page sequence="4">730 jac teenth-century Britain reflects internal and external shifts in national and individual experiences: [H]orse discourses communicate and negotiate apprehensions regarding such things as industrialism and technology; construc tions of masculinity, femininity, and sexuality; ruptures in the social fabric caused by class conflict and mobility; the crisis of aesthetics amid a culture of mass production and consumption; and the heady but uncertain energies of national progress and imperial expansion. (Dorr66) One understanding of why the figurative work of letting human-animal relationships stand in for class differences is appealing is insofar as this figurative distancing functions to redirect anxieties about inequalities among humans and to naturalize narratives of difference. Coral Landsbury argues that using animal characters masks class prejudices: "if the story was told about and by animals, then the questions of reward and punishment could be defined in terms of sufficient oats, a dry bed, and a comfortable harness?surely all that anyone could possibly ask for when writing about the working class" (68). Conditions of equine labor easily map onto language used to describe conditions of human labor: "The language of horses and the dialogue of the stable became an accepted mode for relating the concerns of workers" (68). In this reading, the character of Black Beauty represents an ideal of nobility or virtue but a domesticated nobility and virtue, contained within secure demarcations of class, gender, and species difference: "When a working man was seen as a horse, all the metaphysics of self could be safely comprehended within the confines of the stable_These horsey dialogues became an approved means of inculcating docility in workers and in assertive women" (69). In functioning as a discourse about distinctions of social class and the responsibilities of masters to servants, both human and nonhuman, Black Beauty upholds existing class hierarchies, justifying social and economic inequalities among humans and enforcing human dominion over nonhuman animals. Nonetheless, in its ethic of shared suffering and its advocacy of moral sensibility, the novel nudges against the boundaries of class and species, in this way functioning as a powerful tool in early animal rights discourses.</page><page sequence="5">Natalie Corinne Hansen 731 From the perspective of a twenty-first century American reader, the analogies between domestic animals and human slaves are everywhere evident in Black Beauty. Echoes of slavery exist in the situation of domestic servants as a class in this novel. The parallels begin with Black Beauty's early life, his birth on a farm (a plantation or estate), his initial name "Blackie," and his separation from his mother and sale to an aristocratic estate for "service" to a "master." Beauty's mother, Duchess (an aristocrat among horses), is used to produce offspring to sell as domestic servants.2 The one mention of Beauty's father states that he "has a great name in these parts" and is thus sought as a sire (Sewell 20). His absence echoes the practice of slave owners' selectively breeding their female slaves or impregnating them, a reading alluded to given the farmer's familiar name for Duchess, "Pet," a term of endearment and a signifier of ownership. As Hortense Spillers notes, controlling the genealo gies of slaves was a key mechanism of maintaining patriarchal power: "Certainly if 'kinship' were possible, the property relations would be undermined, since the offspring would then 'belong' to a mother and a father" (75). Keeping relations of ownership "within the family," so to speak, controlling breeding practices and genealogies displaces any claim to offspring by parties other than the master. Having been born into a servant class of beings, Black Beauty is acculturated by his mother into the proper type of behavior toward a master?willing obedience?an attitude that was applicable not only to (nonhuman) animal servants but to human servants, as well as to wives and daughters. The name "Black Beauty" itself conjures images of enslavement and feminized objectification of the body, both conditions of domestication. The narrative promotes a certain conceptualization of domesticity and domestic service that fits into the culture of sensibility's idealization of the nurturing maternal. The opening chapters of the book suggest that the good care and handling Black Beauty received in his early life shaped his personality, forming him as a willing servant to his human masters. This social role is introduced by Beauty's mother and is one he retains throughout the novel: "She told me the better I behaved, the better I should be treated, and that it was wisest always to do my best to please my master" (34). During the first section of the novel, covering his birth and his work at the estate of Birtwick, Beauty has kind owners and gentle</page><page sequence="6">732 jac handlers. It is in the second section of the novel, as Beauty experiences the injustices of maltreatment, that he recalls his mother's wisdom, remembering her warning that "there are many kinds of men; there are good, thoughtful men like our master, that any horse may be proud to serve; but there are bad cruel men, who never ought to have a horse or a dog to call their own. Besides, there are a great many foolish men, vain, ignorant, and careless, who never trouble themselves to think" (36). The most favorably described horseman in the novel is John Manly, the groom at the estate of Birtwick, Beauty's second home.3 John's last name can be read as an overt message about the value of a gentle or sentimental "manliness," given his "feminine" or feminized behavior with horses. Manly is even successful with Ginger, the difficult (spicy!) mare who, as he jokes, fell subject to the influence of "Birtwick horse-balls": This was a little joke of John's; he used to say that a regular course of the Birtwick horse-balls would cure almost any vicious horse; these balls, he said, were made up of patience and gentleness, firmness and petting, one pound of each to be mixed up with half a pint of common sense, and given to the horse every day. (65) The values of care here are represented as feminine, idealizing a certain version of maternal behavior: firm yet gentle handling of those creatures whose proper behavior requires guidance and shaping, an equation of horses with children, slaves, and domestic servants. John' s care and love for horses includes his attention to their grooming, mimicking the refinement of taste valued in sentimental fiction, and his intuitive (that is, non-rational and thus sentimental and common-sense) communication and understanding of their feelings: John seemed very proud of me; he used to make my mane and tail almost as smooth as a lady's hair, and he would talk to me a great deal; of course I did not understand all he said, but I learned more and more to know what he meant, and what he wanted me to do. I grew very fond of him, he was so gentle and kind, he seemed to know just how a horse feels. (46) Like children, slaves, and domestic servants, Beauty here may not understand John's verbal communications, but he does understand the</page><page sequence="7">Natalie Corinne Hansen 733 sentiment behind them. John gives voice to the moral attitude and behavior that Sewell champions: "He thought people did not value their animals half enough, nor make friends of them as they ought to do" (90). John's example of the good domestic servant imbued with sentimental values reflects expectations for proper domestic behavior, for servants (human and nonhuman) and for men and women more generally. John's own personal story constitutes a chapter of the novel and furthers the idea that good upbringing fosters sensitivity, sensibility, and a strong work ethic. John tells of being orphaned at an early age, left to care for his "crippled sister Nelly" (119). Taken in as a worker by a kind farmer, whose wife assumes responsibility for Nelly, John was apprenticed to an experienced older coachman who took great care to train John properly. John, like Beauty, is represented as lucky in his early experiences with kind and gentle masters who trained him well. The network of generosity here includes the farmer, his wife, and the coachman. John in his turn takes on a young boy to train, in full faith of the positive outcomes of such generosity. (This boy, Little Joe Green, will return at the end of the novel.) When asked about his work ethic, John refutes the popular saying that "Everybody look after himself, and take care of number one," arguing it is "a selfish, heathenish saying" (120). The Christian ideals of good works, community, and service, to which the religious Sewell subscribed, are clearly at play here, and, when the household of Birtwick breaks up, due to the illness of the "mistress" of the estate, John sets off to work as a horse trainer in order to give more young horses the good start (that is, training in domestic servitude) that he feels they deserve (141-^42). Notably, this leave-taking is also the beginning of Beauty's own sufferings. Throughout Part One of the novel, Beauty has had to suffer what all horses must in order to be in service to humans?"breaking in" to harness and saddle, physical confinement and control of his movements, separation from family and an existing social network, exposure to man-made frights such as locomotives. Beauty hears about some of the horrors that his equine companions have gone through in their work for humans, including the stories of Merrylegs and Sir Oliver. Merrylegs is a mostly compliant pony who, when subject to the tortures of young boys, takes the initiative of throwing the boys when they get out of hand: "I have only been giving those young people a lesson, they did not know when they had had enough,</page><page sequence="8">734 jac nor when I had had enough, so I just pitched them off backward, that was the only thing they could understand" (66-67). Merrylegs stands in for the benign schoolmaster, who uses physical admonishments to discipline unruly boys. In contrast to the female children in this novel, represented as gentle beings by nature, boys, as Merrylegs explains, "are quite different; they must be broken in, as we were broken in when we were colts, and just be taught what's what" (67). Merrylegs takes his respon sibilities seriously, noting that "those children are under my charge when they are riding; I tell you they are entrusted to me," and he uses his best judgment in evaluating the care and education he can offer each child (70). Sir Oliver, whose distinctive feature is his bobbed tail, describes his experience of being thus maimed and disfigured after Beauty has asked about the accident in which he had lost his tail: "Accident!" he snorted, with a fierce look. "It was no accident! It was a cruel, shameful, cold-blooded act! When I was young I was taken to a place where these cruel things were done; I was tied up, and made fast so that I could not stir, and then they came up and cut off my long beautiful tail, through the flesh, and through the bone, and took it away." (74) Although during Beauty's lifetime horses' tails were no longer regularly bobbed, Sir Oliver describes how similar practices continue as people dock dogs' tails and cut their ears. In a Swiftian moment, Sir Oliver asks, "'Why don't they [the humans] cut their own children's ears into points to make them look sharp? Why don't they cut the end off their noses to make them look plucky? One would be just as sensible as the other'" (76). A longer story within Black Beauty traces the life and sufferings of Ginger. While the character of Black Beauty in all his various exploits stands in for the subjugated body of the noble servant, the character Ginger, whom Beauty meets at his second home, links the physical and psychological constraints on horses' and on women's bodies. The analogy between horse body and woman's body is most clearly made in Sewell's attack on the use of the bearing rein, which was a means of controlling the horse's "head set" by forcing the horse to hold his or her head unnaturally high, the only purpose for which was fashion and aristocratic display, although it was sometimes justified as making horses more controllable.4</page><page sequence="9">Natalie Corinne Hansen 735 Sewell' s attention to the bearing rein reflects awareness of and resistance to the injustice of senseless torments in the name of fashion, critiquing the vanity that motivates such practices. Focus on the bearing rein may also reflect SewelPs identification with forms of bodily control that women were subject to during the nineteenth century.5 Critiquing the use of the bearing rein on horses could be a way of critiquing the arbitrary and controlling dictates of fashion for human females. Coral Landsbury suggests that employing the voice of the horse in Black Beauty allows Sewell to articulate her own experiences of subjection, to manifest these in the bodies of suffering horses, which allowed a certain narrative freedom: "Possibly because the persona chosen was not human, Anna Sewell felt free to speak her mind and feelings in ways that would have been consciously censored had she written as a woman" (Landsbury 98). When Ginger and Beauty meet, Beauty had thus far been spared wearing the bearing rein. Ginger enlightens him to its tortures: "I like to toss my head about, and hold it as high as any horse; but fancy now yourself, if you tossed your head up high and were obligated to hold it there, and that for hours together, not able to move it at all, except with a jerk still higher, your neck aching till you did not know how to bear it" (64-65). Ginger resists the bodily constraints of this late-nineteenth-century fashion. She is unwilling to forfeit the health and integrity of her body to create a pleasing visual spectacle for humans. Ginger explains to Beauty that if she had had his gentle upbringing, she "might have been of as good a temper" as he is (53). However, in the chapters describing Ginger's life, she narrates a series of traumatic encounters with humans, beginning with her "breaking in." This first contact she had with men reads as a scene of domination, or, as Landsbury argues, as a gang rape (106): [W]hen it came to breaking in, that was a bad time for me; several men came to catch me, and when at last they closed me in at one corner of the field, one caught me by the forelock, another caught me by the nose, and held it so tight I could hardly draw my breath; then another took my under jaw in his hard hand and wrenched my mouth open, and so by force they got on the halter, and the bar into my mouth; then one dragged me along by the halter, another flogging behind, and this was the first experience I had of men's kindness, it was all force; they did not give me a chance to know what they wanted. (Sewell 54-55)</page><page sequence="10">736 jac According to Landsbury, this scene mimics scenarios popular in Victorian pornography. Moreover, it exemplifies the practice of wife bridling: "From the sixteenth to the nineteenth century, a nagging woman might be punished by having the scold's bridle, an iron noose, slipped over her head. The bit held down her tongue, and the noose often had a chain and ring attached so that the woman could be led about like ahorse" (Dorre 10; also see Thomas 44-45). Connecting the bodies of horses and of women is "a feminine ideal of docility, duty, and acquiescence. Furthermore, the horse's physicality and animality?those aspects requiring control and domination?were often associated with women" (Dorre 10). Dorre argues for a certain subversive reading of Black Beauty : "Sewell enacts a double displacement of the self in terms of both species and sex and appropriates Beauty's body in order to address issues of physical as well as psychological abjection. Her authority, therefore, becomes a source of empowerment and subversion" (108). Ginger suggests that her human tormentors failed to give her "a chance to know what they wanted." They fail to consider her as a sensitive, responsive and communicative individual. As she explains about one unkind groom in her past, "If he had been civil, I would have tried to bear it. I was willing to work, and ready to work hard too; but to be tormented for nothing but their fancies angered me. What right had they to make me suffer like that?" (61-62). Ginger, with her keen sense of right and wrong, argues for just and humane treatment. Having had repeated experiences of cruel treatment at the hands of grooms, she explains to Beauty, "I had then made up my mind that men were my natural enemies, and that I must defend myself (63-64). Ginger is the novel's exemplar of how inhumane treatment renders otherwise potentially willing servants rebellious and (self)destructive, a cycle of abuse and resistance that is self-perpetuating. Ginger's absolute refusal to tolerate the bearing rein leads to further mistreatment and overuse, to her being sold to uncaring owners, and to her premature death. Her last meeting with Beauty, at a London cabstand, marks her descent among the ranks and the ravaged state of her body and soul. Beauty barely recognizes her: It was Ginger! But how changed! The beautifully arched and glossy neck was now straight, and lank, and fallen in, the clean straight legs</page><page sequence="11">Natalie Corinne Hansen 737 and delicate fetlocks were swelled; the joints were grown out of shape with hard work; the face, that was once so fall of spirit and life, was now fall of suffering, and I could tell by the heaving of her sides, and her frequent cough, how bad her breath was. (279) Beauty wonders what happened to her unyielding intolerance of unjust treatment: "You used to stand up for yourself if you were ill-used" (280). Ginger's reply marks perhaps Sewell's most overt statement in the novel of the sense of despair and helplessness of oppressed animals (human and nonhuman): I did once [stand up for myself], but it's no use; men are strongest, and if they are cruel and have no feeling, there is nothing that we can do, but just bear it, bear it on and on to the end. I wish the end was come, I wish I was dead. I have seen dead horses, and I am sure they do not suffer pain. I wish I may drop down dead at my work, and not be sent off to the knacker's. (280) Ginger's resistance is in vain, no match for human cruelty and technologies of control. Shortly thereafter, Beauty sees Ginger, dead, being carted away. Ginger's story stands in contrast to Beauty' s. Although both horses are subject to cruel and inconsiderate treatment, didactically, placing Ginger's story within Beauty's narrative paints two different portraits of domestic servitude, with Beauty, well-breed, well-raised, humanely treated as a youth, exemplifing noble servitude even under duress, surviving to receive his just rewards, while Ginger, lacking such formative and nurturing circumstances, and thus unable to conform to the demands of domestic servitude, suffers from her circumstances and dies a premature and unhappy death. Working Life In Part Two of the novel, Beauty experiences first-hand many of the more severe traumas suffered by horses in service. Upon leaving his second home, Beauty loses his name and is renamed as "Black Auster" by his subsequent owners, reiterating his status as property. The act of naming signifies power over the other: "The captivating party does not only' earn'</page><page sequence="12">738 jac the right to dispose of the captive body as it sees fit, but gains, conse quently, the right to name and 'name' it" (Spillers 69). The sequence of names given to Black Beauty signify his status as object, as transferable property, ownership of which implies the categorical differences through which enslavement of others is naturalized and justified. The traumas Beauty faces in Part Two trace his descent down the social scale, from his original position on an aristocratic estate to lowly cab horse. Each of his experiences in Part Two represents a moral teaching, chronicling the sins of human vanity, drunkenness, ignorance, greed, lying, and sloth. First, Beauty is forced to wear a bearing rein in order to meet the aristocratic fashion for carriage horses?a message about cruelty in the name of vanity. He is then ridden at dangerously high speed over rough and rocky roads by a drunken groom, who "when he was right, there could not be a more faithful or valuable man"?a message about temperance (172). Disfigured by a fall with this groom, Beauty is sold to a rental string and is subject to the random treatment and dangerous inabilities of inexperi enced riders or drivers?a message about ignorance, particularly the ignorance of city dwellers. In other circumstances, Beauty has his feed stolen by a dishonest groom and suffers from hunger and weakness, then he is neglected and lamed by a subsequent groom, who out of laziness neglected all but the appearance of good care?messages about greed, dishonesty, and sloth. Beauty's slide down the scale of care and labor pauses, finally, at the beginning of Part Three, when he is sold at a horse fair to what turns out to be a very kind and humane cab driver, Jerry Barker, with whom Beauty stays for the duration of Part Three. Beauty's treatment while working for Jerry Barker is exemplary, and Jerry is another figure Sewell uses to argue that people of all classes can exhibit moral and virtuous behavior: "I never knew a better man than my new master; he was kind and good, and as strong for the right as John Manly; and so good-tempered and merry that very few people could pick a quarrel with him" (239). Not only is Jerry a considerate horseman, he is a moral actor. He refuses to carry passengers who, due to their own irresponsible actions, want him to rush his horses; however, he goes out of his way to help passengers who needed assistance due to no fault of their own (241, 242-47, 292-96). In Beauty's evaluation, "Jerry was as good a driver as I had ever known; and what was better, he took as much</page><page sequence="13">Natalie Corinne Hansen 739 thought for his horses as he did for himself (227). Jerry also strictly defends his one day off per week, the Sunday Sabbath. When urged by a favorite passenger to be her regular ride to Sunday services, Jerry resists, knowing that for his own good and the well being of his horses, he cannot spare the one day of rest (250-57). He goes so far as to suggest to the drivers who are compelled to work on Sunday that the drivers "all strike for a day of rest," a surprising call for unified labor action (257). Beauty's first stable mate during his tenure with Jerry is Captain, "an old war horse." In Captain's story, Sewell articulates unambiguous anti war sentiments. Captain tells Beauty of his experiences in the Crimean War, and, in particular, his memories of the Charge of the Light Brigade, in which his rider, for whom Captain had great affection, was killed. Captain seems deeply touched by the deaths and horrors that are the result of war, and, when Beauty asks "Do you know what they fought about?" Captain answers "No,.. . that is more than a horse can understand, but the enemy must have been awfully wicked people, if it was right to go all that way over the sea on purpose to kill them" (238). Poor Captain ends up being impaled by the shaft of a brewer' s dray driven recklessly and out of-control by a drunk driver (299-300). This event inspires Jerry to excoriate drunkenness and the destruction it causes: "You can't make compensation?there's all the trouble, and vexation, and loss of time, besides losing a good horse that's like an old friend?it' s nonsense talking of compensation! If there's one devil that I should like to see in the bottomless pit more than another, it' s the drink devil" (3 01). He goes onto urge a companion cab driver to quit drinking, as they agree "'tis apoor thing not to be one's own master" (302). By way of example, he relates his own story of quitting, arguing that any man can do it with the help of God, family, and strong convictions (302). Ultimately, Jerry proves his moral fortitude by choosing the humane option of shooting Captain when it turns out that Captain will be unfit for anything more than the lowest of jobs as a cart horse, a situation that Jerry knows will end with mistreatment and a slow death by starvation and overwork. During his time with Jerry, Beauty also hears the story of Seedy Sam, an impoverished cab driver. Too poor to even own his own horses, he must rent them from a ruthless overlord named Skinner (aptly named given that,</page><page sequence="14">740 jac at the rates he charges, his cab drivers must work their horses until they are skin and bones in order to make ends meet). Seedy Sam comes in for criticism from the other cab drivers for working his horses too hard. Sam reiterates with a long soliloquy detailing to the shilling the financial transactions between Skinner, his passengers, and himself that necessitate his hard use of the horses. In the figure of Sam, Sewell appeals to readers to recognize the inhumane conditions under which such individuals are forced to work. In his defense, she has Sam say "'tis a mockery to tell a man that he must not overwork his horse, for when a beast is downright tired, there's nothing but the whip that will keep his legs agoing?you can't help yourself?you must put your wife and children before the horse, the masters must look to that, we can't. I don't ill-use my horse for the sake of it" (275). Sam articulates a social crisis: If the master does not take care of the working man, the working man cannot take care of his family without sacrificing his horse. Alongside Ginger, about whose end we hear in this section of the novel, Sam is another sad case, dying soon after this conversation from overwork. During the period when Beauty works as a cab-horse, he recognizes that most humans take horse laborers for granted, remarking on a man who makes a point of acknowledging equine labor: "It was a very rare thing for anyone to notice the horse that had been working for him. I have known ladies do it now and then, and this gentleman, and one or two others have given me a pat and a kind word; but ninety-nine out of a hundred would as soon think of patting the steam-engine that drew the train" (268). Here, at the outset of mechanized transportation, the horse's body is relegated to the status of machine in the minds of humans, a technology like others with which they have no intimate, bodily, connection. Revealing her own class bias, Sewell writes critically about "Cockneys," people born in highly urban central London, who have no experience of horses, an ignorance that is reflected in their lack of skill and sympathy when employing equine labor: "They always seemed to think that a horse was something like a steam engine, only smaller. At any rate, they think that if only they pay for it, a horse is bound to go just as far, and just as fast, and with just as heavy a load as they please" (195). These drivers stand in contrast to "gentlemen" "who knew how a good horse ought to be driven" (205). This critique of urban dwellers with no experience of handling horses reflects a nostalgia</page><page sequence="15">Natalie Corinne Hansen 741 for rural life and for connection with animals, particularly in terms of Sewell's idealization of aristocratic paternal relations. Chitty writes, Anna was opposed to the Industrial Revolution and the new era of technology. This was natural in one so attached to the established social order and the ideal of paternalism. Like her mother she deplored the severing of the old ties of master to man which followed upon the herding of the working classes into the manufacturing towns. (209) This nostalgia produces a longing for more circumscribed, more sharply distinguished social boundaries, which are perhaps more clear in their moral dictates. Sewell uses the visceral appeal of the victimized horse body to demonstrate the alienation she finds to be the result of urbanization and industrialization, an argument heard today in discussions of twenty first century alienation from the body and the environment and the appeal of animal companions. Part Four of the novel begins with Beauty being sold again, as Jerry Barker falls ill from waiting at the cab stand for long hours in poor weather and must change his line of work. Although Jerry finds Beauty a position in which he thinks Beauty will receive good treatment, Beauty suffers at the hands of an inconsiderate and greedy driver who overworks him, weakening him so much that he becomes unusable for heavy work and must be sold again. Beauty ends up at the bottom of the equine hierarchy, as one of Skinner's for-hire cab horses. Of this experience, Beauty says, "I have heard men say that seeing is believing; but I should say that feeling is believing; for much as I had seen before, I never knew till now the utter misery of a cab horse's life" (325).6 Finally, the end of Beauty's trials comes when he is overwhelmed by an overly heavy load of passengers and baggage. Notably, the female child in this family appeals to her father to hire another cab to share the load: "'Papa,' she said, CI am sure this poor horse cannot take us and all our luggage so far, he is so very weak and worn out; do look at him'" (327). Her pleas are to no avail, and Beauty does his best: "The load was very heavy, and I had had neither food nor rest since the morning; but I did my best, as I always had done, in spite of cruelty and injustice" (328). The result is that at a steep hill Beauty, straining under the lash of the cabdriver' s whip, falls to the ground: "I lay perfectly still; indeed,</page><page sequence="16">742 jac I had no power to move, and I thought now I was goingto die" (329). With kind members of the public to help him, Beauty does manage to rise, but his usefulness as a workhorse is over, and, it seems, he is destined for the "knacker's," for slaughter. However, a farrier (at the time farriers acted as veterinarians as well as taking care of horses' hooves) argues that it is worth trying to sell him at an upcoming sale. Beauty is then bought by Farmer Thoroughgood at the urging of his grandson, Willie, who argues, "I am sure he would grow young in our meadows" (335). Thoroughgood, whose name signals his moral fortitude, rehabilitates Beauty with gentle care and kind handling, continuing the legacy of John Manly and Jerry Barker, offering Willie the lesson that the qualities that Beauty had learned as a youngster from his mother, to work hard for all masters, confirmed by the good handling Beauty had at an early age, are enduring ones. The final few chapters reconfirm the idea that honorable, virtuous service in the face of injustice and cruelty should be rewarded with fair and moral treatment. In the concluding chapter, "My Last Home," Black Beauty describes his final home, which Thoroughgood finds for him, where he is taken in by a trio of sisters, the Misses Blomefields (another evocative name), who seem to be the daughters of the Vicar Blomefield who served near Beauty's early home at Birtwick. Their gentle groom is none other than an older Little Joe Green, who recognizes Beauty and restores him his name. Beauty's contentment is complete: "My ladies have promised that I shall never be sold, and so I have nothing to fear; and here my story ends. My troubles are all over, and lam at home; and often before I am quite awake, I fancy I am still in the orchard at Birtwick, standing with my old friends under the apple trees" (345-46). This ending allows Beauty to complete the circle of domestic servitude, returning to the idyll of rural retirement in a setting in which women are the gentle masters. In this conclusion, Beauty is rewarded with the treatment he deserves in Sewell's moral order, after a full life of faithful service. There is a certain irony in this happy ending, which, in contrast with the novel's overall message, works to ameliorate the traumas of Beauty's years of service. Instead of arguing against the use of horses as domestic servants, the novel clearly assumes that this is their proper role, but that human failings subject horse laborers to unfair treatment and suffering. How to understand the conservative message that the book ultimately</page><page sequence="17">Natalie Corinne Hansen 743 reinforces, the lack of challenge to dominant social roles (class, gender, race, species) in light of the trauma that Beauty and the other horses suffer in the novel? Why does the text explicitly condemn class and species exploitation, while at the same time justifying it? What roles do the depictions of violence and suffering play in the novel's work of education and of arguing for improving conditions for working classes of all species? I return here to the question of why this novel, with its simplistic structure and sentimental narrative, has had such an impact, not just in its immediate popularity in nineteenth-century Britain, America, and Europe but in its continuing popularity as a children' s story into the twenty first century. "Moral Legibility" One way to understand the didacticism of the novel is to trace Anna Sewell's exposure to and participation in the emerging humanitarian movements of the late nineteenth century. Raised as a Quaker, Sewell was connected through her family and in her own actions with social movements that focused on the improvement of individual and society (Landsbury 65). She worked to educate children and workers of the lower classes, following the lead of her mother, who also wrote Christian-themed children's stories (see Chitty). Sewell's family had been Quakers through many generations, and Black Beauty represents arguments for traditional Quaker values such as peace (in arguing against violence and war), equality (in arguing for the equality of men and women, against slavery, and for humane treatment of the working poor), integrity ("choosing to follow the leading of the Spirit despite the challenges and urges to do otherwise"), and simplicity in living (see www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Quakers). Sewell's narration of these values through the voice of Black Beauty echoes socio-cultural changes of her time, such as the reexami nation of class and gender roles, including contemporary legislation to establish certain rights for women and children working in factories, as well as shifting roles for horses in industrialized settings.7 Black Beauty analogizes human and nonhuman bodies in order to appeal to moral sensibilities. While the strategy of using an equine narrator</page><page sequence="18">744 jac works to distance readers from implication in entrenched systems of inequality by allowing the reader the position of moral judge, this narrative strategy at the same time forces identification with the equine narrator, drawing readers into sympathizing with Beauty's suffering and the suffering of the other horses whose stories he tells. Ultimately, SewelPs moral discourse argues for improvement in the treatment of horses through improving the conditions of life for lower classes of humans who care for and labor alongside horses and through reforming the manners of the upper classes who employ both human and nonhuman labor. The narrative appeals to readers by suggesting that abusive behavior works against human reason, here expressed in moral sensibilities and ethical responsibilities. Jerry Barker, the good cabman in the novel, puts it this way: "If a thing is right, it can be done, and if it is wrong, it can be done without; and a good man will find a way" (257). Sewell's stance toward the welfare of human and nonhuman servants holds humans responsible for kind stewardship within the frame of their roles as "masters" and "mistresses." Fulfilling the responsibilities of these roles includes not just taking care of the self and personal possessions but also standing up for the well being of those who cannot advocate for themselves, the socially and politically voiceless: nonhuman animals, domestic servants, slaves, women, and children. In one scene that models such intervention, a "gentleman" (whose name is Wright, standing for "right" conduct) who is a passenger in Beauty' s cab stops a drunk carter from beating his horses, saying,"' If you don't stop that directly, I'll have you summoned for leaving your horses, and for brutal conduct'" (269). After the incident, this gentleman discusses the need for such action with his traveling companion, who is surprised that this man, who seems to have enough business of his own to attend to (the implication is that he is a politician or lawyer), has intervened: "Do you know why this world is as bad as it is?" "No," said the other. "Then I'll tell you. It is because people think only about their own business, and won't trouble themselves to stand up for the op pressed, nor bring the wrong-doer to light-My doctrine is this, that if we see cruelty or wrong that we have the power to stop, and do nothing, we make ourselves sharers in the guilt." (270-71)</page><page sequence="19">Natalie Corinne Hansen 745 This interaction contrasts the activist (and righteous) humanitarian re former with a companion who is content to let others attend to their own business. The reformer clearly argues that quietism is not an option, that allowing others to commit ethical violations implicates the observer in the violation. The problem of abuse caused by and resulting in de-humaniza tion is demonstrated repeatedly in Black Beauty, and the novel's reformist message is that if humans do nothing about injustices, we are implicated in them regardless of whether or not we are the perpetrators. A common reading of the novel argues that in its appeal to readers' sympathy, Black Beauty seeks to offer "an insight, not exactly into how a horse feels, but into what it would be like, if one could be so transformed, to feel the bit, the blinkers, the bearing rein, the good and foolish treatment, and to realize with the whole of one's moral nature what was being done without being able to alter one's lot" (Blount 252-53). One argument is that the anthropomorphism of giving voice to horses diminishes the distance between the human reader and the equine protagonist, encour aging the reader to adopt the horse's point of view. Chitty, talking about children's attraction to the book and their identification with Black Beauty, says, "Anna Sewell spirits them inside the gleaming hide of her horse. They learn what it is to go on four legs, to have ears that prick and a tail to swish off flies. They feel the cold steel of the bit between their teeth, the stiff crupper under their tails and the weight of the carriage that follows them everywhere whether they like it or not" (244).8 The teaching of moral behavior through the example of suffering and forbearance is also characteristic of melodramatic narrative forms. In her writings on race melodrama, Williams explains how melodrama works to create identification with victimization through sentimental appeal: "A characteristic feature of melodrama is its concentration on 'the point of view of the victim'" (29). Black Beauty's moral fortitude in the face of extreme suffering exemplifies virtue in a world where traditional meanings of virtue are being undone: "[Melodrama] needs a victim whose visible suffering transmutes into proof of virtue. The key function of victimization is to orchestrate the moral legibility crucial to the mode, for if virtue is not obvious, suffering?often depicted as the literal suffering of an agonized body?is" (Williams 29). It is the pain and suffering of the victim that is felt in the emotional response the novel elicits. The shortcoming of this</page><page sequence="20">746 jac response is that the evocation of empathy that links the reader to the victim implies an active empathizer but a passive object: "Certainly, empathy transforms the subject (the one who feels empathy) but this transformation is a very local one as long as it does not really give his object the chance to be activated as subject, the subject feeling empathy remaining the only subject of the whole thing" (Despret 128). In this way, the relationship to the victim is self-serving and fails to account for the subjectivity of the other: "While pretending to be inhabited (or locally transformed) by the other, the empathic in fact 'squats' in the other. Empathy allows us to talk about what it is to be (like) the other, but does not raise the question 'what it is to be "with" the other'" (Despret 128). Melodrama's appeal to sentiment is " a form of somatic knowledge" (Williams 35). This embodied knowing is cathartic; it "purifies through pity and fear" (Chitty 245). In doing so, it reinscribes difference as hierarchy. The reader, although empathizing with Beauty's suffering, stands apart from it in the position of being capable of redeeming such suffering. Because of his or her position as powerless, the sufferer is objectified in this moment of sympathy: "The suffering body caught up in paroxysms of mental or physical pain can be male or female, but suffering itself is a form of powerlessness that is coded feminine" (Williams 29). Here the feminized, disempowered body is also the animalized body, which codes in other texts for the racialized body. There are stylistic and substantive similarities between Black Beauty and Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, and Chitty notes that the American publisher of Black Beauty, an activist against cruelty to horses, "had been anxious for some years to find a book that would do for horses what Uncle Tom's Cabin had done for slaves" (224). Rendering the suffering bodies of victims visible, and thereby appealing for humane treatment of disenfranchised populations, is shown by both of these examples to positively enable remediation of conditions of inequality. However, humanizing does not necessarily alter the conditions of inequality under which suffering bodies become visible; humanization can also effectively mask structural in equalities within kind and gentle?humane?treatment. What then is the appeal of identification, first, with the suffering body and, second, with the role of redeemer? The visibility of suffering bodies enables the reader, as human, as privileged, to act in response, to</page><page sequence="21">Natalie Corinne Hansen 747 ameliorate, if not the ideological and structural inequalities that produce this suffering then at least the material conditions that render it unbearable to watch and overtly implicate us in the injustice: "The pathos of suffering thus not only ensures virtue, but also seems to entitle action" (Williams 32). The action that is entitled here reinforces the actor's agency (virtue) in the form of ameliorating the victim's suffering. Thus, while Black Beauty dramatizes injustices and suffering, calling for change to visible abuses, it also reinscribes hierarchical differences within the confines of anthropo centric organizations of power: "Other animals are not recognized as limiting human assertiveness but instead taken as passive objects of its dominion, unilateral norms, or program of ethical self-development" (LaCapra 161). Rights and Wrongs Although Black Beauty offers the catharsis of sympathy for disadvan taged others and encourages action to ameliorate suffering, it upholds underlying systemic inequalities, be these speciesism, racism, classism, or sexism. Black Beauty continues to represent the ways that social relations are organized according to hierarchy and privilege. Williams argues that this kind of conservatism is characteristic of melodrama, in which "solution[s] to the very real social and political issues raised by the form can only occur through a perverse process of victimization" (Williams 42). Victimization is a "perverse" process in that it argues for empowerment by rendering disempowerment visible. Legal and social changes respond to the victimization and suffering of disenfranchised populations, amelio rating conditions of living but failing to address the power disparity between victim and victimizer, be the latter individual or institutional. This process of perverse victimization is enacted in the way that rights discourses are modeled on the "role of pain and suffering in the construc tion of American citizenship" (23): In the liberal, Constitutional model of citizenship, a citizen's value is secured through the notion of an abstract personhood protected equally under the law. But since this juridical notion of abstract personhood often fails to provide equal protection to all citizens, a second model of citizenship has emerged around the visible emo</page><page sequence="22">748 jac tions of suffering bodies that, in the very activity of suffering, demonstrate worth as citizens. (Williams 23,24) Emotional manifestations of suffering render injustice visible and may lead to valuable legal changes that institute formal rights; however, animal welfare activism must also aim legal modifications toward challenging the liberal, constitutional model of citizenship and the humanist construction of the subject.9 Rights discourses diffuse individual implication in systemic inequalities, echoing how melodrama works as a cathartic reenactment of suffering and redemption. The model of "strength in weakness" (Williams 43) is familiar in animal rights and animal welfare discourses. The rights model of human animal relations, with its origins in nineteenth-century social movements, appeals to humans to "rescue" suffering animals, to work against abuses inflicted on animal bodies. There is a cultural component to this work in "the achievement of a felt good, the merger?perhaps even the compro mise?of morality and feeling into empathically imagined communities forged in the pain and suffering of innocent victims, and in the actions of those who seek to rescue them" (Williams 21). It makes sense to think of animal rights and animal welfare groups as communities basing their collective identity around the suffering of nonhuman bodies and the melodrama of rights discourses representing concerns that appear in our everyday lives: "the social problems of everyday reality?problems such as illegitimacy, slavery, racism, labor struggles, class division, disease, nuclear annihilation, genocide" (Williams 18). How does the interest in suffering bodies work to diffuse collective anxieties? Lauren Berlant suggests "the turn to sentimental rhetoric at moments of social anxiety constitutes a generic wish for an unconflicted world, one where structural inequities, not emotions and intimacies, are epiphenomenal" (646). Nineteenth-century urban dwellers in Britain and America witnessed equine suffering on a daily basis, and Black Beauty appealed to these populations to reassess their use of horses and to ameliorate poor working conditions for human and nonhuman laborers, a critical step in addressing the systemic inequalities that preface these conditions. The fact that Black Beauty continues to appeal to twenty-first century audiences across America, Britain, and Europe poses the question of what the suffering depicted in the novel and its incarnation in the "animal</page><page sequence="23">Natalie Corinne Hansen 749 body" says about "the moral health" of our nations.10 One thing that can be said is that this moral health remains constrained within the humanist legacy of categorical exclusions. Although juridical boundaries of the legally human have been progressively modified so as to include different types of humans?people of color, women, ethnic and religious minorities, people with dis/abilities, homosexuals?the concept of the human in legal discourse, in institutional practice, and in everyday life continues to be positioned against the category of the nonhuman.11 Expanding the category of the human to include previously excluded others is a valid approach to mediating the problem of categorical inequalities, particularly in relation to other humans. This approach, however, has somewhat limited reach in application to nonhumans, leaving intact the privilege of the category "human" by failing to interrogate what being human offers that is denied to nonhumans. Judith Butler, echoing her earlier questioning of which and how bodies come to matter, asks, "Who counts as human? Whose lives count as lives?" (20). Although Butler asks these questions in the context of critiquing war, racial profiling, and persistent colonial oppression, the questions can also to be asked in light of human relations with nonhuman lives. Do nonhuman lives count as "livable lives"? Are there nonhuman lives that qualify as "grievable"?that is, as recognizably human? (Butler xv). On what basis are the suffering bodies of animals grievable? Why do some seem to be (those of pets) and some not (those who become food)? How do we conceive of lives that exist in the spaces in between juridically sanctioned lives, and what responsibility do we have to attend to such lives? A more basic question is "Why should animals have to measure up to human standards for humanity before their existence counts?" (MacKinnon 321). This question underscores how using human criteria to judge nonhuman life can reconfirm the hegemony of the human: "The major problem here is not so much the distinctions [used to differentiate human and nonhuman animals] ... but the very desire to postulate them with their invidious functions and consequences, particularly in the attempt to reduce or eliminate the problematic or contestable dimensions of certain human practices" (LaCapra 158-59). Central to work in animal studies is the idea that human and animal lives come into being together, that humans and nonhumans are constantly</page><page sequence="24">750 jac in relation and work to define each other in profoundly individual as well as ideological ways. Reading horse stories like Black Beauty in order to examine how human lives are imagined as profoundly shaped through relations with nonhuman lives opens reading practices to thinking through relationality in terms of locating the self with and through the nonhuman other in the intimacy of desire or in engagements of shared embodiment. Both these modes of connection between human and horse involve "bodily vulnerability" and the risk that such vulnerability involves in relinquishing the privileged and powerful assumption of human dominion (Butler 42). The topics of vulnerability and risk are central to feminist, queer, and antiracist studies and resonate with animal studies in "demanding a world in which bodily vulnerability is protected without therefore being eradi cated and ... [in] insisting on the line that must be walked between the two" (Butler 42), a demand and an insistence that might offer ways to start thinking a world that could account for and respond more responsibly to nonhuman and dehumanized others.

For histories of equine labor in the nineteenth century see Deny and McShane and Tarr; see Green on equine labor during this period in the United States. 2. The figure of the African prince captured and used as a slave would have been a familiar figure to Swell, appearing as early as 1688 in the novel Oronooko: or, the Royal Slave by Aphra Behn. 3. A historical model for Manley could have been John Rarey, an early "horse whisperer," who eschewed overt violence in training horses: "The strategy .. . that made Rarey' s method new, was the use of insidious rather than manifest force: the horsebreaker effected his victory through a complex of signifying practices that worked to efface all signs of bodily conflict and relied on what appeared to be the animal's psychological recognition of his physical inferiority" (Dorre 70; also see Rarey). For one of the most popular examples of contemporary horse whispering, in which kindness, sympathetic listening, and intuitive understand ing continue to be the main tropes, see Monty Roberts. Dorr? notes that Rarey's method "became fashionable in 1858" in London, where he "brought crowds of</page><page sequence="25">Natalie Corinne Hansen 751 the highest rank and most extensive crinoline" (Dorr6 70). The figure of John, a lower class man who nonetheless has qualities of nobility, could also have been modeled on the groom employed by Queen Victoria, John Brown, the story of whom challenged the strict containments of Victorian class boundaries (Dorr? 1-5). 4. See Chitty 230-31 for pictures of two versions of the bearing rein. The bearing rein was "a fashionable device that forced horses to hold their heads up unnaturally high," preventing proper breathing, inducing muscle strain, and inhibiting a horse's ability to pull a load (Cosslet 74). Black Beauty was written during the era in which animal welfare became a popular concern, reflected in the founding of the SPC A in 1822 (which became the RSPCA in 1840): "Anna Sewell was not herself active in animal protection movements, though she made her own personal interventions. Black Beauty was, however, endorsed by the RSPCA in 1894, and had a specific reforming purpose in the abolition of the bearing-rein" (Cosslet 81; Derry 224; Ritvo 127). 5. See Dong's chapter "Horses and Corsets" and Landsbury's chapter "Riding Masters and Young Mares." 6. The idea that "feeling is believing" is a central tenet of sentimentality. It also resonates with Jeremy Bentham's statement, used repeatedly in animal welfare discourses, about what the appropriate criteria are for animal rights: "The question is not, Can they reason! nor, Can they talk! but, Can they suffer" (Bentham 283 note b). However, Mark Fellenz points out that this statement exists in the same footnote in which Bentham justifies killing and eating animals (59). Fellenz argues that in spite of the importance of Bentham's reformulation, he remains fully utilitarian in his assumption of human dominion (58). Catherine MacKinnon notes that although Bentham shifts the emphasis from "reason and speech as the basis for animal rights" to suffering (332 note 43), suffering as a basis for reform has not successfully produced change (325-26). She asks why "existing alive [is] not enough" to qualify for rights (326). 7. The first attempt to provide protective legislation for domestic animals was in 1809, when Lord Erskine proposed "a parliamentary motion against cruelty to animals" (Thomas 119-20). However, it took until 1822 to pass the first bill to "Prevent the Cruel Treatment of Cattle" (Perkins 16). The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) was founded in 1824, becoming the Royal SPCA in 1840. Soon to follow was "the founding of Francis Power Cobbe's anti-vivisectionist Victoria League (1876)" (Cosslet 3; also see Ritvo 127). For women, "A series of legislative acts materially improved women's legal status: the Married Women's Property Act of 1882 and the Guardianship of Infants Act in 1886"(Showalter7). 8. Also see Ferguson 48-49, who reads Black Beauty as SewelPs fantasy of being a horse. For more on this type of identification and its potentialities, see Chapter 3: "Horse-Crazy Girls"in Hansen.</page><page sequence="26">752 jac 9. As Dominick LaCapra asserts, a central question in relation to animal studies is "whether the concept of human rights should be replaced, or at least supplemented, by that of claims that are so basic or fundamental that they are situated beyond sovereignty and should not be infringed by supposedly sover eign states (or other entities)" (151-52). 10. Burt, glossing M.K. Gandhi, argues, "The appearance and treatment of the animal body becomes a barometer for the moral health of the nation" (36). Gandhi's statement is "The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated" (qtd. in MacKinnon 320). 11. Kelch argues for the use of common law as the basis for rights claims for animals instead of subsuming animals under property rights legislation. Remov ing animals from the classification of property unhinges the dichotomy between property (object status) and persons (with rights).
