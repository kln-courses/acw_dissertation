STRAUSS Indiana University T HIS paper is concerned with an anal- ysis and criticism of what have come to be known as "culture and person- ality" writings, including among others the work of Benedict, Mead, Gorer, Kluckhohn, DuBois, Linton, La Barre, Erikson, and Kardiner. The scholars who have contributed to this movement have a common general orientation although some differences of opinion and emphasis exist.' One wing of the movement includes psychoanalytically trained persons like Fromm, Erikson, and Kardiner. Another wing, represented by a 1 E.g., Linton questions the homogeneity assump- tion as applied to non-literate cultures, wonders if status roles may not have a basic influence on per- sonality, and stresses the overlapping of personality types between cultures; Hsu repudiates Kardiner's kind of psycho-analytic interpretation; Kardiner himself has some second thoughts about his own scheme; Fromm sharply criticizes Kardiner and the whole infant discipline ideology; Beaglehole attacks Fromm's interpretation of Western man; Kluck- hohn attacks Mead's view of American character and also raises a number of critical questions con- cerning the culture-personality approach in general.

Most of the writers fall between the extremes, using a sprinkling of psychoanalytic terminology, sometimes in combination with ideas derived from other areas. The interdisciplinary nature of this ap- proach is often stressed but it is, in actual fact, sharply limited. For example, the theory and research of most psychologists, social psychologists, and sociologists who are con- cerned with personality and psychological processes, are virtually unaffected by the cul- ture-personality writings. Conversely, in the latter there is rarely any reference to the research of social psychologists or psycholo- gists other than clinicians and psychiatrists of Freudian persuasion, and almost no refer- ences to the writings of foreign psychologists. The major preoccupations of the culture- personality writers are: (a) the description and psychological characterization of cultural configurations and the delineation of person- ality types associated with them, and (b) the explanation of given personality types as products of cultural influences and especially of interpersonal relations in early childhood. We shall discuss each of these major inter- ests in turn. 587</page><page sequence="2">588 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW CULTURAL CONFIGURATION AND MODAL PER- SONALITY POINT OF VIEW The traditional method of ethnology em- phasized the exhaustive description of primi- tive societies with relatively little emphasis upon psychological characterization as such or upon the total configuration or gestalt. The emphasis was rather upon specific modes of behavior in definitely delineated situations and upon the "psychological" features mainly as exhibited in the overt behavior and verbalization of the natives. The change in viewpoint initiated by the culture-person- ality school is well indicated by Kroeber's2 comment: "As late as I915 the very word 'personality' still carried overtones chiefly of piquancy, unpredictability, intellectual daring. . . ." Influenced by conceptions borrowed from Gestalt psychology and psy- choanalysis, and by Sapir's early stress on the need to study the individuals in a so- ciety, some ethnologists have attempted to characterize societies in psychological terms as functioning wholes or configurations. The observer seeks to characterize what may be called the "essence" of the culture in psycho- logical terms, i. e., the people's view of the world and of human relations. Such char- acterization of peoples and nations is not a totally new enterprise. Long before the rise of modern anthropology, writers and scholars attempted the same sort of description of what was called the "genius" or "ethos" of a people. As Kroeber3 notes: "More than eight- een hundred years ago Tacitus gave to pos- terity one of the masterpieces of this genre in his analysis of German custom and char- acter." Following logically from this emphasis on cultural configurations is the idea that given cultural configurations have their counter- parts in the individuals of each society. Given cultures produce one or more types of personality designated by such terms as "modal personality," "basic personality structure," "character structure," and so on. In arriving at their characterization of cultures and personality types the investiga- 2A. L. Kroeber, Anthropology, I948, p. 4I4. Ibid., p. 317. tors rely upon conventional ethnological techniques and data, but seek to go beyond them by utilizing them in combination with studies of individuals. Much attention is paid to interpersonal relations, childhood traning, projective and objective tests, and sometimes even to photographing people in specified situations. The investigator immerses himself in a given society as far as the barriers of lan- guage, time, available informants, and his own personality permit. From the welter of data he arrives at his characterizations through acts of abstraction, selection, and synthesis. Some characterizations are made vicariously, the writer utilizing materials col- lected by others, supplemented usually by in- terviews with emigrants. The investigators do not describe very clearly or in detail how given characteriza- tions are arrived at.4 Stress is placed upon offering the reader a mass of data concerning those aspects of behavior which are the focus of the characterizations. It should be noted that anthropologists often view the culture-personality approach as something in the nature of a fad, although it is generally conceded that it offers inter- esting and potentially significant knowledge. In terms of total output, culture-personality writings constitute only a small portion of anthropological writings. Current popularity of the point of view is attested by Kroeber5 who remarks: "Personality is the slogan of the moment . . . the prospect may look dire to those who are interested in culture as such. But with experience one learns that these waves go much as they come." The works of the culture-personality 'Cf. Fromm's vagueness on this point when pressed by Bateson (Culture and Personality, Vi- king, pp. I0-II, I949). This vagueness is characteristic of the whole literature. Linton recognizes this when he says "The Modal Personality' for any society can be established directly and objectively by studying the frequencies of various personality configurations among a society's members. The fact that, to the best of my knowledge, it never has been so estab- lished does not invalidate the concept." Ibid., p. T6 . f A. L.

The implications of the cultural relativity principle have not by any means been fully taken into account either by social scientists or by the general public. The point, no doubt, needs to be hammered home as these writers are doing. Their works amply demonstrate the enor- mous range of variation in the organization of societies and human responses. The criticisms which follow are not intended in any way to detract from this substantial accomplish- ment. CRITICISM Oversimplification and the homogeneity postulate. The attempt to make psychologi- cal characterizations of cultures "may be re- garded as attempted short-hand translation of the more general patterns of a culture."' This procedure raises questions having to do with selectivity, neglect of inconsistent data, proof of assertions, and the possibility of corroboration by other investigators. No one, of course, questions the existence of gross differences between cultures. The question is rather that of the scientific precision of spe- cific characterizations and the methods of obtaining them. Anthropologists have questioned the ac- curacy of the boiling-down process when carried too far. Benedict, for example, was criticized for describing Zuni, Kwakiutl, and Dobu peoples too simply. In short, one notes that the number of questions that are raised concerning any characterization tends to in- crease with the number of investigators fa- miliar with the society.7 The question was Kroeber, op. cit., p. 586. For examples of criticisms by specialists see: P. Nash, review of Gorer's Himalayan Village, American Anthropologist, XLIII (I94I), 242; R. Thurnwald, review of Mead's Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies, American Anthropolo- gist, XXXVIII (I936), 666; M. Titiev, review of Joseph and Thompson, The Hopi Way, American Anthropologist, XLVIII (I946), 430-432; J. Whit- ing, review of Mead's The Mountain Arapesh, American Anthropologist, XLII (1940), i6i-i62. See also Benedict who stresses "shame" in Japanese character and La Barre who does not mention it: R. Benedict, Chrysanthemum and the Sword, 1946; raised whether many non-literate societies might not be characterized more profitably in terms of multiple patterns or "themes." A similar point has been made with respect to the numbers of personality types within given societies. The earlier culture-personality writ- ings often understressed or ignored indi- viduals who did not conform to the person- ality type assumed as typical of the culture. This explaining-away or ignoring of negative evidence has given way to . . . the study of the range of personalities in a society. . . . Characteristic personality sub- types may develop from the differing situations of the life of persons who play different roles in a given group.8 This trend toward studying the "range of personalities" and of multiple themes within a culture, if carried out to its logical limits, implies a radical revision of the original ideas, as we shall show later. It represents a healthy tendency to move toward more limited and specific problems which can be handled by the established techniques of analysis and proof, rather than dealing with the impossible task of handling entire cul- tures in one fell swoop, as "wholes." A good many of the questions now being raised will no longer be pertinent when the tendency de- scribed by Herskovits is carried further. When this is done, however, stricter stand- ards of proof will have to be met, and many other theories besides the neo-Freudian will have to be taken into account. The dangers inherent in gestalt descriptions of societies are graphically brought out by culture-per- sonality efforts to describe complex modern societies. Any social scientist who seeks to characterize a modern nation, even in a whole volume, to say nothing of a few pages, has to handle a host of detailed problems and meet a number of exacting requirements. These are so numerous and so complex that to one not imbued with the culture-person- ality fervor the task looks impossible. These W.

The same strictures apply with even greater force to attempts to characterize Western character and culture in general. The applications of culture-personality methods to modern societies-especially the American, with which we are reasonably well acquainted-have fared so badly at the hands of competent critics that one wonders along with Bierstedt'0 whether the effect has not been "to stimulate the growth of skepticism concerning the information which anthropologists have given us about non- literate peoples." Undoubtedly the heterogeneity of modern nations, as many of the writers themselves have pointed out, offers a considerable ob- stacle to the application of present configura- tional methods. It is hoped, however, that after the techniques have been perfected in the study of simpler, more "homogeneous" societies they may be extended successfully to more complex groups. A more fundamental question must, however, be raised concerning the general validity of the homogeneity as- sumption itself, even as applied to the larger ,,Cf., Kroeber's criticism of Mead's a-historical bias, as when she discusses American educational practices of 1930 without reference to an American and European past: A. Kroeber, review of Mead's Growing Up in New Guinea, American Anthro- pologist, XXX (193I), 248-250. Bierstedt recently has pointed out the shortcomings of a non-histori- cal approach in many anthropological writings when applied to the study of complex societies: R. Bierstedt, "The Limitations of Anthropological Methods in Sociology," American Journal of So- ciology, LIV (I948), 22-30. One might point out that non-literate societies also have important his- tories. " Bierstedt, ibid., p. 29. groupings of non-literate peoples. One sus- pects, as Bernard'1 has said, that too much attention is being paid to "the blond Swede." Psychic Entities vs. Behavior. The homogeneity-configuration postulates savor strongly of Aristotelian conceptions of "es- sence" and "accident." The "essences" (configuration, basic personality structures) are given high status in the realm of "being," whereas the behaviors which "express" these essences are of an inferior status. Even though the behavior may vary from one indi- vidual to the next, and from one generation to the next, it is thought of as an emanation or manifestation of the same essence. Cur- rent recognition of a range of personality types and of multiple configurations within a single society is an effort to deal with nega- tive evidence and deviations often ignored by earlier writers, but the accident-essence framework is still retained since the number of essences is merely increased. The range idea also has the effect of making it doubly difficult, if not impossible, to prove that the generalizations reached are either true or false. There is a tendency in these investigations to deduce psychic entities from overt be- havior in specific situations, and then to ex- plain the overt behavior in terms of these reifications. There is a search for something like the "real inner personality" or "au- thentic individual" conceived as something apart from behavior. The inner reality thus becomes a force which manifests itself in the behavior from which it is inferred. Linton12 explicitly states this position: The nature and even the presence of psychic needs are only to be deduced from the behavior to which they give rise. .. Personality will be taken to mean 'the organ- ized aggregate of psychological processes and states pertaining to the individual.' [This defini- ' J.

In general, all the individuals who occupy a given position in the structure of a particular society will respond to many situations in very much the same way. . . . Until the psychologist knows what the norms of behavior imposed by a particular society are, and can discount them as indicators of personality, he will be unable to penetrate behind the facade of social conformity and cultural conformity to reach the authentic individual. What is meant by "authentic individual"? Do not cultural roles and internalized norms connected with them (e. g., sex roles) influ- ence the "authentic individual"? The search for the "real motives," the "deep inner core," the "authentic individ- ual," conceived as something separate from behavior leads to circularity of proof and immunity to negative evidence.'3 Thus, if there is no available evidence that ascribed reactions actually take place, it can always be assumed that they are "unconscious" re- actions. If the persons seem to have no knowledge of them, or deny the imputed motives, or give other interpretations of their behavior, these objections are easily disposed of by calling them "rationalizations" or by pointing out that, after all, the people are not usually aware of the premises of their culture which as motivations underlie their daily conduct. A gross example of this procedure is pro- vided by G. Roheim,'4 who argues with re- gard to knowledge of procreation among primitives, that: If we see, on the one hand, that the Arunta deny knowing anything of the matter, and on the other that they have beliefs and rites that are only explicable on the assumption that such knowledge exists somewhere and makes itself felt in their psychic system, we shall say that 13The postulation of entities may be legitimate under certain conditions: (a) when existing knowl- edge and evidence make it necessary and when empirical means of determining the existence of the entity are suggested, or (b) when the postula- tion of the entity leads to verifiable inferences which cannot be made otherwise. 1Social Anthropology, I936, p. 144. they are unconscious of their own instinctive knowledge of procreation and that the concepts that enter consciousness are symbolic substitutes of a physiological account of the process of procreation. The above may be dismissed as an extreme psychoanalytic fantasy, but, with some differ- ences, the same technique of calling on un- conscious ideas when the evidence fails, or is disputable, is widespread. Thus Benedict15 in her book on the Japanese says that: "In this task of analysis the court of authority is not necessarily Tanaka San, the Japanese 'anybody.' For Tanaka San does not make his assumptions explicit, and interpretations written for Americans will undoubtedly seem to him unduly labored." Such a procedure allows the interpretive framework of the in- vestigator to persist undisturbed in the face of negative evidence and criticisms, even from intelligent and trained members of the group being characterized. Trait psychology lends itself very readily to the use of reified psychic elements to ex- plain behavior of which these traits are, in reality, merely names. Thus, when aggressive behavior is explained in terms of a "fund of aggression,"16 or of a "trait of aggressive- ness," this amounts to saying that behavior is aggressive because it is aggressive. These traits are often not self-evident, and at the beginning of his research the investigator often is uncertain of the "meaning" of spe- cific acts. The "meanings" that are finally found are thus the investigator's inferences from behavioral data. The final psychological characterizations often leave this behav- ioral or situational basis of the inferred psychic elements or traits out of considera- tion. Confusion of Fact and Interpretation. The terms that are used in these characterizations are inevitably taken from Western psycho- logical vocabularies, and inevitably lead the reader to think of the people according to the Western models with which he is famil- iar.

La Barre, op. cit.</page><page sequence="6">592 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW context of the society does not run into the same dangers of unchecked inference. In this regard a remark of Titiev's,17 a South- west specialist, is pertinent: Dr. Thompson . . . exhibits an unfortunate tendency to distort various items taken from literature. A girlish pursuit game somewhat comparable to follow-the-leader, is magnified into a faithful portrayal of "the guidance role of the mother and the difficult and centripetal life course of the Hopi girl." Titiev's criticism may be extended to many culture personality inferences. Thus, when- ever it is postulated that a given people have a given trait such as "aggressiveness," "pas- sivity," "withdrawness," "impulsiveness," as part of their "basic personality structure," it is easy to take the unwarranted step of regarding specific behavior as a manifesta- tion or effect of the given trait. Conclusions of this type are buttressed not so much by evidential proof as by the piling up of illus- trations which are unlikely to convince any- one who is not already sold on the under- lying ideology. No one is likely to quarrel seriously with characterizations of a people when these descriptions are couched in objective be- havioral terms, as in conventional ethnologi- cal accounts. But when ethnologists inter- pret the "meanings" of behavior in psycho- logical terms, it becomes exceedingly diffi- cult for the reader to separate facts from interpretations. An interesting comment bearing on this point was made by the Murphys18 in a review of Mead-Bateson's Balinese Character. They conclude that "in spite of the photographic record, the study still shows some lack of systematic frame- work, the lack of sharp distinction between hypotheses and fact." The extensive use of photographs in the Mead-Bateson book made it possible for the reviewers to question some of the authors' interpretations. The reviewers go on to say that the photographs allow the reader to ob- serve incidents in the backgrounds of the 17 op. Cit., P. 431. i8 L. and G. Murphy, American Anthropologist, XLV (1943), 6i5-6i9. pictures which raise questions about matters in the foregrounds. They add that "as a de- vice for cultural study this has very impor- tant advantages over one which presents data and interpretations so interwined that they are impossible to handle independently." The necessity for presenting "data" and "interpretations" separately becomes greater the more remote and inaccessible the cul- ture.19 The closer a society is to us and the more that is known about it, the easier it be- comes to dispute interpretations of it. One wonders what would happen to the various characterizations of psychologically remote societies if the natives, as well as the investi- gator's own colleagues who happen to have some knowledge of the society, were able to answer back! We know what happened when the "natives" read the Mead and Gorer ma- terial on the United States. Two interesting incidents that bear upon this point may be cited. Herskovits20 writes that "Li, a Chinese anthropologist, whose own physical traits made him inconspicuous among the Indians [Zuni], found them, as people, to be quite different from the picture of themselves they had presented to white students." Li spent a mere two and one-half months of moderately intimate participation in Zuni life-the Zuni being among the most studied and most characterized non-literate peoples in the world. Another relevant case is that of the anthropologist Peter Buck, of Maori descent, who called into question some of the fundamental interpretations of Maori character and culture made by the Beagle- holes.21 The recent tendencies to present more documentation of conclusions is certainly a step in the right direction since it allows the reader to form some opinions of his own. This documentation usually consists of auto- biographies and test results. The utilization 19J. Bernard has also noted the ready confusion of fact and interpretation in anthropological writ- ings: "Observation and Generalization in Cultural Anthropology,".

Beaglehole, Some Modern Maoris, I946.</page><page sequence="7">A CRITIQUE OF CULTURE-PERSONALITY WRITINGS 593 of these materials has, however, raised addi- tional questions. For example, there is the question of sampling that arises when auto- biographies are gathered. Du Bois' study of the Alorese employs this method and illus- trates the problem very well. H. Powder- maker22 suggests that the autobiographies do not represent Alorese modal character be- cause Du Bois was apparently able to inter- view only relatively unsuccessful Alorese, "those who did not approximate the goals of their culture." She also raises the question of the influence of the investigator upon the interview situation. "We know of no society where people will talk about their private inner feelings upon request [and for pay], and in response to questions from a relative stranger at regular periods each day." The use of autobiographical documents is of course desirable but does not in itself prove anything. The critical reader is not convinced that the persons used in obtaining the docu- ments constitute a representative sample, or that the documents cannot be interpreted in a variety of ways. The claim that projectives and other tests may be used to validate analyses made by other ethnological methods must be qualified by noting that test results are not self- explanatory, but must themselves be inter- preted like other data. The tests are certainly useful, but they are not an open-sesame to the truth. All of them were devised and validated by Western investigators operating within the confines of Western culture, and even within that culture their significance is a matter of controversy. This is especially true of the projectives.23 The discrepancies between Kardiner's24 interpretations of Alorese character and Overholzer's infer- ences from Rorschach results raise some doubts about the use of projectives in cul- ture-personality research. ' Review of Du Bois' The People of Alor, American Anthropologist, XLVII (I945), I55-i6i. For similar criticism of informants in general see C. Kluckhohn in Culture and Personality (Viking), p. 9i, and 0. Klineberg, ibid., p. I36. 22 Cf. Murphy, Personality, I949, pp. 663-700. 24A. Kardiner, The Psychological Frontiers of Society, I945, pp. 240-247. The use of tests may prove to be mislead- ing by suggesting an illusory precision and definitiveness. This is especially true when the usual statistical precautions are not fol- lowed. Thus, in a review of the Children of the People, M. Kuhn25 remarks: ... a defect is the failure of the researchers, after espousing the use of quantitative methods, to apply even the minimum sampling standards, such as tests of representativeness, adequacy, and statistical significance of difference which are required by these methods. An idea of the inadequacy of some of the interpretations of the tests may be obtained from the fact that in The Hopi Way conclu- sions about Hopi animism are based on the answers to a single question!26 And this is done in spite of the extensive controversial literature on methods of testing animism in children. As other examples, Powdermaker27 notes that the thirty-seven Alorese who took Du Bois' Rorschach test were unidentified and probably unrepresentative, and Titiev28 questions how the Hopi way, "which is a subtle, complex, and mature outlook on life, can be properly interpreted or clarified on the basis of tests administered to i90 school children, of whom no less than 45 per cent were io years of age or younger." The Operation of Western Biases. The use of projective tests points up one of the fundamental and pervasive weaknesses of many of the interpretations of non-Western peoples; namely, that Western biases must inevitably find expression in the inferences made about the psychological characteristics of given peoples. As R. Benedict29 has said: No man ever looks at the world with pristine eyes. He sees it edited by a definite set of cus- toms and institutions and ways of thinking. Even in his philosophical probings he cannot go behind these stereotypes; his very concept of the true and the false will still have reference to his particular traditional customs. 26 American Sociological Review, XIII (I948), ii8. These remarks apply equally well to such a study as The Hopi Way. 2"L. Thompson and A. Joseph, The Hopi Way, I944, p. 92. 27Op. cit. 28 Op. Cit. 25 Patterns of Culture, I934, p. 2.</page><page sequence="8">594 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW Herskovits30 makes a similar point. "Judg- ments are based on experience, and experi- ence is interpreted by each individual in terms of his own enculturation." (Italics his.) Anthropologists constantly warn their readers against Western biases, and quite rightly. They are generally aware that these biases can, and perhaps must, unwittingly influence their own research. This warning has not been taken into account in anything like its full implications by culture-person- ality writers. Admittedly the problem of de- scribing non-Western peoples without includ- ing one's own biases in the account is a difficult undertaking. One cannot help but feel that many conclusions reached about non- Western character structures and their genesis should have been couched in much more ten- tative and cautious terms. This is especially relevant to characterizations which seek to get at "inner psychic realities" and their origins. A comment from Li,3' whose short partici- pant-observer residence among the Zuni we have previously mentioned, portrays vividly the culture-personality writer's difficulties: We find another one-sided statement on . . . the problem of interpretation of Zuni life. Avoidance of leadership in social life is a corol- lary of the lack of personal feelings in religion. If one is not interested in vision quest . .. what is more natural than the supposition that leader- ship among men is not desired. But here is just a case in which the premise is correct enough while the conclusion does not necessarily follow. Dr. Benedict reports that a Zuni is afraid of be- coming "a leader of his people" lest he should "likely be persecuted for sorcery," and that he would be "only interested in a game that a num- ber can play with even chances" for "an out- standing runner spoils the game." The basic fallacy seems to lie in the tendency to reason with the logical implications of one's own culture. [Our italics.] In the competitive Western world where one is brought up to assume that the world is made for his exploitation, and where if one does not push ahead, one is surely pushed 30 Op. cit., p. 63. 31 Li, An-che, "Zuni: Some Observations and Queries," American Anthropologist, XXXIX ( I93 7), 67-68. behind, it is certainly logical that lack of personal acquisitiveness implies the denial of leadership. One of the aspects of anthropological thinking which tends to neutralize the whole- some emphasis on cultural variability and the dangers of ethnocentric bias, is the out- of-hand dismissal of the hypothesis that in- tellectual processes may vary in different so- cieties and even within different groups within the same society. This is part of the reaction against the writings of some schol- ars like Levy-Bruhl, who have attempted to give brief, simple characterizations of primi- tive thought in general. Linton32 perhaps summarizes a fairly usual position when he asserts categorically: As far as we can ascertain, the intellectual processes themselves are the same for all normal human beings in all times and places. At least individuals who begin with the same premises always seem to arrive at the same con- clusions. Linton33 has inconsistently assailed his own view by elsewhere describing language as "a tool for thinking" (note the characteristic dualism which separates language behavior from thinking behavior by animistically des- ignating the former as a tool of the latter); and asserting that "concepts which are an integral part of all linguistic forms have a subtle influence upon individuals' ways of thinking. The concepts are even more com- pulsive because they are totally uncon- scious." His primary criticism of linguistics appears to be that it has ignored this problem 82 Cultural Background of Personality, 1945, pp. IOI-I02. This statement appears flatly contradictory to the earlier one by Benedict. Mead also confesses that ". . . one serious difficulty confronts the an- thropologist. When writing about some strange South Sea culture, there is the persistent difficulty of translating strange native ideas into English, until one wishes passionately that it were possible to describe Samoa in Samoan and Arapesh in the Arapesh language": Keep Your Powder Dry, p. io.

Since virtually all readers of characteriza- tions of non-literate peoples are themselves Westerners, unacquainted with the peoples in question, there are few competent critics to point out any but the most flagrant in- stances of the influence of Western "pro- jective systems" on the ethnologists' ac- counts. It is, for example, relatively easy to detect La Barre's34 wartime pro-demo- cratic feeling in his unsympathetic account of Japanese "compulsive" character, and it is easy to agree with J. Honigmann35 that Kardiner has placed a rather gross evalua- tion upon Alorese "narrowness" and "unfit- ness for cooperation"; and one may readily agree with Kroeber's36 statement that Du Bois' characterization of the Alorese: ... seems one-sidedly repellant.... The ap- praising observer comes from a culture that values internalization, conscience, reliance, scruple, courage, consistency of feeling and rela- tions, dignity, and achievement, qualities that are under-developed in Alor. Hence the picture is black. The detection of more subtle biases awaits the scrutiny of other trained observers-es- pecially natives and cultural hybrids-and the development of more objective techniques of evaluation. Thomas and Znaniecki's Po- lish Peasant might be taken as a suggested model in that one of the authors was a native Pole. Kroeber37, having the Western bias in mind, has suggested that although some of the characterizations of non-Western peoples are undoubtedly partially correct, there is not at present any way of distinguishing what is valid from what reflects merely "personalized reactions." He even suggests that the basic assumptions of culture-person- ality studies may be unwarranted since "the categories of psychological characterization developed among Occidentals for Occidentals break down, tend to lose their meaning when 84op. cit. " Review of Kardiner's Psychological Frontiers of Society, Psychiatry, VIII (I945), 499. sAnthropology, pp. 588-589. "Ibid., p. 59I. applied to Asiatics." He suggests that com- parative studies of Western societies may be a necessary preliminary to valid configura- tional and personality studies of non-West- ern peoples. D. Haring's38 caution on draw- ing conclusions about Japanese character might well be extended to all works in this field: ... those who do such research should spend years, not months, in Japan. The writer "learned all the answers" in his first year in Japan. The next six years taught him that practically all of those answers were misleading or false. Perhaps another seven years would have indicated the wisdom of saying nothing at all. DEVELOPMENT OF MODAL OR BASIC PERSONALITY POINT OF VIEW In culture-personality writings, person- ality is conceived largely as the product of interpersonal relationships in childhood. Various degrees of emphasis are placed upon different types of experience. The more psy- choanalytically-oriented writers, such as Gorer, Roheim, Kardiner, La Barre, and Erikson, stress the earliest years as the most crucial; whereas others, like Thompson, Kluckhohn, Goldfrank, Mead, and Benedict place considerable emphasis upon later ex- periences. Some of the genetic explanations employ a straight neo-Freudian terminology, and most of them use at least a few psycho- analytic concepts. Virtually the only hypothe- ses which are generally regarded as worthy of checking are the modified Freudian ones. A. I. Hallowell39 gives the rationale for this tend- ency: This problem [personality] could not be ap- preciated by either anthropologists or students of human psychology until a working hypothesis about the nature of human personality as a struc- tural whole had been developed. Neither aca- demic psychologists nor psychiatrists of a genera- tion ago had much to offer. It is here that psycho- analysis enters the picture. There has been some recent attention paid 'S D.

CRITICISM Effects of Infant Experience Are Un- demonstrated. The lack of attention to al- ternative hypotheses and the neglect of criti- cism and negative evidence concerning vari- ous aspects of psychoanalytic theory give the culture-personality writings the char- acteristics of illustration and documentation of a point of view already assumed to be true. The principal problem merely seems to be to show how the view may be extended to other cultures and perhaps modified in minor ways in the process. A point of view that looms very large in these writings is the one that emphasizes the predominant character-forming efficacy of the infant disciplines: bowel and bladder training, nursing, weaning, mothering, re- straint of motion, punishment, amount and kinds of frustration, and so on. Thus, La Barre40 virtually ascribes the main features of Japanese personality to the rigid bowel training of infants; C. Kluckhohn and 0. Mowrer41 state that too precipitous training of the child in weaning, cleanliness, sex taboos, and aggression control lays the groundwork for "obsessive ambition" and "severe competitive behavior" in adults. E. Erickson42 carries this type of explanation to an absurd limit: The Yurok child . . . is weaned early and abruptly, before the full development of the biting stage, and after having been discouraged from feeling too comfortable with his mother. This expulsion may well contribute to the 40Op. cit., especially pp. 328-329. See also for a similar view, G. Gorer, "Themes in Japanese Cul- ture," Transactions of the New York Academy of Sciences, II (0943), i06-124. For suggestive nega- tive evidence on this point see M. Sikkema, "Ob- servations on Japanese Early Child Training," Psychiatry, X (I947), 423-432. 4' In J. McV. Hunt (ed.), Personality and the Behavior Disorders, vol. I, 944, p. 93. 4In C.

Yurok character a residue of potential nostalgia which consequently finds its institutionalized form in the Yurok's ability to cry while he prays in order to gain influence over the food- sending powers behind the visible world.... The Yurok, in order to be sure of his food supply, feels it necessary to appear hallucinatory, helpless, and nostalgic, and . . . to deny that he has teeth or that his teeth can hurt anybody. The general unproved assumption lying behind this type of interpretation is ex- pressed as follows by Erikson:43 We hold that a child absorbs through his needy senses the cultural modalities of what happens in, to, and around him long before he is provided with a vocabulary. . . . Adults ... selectively accelerate and inhibit the sensual maturation of body orifices and surfaces, and they encourage and restrict the gradual expan- sion of sensory, muscular, and intellectual mastery. In doing so, they systematically though unconsciously establish in the infant's nervous system the basic grammar of their culture's pat- terns. H. Orlansky," in an excellent recent paper, has critically evaluated the data and asser- tions bearing on the question of the influ- ence of infant care on personality develop- ment. He has shown that there is no body of evidence to support assertions like those given above. Some of his main points may be summarized as follows: (a) various writers attribute different and contradictory effects to the same or similar childhood ex- periences; (b) the alleged influences of given infant disciplines or types of experience on personality have not been proven within our own society, to say nothing of others; (c) the method of "proving" that early infancy is of primary importance is shot through with anthropomorphism and unsupported as- sumptions; and (d) post-infantile childhood experiences are probably of more vital im- portance in shaping personality than the pre- lingual ones. Most psychologists and social scientists agree that there is a special significance at- tached to first or early learning. There is 4' Ibid., p. i8o.

What we do not know, and are unable to discover from the culture-personality writings, is what precisely it is that is learned in early infancy and what its exact significance may be for later training. As D. 0. Hebb45 tersely re- marks: "In such matters, our ignorance is virtually complete." Ineffectual Attempts to Salvage Infantile Determination. In an attempt to bring post- infantile experiences into the picture and to salvage remnants of the original doctrine it is commonly asserted (a) if post-infantile experiences tend to reinforce the personality trends established in infancy, then the re- sulting adult traits will conform to the infantile pattern; however, (b) if later ex- periences run counter to earlier ones the re- sulting adult character may be something not predictable from infantile experiences alone. Thus E. Beaglehole46 distinguishes be- tween the "primary character structure" formed in infancy and "secondary character structure" formed later if later experiences do not reinforce the earlier ones. Similarly, Kluckhohn and Mowrer47 assert that: It should be emphasized that, like biological heredity, infant experiences, while placing certain constraints upon personality, give mainly po- tentialities.... Whether these potentialities be- come actualized or not, or the extent to which they become actualized, depends upon later social and other conditions which structure the individual's experience. Kardiner48 makes the same point when he notes concerning the effects of infantile ex- periences: "The . . . question that arises is whether these attitudes need remain perma- nent. They need not, if other factors are introduced into the child's life which would tend to counteract them. However, if they are not counteracted, they tend to continue." These statements raise serious methodo- logical problems that are not dealt with ade- quately, if at all, in this literature.

The latter possibility is not allowed for in the doctrine since, as Kluckhohn and Mowrer49 state: Substantially the same personality trait may be caused by different patterns of childhood experi- ence. . . The same basic discipline or event in early life may result in quite different person- ality trends, depending upon the juxtaposition of various other disciplines, the problems which individuals in each particular society have to meet, and, always, the differing biological equip- ment of different individuals. Thus, whatever happens, the theory is con- firmed in a heads-I-win-tails-you-lose pro- cedure. Orlansky50 has made a similar point in speaking of infantile disciplines: ... the same childhood experience is arbitrarily read as having one significance for personality formation in one society and the opposite signifi- cance in another.... The concept of causation which we are criticizing might be called "proof by juxta- position." Using this method, culture-person- ality writers describe two sets of phenomena widely separated in time, and assert a causal relation. The post hoc nature of this reason- ing is clearly exemplified by Kardiner's51 own account: It is well nigh impossible to tell in advance what particular elaborations will take place in a given culture of such a basic pattern. However, once we are told by the Rorschach that certain end results can be identified, it is a relatively easy matter to reconcile them with the more basic traits. This post hoc method apparently does some- 49Op. cit., p. 96. 'Op. cit., p. 27. See also W. D.

Gorer in his Himalayan Village, 1948, who though he espouses the doctrine of in- fantile determination of personality says: "Owing to the very late psychological maturing of the Lepchas it is difficult to speak with confidence of the character of most of the men under thirty and most of the women under twenty" (p. 367).</page><page sequence="12">598 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW times have its difficulties, for, as Kardiner52 tells us: "I feel somewhat ashamed to con- fess that some of the main points in Alorese personality did not become clear to me until four years after I originally got to know the material." Some writers stress not only that culture shapes personality, but also that personality affects culture. Though the latter assertion is not of concern in this paper, it may be noted that the same sort of post hoc reason- ing is used. Thus Du Bois53 suggests that institutions and child training techniques should be regarded as interdependent vari- ables, and advances the thesis that institu- tions should be altered indirectly through changes in child-rearing practices. In an excess of enthusiasm, Gorer54 carries the post hoc method to an all-time high when he offers twentieth-century urban middle-class fads in child training as the basis for the American form of government estab- lished in the eighteenth century. Anthropomorphism. Culture-personality explanations of the development and fixation of personality in early infancy and childhood are pervaded by anthropomorphism, as Or- lansky has amply shown. The main reasons for this appear to be (a) that little direct study of infants or children is undertaken to determine whether the reactions attributed to them actually occur, and (b) it is assumed that the reaction of infants to a given type of experience "must be" of a certain char- acter without any effort to prove that such is the case, and (c) the dualistic procedure, which postulates psychic "processes and states" as forces or "first causes"55 that pro- duce behavior, invites the investigator to at- tribute motives and reactions which appear reasonable or plausible to him. The following quotation56 nicely illustrates the last two of these points: 2Psychological Frontiers of Society, p. xvii. "Quoted by Kluckhohn and Mowrer, op. cit., p. 28i. '4 The American People, I948. 'Linton, Cultural Background of Personality, p. 10. " D. Leighton and C. Kluckhohn, Children of the People, 1947, pp. 30-31. To the white child, whose feedings and other routines are rigidly scheduled, the mother or nurse must appear incalculable. He finds that there are rules of behavior which are above and beyond his needs or wishes. No matter how hard he cries, he does not get his bottle until the clock says he should. He must develop a feeling that each individual is alone in life. To the Navaho baby, on the other hand, other persons must appear warmer and more dependable, for every time he cries, something is done for him.... [Our italics.] What is "Basic"? Everyone will agree that persons in adult life change occupations, learn new skills, change their status, and so on. It will be admitted that such changes in- volve personality alterations of some kind. What objective grounds are there for stating that such changes are or are not "basic"? The idea that basic personality patterns are established in the first couple of years of life or in pre-adolescent childhood involves the assumption that personality does not change, or changes only in minor ways, in response to later experiences and cultural in- fluences. This view of the matter involves a considerable commitment on an issue that must still be regarded as unsettled, and re- quires that some kind of objective statement about the so-called "basic" elements of the personality be made. It may be pointed out that if personality is conceived as a system of responses arising in a cultural matrix, the individual lives his entire life within such a matrix and is never independent of it. Why, then, unless one assumes that learning and the organization of responses takes place only in childhood, should later experiences be largely ruled out? Most of the culture-per- sonality studies by their very emphases are only partially situationally oriented-that is, with respect to childhood-and take the relative insignificance of later experience for granted. Though this assumption appears to be generally plausible to most social scien- tists, it is nevertheless necessary to show empirically which response systems change readily and which do not, and under what conditions. Indirect vs. Direct Learning. The belief that personality patterns are fixed un-</page><page sequence="13">A CRITIQUE OF CULTURE-PERSONALITY WRITINGS 599 consciously and early involves a corollary assumption that these patterns cannot be directly taught, or that they can be taught later only if the childhood training has been favorable. The latter argument is another heads-I-win-tails-you-lose proposition; the former argument rests upon an invidious comparison of different types of behavior, some being judged as more basic than others without specification of the grounds for these conclusions. At times the argument assumes a purely circular form: those patterns which come first are most important because they are the earliest ones. In reports of research on non-literate peoples considerable data are of course given on direct teaching, but in the interpretation of the deeper meaning of the data and in offering genetic explanations of personality there is a clear tendency to stress the major influence of indirect and unconscious learn- ing. For example, the Beagleholes57 explain the free spending habits of the Maori in terms of childhood frustrations. The funda- mental motive operating here is said to be the "buying of love" which the individual is afraid of losing because of the impact of certain childhood experiences. Peter Buck58 denies this interpretation, suggesting that patterns of handling money are directly taught-a point that is also made by B. Mishkin.59 The Beaglehole interpretation is rendered untenable anyhow by the fact that, regardless of types of childhood training, most non- literate peoples were resistant to the intro- duction of European economic practices and ideas. Though this particular interpretation by the Beagleholes is more obviously vulnerable than others of like character, it is, neverthe- less, a good example of the emphasis on cumbersome and unverifiable theories of in- direct learning where much simpler explana- tions are available. Admittedly the hypothe- sis of direct learning is not always applicable, "E. and P. Beaglehole, op. cit. "8 Buck, ibid., "Foreword." 59 "The Maori of New Zealand," in M. Mead (ed.) Cooperation and Competition Among Primi- tive Peoples, I937, pp. 452, 454-455. but whenever it is, it is attractive by con- trast in its simplicity and verifiability. The predilection for indirect explanations no doubt stems from stresses placed upon "un- conscious" processes, upon emotional aspects of interpersonal relations, and upon the deep, hidden, inner reality called "person- ality." We agree with Linton60 who says: . . . how far is the personality formed by these factors which operate on the child without the child really understanding what is happening, and how far is it formed by actual instruction? I think this is a question we have not solved at all at the present time. SUMMARY AND SUGGESTIONS The bulk of this paper has been concerned with negative criticisms, raised by us and others, concerning the conclusions, evidence, methods, and general conceptual framework offered and used by culture-personality writers. These criticisms seem to us to indi- cate quite clearly that available evidence offered by the writers in support of their con- clusions is inadequate and does not justify their conclusions. Positive generalizations made in this area are generally based upon unwarranted confidence in rather loose un- scientific methods of interpreting data, and upon a relatively uncritical acceptance of a particular conceptual scheme. Research on the psychological responses of non-Western people needs to be made more specific and concrete. Culture-personality writers have, on the whole, tended to avoid this kind of limited investigation for a num- ber of reasons having to do with the danger of viewing a given segment of behavior out of its cultural context. The emphasis upon cul- tural configurations was in part a reaction against such segmental interpretations.61 Moreover, ethnologists have not been con- cerned with specific psychological problems because they have been urgently concerned with gathering descriptive materials about ' In Culture and Personality, p. 172. 61 Cf., M.

In his role as a psychologist the anthro- pologist needs to integrate his work as a careful ethnologist with a large body of psychological theory and research, including the non-clinical. The study of limited, specific, and verifiable propositions does not necessarily run counter to the ethnologist's insistence that a culture must be understood as a whole before specific psychological studies are undertaken. The cultures best suited for these purposes should be those con- cerning which a considerable amount of ethnological material is available. Such in- 62 As early as 1934, R.

Aside from the obvious benefits accruing to anthropology from this "gearing-in," another advantageous effect might be to arouse much more interest in anthropological work on the part of the great majority of psychologists and social psychologists. A concern with more concretely limited and traditionally emphasized psychological problems would broaden the culture-person- ality ethnologist's range of choice of con- ceptual schemes and hypotheses. As it is now, the substantial choice is between no psychol- ogy at all and a brand of neo-Freudianism. The emphasis should not be on committing oneself to one school of thought or another, but of checking all rival hypotheses on specific problems by accepted scientific pro- cedure.</page></plain_text>
