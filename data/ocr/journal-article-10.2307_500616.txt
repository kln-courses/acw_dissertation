<plain_text><page sequence="1">CATALOGUE DU MUSEE ALAOUI. Nouvelle Serie (Col- lections Puniques), Vol. I, by C. Gilbert Picard. Published with the assistance of the Institut des Hautes ltudes de Tunis. Vol. of text, pp. 304; vol. of plates cxxvii and two tables with draw- ings. Printed by La Rapide, Tunis [Text 1954, Plates 1955]. The author is Madame Colette Picard, wife of Gil- bert Charles Picard, the son of the venerable Charles Picard at Paris. The couple are now in Strasbourg, where G. Ch. Picard is a professor in the Facult6 des Lettres of the University; he was formerly Director of Antiquities of Tunis, and is the author of Les Religions de l'Afrique antique (1954). In the Preface (pp. v-vii) it is explained why a new series was begun. There already exist three volumes of the Mus&amp;e Alaoui in the Bardo at Tunis. The first appeared in 1897, one supplement in 910o and a sec- ond supplement in I922. P. Gauckler had divided the first catalogue into thirteen parts according to subjects: A. mosaics, B. architecture, C. sculpture, D. epigraphy, E. objects in gold and silver, F. objects in bronze, G. objects in iron, H. objects in lead, I. terracotta fig- urines, K. lamps, L. bricks, M. ceramics, and N. sundry. In each category the objects of the different civilizations of North Africa are united. The collections have been much enriched by new finds and new excavations in the 33 years since the publication of the second supple- ment. The research of Poinsset and others has added much importance to the monuments. To add another supplement would have meant that for each group four volumes would have to be used. The new series, for all these reasons, plans to re- distribute all the material according to the four civili- zations of North Africa: Punic, Roman, Christian and Islamic. The published volume contains only the first part of the Punic civilization, and indeed only archi- tecture and sculpture. The architecture with 17 num- bers fills only pp. I-16 and pls. I-vii, I, the sculpture with II14 numbers the remaining 288 pages and 121 plates. Each part is preceded by a general historical introduction. The arrangement is geographical, in al- phabetical order; the first place, also containing the largest numbers of items, is Carthage. In each division the arrangement is chronological. The reviewer and probably many others not familiar with the geography of French Africa might have preferred a chronological order throughout, as the geographical arrangement leads to repetitions of the same type in different places. Each number is carefully described, dimensions, prov- enance, date, bibliography, and place of exhibition. The latter is in the most cases the Musde Alaoui. The re- viewer feels that many pages could have been saved by lumping together the types which are alike from different places and also the illustrated and the non- illustrated monuments. The catalogue might have been reduced to at least half of its size, as only about half of the monuments described are illustrated. On the other hand, the full discussion of each number is wel- come to the specialist. The number for the architectural fragments is pre- ceded by an A (instead of B), for sculpture by a C (the same as in the older catalogue). The preface for archi- tecture (pp. I-6) describes the different phases of the development and the character of the Punic architec- ture; Asiatic, Egyptian, Greek archaic to classical in- fluences, and their mixtures, are discussed. Even after the destruction of Carthage in 146 and in the imperial period this Oriental-Graeco syncretism continued. There are only a few actual architectural remains of the Punic period: Capitals of mixed Egyptian and Greek Doric form of the fifth century B.c. (A I-2); one of Doric style (A 3), four of Ionic form belonging to the fourth century (A 4-7); a pilaster with an aeolic capital (A Io), and three Ionic capitals (A 15- 17) of the Hellenistic period. Most interesting is the fragment of a frieze representing Macedonian weapons with a fine head of Artemis, dated into the first cen- tury B.c. (A 14).

I) and many votive and funeral steles representing chap- els which have been discussed under Sculpture. An excellent example of the mixture of decorative and architectural motifs coming from different sources is the little chapel dedicated to Demeter, No. Cb Io82, p. 300f, pl. cxxvii-Catalogue Musie Alaoui Supple- ment II (1922) 35, B. 142. It is dated in the first cen- tury B.c. The heavy entablature is decorated with four Greek mouldings, but crowned by an Egyptian cornice. The capitals are called here and elsewhere "archaic Corinthian" by the author (p. 6, Nos. A Io-12, pl. v; p. 32; pp. 267-72, Nos. 966-70, 972-74, 1014, pls. cIII, 2-CXVmII, I). The reviewer prefers to name them aeolic or proto-Ionic with Dinsmoor (The Architecture of Ancient Greece, 1950, p. 61, fig. 21, pl. xvIIi). The volutes leaving a triangle between them are also a Phoenician type (see Dinsmoor, pp. 58ff). The introduction to Chapter II, C, the Sculpture and Engraving on Stone (pp. 17-34) gives in contrast to the geographical arrangement of the catalogue proper an historical survey on the Punic sculpture. Madame Picard emphasizes rightly that the quality of the many thousand Punic objects is very low, in contrast to the religious interest, which has been discussed in the vol- ume Les Religions de l'Afrique antique of her hus- band Gilbert Charles Picard. The funeral monuments from the cemeteries and the votive steles from the tophets, that is, the sanctuaries of Baal Hammon and Tanit, the two main gods of the Carthaginians, show relatively little development from the sixth century B.c. to the second A.D., during which they were carved or engraved. There seems to be also little difference be- tween sculpture in the round, Nos. Ca 1-24 pls. VII 2-x i and the steles, Nos. Cb I-1090, pls. x, 2- cxxvii. The flat protomes Ca 1-3, the statues without depth Ca 9-20, are really half relief and half statue, while Ca 21 has the bust of a goddess, with the half moon behind her head, probably Tanis, absolutely carved in relief. The childish face engraved on a large pebble Ca 23 is certainly just a design, not a sculpture in the round. The votaries holding one hand before the breast with an object, and the other hand lifted in adoration, are certainly the same in the half statues as on the steles Cb 1-99, both groups dated by Madame Picard in the third to second century B.c. The same date is also given to the steles of the same kind Cb 1053-66. The oldest religious votive offerings in the sanctu- aries of Carthage and others are Betyls, mostly in the form of pillars, believed to contain sacred power, or believed to represent divine beings. They are set up in small chapels with Egyptian moulding and an Uraeus snake (Cb IoI-24, pp. 69-74; Cb 255-93, pp. Io8-I6; Cb 479-88, pp. I55-57, pls. xvmiii-xxi, xxxvIII-XLI, Lx,4- LXI). They belong to the seventh-fifth centuries B.c. Only in Sousse, where the Phoenician tradition always remained strong, there are some more elegant examples of the third century (Cb io78, p. 299, pl. cxxvi,4, and 108o, p. 300, pl. cxxvII,2). There are also instead of the pillars some crude images in the form of rectangles, losanges or hexagons beginning in the fifth century (Cb 130-36, 139-41, pp. 76-79, pls. xxH,3-4--xxIm; Cb 301-15, pp. 18-2I, pls. XLII-XLIII). In two cases (Cb 293, p. I16, pl. XLI,2 and Cb 488, p. 157, pl. LXI,2), these betyls are combined with those in the form of a pillar. Since the end of the fifth century, however, these crude symbols make place for the sun disk and the crescent, being the emblems of the two main Punic gods, Baal Hammon and Tanit. But after the begin- ning of the fourth century, all symbols for Baal Ham- mon are displaced by a geometric anthropomorphic form resembling a bottle, and for Tanit by one re- sembling the Egyptian Ankh, the sign of life. Two excellent tables show their different forms. The "bottle" of Baal disappears after the third century, but he con- tinues to be venerated in the Roman period as Saturn, particularly in Sousse. Examples of the sign of the bottle in a chapel, from Carthage, belong to the fifth or fourth centuries (Cb 141-54, PP- 79-82, pls. xxIII,4- XXVi,2; i75-93, pp. 87-92, pls. xxIx-xxxII,2; 318-33, pp. 122-25, pls. XLIV-XLVI,2). Almost all of the steles not yet mentioned show the sign of Tanit, who as Caelestis survives even the Roman destruction and Roman colony of Carthage. One stele is carved in the form of Tanit: a trapeze with the small side up, a hori- zontal stripe, indicating arms, and a circle for the head Cb 552, p. I68, pl. LXVII,I). The bottle and the Tanit sign push sun and moon into the uppermost part of the steles. It is amusing to see how sometimes the round circular head of the Tanis idol gets loose from her body and replaces the sundisk (Cb 421-25, p. 143- 44, pl. LVII and Cb 574-88, pp. 172-75, pls. LXIX, 3-4- LXXII,I). These examples all belong to the fourth cen- tury B.c. In some cases a more anthropomorphic idol is used, but I believe that all representations are ab- stract renderings of her emblem. One (C 490, p. 157, pl. LxI,4) keeps the outstretched arms of the symbol. I believe, therefore, that also on the steles from La Ghorfa (near Dougga) of the second century A.D. it is not the genius of Tanit, as the author calls it, that is represented, but only a differently stylized anthropo- morphic figure of Tanis-Caelestis. These twelve steles are the largest and richest which have been found in French Africa (Cb 963-74, pp. 262-73, pls. cII,2- cvII,I). They all have large triangular finials. Tanis holds out both arms with small cornucopias from which hang on her right side a large grape above Bacchus, and on her left side a large pomegranate above Venus, who in two cases (967-68) is accom- panied by Eros. In three cases (963-65) and in three fragments from Oudna (Cb 1072-74, pp. 297-98, pl. cxxv) Tanis-Caelestis is alone and holds the large fruits without horns of plenty. Above her are sun, moon and stars. She stands above the center of the gable roof of the aedicula, while Bacchus and Venus stand at the corners. The tympanon of the gable is filled with an eagle (966, 969), a dove (970), but mostly with a bust. Between the entablature, decor- ated with several mouldings, and the richly framed</page><page sequence="3">414 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 61 niche the ceiling is represented in the primitive per- spective which lifts it at right angles, so that it is in the same vertical plane with columns and the entabla- ture, although it ought to be at a right angle going backward. It shows coffres and in the center the sun- disk as a rosette between two crescents. The building so richly framed is called a temple by Madame Picard, but as the figure in it is rightly called the dedicator, I believe that this is a niche in a kind of tomb monu- ment, which, in Roman times, and also in other provinces, were built as large and costly as possible. The men and the female represented may be Roman- ized and rich Punic merchants or officials. I, however, do not believe that they wear the toga, as Madame Picard constantly calls the draped mantle. It is the pallium, the Roman equivalent for the Greek himat- ion. Two of the steles (973-74) have Latin inscrip- tions. The deceased, like most dedicants, hold a round object in their hands, which the authoress explains throughout as a "cassolette," a perfume vase or in- cense box. I believe I see in several cases a fruit, most likely a pomegranate, which has funereal meaning. It may have come with Demeter and Kore from southern Italy to Carthage, and was transferred to Venus. No explanation is given for the two "caryatides" (on 966, 968, 972, 973) who carry the socle on which the aedicula is resting. I believe that these stout nude women are oriental goddesses like the four at the side of the Cypriot sarcophagus in the Metropolitan Mu- seum at New York (John L. Myers, Handbook of the Cesnola Collection of Antiquities from Cyprus, 233, No. 1365 c). From the same sources may come the god holding snakes in the lowest register of 970. These lowest parts are filled on other steles with the sacrifice of a bull (963, 964, 972, 973), and on one with the fight of Herakles with a lion (971). Thus these large steles show a mixture of old oriental traditions and Graeco-Roman elements, with a peculiar flavor, which distinguishes them sharply from all other provincial sculpture of the Roman provinces. Particularly notice- able is their religious content in contrast to the more worldly scenes on tomb monuments of Gallia, Ger- mania, and the Danube valley. Beside these steles from La Ghorfa representations of Punic gods in naturalistic human form are rare. The only certain examples are from the tophet for Baal Hammon and Tanit in Sousse belonging to the fifth century B.C. (Cb 1075-77, p. 298f, pl. cxxvi): Baal on a throne, flanked by a sphinx, with a worshipper. It may be Tanit seated before an altar of incense, wrapped in her large mantle (1076-77). The latter may how- ever even be a priestess, not the goddess herself. Cer- tainly a priest with a child to be sacrificed is Cb 229, p. ioi, pl. xxxv,4. The rider (Cb 688, p. i96, pl. LXXXIV) is hardly Ares, as Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert Picard believe. Mercury appears once instead of Caelestis on one of the La Ghorfa steles (970). He is, however, very frequently represented by his herald's staff, which develops into an ornament, standing erect in pairs, flanking other symbols (Cb 596, 672-85, 803, 822, 835- 49, 934, 949, 1078). Another very frequent symbol is the open hand with part of the arm (Cb 642, 649, 658-67, 672, 677, 680- 84, 704, 708-12, 800, 807-10, 824, 835-36, 839, 849, 893, 913, 916-18). Most examples belong to the third century B.c. and are inserted in the gable of the stele. Madame Picard (p. 25f) believes that this is the hand of a godhead blessing and representing such a divinity. I believe that it means praying or adoring, as the hands of more than a hundred votaries are lifted in prayer (Cb 1-99, 1053-66). This occurs not in Tunis only but already in Cretan-Mycenean and Cypriot art. See, for example, the Cretan-Mycenean cylinders (Myers, op.cit. p. 438, Nos. 4320-21), and the late Minoan III Cretan idol from Knossos with a particularly large hand: Bossert, Altkreta, fig. 152; idem, The Art of Ancient Crete, pl. 169, fig. 293. Zervos, L'Art de la Crete, fig. 767; cf. also, figs. 771-75, 803-07. The ears on the acroteria of Cb 658, p. 189, pl. LXXIX,3 and 809, p. 218, pl. xc,4, flanking the hand in the gable, also must mean the attentive ears of the worshipper turned up to the god. Symbols of fertility used since the third century B.c. are the pomegranate (Cb 976, 983, 1005-06, 1010, 1024, Io67); branches with leaves (Cb 451, 1028, 1033); the palm tree (Cb 449, 452, 666, 671, 700, 977, 992, 1011); the pine cone (Cb 939, 1oo4-05); the fishes and dol- phins (Cb 169, 924, 965, 976, 988-89, 1004-07, 1010, 1013). The doves may be attributes of Aphrodite- Venus (Cb 684, 939, 970, 976, 980, 987-89, 993, 1010- 12, 1073). The lambs (or rams, beliers), in my opinion, are the sacrificial animals which replaced the sacrifice of children (Cb 686, 849, 853, 866). This tedious enumeration gives an idea of the rich variety of decorations on the steles in the Musde Alaoui. It would not be necessary, if an index had been added. It is to be hoped that both an index and a table of contents will be given in tome II of the new series, and that this and the following volumes will appear soon. The print of text and plates is excellent. I found only one serious misprint, p. 22, note 4, read: Olsen and Lehmann, instead of Obsen Lehmann. The pictures, mostly four to a plate, are clear. There are no refer- ences to the plates in the text, but the numbers of the catalogue are under each figure. MARGARETE BIEBER NEW YORK</page></plain_text>
