<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE WORKINGS OF FICTION IN 'LES GOMMES' Alain Robbe-Grillet has caused a major explosion of literary criticism; he has been seen as a representative of phenomenology, as an exponent of the 'language of alienation', of objectivity, subjectivity, objective subjectivity, realism, infra-realism, surrealism, 'chosisme', structuralism, and formalism. He has been admired for the psychological accuracy of his use of the 'discours de l'obsessionnel',1 and for his adaptation of the Marxist theory now known as 'reification'.2 And Les Gommes has been particularly productive of wide divergences of critical opinion. It is often treated parenthetically, as a first work not quite fitting in with any coherent exposition of the novelist's ideas. It is true that at first sight the novel poses a great number of awkward critical questions, but it seems possible to resolve many of the apparent contradictions by applying to the exegesis of the novel some of the remarks made by Robbe-Grillet in his critical writings. Les Gommes offers a sophisticated and highly ingenious prose narrative, full of punning, thematic structures, and verbal associations, further supported by two 'infra-structures' - the Oedipus myth, and the Tarot cards. Is it an elaborate and adventurous formal experiment, arising from Robbe-Grillet's desire to realize an old ambition of Flaubert's, and 'batir quelque chose a partir de rien' ?3 If so, how far can it then be seen as an effort toward a new 'realism'? How far are its complexities accidental, and how far controlled? Is it merely a novel in which Robbe-Grillet, having failed to find a form adequate to the content, therefore found it necessary to employ the Oedipus myth and the mysterious 'gomme' to draw attention to the fact that he was not writing an ordinary 'roman policier' ?4 Is it possible, in the light of Les Gommes, to reconcile Robbe-Grillet's statement: 'Le nouveau roman ne vise qu'a une subjectivite totale' . .. 5 with Roland Barthes' view that Robbe-Grillet is a resolute 'chosiste', presenting a dehumanized world of objects?6 There are clearly in Les Gommes descriptions of objects of sufficient virtuosity to give colour to the 'chosiste' view, but the neutrality of these descrip- tions is very much open to question. This view of Robbe-Grillet tends to reduce his novels to the status of gratuitous linguistic experiments - and this in turn finds encouragement in Robbe-Grillet's rejection of the idea of having 'something to say' which is said by means of the novel.7 But when Robbe-Grillet rejects the idea of separable content, he is not rejecting content, but its separability. The novel is not a means to say something preconceived but is that which it says. And it is possible to argue that Les Gommes, not apart from, but by and in its form, has much to say about human existence. One may, of course, in fleeing from the 'chosiste' view, rush to the other extreme, and see the entire novel as a sort of psycho-analyst's case-book got up to look like a novel. This offers 'subjectivite totale', but runs 1 Didier Anzieu, 'Le Discours de l'Obsessionnel dans les romans de Robbe-Grillet', Les Temps Modernes, 233 (October I965), 608-37. 2 See Lucien Goldmann, Pour une sociologie du roman (I964), Chapter on 'Nouveau roman et realite'. 8 Pour un Nouveau Roman (1963), p. 177. 4 See Goldmann, p. 197. 5 Pour un Nouveau Roman, p. 148. 6 'Litt6rature Objective', in Essais Critiques (1964). 7 Pour un Nouveau Roman, p. 51 and passim.</page><page sequence="2">VALERIE MINOGUE directly counter to Robbe-Grillet's rejection of 'la sacro-sainte psychanalyse'. The whole question of Robbe-Grillet's use of metaphor also seems to demand examination. In his account of Les Gommes, Barthes concedes the existence of one metaphor in its pages (see p. 32). John Weightman, however, points out that in this first novel, Robbe-Grillet 'even allows himself, perhaps inadvertently, a few metaphors'.1 This is to understate the case rather seriously, since even if we limit our researches to the first section of the prologue, we can find nine or ten metaphors without being excessively rigorous. The novel is full of metaphors. This suggests a disquieting gap between theory and practice on the part of Robbe- Grillet, since he has attacked Sartre and Camus for their use of metaphor to create an illusion of immanent truth, thus conniving at tragedy. 'La metaphore', he writes,.. .'n'est jamais une figure innocente'.2 One can, then, defend Robbe- Grillet's use of metaphor only if he is not trying to palm it off as a 'figure innocente' but exploring rather than concealing its 'guilt', contingence, and distortion.3 Metaphors will be valid, in Robbe-Grillet's view, if they present not intimations of immanent truth or reality, but contingent facts about particular consciousnesses, with no pretentions to universal assent. If this is true, as I hope to show, we may see Robbe-Grillet as presenting not a subjectivity, but many subjectivities. It then seems less strange that he should be seen by some as an 'objective' writer, since there is no single affectivity or conscious- ness informing the entire text, but conflicting juxtapositions of many. And when, for instance in the later novel, La Jalousie, there is one subjectivity, the distorted nature of its version of reality - the only version available - is made apparent. The author avoids complicity with it, and there is no danger (if we read with any attention) of our mistaking this version for a neutral objective Reality such as might be seen by God. Where one may reasonably part company with Barthes' view of Robbe-Grillet's objectivity, is when he writes of'l'apprehension optique qui regne partout' (p. 32), without acknowledging that, as Christine Brooke-Rose4 and others have pointed out, the movements of this 'apprehension optique' are in themselves a communica- tion of a particular consciousness. Since one cannot nowadays describe a 'character' as if it were some sort of solid containing vessel, the only way of communicating an inner world is by communicating its apprehension of the world in which it finds itself.5 All discourse, even when it strives to be neutral, rational, or geometrical, reflects certain dispositions in the discourser. Language, itself constructed on metaphor, betrays willy-nilly our 'version' of the world, of experience, of ourselves. The very act of seeing is a selective process, and when Matthias in Le Voyeur sees his piece of string as 'soigneusement roulee en forme de huit, avec quelques spires 1 J. G.

Perceiving the patterns of his 'apprehension optique', we can recognize their subjectivity. Similarly the bits of debris in the canal in Les Gommes may appear from time to time to be the Sphinx, or a map of America, or the face of a clown. Each 'version' debunks the other, none is allowed any absolute status: in this way, the novelist strives to reach neutrality by an equilibrium of possibilities. What is more perplexing is that Robbe-Grillet, having rejected tragedy and 'les vieux mythes de la profondeur', should use in Les Gommes not only a pre- fabricated set of symbolic significances (the Tarot cards) but also a tragic myth. Robbe-Grillet's grateful comment to Bruce Morrissette for his well-modulated exposition of the Oedipus theme: 'Vous m'avez sauve du symbolisme en inventant la "correlation objective" 2 does not entirely remove one's uneasiness. It is even more worrying to read, on a writer who explicitly and decisively rejects the 'univers entierement tragifie'3 of Camus and Sartre, such comments as these: 'Tous les heros de Robbe-Grillet sont les victimes d'une connivence tragique' . . . (Stoltzfus);4 or Wallas, described by Yvonne Guers as finally killing a man whom 'lafatalite, grace a des coincidences insolites, lui reservait comme victime' ... ;5 or Bruce Morrissette, summing up the action of Les Gommes, and pointing out that between the beginning and the end of the novel 'le destin se trouve ineluctablement modifie' (p. 37); while Les Gommes, for Lucien Goldmann is 'un livre dont le contenu essentiel s'apparente a celui de la tragedie antique'.6 (My italics in all quotations above.) This is all very awkward when the novelist claims to be adopting an anti-tragedy stance. Is it simply that Robbe-Grillet, in his first novel, has not succeeded in overcoming the difficulty he himself ascribes to the effort to 'se liberer soi-meme du conditionnement a la tragedie que nous impose notre civilisation mentale'?7 And finally, there is the vexing and much-vexed question of the significance, if any, of the 'gomme'. We have here a novel which uses, even if in an unusual way, the form of the 'roman policier', and moves to a 'trick ending' - which is not what one would expect from a writer distrustful of literary conventions, and bent on creating a new 'realism'. Moreover it is a novel, written by an 'anti-tragic', 'anti-psychological', 'anti-significant' novelist, in which a man searching for a mysterious 'gomme' moves, complete with Oedipus complex and the symbolic system of the Tarot cards, to an apparently tragic destiny. It seems possible, however, to propose an interpretation of Les Gommes which will reconcile these apparent contradictions. Fictionality If we take seriously the statement of Robbe-Grillet that in the modern novel 'l'invention, l'imagination, deviennent a la limite le sujet du livre', then the very 1 Le Voyeur, Edition de Minuit (1955), p.

It may indeed offer access to the core of the novel, and suggest at least plausible coherence where incoherence or gratuitous mystification have often been imputed. For Les Gommes seems precisely a novel in which the processes of invention, linked with experiential problems of language and knowledge, become the very subject of the book.' One obvious sign of the emphasis on fictionality is in the extensive use of terms such as 'sc6ne', 'decor', 'texte', 'romanesque', etc. The invented quality of the recit is underlined right from the prologue, which begins with a penombre, in which the patron, 'unique personnage present en scene' performs the opening gestures. Everything is still out of reach of the confusion which will be brought by the day about to begin. Things are still free of human conscious- ness. The 'patron' - and given Robbe-Grillet's liking for punning, would it really be far-fetched to take the word also in the meaning of 'pattern' or 'model'? - still has 'le regard vide'. The whole scene is presented like the twilight of a stage, before the curtains go up: 'Un bras machinal remet en place le decor. Quand tout est pret, la lumiere s'allume.'2 Such theatrical metaphors recur throughout the novel,3 keeping the reader constantly reminded that this is a fiction, maintaining a deliberate effect of performance and artificiality. There is little risk of our taking this to be an ordinary 'roman policier', when we are so directly involved in Robbe- Grillet's highly conscious explorations of the genre. We are not being offered what the detective novel usually offers - a pseudo-reality more amenable to logic and rationality than the one we know. Instead, the genre itself is undermined by the realism of the narrative - a tentative realism in which we are made aware of scenes, suppositions, memories, incidents, and people as possibilities, or more accurately, plausibilities, rather than fixed realities. The reader is forced, like the protagonists, to make plausible constructions out of confusing and contradictory sets of appearances. What is read in the newspaper, within the novel, may be lies, as in the report of Daniel Dupont's death, or mistake, as in the report of Albert Dupont's death. But the deaths are written, and appear to have the same chance of turning out equally true - or of course equally false. In terms of the novel, what is written - is. The emphasis on fictionality comes to the fore when Garinati goes over his failed assassination of Dupont. The passage suggests the hypnotic quality of language and remembered phrases, but also insinuates a decalage between the geometry of 'objective' description, in which 'la ligne droite est le plus court chemin d'un point a un autre', and the fluctuations of subjectivity. On the stairs of the house, on which he has already received a detailed written report, Garinati's footsteps fall softly, leaving no mark on the surface of the oceans: 1 Though Les Gommes has not, to my knowledge, been discussed in this light, Dans le Labyrinthe has been interpreted by Bruce Morrissette as 'une serie d'hypotheses, de tentatives de reconstruction fictive, mais vraisemblable', (p. 159), and elsewhere, he has defined the nouveau roman as a 'novel which defines itself in its own creative process' ('The New Novel in France', Chicago Review, 15 ( 962), p. 8). Christine Brooke-Rose has examined the structural role of analogies in Dans le Labyrinthe in 'L'Imagination Baroque de Robbe-Grillet', and Gerard Genette has discussed Robbe-Grillet's 'procedes de construction thematique' in 'Sur Robbe-Grillet', Tel Quel, 8 (I962) (reprinted under the title 'Vertige Fixe', at the end of the I964 edition of Dans le Labyrinthe). 2 Les Gommes, Edition de Minuit (I953), p. i. Later references are to this edition. 3 E.g., p. 127: 'd'ailleurs Wallas a deja quitte le petit cafe pour rentrer en scene'; p. 25I: the precautions of Dupont in opening the door- 'cette petite comedie'; p. 247: Dupont in dark glasses like 'un traitre de melodrame', etc. 28</page><page sequence="5">434 The Workings of Fiction in 'Les Gommes' Dans ce ddcor fixe par la loi ... l'acteur brusquement s'arrete, au milieu d'une phrase ... II le sait par cceur, ce role qu'il tient chaque soir; mais aujourd'hui il refuse d'aller plus loin. Autour de lui les autres personnages se figent ... I1 faudrait faire quelque chose maintenant, prononcer des paroles quelconques, des mots qui n'appartiendraient pas au livret ... Mais comme chaque soir, la phrase commencde s'acheve, dans la forme prescrite... (p. 23) This passage gives both the effect of a theatrical performance, and an awareness of the book, the Jbrme prescrite which is guiding the action. I do not believe that all this is the result of an arbitrary choice of words, but that the decor is quite precisely 'fix6 par la loi', and that Garinati is here playing, on the stage of the novel, a fixed conventional role from which he cannot escape: that the prologue is here postula- ting the act on which the novel centres - the assassination of Dupont. Les Gommes would thus be most exactly an 'ante-novel', to borrow Bernard Pingaud's term,l in so far as it follows out the processes a crime-novelist might follow before writing his novel. First, he must postulate a crime. Robbe-Grillet does this, using the conventional shabby figure with the foreign name as hired assassin. But as this postulate is explored, i.e. written, the language begins to create insidious changes. New patterns emerge. The convention, as represented by Garinati, is at a loss when faced with solid objects not anticipated. The colour of the carpet, the picture of the Tower on the wall, had not been allowed for - Bonaventure (cf. 'tirer la bonne aventure') had not taken account of them. The hazards of reality begin to interpose themselves between the convention and its supposedly inexorable course. When the convention acquires language, it becomes invention. A dicalage occurs and is noted: we must start again. What has happened is that the description has imported new material into the convention - miscellaneous objects and the twenty-one stairs corresponding to the twenty-one Tarot cards,2 and the fiction responds to the dynamism of the language in which it now exists. To Garinati, the conventional assassin, knowing neither doubt nor fear, the objects remain disturbing but irrelevant, Gradually, and as if by contamination from the inventing mind, he moves to a recognition of his failure and anticipation of 'un autre a sa place'. Garinati, the mechanical figure, having attempted to evade his literary 'destiny' gives way to Wallas - but at the end of the novel, it will be as if Garinati had killed Dupont, and Garinati himself will believe this. Once the world is seen as more than anthropomorphic background, or conventional 'd6cor', it imposes itself with all the creative force of reality. The convention cannot survive in this reality, and from his own point of view, Garinati fails, but in so doing, temporarily escapes from his appointed role.3 The prologue ends with a recapitulation of some of the details and facts - the words - which have emerged out of the description, and with an implicit 'gommage'. Garinati is to be replaced, and there follows the elliptical statement: 'Wallas. "Agent Special" '. 1 Bernard Pingaud, 'The School of Refusal', Midnight Novelists, rale French Studies, 24 (Summer I959), pp. I8-21: 'It might be said that what the new novelists describe or relate is what takes place before the novel in the classic sense has begun . . ' (p. 21). 2 The Oedipus theme and the use of the Tarot cards have both been examined by Bruce Morrissette, Les Romans de Robbe-Grillet. 3 If we see Garinati as achieving a kind of 'liberty' by his failure to respond to the objects and directives by which he is surrounded, the situation suggests an interesting gloss on Sartre's statement -'nous ne sommes separes des choses par rien, sinon par notre liberte' (L'Etre et le Niant, quoted by Renato Barilli, 'De Sartre a Robbe-Grillet', in Un Nouveau Roman?, p. 123).</page><page sequence="6">VALERIE MINOGUE 435 He is to be brought in by the novelist to accomplish the act postulated. But he will have to take account both of the failed act, which now exists in the novel, and of the failed assassin who continues to exist, and will eventually be convinced that he was in fact the assassin. Wallas's watch is stopped to mark the point of time at which he became necessary - the point of failure and beginning again, at which he was invented to perform the act on which the novel centres. The assassination is the postulate against which Wallas tries to play, but cannot win. The novel becomes a sort of chess-game in which the novelist plays the consciousness of Wallas against the language in which he is written. Wallas's perception is limited by an in-built set of patterns, and the whole of the fiction of Les Gommes conspires against him, pointing the finger, slyly insinuating that he is the assassin: Wallas is precisely 'framed' by the novelist. He is recognized by witnesses; he is in possession of a gun which appears to be the murder-weapon; he is given an identity-card which in his view does not resemble him. He is victimized by a 'complex' which will conspire to lead him to his 'destiny', and by 'prophecies' and 'oracles' arising out of the language in which he is enmeshed. He is even allowed to recognize his own inadequacy: he lacks the vital frontal centimetre - the extra dimension of'real' rather than invented identity - the dimension which might mean freedom. Finally he is deprived of his railway ticket, the last proof of his innocence. Robbe-Grillet forces his 'murderer' to commit murder, just as a crime-novelist, though less consciously, would do, and explores the relations between the 'murderer' and the literary 'destiny' in which he is trapped. We can see Wallas then as the victim of the invention. He has to pick his way through labyrinths of language, as through the streets of the town. He is constantly threatened by error and confusion; he is trying to steer a straight course on what is a circular path leading to a reconstruction of the beginning. Wallas is not a mere hired assassin; he is granted intelligence, and the advantages and disadvantages of human consciousness. His problem is one of escape, and his own consciousness is made to betray him. The irrelevancies and objects of the world he is made to inhabit correspond and conspire with his own disposition to see relevance and significance, and with patterns generated in his own mind. In his involvement with the 'destiny' which awaits him in the novel, and in his determination to find the murderer who will be himself, he plays the part of Oedipus. But more than that, he is also playing the part of any man in the world, seeking his identity and freedom in the midst of a proliferation of systems, significances, and confusions - man at grips with the 'conditionnement a la tragedie' imposed by language. Fiction and consciousness Wallas, or the Wallas-dynamism,1 replacing the Garinati mechanism, becomes the centre of a series of explorations of human understanding, and of human relations I Gerard Genette describes this type of subjectivity as 'un principe morphologique.. . [qui] . . permet d'organiser le monde visible selon des rapports d'analogie qui appartiennent en principe a l'univers interieur, ou peut-etre simplement a l'espace du langage'. Hazel E. Barnes ('The Ins and Outs of Robbe-Grillet', Chicago Review, 15 (1962), p. 21) describes the 'I' of La Jalousie as 'not an original structure of consciousness, but an ideal pole of experiences, a point of reference gradually emerging as the result of the consciousness' reflection upon its own awareness. It is never at any time identical with consciousness . . '.</page><page sequence="7">436 The Workings of Fiction in 'Les Gommes' with language and meanings. As a 'subjectivity-in-course-of-creation', Wallas is at the mercy of patterns generated by the language in which he is written. The result is a constant tension between Wallas's efforts at self-determination and the pre-existent systems of the world he has to inhabit. As a representative of human consciousness, he has to deal with mechanical defects in his own mental equipment - and in that of others - caused by fatigue, hunger, deafness, etc. He is also a victim of error and sometimes of deliberate misdirection. In order to make his way through the maze, he must discard certain streets just as he must erase implausibilities or irrelevancies in his quest for a solution. He is always liable to make gross errors of discrimination - for instance, each time he approaches truth, he tries to buy a 'gomme', as if seeking to erase it.1 Many things distort his judgment; he is limited by inadequate memory, by inaccurate perception, by the limited language available to him, and by his incom- plete understanding of himself. He is in fact determined by his language, and Les Gommes is in this sense a novel in which 'la parole s'accomplira'. Robbe-Grillet has himself made the point that there is in the nouveau roman a new kind of narrator--'ce n'est plus celui qui d6crit les choses qu'il voit, mais en meme temps celui qui invente les choses autour de lui et qui voit les choses qu'il invente'.2 Invention plays a dynamic and explicit part in the whole novel. Juard, for instance, repeats to Wallas his false account of the 'death' of Dupont: 'cette fiction a pris peu a peu suffisamment de poids dans son esprit pour lui dicter automatiquement les bonnes reponses; elle continue d'elle-meme a s6creter ses propres precisions et incertitudes - tout comme ferait la realit .. .' (p. 213). Fiction and reality are not easily separable, and the act of examining them is liable to blur the distinction still further.3 There is a constant passage from 'knowledge' to fiction, and vice versa.4 Understanding depends upon re-construction (plausible re-invention) just as prediction depends upon plausible pre-invention. There is, paradoxically, no present in such a scheme, and yet nothing but present - a present which might be described as a flow between past and future in both directions.5 This flow is largely explained by the tendency of each invention to generate its own history, functions, and extensions. Similarly, each word is likely to start its own system,6 but while it may be a key-word or 'clue', it may also be simply an 1 He is caught in an impasse, where what officially he is striving to discover coincides with what he profoundly does not want to know. 2 Pour un Nouveau Roman, p. 177. 3 E.g. when Madame Bax is interrogated by Wallas, she remarks 'Vous finiriez par me faire croire que j'ai assiste a tout le drame'. 4 E.g. Bona plays out his reconstruction of the sound of Garinati's footsteps on the stairs, and realizes that this interpretation of what he has heard has become implausible: 'I1 est impossible de confondre plus longtemps Garinati avec cette fiction' (p. 99). 5 It is perhaps this quality that leads J. H. Matthews to comment: 'Robbe-Grillet se complait dans un present total, mais ce present abstrait comme mort, en est-il encore un?' (Un Nouveau Roman?, p. 22). 6 See Christine Brooke-Rose (Un Nouveau Roman?, p. 132): 'Robbe-Grillet utilise l'analogie ... de maniere si complexe qu'elle devient un procedd structural.' See also Philippe Sollers, 'Sept Propositions sur Alain Robbe-Grillet', Tel Quel, 2 (I960), p. 49: 'I1 semble que certains elements "s'appellent" l'un l'autre par une necessite de structure.'</page><page sequence="8">VALERIE MINOGUE 437 'accident' with no particular structural significance,l like the phrase in the 'Attention Citoyens!' notice, which 'semble un instant cacher beaucoup de choses, ou rien du tout' (p. 53). Wallas is himself directly threatened by this danger of misinterpretation. He must try to avoid making errors of this kind, and he is also forced to meet the difficult problem of regulating the part he will play as an object in the fictions or constructions of others. He has to explore the patterns generated by his own actions: and he is concerned, naturally enough, to limit and focus 'correctly' the inter- pretations of himself made by others - for instance that he is Garinati, or a man from the post-office. This he tries to do by anticipating and forestalling false constructions, but he is undermined by his own uncertainties, which blur the edges of fiction and reality for him, and confuse his own constructions with the constructions of others,2 as of course, ultimately, he is entirely the construction of another. In the 'Papeterie Victor Hugo', we see Wallas divided between his desire for the elusive 'gomme', and his interest in the photograph in the shop-window. He reflects that if he continues in this way, it will look as if he were simply curious (for possibly sinister reasons) about the photograph, and were merely using the 'gomme' as a cover-story. So he buys a type of india-rubber that he doesn't at all want. There is nothing 'inhuman' about this sequence: we see Wallas performing an irrational action for the sake of the greater plausibility of the identity he has for others, that is, in the constructions of others. He does not want to appear to have asked for an 'objet fictif, attribue a une marque mythique', (p. I33) which is in fact a very precise description of the object in question. When Wallas asks a policeman the way to the post-office, he omits to mention that he intends to go to the clinic first. He realizes that if he now follows his original intention, he will appear to be ignoring the directions given - 'il aura l'air d'un fou, d'un idiot, ou d'un mauvais plaisant'. He is constrained by the threat of false constructions to change course and go to the post-office first. Wallas's efforts to maintain his own version of himself are paradoxically dominated by his fear of the versions of others, of the fictions by which he is surrounded. His imagining of the constructions of others is as dynamic as any reality. In order to account for his going to one post-office rather than another, Wallas invents the notion that he wants the 'poste restante'. When he reaches the post- office, the girl at the 'poste-restante' counter, immediately 'recognizes' him, and gives him a letter. The fiction is now operating as a reality, as, in terms of the novel, it 1 A number of 'sub-systems' are generated, and woven into the fabric until they peter out, or are taken over by more dominant patterns. E.g. the espionage theme: the Cafe des Allies, the exotic name Garinati, the 'agent special', the rue de Berlin - which seems in turn to generate a man who looks like Fabius, reference to Fabius's wartime exploits in counter-espionage, the Bureau des Enquetes described as first set up for counter-espionage, the signal-knock on Bona's door - un coup sec, trois coups rapides, (B for Bona?), which, when the line continues, becomes trois coups rapides, un coup sec (the wartime V?). Similarly a set of water-allusions: the patron in his aquarium, the canals, baleines, the rue de Jonas, sirenes, boats, hulk of an old sailing-boat recalled by Wallas, water as 'eau de sommeil' and 'lac natal' (and one may also remember the alternative meaning of Oedipus - Oedipais: 'son of the swelling sea' and the alternative version of the story, in which Oedipus is lowered into the sea in a chest, and then washed ashore (see Robert Graves, The Greek Myths, 2 vols. (Harmondsworth, 1955), I, I3), and the name Wallas itself- une wallace? 2 Hazel E. Barnes, in her comments on Le Voyeur, notes the influence of the interpretations of outside agents on the life and perceptions of the protagonist (p. 27).</page><page sequence="9">The Workings of Fiction in 'Les Gommes' must do. One may also see in this process a corruption inherent in self-consciousness -the projection of a 'plausible' self, not finally distinguishable from the 'real' self. A similar situation occurs when Wallas asks a woman the way. Here, the phrase 'Voila le chien-dent' seems to have generated a woman with a brush from which 'quelques brins de chien-dent' stick out. Wallas puts his question in such a way that the woman does not understand him. Indeed, he does not want to put it clearly, since the truth - that he is a detective, looking for a police-station - is rather implausible. Every explanation gives rise to further questions till he is enmeshed in a whole setoffictions.Wallas wonders why it is that he feels called upon to explain his every move, but these explanations are dictated by his need for 'vraisemblance' and his 'desir de rester dans une neutralite commode'. Besides, he is playing a role in the novel that he does not intend, and is constantly trying to prove that he is other than the whole of the fiction would have him. Lies generate lies, fiction, further fiction, but 'la parole est verite', and Wallas cannot escape. Our attention is focussed simultaneously on the act of detection - an act of reconstruction based on plausibility - and Wallas's effort to maintain a plausible identity. It becomes clear that the detective is not a special case, divorced from ordinary experience, but an archetype of the difficulties of finding coherence in life, other people, and ourselves.' Wallas's understanding of himself is continually threatened by other people's incredulity or other people's mistakes. When he encounters Madame Smite, her errors in assuming he is from the post-office, has called in at various bars, and has come from a 'maison de sante' make him decidedly uneasy (pp. 88-9). This is not his own version of his activities but it has a certain plausibility. An even more dramatic confrontation of the power of fiction and the concern with plausibility comes when Wallas has to offer his version of the assassination of Dupont to Laurent. Wallas reflects on the 'histoire de societe secrete' - the official story - as 'mal inventee', and observes 'le caractere incroyable de son recit'. There is almost a recognition on Wallas's part that he is being manipulated, and that he has been left defenceless by his author. The effect of Laurent's incredulity on Wallas is to 'aneantir la vraisemblance de ses con- structions'. Since Wallas's fictional life might be taken as largely dependent on 'vraisemblance', it is not unnatural that at such a moment he feels 'tout a coup menace jusque dans son existence' (p. I76). The growing implausibility of his own version and the increasing plausibility of another version (in which he will eventually play the murderer) account for his feeling threatened. Wallas is led to reflect that like the story he tells, he too may be 'une pure creation d'un ministre a l'esprit trop fertile'. The 'gomme' It is a nice irony when a novelist's 'hero' reflects on his own implausibility, and fears for his life, and particularly so when he has been involved in a search for a 1 Jean V. Alter ('L'Enquete Policiere dans le Nouveau Roman: "La Mise en Scene" de Claude Oilier', in Un Nouveau Roman?, p. 89) describes the function of the detective in the nouveau roman in this way: 'Grace a lui, un ordre possible s'introduit dans le mystere, mais il n'est, lui-meme, jamais en cause. Son apport principal est de servir de trait d'union entre le lecteur et la situation qu'il s'agit de debrouiller.' This makes an important point, but Wallas far from being 'jamais en cause' is almost always 'en cause'. In the same article, Alter also summarizes the attractions of the crime-novel for the new writers - 'le crime est bien la forme la plus parfaite de l'enigme, le detective un anti- heros ideal, l'enquete un moyen commode de saisir la realite ... ' (p. Io2). 438</page><page sequence="10">VALERIE MINOGUE 439 'gomme' which might well be the instrument he, as a character 'en cours de creation' most has to fear. But the 'gomme' is also a possible means of escape from the language of the novelist, which is both creating Wallas and annihilating his freedom. One could explain the 'constante d'auto-destruction' which Morrissette has noted in Wallas, as deriving from Wallas's effort to shake off the 'complex' and the destiny imposed upon him by the novel. The 'gomme' would offer a direct way of escaping the novelist's dictation - even though it would be at the cost of the hero's entire existence. Furthermore, the 'gomme' itself would have to disappear without trace, leaving nothing by which the fiction might be reconstituted: it must be a 'gomme' which, 'en effa(ant, s'efface'. Admittedly, the possibilities of meaning of the 'gomme' are manifold,' but it seems to derive its perhaps rather skittish existence from the central theme of the novel - the processes of composition, in which erasure plays a necessary part. It belongs to the terminology in which Robbe-Grillet has elsewhere described the act of composition - 'construire en detruisant' - 'double mouvement de creation et de gommage'.2 One need then neither look for obscure symbolism, nor fall back on the idea of wilful anti-symbolism, but turn to Robbe-Grillet's own statement that 'chaque objet ... est en effet son propre symbole',3 and see the 'gomme' as in fact a symbol, both of itself as a tactile object, and of its normal function of erasing, whether this is seen as a means of freedom, an act of destruction, or both. As an object, the 'gomme' is mocked by its opposite, the black cube, the paperweight. The cube too, is connected with papers and literature, but is there, present, not suspended like the 'gomme' between memory and desire. The association of the 'gomme' and the paperweight is made clear by the language - Morrissette has drawn attention to the contrast suggested between them. The sides of the cube are smooth, its 'aretes effacees', but it is hard and solid, meant for holding things down rather than erasing them. At the end of the novel, however, when Wallas is about to kill Dupont, the corners of the cube are 'meurtriers', and its 'aretes vives'; the cube is not now 'deforme'.4 The 'c6ne de metal noir' - the bullet - is also assimilable into this series, and this is clearly murderous. 1 See Roland Barthes, p. 32; 'la gratuite mysterieuse de l'objet qui donne son titre au livre comme un scandale ou une enigme . . . '; and J. G. Weightman, p. 241: 'The india-rubbers must be anti- symbols, put in to show that we should not go looking for symbols.' 2 Pour un Nouveau Roman, pp. I 60, 163. Compare Roland Barthes' account of the status of literature as 'ordre formel dans lequel le sens est a la fois pose et deCu' (p. 196). 3 Pour un Nouveau Roman, p. 16. 4 There is a suggestive similarity between the description of the cube and the imagery used by Robbe-Grillet to describe the solidity of the 'phrase prononcee': 'Rien ne sera donc trop fort pour isoler cette parole, pour lui rendre ses faces vives et ses ar6tes' (quoted by Morrissette, Les Romans de Robbe-Grillet, p. 28). It is also possible that the black cube is associated with card 15 of the Tarot pack - Fatality, or the Devil ('the father of lies'?) -which represents the Devil on a black cube to which a man and woman are chained (as described by Petr D. Uspensky in Chapter v of A New Model of the Universe ( 93 1) ). A cube of illusion? lies? - can we add 'fiction'? It is at least suggestive in so far as the cube may represent the murderous corners of fiction and fatality, and the gomme the desire to escape from the dangers of fiction. Such complex combinations are frequent in the novel - the 'char grec' which Wallas sees in the square also suggests a Tarot card. The addition of 'V. Daulis, sculpteur' sets us off on the track of the Oedipus myth, but it can equally well represent card 7 of the Tarot pack, the Chariot, or Maison Dieu, usually paired with card I6, the Tower, represented in the novel by the picture over the sixteenth stair. Robbe-Grillet seems to load his objects with symbolic associations, thus making concrete the range and nature of Wallas's perception and consciousness, and simultaneously setting up a subconscious resonance in the mind of the reader.</page><page sequence="11">The Workings of Fiction in 'Les Gommes' The idea of'gommage' is suggestive of the way in which Robbe-Grillet uncovers the patterns inherent in language, and in so doing, limits their power to generate false profundities. By exploring the domination of language, he refuses, as a writer, to be exploited by it: by perceiving the latent patterns in the language, he is able to erase where necessary and thus control. And in reverse, Wallas is unable to escape the grip of the Oedipus myth since, though he tries to evade it, he is not sufficiently aware of it to prevent its distorting his language and dictating his actions. From the first appearance of the 'sujet allegorique' in the curtains, with their picture of the shepherds finding the infant Oedipus, it is made clear that Wallas regards himself as totally in control of himself and his situation. This is expressed in highly suggestive language, playing off his false confidence against the persistence of the myth in the background. Wallas has the illusion of continuity and logic: his movement, he thinks, is not 'une succession d'images deraisonnables et sans rapport entre elles' - such as the curtains might represent to him - but 'un ruban uni' (as opposed to the patterned curtains). Moreover, he sees it as a 'ruban' in which 'chaque element se place aussitot dans la trame . . . c'est bien lui [Wallas] qui s'avance; c'est a son propre corps qu'appartient ce mouvement, non a la toile de fond' (again the curtains-and implicitly, the fabric of the novel?)' que delacerait un machiniste' .. . (the novelist?) 'C'est volontairement qu'il marche vers un avenir inevitable et parfait'. He sees no conflict between 'volontairement' and 'inevitable'. 'Autrefois il lui est arrive trop souvent de se laisser prendre aux cercles du doute et de l'impuissance' (p. 52). But it is at the very moment of this self-affirmation that he finds himself to his astonishment, back on the 'Boulevard Circulaire' - on the closed circuit of the novel. What seems most exciting in Les Gommes is this simultaneous exploration of the dynamism of language and the problems of individual human experience. There is no fixed 'reality' in the novel, and no 'ordonnance ideale' such as might be imagined in the object world, devoid of consciousness. We cannot be conscious without being conscious of something, but we cannot be objects; our consciousness separates us from them, while offering also our only means of access to them.1 We are faced in the world by an apparent solidity, with which we have to come to terms. Geometrical notations serve as a rationalization, an ordering of the universe, an attempt to restore to objects their 'objectivity'. We are liable always to be deceived by our angle of sight, but Robbe-Grillet emphasizes the point that 'la subjectivite relative de mon regard me sert precisement a definir ma situation dans le monde',2 that is, to grasp objectively a spatial relationship of which the 'moi' is but one term. One of the difficulties Robbe-Grillet explores is that of distinguishing between what we regard as 'system' (part of a causal chain, like the 'clue' of detective fiction, or of a set of associations like the Oedipus myth, or Tarot cards), and what we regard as accident (the 'petite faille', the 'defaut'). Who is to say which is the 1 And objects will be a means of access to thought. See Bruce Morrissette, p. 75: 'des motifs comme celui d'Oedipe dans Les Gommes trouveront leur expression dans le monde exterieur des objets neutres, car de tels objets sont le seul moyen pour l'homme d'acceder a la pensee, a la vie affective, a l'action m6me dans un univers de phdnom6nologie existentielle.' 2 Pour un Nouveau Roman, p. 82. 440o</page><page sequence="12">VALERIE MINOGUE 44I system and which is the accident? Does an accident betray a system, or perhaps even invent one? When we find an incoherence, we may equally well be on the edge of discovering (or inventing) a new coherence, in the light of which our first notions will be discarded. The perception of patterns depends on the time - and the place - at which we stand, and there is always the effect of the act of observing to be taken into account.1 We may see the Sphinx in the floating rubbish,2 and hear an oracle in the station loudspeaker. This may not tell us much about the rubbish or the loudspeaker; it says a lot about us. In an a-temporal world, common-sense notions of cause and effect break down, and language constitutes its own logic. The attempt to find a solution for a crime believed to have been committed has a similar structure to the effort to predict what will happen. The 'solution' of the murder in crime-novels is usually sought by reconstruction of the crime in terms of plausible causes, that is, by a reversal of normal time-sequence, and sets of plausible retrospective predictions, set out as 'motives'. If we ignore ordinary chronology, and maintain the chronology of these processes, we have the chronology of Les Gommes, in which these processes and their relations with language and construction are explored. I do not wish at all to suggest a 'reconstruction' of the novel - 'ce serait l'effacer', as Gerard Genette has warned - but to suggest a possible means of approach to the inner tensions of a novel which explores the dynamism of fiction, mocks its own creator, its detective 'hero', and its would-be detective readers. We are left at the end of it with a sense of manifold possibilities, and the warning that associating an object with some ready-made system does not change the irreducible presence and possibilities of the object, nor offer anything we could call the Meaning. The world of Les Gommes is sometimes a puzzling one, but it is not 'inhuman'. On the contrary, it deals with some of the central problems of human consciousness and apprehension of reality. The image of consciousness in the novel is rather of a defective and erratic machine, surrounded by chaos, and unaware of its own boundaries. It is liable to interruption, and to being taken over by the power of other machines; liable also to operate on a short circuit, reflecting and recording endlessly nothing at all but itself. The novel returns at the end to a sea of dimly perceptible forms - are these forms the inventions of our pattern-making impulses? We need them, but the world threatens at every moment to escape our systems and our forms, and we are not sure whether we are looking at the Sphinx, the map of America, or just odd bits of rubbish and orange peel. The patron returns at the end to the aquarium, the patron dissolves, vainly protesting, 'le patron c'est moi le patron ... le patron ... le patron . . ' surrounded by 'ombres furtives' and 'spectres familiers' which waltz about him 'comme de la poussiere dans le soleil, comme les petits bateaux perdus sur la mer, qui bercent au gre de la houle leur cargaison fragile, les vieux tonneaux, les poissons morts, les poulies et les cordages, les bouees, le pain rassis, les couteaux et les hommes' (p. 264). The whole construction is dissolved in this final 'gommage'; the world returns, suggestive, but inaccessible to meaning. 1 See Christine Brooke-Rose, 'Dynamic Gradients', pp. 90-2. 2 The image of the Sphinx is used elsewhere by Robbe-Grillet (Pour un Nouveau Roman, p. 65) in a related intellectual context - a passage in which he is concerned to reject the 'metaphysical pact' between man and the world.</page><page sequence="13">The Workings of Fiction in 'Les Gommes' Whatever the weaknesses of the novel, its strength lies mainly in its poetic exploration of the processes of perception, understanding, and invention, and in its capacity for involving the reader in the act of creation.1 Its less tightly organized form allows a more considerable insight into the novelist's techniques and creative processes than is afforded by the denser structures of the later novels. It reveals more clearly than they, and in a less resolved state, what Genette has described (p. 305) as 'le conflit entre une intelligence positiviste et une imagination foncierement poetique', and it explores the shadow-land between the writer and his fictions. Les Gommes is not then, an early aberration. In Wallas, Robbe-Grillet has created not a tragic hero, but a parody of a tragic hero, a doomed figure whose doom is a literary one, consciously willed by his creator.2 The dimensions of tragedy are cut away, first by deliberate parody, through the detective novel, and secondly by the very act of investigating the circumstances and procedures by which the 'tragic hero' is forced to commit his 'tragic act' - an act which is not itself granted either profundity or significance.3 Les Gommes is, in this way, an irreverent exploration of the dynamism of the Oedipus myth and the symbolism of the Tarot cards, and an exposure of the conditioning power of language itself. The main object of interest in this novel is not fatality, nor the sense of tragedy, but the operations of language and the tricks of the tragedian.4 V VALERIE MINOGUE LONDON 1 So involved does the reader become that the 'il' of the novel seems vital, the first person being more likely to exclude the reader's active participation - See Bruce Morrissette, 'De Stendhal a Robbe-Grillet: Modalites du "Point de Vue" ', Cahiers de L'Association des Etudes Franfaises, 14 (I962), p. I56. Didier Anzieu (p. 6 I) comments on the reader's being placed in a new relation to the novel 'Le lecteur devient l'interlocuteur du heros ou du narrateur. Le narrateur essaie de faire entrer le lecteur, par le roman qu'il lui raconte, dans le jeu de sa nevrose'. It is tempting to reverse Roland Barthes' description (p. 17) of the 'Je' de l'ecrivain as an 'II' au second degre, an 'II' - retourne: Robbe-Grillet's 'I1' would here be a 'Je' retourne, a 'Je' au second degre. 2 Robert Champigny, ('In Search of the Pure Recit', American Society Legion of Honor Magazine (Winter 1956), p. 334) compares Les Gommes with Kafka's Castle, in which he says, 'the senselessness of the human gesture is set against a mysterious transcendental order'. 'Les Gommes', he adds, 'suggests nothing of the sort'. In fact, Les Gommes plays off the 'human gesture' against the workings of a literary order unfolded before our eyes. 3 One can see in Robbe-Grillet's novels as a whole an attempt to face up to, and in this way undermine, the 'determinism' of the novel. He seems to write with a constant sense that 'le heros litteraire est en profondeur surd6terminee par le decor', that 'La grammaire est le premier deter- minisme', and that 'tout destin est un discours'. (As expressed by Gilbert Durand, commenting on determinism in the 'romanesque' in Le Decor Mythique de la Chartreuse de Parme (I96I), pp. 21 and 43.) 4 Since this article was written, I have read the lucid and penetrating study by O. Bernal - Alain Robbe-Grillet: le roman de l'absence (I964). Madame Bernal, starting from quite different and more philosophical preoccupations has arrived at very similar general conclusions to those expressed in this article. In the two chapters (pp. 43-97) devoted to Les Gommes - 'Les Gommes, roman de liquida- tion' and 'Langage resu et parole neutre', this critic presents Wallas as 'un veritable anti-Oedipe' (p. 52), struggling to maintain his neutrality against language - language in which 'chaque mot est une atmosphere dangereuse' (p. 74). Madame Bernal maintains that 'Les Gommes devient une fiction contre la fiction' (p. 54) in which Robbe-Grillet 's'en prend a la valeur ontologique impliquee dans la composition m@me du roman' (p. 95). 442</page></plain_text>
