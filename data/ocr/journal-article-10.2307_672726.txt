Reviewed by SHIRLEY GORENSTEIN Columbia University This volume is one of a series of catalogs from the Museum fiir Vdlkerkunde in Berlin. It is the first of a new series that will present the museum's American archaeology collec- tion; it is concerned primarily with its collec- tion of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic vessels from Oaxaca. Those pieces which are probably best known were brought to Berlin in the period between 1862 and 1911. The core of the collection came from the Heidelberg-Hand- schuhsheim Museum Aztekish-Mexikanischer Altertiimer which had acquired through government purchase the important collec- tion of Carl Uhde, a well known collector and businessman. Further contributions were made between 1890 and the first years</page><page sequence="2">ANTHROPOLOGY AND THE ARTS 1469 of the twentieth century by Gustavo Stein, who was the German consul stationed in the state of Oaxaca, and by the traveler and merchant, Dr. Wilhelm Bauer. The collection was built to its present size and given its particular through the work of the first director of the American Archaeology Sec- tion of the Museum, Eduard Seler. Between 1887 and 1911 he and his wife, Caecilie Seler-Sachs, brought back many specimens from Mexico, and the greatest part of the Oaxaca collection is the result of their efforts. A total of 233 vessels are included in the catalog. The vessels are grouped according to the member of the pantheon represented, and an introductory interpretive statement follows each heading. For each vessel a note is made on the type of object (Alfonso Caso and Ignacio Bernal [1952] are followed in the matter of classification), its provenance, the catalog number at the Museum, the name of the collector or owner, the date of acquisition, the dimensions of the vessel, color, cultural phase, and previous publica- tions on the object. Each object is fully described and is illustrated with a photo- graph. The author is to be commended for the thoroughness and completeness with which she has catalogued this important collection. The volume is a useful contribution to Oaxacan studies. The book is also nicely designed, making it easy to relate the de- scriptive information to the photographs which enhances its value as a reference work. I wish to register one small complaint, how- ever. The photographs taken by two mem- bers of the museum staff, Dietrich Graf and Waldtraut Schneider-Schiitz, were made, like most catalog photographs, without any par- ticular attention to lighting or composition. While this is to be deplored, it is so common I do not wish to single out these "record shots" on that score. But the inclusion of several out of focus photographs is beneath the low standards we are now willing to accept with good grace.
