<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Reviewed by Gordon Bronitsky, University of New Mexico. This comprehensive, well-organized review is divid- ed into seven sections: a thorough, brief review of the natural environment, a critical assessment of previous research, a synopsis of prehistory, site descriptions, previous stabilization attempts, ethnographic obser- vations, and recommendations. Especially interesting are the criticisms of stabilization efforts and the criti- cisms of widely held beliefs about links between Ka- yenta Anasazi and ethnographic Hopi. Les Mayas. CLAUDE-FRANCOIS BAUDEZ and PIERRE BECQUELIN. L'univers des formes, Le Monde Precolumbien serie, Gallimard, 1984. xiv + 409 pp., illustrations, maps, biblio. Cloth. Reviewed by Prudence M. Rice, University of Florida. Lush and sumptuous may not be the only words to describe Les Mayas, but they certainly are among the most apropos. One of a series of three lavishly illus- trated volumes on "Le Monde Precolumbien" (the oth- er two treat Central Mexico and the Andes), Les Mayas is more than just another bit of coffee-table fluff. Be- sides superb color and black-and-white photographs (of remarkable quality, revealing details of surface tex- ture and technique in stone, jade, and pottery), the volume features a highly informative text, abundant line drawings of building complexes, site maps, recon- structions, and an illustrated glossary-index of art mo- tifs, gods, and Maya place names. The textual material begins with several introductory chapters on the Maya civilization and the genesis of Maya art. As one might expect, the focus of the book is on what the authors call "l'Apog&amp;e," or Late Classic period, A.D. 550-950, with about 175 pages of text and photographs devoted to the various media of expression of the Maya civilization in this period. Ar- chitecture and sculpture are addressed for each of the major subregions of the Maya area and then within these regions, separate treatments are given for indi- vidual sites, such as Tikal, Palenque, Copan, etc.; the other topical subdivisions are ceramics (vases, censers, and figurines) and portable art (jade, other stone, and shell). Following the section on the Classic period, shorter chapters treat the Puuc area, the "Maya-Tol- tec" Early Postclassic period, and the Late Postclassic. There is little here that is new: many of the photo- graphs that commonly illustrate books on Maya art and archaeology are included in Les Mayas, and as usual the emphasis is on the Lowlands and on the Classic period. It is refreshing, however, to have a book about Maya art and architecture written by archaeol- ogists, so that there is less stress on the emotional im- pact of the art and more on its cultural significance. Furthermore, authors Baudez's and Becquelin's ex- periences are primarily in the southern and peripheral Maya areas (Highlands, Chiapas, and Southeast pe- riphery) so that these frequently slighted regions are given a bit more attention than is the typical practice.

Reviewed by Joseph Mountjoy, University of North Carolina, Greensboro. Agrinier's monograph is a superbly illustrated report on investigations conducted in 1973-1975 at a location 100 km from the Pacific Coast. Research focused on the nature and extent of Early Olmec (San Lorenzo phase) deposits. Three discrete artifact concentrations were tested. Two, on the south side of the river 100 m apart, appear to be habitation areas. Excavations un- covered sherd refuse and some stone artifacts, plus one drilled piece of iron ore. The third area, located across the river and 1 km from the other two, has thousands of pieces of iron ore of unknown but non-local source, and a few Early Olmec sherds. Agrinier suggests that these sites indicate colonization by people from the San Lorenzo area who farmed and manufactured items of iron ore for export. He does not explain why these people would work iron ore at such a distance from their village. McDonald's publication is a concise and well-illus- trated report on his 1971 investigation of a 25-mound Olmec site located 12 km from the Pacific Coast in extreme southwestern Chiapas. Thirty-nine units, mostly 2-m pits, were excavated. Some of these ex- posed decorated stone monuments were in their orig- inal context; most notable were the jaguar and serpent head blocks flanking the base of a stairway, and two stela-like monuments with anthropomorphic designs flanking an altar next to a tomb of stone slabs. These monuments appear to date within the last 350 years of the cultural sequence at the site, radiocarbon dated (and recalibrated) to between 1100 B.C. and 300 B.C. Hopkins's memoir derives from fieldwork in 1968- 1970. It is a study of agricultural intensification and population from pre-Hispanic times to the present in an area marginal to nuclear cultural developments. Ethnohistorical and archaeological data are utilized to analyze cultural processes that are proposed to be ap- plicable to Mesoamerican civilization in general. The ethnohistoric sections admirably document the inter- play between economic geography and population trends. The pre-Hispanic section attempts to link the 210 [Vol. 52, No. 1, 1987]</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS AND BOOK NOTES historic processes with the archaeological record, and does so best for the Postclassic.

Izapa Relief Carving: Form, Content, Rules for Design, and Role in Mesoamerican Art History and Archae- ology. VIRGINIA G. SMITH. Dumbarton Oaks, Pre- Columbian Studies 27, Washington D.C., 1984. vii + 103 pp., figures, tables, biblio. $12.00 (paper). Reviewed by John F. Scott, University of Florida. Revising her Kentucky Master's thesis, Smith de- molishes the theory that Izapa sculpture served as a transition between Olmec and Maya styles. She care- fully isolates Izapa characteristics, groups them into computer-generated trait groups, and classifies the ste- lae into seven stylistic-iconographic clusters. Her te- dious methodology creates an artistically unsophisti- cated mix of form and representation that should be kept separate. She concludes that the Izapa style is very site-specific and that it is early, dating from the Late Preclassic, 200-50 B.C. This is later than Lowe's 1982 publication that dates it at 500-300 B.C. Thus, the site of Izapa is too early for the Protoclassic horizon style named for it, a horizon that includes Southern Maya carvings differing in style and detail from those at Iza- pa. Aztec City-States. MARY G. HODGE. Memoirs of the Museum of Anthropology, University of Mich- igan, No. 18, Studies in Latin American Ethnohis- tory and Archaeology, vol. 3, J. MARCUS, general editor, Ann Arbor, 1984. xv + 166 pp., figures, ta- bles, glossary, biblio. $15.00 (paper). Reviewed by William J. Folan, Universidad Autonoma del Sudeste, Campeche. This book presents a clear, concise, well-illustrated, and tabulated diachronic/horizontal view of five of the multiple city-states extant in the Valley of Mexico dur- ing the Early and Late Aztec periods. The above is accomplished through a detailed analysis of ethno- historic and archaeological sources touching upon the administrative organization of Amecameca, Cuauh- titlan, Xochimilco, Coyoacan, and Teotihuacan before and following their incorporation into the Aztec Em- pire. The author demonstrates that changes in the ad- ministrative structure were not the same in every case analyzed and that the city-states were at times multi- ethnic. It is also pointed out that conquered entities continued their pre-conquest political organization concomitant with that acquired following their incor- poration into the Aztec Empire. The author defines the seven confederations in the Valley of Mexico during the Early Aztec Period as well as the three confeder- ations of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan that formed the later Aztec Empire and the Triple Alliance. Joyce Marcus's introduction to this volume provides an editor's summary that adequately prepares the read- er for what follows in the main body of the work. Hodge's glossary of Nahuatl and Spanish terms will be helpful for comprehending the vagaries of Aztec and Spanish sociopolitical organization. She concludes the volume with an excellent summary in Spanish that will be a welcome addition to all those wishing to learn more about the sociopolitical organization of this grand region in the predominant language of its contem- porary inhabitants. This book should also be read for its probable contribution toward a better understand- ing of what was happening elsewhere in Greater Me- soamerica during the same, and possibly earlier, time periods. The Mixtecs in Ancient and Colonial Times. RON- ALD SPORES. University of Oklahoma Press, Nor- man. xiv + 263 pp., figures, notes, biblio., index. $27.50 (cloth). Reviewed by Bruce E. Byland, Lehman College of the City University of New York. The importance of collaboration between ethno- historic and archaeological perspectives in the study of complex societies is nowhere more evident than in Mesoamerica. This volume is a strong illustration of the benefits of this union. The first half of Spores's study is a comprehensive assessment of the current state of archaeological research in the Mixteca Alta. He reviews what is known of political, social, and eco- nomic development in the region from the pre-ceramic through Spanish contact. This review is comprehen- sive, referring to virtually every archaeological project ever conducted in the Mixteca. Still, relatively little work has been done and uncertainties persist in vir- tually every period. The latter half of the book focuses on economic, religious, and political aspects of life in the Mixteca Alta after the conquest. This analysis relies heavily on colonial archival information though an active cross-fertilization of information ties the eth- nohistory to its archaeological foundations. The eth- nohistoric chapters include a wealth of detail about the organization and operation of the Mixtec cacicazgo system in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. Specific citations are employed skillfully to illustrate the fundamental structures of government, commerce, and belief that formed the basis of Mixteca Alta culture. Changes in those structures are also ob- served, their implications explored, and explanations sought. Non-specialists should not be put off by the regional focus of the book. This is not a dry examination of a cultural and historical backwater but rather an inter- disciplinary study of the development of cultural sys- tems in a well-defined regional laboratory. The inte- gration of the spatial and material perspectives of archaeology with the historiographic perspective of documentary research has produced a work of broad interest for all students of Mesoamerican archaeology and ethnohistory. The book deserves a wide reader- ship. 211</page></plain_text>
