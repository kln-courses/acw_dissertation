<plain_text><page sequence="1">Implications of the Paleolithic Symbolic Evidence for the Origin of Language The symbolic artifacts of these early periods suggest a richer cultural complexity than has heretofore been supposed; their creators apparently possessed the cognitive and manual capacities requisite to the rise of language Alexander Marshack Largely on the basis of evidence provided by the tool industries and the occasional human skeletal ma terial excavated during the past century, the European Paleolithic, which began 400-500,000 years ago, has been divided into three stages or periods: an early or Acheulian, with indications of the presence of nearly modern man (Swanscombe); a middle or Mousterian, during which Neanderthal man lived; and a late or Upper Paleolithic, popu larly known as the period of Cro Magnon man, when Neanderthal was gone and a number of fully modern Homo sapiens types ap Alexander Marshack is a Research Asso ciate at the Peabody Museum of Archaeolo gy and Ethnology, Harvard University. His major interest has been in the development of analytic techniques including microscopy and infrared and ultraviolet photography for the study of prehistoric symbol systems. Utilizing these techniques he has studied pre-arithmetic Upper Paleolithic notations, the Ice Age cave paintings of France and Spain, the prehistoric incised slates of the American Southwest, and varied Central American artifacts. His primary concern has been with the cognitive contents and strategies involved in the manufacture and use of the artifacts and images in contrast to the strategies and uses involved in the subsistence tool industries. His first volume on the complexity of the Upper Paleolithic symbol systems, The Roots of Civilization, was published by McGraw-Hill in 1972. The paper on which this article is based was prepared while the author was a Fellow of the Harry F. Guggenheim Foundation. The archaeological fieldwork was funded by the National Geographic Society, the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, and the National En dowment for the Humanities. The paper was originally presented at the Conference on Origins and Evolution of Language and Speech, sponsored by the New York Acade my of Sciences, 22-25 September 1975. ? 1976 by Alexander Marshack.

Although we have no direct evidence for the origin of speech, the objects produced by early man during this time may provide im portant information about his level of cognitive ability and manual skill?capacities related to the po tential for using language. In this paper, I shall present some new an alytic data drawn from some of the important artifacts of the European Paleolithic, along with a few theo retical considerations and interpre tations based on the data which may be relevant to an under standing of the evolved human ca pacity for symbol-making and lan guage. I shall begin by presenting symbolic materials from each of the periods, with an analysis of the cog nitive and linguistic problems they pose. Art from the Upper Paleolithic In 1931 a collection of animal stat uettes and one crude anthropomor phic figure were found at the small cave site of Vogelherd in south Ger many (2). They represent one of the crucial collections of symbolic arti facts made by early Cro-Magnon man. The Middle Aurignacian level at Vogelherd in which one set of these statuettes was found has been radiocarbon dated recently at more than 30,000 B.C., which puts it ex ceedingly close to the end of the Mousterian (ca. 35,000 B.C.). In the forty-five years since these stat uettes were excavated and pub lished, they had been locked in a bank for preservation and had been unavailable for study. The following descriptions are based on my analy ses of these figures, the first that have been permitted. Figure 1, a 4.8-centimeter horse carved of mammoth ivory dated at ca. 30,000 B.C., is one of the earliest known examples of "art"?that is, of a manufactured "representation al" image. Yet it is an extraordinar ily sophisticated image, in its way as sophisticated as any image from the Magdalenian or terminal Upper Paleolithic, 20,000 years later, usu ally considered as the high point of Ice Age art. The beautiful multico lored animal paintings in the caves of Lascaux in France and Altamira in Spain of the later Magdalenian period are more famous than these tiny ivory statues from Germany, but they do not evidence greater skill in the handling of difficult ma terials or greater realism or detail in the depiction of different species. Analysis of the horse and other ani mal statuettes from Vogelherd indi cates that they are out of place in all the standard chronologies of styles of rendering animal images, which often begin with an assump tion that the first known animal im ages are crude outlines. Animal images of the Upper Paleo lithic have usually been considered aspects of "hunting magic," an as sumption supported by the heavily weighted nature of the Paleolithic archaeological evidence, consisting of tools and animal bones, and by generalizations about "primitive" human behavior in anthropological theories of the first half of this cen tury. However, we can avoid such preconceptions and approach the image analytically, not as the "horse" we recognize but merely as a human artifact, a symbolic prod uct which was manufactured and used at the very beginning of the modern period. 136 American Scientist, Volume 64</page><page sequence="2">I 1 ,P . ., - ,,, i 11 "' l 11-lk'1 V, - , v -, . 4.. - , - lxI ,1 , , , 1,-,, - * . - -.---'; L, :. , , ," , , . , ' - L -, t4 . - r - . ." .I I ,, * -' - - .

This carved horse of mammoth ivory, excavated from an Aurignacian site at Vogelherd, Germany, and dated at about 30,000 B.C., shows the wear and polish of long handling. At a late point in the use of the statue, an angle was cut just above the left shoulder?perhaps for some symbolic pur pose. The Vogelherd statues are the earliest representational images known?much ear lier than the cave paintings of Lascaux and Altamira, which are dated at about 18,000 to 15,000 B.C. Length: 4.8 cm. My microscopic examination of the statuette revealed that eye, ear, nose, mouth, and mane had been carefully carved but worn down by long handling and perhaps by being carried in a pouch. The length of time required for such wear on ivory might be a number of years. The microscope also revealed that at one point in its use, an angle that was comparatively unworn had been cut into the shoulder, repre senting a later use of the figure, per haps as part of a symbolic "killing," though for what purpose is not known. The horse had apparently not been made to be destroyed for success in a hunt but had been kept and used and then at some point had a differentiated, specialized use. Every one of the Vogelherd im ages, including a crude human fig ure, showed evidence either of long term handling or of an applied sym bolic marking. Figure 2 shows the anthropomor-, phic image, a crudely and hastily carved object, possibly female, with two rough breast marks. It contains three sets of marks, made by differ ent tools and different types of strokes. The marks quite clearly represent a use of the image, but whether for a killing, a curing, a birth, or as an act of participation or supplication is not clear. From an Aurignacian level at La Ferrassie in France come sets of carved vulvas which, the microscope reveals, have the same type of overmarking (2). The technique of using images by symbolic overmarking persists for 22,000 years, to the end of the Upper Paleolithic. A third Vogelherd statuette adds another dimension to the problem. Figure 3 illustrates a fragment of a horse or reindeer marked "abstract ly" with a motif of multiple zigzags, multiple arcs, and many small strokes. The statuette is dated at about 29,000 B.C., slightly later than the horse of Figure 1, making it the earliest known "decorated" animal image produced by Homo sapiens. The overengraved motif is not the representation of a trap, a hut, or a male or female sex sign, to mention some of the traditional interpreta tions of the many Ice Age motifs that are associated with animals. Geometric patterns of this sort, found throughout the Upper Paleo lithic, have posed persistent prob lems for interpretation, and they are currently under intensive inves tigation. The multiple zigzag and the multiple arc, which are often re lated and seem to represent aspects of the same image, show up later both east and west of Vogelherd as decorative motifs, first in the East European Upper Paleolithic and then in the French Magdalenian. They appear on nonutilitarian frag ments and are found as decoration on tools and on the mysterious objects made of reindeer antler known as "batons de commande ment," as well as in association with animals painted or engraved on cave walls. In 1891, at the site of Cro-Magnon in Les Eyzies, France, where the first Cro-Magnon skeletons were found, there was excavated a rein 1976 March-April 137</page><page sequence="3">deer rib from roughly the same pe riod as the anthropomorphic Vogel herd statue. Engraved on the rib was a crude anthropomorph over marked with a zigzag motif (Fig. 4). Significantly, it was first published without the zigzag overmarking, which was considered distracting and meaningless (3). The zigzag and the related serpen tine image persisted in Europe as basic symbolic motifs long after the ice had gone and the great herds of the tundra and steppe had disap peared and the images of the herd animals were no longer being made. Accumulations of this type of motif, called "macaronis," have been found as far as Australia, in the cave of Koonalda, dated at about 20,000 B.C. (4). We are concerned here not with the meaning of the symbolic markings or with their dispersal, but rather with their use with a recognizable image as an aspect of the earliest symbolism of Homo sapiens. A dec ade of research has shown that Upper Paleolithic images were often used over periods of time, and that any image could be used in a number of different ways and con texts (5). Often a primary image such as an animal or female figure is found in association with a variety of subsidiary motifs. One can as sume therefore that the animal or human images we recognize were al most never merely representational; they were made for use with other classes of symbols as part of a com plex, interrelated tradition. This, of course, is the way diverse symbol systems are used today. I have already published evidence for the presence of a system of se quential, cumulative notation which apparently first appears in the Au rignacian culture of the early Upper Paleolithic (6, 7, 8, 9, 10). In addi tion, the Aurignacian burials pro vide well-known evidence for the use of amulets, pendants, and beads?forms of personal decora tion that have been considered hall marks of Upper Paleolithic symbol ism. All these objects were pro duced but a single step?about two or three thousand years?from the Mousterian. The questions, then, are: How long would it have taken for diverse symbolic traditions of this complexity to have developed? Figure 2. The crude, possibly female, anthro pomorphic figure from Vogelherd, also dated at about 30,000 B.C., shows three sets of marks made by different tools with different types of strokes, suggesting a periodic ritual or symbolic utilization of the image. Height: 6.9 cm. Could they have evolved rapidly in a few thousand years? What level of linguistic competence would have been required to support such in terrelated systems, images, and usa ges? At what point would that level have been reached, since the tradi tions illustrated here must have de veloped later? It seems necessary to look at the Mousterian and at the still earlier near-Homo sapiens of the Acheulian period. Neanderthal symbolism The literature on Mousterian sym bolism published during the last century was concerned with certain gross aspects of Neanderthal ritual or ceremonial behavior. This em phasis was due to the nature of the available evidence, which consisted primarily of Neanderthal burials, animal bones arranged intentional ly in a burial or cave, and bits of red ocher occasionally found in habita tioh sites. It seemed from the arti facts that Neanderthal man used the natural materials around him symbolically?skulls, horns and antlers, mineral colors, stone slabs? but that true art and symbol, ex pressed in the manufacture or alter ation of forms, had to be assigned to the following Upper Paleolithic cul tures and to fully modern man. Discussions of Neanderthal symbol ism referred vaguely to the "first" awakening of the religious spirit and to the supposedly "new" Nean derthal awareness of death and the passage of life and time (11). A re cent study by S. Binford compared Neanderthal burials with those of the Upper Paleolithic and found a comparative poverty in Mousterian grave goods, suggesting a lesser so cial capacity and stratification (12). Lieberman's recent research suggesting that Neanderthal man's larynx could not utter all the sounds used in modern speech (13) may have constituted an effort to explain this apparent inadequacy in the Neanderthal record. Solecki published the report of a Mouster ian burial on a bed of flowers at Shanidar in Iraq (14), and analysis of the pollens in the soil of the Sha nidar burial by Leroi-Gourhan (15) led to the identification of at least seven species of flowers that had been laid around the corpse. Many of the flowers, according to Solecki (16), have been used in folk medi cine within recent or historic times. Whether flowers were used "medic inally" or whether plants were used as hallucinogens in Mousterian times cannot, of course, be ascer tained. But that flowers were used in contexts related to the human life cycle opens the intriguing possi bility that species of flowers or plants may quite early have been used in essentially symbolic cura tive efforts, with random success occasionally uncovering a potential medicinal or biological effect. The sense one gets from the exist ing data and interpretations of Neanderthal rituals is of a strug gling, seminal, almost mute aware ness of death and a kind of incipi ent symbolism. There is, however, accumulating evidence of a differ ent type. H. Martin, in a classic re port on the Mousterian site of La Quina in France, published in 1910 the illustrations (Fig. 5) of a pen 138 American Scientist, Volume 64</page><page sequence="4">dant made from a reindeer pha lange (5.0 cm) and another from the canine of a young fox (3.3 cm) which had been fractured in the process of boring the tiny hole and had, therefore, according to Martin, been discarded (27). He also illus trated a bovid shoulder blade en graved by a Neanderthaler with ex ceedingly fine, long parallel lines, forming a "geometric" or "abstract" composition of a type that is found later in the Upper Paleolithic. In 1909 D. Peyrony found a small bone in a Neanderthal burial at La Fer rassie, of which he wrote that it "contains a series of fine, intention ally incised marks recalling the notched bones of the Aurignacian. Perhaps it had some meaning and was placed intentionally by the side of the corpse" (18). These artifacts were never again mentioned in the professional archaeological litera ture, because they were unique and seemed aberrant or experimental efforts and because there was no other known evidence for a Nean derthal tradition of personal deco ration or manufactured symbolism. In the early 1970s J. Kozlowski found in the Mousterian site of Bacho Kiro, Bulgaria, a nonutilitar ian fragment of bone that had been engraved with a zigzag motif in a most unusual manner (Fig. 6). Ex amining it under the microscope, I found that when the maker came to the end of the engraved line in the zigzag (at left in Fig. 6), he did not lift his tool to make a joining line in the other direction but left it on the bone and turned or twisted it, leav ing the print of the turning in the corner of each of the angles. It is clear that these are not scars result ing from the use of the object in work or cutting but an intentional zigzag image similar to the wide spread zigzag motif of the Upper Paleolithic. In studying the Neanderthal arti facts described above, the research er is faced with analytic problems which, supposedly, belong only to the study of the artifacts of Homo sapiens. In the manufacture of a tiny pendant, for instance, one hand did the boring while the other, somehow, held the object steady. But having made the pendant, the Neanderthal artisan next had to provide 'a string, perhaps of skin, fine enough?about 1 mm wide?to Figure 3.

If, as seems possible, the pendants were part of a cultural tradition, they pose a problem. They were not tools made for practical use or in order to make other tools but were instead part of a sequence and strategy which was "nonadaptive" except in a cultural context. The engraved artifacts pose an even more intriguing prob lem, since they suggest the presence of a tradition of nonrepresentation al symbolic marking that may have required some form of "linguistic" explanation. There is a growing body of Moust erian engraving and carving that will probably alter the nature of the discussion of early symbol use and language. The most important doc ument for our purposes was found by Laszlo Vert?s at the Mousterian site of Tata in Hungary more than a decade ago (19). It is the carved and shaped section of a mammoth molar about 10.8 cm long, ovaloid, and big enough to be held comforta bly in the hand (Fig. 7). It has been carbon-dated at about 50,000 B.C., which would place it in the Middle Mousterian. In the original Hungar ian publication it was poorly illus trated as a gray blob. Actually, the surface is the brilliant white of pol ished enamel or cementum, making it the most sensuous of all Paleo lithic mobiliary artifacts both to the touch and eye. Vertes published it as a "churinga" of the type usually made of wood and used ritually in Australia and comparable also to a class of nonutilitarian symbolic plaques made of bone and ivory found in the Upper Paleolithic. At one point in the use of the plaque? and perhaps more than once?it had been ochered red. Such ocher ing occurs on both the Australian churingas and the Upper Paleolith ic plaques. The microscope revealed other interesting data. The ivory is a lamelle or section from a mammoth molar?a large, heavy, composite tooth weighing a number of pounds (Fig.8).Although there is a rough cognitive-visual connection between flakes that are struck from a pebble core and plates sectioned from the tooth, there is a profound qualitative dif ference. The materials require dif ferent working strategies and se quences. More important, in work ing stone, the Paleolithic craftsman planned for a functional edge. Here the artisan planned for a "nonutili tarian," symbolic object. After the section of tooth was cut 1976 March-April 139</page><page sequence="5">and carved, the rear was then be velled back, making a nearly perfect oval. Work of this type and quality had not previously been docu mented for the Mousterian. The microscope also shows that the thin edge of the highly polished face was rounded as though from long han dling, with no evidence of the origi nal cutting or scraping. Here, then, is evidence for the manufacture of symbolic artifacts intended for long-term, probably periodic use within the Mousterian, 20-30,000 years before the appearance of the Aurignacian images which had a comparable use. The skills and strategies involved in making the churinga and pendants and in marking the sets and zigzags are similar to those found in the later Upper Paleolithic bone indus tries. Perhaps one explanation for the very small number of symbolic artifacts recorded for the Mouster ian is that the materials used were for the most part more perishable than bone and stone. Reconstruct ing the symbolic complexity of the hunting-gathering cultures of the historic period from what remains in the archaeological record would be an impossible task: Australian symbolic artifacts are largely com posed of wood, feathers, blood, ocher powders, incisions, circumci sions, sand drawings, songs, dances, myths, and so on. Only the rock faces retain the painted and en graved evidence for a strange sym bolism. Similarly, the evidence for American Indian and Eskimo shamanism or periodic group ritual and ceremony would have been largely dissolved in any long burial. Sparse though it may be, however, the evidence for a number of con temporaneous symbol systems in the Mousterian does exist. How far back does such evidence go? One rare and, therefore, still tenta tive example comes from the period before the Mousterian. In 1969 Fran?ois Bordes (20), a leading au thority on the Mousterian cultures, published a report of an engraved ox rib he had excavated at the site of Pech de PAz?, France, in a level that was approximately 300,000 years old?that is, from the Acheul ian period of Homo erectus, who was already verging toward being sapiens (Fig. 9). The man of this period was already building huts T I Figure 4. The anthropomorphic figure in cised on a reindeer rib, from the Aurignacian site of Cro-Magnon in France, is slightly more recent than the Vogelherd statuettes. This image too is overmarked with a zigzag motif. The meaning of the symbolism com bining a recognizable image and a traditional motif is not self-evident but must have re quired interpretation and a sophisticated use of language. Length of image: 6 cm. (21). Bordes described the rib as the earliest intentional engraving yet excavated (22). A full descrip tion of my analysis of the bone and the tradition of which it is a part is now in press (23). The microscope showed that the image had been made sequentially as a series of con nected, festooned double arcs, be ginning at left and ending at right with a multiple marking?precisely like the tradition that appears later throughout the full 25,000 years of the Upper Paleolithic. I have tried to refrain from offering interpretations of the various im ages or traditions I have been de scribing because I am, at the mo ment, interested in them only as products of the human capacity for making symbols and in their possi ble relation to the origins of lan guage. The following points should be noted, however. 1. We have evidence that in the Mousterian at least there was a va riety of symbol systems. Items such as the pendants and the churinga probably served as markers and ref erents in culturally structured group relations involving age, sex, rank, and role differentiation and in symbolic group activities such as rituals and ceremonies; these are the ways in which such artifacts have been used in historic times. In addition, images such as the zigzag and the meander may have had a phenomenological reference, docu menting awareness of the natural world. For example, my recent re search suggests that these forms were indications of a participatory and shamanistic symbolism related to water and a use of water imagery in ritual (23). The images were probably used symbolically and rit ually, instead of being mere ab stracted representations. The skill evidenced in the use of tools and the working of bone suggests that the churinga was made by an adult male who was familiar with some specialized aspect of Mousterian symbolism and that the churinga was intended for shamanistic or group use. It has not previously been suggested that such complex, "artificial" cul tural structures were present in Mousterian daily life. Add to the above artifacts the evidence for rit ual burial and the ceremonial ar rangements of bones and skulls, and one has a picture of a symbolic and cultural complexity that was fully characteristic of Homo sapiens. If there was language, it would have been involved in marking these group relations and activities. Lan guage, in fact, may have been as useful?or more useful?in this cul tural realm as in the comparatively self-evident strategies of hunting, butchering, and gathering. 2. The symbolic artifacts document a cognitive capacity and compe tence for abstraction, modeling, and manufacture of a different order than that which can be deduced from the subsistence tool indus tries. Although this competence in volved a use of hands and tools, it is probably allied to linguistic compe tence rather than to tool-making in both an evolutionary sense and in contemporaneous Mousterian us age. It is significant in this regard that, where symbolic artifacts are known in the Paleolithic record, they al ways document aspects of adult tool or material use which are different from those involved in subsistence activities. The complex nature of 140 American Scientist, Volume 64</page><page sequence="6">this difference needs to be ex plained, since it is apparently inti mately related to linguistic compe tence. 3. In tool manufacture or in subsis tence activities such as digging, gathering, hunting, butchering, or hut building, the strategy sequences are performed visibly and move toward verifiable ends. One gets a cutting edge, a tuber, a shank of meat, a shelter. The skills may re quire learning and a certain cogni tive capacity, but they do not neces sarily require a complex use of lan guage. Symbolic artifacts, on the other hand, are not validated or ex plained by their utility in the natu ral or phenomenological world, even when they are derived from the real world or are directed at it. They are viable only within "artificial" or cultural contexts. In the field of paleoarchaeology 1 there has not been, to date, a sub stantive discussion of the nature of such cultural contexts?certainly not of their possible function in hominid evolution. "Culture" has most often been described as those subsistence activities involved in tool-making, hunting, and adaptive problem-solving in the phenomeno logical world, with some discussion of protocultural changes in inter personal relations due to biological changes concerned with sex and maturation (24, 25). The data I am presenting suggest that the capaci ties evolving in man were far more complex. 4. In the manufacture of a Moust Figure 5. Mousterian pendants from the site of La Quina, France, made from a reindeer phalange and the canine of a young fox (both shown at actual size) suggest that Neander thal man possessed exceedingly fine manual skills which he used for symbol-making. The pendants constitute the earliest evidence of a tradition of personal ornament. (Photo graphs originally published by H. Martin, ref.27.) erian symbolic image, one hand (presumably the right in most cases) held the cutting tool and shaped the image. The other hand held the material being worked, ad justing it for orientation and judg ing weight, size, hardness, pressure, and so on. The right hand was forming a particular class of image in what might be termed a "specify ing" activity which, though non linguistic, was related to "naming." It was not merely the manipulative capacity of the hominid hand as tool-user that was involved (26) but a two-handed competence with a highly evolved right-handed, vision oriented specialization for symbol forming, aided by a left hand supplying a different input. This, of course, has relevance for lateraliza tion, cerebral dominance, cross modal association, etc.?but in volved also are such "modes" or as pects as motivation, planning, cog nitive modeling, symbolic sequenc ing, and an exceedingly fine acuity in the kinesthetic, somesthetic, and visual inputs. Above and behind these testable skills there is the more generalized capacity to create and to function within long-term, artificial (or cultural) "equations of relevance." In the Mousterian, each of these modes is totally human and far more evolved than is evidenced by a chimpanzee's use of symbol or tool. Some comparisons, however, may be useful. Cross-modal language origins If one assumes that in the Acheul ian and Mousterian the use of sym bolic images required some form of spoken language to maintain and explain the tradition, one must ex plore the possibility that visually oriented "two-handedness" of the human type, with all of its cross modal neurological correlates, evolved in conjunction with an in creasingly lateralized, corticalized capacity for vocal communication. A brief model for such a possible evolutionary development follows. Most biological systems have a cer tain range of potential variability. In scientific research and under lab oratory conditions it is often this range that is tested rather than the system of behavior that is function  Figure 6. Microscopic examination of this nonutilitarian fragment of bone revealed that the zigzags are not the accidental cross ing of random work marks but were incised as continuous lines. The circular marks made by the turning of the engraving tool can be seen in the angles of the zigzag at the left. The fragment comes from a Mousterian level in the cave of Bacho Kiro, Bulgaria. Length: 10 cm. 1976 March-April 141</page><page sequence="7">al under biologically "natural" con ditions. Some aspect of this capaci ty for potentially variable behavior will function adaptively for an or ganism under new environmental conditions and then be selected for genetically. The behavioral systems of the anthropoids exhibit the wid est range of what I heuristically term the "potential variable capaci ty." It is an aspect of this capacity that is currently being tested under artificial conditions in research on language acquisition in chim panzees. The range of the "poten tial variable capacity" inherent in the eye-hand-brain system of the early hominids is, at most, roughly suggested by the chimpanzees' ca pacity for tool, gesture, and symbol use in the wild and in the "cultural" conditions of the laboratory. One assumes some degree of evolved difference in the behavioral capacity of the hominids, associated with such factors as upright pos ture, full bipedalism, freed hands, and the brain structuring that would accompany such anatomic changes. Still, the chimpanzee ca pacity does suggest aspects of the evolving potential, and these re quire study for their relevance to spoken language. In the wild, chimpanzee hands are used in a number of ways: relation ally, to gesture, groom, and hold; practically, to gather food, make and use simple tools, and solve sim ple manual problems in time and space; and agonistically, to display, threaten, throw, or hit. They al ready function, therefore, cross modally in different contexts. Un fortunately, while chimpanzee cog nition and handedness (including the use of the hand in vision-based "language" systems) have been studied in the laboratory and the wild, the primate call system has not been explored to ascertain whether it has any inherent poten tial variability within the species capacity. Early research by Keith and Cathy Hayes to test if the chimpanzee could vocalize human phonemes was perhaps asking the species to perform at biological lev els for which it was not suited, much as though it had been asked to perform two-handed tasks in volving complex, separate cognitive strategies and sequences for each hand like those involved in skinning an animal or playing the piano (27, 28). Primate call systems are used to differentiate and institute affect re actions. Instead of trying to teach the chimpanzee to vocalize human language, it is possible that a human could learn the chimpanzee call system and its relational and affect usage and then be able to modulate or modify both the calls and their uses in order to "affect mark" aspects of structured cultur al relations and situations, includ ing elements of a hand-gesture sys tem or a symbol-sign system. It is at this level of possible potential vari able capacity in the eye-hand and the affect-call systems that the evo lution of spoken speech may have begun. Whether the results of such tests with chimpanzees were posi tive or negative, the data would be of significance for the continuing study of speech and language ori gins. Theoretically, of course, there should be some degree of potential ly variable capacity in the chimpan zee call system, even without homi nid laryngeal development. Still, by the time of the hominid differentia tion, it was probably the increased potential variability in the capacity of both systems, the eye-hand and the vocal-auditory, that contributed toward the.development of speech and language. At the time, two to three million years ago, when the hominids were making and using the multipurpose Oldowan chopper, the hands were already functioning as variable doers, specifiers, and differentia tors. They were involved in rather complex strategies and sequences requiring specialized locating, se curing, processing, forming, and object discrimination. The hominid omnivores were not only making stone tools and killing animals but they were also apparently involved in a "cultural" differentiation of classes, according to their presence in different realms, areas, and peri ods: wood usable or not, insect edi ble or not, serpent dangerous or not, amphibian reachable or not, carni vore threatening or not, roots ready or not, stone practical or not, fruit ripe or not, nesting bird present or not, and so on. Any regular or structured relation to such diverse objects would have involved the hand-eye system of an omnivore in cognitive and spatio temporal strategies of the so-called logical class, including evaluations and judgments as to size, weight, , hardness, distance, speed, and so on. But it would also have included some form of cultural terrain "mod eling," with the indications of place and direction perhaps performed by pointing. Many of these capacities are already evidenced in simple, nonlinguistic form in the chimpan zee (29). Among hominids, the com plexity probably would have in volved some specialization of activi ty and dispersal by age, sex, and perhaps rank. Relational and sub sistence activities were both becom ing "cultural." The hands involved in these com plex, specialized, often "cultural" or learned skills would already be in volved in a system with potential for internally relevant, iconic sign ing. Before the development of a formalized gestural syntax, a con comitant capacity for modulation of the call system would have made it possible to lend affect to the hand signing process. Since affect vocali zation serves in various ways to af firm or negate?that is to warn, calm, approve, demand, comfort, indicate state and attitude, and mark events or situations via the limbic system?modulated vocali zation could have served in what might be termed "adverbing" and "affect negation/affirmation." A hand can gesture "snake" and indi cate size and direction, but concur rent modulation of the danger or fear call could indicate whether it was dangerous. The hand, then, would be involved in what might be termed description or modeling with a tendency toward "nouning," some "adjectival" marking, and "verbing" or indication of action or process. The two systems overlap, with a de gree of redundancy. To the extent that objects, species, areas, or ac tions had strong affect, a specifying, modulated vocalization within a hand-signing context would itself have "naming" content. The specif ic vocalization accompanying a signing for serpent, for instance, could itself become a sign for the 142 American Scientist, Volume 64</page><page sequence="8">L,: 71 AtM T Figure 7. The symbolic plaque or "churinga," so-called because it resembles Australian Aboriginal ritual objects of that name, was carved from a section of a mammoth molar. It has been radiocarbon dated at 50,000 B.C. Painstakingly shaped and bevelled, the edges of the object also show the rounding and pol ish of long handling. At some point in its his tory the churinga was covered with ocher. This is the only example of such skilled workmanship of bone from the Mousterian. Height: 10.8 cm. class. Once instituted as a function al mode, such specifying affect vo calization could operate at a dis tance in time and space from the object. It would thus become an ab stracted, non-iconic symbol and, though originally of limbic deriva ' tion, it could now serve, proto linguistically, in a gestural, symboli cally structured situation with less ened affect. Being volitional, such modulated vocalization would require associa tion with the hand-eye signing sys tem. In fact, it could function only with reference to the information provided by the visual system. -w -..-...... Figure 8.

The question is whether such vocalization en tailed a use of the "potential vari able capacity" of the hominids and subsequent selection for an increase in that adaptive capacity under in creasingly "artificial" cultural con ditions or whether it awaited some mutation, with subsequent selection for an increase in a newly instituted capacity. The primate hand can also indicate state, affect, negation, and demand. It is significant that these two evolving systems, the hand-eye cog nitive and the vocal-auditory mark ing, as they became increasingly la teralized, specialized, separate, and cross-modally associated, did not lose their original limbic-motor con nections and modes. They still exist in man. Instead they became over lain by superseding neocortical functions and capacities. This model has the advantage of operating at each point in evolu tionary development within the bio logical capacity of the species and its evolving subsystems, as well as within the adaptive needs of the de veloping hominid cultures. In the model, the culture complex, not tool-making or hunting, provides the environmental matrix and the selective pressures. In fact, tool making and hunting remained pro foundly conservative for some two million or more years. With an in creasing complexity in hominid cul tures there would be need for an in creased capacity for variable mark ing both in the visual and the vocal modes. This would be due in part to the increasing variability and the concurrent culturalization of . objects, processes, actions, and rela tions. The formalized "structures" that result from production within both modes under these conditions will be discussed in another paper. The problem of language and speech origins is clarified from an other direction by the ontogenetic nature of the language capacity.

It would have been learned young, before the individual was economically productive, in the context of the maturing, generalized cognitive capacity and within a child's widening, increasingly com plex relational competence. Lan guage and symbolization are always learned as an aspect of the marking of cultural and\ relational "equa tions of relevance." The nonlimbic, voluntary modula tion of a danger call, for instance, could call a child back to a hominid windbreak or shelter even if there were no immediate danger. But such a voluntary call could be ut tered only if the adult knew of po tential dangers. Call modulation could also express approval of an ef fort or a developing skill in the child, or the utility or capacity of a stick, stone, or bone. Such affect related marking would be possible and useful only in the context of other, already known and learned equations. It could serve as proto language, once again, only in a cul tural context. This, of course, poses a profound theoretical problem. Language pro duction always marks or describes less than is known, for both speaker and hearer. It marks or describes an aspect of what is "known," and what is known is largely nonlinguis tic. This is true at any point in the evolution or the ontogeny of lan guage. What are some of these non linguistic aspects of "knowing?" A chimpanzee learning a man-made "language" in a man-made context is learning some of what man knows, but he is also using the pri mate potential capacity for learn ing?not simply a use of hands or a use of symbols but also certain Figure 9.

The language mode itself is such an equation of relevance. This form of knowledge is apparent in those human aphasias where the ability to produce language is dam aged but in which the equations for which language is sought remain in tact. The effort toward speech, it self an equation, may be likewise undamaged. The observer can often supply the word or phrase, and the equation or concept is affirmed by the patient. These equations are often purely cultural formulations, culture-specific, culture-bound, and without phenomenological refer ence. They are often not "logical" in the psychologist's use of the term, or "cognitive," or primarily linguist ic. In contrast, in certain aphasias the patient can lose the capacity for for mulating or specifying equations or sequences of relevance yet maintain a capacity for the production of nonsensical phonemic language. The "deepest" structures of lan guage, in this sense, are equational and nonlinguistic. To return to our primary data, the symbolic images of the Mousterian and Upper Paleolithic could proba bly be "named," and the meaning and use of any one image could per haps be explained. But the use of such artificial images was itself a mode and an equation of relevance, one that had to be learned yet could not be linguistically explained. Human languages, like human image systems, function only in de vised contexts. The search for lan guage origins, therefore, should be directed toward the complex nature of the evolving, generalizing homi nid capacity for artificial, cultural modeling and symbolic structuring in all modes.
