<plain_text><page sequence="1">INITIAL ALEF-YOD INTERCHANGE AND SELECTED BIBLICAL PASSAGES C. D. ISBELL, Nazarene Theological Seminary, Kansas City, Missouri IN a recent article, Professor C. H. Gordon has argued that the familiar Hebrew phrase 'hyh '8r hyh found in Exod. 3:14 need not be understood grammatically as a first person form.1 Citing evidence from Ugaritic and from Hebrew and especially noting the "late" Egyptian divine name, p) nty wn.w.f, "The One Who Is Who He Is,"2 Gordon maintained two things. First, "initial' can interchange with initial y so that 'hyh might be the equivalent of yhwh or the Tetragrammaton"; and second, that a third person render- ing of hyh 's'r hyh "would be quite intelligible in Egypt,"3 the place to which Moses was being sent on his mission of deliverance. Gordon's seminal statement about initial Dalef-yod interchange is worthy of further consideration in light of evidence available from several sources. I. BIBLICAL HEBREW The biblical Hebrew evidence relating to initial )alef-yod interchange is much more extensive than the single example cited by Professor Gordon in his short note.4 Gordon referred to the phrase lqht mtnwt b' dm found in Ps. 68:19, which attests :d for normal yd. This particular phrase is extremely difficult, as is the entire psalm. The LXX (67:19) elabes domata en anthrap5 (X, anthrapois) offers little help, apparently consisting of a slavish word-for-word equation rather than a real translation. Likewise, Eph. 4:8 does nothing to solve the textual problem of the Massoretic Text; neither its change from LXX elabes (= MT lqht) to edaken (= Hebrew ntn) nor its omission of LXX en (= MT b) for the dative case alone (dative plural with X) represents an attempt to deal with the present Hebrew text. Rather, as has often been noted before,5 the New Testament phrase is probably based upon the Aramaic of the Targum. Thus textually the identification of :d as "hand" and of b as "from" 6 here furnishes the best clue to a proper understanding of the phrase "you took (received) gifts from their hand." The prepositional phrase is vocalized b~d'ddm by Dahood, who identifies it as a "Northern contracted dual form." 7 With this reading, the identification of the antecedent of the suffix poses little problem. Psalm 68 is preferably 1 C. H. Gordon, "He Is Who He Is," S. B. Hoenig and L. D. Stitskin, eds., Joshua Finkel Festschrift, (New York, 1974), pp. 61-62. Professor Gordon kindly read this article in a preliminary draft and offered several helpful suggestions. 2 The Egyptian tense here is not limited strictly to the present but can also mean, "the one who is what he has (always) been." 3 Gordon, "He Is Who He Is," p. 62. 4 Ibid. 6 R.

Additional examples of biblical 'alef-yod interchange include the following.10 1. In 2 Sam. 14:19, the phrase 'm ' lhmyn ... attests "softened from y," 11 which the LXX correctly translates by estin. The same "softening" from yod to 'alef is attested also in Mic. 6:10: cwd h's byt rs' -srwt rs'. Here the LXX translates MT :is by pyr as if for es, "fire," and accordingly offers no help with the problem at hand. The conjecture of the RSV, "Can I forget.. ." (with a note explaining that the Hebrew phrase is "un- certain") has no basis in any ancient version. Likewise, the attempt of the NEB to re- construct "S as S' is unconvincing and unnecessary if one recognizes :) to be a variant of yv here, exactly as it is in 2 Sam. 14:19. A proper understanding of the phrase, admittedly a difficult one no matter how one reconstructs it, might then be made possible by a) reading wd as 'yr with the LXX and then restoring it to the previous verse where it fits properly; b) deleting byt rs~ as an explanatory gloss which overloads the line; c) translating h' D.srwt r . . . as simply, "are there (= do they exist) treasures acquired by wicked (means), the scant measure which is accursed ?" The response of the divinity in the follow- ing verse, also in question form, is likewise left without a stated answer. "Would I approve someone with deceitful balances, with cheat-stones in his pouch ?" The answer to the first question is apparently "Yes !" The answer to the second question is plainly "No!" 2. In the light of these two examples, the MT of Proverbs 18:24 warrants another look. If ys in the first half of the verse be understood as a variant way of spelling ys, the MT will be seen to agree with, both the Syriac and Targumic renderings. Such an under- standing also restores sense and balance to the entire verse, making ys' in the first part parallel to yv in the second: Dys rcym lhtrcwt (with the versions) y':hb dbq m'h Although the word lhtrct remains problematic, one could well translate the two lines of the verse as follows: "There are friends who provide companionship, "There is a friend who sticks closer than a brother." 3. Isa. 51:19 likewise includes a phrase in which the verb 'nhm, ostensibly a first person form, must be translated as a third person in context: my )nhm. That a third person rendering is demanded here is apparent from the versions 12 as well as from the parallel 8 Dahood, Psalms II, p. 133. 9 See J. B. Pritchard, ed., Ancient Near East in Pictures (Princeton, 1970), pls. 350-61, 371, which depict Assyrian rulers receiving gifts in the form of booty or tribute from the hands of captives. 10 In Isa. 10:12, the word Opqd occupies an obvious third person slot. This fact is evident to most scholars, including the RSV translators, who rendered "he will punish" (LXX epaxei), and added a note explaining that the MT contains a first person form which had been corrected to fit the grammatical demands of the sentence. The switch from yifgod to oefgod does not fit the pattern normally followed and described above. 11 S. R. Driver, Notes on the Hebrew Text and the Topography of the Books of Samuel, 2d ed. (Oxford, 1913), p. 309 (hereafter, Notes). On the softening of ye- or yi to 0i, see E. Kautzsch and A. E. Cowley, eds.

Thus the RSV note explaining that the MT contains a first person form which must be corrected is extraneous. nhm itself could well be a third person form here, with initial 'alef inter- changed for the more common yod. This interchange also may have occurred simply as a softening in pronunciation, i.e., mi yenahim becoming mi ana hm merely because it was easier to say. 4. Several proper names exhibit precisely the 'alef-yod interchange in question, in- cluding 'yy in 1 Chron. 2:13 for yy 13 and ''r'lh in 1 Chron. 25:2 which is spelled ydlh in verse 14. But three proper names are particularly significant respecting initial 'alef-yod inter- change. (1) ysb bsbt in 2 Sam. 23:8, which is read as lebosthe by the LXX. As Driver 14 has explained the word, SbCl 15 was altered to S'bst, the form which accounts for LXX lebosthe. But then an initial yod-'alef [sic] interchange produced the spelling ysbst, itself eventually "corrupted into ysb bsbt."16 (2) The name ys'kr in Gen. 30:18 apparently stands for y8 ``kr, "man of/who is ('my') reward. "17 However, 2 Chron. 15:7 attests y"kr, "there is a reward," and that could be the meaning of the name according to Gen. 30:18 as well. (3) LXX lessiou for yidwi in 1 Sam. 14:4918 appears to be derived from either idydhfi or 'isy6,19 as indicated by 1 Chron. 8:33 and 9: 39, both of which read C'(bcl) for this son of Saul.20 5. In addition to the specific examples cited above, several Hebrew roots exhibit either initial :alef or initial yod with identical or closely related meanings, as is well known. One may simply note, for example, r (go straight, advance) which is closely related to ysr (be straight, upright) and other such pairs as y4d/lhd ymn/'mn. II. UGARITIC Gordon has identified three examples of initial 'alef-yod interchange in the Ugaritic texts:"21 as for ysh, "he shouts," in Text 67:11:21; ahd/yhd,22 "with no change in mean- ing;"123 and itnn (= Hebrew Utnn, "gift") from the root ytn. There are at least three additional examples which should be noted. 1. akl, "food," 24 is written yakl in Text 51: V:103, in the phrase yakl ktr whss. Gordon's translation of this line, "Kothar-and-Hasis is sent,"25 follows the suggestion he has made elsewhere, that yakl "is perhaps to be emended to ylak (!) in view of (line) 104." 26 How- ever, lines 104-5 are not a part of the story proper, as Gordon himself has noted,27 and 13 See also v. 12. The LXX attests lessai for both forms. This reference was furnished by Professor Nahum Sarna, who read and helpfully criticized the entire article. 14 Driver, Notes, pp. 363-64. 16 Note Lucianic lesbaal. 16 Driver, Notes, p. 364. 17 Cf.

But although this point is rather significant with respect to the interchange of "alef and yod, the fact is that LXX le- also represents such MT pointings as inter alia, ya-, ye-, yo-, ye-, Da-, and even gi-, e-, and ca-.

Such a reading also fits well with the three lines immediatly preceding 103; lines 100 and 102 express the verb "bring" (yblnn); lines 101 and 103 do not. The four lines together would then be translated: The mountains bring him (Aliyan Baal) much silver, The hills, the choicest of gold; The mines bring him precious stones, Kothar-and-Hasis, food (yakl). 2. The prepositioni "toward" is normally written atr.29 But Text 126: V: 6 contains the form yatr. Although this line is broken, a preposition at its beginning appears certain in light of the fact that lines 5 and 7 preceding and following it both begin with a preposi- tion, bed ("behind") and b ("in") respectively. 3. Text 89:6-11 reads as follows: (6) 1.pcn (7) adty (8) gb'd (9) w.'b'id (10) mr;hqtm (11) qlt, which Gordon has translated, "at the feet of my lady, 7 times this way (= on my belly) and 7 times that way (= on my back), from afar, I bow."'30 This use of "hand" to indicate times or repetitions is normally the function of "foot" both in Ugaritic (p'n) and in Hebrew (rgl). What is of interest in this particular text is the spelling id (= Hebrew 'd) for yd.31 This is initial 'alef-yod interchange.32 III. AMORITE PERSONAL NAMES Apropos of the initial 'alef-yod interchange is the statement of Herbert B. Huffmon that "the interchange of ya- and e-/i- in the same element is well attested in the Mari texts."33 Huffmon has assembled several examples of this interchange, including the following proper names:34 dI-tr-me-er dYa-tu(u)r-me-e(r) Ik-ru-ub-il/-el-AN Ya-ak-ru-ub-el/-il I-da-ma-ra-as Ya-da-ma-ra-as e-ra-ah yarah (in ya-ra-ah-tum) e-pu-uh ya-pu-uh e-pu-ul ya-pu-ul 35 28 Ibid. 29 See Ugaritic Textbook, p. 369, no. 424 and the references given there. 30 Ibid. 31 See above on Ps. 68:19. 32 In addition to the six specific examples just noted, the following data may be noted: Ugaritic it (Aramaic ty, yt); Hebrew y9. Ugaritic yrq, "gold"; Akkadian arqu, "yellow." Ugaritic ySr, "uprightness" (Hebrew ygr/jlr); Akkadian eg4ru. 33 H. B. Huffmon, Amorite Personal Names in the Mari Texts: A Structural and Lexical Study (Baltimore, 1965), p. 76 (hereafter, Amorite). 34 Huffmon, Amorite, pp. 76-77. 35 Additional information on this interchange is found in Huffmon, Amorite, pp. 99, 154-55 (note OBL and Hebrew, Aramaic, Ugaritic ybl), 210 (yahad/ *wahad/* ahad; cf. Hebrew and Ugaritic), 212-13 (under YPH), 215 (under Y8H), 216 (under ykr).</page><page sequence="5">INITIAL 'ALEF-YOD INTERCHANGE AND SELECTED BIBLICAL PASSAGES 231 By far the most striking example of this initial ya-/e- shift in Amorite occurs in the name e-wi-ma-lik (Alalakh 194, 2) which Charles Krahmalkov has analyzed as "'ehwi- malik yahwi-malik, the form 'ehwi (being) simply the dialect form showing the shift of initial ya &gt; e." 36 Professor Cross notes that "this would provide a rather neat explanation of the 'ehwe/yahwe variation in Exod. 3:14, 15" but then adds the objection that "ewi also can be taken as a Hurrian element, and we do not expect an Amorite dialect form in a name native to South Palestine." 37 However, this objection would appear to be largely overruled by the appearance of so many examples of similar interchanges in other Semitic languages, examples which show clearly that initial :alef-yod or a-/ya- interchange is not limited merely to Amorite grammar. Thus, while ewi is undoubtedly a Hurrian element, the fact of numerous initial 'alef-yod interchanges elsewhere makes the explana- tion given by Krahmalkov appear quite feasible. At the least, his suggestion deserves more attention than it has received.38 IV. THE ARAMAIC MAGIC BOWLS Several texts among the Aramaic magic bowls attest initial 'alef-yod interchange in a variety of situations.39 This magical material, despite its well-known textual and even chirographic problems, is important specifically because divine names are so often in- voked in the process of writing a proper incantation and also because the divine names most frequently used in the bowls for such purposes are 'hyh and yhwh. An examination of the :alef-yod pattern of distribution in the spelling of these two names in the magic bowls reveals the following significant facts. First, the full form of hyh may be used in place of yhwh in a magic bowl citation from Scripture. Thus Text 19:10 quotes Ps. 125:2 as follows: yrslym hrym sbb I' w:hyh sbb Icmw m't: wcd wlm. The variations from the MT form of this verse are quite understand- able in every instance but one. The absence of mater lectionis in the word yrslym (MT U.TT) and sbb (MT sdbib) is not surprising in light of common bowl orthography; 40 the bowl text spelling of I' for MT Idh is simple homophony; 41 the final 'alef in CtY is well attested elsewhere in the bowls.42 But hyh for yhwh is unexpected, unless one is prepared to treat the two forms, one with initial :alef and the other with initial yod, as exact equiva- lents of each other.43 Second, 'hyh is often used in a context that requires a third person translation for other forms which occur with it in the same phrase. One such example is found in Text 12:14, where the phrase :hyh 'r 'hyh ?mw must be translated "his name is He is Who He is" and not "My name is I am Who I am," simply because the speaker of the phrase is not God but the magician. Likewise, a passage in Text 37:11 requires a third person 36 Cited by F. M. Cross, Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic (Cambridge, Mass., 1973), p. 68, n. 92 (hereafter CMHE). 37 Ibid., p. 68, n. 92. 38 See further on Exod. 3:14-15 below. 39 For an introduction to the magic bowls with the translation and annotation of 72 texts, see my Corpus of the Aramaic Incantation Bowls, SBL Dissertation Series 17 (Missoula, Montana, 1975). All texts referred to subsequently are cited by their number in the Corpus, and readers are referred there to compare the Aramaic texts under discussion. 40 See W. H. Rossell, A Handbook of Aramaic Magical Texts, Shelton Semitic Series (Ringwood Borough, New Jersey, 1953), pp. 13-15. 41 is substituted for h here perhaps by analogy to the common interchange between postpositive and h to show the definite article in these texts. 42 See for example, bryk :t, "blessed art thou," twice in Text 51. 43 On this point Professor Sarna has called to my attention the listing of hyh as a divine name in Trac- tate Soferim IV, 1.2. This is comparable, of course, to the situation in Exod. 3, on which see further below.</page><page sequence="6">232 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES translation for hyh :'r 'hyh. This passage reads 'hyh ':r 'hyh 'lh' rb' mywsw'h smw hw' 'lh' mry kl "swtV. "He is Who He is, the great God whose name is Misoah. He is God, the Lord of all salvation." Once again, because God is not the speaker of this line, it is quite improper to translate it in the first person. Two additional texts illustrate well this same point. Text 67 begins as follows: yr tw'bhwt Imlkc yhwh yhwh yhwh mlk yhwh bswr cwlm 'hyh sr hyh mlkc hmmllckk" dyb'yit'. "A song of praise to the King, YHWH, YHWH, YHWH, King YHWH. By the rock of the world. He is Who He is, the King of the kings of the earth." Similarly, Text 69.2-4 contains the following passage: vyr twbbhwt Imlk Clmw' yhwh sb'wt .wr cwlmym 'hyh ':r "hyh yh mlck mlyl wbry yby3t'. "A song of praise to the King of the world, YHWH of the Hosts, the Rock of the worlds. He is Who He is, Yah, the King who speaks and creates dry land." Obviously, both of these examples reflect the attempt of a magician to sing the praises of God in the highest form possible, speaking of him in very reverent and respectful terms. Here too a third person translation of hyh 'Sr 'hyh fits the context far better than a first person one. A third indication of the initial 'alef-yod interchange in the magic bowls occurs in the long lists of names which are frequently cited in a standard magical formula to attest the authority by which a magician has written and worked his spell. By using a stock phrase introduced with bdwm, "in the name of ," the magician would proceed to list angels, demons, or divinities as his authority for acting and writing in behalf of his client. A good example of this formula used with divine names is found in Text 16:1: bswm yh yhw 1h, "in the name of Yah, Yahu, 'Ah." It is clear that 'h must be a divine name here, and probable that it is an abbreviation for hyh parallel to the yh-yhw-yhwh type. But note the form of the name "h'h'h in Text 43:3, where in the same line the spelling `h appears three times, and note that in the next line of the same text, the form yhyhyh is written. Text 45:4 yields the reading bvwm yh 'hyh yhwh, while in Text 53:17, "the ineffable Name that was revealed to Moses at the bush" is spelled yhhw'h by the magician-scribe and undoubtedly taken to mean "Yah, He is 'Ah." In fact, the small word "h provides a most interesting study of the initial "alef-yod interchange in the magic bowls. Although I translated "h as an exclamation in an earlier work three times,44 it is now clear that this is incorrect and that ~h, not attested either in biblical Hebrew or in Aramaic as an exclamation, certainly should be read as an alternate spelling of the divine name yh. This is particularly true in places like Text 10:4, in the phrase bbwm, yhwh 'h b'h b'h, as well as in several of the examples cited earlier. In short, all of the preceding examples show that in the magic bowls 'h could interchange with yh and 'hyh with yhwh in quite a fluid and flexible way. By far the single most interesting passage of the type under consideration is found in Text 69:6-8, which reads, b'wm yhwh yhwh yhwh yhw yhhhhw 'hhyyh yh 'hh hhw hhw yh hh yh hh hh yhh 'hh yhhw hhw hhw h 'hh yhw 'E 'l yhw. Although this is obviously a magician playing with consonants and sounds here and cannot be taken as revealing anything substantive about variant spellings of Yahweh, several things do stand out in the passage; (1) this magician was not afraid, as several were, to write the Tetragram- maton, for he does so three times at the beginning of this citation; (2) he is aware of several other "normal" ways to spell a divine name, including yhw, yh, and 'l; (3) he permutes, 44 See my Corpus: Texts 10:4; 15: 7; 16:1.</page><page sequence="7">INITIAL 'ALEF-YOD INTERCHANGE AND SELECTED BIBLICAL PASSAGES 233 for some unknown reason, several other spelling of divine names, notably hhyyh for 'hyh; 45 and (4) 'alef replaced yod in an unexpected way, 'hh being written for yhh three different times. A fourth type of alef-yod interchange in the magic bowls is illustrated in Text 27, which twice (lines 2, 5) attests the name ....... While this is probably parallel to the single 'alef used as a way to spell the divine name elsewhere in the bowls,46 it furnishes additional evidence of initial 'alef-yod interchange when compared to the numerous occurrences of the spelling yyyy in the texts.47 The form 'yyy in Text 20:9 is extremely interesting in this regard as well. To sum up with respect to the evidence from the Aramaic magic bowls, it is clear that there are numerous examples in these texts which attest initial 'alef-yod interchange and further, that in these texts, the names 'h and :hyh, certainly at this time fossilized divine names resting on a very ancient tradition," are used interchangeably with yh and yhwh. V. BIBLICAL )eheyeh The evidence presented above from several areas indicates that a second look should be given the form )eheyeh in three biblical verses where its appearance has been improperly understood. 1. Job 12:4a. According to most critics, Job 12:4-6 appear to be an interpolation which interrupts the flow of Job's reply to Zophar, verse 7 furnishing the beginning of an answer to the question posed in verse 3c. The many difficulties presented by verses 4-6 are reflected in the LXX by its omission of 4a and 4b as well as by its wide divergence from the MT in 4c and 5, as Marvin Pope has correctly noted.49 But the LXX also omits most of Job 12:3, including 3c which contains the very difficult question to which either verse 4 or verse 7 must form the beginning of an answer. The MT of Job 12:3c-4a reads as follows: w't my Dyn kmw 'lh ghq lrchw Dhyh All the grammatical markers of the two phrases are third person; "eheyeh, taken as a first person form, makes very little sense. The solution of the RSV was to emend from third to first person in an attempt to bring the lines into concord. "Who does not know such things as these? I am a laughingstock to my friends." Likewise, the NEB's "I am a laughing-stock to my friend" necessitates reading rchw as if it contained a first person suffix. However, if )eheyeh be understood as a third person exactly equivalent to yiheyeh (the switch from yod to :alef again is perhaps due to ease of pronunciation following the i sound immediately preceding), the phrase requires no emendation. More importantly, it then makes sense in the context, for now verse 4a furnishes an answer to the question 46 On the common scribal practice of permuting letters of the alphabet for the purpose of secret or magical writing of names and formulas in these texts, see my article "Some Cryptograms in the Aramaic Incantation Bowls," JNES 33 (1974): 405-7. 46 See Texts 19:2, 11; 49:15; 56:1. 47 Cf.

Gordon, "mgywt msrywt gmywt," in qcrwt bryt Cbryt cwlmyt (Tel Aviv, 1972), pp. 165-73. 49 As M. H. Pope has noted in Job, Anchor Bible (New York, 1965), p. 87.</page><page sequence="8">234 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES posed in 3c. The two phrases could then be translated together as follows: "Who does not possess (know) such things (i.e., knowledge about simple truths such as those intoned by Job's companions) ? He would be a laughingstock to his friend." Obviously, many other problems stand unsolved in the remaining portions of verses 4-6.50 Still, the proper identification of Deheyeh as a third person form and the interpretation proposed here for lines 3c and 4a may indicate that the interpolation commonly recognized by critics must be seen to begin at 4b rather than at 4a, especially since verses 7-8 seem to follow 4a quite well, while 4a and 4b-6 do not fit together at all. Verses 4b-6 speak of one who received an answer from his god when he called (4b), of a righteous and blameless man who was born to be laughed at (4c),51 of the one who is comfortable in the false belief that calamity will not come to him (v. 5), of prosperous robbers (6a) or those persons who provoke God but still remain secure (6b). These types of people are unrelated to the individual intended in 4a who would be a laughingstock in the neighborhood because he lacked the kind of basic knowledge which even beasts, birds, and fish could teach (vv. 7-8). 2. Hos. 1:9b contains the following troublesome phrase, nky lP 'hyh 1km, which the modern translations render as "I am (will not be) not your God." The RSV also claimed support for this reading from the LXX and noted that the Hebrew reads simply "I am not yours." However, LXX eg5 ouk Eimi [sic] hym6n clearly interprets Hebrew 'eheyeh as a proper name here, capitalizing it 52 as well as attaching a possessive pronoun to it. In Hebrew, "verse 9b is composed of two strictly parallel nominal clauses," 53 1i 'hyh functioning as a predicated noun precisely parallel to l cmy. But, as H. W. Wolff has noted quite correctly, "this makes sense.. . only if hyh is used as in Exod. 3:14 and replaces the name of Yahweh." 54 One should also note here that not only the single word "hyh, but the entire Hosean phrase is suggestive of an old tradition regarding the name of God. This is clear in places like Deut. 31:23, where God addresses Joshua with the words 'nky Dhyh cmk, the negation of which is what Hos. 1:9b intends to convey. That the phrase in Deuteronomy could well be translated, "I, DEheyeh am with you" is apparent when one compares Josh. 1:9, cmk yhwh "lhyk, "Yahweh your God is with you." 55 It is significant that these verses from the Deuteronomic History attempt to trace the promise of God given to Joshua back to a similar promise to Moses in early antiquity,56 and that promise of presence is precisely what Hos. 1:9b withdraws. The one who in earliest times had consistently promised his presence to Moses and to Joshua (Dnky Dhyh cmk) now withdraws that presence from eighth century Israel (nkly l' hyh 1km) ! 3. It is now proper to discuss Exod. 3:14 once again and in greater detail. In Exod. 3:14a, it is God who refers to himself in the phrase "hyh "Sr hyh. This is obviously a first person slot in the sentence. The Egyptian divine name pinty wn.w.f, on the other hand, is the way in which someone else refers to the deity. Thus if the Hebrew and Egyptian 50so See the standard commentaries for discussion of these verses and their problems. 51 The LXX reads dikaios gar anir kai amemptos egenithi eis xzleuasma; the MT reads simply dzwq idyq tmym. 52 Cf. H. W. Wolff, Hosea (Philadelphia, 1974), pp. 21-22 on this practice in the minuscules. 53 Ibid, p. 21. 4 Ibid. 55 Cf. also Josh. 1: 5: k?Ir hyyty Cm mnh hyh cmk and Josh. 1:17; yhyh yhwh l'hyk mk. 56 The promise of the presence of God in a call situation is a standard feature. In Jer. 1: 8, the promise to the prophet is :tk :ny, simply, "I am (will be) with you." In Judg. 6:16, the promise to Gideon, Ihyh cmk, can certainly mean "&gt;Eheyeh is (will be) with you."</page><page sequence="9">INITIAL 'ALEF-YOD INTERCHANGE AND SELECTED BIBLICAL PASSAGES 235 names are to be compared with profit at this juncture, as C. H. Gordon has suggested they should be,57 one must seek information from texts which will attest the form Dhyh, ostensibly a first person spelling, being used by other people to refer to the deity, i.e., in a third person slot. Precisely such information is available in the Aramaic magic bowls, as seen above, but even more significant is the fact that in Exod. 3:14b, Moses is instructed to use hyh as the name of the God who was sending him back into Egypt, again a third person slot. The LXX of Exod. 3 and 4 is also noteworthy in this regard. In 3:14a, Dhyh "Sr Dhyh is rendered into Greek as eg5 eimi ho 5n, although one might reasonably expect (eg5) esomai hos esomai, especially since 'hyh in Exod. 3:12 is translated by esomai. But while the LXX is difficult to reconcile with the MT in 3:14a, it reads quite well in 3:14b. When Yahweh instructs Moses, "Say this to the people of Israel, Eheyeh has sent me to you," it is clear that "hyh occupies a third person slot in the phrase which LXX ho 5n fills nicely. This does not mean, of course, that 'hyh here is a verb. One refers to it as "third person" meaning only that God is not referring to himself at this point. However, although "hyh is clearly a proper noun in function here, its form is nonetheless verbal,58 and one can speak of it in no other way. Parenthetically, it should be noted that twice in the next chapter of Exodus59 the Hebrew imperfect w'nky hyh 'm pyk is translated by the Greek future, kai eg5 anoix5 to stoma sou, rather than by the present tense used in 3:14.60 All of what has been said so far indicates, and there is widespread agreement here, that the single word 'hyh sometimes functions as a noun, a synonym of yhwh. But the question, of the full formula contained in Exod. 3:14a remains. Three points may be made. First it ought to be noted that a first person understanding of the full phrase, 'hyh "Sr Dhyh, leaves a meaning that is "rather odd for an ancient liturgical formula, ... and not idio- matically expressed." 61 Second, the text itself indicates that "'hyh, the first person form, and yhwh, the third person form, are taken as acceptable forms of the (divine) name,"'62 a point which did not escape the attention of those who used 'hyh in Hosea, Deuteronomy, Joshua, etc.63 Third, it has long been argued that "the formula is probably original in the third person." 64 Assuming this to be correct, it is quite possible that 'hyh in Exod. 3:14a may be original in the full form of the formula, but that it is a third person spelling, an initial "alef-yod interchange having taken place. hyh would then be reconstructed as 'ahye,65 and the original, third person form of the complete ancient liturgical formula would then be read *)ahye du ahye, "He is Who He is," "He creates what He creates," or simply "He is the Creator." 66 57 Gordon, "He Is Who He Is," pp. 61-62. 58 Cf. for example yacagob, a Qal imperfect verbal form which regularly functions as a noun. Examples of this type abound in Hebrew, of course. 59 Exod. 4:12, 15. 60 Targum Onqelos exhibits an uneven pattern of distribution in these same verses. In Exod. 3:14, 1hyh is three times rendered Ihyh, as one would expect. But in 3:12, hyh cmk is interpreted by yhy mymry bsedk, "my word will be your support." And in 4:12 and 15, w nky Ihyh cm pyk is rendered mwymry yhk/y cm pwmk. Such depersonalizing or anti-anthropomorphic ten- dencies are common in the Targumim, as is widely realized. 61 Cross, CMHE, p. 68, n. 91. 62 Ibid. 63 Cf. the citation of Krahmalkov on Iehwi-malik yahwi-malik in n. 37. 64 See Cross, CIMIHE, p. 68 and the references given there, esp. in n. 93. 65 Following the vocalization of Cross in CMHE, p. 69, n. 94. 66 On the phrase as an idem per idem construction, see D.

First, it accords well with the originality of the third person form of the complete formula, which now may be argued on internal grounds. Second, it fits nicely with the cumulative evidence of initial 'alef- yod interchange attested in various Semitic languages. Third, it draws upon a parallel Egyptian divine name which itself is a third person form used exactly as Moses was instructed to use 'hyh.</page></plain_text>
