<plain_text><page sequence="1">Function and change in Aboriginal rock art, Western Australia I. M. Crawford I Before one can discuss Aboriginal interpretations of art, it is necessary to realize that the information recorded reflects the atitudes of the Europeans who collected the interpreta- tions. In the brief analysis of these attitudes which follows, it will be clear that there are very strong biases in research work in Australia. Here I have omitted the most extreme alien interpretations which start from the premise that the more intricate art could not have been made by Aborigines, although this view was widely expressed in earlier writ- ings. There is a genuine problem in a few cases where paintings and engravings are attributable with varying degrees of certainty to Afghan camel drivers, European stock- men and Malay pearlers of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries (see Crawford I968: plate 86). Perhaps the most divergent view of Aboriginal art is that expressed by the diffusionists. Dr Andres Lommel has expounded this view in an extreme form - hunter art originated in western Europe and spread. Thus naturalistic Aboriginal art - 'early hunter art' - eventually reached Australia about 2000 B.c., but was later influenced by Oceanic stylized art (itself derived from China with Maglemosian antecedents) except in Arnhem Land where 'the older naturalistic character in rock paintings was more clearly retained' (Lommel I962). There is much that one could argue about in this view, and perhaps the most serious point of debate would centre on the implied inability of the Aborigines to create their own art forms. But in terms of Aboriginal art, the view has certain effects: I it is clearly of importance to know what art forms occur in various regions, for this is the primary data on which the diffusionist argument rests; and 2 interpretation by Aborigines of their art is of passing interest, since diffused with the art may be the original reason for creating the art form. As a result, Dr Lommel has carried out extensive field work in Australia, his wife has made magnificent tracings of Aboriginal art, and the Aboriginal interpretations of the art have been recorded. Another view of Aboriginal art is that of art critics and art historians. This view is well expressed by J. A. Tuckson in his article 'Aboriginal Art and the Western World' (in Berndt 1964). Tuckson argues that African and prehistoric art has served as inspiration for western artists, and Aboriginal art could play a similar role; and that by displaying</page><page sequence="2">302 I, M. Crawford Aboriginal objects as art in art galleries, artists have been given a greater opportunity to see the objects as art 'not as part of an ethnological collection'. The objects can then be considered against criteria used by art critics: by assessing balance and proportion and the underlying spirit of imagery, it is possible 'to appreciate visual art without any knowledge of its particular meaning and original purpose'. The presentation of ethno- graphic data, on this argument, could be viewed as distracting from art assessment. An entirely different approach to some of the art is that of F. G. G. Rose (1950), who argues that excessive numbers of toes and fingers in engraved human figures, and the absence of mouths and ears in the painted human figures of Kimberley stand as examples of the appearance of recessive genes due to in-breeding. He argues that they demonstrate the dangers of incest. However, for the demonstration to be effective, Aborigines would have to ascribe the abnormal features to incorrect sexual behaviour, and this they do not do. Without the moral, the purpose is lost. The principal writings on Aboriginal art by social anthropologists have been by Elkin and the Berndts. Professor Elkin's remarkable statement in 1950 sets out the concepts which, in less sermonizing terms, the Berndts have followed: 'We are social anthropologists concerned with art as an element in the lives of people whom we know - as an aspect of a culture in which we have tried to steep ourselves. The bark painting, the engraving on a shield, or the painting on a sacred object, displayed in the museum gallery . . may be very pleasing. This we admit. But to us the object is dead; it is divorced from its context.... The painting or engraving must be a window through which we glimpse, or even a door through which we enter, an abiding world - the world of spiritual relations, the world of meaning, which increases in depth and fades not away' (I950: 6). Stirring words - but they carry implications which warrant examination. If, for instance, art objects are but media by which we (or perhaps only the elect) may view the real life of the Aborigines, then the object is irrelevant in itself, and this raises the old questions - what is society? what is culture? Some Aborigines do make statements which go some way to support Elkin's contention. In some areas, sacred boards used in ritual ceremonies are engraved with designs, and it is stated that these are replicas of those carried by the ancestral beings. Thus the boards illustrate sacred symbols, but it is beliefs which are important in themselves. However, in other cases this is not true. A Wand- jina painting in Kimberley is the ancestral being himself, no mere replica, but real and fundamental, and the focal point of a number of social activities. I find the social anthropological view to be over restrictive in several directions. Professor Berndt, in reviewing Tuckson's article, acknowledged the criteria which Tuckson proposed for assessment of Aboriginal art as art, but then went on to say that one could 'go a little further ... cross over our own cultural frontiers, and O. see some- thing of the broader significance of Aboriginal art' (Berndt 1964). But if I understand Tuckson correctly, he is aiming at something totally divergent from Berndt and the two approaches should not be confused: Berndt has not gone 'further' than Tuckson, he is travelling in a different direction. In a more aggressive mood, Worsley (1957) attacked Mountford for his volume on rock art in Arnhem Land. Worsley pointed out that the American-Australian Expedition had no professional anthropologist among its members, and that there had been no</page><page sequence="3">Function and change in Aboriginal rock art, Western Australia 303 attempt to relate the art, or the texts of the myths, to Aboriginal social structure: 'the book must stand as a monumental demonstration of the truth ...; it is no longer possible for the amateur to make a serious contribution to anthropology'. Mountford (I958) in reply, and Cranstone (1958) in comment, both pointed out the obvious benefit in at least having available literature illustrating the art of the area. Finally, one serious implication of the Elkin view is that, for a social anthropologist, only art which is of significance to Aborigines is of significance. As an approach to an art site, this has severe restrictions. What about the older paintings whose meaning is now forgotten? What about the super-imposition and the succession of styles? Surely these aspects are important, illustrating the changing concepts and beliefs in the history of Aboriginal societies. Trezise (197I) has recently attempted to do this by showing that the dominant theme in the most recent art in the Cape York Peninsula is directed towards sorcery, and he suggests that this reflects the disintegration of Aboriginal society caused by the impact of miners in the 1970s. The actual contribution by social anthropologists in Western Austrlia to site dis- covery, description and publication has been remarkably limited. Except for publications arising from the German Frobenius Expedition of 1938-9 (Petri I954; Schulz I956) we go back to the paper by Elkin (1930) as the only contribution, and throughout Australia it has been the people trained in associated disciplines such as archaeology, history and education, or genuine amateurs, who have been prepared to spend the necessary time in bush work. I do not wish here to gloss over the contribution of social anthropologists to an appreciation and understanding of Aboriginal art. Social anthropologists, by showing that much of Aboriginal art illustrates mythologies in which ancestral beings introduced social customs, songs, dances, hunting technologies and rites, have given us a basic frame- work for our understanding of Aboriginal motivation in producing their art. Elkin, Berndt and Berndt, Art in Arnhem Land, I950, marks a major contribution in putting this framework forward in a more comprehensive form than previously. Few field workers since I950 have doubted that the bulk of Aboriginal art is an expression of Aboriginal mythology, although there are many forms of art derived from myths such as the rites for sorcery, fertility, increase of species and hunting magic, which are all explainable as the repetition of the actions of the ancestral beings. 2 During the last decade, more work has been done on Aboriginal art sites than ever before, mainly due to financial support by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, but also due to the recognition by members of the public that Aboriginal sites are threatened with destruction during developmental projects or by natural deterioration. At this point of time, recording methods are quite crude, and publications consist largely of illustra- tions of the best of the rock art with no attempt to illustrate the complete range of forms at any one site. Nor is there any attempt to show the relationship of art sites to other features such as camping sites, ceremonial grounds, water sources or vegetation. D. L, McCaskill's description of the site at Boom Boom Spring in the Waldburg Range EA</page><page sequence="4">304 I. M. Crawford (I968) is the most complete site record published to date in Western Australia. In part, the crudeness of the publications reflects the enormous numbers of paintings and engravings: it would be almost impossible to illustrate fully the estimated 5,ooo rock engravings on Depuch Island (Crawford I964) or the estimated 15,ooo engravings in the vicinity of Port Hedland (McCarthy I962). In part, the logistic problems of working in remote areas prevent detailed recording of the standard achieved in more densely popu- lated areas. As a result of the work of the last decade, it is now possible to recognize regions in which there is some uniform art style, and to say something of Aboriginal attitudes towards the art within each of these regions (fig. 22). In the following section of this paper, the salient features of art in three regions of Western Australia are described. In the south-western region of the state, Aboriginal art sites are almost unknown (Serventy I95I), and in the Murchison region, art resembles that of the Western Desert (Davies I96I). But no Aboriginal interpretations of it are available, and so I have ignored these regions. Kimberley rock art Kimberley rock art is dominated by paintings of large anthropomorphic beings called Wandjina (plate 30). Each painting is believed to be an actual Wandjina spirit which transformed itself into the painting when it ceased its wanderings on the earth in the mythical past. To touch the painting would be to touch the spirit, although the spirit may appear simultaneously in other forms, for example in cloud formations. Wandjina spirits control fertility, both indirectly in their control of weather conditions, and directly by their control of the flow of baby-spirits from the sky. There is growing evidence that Kimberley was an area of changing culture before the Aboriginal culture itself was overrun by white Australians. Indonesian fishermen visited the coasts annually from at least the eighteenth century, and Europeans visited it more irregularly from the seventeenth century. Wandjina mythology reflects this changing cultural environment, and has elements which differentiate it from other Aboriginal myths. The Wandjinas acted in an established environment, creating only an occasional rock shelter, and they fought Aboriginal people instead of other mythological people, all factors which suggest that the Wandjina myths are comparatively modern. Indeed they appear to be super-imposed on a desert type of mythology in which animal ancestors dominate. The Wandjina myths have only a restricted distribution in Kimberley, dominating the northern and western regions, and in the southern and eastern regions animal ancestral beings replace them. Myths and paintings of pythons are common, and the python myths run continuously into Northern Territory to link the myths recorded there by Berndt (195I). The pythons have attributed to them powers similar to those of the Wandjina, and the ancestral pythons may transform themselves into rainbows or whirlpools. Other powers are attributed to both Wandjina and animal ancestors, one of which is the power to bring luck in hunting. Provided that the paintings are revered and main- tained, the ancestral spirit will ensure continued fertility of species, and if specifically requested, may aid the hunter in his attempts to catch animals.

M. Crawford rituals associated with requests for hunting luck, but in front of many Wandjina paint- ings are places where the rock surfaces have been ground smooth, and it is reputed that an individual hunter would visit his own Wandjina cave, rub a stone over the rock surface while calling on the ancestral spirit to bring good fortune. Other rites are said to include the smearing of certain stones with red ochre, re-rubbing rock engravings and ritual washing during fish drives. Another power attributed to the ancestral beings was the power to kill, and the ritual in this case was to draw a distorted figure representing the intended victim near the head of the python or Wandjina, while calling on the ancestral being to cause the victim's decline in health and eventual death. Given these attributes, the ancestral beings, particularly the Wandjinas, clearly played an important role in everyday life; they were considered to be powerful spirits controlling the overall activities of living men. Some men claimed ability to communicate with the Wandjinas, this gave them powers of sorcery and they were recognized as the 'medicine men'. H. H. J. Coate (I966) has given a detailed account of the experiences of one of his informants who laid claim to these special powers. Underlying the paintings of Wandjina and animals and largely obliterated by them, are figures of an entirely different style which we call 'Bradshaw figures' after the explorer who first described them. Whereas the Wandjinas are large - up to 20o feet long - and rudimentary in form, the Bradshaw figures are small - often less than I2 inches long - and elegant. Small human figures are shown, often in groups, dancing in lines, tassels hanging from their waists, arms and legs, and long head-dresses dangling behind them. They often hold weapons of forms not recently used in Kimberley, and the rock surfaces on which they appear are often weathered and damaged. Aborigines claim that they have no real significance, having been made by birds which live among the rocks, and it seems reasonable to interpret the Aboriginal statements as further evidence that the Bradshaw figures represent an earlier art style in Kimberley. They have much in common with the Mimi figures of Arnhem Land. Western Desert art Although there is some trafficking in goods between Kimberley and the Desert, there is a marked cultural difference between the two areas, and whereas rock art in Kimberley is sacred, spectacular but not secret, the Western Desert art is generally secret, symbolic and seldom sacred. Recent research in the Western Desert has gone some way towards describing the mythology, an understanding of which is fundamental to an understanding of the art and its significance. The country is envisaged as a mosaic over which the ancestral beings travelled, and while travelling, they created the features in the landscape. The myths are in general widely known, but the details are restricted to groups of people (usually exclusively men, sometimes exclusively women), and associated are songs, dances and rituals which were first practised by the particular ancestral being. Taking up Masonic terminology, the groups are often referred to as 'lodges', and so we have a lodge possess- ing secret information, and individuals of particular classes may be initiated into the secrets and rituals left by the ancestral beings, and also taken to the secret places which they made.</page><page sequence="7">Function and change in Aboriginal rock art, Western Australia 307 Rock art plays a comparatively minor role in this system, although the secret symbols of the ancestors are regularly depicted in other ways, particularly on the regalia used in ceremonies, and in body designs. Mountford (1965, 1968) and Gould (i969) have gone some way towards publishing these designs, although other research workers have been reluctant to do the same, believing that Aboriginal informants would be upset by the publicizing of such secret information. Anthropologists face a very real dilemma, for publication of information usually given as secret and confidential may destroy the most essential characteristic of the information, that is its secrecy. But a research worker needs to publish for his own sake and can also argue that ignorance of the guiding beliefs of the Aborigines by Australians as a whole prevents the development of sympathy and understanding of Aboriginal situations. The rock art, then, is comparatively poor when compared to Kimberley and Pilbara art. There is a fairly equal mixture of rock engravings and paintings, and motifs are restricted to meandering lines, animal tracks, geometric designs and a few human forms. The geometric designs and highly stylized symbols are usually the sacred designs of the ancestral beings, or represent secret objects carried by them, but the forms themselves cannot be interpreted except by someone with secret knowledge. The paintings and engravings tend to be in secret and sacred places, but in themselves are relatively mun- dane. Unlike the Kimberley paintings which are believed to be the ancestral being and which are therefore highly sacred, the Western Desert is recognized as man-made and in itself not particularly sacred. The contrast with Kimberley is again clear when we look at secrecy: Kimberley art is not secret and women and children can and should visit it, whereas Western Desert art is secret either because of its secret connotations or because it is located in a secret place. One of the surprising aspects of Aboriginal art in the Western Desert is the casual attitude of Aborigines towards it. Frequently Aboriginal informants take no notice of the paintings and engravings found at sacred sites, and when questioned about their origins make statements to the effect that some old person was fooling around. The art has little or no relevance to the myths which make the places sacred. Gould (I968, 1969) describes Aborigines painting in the Rawlinson Range, but he was unable to ascertain the relevance of the motifs to the mythology of the site. In the north-west part of South Australia and the south-west part of Northern Terri- tory in an area which is adjacent to the Western Desert cultural block, some spectacular galleries are known, with paintings of large snakes, and in these cases, the paintings are appropriate to the myths of the area. Mountford (1968) has published descriptions and mythological connections for these at Jukiuta Cave. There seems no reason why future research should not discover similar art on the Western Australian side of the border. Art sites are reported to exist throughout most of the Western Australian desert but, for obvious reasons, they have not been investigated yet. Little is known about sequence of art form in the Western Desert, but we might expect to find that rock engravings have a considerable antiquity (see discussion of Pilbara rock engraving sequence). One rock engraving from the Warburton Range area, and now in the Western Australian Museum, shows an elongated human form which appears to be very different in style to known art of the region and to be very weathered (fig. 23). It is, perhaps, an indication of another style. The rock engraving showing human faces</page><page sequence="8">308 I. M. Crawford discovered in Central Australia and illustrated by M. Terry and R. Edwards also indicates that other styles may have existed (Edwards I97I). Pilbara The first regional survey of the rock art of the Pilbara was published in i968 by B. J. Wright, previous publications having described only individual or small groups of sites (e.g. Worms I954; McCarthy I96I, i962; Crawford i964). The survey has revealed the immense wealth of rock engravings in the region, both in terms of sheer numbers (estimated in the region of 00oo,ooo engravings (Crawford n.d.)) and in variety of style and technique. New sites are being found in this very difficult region, and it is unlikely that all of the major galleries will be located in this decade. The rock surfaces impose restrictions on the techniques used by Aborigines in making the rock engravings. Near the coast, on grey limestone ridges, rock engravings tend to be linear grooves outlining the form of animals, human figures, tracks and implements. The effect of the engraving is to provide a contrast of light and shade. Very different are the rock engravings on diorites and granites, where a striking effect is gained by breaking through an iron-stained patination to produce a colour contrast - yellow engravings against a rust-coloured background - and in these cases the whole figure is often en- graved. More rarely fully engraved figures are found on limestones, and linear forms on diorites. Little is known as yet about the Aboriginal interpretations of the art. Old Aborigines know songs which describe the movements of ancestral beings in the mythological past, and the paths followed link many of the major art sites. But the songs have only been haphazardly recorded and have not been assessed in anthropological terms. There are indications that some engravings were renewed as part of hunting-magic rituals, and the dominance of local animal species at many sites is consistent with this interpretation; but other engravings show activities such as circles of men spearing fish or other men, and at many sites there are significant percentages of animals which are not found locally (e.g. emus at Depuch Island). In these cases hunting magic would seem an improbable explanation for the motifs. Perhaps the most interesting motifs in the engravings are the 'Gurangara' figures elongated human figures with very strong sexual attributes (plate 3'I) Individuals possess enormous genitalia, and male and female figures are frequently linked. The term 'Gurangara' refers to a cult associated with songs and myths in which ritual copulation was a feature, and the term was first applied to the engravings by Father Worms (1954). That the figures were associated with the Gurangara cult has as yet to be demonstrated, but all the figures appear to be relatively recent, and as Gurangara is thought to have been introduced to the area in the inter-war period and abandoned in the late I9503, the identification of the figure is not impossible. If the figures are indeed associated with Gurangara myths, they probably represent spirit beings called 'Djanba' who first practised the Gurangara ceremonies. There has been some debate on the sequence of styles, motifs and techniqueso McCarthy (I96I) postulated a sequence in which naturalistic outline figures and stick figures are earlier than spirals and geometric motifs which in turn are earlier than</page><page sequence="9">i" Iw ., I . :C~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ' i' ~ '' Figure 23 Rubbing an unusual rokengraving from th Warburton Range,Western Australa Figur e 23 Rubbing of an unusual rock engraving from the Warburton Range, etr Asrla</page><page sequence="10">3I0 L . M Crawford pecked intaglio figures. I found this sequence unconvincing when working on Depuch Island, and argued for a simpler sequence with the linear techniques predating filled-in figures. However, analyses of the rock surfaces indicated an equally valid correlation of linear engravings with deeply patinated rock surfaces, and filled-in figures with shallow patination; the conclusion from this exercise was that no sequence could be proven (Crawford 1964). Subsequent work by Wright on superimpositions has, I believe, gone some way towards showing that linear figures in general may be earlier than filled-in figures, and this would be consistent with our knowledge of early Aboriginal art - the line patterns of Koonalda estimated to be more than 2O,000 years old (Edwards I971), the grooves at Ingaladdi of more than 5,000 years ago (Edwards 1971), the outline figures from Devon Downs at least 3,000 years old (Mulvaney I96I) and the ?Pleistocene engraving showing an extinct crocodile from Panaramitee North in South Australia (Mountford and Edwards 1962). One engraving from Pilbara has a strong resemblance to a Tasmanian wolf (Thylocine), an animal now extinct on the Australian mainland, and in this case the technique is also linear (Wright I968: fig. 386). 3 At the beginning of this paper, I outlined the different approaches to Aboriginal art. I think the diffusionist view is discounted by the growing evidence for a great antiquity for art in Australia (if the view is not discounted on theoretical grounds). Man is known to have occupied Australia for at least 30,000 years, and if the Koonalda evidence is accepted, man's art is known over 20,000 years, The antiquity of art in Australia is therefore com- parable with that in Europe. Archaeological evidence shows that there have been several major changes in stone technology in Australia and presumably other aspects of culture also changed. It is convenient to follow Mulvaney's terminology: the introduction of a flake-core tradition was followed by the Inventive Phase with blade tools, and finally the Adaptive Phase in which the regional cultures, as recorded at the time of European settlement, evolved. Although there is abundant evidence at many art sites for a local sequence of styles, and from these some regional sequences can be determined, it is not possible at this point of time to relate these changes to archaeological sequences. The dated art at Devon Downs, Ingaladdi and Koonalda is the primary evidence on which correlations could be made and, by a more tenuous argument, I have suggested that the Bradshaw figures of Kimberley could date to a period at which a different stone technology prevailed, possibly some 2,500 years ago (Crawford i968). One could, perhaps, conclude that in the period 2-5,000 years ago, Aboriginal art had as much regional variation as it had in the recent past, and this would conflict with the present archaeological view that there was a greater degree of cultural homogeneity at this period. Perhaps the most significant conclusion to be drawn from the evidence presented here is that the role of art in Aboriginal societies is still inadequately understood. While work on recording art sites is now advancing quite rapidly, and publications are making avail- able for the first time descriptions of Aboriginal art, it is clear that the anthropological</page><page sequence="11">Function and change in Aboriginal rock art, Western Australia 311 data for the art are poor. And, as the older, more traditionally oriented Aborigines die, the chances of recording reliable data are disappearing. Detailed anthropological studies are now a matter of great urgency. Finally, studies of rock art indicate a far more complex history for Aboriginal cultures than either anthropological or archaeological research. Anthropological studies have tended to view Aboriginal societies as relatively static or conservative, and archaeological studies have illustrated that technological changes were rare and that prehistoric cultures lasted for very long periods. Studies of art show that in this respect at least Aboriginal cultures in the past were constantly changing. The enormous numbers of super- impositions, the lack of Aboriginal knowledge about many pictures and even the deliber- ate obliteration of some rock engravings are all evidence to support this contention. The studies by Worms and Trezise illustrate the potential of interpreting change in Aboriginal societies through their prehistoric art.

Regional variations in the art are distinguished with reference to the art of Kimberley, the Western Desert and Pilbara. It is suggested that such regional variations have long been a characteristic of Aboriginal art. Studies of rock art may serve to underline the complexity of Aboriginal cultures, indicating a constant change within those cultures not shown as clearly either by anthropological or by archaeological research.</page></plain_text>
