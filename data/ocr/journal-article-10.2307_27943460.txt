The colophon of the scribe, Moses ben Jacob ibn Zabara, indicates the patron, the locale, and that the transcription was finished in July, 1476. The decoration and the "completion" (? binding) were the work of Joseph ibn Hayyim, who used zoomorphic characters for his personal colophon. It is well established that in form and decoration the Kennicott Bible is directly de pendent on the late thirteenth century Cervera Bible,2 a manuscript likewise created in Spain and evidently located at La Coruna throughout the fifteenth century. The physical specifications of the two manuscripts, certain decorative themes, some of them very unusual,3 and the zoomorphic colophons employed by both illuminators4 are strikingly similar. Ibn Hayyim's use of a thirteenth century manuscript as his principal model may, however, have obscured the fact that his decorations also embraced more recent material. He transposed into the Kennicott Bible at least nine designs first known to him as elements in engraved playing cards or a related source. The designs represent birds, and in the manuscript they can be distinguished from other, Stereotypie birds by their size and active poses. They include the three vivacious birds in the upper border of fol. 3 (Fig. 1), the two flapping birds in the upper border of fol. 8v (Fig. 2), and four birds which act as parashah indicators on fols. 27, 34, 49 and 103V (Figs. 3-6). With two exceptions these birds can, despite minor variations, be readily linked to birds in four engraved playing cards attributed to the so-called Master of the Power of Women (Figs. 7-10).5 The owl at the center of the engraved Seven of Birds (Fig. 7) corresponds to the owl on fol. 49 (Fig. 4); the angry swan at the bottom of the Eight (Fig. 8) corresponds to the swan at the top left of fol. 8v (Fig. 2); the birds at the center top and bottom of one Nine (Fig. 9) appear at the top center and right of fol. 3 and fol. 8v (Figs, , 2); and the second Nine (Fig. 10)6 contains, in the upper right corner, at the center right and at the center bottom, the birds on fols. 103V, 27 and 3 (Figs. 5, 3 and 1, left). For clarity the correspondences have been summarized in a chart (Fig. 11), the tracings being on a 1:1 scale for both engraving and miniature. The very number of the correspondences negates the possibility that Joseph's birds were spontaneous inventions. Identifying the models for the remaining two birds is a little less straightforward, but they too can eventually be connected to engravings. The goose at the upper right of fol. 3 (Fig. ) is based on the heron or egret at the upper left of the engraved Seven (Fig. 7). 33</page><page sequence="10">34 Studies in Bibliography and Booklore, Winter, 1975/76 The direction of the engraved motif has been reversed in the manuscript and the beak altered, but the poses, silhouettes and interior divisions are comparable. Joseph may have deliberately reversed the design for the sake of variety, since otherwise all the birds in the border would face the right. Finally, the bird on fol. 34 (Fig. 4) is exceptional in that no precedent for it can be found in the Master of the Power of Women's extant engravings. (Of his Bird Suit, the Two and the Four are not preserved.) But the Master of the Power of Women was a derivative artist, and in his sources the ultimate model for this bird can be found. The playing cards engraved by the Master of the Power of Women, probably around 1445,7 are often simply called "copy-cards,"8 because they were largely reversals of motifs first engraved about a decade earlier by the great artist called after his principal work the Master of the Playing Cards.9 In the upper right corner of the Playing Card Master's Five of Birds (Fig. 12) is a bird facing left seen from the back, the tail feathers curving up and to the right, just as in the Kennicott Bible (Fig. 4). Further observation reveals that all nine of Joseph's birds ultimately derive from the Playing Card Master,10 although Joseph's designs are generally in the reverse direction. The chart (Fig. 11 ) will again help to make relationships clear. The possibility of course suggests itself that Joseph ibn Hayyim and the Master of the Power of Women merely shared a common source. Yet once the two engraved versions are compared to each other and to Joseph's designs, the conclusion that Joseph depended upon the work of the Master of the Power of Women is inescapable. Six of Joseph's birds repeat the direction of the copy-card model rather than the reverse direction of the Playing Card Master's design. The direction of the flapping bird used by Joseph on fol. 8v (Fig. 2 ) remained unchanged in all three versions, and perhaps the same was true for the bird seen from the back (Fig. 4), of which the intermediate version by the Master of the Power of Women is lacking. The arched, preening bird on fol. 103V (Fig. 6) might seem to be an exception, but here Joseph may have fused the head and claws of the bird at the top right of Nine (Fig. 10) to the outline of the bird at the bottom right of the same card, the two engraved birds being practically interchangeable mirror-images. Whenever a discrepancy of detail or of size occurs between the Playing Card Master's design and the version engraved by the Master of the Power of Women, Joseph's version corresponds to the latter." The agitated swan on fol. 8v (Fig. 2, left), for example, has the webbed feet of the Power of Women Master's bird, not the clawed feet of the original (see Fig. n,d).12 The goose on fol. 3 (Fig. 1) presents the drastically simplified pose evolved by the Power of Women Master (Fig. 7, upper left) from the bird pecking itself at the lower right of the Playing Card Master's Five (Fig. 12). In short, the weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that Joseph knew the Playing Card Master's designs solely through the medium of the Power of Women Master's copies. A tenth design in the Kennicott Bible tends to confirm this conclusion. At the bottom of fol. 32 sits a small animal with its left paw lifted to its mouth (Fig. 13). No such creature</page><page sequence="11">A note on the Art of Joseph Ihn Hayyim 35 can be found in any card engraved by the Master of the Playing Cards. It can, however, be identified with a monkey at the center of the Nine of Beasts13 engraved by the Master of the Power of Women, who contrived the suit by combining lions, bears and deer from the Playing Card Master (who had kept them separate) with still other animals, including the monkey, from other sources not yet determined. In Joseph's version the monkey was slightly modified, perhaps to reduce the scatophagous implication. When Cecil Roth discovered the connection between the Cervera and the Kennicott Bibles he was, he wrote,14 distressed until he realized that the existence of the Cervera Bible at La Coruna helped clarify certain anachronisms (particularly the zoomorphic colophon)15 in the later manuscript. He was further assuaged by realizing that "the sincere imitation of an older original, which happened by chance to be accessible to the illuminator, might result in the renewal of certain decorative and artistic features many generations after their natural vogue had ceased and in a different environment"16 ? the environment here being a fifteenth century Spanish Jewish community about which little information exists outside the Cervera and Kennicott Bibles. Discovering the connection between Joseph's birds and the Master of the Power of Women's engravings casts some further light on Joseph's milieu, since the motifs of which he made use were not "native" to Spain. Judging from inscriptions on other en gravings,17 the Master of the Power of Women was, like most early engravers, of German background. His designs may have entered Spain quite casually. That they were known in La Coru?a attests not only to a degree of wealth there (as does the Kennicott Bible of itself) and to a possible commercial connection between northern Europe and La Coru?a's Jewish community, but also, and more significantly, to a specific aesthetic taste. The playing cards of the Master of the Power of Women did not conform to normal Spanish usage. Spanish cards had quite different suits,18 and it seems unlikely that Germanic cards would be distributed in Spain, or acquired by Spanish owners, strictly for purposes of play. The modes of distributing early engravings are not yet entirely clear, nor did Joseph necessarily possess or know a complete deck, but the existence at La Coru?a of certain Germanic engraved motifs suggests that some individual (Isaac de Braga? Joseph himself?) admired the lively images and perhaps also the still novel technique of engraving, an admiration which Joseph translated into "the sincerest form of flattery." To his credit, Joseph was much more imaginative in his use of the models than the Master of the Power of Women, who had been content with almost reproductive copying. Joseph assimilated the models so thoroughly into his personal style as to obscure, until now, the derivative basis. Without losing the underlying pose or weakening its inherent vigor, Joseph simplified and regularized the configurations, treating outlines as bold un wavering curves. Interiors were subdivided into fields for decorative patterns (in contrast to the naturalistic intention of the engravings) and for colors that are simultaneously delicate in hue and vibrant in their combinations.19 In the two borders (Figs, i, 2) an area of bare parchment isolates each bird from the filigree linework otherwise filling the</page><page sequence="12">Studies in Bibliography and Booklore, Winter, 1975/76 Fig.</page><page sequence="13">A note on the Art of Joseph Ihn Hayyim Fig. li (continued)</page><page sequence="14">38 Studies in Bibliography and Booklore, Winter, 1975/76 margin, a method of "outlining" which effectively enhances the birds' vital, active quali ties. Since the same devices of draftsmanship, coloration and emphasis, however, recur elsewhere in the manuscript, it is not surprising that the nine enlightening birds have been overlooked. Fifteenth-century Jews, particularly in Italy, were frequently reprimanded by their rabbis for excessive card-playing,20 though the documents rarely indicate precisely what cards were handled. It is now possible to establish certain circles in which specific early engraved cards were known, for Joseph ibn Hayyim was not the only Jewish artist or craftsman whose knowledge of the cards affected the ornament in Hebrew manuscripts and on bindings. An Ashkenazi Haggadah today in Berlin21 contains at least two figures (Fig. 14),22 and a Haggadah in London23 written by the celebrated Joel ben Simeon con tains a lion (Fig. 15)24 and several flowers,25 derived directly from the Master of the Playing Cards' engravings, and a Nuremberg chronicle at Oxford was bound, perhaps by a Jewish binder,26 in leather tooled with desigfife copied from the Master of the Power of Women and other engravers. No doubt further examples remain to be discovered. All these artists, Joseph ibn Hayyim not the least, participated in a movement more wide spread than they could have realized, which extended the use of engraved models, particu larly in the form of playing cards, to all parts of Europe.27 Joseph's interpretation of the models was one of the most individual, and acknowledging his use of engraved sources by no means diminishes his achievement in creating an outstanding series of decorated pages.

By masking various parts of the plates, the Master used both nines to produce cards of lower numbers; thus the plate Nine A produced a surviving Five (Geisberg, III.5.2) and a Three (Geisberg, III.3.a), and the Nine plate produced a surviving Six (Geisberg, III.6). The bare minimum of cards necessary to Joseph for the designs he used in the Kennicott Bible is the four cards reproduced here, plus a card now lost (presumably a Two or a Four) containing the bird of fol. 34, but it is conceivable that rather than knowing both Nines Joseph knew the lower numbered cards printed from both plates. 7 Motifs derived from the cards of the Power of Women Master can be found in at least two MSS datable ca. 1450 or before: the Grammont Breviary (Maredsous, Bibl. de l'Abbaye), dated 1449-50, and the Montfort Hours (Vienna, Nationalbibl. Cod. S.N. 12,878). The argument for the early dating of these cards involves the date of the Playing Card Master's cards, and is fully discussed by A. H. van Buren and S. Edmunds in "Playing Cards and Manuscripts: Some Widely Disseminated Fifteenth-Century Model Sheets," Art Bulletin, XVI (March, 1974), 12-30. 8 E. g., by Lehrs and Geisberg. * See M.
