<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE APPLE OF THE EYE IN THE MASORETIC TEXT There are four expressions in the Hebrew text of the Old Testament which have been translated 'apple of the eye' in the English versions: (1) P? איש^ן Deut, xxxii io, Prov. vii 2. (2) אישון 3ת־?וין ps. xvii 8. (3) py בבת Zech, ii 12 (ii 8 in E.V.). (4) py-na Lam. ii 18. (1ر In Deut. xxxii IO it is said of Yahweh with respect to Jacob ׳ ؛צרנהי כאישון لألأhe protected him as the apple of his eye', viz. he watched over him and guarded him from harm as carefully as one guards his sensitive eyeball. The word אישון is evidently a diminutive of איש, like כידון and other words. The termination ״ון with diminutive form is not very common in Hebrew but had a greater vogue in Aramaic. The term אישון, as a diminutive, is thus a close parallel to our word י pupil', since pupil is derived from pupilla, a diminutive of pupa, י a puppet أ.ُ The Greek KOرم in KOfrt) 0رآ0ارينءه which is the LXX rendering in all passages cited above except Lam. ii 18, while primarily meaning י maiden '٠ has also the meaning of י puppet י or י doll י• The reflection of an image in diminutive form in the black of the eye as seen by a person who looks into the eye is the explanation offered for the use of these diminutives. The Arabic version has here انان رالص which is one of the expressions commonly used for the 'pupil of the eye' or 'the eyeball'. Both the Qamus of FiruzabadJ and the Sihdh of Al-Jauhari explain the انان here as the image which is seen reflected in the black of the eye {vid. Lane, S.V.). The Arabs also have 1 The word 'apple' used in the sense of 'pupil' may well be a corruption of that word. The shape of the eyeball would act as an incentive to the corruption.</page><page sequence="2">NOTES AND STUDIES 57 the special term ابمان which, as the Muhit al-Muhit explains, ٠ is probably derived from ابمان a diminutive of ايش in Hebrew [and is a term used] for اناى العي ن and its meaning is a small man'. The Arabic term in the case of Prov. vii 2 is ميتة, a term which that version uses also in Zech. ii 12 and Ps. xvii 8. The root مدق conveys the idea 'to surround', especially with a wall, as a garden (حديقق), &amp;C. The term is one sufficiently apt to use of the pupil and the iris. The Targum of Onkelos has כבבת עיניהון in Deut. xxxii ro and the Targum of Jonathan in Prov. vii 2 has בבתא דעינא. The Syriac version has ححت،ر اننإ (or some syntactical modification of it), in all the passages under review. (2) In Ps. xvii 8 we find the words י keep me as the apple of the eye' (שמרני באישון בת־עח). Here we seem to have a conflation of אי؛؛؛ח ؟ח and בת עח or even בבת עלן, brought about perhaps under the influence of the analogous types of expression בתציון and בתולת בת־ציון. The metre does not call for the long compound expression, and the בת could well be dropped. In this passage the Targum expounds rather than translates—נטר ٧٣ בנלניל די במציעות עינא (،keep me as the circle (wheel) which is in the middle of the eye'). (3) Zech. ii 12. 'For he that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of his eye' (פי ה؛נע ב؟ם נגע בבבת עינו). In the original text stood עיני י my eye ٠, but as the words are an utterance of Yahweh it was changed to עינו to avoid the anthropomorphism. It is one of the recognized Tiqqune Sopherim. This בבת is evidently the construct state of a word בבה but, as this is the only place where the word occurs in the Old Testament, we are left to infer its meaning. Clearly ؟בבת is not a transcriptional error for ؟בת (the preposition ב with בת), for the Syriac has also ئحءا, and its plural is even used as the equivalent of י eyes י : for example Ephrem Syrus speaks of the daughters of men by their beauty being a snare to the eyes of the Sethites (ذححت،ا أقس ثج) \vid. J. D. Michaelis, note to E. Castelli, Lexicon Syriacum, S.V. )دمه]. The Targum of Jonathan Zech. ii 12 has בנל?לי עינוליי 'the balls (or wheels) of his eyes". The origin of this strange and interesting word בבה may be sought in two directions. a. It may come from בב, indicating a root באב or בוב ; cf. Arabic رمتم) باب and Assyrian babu, all meaning 'gate' or 'door'. These words, however, are all masculine, and בבה is evidently a feminine form. This is an objection, but not a fatal objection, to the suggested derivation. This derivation is the one favoured by Aramaists. Thus J. D. Michaelis, loc. cit., says of ٠ حمار proprie est باب) أسم) oculorum י■ J. Levy, Chaldaisches WSrterbuch, S.V. בבא, gives בבתא as its feminine</page><page sequence="3">58 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES and the equivalent of حمار, and 'when associated with עינא is apple of the eye, eyelid, or pupil, properly opening or orifice of the eye'. A similar notion appears to be suggested by M. Jastrow, Dictionary of Targumim, &amp;C., S.V. בביתא, which he regards as the equivalent to Hebrew בבה, the innermost. The same idea appears to be behind the Targum to Koheleth xii 2, which expands the Hebrew text and for י stars י has ובבי עינך דמתילן י؛בובביא, 'and the gates of thine eyes which resemble stars', where בבי evidently means 'pupils', and Ephrem Syrus in a sermon on Ps. cxli 3 uses the pupil of the eye as an illustration pointing out that nature has given to the eye 'two eyelids to ward off harm . . . has set two gates to the pupil in the midst of the eye . . .י راءم 'اا؛ضبم حقحته( أتيه ئنا) [Ephrem Syrus, opera Omnia, ed• P. Benedictus, ii (ه74أ) p. 33لآ. His use of the word י gates' suggests that he interpreted حمار as an opening or passage-way into the eye. b. The second possibility is that בבת (absolute בבה) may originate from the same notion which gave birth to the expression אישון עין, that of the tiny image reflected in the eye. This 'doll' notion has supplied, as we have seen, terms for the 'pupil of the eye' not only in Hebrew, but also in Greek and Latin with derivatives in several languages. It found expression in English literature from at least the sixteenth century onwards in the phrase 'to look babies in the eyes'. Baby in Elizabethan English, we are told, often meant doll, and the phrase did not cany with it originally the idea of propagation \vid. Times Literary Supplement, 34, 1764, 770; 1766, 838; 1767, 859; 86, 1818, 1016].1 There are also many 'baby' words akin to בבה in the cognate languages. In Arabic there is ُؤبأ found in the phrase بؤبؤ الص 'the apple of the eye'. Elsewhere than in this expression بؤبؤ has the meaning י origin', י source ', but this may be a secondary meaning. The form of the word suggests as origin a 'baby' word, like 7 ,باباr،nra؟, papa, &amp;C.J and hence بأبا 'to cry papa'. There is also بثي 'baby', a word used by Tha'alibI in his Lata'if [vid. R. Dozy, Supplement, S.V.There is, too, in Assyrian the wordامحهء، given as synonymous with maru, 'son' [II Rawlinson, 36, 54 c, d ت vid. F. Delitzsch, Assyr. Worterbuch, and w. Muss-Arnolt, Assyr. Diet.١ s.v.\. In Syriac there is also ردحهمخلا a term of endearment, 'little girl'— the term with which Ephrem Syrus interprets the KOfxurtov of Mark v 41, and Michaelis, who draws attention to this, adds that the masculine form ححهءما is equivalent as a term of endearment to 'pupil of the eye' \_loc. ext., S.V. وحمال. In the same category should probably be placed 1 For drawing my attention to this point and to others in this section I am indebted to Mr. G. R. Driver.</page><page sequence="4">NOTES AND STUDIES 59 the Aramaic 3ביאה (Tal. Babli) and ביב؟؛ ,ביב؛א (Tal. Yerushalmi) meaning a reflected image in metal or water. A possible explanation of the origin of the word may be that the ٠ baby י word came first and the association with ٠ באב gate י came second. (4) At first sight the בודעין of Lam. ii 18 seems likely to prove on investigation either a contraction, or a mis-reading, or a mis-spelling of בבת עין. But an examination of the passage in which it occurs suggests that it should not be so regarded. The verse as translated reads י Their heart cried unto the Lord, 0 wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears course down as a river day and night. Give thyself no respite, let not the בודעין cease.' The last stichos reads as follows in the M.T. : אל־תתני פינת לן؟ אל־תדים בת־ןןינף. Here are obviously two parallel hemistichs. The word פינת is from the root י פיג grow cool י or י numb which came in the Targum later to mean *to cool off', 'cease'. This conception of י cooling' the eye is also found, and more frequently used, in Arabic. Here the root رر with the same meaning is used in associa tion with י eye י• The idea is that weeping heats and inflames the eyes, and is symbolic of distress. The 'coolness' of the eye is symbolic of comfort and consolation. Since the passage quoted above makes it clear that tears are to course down like a river, the first hemistich stipulates that there is to be no י coolness י of the eye, viz. no cessation of tears. The second hemistich we expect to be a parallel to the first. Thus מרט here cannot be trans lated 'cease', but 'be silent'. On the analogy of a similar passage (Lam. iii 49) we should read here אלחז־טי from the root דמה 'to cease'. It was never contended, however, that the tears came from the 'apple of the eye', and the stress laid on it here seems strange. In Arabic there is a poetic expression بمت الص ('daughter of the eye') meaning a 'tear' or 'teardrop'. The Hebrews tended to use בת in a similar way, especially in late Hebrew; witness בתקול 'daughter of the voice י = echo, or supernatural voice, בודצחוק 'daughter of laughter' = smile, &amp;C. The interpretation of ביח؟ןן as 'teardrop' would give both good parallelism and good sense. י Let not the tear-drop cease.' The LXX, followed by the Arabic version, no doubt finding it difficult to interpret the בת in בודעין, translates يمر ،r_7r0؟-a،T0, Ovyarrjp, 0 أ0للملأهوءس oov, 1let not thine eye be silent, o daughter', The Targum of Jonathan ignores the בת and renders י ולא השמוק ?؛י15؟ ?יל؟ךמע And let not thine eve be silent from weeoins؛'.
