<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWERS' CORNER Miles Kennedy, Editor A Behavioral Theory of the Firm: A Review Article* CARL THOMAS DEVINE The traditional method of writing a book is now two full revolutions behind us. The pendulum of the dialectic has swung from laborious com- position and rhetoric to the less enervating task of collecting readings and, just recently, to the "inevitable" synthesis: a semi-book made up of previ- ously available material and scattered unpublished research tied together with elaborate introductions and summaries. A Behavioral Theory of the Firm is such a compilation, combining readings and special research con- tributions in a theoretical framework developed by various members of the Carnegie group.' This combination of compilers and contributors should * Richard M. Cyert and James G.

A Behavioral Theory of the Firm bears a sort of practice-to-theory rela- tionship to March and Simon's Organizations (New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1958). In turn, Organizations may be viewed as a specialized, psychological extension of Simon's Administrative Behavior (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1947). The line of development since Simon's pioneering work is clear enough, but the historically inclined may be interested in speculating. about the intellectual antecedents of the Carnegie approach. Whence, for example, came the single-minded emphasis on decision making? The concept of goal-striving individuals? The holistic overtones associated with organizations? The interest in communications? The strange combination of a positivist orientation with an attitude toward computers and organizations that borders on the anthropomorphic? The following observations may be subject to possible verification or, perhaps more likely, to quick and summary refutation. Intellectual Antecedents-Some Speculations That Simon gives credit to Barnard and was himself trained in political science and public administration may account in part for his broad social overview. Early training at the University of Chicago may have brought Simon, and perhaps some of his associates, in touch with the heuristic methods used (in the social sciences) by Thurstone. The development of computers, simulation techniques, and the application of non-analytic solutions to wartime problems certainly accelerated the use of heuristic methods and may have helped resurrect the term itself. (Incidentally the group at Carnegie apparently enjoys the creation of novel terms, and the tendency to be creative-the easy way-has not always been resisted.) The positivist approach (outlined in the first chapters of Administrative Behavior) emerges from Comte, a founder of sociology, and is to be expected from those interested in all sciences. The remnants of the Vienna Circle may have been influential, for Carnap and other members of this loosely- structured, positivist group were at the University of Chicago for many years and were an intellectual force in the university community.2 More- over, at Chicago, Leonard Broomfield and Charles W. Morris were vitally interested in communication as a social activity, and certain biologists and psychologists were interested in the binary operation of firing nerves Approach to Accounting Theory has been edited by Sidney Davidson, David Green, Jr., Charles T. Horngren, and George H. Sorter, and published by Prentice-Hall; another collection called Financial Accounting Theory was edited by Stephen A. Zeff and Thomas F. Keller and published by McGraw-Hill, also in 1964. 2 Simon has cited Carnap, Mach and other positivists with favor in Models of Man (New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1957), but the present volume by Cyert and March gives no reference to these primarily non-social philosophers, and no reference to such philosophers is found in Organizations.</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWERS' CORNER / 199 and developing a sort of mathematical neurobiology. While the influence of Thurstone seems evident, there is also an obvious psychological debt to Tolman, Brunswik, and, undoubtedly, to Mead. While Dewey may have been involved, the concern of the Carnegie group with goal-striving and with inferred goals fed back into the system as causes ("asymmetrical relation(s) among certain variables") could have developed directly from others. Students of the history of ideas should be especially interested in the Carnegie emphasis on decision-making. Attempts to structure each problem in terms of choices were important during the war period, and current emphasis on gaming and model-making may be direct developments of war games and "situation" problems. Nevertheless, one wonders how much of the current emphasis might be traced reasonably to Dewey and his "biologically-rooted, socially-conditioned, problem-solving" view of man. The stress on social institutions which determine value systems and the objectives to which purposive behavior is directed makes disciples of Dewey feel comfortable and at home. Even the animistic overtones with regard to organizations are compatible with Dewey's early interest in Hegelianism and with such constructions as "the world as process." Readers may wonder why the methods and doctrines developed by the Carnegie group did not develop at certain other institutions. The post- Commons group at Wisconsin, for example, might have abandoned some nonessential, legal paraphernalia, overcome their stubborn reluctance to generalize and developed a modern behavioral theory of the firm. Columbia, with the empirical interest and mathematical ability of Mitchell and his associates, might have become the center of development. Johns Hopkins with its nest of behavioral psychologists, its group of historical and em- pirical economists, and its commitment to non-compartmentalization of disciplines should have been a likely candidate. M.I.T. must have been close with Lewin in group dynamics, Morse in operations research and a host of able mathematical economists and scientists. Yet, the curious fact remains that the center of this development has been at Carnegie where tradition includes little economics, psychology, or social science and none of the more abstract mathematical and philosophical attitudes necessary to develop new social theory of this importance. Perhaps it would be useful to outline briefly some of the developments in the social sciences for which the Carnegie group is, in part, responsible. Most outsiders would probably agree that the major contribution-a big one-has been in the form of bringing rigor and the advantages of modern scientific methods to the field of administration. This statement does not deny that scientific methods have always been applied by economists and businessmen. Accountants, many will be surprised to learn, have a long tradition for observing behavior, deciding what sorts of decisions are required, and presenting summaries of relevant information to those who must decide and act. Clearly the time for a big push to modernize the</page><page sequence="4">200 / REVIEWERS' CORNER methodology and organize the environmental clues was at hand, and the Carnegie group moved into the lead by taking advantage of the revolution in computer technology, introducing materials from related fields, and making the logical structure more explicit. The linear programming contribution, while not conceived at Carnegie, was further developed there in important ways. Some early comments that this development is analogous to long division with a limited field of application to allocation problems could never be supported and justified. Important insights have resulted from restructuring old problems to fit programming requirements and new possibilities have arisen for handling more numerous and more general behavioral and technological constraints. The Carnegie group has also been a leader in formulating behavioral hypotheses and bringing the developments of psychology to the field of business decisions. Again, oligopolistic behavior and gaming strategies were not discussed first in Pittsburgh, but the group was quick to sense the relevance of such materials and to integrate them. Interestingly enough, there has been no partisan social crusade and little or no finger wagging at businessmen for their failure to follow preconceived normative plans. The highly desirable result is a clean-cut clinical attitude that is difficult with a rabid group of social partisans cheering the operation along. There is, of course, some of the usual overdifferentiation of product that is the trademark of original thinkers, and there is typical impatience with the obvious limitations of more traditional workers in the field. Probably one should also note that, through enthusiastic teaching, exciting intellectual activity, and active proselyting, the group was for a decade or more in danger of establishing a partial monopoly of bright students interested in administration. It should be observed that a number of Carnegie developments and attitudes have been criticized extensively. Some philosophers and theo- retical economists, for example, have been concerned with the tendency toward anthropomorphism that is often apparent in the areas of com- puters and organizations. The volume under review, a relatively sophis- ticated discussion, assures the reader: "People (i.e., individuals) have goals; collectivities of people do not." Nevertheless, Chapter 3 carries the title "Organizational Goals"; Chapter 4 has the interesting title "Organi- zational Expectations"; and to show that the titles were not selected by accident, Chapter 5 is headed "Organizational Choice." The present volume is less animistic about computers than some earlier publications by members of the group. In the past it has been gratuitous, but reassuring, to be informed by solemn young men with a year or so of graduate mathematics that computers can do only what they have been instructed to do. Perhaps a little less reassuring have been statements that computers can be instructed to learn and to "think," and that the "boundaries" are not yet in sight. It is crystal clear that the modern computer is a major development of mankind's ingenuity and that its</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWERS' CORNER / 201 possibilities are fantastic, but we seem to be at the familiar stage where any caution or word of restraint is equated to adverse criticism. No doubt, a century or two ago, mental constructions ranging from atoms to galactic systems seemed to have wills of their own, and even today millions feel that "history" moves inexorably in response to a developing world spirit. It must be emphasized that all who use teleologic methods are extremely vulnerable in this direction, and scientists are well aware of this danger in any ends-means, operant-behavior framework. They would be foolish indeed to abandon the entire methodology simply because such possibilities exist. What the Theory Is About A brief overview of the research accomplishments reported in A Behav- ioral Theory of the Firm may be desirable. The authors follow Simon and conceive of organizations as mechanisms for adjusting conflict and for making and implementing decisions. "...in order to understand con- temporary economic decision making, we need to study.. the develop- ment of goals, the formation of expectations, and the execution of choices." (p. 1) "The results of our efforts to develop an empirically relevant, proc- ess-oriented, general theory of economic decision making by a business firm are summarized...." (p. 3) After admitting the possibility of bias having been parties to the controversy, the writers summarize the usual objections to the traditional theory of the firm as .... disagreement about (1) what the theory is, (2) the extent to which the theory is defective, and (3) appropriate methods for improving the theory." (p. 5) Profit maximization as the chief motivational factor is reviewed by them and some alternatives and supplements suggested by others are noted. They point out that: Katona has emphasized the obvious fact that man- agers have motives of their own; Papandreou stressed the interaction of individuals to form a "general preference function"; Rothschild men- tioned long-run survival of the firm (maximize the security level of the organization); Baumol discussed sales maximization subject to some sort of acceptable, nonacceptable profit constraint. In fact, the whole assump- tion of maximization has been under fire for a long time, and the present authors accelerate the trend by treating each goal as a simple constraint and thereby delineating an acceptable goal space. Cyert and March review the literature of economics and report that there is "no consensus" of the theory of the firm in complicated cases. Their review includes Marshall's large-scale organization implied in in- ternal-external economies; Papandreou's firm as a "cooperative system" with a peak coordinator; traditional costing techniques, with an outright error in the nature of full costing (p. 12); Eiteman's inventory "surrogate for demand estimation"; and Gordon's hypothesis that various "shortcuts'' tend to displace semi-operational directives to optimize. Economists</page><page sequence="6">202 / REVIEWERS' CORNER writing in defense of orthodox theories are treated briefly. Freidman's feeling that theory should be used to analyze the world and not to reproduce it is discussed and later criticized. Machlup's subjective approach to marginal theory is mentioned with the usual remark that it runs the danger of being tautological. Clearly for marginal theory to have normative meaning (except in the sense of "shortcut dicta") consideration must be given to expectations and estimates of future advantages and disadvantages gained or lost. Cost accountants consider sacrifice to be the essential defining property of cost, but they are aware that the measured sacrifice in making a current decision cannot involve all possible future decisions or actions that might be foregone. They turn to the past and conveniently define cost as the best of the alternatives foregone. And they ask: exactly how can a manager currently appraise the best of all future opportunities sacrificed? Arranging inductions about the future into the framework of expected values and subjective probability distributions may be helpful, and it is certainly an improvement over the traditional assumption that every businessman is a clairvoyant and possesses perfect knowledge. Obviously, shortcuts are necessary and some historical data on past decisions and actions may be relevant. The substitution of linear programming for the marginal ap- proach does not alter the requirements, but it may permit direct concen- tration on more alternatives and possibilities. The authors discuss organization theory in terms of the Weber-Durkheim bureaucracy framework which is expanded to include "such things as subgoal differentiation and conflict, individual personality changes, and organizational life-cycles." Social psychologists (e.g., Argyris, Likert) have set the tradition for studies of communication nets, morale factors, and small group interaction. As one might expect the Barnard-Simon approach is treated sympathetically. This theory is subdivided into two parts, one of which is concerned with the "organization as a clearing house through which transfer payments are arranged among participants...." The other deals primarily "with special emphasis upon the processes of executive influence and the impact of organizational position on individual goals and perceptions." The Cyert-March behavioral theory of the firm is a partial theory in that it does not deal with all specific economic deci- sions. Emphasis is placed on "process" [Dewey?] and while the focus is on the micro-unit for decision making, there is "nothing that can be ag- gregated." The authors' research commitments cover all sorts of interesting ques- tions. "What is the effect of departmental structure on the goals actually pursued in an organization?" "What effect do planning and plans have on organizational objectives?" "How do objectives change?" "To what extent can we deduce propositions about shifts in organizational objectives from the theories and research on individual aspiration levels?" "... . how do we deal with.:. . conflict of interest within organizations?" "What is</page><page sequence="7">REVIEWERS' CORNER / 203 taken as given and what is treated as subject to manipulation by the firm?" According to the authors, "Once organizational objectives and decision strategies are determined, the organization can be viewed as an informa- tion-processing and decision-rendering system." (p. 20) Furthei questions arise. 'To what extent does the market serve as a source of information about consumers, competitors, and so forth?" "What alternative sources of data exist and are used?"".. . what predictable informational biases can be identified?" "What predictable screening biases are there in an organiza- tion?" Let there be no doubt: these questions are important; they are relevant to generalizing about our socio-economic system; and they have special relevance to accounting-the traditional information-control svstem for economic activity. Exactly how does one go about developing a theory that furnishes answers to these and related questions? "In order to develop an alternative theory, we need more satisfactory theories of organizational goals, organi- zational expectations organizational choice, and organizational control. In our view, these are the four major subtheories of a behavioral theory of the firm." (p. 21) A major part of the book is devoted to developing new theory in these four areas, and in spite of some prior ideological commitments, the authors develop an interesting theoretical discussion. This reviewer, however, is extremely restive with the tendency to reify organizations. This mystical element adds nothing of consequence to the theory or to the methodology and research design. Seemingly, only the most naive holistic psychologists, the most devout Hegelians or the most uncritical organization theorists would argue that organizations have goals. Pocket knives and tractors, for example, have functions in a means-ends framework, but one hesitates to attribute goals and objectives to them except in the simplest functional sense. It may be proper, for example, to point out that the function of a small business is to bring satisfaction of some sort to the proprietor and his associates, but there is no reason to endow the business itself with objectives and choices and a mysterious inner logic of its own. One might hypothesize that the functions of any organization (or of any other device) are likely to be consistent with the objectives of some human beings and not to contravene their dominant goal systems. Individuals and their value systems are influenced by a host of things that obviously include the role-structure of the particular organization. To deny that individual behavior is influenced by association with others is to deny the influence of environment-a ridiculous position. The reader may continue to feel uneasy over certain implications that flow from the following unnecessary search: "The theorist's problem is then to identify some concept of organization goals that is consistent with the apparent denial of their existence.... The problem is to specify or- ganizational goals without postulating an 'organizational mind.'" (p. 26) Cyert and March grope for a concept of organizational goal structure</page><page sequence="8">204 / REVIEWERS' CORNER that is independent of organizational mind through the use of a coalition device. But they reluctantly conclude: "...the idea of an organization goal and the conception of an organization as a coalition are implicitly contradictory.... Any theory of organizational goals must deal success- fully with the obvious potential for internal goal conflict... ." (p. 27) The classical approach (reminiscent of the accountant's traditional proprietary view) is given as: "The goals of the organization are ... defined to be the goals of the entrepreneur. Conformity to these goals is purchased by payments (wages, interest, love) made by the entrepreneur to the staff and by a system of internal control... ." (p. 28) A second suggestion, a la Papandreou and corresponding to the accountant's soft entity theory, is to construct some sort of weighted average of objectives. The authors are not happy about either alternative. In the first case they do not agree with the implied concept of organization and in the second they are con- cerned that: "Studies of organizational objectives suggest that agreement on objectives is usually agreement on highly ambiguous goals." (p. 28) The conclusion of this section shows the authors still with unresolved conflict. For example: "... the studies suggest that most organization objectives take the form of an aspiration level . . . and that the aspiration level changes in response to experience.. .. Recent theories of organiza- tion objectives describe goals as the result of a continuous bargaining- learning process." (p. 28) Most readers will still wonder: whose aspiration levels? The coalition problem is approached through the use of side payments, and since some participant needs are complementary, the authors feel that ". . . game theory as it currently exists [is] virtually irrelevant for a treatment of organizational side payments." (p. 29) By assuming that some participants are rather easily satisfied and become passive, the authors reduce the number of contending parties whose activities are crucial at any time. The introduction of "policy commitments" to help satisfy some participants supplements the side-payment assumption. The authors wonder why accountants conventionally tend to treat wage pay- ments as costs and dividends as distributions instead of the other way around. They are, of course, not familiar with Paton's bearded illustration of an income statement that treats revenue as the amount diverted from the social fund flow and all revenue deductions as distributions of the "take" among contending parties. The discussion turns to the stability of objectives and the mechanism for changing them in response to new experiences. The authors hold that objectives have too much stability to be influenced entirely by a con- tinuous bargaining process. The budgetary operation is mentioned as "an explicit elaboration of previous commitments." The allocation of functions by way of the organization chart tends to assign authority and, therefore, to discourage invasion by groups outside the assigned area of authority. Finally, it is argued that "organizations have memories" of past agree-</page><page sequence="9">REVIEWERS' CORNER / 205 ments and precedents in the form of standard operating procedures and that members of the coalition tend to accept such procedures with much less renegotiation than would otherwise be the case. That is to say, ". . . a budget becomes a precedent for future budgets; an allocation of functions becomes a precedent for future allocations." (p. 34) Accordingly, there is more stability than in a straight bargaining situation, but: "The 'acci- dents' of organizational genealogy tend to be perpetuated." The authors, like Stedry and others, make use of Lewinian aspiration levels, developed several decades ago. This concept may help structure some problems, but alone it cannot solve anything. One must inquire about the determinants of aspiration levels and their relationship to other decision variables. Obviously, past achievements and failures of the par- ticipant himself, and of others in his reference groups, are relevant. The authors construct an aspiration-level model but do not develop it ade- quately. Their model consists of some unsupported hypotheses about lags, leads, and steady-state relations between achievement and aspira- tions. With this important, but carelessly constructed, model the authors wish to expand their theory to allow for "drift" in the demands made by members of the coalition. They imagine each member as having a dis- organized file case of demands, and it is hypothesized that there is a sequen- tial pattern to handling (and presenting) these demands. Detailed study of these sequences is certainly worthwhile. The authors' conclusion at this point is interesting. The notion of attention focus suggests one reason why organizations are success- ful in surviving with a large set of unrationalized goals. They rarely see the conflicting objectives simultaneously.... A consequence of the mechanism is that organizations ignore many conditions that outside observers see as direct contradictions. (pp. 35-6) Organizational Slack The theory of organizational slack is begun by laying down some defini- tions. First, the ". . . organizational coalition is viable if the payments made to the various coalition members are adequate to keep them in the organization." (p. 36) Second: "If resources exist to meet all demands and those resources are distributed so as to meet demands, the coalition is a feasible one. Since demands adjust to actual payments and alternatives external to the organization, there is a long-run tendency for payments and demands to be equal. In this sense ... coalition demands are analogous to the factor prices of a more conventional view of the firm." (p. 36) So far the "theory" is traditional. The difference, according to the authors, is that imperfections in the factor market are dominant. (In spite of the publisher's exciting blurb, which subtly suggests "new" rather than recent developments, the con- cept of organizational slack goes back at least to March and Simon, Organi- zations (pp. 126, 149, 187). Specifically: .. . payments and demands are</page><page sequence="10">206 / REVIEWERS' CORNER in the form of a variety of money payments, perquisites, policies, personal treatments, and private commitments.... information on actual factor 'prices' is hard to obtain, easily misinterpreted, and often unreliable.... Adaptations in demands are slow... ." (p. 36) We are now at the kernel of the construction. Because of these frictions in the mutual adjustment of payments and demands, there is ordinarily a disparity between the resources available to the organiza- tion and the payments required to maintain the coalition. This difference be- -tween total resources and total necessary payments is what we have called organizational slack. Slack consists in payments to members of the coalition in excess of what is required to maintain the organization. (p. 36) It should be observed that this definition of slack is similar to the tradi- tional concept of economic rent, but the authors wish to include more. Due to one-price policies and a host of supporting imperfections, the us- ual market system is shot full of economic rents-payments to members of the system in excess of the amounts necessary to get them to per- form. Apparently the authors wish to de-emphasize quasi-rentsand sur- pluses. Consider their use of the concept. . . . we have used the organizational slack concept not to explain differential payments but as a hypothetical construct for explaining over-all organizational phenomena.... When the environment outruns aspiration-level adjustment, the organization secures, or at least has the potential of securing, resources in excess of its demands.... The excess resources would not be subject to general bargaining because they do not involve allocation in the face of scarcity. (p. 37) When the environment becomes less favorable, organizational slack is said to represent a cushion. It seems inconceivable that parties to the coalition- if they have knowledge of existing slack-would fail to adjust their aspira- tions and bargain accordingly. Knowledge, therefore, appears to be an important factor. The concept of slack seems to be closely related to the' layman's notion of "squirming room" that sometimes results from management's failure to optimize. In the face of adversity, it has traditionally been assumed that managers can squeeze enough from some group within or without the organization to keep the coalition operating during lean periods. Under the force of necessity most managers can shift products, experiment with prices, cut costs, increase promotion, prune staff, substitute promises about the future, defer dividends, encourage lower aspiration levels and a host of other possibilities. The authors relate slack to aspiration levels in an effective manner. Organizational slack absorbs a substantial share of the potential variability in the firm's environment.... By absorbing excess resources, it retards upward adjustment of aspirations during relatively good times; by providing a pool of emergency resources, it permits aspirations to be maintained (and achieved) during relatively bad times. (p. 38) Accountants, especially, are in a position to appreciate certain conse-</page><page sequence="11">REVIEWERS' CORNER / 207 quences of slack. The profession has had tremendous pressure to report gains with reluctance and to accelerate the recognition of losses. For a half-century some continental accountants have argued that the profession should provide hidden and secret reserves through a deliberate policy of understating optimistic prospects. The hidden fat (understated expecta- tions) may be disclosed at strategic times to smooth unfavorable reports under the assumption that bad news should be softened to prevent expec- tations (aspirations) from fluctuating widely. The relationship of slack to information-and therefore to accounting-is certainly obvious. Slack can be created by discouraging aspirations and the accounting doctrine of conservatism is designed specifically to manipu- late aspirations in this direction. Thus, in the formation of slack, accounting conservatism may be as effective as unexploited opportunities. The authors may overstate the ease and convenience of reversing the process of utilizing slack. In good times, aspirations lag and little pools of unexploited possibilities become available. It is also assumed that in less felicitous times, it will be possible to reverse the process and utilize these untapped possibilities to preserve amity in the organization. The authors do not, however, establish the fact that aspiration levels always lag behind payments. One might find that aspirations under sustained growth and optimism tend to overrun potential on the upswing and be projected. More damaging is the possibility that aspirations are slow to adjust downward and slack is quickly destroyed. The accountant's tendency to "smooth" the reports would worsen this condition; smoothing unfavorable events would tend to keep aspirations from dropping as fast as environmental circumstances warrant. In any event, social scientists may hesitate to use the construct until behavioral assumptions are a little more convincingly established. The authors do not emphasize the possi- bilities for using commitments to expected future slack as means of getting current harmony. Such commitments might be used to preserve the coali- tion for short periods; more attention to this possibility is desirable. Organizational Expectations This discussion begins with a criticism of those who wish to substitute probability distributions for "perfect" knowledge of future profits, utilities, or other goals. It continues by discussing four major objections to the more or less "pure" theory of expectations. First: "The theories assume continu- ous competition among all alternatives for all resources." (Coase, 1937) Second: "The theories make search activity (and thus information) simply one of the claimants for resources to be evaluated." (Charnes and Cooper, 1958; Simon, 1955) Third: "The theories require substantial com- putational activity on the part of the organization." (Shackle, 1949) Fourth: "The theory treats expectations as exogenous variables; they are given, not explained." (No attribution given.) Some recent research studies in organizational expectations are dis-</page><page sequence="12">208 / REVIEWERS' CORNER cussed in detail. As one might expect, a certain amount of stupid behavior on the part of actual decision makers was encountered. Typically, search resulted from some exogenous event, and cost and revenue expectations were usually vague and flexible enough to fit almost any previous commit- ment or present desire. A number of firms considered resources to be fixed and used simple feasibility tests without bothering with optimality. For accountants, the most interesting research reported here is an ex- periment on communication bias. The objective and the experimental design are simple enough. "We wish to test the proposition that individuals can and do modify their subjective estimates of reality to accommodate their expectations.... It is hypothesized that cost analysts will tend to overestimate costs and that sales analysts will tend to underestimate sales." (pp. 67-68) The subjects were divided into two groups, one of which was given a preamble dealing with cost data and the other the same data with a preamble dealing with sales. Ten weeks later the groups were given the same data with the cost and sales preliminaries reversed. The data consisted of ten unarrayed estimates of costs (or sales depending on the version) given by two "estimators," A and B, in whom the subjects were to have equal confidence. The results were then tabulated to find if there was a tendency to pick the higher or lower estimates. When making sales estimates, the participants (acting as sales executives) tended to select lower figures, and, when making cost estimates, they tended to select the higher (more conservative) estimates. Most readers could guess that sales personnel do not neglect the possible effects of over- or under-stating quotas to which bonuses or reprimands may be attached. Accountants are undoubtedly indoctrinated with a conservative bias. Applying sophisticated statistical tests must have encouraged the authors, for they generalize broadly on the basis of their limited experiment. "Individuals will treat estimates, information, and communication generally as active parts of their environment.... We cannot reasonably introduce the communica- tion bias without introducing its obvious corollary-'interpretive adjust- ment'.... In short, they ordinarily use counterbiases to adjust for such biases as they anticipate in the data they receive." (p. 71) A further experiment-with perhaps trivial stakes-yielded the con- clusion: ". . . that in an organization of individuals having about the same intelligence, adaptation to the falsification of data occurs fast enough to maintain a more or less stable organizational performance .... For every bias, there was a bias discount." (p. 77) While accountants may feel genuine concern about the extension of experimental results from using students with one-dollar stakes to simulate the stresses of mature economic life, they must admit that the problem of bias is a part of the field of accounting. Not only should accountants be familiar with experiments of this kind, they should be leaders in such research. The profession is far from penurious and its members (perhaps with a little broadening) are intellectually competent to carry on such work.</page><page sequence="13">REVIEWERS' CORNER / 209 The authors-seemingly with a great deal of confidence-point out some implications of this research to a behavioral theory of the firm; some of their conclusions are: An organizational coalition does not require either consistency or completeness in information.... (p. 78) we do not ... find ... anything like a constant level of search.... there are search procedures called into play on various cues . . . for any given situa- tion there is a standard search response. (p. 78) Resource allocation within the firm reflects only gross comparisons of marginal advantages and alternatives. (p. 78) In most cases a rather firm commitment to an action was taken before the search for information proceeded very far.... Search will be much more intensive where organizational slack is small than where it is large. (pp. 79-80) Computations of anticipated consequences used by the organization seem to be quite simple.... The first was a budgetary constraint.... (p. 80) Most biases are recognized by other parts of the organization.... organizations seem to protect themselves from the worst effects of bias by focusing on easily verified data in lieu of uncertain estimates and by using easily checked feedback -information instead of more remote anticipations. (p. 82) Organizational Choice The reader is cautioned that "organizational" choice is heavily condi- tioned by the rules within which it occurs, and he is immediately introduced to a partial model of an economic decision process that includes nine steps in the following unusual sequence: forecast competitors' behavior; forecast demand; estimate costs; specify objectives; evaluate plan; re-examine costs; re-examine demand; re-examine objectives; select alternative. "The organization requires a mechanism (a) for generating alternatives to con- sider and (b) for choosing among those generated.... Typically, the procedures ... place a high premium on alternatives that are 'similar' to alternatives chosen in the recent past. . . ." (p. 86) To illustrate these points a specific duopoly model is introduced in some detail. Accountants will be interested in the assumptions that average cost curves are horizontal over most of their range with rises at both ends and that cost estimates are "self-confirming" so that estimates will tend to become actuals. Some slack is introduced by using average costs from the previous year unless the profit goal has been met for two years, in which case estimated costs are increased five per cent. Moreover, if a satisfactory over-all plan does not emerge, it is assumed that cost estimates are reviewed first; demand estimates are not reviewed unless a satisfactory plan cannot be forged from cost revisions. Considerable attention is given to the firm as an adaptive system with- out the overtones of omniscience that are alleged to adhere to classical theory, yet a detailed list of the properties of an adaptive system (p. 99) may be a little more deterministic than most scientists can accept. The</page><page sequence="14">210 / REVIEWERS' CORNER purpose of this list is to introduce the discussion of standard operating procedures, which turn out to be the "memory of an organization." It is assumed that firms change their behavior in response to short-run feedback from the environment according to fairly well-defined rules. The "general choice procedures" are stated as directives to "avoid uncertainty," "main- tain the rules," and "use simple rules." According to the authors, .. . the firm looks for procedures that minimize the need for predicting uncertain future events." (p. 102) Intuitively most of us expect attempts to reduce uncertainty, although many readers may dislike the strong terms "avoid" and "avoidance" that keep creeping up time and again in the discussion. Moreover, the statement that the organization abandons rules only under "duress" puts quite a burden on the usual meaning of "duress." Finally, the statement that "firms" rely on "individual" judgment to add flexibility to the rules does not contribute greatly to our body of knowledge. The treatment of specific operating procedures is more satisfactory. The rules for task performance ". . . not only transmit past learning; they also control (make predictable) behavior within the firm." (p. 104) Many employees enter the firm with well established task rules, and the authors rightly point out: "One of the important consequences of profes- sionalization ... is that extra-organizational groups have the responsibility of providing task performance rules for the organization.... 'Good prac- tice' . .. tends to be shared among firms . . . [and] Competitors' behavior can be predicted in the areas covered by standard practice." The second operating procedure is concerned with dependence on records and reports, and it is not past accounting training alone that points to slanting in the discussion. For example: "Records, such as the financial statement or the standard cost report, have a control effect in the short run merely because they are being kept and the organization members presume that they are being kept for some purpose (or at least that their existence will induce some purpose for them)." (p. 106) The information preserved will ". ... determine in large part what aspects of the environ- ment will be observed and what alternatives of action will be considered....." (p. 106) Readers holding to conceptualism rather than to naive realism accept this view and argue that rules and laws are not waiting to be discovered; instead they are relatively free creations of the human mind subject to modes of organizing, classifying, and relating. The authors' attitude is illustrated in this expansion of Marshall's role of theory: "... it is an exhaustive set of general concepts.... At the same time, the theory is a statement of critical relations among system varia- bles.... In its classic form, economic theory is ... a language designed to provide a systematic framework within which to analyze economic problems." (p. 114) The breakdown of classical theory-say in the case of oligopoly-is therefore explained by pointing out that not all important relationships can be expressed in the language. Many should agree that the following statement might be broadened to include all adaptive behavior:</page><page sequence="15">REVIEWERS' CORNER / 211 when the environment changes suddenly... the firm is likely to be slow in adjusting. It will attempt to use its existing model of the world and its existing records to deal with the changed conditions." (p. 107) A distinction between routing rules and filtering rules is developed. Departmentalization is said to depend on the possibility of grouping activities for goal attainment so that each subunit has some measure of independence. This "automatization" of function leads to automatization of information so that communication through channels is difficult and cross-channel communication develops. Filtering rules may develop bias, but we are reassured again and again that the organization will develop an appropriate counterbias. Planning rules are introduced through the budgetary process: ". . . a budget is a device to determine feasible pro grams.... it tends to define-in advance-a set of fixed commitment- and ... fixed expectations. Although budgets can be flexible, they cannots help but result in the specification of a framework within which the firm will operate, evaluate its success, and alter its program." (p. 111) Four major relational concepts are summarized under the headings of: (1) quasi resolution of conflict, (2) uncertainty avoidance, (3) problemistic search, and (4) organizational learning. The reader is reminded that goals are treated as ". . .a series of independent aspiration-level constraints imposed on the organization by the members of the organizational coali- tion." (p. 117) Inasmuch as all sorts of subproblems are assigned to sub- units for resolution and the constraints do not ordinarily define a unique solution, it is argued that many different decisions at the subunit level may be "consistent" with over-all plans. Uncertainty "avoidance" is summarized in the following unequivocal manner. "Organizations avoid uncertainty: (1) They avoid the requirement that they correctly anticipate events in the distant future by using decision rules emphasizing short-run reaction to short-run feedback rather than anticipation of long-run uncertain events.... (2) They avoid the require- ment that they anticipate future reactions of other parts of their environ- ment by arranging a negotiated environment." This is done by imposing ". . .plans, standard operating procedures, industry tradition, and uncertainty-absorbing contracts on that environment." (p. 119) Such procedures as customary markups, standard costs, etc., according to the authors, are ". .. not obviously collusion for profit maximization [but] rather ... an attempt to avoid uncertainty...." (p. 120) Problemistic search rules are not usually complicated. It is asserted that search starts in response to a "problem symptom" in the "neighbor- hood of the current alternative" and that these predispositions inhibit an organization from considering radically new alternatives. Moreover, search will be biased, because the subunit that does the searching will not see the environment as others might see it. Bias in communication is "substantially" ignored unless internal biases are in the same direction. Types of bias are listed as: ". . . (1) bias reflecting special training or</page><page sequence="16">212 / REVIEWERS' CORNER experience of various parts of the organization, (2) bias reflecting the inter- action of hopes and expectations, and (3) communication biases reflecting unresolved conflict within the organization." (p. 122) Some Price-Output Models and Research One specific report is based on research in department-store activities by C. G. Moore. The retailing model is considered to be an exercise in simple model construction and is among the few studies that this reviewer -feels have not been over-generalized. The predictive ability of the model, when tested against actual results, was very good, and, with a few minor exceptions, the assumptions reflect an intimate knowledge of trade practice. Sales estimation in terms of advance orders and reorders was more or less standard and was based on the usual historical data. A more general study, developed in collaboration with K. J. Cohen and P. 0. Soelberg, sets out to construct an n-firm, oligopolistic model. A suitable computer is programmed and a lengthy simulation is run. A fantastic amount of detail is given in the form of computer flow charts for output, price, and sales strategy decisions, and no less than fifty-four pages of the book are devoted to a sample computer printout. As a result, computer experts will probably be bored, while many other readers will be lost and unable to follow the model's period-to-period reaction to output, price and strategy decisions. Decisions are made in response to feedback, and they involve search and adaptation. Profit goals, inventory (and production), and sales goals are outlined. The discussion of these goals, and the assumed managerial rules-of-thumb in regard to them, could easily be modified for inclusion in elementary economics or accounting courses. Output is set in response to sales expectations and inventory plans. Inventory is subject to an "excess" limit that brings complaints from certain members of the organization and a "runout" lower limit that leads to complaints from other members. The profit goal adapts to past profit achievements. With respect to setting price: ". . . the firm first checks three environmental characteristics-costs of manufacture, the effects of past price changes, and competitors' long-run price behavior." (p. 154) The sales goal depends on aspiration levels with regard to volume of sales, share of market, and on a competitive price goal that is condi- tioned by the desires of the sales force. If things should not be going well the following search steps are taken "sequentially . .. until the need for search is removed. (1) Organizational slack is reduced [a natural and uni- versal consequence?]. (2) Inventory excess limit is reduced. (3) Pressure is placed on sales for improved performance. (4) Expenditure for sales promo- tion is decreased. (5) If all of the other procedures fail, the profit goal is reduced." (p. 156) The impatient reader should resist the impulse to point out that simula- tion results are inherent (even entailed) in the model itself. A similar situa-</page><page sequence="17">REVIEWERS' CORNER / 213 tion is common in ordinary logical analysis, where nothing new is reflected in the conclusions, although the rearrangements may lead to psychological insights that amount to new information. Unlike the department store study, the n-firm model has not been tested for predictive ability, and due to its complicated structure necessary empirical tests may not even be possible. A model of managerial behavior is based on the research of 0. E. William- son and proves to be an interesting construction. The author is impatient with the usual discussions of preference functions and wishes to apply the concept of organizational slack in conjunction with the simple assumption (long familiar to accountants) that ". . . managers conduct the affairs of the firm so as to attend to their own best interests... ." (p. 238). In the process he wishes to establish (contrary to Papandreou) that empirical studies are little or no more difficult with a general preference function than with the usual profit maximization assumption. Williamson cites Shackle with approval and points out that firms sheltered from fierce competition often use their shelter to establish security. He equates security from the rigors of competition to organizational slack and states: "Although our preference function allows the single-minded pursuit of profit maximizing-objectives, this occurs not as a general, but as a special case." (p. 240) Williamson starts with the assumption of a coalition but argues that: ". . . managers ... operate the firm so as to maximize a utility function that has as principal components (1) salaries, (2) staff, (3) discretionary spending for invest- ments, and (4) management slack absorbed as cost." (p. 241) Management may wish to increase its own salary position by "building pressures from below through staffing . . ." and also use staff for prestige, security, flexibil- ity, etc. Discretionary spending relates to management's power to divert resources to its own use (office furniture, travel, perquisites) where the expenditures are partially buried in the reporting service and are made on less over-all economic reasons than usual capital budgeting decisions. These expenditures must be charged against revenues, for the author points out: "Discretionary spending for investment represents the difference be- tween reported profits and minimum profits demanded." (p. 242) The author is a little confusing with his unorthodox use of traditional accounting terms (p. 243), but accountants will be interested in his classifi- cation of profits. "Maximum" profits . . . are profits that the strictly profit-maximizing firm would obtain...... "Actual" profits ... are profits actually earned by the firm that has its objective function augmented to include a "staff" component.... "Reported" profits . . . are the profits the firm admits to and are actual profits reduced by the amount of management slack absorbed as cost...... "Minimum" ... profits ... are profits negotiated by the other members of the coalition that are just sufficient to satisfy their demands. Cost accountants will be especially interested in the author's comments on cost reduction. ". . . we recognize that the objective of cost reduction implies a low preference for staff. Hence, the manager with a lower pref-</page><page sequence="18">214 / REVIEWERS' CORNER erence for staff than his predecessor will typically be able to achieve signifi- cant reductions in staff without impairing performance." (p. 250) Clearly, this process has some pretty sharp (and unmentioned) limits, for at some point "staff" must change from a place to hide "slack" to an "economic" function. Moreover, "the objective of cost reduction" might conceivably have other implications. The extension of his attitude to public utilities is a small step. In these industries it is asserted that "... there is a positive reward for absorbing profits without an offsetting penalty." (p. 250) Most readers will accept the "safe-level" approach to profits and the presence of strong tendencies toward excess staff and "managerial accommodations," but few will go along completely with the following statement: "Not only is there a virtual guarantee that rates will be set to cover costs and permit the utility to show earnings sufficient to attract new capital; in addition, the regulatory commissions have not attempted to control costs." (p. 250) The final research model is concerned with investment behavior and is based on the work of G. P. E. Clarkson. This model is concerned with constructing a mechanism that will predict the investment decisions of a trust investment officer in a medium-sized national bank, given specified information. The performance of this kind of model ought not to surprise us; for, with definite clues and sharp rules for weighting evidence, a computer may be expected fewer "mental" lapses and to be disturbed less by ir- relevancies than most human decision makers. The predictive ability may not be so good, however, unless the machine is complicated enough to consider all nuances and special-case considerations that an individual might bring into his decision pattern. An individual might, of course, handle these items badly; so, instead of comparing the securities selected by the model with those selected by the trust officer, one might wish to compare both selections to some outside standard. Computer storage was constructed to hold lists of firms and industries along with data on growth rates, dividend rates, expected yields and price- earnings ratios. A search and selection mechanism was then constructed to select industries and securities with given characteristics. Finally, a set of rules was included to approximate the usual investment rules of thumb. In modern business literature, the term "rule-of-thumb" is often semantically slanted and usually indicates the writer's disagreement with the rule or with the way in which it has been derived. Some rules are relevant, some are consistent, some are easy to apply, but attributing them to the "thumb" is not very enlightening. Clarkson, incidentally, accepts investment rules- of-thumb without obvious condescension and uses them effectively. A set of characteristics is established for each security and includes earnings and cash flows per share, profit margins, and dividends for the past ten years. Economy and industry forecasts are reduced to "below, above and equal to" and the forecasts of a leading investment service are accepted. The model ". . . first determines the relative performance of each company with respect to the other companies in its industry; ... [and then]</page><page sequence="19">REVIEWERS' CORNER / 215 determines the relative value of each company's stock with respect to current market valuation." (p. 259) It is argued that the list of suitable stocks is stable over time due to the caution of trust investors and the possibility of court action. The types of client programs are classified from growth to income. A scanner arrays the firms in each industry according to the desired attributes and the selector tests them until a selection is made. Diversification is introduced by insisting that each portfolio contain investments in at least five industries. Needless to say, the comparison of computer selections with actual selections in most test cases showed a very high correspondence and ". . . strongly supports the hypothesis that the model's mechanisms have captured a considerable portion of the trust investment process." (p. 266) The Budgeting Process and Internal Resource Allocations The concluding chapter is a summary of the authors' behavioral theory along with some new material on the budgeting process. It is argued that classical economics, "By assuming the effective operation of an external price system. . . has largely by-passed internal allocation as a focus of attention...." In budgeting (as in pricing) we expect to find that goals tend to enter as more or less independent constraints.... Where an allocation plan apparently meets the constraints, we expect rather loose evaluation of the accuracy of the estimates. ... Where resource rationing is necessary, we expect ... a tendency to use arbitrary allocative rules that maintain the relative positions of the members of the coalition . . . a tendency to re-evaluate those estimates that are relatively difficult to defend in terms of traditional organizational practice, standard ac- counting procedure, or immediacy of tangible return. (p. 270) The verdict rendered in regard to the accountant's allocations of common costs is not too charitable: "... . when there is interdependence among activities.. evaluation depends on partially arbitrary rules for allocating common inputs and outputs. The rules tend to be biased in the direction of producing data leading to organizational acceptance of projects favored by particular subunits." (p. 271) Capital budgeting is discussed with no empiri- cal support except scattered references to an unpublished manuscript by L. R. Pondy (who is responsible for the semantic monstrosity "necessitous investment") and the dicta that flow from the theory are, at least here, unconfirmed. Some uneasiness is felt on this point. The authors conclude that the target total budget is set with regard to the amount one "can afford to spend," and they expect this total to be "relatively independent" of investment opportunities. It is further expected that the target will be self-confirming on the upward side, for ". . . the search for new projects on the part of subunits and the optimistic inflation of estimates of returns from pet projects will assure the authorization of the full budget." (p. 272) Presumably, management at some point has its own pet project of creating</page><page sequence="20">216 / REVIEWERS' CORNER a little over-all liquidity slack, and, if so, the statement becomes tautologi- cal. Pondy's budget allocation assumptions are especially interesting to managerial accountants. On the basis of "such considerations as historical legitimacy, current organizational emphasis, and presumed performance" approximate allocations are made to broad project classes. This allocation is taken as fixed for the finer subsequent assignments, and such allocations continue until the "goals are shared enough to allow an explicit, complete ranking of individual projects." Some flexibility can be introduced by changing project specifications instead of budget appropriations. "When project costs threatened to exceed authorization by more than the fixed percentage, the usual response was to redesign the project and search for alternative sources of components rather than seek a new authorization." (p. 273) The authors' treatment of transfer pricing is general and is included under the heading of subunit allocation and transfer payments. Subunit allocation is considerably more difficult than project allocation; subunit activities are more complicated and they persist-resulting in historical precedents and "prejudices." Increase in vertical integration has a complicating effect. The accountant's approach is widened to include: ... allocative procedures by which the organization disaggregates performance and transfers accounting credit for performance from one divisional ledger to another. These procedures include the allocation of overhead, various preferen- tial-treatment market systems for the purchase of goods . .. organizational conventions for determining subunit responsibility for receipts or disburse- ments ... and an assortment of informal devices for exchanging budgetary al- lotments. (p. 275) In the cold-blooded jungle that makes up the coalition: ... the concepts of "efficiency" and "fairness" have limited utility. In fact, we expect to find that organizational participants view the rules for making transfer payments as largely arbitrary.... Subunit success involves dealing effectively with the environment and negotiating effectively with the organization on ac- counting conventions. (p. 276) The implications of this position for the accounting profession are im- portant. Modern cost accounting deals with efficiency, and presumably this portion of the subject is thrown out the window along with the last vestiges of ethical content. The field then becomes a set of conventions that is said to provide one of the major battlegrounds for a fierce and long-run negotiat- ing process. Perhaps like some statistical techniques, accounting procedures are loose and not obvious to everyone enabling all bargaining parties to make their positions appear legitimate by citing some convenient esoteric accounting rule or statistical technique. If this hypothesis is true, it seems that bargaining would be almost entirely on other grounds, with flexible accounting "principles" becoming the rationalizations by which the actual outcomes are defended and legitimized. The Cyert-March position is,</page><page sequence="21">REVIEWERS' CORNER / 217 apparently, that accounting conventions have no more normative content than, say, attendance rules. Thus, favorable accounting treatment becomes a payoff objective of the bargaining process. We cannot debate this position here, but accountants like to believe that their "principles" have broad application and are too well-accepted to be simple pawns in each individual bargaining session. The authors' behavioral theory has some difficulty in explaining innova- tions. If search is in response to problems, it would seem to follow that troubled firms should carry on most business research. Such, obviously, is not the case. For an answer the authors turn to their own creation, slack. Slack provides a source of funds for innovations that would not be approved in the face of scarcity but that have strong subunit support.. . . These are not problem- oriented innovations. In the short run they contribute mostly to subunit goals (professional status, subunit prestige, and so forth), but some portion of them turn out to be major technological improvements. (p. 279) The weakness of this specific explanation is clear to everyone, but, more important, the explanation is obviously consistent with the theory. To Cyert and March some decisions are "economic" and involve allocation in the face of scarcity and some decisions-those involving slack-are not economic so long as they do not transgress certain loose constraints. Where there is abundance, there is certainly no point to rigid economizing assump- tions. But is there that much abundance? Even without over-all abundance, there may be slack; it is clear that many developing countries are allocating their meager output as if scarcity were not a factor. At least they do not appear to be using the marginal rule. The theory can develop other possible explanations, but alternate ex- planations are apparently not acceptable to the writers. For example, it might be argued that management and all subunits have a stake in simple survival, stability or growth. Then, the search for long-run development becomes "problematic" in a very specific way and should satisfy the au- thors' commitment to a problematic basis for search activity. It may even be argued that slack itself may be developed, extinguished and otherwise manipulated in accordance with economic rules that allocate scarce re- sources. However, the concept of slack and the assumption that it is not allocated "economically" is at the core of the Cyert-March behavioral theory. When this attitude is combined with their reluctance to deal with long-run expectations, it is not surprising that their theory of innovations is extremely weak. A little strength could be added to their "explanation" by assuming that subunit use of short-run slack may be devoted to strength- ening a particular subunit position without weakening others so that there is a tendency to strengthen the entire organization. The writers try hard to differentiate their product from operations re- search and management science, but the differentiation will remain a little vague to some readers. Mention of organization charts is made without an</page><page sequence="22">218 / REVIEWERS' CORNER automatic in-group snicker, and it is rightly pointed out that such charts do a poor job of reflecting informal control and authority, that they tend to over-emphasize functions and under-emphasize personal relations, and that they "usually exaggerate the isomorphism between the authority system and the communication system." With regard to predicting behavior of competing organizations, some hope is expressed for the model, but the authors wryly point out: "Use of such models will scarcely eliminate the use of other more classic devices of tactical intelligence-spying, trial balloons, analysis of public information, and direct observation." (p. 292) The rational manager is no longer able to "treat the organization as a simple instrument in his dealings with the external world. Just as he needs to predict and attempt to manipulate the 'external' environment, he must predict and attempt to manipulate his own firm." (p. 292) One suspects that most managers would agree emphatically with this conclusion without reading A Behavioral Theory of the Firm. Supplementary Comments on Methodology A Behavioral Theory of the Firm ends with two appendices devoted to the Friedman thesis and computer methodology. The material of Appendix A (Cyert and E. Grunberg) is devoted first to a summary of Hempel's posi- tion on theory formation and second to "answering" Friedman's contro- versial judgment that the meaningful test of premises is whether or not they aid in prediction. Notwithstanding the statistical background of the senior writer and the philosophical competence of his partner, the transcription of Hempel (1948) is not distinguished. The barely-tolerable distinction be- tween explanation and prediction is emphasized with explanation naively- related to the past and prediction to the future.' The writers are reduc- tionists and wish to reduce all statements to the empirical level, but their application of the Kantian distinction between empirical data and con- stitutive definitions does not extend beyond the following statement re- garding the function of "methodology": "to evaluate the content, sig- nificance, and status of propositions dealing directly or indirectly with observables. . .. the function of methodology is not to provide rules of discovery." This material should interest accountants at a time when the American 3 C. G. Hempel and P. Oppenheim, "Studies in the Logic of Explanation," Philos- ophy of Science, 15 (1948), pp. 135-178. A non-cited discussion of this approach may be found in Henry Margenau, The Nature of Physical Reality (New York: McGraw- Hill Book Company, Inc., 1950), esp. Ch. 6. Incidentally, Margenau does not agree with the Cyert-Grunberg explanation-prediction distinction. "The word prediction, as used in science, does not mean 'forecast' in a temporal sense." (p. 105) For more detail: see, Margenau, Chapters 5 and 12, Warren S. Torgerson, Theory and Methods of Scaling (New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1958), Ch. 1 passim, and a later Hempel, Fundamentals of Concept Formation in Empirical Science (Chicago: Univer- sity of Chicago Press, 1952), esp. p. 36 ff.</page><page sequence="23">REVIEWERS' CORNER / 219 Institute of Certified Public Accountants is searching frantically for prin- ciples, postulates, and related entities. A useful theoretical structure sug- gests where we should dig for new empirical facts and indicates what facts we may hope to find. If our prediction is borne out, the theory is not only a deductive model of worth; its empirical interpretations bear some relevance to the world of experience. Confidence depends on a number of considera- tions, but the strength of one's belief in the predictive ability of the theory is certainly influenced in some way by both positive and negative instances from the digging process. The authors introduce their theoretical discussion as an instrument for demolishing Friedman. The Friedman thesis is, essentially, that the as- sumptions of a theory need not all be "realistic" and their "adequacy" must be judged entirely by their ability to provide implications which make the entire theory a successful predictor. While the Friedman presentation may be (at best) ambiguous and (at worst) misleading,4 the Cyert-Grunberg critique does not solve its difficulties or demolish its content. The Cyert-Grunberg criticism begins with a distinction between those scientists who use some laws from other disciplines, and economists who use many law-like statements from the field of economics itself. Apparently, this distinction is based on the ability to partition the disciplines so that one can find an area in which there are only externally-verifiable, endogenous variables eliminating the need for ceteris paribus. This reviewer is skeptical of finding any scientist in any discipline who would claim that he had re- moved all effects of ceteris paribus simply by redefining the system. Ceteris paribus is necessary to transfer the variable from one system to another unless knowledge is so perfect that influences from the transitional environ- ment can be completely accounted for. The authors are right in pointing out that the term "realistic" is not ordinarily appropriate for high-level constructs. They are also correct in saying: "If no more satisfactory hypothesis can be found at the time, the disconfirmed hypothesis will remain in use for those classes of events for which it has been found to lead to correct predictions." (p. 308) Clearly, our confidence in its predicting ability is increased if somewhere we can find other useful connections in which the questionable "assumption" aids prediction. If it predicts wrong in some cases, we have problems of deter- mining areas of relevance, looking for missing variables, etc., and we might, 4Friedman's presentation may be found in Essays in Positive Economics (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1953), approximately the first fifty pages. An analogous position is expressed by Whitehead and Russell in the preface of Principia Mathe- matica: ". . . any theory on the principles of mathematics must always be inductive. ... In mathematics, the greatest degree of self-evidence is usually not found quite at the beginning, but at some later point; hence the early deductions, until they reach this point give reasons rather for believing the premises because true consequences follow from them, than for believing the consequences because they follow from the premises. "</page><page sequence="24">220 / REVIEWERS' CORNER as the authors suggest, feel less uneasy if we did not have to use the theory at all. Nevertheless, as long as predictions are satisfactory, most scientists will not be overly concerned about their inability to "prove" the "realism" of all their assumptions in some arbitrarily selected meta-system. Undoubtedly the Cyert-Grunberg criticism is high level. Their "system" may be rigidly restricted, but their confidence is, apparently, an unbounded universe. Listen: ... we ... maintain that our recommendation can lead to the discovery of gen- eral laws and hence to models with predictive and explanatory power.... and that the empirical laws of economics should be based on propositions of behavior that can be disconfirmed independently from the economic situations.... (p. 309) They [models] should show the complete map of alternatives under the variety of conditions of the real world. Thus we will be able to eliminate the usual ceteris paribus condition.
