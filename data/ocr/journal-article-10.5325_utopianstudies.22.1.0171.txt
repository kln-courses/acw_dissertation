Reviewed by Claire Bracken, Union College   Out of  the Earth: Ecocritical Readings of  Irish Texts is a signifi cant collection of   essays in a mode of  critical inquiry that is becoming an increasing fi eld of   importance in literary and cultural studies. But perhaps “mode” is not the best  way to describe the practices of  ecocriticism. Following Lawrence Buell, we  can consider it to be “issue-driven” rather than functioning as a specifi c meth- odology, imagining it as a space that “gathers itself  around a commitment to  environmentality” (2004, 11). In this way, academic ecocritical works can be  interpreted as having a shared material bedrock, all the while navigating diff er- ent routes and pathways in their travels over, across, and within the spaces of   the earth. The essays in O ut of  the Earth display such exciting variability, deploy- ing as they do diff erent locations (theoretical, generic, aesthetic, temporal) from  which to consider the intersections between Irish landscape and text, between  people and place. Given the overdetermination of  the cultural and political sig- nifi cance of  land in the Irish historical imaginary due to the specifi cs of  imperi- alism, decolonization, and, most recently, capitalist development, the innovative  textual readings of  this collection are a real and noteworthy achievement.   In the main, the texts considered in O ut of  the Earth are literary, encom- passing poetry, drama, fi ction, and memoir, with the one exception being  Eóin Flannery’s piece on late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century touristic  writing and poster pictures. The collection is bookended with an introduction  by the renowned ecocritic John Elder and a concluding  interview by the  Utopian Studies, Vol. 22, No. 1, 2011  Copyright © 2011.

The  interview is fascinating for the account it gives of  the self  (in this case the  mapping and writing self ) in connection with place, as Robinson discusses his  method of  getting to know the landscapes he charts, which incorporates the  textual and the material, but in such a way that disrupts the binary of  nature/ culture, as the material is shown to be infused with the textual and vice versa,  since the “world is total interconnectivity” (207).   Indeed, all the essays in the book address the nature/culture divide, with  some interrogating the historical privileging of  culture in literary criticism  and others, such as Flannery’s, challenging the division  altogether in favor of   a strategy of  “dwelling in the world,” a form of  locatedness that allows for  an ecocriticism of  material and historical specifi city. His postcolonial critique  and assessment of  imperialist touristic texts of   Ireland, which were domina- ted by images of  the rural picturesque and the ruin, reveal the way in which  ecocritical discourse can be placed in dialogue with other forms of  critical  and theoretical registers. This is also evident in  Jeff erson  Holdridge’s essay on  Lady Morgan’s  The Wild Irish Girl and William  Carleton’s T he Black Prophet ,  which interweaves a discussion on the aesthetic—the “sublime” and “beauti- ful” Irish landscape—with a  politicized colonial context of  union that allows  for the unsettling power of  the nonhuman to be articulated and brought  forth. Donna Potts’s  article on Michael Longley’s “environmental elegies”  similarly laces the political with the natural, demonstrating the dual and con- nective  functioning of  the poetry as speaking to both Northern Ireland and  environmental issues at once. Neither is privileged; rather, both are valued in  their i nterconnectedness.   The romanticization of  the Irish landscape, in both imperialist and  nationalist discourses, is addressed by many of  the essays in the collection,  something of  crucial importance in an ecocritical context given the appropri- ating gesture involved. Cultural representations of  the Aran Islands have been  saturated in this way, as explored by Karen O’Brien in her analysis of  Martin  McDonagh’s contemporary play T he Cripple of  Inismaan , where she focuses  on the emblem of  rock fi ssure as a symbol of  the constructedness (and hence  artifi ciality) of  representations. Thus, the deployment of  landscape as symbol  is reappropriated and turned in on itself. Joy  Kennedy-O’Neill’s article is also  concerned with the space of  the islands, specifi cally looking at Synge’s play   Riders to the Sea and the powerful force of  the ocean, performing a revaluation  of  critical work on Synge that has focused on language and culture.  172 UtS_22.1_Book_Reviews.indd   172 23/03/11   5:13 PM </page> <page sequence="3"> Book Reviews  The potential of  ecocritical discourse to open up and revaluate  canonical  interpretations engages Joanna Tap Pierce’s comprehensive essay on Elizabeth  Bowen, which questions readings of  place in Bowen’s work that determine  it in terms of  symbolic representation. Pierce’s tracing of  the relationship  between place and self  in  Bowen’s Court ,  Seven Winters , and  The Last September  demonstrates the importance of  setting as a living entity, thus deconstructing  an anthropomorphic critical lens, a move also performed by Greg Winston in  his essay on George Moore’s  The Untilled Field . In his analysis of  the stories,  Winston stays close to the material realities of  harsh agrarian landscapes in  post-Famine Ireland, considering the “interconnected realities of  emigration,  landscape and Irish identity” (84).   While many of  the essays focus on the rural, vistas of  the urban are  also present, refl ective of  more general trends in ecocriticism that aim to  open up the meaning of  what constitutes the natural environment. This is  evident in Miriam O’Kane Mara’s piece on Roddy Doyle, which considers  pollution and place in  Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha , establishing the novel as a  critique on capitalist development in postmodern Irish culture. Similarly,  Kathryn Kirkpatrick considers the urban poetics of  contemporary poet  Paula Meehan, analyzing her work from an ecofeminist perspective, con- sidering the cultural connections between woman and landscape as having  the potential to disrupt the patriarchal machineries of  neoliberal capitalism.  Maureen O’Connor takes up a comparable position in her essay on Edna  O’Brien. She examines the fi gural connections between animal and woman  in O’Brien’s work as marking the abjection of  the feminine in patriarchal  cultures, an abjection that has the power to unsettle and disturb. Kirkpatrick’s  and O’Connor’s critical frames are unusual in the context of  Irish feminist crit- icism more generally, which has tended to focus more on separating woman  from nature and the Mother Ireland construction. Interestingly, then, their  ecocritical analysis opens up space for new ways of  thinking about embodied  feminine subjectivity in contemporary cultural analysis.   As a whole,  Out of  the Earth engenders a reconsideration of  construc- tions of  Irish subjectivity. Eamonn Wall’s essay on poet Richard Murphy (the  fi rst essay in the book) provides a theoretical overview of  ecocritical theory  and demonstrates how this form of  reading allows us to establish connec- tions to the materiality of  land. This  eff ect is something shared by all the  essays in the collection, thus having the important consequence of  negoti- ating the structure of  self hood (a separated, divided Oedipal subject) as it  173 UtS_22.1_Book_Reviews.indd   173 23/03/11   5:13 PM </page> <page sequence="4"> Utopian Studies 22.1 has been  traditionally constructed in the Irish imaginary. It establishes new  and  diff erent paradigms for the fi eld of  Irish studies, establishing a dialogue  between it and an interdisciplinary subject of  current and future infl uential  signifi cance. This excellent collection will be not just of  use to scholars of   ecocriticism and Irish literature alike but also an invaluable student guide for  current and future courses on the subject.
