Abramov RDPE Zvezda James W. McBarron II NASA/Johnson Space Center ABSTRACT America and Russia have independently implemented designs of individual life support systems to provide extrave- hicular activity (EVA) capability in support of the Space Shuttle and Orbital Station Mir programs. With the end of the "cold war," and establishment of new cooperative relation- ships between America and Russia, joint space ventures are being planned. Mixed American and Russian crews are currently training for upcoming Space Shuttle and Orbital Station Mir missions with a Shuttle-to-Mir rendezvous flight scheduled for 1995. While not currently planned, a joint American and Rus- sian effort to develop and demonstrate Space Shuttle and Mir compatibility to conduct an extravehicular crew rescue from either country's spacecraft would appear to be a desir- able future objective. One of the first steps necessary to achieve this objective is to identify and better understand each country's current extravehicular individual life support systems and host vehicle's interface characteristics. This paper introduces the American Space Shuttle Ex- travehicular Mobility Unit, called the EMU, and the Russian Orbital Space Station Mir extravehicular spacesuit, called Orlan DMA, by comparing macroscopic features and char- acteristics. These include a discussion of task and physio- logical requirements, host vehicles characteristics, and the system architecture for each country's individual life support system. INTRODUCTION The cosmonauts of Russia and the astronauts of the United States of America have performed a significant amount of extravehicular activity (EVA) for their respective countries. Currently, both the Russians and Americans have performed many dozens of EVA sorties totaling several hundred hours of EVA (1). Russian EVAs were performed from Voshkod-2, Soyuz 5 to 4, and the Orbital Space Sta- tions Salyut-6, Salyut-7 and Mir. American EVAs were per- formed during the Gemini, Apollo, Skylab and Shuttle pro- grams. In general terms, astronauts and cosmonauts per- formed these EVAs in support of objectives in science, con- struction, maintenance and repair. The overall EVA experi- ence supports the belief that both the American and Russian space programs have developed comparable extravehicular activity capabilities. Given the current climate of internation- al cooperation in space, it is appropriate to evaluate and compare the similarities and differences in the approaches to individual EVA life support systems taken by the American and Russian space programs. This paper presents an overview of the American and Russian extravehicular individual life support systems cur- rently in operational service for the Shuttle Orbiter and Orbit- ing Space Station Mir, respectively. When speaking interna- tionally, these systems are now collectively referred to as "Extravehicular Individual Life Support Systems" (EILSS) to distinguish them from the spacecraft internal environmental control and life support system (ECLSS). This paper com- pares macroscopic features of overall architecture, life sup- port systems and space suits comprising the Shuttle EMU and Mir Orlan DMA EILSSs. DISCUSSION Extravehicular activity burst upon the world scene in 1965 (1). In those heady and frantic days of the cold war "Space Race" first the Russian Alexi Leonov and then, within 2 1/2 months, the American Edward White performed the first space walks. They climbed out of the pressurized cabins of their respective spacecraft and were exposed the vacuum and temperatures of space, protected only by their space- suits and sustained only by oxygen delivered by umbilicais from their host spacecraft's life support systems. 1358</page><page sequence="2">From the beginning both Russian and American Space experts recognized EVA's potential importance to manned space operations. In both cases, as soon as each nation could orbit more than one person in a single spacecraft, EVA was demonstrated and its capability and utility were rapidly developed. Now, nearly 30 years after the first EVAs, both Russia and America have mature zero-gravity EVA capabili- ties embodied within their respective manned spaceflight programs. The Mir Orlan DMA and Shuttle EMU designs both depend on three principal factors. These are: • Task Requirements: Both America and Russia conduct zero-g, low Earth orbit missions that require EVA to perform vehicle assembly, maintenance, repair and payioad support operations. In turn, these tasks require human proximity and participation, which drive EVA re- quirements to support human strength, mobility, dexter- ity, vision and decision-making capabilities at the EVA work site. It is therefore not surprising that both the American EMU and Russian Orlan DMA are essentially anthropomorphic enclosures that seek to impose mini- mum restrictions on human visual and physical capabil- ity. Refer to Figure 1 . FIGURE 1. RUSSIAN AND AMERICAN EXTRAVEHICULAR INDIVIDUAL LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS • Phvsiolooical Requirements: Humans in space vacu- um require atmosphere composition and conditions of pressure and temperature somewhat similar to those inside their spacecraft. These, in turn drive the life support and pressure-retention capabilities of the EILSS. Again, it is not surprising that both the American and Russian Orlan DMA life support systems address the same issues. Refer to Table 1 . • Host Vehicle Characteristics: In space, EVA operations depend totally on the host vehicle for consumables and service. The host vehicle is the EVA support base. Due to the intimate relationship between host vehicle and EILSS, the EILSS design is optimized to be supported very efficiently by its host vehicle. However, the host vehicle is itself a product of its nation's space program, and thus embodies the strengths, compromises and constraints characterizing that program. As the Russian and American space programs have produced vehicles as different as the Orbital Space Sta- tion Mir and Shuttle Orbiter, they have also spawned the Orlan DMA and Shuttle EMU. Herein, lie the differences between the two EILSSs. The evolution of the American and Russian Space pro- grams warrants a short discussion to explain the most ob- vious differences between the Orlan DMA and Shuttle EMU. In the early 1970's, both Russia and America turned their attention in manned space to Earth-orbiting space stations. Russia continued its development of expendable spacecraft based on the Soyuz concept (2) to transport human crews to orbit and return them to Earth for manning the orbiting Salyut and later Mir space stations. To support long orbital manned missions, Russia also developed the expendable Progress vehicle (2) to reprovisión the orbiting space stations periodi- cally. Progress uses ground controlled rendezvous and docking (2) and has no need to survive reentry on the return trip to Earth. Thus, orbital resupply using automated, ex- pendable spacecraft is a well developed, routine operation- al capability of the Russian space program. Consumables for EVA support, such as water for heat rejection and thermal control, oxygen for breathing and pres- sure control, lithium hydroxide for carbon dioxide removal and batteries for electrical power are routinely resupplied to orbit in the Progress and stowed there until needed. During a resupply period, provisions are off-loaded from Progress into Mir as needed and waste materials are removed from Mir and stowed aboard Progress as generated. Just before the next Progress spacecraft arrives, the current Progress is jetti- soned from Mir to burn up during atmospheric reentry. Waste materials include Orlan DMAs that have completed their use- ful life, minus any salvageable parts. Thus, once delivered to orbit, the Orlan DMA becomes an expendable, space based system, drawing on consumables delivered from Earth that have minimal interaction with internal vehicle pow- er, water and oxygen supply systems aboard the Mir. Orlan DMA's total useful life is approximately 4 years; 1 year on Earth followed by 3 years in space supporting 15-20 EVA sorties with limb soft goods replacement aboard Mir (1). 1359</page><page sequence="3">Table 1 .

In the post-Apollo days of the mid 1970's, the decision was made to emphasize access to space rather than continued presence in space, and the Shuttle Orbiter was to be the principal launch vehicle for both human and large unmanned payloads. To reduce operating costs, as much of the Shuttle system was made reusable as could be afforded under the space budget's annual funding caps. This approach was based on the technological foundations of hypersonic flight research of the X-15 program and lifting body aerodynamic research of the X-24 program (3). Initial- ly, EVA capability was intended only to handle Shuttle ve- hicle contingencies such as manual payload bay door clo- sure and payload retraction or jettisoning. These EVA opera- tions would become necessary only if the automated primary and backup equipment failed, because the Orbiter and its crew cannot survive reentry with the payload bay doors open. From these contingency-use beginnings, American zero-gravity EVA capability has been developed to its pres- ent level, where valuable scientific spacecraft such as the Hubble Space Telescope are designed for on-orbit EVA ser- vice and maintenance, and the International Space Station will rely on U.S.-supplied EVA for assembly and operations. Because the Shuttle Orbiter is an Earth-to-orbit and return vehicle, its consumables come from Earth and current- ly do not have to last more than approximately two weeks on-orbit. Cryogenic oxygen and hydrogen feedstocks are practical expendables for fuel cells producing electric power as the primary product and ultrapure potable water as a by-product. Cryogenic oxygen is also the source of the Shuttle's breathing oxygen. Consumables for EVA are brought from Earth in the Shuttle, but unlike Mir, the EMU consumables, except lithium hydroxide canisters, are indistinguishable from other orbiter consumables. The EMU draws its oxygen from vehicle tanks replenished from on-board cryogenic storage. Water and electric power come from Orbiter systems. The EMUs return unused condensate to the Oribter's waste water system. These EVA consumables are totally comingled with the Or- biter's on-board consumables. And like the Shuttle itself, the EMU undergoes tum-around processing (limited speci- fied cleaning, maintenance, resizing and checkout) on the ground before its next trip into space. Both the Shuttle Orbiter and its EMU are reusable, Earth-based systems. They are used in space, but are maintained on the ground. Currently, the American program is extending EMU sortie capability and on-orbit duration to meet requirements of satellite service, life support research and Space Station assembly and operations support. When this process is complete, the American EMU will be space- based on-board Station for a specific time period. It will also continue to be ground based and reusable and to draw its consumables largely from the on-board systems of both its host spacecrafts, now Shuttle Orbiter and soon-to-be Space Station. The American EMU design life (4) is 100 EVA sorties over 15 years with ground maintenance including replacement of life-limited items. Extending hard element life beyond 1 5 years is currently being investigated to reduce replacement costs. Softgoods life is a minimum of 8 years. System Architecture Outwardly the Mir Orlan DMA and Shuttle EMU re- semble each other. As previously discussed, they both sup- port the same human capabilities required to perform similar EVA tasks. Thus, they both are single-person anthropomor- phic enclosures with rigid upper torso elements, flexible limbs, dexterous gloves and transparent helmets with adjust- able sun visors. Both use back-mounted life support sys- tems and chest-mounted display and control units, and both use flexible umbilicais for connection to the servicing sys- tems in their respective host spacecraft. The most obvious visible difference between the Orlan DMA and the Shuttle EMU is the entry closure. Referto Figure 2 (5). The Shuttle EMU uses a waist entry don/doff concept. The spacesuit includes a waist disconnect allowing separa- tion of the upper torso and lower torso. The astronaut first dons the lower torso, and then dons the upper torso. The waist entry closure minimizes don/doff volume, allowing the Orbiter airlock to be small. The waist entry concept is also compatible with the waist bearing on the lower torso (4) . This bearing permits upper torso rotation when legs are secured in foot restraints, thus increasing the astronaut's reach and effective task performance envelope. By contrast the Orlan DMA uses a rear entry concept. The upper torso is closed by a back door which encloses the life support system. The rear entry concept, shown in Figure 2, is quicker to don than the waist closure concept and provides truly unassisted don/doff. It does, however, require a larger airlock diameter (5) to accommodate simultaneous don/doff by both EV crewmembers. 1361</page><page sequence="5">FIGURE 2. ENTRY CLOSURES, DONNING/DOFFING The Shuttle EMU'S life support system is bolted to the rear of the hard upper torso. Thus all life support components are external to the pressurized suit envelope and are ex- posed to space vacuum. All leakage paths are thus over- board. This is an advantage when designing to accommo- date large gas leakage failure modes: they will not overpres- surize the suit. However, it also drives the need for very stringent component leakage requirements. Small leakages are lost overboard and cannot be reclaimed. By contrast, the vent loop, secondary oxygen system and regulators of the primary oxygen system of the Orlan DMA are all located within the pressurized closure of the suit (1). Sealing of ventilation loop components can be less stringent: low levels of leakage pass harmlessly into the suit. Thus the Orlan DMA design lends itself to on-orbit replace- ment of accessible components located within the suit vol- ume. However, special fire safety precautions are required because all of these components are located in a pure oxy- gen environment (1). The Shuttle EMU does not feature this degree of on-orbit maintainability because reverifying that stringent leakage requirements have been met is difficult after component replacement on-orbit. 1362</page><page sequence="6">Figure 3 (1 ) shows relative sizes and weights of the two systems. The American EMU accommodates a slightly larg- er range of crewmember sizes and the system weighs more. Part of the weight difference is due to the suit arm and waist bearings that the Orlan DMA omits, and some is in compo- nent weights designed for reusability and very long life. By contrast, the Shuttle EMU's life support system volume is smaller than Orlan DMA's, and yet it is designed for 7 hours of autonomous operation versus 6 hours for the Orlan DMA. Here requirements for a small Shuttle airlock and passage through the Orbiter interdeck hatch significantly drove EMU front-to-back depth dimensions. Absence of that require- ment allowed a more "spread out" arrangement for the Orlan DMA's life support components. The latter fosters on-orbit maintenance, which is essential for being space-based. By contrast, Shuttle EMU life support system is so tightly pack- aged that only very few components are considered to be replaceable on-orbit. This reinforces the notion of ground- maintenance, and requires that future space basing duration be essentially failure-free for components requiring ground replacement. On the other hand, the Orlan DMA life support is taller and narrower than the Shuttle EMU's life support system, allowing it to pass easily through the smaller Mir EVA hatch opening.

SHUTTLE EMU - ORLAN DMA SIZE AND WEIGHT COMPARISON 1363</page><page sequence="7">A significant architectural difference between the Shuttle EMU and Orlan DMA is ngt visible - operating pres- sure (1). The Shuttle EMU operates at 296 hPa (4.3 psia). This pressure was selected as a minimum technical risk and cost approach from the Apollo suit pressure of 262 hPa (3.8 psia). These pressures are driven by the desire for maximum joint flexibility and minimum fatigue, especially for the hands. Meeting NASA standards for avoiding decompression sick- ness, "the bends," requires prebreathing pure oxygen for 4 hours prior to EVA from an Orbiter cabin pressure of 1 01 3 hPa (14.7 psia). As a practical matter for flights with scheduled EVA, the Orbiter cabin pressure is reduced to 703 hPa (10.2 psi) 12 to 24 hours before EVA, reducing the in-suit oxygen prebreathe time to 40 minutes. Since suit checkout and egress takes almost 40 minutes, there is effectively no op- erational penalty for prebreathe (7). Tbe Orlan DMA operates at 400 hPa (5.8 psia)(1). Meet- ing Russian standards for bends avoidance requires pre- breathing pure oxygen for a minimum of 30 minutes prior to EVA from a Mir cabin pressure of 1013 hPa (14.7 psia). The Russian and American manned space programs operate with different standards for bends avoidance, as summa- rized in Table 2 (8). Further exploration of this issue is beyond the scope of this paper but should be better understood and standardized, if possible. Life Support System Both the Orlan DMA and Shuttle EMU Life Support Sys- tems address the same physiological issues of sustaining the EV crewmember's life during autonomous operations. These are: thermal control, pressure control and atmosphere revitalization. Both life support systems also provide dis- plays and controls, communications capability and appro- priate back-up capability for safety. Figure 4 shows the Orlan DMA Life Support System schematic. Salient features are (1): • The primary oxygen supply system provides selectable pressure capability, 392 hPa (5.8 psi) and 26.5 hPa (3.8 psi). The higher pressure is the normal pressure. The lower pressure can be selected to "soften" the suit for increased joint flexibility. The system stores 1 .0 kg (2.2 lb) of oxygen at 41 .2 MPa (5975 psi) in a single tank. • The vent loop has two centrifugal fans plumbed in se- ries. This provides installed redundancy and allows simultaneous operation to reduce helmet fogging and to increase gas cooling if the liquid cooling system malfunctions (1). Nominal vent flow is 150 l/min (5.9 ft3/min). • Vent flow ducts are built into the inside of the suit pres- sure retention bladder. • Vent loop moisture separation uses a static, wick type separator. All condensate is delivered to the sublimator for discharge to vacuum. • In addition to the two vent loop fans, back-up provi- sions include a secondary (standby) oxygen tank and regulator set to flow 1 kg/hr (2.2 Ib/hr) of oxygen if suit pressure falls below 220 hPa (3.2 psia). This system stores 1 .0 kg (2.2 lb) at 41 .2 MPa (5975 psi). An addi- tional 2 kg/hr (4.4 Ib/hr) oxygen flow can be activated manually. The other backup is an ejector to circulate vent flow if the fans or power supply fail . The ejector can be driven from the primary or secondary oxygen sys- tems at the cosmonaut's discretion. The secondary oxygen system will power the ejector for 60 minutes. • The water pump circulates 1 .5-3.0 l/min (1 98-396 Ib/hr) of water through the liquid cooling garment. Tempera- ture control is manual. • A silver-zinc battery provides power during autono- mous operation. It delivers 19 amp-hr, 42 W at 27 v. • The communications system provides semi duplex communication between two EVA cosmonauts and the Mir. The system consists of a headset (two micro- phones, two ear phones and amplifier), transceivers, antenna feeder and antenna. The transceivers contain primary and backup units, and can be activated by voice or by a push-to-talk switch. The antenna is built into the suit fabric. Figure 5 shows a schematic of the on-board system that supports the cosmonauts in their spacesuits during Mir airlock operations. The vehicle system conditions the suit ventilation loop by removing C02 and harmful contaminants and provides cooling air and make-up breathing oxygen. Vehicle oxygen is supplied to the ventilation loop through the normal and emergency oxygen umbilical in addition to its direct introduction into the vehicle side of the vent loop. The system also provides heat rejection and suit thermal control through cooling water whose temperature is controlled from the spacesuit. Pre EVA functions of checkout, leak detec- tion, denitrogenation and pressure regulation are also per- formed by the on-board system. 1364</page><page sequence="8">Table 2.

The feedwater tank is refilled or replaced manually. Orlan DMA can also be oper- ated during EVA on a 25m (82 ft) umbilical that provides electric power and hardwire communications. Figure 6 shows the Shuttle EMU life support schematic. Salient features that differentiate it from that of the Orlan DMA are (1)(5): • The primary oxygen supply provides a single suit pres- sure at 296 hPa (4.3 psi). The system stores 0.6 kg (1 .3 lb) of oxygen at 6.2 MPa (900 psi) in two tanks. This system also pressurizes the feedwater tanks to 1050 hPa (15.2 psi) to expel the water. • The vent loop is powered by a single centrifugal fan driven by a motor that also drives the water pump and centrifugal moisture separator. Nominal vent flow is 1 70 l/min (6.0 ft3/min.). • Vent return flow ducts are built into the liquid cooling garment. • A "slurper," consisting of a perforated plate and plenum, located downstream of the condensing heat exchanger removes free moisture from the vent loop. A gas trap removes gas bubbles from the liquid cooling circuit. The centrifugal separator handles both the gas trap and slurper flows, sending the gas to the vent loop and the water to the sublimator feedwater line and liquid cooling loop. • Backup provisions consist of a secondary oxygen sup- ply and regulator set to flow 2.3 kg/hr (5.0 Ib/hr) of oxygen for a maximum of 30 minutes if suit pressure falls below 262 hPa(3.8 psi). This system stores 1 .2 kg (2.6 lb) of oxygen at 41 .3 MPa (5990 psi). This system operates automatically during EVA and will flow oxygen for a minimum of 30 minutes. This system is replace- able on-orbit, but rechargeable only on Earth. • The water pump circulates 1 .4-1 .8 l/min (180/240- lb/ min) of water through the liquid cooling and ventilation garment. Temperature control is manual. • A silver-zinc battery provides power during autono- mous operations. It delivers 26.6 amp-hr, 63 W at 16.8 v. • The communication system provides full duplex com- munication between two EVA astronauts and the Orbit- er. The system consists of a headset (two micro- phones, two earphones and amplifier), transceiver and antenna. The transceiver also contains a simplex back- up mode. EMU performance data is time shared with biomedical EKG data, with updates every 2 minutes. The antenna is mounted on top of the life support sys- tem. Figure 7 shows the corresponding EMU support system in the Orbiter airlock (7). This system is different from the airlock system in the Mir. The Orbiter system does not condi- tion the vent loop atmosphere. However, the Orbiter airlock does have automatic, in-suit EMU primary oxygen and bat- tery recharge capability and feedwater recharge/vent loop condensate drain provisions. The Orbiter airlock system also provides liquid transport loop cooling, vent loop oxygen makeup (via EMU primary oxygen supply top-off), hardwire communication and electric power for EMU operation within the airlock. 1365</page><page sequence="9">FIGURE 4.

Both suits have elements in common: liquid cooling garments, pressure retention suits with articulated joints, thermal and mechanical hazards pro- tection, transparent helmets with manually adjustable sun visors and dexterous gloves. Figure 8 (5) shows the Orlan DMA spacesuit. Salient external features are: • The suit uses four rotary mobility bearings. There are located at each shoulder (scye) and at each wrist. • Fabric joints provide additional mobility for the shoul- der, elbow, hand, waist, hip, knee and ankle. Helmet and visor are permanently attached to the rigid upper torso. Internal features include (1). • Underwear and hygienic slips. • Liquid cooling garment • The flexible multi-layer components consist of a soft, body-comfort liner, primary and secondary airtight pressure bladders and a surrounding restraint layer. The secondary (inner) bladder is normally unpressur- ized, but inflates automatically if the outer bladder is punctured. • Gloves are custom made for each cosmonaut. If a glove is punctured during EVA, a sealing cuff on the forearm inflates to retain suit pressure. In this circum- stance the cosmonaut has 1 5 minutes of pressurization time to reenter the Mir. • Shoulder mobility bearings and the rear entry closure have redundant pressure retention seals. • The arm includes a flat pattern shoulder and a long, toroidal elbow joint. A cable running down the outside of the arm from the shoulder to the wrist and back to the shoulder on the inside of the arm provides axial restraint (5). The ability to wind or unwind this cable on-orbit provides arm length adjustment. • The lower torso uses flat pattern waist, hip, knee and ankle joints (5). This design simplifies construction, but restricts hip adduction and abduction. The Russian position is that lower torso mobility is not particularly important for EVA and the current design does not ham- per work effectiveness (9). • Suit limbs are replaceable on-orbit. • Orlan DMA uses a removable, protective shell for ther- mal and mechanical hazards protection. It consists of five layers of aluminized nylon interleaved with mesh layers and covered with an outer layer of phenilon, a woven nomex fabric. This layer provides a solar ab- sorptivity of 0.38 and an emissivity of 0.9. Total heat loss is less than 120 k cal/hr (475 Btu/hr) and total heat gain is less than 80 k cal/hr (317 Btu/hr). Figure 9 (5) shows the Shuttle EMU spacesuit. Salient features are: • The suit uses seven rotary mobility bearings. These are located at each shoulder, arm and wrist and at the waist. • The helmet and visor assembly are detachable from the hard upper torso. Internal features include (6): • A replaceable food stick providing 240 kcal of nutrition. • Unisex urine or a male-only urine collection device (crew option). • Thermal control undergarment (crew option). • A replaceable drink bag providing 0.6 1 (21 oz) of drink- ing water. • Liquid cooling and ventilation garment. • The soft limbs and lower torso consist of a single pres- sure retention bladder surrounded by a restraint layer. Limb length sizing is performed on the ground by add- ing or removing annular laced-in-place sizing ele- ments from the restraint layer. This provision is being upgraded to provide on-orbit resizing by adding or re- moving hard annular sizing disconnects in the limbs and by vernier length adjustment of the axial restraint lines. This upgrade also permits partial on-orbit limb replacement. • Standard glove sizes are normally used, but some as- tronauts require custom-size gloves. • Fabric joints provide additional mobility for the shoul- der, elbow, waist, hip, knee and ankle. • All mobility bearings have redundant pressure retention seals. 1370</page><page sequence="14">FIGURE 8. ORLAN DMA SUIT ARCHITECTURE • Shuttle EMU uses an integral thermal and micrometeor- ite garment (TMG) covering all exposed surfaces ex- cept for the visor. TMG elements consist of seven lay- ers: a neoprene-coated nylon ripstop inner liner, five layers of aluminized mylar backed with dacron scrim and an outer layer of orthofabric, a woven blend of kevlar and nomex coated with teflon. This layer pro- vides a solar absorptivity of 0.18 and an emissivity of 0.84. Total heat loss is less than 1 1 2 kcal/hr (444 Btu/hr) in a typical cold environment and total heat gain is less than 76 kcal/hr(300 Btu/hr). SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS This paper presents a top level comparison of the Rus- sian MIR Orlan DMA and the American Shuttle EMU. Table I summarizes the major operating and service parameters of the two systems. Since both systems support comparable extravehicular tasks and address comparable physiological issues, the differences between the Orlan DMA and Shuttle EMU are best understood within the context of the differ- ences in their host vehicles as driven by their respective manned space programs. FIGURE 9. SHUTTLE EMU SUIT ARCHITECTURE In essence, Orlan DMA is an expendable, space- based system, resupplied from Earth with consumables that have minimal interaction with the Orbital Space Station MIR. In contrast, Shuttle EMU is a reusable, ground-based sys- tem that draws most of Its consumables from its two host spacecraft, Shuttle and, in the near future, Space Station. 13 71</page><page sequence="15">REFERENCES 1.
