New York: Oxford UP, 2012. xv + 450pp. In 2008, the University of British Columbia sponsored a workshop called "Integrating Science and the Humanities." Creating Consilience is the direct result ofthat workshop. This collection of essays, edited by Edward Slingerland, Canada Research Chair in Chinese Thought and Embodied Cognition, and Mark Collard, Canada Research Chair in Human Evolutionary Studies, brings together research from scholars</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 407 from a range of disciplines, including philosophy, anthropology, bio ethics, English, and evolutionary studies. It also includes essays with varying viewpoints on the project of consilience itself—an extension of interdisciplinarity across the sciences/humanities divide—addressing the project's potential, feasibility, limitations, and desirability. The workshop and this edited collection arose out of a simple but ambi tious goal: the "attempt to develop a new, shared framework for the sciences and humanities" (4). Part of the collection's purpose was to establish a "second wave" of consilience, one that, like the second wave of feminism, both grew out of and included the earlier wave but also pushed forward in new directions (23). The first wave of consilience was put forward in the work of John Tooby and Leda Cosmides and E. 0. Wilson, and has faced two major challenges: the first, substantive, the second, stylis tic. Substantively, the workshop tried to address how "issues such as the relationship between evolved human cognitive architecture and culture, or the status of science in the chain of explanation, needed to be treated in a more sophisticated fashion" (23). Stylistically, the humanists in the workshop, who are represented in the collection's essays, tried to shift "the rhetoric of proponents of consilience (most of them coming from the science side of the science/humanities divide) [that] often tended to sound dismissive of the value of tradi tional humanistic work" (23). These two shifts provide the theoretical and rhetorical basis that unifies the collection, with essays respect ing "emergent levels of truth" (24), "recognizing the importance of gene-culture co-evolution" (28), and arguing that "consilience is a two-way street" (30). In their introduction to the volume, Slingerland and Collard go so far as to say that while "consilience can provide a crucially important new explanatory framework within which literary studies could operate, it does not necessarily entail radical alterations in the everyday methodology, vocabulary, or focus of interest of the average humanist. Literary scholars, for instance, do not need to stop talking about history and genre, or confine themselves only to terms and concepts drawn from evolutionary psychology" (26). On the whole, the collection succeeds in addressing these concerns, with the exception, perhaps, that any casual humanist interested in consilience will definitely feel that joining the project does require radical alterations of their methodology and vocabulary, and in this regard, they would be correct. The collection is arranged in two parts with six subsections. Part 1 deals with Theoretical Issues, and section 1 presents essays on "Ontologies for the Human," featuring pro-consilience arguments from Steven Pinker, Edward Slingerland, and Brian Fiala, Adam Arico,</page><page sequence="3">408 MODERN FICTION STUDIES and Shaun Nichols, and a counterargument from Richard Shweder. The Pinker article serves as an excellent and concise introduction to some of the foundational theoretical issues that both propel the consilience movement as well as impede its progression. Section 2 of part 1 is devoted to "Consilience Through the Lens of Anthropol ogy," and uses that discipline as a proving ground for the theoretical issues raised in section 1. In this section, Pascal Boyer and Harvey Whitehouse provide the pro-consilience essays, while Bradd Shore's "Unconsilience: Rethinking the Two-Cultures Conundrum in Anthro pology" provides the collection with some of the most relevant criti cism and cautions of the consilience movement, highlighting human variation and cultural evolution as two factors that make explaining high-level phenomena, like the production of art, incredibly difficult to study via reductive methodologies. Part 2 presents case studies that reflect consilience in practice in particular fields of study: culture, religion, morality, and literature and oral traditions. While part 1 is interesting from a rhetorical stand point, part 2 is where the collection truly shines, demonstrating a wide range of consilient approaches to relevant contemporary topics with novel and profound insights. For example, Alex Bentley and Paul Ormerod's "Agents, Intelligence, and Social Atoms" demonstrates the mathematical benefits of modeling human society-level behavior to describe culture-level behavior, like the spread of popular ideas and trends, with zero-intelligence agents. In other words, when trying to predict group behavior at the social level, despite the fact that societies are incredibly complex structures composed of individuals who are themselves incredibly complex, it is more mathematically sound to treat those individuals as if they were mere particles obey ing structured laws because "many of the emergent, often complex, patterns in society need not require complex behavior on the part of individuals" (205). The section on "Literature and Oral Traditions" features several excellent articles with different methodological approaches. The article by Michelle Scalise Sugiyama and Lawrence Sugiyama, '"Once the Child is Lost He Dies': Monster Stories vis-à-vis the Problem of Errant Children," uses an evolutionary perspective to examine "the cross cultural theme of monsters" in light of the fact that "anthropomorphic agents that prey on humans obviously were not a recurrent feature of past environments" (353), and thus should not have any evolutionary value. Sugiyama and Sugiyama's argument is that children in hunter gatherer cultures faced (and still face) two major challenges to their survival once they begin to walk, but before they are old enough to defend themselves: accidental death and death in warfare. Monster stories thus serve the purpose of frightening these children to keep</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 409 them from wandering away from their mothers and dying by getting lost, injured, or falling victim to predators, human or animal. Their article powerfully demonstrates the strength of the consilience project to generate universal-level explanations that can provide illumination for a wide range of stories and narrative components. This is only one application of consilient approaches to literature, and the rest of the "Literature and Oral Traditions" section offers alternatives. Where Sugiyama and Sugiyama use stories to develop a general, cultural-level, evolutionary hypothesis, Raymond Corbey and Angus Mol operate at the opposite end of the spectrum, using evolutionary insights to develop a close reading of a particular text, in this case, Beowulf. In "Politics in British Novels of the Nineteenth Century," Joseph Carroll et al used a questionnaire to evaluate male and female protagonists and antagonists in nineteenth century novels for twelve basic evolutionary motives. The study provides a statisti cal analysis of the characteristics and an analysis of the factors that go into mate selection. The section ends with Barbara Dancygier's "Language, Cognition, and Literature," an astute warning about the perils of applying evolutionary logic to literary studies without a full understanding of the evolution of and cognitive processes in language. The collection concludes with an invited essay from Geoffrey Gait Harpham, "Two Points About Two Cultures," in which he both admits that literary study "is today the most promising site within the humanities of consilient rapprochement" (426-27) and cautions that "the primary reason to resist the final or total integration of science and the humanities . . . [is] that it would destroy both the humanities and the sciences" (430). While Harpham's essay is hope ful that scientific approaches to traditional humanistic disciplines will produce new and meaningful insights, it is also reserved about the disappearance of a humanistic mode of understanding, a mode that he feels is necessary not only to humanistic disciplines, but beneficial to scientific study as well. What this collection of essays excels at is providing an incredibly substantial introduction to the scope of that change on the level of the theoretical, methodological, and interpre tative. Harpham's final line is perhaps the most apt for summarizing the mixed emotions that surround this academic revolution: "The future lies not with the success of consilience alone, but also with its failure" (431).
