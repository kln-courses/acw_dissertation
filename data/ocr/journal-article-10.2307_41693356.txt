Chauhan iám nah sváruriSm mitáyo bhavantu F. 7. 35. 7 vedasyaitihäsyan tamo yubhã-nirvaca-vartrnanã nivãrayam tu pradeyãd Brahma Pratna - Vtmarjanah // 1. 1 Niska, Yak-asva ( Kash- ) go, the river ParusnI (the Prasun in Kafiri- stan), Tirich Mir (trsu- mitra), the SaravsatI, Drsadvati, YavyãvatI etc. are, in the light of archaeology, toponymy etc. the determinants of the auto-chthony of the ^gvedic Aryans. All these have been discussed elsewhere (Chauhanf pp. 1. ff., 101 ff., 117 ff., etc. ). 1.2 Niska, lapis lazuli was owned by the ^gvedians (in term used by T. Burrow : Proto- Indo-Aryans ) only in tha ancient world by about the beginning of the fourth millennium B. C. ( Tosi, 1974, p. 4 ff. ). Niska, the valuable gemstone occurs in the Rgveda and has already been discussed, with its dialectal forms, elsewhere (Chauhan, 1985, pp. 184, 185, 187 and 189). 1. 3 The term läj, lãz, läzh is the tadbhava of the Rgvedic niska, the former being available in almost all the Iranian languages, especially in the Galchab and the Shughni group of dialects current at the present date on the slopes of the Hindukush and the Pamirs, the form Lãg, Lãs having developed in the Post- Pahalavi period circa 800 A, D., its first occurrence being noted in 326 A. D. - 938 A. D. in the vicinity of Marv in Rus ( Nafïsl, pp. 316. 323, 324 and 338). 2. 1 In the modern research parlance, Rgvedic niska or medieval läj, lãz is called lapis lazuli, generally lazuli and sometimes only lapls. 2. 2 Lapis, according to the Shorter Oxford E. Dictionary (Little, 1964) 41, is a Latin word for ( stone ' It was used in Armenus, Armenias stone, a blue carbonate of copper, caustic potash, lapis ollaris, potstone or soapstone. In med. Latine • Philosophers ' stone. Lapis lazuli was used in 1666. The Randum H. Dictionary ( Urdang, 1969) records a stone used in names of minerals, gems etc. A precious stone or a gem, available in rock-formation ; is never a seperate or unmixed unit. It is always mixed with an attached stone. Hence lapis can be said to be a stone invariably mixed with a distinct or indistinct precious stone t</page><page sequence="2">628 ABORI i R. G. Bhandarkar 160th Birth-Anniversary Volume gem. Invariable association of a precious stone or mineral mixed in a stone has created a presumption, in the historical course of time, in the term lapls. Lapis is expressive of this métonymie fact. 2*3.1 Lapis has its counterpart prastara h . /. in Ilgveda 10. 14. 4 which describes yama 1 the controller, a rein, curb, bridle ' The controller in the hymn is the death, the person causing death of a person. In the verse, yama is being implored to sit in the company of lapis, suggestive of lazuli. It is : ± / imâm yama prastarâm a hî sida áñgirobhil ), pitrbhih samvidãnáh O Yama, take your seat by this very lapis, along with Añgiras, our ancestors, knowing them well It may safely be inferred that the lapis is the valuable obiect given to the dead, placed in the grave. Prastara here is the only occurrence in the R g veda* It may be suggested that lapis and Vedic Prastara are cognates. The former is derived from or is a parallel development to the latter, with loss of the dental in a metathetic process. Vedic root str- gives stara « a stratum, a stone, ' and pra-stara ' significantly flown, spread, extended ' The prefix pra is meaningful. Both forms are a development in sister communities of the Indo- European stock. 2. 3. 2. The Atharvaveda repeats this lone note by the Rgveda in its mantra 18. 1. 60. It, in A V 18. 1. 61 gives the history of Aógirasas. itâ età udaruhan divãs prsthany a-rúhan / prá bhürjáyo yáthã patha dyam áňgiraso yayúh // " lhe Aógirasas, moving higher, by a path with birch trees on both sides, to the snow mountains, climbed to their plateaus ". In addition to the borrowing from the Rgveda , the Atharvaveda has used prastra repeating it twice in same Mantra, i. e. AV 16. 2. 6« : rsïnâm prastaró 'si námo 'stu daívãya prastaraya // Mountain dweller's observation to the Lapis ( prastara ) : 11 You are the Lapis of the rsis". This records the stake of the Proto. Indo- Aryans, [the £g- vedians, in the lazuli and its trade. 3. 1 In the history of Niska, Lazuli extraction, the mention of swaru , in the Bgveda six times and svaravah9 pl., also four times is an essential part of extraction operations. The former occurs at RV 1. 92. 5, 162. 9, 4. 6. 3, 5. 44. 5, 7. 35. 7, and 8. 45. 2, while svaravah occurs at J? F 3. 8. 6, 9, 10; and 4. 51. 2, swam occurs in the AV also at 4. 24. 4, 12. 1. 3, 18. 3. 12f 19» 10. 7 ^nd 42. 1.</page><page sequence="3">ChàuHan : Rgvedic Ni§ka - Extraction 629 3. 2. 1. The etymology of the stem svaru is worth perceiving. MW calls it of doubtful derivation. The famous Petersburg Dictionary is vague on this score. The development of the IE root Skw-r in the Vedic is of its non-verb form, svar , svaru , losing its guttural. The only survival of K is iakvari " Cow " only twice in its métonymie sense. Šakala , not recorded in the Rgveda » occurs in AitBr , a brãhmana of the Rgveda , a senior one, with the affix ujpa-% upa-éakala ( Agashe, p. 151 ). Šálka is another form of šakala , a metathetic form (76id., p. 198), occurs in hirawa"Salka. ' (For tadbhavas of sakalat Chauhan, 1985, pp. 50, 227.) In RV 1. 162. 9 svaru means a large piece of flesh of a dead yak. So svaru really means only a sizably large piece. Svar has a specific sense of flow, the object which flows. Svar-ga would mean a place of flow. The IE root Skw-r is prolific in its branches, both Indian and European. It deserves a monographic treatment. Buck has collected material mainly or rather solely from the European Languages. Morgenstierne has collected very valuable Iranian, presently available, dialectal material in his many volumes» Indian material has been collected by Turner in his CDIAL's. Buck's 1442 word- headings distributed in 22 chapters have many cross references but not mentioned. In the context of svaru% Buck's §§ 9. 46 « bore ' and 12. 85 c hole 1 are pertinent. Morgenstierne ( 1938, 1 hole '; 1974, Kurj ) gives clue in the land of the Hindu- kush and the Pamir's. Buck § 9. 46 records Rum. gauri) Pol. Swidrowac i Russian sverlit and § 12. 85, Sp. agujero , hoya ; Rum. gaura% ÜE eyral , Hol ; Lith, skyle% Lett, caurums . They together scent out an IE root Sk^r. Morgen- stierne ( 1938) notes the Galcha words for hole : Wn kožak9 W rus, serv , PS 8ûrai' O /cd; P thor ; Y surv' S câk kouyj' O ' yär (of the ear); S isrox , Sdtribok. If due regard has had to the linguistic behaviour of the different dialectal groups revolving round the centre of the semantic identity enunciated by the great Yãska about fifth century B. C., this would point IE root Sk^-r. The S( anglechi ) form, isrox in the prothetic process, has attracted initial Ù After the sibilant the intermediate and the final consonants change places metatheti- cally, the guttural having become affricate. The root-sense of cutting is seen in the artifacts with a bore, hole. The Rgvedic svaru results with the loss of the guttural and exhibits marks of cntting. It is easily seen that W(akhi) serv , Y ( idgha ) surVi P(astho) surai are simple forms. O(rmurt) KO is only a trimming. In Pol(ish) swidrouoan K has changed to d and pushed ahead. R( umanian ) gauri or gaura has lost ths sibilant. It has survived in the n-Mesopotamian ancient site named gawra processing niska lapis lazuli artifacts c. 3500 B. C.

It is Sogdianized in khaplãjli. Khapli also means blood, coagulated crust of a fresh wound. Sk^-r survives in NPers in suf-tan where k has dis- appeared. Hafiz uses it in : ghazal gufti wa durr sufti bi-ä o khwush bi-khwan Häfiz / 3. 2. 2 In correct interpretation of pr astara and svaru in the Rgveda % the AitBr is of help. It records ( Agashe, 151 ) : yajamãno vai yüpah yajamãnah prastarah / and prastará being veryuseful and breakable, they break it into pieces, upaiakala l te etam svarům apaéyan yüpaéakalam / tam anupraharet / The svaru has to be broken into upaiakala to make it serviceable. The svaru could not possibly be lifted by a person. It could not be easily handled. Hence smaller sakala9 pieces liftable by man. i ) Svaru , a large stone piece, was made by a firing technique. It goes to the credit of the rsis who gave minute details of their way of life. jS V 8. 45. 2 describes how a svaru was made. It says : brhánn id idhmá esõm bhurî šastám prthúh sváruh / yésãm indro yuvã sákhã // " Who ignite fire, they spread it in the vicinity. Their friend is youthful Indra. Their ignition is large; it is highly regulated; (their) choppings are heavy." This records the practice the Rgvedians had evolved that stone can be chopped well when heated under fire. This practice continued even in the medieval period. I have personally seen the marks of the heating process oil being used for firing at Penukonda fort which was the new Capital of the Vijyanagar - Hampi king after his defeat in 1565 A. D. at the hands of the combined Muslim Sultanates. I have also seen, as a minister in the former Hyderabad State, in 1953, the unfinished marks of chopping stone pillars, 10 to 15 feet long under this very firing process. Grtsamada Šaunaka the eminent rsi of the Bhrgu Kula, the more ancient of the rsi class, has recorded the device of putting, under heavy fire, large blocks of solid ice with a view to getting water for civic purposes. This occurs in J? F 2. 24. 7 : té bõhúbhyãm dhamitám agntm áémani / h with both hands they blew fire on the ice blocks.

" iii ) The chops, svaru , are by themselves extremely elegant, beautiful. The lazuli chop has extremely impressed the Rgvedian. RV 1. 92. 5 records : svárům ná péèo " beautiful as if a chop, svaru R V ♦. 6. 3 expresses the same : svarur navajäh sumekah na akrah / " The chop, well measured and as if newly made, was fashioned. •' iv) The Rgveda describes how the chops, svaravah , were carried, transported from the site of mine to the transport point. This was done by people only« At least the j Rgveda does not mention donkey or camel as lapis carriers, though they are elsewhere mentioned. Horse, donkey or camel was not used as a pack-animal. J? F 3. 8. 9 observes : hamsa iva érenisó ... šukra vâsanãh sváravo na iťguh / unniyámã?iãh kavibhih purástãd deva devanãm ápi yanti patháh // " Forming queues like the geese, dressed in the white, the mountain-dwellers ( devas ) bring the chops, being carried ahead by the extractor ( kavibhih ). Even they obtain the wherewithals of the dwelling people. " This statement also speaks of the consciousness of the Rgvedians to look after the material requirements. v) The Rgvedians were very much concerned about miti (measure- ment), size of the chops. The Mantra 7. 35. 7 says that sizes are auspicious to them in that they should not cause any accidents. In R V 3. 8. 6 it is prayed that the chops should bring happines to the people.</page><page sequence="6">632 ABORI i iï. G. Bhandarkar 150th Birth- Anniversary Volume 3. 2. 3. The Atharvaveda uses the term sixira 5 times. Of them, A V 19. 10 is a mere repetition of the first 10 mantras of RV 7. 35 which consists of 15 verses. This has already been discussed. There are other four mentions. In the famous Bhümi Sükta A V 12.1 13 : yásyãm miyante sváraváh prthivyam sã no bhúmir vardhayad várdhamãnã it is said that the earth provides us the chops. Let the growing itself help us growing. In A V 18. 2. 12, the fire in the forms of Varuna, Mitra and Ãdityas has been implored to increase the number of svarus made. 4. 1. To what purpose are directed all the effotrs of the Rgvedian ? What is tho objective of all this national enterpr se of the pre-historic Rgvedian people ? The urban or semi-urban societies at Anau, Karatepe in the Tedzen valley in Turkmenia, Tepe Hissar, North Iran valleys, southeast of Alburz mountains, Shahrl Sokhta in Seistan and Mundigak in the Helmand valley provide a clue. In the last two decades excavations by the Itlain and the Peabody museum, Harward University experts have been carried out. Lamberg - Karlvosky and Tosi, the joint excavators, have recorded ( p. 25 ff. ) : " The same types of Geoksjur ware have also been found at Mundigak in the south eastern Afghasthan, in levels of period III. This site lies about 40 km. north east of the confluence of the Arghandab and Hilmand rivers. Its position is therefore close to the most vital point for the discharge of the entire Hilmand aliviai system, as the Arghandab as the major supply of water the river receives before its delta. The presence of pottery from southern Turkmenia at Mundigak HI is also accompained by other meaningful cultural features, such as collective burials and anthropomorphic figures with bird beak faces. Both V. M. Masson and V. I. Sarianidi consider these close connections related to a diffusion of southern Turkmenian types into the Hilmand valley and surrounding areas, mainly coming from the Tedzen* Delta where they can be documented as a result of a long Phylogenetic Process. These connections do not show evidence for any significant break from Dzejtun culture, dated to the end of the 6th Millenium B. C.

The earliest settlement at. Shahr-1 Sokhta and the remarkable change documented by the Quetta and Mundi- gak sequences might also relate in some way to the abandonment of the major southern Turkamenian Cluster of sites. " "The most interesting discovery" continue the same authors (p. 27), V from this period is one which gives a completely new significance to the cities that arose in the 4th and 3rd millennia on the Hilmand. " Large quantities of lapis lazuli, carnelian, alabastar, and turquoise were found together with the instruement to work them, testifying to the presence of an active market for these products at Shahr-I-Sokhta. Alabastar is located in the rocky outcrops along the western border of Sistan, but lapis lazuli and carnelian were certainly imported goods from Afghanistan ( the Munjan and lazhar Darra Valleys in Badakhan : author ). As a matter fact, more than 90 % of the lapis lazuli and carnelian found at Shahr-i-Sokhta are waste flakes, which suggests that some sort of preliminary work was carried out here on these valuable materials before they were distributed elsewhere. The largest demand for these products, at the beginning at the third millennium, was certainly in Masopotamia during jemdet Nasr times, and this could well have been the destination for most of the lapis lazuli polished at Shahr-i-Sokhta " There is remarkable uniformity ", say the same authors (p. 26) " of finds between Shahr-I-Sokhta and Mundigak. This is so despite the fact that the extraordinary urban development of Sïstan would nob have been possible without the presence of friendly and culturally similar peoples upstreams, where the river curves and the resultant rich overflow could have easily diverted and tempo- rarily blocked. In a way, the ancient identity of the material culture of the two sites confirms the early existence of a problem that was felt more than once in the later history of Sistan. Thousands of potsherds of periods II and III at Shahr-ï-Sokhta bear witness to the cultural identity with Mundigak IV 1-2; the same is true for the lithic industry, metal working, bending techniques, brick typometry, figurines and seals. We do not consider it premature to think of a " Hilmand civilization " developed with those riverine resources at the end of the 4th Millennium on the quite uniform platform of Kechi. Beg and southern Turkmenian models 5. 1 It is very interesting to record the evidence left by the Çgvedians in the places occupied by them, in the course of transport and trade carried on by them. This Toponomastic record presents three zones. Firstly the lapis lazuli mixed stone, possibly in the first stage, was brought possibly to Balkh town and Mazar- sharif from the mines at Munjan and Lazhar Darra.

The other four toponyms are related to lãj which is a tadbhava of niska . Of them two are from a history book and one from a dictionary. It is noteworthy that toponyms are not available between latitudes 32° to 36°. This is due to the fact of peaklike mountain terrain. Zhob valley served as niska route to Harappa and places in this direction. A route went to Mohenjo Darò also. Nãl was a good niska trade centre evi- denced by excavations. There are 12 villages bearing niska- based names. There are 3-4 such villages around Mundigak. Communication from Shahr-ï-Sokhta centre to the coastal area is the greatest commerce flowed to coastal area through 32 villages mostly in the longitudes 60° to 63° around Gwãtar 25° 10, 61° 40. A village named Dinar 26° 24', 66° 8' lies on the Mohenjo Darò route. The other Dinarmulk 26° 24' south of Shahr-ï-Sokhta lies on route to ports. These two villages were possibly purchasing centres in exchange for gold dinar coins. Dinar as a coin was originally of silver issused by Roman Emperor in 550 B. C. Shortly afterwards it was issused as a gold coin by the Bactrian Greeks. It was very popular as a currency. These terms may be of the first century B.C. The village names Lajda, Lãj, Lãzh, etc. are derived originally from the niska-base. This change occurred in the time of Arab rule by about 750 A. D. and later. Lãsjard and Laggard are dated before 935 A. D. They are found near Marv in Khurasan. In an appendix are given some important towns and the villages bearing the names of niska or its derivatives, given alphabetically with their latitudes and longitudes. 6. 1. Recently Thomas Burrow has, in a paper, observed : " Before Zoroaster (c. 1100 B. C. ) a considerable period must have elapsed since the occupation of eastern Iran by the Iranians, during which the Proto-Indo-Aryan religion was still respected by the new rulers. We may conclude that the Iranian conquest of eastern Iran was an event that took place not later than the fourteenth century B.C., and it thus coincided with the period when the Proto- Indo- Aryan had their furthest extension westwards. At this time large numbers of Indo- Aryans migrated into India, and as a result of these two migrations the position of the Proto-Indo-Aryans in their original base in eastern Iran must have been considerably weakened, thus providing the Iranian with an opportunity to move in and take over •• ( Burrow p. 139 ). In this context it has to be remembered that the Proto-Indo-Aryans did not include the Iranians, they having already separated from them. And further they had not still migrated to India, as explained by Burrow.</page><page sequence="9">Chauhan : Rgvedic Niaka -[Extraction 655 7. 1.
