<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ghambageu Encounters Jesus in Sonjo Mythology: Syncretism as African Rational Action Mika Vahakangas Christian missions have worked among the Sonjo of North Tanzania for six decades. In spite of this, there are very few converts to Christianity. However, teachings of Christianity have been largely absorbed into Sonjo traditional religion. The apotheosized Sonjo cul- tural hero Ghambageu has gained an ever- increasing importance in Sonjo religion to the extent that it seems to be on a way towards a peculiar monotheism. The personality of Ghambegeu has transformed increasingly into the image of Jesus. Eventually, these two religious figures are on the way to being fused together. In this process, Sonjo traditional leaders have played an active role. Their action can be con- sidered rational from the point of view of preserving the Sonjo social and cultural stability. At the same time, in spite of the meager visible success of Christian mission, Christianity has had a profound effect on the Sonjo through their traditional religion. WESTERN RESEARCH ON Christian mission towards African tra- ditional religions (ATRs) has tended to consider Christianity as the active agent that works centrifugally. In the past, ATRs have often been viewed as passive, weak, and submissive, proof of which were the many Mika Vahakangas, Lecturer of Missiology, Adjunct Professor of Dogmatics, Department of Systematic Theology, University of Helsinki, PO Box 33, Helsinki 00014, Finland.

This approach was the outcome of several factors: first, mission historical research, focused on the organizational side of mission, relies heavily on written documentation, which was produced predominantly by Western missionaries, especially in the early stages (Vahakangas 2003: 483-486). Second, Western cultural prejudices assume that Africans are passive, whereas the Westerners are active.1 Third, the active role in religious encounter is often measured by using the missionary religions as the yardstick - making almost all other religions but Christianity and Islam look passive. Fourth, the West has been enchanted by statistics which presuppose organizations and official belonging, neither of which apply to ATRs (e.g., Barrett, Kurian and Johnson 2001). This article analyzes the encounter between Christianity and ATR among the Sonjo of Tanzania. The churches working among the Sonjo consider their success meager because of low figures of conversion and especially participation in church activities (Robert Mallya 07.11.2003; Pius Msuya 05.11.2004). Superficially viewed, Sonjo traditional religion may look passive and hardly adapting to the changes that have been taking place both in religion and in the society at large. But both of the first impressions are deceptive. A closer look into the dynamics of Sonjo religion shows that Sonjo mythology has changed thoroughly.2 In this article, myths are considered as a human way of making sense of the world and organizing it. Here, myths will be understood as 1 According to Sundkler and Steed (2000: 1), African mission history was solely written from this perspective until 1970s. See also Lindenfeld 2005: 328. Even today, a great deal of mission history concentrates on Western missionary organizations and missionaries, thus producing a faulty perspective (see, for example, Vahakangas 2006a: 442-445). This article makes use of previous research recorded by colonial administrators, foreign academic researchers, Tanzanian missionary pastors, and a Sonjo pastor as well as my field research conducted in 2003. The field research took place when participating in inter- religious dialogue between Lutheran theologians and the traditional leaders of the Samunge village. Additionally, some interviews with Sonjo converts to Christianity were conducted in the village of Digodigo. Visiting the area as a church worker, a lecturer in a church-run university, I could only observe the situation from the point of view of religious encounter from within the process. This does not make the data collected by other researchers completely different from mine because Christianity, Swahili speakers, and other foreigners all tend to be grouped together in Sonjo thought. Of these people who have collected data, only the Lutheran Sonjo pastor, Zakayo Rong'ola, prior to his becoming a pastor, can be counted as a true insider to the Sonjo traditional community. My fieldwork informants thus consist of three groups: Samunge traditional leaders including the village priest, Sonjo converts to Christianity, and non-Sonjo Tanzanian church workers. Samunge dialogue took place generally in a friendly atmosphere, even though there is some tension between Christian churches and the rest of the Sonjo society. Because of this, the Christians were afraid of the consequences for telling an outsider about the Sonjo traditions. For the sake of their security, the Christian interviewees wished to withhold their names and they have been identified here only as P(erson) 1 to 4.</page><page sequence="3">Vdhdkangas: Ghambageu Encounters Jesus in Sonjo Mythology 113 narratives of religious nature which are considered to be truthful accounts of what happened in the remote past to gods or cultural heroes. They have a legitimizing function, giving reasons why (social) realities are the way they are (Bascom 1984: 9; Honko 1984: 49). In spite of the expected unchanging character of the myths, they or their interpretations change (van Baaren 1984: 221-224). The myths them- selves change in case they are oral, while in cases where they have been written down and canonized, one can change only their interpretations. Myths of origin in particular also have a legitimizing function and can serve the stability of the community by providing the leaders a means of legitimizing their position. A great deal of Christian doctrine and many of Christianity's ethical ideals have been incorporated in Sonjo mythology through the person of Ghambageu, an apotheosized Sonjo cultural hero. Christian influence among the Sonjo is thus far deeper and wider than first appeared. At the same time, however, Sonjo tra- ditional religion, indeed, remains vibrant and active, especially in the remarkable dynamism of its syncretism. It is this fact that this paper seeks to analyze. THE SONJO, AGRICULTURALISTS IN A SEMI-ARID AREA The Sonjo or Batemi are a Bantu-speaking people numbering almost 30,000.3 Their economy is based on agriculture depending on irrigation in a semi-arid area in Northern Tanzania. In spite of the fact that their clothing, decorations, much of their weaponry, etc. are practi- cally identical to those of the Maasai, there is a strong antagonism between these people (Potkanski and Adams 1998: 89). Unlike the Sonjo, the Maasai speak Nilotic language and are predominantly pas- toral. The Sonjo word for Maasai means at the same time an "enemy" (Solomon Isaya 12.06.2005). The Sonjo used to live in fortified villages in fear of the Maasai and wild animals. Most of these villages have been abandoned as a result of [7/amaa-socialist forced resettlement programs and the fact that population increase caused the villages to be physically too small (Potkanski and Adams 1998: 88-89; Fosbrooke 1955: 5-7; Gray 1963: 29-35). The colonial presence in the Sonjo area was never very strong nor lasting, but the British indirect rule was exercised from the nearby district headquarters of Loliondo in Maasai area (see Hailey 1950: 288). 3 This is a rough estimate based on previous estimates (Potkanski and Adams 1998: 87; Schafer 1999: 13). The government of Tanzania does not make statistics on ethnic belonging.</page><page sequence="4">114 Journal of the American Academy of Religion It was only after independence that the government became more active in the Sonjo area, especially in the villageization program of the 17/amaa-socialist regime. The relocation of the villages disoriented the communities to an extent (Iversen 1984, 3, 16-18). Each Sonjo village forms an independent entity, and there were no political structures linking Sonjo from different villages. Yet, they had, and still have, a strong sense of belonging together. A central dimension of this togetherness and their identity as "the Sonjo" is in their religious heritage.4 The most notable political organization in each village is the group of traditional leaders (singular mwenamijie, plural wenamijie), who control the use of irrigation water, arable land, and the trees. Because the economy is based on irrigated agriculture, the power over water is the most valuable political power one can have. One of the interviewed leaders pointed out that the one controlling water controls the whole village.5 The wenamijie make decisions collegially,6 and the position is her- editary in the sense that the follower of a dead mwenamijie is chosen from his clan.7 Each village has also a priest, who acts in close cooperation with the wenamijie and does not have a significant political role (see, for example, Schafer 1999: 46, 47). The Sonjo also have an age-grade system resembling that of the Maasai. Especially, the age- group of the warriors tended to play a significant political role in the past (Gray 1963: 149; Schafer 1999: 16, 28-29). Today, as a result of a decreased ethnic tension between the Sonjo and the Maasai, the politi- cal importance of the warriors has tended to decrease. Over the last few decades, the government has become a new political power-base within the Sonjo area, and thus the political power of the wenamijie is not without challenges. 4 See Potkanski and Adams (1998: 89). It has to be noted that the Sonjo, like most other African peoples, do not even have such a word as "religion" in their language, and thus all discussion on religion found in this paper is based on the terminology and classification of cultural domains that are foreign to the Sonjo. 5 Peter Dudui fd. 07.11.2003: "Wenamijie ni wenye maji". Thus also Griffiths (1940: 17). See also Gray (1963: 61) and Potkanski and Adams (1998: 98). This connection between the wenamijie and water goes almost unchallenged because it is religious based (Schafer 1999: 229). b Peter Dudui, Paulo Belelo fd. 07.11.2003; Griffiths (1940: 17).

The wenamijie considered Christian mission dangerous to the unity and continuity of the Sonjo culture and society. The Samunge village leaders suggested to the Lutheran missionaries that all the villagers would agree to be baptized if their Lutheran traditional religion and Christianity could be fused together (Danielson 1959: 50). It seems that their main preoccupation was the unity of the villagers. After some initial vitality, neither of the missions was very success- ful in terms of organizational growth, and Catholic presence is mostly limited to a hospital they run in Digodigo while the Lutheran church is a small and relatively insignificant entity active practically only in Samunge (see Iversen 1984, 7-14). A Lutheran pastor who worked among the Sonjo in the 1980s notes that "they [the wenamijie] despised us so much that they did not consider us as people of much import- ance.... We were not dangerous [to their position of hegemony]" (Solomon Isaya 12.06.2007; trans. MV). The third, and latest, arrival (1996) is the Pentecostal "Church of the 72", which is a small and vigorous community active in Digodigo. The villages of Samunge and Digodigo are located about two miles from each other. Because the encounter of religions takes place predominantly in them, this paper concentrates on these villages. The churches have not been able to keep a consistent record of their baptisms, and no statistics on church attendance are available. This means that both government and church statistics are not very helpful for this study because they are lacking, unreliable, or irrelevant in terms of ethnic composition. My rough estimate based on discussions with the churchmen responsible for the work among the Sonjo is that the number of baptized Sonjo is at most 10% of the total Sonjo population. Regular church attendance among the ethnic Sonjo is just a fraction of a percent of the total population and a quite small percentage of the baptized Sonjo. The number of immigrants from other parts of Tanzania is very low, but these few immigrants are much more likely active participants in the churches than the ethnic Sonjo. The wenamijie continue to lead their communities even if the Tanzanian government institutions are gradually strengthening their hold in the area. However, traditional leadership often makes use of the government structures, like the ruling party (Chama cha Mapinduzi) ten house cell system, which is the smallest government administrative</page><page sequence="6">116 Journal of the American Academy of Religion unit. The leader of the unit can be identified by a green (party color) flag on top of his house. Among others, this flag is found on top of the house of Biobio Nledio, the Samunge traditional priest. The leading position of the wenamijie has been effectively chal- lenged only twice in Samunge. In the first instance, during the villagei- zation program in 1975, the government replaced the wenamijie with a democratically elected water distribution committee. However, because the committee lacked any means of coercion and did not have credi- bility in the eyes of the villagers, the irrigation system fell into chaos, and the wenamijie returned to power. In the late 1980s and the early 1990s, the Samunge wenamijie increased the traditional tributes for water into an effective price, thus practically privatizing water as their property. The villagers were unhappy and asked the government to intervene, which it did. A new water distribution organ was introduced, but it faced the same problems as the previous one. The power returned gradually in the hands of the wenamijie (Potkanski and Adams 1998, 105-111). Unlike the government, the churches do not challenge the wenami- jie directly.8 However, they challenge them indirectly through question- ing the traditional religious beliefs because the power of the leaders is legitimized through religion, especially the myths. The competition between these religions takes place largely in the sphere of the myths. Ghambageu, the Central Personality in Sonjo Myth and Religion Ghambageu, an apotheosized cultural hero, is the most central figure of Sonjo mythology. If one relies on the Sonjo age-grade lists, one can estimate that he lived approximately four hundred years ago.9 There exists no standard account of his life, but there are several ver- sions which depend on the narrator and the time of narration. The oldest recorded full version on Ghambageu's life was recounted by Simeon Ndula before 1955 (Ndula, Simeon, Gabriel N.S. Mavalla and H.A. Fosbrooke, 1955: 38-43). Other recorded versions of the inci- dents in Ghambageu's life have been discussed in footnotes. Ndula worked for the British administration as the head messenger in Loliondo and was probably the first baptized Sonjo. Ndula was most 8 In spite of the fact that together with the traditional priest, the wenamijie are largely responsible for the continuation of the traditional religion, some of their names (Peter, John, Daniel) reveal that they have received a Christian baptism at some point. One of them emphasized that he is a baptized Lutheran, but the Lutheran pastor, Rev. Mallya (fd. 07.11.2003), told us that he has never been seen in the church. Rong'ola (1976: 26-27) counts 22-age sets after Ghambageu, each about 17 years.</page><page sequence="7">Vahakangas: Ghambageu Encounters Jesus in Sonjo Mythology 117 probably the source of anthropologist Gray's information on Ghambageu because Ndula was his research assistant, resulting in a very similar version (Gray 1963: viii). Ghambageu came to the world "automatically", not having a mother or a father.10 He was a poor man in the village of Tinaga, who worked as a babysitter. He refused to participate in the communal labor of fixing the irrigation channels and also played tricks on the Tinaga inhabitants. The Tinagans grew angry with him and decided to kill him. Ghambageu got wind of the plot and healed a blind old lady and sent her to the village of Samunge. Ghambageu escaped to Samunge, followed by Tinagans. He won inhabitants of Samunge to his side and shot burning bird feathers at Tinagans. That created a terrifying effect, and Tinagans ran away while the people of his new village perceived him as a god because of this miracle. Ghambageu settled in Samunge as the hero and the leader, married, and got so many children that he no longer could bear with them. He turned his children into stones, except two of his sons, of whom he later expelled one. Only his favorite son Aka was left. One night Aka decided to flee from his father, and he turned into a bird and flew away. This distressed Ghambageu so much that he decided to leave Samunge to live in the village of Kisangiro. When Ghambageu eventually died, he told that he should not be buried, but be placed on a flat stone to dry in the sun. However, the Kisangiro villagers buried him. Once the Samunge villagers learned about the death of Ghambageu, they rushed to Kisangiro and wanted to open the grave. The grave was found to be empty except Ghambageu's sandals.11 So, they believed that he had risen from the dead. 10 Early Lutheran missionaries have recorded that Ghambageu would have come from the village of Sieni in Maasai area (Nathan, Eliufoo and Salema 1952: 7). Rong'ola (1976: 45), an already deceased Lutheran pastor of Sonjo background, reports that Ghambageu either came from outside of the Sonjo area or was born automatically, like Ndula says. P3 (fd. 07.11.2003) presented a genealogy ending with God as the ancestor of Ghambageu. Rong'ola (1976: 17-18, 45) presents yet two other versions of the origin of Ghambageu, claiming that his parents were ordinary Sonjos, having either Simbarega or Ghambasiori as his father. Samunge mwenamijie Peter Dudui (fd. 07.11.2003) claimed that Ghambageu would have been born in Samunge. Many narrations on Ghambageu indicate indirectly that he would have come from outside the present Sonjo villages. The point of claiming Ghambageu's ancestry in one's own village is a natural way of claiming more appreciation to one's own community. It seems that in the early 1950s, there were at least two versions of the origin, namely that Ghambageu was an immigrant or that he came to the world without parents. 11 There are several versions on this, but what is common to all of these versions is that Ghambageu's body disappeared (see, for example, Schafer 1999: 324-325), and P2 (fd. 08.11.2003) presented one version according to which the actual resurrection would have been seen.</page><page sequence="8">118 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Ghambageu is expected to come back at the end of the times to save all of the Sonjo. The wenamijie claim that their leadership has been established by Ghambageu. For the one who wants to question the wenamijie s reli- gious, political, and economic leadership, two avenues are available: either to try to sever the connection between the wenamijie and Ghambageu or to discredit Ghambageu. The churches have chosen the latter alternative. But the wenamijie have not been passive before their challenge. The Appropriation of Other Myths to Ghambageu The wenamijie s answer to the challenges from the government and the churches seems to have been to elevate the position of Ghambageu in Sonjo mythology. A part of this development is that some of the myths on other personalities have been changed to have Ghambageu as the main character. Among the Sonjo, there is a story of a boy called Ghamieu who lived in the village of Hume, making his living as a watchman of the fields. He made the owners of the fields think that they were destroyed by baboons even if they were not. That caused the villagers to dislike him. He decided to leave the village with some guests who were from Samunge. These guests did not want him to follow them and they tried to chase him away. Then they met two elephants standing on the path, blocking the way because they were stuck to each other of their tusks. At that moment, Ghamieu transformed into an adult man and went to the elephants, waving with a fly- whisk. The elephants broke loose from each other and made way (Schafer 1999, 282-283). Both of these inci- dents (on the baboons and on the elephants) have also been told of Ghambageu (P2 fd. 08.11.2003), thus adding more miracles to his legend, thereby underscoring his importance. There is also an obviously old myth of a birth of the Son of the Sun from a virgin impregnated by a sun ray (Finch 1957: 204). The son is sometimes called Ehoru, who would be Ghambageu's grandfather in some versions of Ghambageu-myths (Schafer 1999: 272-273, see also 312). There are variations in the details of this myth, but the main fea- tures of the story are the same. In the story, a virgin maiden was bathing in a river when a sunbeam struck her. This sunbeam impreg- nated her and she gave birth to a son after a very long time (ten, twelve or eighteen years). Instead of calling the child the Son of the Sun or Ehoru, he is now considered to have been Ghambageu. My informant mwenamijie Peter Dudui and late Lutheran Sonjo pastor Rong'ola add another miracle to the beginning of Ghambageu's life; he was born</page><page sequence="9">Viihakangas: Ghambageu Encounters Jesus in Sonjo Mythology 119 looking like an adult and went to sit on a bench. When the mother was perplexed, he turned into a baby (Rong'ola 1976: 17; Peter Dudui fd. 07.11.2003). This appropriation of the myth to Ghambageu is a rela- tively old one, because it was recorded already by Rong'ola in the 1970s. Mwenamijie Peter Dudui makes use of this version because in such a way he can claim both Ghambageu's divine origin and the idea that he would come from Samunge, Dudui's village. There is also a myth on the origin of the water laws in the village of Samunge. This myth told by a late Samunge mwenamijie Gabriel Nginoria Goroi12 and another Sonjo convert (P2 fd. 08.11.2003) to Christianity points out that the water laws come from the first inhabi- tant of the area, who had a son and two companions. He divided the irrigation water into four parts, retaining more than half of the water for himself and the rest to the three others. As an outcome, there are four clans that each has representation among the eighteen wenamijie until today. Of these wenamijie, six are wenamijie proper with political rights, and the rest are junior wenamijie only with the privilege to obtain water before the others.13 Today, the Samunge wenamijie maintain that it was actually Ghambageu who installed the water laws. An almost rectangular stone on the creek is shown as a proof. It is just below the sacred warm spring that looks like a bridge to mark the point up to where men may proceed. Only young boys and old men, both groups which are sexually inactive, are allowed to enter the closest proximity of the spring once a year when they clean the spring area of leaves and tree branches and other dirt. Even this cleaning is a religious ritual ordered by Ghambageu (Peter Dudui fd. 08.11.2003). Thus, Ghambageu has become the giver of water laws, too. Through continuing to recount the older myth, the Christians challenge the veracity of the wenamijie s version about the water laws. However, the hit is not directly aimed at the wenamijie s position as the custodians of water; the point seems to be, rather, to reduce the importance of Ghambageu. If Ghambageu would become less important, there would be more space for conver- sions to Christianity. It would also possibly facilitate a gradual separ- ation of religion from politics, which would make the terrain easier and more familiar for the churches. This, however, would rob the traditional 12 Potkanski (1987: 217-218). Goroi eventually gave up his position as a mwenamijie because it was in conflict with his position as a Christian. Interestingly enough, in 2003 this story was narrated as an old secret myth that the wenamijie do not approve. Potkanski does not indicate anything on the possible political rejection of this myth in the 1980s.</page><page sequence="10">120 Journal of the American Academy of Religion political leadership of its legitimacy possibly leading to the disintegration of the traditional community. The Increasing Emphasis on Ghambageu's Divinity For the Sonjo, Ghambageu is not only a cultural hero, but also a mugwe. The traditional meaning of mugwe covers divinities and spirits. The word can refer as well to the creator God as any other spiritual being. Calling Ghambageu a "mugwe" can mean many different things. Ndula, the narrator of the first recorded version of Ghambageu's life, recounted the myth on the life of Ghambageu again in the 1980s (in Potkanski 1987). The plot remains essentially the same, containing the elements of miracles as well as deviant behavior, such as the refusal to participate in communal labor to fix the irrigation channels. Already the old version states that the villagers of Samunge "idolized him as the creator of the earth" (Ndula, Simeon, Gabriel N.S. Mavalla and H.A. Fosbrooke, 1955: 40). Ndula remains neutral in that version, only noting that the hero gained his reputation as a god in one village. The situation is different when he narrates all this in the 1980s. Instead of being a vital and menacing intruder, Christianity has run out of steam in the 1980s. This time, the narrator takes sides. In the incident about refusing to do communal work, there is an interesting addition - when insisted to join to do communal labor, Ghambageu asks the villagers if they think that he should work like a man (Potkanski 1987, 218-219). Here, Ndula answers the possible objections of those who oppose Ghambageu: if Ghambageu was an upright person, why did he not participate in communal labor? The implicit answer is that because he was a god. Considering Ghambageu's ministry, the emphasis on his prophetic gifts is stressed both by the traditionalists and the Christians. The Lutherans want especially to prove that Ghambageu actually prophe- sized the coming of their denomination (Danielson 1959: 31; Iversen 1984: 8) and thereby try to gain credibility among the traditionalists. What were previously represented as tricks are now interpreted as miracles. The "Christianization" of Ghambageu Even if Christianity has, at times, been virtually no threat to the reli- gious leadership of the wenamijie, at other times it has challenged the status quo. Today, through the arrival of Pentecostalism, Christianity cannot be ignored again. It seems that religious and governmental chal- lenges to the wenamijie leadership have been taking place in alternating succession: during the time of setback of Christian mission, the</page><page sequence="11">Vahakangas: Ghambageu Encounters Jesus in Sonjo Mythology 121 Ujamaa-socialist government was actively challenging the wenamijie. Today, it is the time of the churches to challenge, whereas the govern- ment is less active. This means that the wenamijie have had to be vigi- lant most of the time. But they are hard pressed. The Christian challenge has been at the same time both moral and intellectual. Sonjo mythology has recently accommodated many Christian ideas. There is ample evidence that Sonjo mythology on Ghambageu has increasingly begun to resemble Christian Gospel accounts on Jesus. The above-mentioned case of calling the son of the Sun born to a virgin Ghambageu is a case in point because it makes the nativity stories of these both figures resemble each other. This developing "Christianization" of Ghambageu is based on the already existing parallels between Jesus and Ghambageu. Among these, we may list at least supernatural birth, working of miracles, and alleged resurrection as well as the hope of their eschatological return (Gray 1966). But the development continues well beyond these initial claims. Ghambageu as the Ethical Example In Ndula's oldest account, Ghambageu is presented more or less as a trickster. One can even maintain that many of his tricks and miracles portray not only good humor, but also egoistic and narcissistic ten- dencies (thus Simenauer 1955). Even according to some other versions on his life, Ghambageu is said to have cheated the Tinaga inhabitants of their honey beer, to have plotted against the Samunge inhabitants to be able to remain living in Kisangiro, and to have played a good number of other tricks to harm or tease others (P3 fd. 07.11.2003; P2 fd. 08.11.2003). Only in very few cases did the miracles performed by Ghambageu help other people, such as restoring sight to an elderly sick woman in Tinaga before his narrow escape from there, or miraculously producing food for the Tinaga children he was supposed to take care of.14 Even in these cases, it would be possible to maintain that he per- formed these miracles for selfish motives, such as preparing ground for his escape to Samunge from Tinaga or earning favors from his employer by taking good care of the children. The less than ethical dimensions of the older version of Ghambageu's life are no longer narrated by the wenamijie, but rather by some Christians who want to decrease the credibility of the Sonjo traditional faith. The wenamijie did not tell us the narration of 14 Ndula, Mavalla and Fosbrooke (1955: 39), Gray (1966: 56), P3 fd. 07.11.2003, and Biobio Nlediofd. 07.11.2003.</page><page sequence="12">122 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Ghambageu turning his children into stones (Ndula, Mavalla and Fosbrooke, 1955: 40), and he is actually told to have led his life in celib- acy (Peter Dudui fd. 07.11.2003). This claim is very surprising in a culture that values offspring very highly. This move may refer to the Christianization of Ghambageu-mythology in two ways. First, in Christian opinion, God does not procreate the way humans do, whereas among the Sonjo it was a natural idea that Gambageu's genealogy begins with God and that Ghambageu married and got children not very different from the children of the others.15 Second, by denying that Ghambageu had offspring, one refers to the idea of Ghambageu's divi- nity understood in the Christianized way, including an element of transcendence. At the edge of the village of Samunge, there is a stone under a thatched roof next to the road leading to the neighboring village of Digodigo. Passers-by put grass on the stone as an offering. According to one myth, this stone is one of the children who were turned into stones,16 but the wenamijie explained that that stone is special because it is a place where Ghambageu placed his foot on a stone that then grew bigger (Peter Dudui fd. 07.11.2003). This development is probably due to the fact that a father who changes his children into stones can hardly serve as an ethical example. In this way, a dubious dimension of the narration on Ghambageu's life is turned into another miracle. The Samunge wenamijie presented Ghambageu as a great religious and moral teacher. They emphasized that Ghambageu's teaching was basically the same as Jesus's, but were not able or willing to go into details on his teachings (Peter Dudui fd. 07.11.2003). Only a list of Ghambageu's moral standpoints was presented. The modern Ghambageu list of dos and don'ts looks very familiar to a Christian: do not commit adultery (cf. Ex 20: 14; Mt 5: 27-32), do not kill (cf. Ex 20: 13), do not steal (cf. Ex 20: 15), do not forget my teachings (cf. Jn 16: 4; 1 Cor 11: 2; Lk 22: 19), do everything in prayer (cf. 1 Thess 5: 17; Col 4: 2), heal the sick in my name (cf. Mk 9: 38-39; 16: 17; Lk 9: 49; 10: 17; Acts 3: 6), heal the sick by anointing them with saliva (cf. Jn 15 Of course, Christian theology has some dimensions that make Christian concept of God take some anthropomorphic dimensions, namely that in the Trinity there are the Father and the Son and that the Son became a human being. In terms of genealogies, the genealogy of Jesus found in Luke 3 ends to Adam and God, making no clarifications on God's possible special position in the genealogy, except being the first in line. This contains, of course, a resemblance to Ghambageu's genealogy that starts with God. 16 My observation in Samunge 08.11.2003; Finch (1957: 206). Finch (1957: 205-207) also lists other children and their respective stones. See also Schafer (1999: 312-314).</page><page sequence="13">Vahdkangas: Ghambageu Encounters Jesus in Sonjo Mythology 123 9: 6; Mk 8: 23), in case of trouble, pray together and you will receive help (cf. Mt 7: 7-11; Mk 11: 24) (all these Peter Dudui fd. 07.11.2003). Presenting Ghambageu as a moral teacher seems to be a recent development because the oldest recorded traditions on Ghambageu were in a narrative form, whereas this listing of his teachings is not related to any concrete situation.17 It would seem most natural that the oldest tradition on Ghambageu would be in a narrative form and not as a list of moral demands. It is not very likely that non-contextual teach- ings would have a long life in an oral tradition unlike stories where the plot keeps the details together. In spite of the fact that the Jesus-like picture of Ghambageu as a moral teacher looks like a recent develop- ment, there is narrative support for considering Ghambageu as a judge of the people (see, for example, Schafer 1999: 306-308). This, however, does not necessarily tell us very much about his moral character, but rather of the people's respect for him as a leader to whom they brought their disputes to be settled. Furthermore, the contents of the outline of Ghambageu's teaching are completely in line with Christian missionary teaching, which is a fact that the wenamijie eagerly stressed (Peter Dudui fd. 07.11.2003). It seems thus likely that missionary teaching has consciously been incorporated into the Ghambageu corpus of myths. What makes this conclusion slightly uncertain is the fact that this information was collected in an inter-religious dialogue. It was clear that the wenamijie attempted to present their religion to their Christian dialogue partners in as acceptable a light as possible. This, of course, does not automatically mean that they would not genuinely believe in what they said. It must be furthermore noted that the more precise con- tents of these ethical rules are not likely to be identical. For example, all of the three churches in the area regard marriage of a divorcee as adultery, whereas divorce and remarriage are an accepted practice in the Sonjo tradition (see Gray 1968). Ghambageu, the Savior Sonjo eschatological teachings also seem to be in a process of meta- morphosis in order to resemble Christian soteriology more closely. Both of the saviors, Ghambageu and Jesus, have traditionally been expected to return. However, Peter Dudui pointed out that Ghambageu 17 This does not apply to the Lutheran early missionaries' presentation (Nathan, Eliufoo and Salema 1952: 7). This may be because of the fact that the Sonjo were (and still are) very secretive about their traditions, and the missionaries may have heard only some unrelated details. Another possibility is that they might not have felt it necessary to write too lengthy explanations on Ghambageu's life in a booklet that dealt mainly with Lutheran mission to the Sonjo.</page><page sequence="14">124 Journal of the American Academy of Religion will come back in a way not known to the people, resembling the Gospel accounts of Jesus going to an unknown place after his death and returning in a surprising and mysterious way (Peter Dudui, fd. 07.11.2003; Mt 24: 33, 34; Mk 13: 26, 32; Jn 7: 33-36; 13: 33, 36). Gray's (1966, 59) findings point out that the basis of salvation at the end of days is that one has the ntemi scar. Also Schafer (1999: 330) maintains that for the Sonjo, good character is no prerequisite for salva- tion. However, Rong'ola (1976: 75) points out that a person's ethical qualities and devotion to Ghambageu also contribute to salvation. As a Lutheran pastor from a Sonjo background, Rong'ola had to face these questions at a personal level. Having become a pastor in a church that strongly condemned the Sonjo religious traditions, he had removed himself from his roots. He attempted to rectify this situation by empha- sizing the continuity between Sonjo traditional religion and Christianity. He wanted to see Ghambageu as a prophet preparing way to the coming of Christianity (see Rong'ola 1976). The issue of devotion to Ghambageu would have been relatively irrelevant during earlier monolithic traditional social situation. Everyone participated in the traditional religion if they wished to live in the community. There was no need to question personal motivation and devotion because everyone complied with the rules of religious conduct. Emphasis was laid on the actions, the filling of social expec- tations, which was considered as having a good character.18 Only the clan of the smiths was not counted in because they were told to be the offspring of the cursed Tinagans who tried to kill Ghambageu (Schafer 1999: 68-69, 191-192). With the coming of Christianity, this has begun to change. It can no longer be taken for granted that everyone participates in the tra- ditional religion even if almost everyone actually does so, including most of the active church goers. Because the participation in traditional religion is no longer self-evident, the need to control the level of devo- tion has risen. What counts is no longer only that there is compliance to traditional religious practices, but also that that compliance arises from the hearts of the people, or else they might suddenly turn away from Ghambageu. This has made Sonjo traditional religion begin to resemble missionary Christianity even in this dimension. Thus, the element of personal conviction and choice is being introduced in Sonjo 18 Schafer (1999: 65). Schafer's analysis of the Sonjo way of understanding personality revolves around the concept of "good character".</page><page sequence="15">Vahdkangas: Ghambageu Encounters Jesus in Sonjo Mythology 125 religious life. This can be counted as some kind of modernization and individualization. The most radical and possibly the most profound change in terms of mythology, however, was probably initiated by the Christians. American Roman Catholic missionaries had a far more positive approach to Sonjo traditions than Tanzanian Lutheran missionaries who shared their Western Pietistic teachers1 negative attitude to non- Christian religions.19 Catholic Father Gerry Kohler proposed that the root of the Ghambageu myths must be in one way or another in the life of Jesus. This theory intended to present Jesus to the Sonjo in as accep- table a way as possible (see Iversen 1984: 20). His proposal was much more successful than it first looked, albeit in quite a different way from his plans. For this proposal seems to have provided the Sonjo with a fresh idea: to identify Jesus with Ghambageu. This move seemed to solve the problems of the religious encounter between Christianity and Sonjo traditional religion, at least from the Sonjo point of view. If Jesus and Ghambageu are the same person, then the Christians should actually have no reason not to participate in the traditional religion having Ghambageu at its center. This would safe- guard the unity of the community. In that case, everyone could neatly agree with each other, and all Sonjo could openly practice both of the religions because they are essentially the same religion. To create a deeper fusion of the two divine heroes, a historically connecting link was needed. This was established through the common feature of the missing corpse of the hero. Originally, there were differing views on where Ghambageu went after his ascent, the most usual view- point being that one cannot know where he went. Today, the Samunge wenamijie stand by the purported saying of Ghambageu that he would go to Bugeni Bula after his death (Biobio Nledio, Peter Dudui fd. 07.11.2003; P4 fd. 08.11.2003). According to them, until recently no one has actually understood what that meant. Ndula (Potkanski 1987: 221), however, uses Bugeni Bula as the name of the stone in Samunge on which Ghambegeu stood while watching his son Aka flying away as a bird. 19 The Lutheran missionaries to the Sonjo area came mostly from Kilimanjaro and Meru areas where some of the early German missionaries, especially Bruno Gutmann, had attempted a thorough contextualization and formation of Volkskirchen in each ethnic group. The German missionary enterprise was interrupted by the World Wars, and the German missionaries were replaced predominantly by Americans after the Second World War. These changes led to the demise of this early contextualization project.</page><page sequence="16">126 Journal of the American Academy of Religion The growing consensus of the Sonjo leaders in Samunge is now, however, that it must mean Ulaya (Europe in Swahili). The argument continues that if Ghambageu went to Europe, Ghambageu and Jesus must be the same person. When Ghambageu left the Sonjo, he went to work among the Europeans, and he still lives there as Jesus (Peter Dudui fd. 07.11.2003; P2, fd. 08.11.2003; see also Namjogo 1996, 36). Interestingly enough, the Samunge wenamijie seem to be convinced that Jesus still lives among the Europeans.20 This shows at the same time a very limited understanding of Christianity as a historical religion and of the cultural and geographical context of Jesus. It is improbable that historical argumentation on the fact that Jesus lived two millennia ago and that Ghambegeu must have lived only a maximum of a couple of centuries ago would be seen as very challenging by the wenamijie. Gray (1963: 97) maintains that in the 1950s the Sonjo had no trouble with illogical flows of time in their mythology. Schafer (1999: 266) reports that his interviewees were not worried about the logical consistency of the myths they recounted. My impression is similar (even though I did not want to press the wenamijie with questions of illogical features in their myths, due to the delicate nature of the situations of discussion). The question of time could, of course, be issued in such a way that the wenamijie would accept that Jesus's life in Palestine took place before Ghambageu's ministry among the Sonjo. Yet, the question of where he has spent the rest of the time in between the incarnations and after the second one would still need to be addressed. Because such historically oriented questions are not yet raised, this fusion of two heroes is a working solution for the time being. As indicated by this development, the wenamijie try in no way to deny the veracity of Jesus's existence or meaning, but rather choose to domesticate Christianity by fusing it into the Sonjo religion. There still remains the obvious question of whether Ghambageu- Jesus is white or black, or European or African (both classifications are used in everyday speech in Tanzania), which is an important existential question in today's postcolonial Tanzania. One way of solving the problem would be to maintain that he is a mulatto, at least at the moment. In fact, one informant (P4 fd. 08.11.2003) told us that there is an opinion among the Sonjo that Ghambageu had maintained that he would return to the Sonjo as a mulatto.21 20 This is surprising considering that at least some of them must have undergone baptismal classes before having been baptized. Others might have been baptized as children and may not have received any Christian instruction later. 1 The question of Christ's color is a burning one, as can be gathered from the narrations of dreams among the Legio Maria church members in Kenya. See Schwartz 1995.</page><page sequence="17">Vahdkangas: Ghambageu Encounters Jesus in Sonjo Mythology 127 To test how far the absorption of Christian ideas has gone, I asked the Samunge priest, Biobio Nledio, how it is possible that Ghambageu is a god and a man at the same time. It seems probable that this would not have been a problem in the traditional setting because, according to Ndula's old version, the man Ghambageu was declared a god in Samunge and later in Kisangiro without considering it problematic. Additionally, it seems that in the traditional Sonjo polytheistic view, divinity and humanity are not radically different from each other. However, knowing the Christian understanding of discontinuity between God and humans, Rev. Nledio saw the point of my question. Furthermore, he seemed to subscribe to such a view on God that led him to consider my question to point to a real problem. However, he was unable to express his solution verbally. Then I described to him the Chalcedonian Christological formula as simply and accurately as I could, without having the chance to resort to Greek philosophical ter- minology because of operating in a Bantu language.22 I presented the formula as a proposed solution to the problem I had raised and did not tell that it is the standard Christian solution. Rev. Nledio was very happy with that proposal and came even later to me to express how astonished he was that I was able to describe so well the way in which he believes. This dialogue with the priest reveals that he has adapted his under- standing of divinity and its relation to humanity to the Christian teach- ings. Additionally, it hints that the way Ghambageu is God is intended to be the same as the way Christ is God to Christians. Thus, Ghambageu is in the process of turning into God from a divinity among others. He is increasingly turning into the Christ of the Sonjo. Identification of a foreign religion's gods or saints with one's own gods is not a strange phenomenon at all. This has happened in a large scale between African religions and Christianity in Latin America (Candomble, Umbunda, etc.). However, this process of fusion of Jesus and an African pre-Christian eschatological hero seems to be unique in the sense that the connecting characteristics of these figures are many and profound. As a matter of comparison, the Xhosa had a myth of an apocalyptic savior, but this myth was influenced by the encounter with Christianity, and Sifuba-Sibaigi was actually even identified with Jesus (Peires 1989: 123, 128-138). As such, one may conclude that the Xhosa hero was probably a product of the encounter with Christianity, 22 Swahili and other Bantu languages do not operate with the notion of being, and thus the ontological point of the Chalcedonian formula is very difficult to express adequately.</page><page sequence="18">128 Journal of the American Academy of Religion whereas in the case of Ghambageu, this is a matter of identification of the eschatological saviors of two religions that have existed as such figures even before the encounter of religions. SYNCRETISM AND RATIONALITY OF AFRICAN TRADITIONAL RELIGION23 Thus, while the organizational success of Christian churches among the Sonjo has been meager, the level of reception of Christian teachings has not been small. The Sonjo mythology is thoroughly changing. Christian moral teaching in particular has been largely incorporated into Sonjo mythology as Ghambageu's teachings. Additionally, Christological teachings are finding their way into Sonjo traditional reli- gion through the fusion of Jesus and Ghambageu. Could the churches expect much more from their converts in Sonjo context? If not, the main reason for the Sonjo not converting to Christianity appears to be that they remain outside of the churches' realm of power. The mis- sionaries and church leaders cannot direct and veto the processes of contextualization of the Christian message; the initiative is completely in the hands of the Sonjo traditional leaders. The increasing similarities between the two religions can be counted in a way as a Christian missionary success. However, it does not necess- arily imply that the Sonjo leaders would acknowledge the superiority of Christianity. Rather, they seem to follow dual tactics. On one hand, they emphasize that the Sonjo have no religion at all but only tradition, and that Christianity is fully compatible with this tradition. (Peter Dudui fd. 07.11.2003). In this way, Christianity is neither an enemy nor even a competitor to the Sonjo tradition. On the other hand, they were busy incorporating Christian teachings in Sonjo traditions. Considering terminology, the wenamijie were quite correct from their point of view because it was only Christian mission that intro- duced the entity called "religion" that could be distinguished from the rest of the social and cultural reality. Yet, to claim that Christianity and Sonjo tradition are not in a situation of competition appears more like a rhetorical move in dialogue than anything else. 23 The rational choice theory of Rodney Stark (for example 1997) has contributed to the outcome of this analysis. However, the fact that certain religious leaders make rational decisions on how they relate to the teachings of a competing religion is not directly related to that theory. If one were to properly apply rational choice theory in the Sonjo situation, one should rather look into the motives of the Sonjo not joining the churches and investigate whether those reasons are rational.</page><page sequence="19">Vdhdkangas: Ghambageu Encounters Jesus in Sonjo Mythology 129 The incorporation of Christian teachings especially into Ghambageu mythology seems to be a way of answering the Christian challenge both morally and intellectually. The churches present themselves as the champions of high morals, especially in terms of sexual behavior. In the light of Christian emphasis on morals, Ghambageu must have begun to look a bit dubious with his tricks and less-than-moral actions. Transformation of this mythical figure into a moral teacher is a comple- tely rational move in this situation. Absorbing Jesus's qualities and the dimensions of his ministry point to another development in the making. Through identifying Ghambageu and Jesus, the wenamijie have been able to increase Ghambageu's centrality in Sonjo religious tradition. This is so partly because of the overriding importance of Jesus for Christians. Additionally, Christian accounts of Jesus have also served as a reservoir of mythical ideas that can be applied to Ghambageu. The fusion of the personalities serves at the same time as an answer to Christian ethical and intellectual challenge and in addition as a way of elevating Ghambageu. One may wonder whether the wenamijie s strong drive to elevate Ghambageu is an irrational clinging to the past. It appears not to be so. The intrinsic connection between Ghambageu and the wenamijie goes unchallenged by anyone. No one questions the role of wenamijie as the heirs of his moral, spiritual, and political power. The Christians have concentrated on tarnishing Ghambageu's fame through making use of old (versions of) myths, but even they do not question wenamijie as the inheritors of Ghambageu's prestige. Translating the situation into financial language, one may see that the wenamijie are in power because they have the highest amount of social capital in the form of political capital.24 This capital accumulates when the running of the affairs is smooth. The accumulated political capital makes the situation stable, and there will be no likely resistance even to changes in mythology. As oral, this mythology is flexible, at any rate. Through elevating Ghambageu, the wenamijie exchange some of their political capital into "totemic capital"25 which, in this case, serves as a bank account of social capital. Due to the wenamijie s high credi- bility, these changes are not challenged (except by some Christians, and even they do it in secret). When they began to sell water, the wenamijie transgressed the traditional code of conduct allegedly stemming from 24 On symbolic capital, especially as political capital, see Bourdieu (1991: 192-195). I coin this term here to refer to symbolic capital that is vested in a communal symbol that works as a totem in a Durkheimian sense.</page><page sequence="20">130 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Ghambageu and began exchanging their political capital for cash. The resulting decline of their political capital eventually caused their mar- ginalization. The new water distribution committee could not, however, fulfil its function because it lacked political capital. The foreign process of democratic elections could not provide the "water distribution com- mittee" enough credibility. In spite of having been sidetracked, the wenamijie still had one asset: the treasure chest of symbolic capital, Ghambageu. Their religious credibility facilitated their return to power. Today, the wenamijie are busy again, self-consciously increasing the importance of Ghambageu. Even the wenamijie openly admitted that it is a new idea based on their reasoning. (Dudui 07.11.2003). If the newly introduced identification between Ghambageu and Jesus becomes gen- erally accepted, Ghambageu might prove to be hard currency even among the few staunch Sonjo Christians. In that case, the wenamijie would have secured their hegemony. While the identification of Ghambageu and Jesus is a completely conscious process, what remains open is how they see the tactical dimension of that move, and how thoroughly that has been meditated by these traditional leaders. At any rate, one may conclude that this is a case of conscious syncretism that is rational in the sense that it per- forms what the wenamijie want.26 This approach helps them to remain in control of both religious and social realities, and in this way to secure the unity of the community. CONCLUDING REMARKS As seen above, Sonjo mythology is in a very rapid process of change. The two main features seem to be the growing importance of Ghambageu and the increasing identification of Ghambageu with Jesus. The advent of Christianity sixty years ago in Sonjo area confronted the communities with a concrete threat to their unity. The division of the people to Christians who reject their Sonjo background and those who stick to the tradition would have ruined the unity of the people. That not only would have caused the possible demise of their ethnic identity but could also have threatened their physical existence because they were surrounded by enemies, the Maasai. The Samunge village Sonjo leaders attempted to bargain a deal with the early missionaries; against the total acceptance of Sonjo traditions, they would have 26 It has been noted that part of the attraction of Christianity in Africa is based on its eschatological teachings (Jindra 2005: 369-370). Through the fusion of Jesus and Ghambageu, this eschatological appeal is valid in Sonjo religion, too.</page><page sequence="21">Vahakangas: Ghambageu Encounters Jesus in Sonjo Mythology 131 recommended baptism to all of the Sonjo. They offered the missionaries the chance to put a Christian frame upon the Sonjo's traditions. When this did not work out, the unification of the religions has taken place within the framework of the traditional religion. As a result, the Sonjo traditional religion has successfully retained its central position in the Sonjo communities. That this unification took place in the person of Ghambageu is quite fitting because he has become the icon of Sonjo ethnic identity. The strong connection between the Sonjo status quo and Ghambageu is at the same time a strength and a weakness. It remains strong as long as the wenamijie retain their legitimacy in the eyes of the people. If that legitimacy declines, the Sonjo community will undergo major changes that will inevitably affect religion, too. The encounter of religions among the Sonjo serves as an example of the dynamics between Christianity and ATR. It is another proof that the old picture of Christianity as the active and dominant reli- gion and ATRs as passive, or at best, reactive, is quite disputable. Similar interaction between Christianity and ATRs have also been recorded from elsewhere, describing how ATRs have assimilated dimensions of Christianity and the other way round (e.g., Jindra 2005). However, because, in most of the other studied cases, Christianity plays a greater role in the society and claims more adherents, ATRs' accommodation to Christian ideas and ideals can appear as a compulsory retreat. At least with the Sonjo, this is not the case. While religious competition exists, Sonjo traditional religion need not react out of a situation of weakness. Sonjo traditional reli- gion is thus not a wholly passive victim under Christian missionary onslaught, but rather an active participant in the creation of a new religious reality. This conclusion is basically in line with the classic intellectual theory of conversion proposed by Horton (1971). As Horton points out, even in the case of change of religious affiliation, the African worldview persists. He views conversion as a response to the new challenges brought by widening perspectives. In the Sonjo case, the slight difference is that the response has taken place within the traditional religious framework. The Sonjo traditional religious and political leaders have taken an active role in trying to safeguard the unity and wellbeing of their com- munity. Their approach reveals a great degree of tact and active partici- pation in the creation of a symbolic sphere that allows them to carry out the task handed to them by previous generations. The role of Christian missionaries, Tanzanian and foreign, has been at times partly reactive, at other times almost passive. When they have initiated ideas</page><page sequence="22">132 Journal of the American Academy of Religion meant to open the Sonjo community to conversions, this has not been very successful, at least up to now. Contextualization and inculturation, so much discussed in Christian missionary circles, have not been rea- lized. The development of Sonjo traditional thinking, however, looks very much like inverted contextualization, contextualization the other way round. It is naturally labeled as syncretism by the missionaries. But this case raises the question whether syncretism and contextualization are either two names for the same phenomenon27 or just close relatives. In spite of the partly reactive and passive approach of Christian mission, Christian teachings have largely been accommodated among the Sonjo, albeit through the traditional religion. This case shows that discussion on the success and failure of Christian mission depends largely on how one defines the goal of mission. Furthermore, ATR's active role, even if hampering the organizational growth of the churches, cannot be considered as something opposed to Christian mission. Rather, it is exactly through the active role of Sonjo traditional religion that Christian mission has been very influential. The players of different roles in the encounter between religions, especially the Christian missionaries, often consider the encountering religions as opposing entities. Even academic scholarship often sees Christian mission as an offensive against ATRs (e.g., Comaroffs 1991, 1997; Miettinen 2006). This does not show us the full picture of ATRs or even Christianity in Africa. Active African participation within and between these two religions makes the situation much more complex and fluid. Christianity and ATRs are much more in a relationship of give and take than even many of their followers and especially many Christian leaders would like to admit. Until now, the Sonjo traditional leaders' decisions, leading towards a high degree of absorption of Christian ideas and doctrines, seem to have worked remarkably well. These obviously conscious decisions appear thus quite rational. In this case, ATR has proved to be not only active and receptive but also rational. The result, however, is that while the organizational success of Christian mission has been minimal, the values that the churches have been preaching may well be in surpris- ingly wide circulation. 27 In this case, what makes the encounter and fusion of elements of two religions' contextualization or inculturation is that one of the counterparts is Christianity and the process together with its outcome is accepted by the church leaders. Syncretism would be a similar process either outside of Christianity or within Christianity without the blessing of the ecclesiastic hierarchy (Vahakangas 2006b).</page><page sequence="23">Vahdkangas: Ghambageu Encounters Jesus in Sonjo Mythology 133 REFERENCES van Baaren, Th.
