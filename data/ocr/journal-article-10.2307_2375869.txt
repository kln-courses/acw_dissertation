<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN OUTLINE OF THE IDEALISTIC CONSTRUCTION OF EXPERIENCE. By J. B. Baillie, Professor of Moral Philosophy in the Uni- versity of Aberdeen. London: Macmillan &amp; Co.; New York: The lMlacmillan Co., I90i6. PP. xx, 344. Professor Baillie is already known to philosophical students as the author of a book on Hegel's Logic, from which it became at once apparent that he was a writer of genuine ability who had given a great deal of attention to the works of modern idealists, more particularly to those of Hegel. Some defects were also pretty readily discernible. The exposition was not always lucid; and it was somewhat doubtful whether the views put for- ward were always quite coherent. The book, however, sufficed to raise the hope in the minds of many readers that Mr. Baillie would before long produce other works of a similar character in which such defects would no longer be apparent. The book now before us to some extent realizes these hopes; but it is to be feared that to a large extent it will prove a disappointment. Like the previous book, it is in the main concerned with the exposition of the Hegelian point of view; and, like the previous book, it is characterized by a deeply sympathetic appreciation of that point of view, as well as by a competent knowledge of other philosophi-</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews. 257 cal positions, and a considerable degree of critical acumen in deal- ing with them. But the plan of the work is rather too compre- hensive to permit of the thorough treatment of any particular points; and one feels, in consequence, that there is a certain vague- ness and inconclusiveness throughout. Fundamental difficulties seem often to be rather evaded than solved; and occasionally it is even doubtful whether the doctrines put forward can be re- garded as forming a quite coherent whole. Notwithstanding these defects, however-some of which may lie rather in the reviewer than in the author-there can be no doubt that the work is an important contribution to philosophical literature. The general lines upon which the work proceeds may be briefly indicated. It contains ten chapters, five of which contain the substance of the Shaw Lectures in the University of Edin- burgh. The first is introductory; the second discusses Dualism; the third and fourth are concerned with the general nature of experience; the fifth is on sense-experience; the sixth is on "Understanding and the World of Noumena and Phenomena;" the seventh is on "self-conscious experience;" the eighth is on scientific experience; the ninth is on moral experience; and the tenth is on religious experience. The standpoint from which these subjects are dealt with is substantially that of Hegel; and indeed Mr. Baillie seems to have steeped himself so thoroughly in the Hegelian system that considerable parts of his book read rather like a translation from Hegel than like an independent treatise. He certainly adopts the Hegelian manner and phrase- ology to an extent that is unusual among British idealists; and the significance of the work would in many places be made much clearer if there were some more definite indication as to how much of it is to be regarded as Hegel's and how much as Mr. Baillie's. At the same time, it is evident that a good deal of attention has been given to more recent statements and criticisms of idealistic positions. In particular, Mr. Baillie seems to have been largely influenced by the works of the late Professor Adamson and the writings of some of the Pragmatists. Among the latter he refers more particularly to the logical work of Professor Dewey, who, if he is to be regarded as a Pragmatist, is surely a Pragmatist of a very different type from that represented by Messrs. James and Schiller, just as the late Professor Adamson represented a position very different from that of Messrs. Moore and Russell. On the whole, the chief significance of the work</page><page sequence="3">258 International Journal of Ethics. of Mr. Baillie seems to lie in the attempt to point out "a more excellent way" in idealistic thought than the somewhat half- hearted idealism of Lotze, Bradley, and even Bosanquet. This more excellent way is suggested by the criticisms of such writers as Adamson on the one hand and Dewey on the other, but consists substantially in a return to the more strictly Hegelian position. If something like this is Mr. Baillie's design, the present reviewer is certainly to a very large extent in sympathy with his aim. No writers, it seems to me, are better adapted than Adamson and Dewey to lead by their criticisms to a more adequate conception of what idealism really means; and I think the chief value of such a book as that of Mr. Baillie's is as an indication of the general results to which we might in this way be led. Any student of the critical writings of Adamson and Dewey, or again, of the criticisms of Kant and Lotze given by Caird and Henry Jones, might find it useful to turn to Mr. Baillie's book for a more posi- tive and constructive statement. But it does not seem to me that the statements here given are sufficiently clear, coherent, and cogent to be of the highest value to such a student. The treat- ment is too dogmatic-occasionally one might almost say oracu- lar-and the difficulties are not sufficiently brought forward and discussed. It will be seen, from the acount given above, that only a com- paratively small part of this book falls strictly within the province of a journal of ethics. The last two chapters are those that may be expected to have the most direct interest for our readers. Chapter IX is mainly concerned with the universality of the self as the basis of the social unity. On the more critical side, the inadequacy of the Kantian conception of the moral order is well brought out. But here, as throughout the book, one is con- scious of a certain vagueness in the treatment. One wishes that the difficulties involved in the relationship between the individual and society, in the antithesis between moral order and moral progress, and the like, could have been more fully considered. The concluding chapter is concerned with the various phases in the development of the religious consciousness, in which three main stages are recognized--"The Religion of Nature," "Religion of the Moral Order of Experience," and "Religion of the Spirit." Religion, Mr. Baillie maintains, "is more than morality, and goes beyond moral experience altogether." "In religious life," he</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews. 259 further states, "spirit is not merely all reality, but the point of view of the absolute reality is deliberately and consciously adopted as an attitude of experience. In religion man places himself at the point of view of God's spirit, and looks, thinks, feels, and acts in the 'sight' or in the 'light' of it." "We must not," however, "suppose that in religion the finite mind suddenly becomes God. To be one with God consciously, to take up the position of abso- lute spirit, is possible without man being God. Man is the re- ligious being, not God. In religion man merely takes up the attitude in which spirit, the supreme reality, is for itself: he is at the point of view of that spirit; that is all." "Strictly speaking," again, "so far from religion being purely anthropomorphic, it is the sphere where man is really deanthropomorphised. His peculiar characteristics as man are even eliminated altogether." "We must not suppose, further, that religion is one thing and the life of absolute spirit another. The life of absolute spirit appears just in religious consciousness. It shows itself to consciousness qua spirit, because itself is spirit, and that is all reality. The con- sciousness of it is religion. The expression of its content is the active life of absolute spirit. These are merely two sides of the same process, the same phase of experience. Hence, on this view, religion does not so much create the idea of absolute spirit; rather absolute spirit creates thfi religious life. It appears to the con- scious life of spirit." I have given these passages in Mr. Baillie's own words, because I must confess that this part of his book is one of those that I find it most difficult to make coherent or intelligible. Sometimes I can hardly even follow the grammatical structure of the sen- tences. For instance, I cannot feel quite sure what is the ante- cedent of "it" in the last sentence that has been quoted. It seems to me, moreover, that the lack of clearness in expression, both here and in some other places, is not accidental, but is the counter- part of a want of clearness in the view that Mr. Baillie is seek- ing to set forth. He seems never to have thoroughly considered the question as to the relation between the finite and the infinite in human experience, or in other words, as to the sense in which man is God and the sense in which man is to be distinguished from God. And so far as I can judge, it is the lack of clearness on this point that is mainly responsible for the difficulties that are to be found throughout Mr. Baillie's work. The closing sentences of the book are, however, even "darker"</page><page sequence="5">260 Internaitional1 Journal of Ethics. than those that I have just quoted. "It is by philosophy that all the processes of experience (religion among them) are con- structed. The development of experience as a whole attains its end in the realization of that mode of experience (philosophy) by which all experience has been evolved. The culmination of an absolute idealism is the justification of the idealistic position itself, as the ultimate form of knowledge." This surely would "want a Delian diver." My impression is, in general, that Mr. Baillie has here been making rather too ambitious an attempt. It is no doubt natural that any writer in whom the constructive impulse is strongly de- veloped should wish to see how the results of philosophic thought look as a whole. But, having once done this, it is to be hoped that Mr. Baillie will now turn his attention to more special prob- lems, and will attempt to develop them with greater clearness of exposition and with a more adequate sense of the difficulties that they involve.
