The past 10 years have seen a remarkable backlash against concepts of a "Great Mother Goddess" who domi- nated ancient religions. Works such as Meskell1 and Goodison and Morris2 have mostly lain to rest notions of a primeval, universal, peaceful, and certainly fertile mother goddess who dominated religious ideology and iconography since the Stone Age. Such a backlash has left a vacuum in its wake. No longer able, or wanting, to orient interpretations toward a centralized, monolithic feminine figure, scholars are devising new, more theo- retically informed ideologies about ancient religion and iconography. Aspects of sexuality other than the merely fertile are playing an increasingly important role in the academic literature. Scholars such as Gwendolyn Leick3 and Zainab Bahrani4 demonstrate that feminine eroticism often has more to do with the pleasurable aspects of sex rather than the reproductive. Notions of maternity and its rela- tionship to religion and iconography are also getting fresh print in the scholarly media. Julia Assante5 shows that not only has Mesopotamia produced no scenes of child- bearing to complement its vast repertoire of erotic art, but inhibitions on human fertility are far more promi- nent in the literature than concerns for increasing it. Diane Bolger6 argues against the stereotype of the "All- Powerful Mother" by noting that the earliest portrayals of women as mothers in the Cypriot Early Bronze Age accompanied an apparent decrease in women's status in Cypriot society: "Women's procreative role was trans- formed from child-bearer, a role linked primarily to fe- male fertility, to mother, a role restricted by the ideology of the patriarchal family." Conversely, Lynn Roller recon- siders the meaning of divine motherhood in a goddess specifically referred to as "Matar," or "mother." Seeing that the quintessential Phrygian mother goddess is never depicted pregnant or with children but rather with wild animals, Roller concludes: "The goddess becomes the Mother of the natural world, and her human worshippers approach her to gain her help in obtaining a measure of control over the natural environment . . . the material suggests that the Phrygian Mother Goddess was not lim- ited by the conventional modern definitions of motherly qualities, of fertility and nurturing, but was focused on a figure of power and protection."7 Iconography is another discipline being considered anew, and as P.R.S. Moorey remarks in Idols of the People: "The systematic deconstruction of the potent nineteenth century hypothesis of a Universal Earth or Mother God- dess in antiquity has been one of the most evident as- pects of this paradigm shift" (2003, 5). Concern now is to establish criteria by which actual goddesses might be recognized in the archaeology and iconography, to dis- tinguish them from mortal females, and to examine afresh what their iconography meant to ancient worshippers. The three works under consideration here approach these issues from a range of perspectives immensely helpful to students of ancient Near Eastern art generally and god- dess iconography specifically. Moorey's two works examine the history of terracottas in the ancient Near East (ANE) with a particular view toward religion. Ancient Near Eastern Terracottas is a survey of this art form from the Neolithic through the Persian periods (Graeco-Roman terracottas are not included in 1 Meskell 1995. 2 Goodison and Morris 1998. 3 Leick 1994, 123. 4 Bahrani 2001, 67, 83-9. 5 Assante 2003, 24-7. 6 Bolger 1996, 371. 7 Roller 1999, 114.

Its aim, according to Moorey's introduction to the Web site, is to "make avail- able for specialists a small but, within its range, represen- tative collection of a type of object much cited particularly in studies of prehistoric and early historic Near Eastern religion." Idols of the People is a shorter and more specialized publication consisting of three lec- tures originally given as part of the Schweich lecture se- ries of the British Academy. As the blurb on the back dust jacket makes clear, the focus of this series is "the archaeology, art, history, languages and literature of the Ancient Civilization with reference to Biblical Study"; the text thus revolves primarily around the terracottas of Canaan, Israel, and Judah. There is, of course, some overlap between these two publications. In general, Idols of the People serves as an excellent introduction to the study of ANE terracottas, functioning well as a prelude to the longer and more technical catalogue online. Chapter 1 of Idols, "In the Beginning: Origins and Originating Questions," deals with theory. Moorey be- gins with a general discussion on the relationship between biblical archaeology and textual studies, noting especially how these tend to be complementary rather than redun- dant. Following the theories of Dever8 and Keel and Uehlinger,9 Moorey discusses how terracottas, as the physical elements of cult for the common folk, provide evidence for the "people's" religion as (often) distinct from the established formal cult of the elite as presented in the biblical texts. Next, Moorey relates two major para- digm shifts in recent biblical (and beyond) archaeology: the move away from "Universal Mother Goddess" ide- ologies, and new developments in cognitive archaeology. A number of important issues are expressed clearly in the latter portion of the chapter, a boon for anyone (es- pecially archaeologists and art historians) seeking to con- struct a theoretical framework for ancient artifacts. Moorey presents (albeit summarily) the now canonical theories of Ucko and Voigt, who tackled the issue of what terracotta figurines do for those who make and use them, especially as vehicles for magic or as toys. Furthermore, as Moorey notes, there is no reason to suppose that indi- vidual figurines served only one function, rather "[a] potential plurality of meanings is accepted here as basic to understanding the role of terracottas in the ancient Near East" (9). Such issues, continues Moorey, might only be addressed through a careful examination of find con- texts and the evidence of use (such as breakage patterns) present on the bodies of the terracottas themselves. Finally, Moorey places the study of material culture generally, and terracottas specifically, within the context of an entire society. The meaning of figurines might be gleaned from the study of changes occurring within the society, while, conversely, social change or stability may be manifest in the changes or lack thereof in the artistic repertoire. For example, Moorey notes that while female images usually dominate the anthropomorphic repertoire, males with horses and/or chariots become prevalent dur- ing periods of extensive state formation. Textual evidence must come into play for the historical periods, whether one is considering the cuneiform or hieroglyphic inscrip- tions on some terracottas from Mesopotamia and Egypt or correlating possible biblical references to figurines from the Levant, such as the controversial "Asherah" images discussed in the final chapter of the book. The second chapter of Idols, "Terracottas in Early Com- plex Societies: Sumer, Babylonia, Syria, Egypt and Canaan (c. 3000-1150 BC)," is somewhat misnamed since it is actually the study of a specific iconography found through- out the ANE from the Early Bronze Age through the Persian period: the nude female shown en face, often wearing jewelry and frequently with an elaborate hair- style. This image is distinct from the nude female imagery typical of the Neolithic, which has no such standard- ization and is separated from the later nude female im- ages by a chronological break in the Mesopotamian Early Dynastic period. Moorey follows the development of these images from stylized jar handles first appearing in Sumer through the rise of mold-based technology in their manufacture and dissemination up to the point where these nude females are rendered as clothed by the Per- sians. While much of this development takes place in Mesopotamia and Syria, Moorey devotes a portion of the chapter to Egyptian influences as well, especially when discussing the standard nude female typologies of Egyp- tian-influenced Qudshu images and the more Mesopotamian Astarte plaques. Once again, issues beyond merely the iconographic come into play in Moorey's analy- ses. Find contexts (sacred, domestic, rubbish) are consid- ered, as are patterns of breakage and even the extent to which figurines might be comfortably held in the hand, all with a view of providing evidence as to how the images may have been used by those who created them. The final chapter of Idols brings the study back to the original aim of the Schweich series: the biblical world. In "Terracotta Imagery in Israel and Judah under the Divided Monarchy (c. 925-586 BC)," Moorey addresses the so- called Judean Pillar Figurines (JPFs) and their possible relationship to the Canaanite-biblical Asherah. Ultimately, Moorey argues against this identification, noting two meth- odological problems in particular: (1) if the JPF with large breasts and a hand- or mold-made head represents a god- dess, what is to be made of the male-on-horseback figu- rines that typically accompany it?; (2) ethnographic parallels argue against the identification of such figurines as deities and propose identification as possible ancestor idols (among other uses) . Furthermore, alternate examples of pillar-based images in the Near East, both earlier and contemporary, seem to use the pillar shape to indicate clothing on both males and females. Moorey sees this as more likely an explanation for the shape than a reference to the tree imagery of the biblical Asherah. Moorey strengthens his argument throughout the chap- ter by examining the repertoire of Israelite and Judean terracottas - anthropomorphic male and female, animal images, chariots, furniture, and house models - within 8 Dever 2001. 9 Keel and Uehlinger 1998.</page><page sequence="3">2006] THREE STUDIES OF ANCIENT NEAR EASTERN ICONOGRAPHY 163 their find contexts. He specifically focuses on the finds from Cave I (Ophel) in Jerusalem and Area E-207 in Samaria (incorrectly typed as 257 in the section head- ing), noting the range of items found in context with the terracotta figurines and possible explanations for how these assemblages wound up in their respective "caves." The contents of Cave I, including several JPFs, are prima- rily domestic in character, indicating that both the female figurines and their male equivalents served a domestic purpose, possibly related to a domestic cult. This contrasts with the contents of E-207, which are arguably more cultic in character (lamps, kernoi, braziers). In the end, Moorey makes clear that the analysis of female terracotta figurines in any ANE context is complex, requiring careful atten- tion to context, social milieu, textual information, and comparative data from related regions. The theories and methodologies introduced in Idols are used extensively in Moorey' s Ancient Near Eastern Terracottas. The text begins with a brief history of the study of ANE terracottas since the 19th century. A discus- sion of theory in the study and analysis of ANE terracottas follows. As Moorey himself states, two specific interpre- tive frameworks are used throughout the catalogue: "an- thropological and ethnological analogy and comparative evidence from written sources for ancient magic and re- ligion" (6). Moorey gives brief but helpful explanations of both. His section "Ancient Magic and Religion" notes the highly permeable membrane separating these two concepts in the ANE: the distinction (as he sees it) be- tween "folk," or "domestic," and "elite" religious practice, and the dominant role of women in the former. The sec- tion "Ethno-Anthropological Analogies" presents in much greater detail than Idols the theories of Ucko and Voigt, spelling out Voigt's five most prevalent functional catego- ries of terracotta figurines: cult figures, vehicles of magic, teaching figurines, toys, and/or representations of ances- tors (8). The chapter ends with a discussion on the rela- tionship between terracottas and the cuneiform evidence from Mesopotamia, both in how notions of clay are pre- sented in the mythology and how terracottas themselves are (or are not) inscribed. The format of the publication after the introduction consists of a chapter presenting the period and region in question, including issues of social change and techno- logical development, followed by a catalogue of figurines from the Ashmolean's collection related to that period. Several chapters end with a section of summary thoughts on the preceding data, wherein Moorey offers a general analysis of the terracottas as they functioned in their social milieux. Although a catalogue, Moorey's Web site includes times and places for which even the Ashmolean has no or very few examples of terracottas. One slight weakness of the publication is that the Ashmolean provides the only pic- tures of figurines in the catalogue; objects described in the text but that do not belong to the Ashmolean are not illustrated. The prehistoric period from ca. 8500 to 3000 B.C.E. from Anatolia and the Levant to Iran is presented in one chapter that is broken down into subsections based on chronology ("The Emergence of Figurines in the Pre- Pottery Neolithic A") and geography ("The Late Prehis- toric Levant"). Moorey begins this section with a very brief discussion of cultural trends during this period, such as the rise of agriculture, the early conglomeration of villages, and of course the development of pottery. Al- ready from this prehistoric period Moorey notes the preva- lence of the feminine in figurine studies, both in terms of the quantity of female figurines at this early date and the (likely) creation and use of such figurines by women in a domestic context, probably ritual. In spite of this clear emphasis on the feminine, however, Moorey is care- ful to avoid falling into the Mother Goddess ideology. He points out the various possible functions of figurines in the domestic context, arguing that the lives of males and females were hardly segregated and that there is no rea- son to assume that men did not also make use of terracotta figurines. Such concepts, combined with Voigt's theo- ries, are expressed in a long analysis of the figurines, iconography, and archaeology of Qatalhoyuk and Hacilar in central Anatolia, long centers of debate regarding the "Goddess" question. After this prehistoric section, chapters are arranged first by chronology, then geography. The first major sub- division, entitled "The Bronze Age," is a slight misnomer, since the section contains materials from Mesopotamia and Iran from ca. 3000 to 350, as well as Bronze Age materials from Syria. The section on "Iron Age" is re- served exclusively for the Levant, divided north and south and followed by a very brief consideration of Bronze and Iron Age figurines from Anatolia and an even briefer look at a few forgeries in the Ashmolean's collection. The historical chapters have less emphasis on the history of the regions in question than did the prehistoric, al- though issues of technological development, especially in terms of mold-made technology, remain prominent. The section on Babylonian mold-made plaques is exten- sive, although Moorey admits that his presentation "does not attempt to be comprehensive," merely offering a background for the Ashmolean's collection. In all cases, Moorey includes as much contextual mate- rial as possible, not always easy for figurines from the early days of archaeology or from illicit "excavations." The most significant excavations are included in their relevant sections with comprehensive bibliography. No- tation is made concerning find sites (rubbish, domestic, funerary), states of preservation, wear patterns, and simi- lar iconography in alternate media. Thus, for one of the dominant motifs running through the text - the nude female - Moorey notes the variety of media in which the images appear (e.g., terracotta, glyptic, glass), the con- texts in which such images were discovered, and the re- lated textual data, both inscriptional and literary. The catalogue section is thorough and inclusive. Each object is accompanied by a photograph or reconstructive drawing, mostly in black and white. Every entry begins with a full description of the object, including appear- ance, materials, dimensions, and bibliography. Significant single objects or groups of related objects are then fol- lowed by small "interpretive essays" discussing the his- tory, meaning, and debates surrounding the object(s). One might, therefore, read through the entire text as a history of ANE terracottas generally, or work through the catalogue sections to follow the rise and development of</page><page sequence="4">164 STEPHANIE LYNN BUDIN [AJA110 particular themes in ANE art. There is no index, but being Web-based, keyword searches function in this respect. Of the three works under consideration, Cornelius' The Many Faces of the Goddess is the weakest, due primarily to an incongruity between the author's stated aims and what the book actually achieves. According to Cornelius, the goal of this study "was to collect original iconographic sources on the goddesses Anat, Asherah, Astarte and Qedeshet and provide an iconographical typology. . . . The primary aim was to provide visual source material in one book which can be used by other scholars writing the history of ancient Syro-Palestinian culture and religion' (author's ital- ics, 7). However, instead of a comprehensive treatment on Levantine goddess iconography in the Late Bronze Age, Cornelius' work is more a study of Egyptian and Egyptianizing iconographies of named Levantine god- desses in the Late Bronze Age. The book belongs to the Orbis Biblicus et Orientalis series published through the Academic Press Fribourg under the auspices of Othmar Keel and Christoph Uehlinger. A primary interest of the "Fribourg School" is the study of Near Eastern iconography as an element of ANE religion, especially as concerns the religious his- tory of Canaan, Israel, and Judah. The first chapter of Faces places the text squarely within this paradigm. Here, Cornelius provides a short introduction on the decline in "Goddess" studies - with footnoted bibliography for further reading - as well as a more complete history of goddess studies pertaining to Near Eastern, and espe- cially biblical, religions, once again with extensive bibli- ography. His treatment of cognitive archaeology is less exhaustive than Moorey's, but Cornelius does provide an interesting excursus on early scholastic prejudices against the "pagan" religions of the Levant, leading to prudish and often hostile analyses of the nude female images prevalent in this culture, especially in relation to the supposed Canaanite "orgiastic nature-worship" and sacred prostitution. Chapter 2, "Iconographic Types," presents in narra- tive fashion Cornelius' catalogue of goddess images. It is here that the weaknesses of the text first appear. The or- ganization of the catalogue by iconographic types, as op- posed to chronology or region, is not too problematic. It allows one to focus, for example, on the equestrian goddess as a distinct group, although it becomes difficult to study issues of development and transference. This is exacerbated by Cornelius' stated methodology, which is to focus first on inscribed, named images, and to pro- ceed from there to related unnamed images. While this approach does have the benefit of going from the known to the unknown, it also means that all issues of Levantine goddess iconography begin, for Cornelius, in Egypt. Problems continue when Cornelius is unclear about how he identifies some of his goddess images, especially those with no inscribed names in the Egyptian corpus. For example, he calls the "seated menacing goddess" on an Egyptian stele Anat but gives no evidence for how he came to this identification (22). More explicit informa- tion is usually provided for Astarte, who is also more commonly identified by name in the images. However, when a goddess might be either Anat or Astarte, Cornelius more frequently opts for Astarte without always giving reasons for his decision. Another problem is that Cornelius seldom considers Mesopotamian precedents. To give one example, he dis- cusses repeatedly whether wings should establish an iden- tification of Anat. He notes that the literary texts from Ugarit often describe Anat as winged but argues that this literary description should not automatically be trans- ferred to the iconography. He does not, however, con- sider alternate manifestations of wings in ANE iconography, especially in glyptic. That the Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar is portrayed both winged and armed should have played heavily into Cornelius' discussion of iconography concerning both winged and armed Levantine goddesses. Likewise, the majority of goddess images in Faces are the so-called Qudshu variation of the nude female. Cornelius argues that such images may be understood as goddesses because of their relationship with the clearly divine, identified-by-inscription Qedeshet in the Egyptian repertoire. But he leaves out completely the Astarte variation, which is more traditionally Mesopotamian. Furthermore, in tracing the Qudshu im- age primarily to Egypt (although he does recognize an ultimately Levantine or Mesopotamian origin for the type), Cornelius ignores possible Mesopotamian prede- cessors, and thus possible identifications or interpreta- tions, of this icon. Chapter 3, "Distribution, Attributes, Titles," provides statistical information, not merely on those elements mentioned in the title but also on media, common scenes, and styles of dress. The chapter can prove useful to the reader interested in correlating various elements of Levantine goddess iconographies. Once again, though, Cornelius does not expand his study to examine the his- tory, development, and meaning of the various attributes within this chapter, with the commentary on wings given above as an example of the kinds of data that are lacking. The final chapter summarizes the various data presented throughout the text along with Cornelius' conclusions. Following is the catalogue itself, which provides (when possible) findspot, current location, materials, dimen- sions, description, and full bibliography. All images are located at the end of the book. Beyond the methodological problems discussed above, the overall layout of the book might prove difficult to the reader. The narrative sections use both footnotes and parenthetical references copiously, so the eye often must jump about the page to follow the text. The illustra- tions are located in the back of the book in two to four separate conglomerations; objects in the catalogue are in the "Plates" section, running from 1.1 through 5.62 and then A-C. Images not in the catalogue are in the "Figures" section, labeled A-B and 1-54. At any given time, the reader is flipping through several parts of the book at once. Furthermore, the numbered images do not necessarily run in numeric order. There is no index, al- though the table of contents is well detailed. In the end, Faces is a worthwhile resource for the scholar approaching it with the proper expectations. It serves as a good study of the Egyptian and Egyptianizing iconographies of Levantine goddesses in the Late Bronze Age. That the objects in the catalogue are either Egyp-</page><page sequence="5">2006] THREE STUDIES OF ANCIENT NEAR EASTERN ICONOGRAPHY 165 tian or Egyptianizing might be attributed to Cornelius' just caution against overidentifying female images as god- desses, a problem with earlier works on ANE iconography. Transfers between the Levant and Egypt are noted, as are Egyptian and Canaanite influences on various works of art. The initial chapter, as well as the statistical analyses, cataloguing, and illustrations, make the text useful to the researcher of Near Eastern goddess iconography.
