<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE STANDING ARMED FIGURINES IN THE LEVANT, by Helga Seeden. (Institut ffir Vorgeschichte der Uni- versitdit Frankfurt a. M. Prdihistorische Bronzefun- de 1, 1.) Pp. vi + 169, figs. 137, pls. 17. C.H. Beck'sche Verlag, Munich 1980. DM 154. This volume in the ambitious Prdhistorische Bronzefun- de series is concerned with what the author believes to be warrior deities, and some of their "consorts." It thus treats in greater detail some of the figurines discussed by Ora Neg- bi in Canaanite Gods in Metal (see review AJA 86 [1982] 299). After a short introductory survey of some of the many previous studies of such figurines and an explanation of the importance of the Byblos material, which occupies half the book and 85% of the catalogue, the author discusses and cat- alogues 1832 bronzes (mostly male types) which she divides into twelve groups. These follow a roughly chronological sequence. Group I consists of the remarkable figurines excavated at Judeideh, dated here to the late third millennium (but see below); Group II, of Seyrig's heavy, "Lebanese Mountain" figures (Syria 30 [1953] 24-50), bareheaded, some with spears, dated ca. 2000 B.C. Group III, North Syrian prod- ucts of the turn of the second millennium B.C., consists of the famous, wonderfully stylized electrum figures from Ras Shamra and their close counterparts, as well as unprove- nanced, crude, flat-faced couples, and double couples.

Group IV, "The Orontes Figures," combines the statuettes with spiked, plumed headdresses studied by Porada (Berytus 7 [1947] 57-63), with all other figures with "fancy" hairdos and hats including Mesopo- tamian horned crowns. These are dated from the end of the third to the mid-second millennium B.C. Groups V-IX consist of the figures from Byblos. The findspots of the hoards are carefully reviewed. Most types overlap in the hoards and are therefore contemporaneous. Seeden's groups here are based on stylistic, iconographic and technical criteria. V comprises small, crude, nude (some "ithyphallic") figures; VI, taller, more decorous figures; VII, good pieces made from individual molds; VIII, figures of all the above types, cut from foil. Groups V-VIII belong to the Middle Urban (i.e., Bronze) Age. Group IX, the "smiting gods" of the Late Urban (i.e., Bronze) Age, degen- erate in style at the end of the period. It is not clear (92) whether any were included in the hoards. The divine char- acter of the Byblos figurines, their use in miniature shrines in the Obelisk Temple, the relationship of artisans to temple personnel and the bearing of the development of types on the religious, social and political history of the site are topics discussed at some length at this point. Group X, "The Ras Shamra Figurines," consists mainly of the "smiting gods" of the Late Bronze period from Ugarit; Group XI, "Figurines from other Near Eastern sites," is mostly composed of representations of this same god, a deity who appears to have a much wider popularity than the ear- lier, passive "warriors." A final Group (XII) consists of "Figurines of Foreign Provenance," most of which (except those from Anatolia) are thought to have been made in or influenced by the Levant. In the following two sections ("The Function of the Fig- urines" and "Conclusions"), the author reviews each item of dress, parallels in other arts, and inscriptions and texts which cast light on the subject. She concludes that the figu- rines represent an exclusively Syro-Palestinian phenome- non; that the pieces, in all periods, under any name, in any dress, represent a single deity who symbolizes fertility and war (life and death). The change in iconography in the mid- dle of the second millennium B.C. came about because "the healthy Asiatic attitude toward the representation of nude statuettes had been abandoned.... The more primitive na- ture-bound nude god is gradually replaced by an urbanized specialized war-god whose other aspect is tacitly understood but no longer expressed" (149). The catalogue, which includes description, history and full bibliography of each piece, and the good drawings of 1831 figurines plus 20 plates of well selected comparative material, make this volume a very useful tool. We must all be grateful to the author for the meticulous care with which she undertook this enormous task. There are unfortunately some problems in the analysis of the material. Serious contradictions exist. The Judeideh fig- ures are dated to the Early Urban period on p. 8 and on the chart, but the conclusion (151) states "no Early Urban site yielded any such figures." Byblos is said to have all types (5), but Groups I-III are missing. The grouping of some figures seems arbitrary, as the heterogeneous pieces gath- ered together on pls. 19-27 under the classification Group IV will show. Headdresses undoubtedly had significance in ancient times and distinctions should be made among them, at least between crowns and helmets. It is puzzling to find Hittite figurines whose Hittite characteristics are acknow- ledged (137) regarded as Levantine products because of the alleged Syrian provenance of two pieces (112). The wide ranging interpretation of the evidence is sometimes specula- tive: in the Late Urban period, the god resembling the king in battle dress and "usurped by the palace rulers" was joined by a war goddess: "The female life principle was assimi- lated to the urban military enterprise and the result dressed up as urban police, but endowed with supernatural powers to give victory and life or defeat, slavery and death" (154). The author's theories dealing with fertility lack proof. I wonder if any of the crudely made figures are meant to be ithyphallic, and whether going without clothes is a refer- ence to sex rather than a matter of class and custom. On the other hand, one would have appreciated speculation on the significance of the close connection between Byblos and Egypt at the time of the Byblos hoards and the exotic Obe- lisk Temple. The most important question about these figures is that of their identity. The author feels sure that the passive Mid- dle Bronze figurines are divine because: 1) they stand armed in shrines at Byblos; 2) they embody opposing character- istics-fertility and war-in a single figure and 3) they are predecessors of the "smiting god" known from later inscrip- tions to be divine (96). This last point would be convincing if it could be proved, but it is not even sure that all the fig- ures were armed. More importantly, do "weapons" imply warlike intent any more than do a dress sword, the cowboy's hunting knife or rifle? The "daggers" of these Middle Bronze people may be merely the forerunners of our pocket knives. On so crucial a question as divinity answers might be sought in ancient Egypt, or Mesopotamia where, inscrip- tions tell us, most anthropomorphic images represent hu- man beings.
