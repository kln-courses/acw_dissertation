<plain_text><page sequence="1">A General Theory of Expropriative Crime: An Evolutionary Ecological Approach' Lawrence E. Cohen Indiana University Richard Machalek University of Wyoming Ever since Durkheim, many social scientists have subscribed to the premise that deviance and crime are "normal" properties of natu- rally functioning social systems. When trying to explain the causes of these behaviors, however, many social scientists typically resort to the idea of "pathological" origins. On the whole, social scientists have yet to explain how and why "normal" individuals operating in unexceptional social environments deviate and commit crimes. Re- cent developments in behavioral ecology and evolutionary biology provide new insights that promise to explain how deviance and crime arise naturally in populations of interacting individuals with- out necessarily implying genetic influences. We interpret criminal behaviors by which offenders expropriate goods or services from others as expressions of diverse behavioral strategies that derive from normal patterns of population-level social organization and interaction. This view accommodates both explanations that focus on individual causes of crime and those directed toward social fac- tors. Our approach permits the generation of novel hypotheses and fully accommodates, simplifies, and helps unify important and di- verse insights and findings amassed by a wide range of disciplines and theories that have tried to account for the nature and distribu- tion of crime. Deviance and crime are often viewed as complex phenomena, as is reflected by the variety of theories that have been proposed to account for ' The research reported in this paper was supported in part by a National Science Foundation grant (SES 82-17865) and a sabbatical leave from Trinity University.

Sociologists, economists, psychologists, and biological scientists have all developed different explanations of criminal and de- viant behavior, and one can also find many varieties of causal models in each of these disciplines. Unfortunately, the theoretical insights and em- pirical findings derived from these different approaches remain largely disconnected. Consequently, deviance and crime are understood only in piecemeal fashion, and the various approaches adopted to study these topics are badly in need of some attempt at unification. The purpose of this article is to introduce a theoretical perspective that serves to synthe- size established insights and empirical findings from the different disci- plines that have studied deviance and crime as well as to stimulate new kinds of inquiry. We note that, when trying to identify the "root causes" of deviance and crime, many scholars have invoked the idea of "pathological" origins such as malfunctioning social systems, malintegrated cultures, imperfect so- cialization, psychological aberrations, and constitutional excesses, defi- ciencies, or abnormalities. Lost in such explanations is Durkheim's (1938) dictum about deviance and crime as "normal" behavior performed by "normal" individuals in unexceptional social systems. Despite the fre- quency with which students of deviance and crime invoke this dictum, we are not well informed about how and why "normal" individuals acting in unexceptional social environments deviate and commit crimes. How, in fact, may it be said that deviance and crime are "normal"? Until this question is answered, the "root causes" of these behaviors will not be well understood. Once this question is answered, however, we may be able to synthesize the findings from the various disciplines and develop a more inclusive theory to explain many forms of deviance and crime. We concur with Durkheim that it is possible to trace the genesis of deviance and crime to normal social processes. Toward that end, we enlist a modified version of an explanatory approach developed in behavioral ecology and evolutionary biology in order to explain, in naturalistic terms, the "nor- mality" of much deviance and crime in human populations. We begin with the observation that many studies that attribute crime and deviance to individual "pathologies" share a common problem: they fail to acknowledge directly the social context within which individual differences acquire meaning. An example of the problem inherent in this type of approach is illustrated by Wilson and Herrnstein's (1985) attempt to synthesize, under one general theory, the findings from the various disciplines that have studied crime. After an extensive review of the empirical literature, they conclude that constitutional or biological traits (e.g., male gender, youthful age, mesomorphic body type) as well as some psychological traits with a biological origin (e.g., low IQ, poor con- ditionability, volatile temperament, impulsiveness, depressed arousal 466</page><page sequence="3">Crime level) predispose individuals toward criminality. After considering the influence of these traits, and family factors as well, they conclude that there is little variation in individual criminality left to explain. Hence, sociological variables such as social class, peer influence, community structure, labor markets, and political economy are said not to be of primary significance as causes of crime in individuals. To the contrary, we contend not only that social factors are as signifi- cant as, or more than, individual traits in explaining crime but also that Wilson and Herrnstein's analysis of the individual dimensions of criminal behavior is found wanting. Approaches, such as Wilson and Herrnstein's, that seek the causes of crime in differences among individuals have both strengths and weaknesses. The strength of their approach is that it treats the individual as the unit of observation, since it is always individuals, acting singly or in groups, who actually commit crimes. Yet Wilson and Herrnstein's approach is seriously weakened by their treatment of the individual as the proper unit of analysis because it renders them incapa- ble of understanding fully how populations of interacting individuals create social contexts that both facilitate and inhibit deviant and criminal behavior. Crime and deviance are better explained sociologically but in a manner that retains a focus on the behavior of individuals. We propose that one can better explain variation in these behaviors by the variable incidence of alternative behavioral strategies that are employed by individuals. As we shall see, behavioral strategies are not properties of individuals as such. Instead, they are behavioral options, the expression of which may vary independently of the characteristics of the individuals who adopt them. By focusing on behavioral strategies rather than individuals as the unit of analysis, our approach is at once both sociological and consistent with the undeniably pertinent fact that it is always individuals who com- mit crime. We show how recent advances by evolutionary biologists and behav- ioral ecologists now enable us to understand better how individual factors contribute to strategy choices in a manner that is entirely consistent with sociological theorizing. Our analysis demonstrates further that the in- teractive dynamics of social systems, compared with individual traits, are themselves at least equal, and often far more potent, contributors to behavioral choices in populations. The premise of this article is that many forms of deviance and crime are best viewed as normal expressions of diverse behavioral strategies as construed by evolutionary biologists and behavioral ecologists. Biologists characterize behavioral diversity in populations as the expression of vari- ous behavioral strategies that organisms adopt to meet their needs. Some of these strategy alternatives include behaviors by means of which organ- 467</page><page sequence="4">American Journal of Sociology isms expropriate resources from each other. Expropriative strategies are defined here as patterns of behavior by which individuals or groups usurp labor, objects of symbolic or material value, or other such resources from other individuals or groups. Among such strategies are included many forms of deviance and crime. While the idea of deviance and crime as a behavioral strategy for expropriating resources from others is not new, the version developed here is novel to both the biological and social sciences. For example, our approach departs somewhat from that taken by sociobiologists, who generally interpret expropriative strategies as ge- netically acquired adaptive behaviors that ultimately enhance reproduc- tive success. We also take exception to the tendency of many economists to explain the existence of expropriative crime as the result of a deliberate cost/benefit calculation that determines acts on the basis of their per- ceived consequences. Similarly, we analyze expropriative crime in a man- ner different from that of the sociological strain theorists, who view such acts as the result of a lack of access to legitimate means for achieving culturally valued goals. Our approach differs from these perspectives in a number of ways. First, we assume that culture and highly developed intelligence have given humans considerable control over biologically based behavioral predispositions such that they are often able to disregard the inclination to act on these urges. Nonetheless, humans often employ strategies acquired through processes that resemble "natural selection." As we shall see, these processes are typically cultural in nature and need not depend on intergenerational genetic variation. Accordingly, the behavioral strate- gies described herein may work to the advantage of individuals without increasing their reproductive success. In addition, we question some of the assumptions inherent in the model of the rational criminal employed by many economists. We emphasize that it is often impossible to assess accurately cost/benefit ratios for any particular actor without also considering what other persons in the popu- lation are doing within a context of multiple available behavioral alterna- tives. That is, when the payoff for and the successful completion of an act depend on the behaviors of others in the population, a simple cost/benefit ratio of the actor's options may be inadequate. We adjust the typical economic model by first suggesting that the payoffs for actions often vary inversely with the number of others who are engaging in the same strat- egy; hence, they are "frequency dependent" (Fischer 1930). This means that an individual's adoption of a given strategy, and often its potential for success, depends heavily upon the kinds of strategies adopted by others in the population and the frequency with which they are employed. Second, while we agree with economists that individuals often engage in expropriative crime in order to obtain satisfaction, we emphasize that 468</page><page sequence="5">Crime behavioral patterns (expropriative strategies) can be adopted on the basis of their consequences without this "choice" necessarily involving con- scious (rational) calculation or illegitimate teleology. Finally, unlike sociological strain theorists, we assume that many acts of expropriative crime and deviance are perpetrated by individuals who do not necessarily lack access to legitimate means available to achieve culturally valued goals. Instead, our approach explains why expropria- tive strategies are sometimes adopted by the economically advantaged as well as the disadvantaged. By viewing deviance and crime as expressions of behavioral diversity, we are able to employ an evolutionary ecological theory. It should be emphasized that this approach neither denies the uniqueness of human cultural phenomena nor reduces culture to biological components such as genes. Rather, we integrate previously unrelated social science insights with the aid of established principles of behavioral ecology and evolution- ary theory. Before discussing the origins of diverse behavioral strategies such as deviance and crime, we must first introduce some basic concepts of behavioral ecology and evolutionary biology. We take care to show how these explanations were intended to account for behavioral diversity in animal populations and then suggest how suitable modifications allow them to be extended to human populations as well without recourse to genetic reductionism. THE INDIVIDUAL AS STRATEGIST Broadly defined, a strategy is a behavioral pattern for attaining an end, whether intended or not. For example, all organisms employ strategies for activities such as securing mates, foraging for food, and evading predators. When a strategy increases the reproductive success ("fitness") of an organism, it may be described as an "evolutionary strategy" (May- nard Smith 1982). We broaden the term to include behaviors that bestow various material and symbolic benefits as well. Although the concept has teleological connotations, strategy need not imply an intelligent being calculating and adopting a course of action consciously designed to achieve a goal. If this were the case, only humans would qualify indisputably as strategists. Instead, by developing a view of organisms as strategists, behavioral biologists have begun to unravel many mysteries about the evolution of animal behavior, including social interactions. The British biologist John Maynard Smith has been influen- tial recently in promoting the view of organisms as strategists. He pio- neered the application of game theory, adapted from economics and soci- ology, to evolutionary biology (Maynard Smith 1979). Intuitively, it might appear that game theory is inapplicable to the behavior of any 469</page><page sequence="6">American Journal of Sociology organism except humans. After all, humans alone appear capable of foresight, imaginative rehearsal, and conscious cost/benefit accounting. But the ingenuity of Maynard Smith's approach is based on his realiza- tion that the logic of game theory can be used by evolutionary biologists without having to assume that organisms think. Consequently, he has applied game theory successfully to traditional problems in evolutionary biology. Because humans are endowed with a unique combination of cognition, high intelligence, long-term memory, and culture, they present a special case for the study of strategy evolution. Before we attempt to understand strategy evolution in its most complex expression, among humans, it is instructive to examine how strategies evolve among much simpler organ- isms. Toward that end, we turn our attention to animal strategists. We can best illustrate how strategies of behavior evolve among animals by natural selection with the aid of an example of an organism that is almost certainly devoid of cognitive abilities, an insect. This example illustrates how organisms behave as strategists even though they are devoid of individual powers of rationality, calculability, or foresight. This will en- able us to explain how nonpurposive processes among humans can result in the "selection" and proliferation of some strategies over others. A New Fable of the Bees Male bees of the species Centris pallida employ a searching strategy for securing mates that biologists call "patrolling." Patrolling entails search- ing the ground for a buried female, locating her, digging her up, then mating with her (Alcock, Jones, and Buchmann 1977). This behavior pattern has been determined to be the product of natural selection, which means that it reflects a genetic component (Wilson 1978, p. 19). The behavior of all insects is tightly constrained by their genes (Wilson 1971). In this example, natural selection presumably favored the transmission of certain alleles (specific versions of a given gene) that predisposed some males to patrol rather than to employ an alternative course of action. It is crucial to understand that the behavior called patrolling is not "intended" by the bee, in any anthropomorphic sense, to secure mates. It can be explained as follows: Assume that genetic variation among male bees produces behavioral variation, a fact well documented by extensive experimental research (Wilson 1971). Assume further that some behav- ioral variants (such as patrolling) result in greater reproductive success than do others. Therefore, we can expect the patrolling strategy to prolif- erate in subsequent generations simply because alleles "for patrolling" increase disproportionately because of the reproductive success of pa- trolling itself, which, in turn, produces even more alleles for patrolling, 470</page><page sequence="7">Crime and so on. Despite all appearances, male bees are not motivated to patrol "in order" to produce progeny. Rather, they are merely biologically pre- disposed to behave in the manner that made their ancestors more success- ful reproducers than their ancestors' competitors. Natural selection thereby yields organisms that are at once completely devoid of intent and very effective strategists. Three additional concepts basic to evolutionary biology are required to complete our characterization of the individual as strategist. They are adaptation, advantage, and resource holding potential (RHP). Adapta- tions are any traits (physical or behavioral) that increase an organism's chances of producing offspring that survive to reproductive age. By defi- nition, any variation "from random in a direction that promotes fitness" is "adaptive" (Barash 1982, p. 58). Adaptations are to be distinguished from "advantages." A trait is advantageous when it contributes to the survival and general well-being of an organism. Advantages yield benefits such as food, shelter, and protection from disease and death. In principle, a trait may be advantageous without being adaptive. Traits that bestow advan- tages are typically of evolutionary importance, however, because they often prove adaptive.2 Finally, the concept of resource holding potential (RHP) completes the minimal conceptual inventory required to explain the evolution of diverse behavioral strategies in any population (Barash 1982; Maynard Smith 1982; Parker 1974). Drawing on the language of game theory, evolution- ary biologists describe competitions for valued resources as "contests" (Maynard Smith and Price 1973; Maynard Smith 1974). The nature of contests and their outcomes vary for two reasons. First, the individual contestants often differ in traits relevant to competition, such as age, size, or intelligence. Taken as a whole, the complete set of an individual's traits relevant to a particular "contest" compose its RHP. If, for example, two deer are contesting a resource such as breeding territory, differences in the RHP trait of size are important factors influencing contest out- comes. Second, differences in RHP may be balanced, or even offset, by the respective value of the resource to each contestant. For example, in a 2 Among humans, this distinction raises interesting questions about the relationship between social and reproductive success (Betzig 1986; Vining 1986). For example, a psychological trait such as high intelligence may very well prove advantageous by enabling a person to gain power, wealth, or prestige. At the same time, these advan- tages are not automatically adaptive in the strict biological sense of the term. That is, while such social advantages quite often enhance opportunities for greater reproduc- tive success, they do not guarantee it. In fact, scholars have documented declining fertility among those social strata enjoying the greatest degree of social success (Vining 1986). In short, advantageous strategies are not necessarily adaptive. It seems, how- ever, that this situation characterizes human behavior only in a minority of human societies and fails to typify the behavior of nonhuman species (Vining 1986). 471</page><page sequence="8">American Journal of Sociology contest over a piece of food, one animal may be stronger and more experi- enced than its opponent. If, on the other hand, it has eaten more recently than its competitor, it may "assign" less value to the contested food than its famished opponent (Hansen 1986, p. 791). In this case, RHP superior- ity (strength and experience) may be less important in determining the contest outcome than the unequal value of the resource to each contes- tant. For the well-fed RHP superior, the morsel may be mere dessert; for the nearly starved RHP inferior, it may mean the difference between life and death. Accordingly, this contest may be decided more on the basis of need asymmetry than on differences in ability. Asymmetries of need (or ability) are often important determinants of the evolution of behavioral diversity. In sum, there are two basic types of contest asymmetry: RHP asymmetry and resource value asymmetry.3 Finally, it should be under- stood that whether a given characteristic is an RHP trait depends upon the particular activity in question. Among some male birds, for example, color intensity of their plumage may be the crucial RHP trait for acquir- ing mates, while speed may be the crucial RHP trait for avoiding a predator. THE EVOLUTION OF BEHAVIORAL DIVERSITY An animal's chances of success in an activity depend not only upon the particular strategy it employs but also upon the strategies being used by others in its population and the relative frequency with which each is employed (Dawkins 1980, p. 343). This introduces an explicitly sociolog- ical dimension to strategy evolution. It means that the dynamics of social interaction among strategists become a crucial force shaping emergent patterns of behavioral diversity. Even relatively simple organisms such as insects often employ diverse behavioral strategies for a single activity such as foraging for food. Hav- ing noted such behavioral diversity among organisms in a population, we may reasonably ask, Why do not all the individuals in the population find (evolve) the "best" strategy for doing something and adopt it? Why are populations not "strategically homogeneous" with respect to an activity such as foraging for food? This question is particularly puzzling when two conditions obtain: (a) the individuals in the population are indistinguish- ably equipped for the activity, and (b) these individuals face virtually 3Evolutionary ecologists also identify a third variant of contest asymmetries-what we will term here "circumstantial asymmetries. " Contests may vary for reasons besides ability and need that are not clearly correlated with any apparent difference between the individuals involved but may nevertheless affect the outcome. We will discuss this contest asymmetry in the next section. 472</page><page sequence="9">Crime identical environmental circumstances. Intuitively, it stands to reason that individuals that differ in physical attributes can be expected to adopt different strategies for an activity such as foraging. For example, as predators vary in size, they are likely to evolve different techniques for capturing large prey. Hence, while individual lions are large and strong enough to prey upon zebras, African wild dogs can do so only in packs (Wilson 1975, pp. 509-13). Likewise, we would expect strategic diversity to evolve as a result of exposure to different selective forces. It is curious, however, to discover pronounced strategy diversity even in the absence of such differences. As we shall see, research bears out the intuition that phenotypic differences among individuals significantly influence the kinds of strategies they adopt. Pure and Mixed Strategies Recall the previous example of patrolling as a strategy used by certain bees for acquiring mates. It is plausible that patrolling could have evolved as the only successful strategy for mate acquisition among these bees. Perhaps all previous mutations that produced alternative strategies turned out to be less successful than patrolling and were selected against. Stated differently, patrolling may represent "the one best available" strat- egy for mate acquisition that has evolved to date among C. pallida. The exclusive use of this technique for mate acquisition means that patrolling is a "pure strategy" (Dawkins 1980). Suppose, instead, that a mutation produces a strain of male bees predisposed to hover above patrollers that are searching for females. Assume further that a few excavated females elude the patrollers and fly away. By escaping the patrollers, these fe- males become mating opportunities for the hoverers. Since hoverers need not invest energy in excavating females, they can monitor a number of patrollers for occasional females that escape. Presumably, if the propor- tion of escaped females is sufficiently large and the proportion of hoverers sufficiently small, "hovering" may evolve as an alternative pure strategy to patrolling, as it actually has among C. pallida bees. As a result, behav- ioral diversity has evolved in the C. pallida population because two pure strategies now appear for mate acquisition-patrolling and hovering. The evolution of this new pattern of dual strategies for mate acquisition has important sociological implications. First, it is possible that the popu- lation may attain an equal proportion of patrollers and hoverers. During the initial generations of its evolutionary emergence, hovering may be a more successful reproductive strategy than patrolling. Under such cir- cumstances, hovering is described as a "minority strategy" and carries with it significant advantages (Dawkins 1980, pp. 333-34). For example, when minority strategists are few in number, they face little competition 473</page><page sequence="10">American Journal of Sociology among themselves. Accordingly, the proportion of hoverers in each suc- ceeding population can be expected to grow. After a certain point, how- ever, the hoverer population may become so dense that its rate of repro- ductive success passes a threshold and then declines below that of patrollers. At this point, they have lost the advantages that accrue to minority strategists. Consequently, selection would then favor patrolling, and the proportionate balance of strategists would tip back toward pa- trollers. These dynamics are likely to yield one of two outcomes. Either the patroller/hoverer ratio will oscillate indefinitely, or a stable propor- tion of patrollers to hoverers will evolve (Maynard Smith 1982, pp. 199- 202). Barash describes the former as a "seesaw system" (1982, p. 167). In either case, biologists describe such populations as featuring "mixed strat- egies" (Maynard Smith 1982, pp. 68-93). Mixed-strategy populations occur in one of two forms: (a) subpopula- tions of individuals that specialize in one pure strategy to the exclusion of all others or (b) populations in which every individual employs one strat- egy part of the time, the other strategy the remainder of the time. For instance, the males of population A may be composed of 70% pure pa- trollers and 30% pure hoverers. In population B, 100% of the males patrol an average of 70% of their searching time and hover an average of 30% of the time. An "evolutionary stable state" can be achieved either way, and the two are mathematically, but not behaviorally, indistin- guishable (Dawkins 1980, p. 342).4 Conditional Strategies As it turns out, C. pallida males are conditional rather than mixed strategists because individual males differ in an important RHP trait- size. If the male is larger than its average competitor, it patrols; if it is smaller, it hovers (Dawkins 1980, pp. 343-45). Both patrolling and hov- ering produce mates for males, but they are not equally effective strate- gies. The average patroller enjoys greater reproductive success than the average hoverer. In this case, patrolling is the preferred strategy because of its higher reproductive yield, but hovering is better than nothing. As noted earlier, both mixed and conditional strategies introduce behavioral diversity into a population. 4 A "polymorphic stable equilibrium" results when two kinds of "specialists" evolve, 70% of which are pure patrollers and 30% of which are pure hoverers (Krebs and Davies 1984, p. 34). On the other hand, a "monomorphic stable equilibrium" is at- tained when 100% of the males "generalize," each one patrolling an average of 70% of the time and hovering an average of 30%. In either case, what is stable is the "propor- tionate mix of strategies in the population as a whole" (Dawkins 1980, p. 359). 474</page><page sequence="11">Crime Technically, a conditional strategy is a type of pure strategy, but it is deceptively similar to a mixed strategy. Pure strategists invariably follow but one course of action. Mixed strategists alternate between two (or more) strategies, but either alternative yields the same returns as the other. Neither strategy is preferred. Like mixed strategists, conditional strategists alternate among strategy options, but one strategy option is "preferred" over another because it yields greater returns. A conditional strategy is adopted only when the individual is precluded from employing an alternative, preferred strategy. Four Principles of Behavioral Diversity By viewing organisms as strategists, biologists have significantly ad- vanced our understanding of the evolution of behavioral patterns among animals. Animals do not appear to choose strategies consciously. The new methods of strategy analysis developed by biologists suggest several far- reaching principles that may illuminate the nature of behavioral diversity in social systems in general, regardless of the cognitive abilities of the individuals who compose their populations. First, we now understand that a population composed of pure strategists may be inherently unsta- ble. For example, a population of animals in which all acquire shelter by digging their own burrows may be highly vulnerable to "invasion" by an alternative strategist that is predisposed to enter and occupy a burrow constructed by others (Brockmann, Grafen, and Dawkins 1979). "Enter- ers" may thereby gain advantage over "diggers." As a result, the average enterer may also attain greater fitness than the average digger. Conse- quently, enterer strategies may proliferate in subsequent generations. The relative advantage of entering over digging, however, will decline as the proportion of enterers increases beyond a certain point. This is analogous to an economic point of "marginal utility" beyond which one begins to experience "diminishing returns" on investments (Samuelson 1970, pp. 410-29). The basic argument is that both nonhuman and human populations in which every individual pursues the same strategy are highly susceptible to invasion by an alternative strategist (Dawkins 1976). Because they face less competition, minority strategists enjoy an advan- tage. For these reasons, patterns of behavioral uniformity (homogeneity) are often much less stable than patterns of behavioral diversity (heteroge- neity). In the anthropomorphic vernacular, a population of behavioral "conformists" is ripe for "invasion" by behavioral "nonconformists." In human societies, cognitive abilities may allow individuals to realize quickly the relative potential advantages of nonconforming strategies (some of which violate criminal laws), thereby increasing the motivation 475</page><page sequence="12">American Journal of Sociology to adopt such means. As we shall see, such considerations are critical to our understanding of the pervasiveness of deviance and crime in human populations. Second, behavioral diversity in a population may evolve either because of or in spite of differences among individuals. In general, conditional strategies reflect differences among individuals with respect to their RHP, the value they attach to the contested resource, or both. Such differences may very well compose the basis of a conditional strategy such as, "If smaller than one's opponent, retreat; if larger, fight." On the other hand, mixed strategies may evolve even when individuals are virtually indistin- guishable. The minority strategist benefits simply by being one of a rela- tively small number of individuals that takes the behavioral path less well traveled; the returns are greater because the competition is less intense. In terms of their RHP and the value they attach to contested resources, however, majority and minority strategists in this case may be essentially identical. This implies that multiple strategies do not always derive from individual differences. Rather, the relative frequency with which strate- gies are employed in a population may determine whether an individual adopts an alternative strategy. Mixed-strategy populations reflect the ad- vantages of certain strategy proportions, not necessarily a mix of different types of individuals.5 Properly understood, behavioral diversity results from the occurrence of diverse strategies, regardless of how these strate- gies are distributed among individuals in the population. Third, behavioral diversity may reflect differences in the interactional setting that are independent of RHP or resource value differences. This means that the same individual with the same RHP profile may behave quite differently from one interactive setting to the next. Traits related to RHP are characteristics of individuals, not the circumstances in which they find themselves. For example, a sort of "home-court" advantage may accrue to the occupant of a residence when it is challenged by an intruder. Although the intruder may possess superior RHP traits and "assign" greater value to the contested resource, residency itself may affect moti- vation. To the extent that it often confers a competitive advantage over an intruder, the interloper may relinquish the challenge after "conclud- ing" that such competitive interaction is not worth the effort it might take to secure the goal. As a result, the resident may have a higher probability 5 Recall that a population of mixed strategists may assume either one of two forms: (1) every member of the population alternates between using strategy A with a probability of P and strategy B with a probability of 1 - P, or (2) x% of the population employs pure strategy A and 100 - x% uses pure strategy B. In either case, the population expresses a "mix" of behavioral strategies. In neither case can it be said that the behavioral mix derives from differences among individuals. 476</page><page sequence="13">Crime of winning a contest. These kinds of contests may be asymmetrical not because of individual differences per se but because of the circumstances under which the contest occurs (i.e., circumstantial asymmetries). Fourth, behavioral diversity may emerge in response to opportunities created by patterns of behavioral uniformity. By employing a given strat- egy, an organism may create an opportunity for another to adopt an alternative strategy. For example, animals that adopt a fishing strategy may create an opportunity for other competitors to "steal" their prey. In fact, this practice is so common among a variety of species, such as eagles, that biologists have labeled this strategy "kleptoparasitism" (Han- sen 1986, p. 787). This behavior is just one of a much broader category of behaviors biologists call "social parasitism" (Wilson 1975, pp. 361-77). All such strategies represent behaviors by which some individuals ex- propriate the labor invested by others in productive activities. In this way, some strategies occasion the emergence of others, thereby contribut- ing to behavioral diversity. Our introduction to these concepts from evolutionary biology has been detailed but necessary. Having explicated the evolutionary strategy model for nonhumans, we can now show how it might be extended to the much more complicated behavioral diversity in human populations. Significantly, our theoretical perspective accommodates both planned and unplanned strategies while emphasizing that, unlike other animals, humans, clearly, often plan and adopt strategies consciously. We begin with a minimal assumption about behavior: natural selection produces organisms, including humans, that behave as strategists, each predis- posed to act largely on its own behalf and, sometimes, for its fitness. CRIMINAL EXPROPRIATIVE STRATEGIES Biologically normal organisms living in unexceptional environments of- ten expropriate the labor and resources of other members of their species. Such behaviors need not be viewed as aberrant or pathological. They need not signify biological, psychological, or social structural dysfunc- tions. Rather, they can be understood readily as normal (diverse) behav- ioral strategies. Most acts of expropriation that occur in human popula- tions are probably not the product of genetic selection but are rather the result of strategies employed by motivated persons, often cc-gnitively aware that their behavior violates normative rules. While many species have evolved expropriative behaviors, only humans are capable of crimi- nal expropriative strategies. Human behavior is guided by elaborate codes consisting of rules people often fail to obey. As a result, some behavioral strategies are nonconformist because they entail the violation 477</page><page sequence="14">American Journal of Sociology of a normative code.6 While not all nonconformist strategies are expro- priative, our subsequent analysis will be confined, for illustrative pur- poses, to those nonconformist expropriative strategies that violate a specific set of normative rules-criminal laws. Again, we stress that only humans commit expropriative crime (a subset of nonconformity), but many species employ expropriative behavioral strategies. The theory developed in this article pertains fundamentally to expro- priative behavioral strategies in general. Consequently, the principles discussed herein could be applied to expropriative behaviors that are conformist or nonconformist, legal or criminal. While we have chosen to focus our subsequent analysis specifically on expropriative criminal acts, we wish to make clear that not all crimes, nor all forms of nonconformity, are viewed here as expropriative. The present analysis attempts to ex- plain those nonviolent and violent expropriative crimes that yield mate- rial or symbolically valued resources (be they goods or services), regard- less of whether they are committed for the benefit of the individual criminal or an organization or group. As such, the vast majority of ex- propriative acts to be explained herein are classified as property crimes. However, Daly and Wilson (1988) have demonstrated recently the usefulness of an evolutionary theoretical perspective for explaining vio- lent acts employed as strategies in pursuit of less tangible, but sometimes equally valued, social resources such as status, power, respect, honor, face, equity, and vengeance. Crime has been of long-standing interest to social scientists, and it provides a distinct sphere of human behavior to which we may now direct our attention. Our specific goal is to explain expropriative forms of crime as constitutive properties of normally func- tioning social systems. We do not deny the possible role of "dysfunc- tional" factors in producing certain kinds of crime. Rather, we explain how many varieties of crime derive from the very nature of social organi- zation and behavior itself. We embrace some of, but not all, the behavioral assumptions shared by evolutionary theorists from whose ideas our perspective is developed. First, we assume that individuals are predisposed (not rigidly determined) to act on behalf of their perceived interests (Lopreato 1984, pp. 104-50). These interests may coincide with those of others as well, such as family, community, ethnic and religious groups, or nation-state. Consequently, it is not inconsistent to predict that individuals may behave cooperatively or even altruistically toward their peers in these groups. Second, as stated above, we assume that individuals acquire and transmit behavioral strat- egies largely through personal and social learning rather than through 6 Most of the acts described herein as nonconformist are forms of behavior that Merton (1938) referred to as innovative deviance. 478</page><page sequence="15">Crime genetic processes. Human beings, because of their superior intelligence and cognitive abilities, often consciously and purposely choose strategies. Unlike many economists, however, we need not assume that individuals rationally calculate in order to select the best strategy. They may instead opt for a strategy that has proved useful previously or that they imitated from others in similar situations. It is thus unnecessary to assume that criminal acts are perpetrated by rational, calculating individuals who understand fully the strategic implications of their chosen actions. These strategies may bestow advantages on these individuals whether they are fully intended and recognized or not (Merton 1957, pp. 19-82). What works well for the successful actor is likely to be tried again. Since strate- gies are selectively retained and transmitted because of their conse- quences, it is useful to think of this process as "strategy selection." In addition, new strategies may develop periodically as random variations of old strategies. Among humans, advantage-enhancing strategies are typi- cally culturally transmitted and thereby proliferate throughout popula- tions and across generations. Third, the likely success of a particular strategy depends greatly upon two factors: (a) the relative frequency with which it is employed by others in a population (minority strategists often excel), and (b) the types of alternative strategies against which it must compete. Fourth, the extent and distribution of strategy diversity (both within and across areas) can be explained largely as a function of varia- tion in resource value, RHP, and circumstantial asymmetries (e.g., "resi- dent" vs. "intruder"). By approaching expropriative crime as would a naturalist, we can interpret such acts as products of the same behavioral dynamics responsible for creating other kinds of behavioral diversity. Factors Promoting Expropriative Strategies 1. Opportunities afforded by pure conformist systems. -Imagine a hu- man population in which subsistence needs are met with a pure strategy called "production." Production is the investment of labor, aided by tech- nology, for the appropriation of natural resources that are modified for human consumption and use. It includes, for example, activities normally described as planting, harvesting, gathering, hunting, manufacturing, and building. In principle, it is possible to imagine a population of "pure producer" strategists. Such a behavioral system, however, is likely to be inherently unstable because we can expect a system of pure producers to be invaded eventually by a self-enhancing alternative strategist that we call an "expropriator." Expropriative acts can be seen as subsistence- strategy alternatives to production. Why is a population of pure strategists highly vulnerable to invasion by a self-enhancing alternative strategist? Because of the dynamics of fre- 479</page><page sequence="16">American Journal of Sociology quency-dependent selection, considerable advantage often accrues to the criminally motivated "minority strategist." For example, a population of pure producer strategists offers rich opportunities to a single theft strate- gist. As criminal opportunity theorists have noted, a certain level of criminal activity is enabled simply by the opportunities created by routine activities of people (Cohen and Felson 1979; Hindelang, Gottfredson, and Garofalo 1978). Once "invented," a theft strategy may proliferate throughout the population. It may be acquired by other strategists through imitation, social learning, or independent discovery. Further- more, the strategy may be transmitted intergenerationally through the mechanisms of socialization. Once discovered, a theft strategy is likely to diffuse, creating a mixed-strategy population composed of producer (non- criminal) and expropriative (criminal) strategists. Remember, a mixed- strategy population occurs in either of two forms: a population may con- tain both pure producers and pure expropriators. Alternatively, these strategies may be distributed throughout the population such that every individual is a part-time expropriator. In either case, a mixed-strategy system emerges because of the advantages inherent in minority strate- gies.' A population of pure strategists is an open invitation to any strategy innovator. Often, as frequency-dependent selection implies, an inverse relationship obtains between the proportion of individuals adopting a minority strategy and the rate of return accompanying that strategy. The rare alternative strategist is often difficult to detect and recognize as an exploiter. If the population of producers is sufficiently large, the minority strategist can exploit many victims, thereby making surveillance and guardianship more difficult.8 Criminal opportunities that involve low surveillance and guardianship constitute circumstantial asymmetries if uncorrelated with real differences in RHP and resource value. If com- munication among producers is limited and episodic, knowledge about the criminal exploiter is less likely to diffuse. This is precisely the situa- tion in which theft and fraud as minority strategies are most likely to prosper. Hence, large-scale concentrations of producers offer rich and 7 In the present instance, it would be difficult to prove that any combination of producer and expropriator strategists among humans is a true mixed-strategy system, with each strategy yielding equal benefits (as measured in fitness units). Since it is virtually impossible to measure the relevant parameters that would allow us to assess the relative returns in units of advantage enjoyed by producers and expropriators, it is not reasonable to claim that any particular producer/expropriator ratio represents a true mixed-strategy system. 8 "Guardianship" is defined as the effectiveness of persons (e.g., family members, neighbors, pedestrians, private security guards, law-enforcement officers) or objects (e.g., burglar alarms, locks, barred windows) in preventing expropriative acts from occurring, either by their presence alone or by some sort of direct action. 480</page><page sequence="17">Crime inviting opportunities to the minority expropriative strategist. For the moment, we shall not speculate about the possible psychological effects of such ecological and demographic contexts on the motivation to commit crimes. Nor do we imply that expropriation necessarily follows from such a setting. Rather, we simply note that the presence of rich criminal oppor- tunities helps meet a fundamental precondition for the high incidence of crime in populations of pure strategists (for an illustration of this princi- ple, see Cohen and Felson [1979]; Cohen, Felson, and Land [1980]; Co- hen, Kluegel, and Land [1981]). A simple but important conclusion can be drawn from our account of pure strategy system dynamics: populations composed of pure producers are likely to be rare and ephemeral. Because pure strategy systems invite invasion by opportunistic alternative strategists, behavioral diversity in the form of populations composed of both producer and expropriator strategists should be the expected rule, not the exception. In this way, crime can be said to be "normal" in populations (Durkheim 1938). Why is crime normal? The answer is to be found in the fundamental dynamics out of which patterns of behavioral diversity emerge in populations of interacting individuals. 2. RHP asymmetries. -An individual's RHP traits are characteris- tics-biological, psychological, or social-that affect the probability that an organism will procure a valued resource. As noted earlier, the same RHP traits are not equally relevant in all situations. While size may be relevant to a contest over territorial control, physical attractiveness may be the primary determinant of mate attraction. Multiple other factors often contribute to the probability that an individual will appropriate a desired resource. Most notably, these include various circumstantial fac- tors, such as the particular setting in which a contested resource is pur- sued. For example, remember that residents often enjoy an advantage over intruders. Asymmetries in RHP are especially important sources of behavioral diversity because they contribute to the rise of conditional strategies. Among animals, size, strength, and experience are important traits determining the likelihood that an individual will adopt one rather than another strategy. Among humans, social and psychological as well as physical differences create important RHP asymmetries. Strain theo- rists and Marxists (as well as other conflict theorists) point out, for ex- ample, that the unequal distribution of resources in populations contrib- utes to the production of crime (Merton 1938; Cohen 1955; Cloward and Ohlin 1960; Gordon 1971; Chambliss and Seidman 1982; Quinney 1980; Greenberg 1981). In the vernacular of evolutionary ecology, these theo- rists regard most criminals as conditional strategists who suffer RHP deficiencies such as poverty or the lack of formal education. Many RHP deficiencies, in turn, derive largely from class stratification. In this view, 481</page><page sequence="18">American Journal of Sociology most expropriative criminal acts represent the efforts of individuals who are trying to "make the best of the bad job" of occupying a subordinate class position, which itself is characterized by RHP deficiency (Dawkins 1980). The distribution of both "ascribed" and "achieved" RHP traits and their relationship to crime has been a major focus of investigation by social scientists. For example, many studies correlate expropriative street crimes with various racial and socioeconomic attributes (see, e.g., Hin- delang 1978, 1981; Braithwaite 1979, 1981; Thompson et al. 1981; Elliot and Ageton 1980; Wolfgang, Figlio, and Sellin 1972). These studies gen- erally find that rates of expropriative street crime are highest among economically and socially disadvantaged groups. Upon first consideration, one might assume that RHP deficiencies are the major reason for an individual to adopt the expropriative option of a conditional strategy. The guiding behavioral algorithm might be, "If poor, of minority status, undereducated, and unemployed or underem- ployed, steal to meet one's needs." On the other hand, an individual who is rich in RHP traits may be even more predisposed to commit a criminal act precisely because he or she commands the resources required to imple- ment an expropriative strategy successfully. Alternatively stated, those strong in RHP traits often have greater opportunities to expropriate valued resources from others, and they may act accordingly. This insight was first developed systematically by Sutherland (1949) when he coined the term and explored the phenomenon of "white-collar crime." At the same time, not all individuals with RHP deficiencies adopt expropriative criminal strategies. In and of themselves, RHP deficiences do not preordain criminality. Instead, they make such a choice more likely when need satisfaction is the goal and resources are limited. Ac- cording to many criminologists and behaviorists, learning resulting from patterns of socialization and conditioning may modify (or enhance) the choice of both productive and expropriative strategies in various situa- tional contexts. Many scholars believe that these learning processes largely determine which citizens in the population are the strongest candi- dates to adopt criminal strategies, regardless of their class positions. Most experts agree that the socially and economically disadvantaged are, other things being equal, more likely to be exposed to patterns of socialization and reinforcement that lead to the adoption of criminal strategies (Suther- land 1939; Miller 1958; Wilson and Herrnstein 1985; Akers 1985). Because considerable attention has been directed recently to the age- graded crime curve (Hirschi and Gottfredson 1983; Greenberg 1985; Co- hen and Land 1987), several observations need to be made regarding age as an RHP factor that affects the probability of adopting expropriative criminal strategies. It is well established that age is a "prime predictor" of 482</page><page sequence="19">Crime crime that follows a more or less typical pattern (see, e.g., Hirschi and Gottfredson 1983; Wilson and Herrnstein 1985, pp. 126-47). The form of the age distribution of crime entails (a) a rapid rise in the relative fre- quency of criminal acts through the teen years, (b) a peak around age 20, and (c) a decline through the adult ages (which is less rapid than the teenage buildup) to very low levels at age 65 and over. While a number of competing hypotheses have been offered to account for the age-graded crime curve, it is interesting to note that, although "all significant crime categories" show a pattern of an "early peak and a subsequent decline," crimes requiring physical vigor peak early and de- cline quickly relative to "physically passive" ones (Wilson and Herrnstein 1985, p. 144). It is true that many cultural and psychological factors may contribute to this pattern. But this distribution derives fundamentally from deficiencies in RHP traits among the young. Wilson and Herrnstein (1985, p. 146) capture nicely the insight that young people are both rich and deficient in RHP traits conducive to crime: "Given energy, strength, potent new sources of drive but few legitimate means of consummation, a lack of economic and social skills and peers who are similarly vigorous and frustrated, the adolescent years are destined to foster a rise in delin- quency. " While such traits compose an RHP profile that would equip one perfectly to commit crimes requiring physical prowess, they do little to assist one to embezzle or engage in tax fraud even if the opportunities were available. The absence of full social and economic enfranchisement among the young means that they will be deficient in certain RHP traits available to adults. Consequently, it is not surprising that the young are often more likely than others to behave as conditional strategists and adopt an expropriative criminal or delinquent strategy. As Dawkins (1980) might say, they are simply "making the best of the bad job" of being an adolescent. Since age, embedded in its social context, is a major determinant of other RHP traits, it is not surprising that it often predisposes individuals to behave as conditional strategists. Likewise, since so many RHP traits are often age related, we can expect the life cycle alone to influence strongly the probability that an individual will adopt an expropriative criminal strategy at any particular age. This means that the distribution of criminal expropriative strategies in a population is very likely to reflect the age composition of that population because age is a significant deter- minant of the distribution of many RHP traits. In addition to age, the relationship between gender and crime is exam- ined in a vast literature. By all accounts, male participation in these behaviors greatly exceeds that of females in all known societies, but the gender gap has apparently narrowed slightly in recent years in the United States, at least for property crime (see Nettler 1984, pp. 105-10; Wilson 483</page><page sequence="20">American Journal of Sociology and Herrnstein 1985, pp. 104-25). Research also indicates that those factors said to contribute to criminality among females are the very same ones that are associated with these behaviors among males. For example, Crites's (1976) review of the literature on gender and crime establishes that female offenders are typically of low socioeconomic status, poorly educated, under- or unemployed, disproportionately from minority groups, and often have dependents who rely on them for economic sup- port. Except for the important difference that they are much more likely to have dependent children living with them, female offenders appear to be identical with their male counterparts in their low RHP profiles. The task before us now is to explain why females in general are less apt to engage in expropriative crime than males even though they possess lower RHP, and why rates of property crime among females appear to have increased in recent years compared with earlier periods. While many explanations have been offered to account for differential rates of crime by sex, our consideration of the accumulated evidence leads us to conclude that the aggregate differences in these behaviors are best explained through the interaction of both sex-role and biologically based differences. This view stresses that the greater rate of male participation in illegal expropriative activities results from societies' encouraging and reinforcing both aggressive and risk-taking behavior more among males than females, but this process is not altogether independent of genetic differences between the sexes. If society systematically conditions and socializes males to act aggressively and to take risks that, in turn, lead to a higher rate of male participation in crime, the resulting difference is rooted in a cultural response to biological differences. The relationship between gender and behavioral differences is quite complex. In regard to our specific interests, research indicates that ag- gressiveness has been found to covary consistently with male crime, and this trait is stronger among males than females for reasons that are not altogether explained by culture (Wilson and Herrnstein 1985, p. 117). For example, Maccoby and Jacklin (1974, pp. 242-43) have determined that males are more aggressive than females in all societies for which there are data, even though aggression is largely learned. Furthermore, these gen- der differences in aggression establish themselves early in life, perhaps before differential socialization processes take hold. The most commonly invoked explanation for gender differences in aggression beyond sex-role conditioning and socialization is the presence of androgens (male hor- mones). As Wilson and Herrnstein (1985, p. 119) point out, however, androgens have been more consistently tied to higher activity levels in general than to aggression per se. Only "pathologically" atypical hormone levels have been found to correlate substantially with the increased prob- ability of aggressive criminal behavior among males. 484</page><page sequence="21">Crime Whether differences in rates of aggression between males and females can be tied to hormonal differences independent of the physical factors of size and strength is controversial. As Jencks (1987, p. 34) has recently noted: "Cultural support for the prevalence of male rather than female aggressiveness is so nearly universal that it could hardly have arisen simply by chance. If male aggression and violence are not just historical accidents, they must be directly or indirectly attributable to genetic differ- ences between the sexes." We argue here for indirect effects and stress that genetic influences on behavioral differences in rates of expropriative crime between the sexes are strongly mediated by the social contexts in which they are found. Biological differences alone, then, fail to account for the observed dif- ferences in crime between the sexes, nor can they explain the apparent recent increases in property crime by females. At the same time, strictly cultural explanations of sex differences in crime fall short because they neglect apparent indirect biological contributions to these behavioral pat- terns. Attesting to the necessity for acknowledging that both biological and sex-role differences interact to contribute to gender differences in rates of crime is the lack of empirical support for the claims of scholars who contend that sex-role differences are arbitrary. For example, some have suggested that a narrowing of differences between these roles will increase opportunities for females, leading to a convergence in crime rates between the sexes, and that this phenomenon is responsible for the re- cently reported increases in female crime (see, e.g., Simon 1975; Adler 1975). As Wilson and Herrnstein (1985, p. 124) demonstrate, however, most of the increase in categories of female crime in the past two decades is not associated with rising status in the job market. Indeed, most of the increase in female participation in crime has occurred in property offenses associated with low status and poverty. These crimes are most likely to be perpetrated by lower-class women living on limited incomes with limited job opportunities. In other words, these are precisely the women with the lowest RHP, for whom expropriative criminal acts provide an alternative behavioral strategy. Historically, many women have been deprived of RHP traits such as formal education or high occupational status that give them legitimate access to valued resources. Therefore, we might expect this RHP defi- ciency to predispose women to behave as conditional strategists and adopt criminal expropriative strategies. Ironically, however, women ap- pear to suffer a "double jeopardy" effect regarding RHP deficiency. To wit, they are also apparently less inclined, relative to males, both to behave aggressively and to take risks (Jencks 1987). Both aggressiveness and risk taking are RHP traits often enabling individuals to adopt and execute successfully expropriative criminal strategies. The propensities 485</page><page sequence="22">American Journal of Sociology both to behave aggressively and to take risks, although they may be independent of one another, are transmitted culturally through socializa- tion and conditioning. Since society transmits these traits disproportion- ately to men, biological differences contribute to male-female differences but only indirectly. At the same time, women with low RHP may be more likely to engage in property crime now, relative to earlier periods, because of what has been recently termed the "feminization of poverty." We have said that, relative to male offenders, a greater proportion of recent female offenders have dependent children for whom they are the primary means of support. Recent increases in single-parent households headed by women may have increased the incidence or prevalence of certain prop- erty crimes among "marginal women living on fixed incomes" who have limited economic and perhaps social resources and who have families to support (Wilson and Herrnstein 1985, p. 124). One may argue that, among at least some of these women, the forces that influence the individ- ual to provide for the needs of her dependents and herself are stronger than the forces that restrain her from taking illegal actions. In addition to age and gender, Wilson and Herrnstein identify intelli- gence as a constitutional factor related to crime. They cite literature documenting an appreciable heritable component to intelligence as con- ceptualized and measured by standardized IQ tests (1985, pp. 148-72). They conclude from this evidence that intelligence is inversely related to the probability of engaging in a crime. Granting for the moment the defensibility of arguing the heritability of intelligence (or whatever IQ tests measure), we are still far from claiming that biological factors cause crime. Nevertheless, we can incorporate the reported correlations be- tween such scores and criminal behavior meaningfully into an evolution- ary ecological perspective without falling victim to naive biological deter- minism. To the extent that constitutional traits identified by Wilson and Herrn- stein (1985) such as low IQ, depressed arousal level, poor conditionabil- ity, volatile temperament, impulsiveness, or high anxiety level reflect heritable differences, their influence on criminal behavior is indirect. That is, such traits help compose actors' RHP and thereby alter the probability that they will adopt one or another strategy alternative. For example, a highly impulsive but less intelligent person may be less likely to acquire or perfect preferred (conformist) strategy options through per- sonal learning or cultural transmission. Sociocultural attributes such as educational and occupational status, for example, are crucial RHP traits in many societies, and the inability to acquire them may motivate an individual to adopt criminal strategies in order to maximize advantage. It is not that biologically based qualities translate directly into criminality but rather that they contribute to a person's overall RHP profile. Other 486</page><page sequence="23">Crime biologically based traits also act as "enabling devices" whereby the proba- bility increases that one can readily obtain advantages by adopting ex- propriative criminal strategies. For example, qualities such as size, strength, speed, mesomorphic build, and impulsiveness may well raise the probability that one will use force and other illegal means to pursue desired ends. If another person lacks the same RHP traits, then the probability of adopting such expropriative strategies declines. It is in ways such as these that heritable attributes may alter the proba- bility of adopting particular strategy options. In this restricted sense, one may argue that certain forms of crime are related to constitutional traits. Nevertheless, this sort of explanation is significantly at variance with the biological image of crime as pathology. One may simply note that biolo- gy's contribution to strategy adoption is mediated by RHP traits that acquire meaning only in some particular sociocultural context. For ex- ample, the same RHP traits enabling strategies that are labeled as violent criminality in one context may be lauded as heroic when turned against those attempting to perpetrate violent acts in another. The person who foils a robbery by wresting the gun from an assailant, and in so doing injures the criminal, will more likely be named "citizen of the month" than sent to prison, even though the same RHP traits may have in- fluenced the selection of both criminal and "heroic" strategies. 3. Resource value asymmetry. -Although they are of substantial im- portance, ethnic, class, age, and gender stratification systems are not the exclusive sources of RHP asymmetries in a population. Physical or men- tal qualities such as size, strength, or psychological aptitudes may also create RHP asymmetry independently of the structure and functioning of stratification systems. In addition to the inherent vulnerability of pure strategy systems and RHP asymmetries, a third factor may contribute to the adoption of expropriative strategies. Asymmetries in resource value often result in adoption of a conditional strategy; RHP superiority is not always, in and of itself, the best predictor of contested outcomes. For example, as previously stated, despite its inferior RHP, a smaller, more highly motivated individual may win a physical contest with a larger one. If the larger contestant has less need of the contested resource, he may simply not value an item as highly as his smaller but needier opponent. Asymmetries of resource value may also be reflected in the energy that one has expended in constructing a shelter or rearing offspring. That is, the investment of work or raw material may enhance the value of a contested resource. The idea of resource value asymmetry is also important because it implies an acknowledgment of individual differences in motivations to employ criminal strategies to accomplish goals. For humans, the value of a contested resource is determined by a wide range of factors, including 487</page><page sequence="24">American Journal of Sociology personal history, various status attributes, and cultural meanings. For example, while resource value is often highly idiosyncratic and difficult to specify before a person's behavioral investments, it remains a potentially important factor predisposing individuals to adopt strategies, criminal or noncriminal. This point has been discussed at length by strain theorists, who note that, if prevented from employing socially approved means for achieving culturally valued goals, highly motivated persons may adopt alternative, nonconformist strategies (Merton 1938; Cloward and Ohlin 1960). This insight corresponds to an evolutionary ecological principle that asymmetries of resource value influence the probability that an indi- vidual will adopt one or another strategy alternative. Hence, resource value asymmetry must be considered a potential contributor to the prob- able occurrence and successful completion of many expropriative crimi- nal acts. HOW EXPROPRIATIVE STRATEGIES ARE ACQUIRED The mechanisms by which organisms, including humans, acquire strate- gies vary, and there is danger of misunderstanding our evolutionary ecological perspective on this point. Consequently, we must proceed cau- tiously. We can distinguish three types of strategies by how they are acquired. First, genetic strategies are transmitted through genetic inher- itance. Second, developmental strategies are acquired by personal experi- ence, including various forms of learning such as operant and classical conditioning (Skinner 1938), invention, and innovation (Lenski and Lenski 1978). Third, cultural strategies are acquired through various processes of communication and social learning, including imitation and socialization (Boyd and Richerson 1985). Among humans, much of this social learning is mediated by symbols.9 These three types of strategy transmission sometimes overlap. Nevertheless, it is useful to abstract and isolate each. Among simpler organisms such as insects and other invertebrates, ge- netic strategies are of primary importance. Many of the insects' strategy options are closely prescribed behavior patterns that are genetically "hard-wired" into the nervous system. Although there is less room for developmental modification of these strategies than there is among verte- brates, successful strategy employment requires much more learning than is often recognized (Bonner 1980). Cultural strategies are virtually nonex- 9 By the processes of communication and social learning, we mean to emphasize the importance of language and symbolic interaction, which allow humans to go beyond learning by the rather passive adaptation to reinforcement. Language allows individ- uals to produce social selves and participate actively in shared cultures (see, e.g., Corsaro 1985). 488</page><page sequence="25">Crime istent among invertebrates. On the other hand, many vertebrates acquire strategies through developmental processes guided by the underlying ge- netic "blueprint" for behavior. In this case, strategy acquisition depends on the animal's experience in a particular environmental context. Genes themselves, however, do not specify complex behavior patterns. Again, we do not mean to imply that these strategies are consciously chosen by an animal that recognizes and evaluates the various costs and benefits attending each strategy alternative. Rather, "strategy selection" occurs whereby particular strategies are retained because the animal benefits from them, consciously or not. Such selection functions during the life of the animal through various forms of learning, not the least important of which is associative learning (Skinner 1938). An interesting example of an individual acquiring a rather complex strategy is the chimpanzee that inadvertently ascended to the top of the dominance hierarchy in which it had previously had a much lower status (Goodall 1986). This occurred because the chimp accidentally discovered how to make noises frightening to other chimps by banging empty metal gasoline cans. Having learned to make these noises, the chimp acquired a powerful, new RHP trait that propelled it up the dominance hierarchy. We do not have to assume that intentions, plans, or purposive actions of any sort guided the chimp's adoption of this very useful dominance strat- egy. Instead, this developmental strategy process functioned as a chance "mutation," endowing the organism with a useful new RHP quality. Finally, social learning is a particularly important mechanism of trait acquisition among human beings. Even in the case of cultural transmis- sion, we can argue that individuals may benefit by adopting an advanta- geous or even adaptive strategy without being at all aware of the "wis- dom" of their act. At the same time, humans are often capable of ascer- taining the link between a strategy and its benefits (Merton 1957, pp. 19-82). The manner in which criminal techniques, values, attitudes, and beliefs are culturally transmitted through social learning is a major theme of contemporary criminology and does not require elaboration here. (For excellent summaries of these processes, see Hirschi [1969], Kornhauser [1978], Nettler [1984], Akers [1985], and Vold and Bernard [1986].) It is important to distinguish genetic strategies from developmental and cultural strategies in order to avoid confusion about the nature of genetic and social inheritance during strategy transmission. This is especially true when we characterize certain types of crime as nonconformist expropria- tive strategies from which individuals may benefit. We state emphatically that we are not positing a gene or set of genes "for crime." As has been well established by decades of social science research, criminal strategies among humans are best understood as products of development or socio- cultural transmission. For humans, one of the most successful ways of 489</page><page sequence="26">American Journal of Sociology acquiring a criminal strategy is to learn it from others, and a voluminous literature (cited and discussed in the sources listed directly above) docu- ments the findings of research conducted to specify the particular social processes involved. Strategy alternatives are transmitted through various social "conduits," and many of the mechanisms involved in this transmis- sion have been identified by learning theorists (see Akers [1985] for a summary of this research). Because humans rely more heavily on cultural strategies than do other species, it might be said that human populations are unrivaled in the speed and thoroughness with which new strategies can proliferate. This includes the rapid diffusion of novel strategies for crime. The rate at which developmental strategies emerge is much slower because they depend on individual learning. Genetic strategies are the slowest of all to emerge because they require the intergenerational trans- mission of information through reproduction, and this slows drastically both the rate and extensiveness of strategy proliferation. The evolutionary ecological view of strategy acquisition presented here is both general and flexible enough to acknowledge the variety of media through which strategies are transmitted. It is in no way a perspective of "genetic reductionism." On the contrary, it recognizes that genes are but blueprints for the design and assembly of the machinery of behavior-the nervous and endocrine systems, for example. Genes themselves are not the direct, proximate mechanisms that trigger neuromotor activity that yields overt behavior (Konner 1982, pp. 186-87). And yet we have noted that genes very closely prescribe the behavioral strategies displayed by simpler organisms such as insects. Is this not inconsistent? The key to understanding the "link between genes and be- havior" is to be found in what both psychologists and biologists call "biased learning" (Lumsden and Wilson 1981, pp. 53-98). Genes direct the assembly of sensorimotor systems that are predisposed to developing a limited range of behavior possibilities, called the "norm of reaction" (Wil- son 1975). This range is determined by the organism's developmental history and sensorimotor capabilities. Not surprisingly, the range of be- haviors made possible by the norm of reaction varies enormously across species. In simplest terms, organisms such as an insect are biologically prepared to learn a relatively small range of behavioral options. For this reason, one can speak of its having behavioral strategies that are largely "prefabricated" and encoded in its genome (the individual's total array of genes). For example, while an individual ant's behavioral repertoire emerges through development and environmental input, it is much less flexible than that of a human. The norm of reaction among humans is so broad as to satisfy many social scientists that the gene's power of behav- ioral specification has been virtually swamped by culture. Our goal here is not to address the so-called nature/nurture debate. 490</page><page sequence="27">Crime Instead, we want to identify the basic mechanisms by which strategies that vary across species are transmitted and acquired and to demonstrate that our evolutionary ecological approach to behavioral diversity seeks to emphasize rather than to obscure this variation. At the same time, by acknowledging the diverse mechanisms of strategy transmission, we ex- tend the applicability of this approach to behavioral diversity far beyond the scope of genetically transmitted strategies themselves. In other words, we are broadening the evolutionary perspective to include strategy evolu- tion that is based on an information medium other than DNA. Funda- mentally, the constituent processes and mechanisms of evolution need not be restricted to genes as the only information base on which evolution proceeds. In principle, the key processes of evolution (replication, varia- tion, selection, transmission) could be based on another information me- dium such as symbols. Therefore, culturally mediated behavioral strate- gies genuinely evolve; they are not merely analogues to strategies that evolve on a DNA base. As such, the general theory of strategy evolution is a genuine theory of evolution, not an analogy. In all likelihood, organic evolution is simply one expression of more general evolutionary dynamics that can be organized by a variety of informational media (Dawkins 1982). COUNTERSTRATEGY DYNAMICS Among the various nonconformist strategies often prohibited by norma- tive codes are those we have called "expropriative strategies." Recall that expropriation is defined as any behavior whereby one individual usurps resources that another individual has produced or appropriated. Again, organisms may make a living either by producing or by expropriating the labor, resources, and products of others. 10 Both production and expropri- ation can be solitary or group activities, depending on the species or the environment. Those crimes to obtain goods and services from others are examples of nonconformist expropriative strategies. Expropriation may occur in both mixed and conditional strategy systems. Among both hu- mans and other species, the emergence of expropriation may elicit counterstrategy responses. Thus, a positive feedback system may be inau- gurated that is very similar to the selective process that typifies predator- prey coevolution. For example, the selection for faster prey acts as a selective force favoring faster predators, which in turn favors the selec- tion of faster prey, and so on. 10 Among the various strategies by which organisms may acquire resources, the pro- ducer and expropriator strategies are of direct interest to us. There are, of course, other possible strategies by which organisms may acquire resources, such as being the recipi- ent of gifts. 491</page><page sequence="28">American Journal of Sociology It may very well be meaningless to ask at what point a cycle "begins" and to try to determine which strategist is the expropriator and which is the victim. Consider the following example: Deficient in RHP traits that enable a person to "earn an honest living" by producing, an individual may behave as a conditional strategist and resort to theft. As a defensive response, the producer adopts measures to deter theft by enjoining the resources of law-enforcement agencies, moral codes, surveillance activ- ity, new technology, and so on. This occasions the development of more creative and even shrewder theft strategies by those inclined to employ such alternatives. Assuming that the RHP deficiency suffered by the prospective expropriator is derived from his low status in a stratification hierarchy, the question arises, Was the initial adoption of a theft strategy a response to expropriation by others well endowed in RHP traits because of their privileged positions in a stratification hierarchy? If so, Who is the original expropriator? Upon closer inspection, the distinction between expropriator and victim blurs. Perhaps it can be specified only arbitrarily, in a given normative code. In fact, the normative code itself may be an RHP-enhancing trait for one or the other party (a critical assumption of labeling theory). It is possible that those rich in RHP traits may have the privilege of prescribing or interpreting normative codes such as law. Correspondingly, the very power to specify normatively unacceptable behavior is itself a valuable RHP trait. The protracted debate, between "consensus" theorists and Marxist and other "conflict" theorists, over which group is the exploiter and which is the exploited cannot be settled here. For the present, this brief glimpse into coevolutionary dynamics suggests the complex sociological processes composing strategy emer- gence and evolution. It helps make explicit the interactive ties linking each strategist to others in the population. Dawkins (1982) and Maynard Smith (1982) examine these dynamics and suggest that they can be mod- eled formally when the relevant parameters can be specified and mea- sured. In evolutionary terms, such cyclical processes are referred to as "arms races" (Dawkins 1982). Careful attention to the kinds of interactions composing an arms race in this broad sense helps provide important clues about the evolution of behavioral diversity, including variable rates of crime. It is useful to think of populations as composed of various combinations and frequen- cies of strategy types, rather than of individuals, the unit of analysis favored by Wilson and Herrnstein's approach to the study of the causes of crime. This better enables us to understand how the properties of a particular strategy influence the probability that it will succeed or fail when pitted against other kinds of strategies in various combinations and proportions. Consequently, we are able to take a step toward specifying the relative advantage of a particular strategy in a given social context, 492</page><page sequence="29">Crime independent of differences among individuals with respect to their ability or propensity to execute this choice. A close analogy is found in computer chess tournaments, where identical machines ("individuals") compete when programmed with different routines and subroutines ("strategies"). Such contest outcomes are better understood as strategy selection rather than individual selection (Dawkins 1982, pp. 118-32), the level at which most biologists assume that natural selection operates. That is, the real contest winners and losers in computer chess tournaments are various programs, not the hardware of the machines themselves. Strategies, "housed" in and enacted by the opponents (living or nonliving), compete and are differentially selected, not the individual strategists themselves. Dawkins, for example, portrays evolution by natural selection as a saga of contests among behavioral strategies that are dictated by genes or, in principle, any other "replicator" (1976, 1982). As suggested earlier, the idea of "strategy selection" puts the study of behavioral diversity, especially production and expropriation, in an al- together new analytical light. On the one hand, it retains the valuable premise that individuals are always the units of behavior in any social system; thus, individuals enact strategies. On the other hand, it allows us to analyze populations in terms of the strategy differences involved and not fall prey to the error of trying to infer "system-level" behavioral dynamics from individual traits. Analyzing populations in terms of their behavioral strategy dynamics is more "sociological" and more promising than approaches devoted to individual differences such as that advocated by Wilson and Herrnstein (1985). Much of the work of criminological deterrence theorists (e.g., Becker 1968) is relevant here. In evolutionary ecological terms, deterrence (the failure to engage in a criminal act that one otherwise would perpetrate because of the fear of being caught and punished) is often based on the display (or advertisement) of one's RHP (and all that implies) so as to reduce the probability of being the target of another's expropriative strat- egy. Often before they escalate a mutual threat confrontation into a full- fledged fight, competitors "assess" each other's RHP (Maynard Smith 1982). This means that each individual "cues" selectively on certain key traits that signify the other's RHP. These may be physical cues such as size or behavioral cues such as threat displays. These competitors then behave as conditional strategists: "If alter measures superior to ego in RHP, defer; if ego is perceived as superior to alter, escalate the chal- lenge. " It is apparent that such a system would favor individuals who can deceive others about their "true" RHP. Accordingly, we may observe the evolution of a rich variety of physical enhancements and behavioral em- bellishments that exaggerate an organism's RHP. Better yet, if one can 493</page><page sequence="30">American Journal of Sociology |Sociocultural | Resource | / Factors \\Asymmetries Developmental Holding Strategy Expropriative fl Factors \ / \ Potential Selection Crime / / ~~~~~~Asymmetries/ \+ Constitutio'nal &lt; p Expropriative Counter- Fctonstttoa Criminal Strategy Opportunities Selection FIG. 1. -Causal model of evolutionary ecological approach to expropriative crime. embellish one's RHP without actually having to allocate resources to defense, higher returns will be forthcoming. Simultaneously, advantage accrues to the aspiring expropriator that is capable of distinguishing ad- vertised versus actual RHP and acting accordingly. Figure 1 is a causal diagram intended to help the reader to understand better the interrelationships among the concepts employed in our theoreti- cal model. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS More than other organisms, humans are endowed with cognitive abili- ties enabling purposeful behavior, intentionality, planning, and rational choice. Therefore, treating them as strategists requires more subtle con- ceptualization. Nevertheless, as we have shown, the basic evolutionary processes that yield behavioral strategies among simple organisms are still at work among humans. It is just that many human strategies are cultur- ally based, organized, and transmitted. By conventional sociological and evolutionary reasoning, we have explained how routine social interac- tions typically yield patterns of behavioral diversity in populations. Sim- ply put, we can expect individuals to employ criminal strategies under the same conditions that introduce mixed or conditional strategies into popu- lations. As explained earlier, a true mixed-strategy system is one in which alternative strategies may be used with equal success. In some circum- 494</page><page sequence="31">Crime stances, there may be no reason for persons to prefer either an expropria- tive or a productive behavioral option. As a minority strategy option, expropriation may serve the interests of those who adopt it equally well. If guardianship or surveillance is perceived to be minimal and the risks of being detected and apprehended appear sufficiently low, there may be no reason to favor production over expropriation. More often, production and expropriation do not have indistinguish- able potential benefits or costs. In some cases, expropriation may be preferred because it promises greater potential returns with fewer costs than does production. In other cases, expropriation entails small potential returns and a threat of greater costs; even so, it may represent a "better than nothing" behavioral choice. In circumstances like these, many crimi- nal behaviors are conditional strategies. The probability that an individ- ual will adopt this or that conditional strategy in any given situation depends upon his RHP in the context of relative strategy availability, resource value, and circumstantial asymmetries. As we have seen, an RHP deficiency (e.g., in education, IQ, occupational status, etc.) may increase the probability that a person will adopt an expropriative strategy in a particular opportunity structure because he is forced to "make the best of a bad job." The probability of adopting an expropriative strategy increases as the availability of productive strategies declines and resource value increases. This describes the heart of the circumstances that in- spired strain theories of crime. On the other hand, the likelihood that expropriative strategies will be adopted may be enhanced by high RHP. That is, crime may result when individuals "take advantage of a good job." Traits that enhance RHP, such as privileged social status, may increase the availability of both productive and expropriative strategies. Similarly, the threat of detection and punishment may decline as one's RHP is enhanced. This is precisely the formula for white-collar crime practiced by elites. Both Marxist and other conflict theorists have sought to complete the picture of social factors conducive to crime by analyzing how RHP "wealth" increases the probability that members of advantaged classes will engage in crime. In sum, RHP asymmetry is conducive to the adoption of expropriative strategies. For different (but related) reasons, both those who enjoy superior RHP and those who suffer RHP deficiency may be likely to adopt expropriative behavior to satisfy their perceived needs. At this point, one may ask, Is it really necessary to pose an evolution- ary explanation of expropriative crime, or do other explanations do as good a job of accounting for these behaviors? What novel insights and testable hypotheses can be derived from this perspective that cannot be obtained from competing explanations? To answer these questions, we must remember that most competing explanations try to correlate the 495</page><page sequence="32">American Journal of Sociology incidence of expropriative crime with trait differences among individuals and groups. Clearly, individual and group differences do help explain variations in rates of these behaviors, and our explanation illustrates how differences in biological, psychological, and social factors influence the probability that various individuals will adopt such behaviors. Our ap- proach, however, includes two additional sets of causes of expropriative crime neglected by competing explanations: (1) properties of expropria- tive crime strategies themselves that also affect the rate of occurrence and successful completion of these behaviors and (2) the incidence of multiple kinds of strategies, with varying frequencies, in a population that contrib- ute independently to variations in the rate of expropriative crime. Hence, while acknowledging the importance of "trait differences" among individ- uals and groups in explaining expropriative crime, our approach explic- itly and simultaneously accommodates the independent causal influences of strategy evolution and their dynamics. In addition, our analysis demonstrates why behavioral patterns such as expropriative crime must be explained, in part, in sociological terms. Once again, this is not to say that individual differences-be they social, psychological, or even biological-are not important for explaining dif- ferences in these behaviors. Rather, it is simply to emphasize an elemen- tary sociological principle-patterns of behavior help determine other patterns of behavior. This principle is universal to all social species and can best be understood by an evolutionary ecological analysis, whatever the species in question. Because our perspective extends the study of expropriative crime to include strategy evolution and dynamics, it thus allows us to formulate novel insights and hypotheses regarding these behaviors. For example, imagine two populations in which the individuals in one population (A) match perfectly the individuals in the second population (B) in traits such as age, gender, IQ, arousal levels, ethnicity, body type, values, and so forth. In other words, the two hypothetical populations are indistinguish- able by the RHP traits and resource values of the individuals composing each population. This does not imply the absence of RHP or resource value variation among individuals in each population. Instead, it simply means that each population is a replica of the other, however much RHP and value heterogeneity exists in each. Given that each population is similar in the traditional biological, psychological, and social factors that have commonly been used to explain crime, many scholars would be tempted to predict that these populations should have similar crime rates. According to an evolutionary ecological perspective, however, such a prediction would not be justified because it fails to take into account the independent contribution of strategies, their interactive dynamics, and their evolution. Assume that the expropriative crime rate in population A 496</page><page sequence="33">Crime is found to be significantly higher than in population B. Inasmuch as the RHP and resource value profiles of these populations are identical, to what may we attribute the observed difference in the rate of expropria- tive crime? While traditional sociological criminologists might be hard- pressed to attribute the difference to anomie, social disorganization, status deprivation, negative labeling, or differential association, the strat- egy analyst could provide many alternative hypotheses. For example, he might predict a higher rate of expropriative crime in population A if: 1. The expropriative strategies in population A are less easily detect- able than those in population B, thereby inhibiting the successful evasion or deterrence of expropriation. 2. The expropriative strategies in population A are more easily, quickly, and economically transmitted than those in population B. 3. The personal "execution costs" to offenders (biological, psychologi- cal, and social) of expropriative strategies in population A are less than those in population B. 4. The yield of the expropriative strategies in population A is greater than that in population B. 5. Population A has been invaded by novel expropriative strategies more recently than population B, thereby decreasing the probability that effective counterstrategies have evolved. 6. Competition among expropriators in population B is more intense, thereby inhibiting the expansion of expropriative activities. 7. The innovation rate of expropriative strategies is higher in popula- tion A than in population B. 8. The innovation rate of productive strategies is higher in population A than in population B, thereby creating more opportunities for expropriation. 9. Communication among producers in population B is more exten- sive, efficient, and effective than in population A, thereby increas- ing effective guardianship. Some of these alternative hypotheses pertain to variable properties of strategies themselves, others to the overall strategy context within which any particular strategy is employed. In our judgment, however, none of these hypotheses are derivable from the alternative theories of crime causation listed above. How might one test evolutionary ecological hypotheses about the rela- tive influence of available strategies on subsequent behavior? As with other theories of evolution and crime causation, definitive empirical tests are difficult. Nevertheless, one could employ computer simulations based on game theory in which there is no need to assume a rational calculation to select the best strategy. Such an approach was used by Axelrod (1986) in his study of the evolution of norms. This could provide a way of 497</page><page sequence="34">American Journal of Sociology estimating the independent effects of strategy properties themselves. On the other hand, Boyd and Richerson (1985) advocate the use of simple mathematical models borrowed from population ecology to model evolu- tionary processes such as strategy transmissions. An alternative test could be obtained through the use of multiple laboratory or natural experiments in which the incidence of expropriative activities is observed in groups with equivalent resource values and RHP profiles, after they have been exposed to varying kinds and frequencies of productive and expropriative strategies. Using evolutionary ecological theory, not only can one deduce most of the propositions and hypotheses featured in conventional criminological theories, but one may also raise entirely new questions such as the follow- ing: How do expropriative criminal strategies evolve? When and why do expropriative rather than productive criminal strategies proliferate in populations? How do counterstrategy responses evolve? How do individ- uals acquire expropriative criminal strategies, and how are they transmit- ted? Why are "expropriation-free" populations rare and ephemeral? Is there a threshold above which expropriative criminal strategies are un- likely to spread? Guided by the evolutionary ecological theory developed herein, we have provided tentative answers to these questions. In sum, this new approach advances theoretical understanding of crime on three fronts. First, it simplifies and unifies many previously disconnected interdisciplinary theoretical arguments on expropriative crime, a connection that was not previously apparent. One characteristic of a good theory is parsimony-the ability to unite many cumulative facts and perspectives into an integrated whole through a simple theory. No other theoretical perspective on crime currently available offers as much promise for synthesizing the key insights and major empirical findings from sociology, psychology, political science, economics, and the biolog- ical sciences. The evolutionary ecological approach promises such a syn- thesis because it identifies social processes fundamental to the incidence of expropriation even across social species lines. Second, aided by the rele- vant principles of evolutionary ecology, we can now better explain that which Durkheim largely intuited: crime is "normal" because it is rooted in the very constitution of social organization and the dynamics of social interaction rather than in "pathological" conditions. Hence, the limita- tions of many traditional theoretical explanations of crime are tran- scended by an evolutionary perspective because they emphasize the nor- mal, rather than pathological, behavior of humans. Third, this approach focuses attention on a crucial but previously neglected dimension of crime causation: the contribution of expropriative strategies, rather than indi- viduals or groups, to the production of crime. In a manner independent of the characteristics of the individuals or groups that enact them, expro- 498</page><page sequence="35">Crime priative strategies themselves powerfully shape the social expression of crime. The incorporation of "strategy evolution" introduces an entirely new dimension to the theoretical explanation of crime that is not limited to any particular historical period or cultural setting. Contrary to the approach advocated by Wilson and Herrnstein, the logic of strategy analysis makes abundantly clear the impoverishment of criminological theory without a sociological dimension. Once this is understood, there is no reason to fear the attempt to reconcile and per- haps even integrate individualistic and sociological perspectives. As dem- onstrated, social factors do not decline to secondary importance or irrele- vance in this perspective. To the contrary, the evolutionary ecological theory of expropriative crime is consistent with established sociological theorizing and shows promise for extension to other classes of expropria- tion as well, including slavery, class conflict, or gender and race exploita- tion.
