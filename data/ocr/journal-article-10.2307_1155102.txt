<plain_text><page sequence="1">A RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL IN NORTHERN NIGERIA BY C. K. MEEK T HIS article is an attempt to give some account of the magico- religious ideas of the Bachama tribe. It is based on notes made during a ten-days' visit to the tribe in the spring of 1927. During this visit I had the good fortune to witness the annual festival at Fare, the description of which occupies the major part of the following remarks. I am indebted to Dr. Bronnum of the Danish Mission at Numan for a number of suggestions. The tribe, which is an offshoot of the large group of peoples known as the Bata, numbers about 8,500 persons and occupies the territory on both banks of the Benue River in the neighbourhood of Numan (Long. i2?E., Lat. 9i?). They call themselves the Gboare (i.e. the men or people). They speak a language which may be classed in the central division of the Sudanic family on the ground principally that plurals are formed by suffix or by internal change, and that gender occurs in the form of a third personal feminine pronoun. The lan- guage makes use of inclusive and exclusive first personal plural pronouns-a characteristic which Bachama shares with Fulani, Bura, Kilba, and Yungur. The government is centred in a paramount chief who resides at Numan. The Bachama and Bata appear to differ considerably from other Benue tribes in the general character of their religious ideas. They believe in a remote sky god, Pua or Hemen Pua the lord of the heavens, but they do not, like many of the Adamawa tribes, associate him with the sun, nor do they perform any rites to the sun. They have no earth god or goddess like the Jukun and other tribes of Benue Province; nor are they, like the Jukun and Igala, dominated by witch- craft and the cruder forms of so-called 'fetishism '. They venerate their ancestors by pouring libations of beer and food on the graves of chiefs and forefathers, but the skull cult of neighbouring tribes is not practised except (formerly) in the case of chiefs. Their Dr. Bronnum has written, in Danish, a monograph on the tribe.</page><page sequence="2">324 A RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL IN NORTHERN NIGERIA religion is rather a religion of gods or demi-gods; and their steadfast belief in the power of these deities to protect and regulate their lives tends to throw the more banal religious conceptions into the background. The gods appear for the most part to have been originally human beings, noted for their bravery or adroitness, who subsequently became deified and endowed with supernatural qualities. Some, how- ever, may have been animal gods in origin, for, though they are credited with a human birth, they are associated with certain animals. Thus though Ngbirrim, the god of Biempti, is said to have been a son of Venin, mother of all the Bachama gods, he is associated with the hyena, which to the Bachama and Bata is the symbol of astuteness. Similarly Gbeso the deity of Boso is known as the Bush Vulture (Zokarko). The cult of Ma Tiya Vene (i.e. the builder of the house) at Lamurde has, however, to do with the deified first chief of Lamurde; and that of Ndzo-Mewa at Bulki is also a royal cult in honour of Hamabulki, who is said to have been the second son of Venin. The daemon of Gemen (Ado minna gwe=he bit you and entered the ground) was also a royal personage. The most honoured cult of the Bachama, Bata and Mbula is that of Nzeanzo, who is enshrined at Fare, a Bata village some seven miles east of Numan. Nzeanzo is also known as Zanzo or Njanjo, and the word is said to mean ' the boy who is not a boy'. He is believed to have been the youngest of the five sons of a woman Venin, who herself receives divine honours, her death being mourned annually at the feast of Fare held in April. She is said to have come from the skies, and her brother was Wun the God of Death. The names of her father and mother are not known. Nzeanzo's brothers were Hamalbulki, Hamagenin, Ngbirrim and Gbeso (others say Marka), the founders of the rival Bachama cults. Though Nzeanzo was the youngest son he outshone all his brothers in ability and astuteness, and he corresponds to some extent to the Auta of Hausa tradition. There are numerous tales of his exploits. While still in his mother's womb he asked her to permit him to be born before his time, but his mother said she had never heard of such</page><page sequence="3">A RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL IN NORTHERN NIGERIA 325 a thing, but if he could devise a means of being born, then let him do so. Nzeanzo thereupon came out of his mother's thigh.I While he was still a small child his mother left him behind while she went with her other children to visit her brother Wun in order to purchase cattle. Wun pretended to receive his sister joyfully, but resolved to devour her children. So he set her sons to sleep with his four daughters. Nzeanzo, fearing that some evil might befall his brothers, had decided to follow them to the house of Wun, and arrived in the middle of the night. Divining the wicked intention of Wun he transferred the clothes of Wun's daughters to his brothers, and the loin-coverings of his brothers to the girls. Wun rose up in the darkness, and feeling along the line of sleeping children, he seized each child that was wearing a boy's loin-cloth and cast it into a pot of boiling water. He then lay down again to sleep. Nzeanzo thereupon roused his brothers, showed them the children of Wun boiling in the pot and the fate they had escaped. He set his mother and his brothers on the road back to Earth and himself followed riding on a hunting-dog. When Wun woke up and found how he had been tricked he hurled a river in front of Nzeanzo, but Nzeanzo caused the river to become a stream and leapt across. Wun then cast a marsh in his way, but Nzeanzo caused it to become merely a pool and, leaping over it, reached home in safety. Thereafter his brothers knew that they were no match for Nzeanzo. It may be that this tale is an attempt to account for the pre-eminence of the later Nzeanzo cult over the pre-existing cults of the Bachama. Many of the tales of Nzeanzo are aetiological. It is said that one day while he was tending his cattle he placed his grandmother in a palm tree and left her there with a supply of milk. A hippopotamus came along and demanded the milk. But the old lady had drunk all the milk, and so the hippopotamus killed her. Nzeanzo on his return, discovering what had happened, went to the river bank, found the hippopotamus and killed him. As the animal died he said: 'Henceforth no one shall cross the Benue except with the aid of wood ; for if a man attempts to swim across he shall be devoured by one of us.' And this is the origin of canoes. Compare the Egyptian 'Patch comes, appearing from the thigh of Horus.' See Budge, Osiris, vol. i, p. Ii 8.</page><page sequence="4">326 A RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL IN NORTHERN NIGERIA Another story of Nzeanzo is that once upon a time Nzeanzo col- lected all the flies in the world and put them in a calabash. He warned his brothers not to open the calabash. But during his absence they opened it, and hence the plagues of flies which men are now forced to endure. The Muja and Killa clans believe that they obtained their leechcraft and smithing arts from Nzeanzo. Among the Mbula there is a tradition, which is not known at Fare, that Nzeanzo was the leader of a tribal movement which embraced the Bachama, Bata, Mbula and some Tikar, bringing them down river in a huge iron canoe.' He left his brother at Boso while he himself went to Kwolle, but the croaking of the frogs at Kwolle disturbed him, and so he moved to Fare. He then ordered the Mbula of Zuren to make a roof for his house and bring it to Fare. They brought it and were themselves transformed into the wooden posts which supported the roof. This story is paralleled among the Kanakuru in the tale that one of their chiefs Kadang directed his young men to weave a huge mat and hold it over their heads. Immediately the young men were turned into posts and Kadang had a house to sit in. The same informant stated that one of Nzeanzo's brothers went to Kona, and that when Nzeanzo visited his brother he was attracted by the women of Kona, and took one to wife. It is for this reason that the priestess of the cult at Fare is a woman of Kona origin. The end of the god's life on earth is not clear. Some say that he died for the people, others that he withdrew from the earth because the potency of his person was causing the death of many. With this we may compare the story of Mukasa the boy-god of the Baganda, who is said by some to have died, and by others to have disappeared as suddenly as he had come (Roscoe's Baganda, p. 292). The anthropomorphic tales told of Nzeanzo do not lessen the belief in his real divinity, for he is regarded as the giver of rain, the corn-god, and even as the creator of man. He is not a remote god, but is im- manent on earth, ever present with his people and engaged in a cease- less contest with Wun the god of death. I Compare the Kede story of Edegi, who is said to have come up the Niger in an iron canoe.</page><page sequence="5">A RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL IN NORTHERN NIGERIA 327 The epithets applied to Nzeanzo imply an omniscience and loving care which is quite remarkable in West African theology. He is called the 'all-seer' (dukutun), 'the power that overshadows all' (dembu), 'the hollow in the tree' (i.e. the place of refuge). Everything that happens is carried to his ear by the wind; he is likened to the house lizard (nzo teko vene), for he beholds all that takes place; and to the small black ant (fafelo); for just as this ant scents out food, so Nzeanzo discerns your innermost thoughts. He is called ' Hillocky ground'; for just as the mounted hunter cannot gallop over hillocky ground, so a man cannot override Nzeanzo. He is ' The little horn '-you may think you may play with an animal whose horn is small, but you find your mistake. He is digenno kwalti, i.e. not an orphan whose ears you may box with impunity. He is like 'a milch cow which feeds its calves ', and a 'mother hen which gathers its chickens under its wings'. These similitudes are not the result of Christian teaching at Numan- they have been applied to Nzeanzo from time immemorial. He is even likened to ' a rubbish heap '-the place on which people deposit their troubles and offences. Perhaps one of the most remarkable expressions applied to Nzeanzo is hino hino, i. e. I am I-I have complete power over all and there is none but me. It has precisely the same meaning as the name of the God of the Hebrews, viz. Yahweh (Jehovah). The cult of Nzeanzo is in the hands of a kindred at Fare whose head bears the title of Kisami. He is assisted by a relative known as Nzo Bellato, who acts as spokesman on all public occasions. The third principal official, Nzo Duato, belongs to another kindred, and his duties are to brew the beer and prepare the food offered in the rites- he is in fact the cook of Nzeanzo. The medium of the god is a woman known as the Mbamto. She is chosen as a virgin from the town or district of Kona; which suggests, as has actually been stated, that the cult is of Jukun (Kona) origin, though there is no cult of this name at Kona. Nevertheless the Fare cult does not differ in its general character (though it differs materially in the conception of the deity) from the Jukun cult of Yaku; for the priestess is in each case regarded as the medium of the god and capable therefore of conveying to the god the wishes of the people, and to the people the wishes of the god. Moreover the Fare priestess</page><page sequence="6">328 A RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL IN NORTHERN NIGERIA is commonly addressed as Kuko or grandmother, and this is the mean- ing also of the Jukun term Yaku. The Mbamto lives a life of perpetual virginity, being regarded as married to the god who is believed to come to her house in the town every night from his shrine in the bush.' During her menses she withdraws from the sacred enclosure to a special hut (compare Roscoe's Baganda, p. 276: 'The female mediums could not perform the temple duties, nor act for the gods during their menses'). She wears her hair long, and is clothed in a skirt of strips of blue ribbon. When she goes abroad she wears, in addition, sandals and anklets of palm leaves smeared with red earth. She is not subject to any food or other tabus, except that her hair must be greased with no other kind of oil save that derived from the manatee. It is said that the smell of other oils is offensive to the god, and also that manatee oil has special properties for promoting the growth of the hair. She is not, apparently, chosen for any special psychic qualities. On first arrival from Kona, attended by a slave girl, she gives way to many tears at being torn from her home and set among a strange people; but being well treated she soon resigns herself to her lot. If she displays early signs of qualities inconsistent with her position as wife of the god she is sent away, the god repudiating her. Should it appear that her hair was incapable of growing to at least a moderate length that also would be a sign that Nzeanzo desired her not. Apparently she is not subject to possession by the god, like some mediums-indeed, it was stated that the hysterical symptoms usually regarded as evidence of possession would, in her case, be considered a sign of the god's repudiation. The shrine of Nzeanzo is situated in the forest some three-quarters of a mile from the village. It was formerly in Fare itself, but was removed to the bush, as the god could not endure the noise of the The conception of the priestess as the wife of the god is common. In ancient Egypt, for example, the high priestess was identified with Hathor, the wife of the Heliopolitan sun-god (see E.R.E., vol. xii, p. 777). And in Babylon women were set apart as the human wives of Bel. In the Hausa ' bori ' worship the priestess Arifa was not allowed to have a human husband (see Tremearne, Ban of the Bori, p. 275). See also Ellis, The Tshi-speakingPeoples ofthe Gold Coast, p. 12I; and Talbot, Peoples of Southern Nigeria, vol. ii, p. 132.</page><page sequence="7">A RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL IN NORTHERN NIGERIA 329 village. The priestess occupies a compound inside the village, the innermost hut being sacred to the god-no one being allowed to enter it save the Mbamto. A fire is kept burning there all night long; and with this we may compare the sacred fire of the temples of the gods of the Baganda, whose religion appears to bear a striking resem- blance to that of the Bachama and Bata (see Roscoe's Baganda, p. 275). Here she holds nightly converse with Nzeanzo, with whom she is believed to have sexual intercourse. He reveals to her his divine desires, and expression is given to these desires in the Bata tongue, and not in a gibberish as is frequently the case in cults of a similar character. He is believed by many to have a white skin, to be clothed in white, and to ride a white horse. It may be noted in passing that Fare is not the only town distin- guished by a priestess. The Bachama town of Nzumoso is governed by a woman; and it would appear that the raison d'etre for this is religious rather than political. For in this town there is a female spirit known as Gyengoro, and though a male looks after her shrine he takes his orders from the priestess-chief. She is said to have been given her position by her brother Hamabulki, the founder of the town and cult of Bulki. In this connexion I note in a report of Major Glasson that, among the Chamba Tsugu of the South Cameroons, one Ganlu- geni is said to have made his sister head of the town of Debbo, and high priestess of the important cult there. Elsewhere in Nigeria I have only met with chieftainesses among the Gwari of Niger Province; and as far as I can recollect they belonged, not to the Gwari tribe, but to the pre-Fulani ruling families of Zaria. The famous Queen Amina, who conquered all the Hausa states, was also traditionally connected with Zaria. It may be recalled that Thebes was at one time governed by sacerdotal princesses. To the shrine of Nzeanzo all Bachama, Bata and Mbula (the last in particular) constantly resort, either to solicit help in times of trouble or to offerthanks in times of prosperity. Those who are sick go to the shrine or send a representative. They take with them a gift of beer and a piece of cloth, or a chicken, and these are handed to the Kisami, who places the beer and cloth on a three-forked stick outside the hut of Mbamto. There they remain overnight, and the god is believed to z</page><page sequence="8">330 A RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL IN NORTHERN NIGERIA accept the 'substance' of the gifts (which are actually appropriated and used by the officials of the cult). In the morning the suppliants, accompanied by the Kisami, sit out- side the hut of Mbamto and clap their hands in salutation. They state their request, which the Kisami repeats. The Mbamto may reply that the cause of the sickness is due to an offence against Nzeanzo or some other deity, and direct that a further offering be brought; or she may remain silent, being regarded merely as the medium by which the prayer is brought to the notice of the god. Heads of families present themselves before the god at the beginning of the agricultural year with some such prayer as,'I come to you, Nzeanzo, as we purpose soon to begin planting: do you look after me and all my family: let no evil thing befall us in our work. If you turn your back on us then we shall be sore beset; but if your face is turned towards us no harm can over- take us.' The Kisami repeats this prayer, saying, 'Your slave says so and so: do you hold him by your right hand.' Thanksgiving offerings are also brought to Fare by farmers on the conclusion of the harvest. On the death of a relative a man may betake himself to Fare and make some such prayer as, 'Your slave whom you cared for in the world, you have taken. I come therefore to beseech you to help all of us who are left.' The suppliant on the conclusion of his prayer takes a little dust from the base of the three-forked stick and casts it over his left and right shoulders. The cult is of some judicial importance; for one who suffers a loss by theft will go to the shrine and call on the god to take vengeance on the thief. The thief, hearing of this, may be stricken with fear and present himself at the shrine, confessing his crime ahd asking the for- giveness of the god; for it is believed that the god takes vengeance on an unrepentant thief, not merely by killing the thief himself, but by extirpating his entire family. In political matters also the cult was in former times at least not unimportant, for if a chief oppressed his people, the Kisami, directed by Mbamto as the mouthpiece of the god, could warn the chief that if he did not mend his ways he would be slain by Nzeanzo. The principal festival of the cult is held at the end of April, and is attended by hundreds of people from the surrounding districts. It</page><page sequence="9">A RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL IN NORTHERN NIGERIA 331 marks the opening of the agricultural season, being a necessary pre- liminary to planting, and is directed towards securing the good offices of the god in all farming operations. But it is also a mourning festival commemorating the death of Venin the mother of Nzeanzo; for it is believed that by thus showing respect to his mother the favour of the god himself is enlisted. The festival lasts three days. It is not attended by the chiefs of the Bachama and Bata, as these chiefs are regarded as being in a sense the 'sons of the god'. The chief of the Mbula, how- ever, is present; for the Mbula tribe are considered to be in a special way' the slaves of Nzeanzo '. A word may be said in passing about the position of the chief in regard to cults in general. The chief does not himself perform religious rites, and it is perhaps misleading to apply to him the term priest-king. He is, however, the overseer or president of all the cults and is held responsible for the due performance of the rites. This entails the pro- vision of gifts at stated periods, or on special occasions such as the occurrence of a drought.' If he fails in this, any misfortunes that befall the tribe are ascribed to his failure: if he is punctual in his duties no blame can be laid at his door. On the other hand the gifts sent by the chief are not to be regarded merely as dues paid. Before dispatching them the chief addresses them as though they were endowed with life and understanding, saying: 'I send you to my forefather' (a general description of all the cults) '-do you salute him. And do you, my forefather, assist me in all matters affecting my welfare and that of my people-grant that we may in- crease in numbers, that sickness may be driven away, and that rain and food may be abundant.' These spoken words are believed to have a compelling effect on the deity. From this point of view the king may be regarded as a priest. But he is more than a priest, for the gods are thought to be close to, or even immanent in, his person. It is for this reason, therefore, that the person of the chief is believed to be charged with a dynamism which makes it dangerous for any one to sit close to him and still more to be touched by him. It is tabu for the chief to point his finger in anger at a man, or to strike the ground with his On the occasion of a drought the Bachama chief, like the Jukun, presents a black cloth to the cult. z 2z</page><page sequence="10">332 A RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL IN NORTHERN NIGERIA hand; for by so doing he projects against the people the destroying force of the divinities attendant upon him. Even articles which are in constant association with the chief are dangerous to touch-his bed, mat, gown are all charged with dynamic force; it is for this reason that a chief's mat or stool is commonly used as the medium on which oaths are sworn. (A chiefmay, however, give away one of his gowns without endangering the recipient. The fact of bestowing the gift with his own hands is believed to insulate it.) It will thus be seen (and this con- ception extends the whole length of the Benue) that the chief is much more than a priest: he is so closely in touch with divinity that he is almost a divinity himself-a relative of the gods (as one chief stated). Some twenty days before the Fare rites are begun Kisami goes to Lamurde and announces that the time of the festival is at hand. The chief of the Bachama presents him with eight 'taji' (bars of iron formerly used as currency), pieces of cloth, fish, sauce, some Bomanda salt, a hippopotamus skin, and eight spear-shafts. Some days later the Mbamto presents herself before the chief and receives similar gifts, together with a skin bag (which she carries on her shoulder during the festival) and a cloth skirt. In expressing her thanks she says: 'As the gifts have been given in good time we shall have health and a bountiful harvest. Had you delayed beyond the appointed time misfortune would have overtaken us.' Finally, two days before the festival begins, the chief is visited by yet another official of the cult, the Zikeno Kpake, who informs the chief and the general community of the time- table for the entire ceremony. I was present during the greater part of the festival. On the morning of the first day all proceeded to the shrine of Nzeanzo in the bush. The senior members present took up a position close to the shrine, the younger men sitting behind. Each elder held in his hands a hoe, and on his right shoulder had a crozier-sceptre made of the hide of a hippopotamus and covered with some crocodile skin. These sceptres are similar in shape and size to the sceptres of the Pharaohs of ancient Egypt. They were originally in Egypt part of the insignia of Osiris (see E.R.E., vol. vi, p. 648). All sat on their heels-the supreme attitude of respect. The official Nzo Bellato then rose, and, taking a hoe, made three furrows in the ground. The leader of the younger</page><page sequence="11">A RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL IN NORTHERN NIGERIA 333 men thereupon stepped forward, and, placing his hands over those of Nzo Bellato, pressed the hoe against the ground. Then taking the hoe into his own hands he began hoeing vigorously along the path that led to the town, followed by the other young men who had taken the hoes from their elders. Meanwhile the drums had struck up a chant, and the old men danced a slow one-step behind the young men as they hoed their way forward. When they reached a point some 300 yards from the shrine of the god they raised a small mound of earth, in which the leader of the young men stuck two fragments of his hoe handle which he had formally broken in two. The explanation given for the breaking of the hoe handle was that when you hoe the farm of the king-and the king was in this instance the god-you must put all your vigour into the work; and a broken hoe handle is a common result of vigorous hoeing. All then danced slowly back to the shrine of Nzeanzo, and were there met by the Kisami, who danced a solo step round the staves of Nzeanzo- sticks surmounted by brass headpieces planted in front of the shrine. Mbamto then appeared, attended by four old women and three young men, and began dancing slowly towards the shrine of the god. When they reached the entrance of the hut Mbamto danced forward by herself, entered the shrine and soon reappeared, still dancing the one-step with bent body. It is noteworthy that in these hoeing rites there is no formal planting of seed. Towards the end of the wet season, however, seed provided by the chief of the Bachama, who like the Jukun king is believed to be the earthly repository of the life of the corn, is formally planted close to the shrine of the god. The intention attached to this planting of seed at the end of the agricultural year was stated to be that the seed given by the god should be formally returned to him for safe-keeping during the dry season. It is analogous to the Vere custom of 'burying the life of the corn', a custom which may be related genetically to the ancient Egyptian practice of burying effigies of Osiris made of earth and corn. Nzeanzo is the corn god, and it is said of him that he first gave hoes and seed to men. On the conclusion of the Mbamto's dance the male members of the various villages grouped themselves by villages in a circle. There was</page><page sequence="12">334 A RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL IN NORTHERN NIGERIA no general intermingling; and the reason given was that the god wished to view the numbers of each village in order that he might know what havoc Death had played with them during the preceding year. If he observed that they had become reduced he would, it was said, send back to them some of their brethren who had died (for the Bachama, like most Nigerian tribes, believe in the reincarnation of at least some of the dead). The younger men then engaged in wrestling bouts, two grown-up men, known as Balagwe, acting as judges and masters of the cere- monies. They carried in their hands long ropes which they swung round the ring to keep it clear. They invited candidates to come for- ward by calling out, 'Where is the young man who would seek a fall with his brother ?' A candidate would enter the ring and sit on his heels until one of his own age and size appeared. The contest began by each young man assuming a crouching position and picking some dust from the ground in order to give him a better hold. Contact was obtained by the opponents clasping each other round the neck with the left hand, the right being used to obtain an opening. It was a catch-as-catch-can contest and the legs were freely used to trip up the opponent and land him on his back. If during the encounter one of the contestants touched the ground with both hands or turned his back on his opponent, the bout was given against him. Every now and then the contestants broke away for a few moments, and resumed after rubbing their hands again in sand. The contests were carried out in solemn fashion; and though the victor was greeted by his towns- men, who surrounded him and danced with him round the ring, he betrayed no sign of emotion.' While the wrestling was going on all the grown-up women, those subject to possession, had formed themselves into a company numbering about a hundred, and began marching slowly up and down a cleared space some distance from the wrestling ring. Each had a cloth skirt of blue, white, and yellow (red being tabu to the god). In her right hand she carried a staff to which streamers of cloth were attached (I have seen similar staves used by the Gwari women of Niger Province). Among the Ibo wrestling is an important feature of the new yam festival. See Talbot's Some Nigerian Fertility Cults, p. 114.</page><page sequence="13">A RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL IN NORTHERN NIGERIA 335 Oblivious of all others present they marched with the slow step used by troops attending a funeral, for they are the horses of the god, and, just as a king rides slowly, so they must proceed discreetly. As they marched they sang a monotonous chant, some sentences of which were as follows: 'Nzeanzo says, let horses in plenty be assembled on the morrow, that he may mount them and drive away Death. For Death shall be put to flight and no longer shall he deplete the land.' 'Nzeanzo is like a father of a son-a father permits no one to chastise his offspring and Nzeanzo will not permit Death to chastise mankind.' 'Aforetime Death was amongst us, but a thing will happen and men shall no longer die.' 'Nzeanzo went to the house of Death, but found him not for he had flown.' 'March gently, march gently, that Nzeanzo may not be angry with us. We are the steeds of Nzeanzo and he has put the bit in our teeth.' ' Nzeanzo, the youngest of all, excels the gods of Bulki and of Boso and of the white man, for he seeks out Death to pierce him with his spear.' ' Kisami is ruler of the Fare festival; he alone may summon the people and we give him thanks.' The funereal character of the women's march and song was in keeping with the main idea of the festival, a commemoration of the death of the mother of the god. The march was maintained for four hours with occasional intervals of a few minutes. Every now and then a woman would be seized by the spirit and become dazed or semi-conscious. When this happened two of her friends supported her and walked her backwards and forwards in the opposite direction to the others, until she recovered her equanimity. Throughout the morning the older men, sitting apart, regaled themselves with beer (but I did not observe a single case of drunken- ness during the three days of the festival). Occasionally they too would rise and dance round the wrestling ring in the slow one-step which was alone employed. They first stripped themselves of all clothes above the waist and danced with cloths girt about their waist in Jukun fashion. The younger men wore triangular loin coverings of blue, white and yellow cloth, and leglets and armlets of plaited grass. All weapons were tabu, and as one came along the road from Fare to the shrine one saw the branches of trees littered with knives, spears, swords, bags, and articles of unrequired clothing. No one had</page><page sequence="14">336 A RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL IN NORTHERN NIGERIA any fear of losing his clothing or property; theft during the festival is unthinkable, and any one finding property, obviously lost, takes it to the Kisami, who restores it to the owner on application. About 2 p.m. the proceedings at the shrine terminated, and all returned to the village, where, in the evening about 5 p.m., the women -the horses of Nzeanzo-resumed their solemn march. At sunset the Kisami and his followers appeared dancing, carrying short swords in their right hands. All the men joined in behind them, the seniors holding the ' Staves of Nzeanzo ', the hereditary possession of each family-head. They danced towards the house of the Mbamto, and the procession was followed up by the Mbamto herself, who also danced, holding in her right hand a forked stick. She was preceded by two women each carrying a basket filled with pots used in the rites, and behind her were two old women, the wives of the Kisami and her personal attendants. This concluded the ceremonial for the first day. On the second day, the day that draws the greatest crowds, the entire proceedings took place in the village of Fare itself. The mourn- ful atmosphere of the previous day gave place to one of unrestrained joy. Every man, woman, and child turned out in their most gaudy attire, and one saw no more of the company of mourning women. The proceedings were opened about one o'clock with wrestling bouts, the judges vigorously cracking their whips like showmen at a circus. While the wrestling was going on the young men from neighbouring villages began arranging their toilet for the dance, and a gorgeous toilet it was. In their braided hair they set two parallel rows of stork feathers, after the fashion of North American Indians. In this they assisted each other, and looking-glasses were used to see that all was correct. Some of the men did not use feathers but decked their hair with oval pieces of copper arranged after the fashion of a Roman helmet. On their waists they wore corselets of decorated plaited grass, and on their arms bracelets made from the beards of goats. Around their loins were triangular cloths pulled between the legs from back to front, and decorated in various colours, a number having streamers attached. Some wore fringed kilts of leather and a few had baggy blue trousers. Leglets of plaited grass, corresponding in colour to the corselets, were also worn, and on the right ankle each had an iron</page><page sequence="15">A RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL IN NORTHERN NIGERIA 337 rattle with which he stamped time to the dance. In their right hands they held short swords or knives. The costume of the women was even more striking. Their braided hair was studded with oval pieces of copper arranged in helmet fashion. On the back they wore corsets of blue and white beads, the strings of which were fastened tightly across the breasts and the abdomen. Over their waists were short fringed skirts of many colours. A notable feature was that each woman carried a spear in her right hand. Even the small girls carried spears, the points being tipped with wood as a safeguard against accidents. The members of each town held a preliminary dance on their own account; but about four o'clock the dancers had formed a huge circle and kept moving slowly round and round. The musical instruments used were the oblong, single and double membrane drums beaten by hand, and also small single membrane drums of pottery, the lower end ofwhichwas open. There were two xylophone players (the xylophones were of the type known as 'Sara'-graded cow-horns mounted on a wooden framework, the joints sealed with wax, being used as resona- tors: the tip of each horn was cut off and blocked with bees-wax, a small aperture being left which was covered with some spider's web. A wooden block was suspended over the mouth of each horn. The player used two forked sticks as strikers-one in each hand). On the conclusion of this, the main dance of the day, all the on- lookers proceeded to take up a position on the raised ground sur- rounding the wrestling ring, round which the dancers (who must have numbered two or three hundred) slowly performed their one-step in a crouching position, the men shaking their swords to the beat of the tune and the women their spears. The women danced with eyes closed, and a waggle of the head which gave them the appearance of being half-witted. About 5 p.m. the dance was stopped on the appearance of the Kisami and the senior men of Fare, who all sat down in the centre of the ring. Nzo Bellato then rose, his crozier-sceptre hanging on his shoulder, and holding in his right hand a short knife sur- mounted by a rattle and covered over with hibiscus fibre. Shaking the knife-rattle up and down as he spoke, he delivered himself of an oration of which the following is a rough summary: 'The "spear " I hold in my hand was given us of old by Nzeanzo, not for purposes of</page><page sequence="16">338 A RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL IN NORTHERN NIGERIA war, but that it might be planted in his house, and that we might become his servitors. Nzeanzo also gave us horses that we might go to the bush and hunt, and that we might bring the quarry killed and lay it before this spear as a gift to him. For all bush animals are his, and the lions of the bush are merely the dogs of Nzeanzo. Even women know this, for we are told of old that in the earliest days a woman bore a child; and for a moment she left her child to go and fetch some water. But when she reached the well she saw some vultures hovering in the bush, and she straightway left her pitcher, saying, "A lion has killed some bush animal; I must go and find the flesh and bring it to Nzeanzo." And she bethought herself naught about the child, but went and found the flesh and laid it before the " spear " of Nzeanzo. Moreover Nzeanzo demands that fish be brought to him; for did he not appoint Bemin to have control of the river that fish might be brought and laid before the " spear"? Nzeanzo took fish in his right hand and gave them to the men of Fare, and he took corn in his left hand and gave it to the men of Fare. But now he has turned his back on us, and people are making mock of us. Aforetime Nzeanzo appointed the men of Mbula to be the slaves of the men of Fare-he gave them corn so that if the men of Fare lacked corn they would find it with the Mbula. But now both we and the Mbula lack corn, for Nzeanzo has turned his back on us. Nzeanzo is without a peer. Once upon a time a youth of Waduku [a rival Bachama cult]-his name was Belim, a man of surpassing strength-bethought himself that he would go to Fare and overthrow the strongest of the men of Fare in a bout of wrestling. But when he reached Numan his strength began to fail, and he was hurled down by a Fare stripling before the " spear" of Nzeanzo. A youth of Yimburu thought likewise and met with a similar fate. A youth of Duom set out in the morning with all his strength, but in the afternoon he was tumbled upside down before the " spear " of Nzeanzo. A young man of Kedimin, the strongest they had, was sent to overthrow the youths of Fare; but his strength flowed away at the first stream on the road. The day of rejoicing is here, and all the people are assembled before the spear of Nzeanzo. Aforetime The emblem of the cult, though styled a spear, is in reality an iron rod with lugs at the top.</page><page sequence="17">A RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL IN NORTHERN NIGERIA 339 there was good fellowship; but husbands are now jealous of their wives-if a husband sees a man making friendly conversation with his wife at Fare he goes and sharpens his sword! But if a man pursues a woman by reason of what she did at Fare, Nzeanzo will pursue him and strike him dead, and ants will enter his nostrils, and his whole kindred will perish. If one man has followed another for a debt, and meets him at Fare, let him but point a finger at him and Nzeanzo will slay him. Nevertheless, ye women, think not that, because there is freedom at Fare, you can offer yourselves to men as a bitch in heat offers itself to a dog. For if you do, it will recoil on your own heads. Let all the people avoid adultery and theft and evil-feeling. May Nzeanzo grant us rain and crops in plenty, and if a man goes hunting in the bush and nurses no evil in his heart may he return home in safety.' The main points of interest in this speech are: (i) the jealousy dis- played towards other cults; (ii) the warning to the women that the special licence permitted at Fare is not to be taken as the normal stan- dard of behaviour; (iii) the dissatisfaction expressed at the general con- dition of things at the present time. With regard to the last point the primary concern of the officials of the cult is, of course, their own personal advantage; for they are not slow to ascribe a bad harvest, such as that of last year, to a neglect of the god and incidentally of them- selves. Nevertheless throughout the pagan tribes of the Benue there is a firm belief that sickness and death have reached a pitch which was never known before, and which is ascribed, not to the opening up of communications facilitating the spread of epidemic diseases, but to the abandonment of ancient customs as a result of European intrusion. The worth of our Government is gauged by the signs of the times; and when a series of epidemics is followed by a bad harvest, the European administration is blamed; if it could be personified it would be put to death! (In accordance with the custom of slaying the king in times of adversity.) At the conclusion of the Nzo Bellato's speech, which was listened to in silence, the people of Fare, led by the Kisami and Mbamto, per- formed a dance of their own in honour of Nzeanzo. This concluded the ceremonial of the second day. Many of the visitors set out for their homes, but large numbers remained until the following morning,</page><page sequence="18">340 A RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL IN NORTHERN NIGERIA most of them being obliged to sleep out in the open. On the following morning the men of Mbula mounted their horses and went off hunting. They returned in the evening and handed over the quarry- one or two small antelopes-to the Kisami, who gave them gifts of beer in return. Informal dancing was carried on in the village throughout the morning, and the wrestling bouts were also con- tinued. In the evening dancing was renewed; but by this time most of the visitors had returned to their villages. In connexion with the cult of Nzeanzo there is a sacred pot which is kept at Fare. When a Bachama chief dies or when the pot gets worn out or broken there are special rites for the making of a new one. Application is made to Ndako of Yimburu, who is the priest-guardian of a deep pool of water at the bottom of which innumerable spirits are believed to have their home. It is Ndako's business to procure some of the mud from the bottom of the pool, for the mud in which the spirits reside is believed to be charged with magical power. A large canoe is brought into the pool, and three or four bamboos are lashed together and are thrust down into the bottom of the pool. By this Ndako descends, and it is said that when he reaches the bottom he inquires for the spirits, but finds only the children of the spirits, the father spirits having gone off to the bush that day. The children ask Ndako what has brought him to their abode. He says that if they will bring him some mud from their houses he will give them some salt. The young spirits go off and bring the mud, and Ndako allows them to lick his fingers which had been smeared with Bomanda salt. He promises the spirits that if they will go to their houses and return in a few minutes he will give them some more salt. So off they go. Im- mediately Ndako sticks pieces of the mud on each of his finger- and toe-nails, and by shaking the bamboo pole he makes it known to the canoe-men above that he wishes to return to the surface. The canoe- men pull up the pole and Ndako falls unconscious into the canoe. The crew paddle off as fast as they can, and make for the village of Duom and then of Numan, at both of which they are given gifts. They then return to Yimburu, where they are given further gifts from the chief of the Bachama. The sacred mud is mixed with mud from the village of Kiken, and parings of the nails of the deceased chief are</page><page sequence="19">A RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL IN NORTHERN NIGERIA 341 included. With this mixture the pot is made (by any skilled old woman). The pot is sent by the Bachama chief to the Mbamto at Fare in charge of a virgin girl, who remains at Fare as an attendant on the Mbamto. The pot is used for making first-fruit offerings of beer to the god. It is also a royal talisman. It is said that if the chief displays apathy towards the cult the pot is set out in the midday sun and the chief is immediately assailed with sickness. This is similar to the Kona practice. If the chief of the Kona offended the priest who was keeper of the royal skulls, the latter retaliated by exposing the skulls to the rays of the sun. The chief, it was said, immediately fell sick, and if he did not promptly tender his apologies (accompanied by gifts) he would be ' gathered to his forefathers '. Afewfinal remarks maybe made on the subject of Bachama religion. As already indicated, the cult of gods overshadows that of ancestors. Nevertheless a Bachama is not neglectful of his ancestors and frequently offers prayers at the graves of his forefathers. If a Bachama was killed in war it was considered necessary that his wandering soul should be brought home to the family burial hut. A diviner or seer was accordingly dispatched to the bush to discover the ghost and lead it back. Armed with a calabash of water he started off; and, as he hunted the bush, he kept striking the calabash with a grass-stalk to attract the ghost's attention. Suddenly he would descry the ghost, speak to him and invite him to enter the calabash that he might be taken home to join the company of his departed relatives. The ghost did as he was bid, and the seer, hastening home, emptied the calabash of water at the threshold of the family burial hut. This rite is exactly paralleled among the Ngizim of Bornu for the recovery of souls stolen by witchcraft. The Ngizim seer retrieves the stolen soul in a calabash of water, and hurrying home empties the water over the patient, who, conscious of the restoration of his soul, heaves a sigh of relief and is, it is said, speedily restored to health. The Bachama, as already stated, believe in reincarnation, or it might be more correct to say in the possibility of reincarnation. For reincarnation ideas in Nigeria are hazily held and never amount to an absolute faith. This is the explanation of the apparently illogical custom of continuing to offer sacrifices to a dead ancestor who at the</page><page sequence="20">342 A RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL IN NORTHERN NIGERIA same time is believed to have returned to the world as a grandchild or child of a friend (i.e. who is reborn from the womb of his son's wife or the wife of a friend). Reincarnations are the exception rather than the rule. If a child shows a marked physical resemblance to a deceased ancestor he is regarded as that ancestor reborn and is treated with silent respect. If a child cries a lot and the divining apparatus declares him to be a returned forefather, he will be given a small loin-covering and miniature bow and arrow as though he were some grown-up person. His mother will even take him out to the fields and, pointing to the cows and sheep and goats, say to him: 'See, there are all your cows, just as you left them; so cry no more, for they are yours and we have not robbed you of a single one!' Ideas as to the condition of life in the next world are as hazy as our own. The abode of the dead is known as Jia Palami or the Red Country, but I was unable to obtain any explanation of this term.' Life there is a replica of that on earth, with the exception that people rest from their labours. Retributive ideas are present to some extent, for it is said that the ghosts of evil men are tied up and subjected to beatings at the hands of their fellows, by direction of the presiding spirits. There are special hunting and head-hunting rites. In every village may be seen a collection of standing stones surrounded with the heads of the larger game. When a Bachama kills a lion, leopard, rhinoceros, buffalo, elephant, hippopotamus, or wart-hog, the fame of his exploit is soon made known, and on returning he is saluted on the outskirts of the town by every one who owns a horse. He is escorted to the hunting shrine, before which he sits down. The chief or some senior man takes the tail of the dead animal and, speaking words of congratu- lation, touches the arm of the hunter with the tail. He then smears some flour over the head and body of the hunter, with the intention, it was stated, of protecting him from pursuit by the ghost of the dead animal. In the dry season the hunter's friend, who had previously I The Red Country is a term used by the Hausa for the abode of the bori spirits. It is said to be situated between Ghat and Asben, but no living person has ever seen it. Any one entering it would never appear again (see Tremearne, Ban of the Bori, p. 255). It is perhaps worth noting that in the Osiris cycle Set, 'the Red Fiend', seems to stand for the red desert soil as opposed to the black soil of the alluvial plain (see E.R.E., vol. ix, p. 220).</page><page sequence="21">A RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL IN NORTHERN NIGERIA 343 carried home the head of the animal, seeks out a monolith in the bush and brings it to the town. The hunter and his brethren, mounted on horses, attack this stone with sticks as though they were beating the life out of the animal itself. The stone is then deposited with the other stones in the shrine, and offerings are made to it periodically, pre- sumably to pacify the ghost of the dead animal. On the same principle one who had killed an enemy in war deposited in his compound a stone symbolizing his dead enemy and to this made periodical offerings. The enemy's head was, as in the case of dangerous animals, brought home by the slayer's friend and not by himself. It was deposited with a kin- dred of Piri (and not Bachama) descent, because the Piri rites were considered superior for allaying the dead man's ghost. The slayer carefully avoided sleeping in his own house until some days after the conclusion of the rites. The use of stones as the symbol or abode of dead ancestors is com- mon among the Jukun and many tribes of the Southern Cameroons. In conclusion a few words may be said about the agricultural rites of the Bachama. We have seen that the Fare festival is primarily con- nected with the opening of the agricultural year, and it would appear that among the Bachama the rites preceding the sowing of the crops are of more importance in the minds of the people than the harvest rites of thanksgiving. It is said that in former times one of the king's own children was sacrificed annually during the fertility rites of 'Pilla' carried out at Lamurde, and that in comparatively recent times the human victim was replaced by a black cow. This reminds us of the ancient custom of the sacrifice of the king's son, and we may here once more quote Sir James Frazer, who, in speaking of the custom, says: 'We may fairly infer that in Thessaly and probably in Boeotia there reigned of old a dynasty of which the kings were liable to be sacrificed for the good of the country... but that they contrived to shift the fatal responsibility to their offspring.... As time went on, the cruel custom was so far mitigated that a ram was accepted as a vicarious sacrifice.' At Nafaran no one may sow his crops until the priest of the Nafaran cult performs certain rites and distributes the seed, which has been under his keeping and is therefore believed to be charged Golden Bough, abridged edition, p. 292.</page><page sequence="22">344 A RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL IN NORTHERN NIGERIA with magical power. Among the Jukun, Kona, and Mbum the seed- corn is distributed by the chief-the product of the royal farm. This was apparently also the ancient custom of the Bachama kings, for to this day the product of the royal farm is considered the property of the community. It is not used for the daily requirements of the chief and his household, but is set aside for the benefit of the hungry and of those farmers who still believe that the product of the royal farm has special reproductive properties, and that by mixing a little of the royal seed- corn with their own the chances of a successful harvest will be con- siderably increased. The harvesting of the king's crop is carried out by the king's slaves and any commoners who wish to assist. In the case of the latter they are at liberty to help themselves to a bundle or two of the corn without asking the permission of any one. It is refreshing to find among peoples whom we are over-ready to regard as 'primitive' the humane idea that the poor and hungry man may apply to the king for assistance; and that among the Bachama, though the king may be a despot, he is also the father of his people. The necessities of the royal household are met by gifts of corn from every farmer according to his ability. It might be considered that under present conditions, as a chief receives a regular salary, the pre- sentation of corn to the chief should be discouraged. This would, in my opinion, be taking a very short view. The gifts of corn are in no sense an exaction; they are the free gifts of the people to the chief as an expression of the loyalty they feel, and as a form of payment for services rendered-services which are not always obvious to the European. In point of fact a large proportion of the corn presented to chiefs throughout the Benue regions is expended in the provision of beer and food to those (generally senior men) who consider it their duty to pay their daily respects to the chief. The curtailment of such customs can only have the effect of creating doubt in the minds of the people as to the validity of present-day chieftainship. The custom is, among the Jukun, carried on secretly, for it is felt by the people and the chief that the Government would, if it were aware of it, forthwith prohibit it. Any secrecy of this kind is detrimental to the kind of relations which ought to exist between the Government and the people; and</page><page sequence="23">A RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL IN NORTHERN NIGERIA 345 it would be better if the matter were brought into the open and received the formal approval of the Government, provided that any- thing in the nature of exactions was sternly forbidden. C. K. MEEK. Resume FETE RELIGIEUSE DANS LA NIGERIA DU NORD LES dieux jouent un grand role dans la religion des Bachama. Le culte le plus repandu est celui de Nzeanzo dont le siege principal se trouve a Fare pres de Numan. Nzeanzo est le plus jeune de cinq freres, qu'il depasse de beaucoup en valeur. I1 protege les hommes, leur accorde la pluie, leur dispense des recoltes abondantes et la fertilite pour leurs terres. Les principaux ministres de son culte sont au nombre de trois, leur chef porte le titre de Kisami. I1 existe aussi une femme, appelee la Mbamto et qui est l'interme- diaire du dieu. Elle doit etre et demeurer vierge; elle n'est pas sujette a des crises de nerfs ni a la possession par des esprits malins, en fait, des qualites psycholo- giques de ce genre la rendraient impropre a son office. La grande fete de ce culte a lieu au debut de l'annee agricole, elle constitue un preliminaire indispensable aux semailles. Bien que sa duree totale soit de trois jours, les ceremonies les plus importantes s'accomplissent les deux premiers jours. Le premier jour, tout le monde se rend dans la brousse a l'autel de Nzeanzo et les jeunes gens retournent rituellement le sol, tandis que derriere eux les vieillards dansent lentement. A la fin de cette ceremonie le chef des jeunes gens casse le manche de sa houe et plante les deux morceaux dans un petit monticule eleve a cet effet. Cet acte est suivi par deux danses executees l'une par le Kisami, l'autre par la Mbamto. Apres quoi les hommes, groupes par villages, se mettent en cercle. Les jeunes gens passent le reste de la matinee a lutter entre eux, tandis que les vieillards assis a l'ecart boivent de la biere et se levent de temps en temps pour danser autour des lutteurs. Cependant les femmes adultes reunies en troupe accomplissent une marche allant et venant a quelque distance de l'arene en chantant un air monotone. Vers deux heures de l'apres-midi, les ceremonies qui doivent avoir lieu aux environs de l'autel sont terminees, elles sont recommencees dans la soiree dans le village. Le second jour contraste vivement avec le premier, etant consacre tout entier a la joie. Les differentes scenes se deroulent a l'interieur du village, elles debutent par des assauts de lutte; des danses leur succedent, executees d'abord par villages, mais bientot tous les assistants forment un cercle etroit. La danse cesse lorsque paraissent le Kisami et les notables de Fare qui viennent s'asseoir au centre. Le second pretre du culte, qui prend toujours la parole en public, fait alors un discours, suivi par une danse executee par les gens de Fare en l'honneur de Nzeanzo. Cette danse, conduite par le Kisami et la Mbamto, termine les ceremonies du second jour. Beaucoup d'assistants ne restent pas pour la fete du troisieme jour et rentrent alors chez eux. Le lendemain matin les hommes de la tribu Mbula s'en vont chasser A a</page><page sequence="24">346 FITE RELIGIEUSE DANS LA NIGERIA DU NORD et au retour offrent leur gibier au Kisami. Des danses non reglees ont lieu dans la matinee tandis que les seances de lutte reprennent. On danse encore le soir. Quoique les dieux jouent un role important dans la religion des Bachama le culte des ancetres et la croyance a la reincarnation y ont aussi leur place. En dehors des ceremonies decrites plus haut, on peut signaler une fete de la recolte comprenant d'autres rites agricoles, et aussi des rites speciaux de chasse ordinaire et de chasse aux tetes.</page></plain_text>
