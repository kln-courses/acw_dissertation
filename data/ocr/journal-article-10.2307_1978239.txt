<plain_text><page sequence="1">Education toward the Universal Mind By MARSHALL J. WALKER A Sequel to "The Training of American Scientists"1 THE "universal mind" is impossible today; no one mind can grasp all of modern knowl- edge. So runs the plaint, with an undertone of slight nostalgia and an overtone of immense complacency. Is this true? If it is, then science is regressing, for science organizes knowledge, and the more organized knowledge of today ought to be easier to grasp than the less organized knowledge of yesterday. True, there are more facts now, but whole areas of them are nicely arranged into theories. If science is progressing, there ought to be fewer unrelated facts today than in the past, and the universal mind ought to be easier to attain than ever before. Then why are there so few candi- dates for the title of universal mind? There are several reasons. Most important is that specialists in one field today seldom make any effort to explain their work to specialists in other fields. This lack of effort is not due to lack of demand; the few publications which try to provide such articles--the Scientific American and the American Scientist--are read avidly. The actual reason seems to 1Walker, M. J. "The Training of Physical Scientists in the United States," JOURNAL or HIGHER EDUCATION, XXV. (November, 1954), P. 417. be that specialists are afraid of losing caste if they explain themselves publicly. To become known as a "popularizer" is the worst nightmare of the scientific Brahman. The proper activity of the scientist, says the Brahman, is creative research--any- thing less is merely translation. A second reason adduced for the scarcity of the universal mind is the disappearance of a universal scholarly language. Greek (and its vulgar dialect, Latin) once contained nearly all the knowledge of the Western world. Now at least a dozen languages cover the same area, and it is no longer possible to ignore the East--several more languages are needed to gain access to Oriental knowledge. This reason sounds con- vincing only for a moment. Certainly, no important theory or fact of recent years has remained unknown to inter- national science merely because it happened to be expressed in an obscure tongue. Owing to our elab- orate abstracting system, an impor- tant contribution is immediately dis- cussed and reviewed in half a dozen languages. Furthermore, it is not true that knowledge has no universal language. Mathematics is the universal language of precise knowledge today, and any 17</page><page sequence="2">18 science which has developed beyond the descriptive stage is expressed largely in mathematical form. This fact has led to a peculiar situation of unidirectional diffusion. The physi- cal scientists and others who read both mathematics and verbal lan- guage readily can understand the writings of the historians and some- times the poets. But the reverse process seldom occurs; few historians and poets can read science except in translation. This situation must be changed, for a house divided against itself cannot stand. THUS it appears that the explana- tions commonly given for the vanishing of the universal mind do not explain the disappearance at all. Some deeper cause must be sought in the structure of our own culture. Whatever subtle forces may be at work, there is one most obvious factor--our schools and universities no longer try to educate toward the universal mind. The subtle forces may be hard to identify and redirect, but it is certainly possible to consider changes in our educational procedures. One half of this problem is recog- nized by those critics who maintain that our future scientists are taught too little history and poetry. The other half of the problem is that our future historians and poets are taught too little science and mathematics; they are trying to study a world without even learning its dominant scholarly language. Our universities have got into this swamp of specialism by forgetting to distinguish between the principles of an area of thought and the art of applying those principles to specific situations. The principles are the JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION concern of a university and the universal mind, but the art is the concern of a few courses in profes- sional schools and is not the concern of the universal mind. For example, the universal mind would know the principles and history of the pipe organ and might be an avid listener at organ recitals; but the art of building an organ, playing an organ, or writing music for an organ is for the specialist. In music, fine arts, and literature the distinction is clear, and the university does not use valu- able time in trying to train all music students to write organ sonatas; but universities which train physical sci- entists frequently lose sight of this distinction. Chemistry students not only learn the principles of quantita- tive analysis, but spend innumerable hours running gravimetric and volu- metric determinations. This pro- cedure is supposed to develop tech- nique and a respect for accuracy. The technique is hardly ever used, and the difficulty of accuracy is well appreciated after a few determinations in triplicate. Similarly, the theory of a bridge circuit is the concern of a student of physics, but the construc- tion and operation of a Type Z, Series II precision bridge is a matter to be obtained from the instruction manual when, and if, the instrument is ever encountered. Similarly the study of languages has a part in this quest. The place of ancient and modern language in education appears to be understood by very few outside the language departments. The linguists them- selves know very well the difference between studying the principles of a language and acquiring the art of speaking it fluently. The charge</page><page sequence="3">THE UNIVERSAL MIND that high-school students waste time on Latin because no one ever speaks it is based on a complete lack of understanding of the most important reason for studying a foreign language. The main value to education of the study of a foreign language lies in its unique contribution to an understanding of the principles of the communication of thought. A basic aim of all serious education is a comprehension of the distinction between a concept and the words, or symbols, used to describe that con- cept. The person with only one language is at a hopeless disadvantage in such a task. The color yellow can never be appreciated by itself, but only as one of a series, by comparison with red and blue. Many of the critics of language study have them- selves studied foreign languages and appear to be unaware that this study has contributed much toward their ability to think. Having color vision themselves they recommend color blindness for others. It does not matter that a person seldom uses Latin in daily life after leaving school; the contribution has become part of his mind. He has learned at first hand that the effect of a word depends more on the speaker and the listener than on the dictionary. Furthermore, Latin is unique as an instrument for illustrating language principles to English-speaking people. Latin reveals in a reasonably complete form the endings which have nearly disappeared in English. Teaching English grammar without comparing it to other grammars is like trying to teach the laws of color combination to a color-blind person. It is no surprise when beginning students of Latin 19 announce that English grammar has, for the first time, suddenly become clear to them. Greek or German can serve the same semantic purpose. They have the advantage that their literature is more suited to our scientific frame of mind, but Greek constructions are so alien as to be difficult, while German roots are less familiar than Latin roots. Modern Romance lan- guages do not serve this semantic purpose nearly as well, because they are too similar to English. It would assist toward the develop- ment of the universal mind if more courses in comparative philology were available. The advantage of com- paring the methods of different lan- guage groups is obvious. One in the process of education toward the universal mind would probably wish to read Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, and a few modern languages. This choice would make available to him the great religious books of the world, each in its own language. T HE universal mind is not some- thing that is obtained by attend- ing a school, and rather few students will be interested in pursuing such a goal. It is contended, however, that the proper function of the college of arts and sciences of a university is a calculated attempt to lay the founda- tion for the universal mind. The place of philosophy in this curriculum remains to be discussed. The sciences all originated in philos- ophy, but have now become separate domains, leaving philosophy with only the remnants of a once mighty empire. One would expect that philosophy would be assiduously con-</page><page sequence="4">20 cerned with a general theory of knowledge, that is, a theoretical foundation for the universal mind. Currently there appears to be little productive activity in epistemology in philosophy itself, but some very provocative contributions have ap- peared as by-products of other fields. Mathematicians, Russell, Godel, Rosser, and others, working in sym- bolic logic have uncovered theorems which may be experimental evidence of specific limits to the human mind. Such electrical engineers, as Shannon, Weaver, and Goldman, working on communication problems, have devel- oped a mathematical theory of infor- mation that systematizes the whole concept of knowledge. Cyberneticians, Wiener, Rosenblueth, Vallarta, and others, have uncovered very illum- nating parallels between the action of the brain and electrical circuit theory. It is significant that these advances have all come from men highly versed in mathematics, while the classical epistemologists working without mathematics have remained sterile. It is further significant that most of these advances were made by men with only a reading knowledge of philosophy. This fact indicates clearly that philosophy has lost its cumulative areas to other fields, and that the remainder of classical philos- ophy is largely of historical interest. The work of the Positivists has been largely assimilated into physical sci- ence, another example of the self- attrition to which philosophy subjects herself. The ancient queen of the sciences, theology, is much neglected in modern education. This has resulted from the literalist viewpoint of the past. Now that theology has begun to free JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION itself from such constraints, the way is open for theology to regain its stature as a proper concern for the free human mind. Theology is a growing and changing thing; it has a form suitable for the most sophisti- cated culture, and it is the task of modern man to study the great writings of the past, and to recast them into the categories of his own time. The modern technologist who feels only contempt for the ancient anthropomorphic theology is con- cerned with an abandoned chrysalis-- the butterfly itself has flown, and awaits his study elsewhere in a form beautiful beyond his dreams. The technologist expects all things to be written semantically; he must learn to look beyond unsemantic words to concepts not yet expressible in the language of mathematics. He must learn to read the Vedas, the Torah, the Gospels, and the Koran with the understanding that mighty concepts lie behind these works awaiting trans- lation into his own thoughts. The universal mind must know Kabir as well as Aristotle, Jakob Bohme as well as Isaac Newton. BUT how can all this additional material find space in an already crowded curriculum? The task is admittedly difficult, but not impos- sible. Some of the work can be done in secondary school. If mathematics through calculus is acquired in high school then in college the physical sciences can be taught more efficiently and advanced mathematics studied earlier. The languages can be started as early as the seventh grade, and comparative philology taken up in the fourth year of high school after [Continued on page 55]</page><page sequence="5">Education toward the Universal Mind MARSHALL J. WALKER [Continued from page 20] two or more languages have been studied. A second biology course could be inserted into the high school by eliminating the vague course in general science. Considerable time can be saved in college technical courses by study- ing the principles of a field and relegating the art of that field to industry. Even more time can be saved by arranging that subjects which consist largely of reading should include the summer recess as part of the semester. Literature, classical philosophy, sociology, and history could be studied in this manner, thus relieving pressure during winter semesters. What then can be expected of schools and colleges in educating toward the universal mind? From the primary schools one expects an inculcation of reading, writing, and arithmetic by whatever methods pro- duce satisfactory results. From the secondary schools one expects a mastery of mathematics through cal- culus, a good introduction to physical and biological science, the ability to present skillfully ideas in speech and writing, and the beginnings of an acquaintance with history, litera- ture, and languages. From the liberal- arts college one expects a planned attempt at a foundation suitable for the development of the universal mind. From the graduate school one expects intensive study of a particular area--that profound knowl- edge of a specific field without which the universal mind remains a mere dilettante. From all of these together one expects a mastery of the tools necessary to the study of nature, man and books, and a sound beginning to the lifelong quest toward the universal mind.
