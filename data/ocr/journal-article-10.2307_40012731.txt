<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mystical union, traditional theism and veridicality: A revisitation ROBERT OAKES International Journal for Philosophy of Religion 39: 65-76 (April 1996) Â© 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands. University of Missouri, St Louis, Missouri, USA I It has long been clear that distinguished mystics from all of the major reli- gious traditions - notwithstanding their many speculative or doctrinal dif- ferences - have been virtually unanimous in maintaining that contemplative states at their most spiritually telling are profoundly unitive in character. Specifically, the religionists in question have long insisted that the central or governing phenomenological feature of such states consists in the over- whelming sense of being ontologically absorbed into - dissolving into1 - the Infinite; i.e., of merging with the Ultimately Real or the Divine to an extent which spells the obliteration or extinction of their own finite selves as distinct centers of consciousness. Alternatively, there is the profound sense that one's separate identity gives way - for the duration of the states in question - to 'undifferentiated unity'. While this is more than well-enough known to obviate the need for exten- sive citation,2 it is hard to resist brief reference to some especially outstand- ing and paradigmatic examples of unitive mystical phenomenology. For reasons that will shortly be obvious, each of the descriptions to follow is from the writings of a distinguished mystic who is also a traditional Christian or Jewish theist. Thus van Ruysbroeck: The spirit forever continues to burn in itself... it is drawn and trans- ported into the Unity of God, where the spirit burns in love . . . where it is burnt up it is undifferentiated and without distinction, and therefore, it feels nothing but unity; for the flame of the Love of God consumes and devours all that it can enfold in its Self.3 Thomas Merton is in agreement: . . . where contemplation becomes what it is really meant to be, it is no longer something infused by God into a created subject, so much as God . . . identifying a created life with His own life so that there is nothing left of any significance but God living in God.4 Alternatively,</page><page sequence="2">66 As long as there is an T that is the definite subject of a contemplative experience, an I that is aware of itself and of its contemplation ... we have not yet passed over the Red Sea 5 Finally, here are the words of Rabbi Shneur Zalman, the founder of Habad Hasidism: . . . when man cleaves to God . . . this is the true cleaving ... as he becomes one substance with God into whom he was swallowed . . . that is the mean- ing [of the verse] and you shall cleave to him - [to cleave], literally.6 As has long been recognized, descriptions such as these cannot but raise a daunting issue for epistemologists of religious experience: namely, what is to be made of the phenomenology of 'undifferentiated unity' as reported and extolled by theistic mystics? Clearly, an axiomatic or nonnegotiable compo- nent of canonical theism is that there obtains a metaphysically unbridgeable duality between God and creature. (Indeed, this is standardly taken to mark a crucial difference between traditional theism and the more 'monistic' or 'pantheistic' world-views of the East such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism.) Hence, it seems indisputable that theistic orthodoxy could not begin to countenance the notion that finite selves are capable of literal or ontological dissolution - or 'meltdown' - into the Infinite Self Who is God.7 While there may well be phenomenological unity (whatever this comes to), traditional theism assuredly requires that, 'metaphysically, there is duality'.8 Now what has standardly been considered to be a corollary of all this is that traditional theism - while clearly allowing that the unitive states in question are phenomenologically or psychologically fascinating (and thus deserving of serious study in that regard9) - entails that no mystical state consisting in undifferentiated unity could properly be viewed as a veridical representation of something which is actually taking place. It seems to me that this conclusion needs to be resisted. Our agenda in what follows is to provide a successful defense of the following thesis: while canonical theism clearly precludes any substantive or ontological absorption of finite selves into God, it is entirely consistent with the occurrence of unitive mystical states - states the phenomenological content of which consists in (or is describable as) 'undifferentiated unity' - which are (straightforwardly) veridical. Accordingly, the purpose is to develop and defend a theistically appropriate interpretation of unitive mystical states out which allows for their (straightforward) veridicality without in any way compromising the canonically axiomatic principle that the metaphysical duality between God and creature is absolutely unbridgeable. As will become evident, the account to be proposed will move us in a more heavily epistemological direction than has standardly been taken by analytic discussions of dissolutive mystical phenomenology. While the theory</page><page sequence="3">67 to be defended is inescapably speculative, and, accordingly (as one could not but expect from a speculative hypothesis), resistant to rigorous demon- stration, what is readily seen to be its explanatory strength vis-a-vis two fundamental features of unitive mystical consciousness - i.e., the much- emphasized phenomenon of 'ineffability' and the overwhelming sense of being ontologically absorbed into God - would seem to constitute some respectable confirmation of it. Hence, the account to follow is proffered not simply as a (conceptually) possible explanation of theistic mystical phe- nomenology, but, indeed, as a reasonable or plausible explanation of it. II Absolutely central to canonical theism is the doctrine of Divine Simplicity. As stated by Descartes, the simplicity of God '. . .is one of the principal perfections which I conceive to be in Him'.10 Here, of course, he is in accord with the tradition as a whole. Significantly, the principle of God's Simplicity is the second of Maimonides' thirteen Principles of Faith - preceded only by the Principle of God's Existence.11 Moreover, Aquinas gives the doctrine the very same pride of place, providing an elaboration and defense of it immediately following his argumentation for God's Existence.12 Perhaps the most telling indication of the strength of the con- viction that simplicity is a necessary ingredient of perfection is the polemic in this regard by Spinoza. Notwithstanding his revisionist or 'heretical' metaphysical deviation from canonical theism - his insistence that exten- sion constitutes a Divine attribute - he remains remarkably aligned with the tradition in maintaining that the Divine Nature admits of no 'divisibility' whatsoever.13 Accordingly, he argues the (presumably) counterintuitive thesis that Infinite Substance, albeit extended, should not be construed as composite. Thus, even Spinoza's dramatic break with theistic orthodoxy in attributing extension to God failed to deter him from subscribing to the clas- sical thesis that composition - or any sort of plurality - is axiomatically or self-evidently incompatible with absolute perfection. It is, however, far from our purpose here to defend the tenet of God's Simplicity. Moreover, any attempt to do so would surely be an exercise in the gratuitous since an abundance of admirable argument - thus argument which needs no help from me - can readily be found in a number of recent papers on the topic.14 Hence, my interest is in elucidating the significance of Divine Simplicity for the thesis at hand. Specifically, that God is essentially and absolutely simple is readily seen to have an intriguing epistemic impli- cation: namely, that the Divine Grasp of all there is to be known must consist in one grand intellectual intuition - a seamless or unparsed whole.</page><page sequence="4">68 For since God's perfect simplicity ensures that His knowledge cannot be distinct from His Essence (lest there be, per impossible, some complexity in the Divine Nature), His knowledge must share the absolute simplicity of His Essence. So Maimonides: '...His knowledge is His essence, and His essence is His knowledge'.15 Accordingly, His knowledge cannot be 'multi- ple'. Aquinas could not agree more: '. . .His act of understanding must be His essence and His being'.16 Thus '. . . in the divine knowledge there is no discursiveness ... God sees all things together, and not successively'.17 Alternatively, since knowing by (the normative human) way of proposi- tional structuring clearly involves some measure of complexity, the Divine Simplicity ensures that God's mode of cognition is inherently nonproposi- tional. While we often find it convenient to represent Divine Cognition as complex or propositional, it should be clear that, strictly speaking, this con- stitutes an epistemic 'anthropomorphism' not to be taken any more literally than ontological anthropomorphisms such as God's 'outstretched arm'. Perhaps a helpful way to sharpen our sense of what God's sweeping or Gestalt-like grasp of all things would be like - recognizing, of course, that this comparison suffers the severe limitations of all such models drawn from the human domain - is to consider, e.g., the initial moment of our per- ception of a scene which is altogether new to us, or the mode of our percep- tual apprehension upon just waking up.18 Cases such as these seem to constitute paradigms of perceptual awareness which is judgment-free, i.e., which lacks propositional structure: cases of 'pure presentation' or 'given- ness'. Note that this does not entail a denial of the widely-subscribed-to thesis that all seeing is seeing-as, and should in no way be taken to mini- mize the interpretive, classifying, or property-ascribing role of mind in the acquisition of (human) perceptual knowledge. Rather, it is simply to suggest the importance of not forgetting to underscore the basic soundness of the notion that nothing could truly count as perceptual knowledge if it failed to incorporate an element which, in the still telling formulation of C.I. Lewis, 'we do not create by thinking and cannot, in general, displace or alter'.19 Accordingly, this purely presentational element in human perceptual cogni- tion can plausibly held to provide us with some sense (admittedly distant) of how God - by virtue of His essential simplicity - apprehends all things. Ill In his work Seeker of Unity, Louis Jacobs discusses some of the intriguing speculative views of the distinguished nineteenth-century Lithuanian Rabbi, Aaron of Starosselje. Our central interest here is with the Rabbi's interpreta- tion of the Scriptural passage (from Numbers 12:8) in which it is said of</page><page sequence="5">69 Moses and Moses alone '. . . the similitude of the LORD doth he behold'. Jacobs' exposition proceeds as follows: Aaron's novel interpretation of this verse is that Moses was so lost in God, without a separate identity of his own, that he did not see things as other mortals do, but saw them as God sees them. He beheld them in the 'similitude of God'...20 It should be clear that (notwithstanding R. Aaron's rather nontraditional leanings towards 'pantheism' or 'acosmism'21) the clause 'without a sepa- rate identity of his own' is precluded by the context in which it is embedded from connoting a literal or substantive merging with God. For the ontologi- cal dissolution of one's self in God is conceptually incompatible with one's seeing things as God sees them: to be treated to seeing things in that way clearly entails (or presupposes) the existence of a self distinct from God. Otherwise, who would it be who is apprehending things as God does? Moses? Hardly: for if 'without a separate identity of his own' were to be understood to mean that Moses underwent a substantive vanishing into God, there would simply be God - no other self at all - Who was doing the apprehending. As an intriguing complement to R. Aaron's proposal, consider these fol- lowing observations by Philip H. Wicksteed: For the medieval saint believed that to see God is to see as God sees, and that just in so far as we rise into true communion with him and do in truth see God, so far shall we see things not in their fragmentary imperfections, but in their combined perfectedness . . . thus when the supreme vision is granted to Dante, and he lifts his mortal eyes to look into the light of God, he sees all things ... as a single perfect whole.22 It seems to me that this construal of mystical illumination is not only fasci- nating, but - and one can only wonder just why this has largely gone unrec- ognized - holds some very exciting promise as the key to explaining why canonical theism does not preclude the veridicality of religious experience the phenomenological content of which is expressible as 'undifferentiated unity'. Alternatively, this notion of 'seeing as God sees' gives serious indi- cation of being precisely what is needed to overturn the long-standing notion that, because unitive mystical states cannot possibly constitute veridical indications of metaphysical fusion between the relevant phenome- nological subjects and God, they cannot in any way be veridical Consider: since God's Simplicity dictates that His cognitive grasp of all things is free of any conceptual, propositional, or epistemic complexity, to 'see as God sees' would, of course, be to share in that mode of cognition. Hence, in any case in which this epistemic privilege was actually bestowed upon some finite or created self, the relevant person (or unitive mystic) would be treated to an all-inclusive and epistemically noncomposite intel-</page><page sequence="6">70 lective intuition of the whole of reality: a grasp of all things from the Divine Point of View. However, what could constitute a more fitting characteriza- tion of the content of such a 'Gestaltist' apprehension than 'undifferentiated unity'? Moreover, the Divine Point of View is necessarily free from any distortion or error - i.e., could not fail to constitute an ideally veridical point of view.23 Hence, to see-as -God-sees would be to grasp all truth in an epistemically optimal way. Accordingly, the theory being defended is that the 'undifferentiated unity' reported by distinguished theistic mystics can well be veridical by virtue of the relevant mystics being in epistemic align- ment with - undergoing an epistemic merging with - the Divine mode of cognition. Thus, the sort of 'merging' in question is readily seen to be dra- matically distinct from the canonically precluded substantive dissolution into God. Now this is not to imply that a finite or created self who was privileged to share in God's unfragmented grasp of all things would thereby possess an unsurpassably precise or perfect grasp of the whole. To the contrary, there seems to be no plausible way to deny that that is a privilege reserved for God alone. Rather, on the interpretation being proposed, the unitive theistic mystic would 'see as God sees' to the maximal extent possible for a limited or created intellect. Hence, any such occurrence would consist, strictly speaking, in an approximation of 'seeing as God sees' - in a kind of (as it were) cognitive Imitatio Dei. Further, in keeping with the tradition (which, of course, remains the framework for our analysis), the epistemic state con- sisting in 'seeing as God sees' is not something which a created self - no matter how spiritually sensitive - would have the wherewithal to bring about on its own. Rather, any such cognitive elevation or expansion would have to constitute a Divine bestowal. As eloquently stated by Thomas Merton: True contemplation is ... the experience of a union that is so purely and perfectly supernatural that no created nature could possibly bring it about. Indeed, no spirit less than the Spirit of God can possibly produce even a plausible imitation of true mystical union.24 IV The important question now needing to be addressed is clearly this: granted that it is (conceptually) possible for unitive mystical states to consist in occurrences of 'seeing as God sees' - and thus that canonical theism does not require the nonveridicality of such states - is there any respectable justification for taking the proposed interpretation to be the correct - or even a credible - theory of the phenomenology of 'undifferentiated unity'</page><page sequence="7">71 as reported by distinguished theistic mystics? It seems to me that such justi- fication is not terribly difficult to find. Specifically, there seem to be two notable reasons which can be adduced in support of our theory: reasons which, taken in conjunction, add up to eminently respectable - albeit less than compelling - justification for accepting it, i.e., justification which secures the plausibility of our interpretation without making it rationally obligatory to regard it as true. First, consider the long-standing emphasis upon the ineffability of mysti- cal illumination at its most spiritually profound. While indisputably a central characteristic of unitive mystical phenomenology, at least one highly-esteemed authority on the topic takes it to be the dominant character- istic of such experience.25 Of course it can hardly be said that the states in question are absolutely ineffable, i.e., that they cannot be characterized at all. For if so, even the time-honored undifferentiated unity could not be an expressible feature of such experience. This being duly noted, however, it hardly calls into serious question the long-standing contention that the experiences in question are fundamentally ineffable, since it can simply by responded that undifferentiated unity constitutes little more than the articu- lable tip of the marticulable phenomenological iceberg. Significant for our interpretation of unitive mystical states, however, is that the traditional insistence on the ineffability of such states is precisely what is to be expected from a created self who was granted the epistemic privilege of seeing-as-God-sees. Consider how cognitively overhelming it would be for such a self to rise - to the fullest extent compatible with the limitations of its finitude - to a unified grasp of the whole of things. Just as people are often rendered speechless (or relatively so) when experiencing one of the marvels or majesties of Nature (e.g., the Grand Canyon) or an especially beautiful or remarkable human artifact (e.g., the Egyptian pyra- mids), how much more so in the case of an experience, which, presumably, could not conceivably be surpassed in epistemological richness: the experi- ence of seeing as God sees. While 'undifferentiated unity' would be an admirably appropriate way of describing any such experience - a succint articulation of the unitive mystic's (approximation of a) Gestaltist or God's- eye apprehension of all things - this could not but convey a miniscule frac- tion of the dazzling epistemological opulence (and spiritual profundity) of the experience. Hence, given the extraordinary deviation of such apprehension from what is epistemically routine or normative for human knowers, it would seem to be perfectly understandable that the full texture and depth of the experience should test the very limits of what is conceptually expressible by such knowers. Thus, the much-emphasized 'ineffability' of unitive mystical states would be precisely what one would expect from any finite self trying</page><page sequence="8">72 to articulate (beyond, of course, 'undifferentiated unity') just what it is like to be in epistemic alignment with the Divine mode of cognition. While it is not being held that this explanation of the ineffability phenomenon is unquestionably superior to all other ways26 of explaining it, the point being driven is that it is very adequately explained by the interpretation of unitive mystical experience which has been proposed. The second notable reason which can be adduced in support of our theory is its considerable explanatory power vis-a-vis the compelling sense of sub- stantive dissolution into God - the compelling sense of (ontologically) undifferentiated unity - as regularly reported by unitive theistic mystics. Specifically, the interpretation which has been proposed is well able to explain just why unitive mystical states would would so readily wear the phenomenological guise of one's individuality being ontologically absorbed into God, i.e., just why such states would so readily come across experien- tially as an ontological 'vanishing into God'. First, it seems indisputable that, as a function of His essential and exclu- sive incorporeality,27 God possesses neither sensibility nor imagination.28 This is not, of course, to hold that God 'lacks imagination' in the sense in which, e.g., some politician might be said to 'lack imagination'. Obviously, God is incalculably rich in creativity. What 'imagination' denotes here is strictly the capacity for receiving or producing imagery. Accordingly, the Divine grasp of all things is entirely free of (as the Scholastics were fond of putting it) 'phantasm'. Needless to say that God's 'lack' of such capacity is an entirely Pickwickian lack - on the order of his 'lacking' the ability to break a promise, or do evil, or be petty. As has standardly been pointed out, such 'lacks' are a function of His perfection, and, accordingly, can hardly constitute deficiencies. (Hence, beings who - like us - possess such 'abili- ties' are clearly imperfect if only for that very reason.) So: since it is neces- sarily true that no perfect being being is corporeal, and necessarily true that no incorporeal being possesses sensibility or imagination, it is necessarily true that no perfect being possesses sensibility or imagination. Thus, to see as God sees would be to apprehend all things not only with- out epistemic complexity, but without the involvement of imagery or phan- tasm. Unless one's apprehension is free of all sensory/imaginational involve- ment, one could not properly be held to be in (or to approximate) epistemic alignment with the Divine mode of cognition. Hence, to be in such align- ment would unquestionably constitute a whopping deviation from the usual manner in which human persons come to experience or apprehend the world - not only because it consists in one simple all-inclusive appre- hension of all things, but because it precludes the involvement of any sensi- bility or imagery. However, given the utter centrality29 of sensibility and imagery to the everyday operation of our cognitive life, i.e., given that our</page><page sequence="9">73 (earthly) tie to corporeality dictates at least an initial or foundational depen- dence upon sensibility and imagination for the acquisition of all naturally- acquired knowledge, it is not at all hard to understand how any case of apprehending the world from the Divine point of view - since any appre- hension of that sort would necessarily involve a 'blackout' of the sensory- imaginational apparatus of the person involved - would come across phenomenologically as the 'loss" of self as such. Alternatively, by virtue of its centrality to our ordinary cognitive life, the 'loss' of the sensory- imaginational capacity of self - a loss which would necessarily attend any case of seeing as God sees - can readily come across phenomenologically as 'loss of self simpliciter. Hence, for the reasons just discussed, it seems proper to hold not simply that it is possible for the 'undifferentiated unity' reported by theistic mystics to indicate epistemic alignment with the Divine mode of Cognition - i.e., not simply that this explanation is entirely compatible with the theistic axiom that the ontological duality between Creator and creature is meta- physically inviolable - but to hold that it constitutes a plausible explanation of the 'undifferentiated unity' reported by theistic mystics. In sum, it is a theory which dexterously manages to explain two very central aspects of unitive mystical states: namely, their (basic) ineff ability and the compelling sense of ontological absorption into God which constitutes (or at least lies at) the very core of such states. While this hardly mandates the truth of our account, it appears to ensure (or at least strongly suggest) the propriety of regarding it as plausible. V A concluding observation: it seems clear that the topic with which we have been concerned has more than incidental relevance for the fascinating and religiously central phenomenon of prophecy. Can authentic prophecy fail to involve some sort of mystical experience? Alternatively, does it not seem appropriate to regard prophetic illumination as a species of mystical illumi- nation? Intriguingly, according to the account of one very respected exposi- tor of the phenomenon of prophecy, either the converse is the case - (veridical) mystical experience is actually a species of prophetic experience - or, perhaps more accurately, the former and the latter are not simply coex- tensive: The essence of prophecy is an attachment to, or communication with, God which is experiential in nature. God may at times utilize this bond of communication as a means of transmitting a message to others through the prophet via the medium of the prophetic experience.30</page><page sequence="10">74 Obviously, this is at odds with what might be called the popular conception of prophecy as invariably involving some sort of (stateable) message from God. While Professor Bleich acknowledges that our major prophets were recipients of divine messages, he maintains that the vast majority of those prophetically attached to God 'were not the bearers of prophetic prophetic messages designed to be immortalized as the word of God'.31 Albeit clearly a topic for separate inquiry, it seems hard to deny that a serious philosophical look at the nature of prophetic experience is long overdue. Moreover, there would seem to be little foundation for denying that an acceptable or plausible interpretation of unitive mystical phenome- nology - the achievement of which has been the purpose of this investiga- tion - would shed more than negligible epistemological light on the religiously significant phenomenon of prophecy. Notes 1. It should be noted that the force of the word 'dissolving' here cannot safely be taken as metaphorical. For what goes on phenomenologically in the course of unitive mystical contemplation - as evident from paradigmatic descriptions by the relevant phenomeno- logical subjects (see examples below) - is remarkably comparable to what happens to a sugar cube when placed in hot water. 2. An outstanding source to consult in this regard - for veteran epistemologists of religion no less than relative newcomers to the topic - is Nelson Pike's Mystic Union (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1992), especially part 3 of chapter 2. 3.

Thus an intriguing question is raised: since the way in which God apprehends all things could not fail to constitute a veridical apprehension, must it not be the case that some (at least) moderate version of 'monism' is true? Minimally, does this not seem to entail that, as many idealists have insisted, that all relations are internal? Here is Leibniz: '...it must be known that all things are connected in each one of the possible worlds: the universe, whatever it may be, is all of one piece, like an ocean . . . ' (Theodicy, Ed. with Introduction by Austin Fairer, La Salle, II: Open Court [1985], 1993; p. 128). Obviously, this is an issue which we cannot pause to address here; it seems to me, however, to be eminently worthy of investigation. 24. Thomas Merton, The Ascent to Truth (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich [1951], 1979), p. 70. 25. Evelyn Underhill makes this claim in her now classic Mysticism (New York: New American Library, 1974), p. 101. 26. For example, there is (what might be called) the 'Jamesian' explanation that mystical states - notwithstanding their strongly 'noetic' component - are closer in texture to feeling-states than states of cognition, and, accordingly, share the fundamental ineffabil- ity of feeling-states. Incidentally, it seems far from obvious that the Jamesian account of ineffability cannot be reconciled with the account presently being argued. 27. It would seem that 'essential' and 'exclusive incorporeality are importantly different. If Plato and Descartes are correct, then each of us is essentially incorporeal. However, since we (at least for now) have bodies, it seems proper to deny that we are exclusively incorporeal. Hence, to note that God is essentially and exclusively incorporeal is not to be guilty of redundancy. 28. As Maimonides puts it, '...imagination is in no way able to hold itself aloof from matter' (Guide, I, 73). Moreover, it is for precisely (or virtually) this reason that God's apprehension of things cannot be in any way sensory: '. . . God, whom no external being can affect, who perceives nothing by sense as we do . . . ' (Berkeley, Dialogues, part 3).</page><page sequence="12">76 29. Cf.
