The Analysis of Gen. 37:2-41:57.? [The subjects treated in this section are,-(1) Joseph's dream; (2) Joseph sold into Egypt by his brethren; (Judah and Tamar;) (3) Joseph in Potiphar's house, and in jail; (4) the dreams of Pharaoh's baker and butler; (5) Pharaoh's dream; (6) the elevation of Joseph.] A.

". * THE AmLEGED FACTS AND CONSIDERATIONS OF THE PENTATEUCHAL ANALtYSIS PRE- SENTED AND CRITICISED BY Professors Har~er (of Yale) and Green (of Princeton). t The answer to certain criticisms made and certain positions taken by Professor Green in the April number, will be reserved until all the historical matter has been considered. , This article is a continuation from the July HIEBRAICA. Professor Green's reply will appear in the January (1890) HEBRAICA. ? In the work of collecting and classifying the facts of the analysis, I desire to acknowledge my very great indebtedness to the assistance rendered me by Mr. Samuel Weyler, New Haven, Conn. 1i The enumeration of the generations comes in 46: 6-27, which immediately follow these verses. ? P does not tell us how Joseph came to Egypt. ** All the material of this section, except the first clause, is a parenthetical statement con- taining a few dates and facts about Joseph and Egypt, explanatory of future matter. *2</page><page sequence="2">2 HEBRAICA. 3. LANGUAGE OF P. 1) OLD WoRDS. (1) r1ii1h # (37:2). 4. STYLE OF P. 1) Dates. (1) "Seventeen years" (37: 2). (2) "Thirty years old" (41: 46). 5. MATERIAL OF P. 1) Strictly speaking, there being nothing but a prefatory remark to the enumeration of the "generations," much cannot be expected in the way of duplicates, etc. 2) That the first clause of 37:2 is out of connection with what follows, is clear to every reader: "These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock, etc." To say the least, this is obscure. 3) However, if the analysis is followed, this formula is brought sufficiently near to the actual enumeration of the generations given in ch. 46. 4) That P should omit to tell us how Joseph was taken down to Egypt, is quite natural;, since, (1) the traditions of the other writers were well known, (2) it would require too much of the space which he reserves so tenaciously for statistics, (3) it would have compelled him to record many unpleasant facts about Jacob's family, a thing he is always loath to do.* 5) 41: 46b is a mere repetition of 45b; while 46a would fit better after verses 37, 38, or 44, than after 45. 6) On the other hand, it might fall in well enough with 37: 2a, especially if we take the . in qi'. (41:46) as waw adversative (to which there can be no gram- matical objection): "Joseph was seventeen years when with his brethren, etc.; BUT when standing before Pharaoh he was thirty years old." 6.

His brothers hate him, and decide to kill him. When he comes to them they cast him into an empty pit; but while they are at dinner a bedouin caravan, on its way to Egypt, passes by, and Judah proposes to sell him as a slave. They then kill a goat, and, dipping Joseph's mantle in its blood, make their father believe that his beloved son has fallen a prey to a wild beast. * Joseph is taken to Egypt and sold as a slave. Yahweh blesses him, and for his sake, his master; and he becomes his master's chief steward. Unfortunately his mistress becomes enamored of him, and finding that her love is not returned, slanders him to her husband, who casts him into prison. Here also he soon becomes a favorite, and makes the acquaintance of Pharaoh's baker and butler, who are imprisoned there. .... [These probably recommend him to their king after they are released.t] Pharaoh summons him from prison; and when Joseph tells him of a coming famine, and that provision should be made for it in the years of plenty which are to precede it, the king appoints him over all Egypt, second only to the king himself. Joseph stores away a great quantity of grain, so that Egypt is well provided when the famine begins." 3. THE LANGUAGE OF J. 1) OLD WORDs. (7) ff (38:16). (1) '1.~ 0':I7 ) It (37:25; 39:7).

STYLE OF J.t 1) It abounds in story and anecdote; e. g., (1) the brothers' jealousy; (2) their revenge accomplished; (3) the scheme to deceive their father; (4) the episode of Judah and Tamar; t (5) the passion of Joseph's mistress; (6) Joseph's meeting with Pharaoh's butler in prison; (7) the king's dreams; (8) the butler's recol- lection of his experience; (9) Joseph before Pharaoh; (10) the foreign slave becoming second to the king. 2) Easy and flowing. These stories, when disentangled from R's arrangement of material, are smooth and graceful. (1) Every event is complete in itself,i and at the same time naturally united with what precedes and follows; (2) details do not suffer because of any systematic plan; (3) how far this grace and ease affect the tone of the narrative, will appear under the following heads of description, etc. 3) It is vivid, descriptive and dramatic. (1) Many facts come out in conver- sation; e. g., (a) when Joseph relates his dreams to his brothers and father, and they reply (37: 5-10 = E); (b) when the brothers consult about the dream (37:19-22=E); (c) when Joseph's purity and integrity are referred to in his answer to his mistress (89:8,9); (d) in the case of Joseph and the royal prisoners (40:7-19 = E); (e) of Pharaoh and Joseph (41: 15-41). (2) Human nature is depicted: (a) a parent's partiality creates jealousy and hatred among the children (37:3,4); the brothers, jealous of the aspiring brother; the careful father, "keeping * The words or phrases in this numbered (1) to (5) occur nowhere else in the Old Testament; those numbered (6) to (8), nowhere else in the Rexateuch; those numbered (9), (10), rarely in Hexateuch. 1 J and E are considered together, so far as they agree. 5 The matter is cited in the order of chapters, not according to actual sequence of events. ? This favors the analysis; for as the narrative now stands, there are found too many incon- sistencies (as D'l'1 and YfitDW' in 37:28); besides, how could chap. 38 be placed by an author where we find it ? 11 Making some allowance, to be sure, for omissions due to the combination.</page><page sequence="5">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 5 the saying in mind" (37:11); (c) the father's extreme grief (37: 33-35); (d) rejected love turned into terrible hate (39:12-18); (e) Joseph's attempt to turn his conver- sation with the butler to his advantage (40:14-15); (f) "yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him" (40 : 23); (g) Joseph's modesty and piety in the simple answer, "It is not in me; God shall give an answer of peace, etc." (41:16). (3) Scenes presented: (a) Joseph seeking his brothers (37:15-17); (b) the passing caravan (37:25); (c) Tamar by the road-side (38:14sq.); (d) the Adullamite going around with the kid, inquiring for the harlot (88 :20-23); (e} the picturesque character of the dreams; e. g., Joseph's first dream is a "harvest scene; " the butler's dream, "the preparation of the king's wine; " Pharaoh "stands by the river" (cf. Ex. 7:15; 8:16). (4) Descriptive touches: (a) the father's love for his son finding expression in "a special garment" (37 :3b); (b) "they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him" (37:4b); (c) the brothers' first harsh act is "to strip off his coat, the coat which was the token of the father's love" (37:23b); (d) they sell a brother for twenty pieces (37:28); (e) "they sit down to eat" (37:25) while their brother is in the pit; (f) Joseph is surprised by his mistress, "while he went into the house to do his work, and there was none of the men of the house within" (39:11); (g) when the king summons Joseph, they make him run from the prison (41:14). (5) Space forbids the noting of circumstantial clauses. (6) Emphatic repetition of infinitives:' (1) ? f .i (37:8); (2) y~y ff y (id.); (3) 8} )  (37:10); (4) 1- ,A (37:33); (5) tf")J j] (40ca: 15). 4) Characterized by the presence of puns.

(1) "An Adullamite whose name is Hirah" (38:1); (2) Judah's father-in-law was Shua (38:2); (3) the name of his daughter-in-law was Tamar (38 :6); (4) Potiphar, a eunuch of Pharaoh (37:36); (5) Pharaoh surnames Joseph Zaphnath-paneah (41:45); (6) he gives him Asenath for a wife; (7) she is the daughter of Poti-phera.tt 6) Prophetic (not in the sense of prediction). (1) A parent's partiality leads to trouble in the family. (2) Jealousy and hate will lead one even to enslave (or kill) his own brother. (3) One sin leads to another; for having sold their brother, Jacob's sons must invent a lie to pacify their father. (4) Even when our nearest * In this connection, we may also notice the many verbs with a cognate accusative; as (1) D97, Di (57:5,9twice; 40:5,8; 41:11,15); (2) D'2 I7O (37:7); (3) "9 r0 (38:29); (4) D'11D 1"j) (41:34). This feature also is especially marked in this section, though of course found elsewhere, t The first three are J; the rest are E. * There are, however, many cases in which they might have been specific, but are not; e. g., in the names of (1) Judah's wife (38:2); (2) Potiphar's wife (89:7); (3) the prison-keeper (89:22); (4) the butler and baker (40:1).

(5) God is able to bring good out of evil (cf. 50 :20). (6) Small affairs may have important consequences: a quarrel between brothers leads to Israel's bondage. (7) All things work together for good to them who serve God and act uprightly. (8) God is the same in Egypt as in Canaan; etc. 5. THE MATERIAL OF J.* 1) The contents seem to show that chap. 88 is at least out of place. If in its original position, K'?0 nIY3 must refer to the time when Joseph was sold,tf and the events have taken place within the twenty-two years which elapsed before Jacob went down into Egypt; but consider (1) the difficulty of crowding into twenty-two years the marriage of Judah, the birth of three sons, the youngest removed from the oldest by many years (vs. 11, 12), the marriage of the eldest, his death, the marriage of the second to the widow of the eldest, his death also, a long interval during which Tamar waits for Shelah, Judah's intercourse with Tamar, the birth of twins; and (2) the improbability that Judah would leave his father under circumstances so sad, and marry a Canaanitish woman, an act looked upon with disfavor at all times in the patriarchal households.tf 2) It is not to be overlooked that, according to this chapter, the custom of the levirate is very old, antedating by centuries the law recorded in Deuteronomy; P would not have been guilty of such an anachronism. Other points, though of interest, may be omitted. C. The Element of E. 1.

SYNOPSIS. "Joseph* dreams that, while binding sheaves in the field, his brothers' sheaves surround his sheaf and pay it obeisance. He tells the dream to his brothers. They ask him, ' Shalt thou indeed reign over us ? ' He dreams again that the sun, moon and eleven stars bow to him. This also he tells to his kinsfolk; but his father rebukes him, though making a note of the dream, while his brothers are incensed against him. [Oncet], while seeking his brethren, a man finds him wandering in the field, and informs him that they have gone to Dothan; he finds them there. When they see him still at a distance, they plan to slay him and thus relieve themselves of his troublesome dreams. Reuben interposes, suggesting that they throw him into a pit, and not shed his blood. They take his advice; but Midianitish (not Ishmaelite) merchants, passing by, draw Joseph out of the pit and take him to Egypt. Reuben, returning to the pit and not finding Joseph, rends his clothes, crying out in despair. They send Joseph's beautiful garment [to Jacobt], and he mourns greatly the loss of his son. Joseph is sold by the Midianites to Potiphar, captain of the guard, one of Pharaoh's eunuchs. He is devoted to his master's interests and is well treated by him. Pharaoh, becoming angry with his baker and butler, puts them in the prison-house of the captain of the guard, who appoints Joseph to wait on them. They both dream in the same night, and Joseph, coming to them on the next morning, finds them troubled. Upon inquiring, he learns the cause of their anxiety. The butler tells his dream of the vine with three branches, from which he obtained wine for the king, and Joseph tells him that within three days he will be restored to his post. He at the same time requests him to mention his case to the king, since he has been stolen from the land of the IHebrews. The baker, encouraged by the butler's experience, tells how, in his dream, he was carrying three baskets on his head, with all sorts * The break here is not wholly due to the analysis; the introduction of Joseph is at best quite abrupt. ? This is to be supplied.</page><page sequence="8">8 HEBRAICA. of royal food in the uppermost one, from which a bird was eating. This is inter- preted by Joseph to mean that in three days the baker will be beheaded and his corpse eaten by birds. Though it came to pass precisely as Joseph foretold, the butler did not mention his name, but forgot him. Now Pharaoh has a double dream in one night which alarms him greatly; and since none of his wise men can interpret it for him, the butler tells him of the dreams interpreted by Joseph in prison. Joseph is called, and Pharaoh tells him how he first saw seven fat kine swallowed up by seven poor ones; and then, after waking up and going to sleep again, seven full and stout 'ears' of grain were swallowed by seven others that were extremely poor. Joseph informs him that it is a revelation from God, warning him of a seven-year famine which is to follow seven years of extraor- dinary prosperity and plenty. The repetition simply shows that the prediction is soon to be fulfilled; and he advises the king to appoint an able man who shall lay by provisions during the years of abundance sufficient for the terrible and pro- longed famine which will come afterwards. Pharaoh thinks that Joseph himself is the man for such a position, and he raises him to be ruler of Egypt, second only to himself. He changes his name to Zaphnath-paneah, and gives him Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera, priest of On, for a wife. Joseph accumulates an abundance of grain in every city of Egypt during the seven years of blessing. When the famine comes all the lands suffer; but Egypt opens her store-houses and becomes the market of the world." 3. LANGUAGE. 1) OLD WORDs.

But these are characterized both by their frequency (six in number: two of Joseph, two of Pharaoh, one of the butler, one of the baker) and their prophetic forecast. Their beauty and originality have been considered elsewhere. 5. MATERIAL. [J and E are here considered, compared and contrasted.] 1) Duplicates and differences. (1) The cause of disruption between Joseph and his brothers, according to J, is Jacob's partiality (37: 3sq.); according to E, it is Joseph's dreams (37:5-11a). (2) Verse 14 is practically a duplicate of 13; 18a, of 18b; and 18c, of 20a. Putting all these together, we seem to have two accounts of Joseph's going to his brothers by Jacob's order, and when they see him at a distance, of their deciding to kill him. But according to one account, he is sent to Shechem, where he really finds them; according to the other, he is informed on the road that they went to Dothan, and he meets them there. (3) There are two attempts to save Joseph's life: according to E it is Reuben who saves him, by advising to cast him into a pit; according to J, it is Judah, who counsels to sell him. (4) Joseph is carried off to Egypt: according to E, by Midianites, who steal him (cf. 40: 15a) from the pit; but in J, he is sold to Ishmaelites by his brothers. (5) 39 : 1 3 7 : 36, but with these differences: according to J, Joseph is sold by the Ishmaelites to an Egyptian; according to E, Potiphar buys him of the Midianites.t (6) According to J, Joseph is imprisoned by his "Egyptian master," because of some misunderstanding with his mistress; E knows nothing about it. (7) Consistently, then, J makes Joseph meet the * Words numbered (1) to (6) are found in no other connection; those numbered (7) to (18) occur nowhere else in the Hexateuch. + To explain this repetition as a mere "resuming of the thought" interrupted by 88, is hardly satisfactory; since (1) chapter 38 is not in its proper place; (2) a mere cue would not be so elaborate (the resuming verse being considerably longer than the original, account); and (3) Ishmaelites are not Midianites; (4) "YD N ' would never be inserted in explanation of Poti- phar, after having been introduced in 87:36. On the other hand, after R has misplaced 38 we should expect him to harmonize J and E by inserting "Potiphar, etc.," in 39:1.</page><page sequence="10">10 HEBRAICA. king's butler and baker as mutual fellow prisoners; but E puts the political offenders in the keeping of the "commander of the guard," who appoints Joseph to serve them. (8) How J brings Joseph before Pharaoh is not clear; we have at best but traces of this writer in chapters 40 and 41.* But from what we can gather it comes about in somewhat like the following way: Joseph meets the butler in prison, becomes acquainted with him, and tells him the story of his grievance; when the butler is released he remembers him to the king. The dreams, as usual, are E's; and since they make his account the more ingenious and dramatic, R gives only his account, making, of course, the necessary har- monies in verse 3b, etc. (9) Nor are we sure from J of the occasion that brought out Joseph's prophetic (or predictive) powers with regard to the coming famine. In E, of course, it is Pharaoh's dream. (10) But when we take up Joseph's advice to the king, resulting in his appointment, we again have duplicates (in 41) as follows: verse 30b (beginning with ?9fj) = 31, 33 = 34, 35a = 35b, 41 -+ 43b ? 44 = 40, one of which is J; the other = E. (11) In like manner, the remainder of chapter 41 presents the following repetitions: 48 = 49, 54b = 56a, which again betray the compound character of the story. 2) Inconsistencies. (1) The difficulty which Joseph's age (87:2) presents, when compared with previous material, was considered in our last section. (2) As to JE, some of the differences enumerated above, amount to inconsistencies; e. g., (a) AMidianites vs. Ishmaelites; (b) Reuben vs. Judah; (c) was Joseph sold, or stolen ? (d) was he a prisoner with, or a free servant of, the butler and baker? (3) Especially noticeable are verses 29sq. (in 37): they cannot go with the selling account; for why should not Reuben know of the transaction? But they do fall in with the stealing. 3) Omissions and combinations. (1) The omissions are quite few, and on the whole not very serious (cf. "synopsis" and "material" above). (2) The combina- tions made by R, on the other hand, are of a very pronounced character. 6. THEOLOGY. The following remarks will be sufficient: 1) This section has nothing particularly striking in its conception of God. (1) There are no unlikely anthropomorphisms; nor (2) any references to religious worship; nor (3) any familiar intercourse between the Deity and man. 2) Still God is near to man, and acting upon him directly. Note, (1) when Er and Onan are displeasing to Yahweh, he puts them to death (38:7b, O10b); (2) Yahweh is with Joseph (89:2,21a), and influences his masters to treat him well (39: 3,21b). 3) E lays great emphasis on dreams as coming from God (41:25,28,32); and in general the whole story tends to show the correctness of dreams. * See "analysis."</page><page sequence="11">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 11 4) The Rabbins held that City in 37:15,17 = angel. While not probable, it is not impossible, especially in the light of 32 :25b. At any rate, the episode seems to indicate that the man was at least providentially sent. XV.

MATERIAL. P's statistics seem inconsistent with the prophetic stories. (1) Understanding Genesis to be from one author, we have three generations in twenty-two years: Joseph, sold at seventeen (37:23), interprets Pharaoh's dream at thirty (41: 46a); i. e., the seven years of plenty began thirteen years after Joseph was sold; Jacob -and his family come to Egypt in the second year of the famine (45: 6a), or 22 - years after Joseph was sold; but during this time Judah marries, has three sons, the youngest becomes of marriageable age; then Perez is born (all this in 38), who in turn begets two sons before Jacob's entrance into Egypt (46:12). (2) 46:21 tells us that Benjamin had ten children on entering Egypt. But all through chapters 42-44, Benjamin is considered a child; see especially the following passages: 42 13, 20, 32, 34; 483 : 8sq., 29; 44 :2, 12, 20, 22, 23, 26, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34;. where he is invariably called "f3) or "j. 6.

Joseph, being at the head of the distribution of grain, his brethren come to him and bow before him. He recognizes them, and enters into conversation with them. .... In an inn [on their way back*], one opens his sack to feed his ass, and finds his money returned. He tells his brothers about it. [Having returned home*] and having consumed the supply brought from Egypt, their father tells them to go again and buy more food. But Judah objects that the Egyptian forbade them to meet him again unless they should bring Benjamin. Jacob replies that the boy must not go, since he is the only one now left; and if misfortune befall him on the road, he could not die in peace.t After some discussion Judah offers to go surety for the boy's safety, and the sorrowful father, though not without reluc- tance, consents to let his child go; but he advises them to return the money found in the sacks and also to take along a present for the man. They do as told, and present themselves once more to Joseph. IHe receives them with marked hospitality in his private house, ordering his steward to prepare for them dinner. They feel ill at ease, fearing that this extraordinary attention is only intended to entrap them. Accordingly, they approach Joseph's steward, and tell him of the strange incident on their way home, how each of them found his money in his sack. The man assures them that it must be a special act of providence, since he had received their money. When Joseph comes to the house they humbly offer him the present. He speaks kindly to them, inquiring about their father, and seeing Benjamin, he blesses him. Feeling the tears coming to his eyes, he steps into his private apartment and gives full vent to his emotions. Then, having composed himself, he returns and invites them to dinner. They are all well helped, but Benjamin receives special attention. After the feast, Joseph orders his steward to fill their sacks with grain, to refund their money, and to put his (Joseph's) silver cup in Benjamin's sack. In the morning, as they leave the city, the steward is ordered to overtake them and search for the stolen cup. They protest their innocence and offer to suffer the penalty, if found guilty. The cup is found, and they drive back to Joseph's house. They see the hand of God in the transaction, and they offer to give themselves up as slaves; but Joseph refuses to retain anyone except the thief, Benjamin. Judah comes forward and very touchingly describes the aged father's reluctance to let the boy go. He assures him that the father will die if the child fails to return; and so he begs to remain a slave in Benjamin's stead. Joseph, unable to restrain himself any longer, sends all strangers out of the house, and with tears tells his brothers who he is, asking them not to grieve because they had sold him. He tells them to inform his father of his position, and to bring him with all possible haste down * This is to be supplied from what precedes. + This is verse 88 of chapter 42.</page><page sequence="14">14 HEBRAICA. to Egypt.

Judah is sent ahead to lead the way for him to Goshen. Joseph comes in his chariot to Goshen, and after long separation, father and son meet.

(1) In general, the description of Joseph's meeting with his brothers, has no superior, from a purely literary stand-point in any fiction. (2) Conversations are true to nature; e. g., (a) Joseph's insinuating remark, "Ye are spies," and their answers, naive, but more and more implicating (42 : 9-16); (b) the description of their troubled conscience, "We are verily guilty, etc." (verse 21); (c) Reuben's "Spake I not unto you, etc.? " (verse 22); (d) the care taken in rehearsing their experience to their father not to represent "the man" as too severe, omitting thus his first proposition to keep all of them but one (verse 16), and their three-days' imprisonment, and adding that, if they prove true, he would offer them the trade of Egypt (cf. verse 34 with verse 20)-evidently desiring to make their father believe that there was no risk in sending Benjamin, and much to gain by it; (e) their explanation to Joseph's steward (43:18-23a); (f) their willingness that the thief should receive the severest penalty, so long as they are confident of their innocence (44: 9a), but when the cup is actually found, the proposition of slavery, not of death (44:16); (g) Judah's plea; (h) the condensed and passionate outbreak of Joseph, "I am Joseph; doth my father yet live?" (45:3); (i) in like manner, the joyful exclamation of the father, "It is enough, Joseph my son is yet alive," betraying emotion too deep for words; (k) Joseph's advice to his brethren as to what they shall say to the king;-all these intensify our interest, and give us insight into the very heart of the actors. (3) Scenes: (a) Joseph breaking down when he hears the conversation and repentance of his brothers (42:23sq.); (b) their dismay at finding their money returned (42:27-35); (c) the children prevailing on the despairing father to part with "his Benjamin" (43:2-14); (d) the men in Joseph's house, their gradual change of feeling from fear to the enjoyment of the feast (43:18-34); (e) caught on the road (44 :4-13); (f) the thieves before Joseph (44:14-34); (g) the disclosure (45:1-15).

SYNOPSIS OF CONTENTS. "Jacob, noticing that Egypt has grain to sell, sends ten of his sons to buy, keeping Benjamin at home. When they come to Joseph, he recognizes them, and recalls his dreams. He charges them with being spies. In their attempt to refute the charge, they tell him that they have a little brother at home. He asks that this brother be brought and their statement proved. After keeping them for three days in prison, he proposes to retain one as a hostage, while the others shall go to fetch their brother. Reuben reminds his brothers (in their own dialect, of which he supposes Joseph to be ignorant) how foully they had dealt with Joseph; and he, hearing it, turns away and weeps. He takes Simeon from them as prisoner, and tells his steward to put their money back in their sacks filled with grain. On returning home, they tell their father of their misfortune. But their fear increases when, on emptying their sacks, they find their money. Jacob is in despair about their taking Benjamin; but Reuben assures him that he would take care of him at the peril of his own two children; and so Jacob gives them his blessing and permits Benjamin to go. [When they come to Joseph again*] he releases Simeon and tells them who he is. They are greatly frightened; but he calls them to draw nigh to him, assuring them that he was sent to Egypt by God himself, to provide for them in time of need. He bids them hasten to Jacob and tell him of his son's success, and to bring him and his to Egypt. Meantime, the report of Joseph's brethren having come, has reached the king, who is greatly pleased, and bids Joseph send wagons to bring down his people. Joseph gives presents to each of his brothers, especially to Benjamin, and sends an abundance of Egypt's goods to his father. The old man can scarcely believe the good news; but being assured by their words and by the presents of Joseph, he goes to Beer-sheba, where he offers sacrifices to God. There God appears to him in a 'vision of the night,' and tells him not to fear to go to Egypt. He then proceeds with his children in the vehicles which Pharaoh sent." 3. LANGUAGE. 1) OLD WORDS.

Here only E's peculiarities are noticed.] 1) God appears to Jacob in a vision of the night (46 : 2a). 2) Jacob's name is repeated when God calls him (46:2b). 3) Worship in Beer-sheba is emphasized (46:1). 5. MATERIAL. Have we one or two accounts in the prophetic narrative ? 1) Duplicates. (1) 42 has the following repetitions: verse 2a = la; 6b = 5a; 8sq. = 7. While the first two do not interrupt the flow of the story, the last does. (2) Again, verse 27sq. tell of one discovering his refunded money in his bag, while on the way at an inn, and he tells his brothers about it. But in 35 they are as much astonished and frightened, when the money is found, as their father, who had not been informed of the experience at the inn. (3) It is difficult to see why Jacob should refuse Reuben, who offered his two sons as surety for Benjamin, and should accept Judah's bail, which was of a far less substantial character. Besides, in view of the existence of a Reuben-Judah duplicate in the early part of the story (37 :21 and 26), and of the fact that verse 38 (in 42) has the language of 44:29,31--the presence of thle double representation becomes quite conclusive. (4) In 45, 4b = 3a, and verse 13 = 9, while its connection with 12 is hardly natural. (5) We may also notice that in 4b-5a Joseph speaks of his brothers' selling him; while in Sb, 6 and 8 he says, "God sent me here." This point gains significance if we remember the double representation of stealing and selling in 87:28. 2) Differences. The differences more definitely indicated are therefore, (1) that, according to J, the restored money is found on the way at an inn; according *3</page><page sequence="18">18 HEBRAICA. to E, after reaching home; (2) that E consistently makes Reuben go surety for Benjamin's safety, while J, with still greater consistency, pushes Judah forward, not only (a) as surety (43:8sq.), and (b) as advocate (44:18-34), but also (c) as leader to Goshen (46:28); (3) that J consistently makes Joseph speak of his brothers' selling him, while in E he refers merely to an act of providence transfer- ring him to Egypt. 3) Omissions. Of course, in combining two accounts, whatever was identical, and there must, in the nature of the case, have been much, is omitted from the less interesting story. Thus we find, (1) the first visit of the brothers to Egypt is mostly E; (2) while the second trip is J, with traces only of E; (2) so also Benjamin's guilt and defense is purely J; (4) Joseph's disclosure of himself, on the other hand, is mainly E; (5) Jacob at Beer-sheba is E; (6) while his arrival in Egypt is J. 6.

As usual, it is marked by--1) Numbers. (1) Jacob arrives in Egypt at 130 years of age (47:9). (2) He lives in Egypt seventeen years (47:28a). (3) He dies at 147 years (47:28b). 2) Repetition. (1) The last clause of 49:28b adds nothing (five words out of twelve being superfluous). (2) The first two words of 49:29, as well as the last six (eight out of eighteen), are unnecessary. (3) Lest 29b would not sufficiently describe the grave of Jacob's ancestors, verse 30sq. give an elaborate history of "the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite." (4) One would think that after all this description, the place of burial would be known; but our writer in 50:13 repeats the story of the cave once more. 49 :32 is not mentioned, being unmistakably R's addition; but from the point of view of the unity of authorship this would furnish another interesting detail about the cave. 5. MATERIAL. 1) Duplicates. (1) Supplying the verse from the LXX. (which, being the more dicficult reading, by a well accepted canon of criticism is to be preferred to the Massoretic), we have a very awkward repetition of the arrival and settlement of Jacob's family, in 47: 5sq., as compared with the account immediately preceding (46:28-47:4). So awkward, indeed, that even the Massorites took the liberty of throwing out the most objectionable part and rearranging the rest. (2) 50:12sq. is another-and different-account of Jacob's burial in Canaan, from that given in 50:7-9. (2) We seem to have two accounts of Jacob's last testament about his place of burial, 47: 29sq. and 49: 29. 2) Differences. (1) According to one account (J) Joseph informs Pharaoh of the arrival of his kinsfolk; according to P (as given in LXX.) Pharaoh hears of it by rumor. (2) According to the prophetic story Joseph introduces five brothers * This is not supplied, but comes from 48:7</page><page sequence="20">20 HEBRAICA. (47:2); according to the priest's record, his father (47:7). This is almost a contradictionl: both cannot be true in the order given; for Joseph would most naturally introduce the father first, if at all. (3) J gives the land of Goshen as Jacob's dwelling (47:4, 6b, etc.); P speaks of the land of Raamses. [The latter expression occurs, however, only here in P. The LXX. has it also in 46:28b (= J). We may well suppose that the same place is meant by both terms (so Del. in loco); but for one writer to use them both in the same account would be strange.] (4) According to J, Joseph alone is instructed to take Jacob's remains to Canaan (47:29); according to P, all the children (49:29). (5) Each writer consistently gives the account of the burial according to the instructions: J says, "Joseph went up to bury his father '" (50:7a); while P tells, "And his sons did unto him as he commanded them; for his sons carried him, etc." (50:12sq.). (6) According to J, there would seem to have been some difficulty connected with taking Jacob's body to Canaan. For (a) Jacob made Joseph swear to do it; (b) Joseph gets the "house of Pharaoh" (= family or courtiers) to speak for him to the king; and (c) it is granted only as a personal favor to Joseph (cf. the instruction of Joseph to his brethren (50:25) to take his bones when God will take them out from Egypt; he could not be placed in his father's grave, though he wished it so ardently). But P, as usual, knows of no difficulties; Jacob simply requests his children, and they do as told. 3) Inconsistencies. In 47 :9, P tells us that Jacob was 130 years of age, when he arrived in Egypt. Compare, however, the following: (1) Esau married the objectionable Canaanitish women when forty years of age (26:34sq.). (2) Jacob (a twin brother of Esau, it will be remembered), soon after and because of this marriage, is sent to Paddan-aram (27:46-28 : 5). (3) He remains there twenty years (31:41) [i. e., on leaving Paddan-aram Jacob is sixty or more years of age]. (4) At this period Joseph was about seven years old, since he was born before Jacob began to serve Laban for his flocks (30:25-43). in which service he remained six years (31:41); this impression is further confirmed by 33 :7b. (5) Hence, when Joseph was sold at seventeen years of age (37:2), Jacob was a little over seventy. (6) But Jacob comes to Egypt about twenty-two years later, as is easily seen from 41:46,53sq. and 45:6. (7) Therefore, Jacob was only about ninety-three years of age when he came to Egypt; at all events, he could not have been more than 100. 6. THEOLOGY.

SYNOPSIS. "Joseph informs Pharaoh of the arrival of his father's family in Goshen, and introduces five of his brothers to the king, who inquires for their occupation. They tell him that they are by heredity herdsmen, and should like to settle in Goshen. Pharaoh grants their request. Joseph supports his father and family during the famine. In Egypt and Canaan this famine is very severe. Joseph extracts not only all the money and land for the royal treasury, but succeeds in establishing the law that Pharaoh should get one-fifth of all future products. As Jacob draws nigh to his death, he sends for Joseph, and causes him to swear a solemn oath that he will bury him in the grave of his fathers. As Joseph prom- ises to fulfill this his last request, Israel bows, and, sitting up in bed, calls for [Joseph's children*] to bless them. Now, because of age, his eyes had lost their sight; and although Joseph brings Manasseh to Jacob's right and Ephraim to his left, Jacob crosses his hands and puts his right on Ephraim's head; Joseph attributes this to his father's blindness. He tries to change the arrangement of his father's hands, calling his attention to the fact of Manasseh's priority. But Jacob informs him that he did it deliberately, since Ephraim is to be the greater of the two. Then comes 'Jacob's blessing' of his sons, each in detail; and after finishing this, he dies. At the end of the time given to mourning, Joseph asks Pharaoh for leave of absence, to go to Canaan to bury his father, according to his oath. Receiving permission, the entire family, and many Egyptians, proceed with Joseph to perform the last rites over Jacob's remains. On his return, he takes good care of his brothers and their families, as before his father's death." 3. LANGUAGE. 1) OLD WORDS. (5) K3 (47:4,29 thrice; 48:9b; 50:4 twice, 5).

(6) What could better describe Joseph's disposition, and the generous forgiveness of all the wrongs done him, than the simple touch, "And Joseph wept when they spoke to him," 50:17b ? 3) It takes the form of stories. Note (1) the difference between P and JE in describing Jacob's last moments (P=-47:28; JE = 47:29-48:2). (2) Jacob's instruc- tions about his burial (J = 47:29-31; P - 49:29). (3) The reception by Joseph's children of the last words of their dying grandfather (P, 48:5; JE,48:8-20). (4) The description of the last ceremonies over Jacob's remains (by P in his matter- of-fact style, 50:12sq.; but minutely and sympathetically by JE, 50:1-11); besides these, we have (5) Joseph's bargain with the Egyptians, 47:13-26; (6) Joseph's treatment of his brothers after Jacob's death, 50:15-21; and (7) Joseph's last days, 50:22-26. 5. MATERIAL. [Under J, as such, we consider only 49:1b-27, upon which the following remarks must suffice.] It is prophetic (in a more than ordinary sense) and very highly poetic, both of which facts exclude P from any claim to its authorship. On the other hand,. the claim of J has for its support (1) fi~f in v. 18; (2) the glorification of Judah, as seen in (a) the fact that the first three sons receive rebuke, indeed a cursing, rather than a blessing; (b) all the rest-except Joseph-receive only a passing remark, and that mostly in the nature of a tribal trait, rather than in the form of a direct promise of blessing and greatness; (c) Joseph indeed receives considerable attention, but when compared with such expressions as, "Thy father's sons shall bow to thee u" (thus making him the superior of all) and the promise of Judah's perpetual, if not everlasting, dynasty (v. 10), Joseph falls into comparative obscurity. 6.

Thus (1) 47:13-26, and (2) 50: 1-3, may be classed as JE passages. 2) Two passages are clearly E, viz., 50:15-21, which presents Joseph's char- acter in so beautiful a light; and (2) 50:22-26, which shows Joseph's prophetic insight, and records Joseph's death, giving to no other of the twelve such atten- tion. It is worthy of notice that the name of the Deity, occurring four times in these short passages, is invariably b)M . 3) For the prophetic portion of ch. 49, see under J, p. 23. 4) There remain, then, to be considered (1) 47:29-48:22, and (2) 50:4-11, the latter going with the account of 47:29-31. Now, 47:29sqq. is evidently J, as seen (1) by "language:" (a) K.*-; (b) fg*1 "fl; (c) fg b3 3)g?; and (2) by the mode of taking an oath (last clause in v. 29a; cf. 24:2b). Hence, also, 50:4-11 (besides some marks of its own) is rightly assigned to J. 5) Chapter 48 has P'fth six times, as follows: 9a,11,15 (twice), 20,21, which fixes these passages, at least, as belonging to E. But the composite charac- ter of this chapter is evident from (1) 48:1 = 47:29; (2) v. 8 says, " And Israel saw the children of Joseph," etc., while v. 10a tells us, "Now, the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see ;" (3) vs. 15sq. break the story of the "crossing of the hands," and an author would scarely have arranged them so; (4) v. 20a = 19 (containing a blessing already, in which the superiority of Ephraim is also emphasized); these facts seems to indicate two parallel accounts, each quite complete and consistent with itself. 6) With this as a basis, we may note next certain differences: (1) according to E, Jacob is sick in his last days; not so in J. (2) J alone has the story about Joseph's oath; (3) J alone has the anecdote about the "crossing of hands;" (4) according to E, Joseph only receives Jacob's blessing, no other of the children, as J gives in ch. 49; (5) what has already been noticed, Jacob's blindness is known only to J. 6.

"Jacob's family, cohsisting of twelve sons, or seventy souls in all, on their entrance to Egypt, multiplied there greatly. But being much oppressed by hard labor, they cry to God, because of their burdensome toil, and God heard them. Accordingly, God reveals himself to Moses, under the name of Yahweh, telling him of the covenant he had established with the patriarchs (to whom he was known as 'El-Shaddai), and that he had heard the cry of the children of Israel, whom he is to make his own people. Moses is then instructed to speak to Pharaoh about sending the children of Israel out of his land, to which Moses objects as being disqualified by some difficulty in his speech*.) Aaron is then made a spokesman between Pharaoh and Moses, who receives his instructions from God. They are told beforehand that Pharaoh will not listen to them until great won- ders and judgments be displayed in Egypt. Moses and Aaron do as instructed; their respective ages at the time being eighty and eighty-three years." 3. LANGUAGE. 1) OLD WORDS. 2) NEW WORDS. (1) 'l) = person (1:5 twice).

It is, as always, 1) Systematic, as seen from (1) the rbsum6 of Jacob's family, 1:1-5; (2) the careful use of D'f)M up to the statement in 6:3, and the equally regular use of * Here comes a sort of genealogy of Moses and Aaron, to which it is difficult to assign a place.</page><page sequence="27">THE PENTATEUCIAL QUESTION. 27 i?t, after it; (3) the statistical setting of the genealogy of Moses and Aaron, tracing them back to Israel, 6:14-26 ;* (4) the brief enumeration of Reuben and Simeon, which only leads up to Levi, upon whom he enlarges. 2) Exact, numerical: (1) "70 souls," 1:5; (2) "Levi lived 137 years," 6:16; (3) "Kehath lived 133 years," 6:18; (4) "Amram lived 137 years," 6:20; (5) "Moses was 80 years old and Aaron 83 years,"' etc., 7:7; (6) each family in the genealogical table begins with d) , and ends with lffit - . 3) Rigid, stereotyped; as seen in the expressions (1) * nD him, 1:1; 6:16; (2) "iji tCK'1 09 at the opening and closing of Moses' genealogy, 6:14 and 25b; (3) fflg f ~K summing up each subdivision, 6:14,15 and 19. 4) Verbose and repetitious: (1) l:lb is an awkward appendage, and absolutely unnecessary; (2) the rapid increase of the children of Israel is described thus, "they were fruitful, and increased abundantly and multiplied, and became mighty exceedingly exceedingly, and the land was filled with them," 1:7; (3) 2:24a adds nothing to 23b; (4) 2:25 adds little or nothing to what has been said; (5) 6:4b is unnecessary; (6) Aaron's wife was " Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, and the sister of Nahshon," 6:23 (cf. Gen. 28:9); (7) either 6:26 or 27 is wholly unnecessary. 5. MATERIAL. 1) Duplicates. (1) 1:12a = 1:7, both recording the wonderful growth of Israel; (2) 1:11 = 1:13sq., Israel's hard labor; (3) 8:7, as well as 8:9 = 2:24, God knows the oppression of his people; (4) 6:2sq. = 8:14sq., revelation of Yahweh; (5) 6:6sq. = 8:10-16, God commissions Moses to go to Pharaoh, etc.; (6) 6:30 = 6:12 (abso- lute identity). 2) Differences. (1) According to P, Israel's enormous growth .takes place before the oppression comes; according to E, after, and in spite of it. (2) As usual, P is generic: he describes Israel's work simply as hard; but E tells us that they built Pithom and Rameses. (3) In J (8:7), and in E (8:9), God sees the oppression as well as hears their cry (that is, he is near); in P, he only hears.* (4) According to P, God listens to Israel simply because he remembered his cove- nant with the patriarchs; but in JE, it is his compassion for their suffering. (5) According to JE, Israel is spoken of by God as his people (8:7,10); but in P, he is just about to make them his nation (6:7).* (6) From JE, it would seem that Yahweh was known as the God of the patriarchs (3:15); in P, this name is first revealed to Moses.* (7) P knows nothing of Moses' lack of faith; while the prophetic writers make much of it (8:11,13; 4:1-17). (8) P knows nothing of Moses' marriage, though mentioning the wives of Aaron and Eleazar. 3) Inconsistencies. While most of the differences may be explained as co-exist- ing facts, points (5) and (6) are fairly to be regarded as inconsistent. * Even if this passage be R in its present form and position, its basis is unmistakably P.</page><page sequence="28">28 HEBRAICA. 4) Cases in which R's work appears. (1) 1:13sq. would logically come (suppos- ing the material to have been the work of a single author), before 1:11; for, after they have once tried hard labor as a means of checking Israel's growth (1:9-11), "and to their disgust " found that "the more they oppressed Israel, the more he multiplies " (v. 12), it would be absurd for them to try the same means again (v. 13sq.). Besides, in this case, there would be no ground left for the command to destroy the infants (v. 15sq.). (2) What are we to understand by 2:23a, in the light of 1:8 ? Does it mean that the new king, the severe king died ? If so, why should the children of Israel groan over it ? It seems to refer to the king that did "know Joseph," who died before the new king. The passage, then, is out of place. (3) 6:2sq. naturally means that God introduces himself to Moses as Yahweh, a name by which he has never before been known. But what does that mean in the face of 3:15? Would a writer forget himself so in the same section ? Would he use such language and thus contradict a former statement ? (4) It is hardly necessary to show the misplacement of 6:13-28. It would seem to have been inserted there, in order to separate vs. 10-12 from 29sq., which are practically identical. 6. THEOLOGY. As usual, in P. 1) God is remote. (1) the cry of suffering goes up to him, 2:23 (cf. J, "I am come down to save him," 8:8); (2) he only hears of their suffering, 2:24 (JE, he sees it as well, 3:7 and 9); (3) he only speaks to Moses, 6:2,10; 7:1 (in JE he appears visibly, 8:2sq.). 2) God's revelation is formal. (1) his compassion is due to a promise made to the patriarchs, 2:24; 6:4sq.; (2) there is no familiarity between him and Moses: he simply orders; there is no sign, no persuasion, as in JE. 3) There is no indication of anthropomorphism: this needs no enlargement, [cf. JE under this head, p. 32.] 4) The covenant with the patriarchs is emphasized. In the prophetic writers there is no mention of it. B. Element of J. 1. VERSES ASSIGNED.

" ... tPharaoh hearing about it, and seeking to put Moses to death, the latter flees to Midian, where, at a well, he meets the daughters of the priest, [Hobab, son oft] Reuel by name. He gallantly defends the women against some rude shep- herds, and so, when their father learns of the fact, he receives Moses hospitably, and finally gives him his daughter Zipporah, who bears Gershom. [Moses sees a great vision@], and as he turns to look at it, Yahweh tells him that he has seen the trouble of his people, and heard their cry, and that he is about to deliver them from Egypt and to bring them to a goodly land, even Canaan. Moses is accord- ingly sent to the elders of Israel, to whom he is to tell these good tidings. He ob- jects that they will not believe him; but Yahweh turns his shepherd's rod into a serpent; then he makes his hand leprous and restores it again; signs which are to serve as convincing miracles. And after this if they should not believe, Moses is to overcome their unbelief by turning water into blood. Moses offers his difficulty of speech as another excuse, but he is reminded that he who sends him gives and takes away speech at his own good will, and again he is ordered to go on his mis- sion, taking his rod with him. [The king of Egypt having died, and the troubles of his people increasinglil], Moses takes his wife and children and goes back to Egypt.

They believe and thank Yahweh. Then Moses and Aaron go to Pharaoh, and in the name of Yahweh bid him let the people go out for a religious feast in the desert. Pharaoh refuses to comply, since as he says, he has no knowledge of Yahweh. He makes the labor of the people all the more difficult, that they may not turn their attention to illusions of relief. The people naturally complain that Moses has made their bondage worse, and Moses, in turn, asks Yahweh why he sent him on a mission, which seems to result in greater oppression to the nation ?" 3.

"Joseph dies, as well as his brothers and that entire generation, and a new king, who knows nothing of Joseph, arises over Egypt. Alarmed at the rapid growth of the foreign element, he subjects the children of Israel to hard slavery. But nothwithstanding this, the nation multiplies greatly; the king then has recourse to the Hebrew midwives, and instructs them to kill every male child as soon as born. They, fearing God, find an excuse to let the children live, so that Pharaoh is forced to command all his subjects to throw every new-born boy into the river. A certain man of the house of Levi marries a daughter of Levi, who gives birth to a beautiful boy. She keeps him hid for three months; but, not being able to hide him longer, she places the child in a box, and puts it in the bulrushes at the water's edge. His sister is set to watch the infant's fate from a distance. Pharaoh's daughter, accompanied by her maids, comes to bathe, and, noticing the box, sends her servant to fetch it. She has compassion on the foundling, and, through his sister's ingenious intervention, he is given to his mother to be nursed. When grown, he is adopted by the king's daughter. One day Moses visits his brethren, and sees an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew. He slays the oppressor, and buries him in the sand. Next day, he tries to settle a quarrel between two Hebrews, and one of them, in his rage, charges Moses with murder; Moses at once apprehends the danger of his position, . *. As he was pasturing the flocks of Jethro, the priest of Midian, his father- in-law, he led his sheep to Horeb and there an angel of Godt appears to him in a burning bush which was not consumed. God calls him from the bush and informs him that the place is sacred, and then tells him that being the God of the patriarchs, he has not failed to see the oppression of the children of Israel; Moses is to go to Pharaoh and to lead them out of Egypt. If his own people will not believe his divine mission, he is to tell them that Yahweh, their forefathers' God, has appeared to him. He is to take the elders along, and with them go to Pharaoh, and ask for permission to make a three-days' journey in the wilderness. But while Pha- raoh will not let them go until God's hand has been seen in Egypt, when they do go, they will have plenty of riches, borrowed from the Egyptians. Moses is also to take his rod along with which to perform miracles. He takes leave of his father- in-law, and with the wonderful rod in hand [sets out for Egypt.l]$ The people believe him, but Pharaoh, when asked permission to make a three-days' journey in the wilderness for the purpose of holding a religious festival, tells Moses and those who are with him, to attend to their own affairs and not to disturb the people in their labor. He orders the overseers to withdraw straw from the people, * Here, according to Dill., is a serious break.

[J and E are here considered together.] 1) Remarks. (1) It is freely admitted that the prophetic portion of this section does not show very distinctly, or even satisfactorily, a double authorship. (a) There are no duplicate stories (i. e. in a full form); (b) the language also is but a poor guide, owing probably to R's influence; (c) not even the names of the Deity are to be relied on implicitly, being freely intermingled. (2) We may, therefore, expect- what is actually the case-to find the greatest variation of opinion among critics. So, for instance, Kuen. and Kitt. pronounce the analysis of JE in the early chap- ters of Exodus, at least, almost impossible. (3) Still it must be remembered that all the critics find sure traces, more or less pronounced, besides long pas- sages clearly belonging to either writer. (5) Note also that P is very marked, when contrasted with JE, which argues at least for that much of an analysis. We may now examine the material more closely. 2) Duplicates. (1) 3:7sq. is the same, in thought at least, as 3:9sq., both tell- ing that (a) God heard the cry of his people; (b) and saw their oppression; (c) and so wishes to take them out from Egypt. (2) 3:11-15 contain, in brief, the elemental ideas of 4:1-16, both relating (a) Moses' reluctance to accept his mission; (b) God offering a sign (or signs) to assure him; (c) Moses objecting that the people will not believe; (d) God assuring him that they will be convinced. (3) 5:1 = 5:3, in fact, the latter would not mean much to Pharaoh, after he has denied any knowl- edge of Yahweh. (4) 5:5 is an awkward, unnecessary repetition of 5:4. 3) Inconsistencies. In 2:18, Moses' father-in-law is called Reuel; while in 3:1 and 4:18, his name is given as Jethro.* Are we to suppose with the Talmudft that he had seven names ? 6. THEOLOGY.

SYNOPSIS. (1) "Yahweh instructs Moses and Aaron that, if Pharaoh asks for a sign, Aaron shall cast down his rod before him, and it shall become a serpent. This is done; Pharaoh's magicians do the same, and, although Aaron's rod swallows theirs, Pharaoh's mind is not affected. Then (2) Aaron is commanded, through Moses, to turn all the water of Egypt into blood. But the magicians imitating also this wonder, Pharaoh's heart is again hardened. Once more, (3) Yahweh's order comes to Aaron to bring up frogs upon the land of Egypt; but since the magicians are able to do this, Pharaoh remains obdurate. Another plague is sent (4), that of the lice, and though the magicians admit their inability to do any- thing more, Pharaoh is unmoved. Again (5) Yahweh's word comes to Moses and Aaron, that they take ashes which Moses is to throw towards heaven and thus transform them into boil-producing dust. In this case, the magicians are completely overthrown, the malady attacking them as well as all other Egyptians. But now (6) Yahweh himself hardens the king's heart, in order to multiply his wonders in Egypt. Then come minute regulations concerning (a) the Paschal lamb [12:1-10]*, which the people follow out as directed by Moses and Aaron [12: 28]; (b) those qualified to partake of this sacrifice [12:43-49]; (c) the feast of unleaven bread [12:14-20], with which the people comply, as directed [12:50]. (7) The narrative then proceeds: 'Now, the sojourning of the children of Israel which they sojourned in Egypt was 430 years [12:40,41a]. And it came to pass at the end of 430 years, that Yahweh brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt [12:51] by their hosts.' " 3. LANGUAGE. 1) OLD WORDs. (3) ?Z3?

(1) It will be noticed that the new words in this section are strictly legal expressions; P's historic vocabulary has been exhausted long ago. (2) We find here also three "a?r Lry6[Leva,* (a) plt. (written also incorrectly bity ) 7:11,22; 8:3,14; (b) r,' 9:8,10; (c) DYff) 9:9 10; but they seem to be due to the technical precision of the author (see the connections of each). 4. STYLE. P, as usual, is 1) Systematic. (1) In Aaron's contest with the magicians, we should notice: (a) Aaron begins with a wonder merely (not.a plague), turning a rod into a ser- pent; then comes the plague of blood (affecting the water), that of the frogs (affecting the land), that of the lice (attacking man and beast, but externally), and finally that of the boils, (the most horrible of eastern plagues, breaking out in man and beast); (b) the first three are imitated by the magicians; at the fourth, they acknowledge "God's finger;" at the last, they are themselves attacked by the dis- ease and flee; (c) up to the last, Pharaoh remains obdurate, but when attacked by boils, he evidently would have yielded, had not Yahweh hardened his heart. (2) The real climax of the history is the institution of the passover feast, the only law given "in the land of Egypt," 12:1. This can be seen (a) from a comparison of the amount of matter given to each: while the entire narration (including the account of the exodus) contains but twenty-five verses, the details about the feast occupy twenty-nine verses (not counting 12:11-13, which belong, perhaps, to JE); (b) from the emphasis laid upon the keeping of the feast, 12:15b and 19b,20. (3) The laws of ch. 12 are systematically arranged (cf. last part of "synopsis," p. 36). * Not used in other connections, even when repeated here.</page><page sequence="38">38 HEBRAICA. (4) The entire section of "wonders" closes (11:9sq.) with a phrase similar to that which serves as an introduction (7:3-5). 2) Minute, exact. (1) Moses is to "stretch his hand over the waters of Egypt, over their 'rivers,' over their 'streams,' and over their 'pools,' and over all their 'ponds,'" etc., 7:19 and 8:1. (2) Moses and Aaron are to "take handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and throw them toward heaven in the presence of Pharaoh, that they may become boils breaking forth in blains,"' etc., 9:8sq.

(1) 7:10b adds nothing, after the minute orders in vs. 9; (2) 0l9 ? 'f9ll 9 in vs. 11 might be omitted; (3) the "waters of Egypt" are specified as "streams, rivers, pools," but lest this would not be enough, it is summed up in "all their ponds of waters," 7:19; (4) 8:13 is unnecessary, except the first two words; (5) 9:10 could have been disposed of with the customary "and they did so;" (6) in view of 7:3sq., 11:9sq. is superfluous; (7) 12:2b = 2a; (8) 4b is unnecessary; (9) the last clause in v. 15 means little; (10) 17b is needless after v. 14; (11) vs. 18-20 are unnecessary after v. 15; (12) all of v. 14 is useless: 40 - 51 gives everything; (13) 48b and 49 are useless after all the preceding details. 5. MATERIAL. 1) Duplicates. (1) 7:9 starts out as if there never had been any thought of showing wonders to Pharaoh; yet 4:21 has a special command to perform all the wonders, which God has entrusted to Moses, before Pharaoh. (2) The strange phenomena of the "rod turning serpent" appears here as something entirely original, a representation which could hardly have been made by the writer of 4:3. (3) 7:19 has the air of a perfectly new order about the plague of blood, not appearing as if it had just been mentioned in v. 17. (4) Nor does this verse connect well with the execution of the order as given in 20bsq.: the command is to stretch the hand on every body of water, great and small, that they may become blood; whereas only the river (= Nile) is smitten, and its water turns to blood. (5) 21b is a clumsy addition, if not inconsistent with 20sq.; while it connects perfectly with 20a. (6) Verse 23 is a repetition of 22b, such as is not found elsewhere after the same or similar formula, which invariably ends the paragraph (except 10:28sq. coming after 27; see below), as in 7:13; 8:11,15,28; 9:7,12,35; 10:20; 11:10, nine times in all. (7) The same thing is true of 8:1-3: (a) it does not seem to imply</page><page sequence="39">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 39 2:26-29;*t (b) and it does not go with 8:4. Why Pharaoh should call Moses and Aaron and ask for their prayers to Yahweh, when his own magicians show that they have the same power as the Hebrew God, is incomprehensible. (8) Assum- ing that we have one author writing of the ten plagues, we meet with a peculiar fact: seven of these have warnings, while three, (those relating to lice, boils and darkness) come without any notice. As a matter of fact, however, it has been seen that the commands relating to blood and frogs have nothing to do with their preceding announcements; hence 8:12-15, as well as 9:8-12 are perfectly regular, illustrating the general rule that in P, God's commands are formal and direct. (9) 12:21-27 cannot be considered simply Moses' repetition of God's order (12:1-14) to the people, because the instructions here given are fewer and different (see under differences, below) from those. It is apparently another account. 2) Differences. Having, then, double accounts before us, we may notice the following important variations: (1) In the prophetic account, Moses is to perform the wonders before Pharaoh without waiting for Pharaoh to ask for them, 4:21; in P, Aaron is to do them, at the request of Pharaoh, 7:9. (2) It is to be observed that P uses the word 9,j- sea-monster (Gen. 1:21) instead of mn. serpent as the animal into which Aaron's rod passes. But whatever the creature, it would be strange if the same author were to use yfi), everywhere except in this one sec- tion, 7:9-12. (3) In the plague of blood we have already observed the difference in extent, P having every collection of water (even "in wood and stone " = [probably] artificial wells and cisterns or vessels), while J and E restrict it to the Nile; the latter tell also of the "dying of the fish," of which P knows nothing. (4) In the case of the frogs: J brings them from the Nile, 7:28; P, from "streams, rivers and ponds," 8:1. (5) P has in all his "wonders " something about the magicians, developing an interesting contest between the future high-priest of Israel and the hierarchs of idolatrous Egypt; while the prophets do not know of them at all. Nor is this phenomenon due to any arbitrary division. Assuming a single author, how is it that only four of the ten plagues are connected with magicians ? Why is it, that after the lice, two plagues are mentioned (those of the flies and murrain) without a word about the magicians, and that all at once, in speaking of the boils, we are again reminded of them, and that for the last time ? (6) In the laws about the passover, without noticing the many omissions in the second account, such as (a) date of selecting and killing the lamb, (b) age and sex of the animal, (c) mode of cooking, etc.-all of which were of practical importance to the people who were to observe these instructions-the condensed(?) account contains one detail ("$ f?Xt * j'" ) which cannot be considered a mere omission from the fuller and more detailed one. * The Hebrew division of chapters is followed. t The definite article in D'917.DY; is not used as implying the promised frogs, since the gen- eric article would be used. Cf. D'V f~_Y in 7:27, where they were not mentioned before.</page><page sequence="40">40 HEBRAICA. 3) Inconsistencies. (1) Some of the differences mentioned above amount to incongruities, such as (1), (3) and (4). (2) 11:9 says, "that my wonders may be multiplied," etc., while 11:1 says "yet one more plague will I bring," etc. As a matter of fact, after the death of the first-born (11:4-8), nothing was done in the "land of Egypt.'" 4) R's free arrangement: (1) Many of the passages mentioned under dupli- cates were seen to be unrelated, such as (3), (4), (5) and (7). (2) 11:9sq. could not possibly have been put in a more misfitting connection than where it is; it contradicts (see above) what precedes, it has nothing to do with what follows.* (3) But the greatest confusion is found in ch. 12: (a) vs. 11 would fit in better after 8 or 9; (b) vs. 12sq., if they belong in the laws at all, should follow v. 7; (c) the stereotyped v. 28 does not belong with 27; (d) v. 42 means little, and has no connection with 41; (e) v. 51, besides being identical with 41b, has no relation to what goes immediately before or after. 6. THEOLOGY. 1) God's revelation is formal and stiffly sublime: (1)He orders Moses and Aaron to do a certain thing, and " they did so." (2) His orders are usually the simple fiat: (a)"let it become a serpent," 7:9; (b) "let them become blood," 7: 19; (c) "let it become lice," 8:16; (d) "let it become dust....and it shall be for boils," 9:9;t (3) He does according to his will, without warning Pharaoh of his plans. 2) God's manifestations and interventions come only when absolutely neces- sary: (1) No miracle is shown, except when Pharaoh demands one, 7:9. (2) Each succeeding plague comes only because the preceding one did not touch Pharaoh's heart. It is only after the last plague (of boils) that Yahweh hardens the king's heart, and for that there is no punishment (as in the prophetic story). (3) It would seem that God did this in order that the exodus might be due directly to his intervention, and not to Pharaoh's subjection. 3) God is remote from man: (1) He enters into no negotiations with Pharaoh; so long as he knows the king is obdurate, he sends his plagues without intermis- sion or question. (2) On the other hand, he does not torment or vex Pharaoh, as in the representation of J. 4) The importance of Aaron is emphasized: (1) Aaron is invariably associated with Moses, and in all the plagues but one (the last), does the work. (2) Even in receiving the divine orders, Aaron is mentioned in the first two (6:13; 7:8), and the last two (9:8; 12:1). 5) The passover in Egypt is the first sacrifice recorded in P; it receives all possible emphasis. * Well.: the Massorites have made a paragraph of these two verses by themselves. + Cf. JE, "the rod that was turned into a serpent," 7:15; "they will be turned into blood,"' 7:17.</page><page sequence="41">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 41 B. The Element of J. 1.

SYNOPSIS "Yahweh speaks to Moses: 'Since Pharaoh's heart is hard, meet him on the river's bank, and tell him that, in order to let him know that I am Yahweh, I will turn its water into blood.' Seven days after, Moses is again sent to Pharaoh to warn him that, if he does not liberate Yahweh's people, the Nile shall swarm with frogs which shall penetrate everywhere. Pharaoh promises to allow the people to go to sacrifice to Yahweh, if he will only remove the frogs. The next day, at Moses' earnest prayer, the frogs perish; but no sooner is relief given than Pharaoh again becomes obdurate. Again Moses is told to meet Pharaoh at the water, and to demand Israel's release; and if this is not granted, troublesome insects (flies) will settle on Egypt, but not in Goshen, in order to show the distinctive nature of the penalty. Next day the threatened affliction comes, and the land suffers greatly. [Pharaoh] asks again for prayer, and Moses confidently promises that to-morrow the plague will be removed. But this time also, though relieved, Pharaoh fails to keep his promise. Once again Moses is sent to announce a mur- rain of all the domestic beasts of the Egyptians, while the Hebrews lose none. Pharaoh, learning this fact, refuses to send away the people. Again Pharaoh is warned of the approach of a very heavy hail-storm, which will destroy every- * This analysis seems hardly satisfactory from any point of view.

Some of the Egyptians, fearing Yahweh's word, shelter their cattle; while others heed not, and when the calamity comes, everything in the fields is destroyed. Goshen alone escapes the storm. Pharaoh now acknowl- edges his guilt, and asks again for prayer, which Moses promises, though knowing that the repentance is not genuine. [But when the hail ceased*], Pharaoh and his court harden their hearts as before. Then Moses is sent to announce the plague of locusts; this announcement makes Pharaoh's court yield (10:7). Next morning, the insects come like clouds, and lay waste all that had remained after the hail. Pharaoh now summons the Hebrew leaders in haste, acknowledges his sin, and humbly begs forgiveness and intercession with Yahweh. The wind which brought the locusts is turned in the opposite direction, and not one of them is left in Egypt. Pharaoh summarily dismisses Moses, threatening him with death, if he ever dares to come into his presence again. Moses, however, is not at all discon- certed; he had already the message from Yahweh to deliver, concerning the death of the first-born.* Having told the monarch that his servants would at midnight come to urge the people to depart, Moses leaves the palace in anger. [In the mean- time, the people are instructed through their family-heads to prepare the passover lamb, and to sprinkle its blood on the door-posts that Yahweh might know their houses and pass over them when smiting Egypt.] At midnight, Yahweh strikes down all the first-born, high and low, and even of the cattle. A great alarm pre- vails in Egypt, and the Israelites depart hastily,* having borrowed silver and golden vessels as well as clothing from their Egyptian neighbors. Also many strangers(?) and much cattle go up with them. Not having had time to prepare food for the way, and their dough not having had time to become leaven, they bake unleavened cakes." 3.

[We notice this point the more because (a) the prophets describe similar events to those of the priest, and (b) certain elements in each story are, so to speak, constant; such as 1) the sending to Pharaoh; 2) the warning; 3) the result on Pharaoh's disposition.] We observe, then: (1) Moses is told to meet Pharaoh, sometimes at the Nile, often simply in his court;* (2) even the solemn warning has quite a number of variations;* (3) Pharaoh's obduracy is thus varied: (a) " Pharaoh went to his house, neither did he lay even this to heart," 7:23; (b) "But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart,"t 8:10a; (c) "Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also," 8:28; (d) " The heart of Pharaoh was stubborn," 9:7; (e)" he and his servants hardened their hearts," 9:34; (f) "Pharaoh orders Moses to leave him, and never see him again," 10:28; (4) The execution of the orders, instead of the rigid formula, "And they did so," usually has a brief description of the act; but never an exact repetition of the command. 2) Vividness. Although there is not what may be strictly called a story in this material, there is the light and sprightly tone which characterizes prophetic narra- tive. (1) Conversation enlivens the story: (a) Moses' warnings, see 7:16sq.,25-29; 8:16-19; 9:1-5,13-19; 10:1-6; 11:4-8; (b) his negotiations with the king after each plague, as 8:4-7,21-25; 9:27-30; 10:8-11, 16sq.,24-26; (c) even the law of the passover is given in connection with the announcement of the death of the Egyptian first-born, and of the Hebrew escape, 12:21-27. (2) Human nature is well illustrated: (a) Pharaoh promises when in trouble, but withdraws the promise as soon as relief comes; (b) some souls were timid enough to shelter their * It would take altogether too much space to point out these shades of variety in detail, which such a small point would not deserve. But the reader in the original, if he be at all criti- cal, cannot help noticing them. t It should be noticed that J uses 1f3 , where P uses pTn , for hardening.</page><page sequence="44">44 ITEBRAICA. cattle, 9:20; (c) Pharaoh's servants would fain get rid of the troublesome Israel- ites, 10:7. (3) "Repartee " even is noticeable in Moses' retorts: (a) to the ques- tion, "Who are they that shall go ?'" the reply is, "'Young and old, sons and daughters, flocks and herds," 10:8sq.; (b) to Pharaoh's proposition, "Go all of you, but leave your flocks and herds." Moses says, "Thou must also give into our hand sacrifices, that we may sacrifice unto our God!" 10:24sq.; (c) when ordered "never to see Pharaoh's face again," he answers, "Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more," etc., 10:28sq. + 11:4-8. (4) Note also the following particularizations for the sake of emphasis and vividness: (a) "I will smite with the rod which is in my hand... and the water shall be turned into blood," 7:17 (the idea being, that though by so simple an instrument, this strange thing will be accomplished); (b) in P the command is simply to "bring frogs upon Egypt," 8:lb; but it seems much more vivid, when we are told, "The frogs shall come into thy house and into thy bed-chamber and upon thy bed....ovens and into thy kneading-troughs; and they shall come upon thee ..." 7:28sq; (c) in a similar way the plague of flies described, 8:17; (d) the murrain is greatly enlarged by the specification of "horses, asses, camels, oxen, and sheep," 9:3; (e) the Egyptian darkness becomes frightful indeed, when we learn that "they could not see one another, neither rose any from his place for three days," 10:23. (5) Descriptive touches: (a) the Egyptians' actually digging for water, depicts the desperate sit- uation as no words could, 7:24; (b) the enormous number of frogs could not better be shown than by noting that "they were gathered together heaps upon heaps, so that the land stank," 8:10; (c) what could be a more poetic description of terrific lightning than "fire running down unto the earth" 9:23 ? (d) could all the num- bers of P give us such an idea qf the multitude of locusts, as does the phrase, "they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened" ? 10:15 [cf. Joel 2:2]; (f) the darkness must have been very great, when "it could be felt," 10:21; (g) the change in Pharaoh's attitude which the last plague is to bring about, is well described, "after that he will utterly thrust you out hence altogether," 11:1; (h) the universality of the plague of the first-born, is poetically told in the words "from the first-born of Pharaoh that sitteth upLon the throne even unto the first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill," or "unto the first-born of the captive that was in the dungeon" (note the variety), 11:5; 12:29; (i) the freedom of Israel from calamity is shown thus, "Not a dog shall move his tongue," 11:7. 3) Dramatic presentation. [While the prophetic material is essentially the same as that of P, the latter's characters act in a mechanical way, the order is stereo- typed: Moses is charged to bring a plague; Aaron executes the order; the magi- cians try to work the same wonder; Pharaoh remains obdurate. Animation, on the other hand, characterizes even this, the most common-place of the JE sections.] Note, e. g., (1) the progressive change in Pharaoh's attitude: from (a) utter</page><page sequence="45">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 45 indifference (7:23), he comes (b) to offer permission to serve God in Egypt (8:21); (c) he then allows the men to go into the desert (10:11), but being still further pressed he would (d) hold back only the cattle (10:24), until finally (e) he gives full, unqualified liberty (12:31sq.). This, of course, is according to E; but even in J, the following development is noticeable: from simply (a) asking for prayer (8:4,24), he begins (b) to acknowledge his sin (9:27) and (c) to beg for forgiveness (10:17).* (2) What a vivid picture is presented in ch. 10! (a) Moses and Aaron come to Pharaoh's court, and boldly demand the freedom of their nation, threat- ening a most destructive invasion of locusts, if this is not granted; (b) they depart, and the courtiers advise the king to let the people go, since his refusal brings ruin to Egypt; (c) the Jewish leaders are brought back, and a diplomatic negotiation ensues; (d) but since they, firm in their faith in God, flatly refuse all compromise, Pharaoh rudely drives them out; (e) next morning, Egypt is envel- oped in a cloud of locusts, and the king hastens to beg pardon and to ask for prayer; (f) but no sooner is the plague removed, than he orders Moses out of his presence, under penalty of death. (3) The vivid picture of the "last night in Egypt," as given in 12:29-34, would furnish a theme for an artist's brush; we shall not attempt to point out the details. 4) Anthropomorphism. [Cf.

But the point here is that in P, there is no real advance made as regards the exodus, the real point at issue; Pharaoh is obdurate from beginning to end, without the slight- est shadow of change, not even the language in describing his obstinacy being varied. Then, again, at last, when we expect the king to yield, nothing of the kind happens. Yahweh simply intervenes, and leads the people out by omnipotent command.</page><page sequence="46">46 HEBRAICA. 2. SYNOPSIS OF CONTENTS. "Moses, in accordance with his warning to Pharaoh that God* would pollute the river, strikes it with his rod, in the presence of the king and his court, and its water turns into blood and its fish die; the Egyptians cannot use the water, and are compelled to dig wells near the river to obtain drinking water. ([When this was followed by another plaguet], Pharaoh offers to let the people sacrifice to their God in Egypt. But Moses insists on a three days' journey in the wilder- ness, on the ground that the Egyptians would not allow animals (which they worship) to be slaughtered before their eyes$). Again, instructed by God,% Moses stretches forth his rod toward heaven, and a terrific hail and thunder storm, inter- mingled with heavy lightning, breaks out, destroying herb and tree, as well as the ripening flax and barley. But as the late wheat and rye are undamaged, Pharaoh takes courage and does not let Israel go. Still Moses and Aaron are again brought before Pharaoh and he asks them, 'Who of the people are to go ?F Moses distinctly answers, ' We must all go; young and old, male and female, man and beast.' The king in a threatening tone offers to let the men go, and rudely dismisses them. So Godli instructs Moses to stretch out his hand and bring a plague of locusts over the land of Egypt. At the waving of Moses' rod, an east wind brings the locusts, which destroys all vegetation in Egypt. This time God|| hardens Pharaoh's heart, and he will not let Israel go. Then Egypt is enveloped in thick darkness for three days, while in the quarters of the Hebrews there was light. Pharaoh calls Moses, and offers to let all the people (including children) go to serve God.l but their flocks and herds shall remain. Moses taunt- ingly replies,' Thou must give us offerings for our God, our cattle must accom- pany us.' Pharaoh is unwilling to yield. Moses is told that the exodus is near: one more plague, and Pharaoh will drive them out. He is, therefore, to instruct the people to borrow from their Egyptian neighbors silver and golden vessels, for which Godll gives them favor in the eyes of the Egyptians. God's promise is fulfilled: [the first-born die?], and Pharaoh sends in the night to tell Moses and Aaron to take the children of Israel with all their effects and go to worship as they wished. The Egyptians hasten to send the people for fear they may all die. Israel moves to Succoth,** six hundred thousand strong, besides children and strangers." * There is no formal mention of D ; in fact, flfl' prevails. ?

[See under J, p. 43.] 5. MATERIAL. This may be indicated in the form of remarks: 1) In general, the prophetic writers in the early portion of Exodus, as was the case in the first 20 chapters of Genesis, are so closely combined as to be scarcely distinguishable. 2) In this section, the name of the Deity is exclusively I it ,* which must have been substituted by R in all the E passages; or else, even E uses this name in this section, on the streigth of 3:15, where Yahweh is revealed, 3) According to Kuenen (i.. p. 150(?)), in the first eleven chapters of Exo- dus. RJE not only interwove the documents, but constructed a narrative of his own on them as a basis only. 4) As this hypothesis explains the great variety of opinion that prevails among critics; it also helps us to understand that, at best, we may find but traces or partial stories, of each writer. These traces are determined by the usual mode of investigation adopted hitherto, viz., of repetitions, differences, etc. 5) Of repetitions, the following points may be noticed: (1) the proper name, "Pharaoh " is repeated in such close proximity in 7:14 and 15, as to attract atten- tion. In all subsequent dealings with the king, his name (or title) is mentioned but once, and afterwards some pronoun; but here it reads, "the hleart of Pharaoh is stubborn, he refuses to let the people go; get thee to P'haraoh," etc. It would appear that the last phrase is from a different source. (2) 7:24b = 21a2. (3) 9:24a -= 23a3. (4) 9:25b is awkwardly consolidated with 25a; for (a) it would be almost an anomaly for the prophet to add, " And the hail smote every herb of the field aid brake every tree of the field," after the general statement, "And the hail smote throughout all Egypt all that was in the field;" anrid (b) the repetition of 1"0" is very strange. (5) 9:31sq. are evidently a different version of 9:25; for * The only place where D';I7K occurs is 8:15 [= P], in the expression "God's finger." But since it is in the mouth of the micgkiatns, it would seem to mean nothing more than "super- human," without reference to the "God of the Hebrews."</page><page sequence="48">48 TIEBRAICA. (a) they do not go with v. 30; it would be absurd for Moses to mention such facts; (b) after the general statement of 25a, and the particular one in 25b, vs. 32 would be almost a contradiction. (6) 10:13b = 13a -+ 14a. (7) 10:15b = 15at. (8) The writer of 11:8 would not consistently make Pharaoh send for Moses (12:31), but would probably represent him as going to him in person. In fact, 12:30 begins in that strain, but seems to be interrupted by the other account. 6) Points (5) and (8) above, may be considered not only as duplicates, but also as different representations of similar facts. 7) Two plagues have but one prophetic version: (1) the frogs were sent only according to J, (2) darkness came only according to E. This assignment is sup- ported by the following facts: (a) the first goes with the warning in 7:26-29, which bears the stamp of J; while (b) the second falls in with the gradual yield- ing of Pharaoh (see 10:24, in comparison with 10:10sq.); then (c) the three days of darkness, would properly belong to E. 6. THEOLOGY OF THE PROPHETS, The following remarks will suffice: 1) God enters into negotiations with Pharaoh; "if he does not send," etc., the plague comes; Yahweh does not seem to know the result until Moses has conferred with the king. 2) Moses is perfectly sure that Yahweh will do as he desires him to do; cf. 8:5sq.,25; 9:29. 3) Yahweh seems to take especial pleasure in displaying his power: (1) He almost always foretells what he is golng to do, 7:17,27; 8:17; 9:2sq.,18; 10:4; 11:1; (2) He often appoints the exact day, and even the hour, when his promise is to be fulfilled, 9:5,18; 10:4; 11:4. 4) Most of the miraculous plagues are more or less due to natural agencies: (1) the blood is only in the Nile, which often turns red; cf. P, who makes all water, even in artificial basins, turn red; (2) the frogs come from the Nile, their natural home,* 7:28; (3) the flies are simply sent, not created like the lice (8:12sq.), and we know how common such visitors are in the East; (4) a murrain of cattle, destructive hail, locusts, and even darkness, are more natural and common than "a few handfuls of ashes which become boils;" (5) a wind blowing for twenty-four hours bring the locusts, 10:13. 5) Yahweh encourages stealing (at least plundering) goods of the Egyptians, which are to be gotten only by lying, 11:2sq. Moreover, the asking for a three days' journey only (8:23) was, under the circumstances, not an honest request. 6) The necessity of indicating the Hebrew houses by blood upon the door- post, is hardly compatible with the idea of an omniscient Deity. 7) Passover is barely mentioned, as a commemoration of the last plague, 12: 25-27. [Mazzoth, also, and the setting firstlings apart, in 13, are only memorials.] * P makes Moses bring them, 8:1.</page></plain_text>
