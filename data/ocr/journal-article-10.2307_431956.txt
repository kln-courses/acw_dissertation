Robert Smithson should be seen as an American poet. Dedicated to diffusing the voracious visualities of the modernist artist and viewer, dedicated to free- ing art from its conceptual dependence on the reign- ing narratives of art history and ameliorating the rule of the museum, Smithson attempted to break out of the modernist mold by substituting endless plays of mirrors leading nowhere for the open, optical spaces of the modernist canvas, earth for acrylic, desert for city, and site for sight. Always in search of the liminal, where time slows to the point of cessa- tion and the figure of man disappears before the oth- erness of nature in its great, terrifying sweep and its inexorable entropy, Smithson did not follow Thoreau (whom he in many ways recalls) into the quiet bogs and waters of New England, but sought instead po- etry in the vastness, the emptiness, the sublime in- difference to the human, a poetry found in those places where nature evacuates both object and place. Concerned to show the vast expressions of modernity as so much rubble contained in so many mauso- leums, he searched for a nature inhospitable, indeed uninhabitable, a nature whose central force is size and destructiveness, which, in an act of reversal, would reflect the inhospitability of cities and strangely open itself to the habitation of the self. As if culled from the pages of Kant, it is both the math- ematical and the dynamical sublime that converge in a number of his locations (Utah, the Yucatan, etc.), and no doubt he shares with so many other American poets (most of whom grew up on the east coast) an auratic sense of the American west, as if that land- scape were tailor made to fill the bill of a vast other- ness posed in opposition to city, civilization, and museum in which the self would be given space to re- think its relation to its form of life and room to be born. Whereas the Whitmanesque vision of the west is that of a landscape whose open availability is what enthuses the American ideals of newness and power, the Smithsonian vision is not that of the land as sub- lime emblem of national emergence but instead of space in a permanent state of otherness to that vision of modernity and the institutions that comprise it. Smithson's space signifies the end of America, the end of its art, its museums, its culture of avant-garde life, not in the sense of its Telos but in the sense of that which will silence it, disturb it, show it to exist in a state of permanent alienation and impermanent grandiosity. Thus the entropic force of the natural site, its capacity to destroy the very artwork Smithson builds on it, becomes crucial as an antidote to the claim to eternalization and hence visual/cultural per- manence contained in the museum and in modern narratives of progress. The Spiral Jetty is now under- water, the shed Smithson placed on the Kent State Campus in a clear reference to Thoreau's Walden house-Smithson even names its cost, ten thousand dollars, to recollect Thoreau's recounting of the cost of building his house ($28.12 and a half cents)-is desiccated. And Smithson himself is dead, acciden- tally killed surveying one of his projects at the age of 35-the Mozart age. All art perishes before the fact of mortality, sooner or later, and Smithson's view of</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 79 time is as long as the desert is wide. John Cage once said that the point of his silent work was "a training in mortality": to acknowledge mortality by emptying time of all else but silence and placing a full stop on the claim to eternity basic to modern art and life. The entropic also preaches (for this is the quietude of modernist religion speaking against modernity in the name of mystery) that in the end we are part of nature and therefore essentially mortal, and that the avant- garde politics according to which nature requires domination (those of Mondrian and Corbusier par ex- cellence) are nothing less than politics which turn cities into deserts and museums into houses for the stuffed carcasses of birds whose natural history is thereby obliterated-as clearly obliterated as the mu- seum drains the life from the obelisks, temple carv- ings, and sculptural masks it imports from the colonies in the national interest. It is clear that Smithson aims for a reflective cri- tique of modernity and a transformation in modern personhood. It is also clear that such gestures require a concordance of writing and composition, for a site by itself, however eloquent, cannot occasion such lev- els of reflection without a project of writing to back it up. And with this artist we have a very special con- cordance of the writer and the maker of works. Al- ready a philosophical autodidact in gel, Smithson had absorbed the writings of structuralism, psychoanaly- sis, American poetry, and modernist criticism and set them to use in the thinking about his art. Unfailingly lucid, and with an instinct for the kind of pithy re- mark that rings in the head, Smithson is that rare writer whose words not only resonate with his com- positions to the perfection of both-each informing, deepening, respecting the integrity and presence of the other, each refusing to turn the other into a mere supplement-but whose words are nearly as interest- ing as the compositions themselves, and sometimes more so. What fortuitousness that this fine-tuned cor- respondence between writing and composition finds its third term in a philosopher/aesthetician with an ear and sensibility as beautifully harmonized with Smith- son's oeuvre as Gary Shapiro's is. It is as if Shapiro were brought into the world so that Smithson might get the articulation he deserves and Shapiro might find a site of earth and world to which he could bring his capacity for careful and direct listening and his knowledge of twentieth-century philosophy. Never one to prattle on with the abundance of theory that one so often finds in contemporary art writing, every concept Shapiro brings to the study of Smithson ei- ther deepens Smithson's philosophical vocabulary, or it connects Smithson's critique of modernity (the mu- seum, art history) to similar trends in the philosophi- cal critique of modernity, mostly exhibited in Heideg- ger and poststructuralist writings. Shapiro invariably hits the mark in the manner of a philosophical smith playing son to the artistic Smith, himself a "son" of William Carlos Williams (who was his pediatrician in New Jersey). Smithson's work always raised the question of why it had ever been made in the first place, of the violent act of its displacement (by bulldozers), while also seeking its home or Heimat in these very materials. Earth was thus anthropomorphized (as "home') while also kept in a state of total "otherness" to the work, a component utterly "indifferent" to the art into which it was made. Shapiro points out that this simultaneous state of affordability and resistance is in fact what de- fines "earth" in Heidegger's philosophy of art. When "earth," Shapiro claims, is demythologized from its role as Heidegger's site of Parsifal and the "earth mother"/peasant who is the origin of German identity and broad enough to wear van Gogh's shoes, earth shimmers with the sublime. For its indifference to the artwork into which it is molded (yet in which from another perspective it can also continue to "be it- self"), its formlessness and unconnection to the hu- man, renders earth uninterpretable in its "mere mate- riality": a full stop to Kant's "harmonization of the faculties," a density and power inviting a sense of our meaningless before it. When drained of its ready-to- hand modes of interpretation and use, the work re- duces to earth (to mere materials) and appears both wholly deflated (it is only after all a spiral in the desert muck) and wholly mysterious. The presence of a work which exists in the liminal condition of being "more than earth" yet also nothing more than it, brings up the utter strangeness of the work as such. "That the world is" is the mystical, Wittgenstein will tell us. In this liminal condition, the work allows us a breathing space from the web of meanings compris- ing modernity, museums, cities, and avant-gardes. In- deed we find ourselves strangely at home in its god- forsaken space, for in being obliterated by the expanse of the site we find that pattern of meanings through which we live now appears as if utterly con- tingent, and hence our existence strikes us as utterly free. No doubt there is illusion in this sublime experi- ence of freedom, for we finally have no clear route of escape from the entire framework of concepts and practices in which we live and think, and certainly the museum will not, in spite of Smithson's visionary efforts, suddenly appear to everyone as nothing but a mausoleum for corpses. In the end we do not know what art is apart from the museum; it is as simple as that. So art terminates in the museum in spite of everything. The disturbational modern artists, of which Smithson is one and John Cage another, must conform to the norms of avant-garde modernity to break them apart, must rely on the institutions of modernity to render them under a different gestalt.</page><page sequence="3">80 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism Smithson piles on words to empty art of them; he uses the museum to challenge it-and ends up being shown in it. Thus the disturbational artist ends up car- rying the very modernity forward which he or she aims to disrupt; that is what Foucault calls the hegem- ony of discourse. Shapiro is keen to point out that, from this perspective, Smithson's site art is nothing if not the intrusion of modernity onto nature with its tractors and its construction sites. Yet Smithson's work does not fit comfortably into the museum (which can only carry documentation of the sites), and its liminality is genuine, if not revolutionary. This makes it, paradoxically, both modern and prehistoric, which Shapiro also tells us. What Shapiro's book on an earth artist lacks, if anything, is a fully elaborated discussion of nature: of nature as the object of science and nature in its mean- ing to us today (to a diverse group of contemporary subjects and communities). Nature today is inevitably turned into a mere supplement to city life, culture, national identity, and the like (nature as theme park, nature as vacation land, nature as nostalgia in the great film Bladerunner). Nature is an object to be mined (oil fields) or a place to be occupied (by hous- ing developments). It is in the history of art a site for anthropomorphism (landscape as metaphor, as lyri- cal background, as Jackson Pollock's unconscious mind). And nature is always European/Western na- ture (try finding the natural landscape of Southern Africa or of Utah "picturesque"). These uses of nature or co-optations of it always raise the question of na- ture as it is in itself, a question which immediately breaks down into: 1) nature as the object of science, 2) nature as otherness, 3) the biodiversity of species as an argument in philosophical morals. I shall say nothing about the first and the third of these, but in- stead note that in Smithson's work, nature is hardly "as it is itself," for its otherness makes sense only as an otherness to modernity. Such a use of nature hardly keeps nature pure, as Mark Tansey has quipped in his fantasy/painting of Native American tribes gazing in stupefaction at Smithson's Spiral Jetty as if to ask: What has this to do with the nature that we know and travel every day of our lives? What has it to do with us? We might ask this very question: What then does nature have to do with us? What ought it have to do with us, therefore, what can it have to do with us? Or more abstractly: To what does the concept of nature amount? It is perhaps this question which above all renders Smithson's work philosophical, maybe in spite of it- self. And it is a great gift of Shapiro's book to have so thoughtfully brought us to the brink of this question, one which aesthetics used to ask in the eighteenth century, and one which has become as displaced from our own philosophical museum of aesthetic theory as Kant's own work has-and apparently has not!-be- come. What then is nature and what does it have to do with art? DANIEL HERWITZ Department of Philosophy University of Natal</page></plain_text>
