<plain_text><page sequence="1">ORIGINAL SIN SAMUEL S. COHON, Hebrew Union College, Cincinnati THE doctrine of original sin, which in varying forms figures in Jewish as in Christian thought, derives its vitality from the raw facts of life, and involves both the nature of man and the justice of God. The Bible exalts man as the child of God, stamped with His image and likeness. He is but a little lower than the angels, crowned with glory and with honor. He is capable of deeds of mercy and compassion to the point of complete self effacement. He often sacrifices himself upon the altar of truth and of goodness. He also shows himself base and cruel, exhibit ing traits of savagery that would shame the beasts, and sinking to abysmal depths of degradation. His self-centeredness and his antagonism to others blight his own life and fill the world around him with sorrow. He delights in sadistic pleasures, and employs his gifts of mind to inventing fiendish instruments for the torture of his fellowmen. He aspires after God, and he goes the way of the devil. He strives after freedom of the spirit, and seeks to widen the horizon of truth and of justice. He builds centers of light and of healing to redeem the helpless and the forlorn. He also erects prisons for the human intellect, and darkens the world with falsehood. He constructs torture chambers and hor ror camps for the extermination of his fellowmen. He uses the richest fruits of knowledge for the "scientific" destruction of the minds and bodies of infants and greyheads. How can we account for the frightful malignity which ap pears to fester at the core of human nature? How does man come to create yawning pits of hell in the heart of civilized soci ety? And why are his finest intellectual achievements turned into threats to his own existence, and his hopes perpetually blasted? Why does he, the child of God, erect barriers between himself and his Father, and blind himself to the visions of truth, 275</page><page sequence="2">276 SAMUEL S. COHON [2] of goodness and of holiness? Being so general in every age and in every country, human depravity, it is claimed, cannot be charged to individual guilt. Some condition common to all mankind must be responsible for the corruption of human nature. Parsism and Manichaism resolved the difficulty by their dualis tic conception of the universe. The principle of evil ever contests the principle of good for the government of the world. Man's depravity is the natural effect of the struggle between Ahriman and Ormuzd. From the standpoint of monotheistic religion, seeking to establish the unitary rule of creation, the problem is more difficult. Is not God, the author of all existence, responsible for His creatures? Does not the evil nature of man reflect upon the goodness and omnipotence of God? Christianity, following certain trends in Judaism, advanced the view that the moral taint which mars human nature is not in reality the work of God, but the result of a tragic error com mitted by the first parents of the race. Through the teachings of Paul and Augustine, this view was crystallized into the doc trine of the Fall and Original Sin, which, despite some opposition, became pivotal in Western Christianity. Judaism similarly grappled with the problem of the universality of guilt, without assigning to it the importance which it occupies in Christianity. 1. The Paradise Story The focus of all theological speculation on this subject is Genesis chapter three, which may be regarded as one of the most influ ential biblical chapters in human thought. Contrary to the uses made of it by Paul and his followers, the Paradise story con tains no doctrine of the fall of the race through Adam, of the moral corruption of human nature, or of the hereditary trans mission of the sinful bias. It represents an aetiological myth, accounting for the origin of human labor, for the natural abhor rence of man for the serpent, for the consciousness of sex, for the pains of parturition, for the subjection of woman to her husband, and for human mortality. It seems to form part of a legendary history of civilization from the Jahwistic viewpoint, and must</page><page sequence="3">[3] ORIGINAL SIN 277 be read in connection with Genesis 4 and 11, which deal with the invention of the arts, the progress of civilization, the building of the tower of Babel and the variation of the languages of man. The interest of the ancient thinker centers primarily in the physical ills of mankind, and he seeks their explanation in reli gious causes. He links the pains of life with the thirst for knowl edge of the beneficial and the hurtful, i. e., the knowledge that gives man mastery over nature, from the standpoint of the nascent ethical religion of Israel. The story is related to the myths of primitive peoples in various parts of the world, dealing with the mystery of death, and assumes like them that man would have been deathless if he had not committed a disastrous blunder. In some instances the most trivial incident suffices to explain the origin of death.1 Jahweh's jealousy and his apprehension lest man become like "one of us," imply a polytheistic background of the Paradise story. We naturally turn for parallels to Semitic mythology. While no exact parallels have come down, there are some ele ments in old Babylonian literature that are instructive. A very slight resemblance to it appears in the Etana legend, which tells of a hero who sought to obtain something that would ease the pains of parturition of his wife. He was carried by an eagle to the heaven of Anu. On the way he changed his mind and decided to go back to earth. Both he and the eagle fell down together to their death to the ground.2 The only resemblance to the biblical story consists in dealing with the pain of child birth. As to whether the indecision of the hero, which brought death upon himself and the eagle, also initiated the mortality of all men is not indicated in the legend. The Sumerian legend of Tagtug comes closer to the biblical tale. It contains a description of the primeval paradise, Dilmun, which included Eridu in the mouth of the Euphrates. (Some interpreters consider it to be a description of the earth prior to 1 For an analysis of Gen. 3 and 6.1-4 'n the light of primitive lore see Samuel S.

COHON [4] the bestowal of civilization upon mankind by Enki). Enki "de creed for ever the fate of the plants" of Dilmun. A list of trees is named which Tagtug may eat. S. H. Langdon supposes that a line followed regarding a forbidden tree from which he was not to eat. Tagtug broke the taboo, and brought upon himself the same curse as Adam did by partaking of the tree of knowledge. The problematical nature of this interpretation is apparent, and Langdon himself warns that it must be accepted with caution.3 Somewhat more definite and closer to the biblical narrative is the myth of Adapa. One version of it figures as an incanta tion for the healing of the sick. It implies that the disease, which the magician endeavors to heal, was caused not by the sin of the patient, but by Adapa, who brought death and pain into the world in an age when sorrow was unknown in Paradise. The story runs that Adapa of Eridu, famed as a sage, was endowed by Ea with godlike wisdom, enabling him to "perceive the things of heaven and earth," and with a cunning mind, to "give names to all concepts on earth," but withheld immortality from him. One time as he went fishing, the south-wind drove his sailing boat into the wide sea, ducked him under, and made him sink to the dwelling of the fishes. In his anger Adapa broke the wings of the south-wind so that it did not blow for seven days upon the land. Thereupon Anu, the king of the gods, ordered that Adapa appear before him. Ea clothed him in mourner's garments, and counselled him that on arriving at the gates of Anu, he should explain to Tammuz and Ningishzida that he mourns the dying gods of fertility. They will look at each other in aston ishment and pleasure, and speak kind words on his behalf to Anu and thus win for him Anu's good favor. At the same time Ea impressed upon him that when standing before Anu, he will be offered "bread of death" to eat and "water of death" to drink, which he must refuse. Thus Ea's jealously showed itsef. He does not wish Adapa to obtain immortal life, and therefore deceived him by misrepresenting the food and the drink, which were in reality the magic food of eternal life. Ea also advised Adapa that when the gods offer him a garment he shall put it 3 The Mythology of all Races, Vol. V. Semitic, p. 200.</page><page sequence="5">[S][S] ORIGINAL SIN 279 on, and with the oil that they shall offer him he shall anoint him self. Consequently, when Adapa refused the food which would have made him an immortal, Anu ordered him back to earth, deprived of eternal life. Langdon remarks that this doctrine regarding the way in which mortality became the lot of mankind "arose in the ortho dox priesthood as a defence of divine providence, when a Baby Ionian school of philosophers challenged the ancient teachings of the Sumerians, who held that the gods are good and just. It was not they who sent disease and sorrow into the world, not they who created man to die, but pain and mortality originated in the ignorance of a great ancestor, tricked by the jealousy of a god, and so passed forever the great opportunity of mankind."4 Though the two stories are markedly different in form, they combine a number of common features. The jealousy of a god is the motif in both. The gods of fertility, Ningishzida and Tammuz, figure in one, and the serpent which in Sumerian mythology serves, as the symbol of fertility and is associated with the fertility gods, in the other. Finally both of them ex onerate the gods from creating the evils which plague life and trace it to a blunder on the part of an early hero. Obvious similarities to these stories are found also in the Greek legend of Prometheus. The form, in which it came down in Hesiod and in Aeschylus, represents a fusion of a number of stories. The account of Prometheus, deceiving Jove's wisdom and stealing fire from heaven for the benefit of man, and only bringing him evil, is combined with the independent tale of Pandora, the first woman, from whom descended the "pernicious race, and tribe of women." Jove gave women as "an evil" to men, "helpmates of painful toils."5 Aeschylus pictures Prome theus as stealing the fire from the cruel Zeus out of sympathy for the wretched lot of men, and teaching them many arts whereby they might advance from their savage animal life to civilization. Though completely different from the Paradise " Ibid., p. 183. 5 "Theogony," Bohn's Classical Library, pp. 585 ff.; "Work and Days," pp. 52 ff.</page><page sequence="6">280 SAMUEL S. COHON [6] story, it shares with it the thought that the ills of human life stem from man's overstepping the bounds of humanity and invading the domain of the gods. Both stories consider knowl edge as wrenched from the deity, jealous of human encroach ment, whether by a superhuman being or by a crafty animal. Both of them further imply that human knowledge is a kind of arrogance, and "see in v/3pts the primal sin."6 The Pandora legend bears obvious similarity to the story of Eve in picturing the first woman as the source of human woe.7 These remote parallels throw some light upon the Genesis story. What was Adam's sin? It consisted not merely in his breaking the divine command but, in breaking it in such way as to overstep the limits of his humanity and to encroach upon the domain of Jahweh, an idea which recurs in the Bible. It re appears in the story of the building of the tower of Babel (Gen. i11.1-9) and in the prophets (Isa. 2.7-22; 10.12 ff., 33; 14.13 ff. ; 22.11; 37.23 ff.; Ezek. 28.2 ff.). Deut. 29.29 voices the thought that some secret things pertaining to the future may be known only by God. Job 28.12-28 exalts wisdom as "hid from the eyes of the living" (Cf. 21.22; 38.16 ff.). The author of Proverbs glorifies it as the possession of God, His special delight and the instrument of His creation, which, at His pleasure, He discloses to men (3.19-20; 8.22-32; 2.6).8 The breaking of the taboo led to no fundamental alteration in the moral condition of Adam and Eve, but only to their acquisition of a sense of shame at being naked in place of their original state of blissful ignorance and childlike innocence. Furthermore, this sense was awakened in them not in conse quence of their new born consciousness of guilt, but as the magic effect of partaking of the fruit of the tree of knowledge. The transgression, we are told, was followed by the pain of child 6 F. R.

On the contrary Jahweh admits that the disobedience made them godlike. "The man has become like one of us." He attained the condition that exclusively belonged to the gods. While the biblical story does not specifically state that Adam was created immortal, it implies that he was capable of becoming immortal. To forestall his appropriation of the next attribute of of deity — immortality — by eating of the tree of life, Jahweh expelled him together with Eve from Eden, and inflicted punish ment upon all three participants in the offence. The story does not suggest that Adam's sin was transmitted to his descendants or that it in any way accounts for their tendency to sin. The Jahwist source indeed emphasizes the general diffusion of moral evil (Gen. 4; 6.5-8, 12; 8.21; 9.20-27; 11.1-9). However, this condition prevailed at a particular time, and did not perma nently vitiate the nature of man. The Jahwist concerns himself with the origin of death and suffering rather than with the origin of human sinfulness. That he also reflected upon the gravity of sin is not to be denied. He conceives of sin as a power external to man, and personifies it as a beast "crouching at the door" (of the heart?). Sin is trailed by suffering. It is not an isolated act, but a state of conscious ness, so that one sin leads to others. The author's despairing view of human nature is reflected in his statement that "Jahweh saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually" (Gen. 6.5); and again that "the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth" (8.21). He does not assume the responsibility for his offsprings' disposition to evil, but only states it as a sorrowful reflection on human nature. These verses subsequently served the Rabbis as biblical support for their doctrine of the Yezer, but they establish no connection between the sin of Adam and the disposition to evil. Generally the Jah wist document treats sin as "a voluntary act or a habit resulting from such acts."9 י Tennant, ibid., p. 98.</page><page sequence="8">[8] 282 SAMUEL S. COHON What use was made of the Paradise story in the rest of the Bible? The answer is: hardly any. The Jahwist himself does not seem to have connected it with the rest of his narrative. Cain's sinfulness is not treated as an inheritance from his parents, for his brother Abel was well pleasing to Jahweh. His guilt and responsibility are distinctly his own. He is warned that "sin croucheth at the door, and unto thee is its desire." While it lurks for its prey, "thou mayest rule over it" (Gen. 4.7). So too the curse of Lamech followed his own guilt rather than the hereditary taint of his forefather. Likewise, the increase of wickedness, which brought on the flood, was not linked with the transgression of Adam. All that may be said is that Adam's transgression was the first manifestation of sin, but not the cause of the sinfulness of his offsprings. The Elohist portrays Noah as perfect and righteous, who, like Enoch, "walked with God," indicating that the corruption which spread before the flood represented a bad condition of the time rather than the normal state of humanity derived from Adam (Gen. 5.24; 6.9-12). The Priestly document, too, nowhere intimates that the divine image, with which Adam was marked, vanished at the fall. All sources present Abraham as a man of stainless character. The prophets denounce sin, not as a hereditary infection, but as the fruit of man's moral vacillation and failure to recognize the sov ereignty of God and to do His will. Jeremiah bemoans the weak ness of the human heart and its deceitfulness ( 17.9 ; cf. 7 ; 31.26 ff. ; Ezek. 18). The suffering of the people during the Exile accentu ated the consciousness of guilt, both of the nation and of the individual, in view of the growing recognition of the solidarity of the community, on the one hand, and of personal responsibility on the other. Job stresses the impurity of man, the creature, by the side of God, the Creator (4.17; 14; 15.14-15; 25.4). Prov. 20.9 muses that "there is no man that sinneth not" (also I Kings 8.46; II Chron. 6.36; Eccl. 7.20). The Psalmist meditates: "If Thou, O Lord, shouldst mark iniquity, 0 Lord, who shall stand?" (130.3; also 143.2). Ps. 51.7 confesses the frailty of human nature: "Behold, I was shapen in iniquity And in sin did my mother conceive me."</page><page sequence="9">[9] ORIGINAL SIN 283 He does not suggest the sinfulness of the act of generation, but rather the general instability of the race of humans, who are prone to sinfulness from the very womb (Cf. Isa. 6.5; 43.27; 48-9; 57-3)•I0 That he does not imply that an ineradicable taint attaches to human nature is evident from the sequel in which he assumes that man may enjoy the state of spotless purity. Hence he prays for Divine forgiveness, and pleads: "Greate me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me." The allusions, which some commentators found to Adam's sin in Hos. 6.7; Isa. 43.27; Job 31.33 and Ps. 82.7, are without scientific foundation." A vague tradition about the Garden of Eden and its guarding cherubim figures in Ezek. 28, which like the Genesis story, reflects Babylonian mythology. It is referred to as a "divine abode" and a "garden of God," i. e., a private reserve of God on some mountain in the North (also 31.8, 9; cf. Isa. 14.13; Ps. 48.3). Ezekiel's Eden, it has been suggested, resembles the mountain of Mashu in the Gilgamesh epic, which contained a tree, bearing costly stones, "dazzling the eye" (cf. Ezek. 28.13-16, also Gen. 2.12): "Diamonds (?) it bore as fruit, Branches were hanging (down?), beautiful to behold. Crystal (antimony?) the branches bore."" Ezekiel compares the prince of Tyre, boasting of his divinity, proud of his wisdom, riches and glory, to a legendary dweller of the Garden of God, whose clothing was adorned with precious 10 T. K. Cheyne, The Book of Psalms, ad loc.\ Z. P. Hayyes, Perush Mada'i:Mada'i: Tehilim, ad loc. " Equally groundless is the supposed reference to Adam's wisdom in Job 15.7 f. It probably refers to a legend about the first man acquiring wonder ful knowledge by virtue of his access to the council of God; cf. Jer. 23.18; Ps. 89.8. The name Garden of Eden, in Isa. 51.3 and Joel 2.3, the figure "tree of life" in Prov. 3.18; 11.30; 13.12, and the related "fountain of life" in Ps. 36.10; Prov. 10.11; 13.14; 14.27 are mere verbal elements coming from the same stock as the folk tale in Genesis. Similarly Job 34.15; Ps. 90.3; Eccl. 12.7, which speak of man's return to dust, and Isa. 65.25; Micah 7.17, which allude to the serpent's eating dust, express common beliefs and do not necessarily point to the Genesis story. Neither does Eccl. 7.29 point to the change of char acter that set in because of the fall. 12 Tablet IX in Harper, op. cit., pp. 344-45; Tennant, op. cit., p. 63.</page><page sequence="10">284 SAMUEL S. COHON [10] stones, and who, on account of his over-bearing, was expelled from the divine abode. While the phraseology of this chapter contributed to the later portraiture of Adam and of Eden, it indicates no direct dependence upon Gen. 3. Furthermore, the theodicy of the Bible completely ignores the fall. The suffering of the righteous is nowhere justified on the ground of the sinfulness transmitted by Adam to his pos terity. Job, dealing with the relation of sin to divine retribution, ignores the Paradise story, indicating that at the time of the composition of the book no theological inferences were drawn from it. 2. The Fall and Original Sin in the Apocrypha Only in Apocryphal and Pseudepigraphic Jewish writings does the Paradise story begin to figure as the basis for speculation regarding the origin of death and of sin.13 The first discussions of this subject appear in the book of Ecclesiasticus. Sirach hues to the line of biblical teaching, emphasizing the universality of human guilt (8.5), and stressing the fatal character of sin. Some times he personifies sin as a serpent and as a lion, and sometimes he speaks of it as a two-edged sword, which slays the souls of men (21.1-3; 27.10). He treats sin as an external force, and definitely links it with Eve. "From a woman did sin originate, and because of her we all must die" (25.24). However, this idea is completely isolated, and contrasts with the general trend of the book to regard mortality as a law from everlasting (14.17; 17.1-2; 40.11). The full consequences of this statement are not drawn by him nor formulated into a doctrine of original sin, i. e., of the transmission of sinfulness from the first parents of the race. Instead, Sirach advances the doctrine of the Yezer as the source of human sinfulness. After restating the biblical account of the creation of Adam and Eve, he adds: "He clothed them with strength like unto Himself And made them according to His own image. 1■י All citations of this literature are from Charles's edition of the Apocry pha and Pseudepigrapha, 2 Vols., Oxford, 1913.

He set before them the covenant ; The law of life He gave them for a heritage . . . And He said unto them, beware of all unrighteousness" (17.1-14).(17-I-I4)• Sirach continues: "Their ways are before Him . . . Their iniquities are not hid from Him . . . Nevertheless to them that repent doth He grant a return And comforteth them that lose hope" (vss. 17-24). His reference to the Yezer in vs. 31 ("the inclination of flesh and blood") does not imply that man is morally corrupted be cause of Adam's fall or of God's punishment. Sirach conceives of the Yezer in a neutral sense, containing the power to do right or wrong, i. e. free will. Repudiating the earlier belief that God was the cause of man's sin,IS Sirach teaches: "Say not from God is my transgression, For that which He hateth made He not. Say not: '(It is) He that made me to stumble,' For there is no need of evil men . . . God created man from the beginning, And placed him in the hands of his Yezer. u The Greek reads διαβούλιον — Yezer. Moses Z. Segal, Hochmat Ben SiraSira and A. Kahana, Hasefarim Habizonim, III, read: Yezer v'lashon, etc. « E. g., Ex. 4.21; 7.3; II Sam. 24.1; Jer. 6.21; Ezek. 3.20.</page><page sequence="12">[12] 286 SAMUEL S. COHON If thou (so) desirest, thou canst keep the commandment, And (it is) wisdom to do His good pleasure. Poured out before thee (are) fire and water, Stretch forth thine hand unto that which thou desirest. Life and death (are) before man, That which he desireth shall be given to him. Sufficient is the wisdom of the Lord . . . He commandeth no man to sin" (15.11-20).(15.11-20). Instead of being an inheritance from Adam, sin is the result of man's own wrong choice. "He that keepeth the Law controlleth his natural tendency" or Yezer (21.11). Thus Sirach avoids con eluding in the same manner as the Rabbis subsequently did, that sin is hereditary by stressing the doctrines of freedom, of the saving power of the Torah and of repentance. A different approach appears in the apocalypse of I Enoch. Like Sirach the author of this mystic work opposes the idea that God causes man to sin, but instead of ascribing sin to man's free will, he charges it — under Parsi influence — to Satan. As the ruler of the counter kingdom of evil (which is nonetheless a kingdom subject to the Lord of spirits), he misguided the angels and made them his subjects' (54.6; 69.5). The fallen angels or satans misled the sons of God by means of the daughters of men (Cf. Gen. 6.1-4). One of them led astray Eve and showed men all the blows of death and the weapons of war. Another satan taught men pleasure and all the secrets of wisdom. He instructed mankind in the art of writing, "and thereby sinned from eternity to eternity and until this day. For men were not created for such a purpose, to give confirmation to their good faith with pen and ink." This is the mystic's version of the bibli cal story of Adam's partaking of the fruit of the tree of knowl edge. He continues: "For men were created exactly like angels, to the intent that they should continue pure and righteous, and death, which destroys everything could not have taken hold of them, but through this their knowledge they are perishing, and through this their knowledge they are being consumed." The</page><page sequence="13">[13] ORIGINAL SIN 287 author further charges all sinfulness to Azazel, who "taught all unrighteousness on earth" and disclosed all heavenly secrets to men (8.1 ff.; 9.8; 10.8). A contrary view is expressed in other portions of the book of I Enoch. Sin is sent neither by God nor by his lieutenant, Satan. All sin is of one's own devising. It is neither inherited from Adam nor unavoidable, but voluntary, and, therefore, subject to punishment (98.4; 9.14).16 Elements of the first view of I Enoch are fused with the rationalized version of the Genesis story in the Wisdom of Solomon. Originally death formed no part of God's plan of créa tion (1.13), and man, fashioned in God's likeness, was destined for a deathless existence. "But the ungodly by their hands and words called him unto them," i. e., the apostate Jews taking part in the pagan mysteries threw themselves into the arms of death. "They made a covenant with him (cf. Isa. 28.15) be cause they are worthy to be of his portion" (2.13-14, 16). Sin and death were introduced from without. "God made man for incorruption (i. e., for immortality) And made him an image of His own proper being; But by the envy of the devil death entered into the world, And they that belong to his realm experience it" (2.23-24). As in I Enoch the serpent of the biblical story is replaced with the devil. The connection between the two, in which the devil makes use of the serpent or incarnates himself in it, suggested by a Parsi source, became a commonplace of both Jewish and of Christian lore (cf. Rev. 12.9; 20.2). What of those who do not belong to the realm of the devil? The fact of physical mortality is ignored, and attention is focused upon spiritual death or sin. The wicked were dead as soon as they were born. "But the souls of the righteous are in the hands of God, and no torment shall touch them. In the eyes of fools they seemed to die." However, "their hope is full of immortality" (3-1-4; 5-31 10.3). 16 Charles, op. cit., II, p. 269, note on vs. 4.</page><page sequence="14">288 SAMUEL S. COHON [14] While the elements of a doctrine of hereditary depravity are present in the book, it was left to the author of the Hellenistic Book of the Secrets of Enoch to teach definitely that sin is transmitted from Adam. Under the influence of Plato, he finds the origin of death in man's dual nature. The soul was created pure, and was not predetermined by God (as the Wisdom of Solomon 9.15 claims) either for good or for evil. It was also endowed with freedom of choice, and was shown the ways of light and darkness, of the good and the bad, and was left to shape its own destiny. But through its incorporation into the corruptible body, the soul's power of choice was narrowed and biased toward evil. Accordingly sin derives not merely from voluntary preference, but from the limitations imposed upon the soul by its connection with the body and from wrong educa tion. Ignorance (as in Plato's teaching) is an evil in itself, which produces death (30.15-16).17 These Hellenistic ideas are loosely combined with the biblical story. The devil, envious of Adam's high position as lord on earth, seduced his wife Eve, but did not touch Adam himself. In consequence God cursed man's ignor ance and sin. Adam is told: "Earth thou art, and into the earth whence I took thee thou shalt go, and I will not ruin thee, but send thee whence I took thee. Then I can again take thee at My second coming," i. e., for the purpose of judging the earth (31-32). The author of IV Ezra, who lived through the catastrophic fall of Jerusalem in the year 70 c. e., despairs of human nature. He finds an explanation of the sorrows of his time in the fall of Adam, in consequence of which God appointed death for him and for his descendants. The generation of the flood shared the fate of Adam, and was swept away by death like him. Only Noah and his righteous offsprings were spared from destruction. When their descendants resumed the practice of ungodliness, God chose Abraham and formed with him an everlasting cove nant. Out of his line Jacob was set aside. To his children God showed His special favor, and gave them the Law. Resorting neither to the serpent nor to the devil, the author finds the source of evil within the human heart itself. Without explaining why 1י Ibid., note by Forbes and Charles, p. 450.</page><page sequence="15">[15] ORIGINAL SIN 289 this cor malignum or Yezer was implanted in man, he traces to it the self-propagating life of sin. Not even the Law does away with the infirmity. "The Law was indeed in the heart of the people, but (in conjunction) with the evil germ; so what was good departed, and the evil remained" (3.4 ff., 20-22, 26). "The grain of evil seed was sown in Adam from the beginning," and has produced an abundant harvest of ungodliness. The "innate evil thought" leads "astray from life to death" (4.30-31; 7.92). Taking a gleamy view of human nature, in line with the School of Shammai, this apocalyptist believes that it were better had Adam not been created altogether than to have been formed without a curb on his freedom to sin.18 What is the good of the promise of happiness and of immortality as reward of faithful ness, when man is doomed because of his Yezer to grief in this world and to punishment in the hereafter? "O thou Adam, what hast thou done! For though it was thou that sinned, the fall was not thine alone, but ours also who are thy descendants!" While the Law is imperishable, it is impotent to save the sinners. In deed, it is but a mockery to a race that is doomed to sin (7.116 131; 131; 9.32-37). The utmost that may be expected from the Law is that while the many are born to perish, the precious few shall be saved through the grace of God (8.3 ff.). In his admission of the insufficiency of the Law as the means of redemption, IV Ezra dangerously approaches the Paulinian position. II Baruch, which has been characterized as "the most rab binical and accurately theological of all the pseudepigrapha," was concerned chiefly with combating the notions of human sinfulness set forth in IV Ezra and possibly in the Epistles of Paul.19 In opposition both to the dualistic view of the origin of evil and to the hereditary nature of sin, he stresses man's per sonal responsibility for his actions. While Adam "brought death and cut off the years of those who were born from him," Moses provided the means for overcoming the evil. He "brought the Law to the seed of Jacob, and lighted a lamp for the nation of Israel." It is given to each individual to choose the light of the 18 Erubin 13b. 1י Tennant, op. cit., p. 212.</page><page sequence="16">290 SAMUEL S. COHON [16] Torah, which bestows life rather than the darkness of Adam (i. e., sin), which brings death (17-19). While Adam first sinned and brought premature death upon the race, his descendants have not been deprived of the freedom to prepare for their souls torments or glories to come. "Adam is therefore not the cause, save only for his own soul, But each one of us has been the Adam of his own soul" (54-15- 19; 56-6). Man's sin is derived not from Adam, but from his own spiritual nature. His inclination turns evil through his own determination. Man is the captain of his soul. 3. The Christian Doctrine of Original Sin The New Testament was produced in close connection with the circle of ideas in which the writers of the Apocryphal books moved. Nonetheless, with the exception of Paul, the authors of the New Testament pass over the subject. Jn 3.17 speaks of the redemption of the world through the Son of God, but offers no opinion of the way in which sin entered the world. The Book of Revelations utilizes the scenery of Gen. 3 and holds out the hope of the restoration of Paradise (2.7; 22.2, 14) and of the destruction of "the great dragon, the ancient serpent who is called the devil and Satan, who deceived the world" (12,9; cf. Rom. 16.20), but does not speculate about the fall and the sin of Adam. Paul, on the other hand, not only makes use of the Paradise story (II Cor. 11.3), but elaborates a theory of the fall and of original sin, which serves as the foundation of his entire religious system. His ideas are developed in two passages. The earliest of them, I Cor. 15, concerns itself with death rather than with sin. (Sin is only hinted at in verse 3). As in the Wisdom of Solomon 2.23 ff., the apostle's interest centers in the way in which mor tality entered the world and in which manner it may be over come. "The first Adam is of the dust of the earth." Like him all earth-born creatures are perishable. The second Adam, i. e., the Messiah, is from heaven. Those who are of heaven are like</page><page sequence="17">[17] ORIGINAL SIN 291 him heavenly, imperishable, immortal. The corruptible natures of the earthly creatures must clothe themselves with the incor ruptible by sharing in God's kingdom. The mortal must invest himself with immortality. Then death will be destroyed (Cf. Isa. 25.8). Adam is the head of the old humanity, which is mor tal; the Christ heads the new community, which is deathless. Mankind's connection with Adam, involving it in death, is the affair of heredity, and admits of no choice. The connection with the Christ is a matter of faith. Only those who through their faith share in God's kingdom through the Christ will be saved from destruction. Immortality is not man's portion by virtue of his being a child of nature — which is subject to decay — but purely as the fruit of faith, and is strictly supernatural.20 The second passage, that of Rom. 5.12 ff., deals with sin as the cause of death and with redemption from its power, and forms part of Paul's discussion of God's justice and grace. Adam's transgression marked his fall from grace. In consequence, sin as a malignant force was let loose upon the world with death as its effect.21 Sin and death originated together, and they have been propagated side by side. Adam's sin was transmitted to all his descendants, i. e. all of them have been infected with the tend ency to sin. Without indicating in which way the effects of Adam's sin were transmitted or defining precisely what was transmitted, Paul stresses that all men inherited from their ancestor: (1) the liability to sin as well as (2) the consequent liability to die as a punishment of sin. The Torah, which, accord ing to Judaism, delivers from sin, in Paul's opinion only increases it, since in the absence of the Law men are not charged with transgression, or, as he expresses it in I Cor. 15.56, "It is the Law that gives sin its power." Only the effect of divine grace, as manifested in the Christ, will offset the Law, cancel the evil consequences of the fall and bring salvation to mankind. The 3030 A. Robertson and A. Plummer, Intern. Critic.

COHON [18] evil ushered in by the first Adam will be remedied by the second Adam, or the Christ.22 Paul's teaching regarding original sin implies the imputa tion of Adam's sin to his posterity and thus holding it respon sible for it as its own, and similarly attributing the righteousness of the Christ to his followers so as to be regarded as their own and hence to be justified by it. The Roman Church formulated this idea into a doctrine. Schoolmen defended it on the ground that Adam was the moral as well as the natural head of the human race. His sin was imputed to mankind on the same prin ciple as the actions or commitments of the head of a family or of a state are imputed to his family or state, despite the fact that they had no share in those actions or commitments. When Adam broke the covenant with God, all his descendants were involved in the transgression. In the same way the Christ took the place of all men, so that his actions were imputed to them. The man who more than any other transformed Paul's teaching on original sin into a basic dogma of the Church is Augustine (354-430). As a former Manichaean he was prejudiced in its favor. He developed it not only out of the teachings of Paul but also out of the ideas of IV Ezra 3.21 and 4.30. As a brand plucked from the burning by what appeared to him as an act of God's grace, he stressed the two poles of his own ex perience, the extreme sense of depravity and the absolute sense of God's free grace. Despairing of his own weakness, he cast all his hope upon God. While fighting Manichaeism, he never wholly shook off its effects upon him. This accounts for the pes simistic tinge of his mind. The Manichaean view that man is the creature of the devil and the hatred of human generation and of the conservation of the race shaped his thinking. The doctrine of original sin offered him the explanation for what he considered as the radical evil of human nature. He assumed the solidarity of the race with Adam, sometimes asserting the semi nal existence of the race in Adam and sometimes claiming that Adam's personality and not merely his nature was shared by 22 S.

Then, accepting the Greek idea of universals or generic concepts existing apart from their individual or parti cular cases, he spoke of sin which our nature committed (in Adam). By incorporating our nature in Adam, Augustine sought to establish our guilt for Adam's sin and thus overcome the Pelagian objection that there can be no sin without a person's will. He thus treated Adam as an individual and at the same time as a generic idea. Inasmuch as original sin involved guilt, the unbaptized — even unbaptized infants — incurred and would receive damnantion. Commenting on Ps. 51.7, "I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me," he exclaims: "Where, I pray Thee, 0 my God, where, Lord, or when was I, Thy servant, innocent?" He prays: "Before Thee none is free from sin, not even the infant which has lived but a day upon the earth."23 Original sin constitutes "an infection which propagates itself from father to son through the act of generation, which being an act of organic trouble caused by sin, is sin itself and determines the transmission ipso facto of the sin to the new creature." It impresses itself upon the human body through the persistent stimulus of unreasonable sensuality, and also upon the soul. "Mankind is thus an agglomeration of condemned creatures which cannot acquire any merit before God, and whose hopes for forgiveness and atonement are only in the benevolent grace of the Father and the infallible decree of his prédestina tion."24 Rufus Jones remarks: "So complete is the havoc of the fall, in St. Augustine's view, that all human free will is lost, and the very faith by which a man accepts the grace won through Christ's merits is a divine gift. Those who have received the gift of such saving faith are the 'elect' ; those who have not received it are the non-elect, which means 'damned.' "2s Objections to the doctrine came from various sources. The distinguished exegete Theodore of Mopsuesta (4th cent.) denied 23 Confessions, I, 11; see also City of God, XIII, 14; On Original Sin, 31.

COHON [20] that the sin of Adam originated death, maintaining that had Adam not sinned, he would have died just the same. The strong est opposition came from the British monk Pelagius (c. 370-420) and his disciples Celestinus and Julian of Eclenum. Pelagius regarded the scandalous moral laxity, which he found in Rome at the beginning of the fifth century, as due partly to the pre vailing belief that man lacked within himself the power or capacity to do good. Averse to theological speculation and inter ested chiefly in practical matters, he was nonetheless drawn into controversy against the type of Christianity preached by Augus tine. The passage in the Confessions, which excited him to heated objection, was the prayer: "Verily, Thou commandest that I should be continent from the 'lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life.' (I John 2.16) . . . Give what Thou commandest, and command what Thou wilt."26 This seemed to encourage man to sit back lazily and to wait for virtue until it might please God to confer and bestow it. The warm sympathy of Pelagius and his followers with Stoic philosophy inclined them to emphasize the direct relationship between the human and the divine. Religion and moral goodness they con sidered as inherent in human nature, and they set themselves in opposition to the extreme view of the fall, of man's depraved and abjectly sinful condition and his absolute need of divine grace, doctrines which Augustine was forging out at the time. They also stood out as defenders of human nature. Pelagius took the call of Jesus upon men to be perfect as the Heavenly Father is perfect as an indication that the goal is within human reach. His favorite maxim was: "If I ought, I can." Man may live free from sin, and attain a state of purity and perfection, if he but desires it. Human nature being God's creation, cannot be as black and as vitiated as Augustine and his followers made it out to be. Each new born child enjoys the same condition in which Adam found himself before the fall, with no bias either for good or for evil, and now as then each person's fall is due to the sins which he commits. He thus follows the teachings of II Baruch. We are uninjured by Adam's sin save in so far as the evil example X, 41, 45■</page><page sequence="21">[21] ORIGINAL SIN 295 of our ancestors misleads and influences us. In fact there is no such thing as original sin, for sin is a thing of the will and not of nature, for if it were of nature it would be chargeable to the Creator. In a letter which he addressed to the See of Rome along with his confession of faith, he wrote: "We maintain that free will exists generally in all mankind, in Christians, Jews and gentiles gentiles ; they have all equally received it by nature, but in Chris tianity is it assisted by grace. In others this good of their original creation is naked and unarmed. They shall be judged and con demned because, though possessed of free will, by which they might come to faith and merit the grace of God, they make an ill use of their freedom; while Christians shall be rewarded be cause, by using their free will aright, they merit the grace of the Lord and keep His commandments."27 The Pelagian views were condemned by the Church, and Augustinianism upheld as the official doctrine on the subject. Its extreme position was tempered by Thomas Acquinas. He de nied that natural goodness was forfeited at the fall, that free will was more than impaired, and that concupiscence is of the nature of sin. In his view, original sin was a disordered condition which followed the dissolution of the harmony in which original righte ousness essentially consisted. Negatively, it represented the loss of original righteousness or of superadded grace. Duns Scotus went beyond Acquinas in his dissent from Augustine. In his tendency to minimize the first sin, he maintained that it had not affected human nature at all, but only the supernatural gifts that were bestowed upon man. Duns Scotus strongly emphasized fallen man's free will, and refused to identify original sin with concupiscence, insisting that concupiscence belongs to man's unwounded nature. Abelard went still farther. He revolted at the thought that Adam's sin was so serious as to be the adequate cause of the condemnation of all mankind. He considered appetite as both natural and innocent and the conflict between sense and reason as the characteristic of man as God created him. The word 'sin' is misused when it is said that we sinned in Adam.28 2י Marcus Dods, Encycl. Britannica nth éd., XXI, 63; Hast. Enc. Rel. and and Ethics, Art.

COHON [22] The scholastic ideas of sin, especially in the form which it re ceived from Acquinas was declared as official doctrine of the Roman Church at the Council of Trent (1545-1563). Luther and other Reformers of the 16th century inclined toward the elements of Augustianian teaching which the schoolmen rejected. Calvin took over almost unchanged Augustine's doctrine. Shar ing the positive teachings of the Roman and Anglican Churches, the Reformers stressed the total depravity of human nature, em ployed the strongest language in describing the fallen state of man, and explicitly affirmed concupiscence as partaking of the nature of sin. Arminianism strongly reacted to Calvinist teach ing insisting that the inherited bias to evil, which came with the Fall, was met and neutralized by the free and universal grace of God communicated to the race through the Christ, the second Adam. Consequently, original sin does not mean absolute reprobation.29 4. Rabbinic Ideas of the Fall and Original Sin About the beginning of Christianity three main conceptions of sin struggled for recognition in Judaism. The first regarded the cor ruption of the race as hereditary. The second vaguely asserted a connection between Adam's sin and his posterity's liability to punishment, without defining the exact nature of the connection. The third view considered all sin as the fruit of man's own action. Paul utilized the first two for his soteriology. Rabbinic Judaism, while not wholly discarding the first two, generally upheld the third. The Rabbis were keenly aware of the difficulties in reconciling the goodness of God with the universality of moral evil, but they did not invest the subject with the importance which it held in Christianity. Paulinian Christianity, as we noted, placed the doctrine of original sin in the center of its thinking; Judaism left it on the periphery. Rabbinic views on the subject have the character of random, 2י Art. "Original Sin," Catholic Encycl., XI, 312 ff.; art. "Confessions," H. E. R. E., Ill, 838 ff.; Book of Common Prayer of the Protestant Episcopal Church, Articles of Religion, ix and x, pp. 565.</page><page sequence="23">[23] ORIGINAL SIN 297 informal, and private opinions without dogmatic import what ever. The mystic Haggadah grapples with it most seriously, continuing the mythological notions of the Pseudepigrapha, and showing marked kinship to Parsi, Gnostic and Christian views. The Rabbis often voice a polemical note, aiming to controvert heterodox teaching within the Synagogue and of other faiths. Their comments generally bear the mark of fanciful interpréta tions of biblical texts, and reflect diverse and discordant view points extending over many centuries. While they yield no pre cise doctrine of original sin, they exhibit certain general trends regarding what they deny and what they affirm. The rabbinic ideas on original sin become evident from their treatment of the main characters in the drama of the fall, of death and the Yezer, imputation of guilt and merit, and the ways of escaping the effects of sin. A.A. Dramatis Personae While Eve plays an important role in the drama, the leading character is Adam. The statement of Genesis that he was formed in the image of God, is amplified in the Apocrypha and presents a favorite theme of rabbinic preaching. What did they understand by the "divine image?" Sirach 17.1 identifies it with rationality and supremacy over the beasts. The Wisdom of Solomon 2.23 associates it with immortality. The Targum Pseudo-Jonathan to Gen. 1.27, endeavoring to avoid anthropomorphism makes the expression refer to the image of the ministering angels. Akiba speaks of man as "created after an image," i. e., a special likeness prepared for him.30 The Midrash Aggada interprets "in 50 Abot 3.14 and Rashi to Gen. 1.27. L. Ginsberg writes: "Akiba, who steadfastly denies any resemblance between God and other beings — even the highest type of angels — teaches that man was created after an image — that is, an archetype — or, in philosophical phrase, after an ideal, and thus interprets Gen. 9.6, 'after an image God created man,' an interpretation quite impossible in Gen. 1.27. Compare the benediction in Ketubot 8a, בצלמו בצלם דמות תבניתו, wherein God is blessed because 'He made man in His image (בצלמו), in the image of a form created by Him,' " Art. "Adam Kadmon," Jew.

COHON [24] our image," to mean that he shall have the spirit of life; and "in our likeness," that he shall have wisdom and understanding of divinelike character.31 Ibn Ezra takes it to refer to the soul, which being immortal, is likest God.32 The glorification of Adam in the Haggadah exhibits Parsi and Gnostic elements. Like Gayomard,33 the dust used for the creation of Adam was gathered from all parts of the earth. The earth for his body came from Babylon, for his head — from Palestine, and for his limbs — from the rest of the lands.34 Another opinion is that he was fashioned from the navel of the earth (cf. Ezek. 38.12), i. e., the Temple, and endowed with God's spirit.33 His stature extended from one end of the earth 31 Ed. Buber, Bereshit, ch. 1.26, p. 4; see Nahmanides ad loc. See also Bereshit Rabbati, ed. Albeck, p. 19. 33 Combining Gen. 2.7 with the Platonic theory of ideas (Allegorical Interpretation, 1:12; On the Creation, 46), Philo distinguishes between the celestial Adam, made after the image of God, a perfect likeness of the Logos, an incorporeal object of intelligence, and the earthly Adam, compacted out of earthly substance or matter and an object of sense perception. Ginsberg suggests that Philo's idea is based on Pharisaic teaching. Gen. R. and Midr. Ps. 139.5 cite an opinion of R. Elazar b. Pedat interpreting ahor vakedem zartanizartani as "before the first and after the last day of creation." This is taken to agree with another opinion of R. Elazar that the words, "Let the earth bring forth the soul of living being" (Gen. 1.24) mean the soul of Adam. This opinion is further identified with that of Simeon b. Lakish, who takes the verse, "and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the deep," as referring to the spirit of Adam. In Gen. R. 2.4 the same Amora is quoted as saying that the verse refers to the spirit of the Messiah. Prof. Ginsberg observes: "This contains the kernel of Philo's philosophical doctrine of the creation of the original man. He calls him the idea of the earthly Adam, while with the Rabbis the Ruah (spirit of Adam) not only existed before the creation of the earthly Adam, but was préexistent to the whole of creation. From the préexistent Adam, or Messiah, to the Logos is merely a step." Jew. Enc., I, 181. Cf. Paul's Christologv in I Cor. 15.45-49. 33 See Bundahis 3 in W.

His height reached to the very skies. As he stood up in his divine likeness, the other creatures took him for their Creator, and began to prostrate themselves before him. But he corrected them and said: 'Come with me, and together let us clothe ourselves in majesty and strength, and crown Him as our God.' First Adam and then the other creatures proclaimed God's kingship (cf. Ps. 93). "Adam was the light of the world."36 He was distinguished by surpassing physical beauty and wisdom, brilliance which eclipsed the sun, and a heavenly light, which enabled him to see the whole earth. And he was immortal. As long as he was devoted to God, he enjoyed wisdom and power, counsel and insight.37 The word mimmennu in Gen. 3.22 was taken by R. Pappias as a first person plural. That is, the ministering angels declared: "Behold, Adam has become like one of us." Akiba silenced him, explaining the word as a third person singular, signifying: "Man is become like one who of himself may choose the way of life or the way of death."38 R. Judah bar Simon interpreted it as a first person plural of majesty. That is, God says: "Man is become like unto Ourselves," endowed with Godlike powers. Another opinion took it to mean that Adam became like Gabriel. The verse was further understood to mean that Adam was destined to be immortal like Elijah.39 The mystic Pirke R. Eliezer comments on Gen. 2.18, "It is not good for Adam to be alone," etc. God showed special love for Adam by creating him out of a pure and holy place, out of the dust of the place where the Temple was to rise, i. e., that he might be free from sin, and brought him to his own preserve, the Garden of Eden. There he promenaded like one of the ministering angels. And God reflected: "I am unique in My world and man is unique in his. I do not procreate and he does not procreate. This may mislead the creatures to think that he created them. Hence, 'it is not good for Adam to be alone; I shall make for him 36 Cf.

God placed His name into their names (the Yod into the first and the He into the second), indicating that if they followed His teaching, they would be saved from all distress, but if they did not, God would withdraw His name from them and they would be consumed.41 Adam's nuptials were celebrated with great pomp in Heaven. God prepared ten canopies for him in the Garden of Eden, all of them made of precious stones and pearls and gold (cf. Ezek. 28.13). The angels beat the drums and danced like maidens. The ministering angels served as the groom's companions, and God Himself officiated as Hazzan, blessing the couple (Gen. 1.28).42 The haggadic portrayal of the serpent is illuminated by the report of Bundahis 1.8 about Angra-Mainyu that "whatever he schemes he infuses with malice and greed till the end." As soon as he arose from the abyss, and came into the light, the evil spirit "desirous of destroying, and because of his malicious nature," rushed in to annihilate the light of Auharmazd (Ahura Mazda). Seeing that its bravery and glory were greater than his own, he rushed back to the gloomy darkness, and formed many demons and fiends, and together they rose to do violence (1.9-10). "His business is unmercifulness and destruction of this welfare (i. e., of the creatures of Auharmazd), so that the créa tures which Auharmazd shall increase he will destroy; and his eyesight (referring to the "evil eye") does not refrain from doing the creature harm." "His body is that of a lizard whose place is filth" (28.1-2). Again we are told that "the evil spirit was a loglike lizard's body, and he appeared a young man of fifteen years to Geh" (3.9). Of the wicked Geh, the Bundahis 3.3-9 tells that she comes "to cause that conflict in the world wherefrom the distress and 40 Cf. Gen. R. 8.10. 41 By removing the Yod from one and the He from the other, the letters Aleph and Shin remain in both, spelling Esh — fire. 44 We may have here a reaction to the Pauline idea of marriage as a mere concession to the flesh and to the Manichaean notion of the evil char acter of married life.</page><page sequence="27">[27] ORIGINAL SIN 301 injury of Auharmazd and the archangels will arise." She an nounced: "in that conflict I will shed thus much vexation on the righteous man (Gayomard, the representative of mankind) and the laboring ox that through my deeds, life will not be wanted, and I will destroy their living souls. I will vex the water, I will vex the plants, I will vex the fire of Auharmazd, I will make the whole of creation of Auharmaz vexed." The evil spirit "kissed Geh upon the head, and the pollution which they call menstruation became apparent in Geh."43 Some of these traits of the evil one reappear in the rabbinic portrayals of the serpent. R. Hoshaiah described him as double horned, upright like a pole, and walking on two feet.44 He is pictured also as camel. As in the Wisdom of Solomon 2.24 and in the Secrets of Enoch 31.3 so in the Haggada he is identified with the devil, Satan or Sammael.45 His characteristic attitude is that of jealousy and envy. He envied Adam's position in Eden. He envied Adam's lordship over creation, and above all Adam's possession of Eve. He therefore conspired to kill Adam and to marry Eve and to set himself up as king over the whole earth.46 According to Gen. R. 18.6 the serpent was filled with lust for Eve when he beheld her conjugal relations with Adam. P. R. E. 13 treats the serpent as the instrument of Sammael,47 who was a great prince in heaven. Whereas the Hayot had four wings and the Seraphim six, Sammael had twelve. He seems to have acted on behalf of the other ministering angels, who resented Adam's superiority over them, and resorted to stratagem to lead Adam to sin and thereby discredit him before God. Sammeal descended on earth with his band of evil spirits. Surveying all of God's creatures, he found no one more skilled to do evil than the serpent (cf. Gen. 3.1). He at once mounted 43 See note 33.

The trick worked. As Eve touched the fruit, she beheld the Angel of Death coming toward her. Fearing that she will die and that God will create another woman for Adam, she made him partake of the fruit so that if they shall die they shall both die, and if they shall live they shall both live. B.B. Nature of the Sin The opinion is expressed that the serpent enticed Eve and cohabited with her.49 The words "the fruit of the midst of the garden" (Gen. 3.3) are taken as a euphemism for Eve (cf. Song of Songs 4.12). Out of that union Cain was born. Subsequently Adam begot Abel.50 Hence Adam did not find consolation after Abel's death until Seth was born in his likeness. R. Ishmael is quoted as saying that the righteous generations descended from Seth and all the wicked ones from Cain. R. Meir held that the offspring of Cain behaved like animals, walking around stark naked, and indulging in all kinds of sexual excesses, including incest. It is of them that the fallen angels took wives. From their unions, according to R. Zadok, came the giants, who engaged in robbery, violence and blood-shed.

Johanan teaches that "when the serpent had intercourse with Eve, he injected pollution into her. Israel, by receiving the Torah at Sinai, freed itself of the pollution; the gentiles who did not stand at Sinai have not rid themselves of it." R. Ashi holds that proselytes are included with Israel, for though they were not at Sinai, their mazzal (guardian angel) was.52 R. Abba bar Kahana thinks that not even the Patriarchs were wholly free from that infection, for Abraham begot Ishmael, and Isaac begot Esau. Only Jacob begot twelve sons wholly free from blemish.53 The context in which R. Johanan's statement occurs in Aboda Zarah 22b suggests that the contamination was of the nature of lustful passion. The original sin thus consisted in awakening sexual desire in Eve.54 Concupiscence as the cause of the fall is suggested by the saying of R. Aha that Eve's name signifies "serpent" (Hivya, a play on the name Havvah) because she was the serpent, i. e., the seducer of Adam as the serpent was her seducer.55 In words that have an Augustinian sound, he comments on Ps. 51.7 ("Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me"), "Though one be the saintliest of saints, he cannot escape a trace of sin. Thus David said before the Holy One blessed be He: 'Did my father Jesse aim only to beget me? Did he not rather aim to satisfy his own desire?" R. Huna and R. Jacob report an opinion of R. Abba that Adam taught cohabitation to all creatures (cf. Gen. 4-1). R. Huna bar Ido teaches that as soon as Eve was created, Satan was created with her,56 i. e., the evil concupiscence. of his sister Yimak with a demon. See also Zohar, I, 36b; 145b. J.

COHON [30] As the incarnation of evil, Sammael is identified also with the evil impulse in man. R. Simeon b. Lakish teaches that Satan, the Yezer Hara and the Angel of Death are one and the same. He has a threefold function: he descends and misleads, he as cends and accuses, and he secures God's permission to take the soul.57 Rashi comments on Gen. 2.25 that in their state of inno cence Adam and Eve had no sense of distinction between good and evil, but in consequence of their transgression, the Yezer Hara entered into them and they grew conscious of good and evil. In his commentary on Isa. 5.2 Rashi voices the same thought. He treats the chapter as an allegory of Adam. The words "And he removed the stones thereof" refer to the Yezer Hara, i. e., before Adam sinned, but as soon as he sinned the Yezer Hara entered into him. "And there will arise in it briars and thistles" (v. 6) signifies that "the Yezer Hara will rule over him and the generations following him to do evil deeds." Rashi's Haggadic explanation implies that the Yezer Hara was in Adam from the first, but that it was removed from him during his state of innocence and was restored to him after the fall.58 Rashi's opinion accords with the view of A. R. N., II, 42 that the Yezer Hara represents a punishment meted out to Adam for his sin. The Cabbala follows the line of thought, maintaining that in consequence of Adam's transgression, all men are born under the influence of the Yezer Hara.59 The Rabbis generally hold that God endowed man from the very beginning with two Yezers, one good and one evil. This they derive homiletically from the two yods in the word vayyizer in Gen. 2.7.60 Furthermore, even the Yezer Hara is not absolutely evil. While, by rousing the passions, the Yezer "leads a man out " B. B. 16a; art. "Angel of Death," Universal Jew. Encycl., I, 302-3. 58 Nahmanides rejects the opinion that the fruit of the tree aroused sexual desire. He thinks that originally Adam and Eve were free from concupiscence, and cohabited only for procreation. Hence their sex organs were like other parts of the body of which they were not ashamed. By eating of the fruit man acquired the choice and the desire to do good or evil for himself and others, which is a godlike power, but also an evil in that man now possessed a Yezer.

He is "the leaven of the dough." Without him there would be no family life and no enterprise whatever. "He is as necessary to the world as rain."61 The Yezer is in reality neutral. Man can use his passional nature for good as well as for evil. "The tempter appealed to the desire and ambition inherent in human nature (Gen. 3.5 ff.), and in yielding to this impulse man transgressed the commandment of God. This is the uniform doctrine of Judaism, as it is indeed the meaning of the story in Genesis."62 In addition to concupiscence, drunkenness figures as the original sin. Thus I Enoch 32.4 considers the forbidden tree to have been a vine. We encounter the same idea in III Baruch 4.8, 16-17. Baruch is informed that the tree which led Adam astray is the vine, which the angel Sammael planted. In His anger, God cursed him and his plant, and forbade Adam to touch it. The devil, in his envy of Adam, managed to deceive him. As Adam was condemned through the vine and was divested of the glory of God, so his descendants "who now drink insatiably the wine which is begotten of it, transgress worse than Adam, and are now surrendering themselves to the eternal fire. For no good comes through it. For those who drink it to surfeit do these things: neither does a brother pity his brother, nor a father his son, nor children their parents, but from the drinking of wine come all the evils, such as murders, adulteries, fornications, perjuries, thefts, and such like."63 The idea recurs in Rabbinic Haggadah. This is the opinion of Rabbi Meir, of R. Judah b. liai and of R. Ibo.64 As Noah was about to plant the vine, Shamdon (Asmodeus) came to help him, saying: "I desire to join you in your work, but be on your guard lest you come into my power and I injure you."65 61 Abot 2.16; 4.28; Sefer Yezira 6; Midr.

Gen. 3.17), so through wine a third of the world, i. e., Canaan, the third son of Ham, was cursed (ibid. 9.24-25). As the viper divides between life and death, so wine separated man from the ways of life and sets him apart for the ways of death, for wine leads man to idolatry (cf. Prov. 23.33; Ps. 81.10). It was through wine that the Yezer Hara led Israel to worship the Golden Calf.66 C.C. The Effect of the Fall The immediate effect of the fall was the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden. According to P. R. E. 14, as soon as Adam sinned, God came down to judge him. Adam had been clothed in a horny skin,67 and covered with a cloud of glory. In conse quence of the fall he was stripped of both. He cast the blame upon Eve.68 She in turn blamed the serpent. Thereupon God meted out punishment to every one of the three, punishment consisting of nine curses and of death. He cast down Sammael and his troop from their holy place in heaven, cut off the feet of the serpent, and decreed that it should cast its skin in great pain, etc. The woman was afflicted with pains arising from menstruation, the rupture of the virginal membrane, of child birth and of bringing up children. Her head was covered like a mourner,69 and it is not to be shaved except in punishment of adultery (cf. Num. 5.18). Her ear is pierced like that of a per petual slave. Like a handmaid she waits upon her husband, and she is not believed in testimony. These curses are followed by death. Woman's entire status, physical, spiritual and social, was determined by the fall. Adam's curses included the following: His strength was diminished and his stature shortened; he was 46 Num. R. 10.8; Midr. R. Song 2.4. 6767 According to Targ. Jer. Gen. 3.7 in an "onyx-colored" garment, and according to R. Isaac Ravia in a dress as smooth as the finger nail and as beautiful as a pearl.

After all these comes death. Other opinions add that he was endowed with the Yezer Hara.70 The general view is that as soon as Adam sinned all things became perverted, and will not be restored until the advent of the Messiah.71 The earth and the heavenly bodies lost their brightness. The course of the planets changed. Death came upon all creatures, because Eve gave the animals of the forbidden fruit. Only the phoenix refused to break the Divine command. Hence he lives forever.72 Adam's sin was followed by the loss of six excellences: his radiance, his eternal life, his stature, the fruitfulness of the earth and of the tree of Eden, and the lustre of the luminaries.73 The Midrash applies Prov. 24.30 to Adam. "I went by the field of the slothful" refers to Adam who was too indolent to repent of his sin; "and by the vineyard of one devoid of understanding" refers to Eve who was enticed by the ser pent; "and lo, it was all grown over with thistles" for the whole world was filled with woe; "the face thereof was covered with nettles" as it is said: "and thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee" (Gen. 3.18); "and the stone wall thereof was broken down," for Adam demolished the fence of the world.74 ל° Cf.

Secrets of Enoch 31.7-8 limits the penalties to the serpent-Satan. Adam's ignorance and sin were likewise punished, but not Adam himself nor the earth or the other creatures. Under Platonic influence, ignorance is here conceived as an evil in itself and forms the origin of moral evil. See note by Forbes and Charles in A. P.E., II, 450, n. 16. A. R. N.

We meet with this view among the Palestinian as well as the Babylonian teachers.75 This view was held by R. Meir. R. Jose teaches that because Adam violated one commandment given to him by God, death came upon him and all generations. R. Judah applies Deut. 32.32 to the sons of Adam, who brought the penalty of death upon all his descendants. R. Nehemiah limits the penalties to the gentiles, who are "the disciples of the primeval serpent who misled Adam and Eve."76 This is related to the idea of R. Johanan, cited above, that the gentiles, by not accepting the Torah, have not yet freed themselves from the pollution of the serpent. R. Judah recognizes the universality of death. "No one hath power over the Angel of Death to keep him away from oneself."77 In other words, "If Adam had not sinned, men would not have been mortal."78 He supports his opinion that if Adam had not sinned he would not have died, with the case of Elijah, who escaped death by his sinlessness.79 Another view is that while mortality came with Adam, every person deserves it for himself. This is substantially the position of Paul.80 Thus R. Ammi, basing himself on Ezek. 18.3 and Ps. 89.33, teaches: "There is no death without sin and no suffering without iniquity." His view was controverted by the Tannaitic tradition that when the angels asked God why He imposed death upon Adam, he replied: "I commanded him but one light commandment, and he transgressed it." They retorted: "Did not Moses and Aaron keep the entire Torah? Yet, they too, died." God answered in the words of Eccl. 9.2, "all things occur alike to all; yea, one happening unto the righteous and the wicked." R. Ammi, it is explained, followed R. Simeon b. Elazar, who held that Moses and Aaron, too, died on account of their sin (cf. Num. 20.12). 75 Geiger's claim that these ideas were acquired from the Christians in Babylonia lacks foundation.

Another tradition states that the Angel of Death had no power over the following six persons: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron and Miriam.81 In keeping with R. Ammi's view is the statement of R. Eliezer b. Hyrcanus that if God were to enter into judgment with the patriarchs, they would not be able to withstand the rebuke.82 A Midrash on Job 37.7 ("By the hand of every man will He seal") states that when God showed Adam all the generations that were to descend from him (cf. Gen. 5.1), Adam grieved over the fact that he had brought death upon the righteous, and implored God not to record that fact. God assented and promised him that in the hour of man's departure from this world, He will reveal Himself to him and order him: 'Record thy deeds, for thou diest on account of thine own deeds.' And in the future, when He will come to judge His creatures, He will produce all the books of the children of man and show them their deeds. Hence is it said: "By the hand of every man will He seal." When the righteous reprove Adam for causing them to die, he responds: "I committed only one transgression, but every one of you com mitted many sins." In order to sustain Adam's claim, they are punished with death even for light offenses.83 Adam himself absolves God of the charge of having punished mankind with death, and takes the responsibility upon himself.84 R. Judah bar Simon voices the thought that Adam was worthy of being immortal. Why, then, was he punished with death? "God hath so made it that men should fear before Him" 81 See Targum to Ruth 4.22; Eccl. 7.29; Sab. 55ab; B. B. 17a; cf.

R. 9.5 makes the motive more explicit. R. Hama b. Hanina observes that Adam was punished with death on account of Nebuchadnezzar and Hiram who would set themselves up as gods. Because of them the entire human race was rendered mor tab Instead of posterity suffering for the sin of Adam, it is Adam who suffered for the offence of some of his posterity. That death is the natural lot of man was recognized in rab binic thought (cf. I Sam. 26.10; Eccl. 3.2). R. Joshua b. Korha argued that a subterfuge was employed in charging Adam with being the cause of human mortality (cf. Ps. 66.5), inasmuch as the Angel of Death was made on the very first day of creation and Adam was not created until the sixth.85 Death is a part of the order of nature. It was with Death as a reality that God looked upon all that He had made and said:" It is very good (Gen. 1.31).86 R. Meir noted in the margin of his scroll the word mavetmavet — death — by the side of tob — good. R. Samuel b. R. Isaac applied the words Tob m'od to the Angel of Death.87 The Midrash Lekah Tob (ad loc.) comments that "God looked upon the world and saw that death is good for the creatures, therefore it is said: 'and behold, it is very good.' " How long will death reign? Gen. R. 24.4 connects Isa. 57.16 with Gen. 5.1. "For I shall not contend forever" with Adam; "nor shall I always be wroth" with his descendants; "for the spirit fainteth before Me," i. e., He weakens the destructive spirit. R. Wolf Heidenheim interprets the statement that God will reveal (or release) the spirits which are 'wrapped before Him.' In keeping with the latter view is the saying of R. Tanhum bar Hiyya that the Messiah will not come before all the souls that appeared in God's plan of creation come to life. These are the souls referred to in the book of Adam (cf. Ps. 139.16). In Yebamot 63a the statement reads: the. Messiah will not come 8* Tanhuma, Vayeshev, 4. 86 Tanhuma, Shemot, 17; cf. Gen. R. 30.8; Ex. R. 2.4. 8ל Gen. R. 9.5, 9; Midr. Haggadol to Gen. 1.31; Midr.

R. 8.1, 'the body of Adam contained all souls') will have gone through an earthly existence.88 That will mark the end of death. The subject is pursued further in connection with the inter pretation of Gen. 2.17. The Midrash links it with Dan. 8.13 and applies the verse to Adam: How long will he and his descendants be trampled upon by the Angel of Death? The answer is found in thenext verse : ad erev boker — until the morning of the gentiles will turn into evening and the evening of Israel into morning. In Messianic times "the sanctuary will be victorious." Adam will be absolved of the penalty to which he was subjected. The excellences that were taken from him when he sinned will be restored with the coming of the Messiah. The defects of nature will be remedied and the wound of the world will be healed. Then, too, the Yezer Hara will be destroyed. With his elimination all suffering will disappear.89 D.D. Imputation of Guilt and of Merit As in the Christian doctrine of Original Sin, so in the Rabbinic thought on the subject the idea of imputation plays an important part. The idea of transmission of both guilt and merit within families or of rewards and punishments to be visited upon one's descendants was shared by all the nations of antiquity, and forms the basis of the biblical doctrine of retribution. The second commandment declares that God visits the sins of the fathers upon their children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate Him, and He shows mercy unto the thousandth 88 Cf. II Baruch 23.4-5. 8»Gen. R. 21.1; 12.6 and note by Theodor; Num. R. 13.12; Tanhuma, B., Bereshit 18, 40; cf. Yalkut, Gen. 42 on Gen. 5.29; A. R.N., 1.2; Sukka 52a. Parallels appear in the Bundahis: "The creatures of Aharman (Angra-Mainyu) will perish at the time when the future existence occurs, and that also is eternity" (1.7). Ahura Mazda will overcome the adversary, and the guardian spirits of man will again become perfect, immortal, undecaying and undis turbed for ever and ever (2.10-11). Gayomard spoke thus: "Although the destroyer has come, mankind will be all of my race; and this one thing is good, when they perform duty and good works" (3.23).</page><page sequence="38">312 SAMUEL S. COHON [38] generation of them that love Him and keep His commandments (Ex. 20.5-6; Deut. 5.9-10). In view of the descent of the human race from Adam, it was quite natural for the ancient thinkers to conceive of mankind as involved in the sins of its first parent. We encountered this belief in the Rabbinic teachings regarding the origin of death as an inheritance from Adam. The penalty imposed upon him must be borne by all his descendants. Midrash Lekah Tob explains the seemingly pleonastic expression Mot temutuntemutun in Gen. 2.17 as signifying death for Adam and death for his descendants. The words "these are the generations of Adam" (Gen. 5.1) were interpreted by R. Judah bar Simon, in the light of Ps. 139.16, to mean that when God created Adam, He showed him all the generations, their interpreters and their sages, their scribes and their leaders.90 In other words, humanity was fore shadowed in idea in the mind of Adam. More explicitly the later Midrash Ex. R. 40.3, citing Eccl. 6.10 ("and it is foreknown what man is"), states: "While Adam still lay as an unformed mass, God showed him every righteous man that was to descend from him; one hung from his head, another from his hair, another from his eyes, another from his mouth, still another from his ear," etc. Mysticism enlarged upon this idea. R. Bahia b. Asher, for example, writes: Inasmuch as death was decreed upon Adam, who was the root of the world and of all the generations, no one may escape it. Had it not been for that sin, men would have been immortal. On the basis of Ps. 82.6-7, he maintains that the original plan of creation was to have men like angels in bodily forms, on the order of Enoch and Elijah, but because of Adam's sin that plan was upset. Nature shows that when the root of a tree decays, its branches, too, are affected. Death, which separates the soul from the body, corresponds to the sin which parted the fruit from the tree. As such it is the portion of the righteous and the wicked alike (Cf. Eccl. 9.2; 3.19). However, this pertains only to their bodies. In the realm of souls, they are rewarded in accordance with their actions.91 In the view of the י° Gen. R. 24.1. Cf. Midr. Ps. 139.6; Ab. Zara 5a. 1י Kad Hakemah, Evel., ed.

It destroyed the original harmony of creation and sent the Shekina into exile.'2 In Luria's teachings this idea takes on most phantastic forms. All souls were created together with the organs of Adam. Originally they were in pure and holy state, but following the fall they were mixed with evil. The confusion has continued ever since, so that there are no holy souls without some "sparks" of "uncleanness" and no unclean souls without some "sparks of holiness." This condition prevents the advent of the Messiah, for he cannot come until the sin of Adam is repaired and the good is separated from evil.'3 The imputation of Adam's guilt to his posterity was acknowl edged even by rationalists. Thus David Kimhi comments on Isaiah 43.27, ("thy first father sinned"): "how can you claim to be innocent in view of the fact that your first father, Adam, sinned. Man is stamped with sin, 'for the inclination of his heart is evil from his youth' (Gen. 6.5).94 Next to Adam's fall, the worship of the Golden Calf figures in Rabbinic literature as the most heinous sin which brought the direst consequences upon Israel. Death as the penalty of Adam's sin was cancelled at Sinai when Israel accepted the Torah, but by setting up the Golden Calf the Israelites came back under the sway of the Angel of Death. Another opinion is expressed that at Sinai God gave the Angel of Death dominion over all the idolatrous peoples, and reserved Israel for Himself that they might share in His immortality. But as soon as they acclaimed the Calf as their God, they reverted to their former mortality.'5 The initiative for the Golden Calf came not from Israel but 2י G.

That sin, which was trailed by the two other cardinal sins of incest and bloodshed was hereditary, affecting twenty-four generations, till the final destruction of the Jewish state in the time of Zedekiah. R. Oshiah says: Down to the days of Jeroboam Israel suffered for the sin of one calf, and thereafter for three. R. Isaac expresses the thought that every every chastisement which befalls the world is, in some part, a retribution for the sin of the Golden Calf. R. Jehudah said in the name of R. Jose: There is not a single generation that does not partake of the sin of the Calf.96 According to R. Jehudah, Sammael entered the Golden Calf and began to bleat to mislead Israel (cf. Is. 1.3). However, not all the people were deceived by him. In the opinion of Rabbi, the princes of the people were deemed worthy of beholding the Shekinah because they did not worship the Calf (Ex. 24.11). R. Jehudah similarly excludes the tribe of Levi from that offence (Ex. 32.26). When God first descended to give the Torah to Israel, sixty myriads of angels accompanied Him to crown every Israelite. Prior to that event the Israelites were better in the eyes of God than the angels, and the Angel of Death, as we noted before, had no power over them. But after that affair, God was wroth with them. On the night following the sin, the sixty myriad angels returned and stripped every Israelite of his adornments.97 Like these, so other sins are trailed by suffering. Rav Zutra calls out: "Woe unto the wicked! Not only do they incur guilt, but they involve their children and their children's children to the end of all the generations."97 In view of the solidarity of the Jewish people, each generation completely identifies itself with the preceding ones and assumes responsibility for their mis deeds. "Because of our sins have we been exiled from our land —" is the mournful confession of a penitent people. Conversely, Rav Zutra exclaims: "Happy are the righteous. Not only do they acquire merit, but they bestow merit upon their children and their children's children to the end of all the generations"98 (ibid.). 96 Tanh., Ki Tisa, 20-21; Sanh. 102a; Mid.

Gen. 26.2-5; Ps• 103.18, etc.). In Judaism it is obviously not the righteousness of the Christ but the Zachut or merit of the Fathers that is ac counted to the Jewish people and affects their justification. This doctrine of merit is not — as S. Levy suggested — "a complete contrast of the Christian theory of Original Sin" and for which he proposed the name "Original Virtue,"99 but a phase of the idea of imputation, which underlies the doctrine of Original Sin The doctrine is clearly stated in Aggadat Bereshit 10.2, in connec tion with Prov. 20.7 ("He that walketh in his integrity as a just man, happy are his children after him"): "Happy are the children whose fathers possess merit, for that merit profits them. Happy are the people of Israel, for the merit of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob avails them. Because of their merit, God saved their descendants in Egypt (Ex. 2.24), when they departed thence (Ps. 105.42-43), in the episode of the Golden Calf (Ex. 32.13), in the days of Elijah (I Kings 18.36), and in the reign of Hazael the King of Aram (II Kings 13.22-23). God said to Israel: "Until now you had the merit of the Patriarchs; from now on, each person will depend upon his own acts." Another Midrash states: From that time on, the merits of one's own honest labor exceeds the merit of the Fathers.100 The date of the cessation of the merit of the Patriarchs was variously given. Rab placed it in the days of Hosea (Hos. 2.12), Samuel in the days of Hazael (II Kings 13.22-23), R. Joshua b. Levi in the time of Elijah (I Kings 18.36), and R. Johanan in the reign of Hezekiah (Is. 9.6).101 R. Aha is of the opinion that the merit of the Patri archs endures forever. R. Judah bar Hanan says in the name of R. Berechiah with reference to Is. 54.10: "When you see the merit of the Patriarchs declining and the merit of Matriarchs shaken, go and cleave to God's grace, for ["though the mountains = Patriarchs) shall depart and the hills ( = Matriarchs) be removed], My kindness shall not depart from thee."102 99 See Original Virtue and Other Short Studies, p. 1. 100 Tanhuma, Vayeze, 13. 101 Sabb. 55a. lw Jer.

Thus Lev. 26.42 states: 'I will remember My covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob," etc., i. e., even after the exile. And (in the liturgy) we recall not the merit of the Fathers but the Covenant."103 It is interesting that the original text of the Amidah, as represented by the Palestinian version, omits the words "who rememberest the goodness of the Fathers" in the first benediction. On the other hand, there is strong appeal to the covenant theme in the Zichronot in the Musaf for Rosh Hashanah. "It is in the later liturgy where the Zachut of the Fathers plays such an important part."104 The generations that suffer persecution cry out in despair: "Lord of the world! The former generations were protected by the merit of the Fathers, and 'we are become like orphans and fatherless' (Lam. 5.3), but Thou hast said, 'In Thee the fatherless find mercy;' 'Thou aidest the orphan' (Hos. 14.4; Ps. 10.14)."IOS Particularly important is the merit accruing to the people in consequence of the Akeda, Sacrifice of Isaac. The Tahanun contains the prayer: "We beseech Thee, O gracious and merciful King, remember and give heed to the Covenant between the Pieces (with Abraham), and let the binding (upon the altar) of his only son appear before Thee to the welfare of Israel." While the sacrifice of Isaac is passed over without further reference in the rest of the Bible, it figures prominently in Rabbinic litera ture. The Mishna utilises the incident in the special invocation for fast days: "He who answered Abraham at Mt. Moriah, may He answer us."106 That incident is counted as the tenth test to which Abraham was subjected, and whereby he demonstrated his unswerving devotion to God. The Mekilta, on the other hand, refers to the blood of Isaac. Commenting on Ex. 12.23, "And when He seeth the blood," the Mekilta states, "He seeth the 103 Tosafot Sabbat 55a. I&lt;M S.

Jose the Galilean says that because of the merit of the Akedah God divided the Red Sea for Israel.10' According to the Targum of Canticles 1.3, the merit of the Akeda atoned for the sin of the Golden Calf. The Akeda looms large in the thought of the Amoraim. Two reasons are offered for covering the head with ashes on fast days. The first is that God may recall the merit of Abraham who spoke of himself as dust and ashes (Gen. 18.27). The second is that God may remember the ashes of Isaac as if they were heaped upon the altar.110 R. Abahu says that the reason for blowing a ram's horn on Rosh Hashanah is that God may recall the binding of Isaac to the credit of his descendants and account it to them as if they had offered themselves up to Him.111 The Babylonian Gemara assigns the reading of Gen. 22 for the second day of Rosh Hashanah, thus definitely linking the holiday with the Akedah.112 The Jerushalmi presents the following homily of R. Johanan: Abraham said before God: "Lord of the Universe! It is known and revealed before Thee that when Thou didst command me to offer up my son Isaac, I could have pleaded: 'Didst Thou not promise me only yesterday that "in Isaac shall seed be called unto thee?' " And today Thou biddest me offer him for a burnt offering, God forbid!' I did not speak thus, but I restrained my inclination and did Thy will. Even so may it please Thee, 0 Lord my God, that when the children of Israel will be in distress, with no one to plead their cause, mayest Thou intercede in their behalf." The words "the Lord seeth" (Gen• 22.14) are explained: "He remembers in their favor the sacrifice of Isaac, and is filled with mercy for them." R. Judah b. Simon says that when, in the course of time, the descendants of Isaac will be entangled in distress of oppressive kingdoms, they will 107 Tractate Pisha, II; cf. Ber. 62b. 108 Ex.

COHON [44] be redeemed "through the horns of this ram, 'And the Lord will blow upon the horn,' etc." (Zech. 9.14).113 These ideas form the theme of the Zichronot in the Musaf for Rosh Hashanah: "Remember unto us, O Lord our God, the covenant and the lovingkindnesslovingkindness and the oath which Thou swarest unto Abraham our father on Mt. Moriah, and may the binding with which Abraham our father bound his son Isaac on the altar appear before Thee . . . and the binding of Isaac mayest Thou remember this day to his seed." The later Haggada expatiates upon the Akeda, and invests some incidents in that event with messianic significance, remi niscent of the Gospel story. Isaac's birth formed the occasion of universal rejoicing, in which heaven and earth, sun, moon, planets and stars participated, for had Isaac not been created the world would not have endured."4 The great event of the Akeda was entered into by Isaac as well as by Abraham with unflinching faith, despite the devices af Sammael."5 When Ishmael had vaunted his superiority over him for having suffered himself to be circumcised at the age of thirteen, when he felt the pain more than Isaac who was circumcised on the eighth day of his birth, Isaac replied: "Thou pridest thyself in that thou didst offer up one part of thy body. If God were to ask me to sacrifice my whole being unto Him, I would gladly do so.""6 "He carried the wood for the offering as one who carries his gallows upon his shoulder.""7 The spot where Isaac was sacrificed was the place where subsequently the Temple was built."8 The ass which 113 Jer. Taan. 2.4; cf. Gen. R. 56.14. 114 Cf. Jer. 33.25; Tanh. Toledot,, 2; cf. Luke 2.13. Philo represented Isaac as "the direct child of God through Sarah to whom virginity has been miraculously restored." E. Goodenough observes: "How far this allegory of Isaac as the son of God by a virgin was carried out in the De Isaaco it is im possible to know, and that impossibility makes it also impossible to judge how literally Philo believed that Isaac as the ancestor of the race was the miracu lous son of God. There is at least a possibility that Philo developed the idea in a way so closely parallel to the Christian doctrine about the birth of Jesus that Christian copyists suppressed the text."

Upon it Moses rode when he came to Egypt (Ex. 4.20). It will be ridden upon by the Messiah (Zech. 9.9; cf. Matt. 21.7). The altar was the same one upon which Adam, Abel, Cain and Noah sacrificed."9 When the knife touched Isaac's neck, his soul departed, but when the command re sounded: 'Lay not thy hand upon the lad' (Gen. 22.12), his soul returned to the body, which is symbolic of a future quickening of the dead. The ram, which was to serve as the substitute for Isaac, like the ass, was created on the eve of the first Sabbath. Sammael again tried to upset the offering of Abraham, but did not succeed. The ram was a perfect substitute for Isaac. R. Berechiah said: The sweet savour of the ram ascended before God as though it were the sweet savour of Isaac.120 According to Hanina b. Dosa, not a part of the ram went to waste. The ashes of the parts burnt upon the altar formed the base of the inner altar of the sanctuary whereon the expiatory sacrifice was brought on the Day of Atonement. Its sinews were used for the strings of the harp upon which David played. Its skin served Elijah for his girdle, its left horn was blown by God at the revelation on Sinai, its right horn — the larger — will be used at the future ingathering of Israel's dispersed, when, "it shall be blown upon the great horn," etc. (Is. 27.13).121 (This passage links the Akeda with Yom Kippur. This connection was favored by the Cabbalists.)122 These Haggadas seem to indicate that the ideas of the sacrifice of Isaac in the light of an atonement for the sins of Israel aimed to overcome the claims of Christianity. The merit of the sacrifice of Isaac rendered the need of the justification through the death of Jesus superfluous.123 "י Targ. Jer. Gen. 22.9. See Zohar, I, 120b. P. R.

COHON [46] The Targum of Canticles 1.3 claims the merit of the Akeda expiated the sin of the Golden Calf. R. Simlai taught that Moses expiated that sin; of him the prophet said, 'He bore the sins of many' who shared in the worship of the Calf, and atoned for them by his self-sacrifice.124 According to P. R. E. 45, when, in consequence of the sin of the Golden Calf, God sent the five destructive angels, Wrath, Anger, Temper, Destruction and Glow of Anger, to destroy Israel, Moses appealed to the Patri archs at the cave of Machpelah for help. Because of their merit, three of these angels were restrained, but two still remained as a menace. Moses implored God to keep back Destruction for the sake of the oath which He swore to the people. God assented, as it is said: "But He, being full of compassion, forgiveth iniquity, and destroyeth not" (Ps. 78.83). Moses persisted, pleading that God hold back also the last one, Glow of Anger, for the sake of His great Name (cf. Ex. 32.12). What did Moses do? He dug in the earth, in the possession of Gad, a large dwelling place and imprisoned Glow of Anger therein.125 Every time Israel sinned, the angel arose and opened his mouth to blow his breath upon Israel to destroy it. Hence his name is called Peor, the opener. But Moses pronounced God's Name and brought him down beneath the earth. When Moses died, God buried him opposite Peor, so that whenever Israel sins and Glow of Anger opens his mouth threateningly, he is confronted by the grave of Moses and withdraws.126 Thus in death as in life Moses continues to secure atonement for the sin of the Calf. Furthermore, the death of all the righteous was believed to effect atonement. To the question: why is the section dealing with the death of the sons of Aaron (Lev. 16), which was supposed to have occurred on the first of Nisan, read on Yom Kippur? the reply is given: to teach you that the death of the righteous atones (like Yom Kippur). Similarly, the proximity of the account of Miriam's death to the section of the Red Heifer (Num. 19 and 20.1-6) is explained as "4 Sota 114a. "s Cf. Jubil. 48.15. 1־נ Cf. Deut. 34.6 and Rashi ad 10c., also Targ. Jerushalmi; Tosafot Sota 14a.</page><page sequence="47">[47] ORIGINAL SIN 321 intended to teach that as the ashes of the red heifer cleanse Israel from impurity, so the death of the righteous atones for Israel's sins.127 E.E. Ways of Justification The striking divergence of the Jewish and Christian conceptions of Original Sin comes to a climax in their difference of method in overcoming its effects. In Romans 6.2-12, Paul limits the way of salvation to mystic union with Christ. As by his death on the cross, Christ broke all contact with sin, which is an heritage of the first Adam, so the Christian, united with him in baptism, parts once and for all with sin, and lives henceforth a reformed life dedicated to God. Through baptism, the Christian incorpo rates himself into and identifies himself with Christ. Baptism also expresses a series of acts corresponding to the redeeming acts of Christ. "Through baptism we have been buried with him in death, so that just as he was raised from death to the Father's glory, so, too, we may live a new life. For if we have grown into union with him by undergoing a death like his, of course we shall do so by being raised to life like him, for we know that our old self was crucified with him, to do away with our sinful body, so that we might not be enslaved to sin any longer; for when a man is dead he is free from the claim of sin. If we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him." The death of Christ, the second Adam, wins for the Christian immunity from the consequences of the sin of the first Adam. We have here a complete application of the basic idea of the mystery religions to Christianity. The believer identifies himself with his god, dies with him, and resurrects with him. Though this process must be undergone in a moral and spiritual sense, this system has no room for the Law, which, according to Paul's dialectics, only 12י Jer. Yoma 1.1; Lev. R. 20.12; Zohar, III, 56b. At first the Shekina dwelt on earth (cf. 3.8). When Adam sinned it moved up to the first heaven, and did not come down until the day of the dedication of the Tabernacle. (Ex. 25.7; Gen. R. 19.7; Num. 12.6). It was named Mishkan Haedut to 'testify' that God pardoned the sin of the Calf and that the Shekina returned to dwell in Israel. Tanh., Pekude, 2, 6.</page><page sequence="48">322 SAMUEL S. COHON [48] makes for sin, or for any observances whatever (Rom. 7.7-10). The Law is superseded by grace.128 In contrast to this method, Judaism — despite its doctrine of imputed merit — places full responsibility for his salvation from sin and from its effects upon the individual person, upon his freedom of will, and his good deeds. Pivotal in this viewpoint is the doctrine of repentance. Adam and Eve are treated as types of penitent sinners in both the Apocrypha and in Rabbinic literature.12' P. R. E. 20 presents Adam praying that his sin be removed so that all generations may learn to know that there is repentance and that God receives the penitent. Indeed, repentance is regarded as one of the seven things that were created before the world was called into being.130 R. Hanina bar Hama extols repentance for bringing healing to the world. In the view of R. Levi, repentance reaches to the throne of Glory. R. Jonathan teaches that repentance hastens the redemption.131 That even the greatest sinner need not despair of being received by God is stressed by the example of Manasseh. "The Holy One rejects no creature, but welcomes every one. The gates are open and whoever wishes may enter."132 Repentance directs man to a life of righteousness and is associated with prayer and charity as means of salvation. Another means of overcoming the effects of the fall is circum cision, the sign of the covenant of the Jewish people and God. Akiba explains the reference to the 'covenant' in Ex. 19.5 as the covenant of circumcision and the covenant against idolatry.133 The reference to the flaming sword "which turneth everyway" (Gen. 3.24) was taken to be Gehenna, and was set up right after the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden. It turns upon a man and sets him ablaze from head to foot. What instrument may save him from its flames? R. Huna says: the sword of circumcision (cf. Jos. 5.2). The rabbis maintain: the sword of 138 Sanday, op. cit., pp. 153 ff. "» Book of Adam and Eve 1 ; 9; 27; 32; Erub. 18b; Ab. Z. 8a; A. R. N. I. 180 Pes. 54a; Ned. 39ab; Midr. Ps. 90.12. Yoma 86ab.

Azariah points to the contempt in which the Bible holds the lack of circumcision. R. Ishmael adds: Great is circumcision, with reference to which the word 'covenant' is repeated thirteen times (Gen. 17.2-21). R. Judah Hanasi says: Great is circumcision, for despite all the commandments which Abraham our father fulfilled, he was not called 'perfect' until he was circumcised, as it is said 'Walk before Me and be perfect' (Gen. 17.1). Another opinion is expressed that were it not for the covenant of circumcision, God would not have created the world.135 Still another idea is cited that circumcision outweighs all the commandments of the Torah, also that the covenant of circumcision outweighs the whole Torah.136 This is understandable in the light of Paul's statement in Galateans 5.3 that any man who lets himself be circumcised is under obligation to obey the whole Law. In opposition to his claim that "if you belong to Christ, then you are true descendants of Abraham, and his heirs under the promise" (Gal. 3.29), Judaism emphasized the demand of circumcision of both Jews and Proselytes. In place of the Christian emphasis on baptism, Rabbinic Judaism stressed circumcision as a means of escaping damnation. R. Levi teaches that in the future world, Abraham will be seated at the door of Gehenna and keep out of it every circumcised Jew. What does He do with Jews unduly steeped in sin? He removes the foreskin from children that died before they were circumcised and places them upon the sinners and causes them to go down to Gehenna.137 P. R. E. 29 states that Abraham was circumcised on Yom Kippur. Every year, God looks upon the blood of Abraham's circumcision and pardons the sins of his descendants. On the spot on which the blood of his circumcision fell the altar of the Temple was built whereon the blood of the sacrifices was poured out (cf. Lev. 4.2). By virtue of their circum cision, the prayers of the Jews reach God. R. Eleazar explains the repetition of the word "b'damayich" in Ezek. 16.6 as signifying '34 Gen. R. 21.9. 13s Ned. 3.11 ; Mekilta, Amalek, 3. '3® Ned. 32a; Midr. Haggadol to Gen. 26.5. '37 Gen. R. 48.8; cf. Erub. 19a; Tanh., Lech Lecha, 20.</page><page sequence="50">324 SAMUEL S. COHON [50] that because of the merit of the blood of circumcision and of the blood of the paschal lamb, God redeemed Israel from Egypt and will redeem them again at the end of the fourth kingdom. The idea of the saving power of circumcision is voiced by the prayer which the Mohel recites after the operation: "Praised be Thou . . . who didst sanctify the beloved one (Isaac) from the womb (i. e., who was sanctified for this command before birth; cf. Gen. 17.19), and hast set a statute in his flesh, and hast sealed his offspring with the sign of the holy covenant (Jacob, who was believed to have been born circumcised). Therefore, because of this, 0 living God, our portion, ordained the deliver ance from the pit our beloved one of our flesh, for the sake of the covenant which Thou hast set in our flesh."138 That the Torah saves from Gehenna is the universal belief of the Rabbis. According to the Midrash, when Adam recognised that his descendants would perish in Gehenna, he abstained from procreation, but on learning that after twenty-six generations Israel would receive the Torah, he lived with his wife and raised offspring.139 The Torah is the instrument wherewith God created the world. Were it not for the Torah, the world could not abide.140 It is one of the three pillars upon which the Jewish world rests. The glorification of the Torah by the Rabbis appears to stem from their desire to overcome the antinomism of the Church (cf. Rom. 8.3-4; Gal. 5.2 ff.; Heb. 8). The Torah is an everlasting possession. The words of Deut. 33.4, "Moses com manded unto us the Torah, an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob," are explained in the Sifre as "a heritage for ever." The word morasha — heritage — is read meorasa — betrothed — suggesting that the Torah is pledged to Israel for all time.141 The scene at Sinai is pictured as a marriage ceremony. "God received Israel as a bridegroom come forth to meet the bride."142 "8 Tosefta Ber. 7.17; Sab. 137b and Rashi. The Tosafot ad loc. and in Menahot 53b cites Rabbenu Tarn's view that this prayer contains references to all three Patriarchs. See S. Baer, Abodat Yisrael, p. 582; B.

Johanan that the Torah removed from Israel the pollution of the serpent. The Midrash Haggadol to Gen. 3.24 (also Targ. Jer., ad 10c.) states that the Tree of Life which stood in the Garden of Eden was hidden by God, and was replaced for Israel by the Torah, which is a tree of life. By studying it, by perceiving the wisdom of God and His righteous ordinances and laws, by taking them to heart and by practising them, one acquires life both in this world and the next. With reference to Prov. 2.1 the Midrash observes: The Holy One said to Israel at Mt. Sinai: If you will show yourselves worthy of laying up and receiving My Torah and observing it, I shall save you from three visitations, from the wars of Gog and Magog, from the tribulations which will precede the advent of the Messiah and from the judgment of Gehenna. (Mekilta, Vayasa, 5 name these as the reward of observing the Sabbath). And if you will treasure the words of the Torah, I shall satisfy you of the good that I have stored up for the future." God further promised: "If you engage in the words of Torah, they will save you from the way of evil, for they are like a double-edged sword." R. Nehemiah takes the words "double-edged sword" to mean that it bestows life in this world and in the next.145 The Midrash inquires regarding the significance of the use of the words ishim and benei adam in Prov. 8.4 ("Unto you, O men — ishim — I call, and my voice is to the sons of men — benei adam."). R. Simeon b. Halafta offers the following explanation: If you keep yourselves meritorious and observe the Torah, you will be called ishim like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who fulfilled the Torah; but if you do not, you will be called sons of Adam, who did not keep the Torah and was expelled from Eden. Another explanation is that through keeping the Torah Israel will be ishim or angels, but if not — they will be !43 Al-Nakawa, Menorat Hamaor, III, p. 347 and note by H. G. Enelow. P. R.

R. Jose remarked: It was upon this condition that the Israelites stood at Sinai, viz., that the Angel of Death should have no dominion over them, but they corrupted their ways and became mortal.148 However, if the Torah cannot prevent physical death, it helps men overcome spiritual death. "The Torah is the antidote to the Yezer Hara. He who takes the words of the Torah to heart is freed from many evil thoughts, from the thoughts of hunger, of folly, of fornication, of the Yezer Hara, etc. When Israel engages in Torah and works of lovingkindness, their Yezer is within their power and they are not within the power of the Yezer."149 Israel is told: "Your accepting the Torah is accounted to you as if you had never sinned."150 The prayer "Let my heart be undivided in Thy statutes" (Ps. 119.80) is interpreted to mean that David asked God that when he engages in the Torah the evil Yezer may not be permitted to look into his heart and mislead him."131 A word must be added about the Day of Atonement. Not only were the circumcision of Abraham and the sacrifice of Isaac associated with it, but attempts were made to link the Torah with Yom Kippur, thus investing it with the greatest possible efficacy. P. R. E. 46 informs us that Moses ascended to heaven for the second time on Rosh Hodesh Elul. He spent forty days on the mount, and descended, carrying the second tables of the Law, on the tenth of Tishri. The people immediately learnt that it was Yom Kippur. The shofar was sounded, and the fast was proclaimed throughout the camp. "Were it not for the Day of Atonement, the world could not stand, for it effects reconciliation in this world and in the world to come, as it is said, 146 Midr.

God yielded to his entreaty, and said: "Behold, thou hast power over them on the Day of Atone ment if they have any sin, but if not thou shalt have no power over them." For this reason he is bribed on Yom Kippur (i. e., by offering a sacrifice to Azazel) in order that he may not inter fere with Israel's atoning sacrifice to God.133 Sammael was out witted, and admitted that Israel is as pure from sin as the ministering angels in heaven. On Yom Kippur, God hears the petitions of Israel rather than the charges of the Accuser, and makes atonement for the altar, the sanctuary, the priests and the people, both great and small. On Yom Kippur, Moses sought to behold the Glory of God. The angels were jealous of him and sought to slay him, but God Himself protected him with the hollow of His hand (Ex. 33.22). As God passed by, Moses beheld the back of the Shekina and exclaimed: "O Lord, 0 Lord, full of compassion!" (Ex. 34.6), and pleaded for the pardon of the iniquities of the people, incidental to the worship of the Golden Calf. Had he asked for the pardon of all the sins of Israel to the end of all generations, God would have granted his plea, for it was a time of good favor (cf. Is. 49.8). God assented and said: "I have pardoned according to Thy word" (Num. 14.20). In contradistinction to the doctrine of atonement in the early Church as the means of overcoming the effects of the fall and of original sin, R. Akiba taught: "Happy are ye, O Israel! Before 152 Jer. Megil. 1.7, expressing the idea that all festivals will be abolished in Messianic times, except Purim. 153 153!53 Midr. Abchir, cited in Yalkut Shimeoni, Gen. 44; Jellinek suggests that the practice of reading Lev. 18 in the Minha service of Yom Kippur was intended to break the power of Azael or Azazel over the people, for he entices them to sexual immorality.

[No mediator, but] your Father in heaven, as the prophet states: 'And I will sprinkle clear water upon you, and ye shall be clean' (Ezek. 36.25). Similarly, [God is referred to as] Mikveh (literally, hope, but by a word play here construed as a ritual bath) of Israel (Jer. 14.8). As the ritual bath purifies the unclean, so the Holy One blessed be He cleanses Israel."154 Though God's grace abounds, man must work out his own salvation. R. Isaac com ments on the word va'asitem ("and ye shall make a burnt offer ing") in Numbers 29.2 that "God said to Israel: 'Asu teshubah, re pent during these ten days of penitence between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, and I shall purify you on Yom Kippur and recreate you as a new creature."155 5. A Modern Appraisal What significance may be attached by moderns to these searching efforts to penetrate the mystery of the persistence and diffusion of moral evil? The scientific study of the Bible excludes the acceptance of the Paradise story as "in some sense a veil of man's spiritual history," except in a homiletical way. Instead of being a divinely inspired answer to the eternal riddle, it forms an attempt on the part of an ancient thinker in Israel to deal with the troublesome facts of pain and death from the standpoint of the early religion of Jahwism, much on the order in which thinkers in Babylonia, Persia, Greece and even among primitive peoples dealt with them in the light of their respective religions. It differs from them chiefly in the deeper moral consciousness with which it views life. Possibly not without justice it was taken to reflect a phase of man's moral and spiritual experience. By virtue of his endowment of reason, which distinguished him from the animals around him, man was free to choose between good and evil. His freedom created a spiritual conflict within him. Temptation, which ever trails freedom, lured him on. Yielding to it, he involved himself in sin by disobeying God, thus '54'54 Yoma 8.9. 15s Pesikta R., ed. Friedmann, p. 16qa and notes.</page><page sequence="55">[55] ORIGINAL SIN 329 bringing on himself the penalty of mortality. However, he did not forfeit his original gifts of reason and of freedom. Ever confronted by choices between obeying and disobeying the Divine behest, he may range himself on the side of God or rebel against Him. Sin represents man's rebellion against His Creator, the disregard of His will of right and of holiness, and, the pursuit of his pleasures. In consequence, conscience was awakened within him, and he began to hear the voice of God within his soul condemning his actions and filling him with shame and with guilt. Does this story warrant the belief in the propagation of sin as an inheritance of the race from Adam or the total corruption of man's physical and spiritual nature? Our investigation shows that the conclusions drawn from it by both Christianity and Judaism are without foundation. Tennant writes: "It is most doubtful whether the idea of original or inherited sin occurs in Holy Scriptures and that St. Paul made use of the conception of the imputation of Adam's sin, or of the solidarity of the race, in some undefined way, in the Fall of our first parent is ... no reason why the Church to-day should take the somewhat inci dental utterances on the subject as the basis of its doctrine of human nature. The fictitious importance assigned by theology, in its most scholastic and artificial periods, to the doctrines of the Fall and Original Sin, is an accident of history, not the out come of the necessary development of the Faith."156 Rabbinic Judaism, too, bound as it was to the text of Genesis, did not always recognize the naturalness of death and of physical suffering and regarded them as penalties imposed upon mankind on account of Adam's transgression. However, its moral realism kept it from the quagmires into which Pauline Christianity fell. For all the artificiality of their methods of biblical interpréta tion and for all the tenuousness of their ideas regarding imputed guilt and merit, the Rabbis bravely championed the dignity of human nature and consistently upheld the justice of God. While dwelling upon the striking changes that came upon Adam in consequence of his disobedience, they avoid the thought that «6 The Origin and Propagation of Sin, p. 150.</page><page sequence="56">[56] 330 SAMUEL S. COHON he lost his divine image and his mental capacities or that he for feited his freedom of choice between good and evil. Even the more mystic among them, who admit that "the pollution of the serpent" infected humanity, refuse to consider human nature as hopelessly corrupted. The "broken channels" of divine grace can be repaired by repentance, good works, and Torah. Spirit uallyually every person enjoys complete autonomy. Against the despairing view of human nature as vitiated and depraved, Judaism consistently pointed to the divine capacities and endow ments of man. Rejecting also the Greek idea of the corruption of matter, it taught that not only the soul but the body as well is God's handiwork. Haneshama lack vehaguf pa'alach. The capacity for goodness inheres in man as the bearer of the divine likeness. The universality of moral evil, which fills the world with grief derives from no mythical fall of a mythical father of the race in a mythical Paradise, but rather from man's slow advance in the scale of humanity. His appetites and impulses, which he carries within him as a member of the biological kingdom, have not yet been sufficiently mastered and subjected to religious and ethical purposes. However, it is gratuitous to call his heritage of in stincts and passions a heritage of sin. It is a normal and necessary part of human nature, without which life could not go on. With the Rabbis we may speak of the Yezer as a neutral endowment, which we ourselves turn into good or into evil. Our instinctual responses and cravings become evil when they are permitted to run wild and to grow into lusts for pleasure, for glory or for power in disregard of reason and of social well-being. No inherited and ineradicable taint keeps the soul from virtue. Man never was vitiated to the point of losing his divine likeness or his ability to partake of God's grace. Sin springs from the mind and the will of man, from his weakness and ignorance. Salvation comes to him not through the mythical death of a divine savior on a cross or through magical rites and sacraments, whether they be baptism or circumcision, but through the resolute direc tion of his heart and mind away from darkness toward the light of God, through heeding the divine imperatives of personal and social duty, of goodness and of truth.</page></plain_text>
