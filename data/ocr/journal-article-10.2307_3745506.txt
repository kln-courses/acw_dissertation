<plain_text><page sequence="1">RELIGION WITHOUT GOD Principal A. E. GARVIE, M.A., D.D. (i) The poet's words: "A man's reach should exceed his grasp" are not merely a command of what ought to be, they are a descrip? tion of what is. (a) Man has always been stretching himself beyond his own measure. He has a sense of the Infinite: Eternity has been set in his heart: he has not been content to look only on the things seen, his gaze has ever been towards the Unseen. Whatever stage of development he may have reached, he seeks for, and strives after, what is above and beyond himself and his world. In science he tries to get behind the phenomenal reality as his senses apprehend it, to the noumenal, or the explanation of reality, which will satisfy his mind. In philosophy he endeavours to bring the multiplicity of his experience, outer and inner, into a unity that will evidence itself to his reason as coherent, and not contradictory. In morality he is not content with the customs and standards of the society of which he is a member; but conscious of their inadequacy, he conceives and aspires to realize an ideal adequate to his nature; his ought to be is always challenging his is. The impulse or motive (the elan vital) of progress in all spheres of human interest and activity is "the best is yet to be." (b) But it is in his religion most of all that man's reach is beyond his grasp. It is now generally acknowledged that religion is universal in mankind, that there is no tribe, nation, or race, which has not some forms of religious belief and rite, although it has not always been easy for the civilized observer to recognize the religious char? acter of some phenomena of savagelife. Itmay further be contended that, as religion is universal in mankind, so it is necessary to man? hood; for instances can be given of the way in which men have tried to discover or to invent some kind of a substitute for the inherited religion which they had abandoned. Individuals there may be who boast that they have no religion, and who may appear to be doing without it, but closer scrutiny will show that they do have some sort of regulative conception, some sort of determinative attitude to the world around them, which for them takes the place religion otherwise would fill. (2) Many have been the definitions of religion, and varied the theories of its origin. I shall content myself with indicating very briefly three tendencies of thought in this matter, which may be described by the terms rational, practical, and mystical. The first regards religion in respect of its beliefs as an attempt to explain the 203</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES world. It is represented by the theory of animism, which bases religion on a belief in ghosts and spirits, which control the processes of nature for man's weal or woe. The second looks to the end which religion serves; it seeks to give a reason for man's offering prayers and sacrifices to the spirits or gods, in whomhe believes; any theo? retical reason man may have for his belief being thus reinforced by the practical advantage of the belief. Man, according to this view, is religious, because by alliance with and assistance of the spirits or gods he desires and expects to secure his own good, however he may conceive that good. If religion were this or that and no more, it is evident that it would be likely to be superseded as man came to know and understand his world, and as he gained fuller control of its forces by knowledge of its laws. Science on the one hand, and industry on the other, would tend to become the Jacob or supplanter of religion. Neither of these aspects of religion, the theoretical or the practical, is its essential feature, even although religion does offer an explanation of the world, and does help man in his needs. The core of religion is the contact of the human soul with the Divine Spirit, even when crudely conceived as spirits or gods, and worshipped in prayer and sacrifice to seek man's earthly good. To this contact mystics in all ages and religions have borne witness; even in the lowest phases of religion there is a sense of divine possession, and means are used to secure it. (3) This core of religion has been in recent years investigated and expounded in a book, which made a great sensation on its appearance in Germany, namely, R. Otto's Das Heilige, which has been trans? lated by J. W. Harvey into English under the title The Idea of the Holy (Humphrey Milford, 1925). What man thus apprehends as real in his religion is the numinous (from Latin numen) which Otto regards as the best equivalent of the original meaning of the word holy, which has acquired a distinctly ethical reference, not native to it. In justifying his use of the term, Otto states: "By means of a special term we shall the better be able, first to keep the meaning clearly apart and distinct, and second, to apprehend and classify connectedly whatever subordinate forms or stages of development it may show. For this purpose I adopt a word coined from the Latin numen. Omen has given us ominous, and there is no reason why from numen we should not similarly form a word 'numinous.' I shall speak then of a unique 'numinous' category of value and of a definitely 'numinous' state of mind, which is always found wherever the category is applied. This mental state is perfectly sui generis and irreducible to any other; and, therefore, like every absolutely primary and elementary datum, while it admits of being discussed, it cannot be strictly defined. There is only one way to help another to an understanding of it. He must be guided and led on by con- 204</page><page sequence="3">RELIGION WITHOUT GOD sideration and discussion of the matter through the ways of his own mind, until he reach the point at which 'the numinous' in him per- force begins to stir, to start into life and into consciousness. We can co-operate in this process by bringing before his notice all that can be found in other regions of the mind, already known and familiar, to resemble, or again to afford some special contrast to the particular experience we wish to elucidate. . . . In other words, our X cannot, strictly speaking, be taught, it can only be evoked, awakened in the mind; as everything that comes 'of the spirit' must be awakened" (p. 7). "When the numinous is thus felt as objective and outside the self" (p. 11), what is evoked is the 'creature feeling,' a specific form of the 'feeling of dependence' which Schleiermacher regarded as the distinctive mark of religion. The numinous is the mysterium, because it is so 'wholly other' for our feeling. At the beginning of his analysis of the mysterium, Otto quotes Tersteegen: "A God comprehended is no God." The terms transcendent and supernatural are a concep? tual expression of this feeling. This mysterium is tremendum, and this term describes three elements, awfulness, overpoweringness, and energy or urgency. In contrast to this repellent element in the attractive, the mysterium is also fascinum, embracing "Love, Mercy, Pity, Comfort." The numinous to begin with is non-rational and non-moral, but becomes, as religion develops, rationalized and moralized; in other words, religion is not left apart, but is brought into relation with the other elements in the life of man. Otto recog? nizes this need of rationalization and moralization; and injustice is done to him when his name is invoked in support of a non-rational and non-moral representation of religion. (4) To return to the course of the argument from this digression which is relevant to it, it is probable that without this mystical element, the contact of man with God in religion, neither the rational aspect, nor the practical would have come to be. It was because man was conscious of the divine, and his conception or intuition of it developed as indicated by Otto, that he explained his world, or met his own needs as he did in his religion. (a) Otto refers to Schleier? macher, and criticizes his description of religion as 'a feeling of dependence' as too general; but he does recognize that Schleiermacher has the root of the matter in him. Hegel's view of religion as a kind of knowledge, inferior to that of philosophy, or Kant's as a sanction of morality, an apprehension of moral duties as divine commands, has the inadequacy of the rational and the practical view of religion. (b) Attention may be directed to Bergson's insistence on intuition as a more adequate apprehension of reality than is conceptual know? ledge as having some affinity with Otto's view of the apprehension of the numinous. With Eucken too there seems a point of contact. Man must subjectively realize the spiritual life in himself before he o 205</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES can apprehend, come into contact with, the spiritual reality, objec? tive in the Universe. What for the purpose of this essay needs to be emphasized is that religion is not the conclusion of an argument, the premises of which are in something other than itself; man does not believe in and worship God to satisfy his intellectual curiosity, or to gratify his practical necessity, to make his world more intelligible or his life more tolerable; but he has an apprehension of the divine, or rather he has been apprehended by the divine. Paul, the Christian mystic, expresses the truth and the worth of all religion when he states as his aim "that I may apprehend, seeing that also I was apprehended" (Philippians iii. 12, R.V. marg.). Putting the matter in other ways, men have had, and still have experience of God; He becomes as real to them as self and world, and even in their highest moods He is more real than self and world; or men perceive God by an inner, as they perceive the world by an outer, vision; but, just as sense perception is on analysis shown to be a mediated process, although there is no consciousness of the process, but only of the immediate contact with reality, so the perception of God may be analysed, but the mediation which may be discovered does not destroy the immediacy of the contact, or discredit the reality so perceived. (5) I am fully aware that those who do not share this experience, and have never had such a perception, may dismiss religion as a superseded superstition. May I offer three considerations in arrest of such a judgment? (a) This religious experience, this spiritual per? ception, has not been an individual peculiarity; there is a "great cloud of witnesses," who have "endured, as seeing Him who is invisible." Among those witnesses are scholars, thinkers, saints, men of affairs, whose intelligence is keen, character noble, service abun? dant. Is all this testimony to be brushed aside as irrelevant ? (b) Are those who suffer from the privation of what is a general human endowment in a position to challenge the testimony of those whose greatest good in life is just the possession of this capacity for God? Shall a blind man deny that the painter has realized his ideal of beauty in colour and form or the deaf man that the soul of the musician has been revealed in sound? I have purposely used these illustrations, as I am convinced that religion is as natural to man spiritually as light and hearing physically. A natural capacity may atrophy through disuse. Concentration on certain pursuits may involve a limitation of ability to take up and carry on others. The man of science may sacrifice his aesthetic sensibilities, his appre? hension of art or literature. If a man who feels no need of religion, and has no use for it, challenges the truth and worth of religion, I cannot be angry with him, for he may not be to blame; his environ? ment, education, or occupation may be responsible for this depriva- 206</page><page sequence="5">RELIGION WITHOUT GOD tion; but I am sorry for him, as missing what for me gives world and life its supreme value. (c) In a previous number of this Journal I dealt with the distinc? tion, which, as an exponent of the Ritschlian theology, I was one of the first to naturalize in this country, namely, that between appre? hension of fact and appreciation of value. This distinction must be here recalled. It has just been said that there is in religion an appre? hension of God as real; and so there is, and I do not withdraw the claim that religion apprehends fact. Here must be added the con? sideration, however, that the apprehension of the fact is conditioned by the appreciation of values. This is more evident here than in other instances of knowledge; but it is not wholly absent from the others. Dr. Ward has emphasized the truth that in the pursuit of knowledge we are guided by a selective interest. The artist sees in the river something else than the angler. We must have an interest in all those things which are included in or associated with religion, if we are to give that attention to the reality with which religion is concerned which will give us experience of it. There have been religious conversions, in which God seems to fall upon man, to use a religious metaphor, to compel his attention; but as a rule men appre? hend the fact of God only as they appreciate the values which are peculiar or closely related to religion. (6) The tone towards religion to-day is very much more respectful than it used to be. The need of religion is not denied; but some other object is sought for it, offered to it, than God. The history of religion in the past and in the present is regarded as so discreditable, so associated with superstition, irrationality, reaction, and obscurantism that a self-respecting scientist or moralist feels himself not only justified, but even compelled to seek satisfaction for such needs as he may feel elsewhere. For such an attitude there has been some provocation, if not justification. I am not concerned to defend much in theology or piety which offends, truly and rightly, the scientist or the moralist. This Journal is not the place for Christian Apologetics. Having shown what the core of religion is, I shall attempt to show that the substitutes for God which have at different times been pro? posed fail to satisfy man's need. (a) It has sometimes been maintained that Buddhism cannot be regarded as a religion, as in its earlier form (the Hinayana) it had no need of, and made no use of the gods of Hinduism, but substituted for the divine as cosmic principle, the law of Karma, the determina? tion of the conditions of each successive life by the character of the preceding one, and as the deliverance from the chain of existence which it offered was not dependence on divine aid, but a discipline of self-renunciation. Whether, as it does recognize some cosmic prin? ciple, it should be called a religion or not is a question not worth 207</page><page sequence="6">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES discussing. What is significant for the present purpose is this, that this earlier phase of Buddhism was in most Buddhist regions super- seded by the later phase (the Mahayana), because the 'little vehicle' could carry only a few monks to Nirvana, and for the multitude who desired release and bliss the 'large vehicle' was necessary. In this a succession of Btiddhas is deified as Saviours, an interesting witness of what man craves for in his religion. (b) How different is the second illustration in outward features, yet it conveys the samelesson. Auguste Comte, after formulating his Positive Philosophy as superseding the theological and the meta? physical phase of human thought, in which he limited knowledge to phenomena, their resemblances, sequences, and co-existences, con? structed his Positive Polity, or ideal commonwealth, or order of society. But to secure an adequate inspiration for this social recon? struction, he must needs invent his Religion of Humanity, in which he did not deify the whole race, but a selection of its benefactors, gratitude to whom should take the place of the worship of God. Most of those who accepted the philosophy rejected the polity; and the Religion of Humanity remains a fond fancy of a coterie; it has not captured the allegiance, because it does not meet the needs of mankind. (c) One who has recently been travelling in China, India, and Russia supplied me with what seem also relevant illustrations. The intelligenzia of China, India, and Russia have abandoned religion as a worship of gods or God. It has become secularized by its culture and civilization; but nevertheless in each country there is an object of devotion in its intensity often approaching worship. Sun-yat-Sen in China, Ghandi in India, and Lenin in Russia are being exalted as the inspiration of the national movement. In Japan Shintoism sur- vives, amid modern science and industry, as a deification of the imperial line, and patriotism is a religion. One may conjecture that amid the break-up of the old cults in Rome, the deification of the Emperor similarly met the human need of some personal object of worship and devotion. It is, however, the ascription of personality in any form at which modern naturalism or humanism takes offence, and for which it seeks to find some adequate substitute. (7) Let us glance at the latest of these proferred substitutes and ask if they will really serve. The religious traditions of the past with belief in a personal God are set aside as outworn; it is physical science and humanitarian interest and effort which are to be the bases of religion. Two illustrations will suffice. (a) According to Professor Alexander, "The infinite God is purely ideal or conceptual. As actual God does not possess the quality of deity, but is the uni? verse as tending to that quality. This nisus in the universe, though not present to sense, is yet present to reflexion upon experience. 208</page><page sequence="7">RELIGION WITHOUT GOD Only in this sense of straining towards deity can there be an infinite actual God." "God as an actual existent is always becoming deity but never attains it. He is the ideal God in embryo. The ideal when fulfilled ceases to be God, and yet it gives shape and character to our conception of the actual God, and always tends to usurp its place in our fancy." * The elan vital, the creative Evolution, the emergent is God. Whether this be or be not a legitimate metaphysical conclusion I do not now inquire; it certainly has no correspondence with the religious consciousness in its historical development. (b) Julian Huxley does not base his criticism on metaphysics, which he eschews. He seeks a solution of the problem of reality in a religion which will meet the needs, moral and social, of the modern man. Ideals and values are for him emerging in the Evolution of the Universe; and it is man's duty and privilege to co-operate with that cosmic trend. It is within the mind of man?in these ideals and values?that the Universe at last becomes God.2 It is nature as evolving into and consummated in man which is offered as the object (can we say of worship?) at least of devotion and service. (c) What may be said of both these theories is this: What is offered us here as the interpretation of the process of evolution, its idealization and deification, is not strictly science; it is not the inevitable conclusion to which an explanation in the terms of science would lead. It cannot, therefore, be offered to us in the name, or with the authority of science; it is a speculative philosophy. The data of science, as T. H. Huxley interpretated them, led him to paint a sharp contrast between the cosmic process and the moral progress of man. And the theist finds a challenge to, and not a con- firmation of, his belief in God in much that the evolution of the Universe discloses. One must feel that the idealism and optimism of the substitute offered for Christianity is a survival in those who now reject it of ideas and ideals historically bound up in the Christian faith. (8) There are two related considerations which I venture to advance. (a) Bergson's idea of creative, or Professor Lloyd Morgan's of emergent evolution, seem to me to be useful descriptions of the phenomenal, and are valuable as disproving the Spencerian philo? sophy, which attempted to resolve all phenomena, psychic and vital, 1 Space, Time, and Deity, vol. ii, pp. 361 and 365. Mr. Edmond Holmes has in the Hibbert Journal, vol. xxviii, pp. 48-68, subjected this metaphysics, which out of Space Time as matrix or stuff derives matter, life, mind, God, to a searching criticism. 3 Christopher Dawson, in his Progress and Religion, p. 240, quotes two lines from one of Huxley's earlier sonnets which briefly states his creed:? "The Universe can live and work and plan, At last made God within the mind of Man.: 209</page><page sequence="8">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES into matter-in-motion. Something new does appear at each successive stage of evolution, which could not be anticipated from, and could not be explained by what appeared at the previous stage. When this is offered as an ultimate interpretation of reality, then my mind rebels against it. Ex nihilo nihil fit. For my thinking, what is imma- nently evolved must be transcendently involved; cosmic evolution I can make intelligible to myself only as divine creation. What emerges phenom?nally must exist noumenally. An 'evolving God' is an absurdity for my reason, as it is an offence for my religious sensi- bility. The 'creature feeling' of which Otto speaks, as man's response to the numinous reality, can in my judgment be justified by rational thought. Man always in his religion has reached above and beyond his world and self; and has contrasted in his thought his own limita? tions with the Infinite and Absolute. The Universe is for me much more rationally interpretated as having its source in a transcendent Creator than as the evolution of an immanent God. Professor Alexander and Professor Huxley are taking illegitimate liberties with the word God, to which religion does attach a definite meaning, in using it as they do for the emerging ideals or values, which have their highest expression in man. These ideals have their categorical authority for man because he believes that they are eternally real in God; and his appreciation of these values is not for him their full measure. My moral conscience, my religious consciousness, as well as my intelligence, cannot accept these last substitutes for the God of religion as the idea has developed in history. (b) But since these thinkers do find the consummation of the cosmic evolution in man?in his ideals and values?the objection to ascribing personality to God seems to be greatly weakened, if not altogether removed. We cannot be altogether astray when we think of God as at least personal, as disclosing if not the whole secret of His nature, yet a part of the mystery which is not misleading for our thought in what evolution has finally created, or what is the highest which has emerged (to adopt the current language). This certainly is better than Spencer's procedure, who after refusing to describe as personal the ultimate reality, the existence of which he recognized, although he insisted that it could not be known, on the ground that there might be something much higher, went on to explain the Universe by a category much lower than the personal. If Professor Alexander and Professor Huxley are pleased to call the cosmic evolution as consummated in man God, religion may be excused for describing the transcendent God as personal, as pos? sessing the highest ideals and values which the life of man discloses, but absolutely perfectly, eternally, and not partially and imperfectly as man, even at his best, possesses them. If this ascription of per? sonality to God is condemned as anthropomorphism, we may remind 210</page><page sequence="9">RELIGION WITHOUT GOD ourselves that the categories, formulae, and hypotheses by which science interprets the world are no less products of the mind of man. "We have," says Professor Eddington, "to build the spiritual world out of symbols taken from our own personality, as we build the scientific world out of the symbols of the mathematician. I think, therefore, we are not wrong in embodying the significance of the spiritual world to ourselves in the feeling of a personal relationship, for our whole approach to it is bound up with those aspects of con? sciousness in which personality is centred." r Eucken distinguishes between universal and characteristic religion, the recognition of spiritual reality in philosophy, art, morals, etc, and the realization of that spiritual reality in personal experience; and here he acknow- ledges that it must be conceived as personal. Religion must speak to a God who hears, and the human spirit must meet the Divine Spirit in immediate contact and intimate communion. Religion needs God the Holy, and cannot accept instead of Him man's ideals and values as the consummation of the cosmic evolution. (9) After the preceding pages had been written, there came into my hand Mr. J. Middleton Murry's book, God, Being an Introduction to the Science of Metabiology. No attempt to review the book as a whole is being made here, but only what concerns the subject of this essay will be brought under consideration. The author attracted considerable attention, and secured an appreciation for his work which in my judgment far exceeded its intrinsic merits by The Life of Jesus. (a) In the interesting but painful autobiography, which forms about a third of this new work, he gives an account of a mystical experience through which he passed, in which he was all at once borne out of distress of mind into peace, in which he found himself reconciled to the Universe. "A moment came," he writes, "when the darkness of that ocean changed to light, the cold to warmth; when it swept in one great wave over the shores and frontiers of myself, when it bathed me and I was renewed; when the room was filled with a presence, and I knew I was not alone?that I never could be alone any more, that the Universe beyond held no menace, for I was part of it, that in some way for which I had sought in vain so many years, I belonged, and because I belonged I was no longer I, but something different, which could never be afraid in the old ways or cowardly with the old cowardice." 2 One is reminded of the passage of the hero of Carlyle's Sartor Resartus from the Ever- lasting No to the Everlasting Yea. The discovery was not, however, of God; for although the author expresses a profound admiration of Jesus, and considers his own attitude to life as akin to His, yet he regards Jesus as Man only, although the New Man, of which other examples, though less familiar, do exist as a significant variation in 1 Science and the Unseen World. a God, p. 36. 211</page><page sequence="10">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES the process of evolution. He rejects His resurrection and miracles, all that is supernatural with vehemence, and is, therefore, compelled to dismiss Jesus' consciousness as Son of God as Father, and His hope of attaining Messiahship by His death as illusion. How far his appre? ciation of Jesus differs from that of all Christian believers may appear from the following sentence: "Whereas I am in no danger of discovering that I am like the founder of Christianity,1 D. H. Lawrence veritably is. He happens to be more like him than any man who has lived for the past fifty years, unless perchance it were that other anti-Christian, Friedrich Nietzsche."2 The mystical experience, which he ascribes to Jesus also, is for him the same as the anaesthetic experience; and his book is "the record of the way by which one man succeeded in disintoxicating himself from a mystical experience. "3 (b) While he recognizes that religion as usually understood as faith in God has served to effect for men the reconciliation with the Universe which he has experienced, he himself has no further need of God. "Religion," he says, "depends upon the hypostatiza- tion of values; that is, their detachment from the significant varia? tions in which they emerge, and which they are. God is the focus in which the whole galaxy of detached values is concentrated." 4 Truth, Beauty, Goodness emerge in the evolution as 'significant variations'; they are detached from the process, hypostatized and focussed in God?the Father in the Christian Trinity. Besides the God of values, there is the God of immediate experience, which is in like manner hypostatized and focussed. But "the unity of immediate experience, by whatever arduous contemplation it is reached, is always biological unity. Between the God of experience and the God of values there is, in reality, no communication whatever. It is only illusion by which they are identified." This God of experience would correspond to the Holy Spirit in the Christian doctrine. "There is yet a third God?not wholly peculiar to Christianity, but represented with unique emphasis in Christianity. This is the incarnate God. He is again totally different from the God of values, or the God of experience. He is a value actually emergent, a real and significant organic variation." 5 The reference is here to Jesus, and the ascrip? tion of divinity to Him as Son. "These three Gods, all utterly different, the God of values, the God of immediate experience, and the incarnate God, are inextricably intertwined in the Christian religion." 6 This brilliant, if often perverse, analysis indicates the value for religion which he is prepared to assign to this conception. A mechanistic science can never displace it, but the author believes 1 Despite this disclaimer, the author sometimes writes as if he were. 2 Op. cit., pp. 263-264. 3 P. 311. 4 Op. cit., p. 211. 5 P. 213. 6 P. 215. 212</page><page sequence="11">RELIGION WITHOUT GOD that his own metabiological science can and will. It is thus he dis- misses the Christian conception of God: "Of the three separate Gods which are thus incorporated in the Christian religion, we may say, in accord with our previous examination, that the God of values is intellectual fiction, though once necessary fiction; that the God of immediate experience is a means of describing a real and potentially significant experience; and that the incarnate God is real, but because he is incarnate he is not God."1 It is one merit in this book that it so frankly dismissed the Christian idea of God, and does not under cover of the name God introduce an altogether incongruous conception. (c) What the writer substitutes is a consistent naturalism; and against any belief in the supernatural he loses good temper and good manners. "Teil me that now in the year 1929 you veritably believe that Jesus rose bodily from the dead with the same simple conviction with which you believe that you are to-day alive, and will one day die, then I say that your world is a chaos, and more than this, that I believe you to be a liar." 2 Comment on such a method of argument is unnecessary. The author, however, has his quarrel with the mechanistic naturalism, with the ordinary bio? logical view. And he formulates what he calls the science of meta- biology. He coins this word lest, I suppose, by using such a term as psychology, he might appear to favour any conception of the soul or personality as distinguished from the body. He does distinguish biological life and metabiological Life, but is insistent on continuity in the process of evolution. Life is the achievement by man of his own coherent unity, and then of his coherent unity with the Universe as one organism. The man who achieves this can be regarded as "a significant variation" emerging in the continuous process. "What are in the common language of the day distinguished as 'values' are the qualities of those variations to which the individual consciously and deliberately responds."3 While these variations themselves are objective, actual in the Universe, the choice among them is entirely personal; but the individual will usually find himself in a company: "a whole succesion of individuals have responded before him." There is not, however, a standard of values. "The choice which are the 'higher' and which are the 'lower' variations is a personal matter; that choice is simply the record of the variations to which the indi? vidual investigator consciously responds." 4 "Conscious response, conscious refusal to respond; deliberate perpetuation, deliberate refusal to perpetuate?these are the facts concerning values." 5 Man in this science takes the place of God; in him alone are the con? tradictions of the Universe to be reconciled, and its great values to * P. 216. 2 P. 83. 3 Op. cit., pp. 206-207. 4 P. 207. 5 P. 208. 213</page><page sequence="12">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES be perpetuated. Man in his own newness must accept himself instead of God, having reached beyond life to Life, beyond the biological to the metabiological stage. But this newness gives no promise of immortality, and raises beyond responsibility. "It lies with the individual to decide what variations he will strive to perpetuate. This is, if you like, his moral duty. The point on which we insist is that he cannot help himself. He is merely a self-conscious organism responding by metabiological modes to previous or present varia? tions." x There is no ideal to be realized by free action; there is simply the real to be recognized and responded to, because one can? not help oneself. "You need not worry yourself about the existence of the ideal. Simple inspection will show you that it has existed and does exist, only not as the Ideal. When the ideal exists it is simply the real; it is embodied in some thing or some person. What you imagined to be a response to the ideal is simply a response to the real, and you who respond are part of the real."2 This Naturalism is therefore also a Realism. What alone exists is a natural evolution with a metabiological as well as a biological stage, in which emerge values in things and persons as significant variations. The author quite clearly regards himself as a significant variation, a value, to which there should be a response, and which deserves to be per? petuated. (d) I must confess myself a variation not significant enough to respond to, or to perpetuate the value of his metabiological science. There is in this book brilliant writing, subtle analysis, startling paradox, and at times a surprising appreciation of some values, which he is forced to dismiss as illusions; but I find no convincing argument or constraining appeal. With so insignificant a variation as Kant I cannot help myself (to use his language) in believing in the practical reason, the categorical imperative, the postulate of God, freedom, and immortality. Yea more, with "the new man" for whom the author expresses often what is a moving admiration, Jesus, I cannot help believing still in a Father in Heaven, the reality of all ideals, in the God Incarnate, and the God, who as Spirit in my inner experience is reassuring me that here is no illusion, but reality. The substitute he provides may satisfy the author; the witness of human history supports the assumption, that many men have felt and still feel their need of God. and that they can find rest unto their souls only by coming to Him, who, meek and lowly in heart, knows and can reveal the Father. Although the author disclaims having a religion, and offers us a science instead, such an interpretation of the Universe, with the practical personal attitude which accompanies it, is not a science, it is a religion; and as a religion is without God; it is not at all likely to become so contagious, that his "madness in a new 1 P. 291. * Pp. 308-309. 214</page><page sequence="13">RELIGION WITHOUT GOD way," as he in his closing words describes his "variation" and "value" will "ultimately be sane." I Such philosophies as these which have been here mentioned are a challenge to all Christian theologians to examine their philosophical presuppositions, to familiarize themselves with the conclusions of science, to appreciate its methods, purpose, and motive; and then so to formulate the doctrines which interpret the experience of Christ- ians that they can offer men a religion, which, while adequate to the present intellectual situation, is not mutilated as must be any religion which is without God. 1 Op. cit., p. 317. 215</page></plain_text>
