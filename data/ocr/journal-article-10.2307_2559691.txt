<plain_text><page sequence="1">156 BOOK REVIEWS BRVCHER, H. 1989. Useful plants of Neotropical origin and their wild relatives, Springer Verlag, Berlin. x + 296 pages. ISBN 3-540-18743-X. Price: DM 198.00. Before the European Conquest of America more than one hundred different plants had been brought into cultivation by the native population of the New World. The list includes major international food crops such1 as maize, potato, manioc and peanuts; many varieties of aromatics and narcotics; spices such as chili peppers and vanilla; fruits such as pineapple and papaya, and tomato and cacao - the last two still known under their Mcxican (nahuatl) names: tomatl and chocolatl. In addition, American cottons are the basis of all modern commercial varieties and our twentieth-century industrialized world would be almost inconceivable without rubber. The book under review addresses the above mentioned topic and includcs over 150 useful plants that originated mainly in tropical America. It presents 'critical aspects of endangered species', the genetic erosion of the ancestors of primitive cultivars. Emphasis is placed on the fact that it was the 'indians' who domesticated and improved in quantity and quality the yield of numerous crop plants. In an encyclopedic fashion names, origins, history, morphology, ecology, diseases, pests, uses and aspects of marketing and productivity are covered. It is certainly a book that might be of interest not only to agronomists, anthropologists, biotechnologists, botanists, ecologists, geneticists and pharmacologists, but also to planners and policy makers interested in one of the world's most serious problems: feeding humankind and fighting undernourishment. Unfortunately, contradictory opinions, outdated information, value judgements, ethnocentric statements, misspellings, some incomplete and/or obsolete referenices, and poor editing make one wonder why Springer Verlag published such an unscholarly book on what is so timely and exciting a subject matter. One gets the impression that it was written in German at least twenty years ago and translated into English without the participation of a competent editorial board. No one at present can claim to be an expert in so many different topics, but consultation withl colleagues and specialists in fields other than one's own is a healthy practice in modern science. Some examples that touch upon anthropological aspects in the book will suffice to make the point. Examples of contradictory opinions are: (p. 22) 'the potato has developed from a neglected Indian food plant to the most important tuber crop of Europe'. This is absurd, since on the basis of extensive archaeological and ethnohistorical evidence, we know that the potato was a basic staple in the Andes since at least 8000 years ago, a fact that Brucher admits later (p. 23) by saying 'conservatively, we may consider that for 6000 years Indians have eaten potatoes'. In the introduction (p. 1) the author states: 'This successful event [the domestication of useful plants] would have been unthinkable without the active intervention of man. In this case the reward for notable breeding abilities goes to the Amerindian tribes in Meso- and South America'. Why then, does he say (p. 166) 'primitive indian planters'? Outdated information is given regarding the antiquity of manioc cultivation. Following Rouse &amp; Cruxent (1963) Brucher states that the oldest evidence was 'discovered in Ranchlo Peludo, near Lake Maracaibo [Venezuela] dated at 2700 BC'. (p. 11). Since the 1980's we have known that the oldest date of Rancho Peludo is around 300 BC and that evidence of manioc cultivationi cannot be demonstrated. The previous claim was based on the presence of 'putative fragments of clay griddles, called 'budares', that provide indirect evidence for the presence of bitter manioc in archaeological contexts, but these turned out to be fragments of multi-legged vessels that served as supports for the anthropomorphic urns (Nuiiez-Regueiro et al. 1985). Then we find value judgements such as the following, concerning the avocado (p. 229) 'Ahuacatl is the common name in Aztec idiom. From this grotesque word corruptions developed like 'abacata' (Portuguese ... )'. Why grotesque and corruptions? Concerning the chili we learn 'Occasionally the 'aji' were used also for ritual purposes, notably for virility tests. This objectionable custom of feeding the young men with food with high doses of pungent peppers still persists, as I have personally observed in the Upper Orinoco region living together with nomadic Indios of the Makarikare tribe' (p. 167). First of all, the objectionable custom is an ethnocentric judgement: to whom is it objectionable? Second, he seems to be referring to a Carib-speaking agriculturalist tribe (not nomads) known as the Maquiritare by the general public, and finally, the use of chili by these indians is not for virility tests but for medicinal purposes (Nelly Arvelo, personal communication) . Obsolete names, non-valid species and frequent misspellings are also common in the description of several crops. As one example among many, in the description of the bromeliad genera Ananas</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 157 and Pseudananas (p. 250-255) the author does not refer to the most recent treatment of the subfamily (Smith &amp; Downs 1979) and therefore describes as different species Ananas guaraniticus and A. ananassoides and A. microcephalus and Pseudananas sagenarius (misspelled in the text as Pseudoananas sagitarius). Similarly the obsolete name of A. erectifolius is used instead of A. lucidus. The treatment of tobacco (pp. 180-185) could have benefitted not so much from Wilbert's 1972 article, but by consulting Wilbert 1987. In the recent reference, this author covers exhaustively such aspects as wild and cultivated nicotianas, methods of tobacco use and the pharmacology of shamanism in South America. The treatment of historical sources is extremely questionable as the exactness of titles, dates and citations. On p. 103 it should read 'Historia General y Natural de las Indias, Islas, y Tierra Firme del Mar Oceano', and on p. 22, Figure 1.9 should be 'Poma de Ayala 1615' instead of 1520, and is not included in the references. And finally, on p. 296 we learn that Oviedo 'created' 400 years ago the term 'savanna'. This prehispanic Arawak word of the Antillean Taino Indians was at best borrowed from the natives of the Caribbean Islands by the first European Conquistadores, and not created by them.
