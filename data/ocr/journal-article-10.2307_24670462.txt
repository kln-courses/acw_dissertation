(Orientalia judaicajudaica christiana 2). Piscataway (NJ): Gorgias Press, 2009. Pp. xx, 302. Hard back. US$ 110.00. ISBN 978-1-60724-407-3. During the last few years Andrei Orlov has promoted the study of Slavonic Pseude pigrapha with many contributions. In addition to his book "The Enoch-Metatron Tradition" 2005 (see my review in DSD 16 [2009]: 145-149), he has published a series of articles (between 1998 and 2009) which cover a wide spectrum of texts and topics concerning the mystical experience in the Jewish and Christian traditions. A first collection of articles appeared in 2007 (From Apocalypticism to MerkabahMerkabah Mysticism: Studies in the Slavonic Pseudepigraphia·, JSJSup 114; Brill, Leiden); a second one followed in 2009 (Selected Studies in the Slavonic Pseude pigrapha־,pigrapha־, SVTP 23; Brill, Leiden; see review below), accompanied by the present volume in the same year. Though all these essays have not really been inaccessible (in journals like VC, JSP, JJS, JSJ, Bib, Henoch and others), it is convenient to have them again now between two covers. The volume to be reviewed here contains twelve essays published between 2001 and 2009. Only the opening introduction has been written specifically for the purpose of this collection. It picks up the leading topic indicated by the title and is clearly of a programmatic character. Five essays had already been repub lished two years ago in the collection of 2007, eight other articles were republished simultaneously in the volume "Selected studies..."—that means they have all now been published three times. Two of them have been announced here and there as forthcoming in respectable journals (CBQ and HTR) parallel to both collections; one wonders about the reverted sequence and the triple publication in the same year 2009. A similar overlap is found concerning the two structurally identical vast bibliographies about the Jewish Pseudepigrapha in the Slavic Milieux—96 and 231 pages—in the volumes of 2007 (From Apocalypticism) and 2009 (Selected Studies)·,Studies)·, anyway here the last version is not only repeated but also expanded in some categories and completed with more recent literature. Such a strategy of publishing the same essays over a short span of time three times in different places raises some questions. It certainly helps to spread ones own studies over a wider public to gain more attention for them. But, regard ing the escalating literary production of our time, perhaps less would be more. The main problem is that all these essays have just been reprinted without any substantial revision. One looks in vain for a preface referring to the recent state of debate. There are some changes in format and style but not in content. This is a pity—because, in some cases, there has been ongoing discussion meanwhile. Second or third editions are best justified by improvement and not by repetition alone. Otherwise scholarly manifestation predominates over scholarly discussion. So I understand my following review less as an announcement and more as an attempt to bring these essays into discussion again.

They are arranged in two parts. The first is dedicated to "The Divine Body Traditions" (seven essays), the second to "The Divine Name Traditions" (six essays). The sources are at least three books solely preserved in the Slavonic language. Five essays deal with the 2 Enoch, four with the Apocalypse of Abraham, one with the Ladder ofJakob; not part of the so-called Slavonic Pseudepigapha are the Exagoge of Ezekiel the Tragedian (two essays) and the Macarian Homilies (one). All these texts are reflections on the experience of patriarchs and mystics who have entered the divine realms. Obviously it is due to the series Orientalia Judaica Christiana that this volume stresses particularly the relation between apocalyptic and patristic visionary traditions. The first essay has the function of introducing the topic: "The Kavod and Shem Paradigms and Divine Manifestations in the Slavonic Pseudepigrapha." It tries "to explore the formative theophanic patterns found in such pseudepigraphical writings as 2 Enoch, Apocalypse of Abraham, and the Ladder ofJacob", starting with some instructive episodes in the Apophtegmata Patrum. Basically Orlov describes two "paradigms": first the visual encounter with the divine which is deeply rooted in archaic anthropomorphic ideas and which underwent a revival in later myst cism, second the aural encounter with the divine voice closely connected with a theology of the divine name. These kabod- and */׳ew-paradigms may be traced back to the theophanic accounts in the Hebrew Bible concerning Moses and Eli jah whereas we may observe the well-known shift in "Deuteronomy's switch of the revelatory axis from the visual to the aural plane." Both found their way into extra-biblical traditions—among the pseudepigrapha, rabbinic or patristic writ ings. 2 Enoch is the best example or the "apex of the visual theophanic paradigm in which the Kavod theology receives possibly its most elaborate articulation"; in contrast, the Apocalypse of Abraham represents the other paradigm "expressing the divine Presence in the form of the Deity's voice". So far so clear. But is it neces sary to really perceive here again something like a "polemical interplay" between both revelatory trends (which becomes the red thread through all the following articles)? Could it not be only the trace of complex theophanic traditions which differ in function? Most of all: how should I understand that patterns found in the Slavonic Pseudepigrapha "provide the rich conceptual soil for the subsequent elaborations prominent in later patristic and rabbinic developments"? For the des ert fathers it was enough to be familiar with the biblical narratives which is true as well for the Rabbinic literature, while Pseudepigrapha like 2 Enoch and Apocalypse of Abraham of Abraham presuppose a long and complicated history of transmission including also an obvious influence of early Jewish mysticism in the meanwhile. Part I (The Divine Body Traditions) starts with an essay entitled " 'Without Measure and Without Analogy': The Tradition of the Divine Body in 2 (Slavonic) Enoch"Enoch" The theophanic kabod paradigm has one of its most exciting expressions in 2 En 39 which clearly reflects the Shi'ur Qoma motif. But it should be men tioned here that there is a longer discussion about the uncertain textual basis of</page><page sequence="3">Review of Books / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 43 (2012) 80-139 113 this chapter, possibly being part of a secondary stratum. Looking for wider con textual relations in 2 Enoch, Orlov investigates the Adamic tradition correspond ing to Enoch's corporality. Here we find indeed a lot of similar features, but the main objection remains: Adam's creation from the four corners of the world in 2En has nothing to do with the motif of his original supranatural size, rather it depicts him simply as an integral part of the whole creation in a universal perspec tive; the interest in Enoch's bodily dimension belongs originally to the Hekhalot tradition while 2En is only interested in his transformation into an angelic being. So the roots of Shi'ur Qoma speculation must be detected far beyond the network of motifs we can identify in 2 Enoch itself. "The Pillar of the World: The Eschatological Role of the Seventh Antedelu vian Hero in 2 (Slavonic) Enoch." In short, this essay points to the well-known pattern of the relation between primordial time and endtime in apocalyptic thinking—analysing the peculiar scheme of "aions" in 2 Enoch and its correspon dence to the figure of Enoch. The protological desintegration will be overcome by the eschatological reintegration which has an personal equivalent in Enochs role as a righteous one. Except for some details like the postulated "redeeming-role" of the patriarch (see below), it gives a true picture of the "formative value of the conceptual developments found in the Slavonic apocalypse" for the later mystical tradition. Here are the roots of the idea of Enoch-Metatron as an eschatological foundation or "pillar" of the world. So the essay describes one more detail which proves the transitional character of 2 Enoch. "The Face as the Heavenly Counterpart of the Visionary in the Slavonic Lad derder of Jacob" deals with a text which is still widely uninvestigated up to now. First of all that is due to its difficult textual transmission which leaves many questions open. The article jumps over these problems and concentrates on a single point: the theophanic paradigm of the story in Gen 28; 32 and its reception in the Lad. Jac.Jac. Comparing Lad. Jac. 2 with 2 En 22 and Targum Pseudo-Jonathan to Gen 28, Orlov interprets the "fiery face" in these visions as a representation of God's kabodkabod as well as a representation of Jacob's image, something like his "heavenly counterpart." The well-known idea of the visionary's two identities—the human, earthly one and the one in God's presence, has an irritating complexity here. It corresponds to the figure of Sariel / Uriel / Vrevoil / Phanuel who appears as ange InsIns interpres and seems to be a symbol of God's visibility. The problem is obvious: there is no real distinction between God's glory and the visionary's heavenly mode of existence. Unfolding the set of similar texts Orlov is preparing the ground for further questions. What is the function of the fiery face in the context of revela tion? What does it tell us about God and how does it affect the visionary? Perhaps the Lad. Jac. could become a key text to disclose the whole "counterpart" idea in further research? "" 'Many Lamps are Lightened from the One': Paradigms of the Transformational Vision in the Macarian Homilies" is one of two articles comparing the pseude pigraphal material mainly with patristic traditions. In this case Orlov presents</page><page sequence="4">1 14 Review of Books / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 43 (2012) 80-139 22 Enoch and a passage from the Philokalia as two key points "of a long-lasting theological journey from the outer transformational vision to its inner counter part" in Eastern Christianity. Most revealing on this journey is the treatment of Adam's creation and fall in the Macarian homilies. The previous Jewish idea of "the 'inner' luminous tselem" was also known in Christian circles and became— connected with the Gospel's transfiguration story—the nucleus for a tendency to gradual "interiorization" of the originally external mystical experience. All these observations are based on very diverse material. So the question arises: is it neces sary to trace a real line of development or a real shift of a paradigm here—or do we only have two different forms of mystical experience independent of each other and parallel already from the beginning of biblical interpretation? "Moses' Heavenly Counterpart in the Book of Jubilees" picks up again the idea already discussed with Lad. Jac. 2, expanding the material of 2 Enoch, Ladder of Jacob,Jacob, Exagoge Ezekiel and the Targumim with a discussion of Jubilees. In the end, Orlov asks the question whether this idea may also draw us nearer "to the very heart of the pseudepigraphical enterprise" itself or could offer us more insights into the "aesthetics of penmanship"—a question which is indeed worth following up, including all the wider material concerning heavenly books and scribes. "Resurrection of Adam's Body: The Redeeming Role of Enoch-Metatron in 2 (Slavonic)(Slavonic) Enoch" seems to be the elaboration of a passage in Orlov's book about the Enoch-Metatron tradition (232-234). There is a fundamental dissent between us whether such a "redeeming role" can be found in 2 Enoch at all. The only tex tual basis is 2 En 64:5 which addresses Enoch according to Andersen's translation as "the one who carried away the sin of humankind." But the verb 'otimati' is an imperfective one, so that it should be translated better in the present form ("who carries away"). Not only for grammatical reasons but also forced by the context, this phrase cannot have another meaning. The elders, who are entreating Enoch in this place, only express their wish or expectation, but do not definitely refer to an obvious fact or a promise stated elsewhere. Their desire can be paraphrased in the following way: "When you are back again before God's throne, please think of us because the Lord has chosen and preferred you, so that you may carry away our sins." Nothing is said about any reaction, but the careful reader of the book should already know that such an expectation must lead one astray. In other places (2 En 7:4-5; 53:1-3), every kind of intercession is strictly rejected. The strongest statement is found in 53:1-2 (longer recension): "So now my children do not say, Our father is with God, and he will stand in front of God for us, and he will pray for us concerning our sin.' For there is no helper there—not even for one person who has sinned." This is the main line of the book and absolutely coherent with its strict ethical teaching. I have discussed it most recently again in my article about Biblische Figuren im slavischen Henoch-Buch (in: Biblical Figures in Deutero canonical canonical and Cognate Literature, [ed. H. Lichtenberger und U. Mittmann-Rich ert; Berlin 2009], 303-335, esp. 308-309).</page><page sequence="5">Review of Books / Journal for the Study of Judaism 43 (2012) 80-139 115 "In the Mirror of the Divine Face: The Enochic Features of the Exagoge of EzekielEzekiel the Tragedian," investigates the possible relations between the Exagoge and the Enoch traditions. Following some features like oneiromantic dreams, the heavenly ascent, the figure of an angelus interpres, esoteric knowledge, again the idea of the visionary's heavenly counterpart, astronomical items and the motif of transforming the seer's face, Orlov demonstrates convincingly the mutual relation between both literary traditions. There cannot be any doubt: Moses is painted in the Exagoge with colours borrowed from the Enoch tradition. But does this indi cate really a "competitive environment", a "rival paradigm," a "challenge of the pseudepigraphic Enoch to the biblical Moses," a "polemical interaction between Mosaic and Enochic traditions" and so on? We have discussed a similar question already concerning the "polemical nature" of 2 Enoch postulated by Orlov—where my contrary position is: 2 Enoch tries much more to integrate different traditions, to coordinate and transform them in order to justify a new modus vivendi in the diaspora situation. Could it not be the same with the Exgagoge? If the hero of a scripture functions as patron or frontman of a certain group with specific theo logical interests, is it necessary to understand him exclusively in the context of dis sent and struggle? Why could it not be an attempt, for example, to legitimate the Mosaic tora dating it back to primordial time via Enoch or, the other way round, to legitimate the mystical experience linking it strictly to the Mosaic law? Is it even imaginable that any Jewish group of this time could have an interest in undermin ing Mosaic authority, so that others would have to defend or to re-establish it? Moses is the unquestioned and basic authority for all Judaisms instead of all their diversity, so that mutual influences between him and other figures seem to simply use different potentials. Part II (The Divine Name Traditions) opens with an essay about the "Praxis of the Voice: The Divine Name Traditions in the Apocalypse of Abraham!' At the beginning of part two, Orlov examines the Apocalypse of Abraham as the most prominent example of the "Shem-paradigm." Its text is not only "reluctant to endorse... the anthropomorphic depiction of the Glory of God" but offers real "anti-anthropomorphic tendencies." The main context of such an "aural mysti cism" of the divine voice in this essay is the lore between the Hebrew bible and the Merkabah texts. But surprisingly the rabbinic tradition of the "Bat Qol" (cf. the fundamental publications about this phenomenon by Peter Kuhn in 1989) is not discussed here; it could help to sharpen the peculiar picture we find in this strange little Apocalypse and should be included in further research. "Celestial Choir-Master: The Liturgical Role of Enoch-Metatron in 2 Enoch and the Merkabah Tradition." Only the Book of Jubilees and Sefer Hekhalot depict Enoch clearly as a figure with a priestly function. Whereas the older Enoch texts hesitate to do so, the later Merkabah literature develops the exalted patriarch to nothing less than a "celestial choir-master". After exploring all this material, Orlov turns to 2 Enoch—and discovers here what was still missing in 1 Enoch (but present</page><page sequence="6">116 Review of Books / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 43 (2012) 80-139 in Jubilees). These observations were already part of his dissertation published in 2005· But I cannot find any new argument for a priestly Enoch in the Slavonic text which does not project items from later mystical traditions back into 2 Enoch. Enoch's role here is mainly connected with scribal functions, but not with priestly responsibility. To take part in the service around Gods throne means no more than the behavior of every other inhabitant of the seventh heaven and cannot be called a "priestly activity" or "sacerdotal dimension." The arguments are weak: Enochs transformation in 2 En 22 by anointing and clothing in luminous gar ments makes him "one of the glorious ones" (namely an archangel) but definitely not a priest; when he instructs his sons about the right sacrificial practice and when these sons start a priestly cult after his final translation, there is no need of a prior heavenly priestly qualification; to encourage the Watchers in the fifth heaven to take part in the service is only pastoral advice but not a priestly activity. My strongest disagreement is about the postulated titles "Servant of God's face " and "Youth" which have been already a subject of our discussion. The Sar-ha-Panim imagery is based mainly on 2 En 39, a chapter with an uncertain textual situa tion; the "Youth" is found only in short manuscripts (B/V/A), most of the places are corrupted and the usage as such is inconsistent. All these problems should be discussed or mentioned at least, but merely to claim and repeat a postulate again does not make the thin ice thicker. There is no priestly role of the visionary in 2 En except for his participation in the angelic liturgical service. "The Pteromorphic Angelology of the Apocalypse of Abraham" picks up an observation by A. Kulik concerning the form of the angel Yahoel. One phrase used for his description may be best translated with "the appearance of the grif fin's body" which would refer to the angel's eagle-like shape. Looking for other similar items in the Apocalypse of Abraham (like the journey on the turtledove's and pigeon's wings or like Azazel as an impure bird), Orlov comes to a very plausible conclusion: the main line of the book is to insist on the invisibility not only of God but also of most classes of angelic beings; where the author cannot keep the heavenly figures completely invisible because of the narration's demands, he attri butes to them not an anthropomorphic but an pteropmorphic character. "" 'The Gods of my Father Terah': Abraham the Iconoclast and Polemics with the Divine Body Traditions in the Apocalypse of Abraham", interprets the text as the story of a "young hero of faith who travels from the destroyed terrestrial sanctuary polluted by the idols of his father to the heavenly temple." In the first part (1-8) "the iconoclastic thrust of the patriarch's story" offers "an ideal literary setting for the unfolding of polemics with traditions of divine corporality." Even if one is not willing to agree with all these polemic assumptions, nevertheless the emphasis on the strict invisibility of the divine beings may be regarded as the most convincing link between the two otherwise so different parts of the book as a whole. "The Watchers of Satanail: The Fallen Angels Traditions in 2 (Second) Enoch" deals with a very complicated matter because it seems nearly impossible to sepa</page><page sequence="7">Review Review of Books / Journal for the Study of Judaism 43 (2012) 80-139 117 rate Jewish and Christian layers in this tradition. Orlov starts to identify Enochic and Adamic traditions in 2 Enoch in order to find the template in which Satan becomes the leader of the fallen Watchers; he follows this line up to the Hekha lot tradition where the motif of angelic veneration and opposition still plays an important role. However, too many problems remain untouched in this essay. Of course the story of the Watchers / Grigoroi in 2 Enoch is dependent on 1 En 1 -36; of course 2 Enoch uses Adamic traditions liberally. But how can we explain the Satanology of 2 Enoch without discussing 3 Baruch for example? And how can we understand the relation between Satanael and the Watchers without first analysing the incoherence of the disparate material used in 2 Enoch? Some items here are clearly Christian interpolations. In the footnotes of my translation (2 Enoch in JSHRZ 1996) I gave a lot of parallels, literature and arguments which would at least deserve discussion. Concerning the Watchers, it is obvious that their rebellion is definitely not connected with Adam (like in other traditions) but is of indepen dent origin. The pun with Satanail / Satan has a wealth of analogies in Christian literature, especially in Slavonic translation, and demands deeper investigation. "The Fallen Trees: Arboreal Metaphors and Polemics with the Divine Body Traditions in the Apocalypse of Abraham' is the closing essay which again ham mers out many of the hypotheses previously demonstrated. Starting with the idol Bar-Eshath's story, Orlov compares the significant accounts of biblical arboreal metaphors in Ezek 31 and Dan 4; than he moves on to Ezek 28:1 -19 to investigate the broader context of this pattern of demoting someone from a high to a low position. One of the results: Apocalypse of Abraham 6:10-17, often evaluated as an secondary addition, fits very well into the theological structure of the book. The volume has established the author's articles very well on the scholarly market—under the sharpened guideline of two "paradigms" which mirrors one of his main interests. Now these must become really part of a critical debate. Some details have already been overtaken by further progress, others demand a better rationale and foundation. Many fine observations are still waiting for full appreci ation. The field of Slavonic Pseudepigrapha perhaps does not need the omnipres ence of one approach but surely it needs more stimulating studies like these.
