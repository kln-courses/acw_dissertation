<plain_text><page sequence="1">Robbe-Grillet, L'Immortelle, and the No vel: Reality, Nothingness, and Imagination Ben Stoltzfus /Λ 'IMMORTELLE,1 Alain Robbe-Grillet's second "ciné-roman," incorporates most of the themes and purposes of his novels as well as of his critical writings. While the film itself was panned it is such an interesting achievement that it deserves special critical scrutiny. Not only is it a summary of Robbe-Grillet's art up to 1963, it also announces some special new trends which he and other "new novelists" will subsequently incorporate into their fiction. A professor, Ν., a stranger in a foreign city (Istanbul), is looking for a woman whose name is perhaps Leila (soul-mate in Arabic) and whose address he does not know. N. is not only baffled by the language, customs, and enigmatic manner of the people he meets and comes in contact with, he is also overcome by the very presence of the city which, with its narrow streets, back alleys, mosques (one of which is a marine museum), false boats, false chains, and antiques which are not antiques, succeeds in alienating him from a "normal" sense of reality. The city is a "décor à trompe l'œil." People not only seem to be lying to him or to be keeping information from him (Leila, his landlady, Leila's mysterious friend, the storekeeper, the police), the very things and objects he encounters and touches (the postcards of the interior of the mosque in which Leila appears) have a way of deceiving him and of hiding their essence. Moreover, N. is in love with Leila who dies in a car crash but whose presence (dead or alive) animates his and the spectator's one and a half hour search for her as well as for the "im mortality" she represents. Ν., therefore, is enmeshed in a labyrinth of people, things, and events which will gradually lead him to imagine (?) his own death. But have we not seen these labyrinths before and do they not correspond Published as a "ciné-roman" (script-novel) by Les Editions de Minuit, Paris, 1963. The translations from this edition are my own. Vol. VII, No. 2 123</page><page sequence="2">L'Esprit Créateur to the visual and emotional labyrinths of all of Robbe-Grillet's heroes? In Les Gommes (The Erasers), an Oedipus complex is one of the themes the detective Wallas is pursuing through the labyrinthine streets of a northern European city. The circular island in Le Voyeur becomes the labyrinth which will trap Mathias in his psychosexual infantilism and which will lead him to murder the thirteen-year-old Jacqueline. Robbe-Grillet's third novel is a visual correlative of an emotional maze called Jealousy and the husband who is insanely jealous of his wife is looking at the outside world through the same window blinds (jalousies) which are part of the décor in L'Immortelle. The very title, Dans le labyrinthe (In the Labyrinth), becomes the central theme of his fourth novel in which a tired, fever-wracked soldier dies while trying to deliver a package (something like a shoe-box wrapped in brown paper) to a man whose name he has forgotten at a time and place he cannot re member. In Marienbad "it seemed at first impossible to lose oneself in [the park]... along the rectangular paths, between the inanimate ges tures of statues and the granite slabs." 2 Wallas involuntarily shoots his father. Mathias kills a young girl. A nameless husband is deliriously jealous. A young woman's grasp of "reality" crumbles (like the park balustrade) and she actually comes to believe in an unreal encounter "last year." A soldier dies because he is lost and a stranger in a city which is perhaps Reichenfels while, in L'Immortelle, the professor dies — or ends up by imagining his death — in his search for the woman of his dreams. Robbe-Grillet's most obvious labyrinthine precursors (aside from the symbolism of the Theseus myth which he rejects) are Joyce and Kafka. Leopold Bloom spends endless hours walking through Dublin, while the land surveyor is hopelessly enmeshed in all kinds of real and unreal mazes as he tries to reach The Castle. The labyrinth, by its very nature, leads the people caught in it to a sense of strangeness and alienation. It is not surprising, therefore, that, in addition to Ulysses, The Castle, and The Trial, The Sun Also Rises and L'Etranger (The Stranger) should have influenced Robbe-Grillet's works and that he should have borrowed Hemingway's and Camus' "objective technique" for rendering a character's "outsideness." There is a straight line pro gression from Hemingway's factual, non-analytic descriptions to Robbe 2.

But Jake Barne's existential solitude, like Meursault's, and K.'s is typical also of Robbe-Grillet's characters. They seldom speak or com municate with anyone. In The Trial, K.\ arrest, for reasons he cannot explain, and which he does not understand, is but one step removed from the lack of insight Robbe-Grillet's heroes display in connection with their own behavior. In L Immortelle the prolessor s quest tor the woman or his dreams takes place within the walled labyrinth of Istanbul. The reality we are about to see on the screen is his but it is a reality tainted by the slats of the jalousies or by the shadow of these jalousies on the wall above his couch. The inference here is that N. is jealous of everything (the people, the city, events) which has taken Leila away from him. But he is also afraid because all the shutters of his room are closed (it has literal ly become "la chambre secrète"), he does not go out, and he imagines the pursuit of the man with the dogs. In fact, everything we are about to see has already taken place but we are seeing it in the present ("the movies have only one grammatical mode: the present indicative") 3 — because N. is reconstructing, reliving, and imagining the experience. The climax of his fear is the sequence of his imaginary (?) death which du plicates the details of Leila's car accident. The title is at first enigmatic because the heroine dies. But the resur rection of her image, as N. tries to remember or reconstruct or imagine or recreate or relive his experience, is what we are seeing on the screen. Nor can we deny the reality of her presence since we are seeing her alive, in the present, even though the movie begins (and ends) with a close-up of her dead face. But the professor's imaginary death is also in a sense "real" and, by eliminating him, Robbe-Grillet leaves us with the same enigma the film began with. Why did he (or she) die? The answers to these questions are perhaps irrelevant because Robbe-Grillet does not seem to be interested in presenting any kind of "solution." His purpose in creating the film lies in the interplay of real, imagi native, and hypothetical possibilities. We the spectators see these "reali ties" on the screen in a triple inter-action between author, hero, and 3. Alain Robbe-Grillet, Pour un nouveau roman (Paris, Les Editions de Minuit, 1963), p. 130. This and subsequent translations are my own. Vol. VII, No. 2 125</page><page sequence="4">L'Esprit Créateur viewer. The title itself refers to the creative imagination of all three. L'Immortelle ("l'imagination créatrice" in the feminine), Leila (the muse and the soul-mate), is the visible incarnation of art, reality, and dream: "Look," she says, "there is a mosque like the one seen in your dreams" (L'Immortelle, p. 49). The movie ends with a shot of Leila dressed in black standing on the prow of a Bosphorus ferryboat. Behind her are outlined the domes and the minarets of Istanbul's mosques — obvious symbols. The sound effects of the siren, the hammering of workmen restoring the Byzantine towers, Leila's laugh, and the nostalgic Turkish song, will, in addition to the image, summarize the dream-like quality of the film. In one of many dramatic shots of Leila, the professor-spectator sees her chained to the Byzantine walls. This imagination, a term Robbe Grillet uses to describe a character's memory or fantasy, is too incon gruous to be memory and so has to be interpreted as N.'s imaginative fantasy. But such imaginations, all too frequently, constitute Robbe-Gril let's concealed statement about the creative process: "Everything concurs to suggest that the false — that is, the possible, the impossible, the hypothesis, the dream, etc. — has become one of the privileged themes of modern fiction; a new kind of narrator has been born: it is not only a man who describes the things he sees but, at the same time, someone who invents the things around him and who sees the things he invents" (Pour un nouveau roman, p. 140). But this kind of invention also applies to the artist himself whose role it is in the first place to create a particular work. Hence the doctor narrator in Dans le labyrinthe who, as Robbe-Grillet must have, imagines different hypotheses to explain the soldier's death. The professor in L'Immortelle also imagines different hypotheses to explain the car ac cident and Leila's death. But it is obvious that these alternatives are also the author's and become, ultimately, the reader's and the spectator's, a triple co-operation. The moment we realize that the image of Leila, chained to the walls or standing in front of a moslem tombstone — with its sex-and-death symbolism — is not only N.'s interpretation of a par ticular reality, but also ours, we begin to understand the intention of the film. All the sequences, though apparently disconnected and disconti nuous, are intricately linked and are activated by the inner necessity of the professor's jealousy, fear, alienation, and obsessions. 126 Summer 1967</page><page sequence="5">Stoltzfus L'Immortelle begins and ends with shots of the crumbling walls. These walls are not only the circumference of the city labyrinth, they are also the objective correlative of the hero's crumbling grasp on reality. But this visual imagery of the mind's state of being, while typical of the cinematography of Resnais, Antonioni, and others, is also a part of Robbe-Grillet's novelistic technique. It corresponds to what he calls the perfect blend of form and content. The descriptions of a soldier wander ing lost in a strange city constitute the form of Dans le labyrinthe. What these descriptions stand for will become the novel's content. We can pa raphrase this content briefly by saying that if the labyrinth, as the control ling metaphor of the novel, stands for the human condition and the fever wracked soldier represents a "stranger" or an "outsider," then the only way out of the labyrinth — both Dans le labyrinthe and L'Immortel le suggest it — is by means of the creative imagination; not necessarily the hero's (since he fails) but the author's and subsequently ours : "crea tion ... will always have to be begun anew, by us and then by those who come after us. Only then will the invention of the world assume all of its meaning — a permanent invention which, it is oft repeated, belongs to the artists but, also, to all men. In dreams, in memory, as well as in sight, our imagination is the organizing surface of our life, of our world. Every man, in turn, must reinvent the things around him" (Pour un nouveau roman, p. 94). While the present is every spectator's inexorable condition, the hero's imaginations are deprived of time: "contemporary research. .. seems to reveal, more frequently than not, mental structures deprived of 'time' " (Pour un nouveau roman, p. 130). This explains, in part, the dislocation of time in Robbe-Grillet's novels and films. The professor, in his attempt to reconstruct reality, will remember or imagine sequences which always violate chronology simply because the chronological se quence is irrelevant to his needs. Ν. may visualize men carrying a coffin. This "picture," when pa raphrased, means that he is painfully aware of Leila's death. The next "picture" shows Leila (alive) barefoot on a desolate sandy beach with the surf rolling in and splashing at her feet. If we juxtapose the two pictures N. is seeing in his mind's eye we get: Leila, dead for eternity. We are not told that N. is sad but it is easy now to infer that he is suf fering. In other words, we are seeing a pictorial equivalent of sorrow. The whole movie is made up of a series of pictorial equivalents for Vol. VII, No. 2 127</page><page sequence="6">L'Esprit Créateur different emotional states of being, ranging from fear and helplessness to eroticism. Pictures of a beautiful palace stand for Leila who is also a beautiful structure. A picture of a gutted palace means that she has been destroyed. A picture of her standing behind the grill of a cemetery represents her inaccessibility, particularly when followed immediately by a long distance (telescopic lens) shot of her walking along the beach. She now appears to be walking without ever getting any nearer. Then we get another long distance shot in front of the mosque of N.'s dreams. After that another car crash and the shattering of those dreams. This then is the new grammar of the film and it is the quality of these pictures which explains why the actors are stiff or seem to be acting poorly. Everything is imaginary and therefore unreal — even their actions. The pictures are flat, like bad postcards, and they are bad actors because this is how N. is seeing them. Moreover, it is the absolute freedom with which Robbe-Grillet ma nipulates these pictures in time-space that apparently makes his work hard to understand. Nor can we understand it unless we think of it in terms of an art which creates itself, that is, an art which is also a reflect ion on the creative process: "The true, the false, and the make believe have become, more or less, the subject matter of every modern work which, instead of claiming to be a fragment of reality, evolves as a reflexion on reality (or what little reality there is, which ever you wish)" (.Pour un nouveau roman, p. 129). Leila will comment on this lack of reality by saying: "You can see for yourself that it is not a real city... It is an operetta décor for a love story" (L'Immortelle, p. 75). The sequences of the film itself correspond to the reality or lack of reality of the creative process and, characteristically, L'Immortelle is punctuated by the images and sounds of workmen with hammers chisel ling stones and rocks for the restoration of some of the Byzantine towers. Leila: "You can see for yourself that everything is false... Byzantium !... it is still being built ! Ν.: Rather, it is being restored. Leila: Call it what you will, that doesn't change a thing" (L'Immortelle, p. 97). If we superimpose this little bit of dialogue — the image of Leila (a pri soner) chained to these very same walls and Robbe-Grillet's statements about what the new novel and the new films are trying to do — we arrive at the conclusion that the pictorial elements of L'Immortelle (that is, its 128 Summer 1967</page><page sequence="7">Stoltzfus form) are also its content. The objective rendering of things and images will now correspond to the subjective point of view of the main character. But Istanbul is also a real city and the palaces, mosques, and streets have an objective reality apart from the professor's. While Ν. is reconstructing his "reality" Robbe-Grillet interpolates another "reality" which contradicts it. We therefore have shots of walls which are crumbling and shots of walls which have been restored. The professor's reality is crumbling while at the same time the artist's (and the spectator's) reality is being constructed. I have chosen the walls as an example because it is the most obvious. The film, however, is full of such apparent contradictions which are not contradictions. The mosque which is a marine museum is also, of course, a mosque-museum. There are cemeteries no longer in use and in which the tombstones are leaning at every conceivable angle and there are newer cemeteries in which the tombstones are vertical. The policemen who seem to be in conspiracy with the underworld, and whose faces appear to be those of criminals, are, nevertheless, still also the police. Leila (perhaps Lâle), who may be a prostitute, is still loved by the professor. Robbe-Grillet has again, as he did in his first novel Les Gommes, used the theme of a multifaceted and contradictory reality. But much more effectively this time (if it is possible to compare a novel and a film) and in such a way as to stress not only the alternating and deceptive nature of reality but also the tearing down as well as the building up of the creative process: "the most beautiful of contemporary works leave us empty, troubled. Not only do they not pretend to contain any other reality except the reading itself, or the spectacle but, even more, they seem to be forever questioning themselves, even while in the process of constructing themselves. At one point space destroys time and time sa botages space. The description remains active but stationary, contradicts itself, goes around in circles. The moment negates continuity" (Pour un nouveau roman, p. 133). Thus we have the image of a restored tower contradicting the image of a crumbling tower; of a living Leila contradicting a dead Leila; of a disintegrating reality (the professor's) contradicting a reality being cons tructed (the author's and the spectator's) and so, finally, we are left with the concept of a work which is being destroyed as it constructs itself. Leila says "There is a ship like in your dreams... A ship which is not seaworthy... You must now begin anew and start everything all over Vol. VII, No. 2 129</page><page sequence="8">L'Esprit Créateur again..." (L'Immortelle, p. 165). Hence the malaise, even anger, expe rienced by readers and spectators and the vehemence with which L'Im mortelle was panned. At the end, the movie abolishes itself; Leila, who was resurrected, dies, and the professor who resurrected her and who was the author's creation dies also. The professor's dream and the author's creation are both destroyed and so the spectator is left alone, perhaps baffled, to come to terms with a filmed "reality" he must expe rience and reconstruct in order to understand. And a work of art which constructs itself and then questions its very right to exist, abolishes itself and leaves nothing but the void of the past experience. At the end of L'Immortelle Leila says: "The ramparts of Byzan tium... You will have to reconstruct them again... From the Sea of Marmara to the Golden Horn, you are following, as far as the eye can see, the succession of ruined towers... You are a stranger... You have arrived in a Turkey of dreams... False prisons, false ramparts, false stories... You can no longer go back..." (p. 206). Moreover, the reading of an anti-novel or the seeing of a new wave" film is not always an easy matter because the grammar of the new art form is still being developed. For example, Nathalie Sarraute's book Les Fruits d'or (The Golden Fruits) is an example of the self-conscious extreme to which modern art has evolved. It is about a fictitious novel also called Les Fruits d'or. The book we are reading is made up of favorable and unfavorable reactions of a multitude of people talking about the imaginary Fruits d'or. The two books should be the same, since they have the same title, but they are not. The novel we are read ing has no substance except the elusive conversations of people about the other unreal book. The more they talk about a book which cannot possibly exist, the stronger our conviction that the book we are reading has no other substance than itself (Flaubert's desire to create a work of art out of nothing). But since there is no substance, the reader is left with a void. The book has eliminated itself in the reading. Such an achievement is indeed a tour de force and we may wonder if it is worth the trouble. Nevertheless this tendency is one of the stron gest preoccupations of the new novelists. They are destroying the tradi tional nineteenth-century novel with its plot, story line, well-developed characters and, for verisimilitude, have substituted process. Michel Bu tor's La Modification, though superficially it may seem to describe a husband who is going to leave his wife in Paris for his mistress in Rome 130 Summer 1967</page><page sequence="9">Stoltzfus is, not about the husband, but an analysis of "the change of heart" which prompts a return to his wife. The novel is an exploration of this "change of heart." Such writing about process, this Emploi du temps as Butor calls it in his novel of the same name, is the murder of Bleston, the symbolic killing of the traditional novel form with its well-defined plot and characters and its linear chronological development in time space. Fellini's movie, 8 and 1/2, like Les Fruits d'or uses, as subject mat ter, the search for something to say. It appears that, not only all values are suspect, but everything else as well, even the creative process. But particularly suspect, says Sarraute in L'Ere du soupçon, is the artist who attempts to recreate reality. And so, the only substance left for the mo dern novelist is to write about his art and at the same time to sabotage the conventional novel with what Sartre first called the anti-novel. This is precisely what Butor, Robbe-Grillet, and Sarraute are doing (not to mention Beckett, Pinget, Oilier, Ricardou, Simon, Nabokov). "When the description ends we realize that it has left nothing standing behind it: it has accomplished itself in a double movement of creation and ef facement which we find, moreover, at every level of the book and, particularly, in its overall structure — hence the inherent deception in the works of todav" (Pour un nouveau roman, t&gt;. 127). The meaning of Robbe-GriHet's books, and particularly his first, Les Gommes, is now much clearer. All the contradictions of the novel: the detective who is a murderer; Wallas who has a double, named V. S.; the murder which is not a murder and which, although it apparently occurred at the beginning, occurs at the end; all the minute contradictions of reality — a reality which is at first constructed, and then destroyed — are abolished by the creative process which effaces one possibility after another. We can now understand the repetitions of scenes with their minute variations and the obsessive nature of certain images. They serve a dou ble purpose, as usual. In L'Immortelle the erotic tombstones, the piece of paper on which Leila did not write her address, the chain which is an ornament but also a bond, the postcards, the mosques, the blind alleys, houses, doors, and staircases are all part of the labyrinth in which the professor is lost. They are his particular décor and the repetition of se quences or actions or images represents his desire to understand or relive what has, or is, or will happen. But all these hypothetical possibi Vol. VII, No. 2 131</page><page sequence="10">L'Esprit Créateur lities are also the artist's alternate choices, since whatever reality exists is in the process of constructing itself. That is, since the work of art is, for the moment, the only admissible reality, any choice is possible. It is purely a question of finding the most suitable "picture sequence" to fit the narrator's (that is, the hero's) inner necessity. In Marienbad, X imagines the shooting of A and then instantly says that he needs her alive. Nor is he interested in "rape" since he rejects the scene of violent possession and substitutes, instead, the imaginary and many times re peated sequence of a smiling A embracing him. Marienbad is the story of a persuasion, as Robbe-Grillet says it is: persuading A that they did meet "last year." But last year is really "this year" and, since she consents to leave with him, the persuasion has been effective. In Dans le labyrinthe the doctor-narrator is also imagining alternate possibilities to explain and show the dead soldier's behavior. The streets, false doors, stairways alternately light and dark with the flashing of the "minuterie" represent not only the soldier's agonized search but also the artist's — the imaginary labyrinth of the creative process. What we, as readers, thought was the soldier's narrative turns out to be the doctor's fictitious recreation of a non-existent reality which, ultimately, becomes the author's reflection on the creative process. But if we, as readers, ever get through the maze, we have to reconstruct it, and in so doing we relive or recreate the experience which, in the final analysis becomes our experience. Once again the novel has been abolished and the reader has to substitute himself, but he will come to the conclusion that every experience is a new experience and will, every time, require a new solution. The metaphysical implication of such an artistic position is inescapable: there is no a priori morality to guide our choices. But while every choice is theoretically possible, some are better than others. Bad choices, according to Robbe-Grillet, are those which lead man towards "tragic complicity," man's tendency to humanize objects which are simply "there" and which have no particular significance. Such anthro pomorphism leads all of Robbe-Grillet's characters to murder, violence, and mental imbalance. Thus Ν. will anthropomorphise the beach, the mosques, and the palaces. Everything he sees is now "contaminated" by his fear, his perplexity, his love for Leila, and the image of her death. Istanbul be comes a place of objects which have trapped him and which continue to influence his thoughts and his reactions. But on the creative level, bad 132 Summer 1967</page><page sequence="11">Stoltzfus choices, that is, anthropomorphic ones, the ones dictated by the com plicity of passion, may be good choices provided they effectively communicate a character's state of mind. 4 ι ne novel or mm wnicn creates itseii is not necessarily interested m verisimilitude. Critics of Marienbad and L'Immortelle were upset because people do not walk and talk in the unreal and stiff manner presented. But memory and fantasy are capable of recreating unreality in any form. This explains the surreality and stiffness of many shots in both movies. The problem is to make the spectator believe in the work. L'lm mortelle'% weaknesses are explainable in these terms. Robbe-Grillet has not convinced us of the reality (or unreality) of certain sequences, which explains, perhaps, why the movie had a very short run when it came out in Paris in the Spring of 1963. Two factors account for its lack of suc cess, compared to the phenomenal impact of Last Year at Marienbad. First, more controversial ink, it seems, was spilled over Marienbad than any other film on record, which accounts, in part, for its unusual box office appeal, whereas L'Immortelle, though it should have been equally controversial, received uniformly bad reviews. Second, L'Immortelle lacks the masterful cinematography of Alain Resnais' direction. On the other hand, the techniques of the two films are very much the same: the dislocation of time, the imposition of the present tense, the blurring of chronology (as well as of day-dream, imagination, and reality), the presence of the offstage voice suggesting the imagery sequence (as well as the negation of this sequence), and finally, the imposition of all these factors on the spectator. Robbe-Grillet's purpose in both films was to force the viewer's imagination into a subjective identification and inter pretation of the film: "the only important 'character' is the spectator: the entire story unfolds in his head and it is he who imagines it" (Pour un nouveau roman, p. 132). It is unfortunate that L'Immortelle"s defects should detract (as they do) from the film's significance, because it is a fascinating summary of Robbe-Grillet's art to date as well as an exploration of the esthetic preoccupations of the "new wave" and the "new novel." In Marienbad Resnais toned down some of A's more hysterical se quences, which Robbe-Grillet wanted incorporated. But in directing L'Immortelle himself Robbe-Grillet, by including the sequences he 4.

Vol. VII, No. 2 133</page><page sequence="12">L'Esprit Créateur wanted, has overplayed certain scenes. For instance, he has overdone the mixing of visual and auditory effects at moments of climax, in order to stress and exaggerate the impact of these factors on the hero's mind. But since Robbe-Grillet insists that the real hero is the spectator, who is not necessarily a confused and alienated (in the sense of mentally disturbed) participant in a drama he does not understand, the melodra ma of the woman's scream, of the squeal of tires, of the dog's bark, of the crash of the white Buick against a tree (all of these visual and auditory), instead of making the spectator shudder, merely makes him smile. Such moments of crisis and imaginary climax should have been underplayed. Another difficulty, related to this one, is the use of the two dogs and the man with the dark glasses to suggest, presumably, an aura of destiny, mystery, and violence beyond the ambiguity of realistic detail. In doing so, Robbe-Grillet has, unfortunately, exaggerated certain ro mantic inclinations of his which, even in "La Chambre secrète," the last short story of the collection entitled Instantanés (Snapshots), he was able to keep under control. In fact, L'Immortelle is a full-length version of the possibilities already inherent in the animation of this "picture," the secret room which is the artist's imagination — the inner eye of his creative dimension. But the effect, in L'Immortelle, is heavy-handed, and the dogs, which are not vicious, instead of communicating the desired contradic tion between reality and imagined reality, remain anachronistic and peripheral. Even their growling is irrelevant and so becomes an un necessary intrusion. This is perhaps the only part of the film in which the professor's point of view and the spectator's point of view have not been integrated. I am not objecting to Robbe-Grillet's intent, which is fascinating. I am objecting to the realization of that intent. If he is ap pealing to the imagination of a universal spectator (as he indeed has to, if his avowed purpose is to be taken seriously), then the role of the mysterious man with the dogs fails to communicate the desired result because the spectator is not "convinced." On the other hand, Leila, as the obsessional image of the professor's "day-dream" or as the muse of the author's creativity, continues to live her immortal existence in the mind's eye of viewers who continue to imagine the film.
