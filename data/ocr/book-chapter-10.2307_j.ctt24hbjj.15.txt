<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 11. The Torments of Initiation and the  Question of Resistance1 Thomas A. Gregor We are told that in certain happy regions of the earth, where nature  provides in abundance everything that man desires, there are races  whose life is passed in tranquillity and who know neither compulsion  nor aggressiveness. I can scarcely believe it, and should be happy to  meet these fortunate beings.  — Sigmund Freud, Letter to Albert Einstein, ‘Why War?’ The Problem In 1982 Donald Tuzin published a short but trenchant article titled, ‘Ritual  Violence Among the Arapesh: The Dynamics of Moral and Religious Uncertainty’.  The work probes a question of broad human significance. The Ilahita Arapesh, in  the course of their long initiatory cycles, terrorised their children and subjected  them to excruciating ordeals. Tuzin self-consciously ascribes the word ‘brutal’  to these acts, partly because many of the Ilahita themselves so saw them, but  also because we, if we are honest with ourselves, do so as well. Ilahita ritual  (which no longer takes place) was particularly disturbing in that it was at the  sacred core of the society.  Rituals of initiation, which encompass many discomforting practices, are the  centrepiece of religious life among many Melanesian societies. It is in the course  of initiation that young men learn the deepest secrets of the men’s cults, that  they come to possess its most sacred symbols, and that they learn the most  profound values of the society. When we consider that initiation can last many  years (in the case of Ilahita, it is a 50-year cycle), we only hyperbolise slightly  when we say that ritual, in many Melanesian societies, is initiation. What does  it mean when such ritual encompasses the cruelties that Tuzin and others have  documented? How, Tuzin asks, can such ‘good people do bad things to one  another?’ (1982:323). Consider, as an example, the Ilahita custom of laf, or ritual  killing. During one of the stages of initiation, wearers of certain ritual masks  who are possessed by the spirit of the men’s cult, may kill people with impunity:  1 This material was based partly upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No.  0650859. The article has also benefited from the comments of Warren Shapiro. 241 </page> <page sequence="2"> Echoes of the Tambaran  ‘nothing can vacate a hamlet so quickly as one of these spooks materializing out  of the gloom of the surrounding jungle.’ The ‘heaviness’ of the mask transforms  its wearer into a compulsive killer: ‘his own child or brother would not be  spared if he came upon them’ (Tuzin 1980:50). Are we dealing with social pathology, and, if so, how can a relativistic discipline  such as ours, especially one that, as Tuzin put it, ‘make[s] no provision for affect’  (1982:320), even begin to describe it? Ritual violence is not wholly strange to us in that religious violence is familiar  territory. It is responsible for the deaths of millions, and it confronts us in each  day’s news. But religious violence is invariably, in terms of its ideology, defensive  in nature. Hence those who die in its service are martyrs to the cause, destined  to a place in heaven, as in the case of jihad in radical Islam or the crusaders  during the eleventh century. Seen from the point of view of the perpetrator,  such violence defends the religion against its external enemies.  Religious violence might also turn inward, as in the persecution of heretics.  There are abundant historical examples in Western Christianity, culminating in  the Inquisition. But here, too, looked at from the perspective of the inquisitors,  we find the religion defending itself, albeit by turning upon the enemy within.  Ritual violence, unlike religious violence, neither guards the periphery of  religion nor assures the purity of its core. Our only experience with it, as Tuzin  points out, is in highly sublimated versions such as those associated with the  Eucharist. Violence directed against the self—as in self-mortification described  in Catholic liturgy—comes closer, but it too, while discomforting, is largely  alien territory.  Tuzin suggests that, as anthropologists, we practice our own sublimations,  in that ritual violence becomes an unexamined part of the background of  ethnographic accounts. To be sure, the ethnography is plain enough, but the  moral and emotional implications of the violence are often rendered nearly  invisible by theoretical frameworks that anaesthetise us from feeling (Tuzin  1982:322). ‘One problem entailed in studying the literature of an ethnographic  area such as New Guinea’, he writes,  is that the reader risks being desensitized—losing his cultural distance  and with it his ‘fresh eye’. Penile incision is reported often in the New  Guinea ethnography. The resulting contempt-bred-of-familiarity takes  the form of coming to view this practice as ‘just another’ customary  observance equivalent in most analytic respects to members of the  culture brushing their teeth with coconut husks or marrying their  cross-cousins. (Tuzin 1980:67)  242 </page> <page sequence="3"> 11 . The Torments of Initiation and the Question of Resistance There are exceptions among ethnographers—notably Tuzin himself, but also  Read (1954, 1965) and especially Gilbert Herdt, who writes of his own ‘shock,  fear, anger and sorrow in the rituals’ (Herdt 1981a:7). More normally, such  reactions stay well separate from the accounts. Although Tuzin does not state  it, this is useful in that it permits description free from extraneous judgment.  But it comes at a cost in that it numbs us to the reactions of those we study. Are  they so different from us that they do not perceive the violence they perpetrate  as cruel? And if so, why do the tormented eventually turn upon their children  and pass the suffering to the next generation?  My intention is to examine these questions from the perspective of research in  Melanesia, which offers many relevant examples. The reader is warned that my  focus is primarily on a few societies where the data are rich, and the level of  ritual pain is extreme. The question I will address is that of resistance. Is there  evidence that those who perpetuate the torments of initiation question what  they are doing? Do they feel remorse for what they have done or shame for its  effects? The puzzle of ritual violence and the possibility of resistance reflect on  our capacity to love and empathise, on broad issues of ethical relativism and on  the universality of human values. The Background of Ritual Violence:   Male initiation in Melanesia Male initiation is about making men out of boys. Ritual violence, therefore, occurs  in a larger sexualised context. Roger Keesing (1982:6–13) and Gregor and Tuzin  (2001) summarise the characteristics of male initiation rituals, many of which  can be reasonably extended to cultures beyond Melanesia. The most salient fact  is that in ritually violent cultures males and females are different kinds of beings  in their physiology, their bodily fluids and their essences (Keesing 1982:7).  These contrasts radiate outwards so that the mythology, folk medicine and  expressive culture are themselves, in Shirley Lindenbaum’s (1987:222) useful  phrase, ‘gender inflected’, so that ‘the polarities of male and female articulate  cosmic forces thought to be located in the human body’. Outside Melanesia, the  pattern is less marked but still vivid. The most cosmic example of which I am  aware is in Amazonia, where the Tukuna regard the phallic sun god as being in  permanent copulation with the womb-like under layer of the cosmos, which is  constantly being fertilised by his semen in the form of the sun’s rays.  The primary symbolic currency of the initiatory symbolism is formed by sexual  body parts and fluids. They appear not as rooted in different sexual natures but  as permutations, one of the other. Penises, clitorises, vaginas, anuses, breasts,  mouths, noses and tongues condense, merge and differentiate. Among the  243 </page> <page sequence="4"> Echoes of the Tambaran  Sambia, semen is equated with breast milk: ‘the milk of women is the same as  milk of men’ (Herdt 1981a:186–7). The penis, as the source of milk, is referred  to as the ‘glans-breast’.  The initiatory systems we will examine are ‘pseudo-procreative’ (Hiatt 1971) in  that men coopt women’s capacity to gestate and give birth to new life. Growth  and manhood are achieved through giving birth to initiates, through injecting  them with life substance, especially through the oral ingestion of semen. The  concept of pseudo-procreativity is literalised most vividly in the practice of  subincision among the Australian Arunta (Arrernte), wherein the initiators  drip ‘postpartum’ blood from their newly opened subincision scars, which are  called vaginas, and the blood is identified as postpartum blood (Hiatt 1971).  Among the Iatmul, ‘male initiators are identified as “mothers” of the novices’  and the doorway to the initiatory structure is literally the ‘clitoris gate’ (Bateson  1958:282). A similar pattern is repeated among the Wogeo in the form of male  ‘menstruation’ and in many other Melanesian and Amazonian contexts, albeit  in slightly less intense and elaborate forms (see, for example, Gregor 1985). A  logical corollary is the disturbing possibility of male pregnancy, which is a fear  expressed by Sambia (Herdt 1981b:237) and the Awa (Newman and Boyd 1982).  There seem to be few limits to the ingeniousness of initiators in claiming the  generative capacity of women (see Bettelheim’s [1954] more general treatment).  These ideas are images of dreams, the stuff of primary process thought. As  relativising anthropologists, we rarely say it, but they are factually wrong, they  are based on ‘error’ (Keesing 1982), and they are, in fact, objectively ‘preposterous’  (Hays 1988). Nonetheless they have real consequences for initiates, for women  and for the moral systems they infuse. Thus, the men who utilise feminine  symbolism in the creation of initiates are not grateful. Women are dangerous.  They and their menstrual blood are contaminating. The overwhelming burden  of the ideology of the initiating cults is that women are inimical to masculinity  and, in Tuzin’s words, ‘the bane of a peaceful society’ (1980:106). The process of  initiation strips away all that is feminine from boys who have been too long in  association with their mothers, through rituals that purge female influence from  their skin, blood, intestinal tracts, words and thoughts.  In a few cultures, the opposition and uneasy relationship of men and women  spill over from initiation to appear in other areas of social life, with women  often being the victim of male aggression. Among the Nama, as described by  Read (1954:22–3), ‘women suspected of adultery have sticks thrust into their  vaginas...fights are staged at marriages, when, characteristically enough, a  man is required to shoot an arrow into the thigh of his future wife’. Sexual  violence itself is encompassed in an atmosphere where aggression is a norm.  Again following Read (1954:33), ‘punishment for wrongdoing characteristically  includes public beatings and vicious humiliations...self-injury and mutilation  244 </page> <page sequence="5"> 11 . The Torments of Initiation and the Question of Resistance are customary ways of expressing sorrow and loss...dominance and submission,  rivalry and coercion are constantly recurring themes, manifest alike in day-to- day contexts and in ceremon[y].’ The Torments of Initiation The ideology of masculinity and sexual opposition sets the stage for ritual  violence within the cycle of initiation. Boys are not simply roughly treated.  Rather they are systematically terrorised. Let us look at the process from the  perspective of the novices. Lack of Preparation or Explanation  Initiates are often unprepared for what will happen to them. Cruel treatment,  once explained, becomes bearable, and initiation has a high purpose of making  men from boys. But, as I read the literature, the explanation often comes after  the torment. Hence among the Awa, ‘the sequence of male initiation begins  when these boys are forcefully taken to the men’s house...The boys are surprised  by this abduction’ (Newman and Boyd 1982:247). Adult men, recalling the  experience, describe themselves as unprepared: ‘they cried and shook when  taken away to the men’s ground’ (Newman and Boyd 1982). Further along in  the process of initiation, the boys have learned to expect abuse, so much so  that anticipation itself becomes anguish. Recalling such a moment, one of the  men says: ‘There was something else besides washing. We heard that, and we  all started to shake’ (Newman and Boyd 1982:253). Similarly, Tuzin (1980:94)  describes the novices as ‘wondering what will happen’ just prior to being forced  to run a gauntlet in which they are rubbed with nettles and clubbed, some  knocked unconscious.  On the occasion when children are prepared for the ritual, the story might be  even more terrifying than the reality. Sambia boys are told ‘the spirit wants to  get you, she wants to kill and eat you!’ (Herdt 1981a:110). Among the Ilahita,  prior to having their penises lacerated, the boys are told that the Tambaran  spirit will force them to ‘slide down the spiked trunk of a falanga sago palm, and  thus rip open their bellies’ (Tuzin 1982:338). From a child’s perspective, these  stories are genuinely terrifying. The events associated with them must seem  unpredictable, catastrophic and lethal. 245 </page> <page sequence="6"> Echoes of the Tambaran  Separation from Mothers  We must keep in mind that the initiates are boys as young as six or seven, who  will be separated from their mothers in seclusion camps or villages for periods  of months or years. The tears of mothers as their sons are led away to initiation  are thoroughly justified. Among the Sambia, after the boys learn (for the first  time) that they must have oral sex with the bachelors to consume semen, they  are marched in front of their mothers as novice warriors. This is the last time  they will see their mothers and sisters for more than 10 years. Herdt explains  that a boy loses his mother totally. Physical contact, commensality and even  direct gaze are forbidden. Having learned the secrets of the cult, he is forbidden  this warmth ‘for fear he might reveal these secrets’ (Herdt 1981a:112). In other  cultural settings as well, the long process of initiation and the barriers between  men and women seem sufficient for sons to ‘forget’ their mothers. When their  mothers might see them again, they will have been forever changed. The Novices Are Guilty  The first explanation the novices might receive for their torment is that it is their  own fault: initiation is punishment for real and imagined misdeeds. Among the  Sambia, Herdt notes that this is a formal part of the justification for the ritual:  ‘first-stage nose bleeding is a punishment for insolence’, and the more defiant  the child is to the initiators, the more he is tormented. The sense of retaliation  is explicit, in that, in the words of a Sambia initiator, ‘for those acts we now  pay you back’ (Herdt 1982:225). Among the Awa, the men harangue the boys  for their purported misconduct and blame them for the deaths of warriors who  were killed when they were too young to have participated in their defence. The  men’s anger at the boys is genuine: ‘So great is [the patriclansmen’s] hostility  towards the boys that they are not allowed to be directly involved in the  purging ritual lest they handle a nose bleeder, vomiting cane or bamboo blade  in such a manner as to cause serious injury on their relatives’ (Newman and  Boyd 1982:283). Ilahita Arapesh initiators are equally furious at their charges,  explaining to them that they are guilty and will be punished.  Terrorisation: Staging Beyond separation is psychological terror, which is deliberately inflicted on the  initiates. Among the most violent of the initiators, the Marind Anim ordeals  included ‘submitting them to an ostensible headhunt attack so realistic that most  of them fainted’ (Knauft 1993:150). Terror is enhanced by deliberate staging  designed to produce fear, including frightening masks, strange sounds and  seclusion enclosures with moveable walls. Herdt writes that among the Sambia  246 </page> <page sequence="7"> 11 . The Torments of Initiation and the Question of Resistance the boys are tied on the backs of their sponsors so that escape is impossible.  They then ‘confront a massive vibrating wall of thick green foliage’. There is a  bedlam of ‘eerie sputtering sounds’, shaking walls, and what seems to be blood  dripping from the vegetation (Herdt 1981a:141). The boys are terrified and cry  out for their mothers. Tuzin writes of the Arapesh:  What cannot be conveyed in a short space is the full emotional force  of this violence: it is one thing to be thumped in the head or have  your penis lacerated, but when these attacks are staged in a dramatic  atmosphere of weird customary, unearthly sounds, and frenzied  stomping, screaming and singing by scores of armed warriors, each  of whom seems madly intent on your destruction, the experience is  transformed into nightmarish horror. (Tuzin 1982:337) What comes across in the literature is that the terror is not a by-product of  necessary procedures, which are, regretfully, frightening. Often terror itself is  the objective. Pain It is easy to inflict excruciating, unbearable pain. Pressure, heat and blows are  sufficient. A device as simple as a water board can make it unbearable. But  there is something quite different about ritual pain. It seems designed, often  ingeniously, to violate self-boundaries, to humiliate and to induce terror and  fear of death. Hence the torments focus on bodily orifices and boundaries— usually the neurally most sensitive and intimate tissues, including the nostrils  and nasal cavity, the mouth, throat and oesophagus, the genitals and, with  somewhat less frequency, the eyes and the anus. The overwhelming theme is  that of penetration and laceration, using sharpened canes, bamboo rods, tiny  stone arrows and similar devices. A full catalogue of techniques is the stuff  of nightmares. Alan Morinis, who has examined pain in initiatory rites, lists  ‘being beaten, starved, incised, scarified, pierced, tattooed, terrified, mutilated,  circumcised, infibulated, cicatrized, bound, and subject to removal of parts of... bodies, especially teeth and fingers’ (1985:151).  In Melanesia, it appears that initiators are more than commonly imaginative,  in that they add such techniques as cane swallowing, nose bleeding and being  rubbed with and forced to swallow nettles, and, at least among the Sambia,  being forced, in the dark, without preparation, to have oral sex with strange  adult men.  Of these ordeals, cane swallowing deserves special note. A photograph of Awa  cane swallowing subtitled ‘a man forces the vomiting cane down an initiate’s  throat’ can be found in Newman and Boyd’s (1982) article ‘The Making of Men’.  247 </page> <page sequence="8"> Echoes of the Tambaran  The canes penetrate more than a foot inside the throat and oesophagus, and they  are intended to produce defecation and vomiting. Herdt (1981b:224) quotes an  informant: ‘This is for removing food belonging to the mother’, which is the  sweet potato, hence the term for ‘cane swallowing’ translates as ‘sweet potato/ food; elimination’. Cane swallowing also is designed to induce defecation, which  eliminates not only maternal food but also maternal symbols: ‘Out with the  feces pass the depreciating “words” of the mother’ from which the boy must be  separated (Herdt 1981b). Closely associated with cane swallowing among the Sambia is nose bleeding  (the term translates as ‘cleansing and expulsion’), which is regarded as the most  painful act. It is performed upon the boys ‘without warning’ in an assault so  violent that it constitutes physical and psychical trauma (Herdt 1982). The  boys’ first experience with nose bleeding is horrific, and they cry out for their  mothers. Adults recalling the experience are ‘virtually unanimous in expressing  the feeling that they believed they were to be killed on the spot’ (Herdt 1982:225). In all of the groups I have reviewed, the physical attacks on the boys inevitably  turn to an assault on the genitals. One example is sufficient. Among the Ilahita  Arapesh, the men make a surgical instrument ‘by sharpening a piece of bamboo  to a razor’s edge’ (Tuzin: 1980:69), which, when decorated, is the incisor of  a ritual pig. The ‘pig’—one of the initiators—is a ‘balefully weird creature’,  his skin painted black. A mask covers the face. He lies in wait beneath the  floor of the initiation chamber until called by the boys’ sponsors. In the midst  of shouting and singing designed to terrify the initiates and drown out their  screams for their mothers, the pig suddenly appears ‘to bite them’. The pig  delivers ‘deep cutting strokes on their glans penis’ (Tuzin 1980:71). Younger  boys, who watch in horror, are also attacked. They are ‘held down while their  penes and scrota are vigorously rubbed with singing nettles’ (Tuzin 1982:338).  Then all of the boys are thrown in a pool previously filled with stinging nettles  (Tuzin 1982).  Beatings, cane swallowing, nose bleeding and assaults are often combined with  each other and with still more excruciating patterns of abuse. Hence Van Baal  reports that among the Marind Anim, initiates were the targets of anal rape  and that they ‘had their mouths, noses and eyes smeared with excrement that  had been mixed with semen...they were forced to lie in seclusion until maggots  appeared on their befouled faces’ (Knauft 1993:150). Death Several ethnographers note that initiation is extremely dangerous for the  boys, and some in fact die. Cane swallowing is known to be particularly risky  in that it can cause internal haemorrhaging. We do not know how frequently  248 </page> <page sequence="9"> 11 . The Torments of Initiation and the Question of Resistance boys actually die in the course of initiation, but it is not infrequent. Campbell  (1983:144) reprints a historical photo from Arnhem Land showing the corpses of  seven young initiates who died as a consequence of being ‘exposed to a broiling  sun and to a torment of stinging insects’. Explanations of the Torments of Initiation Ethnographers’ explanations often focus on the role of initiation rituals in  creating solidarity among the boys who have together survived the ordeal  and their subordination to the power of the senior males. Initiation entails  secrecy and gradual revelation of cult knowledge—a period of many months,  years or even a lifetime, as in the case of the Ilahita. Those who breach the  secrets may be put to death. The unity of men—held together by secrets and  the common bonds of shared torment—is crucial in communities at war, which  is traditionally a chronic state of affairs. Perhaps the logical extreme in this  process is reached among the Sambia, who force the boys to have sex with the  bachelors and thereby create homoerotic bonds among them. Pacification, as  Herdt (1981a:210) predicted, brought the initiatory cycles to an end, and along  with it aggression towards women.  More psychologically oriented approaches emphasise the peculiar role of pain  in establishing solidary relationships (Morinis 1985), the repetitive compulsion  in which trauma is mastered by inflicting it on others, and, specifically in the  Melanesian context, ‘flash-bulb memory’, by which pain intensifies and engages  the initiate with ritual experience (Whitehouse 1996). Resistance Resistance  The term ‘resistance’ has been overworked in the postmodern literature, and  it rolls too easily off the tongue. Michael Brown (1996), in a perceptive essay,  ‘On Resisting “Resistance”’, points out that a primary function of the concept  has been to establish the user’s moral bona fides as an objector to oppression.  Brown notes that in the world of cultural studies, ‘cross dressing, tattooing,  women’s fashions, dirty jokes and rock videos are routinely held up as examples  of cultural resistance’. In the context of this essay, my use of the term is more  literal. ‘Resistance’ to ritual violence consists of efforts to escape; scepticism and  disavowal; discontinuance of custom; and remorse and shame. We shall find all  represented in the literature, though less than might be expected, and less than  we, while wearing our humanitarian hats, might wish. 249 </page> <page sequence="10"> Echoes of the Tambaran  The Clash of Values and the Origins of Resistance  Standing against the opposition of men and women and the extremes of ritual  violence are domestic relationships. In the case of the Ilahita Arapesh, domestic  relationships are positive. Tuzin describes the ‘extraordinary warmth and  affection’ between a man and his sister and between husband and wife. In  marriage, there is a sense of spiritual harmony that begins with a new couple’s  ‘pledge of eternal love and fidelity’ (Tuzin 1982:329–30). The contradictions of  domestic values and those of the men’s cult are likely to be especially serious  in this setting, and we shall see that it is just those values that seem to explain  the scepticism and alienation that Ilahita men have from their own initiatory  system. Among the Sambia, however, marital relationships are strained to the point of  disintegration. Women come from enemy villages; they may be ‘stolen’ or traded.  ‘Sex’, Herdt writes, ‘is fraught with anxiety. Physical fights are common... Sambia wife beating occurs and it is an ugly stain on the tenor of village life’  (1981a:174). But even among the Sambia, marriage confers a lifelong bond and has at least  a measure of happiness. One of Herdt’s informants notes: ‘When a couple walk  together from the forest, and everyone sees you returning from the gardens,  your family and friends are happy for you’ (Herdt 1981b:189). Following Herdt,  ‘joy is undeniably there for a moment’ (1981b). At minimum, even in the most  polarised of the Melanesian societies, men are bound to women for their own  identity: ‘only a wife and children bring full manhood’ (Herdt 1981a:34).  Primary relationships stand in stark contrast with the ritual violence associated  with the cults. The affection of husbands and wives and parents and children  is incompatible with the extremes of initiation. Conflict within the family  expresses the disjunction, in that the world of men is partly rejected by both  boys and their mothers. Hence, among the Sambia, boys almost always side with  their mothers in marital conflicts: ‘Boys express anger and fear towards their  fathers over this abuse of their mothers. I have seen boys try to hit their fathers  in defense of their mothers’ (Herdt 1981a:174).  The love of mothers for their sons spills over into the sacred territory of  initiation rituals. Sometimes their resistance is symbolic in that they might put  up a pretence of shielding their sons from masked initiators. But at other times  it is a serious battle. Herdt describes an altercation of more than an hour as  mothers ‘attempt to extract their sons from the crowded dance ground...there  are scuffles and arguments. Several times men angrily curse the women, who  move back only to approach again...the atmosphere is tense enough for a brawl.’  250 </page> <page sequence="11"> 11 . The Torments of Initiation and the Question of Resistance The men respond by attacking the women; ‘more startling is the treatment of  the mothers who are hit even harder by the men...some are hit hard enough so  that they fall on the ground’ (Herdt 1981a:137). Efforts to Escape  The most unmistakable signs of resistance are the efforts of the initiates to flee.  They scream, shout and cry and try to run away. The most dramatic examples I  have found are Herdt’s sensitive observations of the Sambia:  A boy refuses to be hoisted on his sponsor’s back...it takes three men  to do the job. His mother approaches...he grabs hold of her bamboo  necklace...tears wash down his face as he repeatedly cries ‘No, no,’ and  ‘Mother, mother.’ The poor woman...is nearly in tears herself...the men  severely swat the boy with blow after blow. (Herdt 1981a:137) One of the boys ‘struggles fiercely, so four men lift him off the ground, he is  forcibly nose-bled...the smell of blood and fear sours the air’ (Herdt 1981a:143). Herdt further documents that boys sometimes actually do escape, albeit briefly.  When they do, search parties are sent out, and when the boys return they are  beaten and treated more severely as a consequence. The central point that Herdt  makes is ultimately obvious to the boys: there is no escape. All boys must be  initiated. The fact that they resist at all, however, forms essential data. Despite  the obvious rewards of maturity, they do not enter manhood gladly. Shame Men’s cults—with their clash of domestic and cult values—are inherently  unsteady edifices. One of the markers of instability is shame in perpetuating  them. Among the Sambia, the men are deeply ashamed of their homosexual  relations with one another and of forcing their sons to fellate the bachelors. The  matter was a deep secret, revealed at pain of death. Tuzin also describes the shame of the men in deceiving both the women and  the initiates:  Aware that much of what passes for religious ‘truth’ is nothing but  artifice, cult members are placed in the embarrassing position of having  to confess to initiates that they—the initiates—have been systematically  deceived...[They] openly admit that they feel deeply shamed at having  their true role revealed to their sons. (Tuzin 1982:349)  251 </page> <page sequence="12"> Echoes of the Tambaran  For fathers, the gulf between the cult and reality is so wide that they seek to put  off the inevitable day when their sons learn that by their father’s own standards,  the voice of the Tambaran cult spirit is a fraud. Rationalisations  A ‘rationalisation’ differs from ‘an explanation’ in that it is an intellectualised  defence from guilt or remorse. The data are not always sufficiently fine-grained  to make this claim. Thus, indigenous explanations of initiation emphasise the  separation of boys from women and the magical techniques needed to make  men of them. Following Herdt, ‘[m]en are doing boys a favor in initiating  them’. The torments ‘are directed at the boys’ contaminated innards, which,  alas, must be violently penetrated to cleanse them’ (Herdt 1982:225–6). Is this a  rationalisation or an explanation? I believe it is the former, in that the torments  inflicted on the initiates are extreme, and the men’s anger towards the boys  is visceral. I have already described how the men tell the boys that they are  being punished (which does not fit the prevailing ethos of making men out  of boys), and they must at times be restrained from doing permanent physical  harm. Tuzin captures the implicit sadism of the rituals when he notes that even  if the torments are intended positively, they are also acts ‘of raw aggression  and dominance assertion’ (1980:74). Moreover, ‘the ordeal is carefully and  successfully designed to inspire maximum horror on its victims’ (Tuzin 1980).  In the case of the Sambia, we learn that when ‘the boys are carried through a  gauntlet of men with whips...the men take delight in it. Most of the initiates  cry’ (Herdt 1981a:137). Among the Avatip (a middle Sepik society), men scarify the boys to purge them  of female blood. But they claim that the boys have been ‘gored by spirits, whom  they portray as anthropomorphic beings with tusks’ (Harrison 1985:418).  Harrison (1985) directly interprets this as a ‘concession to the values prevailing  outside the ritual sphere’. It is certainly that, but that such concessions are  needed at all suggests the fragility of the enterprise and the real possibility of  shame and guilt, which are but one step away from active resistance. Scepticism and Disbelief Donald Tuzin’s work is unique in that he closely explored the scepticism and  moral uncertainty that marked the Ilahita cult. The cult persisted in its island of  secrecy but was everywhere else challenged by positive domestic relationships.  These erode certainty about the contaminating nature of women and ultimately  subvert masculine ideology. Tuzin writes that  252 </page> <page sequence="13"> 11 . The Torments of Initiation and the Question of Resistance more than once it was intimated to me that just as the fiction of the  physical [spirit] Nggwal enables men to dominate women, so the  invisible Nggwal enables the senior initiates to dominate the junior  colleagues. The lie is itself a life. Astonished upon hearing this I asked  my informant, ‘What, then, is the truth about the Nggwal?’ to which he  replied ‘Nggwal is what men do’. (Tuzin 1982:348) How did the cult persist in the face of such scepticism? Tuzin argues that the  men’s cult is ‘a cultural addiction, in which the pain of continuing these ritual  customs is exceeded only by the pain of relinquishing them’ (1982:350). Disbelief is surely an example of ‘resistance’. Herdt, however, objects. He  suggests that Tuzin’s perspective is culture bound and not that of the Arapesh.  He argues that the apparent guilt really reflects a post-colonial world, in which  the heart of the cult has been eaten out by the pressures of evangelism and  social change (Herdt 2003:205–7). The statement that the Tambaran is ‘what  men do’ suggests that faith in Nggwal is at the end of a process of cultural  change and ‘the dissolution of collective ritual into alienation’ (Herdt 2003:207).  Had the Ilahita men’s cult been in full flower, presumably Tuzin would not have  observed this scepticism, which, like the underlying guilt, would seem to be a  sentiment ‘reminiscent of Western middle class emotional constraints’ (Herdt  2003:195). Tuzin might respond that primary relationships and men’s cults are in chronic  disequilibrium. The imbalance among the Ilahita Arapesh leads to a degree of  reflection and eventually to disenchantment and alienation. It is inherent to the  system; ‘there is no reason to suppose that these reservations are not as ancient  as the beliefs themselves’ (Tuzin 1980:315). Herdt’s argument is more complex and sophisticated than we can do justice to  here. But I would argue that scepticism is normal in human affairs, that doubters  and local atheists are recurrent features of all social landscapes. Melanesian  men’s cults, however, would appear to be fertile ground for scepticism in that  the values of the cult are in such radical conflict with primary relationships.  Secrecy, as Herdt (2003) convincingly documents, makes it possible to sustain  both in their separate compartments, but it surely saps faith and credibility.  To an extent, even the Sambia recognise this. Hence, by the logic of equating  semen with breast milk, fathers should inseminate sons to make men of them,  just as mothers nursed boys. But of course this does not occur, despite its  theoretical plausibility. And in no case of which I am aware do fathers inflict the  most painful initiatory torments on their sons. There is, therefore, a separation  between domestic life and the cult, and from this space might grow resistance  to the formal system. 253 </page> <page sequence="14"> Echoes of the Tambaran  Scepticism and ambivalence might therefore be more than the bitter fruits  of culture contact, force-fed by judgmental officials, police patrols and  missionaries. Societies are not homogeneous and individuals are reflective even  if their voices are drowned out or actively suppressed by the chorus of believers  and enforcers. There are simply too many losers in the Ilahita, Sambia and other  initiatory systems for them to go without dissent. Surely, throughout initiatory  societies, there are mothers and fathers who would prefer that their sons opt  out, and I am quite sure the same thought has regularly occurred to the initiates  themselves. Senior men might be beneficiaries, but not women, not children,  not initiates manqué, not ‘rubbish men’ and not others who were marginalised  by the system.  Finally, we note the rapid collapse of such systems, as occurred among the  Sambia with the suppression of war. Herdt (Email, 14 December 2010) informs  me that not only has initiation ceased, but also the entire men’s cult is a thing  of the past. Tuzin’s (1997) own account of the spontaneous self-destruction of  the Ilahita men’s cult makes the same point just as dramatically. Men’s cults  are fragile, if dark, institutions, narrowly adapted to overwhelming need for  masculine solidarity. But they are fraught with contradiction, which we can  observe even while the system is in place. Conclusions Why does the suffering of the initiates disturb us, and why are we motivated  to seek resistance to it? I began this chapter by suggesting that we have no  true analogue to ritual violence. The closest approximation we have is that of  torture—a deeply evaluative word that anthropologists avoid in describing the  ordeals. We can, however, find many superficial resemblances between torture  and the ordeals in their exquisiteness, their technology and their intuitive  understanding of how to violate the human self. As Tuzin says of Ilahita, the  cult ‘engenders acts that are physically, emotionally, or, indeed, fantastically  terrorist’ (1982:347). But if we grant some resemblance, it shifts the direction  of the question: why is torture repugnant? The answer would seem to lie in  the intentionality of the act, the physical closeness of the torturer and the  victim and the relationship of the two. What torture violates is the fundamental  human capacity for empathy, upon which all morality is ultimately based. Ariel  Dorfman, a Chilean essayist, wrote: ‘Torture...requires, it craves the abrogation  of our capacity to imagine others’ suffering, dehumanizing them so much that  their pain is not our pain.’ In other words: ‘Torture obliges us to be deaf and  blind and mute’ (Dorfman 2007). 254 </page> <page sequence="15"> 11 . The Torments of Initiation and the Question of Resistance The fact of resistance shows that initiators are hardly indifferent. But at times  the raw sadism of many of the acts, in which the higher purposes of the ordeals  might not even be explained to the victims, point in another direction. What  overwhelming rage can nourish such an institution so that it was not only  invented and enacted, but also perpetuated by those who suffered at its hands?  This question takes us in a different direction. We might invoke the reasons  offered by Whitehouse and Morinis in their discussion of pain, and the need  to create a firmly bonded group of men. The psychological mechanisms that  facilitate this process such as identification with the aggressor and its association  with traumatic stress disorder might also be part of it. But does this suggest  that the pattern is pathological, and that the society itself, is, by extension,  emotionally disturbed? Many anthropologists are uncomfortable with such  judgments because we lack a clear standard for diagnosing a society’s mental  status as opposed to that of an individual. In the present instance, the sum total  of behaviour associated with men’s cults has the look of pathology but does it  have its substance? Freud, who did not hesitate to read culture and behaviour  as if they constituted a single personality, was himself aware of the danger of  conflating the two. Hence, he noted that the striking resemblance of taboos and  the obsessive-compulsive neurosis ‘may be no more than a matter of externals,  just as the branching structure of trees and crystals are essentially unrelated’  (Freud 2004:31).  Are men’s cults therefore simply unusual cultural scripts, or, in Tuzin’s terms,  ‘cultural addictions’, but not reflective of individual personality? I am inclined to  believe otherwise. The ego-dystonic nature of the cults, with their concomitant  rationalisations and sense of shame, is all too suggestive. The fact that the cults  might collapse from the internal weight of moral ambivalence (as in the case of  the Ilahita), or with a relatively gentle external nudge (as in the instance of the  Sambia), is further evidence. Finally, the inventive nature of the sadism, and  the extraordinary brutality towards initiates, is surely deeply rooted in primary  process thought.  For the moment, however, it is enough to say that the participants in the cults  are not themselves of one mind. Ideology and conduct are sufficiently disjoined  so that some do object. They distance themselves from the initiations, they  disbelieve, they resist. This does occur—less frequently than we might wish,  but often enough to at least partly dispel Freud’s bleak view of the human  condition with which I began this chapter.  255 </page> <page sequence="16"> Echoes of the Tambaran  References  Bateson, Gregory 1958.
