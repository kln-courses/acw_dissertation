Reviewed by Dale Rex Coman Our country has produced an impres- sive company of nature writers. Those of years past were inspired by the abundance and diversity of wildlife and the magnifi- cence and varied character of the terrain, while a growing number of our current writers are expressing outrage or despair about our abuses of the land and its wild- living inhabitants. To try to assign nature writers to cat- egories is surely hazardous, but there do ODALE REX COMAN is professor of path- ology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. He is the author of many essays on the outdoors and on natural history. 536</page><page sequence="2">THE REVOLVING BOOKSTAND seem to be those who dwell chiefly upon reporting their observations and then mak- ing a few pertinent interpretations thereof. John Burroughs of old and John Terres of today, for example, would certainly rank high in that group. At the other ex- treme are those who, upon a foundation of relatively few observations of natural phenomena, construct themes embracing all life, including that of humans, and who try to probe beyond the scientifically sup- portable into the philosophically conceiv- able and the intellectually provocative. Henry David Thoreau at once comes to mind and abruptly thereafter, Joseph Wood Krutch. Mr. Krutch is a man of many parts - drama critic, philosopher, teacher, natur- alist and prolific writer - whose first book was published in 1924. A long list of vol- umes embraces his wide range of interests. A book composed of selections from an author's works is seldom wholly successful, even when, as in the present instance, the selections are made by the author himself. Those who know the writer well are sure to complain that some of his finest pro- ducts are inexcusably missing and that too many of his less impressive pieces are pre- sented. The new reader, on the other hand, is often left wondering just what sort of writer he has met, and it is a toss up whether he will be prodded into acquiring some of the author's other books or decide that he has had enough. It must take some courage, then, for a writer to risk such a venture. Mr. Krutch has done so and, in this reviewer's opinion, he has succeeded admirably. The book is divided into five sections, "New England and the Desert," "Other Lives," "Shapes of Earth," "Nature and Human Nature" and "The Meaning of Conservation." The first part recounts the author's awakening interest in natural history and the later captivation of his fancy by the southwestern part of the United States where he now lives. In "Other Lives" he describes some of the more intriguing plants and animals he has observed. "Shapes of Earth" is chiefly geo- logical with emphasis on the Grand Can- I SHAKESPEARE'S BLACKFRIARS I I PLAYHOUSE I Its History and Its Design I Irwin Smith Now available in paperback - "As a source for complete information of the Blackfriars playhouses during the Eliza- bethan and Jacobean ages, this volume is unsurpassed." - Quarterly Journal of Speech 577 pages $4.95 paper/$15.00 cloth I THE NEW WAVE SPANISH DRAMA I An Anthology I George E.

The book is attractively put together. There are eleven line drawings by Lydia Rosier; one might well wish there were more. Every thoughtful and serious writer has certain pet causes to champion and cer- tain knots that he persistently tries to un- tie. Mr. Krutch, while grateful for the sorting out - the taxonomie chores- -done by the scientists, is more than a little nettled by their unemotional objectivity, and by their sometimes pain-inducing lab- oratory methods, often in pursuit of seemingly worthless scraps of knowledge. There is no question but that these ac- cusations are justified to some indetermin- able degree. His criticism that scientists are lacking in humanistic, compassionate and empathie qualities, however, can be ap- plied properly, I hope and believe, only to a few among the many. Most scientists are guided by motivations as lofty, and as base, as those that steer any other intelli- gent people as they grope for understand- ing of the vast and perplexing universe in which they live. The plea for a more humanistic ap- proach to natural history is sound and valid, as is the author's insistence that joy, as contrasted with mere fun, lies ". . . there amid those portions of the earth man has not yet entirely pre-empted for his own use." He goes on to say that perhaps when people ". . . have become aware of joy in other creatures they will achieve joy them- selves by sharing in it." Mr. Krutch recognizes and enthusiasti- cally accepts his close kinship with all other living things on the planet. With- out his actually having said so anywhere, I think he would agree, however, that raccoons are no more clever little people than people are oversized and rather clumsy raccoons. In brief, he has never allowed sentimentalism and anthropomorphism to sweep him off balance, no matter how lu- crative the undertaking might prove to be. The attractiveness of raccoons and people lie in the differences, the uniquenesses of the two, rather than in those similarities 538</page><page sequence="4">THE REVOLVING BOOKSTAND pertaining to both as members of the mam- malian tribe. I could easily pick out my favorites among the thirty-four essays presented, but I would rather let each reader choose his own without prejudice. One essay, "Coral Dunes," deserves special mention not only because it is good, but also because it has never before appeared in a book. I can say wholeheartedly that I thoroughly en- joyed reading the volume, and I strongly urge you to read it. The natural history is beguiling and informative, and the philo- sophical dissertations are entertaining and thought-stimulating. It is a warm and friendly book written with great insight into the complex world of the living as it endures upon that spinning sphere of star- stuff called Earth.</page></plain_text>
