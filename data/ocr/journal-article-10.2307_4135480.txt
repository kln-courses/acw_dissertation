Isabella Abbott's Taxonomy of economic seaweeds has ap- peared since 1985 in nine volumes (1985, 1988, 1992, 1994, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2004; see Taxon 35: 626, 38: 452, 41: 624, 45: 410, 47: 248, 48: 879, 52: 404-we missed vol. 4). These useful publications on Caribbean and especially Pacific seaweeds derived from various international workshops and were solely (vols. 2-7) or jointly edited (vol. 1 with J.N. Norris; vols. 8-9 with K.J. McDermid) by Abbott. Volume 9 (2004) is distinctive for several reasons: It is the first to emanate from Hawaii (Honolulu) rather than California (La Jolla). It contains a pithy article by Paul Silva entitled "Classification, taxonomy, and phylogeny and their rela- tion to nomenclature, with special reference to algae" (pp. 3-18). Lastly, it is the first volume to come with a CD-ROM. Only $5, this contains Acrobat-readable pdf files of the workshop plus two book-length articles: Glenn, Edward P. &amp; Pfund, Rose T.

To most readers of Taxon, The bookplate journal is very much what the late Joseph Ewan called a "supernumerary, fringe, extralimital, outrigger item." Every now and then, however, it has something to interest the botanist. The latest issue (n.s., vol. 2, no. 1) contains Anthony Pincott's pioneering article (pp. 3-30) on "the pioneer English bookplate collector" Miss Sarah Sophia Banks (1744-1818). Her brother Sir Joseph (1734-1820), with whom she lived for nearly 50 years, collected books and plants; her sister-in- law Dorothea (1758-1828), Lady Banks of Rosa banksiae fame, collected old china; and Miss Banks collected printed and minted ephemera-coins, medals, tickets of admission, broadside ballads, visiting cards, playbills, and bookplates. In search of specimens both brother and sister ventured far from the fashionable districts of London. Anecdotes of the two run in parallel courses. Sir Joseph Banks circumnavigated the world and was reputed to have enjoyed without inhibition the Freedom of the [South] Seas. Sarah Banks circumambulated the city, where she was taken, in the absence of her servant, for an itinerant bal- lad-singer. Her collections also benefited greatly from her broth- er's vast web of connections at home and abroad. The Banks estab- lishment at Soho Square was a research institution avant la lettre, not least in its mastery of administrative detail. The Solander Case, devised by Banks and his friend Daniel Carl Solander (1733-82), is used to this day by both botanists and bookplate collectors. Miss Banks's style of mounting and labeling specimens, in turn, clearly owed much to herbarium practice. Primitive schemes of classification tend to find a place for everything but nothing more. Established round holes accommo- date only with difficulty (or not at all) the subsequent discovery of a square peg, just as established religions are reluctant to admit of new revelations. By the time of Miss Banks, more universal and expandable systems had been fashioned; these not only anticipat- ed the unknown in a particular sphere, but could be applied across Column closed 30 July 2004.

In Specimen monachologiae (1783), the satirical taxonomy of the orders of monks devised by the Transylvanian mineralogist Ignaz von Born (1742-91), a sexual system of sandal and tonsure (rather than stamen and pistil) hints obliquely at that wider world-as do the schemes for the classifi- cation of engraved prints published in the 18th century by such well-placed curators as Karl-Heinrich von Heinecken. In his recent edition (Bibliotheque Nationale, 1988) of the Paris-Dresden print- room correspondence of Hughes-Adrien Joly and Heinecken, W. McAllister Johnson prints as an appendix a wonderful schedule of classification for French Revolutionary engravings. Attempted in 1790 while the political situation was still evolving, it offers, espe- cially in its 15 subspecies of "satires contre le clerge, " a taxono- my of insult and indignity in which the light of Linnaeus shines clearly through the prism of Born. It would thus be misleading to view Miss Banks's collecting as no more than an eccentric hobby that aped the conventions of her brother's more serious studies. Clearly the family pursuits ran in tandem, as they did a century later in the single person of the New York botanist and bibliographer John Hendley Barnhart (1871-1949), notorious for his inability to discard anything, how- ever ephemeral. Both Banks siblings shared an archival and aes- thetic sense, along with a belief that critical mass was essential for any serious comparative study. The contents of Miss Banks's cup- boards could rival in extent any private herbarium or library of the time, with over 19,000 items on paper and over 2000 in metal. All of her "rattle-traps" or knick-knackery were left to Lady Banks, but were given immediately (even peremptorily) by Sir Joseph to the British Museum, where they were later joined by his own sub- stantial scientific collections. Miss Banks's treasures have attracted relatively little atten- tion over the last two centuries, and the bookplates, which include specimens from her brother's naturalist friends, have been ignored by historians. In its lively account of a parallel universe of taxon- omy, this agreeably written and lavishly illustrated article (19 fig- ures) adds a new dimension to our knowledge of the Banks house- hold and its private museum. - Ian Jackson, Box 9075, Berkeley, CA 94709, USA Crum,t Howard (Alvin). 28 May 2004.

Howard Crum's (1922-2002) monumental (figuratively and literally) "final book" is scholarly, yet readable (accessible even to the layperson), beautifully executed, and bargain-priced ($40 or $50 postpaid). According to senior editor Bill Buck (p. vii for all quotes), Crum "had finished his revision (more substantial than in previous editions [1973, 1976, 1983])" but sans captions to the fig- ures. Buck "read over the manuscript and either revised or wrote the figure captions for most of the plates," and also "updated the nomenclature, sometimes only parenthetically, ... in some cases [slipping] in a few personal preferences." This classic work covers all of the Great Lakes Basin and eastern Saint Lawrence River Valley. I have no stats for genera and species treated; the table of contents lists 45 families. Treatment is thorough, for instance, 45 pages for 23 species of Sphagnum, and illustration is extensive: a frontispiece of Crum in the field and 212 figures, including 2 pages of photos of Sphagnum and 210 plates of line drawings. Roger Crum's touching foreword about St. Christopher is not to be missed.

In Taxon 52: 157-159 I lauded Urs Eggli &amp; Heidrun E.K. Hartmann (ed.)'s magnificent six-volume Illustrated handbook of succulent plants (2001-03), also available in a German edition, Sukkulentenlexikon, which treated all succulents except cacti. The Etymological dictionary is done in the same format (cover size and color) and supplies the meanings of "currently accepted" Latin "names given to all known succulent plants, including cacti" (back-cover blurb, emphasis added). There are "7006 [entries] with 8142 different explanations for 11439 taxa (572 genera, 9353 species and 1514 infraspecific taxa)," with "more than 20% 'over- lap', where the same explanation applies to two or more taxa" (p. xv). Names are those accepted in the Handbook and, for cacti, in E.F. Anderson's The cactus family (2001) and D. Hunt (comp.)'s CITES Cactaceae checklist, 2nd edition (1999) (respectively, see Taxon 50: 631, 641). The dictionary excludes synonyms, artificial hybrids, and cultivars and mainly prefers masculine forms (e.g., albus over alba and album). Fun stuff: The most commonly used epithets are grandiflorus (21 taxa), pubescens and pulchellus (16 each), and robustus (15). Harry Hall (1906-86) has 22 commemorations (1 generic, 21 spe- cific), Hans Herre (1895-1979) 21 (all specific), and Neville S. Pillans (1884-1964) 19 (all specific). And Peter R.O. Bally (1895-1980) has 3 commemorative specific epithets in one genus (Euphorbia). Again, these data exclude synonyms. Two entries will illustrate format: Sedum Lat.

However, such would hardly detract from the excellence and extreme usefulness of this compilation. - Rudolf Schmid, UC Harlow, Nora &amp; Jakob, Kristin (ed.; w/ contribs. by Roger Raiche, Nevin Smith, Ron Lutsko, Jr., Jacob Sigg, Wayne Roderick, Suzanne Schettler, Caroline Spiller, Linda Haymaker, Jenny Fleming, Elizabeth McClintock &amp; Kristin Jakob). 2003 (publ.

California has an incredible floristic richness for native bulb and bulblike plants, irids, graminoids, and leaf succulents. The edi- tors and a bevy of well-known horticulturists (see heading; the preface notes their contributions) have produced an excellent vol- ume that stems from a native-plant study group formed circa 1975. For each species there is, as appropriate, information on names (accepted, synonyms, common), anthropomorphic cultural entries for "prefers" and "accepts," phenology ("blooms"), and one to several paragraphs on morphology, native distribution, ecology, horticulture, and available cultivars. Illustration is a fine combina- tion of 1 B&amp;W state map, 74 B&amp;W line drawings, and 58 color photos. Focus is on 69 genera and 252 species that are available commercially (or at plant sales of societies or botanical gardens), logically eschewing rare plants. My tally is from the 15-page appendicular checklist for "site preferences." This handy checklist has entries for "sun dry," "sun moist," "shade dry," "shade moist," and "comments," but needs entries added for "family" and "page number." With such a wealth of clearly presented information, this book will prove a model of its horticultural kind. - Rudolf Schmid, UC Hobhouse, Henry. 2003.

Hobhouse's (bom 1924) Seeds of wealth: Four plants that made men rich on timber, "wine" (actually grape), rubber, and tobacco is in the same format as his Seeds of change: Six plants that transformed mankind, new ed. (1999, previous editions 1985, 1986, 1992; see Taxon 49: 861) on quinine, sugar, tea, cotton, pota- to, and coca. Both are sparsely illustrated works, having mainly a figure heading each chapter, Wealth the poorer in lacking even a map. The essays have endnotes and are opinionated, far-ranging, and most readable. Parts of both books were relevant to an exhibi- tion, "Seeds of change," held in 1992 at the Smithsonian Institute, Washington. Hobhouse acted as a consultant to the exposition and originally suggest- ed the theme. ... [He] was not responsible for the political cor- rectness of the exposition. A modem blight sees history through a prism (or fog) that distorts much of the past, not because of often obvious absurdities, but because of anachro- nisms. Contemporary political correctness can only exist after certain conditions have been fulfilled. These conditions did not exist before current technology made them possible. So, to consider the past when these factors could not be present under the assumption that they were, is naive of students. For teachers it is at best ignorant and, at its worst, close to intel- lectual fraud. In brief, Columbus was never politically cor- rect, nor could he be, nor could anyone be whom he met in the New World. (p. vi) Well said, and certainly not the dominant view in Berkeley, where PC and deconstructionism run amuck. - Rudolf Schmid, UC Kutschera, Lore (anat.) &amp; Lichtenegger, Erwin (morph.).

"Out of sight, out of mind!" This old adage explains the rela- tive neglect that roots have suffered over the ages. Over the past half century octogenarian Lore Kutschera (born Sep. 1917), most- ly with Erwin Lichtenegger, has tried to remedy the many lacunae in our subterranean knowledge by detailed and far-ranging studies of the morphology and anatomy of root systems. She has produced eight books (see heading) that total over 3800 pages, as well as many papers. This sixth volume in her "root series" (see heading for precursors) is copiously illustrated: 182 full-page plates con- sisting of 27 B&amp;W illustrations (including SEM) and 1257 superb color photos of habitats, habit, root systems, and root anatomy, plus 188 figures of fine B&amp;W drawings by Erwin Lichtenegger (there are also 3 extra B&amp;W figures curiously labeled "Fig." rather than "Abb."). This pictorial cornucopia treats 78 species of trees and shrubs: 4 families, 8 genera, and 11 species of conifers, 21 families, 35 genera, and 67 species of dicotyledons. Depicted are common central European taxa such as Juglans regia and Populus alba, widespread taxa such as Juniperus communis, and exotics (to Austria) such as Pseudotsuga menziesii and Sequoiadendron giganteum (alas not also Sequoia sempervirens). There is detailed information, for instance, for the last three taxa, respectively, 8.5, 8.5, 3 pages of description and illustration. Text includes informa- tion for morphology, anatomy, ecology, and distribution. Each species generally gets two pages of color, usually on opposing pages, and a selection of line drawings, all of which are handily close to the text. This atlas contains a wealth of information. Inspecting the 869</page><page sequence="4">Schmid * Reviews and notices TAXON 53 (3) * August 2004: 867-887 photos and drawings is instructive, and is accessible even to those with a minimal knowledge of German. For example, compare sec- tional pictures showing the shallow root system of S. giganteum versus the more extensive one ofJ. communis, differences reflect- ing in part moisture regimes of these two species. A lot of work has gone into Kutschera's rooty research, from the painstaking exca- vations to show intact root systems, to the thorough anatomical work, and finally to the exemplary production. The botanical com- munity is greatly indebted to her for literally and figuratively get- ting her hands dirty in producing such magnificent masterpieces. - Rudolf Schmid, UC Munz,t Philip A.

Munz (1892-1974) must be turning over in his grave, with delight at the excellence of these updates of his immensely popular quadrilogy treating spring, desert, mountain, and shore wildflowers of California. Originally published in, respectively, 1961, 1962, 1963, and 1964, the mountain and shore guidebooks had their first revisions last year (for review see R. Schmid, Taxon 53: 234-235), the spring and desert guides theirs this year. All are in uniform format: The paperbacks are 192x123 mm and actually are flexibound, with stiff, plasticized covers. Each work has a pithy introduction by Robert Ornduff (1932-2000) on the relevant plant communities. Naturally all updates have better quality and more numerous photos (see details in the heading comparing the new and old editions), revised nomenclature, and modernized text. The editors intended "to make the new edition[s] readable, entertaining, and informative to today's readers" (Desert wildflowers, p. xi); I detected no dumb- ing-down. The spring wildflower book treats over 400 taxa (fide the back-cover blurb) that are arrayed into four floral color groups plus "trees," a selection of nine showy dicotyledons; the number of taxa covered is substantially larger than in the 1961 edition, but I have no comparison figures short of doing an actual count. The desert book retains "Munz's original selections, without additions or eliminations" (Idem, p. ix) and treats over 240 taxa (fide the back-cover blurb). These are arrayed into four floral color groups plus "ferns and fern allies," which also illustrates Ephedra nevadensis and mentions three conifers. The desert guide is espe- cially attractive in sporting Jon M. Stewart superb photography, some of which had appeared in his excellent Colorado Desert wildflowers (1993) and Mojave Desert wildflowers (1998) that I reviewed in Taxon 47: 785-786. The desert book, incidentally, does not treat the Great Basin, which, in fact, remains out-of- bounds from the Munz quadrilogy. The updates are truly fine.

This dealt with Johann Reinhold Forster (1729-98) and his son Johann Georg Adam (1754-94) and their botanical contributions to the 2nd Cook Expedition (1772-75). The main intent of the work is to detail the locations of the Forsters's herbarium specimens, but there is also much nomenclatural and historical information. Taxa treated include fungi, lichens, brown algae, bryophytes (15 pages), pteridophytes (58 pages), and seed plants (540 pages). I gloss over the excellence and thoroughness of this account to focus on bibliographic confusions.

I publisher/distributor/jack- et-cover explanation centered vs. these in ed. 2 flush left Tables of contents identical except ed. 1 has an extra "note in proof' (p. 760), which is incorporated on pp. 485-486 of text of ed. 2 Prefaces (dated Aug. 2001) identical and main text virtually iden- tical through p. 705, with index (pp. 707-759) corrected in ed. 2. The publisher noted (pers. comm., 5 May 2004) about the "cor- rected edition": "The book [the 2003 issue] was defective (the sys- tematic index did not correspond to the page numbers of the text)." That is, the pagination in the index of edition one progressively drifts up to ten or so pages off. Dan Nicolson informed me (pers. comm., 23 Apr. 2004) that edition 2 also has "a few minor changes such as correcting French 'Iles' to 'les.'" Owners of this fine work should check that they have the corrected edition. - Rudolf Schmid, UC Ochyra, Ryszard; Zarnowiec, Jan &amp; Bednarek-Ochyra, Halina. 7 Nov. 2003.

Years ago, in conversation with Ryszard Ochyra, he averred to me that he had no formal background in bryology at the time that he was given responsibility for the bryophytes in the Polish Academy of Sciences. He asserted that much of his creativity in the field came from having to develop his own philosophy of bryophyte taxonomy. He learned taxonomic categories not from following the outlines of previous workers but instead by directly observing the specimens. Bryology owes a great debt to the superb creativity of R. Ochyra and his wife, Halina Bednarek-Ochyra. They have together reorganized generic and even familial cate- gories in bryology. Whether or not we accept those new categories is less important than the fact that they have forced our rethinking of bryophyte taxonomy. Census catalogue of Polish mosses (CCPM) is a careful spec- imen-based study that includes all the elements one would wish in a moss catalog of a geographic area. However, my own antipathy to the use of "common names" makes me question the value of a comprehensive listing of Polish language "common names" (chap. 7). CCPM is built upon a systematic arrangement and listing of the 700 moss species so far verified for Poland (chap. 2). The sequence of that listing is reminiscent ofA.J. Shaw &amp; B. Goffinet's Bryophyte biology (2000; see Taxon 50: 320), but the lack of an index anywhere in the book makes the book initially very difficult to use. One needs first to consult the species list in chapter 2 find- ing a species or other taxon of interest. Nearly all taxa in that chap- ter have a numbered superscript that refers to a numbered note in chapter 5. All the taxonomic and nomenclatural opinions and revi- sions contained in the book are justified in chapter 5. Seldom has a floristic listing contained so many innovations in the taxonomic hierarchy: the book provides a new name for a class, two subclasses, an order, a suborder, a subfamily, a genus, a subgenus, and seven sections. The changes of hierarchical level are so numerous as to be beyond the scope of this review. New combinations and new names at the species and sub- species level are especially numerous, for instance, for new com- binations: Bicosta 1 (Andreaeaceae), Hymenoloma 21, Seligeria 1 (Seligeriaceae), Diobelonella 1 (Dicranaceae), Dryptodon 32, Guembelia 17, Orthogrimmia 14, Streptocolea 1 (Grimmiaceae, all segregates of Grimmia); Bucklandiella 62, Codriophorus 15, Niphotrichum 9 (Grimmiaceae, all segregates of Racomitrium), Rosulabryum 19 (Bryaceae), Campylidium 10 (Amblystegiaceae), Brachytheciastrum 4, Eurhynchiastrum 1, Oxyrrhynchium 1, Sciuro-hypnum 8 (Brachytheciaceae), Pylaisia 3 (Hypnaceae). This list of new combinations is by no means restricted to plants of Polish distribution but is of worldwide importance. The bibliography (chap. 10) is one of the most useful of the chapters in that it provides access to numerous, seldom cited ref- erences from eastern Europe. It may be noted that nearly 13 of the 58 pages of the bibliography are publications by Ochyra &amp; Bednarek-Ochyra. The extreme productivity of these authors make problems in citations in that Ochyra et al. can refer to any of per- haps 50 papers, with even the date of publication still leaving one with uncertainty as to the paper being cited. This work intrudes itself into our attention by the sheer vol- ume of its changes. It is by no means of regional interest alone. Most of the plants treated here are of broad distribution in Europe or even throughout temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. I am especially impressed with the treatment of Grimmiaceae and will follow many of the nomenclatural changes recommended. As to the names newly submitted for hierarchical categories, I can only say that it does make more complete our classifications while suggesting the question "Why bother?" CCPM should be in every bryologist's library, whether or not the nomenclatural changes are followed. - Daniel H. Norris, UC and H &lt;dhnorris@uclink .berkeley.edu&gt; Poorter, L.

This book is both timely and beau- tiful: timely, in that it profiles both the forest destruction and many of the endemics in danger of extinction; and beautiful, in that it makes it look as if its material is accessible and authoritative, and in most cases it is too. West Africa sensu this book stretches from Senegal to Ghana. This is rather sensu stricto, as there is moist forest in Nigeria as well, but the "Dahomey Gap" is a natural boundary and thus the forests with which this book is concerned form a unit in its own right, the Upper Guinea phytochorion. In the first part of the book, the deforestation is documented, and illustrated through satellite imagery. Joined with the data that are presented on the various forest types, and the plant diversity therein, this leads to a chapter on implications for conservation and management. The optimal areas for conservation of plant diversi- ty are highlighted, as are several areas with large numbers of rare species. This part would already provide an interesting publication in its own right. But what lifts the book as a whole into the "extraordinary" bracket is the second part treating individual species. These treat- ments support and illustrate the data in the first part of the book, but more than that they form an exemplary treatment of rare and endemic species. Oh, si sic omnes. Each species has notes on description, habitat and distribution; this is supported by graphs on phenology, B&amp;W or color illustrations in about two-thirds of the species, a distribution map plus an overview map of the region, and a little spreadsheet at the bottom of each page giving informa- 871</page><page sequence="6">Schmid * Reviews and notices TAXON 53 (3) * August 2004: 867-887 tion on the number of herbarium records, altitude, habitat, rainfall data, and soil data. All of this is presented in a neat lay-out, with judicious use of color to give a real feeling of clarity, conciseness, and accessibility. The fact that some of the graphs are based on a single herbarium specimen is rather worrying not only due to rar- ity of species but also due to lack of reliability of the data. I can- not think of anything left out except, possibly, conservation assess- ments for the rare and endemic species. A second section in the same format deals with commercial timber species, with extra information on regeneration and uses. Such a treatment of 280 rare-plant species and 56 large timber species from a high-diversi- ty vegetation type in the tropics is certainly unique in Africa, and as far as I know unique for any large region in the tropics. A final chapter gives, as if all this were not enough, a check- list of all the 2800 vascular plant species known from the forests of Upper Guinea. I am deeply impressed with the whole publica- tion, both in its contents and its presentation. I hope other people will find it as inspirational as I do; it certainly inspires me to try and imitate it for East Africa! - Henk Beentje, K &lt;h.beentje@ rbgkew.org.uk&gt; Ren Xian-wei (Hsien-Wei Jen) &amp; Zhang Yu-jun (Yujun Zhang) (ed.). 2003. A list of the woody plants of China in Chinese-Latin- English. China Forestry Publishing House, Beijing (cfphz@public .bta.net.cn). 577 pp., unill., 250x170mm, ISBN 7-5038-1672-4 (HB), V88.00. - Contents: See review. Up to now the exact number of species of Chinese woody plants has been unknown. Estimates ranged from a few thousand to about 10,000, and little attempt has been made to analyze these figures. This book accomplishes this task and for the first time offers an exact number for species of Chinese woody plants. Because these are widely cultivated, especially in Europe and North America, and are often integral to many research activities, this book is pertinent to a large academic audience outside China. The book is divided into seven parts: Part 1 (pp. 1-315) is a checklist of woody plant species of China. As in the main index, this section is broken into three parts: woody ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. Each entry (family, genus, and species) lists the Chinese, Latin, and English names. Part 2 (pp. 317-333) lists woody plant families and genera alphabetically by Latin name. Beside each entry, the authors list page numbers for cross-refer- encing to part one. Part 3 (pp. 335-402) is an index by Chinese character strokes, listing species, genera, and families. Part 4 (pp. 403-470) is an index by Chinese spelling (Hanyu Pinyin only), listing species, genera, and families. Part 5 (pp. 471-481) is a Latin-name index to families, genera, and species. Part 6 (pp. 482-489) is a Latin-synonym index to common synonyms. Part 7 (pp. 490-575) is an English-name index to family, genera, and species. Parts 3 to 7 have page number referencing to parts 1 and 2. According to this work, the total number of woody plant taxa (trees, shrubs, vines, and subshrubs) is 11,082 species, 98 sub- species, and 190 varieties (including cultivars) representing 172 families and 1271 genera. Ferns consist of a single family with 2 genera and 14 species, whereas gymnosperms comprise 11 fami- lies, 40 genera, and 160 species. Angiosperms have 160 families (using the Engler system, with a few exceptions), 1229 genera, and 10,908 species. Past estimates have varied, but they never before exceeded 10,000 species. Professor Hsien-wei Jen (Ren Xian-wei, 1929-97), former Professor of Dendrology and an expert on Chinese species of Quercus at Beijing Forestry University, initiated this work in the late 1980s. Before his unfortunate death in January 1997, he had finished the main list of the project, that is, part 1. His student (and son-in-law) Zhang Yu-jun compiled these records into a compre- hensive database. Zhang left China to pursue his Ph.D. at Shimane University in Japan in 1997, leaving the work for others to com- plete. Later, the Beijing Forest University and the China Forestry Publishing House organized an editorial committee, finished the other index parts of the book, and sent the manuscript to seven experts in Chinese dendrology for final review before the book went to press. While the book certainly contributes to our understanding of Chinese woody plants, which is important for current botanical exploration in China, the list needs improvement in several areas. Firstly, the English names need to be updated: many are antiquat- ed and not currently used in the West. Because many common names in English exist, multiple names need to be added to the list. For example, Metasequoia glyptostroboides has many common names, including "dawn redwood," "Chinese redwood," "Chinese sequoia," "water fir," "water cypress." However, only the first name appears in this work, although recent research suggests that "water fir" is a more appropriate English (common) name (J.S. Ma, 2003, On the unsolved mystery of Metasequoia, Acta Bot. Yunnanica 25: 155-172). Secondly, the nomenclature of some taxa needs updating to accord with accounts published in the Flora Reipublicae Popularis Sinica (FRPS) and the revised English lan- guage Flora of China (FoC), coordinated at Missouri Botanical Garden (see entry under "Notices-Floristics ..." and http://flora .huh.harvard.edu/china). Thirdly, although the list contains both Latin and English names for each taxon, there are no English names below species level, which, fortunately, involves fewer than 290 names. Finally, the forward, preface, and "user's instructions and rules used in compilation" appear only in Chinese. Because these sections lack an English counterpart, the book is less acces- sible to English readers, or a Western audience in general, than it deserves to be. We hope that this review will help readers under- stand the organization of this work, which is a most useful refer- ence tool to taxonomists and horticulturists interested in the Chinese flora. - J.

Timber Press has another spectacular winner with this beau- tiful, large-format tree book. It has detailed accounts of 96 species (in 64 genera) native to Canada and the United States east of the Rockies: 11 species (8 genera) of gymnosperms, 84 species (55 genera) of dicotyledons, and the sole monocotyledon Sabal pal- metto. Topics treated in each profile are: descriptive overview; leaves; flowers and fruit (or cones and seeds); best season; native and adaptive range; culture; problems; cultivars; similar and relat- ed species. The last topic is often appreciable. In all, the book dis- cusses over 650 species and varieties and over 500 cultivars. Illustration is extensive: 513 color photos plus 96 B&amp;W silhou- ettes of habit and leaves.

A truly spectacular effort, this superb but very hefty field guide owes its inspiration to the Austrian charitable association Regenwald der Osterreicher. The book was also undoubtedly inspired by Paul H. Allen's classic 1956 book, The rain forests of Golfo Dulce (also 1977 reissue, with forward by Peter Raven). The first 44 pages of the current field guide contain the obligatory overviews on physical and biological phenomena. Then follow 31 pages for identifying plant families, including a list of "special habits and 'spot characters"' and two keys, all three based on A.H. Gentry's A field guide to the families and genera of woody plants of northwest South America (Colombia, Ecuador, Peru) (1993, 1996 reissue-for review see R. Schmid, Taxon 45: 578-579). The "survey key" (4 pages) is an abbreviation of the detailed "annotat- ed key" (24 pages). The heart of the book (348 pages) details 627 genera and 960 species of seed plants, including Zamiafairchild- iana and Podocarpus guatemalensis, which contra the title and page 50 are not "flowering plants." This is a good representation of the, "so far, 2369 species in 961 genera of 182 families of vas- cular plants ... [that] have been recorded from the Golfo Dulce Area," including "over 700 tree species" (p. 15, also 50). The treat- ments have keys to genera and species and thorough descriptions. The B&amp;W illustration is excellent, but it is the gang of 106 plates with some 700 color photos that will truly impress. Appendix 4 is an 18-page checklist of pteridophytes and seed plants collected "until" October 2001 (i.e., through 30 Sep.), a remarkably up-to- date list as the entire guide was published on 8 November 2001. This remarkable and inexpensive book should not be overlooked. - Rudolf Schmid, UC Theophrastus among the Calvinists Ian Jackson, Box 9075, Berkeley, CA 94709, USA Candolle, Augustin Pyramus de. 2004 (publ.

Librairie Droz in Geneva has recently published a remarkable catalog on the history of classical philology, a tribute to Olivier Reverdin (perhaps the greatest scholar ever to have run a daily newspaper), under the suggestive title Hombre chez Calvin (2002). Georg Editeur, also in Geneva, has now issued a book that might well have been subtitled Theophraste chez Calvin. The Greek botanist, it will be remembered, recorded the "characters" of peo- ple as well as plants, in which pursuit he found a worthy successor in Augustin-Pyramus de Candolle (1778-1841). The elder Can- dolle's Mimoires et souvenirs are already celebrated through the carefully abridged version of 1862 of his son Alphonse de Candolle (1806-93) This splendid new edition prints for the first time the entire text from manuscript. It does not entirely replace the original publication, a fact that would ordinarily occasion some gnashing of recensorial teeth. The editors, however, make a con- vincing case (pp. 39-42) for regarding Alphonse de Candolle's redaction (with its hundred-odd pages of editorial additions) as the independent creation of an eminent botanist of the second genera- tion that should be evaluated and cherished as a historical docu- ment in its own right. The present edition, as they recognize, is only a first step- the autobiography deserves a diplomatic edition, as does the vast unpublished correspondence, and other treasures in the family archives, including the travel diaries, of which only the Voyage aux Pyrendes has been published (see my review in Taxon 49: 136, 873</page><page sequence="8">Schmid * Reviews and notices TAXON 53 (3) * August 2004: 867-887 2000). This edition of the MdJmoires et souvenirs has been pub- lished with the financial assistance of several Candolles (p. vi), which presumably accounts for its modest price and attractive pro- duction. The type is agreeably large and legible; the notes are at the foot of the page for convenient reference and are more than adequate without being intrusively informative. Jean-Marc Drouin's elegant introduction (pp. 1-35) sets the work within the context of the history of botany. The editors have appended a chronological bibliography of Candolle's publications (pp. 551-579) that improves on Briquet's entry in his Biographies des botanistes 'i Geneve de 1500 a 1931 (1940), which was itself based on Alphonse de Candolle's 1862 list. It is the improved text, of course, that makes this new edition essential to all botanical libraries. The many omissions now re- stored add both gravity and vivacity to a fascinating work. Alphonse de Candolle, for instance, skirted round the delicate sub- ject of religion. His father, a moderate anticlerical Protestant to all public appearances, was not in fact a Christian at all, as is revealed in an account of his skeptical beliefs, charmingly excused as a digression from the subject of Astragalus (pp. 155-157). Inevitably, this chapter was not published in 1862: it shows its author to have been of the school of the late Morton Smith, whose sixtieth birthday was celebrated in a four-volume festschrift with the title Christianity, Judaism and other Greco-Roman cults (Brill, 1975). The younger Candolle also omitted disparaging or critical remarks on Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (p. 171-see entry for Le Guyader under "Notices-History ..."), John Bellenden Ker (p. 321), and several of his father's pupils (pp. 385-390). Augustin-Pyramus de Candolle's judgments are never uncharitable, but they are, quite definitely, judgments, which may repel some modem readers who feel more at ease in an era in which the reluctance to express a conviction is considered to be a sign of enlightened tolerance. Candolle's concise portraits of his contemporaries are character sketches in which salient features illustrate (or at least hint at) general principles in an attenuation of the Theophrastian method. His enthusiasm for the then essentially Swiss "science" of physiognomy seems to have been more philo- sophical than practical, the expression of a general interest in diag- nostic esthetics. At every turn we encounter the classifying mind. This edition does not, alas, reprint the systematic account of the proper employment of time that Alphonse de Candolle published in 1862 with further observations of his own. (There are three divi- sions of life according to the elder Candolle: work, play, and triv- ialities, the object of existence being to reduce or to eliminate the last). The Mimoires et souvenirs, however, are neatly divided into epochs and sections that alternately remind the reader of the chap- ter and verse of the Bible and the genera and species of Linnaeus. One small editorial blemish may be noted: inasmuch as references are made to livre and paragraphe rather than to page, it would have been helpful to have had more informative headings. Those provided are an inadequate guide to consulting the text: the repeti- tion of "Mdmoires et souvenirs" on every even-numbered page is mere ornament, and while the running-heads on odd-numbered pages identify the livres by title (Enfance, Jeunesse, etc.), the edi- tors cite them only by number (I, II, etc.)-and there is no mention whatsoever of the paragraphes. Candolle's five chronological divisions, incidentally, offer a taxonomy of age that should interest students of the climacteric, nurtured on Creighton Gilbert's classic article, "When did a man in the Renaissance grow old?" (1967). For Candolle, the first 20 years represent childhood and adolescence, ages 20-30 youth, 30-38 manhood, 38-57 maturity, and 57 to death is old age. Many people still idly quote such temporal maxims as "Si jeunesse savait; si vieillesse pouvait" but Candolle clearly had a more earnest sense of the passage of time and of what might be called the seasons of life, as is evident from the ease with which his thoughts take such form as this: "Je me mis a l'ouvrage avec une ardeur tout a fait juvenile et, j'ose le dire, avec une pers6v6rance digne d'un autre age" (p. 207). Each of Candolle's ages has its own geographical setting too--Paris, Montpellier, Geneva. Such neat coincidence is attainable only by those who aim at a career. How different is the more serene and expansive view of those for whom life consists of a protracted dawn and an indefinite twilight! As Mrs. Leonard Darwin, daughter-in-law of Charles, observed, "Youth is a horrid period of life but luckily it passes. Happy, com- fortable middle-age is the best-the prime period from 40 to 70." Life as one long Lapland summer night is clearly incompati- ble with the running of a botanical empire-managing living plants, curating pressed specimens, and generating thousands of pages of print. From Candolle's memoirs might be extracted a use- ful breviary for the modern botanical administrator, such as none of his 19th-century peers left behind. (The policy and diplomacy of Asa Gray and the Hookers must be largely reconstructed from their correspondence. They were, after all, probably not readers of La Bruyere, the 17th-century Theophrastus, whose Caracteres have long held a prominent place in the francophone schoolroom.) Worthy objectives that are now travestied and bemeaned by such terms as "outreach" and "mission statement" are here presented in lofty form and inspiring prose. There is not a "Friends" organization anywhere that could not profit by the example of Candolle. Where but in Geneva, and who but he could have mobilized a small army of (largely lady) ama- teurs to copy the essential 1200 of Mocifio's 1500 Mexican botan- ical drawings in a race against time? The challenge came in 1817, when the Spanish botanist was obliged to request the immediate return of his gift to Candolle. More than 120 residents of the city participated, many under the direction of the portrait-painter Frangois-Geddon Reverdin (ancestor of the Olivier of my opening sentence). When Candolle misdirected half-a-dozen drawings for copying, they were copied anyway, such was the distribution of talent and civic spirit. That staunch individualist the art historian Erwin Panofsky ridiculed collaborative effort with the words: "You mean, all pull together-in the wrong direction?" For ten memorable days, all Geneva pulled in the right direction. The well-known but ever enthralling story that is told on pages 341-343 includes a charming account of a later visit from the Irish novelist Maria Edgeworth. When Candolle attempted to direct her attention to the best specimens in his collection of Mociflo copies, she asked instead to see the inferior drawings as exemplifying the public feeling that inspired the undertaking: "'Non, me disait-elle, montrez-moi les moins bons; ce sont ceux qui prouvent que les r6sultats sont dus &amp; l'esprit publique et non &amp; l'amour-propre.'" (For over 150 years, Candolle's copies were the only record of the lost originals. In 1980, Mocifio's collection was rediscovered in Spain; the originals are now in the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation, Pittsburgh.) It is rare to find an author so adept at classification and hier- archical ordering-at the sound management of life-who is at the same time so delightfully discursive as Augustin-Pyramus de Candolle.

Niche construction is "the process whereby organisms, through their metabolism, their activ- ities, and their choices, modify their own and/or each other's nich- es. Niche construction may result in changes in one or more natu- ral selection processes in the external environment of populations. Niche-constructing organisms may alter the natural selection pres- sures of their own populations, of other populations, or of both" (glossary, p. 419). "By transforming biotic and abiotic sources of natural selection in external environments, niche construction gen- erates feedback in evolution on a scale hitherto underestimated- and in a manner that transforms the evolutionary dynamic. It also plays a critical role in ecology, supporting ecosystem engineering and influencing the flow of energy and nutrients through ecosys- tems. ... This book extends evolutionary theory by formally includ- ing niche construction and ecological inheritance as additional evolutionary processes" (from website). With examples from all the kingdoms.

From foreword: Compared to other submerged macrophytes, charo- phytes are affected already by moderate eutrophication. Therefore, they are often used as bioindicators for good water quality. ... This book ... [presents] information about the dis- tribution, morphology, ecology, physiology and molecular biology regarding both the group per se and individual species. An overview of the Baltic Sea as a habitat for charo- phytes is given in a geographic as well as time scale perspec- tive. A determination key for charophytes in the Baltic Sea was developed and tested by the members of the working group. Information regarding the status of investigation and valuable habitats for charophytes is given for the single coun- tries bordering the Baltic Sea. Changes in occurrence and threat factors are described and form the basis for a Red List of charophytes in the Baltic Sea. Finally, synonyms and nomenclature are given for each taxon.

Andes; global connections; summary; biblio.; index. From web- site: The Southern Andes, stretching from the subtropics to the subantarctic, are ideally located for palaeoenvironmental research. Over the broad and continuous latitudinal extent of the cordillera (-24'), vegetation is adjusted to climatic gradi- ents and atmospheric circulation patterns. Opposed to the pre- vailing Southern Westerlies, the Southern Andes are posi- tioned to receive the brunt of the winds, while biota are set to record the shifting of incoming storm systems over time. Sequential, latitudinally-placed, sedimentary deposits con- taining microfossils and macroremains, as archives of past vegetation and climate, make possible the detection of equa- torward and poleward displacement of plant communities and, as a consequence, changes in climatic controls. No ter- restrial setting in the Southern Hemisphere is so unique for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction during and since the last ice age. Twenty radiocarbon-dated fossil pollen and spore records chosen to place emphasis on the last ice age include high-resolution, submillennial data sets that also cover the Holocene, thus providing contrast between present inter- glacial and past glacial ages. From a refined data base, the records constitute the foundation for interpreting factors responsible for vegetation change over &gt;50,000 14C years, glacial-interglacial migration and refugial patterns for a diversity of taxa, and the extent of intrahemispheric and polar hemispheric synchroneity versus asynchroneity.

Re. Kronlid's 2003 doc. diss. in theol., "Ecofeminist ethics holds that a main cause of the environmental crisis is the existence of the so-called twin domination: ... exploitation of nature and oppression of women share the same conceptual and evaluative structure. Consequently, in order to solve the environmental crisis we need to end oppression of women, and vice versa" (back-cover blurb). However, Kronlid's study shows "there are no main differences between ecofeminism and nonfeminist environmental ethics regarding the main standpoints on the five issues [see above]. Rather, the significant differences are found within these main standpoints" (p. 4). "Environmental ethics" is a hot (air) field; there are at least 4 other titles from 2003.

Fide the website: Jacob Bigelow's American Medical Botany [subtitled Being a collection of the native medicinal plants of the United States, containing their botanical history and chemical analy- sis, and properties and uses in medicine, diet and the arts, 3 vols.], with its sixty color-printed plates, is a pioneering sur- vey of the pharmacological use of plants in North America. The science of botany has never entirely lost its original prac- tical and herbal rationale, and Bigelow (1786-1879), first Rumford Professor of the Application of Science to the Useful Arts (1815-27) at Harvard, was nothing if not practi- cal. His every endeavor applied an innovative scientific out- look to human affairs, from his introduction of landscaping to graveyards to create the modem picturesque cemetery, to his books and lectures on technology, a term to which he gave such increased currency that he is often credited with its invention. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, of which he was a founding trustee, is in many ways the institutional embodiment of Bigelow's ideals. Even the production of American Medical Botany prompted certain technological innovations, for Bigelow was obliged to improvise a special process of color printing for the reproduction of his drawings. The text is based on Bigelow's firsthand knowledge, both as a field botanist who gathered herbs throughout much of New England, and as a physician whose famous Discourse on Self- Limited Diseases (Boston, 1835) was to set drugs and the patient in a proper perspective for an entire generation. American Medical Botany thus remains not only a monument of American botanical art and color printing technique, but is an enduring record of New England herbal lore and pharma- cological practice. Fide Welmerskirch's commentary, "Although the word 'technolo- gy' was used as early as the seventeenth century, Bigelow is often given credit with its invention. ... [However,] Bigelow was the first to popularize the word, both through his lectures at Harvard and by its use in the title of his book Elements of Technology (... 1829)."
