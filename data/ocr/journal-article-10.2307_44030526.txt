<plain_text><page sequence="1">Previous criticism of the Irish-American poet Eamon Grennan has focused on his depictions of the natural world. Through a comparison with the French poet Yves Bonnefoy, this essay explores Grennan's concern with the fail- ure of language and highlights the way his poetry reveals the world through notions of silence and absence. "Something Secret and Still": Silence in the Poetry of Eamon Grennan TIMOTHY BAKER Eamon writing the human Grennan attempts or domesticated s to poetry reveal is the most world point often and where read the language as natural an explication gives world.1 At of to the the silence, same intersection and time, his of Eamon the human or domesticated world and the natural world.1 At the same time, his writing attempts to reveal the point where language gives way to silence, and pres- ence to absence. By comparing his work with the criticism and poetry of Yves Bonnefoy, from whom Grennan draws the epigraph for the "New Poems" section of Relations , this essay will show how Grennan s poetry articulates three distinct types of silence: the silence of the nonhuman world, the silence that follows human failure to communicate, and, finally, the silence that occurs when a poem reaches towards that of which it cannot speak. For Grennan, as for Bonnefoy, poetry is revealed to be "what aims at an object - at this being right before us, in its absolute, or at being itself, at the presence of the world, in its unity - even when, in point of fact, no text can tell of them" (Bonnefoy, "Lifting" 798) In many of his poems, Grennan highlights the tension between poetry's capacity to reveal the world and the inability of language to fully convey the nature of the Mosaic 42/4 0027-1 276-07/0450 18$02.00©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">46 Mosaic 42/4 (December 2009) world as it is. Poetic attention permits the individual detail to point towards some- thing that is inherently inexpressible. Grennan demonstrates that no poetic represen- tation of the world can fully capture it: there is always an emptiness or absence beyond the borders of language and observation. In the first section of "Two Climbing," for instance, Grennan describes an expedition with his son on which they observe a small frog. This mundane moment, he writes, "brims / with the whole story: such touched fullness / and, plain as day, the emptiness at last" (As J/9). The frog, "speckled rust and raw olive," is complete in itself, yet the poet's encounter with it reveals not only "the whole story" (9) of the world, but emptiness and silence. Each encounter with the world stands for the world as a whole, but at the same time is incomplete. How a poetry that explicates and explores the observable world can be used to reveal emptiness, and what that emptiness might be, is the central theme of Grennan's work. His fidelity to the physical world becomes a way to address the lim- its of poetry: rather than suggesting that poetry allows the reader to transcend the material world, he shows how attention to physical detail can be used to address the limits of poetry and language. Grennan repeatedly portrays the natural world in terms of both presence and absence. "Aubade," from Still Life with Waterfall , describes a morning walk on which Grennan compares a gull's overhead flight, "in the right place at the right time," with the older tracks of an otter. What unites these two distinct moments, and three dis- tinct creatures, is the tension between what is "there" and what has already been lost: Thereness is all: that burn of chance, quickened breath of appetite adding up to all that this world offers - glitter and shadow, pang of absence, the way this day keeps coming on: we meet; we disappear. (56) Presence, thereness , is not a function of time or observation, nor is absence simply a loss or a way of marking the past. Presence and absence exist in a continually shifting dialectic: the poem reflects on both the physical reality of the world and its transitory nature. Absence is itself defined in terms of presence and thereness: as he writes in the recent poem "Nervous System," it is "a something out there , not dead stuff / blank against the window. An opening, or almost" ( Out 28). "Aubade" begins in a particular time and place, where the narrator is "Walking Renvyle strand at sun-up" (56), but quickly moves to suggest that the importance of this moment and place lies in the way</page><page sequence="3">Timothy Baker 47 it reveals the relation between the given moment and its disappearance. Silence, empti- ness , and absence are recurrent terms in Grennan s poetry, but they do not necessarily indicate a lack. Instead, it is only through these absences that the "thereness" of the world can be approached. The world is known as much through the way "we disap- pear" as through the encounters between the human observer and the physical world. Many of Grennan's most notable poems consist primarily of detailed observa- tions of the physical world. Each collection is filled with poems in which the poet goes for a walk, in the woods or on the coast, even on a city street, and records what he sees. These poems have been praised for their attention to biological detail, yet in all of them Grennan also documents the difficulty of completely representing in language what exists outside the realm of the human. In "Four Deer" from What Light There Is, for instance, Grennan first describes an encounter with deer in the woods in an anthropomorphic light: About them hangs an air of such domestic sense, the comfortable hush of folk at home with one another, a familiar something I sense in spite of the great gulf of strangeness we must look over at each other. (56) The deer are at once familiar and strange: even as their interactions superficially resemble those of humans, an inescapable gulf between the human and nonhuman remains. As he writes in "Journey," the nonhuman world is one of "speechless peace": it is "not our world / yet we've come into it" (So 25). In this poem, Grennan does not argue for a firm divide between the world of the poet and the natural or nonhuman world he observes, but neither does he posit a complete and expressible understand- ing between the two. This tension is encapsulated in, but also resolved by, the deer's prevailing silence. When the deer are startled by the poet s presence, their reaction is bracketed in silence: All of a sudden, I've come too close. Moving as one mind they spring in silent waves [ . . . ] When silence settles over us again and they bow down to browse, the sound of grass being lipped, bitten, meets me across the space between us. (56-57) The "one mind" of the deer can only be known through the deer s movement away from the poet, while the sound of grass being "lipped" is like a language the poet cannot understand. The poets sense of coming "too close" arises not only from his physical</page><page sequence="4">48 Mosaic 42/4 (December 2009) proximity, but also from his recognition of a desire to understand the lives of the deer in human terms. To describe the deer as "an Indian file of famished natives" or "sea- soned / castaways in search of home ports" (56) is to reduce their essential otherness. The deer in this poem have their own complete life that the observer cannot enter. Instead, what can be shared between the human and the deer is silence. Only in silence can the deer be seen as they truly are. Grennan clarifies this idea in a recent poem about another encounter with deer, "Going Gone." Here the deer represent "the way things rush from us into the shade / of our unknowing." As they flee from the poet he perceives "A going [...] that leaves little (but that little / a burning) after it" ( Out 12). The world is known through its dis- appearance: absence becomes a way, perhaps a painful one, in which to know the world and understand how little of it can be articulated in language. Silence becomes the only way to communicate with the natural world: it offers a resolution, and even an understanding, outside of language. The world is revealed as "something / speech- less, simply known " ( Relations 222). If the world is knowable - an "if" Grennan con- tinually raises - it is only knowable through silence and absence. A number of critics have claimed that Grennan's emphasis on pre-linguistic or intuitive forms of knowledge offers a transcendent vision of the world. Deborah Fleming, in a widely quoted study, claims that the immediate observation of the nat- ural world in Grennan's poetry leads naturally towards metaphysics: "through images from everyday experience and the natural world we transcend the visible and tempo- ral. The images may come from the ordinary, perhaps even the mundane, but if we are alert [...] they will lead us to the spiritual" (148-49). As Gordon Grant persua- sively argues, however, the strength of Grennan's poetry comes not from its possible metaphysics, but from its focus on the actual: "Rather than taking himself (or us) up and away from the physical, the ordinary, the commonplace, and the domestic into the spiritual or real of timeless 'truth,' the frequent epiphanic moments of Grennan's poems move us down into these spaces of experience, and, by doing so, revalue [ . . . ] the experience of the material" (52). Following Grant, it is possible to see throughout Grennan's work an emphasis on what is immanent and knowable but remains unsayable. Silence, Grennan writes, "denies nothing, finds no meanings, / only the facts themselves" ( Matter 40). The knowledge revealed in poetry is based on a precise experience of the world that can only be known as and through silence. In his poems focusing on the nonhuman world, Grennan offers a unique exactitude: he focuses not on the nonhuman as such, but on the shared world of the particular frog, or particular deer. In this focus on indi- vidual experience of the world, he articulates a view of nature where the human and</page><page sequence="5">Timothy Baker 49 nonhuman can share silence because they exist in the same space, but the natural world remains irreducibly separate from the human. Silence marks both what the human and the nonhuman have in common and the impossibility of mutual understanding. As Jacques Derrida comments in a dis- cussion of Celan, this notion of impossibility is common to all poetry: "There is in every poetic text [. . .] an inaccessible secret to which no proof will ever be adequate" ( Sovereignties 164). Grennan's poetry is marked by a singular focus on the inaccessi- ble; his poems continually reference a world that can, perhaps, be known, but that can never be explained or completely enunciated. He frequently alludes to Hölderlin and Celan, among others, placing his work within a continental tradition as much as an Irish or American one. His approach to the world is notably different from that of nature-oriented American poets such as Gary Snyder or Wendell Berry. Like Grennan, Snyder argues for a poetic tradition - one that, for him, largely draws on Buddhist teachings - that combines "emptiness" and "actuality" (Snyder 115). At the same time, for Snyder poetry is intrinsically connected to the "wild": it goes beyond language to "give human beings a window into the nonhuman" (92). Poetry exists to express what cannot be expressed any other way. This perspective can certainly be seen in Grennan's work, but he also raises the possibility that poetry cannot completely fulfil these demands. The deer, frog, and gull in the poems above remain distant. Instead, poetic attention, a commitment to recording what can be known, offers a space where absence and silence can be revealed. While for Snyder "art (also read 'language') [is] a matter of discovering the grain of things, of uncovering the measured chaos that structures the natural world" (168), for Grennan poetry can only point towards such a discovery or uncovering. It is only in silence that the relation between the human and the nonhu- man can be known. If Grennan's the divide poetry, between then the an natural attempt and to the document human worlds the divide occupies between a central the world position of one in Grennan's poetry, then an attempt to document the divide between the world of one human and that of another is also at play throughout his work. In these poems, silence is as much what is shared between humans, and the mark of what divides them, as it is in his poems of the natural world. As Fleming has demonstrated, volumes such a s As If It Matters are strongly autobiographical, focusing on the break-up of Grennan's mar- riage and his subsequent separation from his children (147). In "Two Gathering," the long poem that closes the volume, Grennan writes of collecting mussels with his daugh- ter: "In our common sphere of silence we're aware / of one another, working together" (84). While the structure and setting of the poem are similar to "Two Climbing," here the</page><page sequence="6">50 Mosaic 42/4 (December 2009) focus is not on the natural world, but on the relation between two people. The experi- ence of the world can be shared; the recognition of its abundance unites two people who have been torn apart. His daughter exclaims at the number of mussels they've found, her voice a sudden surprise in that wide silence we stand in, rejoicing - as she always does and now I must - at the breathless plenitude of the world, this wondrous abundance offering itself up to us as if we were masters of the garden, parts of the plenary sphere and circle, our bodies belonging to the earth, the air, the water, fellow creatures to the secret creatures we gather and will tomorrow kill for our dinner. (83-84) Silence itself becomes the signifier of the natural environment: it is at once the com- mon sphere of the world - "that wide silence we stand in" - and the mark of the non- human, "the breathless plenitude of the world." Even at this moment of apparent unity with the world, however, a divide remains; as much as Grennan and his daugh- ter are fellow creatures with the mussels, the former will nevertheless kill the latter. The silent, abundant world opens up a system of relations, but true companionship can only be found between humans. In "Station," midway through As IfItMattersy Grennan uses the same motifs of plen- itude and silence in an urban setting, as he describes leaving his son at a train station: We are saying goodbye on the platform. In silence the huge train waits, crowding the station with aftermath and longing and all we've never said to one another. (41) As the train departs, "In a sudden rush of bodies and announcements," Grennan imagines his son's solitary journey: Later, On his own in the city, he'll enter the underground and cross the river, going home to his mother's house: I imagine that white face carried along in the dark glass, shining</page><page sequence="7">Timothy Baker 51 through shadows that fill the window and fall away again before we're even able to name them. (42) "Station" updates the poem "Traveller," from What Light There is, in which Grennan leaves his son at a bus station, and "for all there is to say / we are deaf to one another" (28). Like the beach in "Two Gathering," the bus and train terminals in these poems are simultaneously silent and teeming with life; these places are more important for the way they showcase human interaction than for themselves. While silence in "Four Deer" signifies the absence of shared language, in Grennans domestic poems it also becomes the basic environment of human relationships. The silence of a beach and a train station stands in for those things that have not been said. Silence is not the oppo- site of language, but a central part of it: it speaks that which cannot be spoken. Grennans son is inarticulate - "feathered syllables / fidgeting in his throat" (As If 42) - while his daughter's words are "unanswered, / hanging between us as we turn to go" (87). Silence must serve to communicate when other forms of communication are impossible. Silence is language's other half: it is a central aspect of human communi- cation that remains when language fails. This silence is also depicted in the context of romantic relationships. In "Man Making the Bed," from Still Life with Waterfall the man of the title is able to reflect on his lover only in absence and silence: Psalm after psalm into a dead sea of silence: they invent their own enormous, endangered day. [ . . . ] He is alone here, making the bed up, stopped between the solidity of things as they are and the huge white peace of the sheet-sail flapping from his hands for a matter of seconds and subsiding, spread flat, its corners pointed towards where she leans - half-dressed in memory, one soft stroke of daylight streaking her spine - to draw taut the sheet he's holding the other side of. (16) Whatever "fullness of time and truth" (16) lies between the man and his lover, it can only be experienced in silence. At the same time, however, the very silence noted at the beginning of the poem calls into question the rest of what follows. As Ben Howard notes, the woman in the poem "is at once emphatically present and subject to disso- lution" (152). In this instance, the silence is so complete that it is unclear if the other</page><page sequence="8">52 Mosaic 42/4 (December 2009) potential speaker is even present. Grennan's poems of love and family, whether erotic or domestic, continually focus on what cannot be said. The silences in these poems are often comfortable, but are nevertheless overpowering: they always exist to invite the unsaid or unsayable. , In his poems concerning the nonhuman world, Grennan uses silence to signify the possibility of a non-linguistic, and often inter-species, understanding. Silence is what emerges when the human and nonhuman encounter each other: it is a form of communication of its own, even as it still signals a gulf between two realms of expe- rience. In his poems concerning human interaction, silence can also be seen as a replacement of language. In "Station," for instance, the silence of the station serves in part to express what the father and son cannot say to each other. At the same time, at the end of the poem the poet's thoughts are based only in his imagination: he is cut off from his son's actual life, and can only envision it from a physical, as well as intel- lectual, distance. Silence is what is left behind when language fails. Grennan's language refusal and poetry of a transcendent cannot do, has poetic led to vision, a widespread as seen in reading his emphasis of his on work what as language and poetry cannot do, has led to a widespread reading of his work as fundamentally concerned with the minutiae of human (and nonhuman) experience. Grant calls him "an ethnographer of experience" (62), while Mary Fitzgerald-Hoyt claims that Grennan has been deservedly "praised for his ability to illuminate the quo- tidian, to invest the commonplace with radiance" (121). As the passages above show, it is not only, as David Young states, "Grennan's love of color and detail [. . . that] sus- tains him" (92), but also his ability to reach towards the inarticulable aspects of lived experience that cements his reputation. Grennan's poetry, as many critics have noted, balances detailed observations of what can be seen and discussed with equally detailed observations of what cannot. None of the above-quoted critics, however, fully explores the interplay between silence and textuality. Grennan's poetry is concerned not only with the relationship between silence and communication, but also with the way silence itself can be seen to lie at the centre of poetry. It is this last type of silence to which Bonnefoy draws attention in both his poetry and his criticism. As Sarah Lawall and Mary Ann Caws point out, Bonnefoy is torn between a desire to "'name' the objects of this earth" and a realization of the "inade- quacy of language" (193). Yet many of Bonnefoy's critics, like Grennan's, overly focus their readings on his depiction of the material world. Jean Starobinski, for instance, writes that Bonnefoy's work is "entirely turned towards the external object, which is what matters for it" (184). Such assertions elide the importance of silence and mys- tery in Bonnefoy's poetry and the way in which, throughout, the external world is able</page><page sequence="9">Timothy Baker 53 to become present only in relation to absence, and language can be known only in relation to silence. The centrality of silence in Bonnefoy 's poetry can be seen in his first collection, On the Motion and Immobility of Douvey where he writes in an untitled poem, What shall I seize but what escapes, What shall I see but what fades, What shall I desire but what dies, But what speaks and tears itself? Speech close to me [Parole proche de moi]&gt; What shall I seek but your silence. ( Early 67) Here, silence is posited as what remains, not only of what is observed but also of what is spoken. Where the subject ends is where silence takes over. Speech, or parole, is nec- essarily and closely connected to silence. Parole , Bonnefoy writes elsewhere, "is not simply a way of using language"; it also "has more truth than language," precisely by questioning language's limits ( Shakespeare 266). The world moves towards emptiness and absence, but the silence that remains is the place of poetry. Poetry, as he makes clear through his work, emerges from silence: it offers a bridge between the external, nonhuman world and the linguistic one. Bonnefoy 's concept of poetry is far more ele- vated than Grennan's, but what unites the two poets is the way they use the relation- ship between language and silence to signify the relationship between the interior world of the human and the larger, nonhuman world. In an essay on Shakespeare - on whom both poets have written extensively - Bonnefoy articulates the poetic ambition to write of "the real object, in its separation from ourselves": "The essential thing we must bear in mind is the demand it makes on language - to be open to this most remote kind of object: the being of things, their metaphysical thereness , their pressence [sic] before us, most remote from verbaliza- tion, and receive them in their pure existence, their stubborn atomicity, and their opaque silence" ( Act 19). Even as Bonnefoy adopts a markedly Heideggerian vocabu- lary - elsewhere he writes of "the dwelling place of poetry" (49) - he also uniquely highlights silence as a bearer of presence. Like Grennan, he posits a "thereness" of the world that can be known, but not verbalized. For Bonnefoy, poetry comes from a momentary experience of unity between the observer and the observed: it is the struggle to articulate that which resists articulation and to reconstitute a "thereness" that is already lost. Poetry is a "memory" and a "questioning of existence" ( Lure xv): poetry must emerge from silence because silence, like memory, is what remains when</page><page sequence="10">54 Mosaic 42/4 (December 2009) experience has ended. This theory of poetry can shed light on poems such as "Four Deer" and "Going Gone" that portray the deer in terms of their absence. Poetry is a way to reconstitute experience. Critics have often ignored the extent to which Grennan's poems are written at a distance from the experience at hand: he does not depict his son, in "Station," or lover, in "Man Making the Bed," directly, but as he imagines them in their absence. Fidelity to the world comes from a combination of experience and withdrawal, but that tension can only be explored in terms of silence. This tension is equally apparent throughout Bonnefoy 's poetry, where the "there- ness" of the world can be known only in relation to absence. This can be seen in a poem such as "Let This World Endure" from The Curved Planks: Let this world endure, Let absence and word Fuse forever In simple things. (35) The endurance of the world - that is, the persistence of experience that is made avail- able through poetic memory - can be seen through the combination of silence and language. Poetry provides access to forgotten things and experiences. The "simple things" of Bonnefoy 's poetry - as evidenced in his focus on elemental symbols of fire and sea and on the observed world - become a way to express what lies beyond lan- guage. This difficult relationship is, for Bonnefoy, the key to understanding poetry. He writes, for instance, of the difficulty of poetic expression: "The immediate does not exist for the writer, even if he is passionately attentive to what has no name, no defin- able image. Intuitively, he knows that other quality of truth which is offered by the flowering branch of a tree or a stone cascading down a ravine. But to want to recre- ate in words the infinite density or the pure emptiness of these things is from the out- set a mad hope which poetry, drawing its life from such things, must abandon page after page" ( Lure 169). Poetry is a "mad hope": it is a continual attempt to express the immediate, physical world, the world of trees and stones, that always fails but also always begins again. As with Grennan's depiction of the world as "simply known," Bonnefoy gestures to a type of truth or knowledge, one that cannot be simply expressed in poetry, but that it is nevertheless the primary task of the poet to discover. The immediate world is the source of poetry but can never be fully articulated. Both poets are stylistically innovative and use a wide variety of forms to illustrate the relationship between language, silence, and the world. In recent years, both have moved from the relatively simple verse forms that dominate their early work into long poems and, most intriguingly, prose poems that highlight this central relationship.</page><page sequence="11">Timothy Baker 55 The three prose poems of Bonnefoy's "Throwing Stones," the work that closes The Curved Planks , each employ a fragmentary narrative that ends abruptly. In the first two poems of the sequence, Bonnefoy uses a traditional narrative form to question the limits of poetic representation: all that a text can do is to juxtapose presence and absence. Sunrise gives way to the night, "empty of stars" (175), while the sky is described purely as "absence" (177). These poems are apocalyptic and unresolved, and they depict the experience of the empty night. Yet this is not a despairing vision of the world: "Throwing Stones," the final poem, ends with the line "But always we raised our eyes from the devastated ground toward other eyes, again with that laugh" (179). The world and language are always defined in relation to absence, but as long as the possibility for communication remains, as can be seen in the non-linguistic forms of the shared gaze and laughter, these absences are not meaningless. Grennan's recent work similarly frames its juxtaposition of observational speci- ficity and ultimate absence in a questioning of poetic form. The Quick of It consists entirely of untitled poems of ten long lines. In one of them, he highlights the differ- ence between naming a thing and knowing it. The poet questions "What disappears when I say the word bird?" as he applies the name "house finch" to the creature in front of him. Human language cannot fully express the immediacy of the nonhuman world. The poem ends not with an epiphany but with a realization of the impossibil- ity of putting epiphanic moments into poetic language: Then a branched robin Fan-batters charcoal wings, and I see before it disappears its burnt-orange Breast, an ember blown to brightness by the cloudy morning, and I almost Feel it as the quick blink of God's one eye, the eureka-brisk surprise given And taken, the echt unmanageable absolute of it in the moment passing. (61) The poet's simple terms, "bird" and "house finch," have little to do with the experience of being, or of seeing, a bird itself. The bird is known only through, and as, the pass- ing moment: its absoluteness is revealed only as it disappears. While elsewhere he writes almost comically of the relation between language and the world - in the poem "Patience," a heron has "wings so fast they're like a long sentence out of Beckett" (9) - in The Quick of It this relation is strained. Just as "house finch" cannot describe a unique bird, so the elevated language of this poem, unusual in Grennan s poetry, points to its own inadequacy. The use of compound words and alliteration, seemingly derived from Hopkins, seems artificial here, as does a phrase like "the echt unman- ageable absolute." The poem laments its own inability to capture the immanent</page><page sequence="12">56 Mosaic 42/4 (December 2009) unique life of the finch and the robin. Like Bonnefoy, Grennan seeks to capture the "other quality of truth" found in "simple things," but finds that poetic form cannot go far enough. The similarity of Bonnefoy 's and Grennan's approaches to the relationship be- tween poetry and the world can clearly be seen in two early poems about the build- ing of a fire, "Fire's Eternity," first published in Yesterday's Empty Kingdom , and "A Gentle Art," from Wildly for Days . Both poems depict a man staring at a fire in silence. In the Bonnefoy poem, which is far more abstract than Grennan's, the man, called Phoenix, watches the fire. How it appears, How it settles in the soul's core And when dawn shows in the windows, how The fire grows still, and sleeps lower than fire. He feeds it with silence. He hopes That each fold of an eternal silence, Sifting down on it like sand, Will aggravate its immortality. (Early 263) The poem can be read both as a straightforward account of a man tending a fire and as a symbolic tale, in which Phoenix is not a man but a figure who will rise from the fire he himself kindles. Even in this latter reading, however, the poem still emphasizes the relation between subjective experience and the external world. The fire's initial importance lies in "how it appears" to the man: it is known through the experience of an external observer. In the final stanza, the poem invites a more metaphysical reading. Silence is both fuel and damper, taking the place of wood and sand. More importantly, silence is used to question individual subjectivity: the poem moves away from individual human experience to a questioning of "immortality." Silence can be used to show what lies beyond the human. As Bonnefoy writes elsewhere, "subjectivity has to be the reality one submits to but also questions" ( Lure xix). While the poem begins as an account of first-hand experience, the introduction of silence allows the poet to question the individual's place in time, and suggests forms of experience that lie beyond the phys- ical and the linguistic. In Grennan's poem, the act of building a fire is at once an act of memory, as the narrator recalls his mother's instructions, and a repudiation of history. The fire, his mother argues, must be started from old newspapers: "All that everyday black and white of / History is the first to go up in smoke." Once the fire is lit, it must be ignored:</page><page sequence="13">Timothy Baker 57 Pretend another interest, but never Let it slip your mind: know its breathing, Its gulps and little gasps, its silence And satisfied whispers, its lapping air. At a certain moment you may be sure (she'd say) Its caught. Then simply leave it be: It's on its own now, leading its mysterious Hungry life, becoming more itself by the minute, Like a child growing up, growing strange. (29) Both poems move from the subjective experience of the human responsible for light- ing it to an account of the fire as at once located in time and offering a perspective on time. The fire is tended in silence and acquires human characteristics, whether the resistance to death in Bonnefoy or the comparison to a child in Grennan. When the fire is left untended, it offers a view of either immortality or human maturation: it is at once closely connected to the human and moving beyond the specifics of a partic- ular time and place. The fire is thus used to question the place of subjective experi- ence, for it is only when the fire is left "on its own" that it becomes most "itself." In both poems the fire is built by a human, and so is tied to subjective experience, but comes through silence to represent a departure from complete subjectivity. For Bonnefoy and Grennan, silence yields a position that is neither purely tran- scendent nor purely objective. The fire is always a real fire, witnessed by a real observer, but at the same time it is used to represent a transition from the subjective experience of a given moment to an externalized perspective on time. In both poems, the fire is defined by time, and ultimately by its death. Both fires will burn out, untended. Fire in these poems is neither only symbol nor only object. It is instead the mark of relation between the poet and that about which he writes. To different degrees, both poems illustrate Jean-Luc Nancy's definition of negative poetry. Nancy defines negative poetry as that which denies "that it may be possible to overcome the distance between us and what moves us (which is of course why it moves us at all)" (4). For both Bonnefoy and Grennan, this negative aspect of poetry is absolutely cen- tral. Poetry depicts the other, the elevated, and the strange, but refuses to place them fully within the realm of subjective experience. Grennan modifies the negativity of Bonnefoy and Nancy: the fire is a way for the poet to remember his mother, and so has an essential positive and subjective component. At the same time, both poets rec- ognize that the essential nature of an object, such as the fire, can only be realized through absence or silence. It is only when the fire is left alone, even to die, that it can be, in some essential and possibly non-linguistic sense, known.</page><page sequence="14">58 Mosaic 42/4 (December 2009) Bonnefoy makes the relationship between negativity and subjectivity clear in an interview printed at the end of In the Shadow's Light. What the interviewer terms Bonnefoy 's "'negative' voice" is, for the poet, the awareness that the presence of the world is withdrawing into the very words that seek to tell of it, and that there is therefore something "unthought of" in one's relation to one- self that feeds this negativity - and this explains the French title of the book [Ce qui fut sans lumière] : it recognizes what has remained an otherness in the I that had spoken. [ . . . ] Poetry is an experience of what goes beyond words: call it the fleeting perception, then the more active remembrance, of a state of indifferentiation, of unity - that state that characterizes reality at the level that our language cannot reach. (162) Poetry both is limited by language and goes beyond language: only by recognizing an otherness and a negativity at the centre of the poem can poetry gesture towards unity between the self and the world. The transition from perception to remembrance is key in Bonnefoy 's account of poetry and is also present in Grennan's poems, such as "A Gentle Art." The "presence of the world" is not knowable in itself, but can only be fleetingly perceived. From that perception, however, comes an awareness of, and even a reconstitution of, the place of human experience. Poetry provides a way to move from representation to presence. Grennan makes a similar point in a discussion of Dickinson, where he highlights "The notion that things halt but only in our imagina- tion for half a second and poetry is an attempt to slow things down a bit and hold on" (Walsh 129). The world, for both poets, pre-exists in a state of unity that the individ- ual observer can only see as fragmented and withdrawn. By engaging with otherness and negativity - both of the world and of the self - and by emphasizing the momen- tary, poetry opens a way of understanding the world. Even as both poets continually emphasize the inadequacy of language, they also argue that it is only language that makes this poetic reconstitution of unity possible. For Bonnefoy, "Reality is dissipated in language, yet language reveals it, indeed estab- lishes it, allows it to be itself and see itself" ( Act 58). A fidelity to language reveals real- ity and the human: it offers an engagement with the world, even as it "fails," in Grennan's term. In interviews and essays, both poets continually draw attention to the importance of sound in their work. Sound goes beyond meaning: it reveals a reality that language, seen as a vehicle for content, cannot encompass. What differentiates poetry from other forms of communication is this ability to approach the world through sound. And yet, as shown above, language and sound are also used to present silence. It is only through language, subjectivity, and human observation that silence, the external, and the nonhuman world can ever be known. This is in some ways an</page><page sequence="15">Timothy Baker 59 irresolvable tension in the work of both poets, but their similarity - and their impor- tance - can be seen in the way they repeatedly engage with such difficult questions. Grennan world most makes explicit the complicated in the poem relationship "Silence" from between Still Life silence, with language, Waterfall and which the world most explicit in the poem "Silence" from Still Life with Waterfall which contains all of the motifs articulated above. The poem begins in the aftermath of a failed relationship, and continues: For what hasn't been done, there is this void, a space filled with mourning in silence, the way an animal or a bird - not knowing what it is - will fill a space its own size and outline in the daily world, and will be every moment all that. "Soul," as we say, may be something like it, a space that has shaped itself to the shape of what's gone and not returning. Let's see: should he test all the doors? Will the locks he's put in place spring open? There is this distilled thing, gin-light, and the glass is ice. That, for the moment, takes care of the words. Now he may sit in silence. He may swallow his tongue. (22) The poem first presents silence between two humans as a sign of failed communica- tion: as in "Station" and "Two Gathering," silence takes the place of things the poem s inhabitants cannot say. Language has already failed here. This desolation is immediately followed by a comparison to a different kind of silence, and a different kind of knowing. An animal or a bird cannot know itself as an "I" in the way that humans arguably can, according to the poem. Yet the animal and the human are not dissimilar: each occupies a space in the world that is first revealed through absence. "Thereness" is all, to be "every moment all that," to be shaped by absence and yet remain. Grennan uses poetic language to deprivilege language, and logocentric forms of knowing as a way of understanding the world. The bird may not know itself in the way a language- using human might, and yet it occupies a very par- ticular space in the world, a space that only it can fill. For Grennan, the human equiv- alent of this presence is, surprisingly, mourning. The recognition of absence becomes</page><page sequence="16">60 Mosaic 42/4 (December 2009) a presence in itself: only by first understanding loss can we understand our place in the world. The poem then abruptly transitions from a discussion of the nonhuman to a dis- cussion of language itself. The man barricades himself against language; silence is now something that must be protected with locks and doors. The poem turns on its final line, however, where silence signals peace and danger. To live alone, in silence, is to know who you are by what you have lost, and at the same time is suffocating. Neither language nor its absence offers any respite. In this poem, Grennan offers a vision of thereness that is, in many ways, as apocalyptic as Bonnefoy's "Throwing Stones" sequence. Language fails, and silence chokes. And yet this silence, as in so many of Grennan's poems, feeds back upon itself and becomes the beginnings of poetry: for Grennan, poetry begins and ends with silence. The relation between silence - even a silence closely akin to death - and poetry in Grennan s work can be understood in relation to Derrida's late lectures collected in The Animal That Therefore I Am. Derrida argues for a move away from logocentric and Heideggerian accounts of poetry, in which language is seen as the essence of poetry. Instead, he points to the relation between the nonhuman and the human, and finally to death itself, as the starting points of poetry. In his final lecture, he writes, "To relate to the thing such as it is in itself - supposing that it were possible - means apprehending it such as it is, such as it would be even if I weren't there. I can die, or simply leave the room; I know that it will be what it is and will remain what it is" (160). This account is strikingly similar to Grennans: recognition of the presence of the world can only come from a recognition that the observer will not always be there. This motif is repeated throughout Grennans poetry: the vanished deer, the departing children, and the failure of language all signify the poet's necessary distance from his subjects. The importance of silence in Grennans work is finally that it opens a way to think of the observed object, person, or animal through the light of absence. For Grennan, absence is, in Derrida's terminology, "something other than a privation" (Animal 48). Instead, absence provides a way for a thinking of poetry that is neither egocentric nor logocentric, but signifies the endurance of the world itself. Throughout Grennans poetry, silence and absence are used as ways to hold onto the world: they illuminate a "thereness" that language itself cannot convey.
