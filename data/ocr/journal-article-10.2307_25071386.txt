<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mill's 'Proof of Utility and the Composition of Causes Fred Wilson ABSTRACT. John Stuart Mill proposed that all policy precepts, be they in the areas of morality or prudence or aesthetics, are all subordinate to the precepts of the Art of Life. The value which he assumes in defining the Art of Life is the Principle of Utility. This principle, being normative rather than fact, can admit of no proof based solely on deductive inference. Yet Mill proposed considerations that he believed capable of rationally per suading one to accept his principle as the basic principle for the Art of Life. This paper aims to evaluate this argu ment. In particular, it tries to show that a crucial step, often thought to be a logical 'howler', is not to be so simply dismissed. It is shown that if one accepts certain theses from Mill's philosophy of science and of social science, concerning the composition of causes, then the crucial step is fully justified. It is also suggested that these theses of Mill's philosophy of science are mistaken. So Mill's 'proof of utility is, after all, unsound, but the reconstruction proposed shows it to be much more plausible and much more philosophically interesting than is often thought. For John Stuart Mill, economics is, unequivocal ly, a science1. It deals with "that portion of the phenomena of society which emanates from the industrial or productive operations of mankind, and from those of their acts through which the distribution of the products of those industrial operations take place, in so far as not affected by force or modified by gift"2. The determining causes in this area are "principally those which act through the desire for wealth" and the fun damental law which functions as an axiom from which the other laws of this science are to be derived as theorems is "the familiar one that a greater gain is to be preferred to a smaller"3. In Fred Wilson, Philosophy Department, University of Toronto. taking this as the fundamental law, the science clearly abstracts from all other human motives4. Nonetheless, the latter do affect human behav iour and interfere, at times, with the unbridled pursuit of wealth5. Thus, the laws of economics hold only conditionally6; they are imperfect and 'gappy'7, and therefore do not yield cate gorical predictions but only descriptions of ten dencies . However, imperfect laws do not, through their imperfection, cease to be laws9. Economics, though an imperfect science, is nonetheless a science. But it is also an art. Mill praises Adam Smith's work: "The most characteristic quality ...is that it invariably associates the principles with their application"10. He proposes that his own Prin ciples of Political Economy treat the subject similarly as both a science and and art.11 The imperfection of the laws means, however, that in applying the science to make policy recom mendations, it is necessary to go beyond that science and take into account other factors that may modify the influence of the motive that defines the science12. "Except on matters of mere detail, there are perhaps no practical ques tions, even among those which approach nearest to the character of purely economical questions, which admit of being decided on economical premises alone"13. The prescriptions of the art depend, however, upon certain assumed ends: A scientific observer or reasoner, merely as such, is not an adviser for practice. His part is only to show that certain consequences follow from certain causes, and that to obtain certain ends, certain means are most effectual. Whether the ends themselves are such as ought to be pursued... it is no part of his business as a cultivator of science to decide, and science alone will never qualify him for that decision.14 Journal of Business Ethics 2 (1983) 135-155. 0167-4544/83/0022-0135S02.10.

The complexity of the phenomena require a constant reference back to the theoretical principles of the science if the provisional rules are to be intelligently applied16, and to the non-economic factors that condition the validity of the laws of economics and therefore of the precepts derived from those laws17. But in any case, the precepts that the art proposes will also depend upon the end that it declares to be desirable. The art proposes to itself an end to be attained, and hands it over to the science. ...Science then lends to Art the proposition (obtained by a series of induc tions or deductions) that the performance of certain actions will attain the end. From these premises Art concludes that the performance of these actions is desirable, and finding it also practicable, converts the theorem into a rule of precept.18 The builder's art assumes that it is desirable to have buildings; the architect's art assumes that it is desirable to have them beautiful or imposing; the physician's art assumes that the cure of disease is desirable19. The art of econo mics may take as the end that it assumes the very same end the pursuit of which it takes to be the determining cause of economic phenome na, to wit, the pursuit of wealth. The science takes the motive to be a fact ; the art assumes that the motive is also worthy, that the end which it aims to achieve is not only desired but desirable, that is, worthy of desire. If we take the art of economics to be defined by assump tion of the worthiness of the pursuit of wealth, then the precepts that this art proposes might be called the precepts o? good business practice.19* However, what the art assumes to be worthy may not be so. The unkind reference to the Americans in the first edition of the Principles of Political Economy was a dramatic condemna tion by Mill of the motive the psychological law of which forms the basic axiom of the science of economics and the assumption of the worthiness of which defines the art: "They have the six points of Chartism, and they have no poverty: and all these advantages do for them is that the life of the whole of one sex is devoted to dollar hunting, and of of the other to the breeding of dollar-hunters"20. However proficient Ameri cans may be in the art of gaining wealth they are deficient in the art of life ! The point is simple: one ought not to sacrifice all other ends to the end of gaining wealth. For example, one ought not to sacrifice health to wealth. This is a judgment about the relative worthiness of cer tain ends, and presupposes a criterion of such worth. That is, the judgment assumes an end less proximate than the ends it judges; and it judges those subordinate ends more or less worthy when their pursuit and attainment contributes more or less to the attainment of the less proxi mate end21. Prudence alone suffices to judge that one ought not to pursue wealth to the ex clusion of all else; that is, enlgithtened self interest requires a balance between the pursuit of wealth and such other things as the preser vation of health. The prcepts of good business practice thus find themselves lined up beside the precepts of hygiene (the art of preserving health22), and the appropriateness of following one or the other of the precepts will be judged by the precepts of prudence. Mill himself does not limit the art of econom ics to the precepts of good business practice. He constantly introduces extra-economic values, and his policy recommendations in the Prin ciples of Political Economy serve these ends as well as the motive of the pursuit of wealth. Among the considerations that he introduces are considerations of justice or fairness. Thus, where the motive of gaining the maximum wealth would demand that one be able to inherit as large a bequest as possible, the motive of justice or fairness demands that the right of inheritance be limited23: "no one person should be permit ted to acquire, by inheritance, more than the amount of a moderate independence"24. If the restriction of the right to inherit were made effectual, "wealth which could no longer be em ployed in over-enriching a few, would either be devoted to objects of public usefulness, or if bestowed on individuals, would be distributed among a larger number"25. In a book on eco nomics, this may well be preaching26, but it is</page><page sequence="3">Mill 's 'Proof of Utility 137 out of place only if the only end that an artful application of the science of economics may assume is the end aimed at by the motive that forms the basic datum of the science. There is, however, no reason why the latter should be so. Just as any artful application of the science of economics must take into account more than just the economic factors, so an artful applica tion of that science may assume a view of man that takes into account more ends than simply the gaining of wealth. Mill, therefore, in pro posing to imitate Adam Smith, not only aims "to combine his [Smith's] practical mode of treating his subject with the increased knowl edge since acquired of its theory" but also "to exhibit the economical phenomena of society in the relation in which they stand to the best social ideas of the present time ... " 27. Mill there fore introduces, where appropriate, considera tions of justice and morality. However, he also introduces values that go deeper even than those of justice and morality, or, at least, morality in the narrow sense. Among the "best social ideas" that Mill considers is the proposed socialist ideal of a communistic society in which all private property is abolished and a command structure instituted that regulates labour and distribution in such a way as to effect as fair and equitable treatment of all as is possible28. Mill first argues that from the view point of science, there is nothing in the laws of sociology or economics that renders it impos sible to achieve such a form of social organiza tion; it is not impractical29. Mill then turns to questions of value. He first argues that if the only alternative to the present very unjust form of society were communism, then the latter would have to be preferred, and "all the dif ficulties, great or small, of Communism would be but dust in the balance"30. It is, however, not the only alternative to the present state of society. For the institution of private property admits of improvement31, e.g., by legislation tending "to favour the diffusion, instead of the concentration of wealth... " 32. To judge the final destination of the institution of property, we must suppose everything rectified, which causes the institution to work in a manner op posed to that equitable principle, of proportion between remuneration and exertion, on which in every vindication of it that will bear the light, it must be grounded.33 Once we take the comparison to be between communism and private property at its best, then we are in a position to judge which is the form of society more worthy of pursuit. Mill here introduces a consideration that goes deeper than mere justice or fairness or equity. He asks whether communism or private property is "consistent with the greatest amount of human liberty and spontaneity"34. He urges that per haps communism is not consistent with this end. "After the means of subsistence are assured", he tells us, "the next in strength of the personal wants of human beings is liberty..."35. But the communistic schemes which he discussed seemed to him to tend to require their members to "re nounce liberty for the sake of equality"36. As we know, Mill's judgment on this matter fluc tuated37. The point for us, however, is that there was a more ultimate end in the Art of Life to which even considerations of justice or moral ity in the narow sense were subordinate. In fact, the Art of Life has three subordinate departments, Morality, Prudence, and Aesthetics: "the Right, the Expedient, and the Beautiful or Noble, in human conduct or works"38. The Art of Life is superior to morality in the narrow sense. Indeed, to call the end that defines the Art of Life a moral end, is to claim too little for it. More appropriately it should be called the 'Religion of Humanity'. The only society in which the Religion of Humanity could be prac tised in an organized form would be the ideal society, the one which automatically protects individual manifestations of will and desire and intellect through the internal conviction in each member of the society that freedom is part of the greatest happiness of the greatest number. The problem with the communist ideal is that it is not clear that it is consistent the ideal socie ty proposed by the Religion of Humanity; that is, it is not clear that communism is consistent with that multiform development of human nature, those manifold unlikenesses, that</page><page sequence="4">138 Fred Wilson diversity of tastes and talents, and variety of intellec tual points of view, which not only form a great part of the interest of human life, but by bringing intel lects into stimulating collision, and presenting to each innumerable notions that he would not have conceived of himself, are the mainspring of mental and moral progression. 9 Through all this Mill presupposes the principle of utility, which proposes that the maximization of the general happiness is the ultimate end. It is this principle that judges the place of justice, morality in the narrow sense, in the Art of Life40; it is this principle that proposes the end that defines the Art of Life. A free society that is slightly inequitable is to be preferred on grounds of utility to one which was more equal but less free. For the former will better promote the end proposed by the principle of utility41. The best form of society would be one in which the end of utility was promoted through each person having the maximization of the general happiness as his own ultimate end. But the per fect society is a goal and not a fact, so the Reli gion of Humanity ? the highest form of the Art of Life ? is a matter of personal attachment to the best principles and practices, a form of indi vidual self-development which is not merely moral but also intellectual and aesthetic. The Religion of Humanity involves the development of ideals of behaviour and feeling (the work, according to Mill, it may be recalled, of the poet), and behind that it involves striving to live in accordance with the ideal of the principle of utility which prescribes such an individual devel opment as a worthy end. The nature of this complex ideal is perhaps best revealed in a long and important passage in 'The Utility of Reli gion': A morality grounded on large and wise views of the good of the whole, neither sacrificing the individual to the aggregate nor the aggregate to the individual, but giving to duty on the one hand and to freedom and spontaneity on the other their proper province, would derive its power in the superior natures from sympathy and benevolence and the passion for ideal excellence: in the inferior, from the same feelings cultivated up to the measure of their capacity, with the superadded force of shame. This exalted morality would not depend for its ascendancy on any hope of reward; but the reward which might be looked for, and the thought of which would be a consolation in suffering, and a support in moments of weakness, would not be a problematical future existence, but the approbation, in this, of those whom we respect, and ideally of all those, dead or living, whom we admire or venerate. For, the thought that our dead parents or friends would have approved our conduct is a scarcely less powerful motive than the knowledge that our living ones do approve it: and the idea that Socrates, or Howard or Wasington, or Antoninus, or Christ, would have sympathized with us, that we are attempting to do our part in the spirit in which they did theirs, has operated on the very best minds, as a strong incentive to act up to their highest feelings and convictions. To call these sentiments by the name morality, exclusively of any other title, is claiming too little for them. They are a real religion ; of which, as of other religions, outward good works (the utmost meaning usually suggested by the word morality) are only a part, and are indeed rather the fruits of the religion than the religion itself. The essence of religion is the strong and earnest direction of the emotions and desires towards an ideal object, recognized as of the highest excellence, and as rightly paramount over all selfish objects of desire. This condition is fulfilled by the Religion of Humanity in as eminent a degree, and in as high a sense, as by the supernatural religions even in their best manifestations, and far more so than in any of their others.42 The Art of Life requires some ultimate stan dard: There must be some standard by which to determine the goodness or badness, absolute and comparative, of ends or objects of desire. And whatever that stan dard is, there can be but one: for if there were several ultimate principles of conduct, the same conduct might be approved by one of those principles and condemned by another; and there would be needed some more general principle as umpire between them.43 For Mill this general principle "to which all rules of practice ought to conform, and the test by which they ought to be tried, is that of con duciveness to the happiness of mankind..."44. This principle justifies the cultivation of charac</page><page sequence="5">Mill's'Proof of Utility 139 ter the committment to which is the Religion of Humanity: I fully agree that this is true: that the cultivation of an ideal nobleness of will and conduct should be to individual human beings an end, to which the specific pursuit either of their own happiness or that of others (except so far as included in that idea) should, in any case of conflict, give way. But I hold that the very question, what constitutes this elevation of charac ter, is itself to be decided by reference to happiness as the standard. The character itself should be, to the individual, a paramount end, simply because the exis tence of this ideal nobleness of character, or of a near approach to it, in any abundance, would go further than all things else towards making human life hap py-45. We cannot here pursue all of Mill's ideas on nobleness of character and that best form of life that is prescribed by the Religion of Humani ty46. To be sure, those ideas are of the greatest importance to ethics and to all its branches, from medical to business ethics, and to the issue of the role of morality in the good life. But the theme that I wish to pursue is the much more technical, and from the viewpoint of ideals of conduct perhaps less interesting47, issue of the foundation of the whole edifice: how is the basic principle, that of utility, to be justified? Mill insists that no fundamental principle be accepted uncritically. Moral doctrines are no more to be received without evidence, nor to be sifted less carefully, than any other doctrines. An appeal lies, as on all other sub jects, from a received opinion, however generally entertained, to the decisions of cultivated reason. The weakness of human intellect, and all the other infirmities of our nature, are considered to inter fere as much with the rectitude of our judgments on morality, as on any other of our concerns; and changes as great are anticipated in our opinions on that subject, as on every other, both from the pro gress of intelligence, from more authentic and en larged experience, and from alterations in the con dition of the human race, requiring altered rules of conduct. 8 But if the principle of utility is not to be accept ed uncritically, how is it to be defended? What sorts of reasons can persuade one rationally to accept it? Now, this was a serious problem for John Stuart Mill. He was an empiricist49, and, so far as moral judgments go, a subjectivist.50 This sub jectivism precluded any appeal to intuition in justifying any claim that some principle might be the fundamental moral principle51, the basic principle of all action.52 His empiricism required him to appeal to the "faculties which judge of fact", that is, knowledge obtained by perception and introspection only.53 This would not serve to prove the claim he wished to put forward. For, 'ought' never follows from 'is'.54 That something is desired does not entail that it is desirable in the sense of 'worthy of desire', 'ought to be desired'.55 If then, it is asserted that there is a comprehensive formula, including all things which are in themselves good, and that whatever else is good is not so as an end, but as a mean, the formula may be accepted or rejected, but is not a subject of what is commonly un derstood by proof. On the other hand, "considerations may be pre sented capable of determining the intellect either to give or withhold its assent to the doc trine, and this is equivalent to proof"56. It is these considerations which are found in Chapter IV ('Of What Sort Of Proof the Principle of Utility Is Susceptible') of 'Utilitarianism' and which I propose to examine.57 We may divide the 'proof' into two steps. The first step is designed to establish (insofar as it can be established) that "each person's happi ness is a good to that person". The second step concludes from this that "the general happiness is a good to the aggregate of all persons"58. The pattern of the first step is well-known to stu dents of elementary logic texts. This is the step which involves the famous equivocation, or sup posed equivocation, between the two senses of 'desirable'. The second step is almost as well known. It is supposed to involve the fallacy of composition. But, of course, a necessary con dition for accusing the 'proof' of committing these fallacies in the supposition that the 'proof' is a deductive argument. Mill's own statements</page><page sequence="6">140 Fred Wilson about the 'proof ' are sufficient for the rejection of this supposition. The first step begins with the seen-visible example. If something is seen then it is visible. This principle is analytically true, since 'visible' means by definition 'can be seen', and 'what is, is possible'. It follows that if something is seen by me then it is visible to me. Hence, some thing's being seen by me is sufficient to prove to me that it is visible to me. Conversely, it is also a necessary condition. However, its being a necessary condition is not a matter of logic, in the strict sense of 'logic', in the way in which its being a sufficient condition is a matter of logic alone. Its being a necessary condition depends upon the principle of empiricism that questions of fact can, in the end, be settled only by a "direct appeal to the faculties which judge of fact, namely, our senses, and our internal con sciousness"59. By this principle, if something is not seen then there has been no 'direct appeal' and it has not been proved that it is visible. To be sure, it may be visible, but that does not prove to me that it is.60 Thus, if something is not seen by me then it has not been proved to me to be visible to me; that is, upon transposing, if something has been proved to me to be visible to me then it has been seen by me. In other words, something's being seen by me is neces sary to prove to me that it is visible to me. In a like manner, I apprehend, the sole evidence it is possible to produce that any thing is desirable is that people do actually desire it. If the end which the utilitarian doctrine proposes to itself were not, in theory and in practice, acknowledged to be an end, nothing could ever convince any person that it was so.61 Mill it not saying that something's being desired is sufficient to prove that it is desirable. All he asserts is that something's being desired is necessary to prove it is desirable. The point of a moral principle is to guide action.62 Action is in fact determined by desire.63 Hence, if one were never to desire x, actions to achieve x would never be performed, and a principle to guide actions, that if an action achieves x then it ought to be done, would, given the facts, fail to guide actions; in other words, given the facts, assent to the principle would not be forth coming.64 We must be psychologically realistic about the moral principles we advocate.65 Thus, something's being desired by me is necessary to prove to me that it is desirable to me, that it is a good to me. Also, happiness is in fact desired by each. Thus, with respect to each, that person's happi ness is an end which satisfies the necessary con dition that must be fulfilled if it is to be proved to that person that a given end is desirable to him. "Happiness has made out its title as one of the ends of conduct, and consequently one of the criteria of morality"66. This is the first step of Mill's proof. The crucial premiss in this step, the one that justifies the move from is to ought, is the prin ciple that we must be psychologically realistic. This principle is simply the principle that if something ought to be desired then it can be desired, or, in other words, that if it is desirable in the normative sense then it is desirable in the non-normative or descriptive sense. If something is in fact desired, then it has shown itself to be desirable in the non-normative sense, which then, by this crucial principle, means in turn that it satisfies the necessary condition that must be satisfied if it is to be desirable in the normative sense. The crucial principle that per mits this move from is to ought is, in fact, none other than the principle that ought implies can. And indeed, in another paper I have shown that if we assume the principle that ought implies can and its converse that must implies ought, then Mill's proof that happiness is the criterion of morality is formally valid.67 But this is only the first step in Mill's argu ment. It is only with the second step that Mill concludes that the promotion of the general happiness is "the ultimate principle of Teleolo gy"68. In my earlier paper I did not discuss this further step. Yet it is crucial to Mill's proof. It is the aim of the present paper to evaluate the soundness of this second step. Here, then, is how Mill presents it: No reason can be given why the general happiness is desirable, except that each person, so far as he be</page><page sequence="7">Mill's 'Proof of Utility 141 lieves it to be attainable, desires his own happiness. This, however, being a fact, we have not only all the proof which the case admits of, but all that it is possible to require, that happiness is a good, that each person's happiness is a good to that person, and the general happiness, therefore, a good to the aggre gate of all persons.69 Mill establishes to his satisfaction that happi ness is a good. This leads to the claim that the happiness of each is a good to that person. This in turn is held to justify the claim that the general happiness is a good to the aggregate of all persons. The move to this last claim is the second step of his argument. Broad has com mented on this second step: If Psychological Hedonism be true, each man's hap piness is desired by someone, viz., himself. Therefore, each man's happiness is desirable. But the happiness of humanity is a whole composed of the happinesses of each man and of nothing else. Mill concludes that the happiness of humanity is desirable. But the only legitimate conclusion from these premisses is that the happiness of humanity is a whole composed of a set of parts each of which is desirable. For, on Mill's definition of 'desirable', this would mean that the happiness of humanity is desired by someone. And it does not follow from the fact that every part of this is desired by someone that the whole itself is desired by anyone.70 Now, if what has been said above is correct then Mill does not define 'desirable' by 'desired'. Rather, Mill's point was that it was reasonable to speak of the desirable only where one could also speak of the desired, if that is correct, and if (as Broad believes) Mill holds Psychological Hedonism to be true,71 then it would be reason able to speak only of happiness as desirable. This being so, Broad's comment remains relevant. He argues that Mill cannot conclude that the general happiness is desirable because he has not estab lished that the general happiness is desired by anyone. But note that Mill does not claim to establish in his second step that the general happiness is a good to any individual person. He is very careful to say that the general happiness is a good to the aggregate of all persons. Broad may have hit upon a weakness of Mill's position but he has now shown that the second step of the argument as Mill understood it is fallacious. And that Mill did indeed understand it in the way I have just suggested rather in the way in which Broad takes it can be readily seen from an exegetical remark Mill made in one of his letters: As to the sentence you quote from my "Utilitarian ism"; when I said that the general happiness is a good to the aggregate of all persons I did not mean that every human being's happiness is a good to every other human being; though I think in a good state of society and education it would be so. I merely meant in this particular sentence to argue that since A's happiness is a good, B's a good, C's a good, etc., the sum of all these good's must be a good.72 Mill here explicitly asserts that he does not want to claim that the general happiness is a good to any individual, is desirable to any particular person. That situation would hold only in the best of situations, but not always. On the other hand, the conclusion he does want to draw is supposed to hold whether the state of society is the best or not. In short, Mill clearly denies that what he wrote is susceptible to Broad's criticism. This, however, poses the problem of what was in fact meant by Mill in the second step of his argument. By 'the general happiness' he clearly meant the sum of the individual happinesses. He argues that this sum is a good, specifically, a good to the aggregate of all persons. Given the first step of his argument, he can draw this con clusion if he believes that the general happiness is desired by the aggregate. If the general happi ness is desired by the aggregate then Mill could argue that it was desirable to the aggregate. We will have understood Mill's argument, then, if we can understand how he could move from (A) "Each person desires his own happiness" to (B) "The aggregate of all persons desires the general happiness". What I propose to do is to show how Mill moves from (A) to (B).73 Before doing this, however, I want to strength en out the case for the above interpretation of Mill's proof by considering the parallel proof of the principle of utility that we find in Bentham. In fact Bentham's proof as it were complements that of Mill. Where we had to conjecture a plau</page><page sequence="8">142 Fred Wilson sible interpretation in the case of Mill, e.g., that Mill argues from the desired to the desirable in the case of the aggregate of all persons, or that Mill defines the desire of the aggregate to be the sum of the desires of the persons in the aggre gate, we find that Bentham explicitly makes the moves that we conjectured that Mill was making. Conversely, where Mill explicitly defines the general happiness as the sum of individual hap pinesses Bentham fails to be explicit and it is with respect to him that we must conjecture. Given that the 'proofs' in each are of the same general pattern we can use each to supplement and add strength to our interpretation of the other. It is clear that Bentham conforms directly with the pattern we have discovered in John Stuart Mill; that he offers almost precisely the same sort of 'proof' of the principle of utility as does the younger Mill. The 'proof' appears right at the beginning of the Principles of Morals and Legislation. That by itself is important. It indi cates that the 'general happiness' principle is ap plied by Bentham primarily to social institu tions, such as those of the law and of public morality, as we saw Mill did. Bentham points out, in the first place, that "Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure"74. This is under stood as a law of nature.75 In the case of indi vidual persons, they seek their own maximum happiness. Those who defend utility accept this point; those who attack utility neglect it: (a) Admitting any other principle than the prin ciple of utility to be a right principle, a prin ciple which it is right for a man to pursue ad mitting (what is not true) that the word right can have a meaning without reference to utility, let him say whether there is any such thing as a motive that a man can have to pursue the dictates of it: if there is, let him say what that motive is, and how it is to be distinguished from those which enforce the dictates of utili ty: if not, then lastly let him say what it is this other principle can be good for?76 This corresponds exactly to what we called the first step of Mill's 'proof'. That the second step is also found in Bentham is equally clear. (?) By utility is meant that property in any object, whereby it tends to produce benefit, advantage, pleasure, good, or happiness, (all this in the present case amounts to the same thing)... to the party whose interest is considered: if that party be the community in general, then the happiness of the community: if a particular in dividual, then the happiness of the individual.77 And, he tells us, (7) The community is a fictitious body, composed of the individual persons who are considered as constituting as it were its members. The interest of the community then is, what? ? the sum of the interests of the several members who com pose it.78 With respect to the community in general, Mill's aggregate of all men, (?) It is in vain to talk of the interest of the com munity without understanding what is the in terest of the individual. A thing is said to pro mote the interest, or be for the interest, of an individual, when it tends to add to the sum total of his pleasures: or, what comes to the same thing, to diminish the sum total of his pains.79 Having understood the motivations of individ uals, we turn to the case of the community in general, and apply the desired-desirable infer ence in that case also: (e) An action then may be said to be conformable to the principle of utility... (meaning with respect to the community at large) when the tendency it has to augment the happiness of the community is greater than the tendency to diminish it.80 Several comments are relevant. One. (e) fol lows the discussion of community interest. That shows that Bentham meant it to apply to this case as well as the case of the individual's in terest. I.e., Bentham explicitly makes the desired desirable inference for both the individual and the aggregate. As we saw, John Stuart Mill did not explicitly do this, though if our interpreta tion of his 'proof' is correct, then such a move is an essential step. That Bentham explicitly makes</page><page sequence="9">Mill's 'Proof of Utility 143 this connection when he offers his version of the same "proof" lends support to the case we have made for the interpretation of Mill. Two. That Mill and Bentham agree with respect to the second step of the 'proof' is clear. In (7) Bent ham explicitly says that the interest of the com munity is to be found by summing the interests of individuals. This corresponds to Mill's general happiness as the sum of individual happinesses precisely as desire to desired, act to object. Bentham does not explicitly define the happi ness of the community; it is perfectly clear from the context, since (7) follows directly on (/?), that he would define it as the sum of the happi nesses of the members of the community. That Mill so defines the general happiness in his dis cussion of the 'proof' lends support to the inter pretation now being offered of Bentham. Mill does not define the general interest explicitly, where Bentham does. The interpretation of Mill's account of the general interest suggested above was that he would define it precisely as we now find Bentham defining it. That supports the suggested interpretation of Mill. Three. Bentham deduces the factual claim about the community in general, about the aggregate of all men, that it seeks the general interest, direct ly from the claim about individuals seeking their own interest, their own happiness. In (5) he makes clear that we need the law about individ uals in order obtain the law about the communi ty in general. In (e) which directly follows (?), he makes clear that the law about individuals is all that is needed to derive the law about the aggregate; that is the force of the 'then' of the first sentence of (e). It would seem, then, that we have provided a reasonable interpretation of Mill's proof pro vided that we can understand how he could move from (A) "Each person desires his own happiness" to (B) "The aggregate of all persons desires the general happiness". It is to the task of showing how Mill makes this move that I now turn. The general happiness is the sum of individual happinesses81. So, too, the aggregate of all per sons can only be the sum of these individuals. The crucial word is 'sum'. It is multiply ambi guous. What I propose to do is to show how Mill uses the word. This will suffice to show how he believes he can move from (A) to (B). But a clear understanding of the several concepts which Mill gathers under 'sum' will also suffice to show that the inference is in fact fallacious. The route that we must take is circuitous. It begins with Newtonian mechanics. Consider a system which consists of only two bodies, where nothing outside interferes. Such a system is a closed two-body system. The masses, (relative) positions, and velocities of the two bodies form a complete set of relevant variables. Let a state of the system be the values of all the relevant variables in the system at any one time. Newton discovered for such systems laws that enabled one to deduce the values of any variable at any time given the state of the system at any one time. Such a law can be called a process law.82 The process law for a closed system is found by solving a set of ordinary differential equations, one for each body in the system. These equa tions have the product of the mass of the object and its accelerations (i.e., the second derivative of the position) on one side of the equality. On the other side is some function of the masses, velocities, etc., of the other bodies. This func tion is called the force function for the system.83 Thus, in case the force is gravitational, we have mi x a\ ~ G(mi x m2ld\, 2) for a two-body sys tem, where m\ and m2 are the two masses, d\,2 is the distance from body 1 to body 2 and G is the universal constant of gravitation. There will be a similar equation for the second body. Their joint solution will yield the process law for the system (up to the constants of integration). The equation relating the force function to the product of the mass and the acceleration is itself a law. Call it the force law (for body 1). The process law for the system, though deterministic, is hard to interpret as a causal law, one about causes and effects. Nor so the force laws for the two bodies. The product of mass and accelera tion can easily be regarded as an effect brought about by the causal activity of a force whose mode of operation is described by the force function. To so interpret the force law would, of course, be anthropomorphic, and for that reason the interpretation would be one which was no part of physics.84 But many have so</page><page sequence="10">144 Fred Wilson interpreted the law, not the least among them being Newton himself.85 And Mill, too, so inter preted the law. Or, at least, he so interpreted it at certain crucial points.86 At others he was quite clear that nothing anthropomorphic need be involved in such laws as these.87 In short, Mill was ambivalent. The relevant point is that the anthropomorphic interpretation is what made possible the fallacious inference from (A) to (B). But to see that we must look at another feature of Newtonian mechanics. We have looked only at two-body systems. There are systems with three, four, ...n bodies. There is a special law of Newtonian mechanics which enables one to deduce the process law for an n body system from the process law for a two body system. Such a law has been called a com position law.88 Consider only the case of a three body system. For each body there will be a force law. Given these force laws we can derive the process law. The composition law enables us to derive the force laws for the three-body system and therefore its process law from force laws for two-body systems. The deduction goes as follows.89 Conceptually divide the three-body system into all possible (in this case, three) two body systems. Take the force laws for each of these two-body systems. The force acting on the body in the three-body system is the vector sum of the forces which would act on the body (1) according to the force laws for the two-body systems and (2) were the bodies to be in closed two-body systems (rather than in a three-body system). And the acceleration of the body is the vector sum of the accelerations the body would have under conditions (1) and (2). This yields the force law for the three-body system. Now for a series of comments. One. The conclusion of the deduction is a law for a three-body system. One premiss is the law for a two-body system. The conclusion contains factual information not contained in that premiss. The other premiss is the composition law. If the deduction is to be valid, so that the conclusion contains no factual information not already contained implicitly in the premisses, then the composition law must be a factual statement. We must not let its mathematical expression ('vector addition') mislead us about this.90 Two. The idea of a composition law may be generalized. Thus, the laws about the behaviour of people in large groups might be deducible from the laws of behaviour in small groups given a composition law. But there is no reason why the composition law must in these other cases take the form of a vector addition. Nor need the simpler system be found merely by a geometrical division of the more complex sys tem, as in the case of Newtonian mechanics.91 Three. The notion of 'sum' in Newtonian mechanics is technical. It does not mean 'and'. Nor does it mean 'plus' in the arithmetical sense. The former is clear. The latter becomes evident also when it is realized that vector addition in volves the idea of direction as well as quantity. But the possibility of fallacious verbal bridges is obvious.92 Four. The division of the three-body system into two-body systems is conceptual only. In fact there are no closed two-body systems in this case. Hence, the force laws for the two-body system do not apply; what applies are the force laws for the three-body system. The laws for the two-body system serve merely as premisses for the deduction of the three-body laws. It follows that the forces in the conceptually arrived at two-body systems are only there conceptually and not really; the only real force which is acting is the vector sum of these, that is, the force which occurs in the three-body system.93 The above remarks about the composition law of Newtonian mechanics in no way involve the anthropomorphic interpretation of the force laws. Let us now see what happens when this interpretation is introduced.94 Consider a body in a three-body system. This body will have a certain acceleration. This acceleration will be the effect of a certain force. In order to interpret this force anthropomorphically, it will have to be located in bodies. The candidates are, ob viously, the other two bodies in the system. And how will the force be apportioned between them? ? clearly, each will contribute just that portion which it would contribute if it were in only a two-body system. The total cause (force) is the sum of causes which operate independent ly of each other. Similarly, the total effect (the acceleration in the three-body system) is the</page><page sequence="11">Mill's 'Proof of Utility 14 5 sum of the effects of the independently operat ing causes. The notion of partial forces as really operating in the way in which the total force operates does not make sense, as we saw above. Too, we noted the problems with 'sum'. The relevant notion is that of 'vector sum' but the idea o? independent ly operating forces blurs this notion into that of the merely logical 'and'. On the other hand, once one begins to regard the system anthropo morphically the idea of independently operating partial forces and therefore also the blur on 'sum' is virtually inescapable.95 I believe that Mill interpreted the composition law of Newtonian mechanics in this anthropo morphic manner. Now, if we happen to know what would be the effect of each cause when acting separately from the other, we are often able to arrive deductively, or a priori, at a correct prediction of what will arise from their con junct agency. (Note the anthropomorphic 'agency' associated with talk about 'causes'; these causes act 'sepa rately' or 'conjunctively'; and the deduction is held to be wholly a priori, requiring no addi tional factual premiss.) To render this possible, it is only necessary that the same law which expresses the effect of each cause acting by itself shall also correctly express the part due to that cause of the effect which follows from the two together. This condition is realised in the extensive and important class of phenomena com monly called mechanical, namely, the phenomena of the communication of motion (or of pressure, which is tendency to motion) from one body to another. In this important class of cases of causation, one cause never, properly speaking, defeats or frustrates another; both have their full effect. If a body is propelled into two directions by two forces, one tending to drive it to the north and the other to the east, it is caused to move in a given time exactly as far in both directions as the two forces would separately have carried it and is left precisely where it would have arrived if it had been acted upon first by one of the two forces, and afterwards by the other. This law of nature is called, in dynamics, the principle of Composition of Forces: and, in imitation of that well-chosen expres sion, I shall give the name of the Composition of Causes to the principle which is exemplified in all cases in which the joint effect of several causes is identical with the sum of their separate effects.96 Or, again, The general idea of the Composition of Causes has been seen to be, that though two or more laws inter fere with one another, and apparently frustrate or modify one another's operation, yet in reality all are fulfilled, the collective effect being the exact sum of the effects of the causes taken separately.97 Note the confusion here between a variable (such as a force) and a law about those variables; it is only variables which interact, not laws; the laws, rather, describe (and explain) the interac tion. Note also the thoroughly anthropomorphic overtones to the whole discussion ('frustration'); indeed, the confusion between a force and a law about force is itself anthropomorphic, involving as it does the idea that the force 'contains' with in it the state which, according to the law, it will bring about, in just the way in which a desire 'contains' within it the future state which it will bring about.98 Note, finally, the totally un critical use of the word 'sum'. This blur on 'sum' is important, because it is this which lends plau sibility to the claim that the deduction is wholly a priori, that the composition law is not a factu al truth. For, from 'p' and 'q' it is possible to deduce without further factual premisses the conjunction (!) 'p and q\ The confusion about 'sum' enables one to confuse this inference with that of the vector addition of the composition law of Newtonian mechanics. Turn now to sociology and its laws. The socio logical variables are the group concepts, both the statistical and the institutional. The laws of sociology describe (and explain) the interaction of these variables with each other (and, un doubtedly, with individual variables also). Sociology can be reducedi to psychology just in case all the concepts of sociology can be de fined in terms of concepts which refer to the properties of individuals in the groups and the (social) relations among these individuals.99 The thesis that sociology can be reducedi to psy chology can be justified in terms of an empiri cist meaning criterion. One is not acquainted</page><page sequence="12">146 Fred Wilson with the Law (the institution), only with judges passing sentence, legislators enacting laws, and so on, whence if talk about the institution is to be empirically meaningful the words which refer to the institution must be defined in terms of the words which refer to the activities of those who are judges, legislators, etc., and the expectations, values, etc., of those who interact with these individuals. If reduction! is possible then the laws of sociology are simply laws about people in large groups; and specifically, there are no properties which people have in large groups which cannot be definitionally related to proper ties which people have in small groups: there are no emergent characteristics or things.100 The thesis that sociology can be reduced2 to psychology is the thesis that the laws of sociolo gy can be deduced from those of psychology, that the laws for large groups can be deduced from the laws for small groups. From what has been said it is clear that such a deduction will require a composition law. It is, therefore, a fac tual thesis. It cannot be settled by appeal to an empiricist meaning criterion. Hence, reduc tion! does not entail reduction2. But a belief in the truth of reduction2 must not mislead us into holding that its truth is a priori. Mill holds that both reduction! and reduc tion are true. Reduction! is justified in terms of the empiricist meaning criterion. From this he believes that he can infer the truth of reduc tion2. That belief is false, the inference falla cious. The laws of the phenomena of society are, and can be, nothing but the laws of the actions and passions of human beings united together in the social state. Men, however, in a state of society are still men; their actions and passions are obedient to the laws of indi vidual human nature. Men are not, when brought together, converted into another kind of substance, with different properties; as hydrogen and oxygen are different from water... .101 We here see Mill infering from the non-existence of emergent entities,102 from the truth of the thesis that reduction! is possible, to the truth of the thesis that reduction2 is possible. What, one might reasonably ask, would lead him to such a belief? Clearly, he would be led to such a belief if he held that a composition law was not really a law, but a matter of a priori deduc tion. Mill, we saw, did indeed confusedly hold such a view. And it was indeed this view which misled him in the sociology-psychology case. Immediately following the above passage we find that Human beings in society have no properties but those which are derived from, and may be resolved into, the laws of the nature of individual man. In social phe nomena the Composition of Causes is the universal law.103 The confusion between reduction! and reduc tion is one between reducing concepts and reducing laws. Mill's earlier confusion of laws and concepts (variables) now enables him to confuse the two kinds of reduction. The anthro pomorphic treatment of forces in mechanics re appears in this context, forces being replaced by motivations, the replacement sanctioned by the fact that human behaviour is par excellence sub ject to anthropomorphic analysis.104 Since social causes are merely 'sums' of psychological causes, the laws, or effects, will be 'sums' also. It should not be inferred that an additive composition rule is impossible, or, what is the same, it should not be inferred that relations can never be ignored. The point is that whether or not they can be ignored in any given case is a matter of fact. That is, in general they cannot be ignored. And the point is that Mill's inference is meant to hold in general. Since it does not, his proof is invalid. For example, a composition rule that is addi tive in the arithmetical sense has been proposed for certain areas of psychology. Already this is different from Mill's case, since the 'sum' of arithmetic is different from the 'and', the mere conjunction, that Mill is thinking of when he analyzes the idea of a composition law. Be that as it may, however, in certain aspects of motor behaviour,105 it has been possible to describe certain simple stimuli Si, S2, ...which evoke corresponding simple responses R\, R2, ... . The following rule is propsed: When (complex) stim ulus Sx = S? + Sj + + Sn is presented then it</page><page sequence="13">Mill's'Proof of Utility 147 evokes the (complex) response Rx =R? + Rj + -- + Rn .106 A system that satisfies this condition is said to be 'linear'.107 Whether or not a system is linear is a matter of fact. ...all ...systems are linear only within limits. Conse quently, the question becomes: within what limits and under what conditions is the system linear? ...this question can be answered specifically only for inputs [stimuli] and other conditions which are tested experimentally. In practice, this means that linearity or its limits will be determined in a finite number of experiments sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the experimenter.108 Mill, if you wish, assumes a priori that linearity holds for all systems; his error is that of ignoring the factual conditions that limit the validity of additive composition rules. That Mill's rule does not hold in general can be seen with the old example of a pet dog that responds to the stimulus of his master holding food by approaching his master, and that responds to the stimulus of his master holding a whip by running away. Now produce the following stimulus by adding the two mentioned ones to each other: the master is presented to the dog holding food and holding a whip. If Mill were correct, then the dog would respond by approaching his master and running away. Clear ly, this is absurd. One must take into account not only the stimulus events in the narrow sense but also the relations among them and to other factors that are or are not present in the environ ment. Mill in effect ignores these relations that are in fact relevant. Indeed, one can say that Mill's inference amounts to assuming a priori that relations are causally irrelevant, that so far as concerns the causal order relations do not exist. The same point can be made with examples drawn from other areas. Economics is one. In macro-economics it is often useful in aggrega tion problems to assume an additive composi tion rule. The real difficulties that often arise when such a rule is used109 show that its applic ability, and the limits of its applicability, are matters of fact, rather than something that can be determined a priori. What conditions the applicability of the rule is, of course, various institutional factors. In certain institutional con texts, the rule works; in others it doesn't. Mill in effect assumes a priori that it is always applic able. And that is to say that he assumes that institutional factors are irrelevant, or, in other words, that so far as concerns the causal expla nation of social phenomena, social relations do not exist. If one is clear about the notion of composi tion law in Newtonian mechanics one will not make the fallacious inference from reduction! to reduction2. It is tempting to offer the follow ing socio-psychological explanation of Mill's erroneous reasoning, or, at least, his obvious readiness to uncritically accept it. If the laws of sociology reduce2 in so direct a fashion to the laws of individual behaviour, then the pos sibility of social reform is that much easier. In order to reform society it is necessary to change it. Such change can be made by interfering in the system and will occur in accordance with the laws of sociology, if the laws of sociology reduce2 readily to those of psychology then the task of reform can be carried out simply by altering the behaviour patterns, the motives, of the various individuals, completely ignoring in stitutional factors. For institutional behaviour is merely the sum of the behaviour of individuals. To make the behaviour of groups, i.e., institu tional behaviour, merely the sum of individual behaviours is to in effect ignore the social rela tions among individuals. This is to ignore crucial variables in the sociological laws. It is as if New ton had ignored the spatial relations between objects when he discussed the laws for n-body systems and the composition law by which these laws are obtained. John Stuart Mill here in herits the social atomism of his father and of the classical economists. Pressure from these values of the British radical tradition might plausibly account for Mill's error. His radical liberalism unconsciously leads him to the fallacious infer ence from reduction! to reduction2 .no We are now ready to look at the move from (A) to (B). In order to show what is involved it will be necessary to spell out in more detail what I believe to be involved both in (A) and (B). Consider first (A): "Each person desires his own happiness". It is necessary to realize that</page><page sequence="14">148 Fred Wilson there are two relations which obtain between a person's desires and his own happiness. There is, first, the intrinsic directedness of desires, that feature which Brentano referred to as their intentionality. Desires intend certain states of affairs. Thus, my desire to smoke a cigarette is a mental state having as its intentional object the state of affairs of my smoking a cigarette. There is, second, the causal relations in which these desires stand to other facts. Specifically, desires are causally efficacious in bringing about the state of affairs which is their intentional ob ject.111 Thus, my desire to smoke a cigarette, this mental state, is a causal factor relevant to its coming to be that I actually do smoke a cigarette. Desires are not, of course, the only causally rele vant factors. This means that the point can be more accurately stated by saying that desires have the causal function of bringing about the state of affairs which is their intentional ob ject.112 Now, among our desires are those which have as their intentional object our own happi ness. The causal function of these desires is to bring about our own happiness. (Not all desires, according to Mill, have a person's own happiness as their intentional ob ject.113 Bentham errs in believing this.114 One can come to have miserly desires, or desires to act altruistically.115 These desires also have the causal function of bringing about the state of affairs they intend. But they also have the causal function of bringing about and maintaining the person in a state of happiness.116 They do this by virtue of the happiness which becomes asso ciated with the bringing about of the object of the desire. Thus, altruistic actions can be ac counted for within the generally hedonistic framework.) Now consider (B): "The aggregate of all persons desires the general happiness". The phrase 'desires the general happiness' is here to be predicated of the composite which is the aggregate of all persons; it is to be predicated of the group as a whole, collectively rather than distributively. This predicate is true of the group if and only if each person desires his own happi ness. That is how the predicate is defined. But the question must be asked at this point why this predicate is defined to be directed at one object rather than another. This question did not arise in the case of the desires of a single person. For it is an intrinsic feature of desires that they be directed at an object; it is not something that is true by definition.117 But in the case of the desire of the group that we are considering, what the object is is a matter of definition, simply because the term referring to that property of the group is in fact, for John Stuart Mill, one which is defined: this is simply to say that for Mill reduction! holds. Why, then, define it as having the general happiness as its object rather than, say, the general unhappiness? or the well-being of the Aryan race? One can begin to answer this, I believe, if one remembers the other relation which the desire of each person stood to its object: causal. Mill defines the desire of the group to have as its object the general happiness because he believes the desire of the group, as he defines it, to have the causal function of bringing about the general happiness of the group. If the functional relation of the desire of the group to the general happi ness is the same as the functional relation of the desire of the individual to the individual's own happiness, then it would be reasonable and non arbitrary to so define the desire of the group that it has the general happiness as its object in the same way as the individual's desire has the individual's own happiness as its intrinsic object. If the functional relation between the desire of the aggregate and the general happiness holds, then it is reasonable to define the desire of the aggregate as having the general happiness as its object. What I now propose to argue is that, given Mill's (mistaken) beliefs about reduction, it will appear to follow deductively from (A) and the definition of the group desire that the causal function of this group property will be to bring about the general happiness. We just saw that if the group desire has this function then its defini tion is reasonable. If I am correct, then given (A) and the definition it will appear to follow that this functional relation holds. Thus, it will appear to be the case that given (A) and the definition of the group desire, then the defini tion is reasonable. Given (A), it will appear that the definition is self-justifying. But further:</page><page sequence="15">Mill's'Proof of Utility 149 given the truth of (A) and the definition of the group desire, it follows deductively that the ag gregate does indeed have that property. Thus, if I am right, given (A), it will follow trivially (by definition) but not arbitrarily (because the defi nition will be self-justifying) that the group will have a desire which has as its object the general happiness, that, in other words, "the aggregate of all persons desires the general happiness". Given (A), (B) follows deductively. In order to establish this it suffices to argue that Mill believes he can infer deductively from (A) and his definitions that the required func tional relation holds; that, in other words, Mill believes it follows deductively from (A) and his definitions that the general happiness is in fact the causal effect of the desire of the aggregate. This belief is simply a special case of the belief that reduction^ follows deductively from reduc tion i. Among the forces which determine the behav iour of an individual are his desires. Each indi vidual desires his own happiness. Among the effects of these forces (desires) are the happi nesses of each individual (to the extent to which they are in fact happy: but however much they are happy, that much is the result of their desire for their own happiness). Consider now all the people in a society. They form the aggregate of all persons. The desires of the people in this ag gregate are the operative causes. Since reduc tion! holds, the desire of the aggregate is simply the sum of the desires of the individuals. Since the Composition of Causes holds, the effects of this composite cause will simply be the sum of the effects of the partial causes. Thus, the effect of the desire of the aggregate, that which it will bring about, will be the general happiness. But it is a mere 'summation' and therefore an a priori deduction. Thus, (B) is a trivial and a priori con sequence of (A). I believe that this exhibits the logic of Mill's second step in his proof of utility, if I am right, we also see where it is fallacious. It is fallacious because given (A) and the definitions of the group concepts it does not follow that the func tional relation holds. Indeed, it is very probably false that it holds. It does not seem likely that each person acting for his own happiness has the social effect of bringing about just the amount of happiness each would bring about if acting in isolation. For, it is necessary to take into ac count the relations people enter into in groups. These are among the relevant variables just as much as the desires of each individual. Failure to take these into account vitiates the claim Mill makes about what will bring about the general happiness. Mill's 'proof' is thus ultimately a failure. He does not justify so organizing society as to achieve the general happiness. Still, one can con tinue to maintain the value judgement that it ought to be so organized. Mill, however, concludes with (B) and there fore with his belief that the general happiness is a good to the aggregate of all men. Thus, the criterion for the morality of institutions, in cluding the institution of moral behaviour on the part of individuals, is the general happiness. Mill also believes, as we have seen, that the best means for society to achieve the general happi ness is for it to bring people to the state where they are so motivated that the general happiness (the happiness of all) becomes the happiness of each. In fact, that is the goal of the Religion of Humanity. It is one thing to show that Mill's defence of this ideal is unsound. It is quite another to show that one ought not to adopt it as an ideal. The latter does not follow from the former. It is thus possible to continue to accept Mill's ideal while recognizing that he has not proved it, and even, perhaps, that it admits of no proof. (The latter would, in fact, seem to be a natural consequence of Mill's subjectivism.) But at this point two questions may be asked. The first is whether it is plausible to suppose that it is an effective means for society to use to achieve its end of the general happiness to educate people that they are so motivated that the general happiness becomes the happiness of each. And the second is whether people can be so motivated. The first question can perhaps be best answer ed by answering the question about a particular person concerning what will best insure that his desires are not frustrated. Here we are interested only in the possibility that the actions of others might lead to the frustration of his desires, if</page><page sequence="16">150 Fred Wilson their actions have consequences which are in compatible with his then he will be liable to frustration. On the other hand, if he so acts that his action has consequences compatible with the consequences of the actions of others then the likelihood that he will be frustrated by what they do is minimal. Action flows from desire. The others in fact desire happiness and therefore what brings them happiness. Hence, in order to minimize the likelihood that he will fail to achieve his own happiness he ought to so act that others achieve their happiness. In other words, he will minimize the likelihood of frustration just in case in desiring his own happiness he desires the hap piness of all. In short, the happiness of all is a means to his own happiness. The same argument will apply to each person.118 An example will perhaps make the point more perspicuous. Suppose there are two people, x and y, and two desserts, a dish of ice-cream and a piece of chocolate cake. Suppose y desires the chocolate cake. If x also desires the cake then he is liable to frustration. On the other hand, if x desires the ice-cream then he is not liable to frustration. The second alternative therefore provides the best opportunity for x's achieving his own happiness. That being so, it would be reasonable for x to desire it over the first. It would, in other words, be the most reasonable for x to desire the happiness of all.119 The causal claim that the best means for society to achieve its end of the general happi ness is the institution of individual morality is at least plausible. This claim may be restated to say that people are less likely to be frustrated if they act sympathetically than if they act either selfishly or agressively. When it is put this way, it is not hard to discover that Mill in fact held this claim to be true. At the end of Chapter III of 'Utilitarianism' just prior to the 'proof' Mill has a sustained discussion whether people can be motivated to be moral, to adhere to the Prin ciple of Utility. And he makes two points. The first is that, given the fact that men live in socie ties, it is necessary to take others into account, to be cooperative, if one is to be happy oneself. ...society between human beings, except in the rela tion of master and slave, is manifestly impossible on any other footing than that the interests of all are to be consulted. Society between equals can only exist on the understanding that the interests of all are to be regarded equally. And since, in all states of civili zation, every person except an absolute monarch has equals, everyone is obliged [given the facts] to live on these terms with somebody...120. The second is that these facts themselves serve to so mould human character so strongly that, independently of any conscious deliberations on the part of the invidual, he comes to have motives, and therefore actions, which are sym pathetic and cooperative. Any condition... which is essential to a state of socie ty, becomes more and more an inseparable part of every person's conception of the state of things which he is born into, and which is the destiny as a human being... . [Sympathetic and cooperative behaviour, and therefore sympathetic and cooperative motiva tion, with respect to at least some others, is such an essential condition.] In this way, people grown up unable to conceive as possible to them a state of total disregard of other people's interests. They are under a necessity of conceiving themselves as at least ab staining from all grosser injuries, and (if only for their own protection) living in a state of constant protest against them. They are also familiar with the fact of cooperating with others, and proposing to themselves a collective, not an individual, interest as the aim (at least for the time being) of their actions. So long as they are cooperating, their ends are identified with those of others; there is at least a temporary feeling that the interests of others are their own feelings.121 These points make clear that Mill held individual morality to be a good social institution. They also make clear where one can find a 'natural' basis to establish an internal sanction for follow ing the Principle of Utility.122 But most unequiv ocally we find Mill's view on this stated directly after the 'proof' we have just examined. Nor, of course, is this surprising: if the interpretation I have offered is correct, and the comments which Mill makes in the quoted letter121a taken serious ly, then this is precisely where one would expect to find such a comment. ...through the association thus formed, it may be felt a good in itself, and desired as such with as great in tensity as any other good, and with this difference</page><page sequence="17">Mill's 'Proof of Utility 151 between it and the love of money, of power, or of fame ? that all of these may, and often do, render the individual noxious to the other members of socie ty to which he belongs, whereas there is nothing which makes him so much a blessing to them as the cultivation of the disinterested love of virtue. And consequently the utilitarian standard while it toler ates and approves those other acquired desires, up to the point beyond which they would be more injurious to the general happiness than promotive of it, enjoins and requires the cultivation of the love of virtue up to the greatest strength possible, as being above all things important to the general happiness.123 This quotation also supplies the answer to the second question raised above, whether people can be motivated to act on the basis of the Prin ciple of Utility. The answer is affirmative. Social living quite unconsciously moulds people to behave at times sympathetically. Conscious control can develop these naturally sympathetic motives into the disinterested love of virtue. The relevant psychological laws are those of associa tion. Pleasure must become associated with vir tuous actions. Then those actions will come to be performed for their own sakes. Virtue will come to be a part of happiness.124 The principles of associationist psychology establish also that happiness is the only criterion of morality. Mill's reasoning establishes only that something's being desired is a necessary con dition for it to be desirable. It will be sufficient only if it is the only thing which is desired.124a Given the axioms of associationism, the only prime motivator is pleasure; all the rest is learn ing, association. Only happiness is desired for its own sake: other things desired for their own sakes are but parts of happiness, are things which have, by virtue of certain associations, come to give pleasure to the individual.125 Much of what Mill says on these subjects is both valuable and true. But his inference from (A) to (B) is fallacious. However, to reject this inference is not to reject the values which he thought himself able to justify. It is possible to adopt those values and deny that they can be given any sort of justification, even of the weak kind Mill attempted.126 I do not think they can be justified. They still remain values worth living for. Notes 1 Cf.

Broad, Five Types of Ethical Theory (Rout ledge and Kegan Paul, London, 1930), p. 184. 71 At this point of the discussion, the issue whether Mill is or is not a Psychological Hedonist does not mat ter. We may assume with Broad that he is. But in fact he is not. Cf. M. Mandelbaum's excellent 'On Interpreting Mill's Utilitarianism', Journal of the History of Philos ophy 6 (1968), 35-46. 72 This extract is reprinted in Schneewind, p. 339. 73 Broad's error (besides his belief that Mill defines 'desirable' as 'desired') is to suppose that 'desired' means 'desired by someone' so that it is not possible to speak of things as 'desired by a group (aggregate)'. To be sure, the former notion is basic, the latter defined in terms of it. But just as one can speak (as Broad readily admits) of 'the general happiness' so one can speak of 'the general desire', i.e., of what is 'desired by the aggregate of all persons'. 74 Bentham, Principles of Morals and Legislation, Ch. I, sec. I. 75 Cf. ibid., Ch. IV, Ch. V, and the notes appended to them. 76 Ibid., Ch. 1, sec. XIV, No. 10. 77 Ibid., Ch. I, sec. III. 78 Ibid., Ch. I, sec. IV. 79 Aid., Ch. I, sec. V. 80 Ibid., Ch. I, sec. VI. 81 This interpretation of Mill shows clearly that he was completely justified in his assertion that the so-called Principle of Justice or Impartiality is a mere corollary of the Principle of Utility as he understood it. That first of judicial virtues, impartiality, is an obligation of justice, partly for the reason just mentioned as being a necessary condition of the fulfillment of the other obligations of jus tice [which Mill holds ? correctly I believe ? can be justified on the basis of the Principle of Utility], But this is not the only source of the exalted rank, among human obligations, of those maxims of equality and impartiality, which, both in popular estimation and in that of the most enlightened, are included among the precepts of justice... this great moral duty rests upon a still deeper foundation, being a direct emanation from the first principle of morals, and not a mere logical corollary from secondary or derivative doctrines [such as that which states we ought to "do to each according to his desserts"]. It is involved in the very meaning of Utility, or the Greatest-happiness principle. That principle is a mere form of words without rational signification, unless one person's happiness, supposed equal in degree (with the proper allowance made for kind), is counted exactly as much as another's. These conditions being supplied, Bentham's dictum, 'Everybody to count for one, nobody for more than one', might be written under the principle of utility as an explanatory commentary. ('Utilitarianism', Ch. V, Schneewind, pp. 335? 336.) The general happiness is the sum of individual happiness es, and it is this sum which is desirable. The fact that it is the mere sum, with no weighting of one individual over another, guarantees that impartiality follows from the Principle of Utility. Mill's 'proof may not succeed in justifying the Prin ciple of Utility as Mill understands it. It may succeed, if it succeeds in anything, only in justifying the maximiza tion of happiness irrespective of whether individuals are treated impartially or partially. In that case Mill had a false belief about how the Principle of Utility as he understood it might be justified. But it is not fair to define the Principle of Utility so that it does not include the Principle of Impartiality, and then go on to accuse Mill of having a false belief about Impartiality being en tailed by the Principle of Utility. Yet this is precisely what Frankena, op. cit., pp. 33?34, does. Surely we can grant to Mill the right to declare what he intends by the Principle of Utility. 82 Cf. G.

Conversely, the idea of a vicious or immoral action has pain associated with it; these 'internal sanctions' serve the function of causing the person to desist from the action and to supress the idea of it. Cf. Mill's long footnote to James Mill's Anal ysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind, in Schnee wind, pp. 259?274; and Mandelbaum, op. cit. 117 This is reconciled with his associationism by virtue of the fact that he holds that ideas which result from association are not merely the sum of the associated ideas. In this area the composition of causes is not the rule; rather, the mode of causation is rather the 'chemi cal'. Thus, resulting ideas cannot be defined in terms of the ideas from which they arise by association. Cf.

In exploring the historical paths leading to contempor ary socialism, he constructs a theory based on today's historical process of accumulation and utilization of class divisions as a means of control and possible exploitation. Starting with the class formed by administrators of coercion (ideologically called the 'state' and thus a class of rulers), Nowak attempts to show how this body expands to eventually absorb ownership and ideological functions and become an all-powerful class of rulers owners-priests, capable of controlling social behaviour through coercion, production, and indoctrination.
