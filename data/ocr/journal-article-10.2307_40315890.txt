<plain_text><page sequence="1">PRE-AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY IN SOVIET THEORY AND METHOD* JOHN EMIL HOWE ABSTRACT In the USSR the study of human society from its inception to the formation of the state is governed "by the theory and method of "primi- tive history," influencing the approach of in- dividual scientists, the system of training and the organization of research. American archaeologists studying the circumpolar re- gion, who are professionally interested in Soviet research, need to be aware of its premises. Soviet anthropological thinking about Palaeolithic and recent hunter-gatherers is intrinsically interesting, while its in- ternal disputes are informative. A recent symposium on "preagri cultural society" that brought together several of the most innova- tive Soviet "historians of primitive culture" provided the opportunity to present their ideas in the relevant intellectual context. INTRODUCTION In recent years the foundations of the anthropological sciences have been shaken by debate set off by the data explosion, tremen- dous growth in the number of anthropologists and prehistorians and of contacts between them across international and cultural boundaries, and especially, the acquisition by the former objects of research of the status of critics and independent investigators. In the Soviet Union, too, long-held concepts have been called into question. During the period of constraints on theoretical disagreement that developed during the 1930s and did not ease until the 1950s, vast amounts of data accumu- lated while theory and method were refined abroad, eliminating the advantage that Soviet theory enjoyed in the early 1930s. Now the need for re- evaluation is acutely felt and basic propositions of theory and method are involved. The gap between fact and theory opened by the data explosion is especially glaring in respect to "pre-production" societies of *The writer of this paper feels very fortu- nate to have made the acquaintance of sev- eral of the authors of the essays considered in this article during visits to the USSR in 1972, under a Fulbright Office of Education Dissertation Fellowship, at which time he dis- cussed some of the theoretical issues dealt with in them. It is hoped that this paper will help in some small way to repay the time and unfailing kindness of his Soviet col- leagues . hunter-gatherers and fish harvesters. Yet it is in this type of society that we must search for clues on the beginnings of human history, including the origins and oldest forms of human society. This is why analysis of the socio-economic relations and institutions of hunter-gatherers and fisherfolk occupies an important place in recent Soviet research and debate . The collection I have chosen as the vehicle for my report, Hunters, Gatherers, Fishermen: Problems of Socio -economic Relations in Pre- agricultural Society (Okhnotniki-Sobirateli- Rybolovy in bibliography) , was a collaborative effort of ethnographers, archaeologists, and a linguist, organized by the general ethnography group of the Institute of Ethnography. Leningrad is fortunate to have five institu- tions engaged in the study of primitive so- ciety, past and present (The Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography of the Academy of Sciences and associated Institute of Ethno- graphy, the University of Leningrad, the In- stitute of Archaeology, the Hermitage Museum, and somewhat isolated from the rest, the Museum of the Ethnography of the Peoples of the USSR), which together possess immense artifactual collections, archives, and librar- ies. The staffs of the institutions, who represent a wide spectrum of experience and opinion, cooperate in research and teaching. This favors an atmosphere of debate and inno- vation of a type often lacking, in the USSR as well as the United States, in single insti- tutions dominated by the established notions of their leading (and ranking) authorities. The contributors to the collection here con- sidered are employed by different institutions: 84 Arctic Anthropology XIII-1, 1976</page><page sequence="2">Howe: Soviet Theory and Method 85 complacency and routine formulae are conspicu- ously absent from their writing. Two of the contributors, the ethnographers, G. Nagy and Mac Duong, are Hungarian and Vietnamese, respectively. The collection itself is inno- vative. As the editor and contributor, A. M. Reshetov (l9T2:10), remarks, it is the first such world wide survey in Soviet literature. So that the reader may imbibe the contents of each paper considered with a minimum of dis- tracting asides, my report is constructed of two parts. In the first, a brief review of the Soviet authors1 propositions and main sup- porting arguments is presented with only those remarks I feel necessary to bring out points raised by the authors. In the second part I attempt, by means of commentary on the histori- cal and institutional environment in which Soviet scientists develop their ideas and ex- press themselves, to clarify for the reader the intentions of the authors and some of the unstated assumptions of arguments that may at times seem rather recondite. The commentary is keyed to the reviews by page references. The papers may be grouped into those that primarily concern problems of theory and method and those in which specific hunting- fishing-collecting societies are considered. Among the latter, several provide information on little known groups (Nagy's description of the East African Hadza, Ivanova's data on the Mrabri of Thailand, and Tikhonov's study of the Aeta of the Philippine Islands ) ; the re- mainder are more or less interpretive, de- voted to problems of the history and social organization of the Kubu of Sumatra (Maretin) , the Kadars of southwestern India (Maretina) , isolated "montagnards" of North Vietnam (Mac Duong), the so-called Ka'o-Shan of Taiwan (iiTs), the Alaskan Aleuts in the Eighteenth Century (Líapunova) , the Nivkh (Taksami; he himself is Nivkh) and Tungus- speaking (Vasilevich) peoples of far-eastern Siberia and the Forest Nenets of northern Russia (Khomich). My ob- jectives and limitations of space prevent re- view of these interesting attempts to apply the new principles to specific universes of data. The theory and method papers cover a wide range of topics. Two are devoted to interpre- tation of data from the Upper Palaeolithic (Grigor'ev) and Neolithic (Kholobystin) periods. One is a critique of the use of ethnographic data for historical interpreta- tions (Kabo), one concerns reconstruction of earlier states of language (Gert'senberg) , one attempts to demonstrate that Australian Aboriginal society was structured by two inter- penetrating yet independent sets of relations - economic and carnal - of which the latter was dominant (Bakhta and Senfuta) , to which an- other author replies that it is improper to interpret group kinship terminology as carnal relations (Reshetov). Finally, there is a paper dealing with the social psychology of primitive peoples (Tokarev). With one exception, each of the papers on theory and method is reviewed in Part I and discussed in Part II. Tokarev1 s paper on primitive social consciousness, the longest in the collection (kk pages), had to be excluded from discussion because the topic differs sufficiently from the others that I felt it would require too extended commentary. Its contents are briefly summarized at the end of Part I. In connection with the Bakhta- Senííita essay, I comment also on Vasilevich !s paper at the end of Part II. The objective I follow throughout is to ac- quaint the reader with current work in Soviet studies in primitive society, a task to which this book is admirably suited, and to provide some background on the intellectual environ- ment of the reader's Soviet colleagues, in order to promote understanding and interest by United States scientists in the work of their Soviet counterparts. PART I: REVIEW OF SEVEN SOVIET ESSAYS INTERPRETING SOCIAL RELATIONS OF THE UPPER PALAEOLITHIC (Grigorfev3 1972:11-25) In the opening paper, the archaeologist, G. P. Grigor'ev, considers interpretation of Upper Palaeolithic society from up-to-date information according to modern method and theory. His ideas reflect specific aspects of the critique, undertaken by himself and other Soviet archaeologists and ethnographers, of the interpretation of Palaeolithic archaeology worked out during the 1930s largely by P. P. Efimenko. This interpretation became, after Stalin's purges had led to the equation of criticism with treason, a speculative con- struct to which all data had to submit. Grigor'ev ( 1972:11) observes that although many of Efimenko 's conclusions have not with- stood the test of time, one of the inferences drawn by him remains a reliable basis for in- terpretations about social arrangements in the Upper Palaeolithic , namely that a palaeolithic campsite is the remains of a settlement consisting of several small dwellings , and in some cases all of the inhabitants of such a settlement found shelter in a single large multi- hearth dwelling, accommodating under its roof an entire community.</page><page sequence="3">86 Arctic Anthropology XIII-1 ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE FOR THE EXISTENCE OF THE NUCLEAR FAMILY Grigor'ev (1972:12-13) advances the proposi- tion that the dwelling floor in any of the habitations identified and plotted in western and eastern Europe can "be subdivided into equal sectors, 3.5 meters to 6 meters in diameter, each with a central hearth. He pro- poses the term "minimal dwelling area11 for these. Any Palaeolithic dwelling may "be con- ceived of either as a single such unit or as the sum of from two to ten units, usually ar- ranged in line. Dwellings of the type indi- cated are not limited in distribution, either in space or time, being found among primitive people at various levels of development. Con- sequently, some common principle underlies the external similarities of form. This is the existence of the small family, the only social unit which could fit about a hearth in the space of a two-meter radius. Crowding of the hearths even closer together inside a long dwelling was impossible because every member of a family had to find space around the fire. SOCIAL RELATIONS WITHIN THE PRIMITIVE COMMUNE Grigorfev is especially concerned to demon- strate that the archaeological data contain no support for the notion of group marriage, as well as to show that the simplistic view of the primitive commune as some sort of undif- ferentiated labor collective composed of blood kin dividing up the total product equally does not accord with the facts. This view is, he implies, a modernization, based on the projec- tion backwards of notions of communalism ex- pressing the negation of capitalist property relations, a type of "levelling", which, as Grigor'ev ( 1972:15-16) points out, occurred not among true primitives but in more advanced systems as a military necessity. Collectivism consists not in everyone holding everything in common and divid- ing everything up equally, but in mutual support in labor and realization of the principle of reciprocity in distribution. Each family labors independently whenever the conditions of labor require it, or in common with other families. Each family freely disposes of some part of the wealth produced, and is simul- taneously obligated to share that which, it would seem, belongs to it alone, but in fact is only held by it in common with other families, while receiving that which appears not to belong to it (Grigor'ev 1972:15). Grigor'ev observes that the archaeological evidence cannot demonstrate the existence of "clans" or "unilineal descent". He argues against the interpretations, developed in the 1930s, that the proliferation of female figurines in the Willendorf-Pavlov-Kostenki culture reflected the existence of matrilineal clan organization and even of matriarchy. He points out the circularity of the arguments later adduced to maintain this view. For in- stance, both occurrence of the figurines and relative stability of settlement were evidence for the existence of the clan in the Upper Palaeolithic, with the one being appealed to to validate the other, while the figurines indicating matriliny, with a higher status for women, entailed the existence of a clan or- ganization (Grigorfev 1972:22). Both archaeological and ethnographic data, he re- marks, disprove any necessary correspondence between manufacture of female figurines and matriliny, or even, a higher status for women (Grigor'ev 1972:22-3). Grigor'ev points out that it would be just as much an error to assume that the status of all members of the Upper Palaeolithic commune was equal as it would be to assume equalizing distribution. He mentions evidence from Kostenki I suggestive of differences in status ( 1972:16). Even in the Soviet Union, where it is policy to conduct excavations as completely as possible, Grigor!ev says that it is very dif- ficult to go from the level of the single dwelling to that of the whole settlement be- cause of the paucity of data on the latter (for an interesting recent Soviet attempt at comparative Upper Palaeolithic settlement analysis, I refer those who read Ukrainian to Shovkoplias [1971:13-21]; Grigor'ev, in- cidentally, is sceptical concerning Shovko- plias* methods). Among the principal diffi- culties is the determination of the number of dwellings occupied simultaneously at a site, since short term settlements were "very rare". Grigor'ev ( 1972:16-17) suggests a number of criteria. He arrives at the conclusion that settlements were of small size, averaging two to three small dwellings, or minimal dwelling units, with a maximum of ten (Grigorfev 1972: 19). Grigor'ev (1972:19-22) devotes several pages to discussion of length of site occupa- tion. He details four criteria for determina- tion: thickness of loess deposited in the immediate vicinity of a dwelling, on which basis he proposes that Pushkari and Kostenki settlements were inhabited continually for several decades; accumulation of food bones, which, he observes, is subject to contradic- tory interpretations; calculations on the basis of the quantity of bone used for fuel; and evidence for modification and repair of structures through time. He notes one case where habitation was sufficiently prolonged</page><page sequence="4">Howe: Soviet Theory and Method 87 that the inhabitants "forgot" about earlier features . SOCIOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION OF "ARCHAEOLOGI- CAL "CULTURE" ("PHASE" OF WILLEY AND PHILLIPS) Finally, Grigor'ev criticizes Efimenko's attempt to identify "archaeological culture" (a class of occupations) with ethnographic "tribe". This is a sensitive issue, made abundantly clear by the assertion by the author of the next paper in the collection that "a record of the tribe, the highest socio- territorial organization of the Neolithic, is preserved in archaeological cultures" (Khlobys- tin 1972:Ul), to which Grigor'ev (l972:2U) re- torts that: "The absence of tribal cultures is all that is evident to date". The tribe of contemporary backward peoples is too small a social unit to lead an isolated existence and preserve a peculiar material culture. In the primitive societies known to us the tribe always formed a component of a broader entity, which should be called a nationality (narodnost r ) were it not for the ancient prejudice that primitive times knew no entity larger than the tribe (Grigor'ev 1972:21+). As if to prove the point, the ethnographer, A. M. Reshetov (l972:U-5), editor of the col- lection, takes exception to Grigor'ev's use of the term "narodost1": A circumscribed community of territory was in no way determinate of nomadic primitive hunters and collectors, with- out large "clan" collectives , not bound to any definite location, or ancestral home, but changing abodes either con- tinually or as the result of periodical regular migrations. Consequently, it is hardly correct to speak of a nationality in the Palaeolithic period . . . The largest community that can be distin- guished, provisionally, was an ethnolin- guistic community, while the real entity was initially the nomadic group, or prototribe . . . Thus, human self- awareness was always many-tiered (1972: U-5; Grigorfev, incidentally, in his paper excludes "narodnost*" from the Upper Palaeolithic (1972 :2*+-5) . OBSERVATIONS CONCERNING THE "HORDE" HYPOTHESIS Grigor'ev (l972:2U) closes on one final note of significance, namely that "no difference in principle existed between the communities of the Upper Palaeolithic and of the Mousterian or Acheulian epochs." This remark is directed against the theory of a special horde stage of human evolution. This theory originated in the 1930s when the data were much scarcer and when heavy reliance was placed on faithful adherence to a particular interpretation of casual remarks by Engels and Lenin (cf. Efimenko 1938, 1953; Ravdonikas 19^7 ). Grigor!ev holds that the horde notion as then conceived has been all but demolished by scientific practice of the last decade. In the words of V. P. LÍíibin (l97O:Uo), excavator of the only sealed in situ Acheulian sites so far identified in the Soviet Union: The existence of local variants, local archaeological cultures, representing ... a totality of communities linked by culture and economic type, the evidence for settled life and the natural division of labor by sex and age contradicts the deeply rooted notion of Acheulian humans living in herds inherited from their animal f orebearers . Data on the social, economic and labor aspects of human activity lead us to suppose that people lived not in herds but in com- munes, socially integrated collectives. INTERPRETING SOCIAL RELATIONS OF THE NON- AGRICULTURAL NEOLITHIC (Khlobystin 1972:26-42) The second paper is devoted to the "socio- logy" of the Neolithic cultures in the boreal forest and tundra zone of Eurasia, "in which the transition to primitive cultivation based on the then known grain cultures employing ineffectual stone tools was virtually im- possible" (Khlobystin 1972:29). "AGO-" VERSUS "AGRONEOLITHIC": DEFINITION AND RELATIONSHIP Khlobystin (1972:26-7) divides Neolithic cultures into "agroneolithic" and "agoneo- lithic", "reflecting differences in subsis- tence activity", agro meaning "agriculture", ago y "to hunt, to pursue" (from Old Greek), and as-serts that "... while the process of transition to a producing economy took the form of a fundamental change, a qualitative leap (the 'Neolithic revolution1), the progressive alterations [of instruments of labor and specialization of subsistence ac- tivity] in collectives retaining an economy based on appropriation of the gifts of nature were more gradual, evolutionary." DEMOGRAPHIC HYPOTHESIS TO EXPLAIN CHANGE Khlobystin (1972:26-7) opens his paper with an hypothesis to explain the transition to</page><page sequence="5">88 Arctic Anthropology XIII- 1 agriculture, which recalls the "demographic" explanation offered by Lewis Binford (1968: 313-^1), although intended, perhaps, to echo Tèr-Akopianfs (l968:Part II, pp. 53-M rein- terpretation of Marx. In the Neolithic epoch nearly all the surface of the earth suitable for human habitation had been occupied. At the margins of the oikumene it was still possible for collectives with economies based on the appropriation of nature's products to grow by increasing the area under exploitation. But in a number of regions this possibility had been ex- hausted. Biocentose governed by natural laws had been disrupted by sociological laws, in particular by the law of preser- vation and increase of the collective's numerical strength through improvement of means and methods of production. Apparently, the increase in population led to decrease and extermination of wild flora and fauna, compelling new ways to adapt to nature. One such way was to regulate population artifically; another, to change over to an intensive producing- type economy. In the Near East, population growth and the impos- sibility of continued segmentation at the level of an appropriating type economy forced the people to go over to an agroneolithic producing economy of herd- ing and cultivation ... In the degree relative overpopulation spread it con- fronted people on neighboring territory with the same situation, compelling them likewise to adopt agriculture. The latter was facilitated both by the ac- quisition of the achievements of their ■ neighbors who had made the change earlier and by the expansion of the agroneolithic cultures which, stimulated by the transition to producing type economy, experienced in their turn demographic increase, segmentation of collectives and their migration . . . Khlobystin ( 1972: 28) observes that Soviet archaeological science holds "unquestioned priority" as respects "paleosociological re- search" on the Neolithic, which was initiated in the mid-1930s. While "correct explanations of a number of facts" were achieved at the time, there also occurred a tendency "to bring the available material into agreement with existing theoretical propositions". In recent years, "The growing number of excavated Neolithic sites and application of the methods of the natural sciences to archaeological re- search has systematized study of the Neolithic, while the isolation of archaeologi- cal cultures enables us to initiate the study of the history of specific ethnic communi- ties". As yet, however, no "generalizing study of the sociology and economy of agoneo- lithic societies" has been made. In the body of the paper Khlobystin con- siders information pertaining to settlement and subsistence patterns, the types of sub- sistence activities and organization of labor, social and ethnic structure of different agoneolithic communities of European Russia and Siberia. Among his conclusions are that the local group comprised individual families (1972:31); that most subsistence activity required cooperation of no more than three to five people, large production collectives existing as the exception on the seacoast (1972:32-3); that the formation of certain modern "peoples" can be traced to the Neolithic (1972:35); that status differences were developed, in some cases already extreme, including powerful shamans and war leaders, dependent tribesmen, and slaves, with the in- ferior position of women emphasized ( 1972: 37- 9). The material and argumentation is too detailed to be covered in this brief review. Therefore, I will concentrate on one issue, the problem of the matriarchy, which, however, is central to his entire analysis. ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE AGAINST NEOLITHIC "MATRIARCHY" CONCEPT On the basis of interpretation of archaeolo- gical data, Khlobystin challenges the notion of Neolithic society standard in the USSR since the 1930s. As he notes, "The Neolithic is usually depicted as the epoch of the Matriarchy, the epoch of the primacy of women in the life of hunting collectives, the heyday of the matrilineal clan and matrilocal marriage peculiar to it". As examples, he lists intro- ductory textbooks of archaeology of the USSR, general ethnography and history of primitive society, recently accepted by the Ministry of Higher Education for use in the history de- partments of Russian universities (Pershit's, Mongait, Alekseev 1968:70-1, 135-37; Avdusin 1967:^0, 72; Belanovskaia 1967). Khlobystin relates the concept of universal matriarchy to the theory of "survivals", de- veloped by Nineteenth Century ethnographers, especially by Edward B. Tyler (vid. Tylor 1889). Since as, Vucinich (1967) notes,2 survivals have been extensively employed in Soviet ethnography to reconstruct the past as khlobystin, I feel certain, has read Binford fs paper. 2For the consensus Soviet position, see Tokarev, editor, 1968:15-16.</page><page sequence="6">Howe: Soviet Theory and Method 89 well as to interpret the present, the implica- tions of Khlobystin fs ( 1972: 28) remarks are far-reaching: Arising on the foundation of the classi- cal studies of Bachofen and Morgan, proof for the idea of the existence and supremacy during the New Stone Age period of matriarchal society hinged mainly ... on the proposition that all evidence indicating veneration or at least the equal status of women in so- ciety were surviving traits of very early social relations, traits of the Matriarchy. Since women are honored as mothers and protectors of the family hearth in some degree by nearly all peoples, the in- ference of the universality of the matriarchal stage with all the charac- teristics peculiar to it was a natural outcome. Consequently everything con- nected with the patriarchal clan and the leading position of the male component of society were considered later phenomena, arising after the Neolithic epoch on the basis of private property. Khlobystin ( 1972: 39) supports his argumenta- tion by the use of a number of types of data, from which he attempts to adduce the absence of uxorilocal residence and the frequency of unequal social position of the sexes. For in- stance, he describes burials in which a man, richly furnished with grave goods, is accom- panied by one or more young women. The dif- ferent social position of the deceased is em- phasized in various ways and degrees, depend- ing on the culture (Oleneostrov or Kitoi , both settled fishing people). In one case, the women are turned to face the central male; in another, the burials are extended feet to feet, which might reflect not only the in- ferior social status of the female but that the deceaseds1 "paths" after death diverge as the result of their membership in opposing sodalities (e.g., clans). "Probably the victims of this custom were women belonging to the privileged personages, with whom they were buried, like things". Khlobystin ob- serves that portable art objects portray ani- mals, which at Oleneostrov by the frequency of one species (the elk) and its representa- tion on the staffs of "chieftains" suggests the existence of "totemic cults", or they por- tray, in the Forest Neolithic, anthropomorphic creatures "evidently . . . personifying some sort of Master of Nature". He stresses that if sex is indicated, it is masculine (Khlobystin 1972:Uo). "The abundant repre- sentation of females in painting and plastic art brought forward to prove the existence of the Matriarchy in Palaeolithic and Agroneo- lithic societies is inapplicable, it turns out, to Agoneolithic societies of hunters and fishermen (Khlobystin 1972 :Ul). To disprove the existence of uxorilocal residence, Khlobystin (1972: 3*0 resorts to an argument suggesting the influence of Longacre (196U) and Deetz (1965). He writes as fol- lows : The small size of finger impressions on Neolithic vessels compels us to suppose that they were produced by women. The uniformity of ceramic decoration within the confines of a single culture contro- verts the axiomatic assertion that matri- local marriage existed during the Neo- lithic epoch. Given the absence of con- tacts, increasing through time, between the female fabricators of the ceramics who would dwell in different settlements, which would follow inevitably from matri- local marriage soon after segmentation of the collective, old design elements would be forgotten and new ones accumu- lated. Yet the differences in ornamental design distributed within the confines of a single culture is many times less than the differences in ceramic ornamenta- tion between neighboring cultures. This can be explained by the existence of a form of marriage whereby women and their creative concepts circulated within the confines of an endogamous collective, the concepts quickly approximating one another. An archaeological culture, judging from the highly specific orna- mental designs, should be considered to belong to a society with a closed mar- riage organization ... At the same time that the bearers of an archaeologi- cal culture formed an endogamous com- munity, each settlement within it was, in all probability, exogamous. ON SOCIOLOGICAL REFERENCES OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL CLASSES: DISAGREEMENTS Khlobystin (l972:33-i0 attempts to use the equation of archaeological classes with socio- logical phenomena more widely. He states: On the basis of differences observed when comparing ceramic complexes in the composition of the ornamentation (dif- ferences of the first order), in the se- lection of predominant elements (dif- ferences of the second order), and in the form and technique of manufacture, and ways the ornament is applied (dif- ferences of the third order), archaeo- logical sites can be united into cor- responding ranked groups. Sites dif- fering only in the first order unite into groups called archaeological cul- tures. As a rule they occupy an area of</page><page sequence="7">90 Arctic Anthropology XIII-1 1500 to 3000 square kilometers . . . Cultures differing in the second order, revealing sometimes corresponding dif- ferences in implement forms and dwell- ing types , can be incorporated into a single cultural community. Cultures differentiated "by attributes of the third order can be united into zones on the basis of other attributes of material production connected with sub- sistence methods: the circumpolar zone of reindeer hunters; the North Pacific zone of marine hunters, etc. There are differences between the argumenta- tion of GrigorTev and Khlobystin. The former is more concerned to illustrate some principles of interpretation, while the latter constructs a scheme of interpretations . Khlobystin' s paper typifies some of the dif- ferences in method between Soviet and United States archaeologists (prehistorians) , includ- ing the Soviet adherents to the equivalent of the "New Archaeology". He assumes an equation of archaeological classes to phenomena in the real world no longer accepted implicitly by many United States specialists, who maintain it must be independently demonstrated. Grigor'ev's more critical view, rejecting simple correspondence between archaeological culture and sociological unit (see p. 87 this article), indicating a belief that attributes selected to create classes may not be so "natural" as we would like, is as yet unusual among Soviet archaeologists. In line with the above, Khlobystin (1972:2*0 presents no statistical demonstration that uniformity within ceramic design provinces is significantly greater than uniformity between provinces. Nor does he show that meaningful clusters of ceramic design elements do not occur within his provinces. His judgments are all qualitative. Grigor'ev, on the other hand, suggests that ethnic units of the type Khlobystin is concerned with cannot certainly be distinguished on the basis of distinctive ceramic traits (so-called "Iroquoian" pottery was produced by some northern members of the Iroquoian ethnolinguistic community and by some northeastern Algonkians as well). It would have been useful also if Khlobystin had given us some statistical data on the fre- quency of burials in which the position of women seems to be debased in relation to burials indicating equality of the sexes, such as do occur at Oleneostrov. To be fair, none of these observations de- tracts much from Khlobystin1 s achievement. His interpretation accords much better with our knowledge of recent primitive societies of Stone Age food harvesters than the matriarchal theory, which was built up largely by generalizations from inadequate data plus a liberal dose of speculation. To establish the plausibility of his interpretations Khlobystin has to demonstrate the implausibility of the Matriarchy as respects the specific universe of data with which he is dealing. Thus, he suggests that uxorilocal residence is counter- indicated, but does not attempt to prove that residence was necessarily virilocal. Like- wise, he advances evidence against an equal, much less superior, status for women in the agoneolithic of Eurasia, but says nothing about clan organization, about which the evi- dence is at best suggestive. His attempt to relate dwelling and settlement type to sub- sistence pattern of different ecological zones is especially informative. CRITIQUE OF ATTEMPTS TO RECONSTRUCT EARLIER STATES OF LANGUAGE FROM LINGUISTIC DATA (Gerfsenberg 1972:43-52) Like other authors in this collection, Gert'senberg considers unexamined assumptions of Soviet studies of primitive society that, since their acceptance in the 1930s, have be- come obsolete. However, in contrast to the pre-critical doctrine of survivals and specu- lative evolutionism, whose criticism is taking place in the realm of the sciences without "official" sanction, rejection of the "new doctrine of language" embodying many of the assumptions criticized by Gerfsenberg was initiated from outside linguistics by Stalin (l95l) himself. The official condemnation of Marr's doctrines had to be accepted, criticism was inseparable from denunciation (e.g., Protiv vulgaviza€sii . . . 1953), and some scientists, faced by a choice not of their own making, undoubtedly repressed notions which later reappeared in other guises. "Rejected hypotheses", Gert'senberg (1972:^3) remarks, "sometimes continue to exist on the periphery of science giving rise to strange illusions, which can exert influence on individual scientists" . "PRE-LOGICAL THINKING" AND OTHER PROBLEMS IN PERCEPTION The first "illusion" Gert°senberg (1972: 1+3) is concerned to dispel is "the belief that it is possible by means of linguistic reconstruc- tion to penetrate into a qualitatively dif- ferent state of language, which supposedly characterized a preceding epoch in the develop- ment of humanity". Marrfs "new doctrine" purported to prove by means of capriciously constructed etymologies (which traced back all the words of all languages ultimately to the "four elements", sals bev3 iony roshl) that the modern language state was preceded by an</page><page sequence="8">Howe: Soviet Theory and Method 91 earlier state, called Japhetic, preserved in relic form by isolated languages, and that this "evolution" existed in a causal rela- tionship with the differentiation of logical from pre-logical thinking a là Lévy-Bruhl. Concerning the latter, Gert'senberg (l972:UU) observes: In this regard the proposition can be advanced that prelogicai thinking covers forms characteristic of cultures of a civilization not our own, hence, appear- ing to us to be remarkable and unusual. The human universals in it seem to us to be present in our thinking. The dif- ferences - and within the pre-logical they can be numerous, applicable to each separate, hence, "not our" form of cul- ture or civilization, are imperceptible at the first stage of research, because just those traits stand out which differ from the ordinary, that is, which are characteristic of one of the varieties of culture, one of the civilizations, within which we find ourselves. Gertsenberg goes on to examine this illu- sion in other forms. He criticizes A. Leont?evfs hypothesis that syllable-phonetic languages preceded phonetically structured languages (Leont!ev 1963), which was based in part on the theory of Proto-Indoeuropean monovocalism, which Ger€senberg (1972 : UU- 5 ) also rejects. Similarly, he refutes the sug- gestion to consider parataxis and hypotaxis "non-primitive" (Katisnel1 son 19^0), as well as Serebrennikov's (l9T0) criterion of non- transformation, according to which linguistic phenomena that transform into other linguistic phenomena are archaic, the new phenomena being non-returnable to the original state (Gert'senberg 1972 :U5). Underlying the futility of all such attempts to penetrate in- to linguistic prehistory is the absence of historical depth available to the linguist, whose material covers a tiny fraction of the history of language, to which must be added that very few languages can be studied his- torically, even fewer, sufficiently diachroni- cally, while the loss of linguistic material is "immeasurable and irretrievable" (Gert'senberg 1972 :U6). "ORIGINAL LINGUISTIC CONTINUUM" HYPOTHESIS REJECTED The second illusion Gert'senberg (l912:h6) examines, related to the first, is the idea of an oritinal linguistic continuum. He ob- serves that the concept harks back to recon- structions that sought to establish a hierarchy of relationships between all known families leading back to a single ancient stock, which prior to its dissolution formed such a continuum. These theories are built out of fortuitous parallels and by doing violence to the laws of historical phonetics. Restorable time depth is limited. As we go deeper and deeper into the past the method becomes more and more tenuous. Miniature units of two or three sounds are distinguished, whose make-up is largely the product of the method itself (for instance, Indo- european "laringeals") and which, in consequence of their small size, turn out to be suitable for comparisons that are as broad as they are unconvincing. In the last analysis, Gert'senberg (1972: 1+7-8) asserts, all such theories have a single argument to support them, the pathetic retreat to the principle of the mono genes is of humankind. Even if we grant this more than doubtful prin- ciple, it must be pointed out that the monogenesis of language cannot be deduced from it, for articulate (human) language could have taken shape after the division of humanity. Both arguments pro and contra, however, are speculative, un- scientific, in the realm of fantasy. Not a single linguistic reconstruction can work for us in the capacity of such a long range time machine. Archaeologi- cal and anthropological data also do not permit the localization of the sought for first human in some area small enough to have been served by a single language . . . This hypothesis is built on faith ... We can only suppose that in that far-off epoch as at the present time re- lated and unrelated languages existed. Contacts between ethnic groups speaking these languages . . . led to convergent phenomena, out-migration, to divergence. Language alliances arose, language families dissolved, convergent-divergent oscillations of the linguistic whole took place, beginning in the indefinite past and continuing to our day. Concluding his critique of theories that purport to provide access to the secrets of the past, Gert'senberg (l972:U8) ridicules glottochronology, which he says, "probably can be resorted to only when a large number of languages are superficially known and suffi- cient materials for the usual comparative- historical analysis is absent". METHODS FOR DISCOVERY OF LANGUAGE REGULARITIES AND THE DIALECTIC OF LANGUAGE CHANGE In the second part of his essay, Gert'senberg (1972:1*9) considers methods for retrieving the</page><page sequence="9">92 Arctic Anthropology XIII-1 linguistic past, which he finds in the disci- pline of linguistic geography, discovering "general laws of the language landscape", and in the comparative-historical method by which the "substantive content of languages" of earlier periods is reconstructed. He adds that sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, and the study of language functions should also be able to disclose universal laws contributing to an understanding of the nature of language in the past as well as the present. Linguis- tic geography generalized the results of dialectology, areal linguistics, and linguo- geography (the latter bordering on socio- linguistics), producing linguogeographical typology. The end product of comparative his- torical study is a protolanguage , which, Ger€senberg (1972: 51 ) observes, is more ac- curately termed a "protolanguage state". I sense that in Gerti3enberg!s presentation of the protolanguage concept and the ways language families may arise, Marrfs notion of hybridization and his rejection of the then current homogeneous "parent language" idea re- appear on a new level. Conversely, Geriisenberg (1972:50) cannot accept for hybridization the substitution of "linguistic conquest" asso- ciated with reassertion of a straight-line linguistic evolution from parent languages that Stalin propounded in his attack on Marr in 1950. The mechanical absolutizing of con- vergent processes (Marr) or of divergent processes (Stalin, in company with most histor- ical linguists of the day) is transcended. Thus, he writes that isolated isoglosses can unite points even within the areas of unrelated lan- guages . If it turns out the number of such isoglosses is large, then we speak of a language alliance resulting from the influence of one language on the other, of convergence. Given suffi- ciently lengthy and profound interaction a propinquity between languages can arise such that they are united sub- stantially and a language family is formed . But this divergence takes place in dialec- tical unity with divergence from a parent stock, which is evident from the form of the "protolanguage". "The reconstructed lexical and grammatical synonyms of the protolanguage, often unevenly distributed over the territory of the given language family, indirectly indi- cate that it is most plausible to consider a protolanguage the specific reflex of some language plurality in a strongly contracted state" (Gertijenberg 1972:51). In conclusion, Gertfsenberg (1972:52) notes that "at the present time, linguistic methods can provide but a limited and fragmentary conception of the archaic language landscape landscape and of the laws of its structure. The only positive inference", he believes, "is that if the language and language families of hunters, fishermen, and gatherers differed from language in the epoch of * automobile civilization1 , the difference was not quali- tative but only quantitative". MARXISM AND THE USE OF DATA OF SOCIO -CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY AS AN HISTORICAL SOURCE (Kobo 1972:53-67) Kabo!s paper differs from the others in the collection. He is concerned less with in- stances of the use of ethnography than with the way it has and should be used to interpret the past. Kabo defines principles to guide the application of ethnography to analysis of societies that existed before the ethno- graphic present. This requires him to criti- cize the misuse of ethnography, occasioned by the "crisis in theory" and induces some to tailor the data to outworn theory, and others to reject ethnographic data altogether on the grounds that they are inapplicable to an ear- lier era. Thus, Kabo examines some basic propositions of Societ ethnography-cum-hi story. ETHNOGRAPHY IS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE Kabo (1972:53-*+) opens with a defense of ethnography as an historical science. He notes that ethnographic data served Marx and Engels as an historical source "in the broad sense", since "they sought to discover in them the typical, reflecting general histori- cal regularities characteristic of a particu- lar stage of social development, rather than the individual, representative only of a specific society and a specific moment in history". He states that "scientists who deny the significance of the historical- typological method substitute narrow chrono- logical historicism for the broad stadial- historical approach of Marx and Engels, authentic historicism, which enables us to distinguish general regularities of social development", and he observes that "chronological historicism leads to Europo- centrism", since the stages of society recog- nized correspond to those developed by Euro- pean peoples, in effect eliminating from the historical horizon ethnographic details of the Australian Aborigines, the South Indian Kadars, or Polar Eskimo, which are recog- nized only as their individual traits. On the other hand, the investigator "guided by the historical-typological method" seeks in these details the typical in order "to reconstruct specific stages of social development without reference to the time and place of the given</page><page sequence="10">Howe: Soviet Theory and Method 93 concrete society", which enables him "to assign the Australian Aborigines, South Indian Kadars, and Polar Eskimo to a single histori- cal class of primitive hunters and collectors, because their socio-economic relations are in many ways similar even though these peoples live in different geographic circumstances and natural environments, and in different socio- historical conditions". This criticism, it is apparent, is directed not so much against ethnographers in the West as it is against a certain trend in the USSR to question the value of data on contemporary hunter-gatherer societies that conflict with institutionalized theory: The tendency to deny that valid judgments about the past can be derived from con- temporary societies on the grounds they are insufficiently representative is associated with the crisis of theory in ethnography, accounted for by the great flood of scientific information that cannot be accommodated in the former schemes to which we are accustomed . . . We deny ourselves the support of objective facts subject to scientific analysis when we reject ethnographic material as the foundation for reconstruction of past social relations (Kabo 1972:65-6). As for Anglo-American ethnography (i.e., social anthropology), "with its traditions of functional ism and presentism, limiting the tasks of ethnography to the study of social institutions and their functions in the present day", the alteration in the situation of its objects, the former colonial peoples and oppressed nationalities, has compelled it to begin to adopt a historical perspective, "an example of "which is the work of the Ameri- can ethnohistorians". The recently backward peoples, who are taking "an ever more active part in the construction of a new world, free from social inequality, national oppression and racial prejudice, contributing to the creation of the contemporary universal cul- ture", demand to know their history, not only as a matter of scientific and cultural signi- ficance to the task of social reconstruction, but in the interests of social justice. In ad- dition to its scientific aspect, therefore, study of their part is important socially and politically (Kabo 1972:58-9). SOCIO-ECONOMIC FORMATION AND BASE- SUPERSTRUCTURE DIALECTIC: CON- CEPTUAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE "HISTORICAL-TYPOLOGICAL METHOD" The concepts of comparative-historical analysis are "socio-economic formation" and "base-superstructure" dialectic. "Like all other phenomena of the material world, social organisms possess both common attributes, re- flecting their kinship and enabling them to be classified, and individual attributes specific to each". This is why any particular con- temporary society is also a society of a definite type. The term "socio-economic forma- tion" is applied to the "system" determined by the fundamental relations identified by the common features of concrete societies. "Any human society is a form of the real histori- cal existence of a particular social forma- tion. Formation and concrete society relate as essence and appearance, the universal and the particular, within which and through which alone the universal can exist". To project into the past, it is necessary to abstract from the individual (particular) traits of contemporary societies to the traits they share with extinct social organisms of the same type (Kabo 1972 :6l). The features uniting individual societies and serving to define formations are those characteristic of their base. When speaking of the similarity of the socio-economic relations that determines the membership of the Australian Aborigines , South Indian Kadars , and Polar Eskimo in the class of hunter- gatherers of the primitive-communal formation, we have in mind their economic organiza- tion, the forms of property, division of labor, nature of the communes as the fundamental economic nuclei of society, including their composition, interrela- tion between the communes and the fami- lies comprising each, . . . the interre- lation between the seasonal cycle in nature, seasonal migrations, and the numerical size of the communes, all governed by regularities. These consti- tute the fundamental, governing indica- tors defining the socio-economic base of the respective societies. They are not superstructural nor accidental phenomena, selected by whim. Consequently, when we say these peoples belong to a single historical type, we have in mind that they represent human society on a par- ticular level of socio-economic develop- ment, or that they represent a particu- lar stage in the development of the Archaic social formation. This in turn permits us to distinguish some of the universal regularities of the socio- historical process, on the basis of which to reconstruct the remote past of peoples who have already traversed this stage of social development, since we can assume that this past was subject to the same regularities (Kabo 1972:5*0. As regards the social superstructure erected</page><page sequence="11">94 Arctic Anthropology XIII- 1 on this base, we can say much less. Dependent social institutions and the ideology rational- izing social reality exist in dialectical in- teraction with the base. "Inflexible mechani- cal determinism does not occur in human society; only the most fundamental social bonds, production relations above all, are determined" . While changes in the fundamental relations occasion changes in all other aspects of social life, this does not take place automatically, but creatively, by the con- scious efforts of society's members to adapt to new conditions of social existence. The further removed a social or cultural phenome- non is from the sphere of production, the base, the less we are able to predict it with any certainty. We can predict with a measure of cer- tainty social relations functionally bound up with production and dependent upon the level of social development, for instance, the character of the com- mune, which is the basic production col- lective of primitive society. But we cannot confirm the existence in a given society of any particular form of the clan, e.g., a patrilineal or matri- lineal clan, since the clan in its func- tion, evinced primarily in the organiza- tion of family and marital relations, is less bound to production than the com- mune (Kabo 1972:59). The commune is the "basic structural unit of pre-agr i cultural society in every epoch and circumstance". Ethnography finds it to be ubiquitous, and "everywhere its composition, size, relative mobility, the character of the division of labor by age and sex, are governed by certain regularities, determined by the interaction of production with the natural environment as the condition of production". For this reason, if we know the conditions imposed by the natural environment and geography, we can predict the approximate size and way of life of a hunting commune. But figuratively speaking, the higher we penetrate into the social and ideologi- cal superstructure, the more hypotheti- cal will our propositions become. We cannot affirm that in the society under consideration a clan organization even existed, much less tell its form. And in fact, ethnography is acquainted with more hunter-gatherer societies where, for various reasons, clan organization is absent and marital and family rela- tions are organized in other ways, than with societies where it occurs (Kabo 1972: 59-60). Despite this limitation, and the need to take into account the influence on ancient and contemporary primitive societies of different historical and natural environments, their study comparatively "is not only theoretically permissible, but essential, if we would go be- yond the limits imposed by empirical examina- tion of concrete social forms to make higher order theoretical generalizations and to eluci- date the laws of social development". This view, Kabo (l972:6o) states, is finding ever wider acceptance abroad. As evidence he cites the symposium, Man the Hunter (Lee and DeVore 1968), which "is one of the most all-round investigations of the hunt- ing-gathering stage of human development'!. After presenting examples of general problems of social organisms on the hunter-gatherer level and "of the reconstruction of the past from the data of ethnography" examined by participants in the symposium, Kabo (l972:60) concludes : Almost all the participants in the dis- cussion countenanced in principle the possibility of ethno-archaeological parallels. Each one, however, attempted to define the limits within which such operations are permissible. The value and fruit fulness of such an approach is obvious . FAILURE OF THESE CONCEPTS TO BECOME^ESTABLISHED IN SOVIET ETHNOGRAPHY: HOW YURI Í SEMÈNOV VIOLATES THE PRINCIPLES OF HISTORICAL COMPARISON It should "be obvious to anyone trained in Marxism that "the issue of the use of ethno- graphy to reconstruct the history of primitive society is intimately bound up with the doc- trine of social formations, the comprehension of society as systems or structures, the ele- ments of which . . . are joined by regular causal and functional bonds" (Kabo 1972:55). Soviet historians, of course, consider them- selves Marxist-Leninists. Yet Kabo has felt it necessary to reiterate elementary princi- ples of Marxist historicism, which to the Soviet-trained scientist should be self- evident, because these methods of comparative research "have yet to establish themselves in ethnography and the history of primitive so- ciety in the way they have in some other so- cial sciences". In place of investigations based on comparative study of peoples situated on an identical level of social develop- ment, instead of disclosing the proper- ties common to them all that make them representstive of a single historical type, instead of the discovery on this foundation of universal regularities of the social-historical process, in the</page><page sequence="12">Howe: Soviet Theory and Method 95 history of primitive society a specula- tive method of reconstructing primitive times is widespread, relying primarily on hypothesis and deduction (Kabo 1972: Those who read general works on world history and the history of primitive society, political economy and histori- cal materialism should keep in mind that many conceptualizations relating to the history of primitive society are no more than theoretical constructs, very feebly grounded in the factual material, and sometimes entirely unsupported. More- over, the vulnerability of our theoreti- cal conceptions no longer originates in the insufficient development of the fac- tual base of ethnography, as was the case in the last century, but results from the failure of theoretical thinking to keep pace with the inexorably swelling fund of factual material. Herein lie the reasons that an abstract, specula- tive method of reconstructing the past, into which facts are admitted only at the whim of the investigator, to shore up preconceived a priori notions, survives in the history of primitive society (Kabo 1972:61-2). Currently, the most vocal and articulate representative of this trend is the social philosopher, Yurii Semenov. Kabo accuses Semenov of two specific methodological trans- gressions: misuse of survivals and the derivation of evidence from non-equivalent societies. I referred to Semenov1 s defense of group marriage in my discussion of Grigorfev!s paper (see p. 102 this article). Kabo (1972:57) claims that Semenov (1966) in his opus, How Humankind Arose , "tears out of their social and cultural context, where they are organically bound up with other as- pects of social life, the customs prevalent among modern peoples, including those who have been living in class societies for ages, and considers them in the capacity of survivals, reflecting relations which, in his opinion, were already in existence in the primitive horde (stado) , among the Pithecanthropines ..." He charges that "one of the elementary demands of the historical-typological method, primary reliance on stadially equivalent material, that is, material relating to people who stand on the same or nearly the same plane of socio-economic and cultural development, is alien to íu. I. Semenov". Attempting to prove the former univer- sality of "diseconomie and dislocal group marriage" as a stage in sociogenesis, he resorts to material on highly developed peoples, many of whom already have en- tered on the path of development of class relations ... We ask, why are rela- tions that achieve their zenith in highly evolved society, existing in primitive society only in embryo, to be considered survivals of what, accord- ing to Semenov, took place in even more ancient times? (Kabo 1972:65). Kabo presents rules for using the "method of survivals" (cf . , remarks page 88, this paper). "It would seem", he points out, "that the method which examines each and every phenomenon of culture and social life within the matrix of associated social rela- tions and conditions, not only of the past, but above all, those existing at the present time, seeking out its material and ideologi- cal roots in the present and not simply in the past, would stand closest of all to the Marxist-oriented researcher". The very fact of survival indicates that some circum- stances still operative favor preservation. To consider phenomena selected from a countless number that disappeared to be no more than leftovers of realized stages of social development means to ignore the issue of the reasons for their tenacity and of their functions in the modern epoch. Not simply mechani- cal borrowing but a process of selection and adaptation of old forms to new social conditions is at work here. Many customs and social institutions, which figure in the ethnographic literature as survi- vals, are fully explicable in terms of relations and conditions existing in society at the present time. The cul- ture of contemporary peoples is a com- plex layering of phenomena originating at different times. Only scientific analysis that determines the time and circumstances in which each separate social and cultural phenomenon arose is competent to untangle this, complicated knot (Kabo 1972:56-7). THE THREE "METHODOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES" OF HISTORICAL-ETHNOGRAPHIC COMPARISON Summing up, Kabo ( 1972:6^-5) advocates three "methodological principles" to govern the use of ethnographic data as an historical source. Firstly, it is necessary to determine whether a given phenomenon is truly a survi- val, and if so, of what era. The admission of any phenomenon in the capacity of a survival must be fully argued. Secondly, when attempt- ing to reconstruct the past from ethnographic data, selection must be made from societies of equivalent stage, belonging to a socio- historical type as near as possible to the group we wish to reconstruct. Thirdly, it is</page><page sequence="13">96 Arctic Anthropology XIII-1 essential to establish just what changes have been introduced into the culture and social organization of contemporary peoples under the influence of colonialism and of more advanced systems to determine the extent and manner they are comparable. "It is just as improper and unfounded to deny the importance of ethnographic facts for reconstructing the past, which at times becomes in practice the denial merely of unwanted facts, as it is un- conditionally to interpolate contemporary social structure into the past". INVESTIGATION OF PRIMITIVE ECONOMY -KEY TO FUTURE SYNTHESIS Finally, Kabo (1972:66) reiterates that for the investigator guided by the concept of social formation, "It is obvious that analysis of social structure, uncovering the ties be- tween economic base and other of its elements in contemporary society, is the path to cogni- tion of relations in similar societies of any epoch". Society "is not a combination of for- tuitous factors, but a system in which the leading role belongs to socio-economic insti- tutions". Consequently, "study of the economy of the primitive communal formation, the least investigated sphere of economic history, is one of the most urgent tasks of contemporary ethnography". It stands in the center of current discussions in the USSR "concerning the place and function of the institutions of primitive society".3 Without a profound in- vestigation of the economic base of primitive society, study of the latter has no future". Only guided by these demands can we re- move the history of primitive society from the genre of scientific fantasy. This it often becomes under the pen of talented authors , who are , none-the- less, given to exaggeration. Only in this way can it become grounded in strictly scientific, objective, methods of research (Kabo 1972:6U). MARXISM AND THE DETERMINATE RELATIONS OF PRIMITIVE SOCIETY (Bakhta and Senvuta 1972: 68-90, Reshetov 1972:228-34) Since the papers by Bakhta and Senilità and by Reshetov are critically related, it is ex- pedient to consider them as a unit. Bakhta and Seniuta devote their paper to an analysis of the interaction between the "base" and "superstructure" of Australian Aboriginal society in light of Tér-Akopían f s reinterpreta- tion of the evolution of Marx and Engels T thinking about the nature of primitive society. Reshetov expresses doubt concerning the validity of the total opposition of economic and kinship relations that seems to be re- quired by Ter-Akopfan f s reinterpretation, and attempts to demonstrate one way they may have been genetically as well as functionally in- tegrated in what amounts to a criticism of one of Bakhta and Seniuta's central proposi- tions. MODE OF PRODUCTION OF THE AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINES AND THE FORMATION OF THE LOCAL GROUP ("HORDE" OR "BAND" IN ANGLO - UNITED STATES USAGE) Bakhta and Senfuta ( 1972:69-70) start from an analysis of the Australian Aboriginal mode of production. It is the "classical example" of an acquisitive-type economy, in which vir- tually all necessities are satisfied directly from the surrounding natural environment. This applies not only to means of subsistence but to means of production as well, the bulk of which consist of modified natural objects (animal, plant, mineral), which are made to serve the Aborigines with the aid of ancillary implements that function as instruments of labor ("tools"). Thus, production of means of production is weakly developed, subject to the vagaries of nature. The extreme lack of development of the "pro- duction of means of production" is manifest in several ways. Firstly, in its domination, as already noted, by the natural properties of objects in the surrounding environment rather than by "!the fruits of human crea- tion1". Secondly, in the dependence of the entire technology on stones , which enter pro- duction both as "instruments of labor" with which nearly all objects of material culture are fashioned and as "means of production" in the acquisition of food and resources (i would add that most stones were employed either as picked up or only slightly modified, and that they were discarded as soon as the task had been completed, retention depending mainly upon availability and weight rather than use- fulness; on the seacoast, shells were substi- tuted). Thirdly, in the fact that the labor of one person was sufficient to fashion all means of production (digging stick and collect- ing tray, dart and womera, hair string bag, throwing sticks, fish spear, etc.): "labor cooperation has not yet enveloped the sphere of production of the means of production". Nor are they technically capable of being used by more than one person: "a spear or boomerang cannot be thrown by two or three persons at once.» nor a tree felled with a 3cf. Danilova, 1968; Kabo 1968; Butinov 1968; Semenov 19¿5 and 1968. It is in part the subject of essay number five in this collection.</page><page sequence="14">Howe: Soviet Theory and Method 97 single axe held in four or even three hands simultaneously" (Bakhta and Seniuta 1972:70; compare the giant dugout canoes of British Columbia and Alaska, huge fish weirs of an- cient Finland, or the hand-drawn stick plows of early Chinese cultivators, etc., all within the genre of "primitive technology"). Labor cooperation, therefore, cannot de- velop out of the technical properties of the means of production. Rather, it is engendered by the very weakness of their technology, the impotence of individual labor merely sup- plemented by a rude stick to scratch the earth or throwing staves and fragile dart shafts to kill swift game: "the Aborigines had but one way to compensate or substitute for the inade- quacy of their technological equipment: by combining individual labor effort". Combination historically takes two forms: within the labor process (e.g., game or fish surrounds, JH), and the division of labor. Of the latter, the Agorigines knew only the division by sex and age, and between groups of people occupying environments endowed with certain non-equivalent resources, that is, divisions within nature, hence, naturally evolved. Observing that both types of cooperation were widespread, the authors emphasize that the natural division by sex "is so consistently applied that at times even labor cooperation does not exceed its limits": e.g., men hunt and women collect; women gather firewood and maintain the fire, but only men may light it (Bakhta and Seniuta 1972:71). The naturally evolved primary economic unit formed by the combination of individual effort is the "local group" ("horde" of Rade li ff- Brown, "band" in current United States usage), "the real collective within which every Abori- gine passed his or her life". Inside the local group takes place "nearly the entire process of continuous social production". On the other hand, the local group is not a "closed economic collective" as Tolstov supposed (Tokarev and Tolstòv 1956:151), nor can it be: the natural division of labor extends beyond its borders. Thus, "mutual visiting by local groups" to exploit game, fish, or plants abundant locally in certain seasons or years was normal (Bakhta and Seniuta 1972:75-6). While it was the optimal unit of economic pro- duction on a given territory, the local group was too small to ensure continuous reproduc- tion of the individual, the objective of pro- duction activity. NON-ECONOMIC NUCLEAR FAMILY: PIVOT OF AUSTRALIAN SOCIAL RELATIONS AND STRUCTURAL NUCLEUS OF THE PRODUCTION COLLECTIVE Reproduction of the individual took place within the family, whose "central meaning and aim . . . among the Australian Aborigines" was the bearing and rearing of children in the first years: "the life of every Aborigine be- gan within and from the family" (Bakhta and Senfuta 1972 :8o). The local group was com- posed of families wandering together. While its maximum size was controlled by the number of people who could on the average obtain means of subsistance in each locality, the requirements of procreation and child-rearing also influenced size and composition of the local group. The group had to provide the conditions necessary for mothers to carry in the womb and give birth, and for the children to be reared and trained. Defense of the family and the territory essential to economic production were among these conditions. The provision of a man to form a family built around the sexual division of labor and the removal from within the group of fights between men over women, therefore, were both essential. Bakhta and Seniuta (1972: 82, 83-4) attempt to demonstrate that exogamy arose from the latter need, citing evidence to show that the threat of conflict between men vying for women was a constant stimulus to the extension and refinement of marriage rules. The end result was a system defined by "very strict norms, which in essence, thanks to complex sets of double, triple, even quadruple pro- hibitions and restrictions, led to the pre- determination of marriage pairs . . . the girls of each local group were distributed beforehand among the men of other local groups and vice versa." (Bakhta and Seniuta fail to point out that given the Australian mode of pro- duction, with its reliance on cooperation be- tween the sexes, in which gathering, primarily by women and children, supplied on a regular basis the greater share of the food, a man needed a woman to carry on normal economic activity: even her hair served him as an essential raw material!). The family is too weak to be considered an economic entity, even a secondary one, as Kabo (1968:21*1) considers it. Its survival depends wholly on the local group: Even when the Aboriginal family wanders in search of food isolated from the other fami- lies of its local group, it obtains this food on territory belonging equally to all Aborigines of this local group; moreover, that family is able to procure and utilize means of subsistance so acquired only be- cause its efforts are sanctioned and guaran- teed by the local group on whose territory they are procured. The aforesaid sanction and guarantee is none other than the material manifestation of the existence in Aboriginal society of economic relations, the subject of which is the local group. (Bakhta and Senilità 19?2:80-l).</page><page sequence="15">98 Arctic Anthropology XIII- 1 On the other hand, "once the family has formed, it "becomes the structural nucleus of the local group". As noted, the family has no economic viability outside the local group. It is defined not by relations of production as these are understood by political economy, but by relations for production of people ex- pressed as a kinship system. These latter have a natural, physiological foundation: the carnal relations between men and women, older and younger generations. Consequently, if the local group is dependent on economic relations, which it embodies, for its very existence, its structure is defined by non-economic rela- tions . Within the local group "two inter- eonnected, interpenetrating, yet genetically and functionally independent series of rela- tions" intersect (Bakhta and Senfuta 1972:90). KINSHIP RELATIONS DOMINATE OVER ECONOMIC RELATIONS While economic relations are manifest in the various ways individual labor is combined, they do not appear at the level of social structure. Marx's "naturally evolved commu- nity", the "primary condition of production", operates as physiological relations, estab- lishing bonds of kinship between participants in the labor process, both in the cooperation and division of labor. The Australian "can be a member of the local group, and thereby be- come incorporated into the economic life of his society, only after the kinship relation- ships between himself and the other members of that local group have been defined according to traditional rules" (Bakhta and Seniuta 1972:90). Kinship ties envelop "all of Australian society": "no matter where the Aborigine finds himself, he is able by defin- ing the degree and category of kinship to be- come incorporated in the social structure, even though the structure of his own tribe be entirely different". Moreover, since "each degree and category of kinship between two persons ... is accompanied by strictly ad- hered to characteristics relationships and mutual obligations", kinship for the Abori- gines is a real force governing his or her be- havior. Consequently, "the Aborigine con- ceives all of his interrelationships solely as relations of kinship" (Bakhta and Seniuta 1972:86). The fact that from the moment of birth and even before, each Aborigine finds him or her- self within some exogamous group that governs forever the groups within which the Aborigine may find consanguine and affinal relatives is a crucial feature of the system. "No change in his economic position, in the system of production relations, even resettlement in another local group, can alter his membership in the exogamous group to which he belongs by right of descent from his parents" (Bakhta and Seniuta 1972:86). A basic reason for this "domination" of relations for production of people over "relations for production of material wealth" is that "given the exogamy of economically independent collectives, so- cial relations for marriage must be more ex- tensive than social relations of production" (Bakhta and Senfuta 1972:85), the "restricted confines of the local groups (communes)" with- in which takes place "economic activity in Australian society" are too narrow to ensure reproduction of the individual. Consequently, bonds of kinship are "the real force holding together Australian society which without exaggeration can be said to envelop in their web nearly the entire Australian continent, transforming the at first glance chaotic world of Australian local groups into a single, if amorphous , scattered and heterogeneous society" (Bakhta and Seniuta 1972:90). YURIÍ SEMENOV fS ERRONEOUS INTERPRETATION OF AUSTRALIAN LAND- OWNERSHIP According to Bakhta and Seniuta, this ac- count explains the paradox that , while the local group is the real economic unit, hence, "owner" of the territory from which its members extract a living, the Australians themselves conceive the territory as divided up among non-economic totemic groups, formed on the basis of rules of exogamy and the relations flowing therefrom. Yurii Semenov (1968:222), chief protagonist of an original coincidence between consanguine kin group and economic commune in 1968 attempted to interpret this fact to his advantage. He wrote: "If the clan never was the production collective, but always represented only an organization for regulating marriage and family relations, then, we ask, how is it to be explained that the Australians, the Papuans, and so on, consider precisely the clan, not the commune, owner of the land?" To which Bakhta and Senfuta (1972: 90) reply, after analysing the ethnographic data adduced by Semenov to support his case: But that is just the point, and Austra- lian ethnography substantiates it : the clan is "considered by the Australians" to be owner of the land, but only by the Australians themselves. From the standpoint of political economy the situation is quite different. Exactly the same is true of the Pax&gt;uans.</page><page sequence="16">Howe: Soviet Theory and Method 99 RESHETOV fS CRITIQUE: BAKHTA AND SENIUTA ABSOLUTIZE ONE ASPECT, THE MOST APPARENT, OF KINSHIP RELATIONS While in general agreement -with Bakhta and Senfuta that neither the clan nor the "pairing family" was the "economic nucleus", economic relations being "forged in particular seasonal communes", Reshetov ( 1972:230, 235) objects that "it is impossible to consider the system of kinship an independent system of kinship an independent system of material relations of a non-economic nature". He observes that the group character of kinship terminology among the Australians and other hunter-gatherers has its origins less in kinship, in the sense we conceive it, than in similar position in so- ciety, marked by similar duties and obliga- tions. He notes that classificatory termi- nology "was extended to persons who stood in no relation of actual biological kinship, but who were bound together by common tasks within the collective" (Reshetov 1972:230). In so far as the classes were generational, this termi- nology "reflected the actual position and du- ties of particular age-groups of individuals in the primitive commune of hunters , gatherers and fishermen, in which the main thing was not factual biological kinship, but the identity of responsibilities within each group of the same age" (Reshetov 1972:229). Reshetov (1972:23*0 believes that "the ter- minology, which we at present narrowly construe as kinship, in fact reflected the complex structure of the primitive human collective from the moment of its origins; it not only re- flected kinship relations, but was a product of social, above all, economic ties, as well." He remarks that while superficially we per- ceive them in the form of kinship relations, in essence they reflect social relations much more broadly. He proposes that the "system of sharing duties among the generations developed in early stages of the formation of human so- ciety and had as its objective primarily dis- tribution of production functions among members of the collective". Originally, this distribu- tion was based on the real ages of members of the group. When the pairing family came into being, requiring a system for social equation of age and sex, "the accent of terminology was not so much on kinship ties as on age-sex similarities and differences" (Reshetov 1972: 232). He concludes: "This interpretation makes it possible to presume that this termi- nology by no means reflects the economic unity of the clan, as earlier proposed; rather it re- flects economic unity of the primitive collec- tive, the composition of which was not con- stant" (Reshetov 1972:23*0. SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF PRIMITIVE SOCIETY (Tokarev 1972:236-79) For reasons stated in the introduction, Tokarev fs interesting and original paper can- not be given the "full treatment" it deserves. What follows is a digest derived from Tokarev fs own summary on pages 276-79. For commentary I refer the reader to the review article by Ernest Gellner in Man, December 1973, es- pecially pages 5UO-U1. The underlying theme of Tokarev1 s paper is that: "The fundamental traits of human psychic activity are the same for all peoples and at all levels of historical development" (Tokarev 1972:276). As respects Levi-Bruhlfs theory of pre- logical thinking, the situation is more com- plex. While its interpretation to imply a fundamental division between "primitive" and "civilized" modes must be rejected, "it is difficult to deny that in the human environ- ment there exists a type of thinking that does not fit into logical forms: judgments and conjectures not subject to the control of logic, indifferent to contradiction" (Tokarev 1972:277). This is the realm of tradition-based social consciousness, beyond the limits of individual experience, "the sphere of Durkheim's collec- tive concepts". "It is manifest in the domi- nant religion, in traditional morality and public opinion. The boundary separating logi- cal from prelogical thinking . . . splits in half the consciousness of every individual, no matter to what ethnos he belongs" (Tokarev 1972:277). But of course the lower the general level of culture and, in the final analysis, the less developed material production and social relations are, the greater is the force of public opinion and norms of morality, the domination of religious views and evaluation of the surrounding world according to generally accepted precepts, and the weaker the power of healthy thinking against them. Only in this sense can we speak of the qualitative peculiarities of primitive consciousness . . . (One) of the most characteristic traits of what we term primitive social consciousness is its traditionalism, the predominance of routinized, established views, evalua- tions and habits over individual, criti- cal and rational views . . . The domi- nation of collective concepts ... in pre-class society is, naturally, only a reflection of collectivism in material life itself . . . " (Tokarev 1972:278). "The nondifferentiation of social conscious- ness in the pre-class epoch is an undoubted</page><page sequence="17">100 Arctic Anthropology XIII- 1 fact." Even in the modern era, differentia- tion is only relatively greater, although it is in general easier to discern. As respects primitive social conscious- ness, nondifferentiation is probably its most notable and essential attribute . . . (in) the realm of knowledge of the sur- rounding world healthy concepts are thickly coated with illusory ideas. It is not always possible to consign these various phenomena and levels of social consciousness strictly to the pigeon holes of our concepts of religion, art, positive knowledge, etc. . . . (This) nondifferentiation of primitive social consciousness was a lawful product of the nondifferentiation of production of material life, of social being itself: the social division of labor did not yet exist, mental labor was not separated from physical labor, the spheres of material production were not finely articulated, in social relations blood ties coincided (or were intertwined) with production relations, the organiza- tion of social government was not set off from society (Tokarev 1972:278). "But this in no way gives us the right to reduce . . . one sphere of primitive conscious- ness to another sphere: to derive primitive art from magic and religion, or from cogni- tive and communicative functions, to derive morals from religion, or the earliest real knowledge of nature from false illusory conceptions" . These different spheres, aspects or levels of social consciousness . . . in- termingle or even at times merge, but each has its own roots . Real knowledge of the world grew directly out of labor practice . . . from empirical experience, even if this was purely unpremeditated. The very limitations of this experience gave birth to illusory distorted notions, connected with magical acts and rites. Moral rules, norms of behavior, grew out of the elementary need of people to hold together and act in common . . . Finally, artistic activity, although from the very beginning connected with production activity pure and simple, with the demands of social consciousness, with false no- tions about nature, and with magical rituals, in its essence was rooted in the universal human need to create beauty and to take delight in it (Tokarev 1972 •* 279). PART II: COMMENTARY ON SIX SOVIET ESSAYS G. P. GRIGOR'EV, "RESTORING THE SOCIAL ORGANI- ZATION OF THE PALAEOLITHIC HUNTERS AND GATHERERS" ON EFIMENKO, VOLKOV, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOVIET PALAEOLITHIC ARCHAEOLOGY (see p. 85 this article) In so far as one can give credit to an in- dividual, Petr Petrovich Efimenko (188U-I969) deserves the title of "founder" of Soviet pre- historic archaeology, especially, Palaeolithic archaeology, although he also contributed much to prehistory of the Finnish-Slavic marchlands of Eastern Europe. However, neither his theoretical generalizations nor his methods and techniques of research vere quite as novel as they are sometimes portrayed. In his ideas and actions, Efimenko combined the traditional with new initiatives. Unlike many of the archaeologists and other social scientists who constitute the current Soviet intellectual "establishment", Efimenko had deep roots in the "best traditions of Soviet Pre-Revolutionary ethnography and archaeology. His parents, Petr Savich Efimenko and Alek- sandra Iakovlevna Stavrovskaia, were noted ethnographers, who when younger were both radi- cal Populists (his father and mother met in exile). Efimenko junior was trained in Palaeolithic prehistory by the ethnographer, anthropologist, archaeologist and political activist, Fedor Kandrat'evich Volkov (l8U7-19l8)9 whose con- tribution to the founding of Soviet theory and method in the study of the Palaeolithic was considerable. In his youth Volkov had been a close associate of Nikolai Ziber (Sieber), MarxTs first translator and interpreter to Russian audiences, together with whom Volkov wrote the program for a revolutionary organiza- tion advocating an independent democratic Ukraine. Forced to flee abroad not to return until the 1905 Revolution, he went to Paris, where he studied in Broca1 s school of anthro- pology under Manouvrier, beginning a close re- lationship with Gabriel de Mortili et, whose disciple he became. Both Manouvrier and de Morti Ile t were uncom- promising evolutionists, for whom the applica- tion of Darwinian principles to explain the origin and development of the human species was the victory of reason over superstition, and republicanism over clerical reaction. For Volkov (who frequently signed his name, Khvedor Vovk, in Ukrainian) the combination of science with radical Ukrainian nationalism was a response to the way the rulers of Russia treated evolutionism. Until the end of the Nineteenth Century, when industrialization of Russia began in</page><page sequence="18">Howe: Soviet Theory and Method 101 earnest and advocates of liberal democracy were coopted for or against the Marxist-led workers1 revolutionary movement, or else, fell silent, the natural sciences were "hotbeds of subversion" . In the heated atmosphere of Nineteenth Century Russia all discourse tended to be politicized. Tsarism was rooted in the Middle Ages: unswerving orthodoxy and blind faith in the Little Father were its essential creeds. To claim that all phenomena, includ- ing people and their society, come into being and change according to natural laws knowable and, therefore, controllable was as much a radi- cal world view as rationalism had been in France a century earlier. On the other hand, politicized science lends itself to crudification. Eternally vigilant to defend Mortillet's scheme of evo- lutionary stages in the Palaeolithic against reaction, Volkov called the Aurignacian a "priest's dream", seeing in Abbe Breuil's amended classification a plot to weaken evo- lutionism by diluting it. The dichotomy which isolated Palaeolithic studies, conducted in Russia mainly by natural scientists committed to evolutionism, from archaeology, governed by the Archaeological Commission of the Ministry of the Court (its Chairman was a member of the Tsar's family), and dedicated primarily to glorification of the Empire's past, was most militant with Volkov. When de Chelette in- cluded both Palaeolithic and Gaulo-Roman periods in the same handbook, Volkov objected on the grounds this "very much serves the interests of those 'archaeologists1 who refuse to accept paleoethnology as one of the natural sciences" (cited in Formozov 196l:8U). His contempt for the "dilettantism" which the near monopoly of archaeology by the well-born en- couraged sparked confrontations whenever he spoke to audiences which included archaeolo- gists (e.g., at the meeting of the Russian Archaeological Society, March IT» 1907). His approach to Palaeolithic sites as natural phenomena was detrimental to their study as remains of social organisms, but his insistence on methods compatible with science impressed on his students the need for meticulous ex- cavations and recording and a concern for col- lection of faunal, botanical and geological data. It is no accident that Soviet Palaeolithic archaeology developed in Leningrad and Kiev under the aegis of Volkov' s students and fol- lowers (Efimenko, Zamfatnin, Bonch-Osmolovski'i , Rudenko, Rudinskil) and not in Moscow, where Gorodtsov and Anuchin held sway. The latter, indeed very important figures in Russian pre- historic studies, were both too closely asso- ciated with the Pre-Revolutionary archaeologi- cal "establishment". Volkov and Anuchin, more- over, had clashed. In contrast to Moscow, where Count Uvarov and Anuchin had "coopted" Palaeolithic studies under the wing of the Moscow Archaeological Society and Gorodtsov had taught a course in prehistory at the Archaeological Institute in Petersburg, where the Archaeological Commission held sway, Palaeolithic studies had developed entirely apart from institutional archaeology. Volkov' s connections were with the Mathematics and Physics Faculty of Petersburg (now Lenin- grad) University and the ethnographic division of the Russian Museum. Through him and his students Russian and Ukrainian archaeology were linked, important because the Ukraine is the richest region in sites. Efimenko for many years headed the "paleoethnology" section of the Academy (later Institute) of the History of Material Culture, successor to the Archaeological Commission and predecessor of the Institute of Archaeology, responsible for coordinating all archaeological research in the USSR. By radicalizing the difference between the history of primitive society studied by "paleoethnology" (anthropology, ethnography and archaeology of the Stone Ages) and the establishment history to which official archaeology subscribed, Volkov had prepared his students to join the "cultural revolution". Soon they were to criticize their teacher for his "bourgeois narrowness", namely, his "mechanistic reduction" of human evolution to biological evolution, which hampered examina- tion of sites as anything more than natural phenomena. Marxist theory demands the dis- covery of sociological "laws" (tendencies), re- quiring a different approach to the study of sites, one that reveals information on the way people lived and related to each other. Al- though ultimately traceable to Pitt-Rivers' "total" excavations by grid-levels and, more immediately, to the techniques attempted by Khvoika at the Kiev Kirillovskafa Street site in the l890s and by Kashchenko at Tomsk in 1896, the methods and techniques evolved in the late 1920s and early 1930s by Soviet archaeologists with Efimenko at their head were in their day the world's most advanced, "previewing" Settlement Archaeology of two decades later. While the treatment of a site as the remains of the activities of a human group emphasized study of non-portable and relational arti- facts (soil/ash stains and relationships be- tween all finds within an occupational level) which creates a basis for inferences concerning social arrangements , the inferential machinery was inadequately developed. Worse: in their enthusiasm to demarcate themselves from "bour- geois ( Pre-Revolutionary) archaeology", the first generation of Soviet archaeologists seriously underestimated the importance of cultural-art i factual typology (curiously, an almost identical reaction against typological</page><page sequence="19">102 Arctic Anthropology XIII- 1 methods in the name of the discovery of socio- logical patterns has emerged in the past decade among "revolutionary" adherents to the New Archaeology in the United States, a fact re- marked with some amusement by several Soviet archaeologists). In the 1930s the charge of "thingizing" (veshchevedenie) even came to mean an ideological deviation (the "crime" of veshchevedenie was invented by Nikolai Marr, about whom I write elsewhere). Since formal classification is the primary analytical tool available to the archaeologist at the expiren- tial level, failure to recognize the logic of classifications had serious consequences. By- passing essential analytical steps, scientists attempted to infer social relations directly from objects, invariable involving themselves in speculative errors . Consequently, while the various hypotheses concerning evolution of the human species and its society had a base in the data, by the time they had been reduced to a "theory" in the 1930s, data were being tailored to concept rather than vice versa. Codified by Efimenko in 1938 (it was modified by him in 1953, in line with the Anti-Marrist revision), the generally accepted conceptualization of Palaeolithic human history was more in the tradition of speculative evolutionism than of Marxist historical materialism. New wine ended up in the old bottles. This is readily ap- parent from a resume of propositions under attack in this collection: 1) Technological (stone tool) and biologi- cal evolution of archaic humans was linked in a cause and effect train such that advances in stone-tool technology conditioned morphological advance of the stone tool makers. Correspond- ing to the progression from "Chellean" to "Upper Palaeolithic" technology took place the progression from "incompletely formed" Pithecanthropines to "completed" Sapientoid people . 2) The incompletely formed humans deter- mined by their insufficiently effective tech- nology were organized into groups in which re- lations were not wholly social. The bioevo- lutionary progression Pithecanthropoid- Neanderthaloid-Sapientoid was paralleled in Efimenko1 s interpretation by a socioevolution- ary progression "undifferentiated horde"-"con- sanguine horde"-"matriarchal clan". 3) Causal links were projected that bound each technological stage to a stage in forma- tion of consciousness and speech (Marr, Meshchanninov) . h) Fully differentiated cultural units could not exist prior to the Upper Palaeo- lithic, a corollary of the proposition that the formation of society was not completed until this time. Thus a priori "archaeologi- cal cultures", the supposed reflex of ethno- cultural distinctions, were unidentifiable on the basis of Lower and Middle Palaeolithic material. The possibilities of typological analysis were denied beforehand. Thus in the name of a rejection of biologi- cal reductionism, Soviet social philosophers of the period came up with schema perilously close to technological reductionism. Alien to Marx and attacked by Lenin, this way of think- ing had foundations in Pre-Marxist "material- ism" and, more to the point, in the writings of Volkov's friend, Nikolai Ziber, who in 1883 published the first analysis of primitive economy from a "Marxist" perspective, in which he attempted a direct equation between economic means and social structure. When in the 1930s the notion became fashionable (as Butinov re- marked in 1968:123, "Apparently not without the influence of factors outside the realm of science") that the matriarchal "clan" was the basic production unit of primitive society and, therefore, that the formation of social rela- tions was completed only with its appearance, the reasoning was closer to Ziber (and Kautsky) than to Marx and Engels. After all, in the Origin of the Family, Private 'Property and the State 3 Engels made abundantly clear that the clan arose only at a definite stage in the development of social relations, a stage not yet reached (according to him) by the Australian Aborigines, whose "society" was no less real. (The attempt to "adapt" Engels to the technological-evolutionist view- point is dealt with later.) The speculative evolutionist trend was strengthened by stressing "internal develop- ment" to the exclusion of migration and dif- fusion, denounced as "bourgeois deviations" in the most extreme statements. Breaks in the cultural succession were even interpreted as "proof" of this a priori assertion, signifying the transformation of "quantitative" change into a new "quality". Of course, few scientists carried speculative theorizing to such absurd limits. CONCERNING THE EXISTENCE OF THE SMALL FAMILY UNIT IN THE UPPER PALAEOLITHIC AND THE "HORDE" HYPOTHESIS (see p. 86, this issue) While Grigorfevfs argumentation, here given in part, is fresh and useful, his conclusion certainly comes as no surprise to most Western archaeologists. It has been held for some time that at the technological and cultural level of the Palaeolithic the survival of human groups would have been impossible with- out the existence of a minimal family insuring the services of an adult male to each mother- child unit, to create a social entity able to perform essential activities of self-support and to rear offspring, who for many years re-</page><page sequence="20">Howe: Soviet Theory and Method 103 mained helpless and were incapable of adapta- tion without purposeful acquisition of cul- ture, including language (Washburn and DeVore 1961:98-100; Sahlins I960: 76-87). Despite repeated attempts to discover other arrange- ments, basic family units have been found to exist in literally every primitive hunting- gathering society known. On the other hand, in the Soviet Union, while this proposition increasingly is accepted by archaeologists and ethnographers practically familiar with the evidence, it still must be defended against attempts speculatively to justify the thesis "that the clan in the early stages of its development was the form of or- ganization of social production, that kinship relations at this time fully coincided with production relations, that [as a result] mar- riage initially was dislocal and diseconomie" (Kabo 1972:62, referring to Iu. I. Semenov 1965 and 1968), i.e., that each "clan" (=commune, local group, "band") was composed solely of blood relatives, who as a group maintained a mutual bond with another clan, which they periodically visited "for purposes of pro- creation" . The notion of the clan as a production collective in the above form was developed and defended by Yurii Semenov in conjunction with his attempt to "modernize" the horde- stage hypothesis inferentially criticized by Grigorfev (see p. 87 this article). Semenov accomplished this revamping by the elimination of logical inconsistencies and the expansion of the hypothesis into a full-scale schema of the anthropo socio stage of evolution (Semenov 1966, 1968a). This ingenious and persuasive picture, given the present state of our knowledge, must be recognized to be a retreat into speculative philosophy, transforming what were once ingenious guesses into an immutable system of concepts. Although the entire exercise is superficially an exigesis in dialectical thinking and Marx, Engels and Lenin are extensively quoted, they would hardly have condoned it. Seen in this light it is understandable why some Soviet scientists are reluctant to cite from the Marxist classics. To assume they have turned from Marxism-Leninism would be erroneous. On the contrary, striving to over- come the scholasticism which for some years beset Marxist theory and practice, they wish to avoid substitution for reasoned argumenta- tion of appeals to the authority of the texts that stifle debate. The fact that both author and reader are likely to be acquainted with any citation also tends to endow an exercise in textualism with an aura of condescension. Three generations after the October Revolution, a Marxian frame of reference is sufficiently part of the average scientist's thinking that he feels no compulsion to flaunt his knowledge, as was done by the first generation of Soviet scholars, to whom Marxian theory represented a radical break with tradition. L. P. KHLOBYSTIN, "PROBLEMS OF THE SOCIOLOGY OF THE NEOLITHIC OF NORTHERN EUROPE" INTRODUCTORY TEXTBOOKS ON PREHISTORY AND PRIMITIVE SOCIETY AND REQUIRED COURSES IN THE SYLLABUS OF HISTORY DEPARTMENTS OF SOVIET UNIVERSITIES (see p. 88 this article) All students in the history department (faculty) are required to take introductory courses in the history of primitive society during their first two years; those who specialize in archaeology or ethnography, both part of the department , must in addition take courses in general ethnography and archaeology of the USSR. Thus these textbooks are de- signed to orient students in the subject. Since they impart a theoretical overview, they must be ideologically clear. The divergence between accepted ideological positions learned at the introductory level and the scientifi- cally indicated position discovered at the level of specialization apparently can be confusing, and "turns off" some students from theory, while influencing others to question ideological statements on other subjects as well. It is only fair to note, however, that the traditional conception of primitive society occurring in the specific works mentioned re- flects a consensus of older faculty, who leave room for disagreement. Both the Avdusin and the Pershi€s, Mongait, Alekseev texts generally serve their purpose as well as do good intro- ductory texts in the United States (I am not familiar with Belanovskaia ) . Yet it is probably correct to say that no other view of primitive society would at present be accept- able to the Ministry of Higher Education. In other institutions of higher learning, for in- stance, those preparing teachers for grade schools, and, therefore, not specialist ethno- graphers or archaeologists but guides to the education of Soviet youth, the conventional view is presented more rigidly, with great stress on its ideological content, e.g., Goremykhina 1967:56-81. ADDENDUM TO ANALYSIS OF KHLOBYSTIN'S ARGUMENTA- TION: CURRENT TECHNICAL OBSTACLES IMPEDING EVOLUTION OF METHODS IN USSR (see p. 90 this article) One reason for the weakness of Khlobystin's argumentation by our current standards is that, whereas in the United States the new</page><page sequence="21">104 Arctic Anthropology XIII- 1 methods have had to withstand a decade of criticism, the critique has only "begun in the USSR, and unfortunately has been undertaken mostly "by persons defending even more specula- tive methods. Epistemologie al problems of classification, the archaeologist's primary analytical tool, are only now being considered, and the relative unavailability of computers to Soviet archaeologists will undoubtedly slow down the process of developing a testable ex- planatory apparatus able to handle efficiently the vastly expanded flow of information that must be considered. L. G. GERTSENBERG, "CONCERNING THE LINGUISTIC LANDSCAPE IN THE EARLIEST EPOCH. THE "ORIGINAL LINGUISTIC CONTINUUM" HYPOTHESIS AND "MARRISM" (see p. 91 this article) As an hypothesis the "Original Linguistic Continuum" seems to have been first enunciated by S. P. Tolstov, leading Moscow ethnographer, in the 19^0s. In essence it contended that originally a single linguistic community formed of an uninterrupted chain of dialects existed, whereby differences in speech increased out- ward from any point. While immediate neighbors fully comprehended each other, comprehension de- clined between groups once removed, disappear- ing completely at several removes (A. A. Leont'ev 1963). This model was derived in part from analogy with the supposed situation in Australia and New Guinea described by ethnographer (cf. Butinov 1951). In the words of Tolstov, the study of the languages of Australia is "excep- tionally interesting, since they apparently represent a comparatively early stage in the history of human speech: the Australians them- selves are among the most backward peoples , and it is essential to establish to what degree this is reflected in their language" {Narody Avstralii 1956:78). This formulation sounds quite "Marrist", and it is not surprising that during the denunciations and forced self- criticism which followed publication of Stalin's pamphlet, Tolstov was included. In the spirit of the times, it was said that, "The hypothesis of a 'linguistic continuum* advanced by S. P. Tolstov, which is an effort to avoid acknowledging an original 'parent language' and people, its creator and bearer, together defin- ing the ethnic communities in the course of history, is a straight forward attempt to mask the dragging of Marr's anti-scientific views into science, an attempt to revise Stalin's position" (Protiv vulgarizatsii . . . 1953:6). It is interesting that Gerstenberg decries the "linguistic continuum" notion for just the opposite reason that it was denounced in 1953. While Marr's ideas inflicted some harm on Soviet historical science, it was in no way comparable to Lysenko's damage to genetics. Marr died in 193**; hence, whatever "power" he had after that date was exercised in his name by other men, who had their own reasons to be his "followers". Marr of the "personality cult" was in fact a rather mythical figure, and he cannot be said to have fathered the speculative trend in Soviet ethnography and archaeology of the Stalin period. The motives for Stalin's attack on "Marrism" in 19^-9 remain obscure, but among them, perhaps, was the continuation of the assault on the intelligencia initiated by Zhdanov in 19^6-^7, culminating in the massive repressions of 19^9-50. Marr had worked in Leningrad, where he headed the Institute of the History of Material Culture. The Lenin- grader, V. I. Ravdonikas, chief victim of the "purge" in the field of history of primitive society, had great prestige as a leading theoretician. Since Ravdonikas was leader of Leningrad archaeology, most other offenders were Leningraders . In the ancient rivalry between Leningrad and Moscow "schools", the prestige of Marr had been used against the latter: hence, leading Moscovites became protagonists in the revision. (it is note- worthy that S. P. Tolstov, despite the criti- cism leveled against him, refused to abandon his views: he was a Moscovite. On the other hand, although the Leningraders, Ravdonikas and Meshchannivov, principle targets of the campaign, were forced into retirement, neither was physically repressed; on the contrary, both received the sizeable pensions due them as members of the Academy of Sciences.) It seems possible that Stalin also was dis- turbed by Marr's ant i -nationalist and anti- chauvinist insistence that languages and ethnos are hybrid, emerging from the comingling of ethnic groups, to which Stalin opposed the notion that in any such mingling one people and language usually emerged as victors, conquerors (Stalin 1951:29-30) . Specifically, Marr's followers had depicted the Russians as a hybrid ethnolinguistic community formed out of a comingling of Slavs, Baits and Finns, which contradicted Stalin's policy proclaim- ing the Russian language and culture the foun- dation of the "Soviet nation of a new type". V. R. KABO, "THE HISTORY OF PRIMITIVE SOCIETY AND ETHNOGRAPHY (CONTRIBUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE PAST FROM ETHNO- GRAPHIC DATA)" At the outset I should note I have taken the liberty to expand somewhat on Kabo's sophisticated arguments, in the belief that the reader unfamiliar with Marxism and its intellectual history will find the essay easier</page><page sequence="22">Howe: Soviet Theory and Method 105 to grasp. But I have altered nothing in the process - the ideas are Kabofs. The dif- ference is one between abbreviation and the whole sentence. CONCERNING THE APPLICATION OF MARXIST "METHODS OF COMPARATIVE RESEARCH" TO THE STUDY OF THE HISTORY OF KINSHIP-STRUCTURED SOCIETY: A PERCEPTION OF THE ISSUE IN SOVIET PHILOSOPHY (see p. 9^ this article) In the post-Stalin period, the difference between proclamation of Marxian concepts and their application in specific research became a central concern of thinkers in the USSR. As a result of the "freezing" of notions in what- ever configuration they took at the moment dis- cussions were cut off and they became incor- porated in the ideological line, partial theories about particular phenomena were trans- lated along with general theories into immuta- ble schema, applied like formulae to explain the behavior of everything in existence. The critical interaction of theory with practice broke down. Philosophically dialectics and the dia- lectical method were fused into an absolute identity, while dialectical logic disappeared: dialectical thinking was frowned upon. Conse- quently, some philosophers in the 1960s sought to differentiate between dialectics, as the science of the most universal laws of develop- ment, the dialectical method, applying the propositions of dialectics in the process of thinking, and dialectical logic, which studies the dialectical method and dialectical thinking in general to discern its properties and how they function in cognition. In the words of Mitrofan Alekseev (l960:29): the dialectical method . . . and dialec- tics as a science are not the same. Con- sequently, knowledge of the latter by no means guarantees knowledge of the former, much less the ability to employ dialectics in practice. The dialectical method ... is the application of the propositions of dialectics to concrete problems of research. This application is a difficult business, not accessible to all and sundry. At least not everyone successfully utilized the general propositions and inferences of dialec- tics in the process of investigation. This is why the propositions and general- izations of the science of dialectics do not in themselves yield the dialectical method. Enormous effort must be expended to obtain the latter, effort that embraces not only the dialectic of the object of research, but also the specific way it is reflected in thinking: that is, there must be dialectical think- ing. Kabo is here concerned to overcome theoriz- ing that, no matter how logical and elegant it appears, does not achieve the dialectical method, because the specific properties of the objects of research have not "conditioned" the research process. To obtain the dialectical method, principles for revealing the universal "laws" of social development within the uni- verse of data disclosed by ethnography and archaeology must be worked out. Kabo attempts to formulate some of these principles. APPLICATION OF MARXIST "METHODS OF COMPARATIVE RESEARCH" CONTINUED: CRITIQUE OF THE METHODS OF YURII SEMENOV (see p. 95 this article) Kabo and other writers in this collection direct their fire at Yuril Seme*nov because he epitomizes all that was wrong in the old ap- proach. He is at the same time an original, even daring, thinker and a consummate polemist what a vast fund of knowledge and a keen sense of logic, who expends his talents mainly to rationalize the traditional ideological view- point. He sits on the editorial board of the journal, Soviet Ethnography , assuring that his ideas will find a publisher. All of which makes him an influential figure, who cannot be lightly dismissed or disregarded. Unfortunately, in the conditions prevailing in the Soviet social sciences, his influence is generally pernicious, lending prestige to a method that obstructs inquiry, even though he disposes of some tenaciously held secondary claims of supporters of this method (e.g., absence of conscious activity and articulate speech prior to the Upper Palaeolithic). The point is he dumps these claims by replacing "some speculative links in the system by others, no less hypothetical and speculative" (Kabo 1972:56) in order to preserve it. As Kabo observes : "What at one time was the re- sult of the immaturity of science is not justi- fied today." Some ethnographers and archaeologists have from the outset disputed Semenov, objecting less to his theories per se (they are usually well constructed) than to his method, particu- larly to his use of data. The crux of the dispute, therefore, is not particularly notions but the relationship of theory and practice alluded to above. For a list of a few more important writings of Semgnov (his publica- tions are numerous), see the bibliography.</page><page sequence="23">106 Arctic Anthropology XIII- 1 B. M. BAKHTA AND T. V. SENIUTA, "THE LOCAL GROUP, FAMILY^ AND TIES OF KINSHIP IN AUS- TRALIAN ABORIGINAL SOCIETY" TÈR-AKOPfAN'S REVELATIONS: HOW ENGELS WAS "CORRECTED" TO CONFORM WITH ECONOMIC DETERMINISM (see p. 96 this article) To appreciate the novelty and purpose of Bakhta and Senfuta's paper, the reader should be familiar with Tér-Akopfan f s re-evaluation of Marx and Engels1 views. Here, then, is a summary of Tèr-Akopian1 s position, to which I append some remarks. Tèr-Akopian contends that the interpreta- tion of primitive society introduced during the 19^03 as one whose development was defined by relations of economic production on analogy with class society does not accord with Marx and Engels1 ideas. Commencing with the German Ideology, the work which is supposed to mark their arrival at "Marxism", Marx and Engels distinguished "the family" (the relation be- tween husband and wife and between parents and children) as a determining relation, and in the beginning, as the "sole social relation", which forms one of the three principle aspects of social activity. While at the foundation of the development of human society lies the production of means of subsistence, in the oldest social formation the determinate factor in development of this production was the growth of population based on "reproduction of people within the family". Some forty years later, when ethnographic data had become available, "the family" was replaced by "blood ties" (bonds of kinship), and Engels advanced the proposition of the decisive role of kin- ship ties in the history of primitive society. In The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, and even earlier in letters to Marx and Kautsky,4 Engels upheld ^Because of the controversial nature of this analysis, the relevant passages of Engels1 letters are reproduced below: "In order finally to get clear about the parallel between the Germans of Tacitus and the American Redskins I have made some gentle extractions from the first volume of your Bancroft [The Native Races of the Pacific States}. The similarity is indeed all the more surprising be- cause the method of production is so fundamentally different - here hunters and fishers without cattle raising or agriculture, there nomadic cattle- raising passing into agriculture. It just proves how at this stage the method of production is less decisive than the degree in which the old blood ties and the old community of the sexes within the decisive role of the dissolution of social relations based on kinship ties in the transi- tion from the "Archaic" formation to class society. He attempted to demonstrate that development of labor and of bonds of kinship are inversely proportionate. "Consequently, in the primitive era the degree of dissolution of blood ties was a more adequate index of the level of development than the mode of produc- tion, which often was defined primarily by the ecological circumstances of a given locality". What is more, kinship ties "were the index of development of primitive society because they arose in the course of another type of produc- tion more vital to this society than produc- tion of means of subsistence: the production of people themselves" (Tèr-Akopian 1968:82-3). Of these two types of production, Only the first belongs to economics proper. It gave birth to production re- lations, i.e., to economic relations with- in society. The second aspect or type of production, reproduction of the person, engendered kinship, on the foundation of which the institution of the clan took shape at a certain level of development. In so far as the interrelationship of the two aspects or types of production is inversely proportionate, the inference can evidently be made that there was a period in the formation of human society when this second non-economic aspect of production dominated over the first or economic aspect. A second inference is possible. If kinship relations are engendered not by production of the first type, not by economic production, they cannot be considered production re- the tribe have been dissolved. Other- wise the Tlinkit in the former Russian America could not be the exact counter- part of the Germanic tribes ..." (Engels to Marx, Dec. 8, 1882, in Marx and Engels 191+2:U05-6) . "It is not barbarism that establishes the primitive character of a society, but, rather, the degree of integrity of the old blood ties in the tribe" (Engels1 reply to Kautsky's attempt to describe primitive societies purely in economic terms, employing such concepts as bar- barism defined as an economic category; translation according to Levi-Strauss 1967:3^2; both letters are cited by Tèr-Akopian 1968 : 80-l ) . 5"Production of people" is understood not simply in the physiological sense but connotes production of human beings as social entities, reproduction of society in its members; cf. Danilova 1968:35, fn. 9, and also the present report, p. 108.</page><page sequence="24">Howe: Soviet Theory and Method 107 lations in the usual meaning of this term . . . The development of all produc- tion, including economic production, took place within the framework of governing kinship relations, within the constitution of the kinship social order (Tér-Akopían 1968:83). Primitive society, therefore, knew another type of development than that characteristic of later systems. In Capital, Marx referred to the earlier period as "prehistory" (Vorgeschichte); in the Grundrisse (Marx 1973: 107; translated from Russian 1939 edition, p. 733) he observed that: "Peoples engaged ex- clusively in hunting and fishing are located beyond the point where real development be- gins" (Russian edition, page 733; I have yet to locate it in the English translation), to which Tèr-Akopfan (l968:7U) adds by way of ex- planation: People engaged only in hunting, fishing and gathering reproduce themselves, but not their means of subsistence (which are reproduced by Nature - JH). Production of the period of savagery remains outside of economic, hence, historical criteria. It seems to me, therefore, that Stephan Dunn, in the course of his otherwise excellent review of a seminal work in the new theoreti- cal generalization, Problems of the History of Pre-Capitalist Societies (a journal of the same name served as the forum in which the first generation of Soviet historians of primi- tive and early class societies developed the original theoretical generalization during the 1930s) commits a serious error in regard to Tér-Akopían f s efforts and that of other Soviet ethnographers to develop a Marxist analysis of primitive society. Dunn (1971:828) claims : Until very recently, the positions taken by Engels in the Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State . . . have been the controlling ones in Soviet anthropology . . . The present volume shows that these positions have now come into serious question. In fact, some of its contributors express views that, if they prevail, will have the effect of re- moving the entire primitive world from the sphere of operation of Marxist laws, at which point he refers to several pages of Tèr-Akopfan ' s (1968:83-5) paper. I cannot imagine why Dunn would assert that the view of Tèr-Akopfan, Butinov, Bakhta, Danilova, Gurevich (whom he must have had in mind) "will have the effect of removing the entire primitive world from the sphere of opera- tion of Marxist laws" unless he conceives Marxism to be some sort of mechanistic, reduc- tionist system similar to the "economic materialism" foisted on Marx and Engels by N. M. Mikhailovskii, the Narodnik ("Populist") sociologist, which Lenin (19^3; original I89M castigated in his first major published work. Dunn probably is unaware that a debate has raged among Marxists beginning with Engels1 critique of Kautsky in the l880s over Marx and Engels' conception of the primitive social dynamic. When Tèr-Akopfan (1968:68) terms the "mode of (economic) production" interpretation forced on Engels during the Stalin era a "vulgar economic materialist" revision, he is in essential agreement with Lenin's position in the aforementioned debate. Lenin, unlike some authoritative Soviet philosopher of the Stalin era (e.g., Svetlov, Iudin), who undoubtedly took their cue from Stalin's (19^0) own Dialectical and Historical Materialism, found no difficulty in Engels1 notion that (according to Lenin) in "prehistoric times" "the determining factor is the produc- tion of the human species itself, i.e., pro- creation, which played the primary role in the primitive era, when the productivity of labor was still very undeveloped", a notion that Mikhailovskii had used to attack Engels , on the grounds the latter had seized on the non- economic factor, procreation, "in order to preserve at least a verbal connection with the basic formula of economic materialism" , to which Lenin (19^3:^30-31) replied: But where have you read in Marx and Engels that they necessarily spoke of economic materialism? When they describe their world view they call it simply materialist . . . The explanation of political and legal forms [Marx says] must be sought in "the material rela- tions of life". Mr. Mikhailovskii surely does not think that relations of procreation are ideological rela- tions? Compare this with the following from Arkhiv Marksa I Engel'sa, Vol. IX: Engels asserted that the social order in which people of a particular society live is conditioned both by the level of development of labor and of the family. This proposition is obviously false, be- cause the family cannot be put in the same rank as material production as the determining factor. The determin- ing- factor of social development is the mode of production (l9^1:iv-v; emphasis in original) . or this (introduction to the 19^9 edi- tion of Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State :h) : When he placed continuation of the kin- ship group and production of the means of subsistence side by side as causal factors defining the development of</page><page sequence="25">108 Arctic Anthropology XIII-1 society and the social order [Engels] was guilty of an inaccuracy. Consequently, it was felt necessary to "correct" Engels on this point, as well as to alter the expression, "bonds of kinship" (Geschlechts"bande) to "kinship groups", or "clans", to agree with the prevailing theory that "completed" human society began with the matriarchal clan, as is evident from the translations of Origin^of the Family . . . published during the period, including the English translation first issued by Inter- national Publishers in 19^2, and since fre- quently republished. Thus the last clause in the sentence from the preface to the first edition, page six of the 19*+2 translation, which reads : The lower the development and the more limited the amount of its products, and consequently, the more limited also the wealth of the society, the more the so- cial order is found to be dominated by kinship groups. correctly translated reads: "the more the so- cial order is found to be dependent on bonds of kinship". From the above, it should be apparent that "the positions taken by Engels in Origin of the Family y Private Property and the State" have not been "the controlling ones in Soviet anthropology", at least in the decisive ques- tion of the governing social relations of primitive society. In the West, Claude Lévi-Strauss as far back as the early 1950s sought to reassert the original postulates of Marx and Engels in a manner parallel to Tèr-Akopfan (there is no doubt the efforts are independent of each other). In reply to those among his critics who hold to the "economic materialism" inter- pretation, Lévi-Strauss (1967:333) remarked that, "Marx and Engels frequently express the idea that primitive . . . societies are governed by 'blood ties1 (which, today, we call kinship systems) and not by economic relations". POVERTY OF PRIMITIVE TECHNOLOGY AS THE BASIS FOR RELATIONS OF PRODUCTION (see p. 96 this article) In the Grundrisse Marx (1973) had related the weakness of technology to the organization of production in a more general way. The is- sue is not so much one of cooperation within the labor process, which assumes a certain technological preparedness, but a different relationship of technology to production, hence, of human beings to nature. Technology does not mediate the relationship; rather, "The community itself appears as the first great force of production ..." We have an original unity between a specific form of community or tribal unit and the property in nature connected to it, or of the relation to the objective condition of existence as naturally existing ["antecedent to his activity"] as the objective being of individuals by means of the community. Now this unity . . . has its living reality in a speci- fic mode of production itself, and this mode appears equally as the relationship of the individuals to one another and as their specific daily behavior towards inorganic nature, their specific mode of labor (which is always family labor and often communal labor) (Marx 1965: 9U-5). Membership in a naturally evolved society s a tribe, etc., is a natural condition of production for the living individual . . . (Marx 1965:90; emphasis in original). Contained in these cryptic Hegelian- flavored sentences are key fragments of a theory of primitive society differing from conventional "Marxist" wisdom. Technology determines production in the negative, by its weakness. Marx deduces from this non- mediation the non-alienation of people in primitive society, their connectedness to nature "as the objective being of individuals by means of the community". Then he translates Hegelian "non-alienation" into "a specific mode of production", which is simultaneously a system of relationships between people and with nature such that the community reflects in its form the attributes of the "property in nature" which is for its members the condition of their production. In contemporary language, the system is "functionally adaptive". Employing this criterion of functional adaptation, if both are equally "efficient" we cannot distinguish developmentally between a community of hunter-gatherers and of primi- tive horticulturalists : the difference re- flects different "properties in nature" rather than "techno-economic progress". Which places in new perspective the famous dictum that "all history is the history of class struggle". Evidently, Marx was being literal. Of course, technological progress did occur. But we cannot use it to measure social progress directly so long as "The community itself" is the primary force of production. The original society is "naturally evolved" genetically because it arose in the biological herd of prehominids and structurally because bonds of kin create a society that is the "natural condition of production for the living individual", in which labor is "always family and often communal". The "economic object" of all pre-industrial communities "is the production of use values, i.e., the reproduction</page><page sequence="26">Howe: Soviet Theory and Method 209 of the individual" "in and together with these objective conditions of his existence" (Marx: 1965:80, 95; emphasis in original). The "ob- jective conditions" for early society are: l) maintenance of the community of kin and; 2) the "property in nature" to which this community is connected. So far as the first is concerned, it is simultaneously a "specific daily behavior towards nature", i.e., subsistence activities in both practical and ritual aspects, and the body of kin relatives who form the natural com- munity which is "the first great force of production". Clearly Marx did not equate this "community" with "communal labor". Recently it has been suggested that to survive as an ethno-cultural entity a primitive community must number not less than UOO persons (Gould 1969). This is more than ten times the size of the average band of hunter-gatherers , which Bakhta and Seniuta hold is the primary unit of economic cooperation. It is the social and technical wisdom of this community, the knowledge and skills it has developed embodied in social (including ceremonial) roles, organized by the natural division of labor by sex and age, and integrated horizontally by the marriage family and ver- tically by the kin family, which are reproduced in the individual. As for "reproduction of the means of production", the "instruments of labor" do little more than objectify the in- dividual's technical mastery, while reproduc- tion of the "functional adaptation" of the community which is its specific relationship to nature preserves the natural conditions of labor on which the mode of production depends. Since the "naturally evolved society" struc- tured by kinship is simultaneously the primary force of production, kinship bonds comprise an identity of social and economic relations. Pro- duction as a whole is structured by reproduc- tion of the individual "in and together with these objective conditions of his existence". Consequently, kinslaip relations cannot be said to belong either to superstructure or base . Which brings us to the most radical depar- ture from conventional thinking inferable from this account of Marx's reasoning: the non- existence in primitive society of the so-called "base-superstructure" dichotomy. Social bonds appear, on the one hand, as relations of in- dividuals to one another, and, on the other hand, as their specific relationship to nature "by means of the community". The knowledge people in this society have of nature is simultaneously their knowledge of society, i.e., the primitive "world-view" and the social fund of knowledge about the world integrate as a dialectical identity. When he remarked that nature appears "as the objective being of in- dividuals by means of the community" , such as occurs in so-called totemic notions , Marx indicated the social -psychological conse- quences of such an identity expressing the non-alienation of people in kinship-structured society. It follows logically that differentiation of "base" and "superstructure" constitutes the determinate dialectic of the stage of the "naturally evolved society". Emergence of the social division of labor disrupting the original unity of social knowledge and social consciousness would be the decisive moment in transition to "socially formed society", which is initially politically structured. Thus 20 years prior to reading Morgan, Marx had conceived by abstraction according to his general theory of history an interpretation of social evolution which was, indeed, "bril- laintly confirmed by Morgan" (Engels). He saw in Morgan's account of the emergence of political society within kinship-structured society the concreti zat ion of his own ideas. PROPERTY IN "NATURALLY EVOLVED SOCIETY" (see p. 98 this article) In line with the concept that the community itself of "naturally evolved society" mediated the relationship to nature, Marx perceived primitive property somewhat differently. Property, therefore, means belonging to a tribe (community) . . . and by means of the relationship of this community to the land, to the earth as its inorganic body, there occurs the relationship of the individual to the land, to the ex- ternal primary conditions of production (for the earth is at the same time raw material, tool and fruit) - as the pre- condition belonging to his individuality, as its mode of existence. We reduce this property to the relationship to the conditions of production (Marx 1965:91; emphasis in original). Clearly, restriction of this basic "re- lationship to the conditions of production" to the "local group" is a narrower interpreta- tion of "community" than what Marx had in mind. ABANDONMENT BY SIBERIA'S LEADING ETHNO- GRAPHER OF THE ECONOMIC-TERRITORIAL INTERPRETATION OF THE CLANS OF TUNGUS HUNTER-GATHERERS (see p. 98 this article) Among the ethnographic studies dealing with the application of theory to specific data in the collection reviewed is the paper by Vasilevich, dean of Siberian ethnographers, which complements the Bakhta-Senfuta paper.</page><page sequence="27">110 Arctic Anthropology XIII- 1- Although space and my stated intention to analyse only the theory and method papers pre- cluded its inclusion in Part I, a rough summary is merited as a contribution to this commentary. Vasilevich1 s (l972:l60-7l) paper, "Several Questions of the Tribe and Clan Among the Evenk", apparently constitutes her promised chapter on clan and tribe that she was unable to incorporate in her monograph (Vasilevich 1969; she has to her credit about fifty published works on different aspects of Evenk ethnography). In it she radically revises her earlier interpretation, written in the 19^+0s, which forms part of the chapter on the Evenk in the compendium, Narody Sibiri, published in 1956 as one of the first studies in the s event e en- volume series, Narody Mira. È tno grafiche skie Ocherki ("Peoples of the World" Ethnographic Studies"; in the abridged translation of Parody Sibiri, issued in 196U under the title, Peoples of Siberia^ the rele- vant pages are 6U3-1+5). She writes: In so far as the material of the various sources (historical, folklore and lin- guistic) was not at the time carefully analysed, and reconstruction of the over- all picture proceeded from the generally accepted history of the clan and the tribe, a number of propositions . . . must be rejected (Vasilevich 1972 :l6l). The view that accorded with "the generally accepted history of the clan and tribe" grouped the Evenk in the period of initial penetration of Siberia by the Russians into clans func- tioning as economic-territorial units, which were anciently joined at a higher level into three tribes understood as political as well as ethnic formations. Now Vasilevich would group the Evenks on much more solid evidence into non-territorial and non-economic clans that grew out of and united patrilineal- patrilateral extended families, while she sug- gests that the evidence that tribes ever existed except in the purely ethnic sense is too slim to be trusted. The resulting picture in its fundamentals resembles closely Fred Eggan's ( 1966:78-111) interpretation of the relationship between sub- sistence and social structure of northern Al- gonkians living in nearly identical ecological conditions (Evenk hunters of the Siberian taiga versus Ojibwa-Cree-Naskapi hunters of the Canadian boreal forests). A. M. RESHETOV, "SEVERAL OBSERVATIONS CONCERN- ING SYSTEMS OF KINSHIP" CONCERNING THE STABILITY OF THE LOCAL GROUP ("COMMUNE"), THE FORMATION OF ECONOMIC RELATIONS AND PRIMITIVE PROPERTY (see p. 99 this article) Bakhta and Seniuta dispute the notion that the local group is "seasonal" or otherwise im- permanent , found in the writings of Kabo (1968:21+1-2) and Butinov ( I960: 121-2 ), the leading Soviet authorities on the Australian Aborigines and the Papuans, respectively. Bakhta and Seniuta (1972:78-9) observe: The assertion that the membership of the local group varies seasonally, that it is a group of people jointly obtaining food, would seem to contradict to some extent the concept of the local group as the collective owner of a defined terri- tory. Territory, after all, does not change from season to season. It is evident that a group of Aborigines at any moment jointly procuring means of subsistence does not yet constitute an economic unit of society on the order of the local group. The existence of a local group ("band") more permanent than the union of the families comprising it seems to be necessary to Bakhta and Seniuta1 s thesis of independent economic and carnal relations. Their point of view has much in common with Service (1962). It is no small matter, therefore, that the in- terpretation of Kabo and Butinov, repeated here by Reshetov, apparently accords better with the data, such as it is. The difficulty may lie in a confusion be- tween relations entered into to carry out a particular type of subsistence activity defined by the community's "adaptation" to a specific environment and the relationship to nature as the general condition of production. "Terri- tory" exists more in the latter sense than in the former, and according to Marx (in the quotation cited earlier) its ownership "means belonging to a tribe (community)", i.e., property is invested in the community of kin comprising the specific "naturally evolved society" . The precise locus of ownership would de- pend, therefore, on the form given to the community by its "adaptation". If the re- sources on which the community depends do not permit regular concentration at any one point in its territory, families are most likely to enter into temporary alliances based on the availability of food, and ownership is unlikely to be fixed in any particular alliance. This was the usual pattern in the Great Basin. On the other hand, in New Guinea where arable land</page><page sequence="28">Howe: Soviet Theory and Method ill had to be won from the jungles and mountains and defended against other groups, local group territoriality was usual. In the Great Basin the community of kin was also not usually fixed territorially, while in New Guinea, it usually was. Australia was ecologically and socially somewhere between these extremes. Therefore, it is probably just as untenable to presume property resides in the local group (although it may) as it is to presume the "clan" owns the communal territory. Nonethe- less, Bakhta and Senfuta are closer to the facts in that the "clan" is never the true subject of the relationship to the land as the condition of production - not even when "clan" and "local group" coincide. The local group as an organization of production and the com- munity of kin as the primary force of produc- tion are structural features of primitive society, while the "clan" is an institution developed within this structural framework. Yet when the Australian professes that the territory belongs to the totem "clan", is he not saying it is "the objective being of the individual by means of the community"? In Aus- tralia the "naturally evolved society" achieved its identity in the totem "clan" . "Political economy" , which requires that we recognize the "clan" is not an organization of production, also requires that we recognize the "local group" is not coextensive with the "naturally evolved society" mediating the individual's relationship to the objective condition of her/his existence. Both from the standpoint of Marxfs general theory and on the basis of the evidence from surviving kinship-structured societies, it seems futile to attempt to isolate a special category of economic relations formed inde- pendently of "natural" relations conceived as kin. Neither the "local group" of Bakhta- Seniuta nor the "clan" of Semenov is the sub- ject of these much sought after economic rela- tions. Then why do scientists of undoubted erudition and great talent for theory persist in the search for non-existent phenomena? Because they must exist for the "base" and "superstructure" to exist. In other words, it is the assumption of the existence of a base- superstructure dialectic on analogy with the dialectic that motivates class society which underlies the positions of both "camps" in this dispute. CONCLUSION In my survey of the current status of Soviet theory in the "history of primitive so- ciety", as the subject is known in the Soviet Union, I have been able to consider only a few- topics, mainly at the level of general theory. I have tried through my comments and analyses to convey to the reader some of the background of recent developments, as well as to acquaint him or her with the specific body of proposi- tions and assumptions on which Soviet ethno- graphy and archaeology operate. I hope the reader will no longer conceive of Soviet archaeological and ethnographic theory as some grey world of ideologically purified, uniform concepts whose basis in the universe of data is restricted by the need to adhere to the supposed precepts of the Marxist "system". As illustrated by the issues of the last two papers, Marxist theory itself is un- dergoing continual development and redefinition, and controversy is at least as much a feature of recent Soviet theoretical thinking as it is in the United States. At the same time, it is clear that Soviet science will remain firmly rooted in the Marxist tradition, and, indeed, is currently in the process of becoming more deeply integrated in that tradition than pre- viously. The rapprochement between United States and Soviet scientific thinking consequently will always be limited - unless we, of course, move towards a Marxist tradition ourselves. That such a trend does exist in the United States as well as France (where it has existed for a long time) is common knowledge, Marshall Sahlin's (1972) recent book, Stone Age Economics 3 being perhaps the most salient example .
