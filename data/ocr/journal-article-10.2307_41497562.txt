<plain_text><page sequence="1">EYEING EPIPHANIES IN GREEK, LATIN, AND SANSKRIT TEXTS Kathryn Chew In Heliodorus' fourth-century novel1 the Aethiopica the tricky Egyptian priest Kalasiris at one point confides to Knemon, a gullible young Greek, that he has received a personal visit from none other than the gods Artemis and Apollo. When Knemon queries how he knew "that they did not come as a dream" (on цг] êvu7iviov rjXGov) but "appeared in bodily form" (evapycoç e&lt;|)ávr|aav, Aeth. 3.12.1), the priest replies that he knew by the way that they departed, which Homer describes but few have understood, "for as he went away, I easily identified the tracks of his feet and his legs from behind. Even gods are very recognizable" ("Ixvia yap цетотпабеу ttoôcdv f|5è кугщасоу / pe? s'y veo v àrcióvTOç, àpíyvooTOi Ôè 0soí лер, Aeth. 3.12.2, after II. 13.71-72).2 Kalasiris then proceeds to reveal to Knemon the hidden import of those lines, namely that the wise, those initiated into the mysteries, can perceive gods in mortal guise by two traits: their eyes "which never blink" (то рХ,ефароу облоге 8711|liÓovtsç) and "have extraordinary intensity" (àxevèç ôióÀ,ou pÀ87tovTeç), and especially by I owe an enormous debt of thanks to my anonymous readers.

After pausing a bit and evoking a state of mind appro- priate for the mysteries, Kalasiris said, When gods and spirits visit and depart from us, Knemon, they rarely assume animal form and most often take on human form, by their similarity making us more susceptible to their appearance. They might escape the notice of the uninitiated, but they do not escape the recognition of the wise. Rather, they might be known by their eyes, which have extraordinary intensity and never blink, and especially by their method of walking, which is achieved not by the alternating separation of their feet, but by some aerial motion and free movement, as they cleave rather than pass through the air'," Aeth. 3.13.1-2). 207 Phoenix, vol. 65 (2011) 3-4.</page><page sequence="2">208 PHOENIX the way they move, not by walking but by gliding without touching the ground. That is why, he explains, Egyptian statues have fused legs (Aeth. 3.13.2). At first glance it seems that Kalasiris is merely teasing the boy, from the pun on Knemon's name in the word for "legs" (кугциасоу). Yes, Knemon, gods look just like their statues. True, there are many instances where the priest divulges recondite lore with an ironic wink, such as his discourses on the Nile {Aeth. 2.28) or on magic (3.16), which are designed to impress his interlocutors and make them susceptible to his influence.3 What sets this passage apart from the others, and signals its importance, is its peculiar fit into one of the central issues of the novel: identity and how identity is determined. This essay begins by exploring Kalasiris' claim that there are certain character- istics by which gods in mortal guise can be recognized, in both Greek and Latin literature. When such characteristics are found but do not resemble Kalasiris' criteria, then we must seek a different authority for Kalasiris' utterance. The cultural context of the Aethiopica , the product of a fourth-century Roman hel- lenophone in Syria, featured syncretistic attitudes, wherein identity was a func- tion of behavior rather than birth (Whitmarsh 2001: 20-37), and widespread belief in the appearance of gods to humans (Lane Fox 1986: 122-125, 142- 145). Consideration of the novel's own hierarchy of authority, which privileges external sources, demands exploration beyond the borders of Greek and Latin literature. A passage from the Mahãbhãrata offers an intriguing parallel to the one from the Aethiopica ,4 Pursuing the possible literary and cultural connections between these two passages yields evidence suggesting that Heliodorus might have had contact with Indian storytellers and that the passage above might have been shaped by one of the several philosophical systems influenced by Indian thought. IDENTIFYING GODS IN MORTAL GUISE IN GREEK AND LATIN LITERATURE There are many kinds of divine epiphany in Greco- Roman mythology, of which Kalasiris addresses one basic type: when gods appear in mortal guise and are recognized. Excluded from consideration, then, would be the following sorts of epiphany: non-human appearances, such as Zeus' golden shower for Danae (e.g., ApoÚod. Bibi . 2.35.1-2) or his swan for Leda (e.g., Eur. Hel. 18-19); dei ex machinis , when gods appear in an obviously transcendent state (e.g., Eur. Or. 1625-26); when gods appear in their true forms, such as Zeus' disastrous display for Semeie (e.g., Diod. Sic. 3.64.4); gods' cohabitation with mortals, 3 Winkler (1982) discusses Kalasiris' deceptiveness and its relationship to the story. See also below, 219, n. 49. 4 The foremost Sanskrit epic poem, the Mahãbhãrata , shows signs of oral composition (Brock- ington 1998; de Vet 1996; and Smith 1999), is attested in textual form as early as the fifth century b.c., and likely reached its full form by the fourth century A.D. The story of the Mahãbhãrata concerns a dynastic power struggle between two branches of a family.</page><page sequence="3">EYEING EPIPHANIES 209 such as Calypso with Odysseus (Horn. Od. 1.13-15); dreams or visions, such as Isis's appearance to Lucius (Apul. Met. 11.3-6); undetected influence, such as Athena passing through the crowd of Greeks (Horn. IL 2.446-454); or voice alone without a bodily manifestation, such as Athena with Odysseus (Horn. II. 2.172-181) or Socrates' encounters with his daimon (PI. Ap. 31c8-d4). For economy's sake I would also disregard epiphanies by demi-gods and heroes, for these do not differ in nature from those of proper deities. In his Pauly- Wissowa article, Pfister (1938) categorizes epiphany according not to genre but to the role of gods in the narrative: epic epiphany in which humans are the main characters and gods help them, mythical epiphany in which gods are the main characters, fairy tale epiphany set in a distant time when gods walked the earth among humans,5 and legendary epiphany, which is associated with historical times and the founding of cults (282). A sensitive treatment of epiphany, then, cannot divide fictional from non- fictional literature because such a division did not exist in the minds of ancient writers. Epiphany was a concept long before it was a term. The word ётифаувкх first appears in hellenistic writers (Aristotle, Polybius, Diodorus Siculus, etc.), meaning "appearance," and is used to refer to gods as early as Strabo (8.6.15.6). Such a late inception, long after the hellenistic canon was established, would make it reasonable to expect that divine epiphany would not have a formal set of characteristics, but this is not the case. That Kalasiris quotes Homer - and the Aethiopica is certainly not the only novel to do so - testifies to the poeťs status as the touchstone for important ideas. Being able to claim Homeric authority lent prestige to any assertion, whether there was any basis for it or not. The latter seems to be the case for the Egyptian priest, for out of the many pertinent instances of epiphany in Homer, not one fits the pattern mentioned by Kalasiris, wherein the gods are described have unblinking eyes and a levitating method of locomotion. In fact, aside from one minor instance, the notion of "blinking" or "not blinking" does not occur at all in Homer,6 nor does "fixed staring," as the use of àxevéç in the passage from Heliodorus implies.7 Unusual locomotion does accompany many appearances by disguised divinities, but it is not of the fused-leg variety. Kalasiris' general observation, though, that the gods reveal themselves in the manner of their departure is borne out by Homer. Athena {Od. 1.320) and Poseidon (77. 13.62) betray their divinity by their speedy departures, which is likened to birds' flight, and Athena also transforms herself into different birds as she leaves human company {Od. 3.372 and Od. 22.240). Odysseus describes 5 Such as is alluded to in Horn. Od. 17.485; Hes. fr. 1.6-7; Catull. 64.384-396; Diod. Sic. 6 fr. 1.10; and Lactant. Div. inst. 1.14-22. 6 Od. 18.11 mentions people 87iiA-A,íÇouaiv ("giving a signal by winking"). Elsewhere in the novel àxevéç describes humans staring at each other: Aeth. 3.5.5.3, 3.13.2.3, 7.7.3.3, 7.12.7.4, 10.7.3.5.</page><page sequence="4">210 PHOENIX Hermes taking his leave as going vrjaov ava' ò^r|eaaav ("up over the wooded island," Od. 10.308), which could be a reference to flight. The Poseidon passage which Kalasiris mentions falls into this group above. The priest quotes only Oilean Ajax's comment (II. 13.71-72 above), but in the larger context of the scene Kalasiris' interpretation that these lines indicate the god's peculiar method of moving seems questionable. Poseidon "rushed on" (Spxo/ôpjnr|aTi, 13.62, 64) like a hawk in pursuit. Neither of those verbs, how- ever, denotes a gliding motion in Homer; opvufii is used of men, animals, and storms, and орцасо for military actions. Though writing some eight centuries after Heliodorus, Eustathius provides an interpretation of this passage entirely at odds with Kalasiris', likening the goďs motion to a runner making far-spaced, light footprints (II. 3.441). Perhaps it is not we who misunderstand the Greek, but Kalasiris who is forcing his reading onto the text. There are a number of instances in Homer where mortals recognize divine visitors by some physical characteristic before the gods have a chance to leave. Iris' "voice" (ercoç, an unusual meaning, II. 2.807) gives her away to Hector. Aeneas recognizes Apollo through his disguise "after looking at him in the face" (eç avia iôcov, II. 17.334).8 The mortals closest to Athena, Diomedes (II. 5.815) and Odysseus (Od. 20.37, 22.210, 24.504), often identify her immediately, even though she might resemble a mortal "in form and voice" (ôéjiaç f|ôè ка' aù5r|v, Od. 24.504). Medon tells the suitors' families that he saw a disguised god who "was similar to Mentor in every way" (Msvxopi Travia ефкег, Od. 24.446), "darting" (Bòve) throughout the hall; as öuvco is used in Homer principally of warriors in battle, it is perhaps the god's speed which gives him away, as above. Aphrodite appears as an aged woman to Helen (II. 3.386-420), but Helen recognizes the very beautiful neck, the desire-inspiring breasts, and shining eyes of the goddess - some old woman indeed. The gods, of course, are recognized only when they want to be, when their "signature," as it were, is calculated to inspire action or cooperation in a mortal, and this holds for Greek and Roman literature in general.9 Kalasiris also remarks that Athena's eyes are said to be "terribly shining" (ôsivó) 08 oí баав &lt;|)áav0ev, Aeth. 3.13.3, after II. 1.200, when she stops Achilles from striking Agamemnon) because they never blink. There is no support in Homer for this reading. The phrase Kalasiris employs is not formulaic, and its closest parallel comes from Iliad 19.16, Achilles' terrible glance upon seeing his new armor: "his eyes gleamed terribly" (oi остае / ôeivòv . . . г^ефааубеу). The emphasis in both of these passages seems to be upon the intensity of the gaze, not its duration. Furthermore, in Homer оаае ("eyes") have the epithet фаегуоо 8 Here I differ from Lane Fox (1986: 104), who reads that Aeneas recognizes Apollo from the sound of his voice. 9 For instance, at II. 1.198 Athena lets Achilles alone see her, and at Od. 16.161 she lets Odysseus but not Telemachus see her.</page><page sequence="5">EYEING EPIPHANIES 211 ("shining"), which is often associated with motion (xpércev, xpévj/ev, "turned")10 or consciousness,11 but not with staring. Of these epithets, only one applies to Athena, and the rest refer to Zeus or some hero. Aphrodite's eyes in the above passage are "flashing" (jnapjnaípovia, II. 3.397), a word also used to describe armor, which evokes not a steady beam or a cat-like stare but some sort of movement which causes light to refract unevenly. Also, whenever Athena is recognized, her eyes never explicitly give her away. The shining quality of the gods, whether it be in or on their eyes, skin, hair, or accoutrements, is clearly a reflection of their divine natures.12 Once again Kalasiris' reading does not bear direct textual support. There are a few instances in which gods have distinguishing physical charac- teristics that do not directly pertain to their recognition but nevertheless set them apart from mortals: Athena's powerful (anti)war cry that reduces the Ithacans to panic (Od. 24.530), her weight which causes Diomedes' chariot to groan (II. 5.838-839), and Aphrodite's implied size, in that just a "fold" (ятиуца) of her clothing protects Aeneas' entire body (II. 5.315). The passages mentioned here are by no means the sole occurrences of divine-human interaction in Homer's poems; they are the only instances in which a comment is made about the god's disguise or appearance and its recognition by the mortal.13 While it may be premature to generalize about epiphanies in Greek literature from the examples above, in the Homeric Hymns distinct patterns emerge in the characteristics of disguised deities. In the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite (5), though the goddess appears "in size and form like an unwed maiden" (7iap08vco а8|иг|тг| luéysGoç каг sîôoç ô(ioír|, 5.82), Anchises marvels at "her size and form, and at her glistening garments" (eîôoç те цгугЭос; те каг ггцата aiya^ósvxa, 5.85), not to mention her breasts, whose glow is likened to that of the moon (5.89-90). This prompts him to address her as a divinity, which might be flattery or politeness on his part, or could indicate that he perceives something amiss about hër appearance. The contradiction between lines 82 and 85 signals his confusion: is she ordinary, as 82 implies, or is she preternatural? The Homeric formula eíôóç те jnéyeGóç те ("both form and size") is used exclusively in compliments, most often comparing a mortal to a god. The reverse word order of that formula, цгугЭос; каг eîSoç ("size and form"), does not occur at all 10 II. 13.3, 13.7, 16.645, 21.415, also 17.679. 11 77. 13.435, 14.236. 12 The inherent brightness of the gods is a persistent notion across philosophies and religions, in Jewish, Christian, even Neoplatonic thought: Iambi. Myst. 2.8 says that gods are so bright that one cannot look at them. 13 For instance, Nestor claims to have seen Athena standing &lt;xva&lt;j)avôá ("manifestly") by Odysseus in battle (Od. 3.222) and the Phaeacians tell Odysseus that the gods appear clearly to them (Od. 7.201). Gods shroud themselves or others from observation by mist (II. 3.381, 5.23, 16.790, 20.321, 20.443, 21.597). Gods reveal themselves to the unsuspecting: Apollo/ Agenor to Achilles (II. 21.600), and Iris to Priam (II. 24.170). Sometimes gods are not recognized (e.g., II. 16.715, 20.79, Od. 10.573).</page><page sequence="6">212 PHOENIX in Homer, but it appears one other time in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter (2.275) when the goddess sheds her aged persona and lets her true nature shine through. A passage in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo (3) with similar word order describes Artemis as "very large to look at and wondrous in form" (juá^a jueyá^ri те iôeîv Kai eîôoç ауг|тг], 3.198). Seen in this context, lines 82 and 85 mean exactly the opposite of what they initially seem: the phrase in line 82 is metanarrative code for deity in disguise, whereas the one in 85 indicates merely a marvelous mortal. The attention to Aphrodite's breasts recalls the passage from Iliad 3 above, but Anchises is not as perceptive as Helen. When the goddess reveals herself to him, her size and shimmer amplify: "her head touched the well-made roof-beam and divine beauty shone from her cheeks" (eim0ir|T0i0 цеХаЭрои / кире карг|- KaAAoç ôè mpeiácov arcetaxjiTiev / ajußpoxov, 5.173-175). Likewise in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter (2), the disguised goddess has supernatural height and glow: "and then she went upon the threshold with her feet and indeed her head hit the roof, and she filled the doors with divine radiance" ( r' 5' ар' èn oòÔòv eßr| лоси каг ра цеХаЭрои / кире карг|, TiXfjasv ôè Gópaç aéÀ,aoç 0eíoio, 2.188-189). These qualities intensify after she reveals herself to Metaneira.14 In the Homeric Hymn to Pythian Apollo , the disguised god shows both su- pernatural speed and size. After an1 initial theriomorphic epiphany to sailors as a dolphin, Apollo soon changes into a vigorous and strong youth, leaps from his temple and flies "like a thought" (уогцл' coç а&gt;ло яетеаОаг) to the ship (448-450). The men on board remark that he is like mortals "neither in build nor in form" (oò ôe^aç oò8è фиг|У, 465). 15 In the Homeric Hymn to Dionysus (7), the disguised god shares none of the somatic features of Aphrodite, Demeter, or Apollo. His divinity must be inferred from the strange phenomena that accompany his presence: bonds fall from him of their own accord, and ivy sprouts on the ship's mast. His transformation into a lion reveals his divine nature (Ov. Met. 3.664-669). Similarly, when Pentheus attempts to imprison Dionysus (Eur. Bacch. 616-637 and Ov. Met. 3.699-700), the restraints cannot hold the god. Unfortunately for Pentheus, this does not prompt a recognition. Also, Dionysus' presence enables his maenads to perform miracles {Bacch. 704-711). Looking ahead, in Daphnis and Chloe Pan's terrifying presence is heralded by a series of paranormal events on a ship strikingly similar 14Demeter's godly form is yet larger: "the goddess changed her size and form, pushing away old age, she exhaled beauty around and about" (0eà neyeGoç кал eîôoç ацгщ/е / yfjpaç агссостацеут] Tiepí ť à|!&lt;J&gt;í те ylóXKoc, аг|то, Hymn. Нот. Cer. 2.275-276); she radiates brilliance: "from afar a light shone from the deathless body of the goddess" (xrjA-s ôè &lt;j)éyyoç ало xpoòç àGavdxoio / А,ацяе 0eaç, 2.278-279) and "the crowded house was filled with radiance like lightning" (aòyíjç ô' елАл^аЭт] 7TUKIVÒÇ ÕÓJJ.OÇ àaT£po7cíjç G)Ç 2.280). This known ancient formula (e.g., Lucian Im. 22.14; ps.-Plut. Vit. Нот. 1370) is not used consistently by Homer: once for comparison between mortals (//. 1.115), once between a god and a mortal {Od. 5.212), and once between a mortal and a god {Od. 7.210).</page><page sequence="7">EYEING EPIPHANIES 213 to those occurring with Dionysus: spectral fire, ivy sprouting on goats' horns, sheep howling like wolves, bizarre ship malfunctions, attacking dolphins, and strange piping sounds (2.25-26). In this novel, Pan is a minion of Dionysus, who recuses himself from the action like an armchair general. Thus the phenomena associated with Pan resemble those normally accompanying Dionysus. There are other similar supernatural signs associated with gods, both in the Homeric Hymns and in later literature.16 The dramatic literature of the fifth century is full of epiphanies; yet due to its dialogic limitations it does not contain much description of deities in disguise. Aside from the Bacchae passage mentioned above, one further exception comes at the end of Euripides' Hippolytus , when the dying young man recognizes the presence of Artemis by her odor: "oh, divine breath of scent" (S 0sîov ôôjafjç яуебца, 1391). Aristophanes' Frogs 634 provides a comic test for divinity, namely insensitivity to pain, but Dionysus fails. Thus far in Greek literature, consistent characteristics of gods appearing incognito include greater size, luminosity, speed, a revealing departure, and the occasional supernatural spectacle. To varying degrees, these become the defin- ing characteristics of disguised epiphany for the rest of Greco- Roman classical literature, in every genre from philosophy to the novel. The traits proposed by Kalasiris do not appear. In Prodicus' Choice of Heracles, as reported by Xenophon (Mem. 2.1.21-34), Virtue and Vice are not only large and shining, but Vice uses cosmetics and clothing to appear brighter and taller (hence more divine?) than she really is. Apollonius Rhodius' gods routinely interact with humans, leaving less need for divine deception through epiphany.17 Supernatural speed in flight and at- tendant fantastic phenomena are the main characteristics used in this epic to denote deity, as of Athena (Argon. 2.600) and Apollo (2.674-680); the latter example includes a brilliant appearance (2. 6 76-6 78). 18 Other divine sightings occur, but these are undisguised or unrecognized.19 16 For instance: at Apollo's birth the earth blossoms (Hymn. Нот. Ap. 3.135) and swans sing (Callim. Hymn 4.249); flowers announce Rhea's epiphany (Ap. Rhod. Argon. 1.1141); animals react to the appearance of Aphrodite (Hymn. Нот. Ven. 4.69), Dionysus (Eur. Bacch. 1084), and Artemis (Hymn. Нот. Di. 27.6); a storm brews at the Eumenides' approach (Sil. Pun. 4.440); bonds cannot hold the infant Hermes (Hymn. Нот. Merc. 409); eerie signs attend Hecate (Ap. Rhod. Argon. 3.1212-20). Cf. the flowering of the earth at the mating of Zeus and Hera (II. 14.347-349). Strange phenomena accompany the birth of Apollonius of Tyana (Philostr. VA 1.5), and the emperor's fetters cannot hold him (Philostr. VA 7.38). 17 For instance, Athena helps build the Argo (Ap. Rhod. Argon. 1.526, 3.340) and gives Jason a special cloak (1.722). Yet the gods of the Argonautica are not as familiar with humans as Homer's are with the Phaeacians. Both Zeus (1.1187) and Hera (4.578) start storms from afar, Athena speaks indirectly to the Argonauts through the ship's wooden beam (4.581-583), and Eros conducts his secret business in a mist (3.275). 18 For other examples, see above, n. 16. 19 Undisguised: Thetis (Ap. Rhod. Argon. 4.845), Glaucus (1.1310), Iris (2.286), Triton (4.1602-3, 1610-18); unrecognized: Triton as a youth (4.1551-52).</page><page sequence="8">214 PHOENIX Though in terms of concept and ideology Vergil imitates Apollonius Rhodius more than he does Homer,20 for his epiphanic scenes Vergil draws more upon Homer and the Homeric Hymns than upon Apollonius Rhodius. Aeneas remarks upon Venus' unusual voice (vox, Aen. 1.328) and appearance ( vultus , 1.327) and then recognizes his mother by her manner of departure: her luminosity, smell, and stride. This last trait, incessu (1.405), refers to legged locomotion, not to Kalasiris' stiff-legged glide.21 Cupid also glows beneath Ascanius' form (1.710), Mercury (4.278) and Iris (9.14-15) fly away quickly, while Apollo vanishes into thin air (9.657-658), thus all revealing their divinity. Ovid's Vertumnus becomes a young man whose beauty radiates like the sun (Met. 14.768-769). Jupiter and Mercury appearing incognito exceed mortal dimensions (Met. 8.638), and, rather as in the hymn to Dionysus above, these gods' recognition is prompted by the fact that a wine bowl magically renews its contents (Met. 8.679-683).22 Silius Italicus devotes minimal attention to depicting disguised gods. Their presence can provoke terrestrial phenomena.23 Minerva's eyes flash in the night (9.442), but she is the only god described thus. Juno appears disguised to Hannibal several times, but he never recognizes her specifically.24 The Punica also pays epiphanic homage to Ovid and Prodicus, respectively, first with the story of Bacchus and Falernus, similar to that of Jupiter and Mercury above,25 then with the story of Scipio visited by Pleasure and Virtue, analogous to the Choice of Heracles.26 The historians too mention the epiphanies of gods, and heroes, especially to stimulate morale or provide help in battle. When explained,27 recognition in 20 See Nelis 2001 for analysis of Vergil's imitation of Apollonius Rhodius. 21 Venus also appears to her son in her divine form (Verg. Aen. 2.589-592) and "shone in a pure light through the night" (pura per noctem in luce refulsit, 2.590), so too she is a "shining goddess" (dea candida, 8.608) when she brings him his new armor. 22 Ovid tells a similar story of Orion's birth, when his father unwittingly hosts Jupiter, Neptune, and Mercury (Fast. 5.493-544). Here, however, the gods are identified not by their appearance or supernatural phenomena, but by Neptune's imperious order: " 'let Jupiter drink next,' he said" (da nunc bibat ordine dixit / Iuppiter, 5.513-514). 23 Earthquakes and fires for Proserpina (Sil. Pun. 1.95-96), storms for Jupiter (12.653-663). 24 Juno comes as a lake deity (Sil. Pun. 4.725-728), as Scipio (17.520-557), and as a shepherd (17.567-604). Hannibal deduces that some god is behind the first two sightings. When Juno shows her true form to Hannibal and enables him to see the other gods around her, the gods' limbs appear flaming (12.727-728). 25 Bacchus similarly reveals his divinity by causing the cups and pail to overflow with wine (Sil. Pun. 7.189-191) and then drops his disguise (7.194-198). 26The goddesses are very tall (Sil. Pun. 15.21) and shining (15.24, 31); they fly (15.20-21); Pleasure has flaming eyes (15.27) and Virtue a steady expression (15.24). This last example, s tans vultus , clearly refers to her masculine character, ore incessuque viro proprior ("more like a man in expression and gait," 15.30), and not to any fixed-eyed stare. 27 Many such historical claims of epiphany do not provide details regarding recognition: Hdn. 8.3.8 (Apollo); Diod. Sic. 4.3.2 (Dionysus) and 5.49 (Demeter and Iasion); Hdt. 8.10.8 (Poseidon); Paus. 8.36-39 (Apollo) and 9.22.2 (Hermes); cf. Origen С. Cels. 7.35.</page><page sequence="9">EYEING EPIPHANIES 215 these cases either comes from iconography,28 from the accompanying terrestrial phenomena,29 or from the god's greater size.30 That the historians accept the convention that epiphanizing gods are taller, more radiant, and louder than mortals can be seen from accounts of humans mistaking something terrestrial for divine.31 Preternatural height in deities or supposed deities appears much more frequently than any other characteristic in historiography. It is easy to account for this by distinguishing between the fact of what the historian is reporting and its interpretation: very tall people are seen on the battlefield (fact) and are thought to be gods (interpretation). Thus most of the incidences of reported epiphany would likely be due to misinterpretation or exaggeration of an actual sighting. Artemidorus repeats the standard signs for identifying gods in dreams: greater size, shining white dress, iconographical trademarks.32 The gods' iconography is based upon the attributes of their statues; that is, gods in dreams should look just like their statues. There are no references among those attributes to staring eyes, lévitation, or anything having to do with legs, which undermines any putative connection with Kalasiris' comments ( Aeth . 3.13.3), especially since his traits pertain to conscious epiphany. In his treatise on the Egyptian mysteries, the Neoplatonist Iamblichus em- phasizes luminosity and speed, and secondarily size, as characteristics of epi- phanous gods {My st. 2.3-4), even as his pantheon differs from that seen in mainstream Greek culture. The ancient novels contain very few references to disguised deities. In Longus' novel Daphnis and Chloe , Eros as a little boy is radiant (2.4.1), preternat- urally swift (2.4.2), and concludes his epiphany with a transformative departure (2.6.1-2) in which he sprouts wings.33 Though there is no other epiphany aside from Kalasiris' experience in the Aethiopica ,34 the author subtly acknowledges the divine characteristics that we have established as standard: Charikleia's "di- vine beauty," (Saijioviov kccM-oç, Aeth. 2.30.6) is such that as a seven-year- old 28 For example, Mars from his double-crested helmet (Val. Max. 1.8.6 and Amm. Marc. 24.4.24). 29 Thunder and lightning accompany Apollo's presence (Paus. 8.36-39); weapons come out of Athena's temple of their own accord (Hdt. 8.37). 30Epizelus becomes blind after seeing a tall figure on the battlefield (Paus. 6.117), cf. Polyzelus (Plut. Par. min. 305c). 31 Peisistratus making a tall woman impersonate Athena (Hdt. 1.60); the tall young woman impersonating Artemis (Plut. Arat. 32) and Athena (Polyaenus S trat. 8.59); the light, sound, and cloud coming from Eleusis (Plut. Them. 15) and (Hdt. 8.65); the Spartans taking mounted young men dressed in white tunics for the Dioscuri (Paus. 4.27.2) and being fooled by shining suits of armor (Polyaenus Strat. 1.41.1). Instances of gods aiding armies with no explanation of recognition: for example, Poseidon (Paus. 8.10.8), the Dioscuri (Hdt. 5.75), Hermes (Paus. 9.22.2). For discussion, see Lane Fox 1986: 150-158. A list of divine attributes is at Artem. 2.35-39. 33 The epiphany of Pan is treated above, 212-213. There are also dream epiphanies, of Eros (Longus 1.7) and the Nymphs (2.23, 3.27), which are beyond the scope of this article. 34 Kalasiris also has a dream epiphany from Odysseus {Aeth. 5.22).</page><page sequence="10">216 PHOENIX she appears as tall as an adult woman; even as a teenager her beauty lends her height and her shimmering garments convince those around her that she is divine ( Aeth . 1.2.5-6).35 The only other significant novelistic epiphany is the counterfeit show in the Alexander Romance by which the lustful Egyptian magician Nectanebos deceives Olympias into believing that the god Ammon will visit her, his presence heralded by a snake.36 Otherwise, Nectanebos as- sures the queen, the god will look "middle-aged and grey haired";37 this Egyp- tian clearly has not read his Homer, but neither has Olympias, and his ruse works. In Greek and Latin non-Christian literature, then, disguised divinities stand in comparative relation to mortals: they are larger, more radiant, quicker. And after they shed their mortal guises, they become still larger and more luminous. Furthermore, whenever gods embellish a mortal for a special occasion, the en- hancements provided are quite similar to the characteristics gods have in mor- tal form: additional height, thickness, youth, and radiance.38 Moses' shining face (Exod. 34.29) when he brings the commandments down the mountain or Jesus7 radiant face and garments at his transfiguration {Matt. 17.2; Mark 9.3; Luke 9.29) show a comparable effect: the mere proximity to divinity rubs off on people. Conceptually, this is quite at variance with Kalasiris' cloaked gods who are distinguished by their differences from mortals, not their similarities to them. In the New Testament and the apocrypha, supernatural shine distinguishes the epiphany of divine or semi- divine beings, as occasionally do supernatural phenomena,39 but not supernatural height or speed.40 This might be due to the convergence of two traditions: the Greco- Roman and the Hebrew. Though 35 As Morgan (2008: 354) points out, this passage is an allusion to the description of Apollo (Horn. II 46-47). 36 Other instances where snakes herald the presence of gods: Paus. 1.36.1; Plut. Them. 30; Ael. NA 11.32. 37 Thus reads Recensio a, the oldest text. I prefer this version, for the implicit humor in the surprise answer "middle-aged" pairs well with "grey-haired." Recensio ß has "middle-aged with golden hair and beard" (1.4.36), which Dowden (2008) follows. 38 Athena transforms Odysseus several times, for Nausicaa (Horn. Od. 6.230, 237), Telemachus (16.174), the Phaeacians (8.19-20), and Penelope (23.157, 163), as well as altering both Penelope (18.195-96) and Laertes (24.369). Likewise, Venus enhances Aeneas with extra radiance for Dido (Verg. Aen. 1.588-589); apparently Aeneas is not in need of height or thickness. So too when Odysseus' men are restored to their human forms by Circe (Horn. Od. 10.395-96), they become younger, taller, and more beautiful. 39 Like Dionysus, angels have the power to break the chains off holy men ( Acts 5.19 and 12.7), as do earthquakes ( Acts 16.26). 40 Some angelic epiphanies do not explain the recognition: the angel to Joseph, Matt. 1.20; the angel to Zacharias, Luke 1.11; the angel to Mary, Luke 1.26; the angel to Jesus, Luke 22.43; an angel to Paul, Acts 27.23; the Lord to Paul, Acts 23.11; Jesus to his disciples, Mark 16.12 and 16.14; angels to Mary, John 20.11.</page><page sequence="11">EYEING EPIPHANIES 217 divinity is consistently associated with light in the Hebrew Old Testament,41 even the Lord himself is man-sized when he appears to Abraham {Gen. 18.2), as are the angels who appear to Lot (Gen. 19.1). Aside from radiance and miracles, there are no other signs of disguised divinity in the Hebrew Old Testament. Accordingly, Jesus is of human size, as are the angels, and their shining appear- ances indicate their divinity.42 Besides Jesus' miracles, there are also supernatu- ral phenomena at his death (Matt. 27.51-53; Mark 15.38; Luke 23.44-45) and miraculous recognitions (John 21.7 and 20.27-28). As with the Greco-Roman gods, Jesus is not recognized unless he wants to be: Mary mistakes him for a gardener (John 20.14-15) and his disciples do not know his risen form (John 21.4). Regarding the qualities of disguised gods described by Kalasiris, the texts do not remark upon Jesus' eyes but do mention something akin to lévitation: as for instance when Jesus walks on water (Matt. 14.25; Mark 6.48; John 6.19) and the rapture of believers at the end of the world (1 Thess. 4. 17). 43 Early Christian iconography favors brilliance over other traits: angels and saints wear halos and are the same relative size; wings appear on angels from the late fourth century, but as angels are not known to be quick, it is sensible to take wings as a symbol of their function as messengers, like Hermes. IDENTITY IN THE AETHIOPICA Kalasiris' "Homeric method" for determining the presence of gods in mortal guise finds no support in Greek or Latin literature.44 Why, then, have him utter such a claim? There are several possible reasons, ranging from the incidental to the thematic. The scene with Knemon provides comic relief, as mentioned above, and enhances Kalasiris' claim to authoritative wisdom because the as- sertion sounds plausible and Knemon, along with the reader, can do nothing but swallow it whole.45 These explanations, however, are subsidiary and such 41 Such as the flaming sword keeping Adam and Eve from re-entering Eden (Gen. 3.24); the angel of the Lord appearing to Moses in a flame {Exod. 3.2); Moses' shining countenance afterward (. Exod . 34.29); the angel of the Lord being a pillar of light for the Hebrews but a cloud of darkness for the Egyptians {Exod. 14.19-20); and the angel who ascends to heaven in a pillar of light before Samson's mother iïud?. 13.20). 42 Angels wear radiant robes {Matt. 28.3; Mark 16.5; Luke 2.9, 24.4), and the risen Jesus dazzles on face and clothing {Rev. 1.10). There is light from heaven at the conversion of Paul {Acts 9.3, 22.6, 26.13), a dazzling angel in Paul's prison {Acts 12.7 ), and Paul's letter describes the unapproachable light of Jesus (77. 6.16). Rev. 21.17 implies that the size of a man is comparable to that of an angel. 43 See also the discussion of lévitation below. 230-231. and n. 86. 44 For epiphanic epigraphic evidence, see Pfister 1938: 278-279, 298-301, 304-307, 310-312, 318, 322 and van Straten 1976. The only contentious inscription is Inscr. Did. 496. Pace Lane Fox (1986: 102), I follow van Straten's interpretation that gods appear "through the agency of," that is "in dreams" to men, women, and children (17), rather than "in the form of." Morgan (1991 ), pace Winkler (1982), argues that Knemon is the reader's model for interpreting and reacting to events in the novel.</page><page sequence="12">218 PHOENIX effects could be achieved by alternate means. At the heart of Kalasiris' lesson to Knemon on identifying gods is a topic that is of crucial importance to the larger story of the novel: identity, how identity is determined, and what it means for its possessor. For in the Aethiopica a character's identity to a great extent de- termines his motivations and actions. Since appearance in this novel proves to be no guide for identity, the process of determining characters' identities turns out to be as complicated as using Kalasiris' method for marking out gods. We shall now pursue the thread of "identity" through the shifting landscape of the Aethiopica', this will be followed by a parallel discussion on the ways in which disguised divinities are identifed in the literature of India. First, however, we must start by surveying the cultural landscape to which the Aethiopica belongs. By the time of Heliodorus, the Greeks had progressed from the relative ideological insularity of the classical period to the rise of syncretism from interaction with the east in the hellenistic period (Nilsson 1948: 95), which only increased once Rome assumed the helm of the western world, making the empire a melting pot of beliefs, practices, and identities (Ferguson 1970: 201- 206 and Whitmarsh 2001: 20-37). As to the Aethiopica s specific date, it can likely be placed shortly after 350 A.D.46 This dating places the Aethiopica at a time when traditional paganism was waning and Christianity was on the rise, though it was still far from monolithic in its dogma.47 Further, the spread of Christianity both throughout and beyond the empire opened the door to a multitude of rival interpretations of it, as people from very different backgrounds made its basic concepts their own, while at the same time foreign religions were taken up at Rome. In the midst of this fluctuation, a general belief in divine epiphany (Lane Fox 1986: 122-125, 142-145) can be explained by the prevalence of personal religions and mystery cults that promised contact with 46 This assertion is contentious. There are three approaches to dating Heliodorus (for discussion, see Bowie 2008: 32-34), each based upon his relationship to a particular text or historical event. Seeing a close affinity with Philostratus' Life of Apollonius ofTyana has led some scholars to place Heliodorus between 220 and 240 a.d. Other scholars use the sun worship of the novel's Ethiopians to associate Heliodorus with the imperial sun cult of 270-275 a.d. Finally, the similarity of the fictional account of the siege of Syene (9.3-11) to the emperor Julian's description of the actual siege of Nisibis in 350 a.d. leads still other scholars to place Heliodorus after 350, whether he copied Julian or vice versa . While Bowie does not privilege any of the above positions, I find Lightfoot's (1988) source analysis persuasive in favor of the last date: comparing all five accounts of the siege (the other authors are Ephraem, Zonaras, Theodoret, and the Chronicon Pascale ), Lightfoot takes Julian's deviation from the other sources and inclusion of details present only Heliodorus to indicate that the emperor found dramatic inspiration for his First and Third Orations in the fictional author (1988: 117-119). As Bowersock (1994: 156) notes, it is impossible to state definitively who copied whom. If Lightfoot is correct, then the Aethiopica should be dated to the early 350s, as Julian's Orations date from 355-358/359. I also agree with Lightfoot (119, n. 97) that Julian's disdain for novels {Letter 63, p. 301b) may not have extended to Heliodorus'. 47 For instance, Constantius н issued much pro-Christian, anti-pagan, and anti -Jewish legislation, and ideologically was semi- Arian, though he was not baptized into Christianity until he was on his deathbed.</page><page sequence="13">EYEING EPIPHANIES 219 a god: besides Christianity, Neoplatonism, Gnosticism, Hermetism, and the cults of Isis, Mithras, the Great Mother, Demeter, and the healing cult of Asclepius, in which practitioners receiving a cure saw the god in dreams. In addition, the Hebrew Old Testament featured a deity who regularly appeared and spoke to his chosen humans. In this rich background Heliodorus crafted a novel nominally set in the classical past but endowed with all the syncretic sympathies of contemporary times.48 The Aethiopicas story centers around a quest for identity and, in the process, explores how to determine identity. The principal identity in question is that of the apparently Greek heroine Charikleia, who discovers to her surprise that she really is an Ethiopian princess exposed at birth due to her white skin. The priest Kalasiris too is of complex character: he dresses like a Greek but is Egyptian by birth and, beyond that, he is an Ethiopian agent entrusted by the Queen to find her long-lost daughter. The revelation of Charikleias identity, which in turn spurs the disclosure of Kalasiris' secret mission, comes from an external authority: a band embroidered in Ethiopian hieroglyphics with the story of Charikleias conception, birth, and exposure. This becomes a pattern within the novel: knowledge in general, but especially of identity, comes from an external authority. Charikleia then embarks upon a journey to reclaim her birthright and travels to increasingly remote, and thus increasingly authoritative, places. Identity is layered in this novel; peeling away each layer leads further away from Greece, but at the same time to greater prestige.49 Authority fits a hi- erarchy based upon increasing geographic distance from Greece, which finds itself inferior to Egypt and Ethiopia, but not, of course, to Persia. The Greek characters, consequently, are mostly dupes or foils, at the mercy of their for- eign friends. Charikleia, alone of Greeks, cannot be fooled by Kalasiris (Aeth. 4.5.3-4), but of course she is really Ethiopian anyway. As Kalasiris draws his interlocutor Knemon, and also the reader, into his story about Charikleia and builds up the dramatic impetus for her journey, the setting moves further away from Greece in stages. At first the priest not only identifies himself as an Egyptian, but also boasts that origin for Homer {Aeth. 3.13.3, 3.14.2); hence his claim of the "Homeric method" of perceiving disguised gods carries consid- erable weight. Knemon's comment in response about the Egyptians' love for fjviyjusvov ("riddling," Aeth. 3.15.1) is programmatic for interpreting the rest of 48 Rutherford (1997 and 2000) explores possible Egyptian influences on Heliodorus' story. 49 There is a careful distinction in Heliodorus between the traditional Greek attitude toward Egyptians, which casts them as duplicitous magicians (e.g., 2.33.6, 3.16.2-3), and the new type of Egyptian Kalasiris represents, whose wisdom guides their actions (3.16.4-5). Asserting the superiority of Egypt to Greece, Kalasiris also lays claim to an Egyptian origin for the most prestigious of Greek poets, Homer (2.34.5, 3.14). Later, Hydaspes in turn asserts the superiority of Ethiopia to Egypt, as he claims an Ethiopian origin for the Nile, Egypt's most famous fount and source of livelihood (9.22.4-6).</page><page sequence="14">220 PHOENIX the novel, as Kalasiris gradually reveals deeper connections between Charikleia, himself, and distant locations. There is an awareness from early on in the novel of a world beyond Egypt, beyond even Ethiopia: the Gymnosophist who entrusts the infant Charikleia to her Greek adoptive father mentions the lands of India, Ethiopia, and Egypt in his opening words (Aeth. 2.30.2). Gymnosophists were thought to originate from India,50 but Heliodorus places them in Ethiopia. In this he is following the lead of another novel, Philostratus' biographical fiction The Life of Apollonius of Ту ana?1 Philostratus' choice of locating these naked sages in Ethiopia seems to be one of narrative convenience, allowing him to then compare them with the Brahmins of India. This novel constructs a hierarchy of wisdom similar to that of authority in the Aethiopica , based upon relative distance from Greece. Indians, therefore, are wiser than Ethiopians, who are wiser than Egyptians, who are wiser than Greeks. A pivotal voice of authority in the Aethiopica , however, is that of the Gymnosophist Sisimithres, and this could be reason enough for Heliodorus to displace the tribe from India. Even so, the novel evokes lands beyond. Ethiopia in the very names of Sisimithres, called after an historical chieftain from Sogdiana who surrendered to Alexander the Great, and of the Ethiopian king Hydaspes, whose name belongs to the river in India where Alexander fought his last victorious battle. Indeed, Andromeda, whose painting provides the magical imprint for Charikleia's appearance, though usually identified as Ethiopian, as she is in the Aethiopica , is elsewhere Indian.52 In making a close association between Ethiopia and India, Heliodorus is far from the first; there is a longstanding literary tradition of linking those countries together.53 André (1949) attributes this to an ancient confusion between the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, which resulted in the conflation of Ethiopia and India: for instance, Vergil (G. 4.291-293) locates the Nile's source in India, and Aeschylus ( Supp . 284-286) places Indians side by side with Ethiopians. Philo- stratus makes the Ethiopians an Indian race (VA 3.20.1). Continuing this error, Nonnus, writing more than half a century after Heliodorus, repeatedly refers to the "Erythraean Indians" (Dion. 17.385, 18.299, 25.22, 35.190). It is possible that this confusion existed as early as Homer, who does not mention India per se in his epics but remarks that the Ethiopians (Od. 1.23-24) are divided into two geographically separate groups (Sedlar 1980: 9). Adding to this difficulty 50Strabo 16.2.39; Diog. Laert. 1.1 and 9.35; Plut. Lyc. 4.6. 51 Philostratus does not call them Г uuvoctoòicttou but TulivoÍ; see, for example, VA 6.4.33. 52Phld. Anth. Pal. 5.132.8 and Ov. Ars am. 1.53 make her Indian, and Ov. Met. 4.664 also calls her Libyan. Examples of this abound: Theophr. Caus.pl. 3.3.3; Diod. Sic. 2.p.l. 14-15; Lucian Syr. D. 32.14; Arr. Ind. 6.8; Agathemerus 6; Strabo 17.1.13; Dio Chrys. Or. 11.50; Clem. AI. Paed. 3.2.10; and Vergil ( Aen . 6.794), who mentions Africans and Indians in the same breath as dwelling at the ends of the earth. For discussion, see Parker 2008: 111-113, 140-142 and Dihle 1962: 100-101, n. 6.</page><page sequence="15">EYEING EPIPHANIES 221 were conflicting reports about skin color. While Herodotus apparently knew of the difference between the paler Aryans (7.70) and darker Dravidians (3.101) and was aware of different tribes within the region (Sedlar 1980: 11), Aristotle {Soph. el. 167a8) and Ctesias (Phot. Bibl. Codex 72, Bekker p. 48b7) maintain a monolithic view of Indians, pronouncing them black like Ethiopians.54 Ethno- graphic writers often conflate the cultural practices of both countries (Dihle 1962: 100, note 6). Greco- Roman artistic renditions of Indians endow them with African features: darker skin, corkscrew hair, thick lips, and broad noses (Parker 2008: 127-128).55 Even in early Christian times, when knowledge of world geography had advanced, writers persisted in this confusion.56 Because Indians and Ethiopians were inextricably linked in ancient Greco- Roman imag- ination, the mention of one then should necessarily imply the other. Thus a proclamation from Kalasiris on an Egyptian methodology for identi- fying gods in mortal guise begs the question: what is the basis for this claim? Knemon, of course, does not challenge the priest; as a mere Greek it is only within his ability to marvel. The construction of authority in the novel points beyond Egypt, but even so, such a question is technically tangential to the scope of the narrative. If we pursue this tangent, however, it leads beyond the bounds of Greek and Latin works to the vast corpus of Sanskrit literature. Here too we find a world where epic gods engage themselves in the lives of mortals and epiphanies of all sorts abound. GODS IN MORTAL GUISE IN SANSKRIT LITERATURE: THE MULTIPLE EPIPHANY TO DAMAYANTÏ57 One of the side tales of the Mahãbhãrata concerns the love of DamayantI, a Vidarbhan princess, and Naia, a Nishadhan prince (M. 3.52-79). Being of the "warrior" ( ksatriya ) caste, Damayantï can choose her husband, and she in- tends to pick Naia. Her beauty, though, attracts the attentions of the four principal gods, who appear before her at her "self-choice" (svayamvara) cere- mony, each in the very image of Naia. Damayantï recalls having heard of cer- tain "divine characteristics" (&lt; devalingãni , M. 3.57.13), but not recognizing any of these in the beings before her ( M . 3.57.14), she prays that the gods show their forms and thereby indicate Naia to her (M. 3.57.17-21). The gods then reveal themselves through "wearing their characteristic marks" ( lügadhärane , M. 54 Herodotus, however, also marks two different kinds of Ethiopians (3.97): those nearest Egypt, and the long-lived ones of Nysa whose god is Dionysus. Herodotus could be confusing the latter Ethiopians with Indians, as the references to Nysa and Dionysus could refer to the myth of the god conquering the Indians, which otherwise appears to be post-Herodotean. 55 Other representations of Indians are exoticizing and imperialistic: a half- naked, unshod woman sitting on a rock surrounded by exotic animals (Parker 2008: 131-132). 56 For example, Sozomen (Hist. Eccl. 2.24.1) calls the Ethiopian Axumites the "Indians on this side"; Rufinus (Hist. Eccl. 10.9) writes of Nearer India, adjoining Ethiopia, and Further India. 57The similarities between Heliodorus and this text were first cited by Hilton (1998: 166).</page><page sequence="16">222 PHOENIX 3.57.22): being "free from sweat" {asvedãn, M. 3.57.23), "having unwinking eyes" {stabdhalocanãn, M. 3.57.23), "having unwithered garlands and being free from dust" {hrsitasragrajohïnân, M. 3.57.23), and "standing, not touching the ground" ( sthitãn aspršatah ksitim , M. 3.57.23). Naia stands out from his com- petitors by having the opposite of these characteristics, with the addition of "having a shadow" ( chãyãdvitíyo , M. 3.57.24). In the passage above, the Indian gods are not associated with any signs of tem- porality: sweat, sleep, weight, lack of freshness, dust, shadows. Damayantï re- calls that these characteristics were described to her "by old men" (. sthavirebhyah , 3.57.14). This implies that the knowledge is traditional. As with Kalasiris' "Homeric method," however, there is no corroboration for these traits in Vedic literature. Two passages from another epic, the Rãmãyana , however, echo this episode.58 The editor of the critical edition moved the first to the appendix because he thought it an interpolation (vol. 3, appendix 12, lines 41-46, moved from R. 3.57). In this passage Sïtâ demands that Indra show his "divine charac- teristics" ( devalifigãni , 45-46) to prove his divinity: that "he did not touch the ground with his feet" ( prthivïm na asprsat padbhyãrri), that "his eyes were unwink- ing" {animeseksanãni), that he was "wearing dustless clothing" {arajo ' mbaradhãrí ), and that "his flowers were unwithered" ( na mlãnakusumas). These traits match the ones in the Mahãbhãrata , missing only the lack of sweat and shadow. No- tably, there are no formulae apparent for expressing each of these signs, no consistent vocabulary, save for the very basic "touch" {sprš) and "dust" {rajas). Smith (1999) analyzes formulae in the Mahãbhãrata following Milman Parry, who pioneered work on the oral composition of Homers poetry, echoing Parry's claim that a formula is created "to express a given essential idea" and noting that "the more specific a formula, the less frequently it is likely to be used" (274). "Essential ideas" are usually broad, ranging from typical actions, such as when someone enters a room, to standard descriptive epithets. These traits, then, did not merit formulae either because they are too specific or they do not represent typical actions. From the dearth of other examples of divine or mortal char- acteristics it appears that the latter is the case. The characteristics of gods in human guise are not a prevalent issue in Indian literature. The second Rãmãyana passage that evokes the Damayantï episode contains Hanumän recognizing Sïtâ as a human being, and not a goddess, by her "char- acteristic marks" (- vyanjanãni , 5.33.10): "from your weeping" ( rodanãt ), "from your excessive sighing" {atinih svãsãt), "also from your touching of the ground" {bhümi samsparsanãd api), "from your bearing the signs of a king" {rãjnah samjnãvadhãranãt). Sïtâ presumably bears characteristics opposite to those of the gods. The only mark that directly connects with the passages above is "touching the ground." "[Ajpparently," comments Hopkins, "real goddesses do not weep 58 The other great Sanskrit epic, the Rãmãyana is named after its principal character, the hero Räma, and concerns his spiritual journey and adventures.</page><page sequence="17">EYEING EPIPHANIES 223 or sigh" (1931: 314). Perhaps, given that gods are not bound by temporality, weeping may refer to blinking, in that each activity moisturizes the eyes, which is necessary for mortals, and sighing may refer to breathing, another action that connotes impermanence. Lack of breathing is not mentioned as a token of disguised divinities; perhaps it is too subtle a movement to warrant citation. As for the other characteristics (fresh garlands, dust, sweat), when Sltã is first described, she is "covered only by a wrinkled yellow garment of the best cloth, muddy, without decorations, like a lotus plant without lotuses" ( pitena ekena samvïtam klisñena uttamavãsasã ' sapaikãm analamkãrãm vipadmãm ivapadminim , 5.15.21). Thus Sita is muddy (the sister of dust?) and has no garlands. She is not sweaty, but that trait is hardly needed in light of the others. The idea of characteristic marks áppears well- developed in these texts, and so the virtual absence of this feature in the rest of Sanskrit literature suggests a non-literary, perhaps folkloric, origin, a vestige of these texts' bardic past.59 Aside from the passages above, the divine characteristics occasionally come into play when mortals are granted "divine sight" (caksur divyam) to recognize divinities.60 Drupada sees the five Pändavas in their heavenly forms "with divine garments dustless and golden" {divyair vastrair arajobhih suvarnair) "and resplen- dent with the best garlands" (mãlyais ca agriyaih sobhamãnãn, M. 1.189.38). But not every gift of divine sight explicitly mentions any of the divine characteristics from the Damayantï episode.61 Moreover, the qualities listed in the Damayantï episode are not the only ones that accompany the presence of disguised gods, both before and after they re- veal themselves. Not surprisingly, epiphanizing gods in the Mahãbhãrata and the Rãmãyana also exhibit characteristics similar to the ones found in Greek and Latin literature: they are larger, brighter, stronger, and faster than mortals, and their presence is often accompanied by wondrous phenomena.62 These char- acteristics, however, are not explicitly said to alert the mortal to the presence 59 For the oral origins and formulaic composition of Indian epic, besides Smith 1999, see Brock- ington 1998: 3-4, 18-25, 103-116 and de Vet 1996. 60 When Athena gives Diomedes the ability to see gods (Horn. II. 5.128), only in one case do they appear shining: Aphrodite looks weak (5.330-331), Apollo is without adjective (5.433), the sight of Ares, Enyo, and Cydoemus frightens him (5.592-594), but only as Ares is ascending to heaven does he annear "brazen" to Diomedes (5.866- 867Ì. 61 Such as Arjuna's vision from Šiva (M. 3.40.55), or his encounter with Varuna, Yama, Kubera, and Indra (3.42.17), Krsna's boon to certain men at the Kaurava court (5.129.13), or Bhlsma's vision of Krsna (12.51.5), to mention a few. 62 Examples of radiance are legion. Indra as an ascetic is "shining with the light of a Brahmin" (tapasvinam brãhmyã sriyã dipyamãnam , M. 3.38.31) to Arjuna, and Siva as a mountain man is "shining with beauty" ( vibhrãjamãno vapusã, 3.40.2), such that Arjuna addresses him as "golden beauty" (, kanakaprabha , 3.40.18). Krsna displays "smoking flames" (sadhümäh pãvakãrcisah) from his eyes and ears, and "rays of light" ( marïcayah ) from the very pores of his skin (M. 5.129.11). In the form of a child who is an avatar of the universe, Krsna's face is "looking like a full moon" {purnendusadrsãnanam, M. 3.186.83). As for height, Bhlsma's vision of Krsna ( M . 12.51.7) reveals the god's "head pervading the sky" (, divani . . . sirasã vyãptam) and his "fèet the earth" ( padbhyãm . . .</page><page sequence="18">224 PHOENIX of divinity; they are more of a metanarrative sign to the reader that something extraordináry is happening.63 And as Greek and Roman heroes are called "god- like," so too exceptional Indian mortals and avatars often have preternatural lu- minosity: Räma, Arjuna, Sita, Naia, Damayantï. The Damayantï passage resonates with the passage from the Aethiopica : the motionless, unblinking eyes are a straight match, and the stance that hovers above the ground is the same pose with which Kalasiris' gods move. Is it reasonable to expect that such a literary detail could have migrated from India to Greece at this time? GREEK-INDIAN CONTACT, A BRIEF HISTORY The western name for India, first used by Herodotus and Hecataeus,64 derives from the name of the river Sindh that runs through the Indus Valley, now part of Pakistan. Then, the river was at the western edge of India proper and the eastern border of the Achaemenid empire. Herodotus uses 'Ivôoí ("Indians") to refer to the entire country, though he is aware that the Indian sub-continent was not under Persian rule (3.101). Alexanders conquest pushed inland as far north as the Punjab and east of the Sindh into the Ganges plain, but thiš represents only a fraction of the Indian nation. In the early hellenistic period, the Aristotelian corpus mentions the island of Taprobane (Sri Lanka) at the southern tip of India ([Mund.' Bekker p. 393b, line 14), though its discussion in the context of the British Isles and the Persian Gulf makes the authors grasp of geography doubtful. The anonymous first-century A.D. Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, which describes the coast of India as far as where the Ganges pours out into the Bay of Bengal, is more geographically accurate. Diodorus Siculus, however, fancifully places Panchaea, the island at the ends of the world where Euhemerus thought the gods were originally kings, in the Indian Ocean (5.42.3-4, 6.1.4), illustrating the reluctance of later writers to controvert received tradition, even in the face of newer information.65 Privileging received tradition over more recent evidence characterizes Greco- Roman treatment of India. Trade existed between India and the Mediterranean in the first millennium b.c., and between India and Mesopotamia for at least one vasumdharã ), and Hanumän becomes massive in height and breadth before Bhïma, not to mention lustrous ( R . 3.149.3-4). Gods also are able to move at the speed of light: Siva shoots arrows "like a flash of lightning," {nispeso vajrasyeva M. 3.40.15), and the four gods depart from Arjuna s presence "swift as thought or desire" ( kãmamano javãh , 3.42.41). Occasionally, a god is identified by his departure. For example, Uttanka repeatedly refuses the offer of urine to drink from a filthy outcaste and then regrets his behavior when the being proves his divinity by vanishing (M. 14.54.15-21). 63 Arjuna's smile (. M . 3.40.17) might hint at his suspicion of a god's presence, or it might signal his amusement at the situation. 64 Hecataeus uses Indian names, but it is difficult to tell from his fragments how much he actually knew; see Sedlar 1980: 11. 65 For example, Pliny's use of Megasthenes in his account of Taprobane ( HN 6.24), although he was supposed to be taking information from Taprobanian ambassadors (Karttunen 1997: 76).</page><page sequence="19">EYEING EPIPHANIES 225 millennium prior to that, though it appears that throughout the classical period commerce between India and Greece was conducted through middlemen (Sedlař 1980: 5-6, 267; McEvilley 2002: 2-5, 238-242). Scylax, the Carian sent by Darius to explore the Indus region, produced an account not only of the physical layout but also of the fantastic peoples and monstrous creatures he encountered (e.g., Jacoby frs. 5, 6, 7a, 7b).66 Herodotus, who mentions Scylax (4.44), does not stray too far into the realm of the fantastic, describing the unusual attributes and practices of the Indian peoples,67 including the famous story of how they obtain gold from ants (3.102, 104-105). Ctesias would soon prove that the imagination of the Greeks was far more receptive to an image of India as a place of marvels, strange people, and even stranger monsters. A physician who spent more than sixteen years at the court of Persian King Artaxeixes н Memnon (405-358 b.c.), Ctesias produced twenty-three books on Persia and just one on India, where he probably never set foot (Parker 2008: 30-31), but his account established the standard for Greek thought on India (Sedlar 1980: 12-13; Parker 2008: 30-31). 68 It is important to note that nowhere in this period is India associated with wisdom or holiness, even though eastern lands were touted as destinations for wisdom seekers (Parker 2008: 295-297). India remained an imaginary place for the Greeks, due to disinterest in further research (Karttunen 1997: 347; Parker 2008: 308-309). The men who accompanied Alexander on his conquests wrote the accounts about India that would serve as sources for later Greek and Roman historians: Onesicritus, Nearchus, Aristobulus, and the only one whose work survives par- tim, Megasthenes.69 Though Megasthenes introduces the word Brahmin but not Gymnosophist into the Greek lexicon,70 he does not impart the concomi- tant association with holiness that it would gain in later centuries, because ei- ther he did not value their brand of wisdom,71 or the veil of tradition blinded him. Moreover, as the literary canon was established and locked, as it were, at the beginning of the hellenistic period, Megasthenes' impression of India dom- inated ancient imagination long after more current information about the land was available.72 Megasthenes' critics fault him for idealization and exaggeration: reporting fantastic creatures and a people who lived without laws, slavery, and 66 Parker (2008: 16-17) questions whether Scylax wrote in Greek, but from the number of testimonia it would seem fairly certain that he did. 67 Such as cannibalism (Hdt. 3.99) and open sexuality and black semen in males (3.101). 68 Ctesias is reviled for his inaccuracies by later writers, notably Lucian Ver. hist. 2.31. 69 While Alexander's achievement lived large in the Greek imagination, his Indian conquest is not mentioned in any Indian source, perhaps, suggests Woodcock (1962: 559), because to Indians he was just another foreign invader. Karttunen (1997: 56-60) discusses the various words employed by Greek writers to describe Indian wise men, and argues that Megasthenes used &lt;JnÀxx70(j)0i, whereas Arrian and Strabo some- times used стофюгтал. 71 See the discussion of paideia below, 228. 72 For instance, Megasthenes does not mention Buddhism, which gained popularity after his time. Although the Romans knew about Buddhism (the word first appears in Clem. AI. Strom.</page><page sequence="20">226 PHOENIX writing73 but at the same time had a highly developed social stratification. His defenders, however, point out that he was writing at a time when objectivity did not exist, when the claim of autopsy was justification enough, and that many of his mistakes are due either to simple misunderstanding or to his desire to find Greek equivalents for various features of Indian culture (Karttunen 1997: 76-92; Parker 2008: 95, 104, 115, 140-142). Thus Megasthenes did not alter the Greek conception of India significantly. The myth of Dionysus conquering India, which Strabo (11.5.5) thinks is a late addition to the canon and which can be traced back only as far as Theophrastus, furthers this image of India as land of barbarity.74 Some scholars think that this myth found new life as a post- Alexandrian pro-Greek propaganda tool (Parker 2008: 84). There had been Greeks living in India since the sixth centuiy b.c., trans- planted mercenaries of Darius. After Alexander withdrew from India, the Mau- ryans, the largest and most powerful native empire to rule the Indian subconti- nent, soon overthrew the Greek officials left behind in charge. The Indian word for "Greek," yavana , which is derived from the Persian word for "Ionian" (Doshi 1985: 1), is used for the first time in Mauryan inscriptions (Doshi 1985: 20). 75 The period of the Mauryan kings, especially Asoka, under whom Buddhism flourished, saw increasing trade with Greece: scientific and artistic imports and Buddhist missionaries traveling as far as Macedonia (Woodcock 1962: 561). In the early second century b.c., Bactrian Greeks reclaimed some territory from India, controlling all the provinces west of the Khyber Pass, and ushered in the period of Indo-Greek kings, the most famous of whom is Menander, a devout Buddhist. Greece continued to have influence on that part of India (Doshi 1985: 7; Sedlar 1980: 277; McEvilley 2002: 380) until the Indo-Greeks were pushed aside by the Scythian Shakas, a Central Asian tribe.76 In the first century b.c., a new sailing technique, using the monsoons to cross the Indian Ocean, opened up trade with the west, a product of which is the first-century A.D. Periplus of the Erythraean Sea , which describes the trade route to Indian ports. With expanded trade activity fostering greater contact between India and the west, there is a subtle shift in the representation of India, with a new interest in its wealth, wisdom, and holiness, and the addition of these features to the story of Alexander.77 This new version of India took centuries to germinate; first- 1.305), it is not mentioned in literary works because belief about India had already been fixed (Dihle 1964: 22-23; Parker 2008: 64-65, 143-143). 73 According to Bannerjee (1981: 162), by 300 b.c. writing was present in India. 74 This myth remained very much a part of Greco-Roman tradition; the temple paintings in Longus' novel celebrate Dionysus' feats, among them his conquest of the Indians (4.3.2). 75Pänini, the famous Sanskrit grammarian of the fourth century b.c., uses the word Yavanas out of context, so it is difficult to ascertain his referent; Woodcock 1962: 559. By the second century a.D. Yavanas refers to westerners, not just Greeks. 76 The rest of India at this time was divided among a number of kingdoms and dynasties that had little to do with Greece. 77For discussion, see Parker 2008: 251-252, 277-311.</page><page sequence="21">EYEING EPIPHANIES 227 and second-century a.d. historians tend to favor Alexandrian sources even when more recent work is available (Dihle 1964: 17; Karttunen 1997: 7, 76).78 By the third century Philostratus' Life of Apollonius ofTyana glorifies the wisdom of the Brahmins, and the contemporary Apocryphal Acts of Judas Thomas , which de- scribes the apostle's mission to India, suggests that India had become important enough to warrant attention (Parker 2008: 298-299; Sedlar 1980: 287). The famous story of Alexander's spiritual awakening at the hands of the Brahmin is from Palladius' On the Life of the Brahmins , a fifth-century text. Thus, by Heliodorus' time, India was well established in Greek and Roman literature as a spiritual land, and its sages were renowned for their holiness and wisdom.79 This brings us to the question of Indian influence on Greco-Roman literature and culture. There are two aspects of interest here: Indian influence on western philosophy and religion, and western knowledge of Indian literature. Regarding the latter, the evidence is suggestive but incomplete. In the late first or early second century A.D. Dio Chrysostom (Or. 53.6-7) reports that the Indians have translated Homer's epics into their own language and perform them. No ancient Sanskrit translations of Homer have been found; Dio is likely referring to the Mahãbhãrata and/or the Rãmãyana , and his mistake is one of hellenocentrism, though Parker (2008: 106-107) thinks his claim might be baseless. The earliest references to a written version of the Mahãbhãrata date to the fifth century b.c., and it is believed to . have attained its full form by Heliodorus' time, the fourth century (van Buitenen 1973: xxv). The Rãmãyana is older than the Mahãbhãrata in its full form, its composition dating from the eighth to the first centuries b.c. Dio's is the only known Greek reference to Indian literature, but scholars argue that elements of Indian folk tales, especially animal stories, made their way to Greece (Sedlar 1980: 99-106; Bannerjee 1981: 247; Doshi 1985: 46).80 We shall return to this idea. The potential for Indian influence on Greek philosophy/religion can be a delicate question. Sedlar (1980) and McEvilley (2002) do a thorough investiga- 78 Parker (2008: 85) suggests that as India's world recognition increased, some Greco-Roman writers became culturally competitive and felt the need to take India down a notch; for example, Plin. HN 6.59, where Pliny demonstrates that Greece has a longer tradition than India. 79 For instance, Cicero praises the Brahmins for their Stoic-like endurance of pain ( Tusc . 5.77-78), Clement of Alexandria lauds the Brahmins' contempt for immolation as an example for Christians (Strom. 4.7.51-52), and Eusebius repeats a story by Aristoxenus about an Indian sage getting the best of Socrates in a discussion (Aristox. fr. 53 in Euseb. Praep. evang. 11.3), the validity of which account Sedlar (1980: 14) debunks. Parker (2008: 251) suggests that the distance of India contributed to its aura of holiness. See Romm 2008 for a survey of representations of eastern lands in the ancient novels. Brockington (1998: 50-51) puts little stock in the possible influence of Homer on Indian epic. Bannerjee (1981: 168) answers the question of the influence of Indian romance on the Greek novel negatively, and sees both literatures as similar but unrelated developments, with nothing to link them beyond certain themes. He, however, bases this judgment in part upon an outdated understanding of readership: the educated (Indian) versus the uneducated (Greek); see, for example, Bowie 1994 and Stephens 1994.</page><page sequence="22">228 PHOENIX tion of the evidence for this, both literary and conceptual. The evidence is chal- lenging to sort: on the one hand, Greek philosophy developed in Ionia, which suggests eastern influence; but the character of Greek philosophical thought dif- fers greatly from that of the Indians. Sedlars conclusions are generally negative, with a few exceptions: Sceptics, Pythagoreans, and Neoplatonists might owe something to Indian thought (278-279, 286-292), and perhaps Manichaeans and Gnostics too (283-287, 292-295).81 McEvilley (2002: passim , e.g., 642) finds strong Indian influence on Greece during the pre-Socratic period, and then reciprocal influence in the other direction during the hellenistic period. Like Sedlar, McEvilley discerns particular Indian influence on the Sceptics, Plato, Pythagoreans, and Neoplatonists.82 What all these philosophical systems have in common with Indian wisdom over Greek wisdom is their aversion to paideia , the notion that wisdom is to be learned. Pythagoreanism, Neoplatonism, Gnos- ticism, and Manichaeism are mystical religions, wherein experience is privileged over knowledge, and Scepticism starts from the position that certainty of knowl- edge is not possible. Unlike Greek wise men, the Brahmins conceived of wisdom without paideia , a wisdom attained not by learning but by prayer and asceticism (Parker 2008: 304-305, 307). Identifying a common feature of Indian and Greek religion, polytheism, Sed- lar (1980: 270-273) suggests that polytheistic belief in each country contributed to the parallel development of metempsychosis. Sedlar surmises that polythe- ism was characteristic of the larger Indo-European group before Indo-Aryans split off (8). Without drawing a connection between polytheism and metempsy- chosis, McEvilley (2002: 98-143, esp. 141-143) argues for Indian influence on Greek ideas of metempsychosis during the Bronze Age. Polytheism aside, there is little that Greco-Roman and Indian world views share. In the thousand or more years between their separation and the climax of their respective societies,83 each culture developed ways of thinking that would be conceptually foreign to the other. Thus we might expect that a borrowing from either side to the other would be at odds with native thought. Indeed, the characteristics for recognizing disguised gods that are touted by Kalasiris sit awkwardly in the context of Greek and Latin literature. So too the devalingãni ("divine characteristics") for the most part would be conceptually foreign to a hellenophone in the Roman empire, not only because some of them have no Greco- Roman counterpart, but also because they pertain to effects that 81 There is not room here to recapitulate their analyses of the evidence. Sedlar (1980: 301) concludes that the contribution of India to Greek civilization was unquestionably significant, though not precisely measurable. Bannerjee (1981: 225) finds insufficient evidence to judge Indian influence on Greek philosophy, but Doshi (1985: 1, 33-34) sees Indian influence on the pre-Socratics and on Neoplatonists. See also below, n. 82. 82 Filling hundreds of pages, McEvilley (2002) presents detailed, text-based discussions for his arguments. He focuses solely on philosophy, while Sedlar also addresses religion.

THE INDIAN DEVALIÑGÁNI VIS-À-VIS GRECO-ROMAN CULTURE Greek and Roman gods do sweat, but this trait is not frequently featured in literature. According to Hesiod, the gods make humans sweat for the attainment of goodness (Op. 289). In the Iliad, Zeus, Hera, and Hephaestus all shed sweat laboring for their favorite humans. Hera sweats for the Greeks (II. 4.26-27), Thetis finds Hephaestus "sweating" (iöpcoovxa, II. 18.372) at his bellows, and Zeus comments that a clash between himself and Poseidon would not be decided "without sweat" (àviÔpcoxí, II. 15.228). Moreover, the statues of the gods were known to sweat in order to issue warnings.84 The absence of sweat thus is not a marked characteristic of gods in the Greco-Roman mythic imagination. In the particular anthropomorphic construction of deities in Greek and Latin literature, sleeping or winking likewise do not set gods apart from humans. The sole reference to winking associated with a god in Greek and Latin literature comes in the Homeric Hymn to Hermes , when the god playfully winks at Zeus (387). The Sanskrit reference to "unwinking eyes" comes from the Vedic no- tion that gods do not sleep. The Rigveda refers to gods as "never- slumbering beholders of mankind" ( nrcaksaso animisanto , R V 10.63.4); their eyes are always open, and their minds always alert. Greek and Roman gods, however, do sleep. Zeus, at least, seems to take every opportunity to go to bed that presents itself. Occasionally insomnia intervenes: the other gods retire to bed, "but the ease of sleep came not upon Zeus" (Aia 5' оик vrjôujioç otwoç II. 2.2). This god is lulled to sleep when Hera conspires to remove him temporarily from the action with the cooperation of Sleep (II. 14.231-291). Gods can be active at night as well; Athena does so quite frequently, visiting mortals in dreams (Od. 4.796-839; 6.20-23). Though Helius is acknowledged to see nearly everything that happens on earth, even he himself is said to sleep (Mimnermus fr. 12). In contrast to this evidence from the classical period, not blinking is a marked trait for Pythagoreans: in the Neoplatonist Porphyry's Life of Pythagoras , un- blinking eyes are a sign of otherworldliness (10.10), and, according to Plutarch, Pythagoreans say that souls have no shadows and do not blink (Quaest. Graec. 300c).85 Furthermore, the Neoplatonist Plotinus describes divine intellect as being a perpetually luminated eye that sees all (Enn. 5.8.4). It is significant that the only Greek sources which reflect this Indian characteristic are ones which may bear Indian influence. 84For example, Plut. Tim. 12.9.4 and Luc. 10.4.2; App. В Civ. 2.5.36.13; Verg. Aen. 2.173-174; Sil. Pun. 1.98; and Artem. 2.36.49-50. 85 Let us not forget the implied gender of the one who does not blink: an Aristotelian medical text states that "staring without blinking" (àxevsîç Kai àaKapôajiUKTi ôpcòvxeç, [Pògn.] 3.21-22) is a sign of shamelessness, if done by a woman; see Sozom. Hist. Eccl. 3.16.9 on a woman thus affronting Ephraem.</page><page sequence="24">230 PHOENIX The notion that gods wear garlands that do not wither is also strange to di- vine convention in Greco-Roman literature. Floral accessories, which may have populated offering plates, altars, and statues, do not find their way into literary descriptions of the gods' couture. Yet what unwithered garlands imply about the life-giving effect that the gods' presence has on earthly forms does appear in literature: crops wither in Demeter's absence {Hymn. Horn. Cer. 305-311), Dionysus' presence promotes the fecundity of everything around him {Hymn. Horn. Bacch. 38-42), and the coupling of Zeus and Hera causes the earth to burst into flower (Нот. II. 14.346-353). In classical Sanskrit, the word rajas ("dust, emotions," even "menstrual dis- charge") basically refers to anything that obscures or stains; in Vedic, on the other hand, it refers to "air of the atmosphere" which is below the realm of heaven. To be free of rajas implies separation both from mortal nature, espe- cially death, and the mortal realm. Being free from dust is another Sanskrit concept that is not relevant for Greco- Roman gods. Aside from a reference in Pausanias to a temple of Koviou ("Dusty") Zeus (1.40.6), so called because it lacks a roof, dust, or the lack of it, is not explicitly connected with deities. Dust is strongly associated with mortals; it is a metaphor for toil, in the arena and on the battlefield, and for death. As for gods hovering above the ground when they stand, aside from dramatic dei ex machinis this characteristic is absent from classical Greco-Roman literature. Moreover it is at variance with the convention that gods are taller than mortals, unless one were to imagine gods having the advantage of height precisely because they levitate. There is a formula in Homer for when gods come to visit mortals in their dreams: "and s/he then stood above his/her head" (airj 8' ap' imsp кефа?^&gt; Ä 2.20, 2.59, 23.68, 24.682; Od. 4.803, 6.21, 20.32, 23.4). Any question of whether this could be referring to lévitation can be dispelled by the last occurrence, when Eurycleia stands above the sleeping Penelope and awakens her; the ímép then clearly denotes the relation between the god and the person's head, not the god and the floor. In contrast perhaps the Indian gods' removal from the "dust" of the human world keeps them literally apart from the ground. Later classical sources, however, do report lévitation as a characteristic of the divine, but one more likely to be seen among foreign cultures: Indian sages, Jewish rabbis, Christian saints (Luck 1985: 50). The non-canonical Jesus levitates {AP 32), and the author of the Apocryphal Acts of John claims that he never saw Jesus' footprint on the ground and that sometimes his body felt substantial and at other times immaterial (93). 86 Both Pliny the Elder and Ausonius mention a magnet being used to levitate a god's statue in Egypt, suggesting that lévitation indicates divinity {HN 34.148 and Mos. 312-316), a 86 The canonical Jesus does not levitate, but he does walk on water. Christian writers often adopted saintly details from other texts. Sedlar (1980: 281-282) discusses the possible influence of Gautama's biography on that of Jesus. Perhaps Jesus' authors have him walk on water because it was unique, indicative of a holy man but far more distinctive.</page><page sequence="25">EYEING EPIPHANIES 231 notion confirmed by Augustine's outrage that such tactics fool people (De civ. D. 21.6). Among fictional accounts, Apuleius mentions Egyptian gods who deign to walk on human feet, implying that normally those gods do not use feet (Met. 11.11), and Philostratus describes Indian sages levitating (VA 3.15).87 Eunapius writes that Iamblichus of Chalcis, an Assyrian Neoplatonist, could levitate (VS 5.1.8).88 Having a shadow is also nearly a moot point for Greek and Roman gods in mortal guise. One might theoretically expect that the gods would be shadowless because they emit light from their skin rather than block it, but no authors deal with such mechanisms. The single classical instance of shadowed divinity is in Prodicus' Choice of Heracles , as reported by Xenophon, where Vice is so conceited that she frequently examines her own shadow (Mem. 2.1.22.11-12), which could refer to her silhouette as well as her reflection. As she also uses cosmetics to enhance her divine appearance (above, 213), perhaps her having a shadow is intended as an insult. The Greek dramatists express the vanity of the human condition as smoke, dreams, and shadows.89 aida and umbra ("shadow") can mean "ghost" or "spirit" as well as "shade from the sun," as one's shadow foreshadows the fortune of every human being: death. The Sanskrit chaya ("shadow, reflection") has no obvious connotations with death. Shadows and reflections, however, are temporal and ephemeral; perhaps their impermanence is why they cannot be associated with Indian gods (Fowler 1947: 272). In the post-classical world the issue of having a shadow shows up only among Pythagoreans, who say that souls have no shadows (Plut. Quaest. Graec. 300c) and imply that shadows are only for the mortal. COMPARATIVE EPIPHANY There is a vast cultural gap between Greco- Roman literature and the Sanskrit epics. Much of this division pertains to the focus of the former on terrestrial life and the latter's awareness of a spiritual world and its characters' yearning for spiritual life.90 Stories in each may engage similar themes, have similar plots, and even similar formal structures, but this conceptual chasm affects the very meaning that these aspects have. Greco- Roman literature does not imagine a world beyond this one, and its stories are told with an earthly context. Sanskrit literature has a detailed cosmology filled with a variety of beings, in which this world and humans play a small part. 87 Philostratus {Her. 13.3), however, says that the ghost of Protesilaus has large footprints due to his size, but leaves no prints when he runs - a heroic hybrid? 88 Eunapius postdates Heliodorus, but Iamblichus is mid-third to early fourth century. 89 For example, Aesch. fr. 399.2; Soph. fr. 13.1: Soph. Ai. 126 and 1257; Eur. Med. 1224. 90 This divergence might also account for the difference in divine characteristics between Greco- Roman and Indian cultures. That is, the former's focus on this world accounts for divine charac- teristics being given in human terms, and the latter's focus on another, higher world leads to divine characteristics being given as different from, and even opposite to, human characteristics.</page><page sequence="26">232 PHOENIX While there are similarities between the two literatures in the qualities by which mortals identify disguised gods, the context and purpose of epiphany differ significantly in each group. These differences indicate divergent fundamental assumptions about the nature of humans and gods in each culture, and the reasons for their interaction. In Greek and Latin literature, gods appear to mortals principally in order to motivate or impel them to take action, rarely to test them; in Sanskrit literature, gods often appear to mortals in response to some religious devotion and request by them, and less frequently to trick mortals for their own benefit. Because of this, there is a definite variation in the types of mortals the gods appear to in each group. The Sanskrit epics favor the powerful and the pious: heroes, seers, avatars, while in Greek and Latin literature the field broadens to include the young but capable. Let us explore these differences in more detail. In Greek and Latin literature, epiphanies are initiated by gods, who choose a disguise that is familiar or unthreatening to the mortal, to engender trust, or at least not fear: "lest he see her and be afraid" (jnr| ¿nv xapßriaeiev êv офЭаХцогсп vorjaaç, Hymn. Нот. Ven. 5.83). Athena appears to Telemachus as an old family friend and to Nausicaa as an age-mate; Venus comes to Aeneas as a young huntress; Eros becomes a little boy to Philetas in Daphnis and Chloe. If the human accomplishes the god's wish, the god departs quietly with the human none the wiser, as Athena does with Nausicaa. Far more frequently the gods stage a dramatic departure to underscore the importance of the directive they have just delivered. This pattern of recognition on the brink of departure can be understood in relation to the nature of epiphany in Greek and Latin literature: epiphany is the temporary overlap of mortal and divine, an ephemeral doorway between worlds. A liminal event, it must be characterized by extraordinariness. Epiphanies follow a completely different structure in the Sanskrit epics.91 The mortal often invites the god's appearance and proves his worthiness through as- cetic practice. In response the deity visits him in disguise and tests his physi- cal and/or spiritual ability, depending on whether the mortal is a hero, such as Arjuna, son of the mighty god Indra and lead protagonist of the Mahãbhãrata , or his brother Bhlma, son of the wind-god Vayu, or a seer, like Märkandeya, a devotee of the god Siva, or Närada, a pious worshipper of Visnu. When the mortal proves his mettle, the god reveals himself and grants the mortal a boon which allows him to achieve a great physical or spiritual feat.92 The principal distinction here is that in Indian culture humans must merit the gods' involve- ment, whereas in anthropocentric Greco- Roman culture heroes by definition are worthy of the gods' concern and assistance. 91 Laine (1989: 227-229) catalogues the characteristics of theophany in the Mahãbhãrata. 92 Cf. the wresting match in which Jacob engages with a divine being {Gen. 32.24-29): Jacob prays for help in dealing with his brother Esau, he receives the divine visitation, and his success at wrestling gives him the confidence to handle his brother.</page><page sequence="27">EYEING EPIPHANIES 233 This conceptual difference in the relationship between mortals and gods also includes divergent perspectives on the nature of evil in the world. In Sanskrit lit- erature evil supernatural creatures, such as demon Räksasas, also appear disguised to mortals and harass them, as Rävana does to Sïtâ ( R . 3.46), and Hidimba to Bhlma (M. 3.12). These evil beings are necešsary foils for the heroes, and are the means whereby they can display their spiritual superiority and earn the blessings of the gods. Greek and Latin heroes do not meet such epiphanic challenges. Any evil that these mortals experience they usually bring upon themselves through their arrogance or lack of self-control (Horn. Od. 1.32-34). It is not difficult to imagine Greek heroes being lost in an Indian world, and vice versa. BACK TO HELIODORUS Of the five divine characteristics from the Mahãbhãrata , only three show a post-classical Greco-Roman philosophic/religious significance: not blinking, levitating, and not having a shadow. Of these three, the first two appear in the passage from Heliodorus quoted at the beginning of this article. Their non- Greek provenance seems to be clear, and an Indian origin seems quite possible. The two ways that Heliodorus could have come upon these ideas, I propose, are either through contact with foreign storytellers or through the philosophical intermediaries of Pythagoreanism and/or Neoplatonism. Regarding storytelling, I would like to suggest the possibility of discrete stories being passed across cultural boundaries. For instance, just like the Homeric bards, a travelling storyteller might not repeat an entire epic but select interesting episodes: Achilles hosts Priam, Odysseus fights the Cyclops, Penelope fools the suitors, or even Damayantï chooses Naia. There were centuries during which the Mahãbhãrata and Rãmãyana lived in oral form before they were canonized in writing. In fact, today the tale of Naia and Damayantï is a part of a living oral storytelling tradition in India (Wadley 2004). This tale bears many of the earmarks Scobie (1979) identifies as features of oral storytelling common to both eastern (Chinese) and western traditions: the use of the equivalent phrase "once upon a time" (. M 3.53, 3.59); the basic boy-gets-girl, boy-loses- girl, boy-gets-girl-back adventure plot; talking animals (in this case, swans, M. 3.53); humans transformed into other shapes (here, a dwarf, M. 3.66); strong emotions; repetition of descriptive formulae; recapitulations; and the story itself being a tale related to someone, as for instance the Mahãbhãrata , told by the sage Vaisampäyana to King Janamejaya. An oral form of this story is much more likely to have made its way westward than any written form. A particular passage in the Aethiopica may parallel one of the Indian epic scenes already mentioned. Egyptian bandits mistake Charikleia for a goddess because she is "larger and more godlike" (|H8ÎÇov yap ti ка' Geióxspov, Aeth. 1.2.5), her golden clothing "flashing" (àvxauyaÇoóariç) in the sun {Aeth. 1.2.5). Charikleias spell over the bandits breaks, however, as soon as she starts "weep-</page><page sequence="28">234 PHOENIX ing, kissing Theagenes, . . . sobbing" (eôáicpusv, ефЛег, . . . àvcp^co^sv, Aeth. 1.2.6), and they wonder "How could a god behave like that?" (7106 таит' âv £vr| Geou та spya; Aeth. 1.2.7). These last passages echo the scene in the Rãmãyana (above, 222-223) where Hanumän mistakes Sita for a goddess, then recognizes her humanity from, among other things, her weeping and sighing. What makes this Heliodoran passage significant is its active awareness of distinctive traits be- tween mortals and gods, something foreign to Greco- Roman literature but com- pletely in line with the Sanskrit epics, as we have seen. Contact with Indian sto- rytellers is the most probable means for such a transmission. In the Aethiopica itself there are several foreign storytellers: Knemon the Greek, Kalasiris the Egyptian, and Persinna the Ethiopian. Both Knemon's and Persinna's stories are redolent of folk tales and could be a self-conscious reflection of Heliodorus' sources. At the same time, there is an undeniable connection with Greek mystical religions in the novel. Kalasiris seems to be a syncretic blend of paideutic sage С Aeth . 2.24.7, 2.27.3-2.28) and mystic {Aeth. 3.5, 3.13, 3.16, 3.17), his thought not directly borrowing from known mystic texts but full of allusive languagë. It is useful to remind ourselves that one proposed reason for an earlier dating of Heliodorus was the affinity of his novel to Philostratus' Life of Apollonius of Tyana, the subject of which was a Neopythagorean who visited eastern sages, notably those of India (above, 218, note 46). Furthermore, Porphyry's Neoplatonic interpretation of the Odyssey was around long before Kalasiris made Homer a mystic. The repeated appeal to external authority and the many direct and oblique references to India in the Aethiopica suggest that there is more to be found of India therein than second-hand philosophical motifs and folk tales. Heliodorus embraces the standard confusion between India and Ethiopia, attributing indis- criminately to both herbs {Aeth. 2.30.2), wares {Aeth. 4.16.6), gemstones {Aeth. 5.14.1, 8.11.8), and the phoenix {Aeth. 6.3.3), and to Ethiopia the mythical beasts and fantastic peoples ascribed to both lands. Ethiopia here connotes In- dia, and vice versa. There are a few instances where Heliodorus follows Philo- stratus in transferring a feature of Indian culture to Ethiopia: the phoenix ( VA 3.49; Aeth. 6.3.3), gold-digging ants {VA 3.1; Aeth. 10.26), and Gymnosophists {Aeth. 2.31.1, 9.25.3 et al.), though as Philostratus makes the Ethiopians a racial subset of the Indians, presumably the Gymnosophists were once too (i VA 3.20). Heliodorus' Gymnosophists are the equivalent of Philostratus' Brahmins: they are concerned with virtue, wisdom, and refraining from killing. In addition to these, there are a few other instances of what I would call India-consciousness in the novel. Charikleia's fearless display on the pyre {Aeth. 8.9) evokes the Brahmins' fabled disdain for fiery death (Cic. Tusc. 5.77-78; Clem. Al. Strom. 4.7.51-52) and even the act of satï&gt; as Arsake's intended theft of Theagenes would leave the heroine virtually widowed. Dionysus as one of Ethiopia's three 93 See Lamberton 1992 for discussion.</page><page sequence="29">EYEING EPIPHANIES 235 gods is surely a nod at his mythological conquest of India and subsequent wor- ship there, for he bears no association with Ethiopia in his mythology.94 Morales (2004) explores the untrustworthiness of sight in Achilles Tatius' Leucippe and Clitophon and argues for a multivalent reading of the novel, in that it accommodates simultaneous conflicting representations (36-95, esp. 77-95). A similar thesis could work for the Aethiopica , wherein Charikleia embodies sev- eral contradictory identities simultaneously: adoptive daughter of Charikles the Greek, goddaughter of Kalasiris the Egyptian, biological daughter of Hydaspes the Ethiopian, and mimetic daughter of the Andromeda painting.95 Multiple identities can coexist: Ethiopia can be Greek, but it can also be India. The fact that Heliodorus has Kalasiris apply characteristics of "foreign" gods to Greek deities in the opening passage emphasizes the blurring of boundaries and identities programmatic of this novel in general. It is significant that he tar- gets gods with a solid Greek pedigree, Artemis and Apollo, rather than Diony- sus or the gods of Egypt; this perhaps is a subtle acknowledgement of foreign influence on Greek culture and more specifically and self-reflectively on the au- thor himself.96 According to this reading of Indian influence on the Aethiopica , Heliodorus uniquely straddles the gap between the old and new views of India. It is still a place of marvelous animals and people, but it also is worthy of respect for its wisdom. At the same time, there is some ambivalence in this attitude. Unlike Philostratus, Heliodorus cannot unreservedly extol foreign wisdom but must assert Greek moral superiority. Thus this land of apaideutic naked sages and ascetics is still uncivilized, practicing the human sacrifice so diligently recorded in Herodotus (3.99) and needing the impetus of Greek culture to become worthy of its own gods. Sadly, more than fifty years later, Nonnus' Dionysiaca jettisons five hundred years of contact and returns India to the state of "barbarism."
