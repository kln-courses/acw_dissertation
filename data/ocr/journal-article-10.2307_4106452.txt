SYMPOSIUM: THE IDEA OF A TRANSCENDENT DEITY: IS THE BELIEF IN A TRANSCENDENT GOD PHILOSOPHICALLY TENABLE ? By R. HANSON, HILDA D. OAKELEY, ALEXANDER MAIR, AND CLEMENT C. J. WEBB. I. By R. HANSON. THE dominance of the concept of transcendent deity has been a persistent and characteristic feature of Western thought. For long ages the onus probandi has rested upon those who were concerned to deny its validity. They were few and their influence was transient. Nevertheless, a survey of the course of modern philosophy which attempted anything in the nature of generaliza- tion would be constrained to recognize an increasingly powerful tendency at work, amounting in the aggregate to a revolution, operating for the substitution of an immanent for a transcendent view. It is probable that we are approaching, if we have not already entered upon, an epoch when the burden of proof will rest no longer with those who deny but with those who maintain metaphysical or theological theories of which the primary note is transcendence. The traditional problem has been, given transcendence to establish so far as is possible and necessary some kind of immanence: the modern attitude inverts these</page><page sequence="2">198 R. HANSON. terms, given immanence to establish if it be possible and necessary some kind of transcendence. The object of this paper is to advo- cate the frank recognition of this change. The persistence of the transcendent view of God may be attributed in the main to the supposed demands of the religion whose history has formed so large a part of the history of Western civilization. An uncritical amalgam of Hebrew mythology and highly abstract Greek metaphysics of the Platonic-Aristotelian type was employed as an instrument for the expression of the new values which primitive Christianity claimed to reveal. A quasi-metaphysical quasi-religious support to society was thus provided for the prolonged period of social and political disruption and reconstruction which extended from the third to the thirteenth century of our era. It is not surprising that a system which had rendered a service so vast and so obvious should have appeared as a permanent expression of the fundamental nature of things. Nevertheless, modern analysis claims to have resolved the synthesis into its constituent elements, and to have revealed the artificiality of the structure. The investigation into the origins of Christianity is by no means complete. Indeed, from the nature of the case, it can never be entirely completed. But it is already sufficiently clear to most candid inquirers, though not to all, that the imposing creed and organization of fourth century Catholicism, centering in the concept of the historic incarnation of transcendent deity, was the outcome of a syncretic process involving very diverse and even divergent elements. Such a process may or may not have been inevitable in the circum- stances, but it can lay no claim to finality. The general recogni- tion of this fact has already had and will increasingly have a profoundly disintegrating effect in competent theological circles. The very natural reluctance on the part of many earnest thinkers to compromise the values of Christianity has provided in the past a stronghold for traditional metaphysics. It has operated</page><page sequence="3">THE IDEA OF A TRANSCENDENT DEITY. 199 almost exclusively in the interest of a thoroughgoing transcen- dence. For many minds, and their number is destined to increase, it operates in this way no longer. The investigation of origins has made it at least arguable that religion is primarily an immanent process of the spirit which in certain phases of experi- ence seeks to guide its development by the ideal projection of its ends into a mythologically transcendent sphere, in order to reintegrate these values afresh in experience. It is becoming more and more doubtful whether this process involves any meta- physical demand for a purely transcendent reality. With increasing difficulty does the defender of metaphysical transcen- dence call upon God in his hour of need. The disintegration of the traditional system began almost from the moment of its most perfect formulation at the hands of Aquinas. There are deep-seated reasons, social and political, which help to account for this, but the very form in which the scholastic thought was cast invited criticism. All the fissures in the traditional creed, the patchwork nature of the whole edifice, were relentlessly exposed to view by the unsurpassed candour in the face of difficulties by the profound subtlety in their solution, by the very triumph which attended the great constructive effort to reduce all to a coherent system. To undertake a com- pletely reasonable account of a great cultural epoch, to represent it as a finished work, is in itself to invite criticism and to in- augurate change. Conservatives should not write Summas. The aloofness of Aquinas is indeed a portentous thing. He views the world like some highly privileged and wholly independent spectator: he sees it as an ordered hierarchy in perspective: it is a universe dualistic through and through with the dualism according to a strictly pre-ordained plan and interpreted through- out by means of the Aristotelian concepts of a pre-existing matter (for Aquinas it was, of course, not an uncreated matter) deter- mined by the superposition of intelligent forms. In particular</page><page sequence="4">200 R. HANSON. the external nature of the dualism involved in the paramount distinctions between the Natural and Supernatural, the Realm of Nature and the Realm of Grace, God and creation, while in fact it only rendered explicit what had been implicit in the syncretism from the first, did at the same time both clearly reveal a position in which thought could not finally rest, and indicate a line of escape. We can trace in the history of modern philos- ophy the steps which led to the complete inversion of this posi- tion, until we reach in our own day concepts of reality in which the philosopher interprets the universe not from the external position as a privileged spectator but from within as an experi- ent; in which the dualisms are not externally superimposed, but spring necessarily from the central concept. It is the history of the passage from a position where the basis of explanation is a logically demonstrated transcendence to a position where its basis of explanation is a directly experienced immanence. It is possible to distinguish three main steps, which may be designated by the titles of Cartesian, Hegelian and Modern. It has been maintained that Aquinas himself provided the line of advance which led to the Cartesian position. His emphasis upon the relative independence of perception as a source of true knowledge and his clear-cut distinction between Nature and super-Nature, the former being susceptible of independent rational investigation, indicated at least the possibility of a genuinely scientific attitude of mind. But whether or not we can directly trace the birth of modern science to the teachings of Thomas, its vigorous youth can be seen in Cartesianism. The significance of the " Cogito, ergo sum " for all future philosophy, though very variously interpreted, has often been noted. It is clear that Descartes abandoned the position of the privileged spectator, and recognized that he was in fact a privileged experient, in immanent contact with reality. But in his haste to escape from the threatening gulf of solipsism he abandoned his</page><page sequence="5">THE IDEA OF A TRANSCENDENT DEITY. 201 privileged position too soon and ended in a dualism as artificial as that of Aquinas. Nevertheless, though the Cartesian dualism of mind and extension is artificial it is far less purely external than the Scholastic dualism of matter and form. Descartes jointed the universe indeed, but he carved it as a dish fit for the gods, and the disjointed halves proved to be lively and fruitful. Mind and matter as he left them could each be investigated rationally, and were so investigated by succeeding philosophers up to the point where matter issued in the unconvincing mechanism of a d'Holbach, and mind was dissipated into sensational atomism by the scepticism of Hume. The twofold impasse was overcome (so at least it is widely held) by the "a priori synthesis " of Kant. By bringing mind and extension, time and space together again at a deeper level of experience he inaugurated the next epoch on the path from a transcendent to an immanent view. It is, however, in the Hegelian development of Kant that the final passage is made from an externally conceived dualism to a dualism which is essentially internal, a dualism no longer physical but logical. But though the externality has passed away, a remnant of artificiality is still to be found. For Hegelianism is haunted by ghosts. After all, there is no man so incurably superstitious as your thorough-going rationalist, and it was the rationalism, itself a legacy of the concept of transcendent mind, which pro- duced the artificial dualism. The argument crudely expressed runs thus : the universe is the expression of mind, mind is essen- tially rational, therefore the non-rational, which after all per- meates experience must be transcended by the processes of an immanent logic. Or, again, the rational is the real, therefore the non-rational is in itself the unreal, the raw material of thought. Thus the ghost of transcendent deity and the ghost of Aristotelian matter walk the Hegelian world. In their death they have not been divided, for between them they have</page><page sequence="6">202 R. HANSON. produced the Absolute. It is only when the whole course of modern philosophy is kept steadily in view that the vast achievement of Hegelianism can be appreciated. Cartesianism weakened the hold of the transcendant God upon creation. In the most charac- teristic development of the Cartesian school the connexion which Scholasticism sought to represent as vital becomes in- creasingly artificial. God gave " une chiquenaude pour mettre le monde en mouvement: apres cela, il n'a plus que faire de Dieu."* God provides the purely formal link between the two worlds of mind and extension. In a sense His transcendence is enhanced, but it is at the expense of His vitality; at the same time the sort of immanence for which the Aristotelian system provides is completely discarded. The whole subsequent development of Deism is inherent in these conceptions, and eighteenth-century thinkers readily demonstrated that a deistically conceived God is in fact superfluous. He may be, and He was, speedily reduced to a hypothetical and practically impotent First Cause. The Hegelian revolution by substituting the conception of logical ground for that of physical cause resolved this artificiality. In the Hegelian systems Deity ceases to be peripheral and becomes central once more. Transcendent mind dominates the universe as completely as in the system of Aquinas himself; but the crucial step towards an immanental view of reality has been taken, for this transcendent mind is in no sense external. The conception is so far purged of anthropomorphism. The dominance of mind, to put the matter crudely, is not secured by the dictation of a policy to an externally created matter, its dominance is inherent, secured by the logical control of its own raw material. God is within the system. He no longer shapes it from without. Nevertheless, He still shapes it: the ghosts of * Pascal, Pensme.s, 77. Edit. Leon Brunschvicg : Hachette.</page><page sequence="7">THE IDEA OF A TRANSCENDENT DEITY. 203 form and matter haunt the stage ; and it must be affirmed that the anthromorphic metaphor of the potter and the clay does not cease to distort reality even though the potter be pure spirit and the clay raw sensation. It is along these lines that the passage of the philosophic mind can be traced from the position of a privileged spectator to the position of a privileged experient, together with the parallel process involving the passage from an externally conceived and artificial dualism of matter and form to an internally apprehended and necessary dualism arising directly from immanent experience. The process marks the gradual evanescence of the concepts of matter and form, and it is claimed the consequent evanescence of the traditional concept of transcendent deity. The Cartesian dualism of mind and extension, itself an attenuation of the Aristotelian dualism of matter and form, is followed by a further attenuation into the Hegelian dualism of sense and thought. The criticism which attaches to the manifold systems which have been built upon these various premises is that they all alike present for our acceptance a universe which purports to be either a rational description or a logical structure, and in either case and ipso facto devoid of life. It would be ungenerous to say " they murder to dissect " ; it is both kinder and truer to remark that logic has been the last infirmity of many noble minds. It is doubtless a hard saying that thought must by its very nature be after-thought; but it is none the less true. It follows that a dualism which is apprehended primarily by thought of necessity distorts the inherent dualism of a living process, for it is always at least one remove from the vital experience which it seeks to interpret. Absolute idealism with its logic of coherence no doubt distorts it least; it distorts it far less than the syllogistic logic with its implication of a pre-arranged plan. For the adjustment which is inseparable from the manifestation of life certainly does suggest a kind of coherence far more clearly than</page><page sequence="8">204 R. HANSON. it suggests a kind of pre-arranged plan. But, even so, the most refined logic is in its nature static, whilst life is essentially dynamic, an ever-growing force involving a peculiar kind of transcendence which is developed from within, not in any sense a transcendence which exists independently and is imposed from without. The true dualism of which Scholastic, Cartesian and Hegelian dualisms are the more or less partial and inadequate expression is a dualism of immanent process. Its nature can only be grasped by an intuition which is prior to thought. The most significant feature in the recent and contemporary break- down of absolutist systems is the clear emergence and the increasing elaboration of this fact. To produce logical conviction is not the aim of this paper. On the contrary, it is an implication of the thesis that any such dependence on systematic logic results in a kind of simplification which falsifies the facts. The a priori and fundamental nature of immanent process cannot be demonstrated : it must be directly experienced and consciously affirmed at the outset. A cumulative argument, however, in favour of its acceptance as the most favourable starting point of all future metaphysic may be for- mulated from a consideration of the development of Western civilization as a whole. One aspect which might be indefinitely elaborated has been barely indicated. The appeal to other spheres of mental activity, to Art, Science, Literature, Politics, Criticism, would reveal the same complete revolution in thought, the same approach to an immanent standpoint. It is only possible in the scope of this paper to state the fact; and it is merely a further illustration of the fact, though a consideration of primary import- ance, that to assert in most well-informed circles and even to the merely intelligent outsider, the existence of an immanent life- force is in these days to call attention to the obvious. The thing is eminently verifiable in individual experience and in the whole spiritual and mental environment. On the other hand, a reference</page><page sequence="9">THE IDEA OF A TRANSCENDENT DEITY. 205 to absolute mind or to transcendent deity awakens no common assent, invites interminable discussion and arouses extreme and widespread opposition. This is a point of very great practical importance. The joyous or at least the courageous affirmation of the obvious is, it must be said, the first necessity, though by no means the last necessity of any creed or philosophy which is to afford an adequate basis for civilization. Apologetics will never stop a rot. They merely call detailed attention to its existence. They beget a sense of weakness at the outset which entails a lack of virility to the end. It is such lack of virility rather than any lack of logic which is the serious charge against the very able constructions of modern theistic thought. Whilst strenuously asserting the reality of both the transcendence and the immanence of God, theistic thinkers seem generally content merely to hint unutterable things about the how and the why. We look for philosophy or at least theology, and we seem in the end to be presented with a more or less subtle apologetic. Deism with all its limitations was a virile creed courageously affirming the Weltanschauung which it implied and boldly facing the consequences. Nineteenth-century theism, on the other hand, too readily appears as the death-bed repentance of a Deism purified indeed, but fatally damaged, in the fires of romanticism. It does not seem capable of developing an independent Weltanschauung from its own first principles, and it seems to be offering a perpetual apology for, and a grudging assent to, a Weltanschauung which exists in its despite and to its embarrassment. Is it altogether surprising that opponents are apt to argue unkindly from this obvious embarrassment to the inevitable transience of the phantom which experiences it? Jahveh has had a long and eventful history. But Jahveh as the belated and reluctant disciple of Jean Jacques is, it must surely be conceded in view of all the circumstances, a singularly uncon- vincing determination of the absolute. A theology which knows</page><page sequence="10">206 R. HANSON. its business will ever strive to produce the robust mental atmo- sphere in which it is possible to say with conviction, " The fool has said in his heart there is no God." Theology is approaching the final stages of decadence when it is constrained to admit with regret that the wise in rapidly-increasing numbers proclaim aloud their invincible ignorance. The peculiar kind of transcendence which is inherent in immanent process has been described most fully in the writings of Bergson, but in large sections of modern thought the con- ception has already attained to the dignity of a commonplace. If the imagination and the understanding be allowed freely to absorb the modern Weltanschaung permeated as it now is in every direction by evolutionary concepts, more particularly and primarily if the attention be directed to the implications of our own conscious experience we discover as the most fundamental *constitutive feature of all process a characteristic which may be expressed by the term self-transcendence. The expression is necessarily vague, but the fact, it is claimed, is fundamental and indubitable. It is the very condition of immanent process, of anything which we can call development or life that it exists by virtue of a duality. The upward push or trend of necessity implies a downward tendency over against which it expresses and develops itself. This fact cannot be logically demonstrated, it must be grasped by intuition: but when it is seized it is recognized as the most characteristic feature of reality as we experience it. This is the most primary form, the true matrix of those other less fundamental dualisms of form and matter, of mind and extension, of thought and sense which modern philosophy has successively formulated and resolved. These less fundamental dualisms could only be resolved by the invoca- tion of an independent principle, by the introduction of a more or less external or at least artificial transcendence. The dualism of an immanent life-force requires no such resolution for it is</page><page sequence="11">THE IDEA OF A TRANSCENDENT DEITY. 207 wholly determined from within. Immanent process is necessarily self-transcendent. It is the self-transcendent character of the process conceived in its purity which provides the concept of deity. An adequate account of the intuition of life cannot be given if the attention is confined to that dualism of an upward and a downward tendency in which it is necessarily expressed and primarily appre- hended. We need to say not merely that here and now in this or that manifestation we apprehend a process which achieves a temporary expression through self-transcendence. In order to express the fullness of our intuition of life we are constrained to consider apart and to affirm distinctly the upward tendency of that dualism in which for us all life is expressed. We need to affirm this tendency as inherent and unconquerable. It is only through the isolation of this element that we can characterize the process as a whole. For the primary characteristic of that intuition whose fundamental nature we are seeking to affirm is not that of unending strife but that of unending life. The expres- sion of life in time and space undoubtedly involves a dualism: that is our primary intuition. We may if we choose call this expression life : it is certainly life as we experience it in action. But then, if we adopt this terminology, we must go on to affirm a spirit of life which is inexhaustible and unconquerable, which, to use an anthropomorphic metaphor, however hampered or defeated in this or that manifestation, nevertheless pushes on to an ever-fuller expression. This spirit of life is God. Concentration upon the dualism of immanent process and failure to identify the upward tendency as a separable and distinct moment issues in the concept of emergent deity. This philosophy of emergent deity is a description, and so far as it goes a true description of the unresolved dualism which is characteristic of the outward expression of life. If it be only possible to describe the evolutionary process from without then the most that can be</page><page sequence="12">208 R. HANSON. said is that it displays a nisus towards deity. But, from the intolerable contradictions involved in the idea of a God who comes to be at the end of the process we may escape, if we will, by apprehending the process from within, by vigorously exercising our birthright as privileged experients. Viewed from within the dualism is no longer ultimate. It is apprehended indeed as necessary for the expression of life ; but it provides no exhaus- tive or even credible account of the nature life as such. If the conflict or increasing complication do in fact issue in the emergence of values and in the concept of deity it is the business of meta- physics at least to suggest a reasonable ground for this. The philosophy of emergence does not do so. It describes life, it does not characterize it. But while the business of science is to describe behaviour, it is the business of philosophy to investigate character, those permanent tendencies and traits which behaviour expresses but never exhausts. From an unresolved dualism, from mere complication nothing whatever can emerge. Dualism qua dualism can never issue in a process. Pure complication dwindles into mere repetition and ends in pure nothing : it is not life and cannot beget life : it is death. It is only when one term in the dualism, one element in the complication is recognized and affirmed as normative and constitutive that there can be any conception of process or development or continuity. The element which provides this ground for process and this character of continuity is the element of self-transcendence which can be as clearly recognized and is as completely present in the simplest dualism and in the crudest complexity capable of being appre- hended at all, as it must be equally present and recognizable in the most advanced stages of cosmic evolution. It is the essential characteristic of life; it is all there all the time, and it is by definition inexhaustible. In each and every expression of life it is one and indivisible. It is the divine element in the process and apart from it there could be no process at all. In those rare</page><page sequence="13">THE IDEA OF A TRANSCENDENT DEITY. 209 creative moments when we consciously transcend our normal selves we hold veritable communion with God. Nevertheless, the transcendence is determined as it is appre - hended wholly from within. It is from first to last the self- transcendence of immanent process. There is no question of temporal or even logical priority. It is not a logical whole which we are conceiving, still less a predetermined development imposed or controlled by an ens realissimnuu. It is a living process which we are enabled to apprehend by a direct intuition, and in that intuition we can distinguish, amid and beyond the conflict in which life is expressed, an inseparable moment of analysed experience which is eternal and infinite and therefore divine. Our destiny our being's heart and home Is with infinitude and only there; With hope it is, hope that can never die, Effort, and expectation, and desire, And something ever more about to be. 0</page><page sequence="14">II. By HILDA D. OAKELEY. I FIND myself in one respect in partial agreement with Mr. Hanson, and I may perhaps, therefore, with advantage refer to this point before developing a position on the whole opposed to his. If I interpret rightly Mr. Hanson's standpoint, whilst maintaining primarily a doctrine of immanence, he recognizes the necessity of admitting a certain element of transcendence into that conception of the relation of the finite to the ultimate, which we are here attempting to interpret in the province of the philosophy of religion. To me, on the other hand, it seems impossible to make clear the truth of the belief in transcendence without demonstrating that it rests on partial immanence. Without the presence in the world in some degree of that mind which is the fundamental reality the principle of the trans- cendent would be a mere unknowable. As such it would appear to be of no value for religion, and of very dubious value for philosophy. Our point of agreement is then in regard to the recognition in the concept of deity, of elements both immanental and transcendental. Whether the account given by Mr. Hanson of the emergence of a kind of transcendence, described near the beginning as meaning the ideal projection by the immanent spirit, "of its ends into a mythologically transcendent sphere," and later as a "self-transcendence which can be recognized as the divine element in the process of life," does actually afford a basis for the affirmation of the transcendent, I feel more doubtful. The source of my doubt lies chiefly in the method he employs in his argument. In reading his paper I was constantly reminded of Aristotle's dictum, " It is not possible to demonstrate in one science from the principles of another."</page><page sequence="15">THE IDEA OF A TRANSCENDENT DEITY. 211 Certainly in the subject with which we are dealing no concept and no analogy can seem perfectly satisfactory. But in the selec- tion of the concepts most likely to be illuminating ought we not to employ the test that they must lie within the sphere of that activity out of which the problem has sprung ? Now the problem of the transcendence or immanence of the divine essentially springs from the activity of mind in its two forms, namely, first as practical or seeking good in some mode of relation- ship with other finite minds, secondly, as knowing and seeking truth. First as practical because we must recognize that the problem in the shape in which we are dealing with it is originally brought to philosophy by the experiences of the practical life. " Monism, whether of the more materialist or of the more spiritualist kind is . . . on the territory of history an incredible delusion, for it contradicts every unprejudiced impression of the actual working of life, and is directly refuted by that bit of history which each of us knows well, since each one of us lives it- our own personal experience." In these words of Ernst Troeltsch* the instinct of the wayfaring men is strongly expressed, and when we study the history of philosophy we see that in this they do not err. For no philosopher has succeeded in establishing an invulnerable monistic system without doing such violence to the facts represented by the practical experience as to stand himself upon a dualism which rends the philosophic life in twain. Here, perhaps, Mr. Hanson would agree, with a difference. For he finds " the ghost of transcendent deity and the ghost of Aristotelian matter " walking the Hegelian world. Nevertheless he thinks that "the crucial step toward an immanental view of reality " was taken by Hegel because the transcendent mind is no longer external. But when he finds it necessary to remove * Quoted by Baron von Hiigel in Essays and Addresses on the Philosophy of Religiozn. o2</page><page sequence="16">212 IHILDA E. OAKELEY. Hegel's conception of God or Mind within the system as still significant of an artificial transcendence, and substitute the dualism of an "immanent life-force which as necessarily self- transcendent provides the concept of deity," does not the ghost of the Hegelian dialectic walk Mr. Hanson's world ? Certainly it is not altogether at home in these haunts. But I do not wish to press the point that we cannot avoid logical categories, even in maintaining an alogical position. In this respect all of us, except those who still hold that the too too solid world can be resolved into logical thought, must feel that their houses are partly of glass. What I wish rather to question is the plausible assumption so often taken as axiomatic by Bergsonians that the whole procedure of thought is to translate into static lifeless forms the dynamic processes of life. Obviously to crystallize and arrest aspects of the ever- changing course of experience, making of them objects useful as a mosaic or for a cinematograph interpretation (valid within limits), is a mental method. Or in a more important sense, thought corrects the over-emphasis of the durational aspect of experience, reminding us how, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, it can be viewed, sub quadam specie cternitatis. But this method of thought is not the whole of thought. To borrow a fine phrase of Gentile, thought " passes through the other," or object it creates, but it " passes through it without stopping." In its essence thought is creative, it "wanders through eternity," or creates eternity in its wanderings. It is everlastingly productive, in the invention of new concepts for the discovery of truth, in the origination of new ways of realizing good, in the urging of our vision to points of view from which fresh aspects of the world are revealed. The life process seems creative when we survey its endless productivity, it seems to strive for an end when we observe its invincible pursuit of a special form which in some lowly species overcomes all opposition. But</page><page sequence="17">THE IDEA OF A TRANSCENDENT DEITY. 213 is it not here that we also find the most stupendous spectacle of repetition in stereotyped forms as of a blind force that cares for nothing but repetition even to infinite waste ? It is for thought constrained by the infinity in its own nature that there is always uniqueness, even in the least differentiated particulars. It is thought which demands the discernibility of non-identicals. What value is there in the life process not introduced into it by mind ? Even its creativity is a shadow of that of thought, its pursuit of ends a mockery of true teleology. The process as a whole suggests indifference though exhibiting innumerable features distinguishable as having value for mind. Descent belongs to it as well as ascent. The Aristotelian conception of the striving of all nature to God, revived in a qualified form, in Mr. Alexander's theory of the niseus of every order of the universe to the next stage of development, is a selective interpretation. Self- transcendence can only have the meaning that mind having awoken in life necessarily transcends life because it belongs to another order. It is not, then, as I read experience, from a contemplation of the life process, or a characterization of it as " privileged ex- perients," that we can arrive at an interpretation of all that experience of existence as having value, which, as I should argue, proceeds from the nature of consciousness as finite-infinite. The diverse forms of value-experience are the modes of our conscious- ness of the whole human situation as the strain to that infinite, within which all experience is set. These expressions may seem lacking in precision, but I hope by illustration to make my mean- ing more definite. I shall attempt to show that the essential in our stage of experience is that it has this dual character of finite- infinite, and, therefore, it is that the individual is ceaselessly driven beyond himself in knowledge and practice alike. The animal is solipsist, egoist, finite. He possesses his soul in peace, he lives and dies in finitude. It is the awakening to infinity</page><page sequence="18">214 HILDA E. OAKELEY. that shatters the contented dream of life. This is the revolution through which the order of life passes into the order of mind. It is this which is the beginning of knowledge and of practice, the two directions in which the struggle to pass beyond finitude takes place. It may be shown that the method and success of logic, the unending extension of the universal, the "patience " of facts to this extension, does not belong to a closed world, the completed Absolute. The universal is the thread with which we seek our way to the flaming bounds of the world, or through the obscure infinitude of myriad forms of particular existence. The universal is in our own minds immanent, and we move with it to the edge of the transcendent. But though Kant said-Thus far and no farther-we may ask: Is there not a Being in itself as well as for us ? Yes, Reality is surely both. We can have no object of knowledge which is not known to us under the form of finite-infinite. As Professor Driesch observes, logic forces us beyond logic. Kant himself insists on the necessity which urges thought beyond experience, but he does not allow that its speculations in that beyond have validity for knowledge. He does not ask the significance of the fact that finite mind can never rest in finitude, and that its forms of thinking inevitably sweep beyond. And, again, to refer to Driesch and his view that the face of death opens the door to the higher metaphysics, the meaning in this saying is, I think, that we could not know that a whole universe of experience vanished with the point of view of the individual experient without knowing that the reality is beyond the solipsistic experience. A world cannot pass into nothingness if there remain no world for which it is nothing, And it may be added with this single step in the overcoming of solipsism we overcome all those limitations of epistemological idealism which may seem to support a solely immanental philo- sophy of mind. The universe, whilst fundamentally mind, is not only such as thought can comprehend.</page><page sequence="19">THE IDEA OF A TRANSCENDENT DEITY. 215 A consideration of the form and character of our knowledge in the sphere of perceptive cognition should testify to the nature of that reality within which such experience is possible. There is a gradation in experience of which we become aware under the special conditions of the gradual awakening of consciousness to the world and revelation of the world to consciousness. Man may conceive himself to stand as it were at a middle stage in the order of experience as knowledge. The first of the animals capable of reflecting on the fact that with every additional sense a new aspect of the universe is apparent, he may ask (as Bergson and Driesch suggest)-Why is consciousness limited in me ? Since as conscious being I know that mind is prior or that consciousness is the original relation, why is not all existence transparent to my thought ? How is ignorance possible ? The difficult lesson is learned through reflection on the fact that knowledge is developed through various organs or instruments, in the possession of which man may be infinitely restricted, as some creatures are more restricted than man. We may think from Aristotle's stand- point: " Necessarily if a single sense were lacking a whole science would disappear," or with Bergson we may conceive the organization of the brain as limiting knowledge. On either interpretation we are forced to the thought of illimit- able powers of knowledge beyond our own, unconceived types of reality, worlds of value in the midst of which we may be standing, as it were, blind. Whether such extensions of experience are to be thought of from the point of view of the creative, or of the discovering activity of mind, is perhaps not so crucial a question as it appears to be at our intermediate stage of knowledge. Now the nature of the development, thus briefly referred to, suggests, or as I think, compels the postulate that there is no limit to the degree or kind of the transcendence of reality in relation to our consciousness of it. It is " Infinite in Attributes," of which we can only have knowledge of a very few. I do not</page><page sequence="20">216 HILDA E. OAKELEY. claim that the line of argument I have pursued represents any strict following of Spinoza. But I find in Spinoza's doctrine of the infinite attributes of substance the only metaphysical conception which offers an interpretation of an all-pervading character of our experience, a character in which possibly as a pre-Kantian thinker he was less interested. I must agree with the majority of students of Spinoza that he does not intend in his doctrine of infinite attributes to admit a dualistic principle into his system. Spinoza's Substance may even be, as Busolt* says, the "Ev Kat w7rv" of ancient Ionic philosophy, though such identifications are always doubtful. He assumes, at least in general, that "logical predicates are identical with metaphysical." This would be the meaning of the two attribute doctrine. If we dwell, however, upon the antecedents of Spinoza's philosophy in mediaeval thinking and Jewish traditions, and his place in Cartesianism, if, above all, we compare his immanental doctrine with those of post-Kantian monists, we shall better discern its implications. Such a consideration of the place of Spinoza's system in the history of thought cannot be undertaken here. It can only be urged that Spinoza's conception of Substance is charged with a meaning derived from that idea of God which is logical, in so far as logic requires it, in order to escape from the solipsism of mind as finite, but beyond all the logical relations yet discovered by thought, since they are all sought for and applicable within the order of experience as finite, though postu- lating the infinite. It is rightly so charged, if the point of view of this paper is valid, because in this way a place is found in Spinoza's doctrine for the recognition of the infinite beyond experience which must be expressed in the philosophical concept of God. On the other hand, the Spinozistic concept of substance has not been cabined and confined by the influence of the logical * Quoted by Egon V. Petersdorff, Chronicon Spinozanum II.</page><page sequence="21">THE IDEA OF A TRANSCENDENT DEITY. 217 movement from Kant to Hegel. In the Kantian phase of this movement it is presumed that the formal categories we employ set a final limit to the capacities of thought for knowledge, since they are bound to a special material of experience. In the Hegelian the assumption that logical thought is co-extensive with reality obscures the native recognition by thought of the transcendent element attendant on all experience, and stays the movement to realize this, though beyond the logical forms of order. With the doctrine of the Absolute resulting from this logical assumption we may compare the indications given by Spinoza of the reach of his-little elaborated-philosophy of the Attributes: " You must observe," he writes, " that I do not assert that I thoroughly know God, but that I understand some of His Attributes-not all, nor the greater part." The ignorance of the majority does not prevent him from having knowledge of a few. But as is pointed out in Von Petersdorff's article, "Spinoza places beyond doubt his view that it is impossible from the nature of the attributes known to us to conjecture the nature of the Infinite Attributes. His reasons (given in letter 64 to Tschirnhausen) are determined by his doctrine that " the mind's power of understanding only extends to things which the idea of body contains in itself, or which follow therefrom," that is to the knowledge of God in so far as he is regarded under the attribute of extension and in so far as he is regarded under the attribute of thought. " And from these two attributes or their modifications no other attribute of God can be inferred or conceived." Tschirn- hausen had asked whether there must not be as many worlds as there are attributes of God, since creatures constituted under some attribute unknown to us would have no idea of our world of extension even as we have no idea of their world. Spinoza, in reply, refers him to the passage in Ethics II, in which it is stated that substance thinking and substance extended are one and the same substance, comprehended now through one attribute, now</page><page sequence="22">218 HILDA E. OAKELEY. through the other. So evidently it would be in regard to the infinite attributes. There is then only one world, but (as Tschirnhausen rightly sees) this doctrine is difficult to reconcile with the doctrine that the human mind can have no conception of the nature of other attributes, coupled with Spinoza's view of the modes as expressed in infinite ways, namely, in all the attributes. For individual mind expressing a certain modification ought to perceive that modification as expressed through the other attri- butes. Spinoza's answer to this, that the Infinite Ideas of God have no connexion with one another, would not seem altogether consistent with a monistic system. The important point for the present purpose is that Spinoza appears to reject the suggestion that thought must be represented in all the attributes. We may interpret him in one sense as rejecting Hegelianism. On the other hand, his rejection of the universality of thought would carry him still further to the point of making impossible even the affirmation of the infinite attributes. It is in fact the interpreta- tion of Tschirnhausen which is most illuminating in regard to the problem of immanence and transcendence. The view that thought must have some rights in all worlds must be accepted, not in the full Hegelian sense but in the sense that as thinkers we can know, and not merely guess, that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in logical philosophy. Whether there can be a fuller knowledge than this of the Transcen- dent Being seems to be a problem for the individual, or for those powers or faculties of consciousness in respect to the exercise of which every individual consciousness is unique. And as regards the validity of such intuitions, it is not inconceivable that in some minds there should be manifested in relation to the problem of reality itself, that character of an intelligence which knows intuitively and not through the categories, which, as Kant says, may belong to God. Some also of Spinoza's expressions in regard to the intellectual love of God may be taken in the same sense,</page><page sequence="23">THE IDEA OF A TRANSCENDENT DEITY. 219 e.g., " The mind in so far as it is eternal possesses the knowledge of God, which knowledge is necessarily adequate." In brief, the view which I have indicated is opposed to Mr. Hanson's, in so far as he finds it doubtful whether the " immanent process of the spirit," which is religion, "involves any meta- physical demand for a purely transcendent reality," although I am not quite clear as to the import of the word " purely " in its context. For the transcendent reality seems to be a necessary presupposition of all experience distinctively human. The Spinozistic doctrine of infinite attributes appears, whether or not so intended, to provide that positive notion of infinity mani- fested in aspects, some known, some unknown to us, which is required for a theory of transcendence. The problems suggested by Spinoza's penetrating friend Tschirnhausen show how difficult it is in a metaphysical doctrine of substance to avoid the slide to purely logical idealism. Thought insists on being the Universal Attribute. Spinoza only avoids this because he starts from the conception of a reality which must in its very nature be infinite. On one side this doctrine, taken in earnest, may reveal alogical elements. From another point of view it is a necessary postulate of that world within which logic works. For Spinoza it was perhaps based on that fundamental intuition which he describes rather as the culminating point than the beginning of philosophy.</page><page sequence="24">III. By ALEXANDER 1MAIR. THERE are men of fastidious mind who would shrink a little from so formidable a question and would tend to meet the brusque and exacting challenge of it with a deprecating petut-etre. It is a temper with which we cannot but have a lurking sympathy. It is hard and may even appear foolhardy and presumptuous to attempt to move here where there appears to be inadequate footing and where the air is so thin. But in the end we see that there is no evading the question, at least for those who follow the path of philosophy. The question is neither arbitrary nor accidental. It springs inevitably out of man's situation in the universe, his nature and needs, his hopes and fears. The individual thinker may be, and often is, arrogant enough, but philosophy is not arrogant. In formulating and confronting such a problem as this of transcendence, it is not making wild and impossible claims ; it is accepting, it may be with some mis- givings as to its present resources, a necessary task. When the Platonic Socrates was approaching the discussion of a problem with close affinities to ours he is reported as saying to AdeiJmantus: " When little things are elaborated with an infinity of pains in order that they may appear in their full beauty and utmost clearness, how ridiculous that we should not think the highest truths worthy of attaining the highest accuracy." The spirit of this is right. When, however, we approach the " highest truths " or the highest objects of contemplation we may find that this accuracy is not so easy to come at. This, of course, is because the clean-cut predicates which emerge through analysis of objects in the realm of difference become more elusive as we advance in the realm of unity. And when we are dealing, as we are here, with a concept which manifests the highest degree of</page><page sequence="25">THE IDEA OF A TRANSCENDENT DEITY. 221 integration, we must not be too hopeful of that definite specifica- tion which we associate with " accuracy," and if, perchance, we are asked for " a simple and straightforward answer " to any specific question that may be raised about it, we can only, with such patience as we can command, point out the unwisdom here of a specious simplicity and of misleading disjunctions. There are indications that it has become unmodish, and there- fore injudicious, to invoke the name of Hegel. He is vieux jeu. (If there be any recollection among the shades it is charitable to hope that the rugged champion of Reason remembers and still believes his own aphorism that no philosophy is ever refuted.) But even this discredited man may have occasionally said some things worthy of retention, and one of these, I think, is his doctrine of the defects of the entweder-oder attitude of mind in dealing with ultimate metaphysical questions. There is a danger that in the interests of what we take to be logical clarity we may fall short of the concrete truth. The issue which confronts us here is often raised in the form of : " Transcendence or Immanence " ? We are invited to make a choice as between these characters or predicates of the supreme reality. It is worth while, however, to ask whether this disjunction and implied opposition does not falsify the situation, put us in an artificial difficulty, and make any satisfactory answer impossible. The teaching of Logic itself is that reality is ultimately the subject of all predication whatsoever. There is nothing inherently grotesque in the statement, so far as it goes, that God is both immanent and transcendent any more than there is in the statement that He is both material and spiritual. If it be thought that this suggestion is but the device of an easy-going eclecticism, a pusillanimous Yes-and-No to a too-searching question, the imputation must for the present be borne. It is an alleviation in the meantime to know that both Mr. Hanson and Miss Oakeley by different methods of approach have arrived at the same conclusion. It is true that, as I read</page><page sequence="26">222 ALEXANDER MAIR. him, Mr. Hanson, falling back as he does in the end upon intuition, takes the view that transcendence (and, for that matter of it, immanence) is not philosophically tenable or, at any rate, not philosophically justifiable, if by that is meant: based on a thought process of which an account may be given. But that may not be so much of a difference as it looks, for new intuition sometimes turns out to be old logic. And he conceives of transcendence in a way which is different from mine. But he does say immanence and transcendence. So, by the way, does modern theistic thought, which Mr. Hanson, alas, finds lacking in virility, but which I only find lacking in coherency. It is robust enough if not robustious, but it fails somewhat in its task of persuading the intellect. Allof which leads to the too crude and obvious remark perhaps, in the present circumstances, that a good deal will depend upon the meaning we put upon the terms we are employing. It will clearly not do to pass on with the facile assumption that all men are at one as to what is intended by them. There is, for instance, it may be mentioned in passing, the seemingly transparent term "philosophically tenable." It might be supposed that those engaged in the business of philosophy were agreed about that. But are they ? Perhaps I have done Mr. Hanson an injustice in supposing that he does not regard transcendence as philosophically tenable. He may consider intuition as a sufficient philosophical warrant for it. Others might hesitate, and some would refuse to do this. But we may limit our attention for the moment to the term " Transcendence." There is one sense in which this term has often been taken which, if it were adopted, would, it may be safely surmised, lead us rapidly to a conclusion and markedly abbreviate our deliberations. I am referring, of course, to that usage of " Transcendence " in which a merely external relation is indicated. It means not only separation but complete aloofness.</page><page sequence="27">THE IDEA OF A TRANSCENDENT DEITY. 223 There is a total solution of continuity. The transcendent object is above and beyond, so immensely above and beyond as to be out of all contact with that which is transcended. God dwells in utter and ineffable seclusion outside His Universe, " seeing it go "-with, it might be imagined, a tolerant, perhaps ironic, and certainly quite detached eye. It would be too much to say summarily that this notion of a transcendent Deity cannot be philosophically justified. Manifestly, it depends upon the general philosophical theory in relation to which it is viewed, into which it is sought to absorb it and with which it has to be made coherent. And it would be merely naive at this stage to say that, from the point of view of a sound philosophy, there is nothing to be said for it. It is true of all philosophical problems that they involve a whole systematic structure. Sooner or later, if we are persistent, we find that a Weltanschatung is in question. Here where we begin, not at the circumference but at the centre, this circumstance is immediately and acutely brought to our notice. And we must be content with noting it, since it is obviously impossible to approach the question in due form by setting out the said Weltanschauung. That note, however, will not be otiose if it keeps us alert to the general implication of the discussion. With these reserves, however, it may be said that it does not seem necessary to linger on this extreme form of the transcendence idea. Among reflective men it is not now a " live " hypothesis. Under it, God becomes a mere formality. We bestow upon Him, as it were, the Chiltern Hundreds and He enters no more into our considerations. The scientific mind, if it takes any interest in the conception at all, is at the best politely tolerant. A roi faindant of this description makes no sort of difference to it, save, of course-what it is inclined to assume in any case- that it is left with a quite straightforward and, in this regard, uncomplicated problem. The religious consciousness is by no</page><page sequence="28">224 ALEXANDER I3AIR. means indifferent, and is in revolt. An " absentee God " does not at all meet the religious need and demand. There is no assistance or nutriment for it in the idea of such. And, what is of most importance for us, to the philosopher who demands continuity and some kind of synthesis, it is otiose at the best. It is in the literal sense an impertinence. God exists, but He is not real, and presumably it is reality that philosophy seeks. It is generally said in connexion with the deistic presentation of this conception of transcendence that it was the outcome of an attempt to rationalize religion. Strange things have been done in the name of reason ; few, one is fain to think, stranger than this. Profoundly influenced as it has been by Christian doctrines and teaching, the mind of Western civilization, not always with clear or even dim awareness, is imbued with a view of Deity far other than that just glanced at, but in which, none the less, the transcendent element is present and is important ; though, at the same time, it seems to me to be an overstatement to say, as Mr. Hanson does, that this teaching has " operated almost exclusively in the interests of a thoroughgoing transcendence." Such characteristic doctrines as those of the fatherhood of God and of divine love do not look like insistence upon a " thorough- going transcendence." They would, on the contrary, appear to indicate a desire to bridge the void which seemed to yawn between the sons of men and the Deity. God is no more a nominis umbra, but a living power touching closely the mundane process and human concerns. He is the Ruler, Preserver, Friend. The god of Mr. Wells is not the Christian God, but when he speaks of him as the Great Companion, he is expressing what is, so far forth, an important and continually recurring Christian idea. There is no bare externality here. There is an intimacy and inwardness in the relation between the Deity and His creatures which removes us definitely from such bare externality or pure transcendence. There is now the possibility, and, it is strongly</page><page sequence="29">THE IDEA OF A TRANSCENDENT DEITY. 225 maintained, the actuality, of intercourse, communion, call and answer. The phrase " Closer than hands or feet " is more than a poetical flourish, it is the authentic expression of a Christian conviction. It may or may not be mistaken, but it is there. It is extremely difficult-if it be at all possible-especially when many centuries of human experience are involved, to trace out the actions and reactions of self-conscious deliberate theorizing on the one hand and simple, uncritical conviction on the other. This, it might be said in passing, should put the thinker on his guard when he is invited to accept " facts " and acknowledge " in- tuitions." Per contra, philosophers tend to exaggerate the role of the intellect in the affairs of mankind-except in those recurrent phases of disgust and discouragement when they may become somewhat violent in their announcements of the ineptitude of the intellect. The former weakness is a respectable weakness; but even those who are subject to it will allow that the attitude we have been considering came into being and maintained itself -will, one suspects, continue for some time to sturdily maintain itself-not so much as the response to the demand for intellectual satisfaction, but in a less articulate but equally persistent call of the human spirit which sometimes finds itself lonely and weak. The attitude has often enough been theorized. And there is nothing seriously disturbing in the objection that such theorization is ex post facto and no more than conceptual embroidery. Fortunately for us, ideas which have no explicit rational ground often take possession of us. They are not to be summarily rejected on that account. It is just our business to find out if they are rationally justifiable or not. There may be good reasons, though as yet we do not know them. And this is precisely what we have to find out in the present case. To do this we must, pace Mr. Hanson, go further than a reference to the general drift of opinion or belief which, even if we accept it as established, cannot be more than a datum for us. P</page><page sequence="30">226 ALEXANDER MAIR. The conception or, if the term be preferred, the attitude to which we have been referring is social in its character and is based on the relation of person to person. In it the third of the familiar triad of metaphysical objects is somewhat overlooked. Experience is regarded as an adventure of the soul; the world, the milieu in which it is enacted, is lightly regarded. It is but a transitory thing and of relatively slight significance. There is here no continuing city. The physical cosmos is little more than a painted scroll to be rolled up presently. The really vital objects are God and the Self, and the one all-important topic that of the relation of these. There is more than a suspicion of pure transcendency here in the way in which God's relation to the world and the world's relation to God is thought of. In the manner of thinking of that more vital question, the relation of the Self to God, transcendent features also appear. We find, all through, a steady insistence (both from an ethical and a psychological standpoint), upon the intrinsic worth and the independent status of the human person. Just as in human intercourse, even in the deepest and closest communion, there remains an impermeable core of personality in each of the par- ticipants; we may be at one but we never become one; self- identity is never lost; so, in our relation to the Deity, God is infinitely greater, but He remains an Other. To abandon this view, it is held, would be to render meaningless many of our experiences and make illusory the moral life in which man's nature finds its deepest and most precious expression. This emphasis upon the uniqueness, dignity and worth of personality means impatience with all attempts to show that All is One, a dislike of all suggestions of the possibility of complete unification in the mystical ecstasy, or, again, of the philosophical idea of being ultimately absorbed in the Absolute. Always communion, never union. If this is difficult to theorize, and a surd appears just where it is most awkward and distressing to the</page><page sequence="31">THE IDEA OF TRANSCENDENT A DEITY. 227 theoretic intelligence, it is unfortunate, but there is nothing to be done. We must cling with tenacity to the highest we know. Pantheism, lower or higher, has its troubles also, it is pointed out, and it will be found that these have their tap-root in what is held to be the impossibility of showing that so unique a " fact " as the Self can be merely a characteristic of something else no matter how great and venerable, an adjective merely and not a substantive, in the terms of a memorable discussion still fresh in our recollection. " My consciousness is distinctively my own," as a representative statement* runs, " and it is incon- ceivable how it should continue to be what it is for me and at the same time to be an element in a larger consciousness." The statement is made on psychological grounds, but with an eye to ethical considerations. This view does not apparently commit its holders to a view like that of Professor Howison, namely, that of a great self, a central entity round which are grouped innumer- able minor selves, though that would seem to be the fitting conception. But it may be that the feature of transcendence appears here too nakedly. And, though it looks a little like running with the hare and hunting with the hounds, the effort is made to maintain that, while the finite self must retain its integrity and God must remain an Other, yet He must somehow be thought of as the ground and the continuous support of these finite selves. Nevertheless, the transcendent feature is unmis- takably there. This seems to be a concession to religious demands rather than the admission of a logical necessity. There is force in Mr. Han- son's phrase about " the very natural reluctance on the part of many earnest thinkers to compromise the values of Christianity." But it is not so clear that this has provided a " stronghold for Metaphysics," though it may have furnished a sanctuary for some metaphysicians. Metaphysics maintains itself by keeping alive * Galloway, Philosophy of Religion, p. 476. P2</page><page sequence="32">228 ALEXANDER MAIR. the thought of the possibility of an intelligible synthesis. It stands for and strives towards unity. Critics may properly insist upon the difficulties and defects of monistic systems, and in much more convincing ways than that expressed in the forcible but unimpressive words of Troeltsch quoted by Miss Oakeley. It is but just that protest should be made against a too summary and hasty closing of the philosophical account. But an ostensible synthesis can only be criticized effectively in the interests of a completer monism. Otherwise philosophy shrivels into the form of a " descriptive science " and so fails of its end. The concept God is taken here to be the expression of the philosophic ideal. Spinoza's proposition, " Quicquid est in Deo est " states philosophy's unfailing demand. It is the philosopher's compass, though not his map. The champions of transcendence, in the sense in which we have been considering it, have both the right and the duty to point to obstacles in the way and to bring to our notice such apparently recalcitrant "facts " as that of human personality and all that is concomitant therewith in the moral experience of mankind with its implication of "freedom" and self-determination, the inward conviction of uniqueness and the like. They are on quite sure ground in insist- ing that we shall not evade these or trample roughshod over them in the fervour of our desire to reach our goal. If it be urged, however, not only that we must not evade those obstacles but that they cannot be surmounted, and that philosophy in face of this final mystery must compromise, philosophy, in the patient pursuance of its appointed task, will for ever refuse to assent. There is no rest for it in an impasse of this sort. It is foolishness, of course, to minimize the problem of difference, and to pass over it the sponge of a high-sounding universalistic for- mula. But it is equally unwise to exalt difference into something absolute and to be overawed by it. For while its spectacular value is unquestioned and it furnishes entertainment for those</page><page sequence="33">THE IDEA OF A TRANSCENDENT DEITY. 229 whose delight is to passively contemplate the panorama of existence, it has in itself little meaning--indeed, no meaning, if taken absolutely. Difference demands unity in order that it may be known as difference. Only by being overcome does it come to be what it is for us. And, in so far as we explicitly seek to overcome differences and turn our thoughts and aspira- tions towards a universe, we are progressively conscious of this underlying or, I would prefer to say, suffusing unity which lives and manifests itself in all the members. Lotze, writing of things, says* : "Not only is the nature of things so adapted that they can supplement one another, so as to become the causes of results, but also the fact of their correspondence must be understood by reference to a continuous and substantial unity of all. This correspondence is not a lucky hit which alone has been realized among many equally possible but actually unrealized cases of non-adaptation of beings independent of one another and perfect self-dependence as regards their content- but it depends upon this, that all which exists is but one Infinite Being which stamps upon individual things in fitting form its own ever-similar and self-identical nature." So far this expresses what is intended by me. It is Spinoza's "': Quicquid est . . ." -with a difference. And, to come to the kernel of the present matter, can we not suggest that what is said d propos of things may also be said of persons ? Man, in the phrase which Professor Pringle-Pattison has made current, is ' organic to the world." He is also (and therefore) '" organic to God." There is immanence here. In the life of man there beats the pulse of the Eternal Life. It is manifestly impossible to find in our finite experience quite specific and satisfactory ways of rendering this, and to speak of a human being as a cell in the divine body or a personality as a " pulse of the eternal mind " is to use what are but dim adumbrations. But, if taken for what they are, they * Microcosmos, Eng. trans., II, 600. 601.</page><page sequence="34">230 ALEXANDER MAIR. may serve. Man belongs to the universe and to the ground of the universe, and that in no merely external way. Else one can but think of him, if one be interested at all in his meaning, as a troubled and transient phantom-words without a speaker- coming from nowhere, going nowhere. It may be merely temperamental and so unworthy of a philosopher, but I find it difficult to appreciate the force of the contentions, earnestly and eloquently advanced by thinkers who are entitled to the most careful hearing, that such a pressing of the immanental view at this point as against the transcendental impinges upon and impairs man's worth and status. It is said, as has already been pointed out, that such a view as is put forward here takes all the substance out of many of the highest human values and renders them illusory. Is this the case, or is it not rather true that human life as I have suggested becomes trivial and transitory without such a conception as is so much deplored by the advocates of transcendence in this particular form ? Theirs is a form of abstract separations which seems to do less than justice either to God or man. It goes to strange lengths on occasion when men who would disclaim any suggestion that we can tamper with even the precession of the equinoxes will, in the interests of human independence, assert that we can frus- trate the will of God. A melancholy kind of " dignity." We are familiar enough with the repeated protests made against what is called the " abstract individual," who appears in certain political and social theories. The protests are justified. My collaborators write of ghosts. Here is a veritable ghost. It is a commonplace to us that it is in and through participation in the life of that greater entity-I had almost said greater person -that the "individual " takes, as it were, solid shape, acquires personality, significance and dignity. It is by participating in that richer and fuller life, in being the agent and the functionary of a more enduring, far-reaching purpose than his individual</page><page sequence="35">THE IDEA OF A TRANSCENDENT DEITY. 231 " will to live " that he acquires merit and worth. If that be so at this level of integration it would seem afortiori to be also the case at that higher level at which we must place ourselves in contemplating man as the citizen of the universe, a functionary (or, better, a function) of God. This ought to be dignity enough and status enough for the most exacting. Before departing from all this and since " values " are in question, it may not be entirely irrelevant to enter a modest plea on behalf of the value of intelligibility, a value which should not be without interest and importance to those who pursue philosophy. We sometimes tend, intimidated a little perhaps by suggestions such as Mr. Hanson makes as to the " superstitious " character of the full-blown rationalist, to wilt at the mention of " value " and to retire upon a not too coherent neo-empiricism where the especial philosophic value has less than its rights. But, returning to the main point, the insistence upon the important aspect of immanence does not make it impossible at the same time to contend for the feature of transcendence also. Not in the deistic nor in the ordinary theistic sense, but in the sense of an excelling or surpassing. This, indeed, appears to come out of the considerations already advanced. For while it is contended that the ens realissimum appears and manifests itself and must appear and manifest itself at every point of reality, it is not asserted that the manifestation is equally full in each case, nor that it is complete in the fullest revelation of the real yet made to man. The closing note of the discussion in the Republic, of which we gave at an earlier point the opening note, expresses well, mutatis mutandis, the point which it is desired to emphasize here. Though it is familiar enough, we may set it down once more: " We must say that to what is known, not only its being known is imparted by the Good, but also its being and existence, though the Good itself is far beyond existence in dignity and power."* * Republic, 509, Bosanquet's translation.</page><page sequence="36">232 ALEXANDER MAIR. If " knowledge of God " were to imply our knowing the ground of all objects whatsoever as an object among objects, an existent "out there " over against other existents, then we should have to agree with Kant in his denial of the claim that God can be known. It may be that He is not even an object to Himself, but simply "enjoys " Himself, and at this vanishing or cul- minating point the warrant of realism ceases to run. But though we cannot achieve the impossible, because absurd, it does not seem necessary to conclude that we are condemned to an invincible ignorance. As we come to know a man through his words and deeds we may, we must on the presumption of imma- nence, apprehend Deity in the measure in which we comprehend the universe. And yet here our approach cannot be other than asymptotic. Were the universe completely luminous to us, pierced through and through to its remotest recesses by the light of science, we should still know that there was a beyond and that God cannot be equated with His "works." And we recognize that we still are some distance on the better side of such a possi- bility as has been named. Man, the first of creatures, on this planet at least, in whom the all-pervasive life becomes self- conscious, knows but too well the narrow limits of his illumina- tion. It is to this that Anatole France is giving perhaps pictur- esque expression when he throws out the remark that we may hope to have a science of biology in about a million years. The light of our intelligence illuminates but a narrow patch in a vast expanse of dark and tumbling seas. This very sense of limitation, however, is significant. It suggests to us Bosanquet's not unreasonable characterization of man as a finite-infinite creature. In his striving after the extension of knowledge he exhibts a nostalgie de l'infini, which infinite indeed is in him but far surpasses him. Miss Oakeley's use and application of Spinoza's idea of</page><page sequence="37">THE IDEA OF A TRANSCENDENT DEITY. 233 infinite attributes is helpful and instructive in this connexion-- if we do not press it too literally. The scheme of substance and attributes is perhaps too rigid for a situation like this, leading us to think of beams from a central light or, less worthily, of spokes radiating from a hub and with no relation save the quasi-formal relation of being concentric. But the main point is there and in a vivid if not an adequate shape. The notion of infinite manifes- tations themselves of varying grades of fullness, as the life of a man--it is our poor best in the way of analogy--may be expressed in a rough blow or in the genial wielding of the sculptor's chisel, in an inarticulate cry or in an epic. " Life-force " is possible, but it seems to leave something to be desired, perhaps it is the crude implications of the term " force." The " life " of which it is here written is one that thinks and loves and understands; it is no mere blind striving. It is doubtful if this manner of contending for transcendence is likely to bring any kind of satisfaction to, or command any assent from, many religious believers or doctors, and so far as it is a defence of belief in transcendence they may regard it as a " gift of the Greeks." This is hardly relevant since our business is with philosophic tenability and not with any other kind of edification. At the same time, it may be said that the conception does not appear to me to be at all foreign or antagonistic to a religious attitude. What is more relevant is the possible objection that it is strange doctrine to emanate from a monistic quarter. This, I think, is only so if we think of the advance of knowledge in the linear way and not as the expansion and elucidation of a developing unity. The fear that if it were taken in earnest the conception would weaken and indeed immobilize the impulse towards knowledge has no substantial ground. It is a con- ception that is indeed witnessed to by the life of knowledge and is at least to those who aie content with the wages of going on- which means to all good philosophers-an incitement and an inspiration.</page><page sequence="38">IV. By CLEMENT C. J. WEBB. THE question which is propounded for our discussion in this Symposium may be understood in two ways: in one of which I should reply to it in the negative, while in the other I should give an affirmative answer. Professor Wildon Carr has frequently, and especially in his recent work called A Theory of Monads, called attention to the important part played in the philosophy of the seventeenth century by the notion of a transcendent God, in relation to which Descartes and Leibniz, to name no others, discussed such philo- sophical problems as those of mind and matter, substance and individuality, which do not (or at least need not) arise out of a specifically religious experience, but are suggested rather by the scientific investigation of natural phenomena. Professor Carr has insisted that, while at bottom these fathers of modern specu- lation were engaged upon the same region of inquiry as interests those who, like himself, are now concerned with the philosophical interpretation of the " principle of relativity " which has been brought forward in our own day as an inference from certain observations and experiments of astronomers and physicists, yet the phraseology which they employed, and which assumed the existence of a transcendant Deity, has become for us obsolete. " In modern philosophy," as he puts it,* " the idea of God is part of the general problem of individuality. In the seventeenth century the theological concept of God was the beginning and central point of speculation. This," he continues, " was due to the strong human interest aroused by the religious reformation of the sixteenth century." At any rate, the word God, as em- ployed by the philosophers of the seventeenth century, suggested * A Theory of Monads, p. 117.</page><page sequence="39">THE IDEA OF A TRANSCENDENT DEITY. 235 to their first readers and to most of themselves ideas which had their roots in religious experience, although they made use of it in dealing with inquiries in regard to which it is possible and indeed desirable to abstract from religious experience altogether. Anyone who compares the statement of the so-called ontological argument by Descartes with the statement of it by Anselm in the eleventh century will feel that, even although we may consider that the upshot of Anselm's reasonings was only to establish the legitimacy of the philosophical conception of an " Absolute," yet to Anselm himself, truly philosophical as his thinking is, his religious experience is its starting point and suffuses it through- out ; while Descartes, though we need not deny that Christianity and even Roman Catholicism were, as Professor Jacques Chevalier in his recent book upon him has urged, matters to him of genuine and intimate personal conviction, is yet primarily interested in the theory of knowledge, and it is his concern with the problems of the physicist and the psychologist, not, as with Anselm, the quest of salvation and of reconciliation with God, that inspires him in his speculation. It is no doubt true that one great thinker of the same period, Spinoza, deliberately laid aside the tradition of a transcendent God, while not disusing the word which suggested it to his contemporaries. But that, in so doing, he was departing from the common usage of his time is shown by the fact that he was regarded as an " atheist," notwithstanding his appropriation of the old language to his own " immanent " Deity; while he was probably enabled the more readily to detach that language from its old associations that he had, on the one hand (as Mr. Leon Roth's learned monograph * has lately pointed out) different theological antecedents from those of his Gentile contemporaries, and, on the other hand, a natural capacity for religious emotion greater than that of either Descartes or Leibniz, and therefore less strictly bound up than theirs with traditional assumptions. * Spinoza, Descartes and Maimonides, Oxford, 1924.</page><page sequence="40">236 CLEMENT C. J. WEBB. A change, which Mr. Hanson in his paper not unjustly describes as a revolution, has since the seventeenth century passed over the mood of European speculation, in consequence of which the conception of God, so far as it enters into general philosophy, has become the conception not of a transcendent Creator, but of an immanent unity. To give a full account of this change would be to write the history of modern philosophy. It is sufficient here to observe that two movements of thought have mainly con- tributed to bring it about. One is the movement in philosophy itself toward a fuller realization that the ultimate unity, in the search for which philosophy has always been engaged, and to which the name of God was traditionally given, must not, if it is to meet the demand for the satisfaction whereof it was invoked, leave the manifold which it is introduced to unify, outside of itself. The other is the advance of biological science, which has made the hypothesis of an external designer of the " adaptation " of means to ends observed in organisms at once less necessary to account for certain facts and more difficult to reconcile with others, while almost inevitably suggesting to the investigator the thought that results such as seem at first sight to postulate conscious purpose may be actually attained by some kind of immanent " urge," elan vital, or the like, without any conscious- ness of an end being present to an individual mind at all. When the conception of evolution is taken seriously by philo- sophy, the tendency in the latter to what we may call " immanent- ism " is greatly reinforced. By Herbert Spencer evolution was still on the whole regarded as a process in which nothing genuinely new is produced, and his own cosmology was ultimately cyclical, like that of the ancient thinkers of India and of Greece. The old theistic argument that a world in which mind and will have appeared postulates mind and will in its Author can be urged against him, because he does not affirm that (as we may perhaps put it) the stream of existence can rise higher than its source. It</page><page sequence="41">THE IDEA OF A TRANSCENDENT DEITY. 237 cannot be as well pressed upon a thinker like Bergson, with his creative evolution, or like Croce, who explicitly rejects theism on the ground that it reduces the historical process to an idle repro- duction of what is already perfectly realized from eternity in God. For such the Aristotelian principle that evepyt7e must ultimately be prior to ;va/r does not hold; and there is thus no common ground between them and those who rely upon arguments for theism which, like Aristotle's own, presuppose this principle. If, then, the question before us be understood as asking whether the belief in a transcendent God can be maintained as a philo- sophical tenet entering into our general account of the material universe and of its relation to the mind that apprehends it, I should reply that it can no longer play this part as it did in the systems of Descartes and of Leibniz. In that sense I should answer our question in the negative. But it is otherwise if the question be otherwise interpreted. Philosophy after all must take all our experience into account, and religious experience does seem to me to imply what we may call the transcendence of God. But then the God of religious experience is not merely what Pascal calls the dieu des philosophes et des savants; although this latter would probably never have been called by the name of God at all had not Philosophy entered from the first into a field already occupied by Religion, which was beforehand with it in giving expression to man's natural aspir- ation after a solution of the ultimate problems suggested by experience to our reason. If by " philosophically tenable " we mean not merely tenable as a principle to be utilized in dealing with questions of general philosophy, into which the considera- tion of the demands of religious experience need not enter but "tenable as true and not only as a figure of speech "-then I should answer our question in the affirmative, because I consider that otherwise our religious experience is inexplicable. There does not seem to be anything inadmissible in the view that our</page><page sequence="42">238 CLEhIENT C'. 3. WEBB. religious experience should reveal to t1S something about the ltimate reality srhich is not otherwise revealed to us. In fact the recognition that it does so is involved in the acknowledgment of its right to be regarded as an independent or autonomous form of experience or spiritual activity at all. It is thus noticeable that Croce, who, as we have already observed, very deliberately and decisively pronounces the transcendence of GEod philosophically untenable, connects his position with a no less deliberate and decisive refusal to regard religion as an independent or autonomous form of our spiritual life. And apparently Professor Carr would do the like. " The God in whom we trust," he says,* " is an idol of our imagination." Regarding the so-called ontological argument as opposed in its direction to the other two traditional proofs of God's existence, he prefers it to therll, as expressing the intuition of a unity of body and mind, thought and action, function and structure, " which is the basis of the necessity of thought which posits the idea of God, the idea of a higher unity, the infinite individual whose essence involves existence.": To this idea of God, while consider- ing it as alone possessing philosophical va]ue, he explicitly denies any power to satisfy the aspirations of religion in the ordinary sense of that word. And, if he does not say so as plainly as Croce, he at least leaves the impression that this is not because in religious experience there are disclosed features of reality from which abstraction is made in the speculations which he is dis- cussing, but rather because, as he says,§ " the ?hilosophical conception of God lies on a higher plane " than that on which " ordinary religious experience moares.5 The revolt of Pascal, the most religious among the great scientific men of the seventeenth century, from the dteu des phtlosophes e! des sawaqts to the " Gtod of Abraham, of Isaac, and * A Theory of Mds, p. loo. t Ibid., p. 118. $ Ibid., p. 119. § Ibid., p. l00.</page><page sequence="43">THE IDEA OF A TRANSCENDENT DEITY. 239 of Jacob," and the detestation of a very different man of genius in the next age, the poet Blake, the originality and profundity of whose religious experience is as remarkable as the strangeness and waywardness of its expression, for " this Natural Religion-this impossible absurdity "* alike bear witness to the fact, to which I wish to call attention, that the " rational theology," so roughly handled by Kant, was vitiated by the use in it of the divine name apart from a definite reference to the religious experience which alone gives to that name a meaning that cannot be better expressed by a term less suggestive of " transcendence." At the opposite pole to the " immanentism " (if I may so call it) of which I have been speaking, stands a school of thought which, until the other day, when his lamented death deprived the philosophical fraternity in this country of one of its most dis- tinguished and most beloved members, had a powerful champion in the late Dean Rashdall. Theologians of this school are inclined to dismiss, as merely figuratively significant of a close conformity of human will and judgment to the divine, such familiar religious language as speaks of ourselves dwelling in God and God in us. Such language seems to them impossible otherwise to reconcile with the attribution of genuine personality either to God or to man. Against this contention I have often found myself main- taining that it overlooks essential features of religious experience which make it impossible to regard God as just another person (however superior in power, wisdom and goodness) side by side (so to say) with oneself. But the contrary doctrine, which, while appealing to the witness borne by mysticism to the immanence of God in finite spirits, treats on the other hand as merely figurative the religious language in which the soul's sense of a personal relation to God is expressed, lies, as it seems to me, open to an analogous criticism. Apart from religious experience the necessity of this language can no more be perceived than can that of the * Milton, 42.13.</page><page sequence="44">240 CLEMENT C. J. WEBB. language of mystical piety. But both are necessary for the expression of that experience. Both are no doubt in a certain sense figurative or metaphorical; but only in a sense which is compatible with being the only language wherein the experience described by it could be expressed ; not in the sense that it would be possible to describe it more plainly and simply (and therefore better) in some less figurative phraseology. I think that there is a real analogy to this situation in the revelation by our social intercourse with one another at once of an independence and of a capacity for fellowship which, if abstrac- tion be made from the experience of such intercourse, it must appear difficult to reconcile on the one side with the unity of reality--emphasized by what is sometimes called "monistic " philosophy-and, on the other, with the independence of individual personality emphasized by what we may, with Professor Carr, describe as "monadic " philosophy. I call this an analogy, because I should accept almost all that Professor Alexander says in his admirable discrimination of religious from social experience in Space, Time and Deity.* They are not the same, but there is nothing so like the one as the other; and both, as I should say, reveal about their respective objects something that, apart from them, must remain unperceived. Theology then is the science of religious experience and not the last chapter of a non-religious metaphysic; and the problem of the nature of the ultimate unity or of the supreme individuality should only be stated as the problem of the nature of God, when religious experience is explicitly taken into account. It was the error of the " rational theology " of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries that it tended to assume as a factor in a non-religious problem a conception that derived all its significance from an experience which was nevertheless regarded by it rather as a consequence of that conception than as its source. * ii, pp. 380, 381.</page></plain_text>
