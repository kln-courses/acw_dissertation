<plain_text><page sequence="1">47 III.-TIME, NECESSITY, LAW, FREEDOM, FINAL CAUSE, DESIGN IN NATURE. By SHADWORTH H. HODGSON. IT is the property of Dialectic to raise problems, it is the property of Analysis to solve them ;--just the reverse of the ordinary conception of philosophy, accordincg to which it is Metaphysic which propounds, Dialectic which solves, philoso- phical questions. Of the terms composing the title of the present paper, Tirne is that which will be found to colntaini the key to the puzzles, of which the other terms are lnames. But it is Time as discovered and laid bare by subjective, that is, metaphysical analysis, Timie conceived, not as a single enmpirical and yet purely formal entity, but as an inseparable co-elenment in every, even the least, empirical experience, incapable by itself of empirical, that is, separable existence, and yet real in the sense of contributing, as an inseparable co-elemiient, to make all empirical experience what it is. Nothing can be- more futile as a philosophical method thani that kind of Dialectic which consists in taking our ideas, concepts, or categories, as data, defining them severally by what we suppose to be their essential nature, and then seeking to bring them into some systematic construction, free from mutual contradiction. It is a delusion to suppose that, because all philosophy is thinlking, and the very process of thinking turns everything it thinks of into general ideas or concepts, therefore it can think of nothing which is not already a general idea or concept. It is a delusion closely parallel to that which leads us to imagine that, because mathematic begins and proceeds by numbering and making units, therefore units and numbers exist as entities in nature before we begin to count; a delusion to</page><page sequence="2">48 SHADWORTH H. HODGSON. wlicih probably is in a great measure owing that famious puzzle of the One and the Many, which has exercised the ingenuity of g,olden academic youth in all ages, beginnina with that of the first Academy. For the mathematical priority of 1 to 2, of 2 to a, andi so oii, in the operation of counting, becomes as it were -a bridge, by ,which we fallaciously transfer the distinction between the One and the Many to the order of real genesis in Nature, and so endeavour to conceive the One as the originator, or fertile womb, of the Many, instead of regarding, both alike as produlcts of thought applied to perception. A few words bearing oIn these points will be found later on, when I come to spealk of Laws of Nature. Thouglht, on the contrary, far from assuming -its own result, general concepts, as its own pre-supposition, both can and does de fcacto distinguish, in the moment of thinking,a the object tlhoug,ht of from its own present dealing with that object; that is, it deals with it irrespective of the change which its present operation is working in it, that operation being, not at that moment objectively before it. Unless this were so, we could never think of anything as simply present or as an individual, apart from its membership of a class, or from its particular as opposed to its individual character. True, we classify it even inl calling it simply present or irndividual; but this classifying results from ou1r present thinking of it, and does lnot belong to the object thouLght of prior to our thinking of it. Now this being so, thought both can and, in philosophy, otught to distinguish, not only between its object thought of and its own present dealing with that object, but also, within that obeject, between a part or parts which are its owln presupposi- tion, whether as condition or as material, and its ownl law or conlstitution as a thinking process. A thinking process with self-created or self-creating concepts, ideas, or categories, is not an ultimate datum. of experience, but a fictitious entity, obtained b)y disregarding the analysis of the really experienced thinking process, which is something highly conmplex, and partly if not</page><page sequence="3">TIME AND DESIGN IN NATURE. 49 clhiefly depenidenit, for its nature anid properties, upon simpler states and processes of consciousness. This miiethod of pllilosophising, this kiijd of Dialectic, is therefore bad for several reasonis, the chief of which miiay perhaps be stated as follows: First. Becauise it has tacitly or opeiily to assume an energy or agency, either in abstract thought itself, or in its concepts, ideas, or cateaories, or in some traniscendental Ego or Subject, as thinking agent. Secolnd. Because it takes the ideas, or whatever thlings are named by single words, as themselves single, without advertinig to the fact, that names which are descriptive describe things by what they are predolmiinantly, not by what they are solely or exclusively; thereby settig, up quite fictitious entities as ultimate realities. Third. Because it assumes that the formi of consciousness giveni ill thoug,ht is ultimate, without enquiring wlhether thought itself is not condlitionied uponi theJ nature of the object-matter with and uponi which it is said to operate. All these assumptions are wholly unwarranlted as in'itial assumptions in philosophy. They denaturalise it, inasmuclh as they make it arbitrary, dependent on the ideas, concepts, ol categories, which may happen to commenid themselves as ultimate to particular thinkers, and oln the definitions which they may choose to g,ive, as expressiiog their essential nature. But now to comle somewhat closer to the special questionis of this paper. There are two well-known ways of approaching phenomena with the purpose of increasing knowledge, the scientific and the philosophical, wllich together exhaust and cover the entire field. Of these the scientific assumes, to begin with, the existence of some generally admitted real objects of commlon-sense ideas, desig,nated usually by singrle words, which fall under the two comprehensive classes of-Matter, with its eniergies, onl one side; Miind, with its energies, on the other, the I)</page><page sequence="4">50 SIIADWOITH H. HODGSON. object-mlatter respectively of physical and psyclhological science. Each endeavouirs to arrive at a kniowledge of the nature of its objects, whiclh are assumed to be realities, by watching them in operation, and ascertaining the laws of their processes, inter- actions, history, and evolution. And this being so, it is clear that no branch of science ever gets beyond the range of common-sense ideas, sinlce it is restricted by its own initial assumptions-namely, by its ideas (or no-ideas) of those assumed realities-Matter, with its energies, oni the olne side, Mind, with its energries, on the other, wllich it has taken as its basis and starting point. The other or philosophical way of approachinlg phenomena is very different. It makes no assumptions to begin with, but, in approaclling phenomena from the subjective side, begins by analysing the knowledge which we have of them-that is to say, consciousness or experience itself, apart from any assump- tion that it is we who have the consciousness, or that either we or nattter are the objects known in or by the consciousness. Experience per se is the thing anialysed. How experience is possible, is a question to be answered, if at all, by means of analysing experience itself. In fact, the two first and most important questions of philosophy are those concerning the reality of those, two objects which science assumes to begin with, on the warrant of common-sense, Matter and Mind with their several energies. What we mean by reality, what we mlean by being, what we meani by energy, and so on, through an indefinitely loing list of current words and phrases, are among the first questions which philosophy proposes to itself, and, for anlswers to which, it goes, not to hypothesis, but to analysis of experienice. Not to menition that even hypotheses must be drawn ultimately from experience, since the imagination of thenm nmust have been suggested by it. Moreover, no limits of any kind are assumed, to begin with, by the philosophical line of thought; it does not assume that experience is limited in any way whatever. Neither does it</page><page sequence="5">TIME AND DESIGN IN NATURE. 51 asstime that it is unlimited. The idea of a limit, boundary, or linmitation, like every other idea, is itself drawn from and dis- covered in phenomena. The field of science anid scientific hypotheses is therefore contained within, and its conceptions are valid only withini, the field of philosophy. No hypothesis concerning the origin, the genesis, the reason, the possibility, of the field of philosophy-tlhat is, of experience-is possible. Science itself limits its own field by assuming particular objects -Matter witlh its energies, and Mind with its energies-as its given basis. Whatever pretension the criticist, or ileo-criticist, or absolutist, or any other so-called philosophical school may make, to give an account of the origin, genesis, reason, or possibility of experience as an analysanduni, you will find in the enid that they are accounting for it only on the assumption of the existence of some particular individual Mind, or some particul'ar Energy of such a mind-say, for instanice, of Thouaht -al assuniption which presupposes the existence of that which they are professing, to account for. In short, there is no datum beyond experience as ani ancnlysandimm; being a datuim mneans beingb withini it or co-extensive with it. When from this experience we have got the ideas of end and beginning, of limitation, of difference anid similarity, of kniowing and not knowing, anid so on, then indeed we can and do distin,guish between a part of the field of experience which is positively knowni or knowable, and another part which is not positively known or knowable, and again between a part which is positively known to exist, anid another part which is positively known inot to exist. But all these and such like distinctiolns of experience lie within the field of experience as an analysacndu2n; and this is why we have somiie sort of grip even of what is non-existent, unreal, purely imaginary, or pure nothing, or, in other words, how it is that these and similar words have a meaning for us. Moreover, we have ili subjective analysis, or analysis of experience simply,. a test of completeness, which is wanting in D 2</page><page sequence="6">62 SHADWORTH H. HODGSON. merely scientific procedure; I mean the circumstance of our arriving at elements in it, which taken by themselves are simple, and yet cannot stand or be experienced alone, but require sonie equally simple co-element in order to enter into experience at all. This circumstaiice, which gives a limit and completeness to the metaphysical principle which I have named the distinction of inseparables, supplies a new justifica- tion for holding all philosophy to be metaphysical, as goinlg beyond the concrete or empirical, while at the same time it never carries us beyond the region of experience, nor adnmits of a recourse to so-called noumeinal entities beyond phenomena. All such entities would, in fact, be empirical, though purely imaginiary. The scienltific line of thought is thus for ever precluded from successfully expanding into a philosophy, in either of its main branches, physical or psychical. It places itself, by its initial assumption, at the point of view of the Existent, as if the meaning of this term was known a priori, instead of at the p)oint of view of Experience, or Knowledge of existelnce. But of the two terms, Existence aind Experienlce, it is only Experience which neither calls for nor admits of explanation. It and its meaning are onie. It is the evidenice but not the creator of the Existeint. But perhaps you will say, is it not itself an existent, and that in its whole extent, so that it is itself the only existent of which it gives evidelnce, and is evidence and existence in one ? That it is so is the cointenitioin of what is known as philosophic Idealism. But to answer the question so raised, that is, whether experience, or consciouslness as a knowing, does or does not contain evidence of the existence of something other than consciousness itself, we mutst go to the analysis of experi- enice or consciousness, and niowhere else. It is as necessary to do so in the solution of this the Idealistic contention, as it is in answer to the contention of physicists or psychologists, wlhen they attempt to base philosophy upon the assumption</page><page sequence="7">TIME AND DESIGN IN NATURE. 53 either of Matter or of Mind. And it is so for the same reason, namtiely, that it is only in consciousness or experience that the meaniiig of either of the terms, Being or Existence, is to be found, and that to begin a philosophy witlh the dogma, that these ternis have no other meaning but experience or conl- sciousness, is to claim an a priori knowledg,e of the meaning of those terms, whicli is an unwarranted assumption. Idealism must stand or fall by the results of subjective analysis. What, then, does subjective analysis tell us in respect of those ternis wlhich form the purpose of the present paper ? I will beg,in with the first of them-time, and bring it into connection witlh the three next-necessity, law, and freedomii. Its elucidatory power depends entirely on that feature in it whiclh is revealed by subjective analysis, its being an element only, but also an inseparable and indispensable element, in all experience. Taken in this way it is a continuum which is the pre-requisite of, and also overlaps, as it were, every division or limitation; no beginning or end of it can be presented or represented in consciousness; all divisions fall within it, for these tare derived from differences in its co-elemenit of feeling or qualitative contenlt; so that wherever, or in whatever empirically real object of experience or of thought, we may take either a beginning or an end of existence to lie, we are comipelled to recognise that we have taken, aiid can take, no absolute beginning or end, but only one which has reference to our present state of knowledge, and not only so, but that also no absolute beginninig or eiid is ever possibly representable in thouglit. Time, moreover, as such a continuous and inseparable element, cannot be treated as if it were itself an empirical or complete object; it cannot be said to flow equably, or to flow at all; it is the conditioin, for empirical objects, both of their changing or moving, and also of their remiiaining uilchalnged or stationary. Nevertheless it is not itself fixed, nor are its parts simiultaileous. It is a continuumii, btut a peculiar one, a</page><page sequence="8">54 SHADWORTH H. HODGSON. conitiiluniii of tilIme; it is durationi, abstract duratioln but, though abstract, not general in the logical sense, not a logical 'but a perceptual uniVersal-that is to say, it is not tlhe object of a concept covering a nulmiber of particulars, as colour covers rcd, yellow, blute, and so on, but a single though abstract continiuous thing, having or capable of lhaving;, parts or portions distinguislhed in it; an abstract continluuml, in no part or portioni of which, however minute, or however simiiple its coliteilt, is the end simultaneous with the beginning. A fortiori tlle samel thlingo is true of longer portions, however great their lentlh. On these accounits we lhave to tlinik of the universe as infinite, in the sense of existing in tille, anid having no absolute beginnin-lg or end; at the same time it mliust be thought of as a single thina, owinig to the same feature of tirne-conitinuity; and this feature, it will be remarked, is a colndition to wlhiclh thoug,ht itself is subjected, not one wlhiclh it can conceive absenit or abolished, but one wlich is inlherent in every possible conltetit or object, in or upon which it operates. Thought itself moves only by drawinig ideal lines of momenltary arrest in a tilmle- process. Time is common to every mnode of colnsciousniess, thought ilncluided. When we think of tilile, or of the universe, as infinite, we entertain indeed definite thoughlts of them, but we do not reverse their infinity as objects tlhouglht of; nor do we make them into objects of logically greneral terms or concepts; we treat them as individuals, just as whell we say this individual man, thbis particuilar tree-that is to say, having, by thouhlit, classified themi, we return them againi, by thought, to the perceptual order, and our thouhlit of tlienii then silmply represents the perceptually given facts which enlforce anid are essential to that attribution of infillity. Now, it will be noticed that our thinlkinig is lhere subjected to a necessity, we cannot get rid of those features of coiltiniuity and ilnfinity which attach to all contents of consciousness or experience, independenitly of the operations of thought uponl or witlh theni. But what is imieant here by niecessity ? There</page><page sequence="9">TIME AND DESIGN IN NATURE. 55 are two miiaini kinids of necessity: onle the niecessity of constrainit or compulsion, the other that of thouglht, or log,ical necessity. To whiclh of these two kinds does the necessity here spokeii of lbelong, ? In some sort it may be said to belong to both, log,ical because it appears in the texture of concrete thought, coiii- pulsory because impose(l on, and irreversible byX, thought. But it becomiies a logrical necessity only when and because it is imiiposed on thouglht by its pre-logical conditioins; its source lies in those conditions, nlot in the thinkingt process itself. Its recognitioni is niot, like that of the principles of Identity, Contradiction, and Excluded Middle, involved in and essential to the thinkinig process as a process, as wlheln we say Black is Black, and isn't not-Black. It is ani uniiversal feature in -the perceptually giveni contenit or object of thought, but this universality need not be consciously made use of, in order that the tlhinking process should be carried on, thouah the disregarding it is inevitably attended with error in the coni- structions whiclh that process leads to. It is ani universality, but not a strictly logical necessitv, an universality of fact, not a logical niecessity of thought. There is lno logical necessity that there slhouild be an universe, a reality, an existence; there is no logical necessity that, being, they should be infinite. Tiiese thinlgJs are facts simply, but universal, practically inevitable, always founid when we find an ything. We caninot put a logical necessity at the beg,inning of Being, or of Existence. An(l this universality of simlple fact an(d timie- conltinuity, a perceptually given comprehenisiveniess, is plainly al very differenit thingy frolmi wlhat is kinowni as logical uniiver- sality, the uiniversality expressed by logical uniiversals or general termiis. But eveni strictly logical necessity, the necessity expressed by the laws of Identity, Contradictioin, and Excluded Middle, anid by Aristotle's Didctum de omnzFi, is ani instance of the great metaphysical law of the distilnction of insepar ables. It cannot be lhypostasised as a self-existent necessity. The</page><page sequence="10">056 SHADWORTH H. HODGSON. thinking process is a process of consciousness, consisting of changes in the process-content of consciousness, according to those logical laws just spoken of, and it is in obedience to, or rather fulfilment of, those logical laws that its necessity, knowln as logical necessity, consists. But as an existent process it depends upon, and is inseparable from, an energ,ty, or group of energies, which some conceive as belonging to and exerted by a physical agent, the brain, and others as belonging to and exerted by an immaterial or spiritual ag,ent, the Mind or the Ego; and in this, its existential character, no logical necessity attaches to it. In this character, namely, as an existential process, it has either no necessity at all, or whatever necessity it has is also of an existential character, falling under the head of the necessity of constraint or compulsion. And it mnakes no difference to the validity of this metaphysical distinction, whether we conceive the existential process, upon which the process of thought as a process of consciouisness immediately depends, as the process or activit.y of a physical or of an im-imaterial agent. It is as an existent process simply, that it is exempt from logical necessity. Logical necessity is a necessity entirely within consciousness as a knowing, a thought about facts whereby we seek to give a reason for their existence, not itself a fact as distinguished from the thought of it, but a thought which only as suich is a fact. The necessity of constraint or compulsion, on tile other hand, may lie beyond immediate consciousness as a knowing, because appertaining to facts in their existeiitial character, in which it and they may be kniowable only as objects of iniference. We see, tlhen, fromii what lhas now been said, that if we take pure thought-that is, the thiuking process per se-as our primary datum, the awareness of logical necessity precedes alld donminates the awareniess of universality as a fact, because tlhought, of which it is the law, belongs to the subjective aspect of things, and the subjective aspect, being, a klnowing, is the condition of our knowingr fact, that is, being or existence of</page><page sequence="11">TIME AND DESIGN IN NATURE. 57 every kind, which is the objective aspect of things, inclusive of all its features, universality being one of tliem. We can then readily imagine, thougyh erroneously, that universality of iact, the perceptually given kind of universality, is a particular case of logical necessity, or conditioned upon it as the more funda- menital and comprehensive fact of the two. The trutlh, as we can now see, is, that logical necessity -is in no otlher way the prius or foundation of universality of fact, thain as it is involved in the knowing or thoulght of such universality, that is, in just the same way, and the same sense, as it is involved in the thouight of alny other feature in facts, say, for instance, their conitingenicy, transitoriness, particularity, or complexity. In short, log,ical niecessity belongs wholly to the subjective aspect or knowing of things. If, however, you objectify it as being itself a fact, you ipso facto subsume it under the conception of universality, which from this the objective or existential point of view is the more comprehensive conception of the two, anid are compelled to seek for the explanation of the uiniformlity of its laws, il just the same way as for that of anly other equally complex psychological function; Tlhis, however, compels a recourse, in all inistances, to the pre-logical or perceptual data of experienice, wllich are the presuppositioni and material of thougght. There is, therefore, no possibility of placing logical necessity at the source of thinigs, uniless it be by ascribing real agency or efficiency to thought, simply as a special part of the subjective aspect or knowing of things, that is to say, by imagining it to be being and klnowing at once, anid in onie anid the same respect, self-existent, and creative of its own content. The other kind of necessity, necessity in the sense of constraint and com- pulsion (includingr, of course, attractive as wvell as repulsive forces), belongs clearly to the objective or existenltial aspect of things, as its contrary, freedom, also does; aild all cases of it iimnst plainily lie witlhin, nlot beyonid, the universe of things, wlhicll, as we hav e seen, is inevital)ly, as a fact, conceived</page><page sequence="12">58 SHADWORTH II. HODGSON. as infinite in time, owinig to tiimie being coniitnuous and ani inseparable element in all experieniee. The conception universe preclu'des the possibility of intelligibly putting the question concerning it, whether its existenice is free or compelled. And here I approa.ch that part of tlhesubject of this paper which will to miianiy, perhaps, be tlle mllost interesting. Is there such a thing as freedoom or free action in the really existinig univ'erse ? And if there is, theni is the psychological functioni of will or volitioni capable of it ? Is free-will a fact? Of course, it is not my intention to argue this old question at any lerngrtlh, but only to nmake some few reiriarks which may serve to put the point of view from which to regard it in its true light. We all know what is miieant by compuilsion or constraint. Every particle of matter, organic and inorlganic, must be con- ceived as possessinig and capable of exerting somie degree of energy. When the energies exerted by one group or groups of material particles repress or deflect those exerted by another group or groups of such particles, thle actioni of the latter group or groups is said to be compelled or constrained by the action of the former. The requisite conditions, in the enivironment, for both actions are, of course, presupposed. Wheni, the sanme presupposition being made, the energies exerted by any group or groups are Inot so comlipellcd or constrained by the energies of ainother grouEp or gyroups, btut are left to exert themselves in obedienlce to the internal conistitutioni of the group or groups they belong to, theni the action of those groups is sai(d to be free. I think it will be generally adinitted that there are many actiolns-namuely, those iuniversally classed as volitional or voluntary-wlhich must colmle unlder this coniceptioni of freedoni, anid that they milist do so, wlhetlher we take tlhelni as energies exerted by singc,le immiiiiaterial agenits, or by groups of material particles of br:aini substance. I take freedolni, there- fore, in. this ordinary anid emipirical semise of tlle term, as an established fact; anid I th-iink tlhat free-will, in this seinse of the termii, is the fact wlicil chiefly conitribtutes to give us both</page><page sequence="13">TIME AND DESIGN IN NATURE. 59 what is called the sense of freedom, anid also what is called the sense of responsibility, wheni the Suibject's attention is drawn to the nature of hiis ow}1 experienice in exercising volition. It is the questioni as to the trutlh of this sense of freedonm, and the truth of this sense of responisibility-that is, as to the reality of freedomi in free-will-whiclh gives this latter question its extreme interest and imlportance in Etlhic- anad Theology. The difficulty in solviig it lies in the elusive character of the agent, at least in the present state of our psychological know- ledge. We caninot, so to speak, lay hold of the Ego or inmmaterial agent per se; neither cani we (at anly rate at present) lay hold of aiid circuimscribe that group or groups of cerebral particles, or define those mnodes of cerebral action, which (in physiological psychology) are from tilme to time the agents or tlhe activities underlying volitional actioin. That is to say, we cannot observe the real agent at work, distingaiish him from other agents or extraneous energies, and ascertaill, either by inspection or initrospection or inference, that his action is self-determined or determined froi'i within. In default of this we have had recourse, as usual, to Dialectic, and to attempted definiitionis of freedoiL Some have asserted its reality, by supposing it to conisist in the self-determination of the univer-se. Others have denied its reality, by opposing it to determiination by uniform law, or laws of nature. Tlhese I think are the imaini heads- under which speculations con-cerning it fall. As to thie, first of these I have already argued, that nieither freedom nor necessity is a conception applicable to the universe in its totality, both of them being precluded by the conception of the universe ini its totality as infinite, and the conception of infinity overriding that of a closed or comlpleted totality. But a few words must be said on the second conception, that which opposes freedom, not to superior compelling energy, hut to uniforlm law, whiich it is mnaintailled adimits of nio breach</page><page sequence="14">60 SHADWORTH H. IIODGSON. unless we are prepared to admit the influx of Chaos, which again is itself a termn for a wholly unlilntelligible and unlthink- able idea. And at any rate it is perfectly true, that tlhe uniformity of law in all regions of the tiniverse, beyond as well as within the range of our positive knowledge, is an axiom, or postulate, or ideal, with which lno rational being can afford to dispense. At the satmie timiie it must be recogniised, that it is an uniformity whicih supposes unrenmittina clange, as the material subject to it. Nothing whatever, not eveii the smallest time-content, ever occurs twice exactly as it occurs once; but, along with its time-moverIient, somne chatige in its quiddity also must be conceived as taking place, were it only in virtue of its changre of 'elation to its environmient. Uniformity, in fact, presupposes chalnge, just as Idenitity pre- suipposes difference. But this does not derogate fronm the validity of either, as axioms of rational thoight anid know- ledge. I am not, therefore, about to deny the uniiversality of uniform law, but simply to maiintain that universal uniformnity, not being the contrtary of freedom or free activity, is in no way incompatible with the reality of freedomii. Law implies uniformity, anid uniiformiity law-; where there is one, there also is the other. And they are present in phenomena sirmply as observed, verified, iniferred, or anticipated features; no energy, force, activity, or agenicy, is included in the simple fact of lawu natural. But to oppose it to free- activity is ipso facto to attribuite activity or agency to it, that is, to hypostasise it as an agency of a particular, that is, an uniform kind. This goes, so to speak, beyond the record, and is an empiricist fallacy. It is not as if law inatural was like civil law, which is a rule laid down beforehanid to govern certaini actions, anid enlforced by the civil power of the law- giver behind it. Laws of Nature are made by, anid exhibited in, the actions which they are figuratively said to govern. They are inseparable features of those actionis, which are figuratively said to obey them. The actions producie the laws</page><page sequence="15">TIME AND DESIGN IN NATURE. 61 in producing themselves-that is, in their own course of pro- ceedilna. The opposite or empiricist fallacy arises from first distinguishing abstract law from abstract content, then forget- ting that so distinguished they are abstractionis made for convenienice of thinking, and then hypostasising them in imagination as separable entities, capable the one of governing, the other of being governed. To make entities of such abstrac- tionis is emipiricism. The energies of real agenits work- uniformly. To try to conceive them working otherwise is to try to conceive Chaos. That is the sinmple fact. But it is no justification for characterisinog that workina, that action, as unfree. This conception of the true relation of laws of nature to the operations which exhibit them flows imimediately fromii the conception of Time as an inseparable element of all phenomena, of all experience, which lhas been set forth above. At whatever poilnt we may, for the purpose of any inquiry, take as the origin, either of aniy phenomenon or set of phenomena, or of the knowable universe as a whole, we cannot but conceive it as existing, continuing, and proceeding in time, or (samiie thing) as inivolvilng time in itself and its proceeding. To conceive the existence of a law prior to such an origin, or not itself exliibiting the fact of existing, continuing, and proceeding, in tinme, is impossible. How there come to be uniiformities in natural operations is a misleading questioni; solnewhat like the question, how there come to be diflerences and similarities in senisationi. We find the uniiformities there as a fact,-that is all we cani say; and without them no other question about facts would be even intelligible. Nothinga is more astonishing in moderil timnes, and in wlhat calls itself philosophy, than that gross eiiipiricislmi now signalised, which colnsists in hypostasisingo, laws of niature, or the uniformiiity of the course of nature, as if they were efficielnt agencies, over and above the physical (or spiritual) agencies onl wlliclh they are said to be imiposed. It is a fallacy wlhichl lhas its</page><page sequence="16">62 SHADWORTH H. HODGSON. close parallel in that hypostasising of general terms or concep- tions, which is known as medi.val or Scholastic Realismn. What, let us ask, is a Law of Nature? It is a general -termii applied to processes, or energies, or actions, and grouping similar processes together, as other kinds of general terms group similar qualities, or attributes, or substances, together. And such general terms have jtst as little efficacy in producing the processes which they describe, and so in governilg the Coourse of Nature, as those other general terms have in pro- ducing the qualities, attributes, or substances, which they serve to group. Similar agents in similar circumstances will act in similar ways, and produce similar results, at whatever times you may take them; but the agenicies to which this similarity of operation is due belong to the agents, niot to imaginary laws imposed upon the agents fromi wvithout. It will help us, perhaps, to apply here the scholastic distinietioni between Un-iversals ante rem, in re, and post rem, a distinction which is quite as applicable to the mlathematical, or as they may be called perceptual, universals, numbers, and figures, as to logical universals or general terms. It is onily universals post remn that are positively kinowil to us. We tlhink of them, ilndeed, as actually existing, Tn re, and in. the case of the mathematical universals, perceive and imagine theni as so existing; but then, in both cases, they ipso facto lose their character as logictal ulniversals or general conceptions; we do not know them in re' as universals, and at the same tinme as distinguishable elements, in the res to which they belong. In the mathematical case, it is always an individual numLber or figure which we perceive or imagine. Now, Laws of Nature .are universals which have their real existence as universals in re. Universals ante rem are fictitious entities made by stirreptitiously assigning to universals post rem a separable existence, prior to and contributiiig to condition the inature of the res, from whiich the knowledge of them, as uniiversals post rern, is derived.</page><page sequence="17">TIME AND DESIGN IN NATURE. 63 It will be observed that the conception of freedom or free activity, including free-will, is one of those common-sense conceptions or ideas which are the explicanda or real problems of philosophy. It will also, I think, be evident, that the result of applying suibjective analysis to the conception of free activity will be to establish the reality of a class of free actions, in this the ordiniary sense of the terni, as contradistinguished from constrained or compelled actions; which, in the case of free-will, is a sufficient basis for relying on the truth of what we call the sense of freedoom, and the sense of our own responsibility for our free actions. At the same tinle, the same analysis removes both freedom on the one hand, and necessity, compulsion, and constraint on the other, from the class of ultimate characteristics, or unanalysable properties of activity, mutually exclusive, to the possession of one or the other of which every action is supposed to owe its essential nature of being either free or bond. On such a dialectical basis as the last sentence depicts, one may go on arguing for ever, either for or acgainst the reality of free activity; andI the case of volition will always offer what, on such a basis, will always seem an irresistible arguinent for its reality, in the sense of freedom which accompaniies it. A supposed immediate sense of freedom will always seem to be at least an equipoise to any argument against its reality, drawn on a dialectical ba*is, either from the conception of logical necessity, or from that of an uniiformly operating power, con- ceptions which must logically lead to the division of the universe between the two wholly uninitelliaible entities, pure activity oni the one hand, and pure passivity on the other. But then the sense of freedom in volition is no more a proof of the reality of freedom, taken as an unanalysable ultimate, than the Reidian sense of the reality of Matter is a proof of the reality of Matter, against the disproof of it offered by Berkeleyan Idealism. It is subjective or, as I prefer to call it, metaphysical analysis, which alone seems to me to put these questions in their truie light, while at the same time it</page><page sequence="18">64 SHADWORTH H. HODGSON. supports the truth of the conceptiolns of freedom, free-will, andl responsibility, taken as colmmon-sense objects thought of, and not as ultimate factors which enter as such, and, as it were, in their own riglht, into the constitution of the universe. Firee-will may perhaps be best conceived as the power of giving or withholding decisive weight to or fromn any one among conflicting nmotives, as compared with one another by reflective perception; or more briefly expressed, as the power of obeying or disobeying the dictates of conscience. We are here con- cerned with real agencies, though we have only the terms of their attenidant consciousness, wherewith to lay hold of themii in thought. In obeyinig these dictates the will is good, in disobeying them bad; bad, because it is then in discord witlh the agenit's own knowledge. But in eitlher case it is free, so long as the power remains of doing either the one or the other. And it must be noted that, without reflective comparison of motives, that is, without conscieniee, there is no will, nothing which can be called conscious choice, notlhing but blind (thouggh possibly colnscious) action. Accordingly, the cerebral action which is attended by consciernce must be conceived as additional to, and inlcorporated with, that action which is attended by conscious- niess simply, so that its exercise becomes a constant factor or motive augency in volitions, a factor having as its function to perceive and compare other motives vith each other, and thereby, figuratively speaking, to hold the balance equably between them. Now, it is in the distinietion between these two inseparal-4es -I meanl the two functions of perceiving and deciding-that the freedomii of volitions consists. For suppose that, figuratively speaking, a miian is enslaved to a l)ad, or enslaved to a good, kind of miiotives, that is, to a bad or a good engrained habit alnd temiiper of mind, he m-nay still retain, and in normal cases does retaini, the power of dwellinga upon the fulnction of perceiving, and of thereby giving weight to its dictates, as itself a nmotive power, before finally deciding, in any particular</page><page sequence="19">TIME AND DESIGN IN NATURE. 65 act of choice, in favoiir of the motive (whether it be good or bad) which has the force of engrained habit behind it. What conscience then tells him is to deliberate before he chooses; and he can decide to deliberate or not to deliberate, before he decides between the other motives then in conflict. In sucb cases as are now supposed, deliberation is the exercise and realisation of his freedom of choice. If in such cases he decides not to deliberate, he gives away, for the present act, his freedom of choice; but he gives away only what he already has, and by his natural constitution cannot but have, namely, his freedom, and does so only by an exercise of that very freedom, the exercise of which for the time lie renounces. The act of refusing to deliberate is itself an act of choice, an act determined by the self-conscious agent, and recognised by him as his own. Thus what the agent does in the cerebral process of volition is to remould the material offered by the other cerebral pro- cesses, and then re-issue it in the shape of acts of choice, each stamped, as it were, like a coinage, with his own iinage and superscription. It is this remoulding and re-issuing, not the whole act, including what I have called the offered maaterial, which is in a special and distinctive sense the agent's own act, in every volition; a sense special and distinctive, because the act expresses what the agent is, not what he has or kilows, and is an act the consequences of which, so far as they affect himself, be they good or bad, he knows and feels to be deserved and just. But as every act of remoulding and re-issuing thus contributes its quota to modify, in one direction or another7 the agent's nature and the material offered to subsequent reactions, it is plain, not only that their cumulative effect must be very great, but that the consequences exclusively due to them must very soon exceed the power of the most searching self-examination to discriminate. Yet it is as impossible to conceive a self-conscious agent devoid of this remoulding and re-issuing power, as it is to E</page><page sequence="20">66 SHADWORTH H. HODGSON. conceive any, even the least, particle of matter devoid of physical motion or tendency to motion-that is, of what is called force or energy. And it is just this remouldina and re-issuing power that is meant, or ought to be meant, when we speak of free-will-that is, of free action in volition. With those dognmatists who refuse to attach any other meanina to freedom but one which includes the idea of a creation of acts ex nihilo, acts which are therefore not subject to the law of uniformity, it is of course useless to argue in support of a rationally intelligible freedom in volition-freedom in the same sense which it bears when applied to the relations between man and man, and between individuals and the community. It only now remains for me to speak of the two last topics named in the title of this paper-Final Cause, and Design in Nature. And first of Final Cause. My way is smoothed by what I have already said. You probably anticipate my next remark: it is, that Final Cause, like Freedom, is the object thought of by a common-sense conception or idea, which can be profitably dealt with only by subjective analysis-that is to say, in respect of which it is for the subjective analysis of our conception of it, and not for dialectic, to decide whether or not the supposed object of that conception can be admitted, as an ultimate, indecomposable, and essential factor, into the con- stitution of the universe. The mere statement of the question seems to invite us at onice to have recourse to Dialectic. It all depends, we seem to say to ourselves, on what we mean by Final Cause; and then we fly to some definition or other which seems to us most likely to harmonise with our prepossessions, whatever they may be. But let us for once try the other, the analytical, method. Final Causation, as we positively know it in ordinary experience, is a very complex affair. It is found only in conscious agrents. It is the only kind of causation into which, as ordinarily conceived, consciousness enters as an essential ingredient. It requires an anticipation in a present idea of some end to be</page><page sequence="21">TIME AND DESIGN IN NATURE. 67 attained in the near or remote future, and this anticipatory idea in some way contains the motor power, or becomes the motive, of the action it is said to cause, by acting upon the conscious agent who both entertains the idea, and performs the .action in consequence of it. Thus the conscious agent contains in himself both the cause of his action and the action said to be caused by it. That is to say, he is or contains both the efficient and the final cause of the action, in what is known as final causation; and both of these are really efficient-the motive in acting on the conscious agent, and the conscious agent in responding by an act of his own. Final Causation is thus a special and complex mode or kind of efficient causation, the mode in which anticipatory consciousness appears to come in as efficient agency, the anticipated end being also the motive of the action, its ap%X7 KtVf7Tv. In no other of the four kinds or heads of causation signalised by Aristotle is this necessarily the case; neither the formal, Inor the material, nor the efficient cause (which is acpXq' KcLVl?e(0 simply), but the final cause only, appears to require, as an essential feature, that consciousness should be involved in it; according to the well-known dictunm, Causa finalis movet, non secundumn suumn esse, sed secundunm suum esse cognituTa; or, in other words, that it is not the end, but our idea of the end, which determines our voluntary action. Volition in its lowest terms is presupposed by final causation, and a fortiori by action from design. All volition is selective or preferential, but the alternative courses need not be more than felt as different, and compared as felt with one another; no idea or conception of an end to be attained by adopting either of them is of neces- sity involved. When the idea of an end to be attained becomes the motive of voluntary action, and to the extent that it does so, that action becomes designed or purposive, as governed by an anticipation of its effect, and the part appa- rently played in it by consciousness becomes still more conspicuous. E2</page><page sequence="22">68 SHADWORTH H. HODGSON. Consider for a moment how important is the difference thus established, and what important consequences would follow, if final causation could be admitted as a single, ultimate, and unanalysable mode of causation, and in that character explanatory, within its own sphere, of phenomena generally. I say within its own sphere, because, so far as we have gone at present, it stands in conjunction with the three other heads of causation-the formal, the material, and the efficient; but it would soon be found to encroach upon and include first the efficient, and then even the formal and the material, as sub- ordinate modes of itself, owing to its really concretive and complex character being assumed as single, ultimate, and in- decomposable. It is niot, however, to these consequences that I wish now to call attention. The essential difference (from which these consequences would follow) consists in this, that while causes belonging to the tlhree other heads answer respec- tively the questions What? mnd How comes? a final cause alone answers, or professes to answer, and to answer at one stroke, the question Why? as well as the question How comes ? It professes to give the reason or rationality of an action, as well as its de facto or efficient causation, thus making ideas into efficient causes. It professes to satisfy the demands of what is called the Practical Reason, as well as of what is called the Speculative Reason, or, in other words, the demands of thought directed to ascertain the Good and the Preferable in -all its kinds, as well as of thought directed to ascertain the True in point of fact only. It is to Kant that wve owe the full establishment of the fundamental distinction between the Practical and the Speculative Reason, though with him it is. still entangled in the meshes of his peculiar ontological theory. Now, as already said, there is no doubt whatever that, as a concrete empirical phenomenon, an object of common-sense ideas, and described by common-sense terms, final causation, or conscious action for purposes or from motives, is a fact of everyday experience, familiar to every one, every day and all</page><page sequence="23">TIME AND DESIGN IN NATURE. 69 day long. The question is, how in philosophy we are to deal with this empirical fact. It is here that opinions and methods diverge. The crucial point is, where in the concrete phenomenon are we to place, to what constituent of it are we to attribute, the efficient causation, the agency concerned in it? There are, I think, but three main directions in which an answer has been and is still being sought, which it must suffice here to enumerate and very briefly characterise: 1. The first, handed down from immemorial antiquity, takes the concrete phenomenon, of acting from motives in the human conscious being, simply as it stands, and assumes, by hypothesis, an immaterial agent or agency, called a Soul, Mind, or Ego, to account for it, as the seat at once of consciousness and of conscious action. But it must be noted, that those who hold this hypothesis have no knowledge whatever of their supposed immaterial agent or agenicy, other than or beyond what is contained in their actual experience of the concrete phenomenon to be accounted for. It cannot be said to contribute anything whatever towards its explanation, but is simply a statement that the phenomenon is self-explanatory. Anld the same is true of particular faculties of the supposed immiaterial agent, each in its own department, such as the Will, the Intellect, the Imagination. 2. The second direction, which is that taken by strict Idealists, noticing the total absence of knowledge of any immaterial agent or agency per se, attributes the agency to the states or process-contents of consciousness itself. That is, they assign to consciousness alone, apart from any other agent, either material or iiiimaterial, the task of producing the appearance, or rather of throwing itself into the form, of what, in common-sense thinking, we know as the real world of mind and matter, of persons and things, and of the laws of nature by which, in common-sense thought, that world seems to be governed. But I think it must be said, that no success has hitherto attended any attempt to show how this</page><page sequence="24">70 SHADWORTH H. HODGSON. transformation is possible, or by what laws of pure unlsupported consciousness it can even be imagined to take place. 3. The third direction is that adopted by those (to whom, but with some important particularities of miiy own, I count myself to belong), who have recourse to physiological psychology for an explanation, taking the existence of a real world of organic and inorganic material existents, with their laws, as already proved. On this basis, and starting fronm what, on this basis, is a familiar and constantly observed fact, that sensations occur only in consequence of the stimulation of some part of the neuro-cerebral system by physical agencies, whether internal or external to the body, and taking account of the highly complex structure of the brain, and the connection of its parts with one another, and with nerves subserving outgoing action, it is (they hold) obvious and reasonable to suppose, that the whole course of redintegration or association of states or process-contents of consciousness, down to their minutest changes, and including those which constitute what are called volitions, or acts of conscious choice, is similarly dependent- that is to say, that its phenomena, one and all, occur only in consequence of somne stimulation or change of stimiulation in some part or parts of the cerebral organism. Eveln the well- known " click of resolve" in volitions, as Professor William James calls it, is probably dependent upon some corresponding " click," or sudden change, having taken place in the under- lying cerebral process; so that the causal efficacy, which is apparently due to an idea or desire acting upon the Ego, or upon other of his ideas or desires, is in reality due, not to that idea or desire, as a state or process-content of consciousness, but to the cerebral process underlying it, in conjunction and interaction with other cerebral processes. The whole mechanism or machinery (so to call it), or organised operation of the efficienlt agency, concerned in the consciousness of conscious beilngs, is thus attributed by this hypothesis to the working, of the living cerebral and neuro-cerebral</page><page sequence="25">TIME AND DESIGN IN NATURE. 71 system, and is supposed to go on below the threshold of con- sciousness that is to say, to support no consciousness of itself as a physical or physiological action; or again, in other words, to be a pbysical activity in living neural tissue, supporting a consciousness in which lno consciousness of itself as such an activity is included: a circumstance which is entirely in accordance with the fact, that in no case, not even in that of conscious and reflective choice, have we any inmmediate know- ledge of the precise How of the process. What is called Self- consciousness, or the supposed immediate perception of the Ego by itself, lies within the consciousness which is conditioned upon the cerebral process, and therefore the Ego, its supposed Subject-Object, must be held to do so too. There is no immediate knowledge of the Ego's agency. When, in ordinary language, we say that uwe feel, we think, we remember, we choose, we determine, we act, and so on; when we say that our actions originate in, and are guided by, moral or mental ideas and motives; we are speaking solely from the experience which is immediately present in consciousness, though erroneously including, in the experience the real agency supporting it, which is not immediately present in the consciousness. It is our very unconsciousness of the real agency which enables us to make this nmistake-that is, to imagine that we have an immediate knowledge of the agent and his action. Anid here I may say that I cordially welcome Mr. Wildon Carr's agree- ment with me on the cardinal point (to use the words which he uses), that "activity or agency is an object of knowledge not found in the nature of knowledge itself by analysis," notwithstanding that his argument rests, as he says, " entirely on a dialectical difficulty in the conception." For how, I would ask, cani the correctness or incorrectness of any colnception be ascertained otherwise than by analysis of it, in the last resort ? See Mr. Carr's paper, " The Theory of Subjective Activity," in the Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Vol. I, New Series, 1.900-1901, pp. 198-199.</page><page sequence="26">72 SIIADWORTH H. HODGSON. This third hypothesis must, I think, be admitted to supply defintite grounds for coping with the complexities of the phenomenon known as final causation, or the purposive activity of conscious beings, which is the form in which that phenomenon appears in ordinary experience; and farther, that it contrasts most favourably in this respect with the two other modes of approaching, the problem which that phenomenon presents. Apart, however, from the great difficulties which lie in the way of its satisfactory applicationl, difficulties which arise from the imperfection of our physiological knowledge of brain organisation and operation, and from the impossibility of any immediate self-observation of the concomitance or sequence in detail between brain changes and changes in consciousness apart, I say, from these great difficulties in working out this hypothesis, there is always to be reckoned against it the primary difficulty which lies at the root of all physiological psychology, of which it is a branch. I mean the difficulty which we feel in dispensing with the necessity for discovering some special rexius-i.e., some force or energy defined and governed by a law of its own, between phenomena so disparate in kind as Matter and Consciousness, before adopting the hypothesis that either of themii is dependent on the other, in any real sense of depen- dence. We are inot easily satisfied with the simple fact of time and space relations between them, relations of mere co-existence and sequence according to some law or laws of those relations; althouigh in no case of real dependence, of whatever kind it may be, is anything iiore really known to us, than these relations and their law. Mr. Benecke, for instance, in his highly interesting paper, '"On the Aspect Theory of the Relation of Mind to Body" (Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Vol. I, New Series, 1900-1901, pp. 24-25), in arguing against my view of the case, writes:-" However it be put, the relation of the psychic to the phvsical series appears to me on this view to involve an action without reaction, or an effect in excess of the cause, and</page><page sequence="27">TIME AND DESIGN IN NATURE. 73 how can we harmonise this with the rest of our knowledge ? " And to the word cause in this sentence he appends a footnote:- "'By the Principle of the Conservation of Energy the material effects equal the material cause. The psychical effect would, therefore, according to this view, have to be regarded either as an additional uncompensated effect of the same cause, or as being really produced without a cause." By " the rest of our knowledge," Mr. Benecke seems, then, to mean the laws governina physical phenomena, the action and reaction of matter on matter, at the head of which stands the law of the Conservation of Energy. It is true that physical energies are subject to this law; but then no such law as this can be assumed, or even expected, to hold good between two such disparates, or, as Mr. Benecke calls them (p. 26), "inconi- mensurables," as material energies and modes of consciousness. To do so would be, in thought, to materialise consciousness, by conceiving it subject to a law which is strictly applicable to matter only, a result wlich, I think, Mr. Benecke's own theory, the Aspect Theory, as he calls it, would fail to avoid. I also think that Mr. Benecke, in his argument agrainst what he supposes to be my view, too much, and indeed wholly, disregards the particular conception of Real Condition, as a substitute for that of Efficient Cause, which is set forth in that work of mine to which he explicitly refers, The Metaphysic of Exerience, and which I have again set forth in a paper, enititled "The Conceptions of Cause and Real Condition," read before the Congres International de Phtilosophic, at Paris, in August, 1900, a paper which will also be found in the Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Vol. I, New Series, havinlg been read before this Society at the meeting next followiDng that at which Mr. Benecke's paper was read. To that paper of mine, and to the definition there given (p. 54) of a Real Condition, as "something oni the existence or con- tilnuance of which, in given circumstances, sometlhing else comes into or continues in existence, and without which it</page><page sequence="28">74 SHADWORTH H. HODGSON. would not do so; "-as also to two other papers of mine following up the same line of thought, one " On t.he Substance- Attribute Conception in Philosophy," the other on " The Conscious Being," and both contained in the same volume of our Proceedings as the formrer, the present brief reference must here suffice. In psychology as well as in philosophy, since both alike deal with consciousness in relation to matter, a larger, less restricted, conception of what used to be called Efficient Causation seems to be required, than one drawn from the consideration, and adapted to the explanation, of physical phenomena alone. I hope I may be pardoned for this somiiewhat lengthy digression, in elucidation of the third direction taken by some in endeavouring to account for the familiar pheniomenon of conscious action for a purpose, or Final Causation. But now to return. The result of the foregoing analysis of that phenomenon, and of the enquiry into the three main directions talken by different schools of thought in explanation of it, is plainly this: that Final Causation cannot be regarded as an ultimate, indecomposable, and essential factor in the constitu- tion of the universe, or as contributino anything, in that character, to our speculative knowledge of it. In that character its explanatory power is gone, so soon as it is, shown to stand itself in need of explanation. And its explana- tion must be sought elsewhere than in a mere repetition of the explicandum on a larger scale. The positively known region of the universe, it is true, exhibits everywhere miiarks of what is called Design, Purpose, Adaptation of parts to parts, and of means to ends,-characters similar to those exhibited in the works of positively known conscious agents; but these con- scious agents are themselves parts of the universe, and the nature of their purposive anid conscious actions must be explained, if at all, from that of other parts of the universe, and cannot be erected into an explanationi of the universe itself in its totality. In other words, it is lno speculative</page><page sequence="29">TIME AND DESIGN IN NATURE. 75 explanation of the universe to attribute the marks of design, which are everywhere found in this world of ours, which is the material corner of it, to an almighty Designer and Creator of it. It would, or at least it might, be otherwise, if Final Causation were known to us as an ultimate, inidecomposable, and essential factor or element in the constitution of ouir positive knowledge of the universe, as, for instaince, are time and spatial extension, which are the formal elements of empirical experience; the ultimate qualities of feeling (sensation and emotion), which are its material elements; and those few ultimate kinds of difference and sameness found in empirical objects-namely, change, motion, and figure-which are the foundation of arithmetic and geometry; empirical objects being objects which consist in the union of a formal and a material element. Factors or elements of these three kinds-the formal, the material, and the mathematical-must at aniy rate enter into any speculative conception which we form of the universe, being positively known to us as essential constituents of every conception which we can frame of concrete or empirical objects. But, as I have tried to show, it is not so with what I may call pure final causality. This is neither representable in thought as a single though abstract element in the actions of conscious beings, nor is it a necessary ingredient, disclosed by analysis,. in the composition of those actions. The cerebral processes underlying anticipation and judament are sufficient to account for the activity underlying acts of choice or volitions; btLt then these cerebral processes are tlhemselves highly complex explicanda. At the same time this analysis fully justifies us in regarding the conscious purposive actions of conscious beings as a dis- tinctly marked class of actions, taken, of course, as they are taken in ordinary thought, and including the sense of freedom anid responsibility which in many cases attaches to them. Actions belonging to this latter group-namnely, free or</page><page sequence="30">76 SHADWORTH H. HODGSON. self-determined acts of conscious choice-are, in fact, the highest and noblest part of our nature as human beings; they constitute our Personality; they are the core of our moral Character; and they include Hope of a better future, as one of the essential characteristics of our being. In this last characteristic, Hope, lies their special value and significance, as connecting us with the positively unknown region or regions of the universe, of which we know nothing positively, save only their existence, and of which even these actions tell us nothing speculatively. They are actions belonging -to what is called the Practical, as distinguished from the Speculative, Reason. But hope, being practical, is not limited by positive knowledge; it extends as far as thought can reach even in its highest abstractions, and farther than the grasp of any concrete fancy or imagination. Its range is infinite and eternal, as is the universe itself. To trust it, when the actions in which is embodied are in fact guided and approved by Conscience, is to have faith in God. But it will be said, Do we not, and must we not, think- of God Himself as a Person, and is not this to think of Him as -a finite part and product of the universe, just like ourselves ? How, then, can hope and faith in the infinite and eternal be hope ,and faith in God ? Taking the latter question first, the answer is, that this would be impossible, if we had a positive and speculative knowledge of God as a person, a knowledge such as we have of ourselves as persons. But this is not the case; we have no such knowledge of God as this. And here the first question, as that on which the latter is founded, must receive its answer, which is as follows:-The thought of Personality which at its best, that is, when including such actions only as are prompted by the highest and noblest emotions, and are guided by the sense of moral rightness, is the highest and best reality that is known to us,-this thought we take as our true though inadequate representation and expression for the thought of what is the highest and best and mightiest reality in the</page><page sequence="31">TIME AND DESIGN IN NATURE. 77 infinite and eternal universe. This is our anthropomorphic way of giving definiteness to our hope and faith in the eternal and infinite Power, which sustains, pervades, and governs the universe. Words lke faith, trust, confidence, imply the reality of a power, on which the feelings expressed by them depend, in which they are reposed, towards which they are felt. They imply more than hope in this respect, though hope is their necessary foundation. We are therefore impelled to take this way of thinking by our emotional and moral, quite as much as (to say the least) by our intellectual nature. Our highest and best emotiolns are not only felt towards Persons, but are those, among the personal emotions, which are only satisfied by a return of the same emotion, or one belonging to the same specific kind, on the part of the object of it, and neither demand nor are capable of any other satisfaction; whereas the malevolent personal emotions-such, for instance, as hatred and anger-are satisfied only by the suffering or humiliation of their object. Emiiotions of the former kind i-mply and promote harmony without dis- cord, those of the latter discord without harmolny. It is olnly towards a beneficent personal power that we can feel gratitude, only in a beneficent personal power that we can repose trust. And in so feeling and thinking we are obeying a commoll and imperative need of human nature, felt as much by those who attempt its philosophical analysis, as by those who adopt the common-sense conception of the divine personality as the object of an immediate intuition, or innate idea, of an absolute reality, just as they take all other realities of commoln-senise thought as absolute. Analysing, or attempting to analyse, the way really taken is not to abolish the need for takingc it, any more than analysing the way in which we infer the reality of the material world is to abolish the truth of that inference- that is, the reality of Matter, which common-sense also takes as an absolute datum. Religion is rooted in the nature of man, and not in the results of philosophical analysis or speculation.</page><page sequence="32">78 SHADWORTH H. HODGSON. Hence the universality of the appeal which it makes to learned and unlearned alike. Moreover, analysts must think and speak in common-sense ideas and lancguage, in religious as in all other practical matters, taking their consciousness and its real conditioning together, without distinguishing between them; since terms of consciousness are the only means we havs of designating the particular processes of real conditioning, corresponding to them each to each, there being no possibility of discriminating those particular processes of real conditioning taken alone. In religious thinking every one must think in cornmon-sense (not analytical) ideas and conceptions. In saying this I am not overlooking the difference between these two realities, Matter and that which we represent by our conception of the divine personality, which are similar only in point of the absolute character attributed to both by common- sense thought. They differ profoundly, in that the former, Matter, is an object of positive kncwledge, the latter of faith, where positive knowledge is impossible. That is to say, although the fact of the real existence of the divine nature, as our object thought of, is represented in our thought of it, which is its subjective aspect, yet we have no positive know- ledge of that nature as a real existenit, as we have of the nature of Matter as a real existent, which latter knowledge takes the form of the various positive physical and physiological sciences. Human knowledge (as distinguished firom faith) of the divine nature and its real existence-that is to say, Theology-is therefore restricted to take the form of a psychological and philosophical knowledge of our own conception or idea of them. Thus the very conception by which we represent the reality of the divine nature includes the thought, that its real object thought of transcends all possible human knowledge. And this conception is therefore confessedly inadequate, though it is also true, or a true conception, in the sense that the personality, which is its definite content, is included as essentially belonging to, taken up into, and involved in, as</page><page sequence="33">TIME AND DESIGN IN NATURE. 79 well as transcended by, the reality which it is ani endeavour to conceive. We cani think, and, what is more, we cannot help thinkina, of recions of reality beyond the grasp of our positive anthropomorphic thought. But even to these regions hope and faith extend; they extend beyond the reach of positive specu- lative thought; they extend to what we can only describe, either by negatives, such as infinite, unconditioned, or by self- repetitions, such as eternal; it is upon hope and faith that all religions worthy of the name are foulnded. To these Christianity adds Charity, or Love in its highest sense, as its own distinctive characteristic, and as an essential element in its foundation. It is in his love to God that the huluan being's sense of his union with God resides; but it is love conceived as originating in the Almighty towards all men, and demiiandlinc love, worship, and obedience from every man in retuirni. That God is Love, is the Revelation of Jesus Christ. Andl accordingly, so far as he speculates at all uipon the history and course of Nature, the Christian's positive belief must be, that the power or energy which, in man, underlies and miiaintains the mloral Law of Love is continuous anad identical with the one (and only one) almighty and ever- lasting power or energy, which underlies and maintains the infinite anid eternal uiniverse, and inlto subjection to which all things, seen and unseen, will finially be brought.</page></plain_text>
