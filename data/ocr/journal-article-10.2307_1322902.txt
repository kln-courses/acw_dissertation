<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE LAW OF CORPORATIONS (being the Yorke Prize Essay for the year 1902). By C. T. Carr. Cambridge: At the University Press. 1905. Pp. Xiii, 211. 8vo. Following a suggestion of Professor Maitland, of an English Encyclopedia of Group-life, a work which should range over the field occupied by the vari- ous forms of English fellowship and association, the writer of this essay has attempted to deal " with one single form of group-life, namely, the class of bodies which, in the strict legal sense, are ' corporations.'" The general object of the book, as the author states, is " to show the nature and attributes of a corpora- tion, the steps by which it reached its present legal form and importance, and the manner' in which it has from time to time been treated by the state. The later chapters contain the more ambitious effort of analyzing the theory of corporations." Starting out to fulfill such a suggestion as that of Professor Maitland, it nat- urally follows that the work, well executed, as it undoubtedly is, should be in- teresting and suggestive to the student of the history of English law, and of the development of its theories. But it should be noted that chapters entitled " Anthropomorphism," " Concession," " Registration," " Symbolism," "i Real- ism," and some others, though suggestive to the student, will not attract many readers outside that class. In justice to the author, however, it slhould 'be re- membered that this book is not published " to sell "; but, like many other books, more often, we may regret to find, written by Englishmen rather than Ameri- cans, it was done because the author had found something that was worth say- ing, and has been willing to put time and effort into it, for the sake of the few who will understand and be aided.</page><page sequence="2">BOOKS AND PERIODICALS. 87 In an interesting chapter on the " corporation sole," Mr. Carr points out that this invention, " so proudlv described by Blackstone, had turned out a failure. . . . It is the supreme test of the true corporation that its abstract personality should be independent of that of the sum of its members. The corporation sole cannot pass this test." Thus the fee simple is not vested in the abstract entity, but is declared to be in abeyance when the parson of a church dies; the corporation sole and its sole corporator are not regarded as two separate bodies in their dealings with one another; nor are there any instances in which a sole corporation has been sued by its sole corporator. "It is a fiction, but not fictitious enough for this." 'Ihe limits of this review forbid making many selections from Mr. Carr's book, but attention should be given to the excellent chapter, "1 The Corporation in the Courts." In this chapter, the author shows how by means of the doctrine of ultra vires results are reached which would not be reached at common law nor in equity ; and in the section, " The Liability of a Corporation apart from Con- tracts," he demonstrates, after a careful collection of successive decisions, that an ultra vires act, though void, is none the less a corporate act; and he shows how gradually the principle of corporate liability has been extended to include ''sins of commission." To those who have not studied corporation law Mr. Carr's book would not be easy reading; but to those who have, it would repay the time that would be given it. S. H. E. F.</page></plain_text>
