<plain_text><page sequence="1">PETER EISENMAN: MOVING ARROWS, EROSAND OTHER ERRORS 20 February - 22 March 1986 Site unscene ? Notes on architecture and the concept of fiction Tact occupies itself with trying to reproduce fiction.' Oscar Wilde, The Decay of Lying, 18911 The Romeo and Juliet project by Peter Eisenman is a series of site scalings and formal registrations ? mere marks in the existing cityscape ? which muse in self-reflexive ways upon the complex themes of union, division, and relation in the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet. The architectural project, which could, if desired, be built, is a kind of literary earth and-stone work: a physical fiction, as it were. The project receives its intellectual impetus, as have all of Eisenman's recent architectural investi? gations and designs, from a determined altercation with the dogma of classical ordination and tra? ditional figurative presence. Eisenman is trying to expose the narrow and reductive ways in which the world is made known to us through architecture, arguing that more complex and less literal forms of architectural representation should be made mani? fest within the culture.2 Classical ordination, Eisenman argues, based as it is on a crippling anthropocentrism, is an architectural doctrine which would, in its naive form, assimilate the built world into one giant reductive coherence, robbing it of the possibility of competing interpretations, claims, and even of differing ways of being.3 Eisen? man explicitly conceives of his work as an anti? thesis to such a classical desire. He wants to debunk the false assumption that architecture must be anthropocentric, especially in its more traditional forms of a codified anthropomorphism. Eisen? man's architecture is interesting and challenging precisely because it attacks traditional modes of anthropocentric representation as its core inspir ation, yet still struggles towards an architectural reality. He is prepared to build buildings. Eisenman considers his work as an attempt to move beyond the purely formalist projects of negation in art.4 At the same time he is trying to avoid falling back into traditional or less critical ways of thinking.5 By framing the discussion of architecture as a struggle against the dead weight of tradition, yet continuing to push towards a new mode of reality (that is, an untraditional one), Eisenman opens the jaws of several oppositions which have plagued recent discussions of modern art and philosophy ? oppositions between the concrete and the abstract, between the figurative and the formal, between the real and the fictional, and so on.6 The intention of this essay is to explore these tensions: between the positive view of architecture as a reality, a thing to be made, put in place and experienced, and the negative, critical or sceptical views of architectural thought, the exposure of a fixed and reduced setting. The essay explores this double aspect of a struggle in architecture: first as a posit or an assertion of a structure for experience and then, following immediately on the heels of its positive mood, a sceptical doubt about its own efficacy.7 The introduction of the concept of 'fiction' into architecture is intriguing for the arguments con? cerning the ambivalence of architectural represent? ation. Because the Romeo and Juliet scheme is itself a proposal to build a fiction, the project involves itself in an inescapably self-conscious way in all the oppositions of architectural representation which Eisenman has written about in recent articles.8 There is a significant difference between writing about defusing the opposition between fiction and reality and actually confronting the issue in archi? tectural projects. In proposing an architectural scheme which is the building of a fiction, Eisenman faces one of the most difficult paradoxes in modern art today ? the simultaneous exhaustion of the practices of negation with the acknowledgement of the impos? sibility of a closed logic for understanding our actions.9 Architecture has always been a special case in modernism as a cultural movement, and this for many reasons, but chief among them is that the practice of negation poses a very special problem for the art of architecture, which is involved in the construction of reality in a more direct and con? crete way than any of the other arts. This con? structive aspect of architecture raises serious questions concerning the positive nature of inten tionality, and these questions must be brought to bear on practices of negation.10 The value of the Romeo and Juliet scheme is that it breaks new ground in pushing beyond the worn out and mysti? fying cant of the practices of negation in art. More specifically, it explores 'positive' techniques con? cerning the construction of symbolic meaning against the more usual and certainly more accepted 'negative' theories of artistic production.11 But, in focusing on the problems of architectural symbol? ism in a more positive way, Eisenman has opened up new intellectual problems for himself. The Romeo and Juliet project therefore represents a new beginning for Eisenman, the generation of ideas which are only now being fully explored in projects such as the Tokyo Opera House compe? tition and the Long Beach project for an art museum. 1.1 have amended the quotation very slightly. 2. See, for example, the arguments put forward in: Peter Eisenman, 'The Futility of Objects: Decomposition and the Process of Difference', Harvard Architecture Review 3 (winter 1984), pp. 64-81. 3. There is an assumption in this essay that the spatial and physical formations of a society may in undesir? able material constitutions play a significant role in the determination of the modes of being of its indi? viduals. This is a much discredited view nowadays. To be accused, in academic discourse, of 'spatial deter? minism' or 'determinate materialism' is to be im? pugned. These are clearly the over-stretched explan? ations of architecture to which Eisenman is reacting, expressing a view against the overdetermination of the individual. Later in the essay I shall express views which counter the position Eisenman takes in reaction to determinism, a position which does not seem to acknowledge the fact that individuals, like worlds, are made, not found. But I do not wish to sanction the determinist positions which Eisenman correctly rejects. Rather, I am searching for more contingent and possibly more dialectical formu? lations of the problem of personal identity and the human environment which escape naive and deter? minate arguments. For a fuller discussion of these issues, see: John Whiteman, 'Architecture and Per sonhood' (Harvard University Graduate School of Design Mimeo, 1985). 4. That the practices of modern art are essentially prac? tices of negation is a thesis eloquently advanced by T. J. Clark in his essay 'Clement Greenberg's Theory of Art'. For a refutation to this claim, see Michael Fried's essay 'How Modernism Works: A Response to T. J. Clark'. Both essays are printed in Pollack and After: The Critical Debate, edited by Francis Frascina (New York, 1985). 5. Eisenman explains his position in relation to the myriad thoughts and schools that breed from the con? cept of negation in an interview dated 18 April 1986 and conducted by Antonio Sanmartin, to be pub? lished in the Spanish magazine Saber. He states that his work is an attempt to move beyond the purely formalist projects of negation. The claim that Eisen? man is the only architect with such an intention is a little strong. Certain aspects of Frank Gehry's work could also be considered in this light, and clearly Daniel Libeskind is driven by similar impulses, al? though he believes building is no longer possible ? see, for example, his argument in 'Peter Eisenman and the Myth of Futility', Harvard Architecture Review 3 (winter 1984), pp. 61-3. 6. Some of the ideas here are reminiscent of T. S. Eliot's essay 'Tradition and Individual Talent', in The Col? lected Prose of T. S. Eliot, edited by Frank Kermode (New York, 1975). Many of these themes are explored more fully in a collection of essays on the philosophy of art. Charles Harrison and Fred Orton, editors, Modernism, Criticism, Realism: Alternative Contexts for Art (New York, 1984). 7. Professor Henry Cobb has often asserted that archi? tecture is best when it recognizes that it is inescapably caught in certain dualities and problems which are of its own making. This aspect of architecture, that it is not a problem to be solved but a condition to be lived in or worked through, intrigues me here. 8. See, for example, the arguments put forward in: Peter Eisenman, 'The End of the Classical', Perspecta 21 (Cambridge, 1984), pp. 154-73, an&lt;^ 'The Futility of Objects', ibid. 9. It is becoming more and more obvious that practices of negation are losing their critical edge, and that they are serving as a very thin ideological veneer for the creation and protection of a certain class ? the secure but disaffected bourgeoisie. I would say that this is true of both artists and their critics. Instead of pushing the limits of culture, as Marx hoped, the practices of negation have essentially acted to stabilize the pos? ition of the bourgeoisie, and could even be said to be hindering social progress. What is needed now is a more positive critical theory of art. See, for example, the prospective desires and arguments put forward by Michael Fried in 'How Modernism Works', ibid. 10. Jacques Derrida argues that architectural thinking meets this paradox, because architecture is always 'presencing', as he puts it. Interview with Jacques Derrida by Eva Meier, Domus, 24 April 1986, pp. 37~43' 11. The word 'negation' has long since lost any precise meaning in discussions about art. It is usually used as a tag attaching an artist to some vague sense of modern? ism. Of course the word has more precise, even if still difficult, meanings in philosophy (cf. Nietzsche and more recently Jacques Derrida) and in psychology (cf. Jacques Lacan). j6 AA FILES 12</page><page sequence="2">Plates 10,11,12 ?the first superposition. MOVING ARROWS, EROSAND OTHER ERRORS Architecture traditionally has been related to human scale. Forfive centuries man 's bodily proportions have been a datum for architecture. While man is still the same physical size, he is no longer able to sustain the same centric position in his conception of himself and the universe. The grand abstraction of man as the measure of all things, as an originary condition, a whole presence, can no longer be sustained. For example, before Freud, man held that he knew himself to be entirely as he was present to himself, as hefelt himself to be. Yet, though Freud's exposition of the unconscious rendered this naive anthropocentric view forever untenable, its roots persist in the architecture oftoday. The issues of presence and origin are central to the question of anthropocentrism. In order to effect a response in architecture to this new circumstance ofman, this project proposes to employ an other discourse, one which attempts to eschew the anthropocentric organizing principles of presence and origin, for a discourse founded in a process called scaling. It is important to distinguish the process of scaling from that of architectural scale and its related notion of size. From this point of view, three different sizes of building types, say a house, a theatre, and a skyscraper, are the same scale, in that they are each simply mul? tiples ofthe size of a human being this implicitly gives the scale of the human body an originary value. In scaling there is no single privileged referent, and therefore no originary value. Instead, each scale change invokes characteristics specific and intrinsic to that scale. Scaling frees architecture from the metaphysics of scale. Scaling yields a new mode of architectural intervention which has the potential to destabilize the heretofore intransigent and now untenable centrisms ofthe metaphysics of architecture: first, the value that architecture gives to presence; and, second, the value that architecture gives to origin. In destabilizing presence and origin, the value that architecture gives to representation and the aesthetic object is also called into question. Scaling in this context proposes three destabilizing agents: discontinuity, which confronts the metaphysics of presence; recursivity, which confronts origin; and self-similarity, which confronts representation and the aesthetic object. The traditional geometries and processes in architecture are necessarily continuous because they are fundamentally geometries and processes of presence. A presence is a physically real form, whether a solid, such as a building or a void, such as space between two buildings. If architecture recognizes only presence, it will admit no discontinuity. Discontinuity is that aspect of scaling which disrupts AA FILES 12 77</page><page sequence="3">From Problems of Method to Problems of Meaning 'Une Systeme est une espece de damnation qui nous pousse a une abjuration perpetuelle: il en faut tou jours inventer un autre, et cette fatigue est un cruel ch?timent.' Charles Baudelaire12 'A great distinguishing property of the icon is that by the direct observation of it other truths con? cerning its object can be discovered than those which suffice to determine its own construction.' C. S. Pierce13 In the Romeo and Juliet scheme there is a double sense of technical precision and delicacy of mean? ing, which is new in Eisenman's work. The scheme is distinguished from its predecessors by the admis? sion that the problems of architecture cannot be subsumed under a single logic. Schemes such as the Ohio State project or the Berlin project are note? worthy for their quietude, their struggles to silence the murmurs of meaning. This is symptomatic of struggle to make the logic which produces a project coincide with the logic required to interpret it. The fact that the Romeo and Juliet scheme carries no such ambition for a singular logic is not merely a quality forced upon the architecture by the choice of subject matter, the unavoidable presence of the problem of fiction, but arises also out of a change in Eisenman's conception of architectural method. He is no longer interested in the notion of system? atic transformational logics in architecture which can operate without conscious reference to the symbolic effects of their product, that is, without consciously anticipating certain aspects of architec? tural meaning. Instead, as C. S. Pierce's remark on icons suggests, Eisenman has moved to a form of architectural thought in which the logic that deter? mines the syntactic construction of a design is not sufficient in and of itself to structure its interpret? ation. A consequence of following a thought like this is that thinking itself becomes complex and not singular. There is a logic of structure and a logic of iconicity, and, while the two are obviously con? nected, they are not joined in any systematic way that can be understood prior to making a design. In the following two sections, therefore, I will discuss both aspects of Eisenman's new symbolism ? the technique of architectural composition and the problems of meanings which are made thereby. The Romeo and Juliet scheme is the result of precise and (initially) discrete architectural judge merits, a result which is a complex form. There is a moment in the architectural method of the Romeo and Juliet project when a consciousness of aggre? gate effects is born and helps determine the pre? cision of what were previously seen as discrete, analytical judgements. It is important to note here that practices of negation have in general tended to deny any positive intention towards the control of aggregative and semantic effects in design, just as holistic and positive arguments have tended to ignore what could not be subsumed in the coher? ence of their single-sense logic. Instead, closed or singular logics in design have attempted to make the 'result fall out' from a set of automatic and rigorous precedures (this is what rationalism often amounts to). Denied in such procedures is any con? scious foresight of the 'effect' of the work, any use of this foreknowledge in design decisions. Also denied is any admission of the complexity and equivocation of the issues of signification. We are driven by a tendency in the modern con? ception of rationalism to examine the reasoning of our own procedures and to codify them. Eisenman does this with more intensity and with a greater degree of scrutiny than any other architect. But there is always the point of impossibility, the limits of our sense and capability, when the whole logic of our system seems to blow up in our faces. It is this condition, the margins of representation, that forces an unwelcome and perplexing difference in the logic that may be used to produce a work of art and the logic that may be used to accept or under? stand it. Eisenman is aware of this. The making of an architectural project, such as the Romeo and Juliet design, that deals with reality versus fiction in such a systematic way can hardly avoid the issue. The Romeo and Juliet scheme is therefore a project about the limits of architectural sense at the same time as it is a reality created from a fiction.14 There are those who would regard this set of concerns as a tiresome over-complication of archi? tectural logic. Can we not simply be practical about the matter, and get on with it? Can we not simply make buildings, and forget about the prob? lems of architectural representation and the sym? bolic and spiritual problems which such a concern raises? Obviously, the contention of Eisenman's architecture and of this essay is a resounding 'no'. It is precisely this desire for the obvious and the lit? eral, the claim that we already know what to do, which Eisenman exposes as a fallacy. His is an architecture that would strip away the false com? forts of such a position, exposing a silent violence behind the assumptions of ease.15 Discrimination and Allusion (Romeo and Juliet as Spatial Fiction) 'Architecture is always something which is either too big or else too small.' Le Corbusier The architectural device which is used in the design is that of scaling. 'Scaling' is a method by which certain properties of an object (its plan structure, say) are selected or isolated from their context and transposed to a different location and represented at a different scale in juxtaposition with things in its new context (which need not necessarily have been rescaled or moved). It is worth noting that any context is originally composed of arbitrary scalings and representations. In this scheme, Eisen? man is using scaling as a way of breaking our hab? itual spatial frames of reference by forcing us to confront images in juxtaposition ? images which have been scaled up or scaled down and then made present to us in their 'artificial' scale.16 Eisenman has written that scaling is not 'a measuring device which identifies any represent? ation in relation to a fixed and identifiable reality'.17 By the use of scaling Eisenman is seeking to avoid an architecture in which formal and structural relationships are set in a fixed and 'natural' hier? archy. Instead, he seeks formal relationships which may, through the mechanism of scaling, be nested within one another 'to produce an unending reflex? ive series of related images'. The need for a fixed and readily identifiable reality, a firm foundation of 'natural' order, would then be lost.18 The purpose of such a disruption is a construct? ive one. It is often the case that an act which is literally destructive may be metaphorically con? structive, forcing us to rethink our ideas of the literal. The presence, in the 'ordinary' scale, of something which is extraordinary in scale (too big or too small) reminds us that what we take as ordin? ary and natural in our lives has had to be construed and made habitual over time. One of the paradoxes of tradition, as Hegel points out, is that over time the products of artifice come to seem like natural phenomena. There is a process of forgetting in which we no longer regard things such as cities, morals, or money as artificial phenomena, made by human beings with human ends in mind. Instead, many of the conventions which actually construe our lives in important ways seem to acquire a logic and force of their own. They appear to be inde? pendent of our cultural desires, and in our self delusion we may feel powerless to change them.19 12. 'A system is a kind of damnation which drives us to perpetual abjuration. We are always forced to invent another, and this strain is a cruel punishment.' 13. Collected Papers 2 (Cambridge, Mass., 1932). 14. One cannot help noticing the similarity of the themes of limits which are involved in Wittgenstein's phil? osophy, both the early and the late work, though the similarity with the ideas of the Tractatus may seem stronger here. In his lecture at Harvard University (18 April 1986), Jacques Derrida referred extensively to this feeling of double direction in any sense-making. 15. This argument is made more fully in my essay on 'The Classical Representation of the Human Soul and its Denial', in the catalogue for the Eisenman exhib? ition at Harvard University (ibid.). 16. The technique has been explored in other media. See, for example, Woody Allen's The Purple Rose of Cairo, in which the depicted locations of screen and 'real' life are deliberately confused, thus confusing our habitual distinction between the real and the fictional. 17. See: Eisenman, 'Moving Arrows, Eros, and Other Errors', text accompanying the Romeo and Juliet project (hereafter referred to as 'Accompanying Text'), p. 2. 18. This provides an architectural equivalent to Nelson Goodman's undermining of the need for 'firm found? ations' in philosophy. See Nelson Goodman, Ways of Worldmaking (Cambridge, Mass., 1978), especially p. 6. 19. This observation also forms the basis of much of the social philosophy of Marx. The tendency to natur? alize human convention is beautifully described in Isaiah Berlin's biography of Karl Marx (Karl Marx (Oxford, 1939), especially chapters 4 and 5).

In scaling discontinuity differentiates absence from void. Absence is either the trace of a previous presence ? it contains memory ? or the trace of a possible presence ? it contains immanence. In its most reduced sense, recursivity is the elaboration of selfsame forms, for example a square divided into foursquares, divided into foursquares. Recursivity confronts origin only when it is in a condition of self similarity. Self similarity refers to analogic repetition and not to the geometric mimesis usually found in an aesthetic object. For example, the walls of Romeo 's castle will be seen to be self similar or analogous to the walls of the old city of Verona. When geometry is no longer the basis of understanding it is not possible to determine which figure camefirst, since both have aspects of origin and development from origin. It is this analogic dimension which frees scaling from a mechanical process. Rather than producing a transferral which preserves the aesthetic properties, as found in traditional representation, self similarity produces an unending transformation of properties. Rather than being an aesthetic object, the object becomes a tex* a structure of its own being Strictly speaking discontinuity, recursivity, and self-similarity are mutually dependent aspects of scaling. They confront presence, origin, and the aesthetic object in three aspects of the architectural discourse: site, programme, and representation. The first aspect which is confronted is the idea that site is a reality containing only presence. To privilege 'the site' as the context is to repress other possible contexts, is to becomefixated on the presences of'the site', is to believe that 'the site' exists as a permanent, knowable whole. Such a belief, as has been discussed, is untenable today. By treating 'the site'not simply as presence but as both a palimpsest and a quarry, containing traces of both memory and immanence, 'the site' can be thought of as non-static. Perhaps an analogy ofthe non-static' would he useful. Consider the difference between a moving arrow and a still arrow. One only has to put one's hand in front of both to discover quickly the existence of a profound difference. Yet, if a picture of each were taken and compared, they would be virtually indistinguishable. What distinguishes the moving arrow from the still one is that it contains where it has been and where it is going i.e., it has a memory and an immanence which are not present to the observer ofthe photograph; they are essential absences. Theories of'the site' as present origin presume that the moving arrow and the still arrow are the same; they ignore the subtle but profound conditions of the presence of these absences. The second aspect which is confronted is the idea that the programme in the architecture of the early twentieth century is a source of originary value. It was held that if the program was properly elaborated a AA FILES 12 79</page><page sequence="5">Disruption and dislocation, taken metaphorically, are therefore necessary in the construction of fresh meanings. In no realm of human life is such an observation more true than in our ritualization of space and time. It is troubling to imagine that the undeniable ground of one's existence might suddenly become deniable.20 The denial of the importance and arbi? trariness of convention in the establishment of human affairs is, as Lamb's remark suggests, the more common reaction. Yet the denial is not with? out perverse consequences, which can at times be sensed.21 Losing sight of the importance of the arbi? trary in human affairs allows things to become auto? matic. The fresh and constructive purposes with which conventions began are no longer recognized in their original form, and these forms may then be subject to blind ritual or open abuse by a power structure, or may simply become useless. And this unfortunate history of human form is, as Marx argued, mainly due to our unwillingness to recog? nize the effectiveness of our own conventions. Of course, one way in which we might be tempted to escape the problems involved in the logic of human convention is to deny them by aim? ing for an architecture of transcendence. Eisenman has clearly considered such thoughts as an answer to the problems raised in the working-out of an architectural method. 'Architecture is that which persists after the meaning is known', he writes. Or again: Architecture 'shelters but it is not about shelter. It [architecture] is useful, but it is not about use. ... It is meaningful, but it is not about meaning.'22 The idea of transcendence clearly has its appeal, but it is important to recognize that Eisenman is not arguing for a mystical form of transcendence. He is looking for a form of argu? ment that would lift architecture from false and narrow methods that would reduce human experi? ence.23 The problem with 'transcendence' as a notion is that it hides more than it shows, and when we use the word we find ourselves at the edge of our sense: this is where we have brought our? selves but as yet we have no new explanations. The Romeo and Juliet scheme is interesting pre? cisely because it achieves a positive advance regard? ing this question of the limits of architectural sense. By switching scales and by introducing fiction into real life through the device of scaling, Eisenman has achieved a series of juxtapositions which, if built, would serve as gentle reminders in a city scape that much of what is important in human affairs is made, not found, 'artificial' rather than 'natural'. What actually happens in scaling is very like what happens in symbolism. What does not hap? pen in scaling is an absolute reproduction of 'the same'.24 Any process of symbolization re-presents or re-produces a 'new' object in a different lo? cation, with certain properties kept 'the same' and others (location included) allowed to vary. In any case of similarity, therefore, there is also a problem of controlled difference. And it is across the delib? erate difference that reference is made through the vehicle of similarity. (One could also state the opposite, as Jacques Derrida has pointed out, that in simulation reference is made by the breaking open of a difference.)25 It is the choice and re composition of qualities, determined by both the material of the art (say, bricks or paint) and the meaning to be made, that becomes the substantive basis of meaning. Art is therefore largely a process of 'moving' or, better put, of translation. In translation, qualities of the same and of the different are both conceptually important. The designer is involved in the construction and man? ipulation of both senses, and these form the material basis of meaning, but he cannot know a priori what to do in strict instrumental terms. What happens in art is the remaking of one world into another, the translation of one set of struc? tured meanings or impressions from one medium into another. The process is, as Plato and Aristotle suspected, literally a 'trick', but it is a trick worth playing because it is our only access to the world.26 Scaling, as Eisenman uses it, achieves translation primarily by preserving certain qualities of an object across a change of location and of size. But the process is not automatic, not simply the enlargement or reduction of one thing which is then haphazardly juxtaposed against the 'real' world. There is precise judgement in the choice of location and scale and in the selection of the object qualities to be preserved. The judgement is con? trolled by watching carefully for the potential sig? nificance of the effects of juxtaposition. It is the achievement of desired meanings that serves to guide the precise selection and scale and location in the reproduction of one 'object' in another place. The designer, it seems, always has one eye on the significance of his actions, and allows this to deter? mine the design procedure. But it is important to note that the designer could not have known his decisions in advance of making them. No system of knowledge will guide him through the process in an automatic way. One of the virtues of the use of scaling in the Romeo and Juliet design is that it is aware of its own artificiality. Constantly arguing against the naturalistic arguments of hierarchy, origin and scale, which have dominated architectural think? ing 'for centuries', Eisenman uses a play on fiction to alert us to the fictional character of what we take to be 'real'.27 The project deliberately sets out to challenge three notions which we think distinguish the real from the fictional. The first is the fiction of narrative, a concept used to distinguish the passage of real time from mere story. Since architecture (except in certain Eastern traditions)28 finds it very hard to be self-conscious about time, especially human time (that is, history), an architectural project cannot directly involve itself in the man? ipulation of time and temporal sensation for art? istic purposes. Consequently, in order to comment on the structure of narrative, architecture is re? stricted to the manipulation and representation of the setting of a story and of the places and things which appear in it. In the Romeo and Juliet scheme the fiction of the narrative is therefore largely reconstructed through two other fictions, with which architecture is more able to deal: the fiction of the site and the fiction of representation. In proposing a scheme, which would, if built, become a 'real' site, Eisenman uses the pro? cess of scaling to put fiction on the ground. The original story of Romeo and Juliet, by Da Porto, was inspired by two towers in Montecchio but was set in Verona. The 'site' in the story is therefore fic? tional, not only because it is in a story, but also because it is ambiguous ? it refers to two real places. Eisenman's project reverses this process of abstraction and invention by proposing a real site which refers to its fictional counterpart. By using the technique of scaling to translate objects into a new location and image, the Romeo and Juliet scheme is able to use architecture, which is static, to refer to the unfolding of a story, which is 20. Charles Lamb once remarked that 'Nothing bothers me more than space and time: and yet, nothing bothers me less, as I never think about them.' Quoted in Peter S. Stevens, Patterns in Nature (Harmonds worth, 1974) 21. Which is why we have any 'history' at all (see: A. C. Danto, Narration and Knowledge (New York, 1985), pp. 17-26). 22.

Stanley Cavell argues that one of the main contri? butions of Emerson as a thinker is his constant aware? ness of the fallacy of binding ourselves into reduced descriptions of human experience. See: Cavell, 'Thinking of Emerson', New Literary History 11, 31, autumn 1979, pp. 11-35. 24. As John Locke points out (in the Essay on Human Understanding), this is literally impossible. His argument is as follows: for one thing to be 'the same' as another thing, it would have to be that thing ? which destroys the distinction between the two things, hence the basis for comparison. Goodman also makes similar arguments in his 'Seven Strictures on Similarity', ibid. 25. Cf. Jacques Derrida Harvard Lecture, ibid. 26. An access which, as Hilary Putnam points out, means that 'the world' perse can never be independent of the mind that construes it. See: 'Why There Isn't a Ready Made World', in Realism and Reason (Cambridge University Press, 1983). See also: Gombrich, Medi? tations on a Hobby Horse, or The Roots of Artistic Form (London, 1963). Putnam's attack on the naivety of sci entism revolves around the inability of such thinkers to be self-conscious about their own sense-making. Scientism is impugned as a very unselfconscious mode of knowledge, meaning that it is in many crucial and dangerous ways unaware of its 'side effects' (a paradigmatic case for Putnam is neo? classical economics). 27. A full description of three 'fictions' which this design deliberately sets out to challenge is given in the text which.accompanies the project (see: Accompanying Text, pp. 2-4). 28.1 am thinking of the deliberate use in Eastern architec? ture of materials that disintegrate over time and con? sequently have to be replaced. There is a deliberate celebration in the Eastern tradition of the imperma nence of life. In contrast, Western architecture is usually preoccupied with permanence (see, for example, the chapter on 'The Theory of Permanences' in: Aldo Rossi, The Architecture of the City (Cambridge, Mass., 1965)). 8o AA FILES 12</page><page sequence="6">Plates 2123y 24. ^ ^ ^ good architecture wouldfollow. The programmefor this project was to present the dominant recurring themes ofthe stories of Romeo and Juliet in an architectural form at the site of the two castles. One way to destabilize this programme was to undercut its 'reality3?in this case, to create a fiction of a fiction. Whereas previously the programme embodied the anthropocentric desirefor an ideal of human perfection, Romeo and Juliet is a programme oferos, an architecture which replaces the teleology of the ideal with the openness of text. Through superposition the project combines individual entities into what Freud calls, in his definition of eros, even larger unities; it is, as it were, an eros of an eros. There are three important versions of the story of Romeo and Juliet which were taken as the basis ofthe 'architecturalprogramme'. Each narrative is characterized by three structural relationships, each having its own physical analogue: division (the Separation of the lovers symbolized in physical form by the balcony of Juliet's house); union (the marriage of the lovers symbolized by the church); and their dialectical relationship (the togetherness and apartness ofthe lovers as symbolized in Juliet's tomb). The three structural relationships which pervade the narratives also can be found to exist at a physical level in the plan ofthe city of Verona: the car do and decumanus divide the city; the old Roman grid unites it; and theAdige river creates a dialectical condition of union and division between the two halves. Similarly, places in Verona can be located as key focuses in the narrative: supposedly existing in Verona today are Juliet's house (the point oftheir division); the church where the couple was married (the point oftheir union); and Juliet's tomb (the ultimate point of their dialectical relationship of togetherness and apartness). The strange presence of these fictional 'realities'in Verona sets the stage for this project's further transposition ofreality and fiction. The project brings back thefictional elements of Verona to the reality of Montecchio, creating a simultaneity of experience of text and object. These are presented in three axonometric drawings, and three scalings which are made by registering the three glasses in different superpositions. In each scaling there are present elements (in colour), elements of memory (in grey), and elements of immanence (in white). Thefirst superposition reveals the idea of division found in the three texts. When the walls of the castle of Romeo are superposed on the walls of the old city of Verona, the three elements of the site ofMontecchio (at the same scale as the city of Verona) fall in a divided relation to the walls ofthe real castle of Juliet; a simulated castle of Julietfalls inside the real castle of Juliet, a simulated church falls within the wall of the real castle, and a simulated castle of Romeo falls outside of the walls ofthe real castle of Juliet, hence the AA FILES 12 81</page><page sequence="7">Plates 25,26,27. idea of division. Thus thefirst scaling involves the transposition of place and superposition of scales in time to reveal aspects of the structure of the textual narrative. The castle (which is analogous to Romeo) attempts to unite a Verona divided between the Capuletti and the Montecchi. The A dige river which both joins andfractures the city of Verona also acts upon the castle of Romeo so that it becomes, in its left hand segment, a presence, and, in its right-hand segment, part memory?the absence of its former presence, and part trace ? the presence of an absence, an immanent castle. The castle of Romeo is thus a palimpsest and a quarry, where the stones which are removed from the actual walls of the castle form the grid ofthe city of Verona. The second superposition reveals the idea ofunion found in the three texts. Here the castle of Juliet, which appeared as a passive trace in the actual castle of R omeo, now appears as an active trace at the actual church of Montecchio. The tower of he castle surrounds the church. Superposed over the sower of Juliet is the tower of an active trace ofthe castle of Romeo. The church ofMontecchio is an active presence registering the idea of union. The third superposition reveals the idea of dialectical relationship between union and division operating in the texts. Now the castle of Juliet is registered as an active presence over the tomb which is in the cemetery in the city of Verona. The final aspect to be confronted is representation. In architecture, discourse has been represented in figuration, that is, in the object. Representation medi? ates and thus separates discoursefrom figuration. In this projectfiguration is united with discourse in order to create an architecture as text. In such a condition, representation is denied for an object as presentation, as a text. Representation refers outside itself to an origin; text does not. Text refers inward to its own structure, text has the capacity for an infinite combination of previous texts into new texts; the three-dimensional experience yields open-ended readings. This introduces the possibility of'error, of a text not leading to a truth or a valued conclusion, but rather to a sequential tissue of misreading?errors which produce the condition for each new level of reading. Here narrative is no longer a teleology from an origin to a final goal oftruth, but rather is an infinite series of infinite superpositions. These superpositions appear in a labyrinth, which is located at the site of the castle of Juliet. Like the story of Romeo and Juliet, it is an analogic expression ofthe unresolved tension between fate and free will. Here the labyrinth, like the castle sites, becomes a palimpsest. While the castle sites are a reality which revealsfiction, the labyrinth is a hyperfiction (a fiction of those fictions) which reveals a hyperreality. In the labyrinth, three re-presentations of the narrative concepts of division, union, and their g2 AA FILES 12</page><page sequence="8">Plates 28,29,30?the final superposition. dialectical relationship are found, created by superposing three self similar scalings. Thefirst involves the cemetery of the city being superposed over the grid of the old city of Verona so that there is a self similar registration of the axes of the old cemetery (treated as a czrdo and decumznus)superposed on the actual cardo and decumanus of the old city. The cemetery is now analogically the city. In this scaling the tower ofthe castle of Juliet is registered on and becomes analogous to the house of Juliet in the city of Verona (this becomes the locus of the descent into the labyrinth). The castle of fuliet thus becomes the house of Juliet in the cemetery of Verona as the city of Verona. In the second scaling, the cemetery is enlarged so that the church of Verona is located in the same relationship to the axes of the cemetery as is Juliet 's house to the axes of the city of Verona in the previous scaling. Here the house of fuliet as the castle of fuliet becomes analogous to the church of Verona, in the cemetery of Verona. A third scaling is made: the cemetery is again enlarged so that the tomb of Juliet in the cemetery of Verona occupies the same position relative to the axes of the cemetery as the house and the church at previous scalings. Now the house of Juliet as the castle of Juliet in the cemetery of Verona as the city of Verona finally becomes the tomb of Juliet in the cemetery of Verona. The closing of the text on the text detaches this analogous processfrom the pursuit of a geometric ideal. It is this closure potential in self-similarity which opens the possibility for a textual architecture. A t this lowest level of the labyrinth the foundations of the actual castle ofJuliet are found This is the level of hyperreality (thefiction turning into reality). Here another series of scalings is set in motion, and a return to reality through the tower of the actual castle of Juliet. These two conditions?the hyperfiction and the hyperreal?deny origin and closure in both fiction (which is seen to have no origin or end in reality) and reality (which has no origin or end in fiction). Likewise, this project can never achieve finality or closure. There is something yet to be written before the reality ofthe site of Montecchio, and after thefictions of the Verona of Romeo and Juliet. Here architecture does not close or unify, but rather opens and disperses, fragments and destabilizes, not only as a condition of its own being but as an exploration of its resonance with the always changing conception of nature and human endeavour.

It is this process of reference by the technique of translation, the mechanism that allows the design to carry the meanings associated with a narrative structure, that is my interest. A complete description of all the scalings used in the project and their intended meanings is given in the text which accompanies it. In this article I will examine just one of the scalings, because I am interested not so much in the project per se, but in how it works and the implications of this kind of symbolic functioning for architectural theory. The first scaling (represented in the axonometric drawing) re-'locates the city of Verona [at scale 1:5000] in the castle of Romeo' at Montecchio, and is used to illustrate the complex theme of union and division in the three versions of the play. 'This relationship is determined so that the real castle of Romeo surrounds the imposed city of Verona while the site of Montecchio in relation to Verona [at scale 1:5000] is located so that the images of the two castles in Montecchio fall one inside the other outside the real Juliet castle'. In terms of architec? tural technique (the mechanism of the meaning rather than the meaning itself), what has happened in this example is precisely as I described it. There is first the selection of certain qualities of an object, in this case the plan of Verona (notice that a con? cept such as 'the plan structure of Verona' appears to be inseparable from the material of its represent? ation). There is then the rescaling of these (and only these) properties of that object (in this case there is a cartographic representation of Verona made at the scale of 1:5000). There is then the mov? ing of this highly selective representation to a new site (in this case Montecchio). This summarizes the sheer technique of the scalings made, but the archi? tectural interest lies in the relation of technique to the meanings made. How is it, then, that a techni? cal translation across scale and place achieves archi? tectural meaning and literary references? This scaling, says Eisenman, 'reveals aspects of the structure of the textual narrative'. In it, Romeo is represented as attempting 'to unite a Verona divided between the Capuletti and the Montecchi'. Romeo's desire for unification is symbolized by the image of his castle surrounding Verona, but the rescaled river of Verona fractures the real castle of Romeo as he tries to achieve his aim. The juxta? position of physical qualities, a 'surrounding' by the rescaled image of a castle and a 'fracturing' by the rescaled image of a river, is used to symbolize the struggle for unification and further suggests the tragedy that will unfold in the story.29 How can bricks, stones and beams, silent in and of themselves, be composed to ring out the mean? ings of a story? The choices available in technique are guided by the meanings found and made. There is no closed formal logic being used, which can guide the selection, scaling or placement. Instead, these judgements are determined by the external relationships generated in their new context. But there is an inescapable duality here, for the mean? ings made (those things referred to by the form of this design) are themselves nothing but arranged forms carrying their own references to other arranged forms, and so on. We see, then, that the process of architectural meaning, like all meaning, is a relative one. There are no canons which can give an absolute grounding to the architect's inten? tions. Instead, whether a building has meaning can be determined only by the way forms operate in a tradition in which the lack of an absolute found? ation for actions is overcome for a time by our own conventionalizing ? the validity and efficacy of the symbols which we make and use. In this example of scaling Eisenman is using spatial structures to refer to temporal or narrative ones.30 And the reference turns on a play of differ? ence against the constant identity of certain objects ? like the castles, their images and their names.31 Eisenman has in subsequent projects refined and extended the concept of scaling, and in his own opinion the scaling which I have examined here is not as successful as it might be ? 'It doesn't pop', he now says, meaning that it does not produce its own unpredictable readings. The use of the word 'pop' is intended, I think, to convey a double sense of complexity and fit, stab? ility and instability, and so on. This same sense in aesthetic reasoning is discussed extensively by Wittgenstein in his lectures on aesthetics. In his use of the word 'click' Wittgenstein is trying to deter? mine what kind of understanding or legitimation is involved in the interjection 'Aha, that's it!'32 Aes? thetic explanation is not causal explanation, he says, meaning that we cannot trace a direct mech? anism to achieve an aesthetic understanding.33 In? stead, aesthetic explanation has more to do with grasping the structure and rules of a formal game, and this means understanding the game's own cul? tural and self-referential history, its present uses and internal logics, and the possibility of the failure of these logics.34 Wittgenstein uses the word 'click' to communicate this sense that a kind of structur? ing has been achieved and made familiar. Famili? arity allows one to move forward and deal with novel instances in the same formal game or prob? lem. This 'moving forward' is not predetermined (that is, it cannot be known precisely in advance of actually doing it), but is at least determin^/e (for example, by trying things out ? 'I find something "working" if I do this but not this', and so on). With the device of scaling, Eisenman is seeking configurations which construct the similarities and the differences of his design in order to achieve the project's double meanings. Romeo and Juliet the project is architectural research into its own suc? cess, and this has allowed Eisenman, on reflection, to discriminate between the different levels of suc? cess in the scalings which he makes. Usually we associate technical precision in art, such as is dis? played in the Romeo and Juliet design, with cold? ness, but the technicality of the discriminations made by the process of scaling is turned from cold to warm, from harsh to delicate, by the beauty of their allusions.35 At certain moments the Romeo and Juliet project does indeed 'click', and this re? makes an equivocation between method and mean? ing in a modern instance. John Whiteman I would like to acknowledge the help and insights offered to me in writing this essay. Nelson Goodman and Hilary Putnam provided useful criticisms from the perspective of the theory of symbols. Harry Cobb provided valuable comments on a previous draft. Peter Eisenman read and commented on the draft extensively. 29. The structural symbolism of the play is, of course, very complex. For example, one of the dominant structural interpretations of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is the reversal of the traditional symbolism of light and dark, night and day. Romeo is warm and safe only at night, in danger in daylight, until the end, when love and death are brought together in the dark? ness of the tomb. As Swinburne later noted, 'Love and death march to the same tune.' 30. Paradoxically, we are always forced to make repres? entations of time in a spatial medium, like the face of a clock or the 'spatial' sequence of numbers. 31. We could have given a similar explanation of the more complex construction of the 'glasses', showing how the constant or sameness of the castles in the ver? tical dimension is played off against the changing scale of the Verona cemetery in the horizontal dimension to provide a cumulative commentary on the evo? lution of the story in the hands of three authors: Da Porto, Bandello and Shakespeare. See: Accompanying Text, pp. 4-5. 32. See: Lectures and Conversations on Aesthetics, edited by C. Barrett (University of California Press, 1938), p. 3. 33. And by this Wittgenstein means to exclude any possi? bility of a psychological explanation of aesthetic understanding (ibid. p. 18). 34. These are complex thoughts indeed, and Wittgen? stein's own text, while illuminating, is also frustrat? ing, in that it relates as much to his own game-like philosophy as it does to aesthetics. But perhaps this is progress? 35. It is also worth noting that it is impossible to bridge the conceptual gap between the technique of the sym? bol and the meaning which is made. This double edged quality of the discussion arises from the fact that the symbol and its ways are intrinsic to the art work. In a discussion reminiscent of this inability to distinguish the meaningful from the material, Witt genstein once said that perhaps the best image of the human soul is the human body. Part of the problem, he said, is that, if I ask you to distinguish between the two, you do not quite know what to distinguish from that. The duality is also present in the quote from C. S. Pierce at the beginning of the second section. 84 AA FILES 12</page></plain_text>
