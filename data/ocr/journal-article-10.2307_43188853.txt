<plain_text><page sequence="1">INTERVIEW The Sense of the Past and the Writing of History: Stephen Bann in Conversation with Karen Lang Karen Lang Karen Lang: I'd like to start in the 1960s, when you were writing about concrete art. You were also concerned with kinetic art, comparative criticism, history, and more besides. But in one of your first publications on concrete art you noted that all definitions are dangerous. I think that's a fitting place to begin because from the outset you haven't necessarily inhabited a discipline but a space between disci- plines. I wonder if you would tell us about your intellectual formation? Stephen Bann: Thank you very much, Karen. I will follow your suggestion by starting in 1964. Because I think it may be too tedious to begin before that. That was the stage at which I was just beginning my postgraduate work. And I must say, first of all, I have to make a confession. Michael Fried some- times reminds me about this with a certain irony. In America, they'd say you weren't "trained" as an art historian. No, I wasn't. In fact, that's true of many people of my generation. Art history has spread, ramified, a great deal since then. But 1964 was, I think, a crucial moment for me because, in the first place, I had just read Ernst Gombrich's Meditations on a Hobby Horse. Having done a fairly conventional history degree at Cambridge, I found this to be a work that suddenly seemed to offer new possibilities. Not necessarily in relation to the work that I was doing in history and history of historiography, but because I could see how it very much applied to the work of the artists of the present day. I had been tremendously impressed by the great Rauschenberg exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery earlier in the year - in fact, I had made a brief television appearance on the local Anglia Television talking about the exhibition. So I wrote an article called "Rauschenberg and Representation."1 That was an attempt to see how the concept of representation was integral to Rauschenberg. I was responding to the great Gombrich essay where he writes about the "hobby horse," putting forward the notion of the substitute rather than the analog in represen- tation. I think that's something I've never ceased to be con- cerned with. Now, a bit later in that particular year, I was off to Paris. This was with the blessing of my PhD supervisor, who was a great man: Sir Herbert Butterfield. His name means little today, perhaps. He was probably the only major intellectual historian of the modern period then teaching at Cambridge. Butterfield had written, when very young, a book that really established his reputation as early as the 1930s. It was called The Whig View of History, and what he was saying, effectively, was that the Whig view is an attitude that not only abridges history, and makes history abstract, it also propagated a kind of historical writing that dealt with all issues in contemporary terms. This was the history that in Butterfield's view was very dominant through the school that led from Lord Macaulay and his successors to present-day Cambridge. He was affirm- ing that history must be concrete. We must bring back the past in a concrete form. So he was probably the only person at Cambridge who would have been willing to supervise - and did supervise - a thesis which was concerned, on the historio- graphical level, with the implications of doing precisely that. Butterfield gave me two pieces of good advice when I was setting off for Paris in the autumn of 1964. One was: make friends with the old lady! You may be puzzled by that, but I had told him that the family château of the person I was writing on, the early nineteenth-century historian and politi- cian Prosper de Barante, was still in the family's hands. The baronne de Barante was still there every summer, and the family had actually preserved one of the finest - to be precise, the second-finest - private library in the whole of France. So for subsequent summers, over several years after that, I would visit the château de Barante and immerse myself in the riches that were there. The second piece of advice - perhaps it really wasn't advice, but what Butterfield brought up in a long letter that he wrote to me at the time - was the significance of the concept of "historical-mindedness." Now this was something that he had very profoundly studied, looking both at contem- porary German historiography and the earlier German his- torical writings of all kinds. He was one of the very few English historians of that period who had a truly European network of connections. We had talked about "historical- mindedness," and in his letter he suggested that historical- mindedness is a concept that people are well accustomed to studying in relation to the Renaissance. That is the canonical period, in terms of history of art as well as other modes of history, when people believe that the fascination with the past begins. But what he was saying to me, I suppose, was that you're quite right to start looking at the period around 1800, as a time in which the sense of the past developed in a fashion that was qualitatively different from anything that went before. Actually, Michael Bentley's recent biography of Butterfield quotes that letter written to me and relates it to the fact that Butterfield was then preparing to give the Gifford Lec- tures on that particular subject. He would later regard them as a failure, according to Bentley, because he was intent on proving that the "sense of the past" was a product of the development of historical science. I can say that nothing in my experience has tended to support that hypothesis. In fact, from my work as an art historian in particular, I would conclude that the two modes of relating to the past are asymptotic. They may, or may not, run in parallel, but they never meet.</page><page sequence="2">INTERVIEW: BANN IN CONVERSATION WITH LANG 545 Stephen Bann in conversation with Karen Lang, Association of Art Historians, 38th Annual Conference, University of Warwick, 2011 (photograph ©Joanne Anderson) Yet I have certainly stuck to Butterfield's original intuition and tried to develop it. This actually landed me in hot water at one later stage when I gave a seminar at Harvard. I was invited by Norman Bryson, and, as it happened, John Shear- man, the great historian of Renaissance art, was in the audi- ence. I was talking about the French painter François-Marius Granet and the amazing paintings that he completed in Rome shortly after Napoléon had suppressed the monaster- ies - trying, as he put it, to "recover the sweet sense of peace I'd had before." I was suggesting that this was a mood that was essentially created by the historical rupture of the French Revolution, and it was really quite different from anything that had manifested before. John Shearman was extremely indignant. He suggested that this was yet another attempt to take people's attention away from the Renaissance, and the Renaissance was indeed the period in which the modern sense of history developed. I believe that you can be aware of the significance of the Renaissance and also remain preoc- cupied with the particular phase after the French Revolution when, not only in France but in other countries as well, somehow the sense of the past started to become more concrete than ever before. Lang: Yes. I'm put in mind of Gustave Flaubert, who captured that sense so beautifully in Madame Bovary. At the awards ceremony in the village an old woman is carted onto the platform and a medal is fastened to her breast, though she knows not why. In this scene the sense of the past has changed, it has become "official," and it is made startlingly concrete. Working on history and art history as you do, how do you reconcile "the sense of the past" we find in literature and art, say, and in the historical science? How do you negotiate the asymptotic relation between the two? Bann: I think the main point is that one has to have a foot in both camps. Your question reminds me of a question posed to me at a recent conference, when I was talking about the extraordinary development of lithography in the early nine- teenth century and its capacity to seize the historical moment in respect of the July Revolution of 1830 in Paris. The ques- tion was whether the intense response to the historical event was in any way reflected in changes in historiography. My immediate response was that this was not the case. It was the novelists who kept pace in their own ways with the technical novelty of the lithograph. So, when Stendhal wrote the re- markable passages in La Chartreuse de Parme about the young Fabrice del Dongo desperately trying to find the action at the Battle of Waterloo, the parallel might be in, say, Horace Vernet's wonderful lithographs of detached moments in a batde - so radically different from the bird's-eye view of ear- lier pictorial treatments. But of course I could have answered that my work, from The Clothing of Clio onward, has often been concerned with the role played by illustration in historical works.2 A work like Augustin Thierry's History of the Conquest of England by the Normans accumulated more and more images in its successive editions, culminating in a full "adas" of relevant visual material. This was not just a matter of com- mercial exploitation by the publishers. Readers were also viewers, of the paintings at the Salon as well as the wood engravings in the illustrated magazines. They brought certain expectations to the reading of historical texts, and these were progressively fulfilled. I made the point, however, in The Clothing of Clio that Jules Michelet represents a more sophis- ticated and self-aware stage in responding to this process. His histories eschewed illustrations because they were in part meditations on the visual legacy of the past - that is, the stock of historical portraiture dating from the period with which he was concerned.</page><page sequence="3">546 ART bulletin December 2013 volume xcv number 4 1 Stephen Bann, Tierce de Picardie , London: Coracle Press, 1975 (lettering by Ron Costley) Lang: Let's go back to Gombrich's conception of represen- tation as substitution, which I believe you talk about in rela- tion to concrete poetry. The notion of representation as substitution reminds me of Nietzsche's theory of representa- tion in The Birth of Tragedy. I bring this up because it would seem Nietzsche is also an influence. I don't know if this came from your adviser at Cambridge or just on your own. Repeat- edly in your writing you take up the Nietzschean idea - actually, you take up several Nietzschean ideas, but let's start with this idea - of taking a few steps back. Taking a few steps back seems to resonate with your historical-mindedness. Bann: Yes. You are right to mention that I was involved at the same time with contemporary poetics. Let me add a short footnote on the question of representation. Again I am talk- ing about the year 1964. This was also the year when I first met Ian Hamilton Finlay. I went up to see him in Edinburgh and, as a result of that visit, published a short article, "Com- munication and Structure in Concrete Poetry," which was very much indebted to another essay in the Hobby Horse collection, where Gombrich investigates the concept of "se- mantic space."3 So there were two strands of activity going at the same time, and from that point onward I also began to write concrete poems, which gradually took over from the topographical watercolors I had done before. It seemed to me that one could use printed language as a material, involv- ing spatial references and configurations that wouldn't nec- essarily be richer than - but would certainly appear very dif- ferent from - the more or less figurative landscapes that I had done before. These were initially produced in postcard for- mat (Fig. 1 ) , but later silk-screened by my friend Bob Chap- lin, with whom I had a joint exhibition of historical and topographical works in 1980. Now I come to my interest in Nietzsche. As you rightly say, this is a source that I have found extraordinarily useful. In Nietzsche's Use and Abuse of History , which is the text that I have used most often, the central argument is that there are three possible positions in relation to history: the antiquar- ian, the monumental, and the critical. The essential point to bear in mind, of course, is that none of the three is entirely good or entirely bad. The antiquarian, Nietzsche says, "breathes a moldy air." But that's not all that could be said about the antiquarian. Also he has respect for his forefathers, respect for the place in which he lives, and so on and so forth. I am often reminded of that "moldy air" in connection with another of my heroes, Sir Walter Scott. Scott talks about how a good ruin is "like a good Stilton cheese," promoting this idea of an unmediated, almost oral appetite for the past. The monumental, of course, is something very different. It is a relation to the great achievements of the past that Nietz- sche recognizes in the founding fathers of German history. The critical dimension, then, is essential for Nietzsche, since it is the function that he himself most distinctively supplies. I can cite one recent issue in my work that was, if not resolved, at least helped by the use of these three categories. I was asked to write something about Horace Walpole for the fine catalog published in relation to the Strawberry Hill exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum (2010), which I suspect many of the audience saw.4 Horace Walpole had always posed a problem to me insofar as I thought about him as an eighteenth-century man, and yet in so many ways he anticipated "the Romantic Interior," to use Clive Wain- wright's book title. He was somebody who in terms of his social position, his aesthetic tastes, and all of his attitudes to collecting was in some ways a pioneer, but he also looked back to the period of James I, when in his view the Middle Ages really come to an end, with the reign that preceded the English Civil War. So he had a really intriguing blend of interests, which seem to be difficult to coordinate. I'd been thinking about this for a certain time when it occurred to me that one of the ways of looking at this would be in terms of Nietzsche's three positions. You could really see the monu- mental aspect, the antiquarian aspect, and the critical as- pect - or the ironic aspect, I suppose you might also call it - all forming a kind of texture within which Horace Wal- pole 's multiple achievements might be understood. I would say that my problem initially as a historian of historiography was that I was working in a domain that had been established, the history of what historians wrote, but was deadly dull. You had to sort of plow through books that didn't really present the issue that was interesting to me, which was: Why are people fascinated by the past, and how can we track the sense of the past, and the history of the sense of the past, as it can be observed in concrete forms of repre- sentation? That was something which took me a long time to work out. I mean, it took me about ten years or so, because I was very keen to be a historian. I wasn't going to spin theories out of the air. I think the first intuition really came to me when I found a footnote by Michelet. This was long after I</page><page sequence="4">INTERVIEW: BANN IN CONVERSATION WITH LANG 547 had finished my PhD, which was preparatory work, but noth- ing more than that. It was around the late 1960s, when I discovered that Michelet had said: "if you examine the histo- rians of the present day, Barante, Thierry, and myself form a kind of cycle. You can only understand one in relation to the others." Now this is just a footnote in Michelet's correspon- dence. And I don't think that anybody had paid much atten- tion to it before then. But I was thinking to myself of that idea of a cycle - one, two, three - in which number two relates to number one, number three relates to number two and num- ber one, and the whole sequence forms a kind of system. I was reading, roughly at the same time, Claude Lévi-Strauss' s The Raw and the Cooked {Le cru et le cuit), which begins with this wonderful "Overture," as he calls it, in which he talks about music. He talks about composers of "the code," of "the mes- sage," and of "the myth": about Bach, Beethoven, and Wag- ner. He uses that particular series of examples, presumably very familiar to his readers, in order to clarify a structural point: that we have here a cycle, code, message, and myth, which relates to Roman Jakobson' s different functions of discourse, and so has its basis in linguistics. So I suddenly saw a way of dealing with the Michelet cycle. Is it íAařkind of cycle? I published an essay in 1970, which was a way of testing that hypothesis.5 That was also my first acquaintance with the concept of ricorso. Michelet himself was not particularly interested in dialectics, certainly not inter- ested in the idea of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, but thought very much in terms of cycles, and the person he looked back to, I suppose the paradigm case of somebody talking about cyclical or spiraling views of history, was Giam- battista Vico. Vico indeed sees this motion of ricorso , or of returning to an earlier point in a cyclical progression, as being one of the fundamental motivating factors of history. Lang: Yes, and that really puts pressure on a developmental idea of history. With the ricorso , as you say, we have the spiral. Nietzsche also talks about the spiral. So it's not simply a return to an earlier point; it's a sort of widening out, too. If we think of the motion of the spiral in terms of space (and I think senses of space have been on your mind, from the concrete poetry onward) , then this kind of history concerns not only points in time or places in time but also spaces. Those spaces can embody different temporalities. Those spaces can comprise the past, the present, the near, the far. Bann: Yes, I think that one way of answering that would be to say that at a certain point in my career, I'd been working very largely on spatial representation. I had published one of the first international anthologies of concrete poetry in 1967 and devoted much thought to the setting of poems on the page. Then, by the early 1970s, I had been commissioned by Robert Motherwell to compile an anthology of texts on the history of Constructivism for the series Documents of Modern Art, which he was still editing. In both instances, it involved drawing material from a wide range of international sources, and in the case of my Tradition of Constructivism (1974), I felt the need to provide a spatial representation of the process whereby a movement that began in Russia acquired an inter- national dimension, extending as far as the United States with the emigration of artists like Naum Gabo and László 20th1 Century Studies December 1976 Visual Poetics Jan Mukarovsky Max Bense Umberto Eco Victor Burgin Hubert Damisch Jean-Louis Schefer Marcelin Pleynet Stephen Bann 15/16 2 Cover of "Visual Poetics," double issue of 20th Century Studies 15-16 (December 1976) Moholy-Nagy.6 My friend Philip Steadman devised the ele- gant chart, which has sometimes been titled "Constructivism Moves West" and turns up in the company of other spatial representations of modernism, such as Alfred Barr' s famous diagram. In fact, it has recently resurfaced in a new edition of Richard Kostelanetz's 1975 anthology Essaying Essays: Alterna- tive Forms of Exposition. As the 1970s progressed, I was also deputy editor, then editor of the journal 20th Century Studies , and I was editing a number of collections of essays: on structuralism, the French new novel, Russian formalism, and so on. As my final double number, in 1976, I put together a little group of texts that I still very much value, entitled "Visual Poetics," where I juxta- posed essays by myself and by the artist Victor Bürgin with those by theorists from very different traditions: the Middle- European semioticians Jan Mukarovsky and Max Bense, and three French writers - Hubert Damisch, Marcelin Pleynet, and Jean-Louis Schefer - whose work still means a great deal to me (Fig. 2). So all these dimensions - historical and contemporary - were of interest to me, and the point you make about what sort of space should they occupy, or should there be multiple spaces, is a relevant one. I decided then to do a rather</page><page sequence="5">548 ART bulletin December 2013 volume xcv number 4 adventurous thing, I suppose - something that could easily have failed. I wrote a study called The True Vine , which was really trying to begin a long way back - to start with the Greeks and come up to the present day.7 But to do this in terms of organizing the material around a series of nodes: the representation of the object, beginning with Zeuxis and the grapes, and following the tradition of still life; the represen- tation of the self, typified by images of Narcissus; and thirdly, that of history. For the last of the three, I looked at the story of the True Cross, which is surely the greatest and most comprehensive historical epic to have emerged from Western consciousness, and gave rise along the line to an incredible number of superb works of art from the medieval period through to Piero della Francesca, Adam Elsheimer, and in- deed survived into the eighteenth century. The best way in which I could identify what I was trying to do there was again by taking a phrase from Nietzsche, in this case from Human , All Too Human , where he talks about the attitude to the past in terms of climbing a ladder. There are two comparisons involved, actually. He says that invoking the past is a process similar to how the ox plows, the "boustro- phedon." You go back and you return along parallel tracks, you can't actually proceed in straight lines, but you take the curves that lead you into the next furrow, and so on. That is another way of conveying the spiral motion, I suggest. But Nietzsche also uses the idea of the ladder. He says something that has always rung in my mind: that no one who wants to see far ahead stands on the topmost rung of the ladder. What you have to do to see furthest is to take a few steps back. That has been always my rule when looking at the art of the twentieth century. I think that if you start in 1900, which because of the century division, seems very plausible - and at least until recently was the century we were living in, therefore contem- porary and not only modern - then in my view you immedi- ately prejudice all kinds of issues around modernism, around the connection between modernism and postmodernism, and so on. And so taking a few steps back, both chronologi- cally, and also conceptually, is perhaps the way to see further. Lang: I'm reminded here of your comment about "no short breaks" and of the way you've enacted this in your writing. The idea of short breaks between periods or short breaks between modernism and postmodernism really is a fiction. Moving back, you've put pressure on definitions of modern- ism and postmodernism. For instance, your book Ways around Modernism looks at Manet but then takes a swerve toward Ingres to talk about the ways his art, which concerns repro- duction and the multiplication of images, leads to a different definition of modernism from the one we generally hear about and, consequently, to a different notion of postmod- ernism. Bann: Yes, I start with quite a simple proposition that we can't really know how we are to take postmodernism, or under- stand postmodernism, if we don't take into account the gen- esis of modernism: how that particular concept develops.8 That is the initial proposition or hypothesis to begin with. But the real paradox, which you touch on, seems to me that, on the one hand, in talking about modernism, we are fated to talk about Manet! And I don't in any way deny that. I would subscribe to that point of view absolutely, without any reserve. On the other hand, what is happening at the time that Manet is painting, and in a certain relation to it - although I wouldn't wish to define it in simple terms - is an absolutely exponential development in the multiplication of images. The painters who are most interested in their work being multiplied - either in the form of engravings, initially, or later in the form of photographs - are, of course, not the modernists, or not principally the modernists, or not only the modernists. The activities of Adolphe Goupil, the great French pioneer of the marketing of contemporary art in the nineteenth century, also have to be at the center of attention for me. So that one is talking here about another history, but a history that is simultaneously affecting - through processes that are obviously much more diverse than can be under- stood in simply following the history of the Salon paintings - the evolution of our ways of seeing. This is made very clear by a phenomenon like the major Gérôme exhibition, which took place in Los Angeles, Paris, and Madrid a few years ago. We notice, of course, that virtually all the major paintings by Jean-Léon Gérôme are in the United States. They left France through the good offices of Goupil, Gérôme 's father-in-law, and they succeeded in fertilizing a certain culture of the image, which is blazoned across the skies by Hollywood. But this was not just a matter of the diffusion of the paintings. As the exhibition showed, Gérôme and Goupil were dedicated to making innumerable print reproductions of the paintings. So in Ways around Modernism , as in my earlier book Parallel Lines , I was interested in seeing how you could so to speak revise the idea of modernism as a kind of parenthesis within history, and bring it into conjunction with the other history of the multiplication of images, and the development of the visual technologies in the modern world.9 Lang: Manet looked at paintings incessantly, of course, and he quoted or took from reproductions. Should we conceive of tradition, modernism, and postmodernism as a cycle, then, in which, as you put it earlier, two takes from one and three takes from one and two? Doing so would certainly help revise our rather wooden term "avant-garde." Bann: I am tempted to say that anything would be better than perpetuating that tired old military metaphor! Certainly we are very far away from the position of Clement Greenberg in 1970 when he wrote of the avant-garde being "alone with itself' and "in full possession of the 'scene.' " I like triadic models, as in the case of Lévi-Strauss' s code, myth, and message. But I think there is a wider perspective to be inves- tigated, and from that point of view we are perhaps talking not just about the succession of modes of discourse but of a quasi-Freudian return of the repressed: in other words, the persistence of underground or disregarded discourses that often confuse us by taking on a succession of different names. Postmodernism is perhaps their legatee, rather than being the sign of any epochal break. Lang: Displacing postmodernism moves the attention from irony to curiosity. You have studied curiosity from the early modern period, when curiosity (and curiosity cabinets) came</page><page sequence="6">INTERVIEW: BANN IN CONVERSATION WITH LANG 549 to the fore as central motivating concepts for collections. But then thinking about curiosity as it shapes and unhinges post- modernism seems to be a very productive strategy . . . Bann: Yes, I think it is. I became interested in curiosity pardy for the very local reason that probably the finest extant collection of curiosities in Britain happens to be in the ar- chive and library of the Cathedral of Canterbury, left by one John Bargrave when he died in 1680, and accompanied by a wonderful catalog and a set of annotations - let's say ex- tremely scabrous annotations - of the collection of portraits of cardinals that he brought back from his visits to Rome (Fig. 3) . All of these things were there in the city where I live, close to hand. But looking further into the way in which curiosity is important, in its historical development, in relation to what's happening today, I came across the work of Krzysztof Pomian, very much the main figure who, over a long period of time, had been writing about curiosity. And Pomian had had his Foucault phase. Some of his earliest, still to my knowledge untranslated, work was a direct reaction to Michel Foucault's Les mots et les choses (The Order of Things). Pomian makes this very suggestive, but in my view ultimately falla- cious, statement that curiosity was an "interim regime" be- tween the regime of religion and that of science. Now that would be a classic Foucauldian position, you might say, of distinct epistemes. The more I looked at the question, the more it seemed to me that what was happening was in fact rather different: that the progress of curiosity, at least ini- tially, developed from what Foucault would call the Renais- sance episteme, from the habit of making analogies between disparate parts of the world - what's under the sea, what's on top of the mountains - and looking at nature essentially as a divine plan illustrated by all of these different correspon- dences and analogies. Now the scientific spirit in the seven- teenth century repudiated curiosity to the extent that it de- pended on the observation of particulars. I remember a phrase that I quoted from Francis Bacon where he says that it's a "curiosity" to place a fruit tree on the north side of a wall: in other words, when you plant the fruit tree where it won't fruit, it is a curiosity. In other words, it's something against nature. And the regard for particulars above all is also against reason, because science progresses through the amal- gamation of instances, experimentally tested and so resulting in general laws. In this context, my view of what happens to curiosity is rather different from Pomian 's. Curiosity does not actually disappear with the rise of science, it takes on other forms. One of the forms it takes - let's say the motivations are very similar, although they turn in more specifically historical directions - is that of antiquarianism. Antiquarianism vali- dates the attachment to the individual object. But the attach- ment to these historical objects also takes on much more of an affective, even emotional character, compared with that of a seventeenth-century traveler like Bargrave, who always looks at his objects with a certain reserve.10 What has happened in that process can be traced up to the manifestations of curi- osity at the present day. Surrealism is a cult of the object that is at the same time a reaction against the Constructivist trend of modernism, and also ramifies in all sorts of other direc- tions, into anthropology, and so on and so forth. At the 3 John Bargrave, page with portrait of Cardinal Gian Carlo de' Medici, after an engraving in The Effigies published by G. G. de Rossi (1657), from College of Cardinals, , 1662-80. Archive of Canterbury Cathedral (artwork in the public domain; photograph by permission of the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury Cathedral) present day, we may be misguided in looking at certain tenden- cies as the result of Surrealism when they could be more appro- priately seen as instances of curiosity in a new guise. I remember talking to Hal Foster about this, because he has written about the kinds of art that he and the October group don't really consider to be art but count instead as a form of ethnography. He seems to be quite interested in this idea of a return of curiosity, and he quoted to me Donald Judd's idea that his art should simply be "interesting." That is, in a way, a moti- vation very comparable to curiosity. It's fundamentally different from the hegemonic tradition of the beautiful, the tradition of high art. In the nineteenth century, when Charles Blanc started the Gazette des Beaux-Arts , everyone knew what the "fine arts" meant - the arts of disegno or dessin, comprising architecture, painting, sculpture, engraving, and so on - gardening, even. Then, on the other hand, the second title of the Gazette des</page><page sequence="7">550 ART BULLETIN DECEMBER 2013 VOLUME XCV NUMBER 4 4 Cover of the Gazette des Beaux-Arts (1861) Beaux-Arts was Courrier européen de Vart et de la curiosité , and that covered a multitude of things like the occasional Far Eastern object discussed in the Gazette , and even the occasional "Wood- burytype" photograph that was printed in the Gazette (Fig. 4). That was a curiosity as well. So at a time when Baudelaire gave the collective edition of his writings the tide that it has retained, Curiosités esthétiques , there was this space newly available for what was not classed as high art. One could say that the curiosity/ antiquarian tradition now informs much of the production of many immediately contemporary artists. Indeed, it reaches much further back. I have recently been given the task of writing about the "boxes" of Joseph Cornell in the light of the tradition of curiosity. It is fascinating that if one reads Greenberg's early review of Cornell's work, the issue is entirely about Cornell's position within the spectrum of Surrealism. Poor Cornell was so uneasy about being put in that bracket that he even wrote on one occasion to Alfred Barr asking instead to be described as an "American Constructivist"! I think we can do a lot better by invoking sometimes quite distant manifestations with regard to modernist art. Lang: This shows us that curiosity is not only a historical concept, it is also a motivating one - a way of seeing, a way of considering. For the Gazette des Beaux-Arts to employ the term curiosity to include objects from China, objects from Japan, and so on, shows right there a sort of spatial boundary in suggesting what lay outside the conceptual contours of art, which is something your writing reveals. In terms of this idea of curiosity as a kind of motivating concept, it seems to me part of your interest in curiosity, which I am very sympathetic to, arises from its location between the known and the un- known, and from the way it puts pressure on received ideas of art, including what we might imagine art to be. Art can turn into a Baconian fact, free from all theory. Curiosity, then, offers just the kind of needling we need. As a mode, curiosity pushes against our efforts to take those received ideas as givens. Instead, it pushes us to explore the situation anew, which you do in your own writing. Bann: Yes, I would say in reply to your point that there is a sense in which curiosity is a state in which the ordinary subject-object relation is modified. Take the subject-object relation as one in which there is a clear distinction between subject and object - the object is knowable, completely know- able, and the subject is in possession of, or in a position of power in relation to, the object. By contrast, the object of curiosity always answers back. It invites stories to be written about it, and that again is why I refer to John Bargrave for a very fascinating example. He will, for example, include in his cabinet a stiletto. And then he will say: this is the kind of stiletto that was used for assassinating people in dark alley- ways in Venice in the seventeenth century. You can see the little place where the poison would be secreted. We can then add our own complementary story. Bargrave must have been well aware through his close relation Sir Henry Wotton, the British ambassador to Venice, that the great Venetian church- man and scientist Paolo Sarpi was nearly assassinated by a Jesuit, in fact, who had been dispatched on that errand to the free city of Venice by the Counter-Reformation papacy. Now, coming up to the immediately contemporary period, I could actually talk about quite a few artists who seem to me to adopt that particular way of looking at, and being interrogated by, the object. One would be Cornelia Parker, who employs the tiny, thin strands of material extracted from Sigmund Freud's couch, though admittedly, she does also provoke and perpet- uate great explosions! In each case, there is a kind of situa- tion in which the object is not exacdy undefinable but it is certainly elusive. She is telling stories about something, and you want to hear those stories as well. I can remember a particularly wonderful example of this, which I witnessed at a show in the United States. She placed on exhibition the nightdress that Mia Farrow wore in Rosemary's Baby , I believe. You saw it at the end of a long corridor. And you respond, oh, yes, that's the dress behind a glass screen. But the strange thing about it was that this was a kind of glass that, the closer you approached - I don't really understand how - the more indistinct the dress appeared, and so it seemed to move away from you. So when you got right up to it, as it were, you didn't see it closely, indeed, you hardly saw it at all. That seemed to me a very effective paradigm for the relationship of artist/ material, artist/work, subject/ object, and so on. Again, this shifting, oblique relationship is involved. Lang: Of course, Walter Benjamin famously says that the aura looks back at us. I believe he means to suggest its elusiveness.

Keeping on with Benjamin now, let's turn to origins. In what you've written, I see you've tackled the origin as a point in time. For me, coming from the German side of things, I think of Benjamin's description of the origin as an emer- gence that can only be discovered retrospectively. No clear path exists from past to present. You also speak of emergence when you speak of origins and you show how no clear devel- opmental line arises. This obviously puts pressure on the view of time as an arrow and of history as developmental. Instead, we can imagine radiating lines, if you will, and in terms of meaning, we can say that various things are possible. Bann: Well, I'd like to say a bit about Benjamin because The Origin of German Tragic Drama is a work that I read long ago, and I greatly admire for the sort of reasons you give. But I do think that, as regards Benjamin's work as a whole, one of the problems is that we haven't successfully or fully managed to historicize Benjamin. I mean that The Origin of German Tragic Drama , with its "mosaic" approach and its wonderful pro- logue about discourse and representation, stands almost alone. The shorter essays, which have taken most of the attention, desperately need critical revision. For instance, the "Little History of Photography" is full of wonderful intuitions, but then this excellent French journal, which I recommend to everybody, Etudes Photographiques , did a kind of edited translation of the text, showing how many mistakes there are, and how these are, of course, dependent on there having been many sources and works that Benjamin could not have seen. In other words, Benjamin was writing about photogra- phy from a situation that we are not in today. We know a lot more about photography. It doesn't mean we lose his in- sights, but there are certain points at which we have to bear that fact in mind. And I have a great problem with the essay that is probably best known, and has become absolutely, as Roland Barthes would have said, "doxa": "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction." What you were saying about the evolutionary view, the developmental view, is to a great extent inherent in that thesis. For instance, he recog- nizes that the invention of lithography was a crucial stage in the development of new visual technologies, but then he remarks that it was soon superseded - the German word lit- erally means "flown over" - by photography. Just as the Salon of 1863 was traditionally taken as the genesis of modernism, so photography is presented as the watershed, and the unique harbinger of a crisis in the relation between the original and the reproduction. Now, when I read this, I feel that it simply doesn't reckon with the complexity of what was taking place. In fact, the whole history of the "invention" of photography has been adapted to fit a simplistic evolutionary narrative. A saying, which was never actually said in my view, is attributed to the painter Paul Delaroche: "From today, painting is dead." Not only does Delaroche, as far as I can tell, certainly not say anything like that, it's actually first reported in a rabidly nationalistic work published long after his death in the 1870s. I can find no trace of it in earlier literature. In fact, Dela- roche, who nurtured in his studio some of the m¿yor photog- raphers of the age, like Gustave Le Gray, Charles Nègre, and Henri Le Secq, produced a very judicious report on how photography could help painters, and indeed, he is now known to have visited Daguerre' s studio as early as the au- tumn of 1838. So the way in which, in his history of photog- raphy, Helmut Gernsheim associates the supposed remark with the meeting of the two Academies of Sciences and Fine Arts in Paris on August 19, 1839, is completely implausible. What I would conclude, in the case of Benjamin's view of the print culture of the nineteenth century, is that it is essentially the view of an extremely cultivated and sensitive connoisseur of the 1920s. When he refers to an unnamed artist as being the best-known engraver of his time, in the essay "Unpacking My Library," we can now see who it is that he means, but we also have to conclude that this person probably wasn't the "best-known engraver" of his time by any contemporary standard! That's a misconception that has come about as a result of the steep decline in the interest in reproductive engraving, which Benjamin and many other people of his generation saw as being a totally doomed endeavor throughout the nineteenth century. I think that the restocking of the gallery of forms of printmaking in the nineteenth century - not only in France, of course, but also elsewhere - and the investigation of the relation of the dif- ferent modes, one to another, in respect of the overall devel- opment of the market, the Salons, and the academies, is a task that is very overdue. In short, I think that not only Benjamin, but many people of that particular generation, such as Charles Ivins, should be seen to have constructed extremely powerful mythologies about visual culture in the nineteenth century that don't really stand up to close exam- ination. Lang: Yes, and you have certainly opened out our under- standing of the nineteenth century and of those essential spaces of reproductive technology. To get back to the doctri- nal "Work of Art" essay for just a moment, in my view, fear over the loss of aura pivots around fear over the object's ability to look back and, correspondingly, fear over the loss of humankind's ability to be affected by the work of art. So Benjamin is not simply expressing worry over the loss of painting's resonance in the advent of reproducibility, he is also exposing a deeper question in that essay: What happens to humanity in the face of the apparatus? That's what we still haven't tackled. This is why curiosity is so important - as a relation that enables things of the world to look back. What you have just said about powerful mythologies of visual culture that don't stand up to scrutiny puts me in mind of Roland Barthes. His humanity suffuses his writing, and his curiosity about the world - about how we construct the world, about how we perceive objects and press them into the ser- vice of mythologies - is there on the page. You encountered Barthes very early on and helped introduce him into the Anglophone world. Would you tell us about that experience and how it affected your thinking? Bann: I am glad you have mentioned Barthes. I think I must have been the first person to translate an essay of his into English. This was "The Activity of Structuralism," originally</page><page sequence="9">552 ART bulletin December 2013 volume xcv number 4 published in 1963, which we placed in the first issue of the Cambridge-based magazine Form , in 1966. Later, I published a review in the Times Literary Supplement of his La chambre claire , the great work on photography that was published just a few days before his tragic death. I had already received his permission to translate the essay "The Discourse of History," and this was to appear in the 1981 issue of the Comparative Criticism yearbook on "Rhetoric and History" - -just next to my own essay "The Historian as Taxidermist," which became the first chapter of The Clothing of Clio. In other words, Barthes had a tremendous influence on my thinking, and somehow this doesn't diminish.11 On recently writing about Ian Ham- ilton Finlay's first garden constructions, I thought about a significant passage from the 1963 Barthes essay that John Dixon Hunt, as well as I myself, had quoted in relation to Finlay's view of the ancient world. Going back to our corre- spondence in the 1960s, I verified the fact that we were indeed discussing that essay at the time. The concluding phrase in the essay "The Discourse of History" - that "the sign of His- tory from now is no longer the real, but the intelligible" - has always haunted me. On occasion, I have thought of it as a Utopian statement, but I feel I am now coming back to it again. The other aspect of Barthes that I value enormously is his avoidance of "doxa." The word has already come up here, and it surely epitomizes the quest that drove him into so many different areas of study. We may not always be able to follow him there, but it is the quest that counts . . . Lang: There's so much we could discuss. But let's go back to Nietzsche now and to the antiquarian, because the antiquar- ian has been a central figure for you, in terms both of recuperating what the antiquarian meant in a full sense and that wonderful image in Nietzsche's essay "The Use and Abuse of History," where he likens the antiquarian to a tree rooted deeply in the ground. Nietzsche implies that the antiquarian's familiarity with and love of objects that have come down from the past and from tradition provide a being at home in the world. When he moves to the description of critical history, he says that critical history is important be- cause the antiquarian's love of the past can make him lose sight of the present. Yet Nietzsche cautions: critical history presents a dangerous proposition when carried too far - as he says, critical history can deracinate the past, can cut off the past at its roots. As someone who appears to think about the present as the way through to an understanding of the past, you clearly do not want to cut off the past at its roots, even though you are using that critical form of history. I wonder if you would talk about this? Bann: Yes, it reminds of me of what an old friend, Wolfgang Ernst, said about me. He is now professor of media studies of the Humboldt University in Berlin, but when I first knew him, he was a young German student. In fact, I always remember the very day he came to see me in Canterbury because a large building nearby burned down that evening. So it's a coinci- dence that I can tease him with. He described me in a recent essay as a media-critical antiquarian. It probably sounds bet- ter in German, but there it is: a media-critical antiquarian. I think that that really is the issue, because "antiquarian" here has connotations of the Foucauldian "archaeologist," some- one who digs up discourse rather than digging up objects. Media-critical - here media means, of course, a much broader kind of arena than would be covered by any one particular province of the visual arts, and certainly the element of "criticism" is fundamental. One of the things that influenced me most in this direction in the 1970s was coming across the work of Hayden White. I mean, after I had written this article about a "cycle in histor- ical discourse," I thought to myself, well, this cycle, will it run? Will anybody be interested in the work I am doing? People like the anthropologists Sir Edmund Leach and Caroline Humphrey were very kind about that particular essay, and about the issue of 20th Century Studies where it was published in 1970. But it wasn't obvious that anybody in the history of art, or indeed, history, was interested as well. I spent quite a long period actually, wondering where I should turn my attention. The first article that I submitted to Art History was returned to me by the editor, John Onians, who said some- thing like: try to imagine what your worst enemy would think if they were reading this essay! That was rather an interesting response. I commend it to other editors. But Hayden White published Metahistory in 1973, and soon afterward he invited me to the Center for the Humanities, which he was directing at Wesleyan. Through him, I met other American scholars who were interested in the critical analysis of historiography, such as Lionel Gossman and Natalie Zemon Davis at Prince- ton, and I began to publish in a journal that has been hospitable to me ever since, Wesleyan' s History and Theory. Hayden White helped me to develop my work on museums in particular. After an opportunity to test the ideas at Wes- leyan and Princeton, I published a comparative study of two French museums in History and Theory in 1978 - which has since been translated into most mayor languages, though never into French!12 I then began to think about how a "cycle" of discourses would proceed through different stages and became interested in the application of White's concept of irony. What you can't ignore in early nineteenth-century British culture is the fact that, by the midcentury, people were actually being ironic about - or, if you like, taking the piss out of - antiquarianism. When Horace Walpole's collection was put up for sale in the 1830s, there was a great catalog with drawings by John Leech on the cover, and people were invited to make fun of the absurdity of the objects. Indeed, this cycle ending in irony seems to run indefinitely. I later reformulated my ideas on various museums and museum forms and wrote about the idea of the "ironic museum." What I wrote first appeared in Germany, where people were quite interested in the idea of the ironic museum as being one in which this relativization of the antiquarian and the monu- mental by the critical should be made evident.13 We cannot, so to speak, plunge back naively into an antiquarian phase, and yet the tree must remain rooted. So it's a sort of balanc- ing act. I think that the museum is a very good terrain in which to observe how that can be achieved, in terms of display and ways of exhibiting. The museum is a place where we place on record, like a fly in amber, our habits of viewing and understanding the past, and these need, of course, to be constantly reviewed in the design and creation of new muse- ums.</page><page sequence="10">INTERVIEW: BANN IN CONVERSATION WITH LANG 553 5 Dessert plate with transfer design, Vieillard Factory, Bordeaux, ca. 1863 (artwork in the public domain) Lang: On that note, we could turn to something that also comes through in your writing, namely, that you travel deeply into a context and inevitably upset received ideas about it. But then, it happens that in thinking about objects in relation to history (which, of course, is what we, as art historians, are meant to do, to put objects into history) , the object does look back at you. I mean, I feel that in your writing you come to know a given context so well and the object so well that contexts and objects ask questions that, as a historian and art historian, you seek to answer in a historically sensitive way. Bann: I hope so, but the notion of context often has to be stretched. Let me give you two examples. Long ago, I had to deal with probably the most frequently repeated dictum, which has become a kind of sacred text relating to the origins of modern historiography. This is Leopold von Ranke' s state- ment that the historian must tell things "as it really happened [wie es eigentlich gewesen]" And I thought, now how can we begin to understand this? Of course, it is in part a question of translating from the German, and that term "really" has to be deconstructed accordingly. But what I envisaged as a context for Ranke 's aspiration was the experimental taxidermy of a Yorkshire squire called Charles Waterton. Waterton didn't stuff animals in the way they had previously been stuffed. Before this, people just stuffed the carcass with the bones in place, and then the skeleton became distorted, and the skin pulled against the bones; it ended up as an awful mess. Waterton actually took all the bones out, soaked the carcass in corrosive sublimate, which he also used to keep his top hat rigid, and then he would mold it from the inside so that it formed a stable and perfectly lifelike specimen. This was, of course, the epoch of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. So it seemed to me that that notion of the wish for lifelike representation and the artful technique to achieve it were points in common between the Catholic squire and the descendant of Protestant pastors. That's one example of context. The other is perhaps a rather playful example, but I think it's not irrelevant. Thinking about modernism, and its ad- vent: 1862 and 1863. What changes in 1863? I mean, obvi- ously, there is Manet's Déjeuner sur l'herbe at the Salon des Refusés, you know all about that. And effectively we focus on that, don't we? Indeed, we're right to. It's a fantastic painting, fresh as the day it was painted, and so on. Well, I found in a Bordeaux antique shop a dessert plate that showed two ladies in a park, confronting one another (Fig. 5). The caption included the dates 1862 and 1863. One lady was wearing a voluminous crinoline, and the other was wearing just a sort of straight-down dress and a floppy kind of hat. Of the two accompanying gentlemen, one was all buttoned up with a smart top hat, and the other wore a baggy coat, and so on. It seemed to me this was very interesting because, after all, they weren't aware that modernism was beginning in 1863. On the other hand, something was changing, and it was associated with the styles of dress and the leisure activities of people as they were depicted on this plate. The second lady with her escort and the dress that slips off so easily could easily have migrated to the Dejeuner. So the question of context could, in a sense, send you mad, but there are always parallel events, or chance discoveries that provide context. You just have to find them by chance, by luck, and be observant when you find them. Lang: What you've just said shows that what seems to be far away may actually be of central significance. Well, maybe the last question would have you talk a bit about poetics. In addition to curiosity and the playful, I see poetics moving through your writing. What I have in mind is an idea of poetics as a kind of forming and shaping. Again, resisting</page><page sequence="11">554 ART bulletin December 2013 volume xcv number 4 6 Cover of The Clothing of Clio: A Study of the Representation of History in Nineteenth-Century Britain and France , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984 received ideas or definitions and being aware, 21s a historian, of shaping an account by bringing things in that haven't been used before and by the writing of history itself as a poetics, as the shaping of an account. Bann: Well, that brings a lot of things together. It certainly does. I suppose I was very attracted to the idea of poetics from the early 1970s onward. Partly because one of the first articles I published in French was for the new journal Poétique , which was founded at that time, very much under the auspices of Barthes. He provided a splendid short article to head the first issue: "Où commencer?" - "How do you start to do poetics?" The editors were Gérard Genette and Tzvetan Todorov, both of whom I had been in contact with. So I was very pleased to be associated with this venture. I called the 1976 collection that I have already mentioned "Visual Poetics." And when I brought together the early writings on historical representa- tion in The Clothing of Clio , I stated in my introduction that the aspiration was to achieve a "historical poetics" (Figs. 6, 7). Now, the reason for choosing "poetics" as the term was partly because it was in the wind at that point. It was a way of not having to talk about rhetoric, because rhetoric, or indeed, the whole concept of figurative language, was bound up with the notion of a departure from the norm, or what might be dismissed as ornament. In other words, there was the idea you were dressing up the material. The traditional posture of rhetoric is to speak well, in order to persuade people of your case in the forum or from the podium. And clearly that connotation is not an appropriate one. But what I found fascinating at that point was that a pupil of Lévi-Strauss, the anthropologist Dan Sperber, was writing about the concept of a "cognitive rhetoric," which could indeed be called a poetics. The point being that these figures, whether you took them in the strict sense or the traditional sense, were not simply ways of departing from the ideal of a neutral language, which conveyed the meaning adequately and were in no need of a supplement. For Sperber, commu- nication depended upon the figures, and the figures repre- sented something that was not just an ornament but part of the mental process, and consequently of the process of com- munication. They were therefore integral to the reactions and the very possibility of reacting by an audience or a reader. So I suppose I still, for a similar reason, see the question of the use of language, the poetics of language, as being absolutely fundamental. I mean, in my case, it may come from having very, very far back - I mean as far back as I can remember, maybe further back - studied Latin. There's the factor of having that particular sort of training behind the language you use - having an early experience of organizing a language that is at the same time very different from, but also fundamentally akin to, the language you customarily speak. That, I think, can be a dominant factor in the way one writes, and indeed, not only in the way one writes but also the way one plans a book or an article in its various dimensions: from the paragraph and the chapter to the overall organiza- tion. All of these things come together, really, in the enter- prise of a poetics. I recall that when Peter Burke reviewed one of my books, he made the judgment that I was best as an essayist! Actually I think that was a misunderstanding. But I do undoubtedly attach a special value to the way in which a book comes together from its separate elements - call them chapters if you like. And, of course, I am very attentive to the quality and character of the illustrative images, as one can afford to be under the auspices of Yale University Press. My forthcoming book, entitled Distinguished Images , is proba- bly more "poetic" in this sense than any of my previous ones.14 But, of course, I am hoping it will also satisfy people who are curious about the print culture of nineteenth-cen- tury France. Lang: Poetics also has its ties with curiosity. Now we've run out of time, however, so we should probably stop there. Thank you, Stephen.
