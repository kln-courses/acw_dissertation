<plain_text><page sequence="1">Passing Through: The Later Poems New and Selected, by Stanley Kunitz. W.W. Norton. $18.95. This selection displays once again Stanley Kunitz's remark- able range and subtlety. Adding nine recent poems to work originally printed in The Testing Tree (1971), Next-to-Last Things (1985) and The Layers (which appeared in the acclaimed 1979 edition of his collected poetry), Kunitz passes from retrospective appraisals of personal tragedy ("My mother never forgave my father / for killing himself . . . that spring / when I was waiting to be born") to haunting meta- physical allegories, such as his anthropomorphic portrayal, in "King of the River," of a salmon almost consciously longing for metamorphosis and transcendence. Connecting many of these otherwise disparate poems are compelling themes of innocence and love - the loss of both, the search for both. Time and again the poet depicts himself, family members, acquaintances, even the Acropolis caryatids and the mummy of Ramses the Second (as in the ironic, erudite "Signs and Portents"), striving to recover states of purity or harmony. No poem summarizes this endeavor better than the mov- ing final one, "Touch Me," in which an aged narrator- Kunitz was born in 1905- kneels "to the crickets trilling / underfoot as if about / to burst from their crusty shells." "Like a child again," the poet marvels "to hear so clear / and brave a music pour / from such a small machine." And so absorbed does he remain in this ephemeral phenomenon- "The longing for the dance / stirs in the buried life. One sea- son only, / and it's done" - that eventually he must ask his beloved to "remind" him who he is. He is indeed a human being anchored, not in eternity, but rather in time. Yet hasn't his time-bounded wonder at the trilling somehow put him in touch with eternity? This finely-crafted poetry raises this question. The poet is at once grateful for having been allowed to witness one of life's miracles and acutely aware that such experiences exac- erbate the pain fostered by the knowledge of inescapable 291</page><page sequence="2">POETRY endings. In "The Knot," for example, he praises the undying desire of a resin-oozing, cross-grained knot, imprisoned in the lintel of his door, to sprout "shoots / that crackle over- head, / dividing as they grow." Yet his cry "Let be!" is ulti- mately ambiguous (and for this reason, poignant), for it is in poetry alone that a man can "shake [his] wings" and fly into the envisioned boughs. In "The Abduction," a psychologi- cally intricate poem about a woman's recurrent, ambivalent memory of being raped, Kunitz simply puts it this way: "What do we know / beyond the rapture and the dread?" He is by no means a despairing or an unconsolable poet, how- ever, even when evoking "a murderous time" in which "the heart breaks and breaks / and lives by breaking." In any dichotomy pitting the certainty of having felt something extraordinary against the uncertainty of what the feelings sig- nify, recollected rapture inevitably outbalances skepticism and gloom. In "The Round," for example, he tellingly depicts himself "sitting in semi-dark / hunched over my desk / with nothing for a view / to tempt me / but a bloated com- post heap"; yet in this downstairs "cell" he transforms into words the "curious gladness" that he had felt earlier that morning as "light splashed ... on the shell-pink anemones." The conclusion of this insightful poem about the poetic process bespeaks a characteristic, quiet optimism: "I can scarcely wait till tomorrow / when a new life begins for me, / as it does each day." The act of naming necessarily simplifies, indeed dimin- ishes, the sudden, overwhelming original perception, satu- rated with sense stimulators; such are the limitations of language. Yet written words can nevertheless reclaim a sem- blance of the enrapturing moment from oblivion. Such a "moment," Kunitz observes in his brief preface, "is dear to us, precisely because it is so fugitive, and it is somewhat of a paradox that poets should spend a lifetime hunting for the magic that will make the moment stay." Sometimes the enchanting or bewitching past moment embodies an endur- ing duty that must be passed on. Kunitz recalls, for instance, how his night-fears would be assuaged by his candle-bearing sisters; now that they have died, he can return the tenderness in a lullaby: "Let nothing grieve you, / Sarah and Sophia. / Shush, shush, my dears, / now and forever." Motivating these poems are multifarious falls from grace. Kunitz sometimes confesses to his own misdeeds or alludes to disruptive political events; he rarely rages, however, although 292</page><page sequence="3">JOHN TAYLOR occasionally he is sardonic. Instead, he summons his consid- erable delicacy of touch with regard to meter and discreet half-rhymes to explore his - our- "disgraced, mortal" pre- dicament. These portentous adjectives qualify the unlucky, beached, dying "Wellfleet whale," the subject of another magnificent allegory set halfway between human society and a pristine natural world. The descriptions are scientifically precise, yet they build into troubling metaphors suggesting that- at birth, as it were - human beings are also cast up on coastal rocks and "delivered to the mercy of time." We, too, await our "hour of desolation." Perhaps, like the stranded whale, we, too, have brought with us "the myth / of another country, dimly remembered." Kunitz is at his most masterful when he opens up, as if through the thick wall of the mate- rial world, peepholes looking out onto such vistas.</page></plain_text>
