<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEW SERMONS OF ST AUGUSTINE In 1990 there was published a catalogue of manuscripts in the city library at Mainz, and one codex (I. 9) particularly caught the eye of the distinguished French scholar Francois Dolbeau. It contained homilies ascribed to Augustine of Hippo. M. Dolbeau went to investigate and found a late fifteenth-century manuscript containing a homiliary written for the Carthusian house at Mainz about 1470-75. The collection included in total sixty-two ser mons, sixteen of them being inedita known, if at all, through fragmentary citations in Caesarius of Aries and Bede. Eight turned out to be fuller versions of homilies hitherto known only in trun cated forms, abbreviated by medieval scribes who needed some thing shorter for a lection. M. Dolbeau has published 'provisional' texts of all twenty-six sermons containing new matter, under pinned by highly erudite commentaries. He has shown that half of these came from a collection known to have existed at one time in the library of the Carolingian monastery at Lorsch, not far from Mainz. The catalogue of the Lorsch collection was printed in 1976 by the late Pere Patrick Verbraken in his indispensable instrument to guide the reader in the use of Augustine's sermons.1 The other half of the Mainz collection came from a Carthusian manuscript. The purpose of the present paper is to underline the importance of M. Dolbeau's discovery.2 Sermons are not likely to offer the scandal-interest associated with the letters discovered by Johannes Divjak, printed in CSEL 88 (1981) and discussed in a descriptive paper in JTS, ns 34 (1983), 425-452. Nevertheless, they contain at least a few dramas on a domestic scale and shed new light on Augustine's endeavours to convert educated pagans mainly in Africa Proconsularis. In his own Numidia the majority of Christians were Donatists, and the level of education cannot have been high. There, the principal missionary problem was either to detach the peasants (few of whom had any Latin)3 from the Donatist community, to which the intimidation of the circum cellions would securely cement them, or to emancipate them from dependence on astrologers and other forms of divination by which 1 P.

The account of the sermons which follows does not discuss the questions of dating, on which the introductions of M. Dolbeau offer masterly considerations. The intention of this paper is rather to survey in fairly general terms the content of the new sermons, and especially to bring out any matters which are in some degree distinctive in relation to Augustine's other works. The sermons vary considerably in length and weight. Some are quite short, others of substantial length. The sermon for the Kalends of January (M 62) is surprisingly long. From Tract, in ev.ev. Joh. 7.24 we know that Augustine liked to prolong a sermon on the day of a big pagan festival to deter his flock from being drawn into the festivities and their accompanying sideshows. In that sermon he expressed regret (7.2) that many women had not come to church. The festival was evidently a celebration of Cybele and Attis, since there is mention of a scourge (7.8) and of a lamb (7.6), and the well-known quotation from a priest of Cybele who claimed that Attis tenderly nursing his lamb was no different from the Christian good shepherd—ipse pilleatus Christianus est, the fellow with a Phrygian cap is Christian.4 On the Kalends of January the pagan custom was to exchange presents, to gamble, to drink a great deal, and to sing obscene songs. Since Tertullian's admonitions in De idololatria 14, puritan preachers had difficulty in discouraging believers from participating in the junketings. Not all the sermons have been perfectly transcribed by scribes or by their models, and in places the text is problematic. M. Dolbeau and his colleagues in Paris have made numerous acute emendations—and have left a number of cruces still to be considered.5 Some mistakes may go back to the shorthand writers who took the sermons down at the time of delivery. Probably they were able to derive some income out of selling copies to less eloquent bishops elsewhere in Numidia where the possession of 4 For a representation of Attis holding his lamb see jfTS, ns, 3 (1952), 90. There is a good discussion of Tract, injoh. 7 by J. Pepin in De la philosophic anc. a a la theol .patristique (Variorum, 1976), XIII 263 ff. 5 In Μ 54.6 (REAug 27, 1991, 276) line 184, where the question discussed is the familiar theme of the mind's superiority to the senses of which it is judge, the word sensus stands where one expects mens. Perhaps Augustine's phrase was sensus mentis, cf. Retr. i.1.2 est enim sensus et mentis.</page><page sequence="4">72 HENRY CHADWICK fluency in Latin was far from universal. Augustine (Ep. 84.2) expressly says that in Numidia the preaching of the gospel was much hindered by the widespread ignorance of Latin. From the Divjak letters (16 and 23A) we know that at Carthage also there was a demand for copies of his sermons, since one letter mentions a request from the primate, Aurelius of Carthage, for some ser mons which he could use. Augustine agreed, on the understanding that the source would be acknowledged.6 Those homilies were evidently to be prepared written texts in the form in which they reached Aurelius. But that was unusual. Augustine normally preached extempore, not from a carefully prepared written text which he had before him at the ambo.7 His sermons normally follow the manner of those homilists whose discourse is determined by their stream of consciousness as their mind circumambulates round the texts given by the proper lec tions, and who therefore do not have clear-cut and particular points to put to the congregation in the hope that at leisure they may recall what was said and meditate further thereon. His usual method is to expound the psalm, or epistle, or gospel, or, on the feast of a martyr, something taken from the Passio of the saint which has also been read.8 The readings of the lector were not always what he had asked for and, because he was accustomed to improvise, he still preached on what had actually been read even when the lector produced something wholly unexpected. In Μ 12. ι he remarks to the congregation that the choice of reading 'was not mine but the Lord's'. A well-known parallel occurs in the homily on Psalm 138: 1. For high festivals the lectionary was predictable and reliable. For baptisms it was common to have Psalms 41 (42) and 4—and it is surely not accidental that these psalms provide important citations in the Confessions. On the vigil of Pentecost the expected psalms were 117 and 140 (M 20-21) as in Sermo 29 in the Maurist edition. Μ 21 takes the text from Psalm 117 'Confitemini Domino ...' which, according to contra Adimantum 13, 4, was 'chanted in the Church every day', and uses it to explain that 6 De doctrina Christiana IV.29,62 allows the use of another's sermon as long as it is 'offered in the person of the author'. 7 Besides the classic book of Van der Meer, there is now a notable survey of Augustine the preacher in the great work by Alexandre Olivar, La Predicacion cristianacristiana antigua (Barcelona: Herder, 1991), 330-389, with many references to detailed studies. 8 Canon 47 of the third council of Carthage rules that the one exception to the exclusive reading of canonical scripture in church is the Passio of a martyr on the anniversary; also the Council of Hippo of 393, canon 5, p. 21, Munier.</page><page sequence="5">NEW SERMONS OF ST AUGUSTINE 73 confessio,confessio, commonly understood to mean the admission of faults, has the other meaning of praising God. Because his usual procedure was to improvise, he could not avoid repeating himself, even if he had wished to do so. Once (S. 125. ι) he defends repetition in sermons as being like familiar Bible stories, which serve to remind the congregation of valued truths. In consequence a fairly high proportion of the content of the newly found sermons can be located in homilies already in print, and this, of course, helps to settle any arguments about authenticity. The hands and the voice are familiar. The normal pattern is a combination of expounding the lections read, laced with some doctrinal point which seldom receives more than a single paragraph, and then some direct and fervent exhortation. Those of the congregation who liked what Augustine said were impassioned in their admiration, and some came along merely to see this great sight: 'Do not suppose that I stand here for you to gaze at (ad spectaculum)' (M 12.16); 'Some come here merely on my account' (55.1). In at least one north African church, whether beside or (less likely) instead of the lections from scripture, either the lector or the bishop had started reading passages from the writings of Augustine, thereby giving the impression to his people that the works of the wise bishop of Hippo virtually ranked as edification alongside the biblical canon (M 27.15). Similar pas sages disowning authority appear in a number of Augustine's works, normally in the form that he makes no claim to be achieving more than progress in understanding (e.g. Tract, in ev. Joh. 53.7, or Ep. 143.2 to Marcellinus, or the striking text in Conf. XII.25,34 that God's truth is shared by all believers and is never the property of one individual). To elevate his writings to the status of canonical scripture was, he felt, bringing down to the merely human level a Bible in which, by God's grace, there was nothing untrue or mendacious to lead one astray (48.3). Most of the Mainz sermons belong to the period between his consecration as bishop of Hippo in 395 and the year 410. One sermon (M 51) touches on the doctrine of grace, and might belong to the early stages of the great debate on that issue. But since that question was already raised in the Questions for Simplicianus of Milan and in several places in the Confessions, there is no imperat ive necessity to put this sermon late. The sermon has the special interest of offering the earliest text to distinguish between credere Deo,Deo, credere Deum, and credere in Deum, where the last of this triad means to love Christ and to be incorporated in him, not merely to believe him to teach truth or to be predicted by the prophets. If Christ had been no more than human, he could never</page><page sequence="6">74 HENRY CHADWICK have imparted justification to us, but would be with us in needing it. In becoming human he remained what he was, so that in him we have both our way and our destination (et qua iremus et quo veniremus).veniremus). And if he is in us, then the bread which he gives is not distasteful but a delight and a source of strength. Salvation is deification (13.1).9 The sermon preached on the following Sunday (M 52) betrays that some of the congregation, which was noted as being numer ous, found the discourse on faith and justification burdensome to follow (molesta quaestio) (51.10, line 228). '1 preached as I did because of those who think it sufficient to believe but then live evil lives.' As we should expect there are a few attacks on Manichees, either for their denial that the Old Testament has any significance for Christianity (42.6) or for their belief that Christ's human body was not real, and that he was not really crucified—the cross being a symbolic myth (54.12). But insofar as the Mainz collection can be taken as representative of their situation, Manicheism seems not to have been any serious threat in the churches where they were delivered. It was otherwise with Donatism. Several of the sermons contain attacks on Donatists combined with pleas to them to show charity and restore unity with the Catholica. Two of the sermons (M 9.3 and 62.45) refer to the occasion, known from the Enchiridion (v. 17) and from Possidius (Vita 12), when the circumcellions set an ambush intended to silence Augustine for ever and stop his evidently influential attacks, and providentially the guide took him by the wrong road so that he escaped their murderous intentions. Like Pope Symmachus at the end of the fifth century, after he had escaped unhurt from a rain of hostile stones hurled by the supporters of the rival candidate for the papacy, Laurentius,10 Augustine understood his escape as a divine act of deliverance, vindicating both his work and his theme of the unicity of the Church Catholic. Augustine did not believe in chance in this or any other matter. The collection contains the familiar gravamen of complaints against the Donatist puritan separatists. They are deficient in tolerantiatolerantia (M 45.7). When receiving converts from the Catholic Church, they repeat the holy sacrament of baptism; yet they do 9 On this frequent theme see Gerald Bonner, 'Augustine's Conception of Deification',Deification', jfTS, NS, 37 (1986), 369-386. 10 Symmachus, Ep. 10.7 p. 702, Thiel; critical edition by E.

Μ 7, a sermon for the Nativity of John the Baptist on 24 June, inveighs against the Donatist under standing of baptism, and has an ironic reference to their thug bishop—a kind of mafioso 'godfather'—Optatus of Thamugadi, who had actually been dead for about nine years but long remained a valued weapon in Augustine's arsenal.11 The same sermon, Μ 7, ends with a significant warning to the Catholic congregation, which evidently included a number of native Punic speakers (7.7), that drunkards would be excluded from heaven no less than heretics. Every time a Donatist lector reads from the Bible in their liturgy, the schism stands refuted; for the Bible foretells a univer sal worldwide church, not one confined to Africa. (How providen tial it was for Augustine's argument that Donatism did not spread beyond Africa and a handful of expatriate African congregations in Spain or in Rome.) God's promise to Abraham was that all nations would be blessed. Therefore the real tussle with the Donatists is not about what did or did not happen at Carthage when Caecilian was consecrated bishop to the anger of the Lady Lucilla and the Numidian episcopate: Non quaeramus antiqua quae gestagesta sunt (M 60.4).12 Admittedly Augustine found it necessary to undertake scrupulous investigation of municipal archives to dis cover the documents of the time. But the authoritative records which prove Donatists schismatic—and schism persisted in passes into heresy13 (incipiente malo schismatum quae postea errore hominum confirmataconfirmata sunt) (M 61.4)—are not in the files at public offices but in the scriptures. A passage at the end of the long sermon for the Kalends of January (M 62.52) restates the objection to the Donatist bishop of Carthage, Parmenian, that according to his ecclesiology the bishop is an indispensable mediator between God and the laity— a doctrine which in his reply to Parmenian's letter he denounced as 'the voice of Antichrist, intolerable to Christian ears'.14 The same sermon contains what might well be an implied attack on a saying of Petilian, Donatist bishop of Cirta, that while the clergy 11 In view of Augustine's express statements that Optatus had some association with the rebellion of Gildo (c. litt. Petil. ii.83, 184; c. Crescon. iv.27, 34), I believe some of Professor Frend's suggestions on this deserve more sympathy than they have received. 12 Similarly En. in Ps. 57.7; c. litt.

II. 105, 240-241). Augustine often asks the laity for their prayers. The sustained campaign against Donatism, in which Augustine took a prominent role, lies in the background of Μ 5, a sermon rebuking the congregation at Carthage assembled on 23 January, the day after a well-attended celebration of the Spanish martyr St Vincent of Zaragoza, martyred at Valencia.15 Augustine and Prudentius both possessed a grisly narrative of the inhuman tor tures to which he was successively subjected, and perhaps fascina tion with the gruesome, gory details contributed to the popularity of the feast which was widely celebrated beyond Spain, at least in the West. A few months previously, during the autumn, Augustine had been preaching in Carthage on four successive days to state the Catholic case for unity. Presumably at that time all passed off peacefully. But in January, on St Vincent's day, disorder erupted. When preaching against Donatism in the autumn Augustine had delivered his discourses standing by the altar, but for St Vincent's homily he went to the foot of the apse. Midwinter journeys were not good for Augustine's health (he has a pointed reference to very cold winds). All probability favours the view that his voice was particularly weak.16 A crowd of women surged forward to hear him better, and some seem to have asked him to move to the altar further down the body of the basilica. Impatient members of the congregation began to shout that it was time for the catechu mens to be sent away: Missa fac, missa, missa fac (5.20). Augustine had abandoned any serious attempt to be heard. Perhaps he failed to communicate at this point with the primate Aurelius. At any rate, rumour immediately began to circulate that between him and the primate there was tension over the affair. So at a church service on the day after St Vincent's day he explained how wrong this rumour was. That he had come to Carthage at all in midwinter was explicable only by the mutual affection between Aurelius and himself. Strictly he ought to have been attending the provincial synod of Numidia summoned by the old Numidian primate, Xanthippus of Thagora, to meet at Constantine, where the bishop Fortunatus was an old friend, a former presbyter at Thagaste. But Aurelius' invitation had pressed him with such warm declarations of regard that he had agreed to 15 V. Saxer, 'La Passion de S. Vincent diacre dans la premiere moitie du Ve siecle', Revue des etudes augustiniennes 25 (1989), 275-97. 16 On Augustine's dread of winter travelling cf. Ep. 124.1; ep.

And now his discourse must be on obedience. He tactfully praised the people for their good following of their bishop, and singled out for approval the prudence of Aurelius, who had acted to protect the women from loutish jostling and lecherous whistles by appointing different entrances for the two sexes and then segregating them in the basilica. In Roman theatres the sexes were often segregated as they were not in the amphitheatre.17 But in the church the people were not to behave like audiences at the theatre. (It is safe to deduce that a Carthaginian theatre audience was noisy, and no doubt included many of the eversores, the Wreckers, who were among the students mentioned in the Confessions Confessions as disrupting Augustine's classes.)18 The sermon for Peter and Paul on 29 June (M 9) is the complete form of a homily first printed by Mai, but only in a truncated version (S. Mai 19, Morin p. 307 = PLS II. 462). It contains one of the two references in the Mainz collection to the unsuccessful circumcellion ambush designed to silence Augustine. It appears from this full form of the sermon that after his escape some considerable time elapsed during which Augustine preached no anti-Donatist discourses. Unkind gossip said that he had been scared into keeping his mouth shut. The sermon for the glorious apostolic martyrs replies that he would have been only too willing to join the company of those who had been the seed of the church's mission (9.7). The sermon goes on to encourage his congregation by speaking of the beneficent imperial legislation which was now enforcing the concealment of images of the old gods of polytheism (9.8, cf. 60.8), and by referring to the mixture of Babylon and Jerusalem in this world. As one would expect, Augustine's anti-Donatist polemic is insistent that there is, and can be, only one Catholic Church. Some people seem to have been arguing that because the apostle Paul wrote epistles to several churches there could be more than one body so entitled. In reply Augustine contends that, if one counts the region of Galatia as a single church, Paul's letters to churches add up to the symbolic number of seven, which signifies completeness (62.51). Again he is emphatic that the one church is symbolized by the seamless robe of the Lord. He concedes that there may be other garments of Jesus symbolic of more fissiparous and independent bodies, but at least these bodies cannot be called 17 The main texts are Suetonius, Augustus 43 f. and Ovid, Tristia 2.280 ff.; the best discussion is by Elizabeth Rawson in Papers of the British School at Rome 5 5 (1987), 83-113. 18 Conf. V.8, 14.</page><page sequence="10">78 HENRY CHADWICK the church (54.18). The Catholica is the whole, never merely a part of some larger grouping (54.17), and Christ is the head of this body, so that with the church he and his people are the totus Christus.Christus. The sermon on Psalm 21 (M 55) states a principle of biblical exegesis that one must distinguish statements referring to Christ as God, statements referring to him in his incarnate state as man, and those which speak of him as head of the church. This distinc tion is inherited from the first of the seven rules of Tyconius. The discussion is then embroidered with an allegory of esoteric improbability interpreting the rods with which Jacob increased his flock. The passage on the incarnation answers a difficulty: how could the Word be with God and also in the Virgin's womb? The reply is that the question presupposes that God, who is incorpor eal, can be divided into different pieces. The omnipresent Word is no more divided than a human word (totum ubique) (55.8, line 208). 'When I am speaking, it is not the case that one person hears one word, another person a different word. The entire sentence reaches everyone listening.' Or take the example of Iustitia,Iustitia, found in both East and West. It has no difficulty in being in two places at once.19 Augustine's discourse apparently puzzled some of his hearers, since he had to ask them to stop talking to each other and to listen to him (55.9). They may have been baffled by his juxtaposition (55.7) of an affirmation of the Trinity with the admission that 'if we little people (parvuli) wish to say anything worthy of God, we should say nothing at all'.20 Some of the questions remind him of issues raised in the Arian controversy which were 'disturbing to the weak but conquered by the catholic faith' (55.12). Yet the old questions are not yet dead, the old serpent is still whispering, and trying to eject the church from paradise by the promise of a certain scientia. There is still trouble with the Johannine text 'The Father is greater than I', but all difficulty is removed by the exegetical rule that references to the inferiority of the Son are to his incarnate state as man. Again it is an exegetical principle that whatever in scripture sounds absurd or superfluous has hidden meaning, discoverable 19 Μ 59-7 has an attack on the notion that justice is merely social convention. 20 This reverent agnosticism is not infrequent in Augustine; e.g. Conf. XIII. 11,12 11,12 (of the Trinity) rara anima quaecumque de ilia loquitur scit quod loquitur. De ordineordine ii.44 Deus qui scitur melius nesciendo (cf. Porphyry, Sententiae 25). c.c.

People despise 'They two shall be in one flesh', and ask if God cares about sexual intercourse. It suggests, they say, that Moses had a mediocre mind (55.22). The Bible resembles a nut hard to crack, but with a delicious kernel once one has penetrated to the heart of its meaning. So the allegorical meaning of Jacob's rods in Gen. 30: 37-38 is presented with the evident motive of illustrating the way in which a most unlikely story can symbolize the incarnation and redemption by Christ. Jacob is a figure of Christ. He chooses three different kinds of wood22—a nut tree signifies the incarnation and the cross, for as the husk is the medium through which the kernel is avail able, so Christ does not feed us (reading pasceret for the MS portaret)portaret) unless we come to his body through the wood of the cross. The perfumed storax or gum tree signifies the inviolate virginity of Mary. The plane tree means the Holy Spirit, 'but it would be more difficult to show how'. The answer is its very broad shade protecting people resting from the heat, suitably symbolizing Mary conceiving Jesus not in the heat of sexual desire but in the coolness of faithful chastity and uncorrupted virginity by the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit. The variety of offspring refers to the Gentile converts after the Jewish doctors of the law, who discerned something of the mystery of Christ but failed to enter in themselves. The illustration of the hard nut is presented as likely to evoke a smile (ut aliquid hilariter dicamus). The sermon had become something of a lecture on principles of interpretation, and needed a light touch. The conclusion reflects that any profit from this homily has its criterion in the congregation's good works, and they can show this by fasting during pagan festivals and praying not only for pagan worshippers but in particular for some Christian brethren who on the previous day took part in a heathen celebration. An early witness to Μ 55 is found in a florilegium contained in the Verona codex LIX (57) of the late sixth or early seventh century. The fragment of 55 there quoted has a rubric, and the text was printed by Morin in the appendix to his supplement to the Maurist sermons (Miscellanea Agastiniana I, 1931). The rubric says: Item eiusdem beatissimi ex tractatu de tribus modis in deum Christum Christum dictum in Basilica Restituta dixit pridie idus decembris. That is to say, the sermon was preached on 12 December at On this principle see De utilitate credendi 7, 17; En. in Ps. 77.26; 118.31.5.

Early in December was a normal time for muneramunera—shows at the circus and the amphitheatre. The Mainz sermons contain more than one defensive reference to the tempta tion which these riveting entertainments constituted. The year is more delicate to determine. Μ 55 refers to a visit to Rome by the emperor Honorius shortly beforehand, temporibus nostris. He might have visited the great imperial tomb of proud Hadrian, but he went instead to the sepulchre of the fisherman to ask for his intercession with the Lord, such as no proud emperor would be able to obtain (55.4). M. Dolbeau argues persuasively that Μ 55 cannot have been preached before December 405, but could be assigned to later years, with the proviso that times are excluded when Augustine is known to have been elsewhere than Carthage. It is intriguing to note that Μ 55.19 appears to provide the text otherwise unidentified to which Alcuin refers, Contra haeresim FelicisFelicis 72. Two themes appear to be recurrent. The first is that true religion is inward and a matter of the heart—outward acts are secondary and a means to a spiritual end; Christian custom is to turn east for prayer, but the movement of the heart to God is the important thing (M 5.12). Of the fans excited at the races, or of a man madly in love, people say 'he is beside himself' (non est secum).secum). There is analogy to the love of God. When you begin to love God, you are also loving your self. Loving God has no limit but is sine modo. If you loved the shows with wild beasts on a dies muneris,muneris, you would rise early and rouse your neighbour to come to the amphitheatre, for which he may even be grateful to you that you molested him. That is the kind of passion that Augustine would like to see for God. 'Love the source of your love and you are loving God.' The question is put, how can one reconcile the two commandments of Matt. 22: 37-40 with the one command ment of Rom. 13: 9? The answer is that after you have understood the two, one is then enough. The faith which seeks to keep the law is a form of love. Forgiven for our sins in baptism, we are never weary of our 'bread' and know that nothing imparts satisfac tion except God (M 40). Accordingly, 'everyone prays truly when the prayer is inward' (62.14). 'My sounds reach your ears, and if good results, that is only because deus intus agit' (62.27). 'You wish to be happy, but then look in the wrong place, not seeking idipsum, the unchanging' (M 46-47). May the Son of God, God's Word, be present to your hearts, intus vobiscum (M 7.6). A second prominent theme is that true faith will issue in a</page><page sequence="13">NEW SERMONS OF ST AUGUSTINE 81 reformed moral life. Many Christians think it enough to have faith but then live unregenerate lives. They believe but produce no good works (M 51—52). Augustine was painfully aware of the problems of marital infidelity among his people. Tolerating an unfaithful husband is a mark of the noble and chaste wife (41.6). The Lord foretold scandals, and some of these are found within the church itself (12.6). Augustine had his share of scandals, as the letters first printed by Divjak richly illustrated. The morale of his clergy and people had been disturbed by the homoerotic affair between the presbyter, Boniface, and Spes, the monk in Augustine's monastery (Ep. 78), leading Augustine to remark that when a lay person is involved in sexual scandal, it is no nine days' wonder, but when a charge is laid against those who profess a holy name, it immediately becomes a matter for general gossip, and people guess that it is true of all the clergy. Rich Christians were made anxious by some gospel sayings, and needed reassurance that if they used their wealth rightly, they could be saved. They were reminded that in all their fine clothes they were merely human, of the stock of Adam and Eve, and when naked they had no marks for ostentation (12.12). So also, when it is their duty to punish a delinquent slave, let them remem ber divine mercy, and be sure that in the inflicting of discipline there is no touch of cruelty and hatred. It is a principle that such a slave should not be punished more harshly than a naughty son (54.4). Μ 54.5 illustrates the three orders of God, soul, and body by the analogy of a master, his slave, and, in third position, the slave of the slave—the slave-owning slave being called peculiosus, i.e. he manages money or property virtually as his own, though incapable of legal ownership, this money being a peculium. The moral standard asked of believers, especially but not only in sexual matters, deterred many catechumens from giving in their names for baptism (M 44). They preferred to guide their life by consulting their favourite astrologer (44.7). Indeed Augustine knew some who would turn to their astrologer for a decision whether or not it was a good day for becoming a Christian (61.27). That a fidelis was expected to give up such sources of guidance was a hurdle too high for many. Augustine warned the catechu mens that by providence the day of their death was unknown, and Μ 44 pleads with them to come forward for baptism. Μ 63, which is not strictly a homily but a case in canon law, rules against allowing the burial among the baptized faithful of the child of well-to-do parents, who had been enrolled as no more than a catechumen. There were evidently tears over this question. In the Confessions (II.3,8) Monnica herself is described as a worldly</page><page sequence="14">82 HENRY CHADWICK Christian still living in the suburbs of Babylon. That description could have been applied to numerous members of north African churches. Believers came to the church in quest of happiness, and supposed this would mean temporal goods and success in their career. Eternal things were not on their horizon. Augustine was concerned to encourage private Bible study— which presupposes a degree of literacy in his congregation. Biblical codices were openly for sale in the shops (12.14; 62.20; cf. En. in Ps.Ps. 66.10). But this book was never less than puzzling. The pre cepts of the Old Testament law appeared like an impenetrable jungle, though thankfully Christ had reduced everything to a single brief command (40.2). Inquiring and thoughtful believers found it difficult to accept biblical language about hell and the end of the world (12.3).23 The appeal to fear as a motive for conversion needed some explanatory unction (51.5). People thought it an apostolic confession of failure when in Rom. 11: 33 the apostle frankly abandoned the attempt to give a rational explanation of the mystery of election. Augustine agreed that the matter was incapable of reasoned exposition: '1 do not explain the inexplicable, but I commend what the apostle says' (54.1). Some remained puzzled by the difference between the Old and New Testaments. They should remember that just as a physician may prescribe one medicine at one stage of a sickness and another as the patient's condition changes, so too God's precepts can differ at different ages (42.6; S. 82.10; Conf. III.7,13). The Epiphany sermon (M 59), of which S. 374 is a medieval recension, faces the question whether, since miracles do not occur now, biblical miracles occurred. Augustine resorts to the classical contention, familiar since Justin Martyr, that the miraculous events are vindicated by the prophecies which they fulfil—an argument as useful for convincing pagans as for internal queries in the congregation. The defence of Christianity before educated pagan criticism was important if inquiring members of the congregation were not to be unsettled. Porphyry had criticized the Apostle Paul for inconsistency, professed in his programme of being a Jew to Jews and a Gentile to Gentiles, in circumcizing Timothy and yet denouncing Peter for observing Jewish customs at Antioch. The dissension at Antioch was taken out of that kind of debate by Jerome's explanation that the apostles were playacting, a solution 23 Disbelief in Hell: 5. Frangip. 2.9, p. 200, Morin; S. Guelf. 30.4, p. 555; De civ.civ. Dei 20.30. Pelagius on Rom. 11: 8, p. 87, Souter, deplores doubters. The theme was a target for much pagan mockery.</page><page sequence="15">NEW SERMONS OF ST AUGUSTINE 83 which notoriously offended Augustine by undermining apostolic veracity. The conduct of St Peter at Antioch was embarrassingly appealed to by those who argued that there are situations and circumstances where a lie can be proper and honourable. In De Mendacio 43 of 395, his last work written while still presbyter, this issue is mentioned as delicate to determine. At least in that work he felt confident that in the cause of religious truth no lie can ever be justified (ibid. 17), and the Pauline programme of being all things to all men is expressly defended as meaning sympathetic understanding rather than unprincipled mendacity (ibid. 42). In Μ 2ל Augustine feels a need to answer those whose reading of Galatians 2 leads them to assume that St Peter was in the wrong. He observes that negative criticism is always an easy thing, and Peter merits credit for taking Paul's criticism so well. 'Never have I seen a person bearing criticism with equanimity' (27.3). (He was no doubt self-conscious of his own inability in that respect, with his admitted weakness for self-justification.24) A judicious estimate would say that in practice Peter was right that ethnic Jews becom ing believers in Jesus as Messiah are perfectly entitled to continue keeping Mosaic customs, even if one cannot say it is an obligation. Augustine's defence of Peter sounds like the kind of reply that would have made much sense early in the second century, but would have surprised his congregation early in the fifth. A differ ent impression would be derived from De utilitate credendi 9 or Ep.Ep. 82.15 or De baptismo 11.1,2. In Μ 27 it is explicit that some in the congregation are being unsettled by external critics sniping at Paul for lack of integrity— admittedly a charge brought against the apostle in his lifetime. Augustine has to deal with the issue 'not merely for your sake but also for those who hear both me and you' (27.5). And then there was a related question about apostolic integrity raised by the famous chapter on celibacy and marriage in 1 Corinthians 7, discussed in Μ 41. In this chapter, so Augustine says with perhaps a quiver of apprehension, Paul as a holy man ventures to enter bedrooms to tell married couples what they may do. But was he consistent to say that marriage is no sin when he had also declared that sexual intercourse within the marriage relation is a matter for pardon, venia? Did not the latter statement imply something to be forgiven, some pollution therefore contracted by the act? The answer has to be that what needs pardon is conjugal intercourse going beyond the intention of procreation. But how very venial Conf. X.37, 61.</page><page sequence="16">84 HENRY CHADWICK that may be is shown by Augustine's belief that it is a fault included in the daily forgiveness granted in answer to the Paternoster. The question would always have a rather sharp point for Augustine who was bound to affirm against Manichees the essen tial goodness of the divinely implanted procreative impulse, but against the Pelagians asserted that in concupiscence there was a link between sexuality (uncontrolled by reason) and sin. His con viction that sexual intercourse is 'natural' when the act is for procreation was a proposition common to Plato (Laws 839a, 841d) and Stoics such as Musonius Rufus, and was explicit in the Emperor Julian (153b, 359c). Moral pressures towards ascetic renunciation could hardly be resisted by a man dedicated to the establishment of monasteries among the African churches. But in Μ 41 he is insistent that no married person may make a unilateral decision to withhold con jugal relations. Experience showed what disasters might follow.25 At the same time he regretted family pressures deterring young idealists from following or testing an ascetic vocation.26 Parents used to say: 'Is a young man not to marry? Must he always be fasting? Is no property to be bought?' (M 12.8). The theme is surely an undercurrent in Μ 42 on those situations where the judgement of parents should be set aside. The sermon is given for the feast of a martyr—M. Dolbeau gives good reasons for thinking St Catulinus on 15 July (Possidius, Indiculus X6 124, ed. Wilmart), and suggests that it was preached at Carthage in 397 in the Basilica Fausti where Catulinus was buried. The Passio evid ently recorded his successful resistance to the pleadings from his parents and other relatives, especially his wife. Spouses can hinder the path to glory. A man on the way to martyrdom fears his wife may be an Eve, a wife fears her husband may be a serpent (42.13). But in the hierarchy of virgins, widows, and married women, there is no suggestion that the last named are excluded. The Mainz sermons have discourses with other martyr festivals in mind: Μ g for Peter and Paul, Μ 50 for bishop Quadratus of Utica, Μ 45 for the martyrs of Maxula south of Carthage. The self-denying heroism of these martyrs may move Christians, living in the age after persecution has ceased at least in its old form, to realize what discipline they are called to exercise. And Catholics will know that it is the cause, not the physical pain or death, 25 In the case of Ecdicia (Ep. 262) both partners agreed on abstinence, but the husband could not keep it up and lapsed into adultery. 26 S. Denis 20.12, p. 23, Morin, speaks of parents who deter daughters wishing to take vows.</page><page sequence="17">NEW SERMONS OF ST AUGUSTINE 85 which is the necessary condition of martyrdom. There is no glory for criminals enduring torture or Donatists subjected to a flogging (5·17;45·7-8). After the imperial decree of 405 enforcing unity, there were some reluctant conversions of sullen Donatist congregations in rural areas. Maximin, Donatist bishop of Siniti in Hippo territory, was converted to the Catholica; anyone accepting communion at his hands was to have his house torched.27 Maximin himself must have found it a life-threatening experience to remain there. This is no doubt the bishop Maximin of Μ 63, seen accompanying Augustine in City of God 22.8, in the Mainz sermon going with him to a forcibly converted ex-Donatist plebs which resented the government's coercion. Augustine's discourse cites the Psalm: how good and pleasant to dwell in unity—'all grant that unity is good, not all agree that it is pleasant' (63.5). But Mother Church presses food on her sickly children (63.6). In the city of Hippo reconciliation has already been achieved, but in the rural areas of the territory the rustics have been slow to understand (63.2). Now at long last we can share bread and peace (63.3). Controversy with educated pagans is prominent in more than one sermon, and homilies with pleas to Donatists to recover unity are often also evangelistic attempts to convert thoughtful, critical adherents of polytheism. The Lorsch collection consists of a group of discourses preached not at Hippo but in various towns, suggesting that Augustine had gone on a tour in Numidia and Proconsularis. The evangelization of some areas was recent. Preached at Tignica, Μ 54.16 observes that all his congregation were children of pagan parents. A comparable remark occurs in En.En. in Ps. 96.7: 'everyone here had a pagan grandfather or great grandfather'. Augustine has to confess that he has found himself unable to move educated pagans to conversion (M 13.7), and that the better educated they are, the less willing they are to listen (M 62.13). Μ 61 was preached in the town of Boseth, the site of which is unidentified but was somewhere in Proconsularis, probably early in 404. It is the second of two discourses (the first not extant) given when a group of educated pagans came to hear what Augustine had to say. Presumably they had been specifically invited to attend. The sermon expounds at length the Neoplatonic ascent of the soul beyond visible and material objects, much in the manner of the vision at Ostia described in the Confessions. The Neoplatonic aspiration is qualified by the two Christian theses Augustine, Ep. 105.4.</page><page sequence="18">86 HENRY CHADWICK that the soul is less than divine because it is mutable—up one day, down the next—and that the way of the philosophers is a reliance on human pride. Admittedly there have been philosophers like Pythagoras with whom Christians can feel affinity. Μ 60.8 remarks that while some are members within the church, there are also fellow travellers who are 'in the vicinity' of the church. Augustine is kind to philosophers who do not value sacrificial rites. Yet they rely on their own morality to achieve a level which needs divine grace.28 The main polemic in Μ 61 is against pagans who hold that while the soul admittedly needs purification, this purging can be achieved only by the rites of theurgy. Thereby the powers are placated, and ascent to the supreme deity is facilit ated. The powers are the old gods, and once placated they act as mediators. And why, asked the pagans, should Christians object to that? They too give a mediatorial role not only to Christ but also the martyrs in their calendar, and they also invoke angels. Educated Christians scorn uneducated people (imperiti) who believe that the god resides in the wood or stone idol. But unedu cated Christians worship the columns and pictures in the church buildings. This last point of the pagan criticism of Christian behaviour is capable of more than one explanation. Augustine's reply makes the assumption that the pagans were asking the same question as Marius Victorinus put to Simplicianus, reported in the Confessions (VIII.2,4): do walls make Christians? Why should Christians sup pose that God can be properly worshipped only in a church building? His answer is effectively in terms of the warmth gener ated by the fellowship of the community singing and praying together, just as oarsmen in a boat are encouraged to keep going by the keleuma of the boatswain or other voice. In the sermon on Psalm 57: 23 he met the question: why should I go to church when people who attend every day fail to act on what they hear? The pagan question, if Augustine correctly understood its force, was in effect concerned with the localization of worship in a particular place when good Platonists knew that God occupies no space. Two other possible interpretations of the pagan critique seem worth a mention. That the churches of north Africa had pictures on the walls is certain (S. 316.5). They had pictures of Christ (De fide fide et symbolo 1.7,14), of Peter and Paul (Cons.Evang. i.10,16), and of Adam and Eve decently covered (c. Julianum V 6), and the 28 Conf. Χ.23,33: a Christian cannot judge of pagans whose moral struggle lacks grace, since one cannot know who will come under grace.</page><page sequence="19">NEW SERMONS OF ST AUGUSTINE 87 early Augustine of De Moribus 1.34,74 expressed anxiety about the superstitious attitudes of those who worshipped martyrs at their shrines and holy pictures. De Trinitate VI11.4,7 comments on the variety of portrayals of Christ. The observation that a Christian cannot be certain what the Virgin Mary looked like surely presupposes icons of her. None of this is surprising when one recalls Paulinus' churches at Nola. The reference then to columns and pictures being venerated could be explained on the hypothesis that the pictures were attached to the columns of the basilica, and that casual pagan observers supposed veneration of the icon to include some veneration of the column to which it was affixed. A third possibility must be that Punic peasants, with a long ancestral background of Phoenician religion and the cult of Tanit, understood stone columns to be the natural habitat of divine beings. One has only to recall the prohibitions of the Old Testament against the asherah to be sure that such cultus penetrat ing ancient Israel could be reconciled with the worship of Yahweh. What might not have gone on in southern Numidia? That new converts expected the externals of Christian worship to have some affinity with the ceremonial forms of the past may perhaps be illustrated by the surprise which seems to have been felt at the absence of incense, mentioned by Augustine in Μ 59.18. This evidence coheres with the well-known text, En. in Ps. 49. 21, that God asks for the sacrifice of praise, so Christians do not go to Arabia to look for incense. (That search had begun.) Augustine would have felt that celebrating the Kalends could be open to Manichee criticism. Faustus the Manichee specifically accuses ordinary church members of celebrating pagan festivals such as Kalends and Solstices (c. Faustum 20.4). Μ 62 also presupposes other pagan complaints. 62.38 stresses that Melchizedek and Job were not of Jewish race, implicitly replying to a sophisticated pagan complaint that belief in only a single god of the entire world seemed in scripture to be simply in the God of the Jews with no interest outside his own chosen people—tribal rather than universal. Christian assurance of total remission of sins by baptism, how ever dreadful those sins have been, did not sound to pagan ears like moral seriousness (M 44.6; 61.20). The continual cry, 'Believe, believe' (M 61.14), pushed reasoning aside. The accusation that pagans worship the material idols in temples showed ignorance of true worship, which is of what these images symbolize. This last claim was a gift to Augustine's polemic. Images of Neptune, Juno, or Mercury symbolize sea, air, and intelligence. To worship sea,</page><page sequence="20">88 HENRY CHADWICK air, sun, and moon is to honour merely physical objects, and to worship intelligence forgets that clever intellectuals make mistakes (61.23; 62.24). Intelligence is a neutral power which can be dir ected to evil ends as well as to good (62.24). This pagan treatment of the church resembles those patients who physically assault their good physicians (61.18). The tenacity with which pagan landowners kept to the old religion is well attested in various texts of Augustine, such as Confessions Confessions VIII.4,9 or Ep. 136.3 of 412. Μ 62 makes it evident that some of Augustine's educated pagans in Proconsularis had a class problem with the prospect of conversion. One is quoted as asking: 'Am I to be like the slavegirl who guards my front door and not like Plato and Pythagoras?' (62.55). Wealthy senatorial landowners were disinclined to share the faith of uneducated fishermen (61.24). Ifi as the Christians boast, their God chose fisherfolk, was not that rather ostentatious? Augustine's reply to the class argument appeals to the emperor himself. Honorius' visit to Rome, mentioned above, was a grand refutation of all the reservations of opulent senators who felt that Christianity was really very un-Roman and at best a faith for the lower classes. Today's emperor is 'wearing a cross on his forehead' (61.24). And in any event, from time to time God has chosen saints of high ability like Cyprian. A few quotations from the poetry of Virgil are scattered about the Mainz sermons. 27.3 has an unmarked reminiscence of Eclogue 3.95; 59.15 quotes Aeneid VI; 62.34 quotes the same passage from AeneidAeneidAeneid VIII which is familiar in Confessions VIII.2,3. Hippocrates appears in 61.17, and a fable from Aesop in 21. So any cultured persons in the congregation would not be in doubt that in coming to the church they had not left their great literature behind them. As in his correspondence with Nectarius {Ep. 104.3), Augustine was aware that the Bible had been no part of his education, and that the literature which he knew by heart was pagan (M 59.19, cf. En. in Ps. 102.25). The humility of Christ, his birth, and especially his horrible death were in pagan eyes repulsive (61.17). The Christians might proudly say that now they lived in Christian times, but almost all the allusions in Augustine to Christiana tempora29 are answering 29 G. Madec, 'Tempora Christiana: Expression du triomphalisme chretien ou recrimination paienne?' in Scientia Augustiniana, Festschrift Adolar Zumkeller (Wurzburg, 1975), 112-36. Augustine thought food shortages caused by wicked or incompetent men, not by the weather (S\ 25.4). What made times bad was the oppression of the poor, corruption in the lawcourts, perversion of the laws—all matters for which human beings are responsible ($. 311.8; S. Denis 24.11, p. 151, Morin).</page><page sequence="21">NEW SERMONS OF ST AUGUSTINE 89 complaints of pagans that since the old gods were abandoned, things have become bad: buildings are collapsing, theft and rapine never so widespread, the crowd of adulterers and fornicators mas sively increased (M 13.15). To live in Christian times seemed like a curse. Augustine replied that the criticism took no account of the large increase in the number of consecrated virgins (13.15). In any event times were not bad because Christ has come; he came because times were and are bad. ('It is not times which are bad, but we who live in them', S. 25.4; 80.8. It is delusion to think that calmer and better times will come, En. in Ps. 96.20.) So let pagans read their own histories and there find incessant wars and unending crises (13.13). Admittedly the world is senile and in a condition of serious decrepitude (12.14). The end is surely near (41.2). By contrast with this doom and gloom, Μ 61.9 includes signi ficantly positive statements about the life of the civitas, stressing its beautifully cultivated fields, the good ordering of the officers of state, the fine architecture, different arts, languages, the depths of human memory, and the overflowing richness of eloquence. And in Μ 13.9, what dignity has the image of God in humanity! Yet it is defaced by sin: 'If you smashed the emperor's statue, you would be liable legibus publicis', and the charge (which Augustine clearly thought a misnomer) would be sacrilege. Imperial legislation created problems for intransigent pagans. Questioned by a police officer in uniform (birratus stationarius) as to whether sacrifice had been offered, a pagan would deny—a contrast with the martyr who bravely confesses (9.8). Many pagans remained unreconstructed after the government had banned sacri fices and closed temples—some being dismantled, others adapted for use by Christian congregations (S. 163.2; Ep. 232.3). But Augustine was painfully aware of the need for reeducation. People were now coming to the church in large numbers, especially at high festivals, but 'there is no advantage in the closure of temples if you fabricate an idol in your heart' (viz. by an anthropomorphic image of God), En. in Ps. 138.8. Adherence to the church in no way reduced the popularity of divination and astrology; amulets and sortilege were almost universal. Ep. 98.1 concerns Christian parents who sought healing for their sick child by offering sacrifice to pagan deities; the child had already been baptized without the therapeutic effect that had evidently been hoped for. Augustine felt the church to be swamped by a multitude whose morals were very unholy (Tract.in ev.Joh. 122.7): 'Many come into the Church</page><page sequence="22">90 HENRY CHADWICK whom we do not want, and many leave whose exit we regret' {En. in in Ps. 147.9). There remained resentful pagans, whose loathing of the church was particularly felt when Christians fasted at the time of tradi tional pagan festivals. Pagan priests were no longer allowed to offer sacrifice and had to perform their rites in secret (62.28). The evangelist's task remained that of removing idolatry not merely from the temples but from the hearts of people (60.8). But when pagans complain of bad times, what they really mean is that they want more material luxuries, the cruelty of the amphitheatres which is the delight of the demons, the pornography of the theatres, the uncontrollable irrationality of horse racing at the ety with all the animosity of litigation, rival claims for actors and charioteers, and those who fight wild beasts going 'over the top' with absurd excitement. What a paradox that pagans become passionate partisans of this or that actor or jockey, and yet these are occupations which they despise; the last thing they wish to be is an actor or jockey themselves (62.3; cf. Conf. IV. 14,22). It qualifies their complaints of hard times that they still have costly public shows (12.14). If times really were hard, that would teach us not to love earthly pleasures, and should be welcomed as providential therapy (12.16). It is no bad thing that amphitheatres are collapsing (13.13). If there was a dies muneris with a show at the amphitheatre, then Augustine knew what temptations and dissensions this would bring to many of his congregation. It divided families when he asked them to observe a fast on the Kalends of January (62.7). Significantly the very fact that the church was demanding a fast made them resistant and unwilling to fast (62.6). One recalls Priscillian's troubles in Spain when he recommended fasting on 25 December.31 Moreover, Augustine was disturbed to meet some Christians who thought pagan religion a possible and legitimate alternative route to the transcendent deity and defended it for others (60.10). Evidently there were echoes of Porphyry and of Symmachus' plea to Gratian that to so impenetrable a mystery 30 Similarly Ep. 138.14 to Marcellinus: distorted human hearts reckon prosperity by fine buildings, theatrical shows, actors living in 'luxury' (no doubt meaning immorality). Ovid, Tristia 2.280 fF. draws a picture of the Roman theatre closely resembling Augustine's. Μ 62.7 observes that few pagans are now attending the theatre. 31 Turibius of Astorga complained to Pope Leo I that Priscillianists fasted on the day of Christ's Nativity (Leo, Ep. 15.4, PL 54.632A; critical edition in B. Vollmann, Studien zum Priszillianismus (St Ottilien, 1965). The first council of Bracara echoed this grumble.</page><page sequence="23">NEW SERMONS OF ST AUGUSTINE 91 there cannot be only one road. An embarrassed author of RetractationesRetractationes found that he had said much the same himself in the inexperience of comparative youth.32 The sermon for 1 January shows how anxious he was to per suade his people that at the celebrations of martyrs' anniversaries they were not trying to placate the holy saint, to persuade and cajole him or her into interceding for them. All our prayers are to God, not to the martyrs (62.47). And of course we never pray for martyrs (50.1). It is very wrong to suppose that the angels who are invoked, especially Gabriel and Michael, are like corrupt court officials who demand a douceur as the price of furthering one's petition or cause (62.48). The tough realities of the way to get things done in the political world deeply influenced attitudes to the angels and saints. In the City of God (21.27) fear is expressed that people who make little effort to behave with righteousness think the saints will compensate for their defects. A few other texts of Augustine referring to the eucharistic sacrifice (notably the most important of all in Contra adversarium legislegis et prophetarum i) show sensitivity to the need to avoid the notion of worshippers using Christ's sacrifice as a kind of bribe to the Father to gain mercy. The New Year sermon (M 62) is insistent that all Christian prayer is offered to Christ and, in the sacraments of the church, is directed on to the Father (62.49). The eucharist participates in Christ's heavenly intercession with the Father (62.57). Although bishops are given the title of priests, sacerdotes, in truth Christians have in Christ their one and only priest (62.49). And his mother Mary herself, by virtue of her relationship to Elizabeth, was of priestly descent (62.50). Franfois Dolbeau's momentous discovery has greatly enriched our knowledge of Augustine and his time.33 Henry Chadwick 32 Augustine, Retractationes 1.4.3. This defence of polytheism as a possible path to the sublimity of God appears in the correspondence of Longinianus with Augustine (Ep. 234) who also defended theurgy. 33 An admirable general survey of the Mainz collection is given by F. Dolbeau in CR Acad. Inzer. 1993, pp. 153-171. A new sermon on physical health is now printed in REAug 40 (1994 - actually !995) 279-303 from a codex in Heidelberg university library.</page></plain_text>
