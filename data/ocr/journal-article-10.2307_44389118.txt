<plain_text><page sequence="1">Autonomous and Unique Features of American Sign Language by Eugene Bergman American Sign Language (ASL) has a syntax, gram- mar, and rhetoric of its own, along with some un- usual features (pronounced polarity, three-dimen- sionality). Further, ASL represents a precise and rapid medium of communication capable of expres- sing abstractions, nuances of meaning, and spark- ling witticisms, and is a living and growing language as well. Certain parallels between ASL and Chinese are traced, and the effect of the physiological factor is considered. The potential usefulness of ASL as a tool for research into thought processes and for providing a linguistic environment favorable to the growth and maturation of the individual is pointed out. In American Sign Language (ASL) definite and indefinite articles usually are omitted, as are prepositions, copulas, participles, cases and, to some extent, tenses. But this does not mean that ASL lacks a syn- tax of its own. Omission of the definite and indefinite articles is also encountered in other languages, for one thing. In ASL adjective and noun often are the same, and so are adjective and verb, and verb and noun. Thus virtually every sign, because it is in motion, has the potential of a verb. For example, pronounced variation in the sign for "a suitcase" changes its meaning to "carrying a suitcase." Thus a sign may be used either alone or as the center of a phrase of nominal, verbal, or adjectival- adverbial function. This makes ASL a highly plastic, versatile, and flexible mode of visual communication which in the hands of a correctly trained signer can be manipulated to express anything he desires. (To say "a fluent signęr" or "a master signer" would create the impression that good signers are as rare as, say, good pan- tomimists such as Marcel Marceau. Given cor- rect and methodical training any one can ex- press himself in the language of signs with complete ease and lucidity.) A single sign, Mr. Bergman is working on the Ph.D. degree at the George Washington University and teaches part time at the Gallaudet College Tutorial Center. say "V" can be employed to express, through more or less subtle variation of the tempo and sweep of the hand with the index and middle fingers stretched out, countless mean- ings and shades of meaning: blindness, vigi- lance, virginity, victory, anticipation, pro- phecy, admoniton, alertness, contempt, re- miniscience, esteem, gaping, admonition, a raccoon, and so on - as well as the adjectival and verbal equivalents of these nouns and entire phrases, utterances, and sentences (Figs. 1-7). Among the most distinctive features of ASL are its three-dimensionality, pronounced polarity, and inherent dependence on tropes (figures of speech). Three-dimensionality. - By contrast with the two-dimensional linear and sequential nature of the spoken and written modes of com- munication, sign language is three-dimension- al, spatial. The signer sculpts ideas in the air, as it were, is himself the symbol of what he wants to express, a living, changing expres- sion of the idea being communicated, a "uni- que combination of position, configuration, and movement." i Polarity. - Another unusual feature of ASL is the fact that so many signs can be turned into their antonyms by simply reversing the direction of their motion: by uncrossing in- : stead of crossing, by converging instead of diverging, by moving the active hand toward the audience instead of away from the audi- ence. Such an extremely close relationship between synonym and antonym is encoun- tered only to a much smaller degree in other languages. (On the other hand, ASL contains very few synonyms in its vocabulary. This is offset by the aforementioned variations in the sweep and tempo of the word being signed, which endow any single sign with an ex- tremely broad range of nuances correspond- ing to multiple and discrete vocabulary items in English.) This "on-off" thesis-antithesis polarity bears some resemblance to the binary 20 Features of ASL A.A.D./Feb. 1972</page><page sequence="2">system of data transmission used in digital computers, a resemblance that might be worth exploring. Paradoxically, sign language is by its very nature an analog language from the cybernetic standpoint, whereas the writ- ten and spoken modes of communication are digital , being based on discrete letters of the alphabet; this also applies to the manual alphabet (fingerspelling), which is merely a simple transfer system consisting of 26 dacty- lic symbols representing the 26 letters of the English alphabet, as opposed to signs, which constitute a new language. Tropes.- Without tropes no sign language is possible, since it is so figurative. Hence the representation of abstract concepts and relations by the specific is inherent in ASL. For example, slavery is represented by symbo- lic manacling of one's wrist; freedom, by symbolic breaking of these manacles; wrath, by symbolic rending of one's clothes; kind- ness, by one hand winding bandages, as it were, around the other. Since tropes are the principal sources of beauty in poetry and oratory, it is evident that ASL can also assume an esthetic character and elevate itself to heights of poetry and eloquence by an appropriate use of signs - which, after all, are no other than figurative thought. This is well known to any one who has ever seen deaf actors on stage. ASL and Abstract Thought Sign language presents reality as a visual reality; it discards phonetic environment. It is, in this sense, a language that resorts to the specific in order to intuit, apprehend, and express the abstract. This has subjected it to accusations that it is a concrete language, incapable of expressing abstract concepts, accusations that stem mainly from the mani- fest verbal retardation of a majority of the deaf, but are groundless if we consider, as just one example, the richness of concepts and shades of meaning which a correctly trained signer can express by properly manipulating just one sign, such as "V." It is now generally known that the causes of this misconception are traceable to, among others, psychologists who mistakenly equated the limited verbal skills of the deaf with a limited conceptual and cognitive ability in their ignorance of the fundamental fact that to most users of ASL English is a second language rather than a native tongue. Thus, according to Mendelson et al., it is now recognized (though not yet to a suffici- ently desirable extent) that deficits in written English may be attributed to linguistic pheno- mena and do not necessarily imply a de- . creased facility of abstract formation and con- ceptualization,2 since nuances of meaning as subtle as any expressible in English can be communicated satisfactorily in interpersonal relationships with other users of the sign lan- guage. This is confirmed by more recent re- search efforts based on the application of psy- chological and I.Q. tests not requiring a prior verbal language experience. Kates et al. ex- amined concept attainments which require only minimal verbal linguistic skills and found no differences between deaf and hearing sub- jects in either process or speed of concept attainment.3 Putman et al. demonstrated that a deaf population performed better than sub- jects with normal hearing in a verbal discrimi- nation task when adequate communication via ASL was employed with the deaf subjects.4 The normality and adequacy of the cogni- tive and conceptual ability of the deaf as a group can also be perceived from any more or less through consideration of the structure of their "native language," ASL, with which we will deal below by examining the manner in which abstract concepts, emotions, and ac- tions are signed. It also is worth noting that sign language has an unusually high potential for the coin- age of puns, nonce-words, and neologisms. This is apparently due to the three-dimen- sional nature of ASL, the relative magnitude of the organs of communication (fingers, hands, arms, upper body) and the factor of stimultaneity. The puns or metaphoric bon mots thus generated are often startlingly hilarious or sardonic. Thus for example, the sign for 'óralisť also denotes a hippopotamus, ridicul- ing the exaggerated mouthing gestures of a deaf speaker trained in an oral school. The sign for 'coke' also denotes injection of a drug into the upper arm. 'Friendship' can be signed by first entwining the index fingers ('friend') and then placing the hands together in the shape of a boat or ship. 'Chairman' can be rendered with signs for 'sit' and 'man'; 'breakfast,' with signs for 'break' and 'speed.' To say 'knockwurst' one grazes the chin with a A.A.D./Feb. 1972 Features of ASL 21</page><page sequence="3">clenched fist and then makes the sign for 'worst.' 'Egghead' is similarly portrayed with separate signs for 'egg' and 'head.' It is ex- actly because these signs are so concrete that they seem so comical when combined. Pure metaphors in which, so to speak, the tenor harmonizes with the vehicle, also are feasible as when one signs 'waddle' (the thumb and index finger represent the legs and the whole sign is a ludicrous parody of a duck's or a fat person's walk). This particular potential of ASL is still largely unexplored: in the hands of any witty and in- telligent signer ASL can be a potent means of sparkling conversation. This also applies to neologisms. ASL is a relatively young lan- guage: it came into being, more or less, in 1817, with the establishment of the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Conn., and its roots date back to 1750. The rate of its growth has been accelerating in recent years, as part of a quiet renaissance going on in the awareness of the deaf as a minority subcul- ture. In 1969, for example, Kannapell et al. published a list of 475 new signs for introduc- tion in high-school and college instruction,5 with the object of updating ASL and adapting it to recent advances in biology, mathematics, chemistry, physics, psychology, economics, history, sociology, audiology, and library science. All of these signs already are in practical use among instructors at Gallaudet College and, as the writer can personally testify, their use among the student popula- tion is spreading. Parallels Between ASL and Chinese In both Chinese and ASL we meet an ex- tremely restricted number of radicals (214 in Chinese, several thousand in ASL) and richness of composition resulting from com- binations of these radicals. Moreover, a large number of Chinese characters present a com- bination of phonetic terms with ideographic signs and we encounter a similar mixture in ASL, resulting from the combinations - chermes, as Stokoe terms them1 -of finger- spelling with signs. Physiological Conditioning Factors Owing to physiological limitations it is doubtful whether the total number of signs in ASL will ever exceed five thousand. But this should not be an obstacle if we consider that a correctly trained signer can express himself in ASL with the utmost precision, whatever the nuances of meaning may be. It is these physiological limitations that are a cardinal factor in the succinctness, rapidity, and precision of the language of signs, making it possible to execute and "read" signs twice as quickly as articulate speech, as this writer has verified by per- sonal experiments. This is logical considering that sign lan- guage is synthetic rather than analytic. If ideas are to be rapidly communicated by signs the analytic equivalent of auditory perception (word-for-word translation) should not be submitted to visual perception. Abstract concepts. - 'Wisdom' (which, like all other signs in this paragraph, is signed by touching the forehead) is measured by the depth of the mind, while 'folly' is its shal- lowness. 'To dream,' 'to imagine,' to follow an 'ideal,' 'to persevere,' 'to hope,' 'to des- pair'- all depend upon the mind and all, ex- cept the last, have an upward tendency. 'To remember' we first 'know' and then press it in or seal it into the mind with the same gesture with which our ancestors sealed their letters with little red wafers at the end of the thumb. 'To forget' we wipe our brow as a sponge wipes a slate (the tabula rasa con- cept, not surprising when we consider that the century in which I'Epee constructed the language of signs on viable linguistic prin- ciples was also the century of Locke and Berkeley). Examples of signs expressing other abstract concepts include the signs for 'correlation,' 'analogy,' 'creation,' 'energy,' 'disintegration,' 'doctrine,' 'evolution,' 'liberalism,' 'meiosis,' 'regression,' 'vacuum,' to cite just a few. Emotions. - Instead of naming emotions the signs concentrate on either describing them or enacting them perceptibly. Since the heart is supposed to be the seat of emotions, the passions are portrayed by touching the heart with various gestures of affection, of abhor- rence, of grief, of sadness, and so on. Need- less to say, infinitesimal gradations of mo- tions also can be portrayed, and, if the grada- tions are sufficiently distinct, different sign combinations are employed. For example, 'fury' is portrayed by symbolically rending one's clothes while 'vexation,' a much more moderate form of anger, is portrayed by in- 22 Features of ASL A.A.D./Feb. 1972</page><page sequence="4">cheating how a vexed person's facial expres- sion would contract. Actions. - There also exists the class of op- erative or attributive signs, imitative of ac- tions, of all things belonging to the outward life and daily avocations of men: signs for 'printer/ 'car mechanic,' 'train conductor,' etc.; signs for 'washing,' 'shaving,' 'dressing' - the list might be extended ad infinitum. Objects are pictured by imitating their most distinctive characteristics: for example, in the case of animals: the long stiff whiskers of the cat, the narrow erect ears of the horse, the wide flapping ears of the mule, the towering neck of the giraffe, the sinuous proboscis of the elephant, the luxuriant mane of the lion. In this way, the most graceful, convenient, and strikingly appropriate signs are evolved. Below we consider the etymology of some of the most typical vocabulary items of ASL, which shows that there is a rational explana- tion for the form-pattern of every sign. Etymology of Some Common Signs6 ANIMAL- tips of fingers massage the chest to show the breathing of any animal. SEEM, - "now I see the palm, now I do not." CAN. -fists brought down, showing power. BAD. - something tasted or smelled and thrown down because bad. GOOD. - something tasted or smelled and offered because good. BEAUTIFUL. - all parts of face neatly arranged into sym- metry. UGLY. - face pulled out of shape, unsymmetrical. BELIEVE. - "mind-trust" DISBELIEVE, - "you are trying to blindfold me." BUT. - opposite of 'same' CARE, - two "V" hands - "four eyes watching" DECEIVE. - one hand under the other, underhand acting. DURING. - the index fingers are pushed into future to show continuance. FALL IN LOVE. - knocked off one's feet by the transport of love. EXCUSE. - please rub out the mark that is against me. HOME, - where one eats and sleeps. JEALOUS. - as when a baby places its finger in mouth (desire). FLIRT. - two persons sitting close and bowing to each other. LEARN. - take from book and put it into the head. MISTAKE. - children and adults grasp the mouth or the chin when they speak out of turn of erroneously. OR. - offering first one then the other. OUR. - your and mine combined in slow motion. PROPHESY - look through or rend the veil of the future. SAVE - right "V" hand (with the idea of watchful eyes) presses the precious left hand close to oneself SELL. - holding up the garment for sale. SINCE. - from the past out to now. TEMPT. - nudging a person's elbow to urge him to act. PERFECT, -synonymous with exact. PRESIDENT. - horns of authority (as in Moses) BLAME. - left hand supporting the right as accepting burden. There also exists a special class of com- pound signs, or compound morphemes, as when 'eat' and 'noon' are combined to de- note 'lunch'; 'country' is represented by wav- ing an upright forearm ('tree') while the other hand, moving around the base of the tree, is the ground or land where trees grow; 'moun- tain' is portrayed by striking the clenched fist to denote hard rock and then tracing the shape of the mountain. Uniqueness of Sign Language and Its Implications In the preceding sections proofs of the linguistic autonomy of ASL have been pre- sented, and it has been shown that it is a living, growing, and highly fecund language. There remain, however, other and highly in- triguing aspects of this language which, I believe, deserve serious investigation: for one thing, it appears that ASL can be used not only to express the entire range of hu- man abstractions and emotions but also to broaden it in depth. Consider that the language of signs is the natural language of man, for it is the lan- guage to which all men instinctively resort when they cannot avail themselves of words. It has been pointed out above that a cor- rectly trained signer can express himself in ASL with the utmost precision, whatever the nuance of meaning may be. The curious thing about sign language, however, is that it also is a language through which fine new nuances of meaning may be communicated: since this language portrays both the object and the process of ideation, it can be used to express concepts, subjective experiences, and elusive aspects of reality that defy formulation in other languages. It is also the most authentic (in the existential sense) of all languages be- cause in no other language does a "speaker" express his personal reactions to life situations with such dramatic and personal immediacy. A most unique feature of ASL is that it is the only autonomous, articulate, and syntactic language which is neither vocal nor written. It can thus be used both as "third dimension" and as a new criterion when comparing the vocal and written forms of language and A.A.D./Feb. 1972 Features of ASL 23</page><page sequence="5">analyzing their interrelationship. By the same token, it represents a potential new tool in explorations of the structure and psycho- physiological nature of language as the out- ward expression of human thought. Because it is the most anthropomorphic of all languages, ASL represents a latent domain of epistemol- ogy which, if more attention is devoted to it by linguists, philosophers, and cyberneticists, should yield significant new data on the workings of the human mind, on the proces- ses of cerebration. The very fact of the existence of ASL, and of ASL users, for example, is the most definite proof that coherent and literate thought is possible in the total absence of participation by the auditory region of the cortex. It is a traditional maxim of philosophy that speech is the distinguishing feature of man: from this standpoint, the existence of ASL and its users is an upsetting and anomalous pheno- menon, a piece which does not fit in the jigsaw puzzle and which for this very reason may lead to interesting new discoveries about the nature of the human brain, if proper in- terdisciplinary research in undertaken. Consider the following theoretical implica- tions of the existence of ASL. It is a byword that noise distracts, and people usually seek out quiet surroundings in order to be able to con- centrate their thoughts. If we go one step farther and pursue this axiom to its logical con- clusion, it will be reasoned that a deaf person, i.e. an individual who lives in a world of more or less absolute and total silence, should have an unusual capacity for mental concentration, should be a first-rate thinker. Then consider aliso that the language of signs demands of its users extremely high powers of perception and discrimination, if subtle varia- tions in the motion of a sign (and hence also in nuance of meaning, in behavior and attitude) are to be distinguished and sophisticated ut- terances to be executed and "read.." In addi- tion, ASL is endowed with a much higher qual- ity of synesthesia (subjective sensations or images of a sense or color complementing the sensory modality - vision in the case of the deaf - being stimulated), considering that signs can be so much more richly plastic and expres- sive than speech. In theory, then, ASL provides its users with a linguistic environment favorable to their de- velopment into individuals with a keen sus- ceptibility to the minutest variation in interper- sonal relationships and attitudes, with a sub- tlety and sensitivity far above normal and, as a consequence, with above-normal powers of understanding. It is reasonable to expect that the better, the more articulately, an individual expresses himself, the more conscious he is of his environment, and the more maturely he reacts to it. And there is perhaps no other lan- guage as conducive to optimal and facile self- expression as ASL. If all these considerations are combined, the ASL user should potentially be an individual with an extremely refined sensibility, a first-rate intellect, and high pow- ers of mental concentration. The reason why these premises are not ful- filled into reality are too complex to be amen- able to practical investigation. Too many vari- ables come into play, so that even a controlled experiment is not feasible. The writer does not feel qualified to venture anything beyond these comments. (If we consider, however, that only a minuscule proportion of the deaf know how to use ASL correctly, it would be interesting to see what would happen were methodical instruction in ASL provided to hearing-impaired children starting with the primary grades or even in the kindergarten, but this whole subject is simply too contro- versial.) All these speculations, fantastic as they may sound, are intended to show that this fasci- nating language deserves broader interdisci- plinary investigation. References 1. Stokoe, W.
