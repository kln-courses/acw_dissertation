<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ELEMENTS OF OLD TESTAMENT POETRY PART I The Old Testament preserves all that we know of the poetry of ancient Israel. Sharing with the poetry of Western races the essentials of a common branch of art, as well as some accidental features, the principle of its formal structure still presents a factor in which Hebrew and other Semitic poetry differs from that of European peoples. Moreover, this poetry exists in a language diverse from Euro- pean tongues in verbal structure and expressive genius, and still more different in phonetics and accentuation. The greater num- ber of Hebrew words are accented on the final syllable. The alphabet contains no fewer than five sibilants, and there is fre- quent use of four gutturals, two of which are difficult to sound. These and other physical qualities impair our appreciation. Faithful translation into English often destroys the Hebrew rhythm, while reading the Hebrew for the sake of its rhythm involves the utterance of sounds at least unfamiliar to our ears, and often unwelcome. To treat completely both likenesses and differences would be clearly impossible in two papers of average length. We must content ourselves with barely enough for something like an ade- quate outline of the subject. 1. The Place of Poetry in the Old Testament Anywhere in the historical books one may meet with poetry quoted by the narrators. We find hymns of triumph such as that of Moses at the Red Sea (Ex. 15:1-19) and of the prophetess Debbora at Carmel (Jdgs. 5), or David's psalm of thanksgiving for a crisis safely passed (2 Kgs. 22), or his touching elegy over his fallen friend Jonathan (2 Kgs. 1:19-27). But these are iso- lated examples. Our scope is that specialized part of Old Testa- ment literature which is naturally poetical, and is therefore pre- sumably so because of its proper object and aim. Those books which are wholly versified form a consecutive group of seven. They are Job,1 the Psalms, the Proverbs, Eccle- siastes, the Song of Songs, Wisdom, and Ecclesiasticus (or the Wisdom of the Son of Sirach) . The last two come to us through 1 Excepting a short introduction and conclusion in narrative prose.</page><page sequence="2">204 The Elements of Old Testament Poetry the Alexandrian canon of the Old Testament, in the ancient Greek version known as the Septuagint, and have no counter- parts in the Hebrew canon of Palestine, though there is evidence that these and five other Greek writings (called by Catholic theologians "deuterocanonical," and by others generally "the Apocrypha") were known in Palestine before the Christian era. Of the Book of Wisdom, therefore, we have no Hebrew original. The same was true of the much longer work Ecclesiasticus until a few years ago, since when more than half of its Hebrew original has been recovered in fragments. These seven books compose that part of Old Testament litera- ture which is properly poetical. However, in conventional sub- divisions of the literature into "historical/' "prophetical," and so on, we find this third class named "sapiential," or concretely "the wisdom literature," and not, for example, "the poetical." Jewish canonists called them simply "the Writings," as a group distinct from "the Law" (Pentateuch), "the Former Prophets" (historians) and "the Later Prophets," or deliverers of particu- lar revelations. All are familiar with the fact that two different norms may govern the classification of poetry into its subsidiary "literary forms." On the one hand, the poet's relation to his subject-mat- ter founds the division into "lyric" poetry, in which he speaks for himself, and "dramatic," in which words and actions are ascribed to his characters. Again, these two categories may be subdivided in part (if not quite pari passu) with respect to the nature of the theme itself, or the poeťs object in presenting it through either medium. Thus we may distinguish "reflective lyric" from the "simple song," or "didactic lyric" from either; and the dramatic form too may have its ulterior ends. Even nar- rative poetry, which is sometimes classed by itself, may to some extent adopt either lyric or dramatic form of expression. It is this latter criterion of aim or purpose which assumes especial significance in the subject of ancient Hebrew poetry. 2. Ethical Teaching the Predominant Aim Taking the seven books in order, let us briefly relate their particular themes to the forms in which they are presented. Job is arranged in the dramatic scheme of a dialogue whose char- acters are introduced by turns, and these conduct a long and spirited discussion of the moral problem created by the sufferings</page><page sequence="3">The Elements op Old Testament Poetry 205 of the innocent. The Psalms are mainly pure devotional lyrics, or hymns, a few of which incite to divine praise in the charac- ter of historical odes without abandoning lyrical form. The Proverbs may be termed didactic lyrics, being for the most part homely and trenchant maxims of conduct, whose general title well suggests both aim and form. Somewhat akin to the subject of Job is that of Ecclesiastes, the summum bonum and the illu- sions attending its quest; but this is a monologue, and thus a reflective lyric so far as concerns its specious form.2 The Song of Songs, a nuptial hymn sensu proprio , assumes the dramatic form of a dialogue between the lovers interspersed with briefer choral parts, though every character speaks unannounced. Jew- ish and Christian interpreters alike acknowledge this work as inspired in the character of a sacred allegory representing the inviolable bond of charity between God and His elect. The Book of Wisdom, extant only in Greek, is a reflective lyric of rare beauty, presenting a moral philosophy of history drawn from Israel's unique experience of divine favor, but couching its deep- est reflections in the subtler and more graceful forms of Greek expression. Finally, Ecclesiasticus is a didactic lyric similar to the Proverbs, though longer and more elaborate. In addition to this sketch of chief characteristics, Proverbs, Wisdom and Ec- clesiasticus contain extensive passages of a quite peculiar type, devoted to the praise of wisdom itself, where the precious quality is half personified in the guise of an active principle or attribute of Deity. Thus, if we except the Psalter - which, as a collection of hymns, would in any case be versified - the whole of this poetical section of the Old Testament reveals the aim of ethical instruc- tion as the highest common factor of its theme and purpose. This justifies the designation "wisdom literature/' since even the Psalter leads to prayer by composing prayers for repetition. "Wisdom" in the Oriental view was more than either informa- tion or prudence. It was a moral and ascetical philosophy; the system, theoretical and practical, of what might fairly respond to the "perfection" of the Christian ideal. Several times we are assured that "the fear of Yah weh is the beginning of wisdom" - a delicate conscience is the incentive to wisdom's acquisition and the safeguard of its exercise and growth. 2 That is, apart from the question of its being a literary impersonation.</page><page sequence="4">206 The Elements op Old Testament Poetry Should we conclude from this that, as all poetry is a vehicle for the expression of some conception of genuine beauty, so the Old Testament writers prefer poetry as most appropriate to the expression of beauty of the highest order - the beauty of "wis- dom"? Not ineptly so, perhaps; yet not quite adequately. It may also appear that a simpler and more practical reason has chiefly forged the link so obviously existing between ethical teaching and poetical form. But the alliance between the two should first be followed even beyond the limits of the wisdom literature. No part of the older revelation more clearly consists of ethical instruction than the oracles of the Prophets. If the word "prophet" popularly denotes "one who foretells the future," none of us mistakes this idea for an adequate definition of Hebrew prophetism. The assured and often circumstantial prediction of future events was a necessary element of the prophetical func- tion in Israel, but by no means its whole account. Adequately the prophet was simply what we term, in fundamental theology, the medium revelationis of the old dispensation. He was a spokesman charged with transmitting to God's people the par- ticular truths revealed to himself. The nature of his message varied; it was often one of instruction for present needs, and past experience as well as future consequence might be appealed to in confirmation or by way of sanction. The future itself - even the remoter future of the Messianic Days - was invoked as an ideal or a stimulus, except when foretold as an evident retri- bution. But in all cases the prophet was the supreme teacher of morality. His message both presupposed and endorsed the Law once for all delivered, but always as the norm of present life, de- manding both approval in judgment and execution in act. Hence it is not surprising that poetical form should appear in the oracles of the prophets. Many of these were orally delivered in metrical form before their reduction to writing. Verse is, however, more natural in prophecies originally composed in writ- ing for the guidance of future generations, like the last twenty- seven chapters of Isaias ; and in these cases adherence to poetical form is likely to be more finished and exact. Some of the briefer prophetical books, such as Osee and Amos, are wholly in verse. Some of the longer, like Jeremias and Ezechiel, are mainly in prose. The finest extant piece of Hebrew literature is Isaias; and more than half of it is versified.</page><page sequence="5">The Elements of Old Testament Poetry 207 This inveterate tendency of ethical teaching to avail itself of poetical form is a feature of Hebrew literature which finds its explanation in the simplest account of the physical structure of Semitic poetry itself. 3. Comparison of Thoughts the Essence of Poetic Form Morality is the fruit of accepted principles, and principles are abstractions, even principles of transient action. How make them clearly understood except in terms of the concrete act it- self? But this act, or that one, may not exemplify the rule in all its content. The problem becomes one of explanation, and there- fore of the amplification or development of thought, in the sphere of ethical teaching. One may begin with a statement commend- ing some species of action. But the precept will be both fuller and clearer if its thesis is amplified ; and this is possible in three elementary ways. First, the original statement may be repeated in equivalent words which really add nothing to the thought. At least the same thing has been said in two ways; and the emphasis in- volved can arrest attention and impress the memory. A second and more effective device will be to make the second sentence really amplify the first, unfolding its thought by making it more specific in some one element or aspect. A third means of clarify- ing a precept is to pair its statement with another which throws it into more vivid relief against the background of a contrast. These remarks merely analyse the rudiments of method in all progressive development of thought for purposes of explanation. Such elementary pedagogy may seem to pertain to the inner con- tent of Hebrew poetry - its occasions, its themes, its discursive aims. But we have for the present done with all that, and are looking directly at external structure. We seek the essential note which makes a passage recognizable as verse and not prose. Judged by our familiar standards, this should be a matter of accents, and feet, and verses, and stanzas, and usually of rhyming ends. Our norm of structure stands in a fixed arrangement of the single word as the unit. Though we do not insist upon rhyme, and though even our metres may somewhat vary, we at least look for verses of uniform length and syllabic structure, whether collected into stanzas or strophes, or whether successive throughout the poem. And in these devices it is verbal arrange-</page><page sequence="6">208 The Elements of Old Testament Poetry ment that determines all ; even the verse itself need not be "end- stopped" in its thought. But in the Hebrew poetical structure it is thoughts themselves, and therefore sentences, that become the unit of arrangement. Some degree of rhythm is, of course, an attendant feature, though strict metre cannot be discerned in Hebrew verse, and of rhyme it makes little use. But the one peculiar trait of Semitic ver- sification is that thought-arrangement, and not word-arrange- ment, is the basis of its external form. What is called "paral- lelism" - the pairing of thought with thought, and so of clause with clause - is the norm and test of composition in verse. The metre may vary freely, and even the rhythmic distribution of accents be somewhat elastic. But the balance of statement against statement in the progress of the theme is indispensable. It is the constitutive norm of poetry as such. No wonder, then, that the wisdom literature and much of the prophetical is versified. To deliver moral instruction in such a form was to secure for it the triple advantage of clarification, assistance to memory, and attractive presentation. Of course, not every line of Old Testament poetry expresses some precept or sentiment directly ethical, though such is the general nature of the poetical literature as a whole. 4. Parallelism At all events, we have as the structural basis of Hebrew poetry not only "parallelism" in general, but the three species of paral- lelism already mentioned: namely, the synonymous, repeating the thought in other words ; the synthetic, developing the thought one step at a time ; and the antithetic, emphasizing the thought by contrast with an opposite. Synonymous parallel may be illus- trated by the two opening distichs or couplets of the 36th Psalm (in Hebrew the 37th) :3 Vex not thyself because of miscreants, be not jealous of them that do evil; for like the grass they will soon be cut down, and like green herbage they will wither. Synthetic parallel, in which the balanced clauses unfold the thought by degrees, is the commonest plan of development or ex- 3 All the extracts offered are original translations. Textual emendations will be noted as they may occur.</page><page sequence="7">The Elements of Old Testament Poetry 209 planation in ail verbal instruction, and therefore the commonest type of parallelism in Hebrew poetry. We may instance the open- ing tristich of the 1st Psalm : Happy the man who hath not walked by the plan of the wicked, and in the way of sinners hath not stood still, and in the seat of scoffers hath not sat. Here, as often in Hebrew verse, the comparison employs three members. Each recommends a further step away from evil. Deliberate action should be free from evil motive, the influence of bad example should be shunned, and one's moral sense must not be exposed to the callousness of cynicism. Of antithetic parallels the Proverbs are especially full. Here are two typical distichs (not consecutive) from the tenth chap- ter : A wise son maketh a glad father, but a foolish son is the grief of his mother. He groweth poor who worketh with a slack hand, but the hand of the diligent maketh rich. All three types of parallelism are so abundant in the Psalms that one may trace them with ease, even in versions not so print- ed as to indicate versification. As a rule, any numbered verse of our texts will consist of one or two such couplets, but rarely of more than two. This pairing of similar thoughts may prove an aid to the cor- rect exegesis of an ambiguous word or phrase. For example, when we read in Psalm 32 (33) : 6, By the word of Yah weh the heavens were made, and by the breath of his mouth all their host, we might suppose "the breath of his mouth," appearing as a creative agency, to be a figurative adumbration of God the Holy Spirit, as "the Life-Giver" of the Nicene Creed, were it not that the equivalent "word of Yah weh" in the first member of the parallel serves to explain "the breath of his mouth" as simply an anthropomorphic expression for the same creative decree con- ceived of as a word of command. The service of the parallel to exegesis may be of still more radical value in guiding textual criticism. One classical instance may illustrate this. In Psalm 87 (88) : 11, our version has "Wilt thou show wonders to the dead? Or shall physicians raise to life,</page><page sequence="8">210 The Elements of Old Testament Poetry and give praise to thee?" The second member follows the Vul- gate's reading aut medici suscitabunt, et confitebuntur tibi; and the Septuagint also has lar poi, "healers" or "physicians." Both versions, of course, used a Hebrew text whose consonants then lacked the vowel-points introduced by the Massorah. The con- sonantal skeleton of the uncertain word was easy to read as rophe'im, an active participle of the verb "heal" (the same that figures in the name of the archangel Raphael). But these "heal- ers" should be in some way comparable to "the dead" in the first member of the couplet. Our present Hebrew text has the same consonants supplied with other vowels, so as to read Repha'im. This is a proper name denoting a race traditionally earlier than the Canaanites; and their disappearance in the shadows of the past makes them much more appropriate company for "the dead" than our constant benefactors "the physicians." So it is clear that the present Hebrew text has, in this case, better preserved the original than the ancient versions, and that the Psalmist really wrote, For the dead dost thou work wonders? Will the ancients arise and praise thee? Since the predominance of parallel structure will be evident in every example, we may now dismiss it, and descend to other features of external form, more familiar to our own ideals of poetry, although really less fundamental. 5. Rhythm, Metre, and Strophic Structure Next in order, of course, the most conspicuous feature will be that of rhythm. This is the effect produced upon the ear by the recurrence of stressed or accented syllables at more or less regu- lar intervals. Now Hebrew, like English, has a strong natural stress - strong enough to react by compensation on many un- accented vowels to the extent of reducing them to a slight vocalic impulse (marked by "vocal sh^wa") whose quality cannot be de- tected. This serves to prevent the growth of words to unwieldy length in the process of inflection, since an unaccented syllable whose vowel has thus lost its quality ceases to count as a syllable at all, passing on its initial consonant to the next syllable. The same condensive process appears in ether features of Hebrew morphology. Some of the small monosyllabic particles are pro- clitics, losing their accent to the next word. The same is true -</page><page sequence="9">The Elements of Old Testament Poetry 211 at least in some measure - of a much larger grammatical class, namely, of nouns in what is called "the construct state," govern- ing a following genitive. On the other hand, a word of three or four syllables, especially if accented on the ultima, often has a secondary accent near the beginning. These peculiarities give the Hebrew poet much license in the practical distribution of accents within each verse.4 Since Hebrew versification rests on the pairing of clauses or statements, its unit is usually the couplet or distich, though tris- tichs often occur. The single verse or member aims at a uni- form number of accents as its norm of rhythm. There are usual- ly three in lyric poetry as a class, and in the more active dramatic strains, while the statelier measures appropriate to reflection or devoted to sublime descriptions often prefer a verse of four accents. The number is never less than two, nor more than five in all. Even the rhythmic unit, however, is not rigidly uniform, and a series of fours may be relieved by one or two verses of three accents, or a section composed of threes may emphasize its conclusion with a verse or two in four, somewhat like the "Alex- andrine line" at the end of an eighteenth century pentameter. Moreover, distinct sections of the same poem may vary from one number of accents to another, especially if such divisions are perceptibly strophic in the progress of the theme as a whole. Metre appears to have been even more flexible than rhythm in Hebrew versification. Our own metrical standards demand not only the same number of accented groups, or "feet," to every verse, but a uniform structure of the foot itself, with the same number of unaccented syllables ( theses ) before or after each accent (arsis). Hebrew verse, however, does not insist upon this. Between two arses there may be any number of theses up to three. Of course, there will usually be at least one ; and yet 4 Since the unit of rhythm becomes a main factor in the further subject of metre, the latter must be here anticipated to the extent of one remark. Without attempting to review the various theories of Hebrew metre which have been proposed, it may be said (1) that the most observant modern students of the subject agree in rejecting the quantity of syllables, and in accepting the grammatical accent of words as decisive of metre; (2) that the written "metrical" or musical accents of the Massoretic text are general- ly admitted (with the exceptions always noted) to coincide with the posi- tion of the "tone," or grammatical accent, thus taken as marking the arsis of metre.</page><page sequence="10">212 The Elements of Old Testament Poetry at times we find two syllables accented in immediate succession.5 Here, for example, are two consecutive distichs from the Song of Debbora (Jdgs. 5:4). The first pair have three accents. The first member of the second pair has four. The second member returns to three, but places the first and second accents on con- secutive syllables, enforcing an almost caesural pause between them, and thus retarding the verse of three accents to something like the time value of its predecessor of four : Yahwéh, b^seth^ká mish-She'ír, besďd^ka missadéh 'Edom, ' éres ra'áshah, gam-shamáyim natáphu, gam-'abím natáphu máyim. In the last line one feels an impulse to pause between the first arsis, on the final syllable of 'abim, and the next one on the suc- ceeding syllable. It can be felt even in literal translation : Yahwéh, at thy march from She'ir, thine attack from the field of Édom, eárth was shaken, and heaven collapsed, and the cloúds || poúred down water. From all this it will be evident that, notwithstanding the ef- forts of some of the Fathers to equate Hebrew poetry with West- ern forms, we cannot qualify the word "metre" by classifying adjectives such as "iambic" or "dactylic," if indeed we may pro- perly speak of metre at all. In fact, when writers commonly speak of sections of biblical text as distinguished by "metrical structure," the expression, however convenient, is analogous rather than precise. Keeping, however, this reservation in mind, Hebrew metre may be distinguished as "lyric" or "dramatic" in a flexible sense, and more exactly as "elegiac." For there is a type of verse, called "the qina " in Hebrew terminology, whose more ponderous member of five accents adapts it to elegy proper and to solemn themes not strictly elegiac. It is common in the Lamentations of Jeremias. The five accents have an intervening caesura, which usually follows the third, giving the verse the 5 As to the possibility of two adjacent arses , while Vaccari (De Libris Didacticis Veteris Testamenti, Rome, 1929, §6), without expressly denying it, appears to leave no place for it in his statement that intercedit saltern una , ad summum tres atonae , yet Zorell (appendix to Knabenbauer, Comm. in Proverbia, Paris, 1910, p. 251), whom he cites with approval, and Dal- man, similarly cited by Zorell, both expressly admit the fact, though not as of common occurrence.</page><page sequence="11">The Elements of Old Testament Poetry 213 structure "three plus two." We can hear it in English if we take from Psalm 18 (19) the following couplet: The feár of Yahwéh is clean, endúring for ever; the júdgments of Yahwéh are trúe, júst altogether. But the structure becomes clearer when we listen to the Hebrew : Yir'áth Yahwéh t^horáh, ' omédeth la'ád ; mishpWéy Yahwéh 'eméth, sad^qú yahdáw. Next we come to the arrangement of Hebrew verse in strophic divisions, or stanzas. Of course, these follow transitions in the theme of the poem, and their outline is often discernible through its medium. While not rigidly maintaining the same number of verses, like the stanzas of our conventional scheme, the strophes do not vary much in length within one continuous composition. There are several devices for marking the strophe to ear and eye. The most conspicuous is the recurrence of a refrain, or intercalary group, at the end of each successive strophe. The beautiful Psalm Judica me, Dens , with which our Mass begins at the altar-steps (Ps. 42, Hebrew 43), closes with a quatrain which also occurs twice in the psalm just preceding, showing that the two were originally a single psalm of three strophes. The dividing refrain runs thus : Why art thou downcast, my soul, and why dost thou murmur within me? Hope thou in God, for yet shall I praise Him, the help of my countenance, and my God. The same device appears in the ninth and tenth chapters of Isaias, where four strophes of terrible denunciation are divided by the final refrain, By all this his wrath is not averted, but still is his hand outstretched !
