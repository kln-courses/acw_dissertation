<plain_text><page sequence="1">Number 2 Whole Volume XLIII March, 1934 Number 254 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW THE GREEK CONCEPTION OF NATURE' SCIENTIFIC speculation among the Greeks began vaguely with Hesiod, became articulate with the Milesians, and culminated in Aristotle's philosophy of nature. The development is both native and continuous. The culture of the Greeks is the spontane- ous creation of their own genius. Their views about man and na- ture and God are the natural products of their own instinctive feelings and attitudes. After the period of the invasions and mi- grations and mixing of races, the Greeks developed a native cul- tural consciousness at once genial, responsive and energetic. It is true that the distinction between Greek and barbarian received literary expression only relatively late. Nevertheless, the feeling of cultural solidarity expressed itself very early in their history. Greece was not a geographic term; Greece was where the Greeks were. With the single exception of the Dionysiac religion, which was most certainly Thracian in origin, I know of no single foreign influence that in any radical way subverted or transformed the native genius of the Greeks. This one exception, however, is of great importance because the Dionysiac and Orphic religions pro- foundly influenced Greek cosmology and Greek views of the soul. After the epic period, with this one notable exception, Greek life was not subject to any violent upheavals from within or any ter- rifying invasions from without. Their internal differences en- abled them to create a variety of ideas while their cultural homo- geneity kept their many-sided speculations within the limits of an integrated racial consciousness. This is amazing when we re- 'Address of the President of the Western Division of the American Philosophical Association, delivered before the joint session of the Eastern, Pacific and Western Divisions held at the University of Chicago, Septem- ber 6-9, 1933.

XLIII. flect, as Gilbert Murray has pointed out, that Greek culture was an oasis almost completely surrounded by barbarian custom and savage practice. Confidence in their cultural integrity lends to the development of Greek thought a distinctive continuity. I think the assumption of continuity is important. As an illustration of discontinuity, we may take the progress of later European thought where all is con- flict, adjustment and assimilation of foreign ideas. The first effort at integration is that of Philo in which the Greek and Hebraic are in juxtaposition. Plotinus is oriental, Egyptian, Roman and Greek. St. Augustine expresses a synthesis of Greek, neo-Platonic and Christian. The writings of Pseudo-Dionysius are a fantasy of oriental, neo-Platonic, Hebraic, Christian, Greek and early medi- eval. Later we have the great syntheses of the Hebraic and Greek in Moses Maimonides, and of the Greek and Christian in St. Thomas. Everywhere thought is a compromise of radically conflicting and divergent points of view. Greek intellectual development, on the other hand, is the na- tive product of an internal and expanding effort at self-expres- sion. No movement was lost and no energy diverted in adjustment to an uncongenial invasion of foreign ideas. As a result Greek sci- entific thought comes to fruition in the amazingly short period of three centuries. The continuous attack on common problems by men with common interest and a common background is equiva- lent to the prolongation of life and the enlargement of effort. This is the only way I can explain the prodigious work of Aris- totle. No one man could possibly, in the space of so short a life, amass so tremendous a volume of scientific description and analysis. Aristotle, with the combined aid of an organized staff of assistants, utilizes the accomplishments of all his predecessors in the effort to solve the problems which they had formulated. His scientific work is the culmination of prolonged and continuous meditation upon the central interest of Ionian science, namely, the meaning of "nature" and man's place in it. It is true, of course, that influences came in from abroad, but the Greeks always maintained control over foreign ideas, and, as Plato says, "Whatever the Greeks borrowed from the barbarian they always made better in the end". Scattered fragments of</page><page sequence="3">No. 2.] THE GREEK CONCEPTION OF NATURE III mathematical and astronomical knowledge sifted in from Egypt and from the East, but they in no way altered the philosophical background already established. Foreign influences, even in the pre-epic period, have probably been exaggerated. Mylonas has shown, in his very recent excavations at Eleusis, that the oldest of the temples of Demeter dates as far back as the fifteenth cen- tury B.C. and that it shows no Egyptian influence. It is not my purpose to take the Greek conception of nature as an illustration of continuity, but rather to use the hypothesis of continuity as a means of interpreting the Greek conception of na- ture. It is for this reason that I shall attach so much weight to the testimony of Aristotle. What is certain in the end lends clarity to what is vague in the beginning. From beginning to end Ionian thought is dominated by an in- tense interest in "nature". The chief objects of speculative in- terests center around the origin of the world, the character of pri- mary existence, and the processes of change and growth which are continually going on in the physical world. Above all the Greeks were interested in life, and they instituted a persistent search for its undying source. Their earliest recorded reflections were directed towards an explanation of the most general facts of observation. Looking out on the world, one sees things mov- ing, changing, living, growing and feeling. How are we to ex- plain these obvious facts? What is it in things that makes them live and grow? What is sensation and how is it that we are able to see and feel and think? Answers to these questions furnish us with the first fruits of philosophical speculation. There is a dual character in all speculation. It flows from ante- cedent ideas and is guided by observation and interest. Philosophy did not begin ab initio with the Milesians. They inherited a com- mon body of knowledge which was grounded in earlier experi- ence. They began with what they had and what they had was a very intricate and complicated system of ideas whose antecedents reached far back into earlier past. They inherited views about the "divine" and "nature" and "soul" which were as familiar to them as gravity and the principles of Euclid are to us. From the beginning of modern times our views of nature have been worked out in terms of mathematical physics. The mechani-</page><page sequence="4">112 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIIL cal view of nature received its most general theoretical formula- tion with Descartes, its exact mathematical formulation with New- ton, and its extensive elaboration with subsequent physicists. The general view that nature is a system of things, events and laws operating with mechanical necessity has been the assump- tion underlying nearly all modem scientific inquiry. Whether we think of the ultimate substance of physical existence as homo- geneous matter, or atoms, or ether, or electrons, the more general notion that nature, of whatever it may be composed, is subject to a single system of impersonal causal laws has everywhere pre- vailed. Science in its detail has progressed under the control of this more general view of nature. In this respect the same thing is true of Greek thought. A broad conception of nature may be detected behind the specific advances of philosophic thought. The early philosophers were not the first to establish a view of nature. On the contrary, they thought in terms of a view that already expressed the common inheritance of a traditional past. We may now formulate in the most general way the traditional view of nature. i. Nature is Life. All of the early literary associations of the word Physis are with the phenomena of vitality. To the Greek, nature was alive. The substance of life penetrates all being. The force which manifests itself in the psyche of man is the same force that works and rules in all matter. In fact the whole of Ionian speculation is dominated by the confident belief in the essential unity of man and nature. The basal category is the category of "life". Nature is a living substance which contains within itself the inherent power of absolute life. 2. Nature is Power. Nature, being alive, possesses inherently all the resources necessary for movement, change and growth. It is the self-producing power that creates, preserves and rules the world. The Greeks did not think in terms of such concepts as matter and force. Nature was a substance endowed with the power of self-movement. Whatever is alive moves itself, and what- ever moves itself is alive. No distinction was made between mech- anical force and vital activity. All activity was vital activity. Na-</page><page sequence="5">No. 2.] THE GREEK CONCEPTION OF NATURE I13 ture is a living substance endowed with the power of absolute movement. It is the essence of those things which contain within themselves the power of initiating change. Even in the medical system of Hippocrates the art of the physician is based on the con- ception of Physis as the healing power of nature. 3. Nature is Soul. Self-movement is another name for life. Soul is the very substance of life. This view is so characteristic of both Plato and Aristotle, and the passages in which it is ex- pressed are so well known, that it is unnecessary to quote them. The substance of their views may be summarized as follows. The soul is the inherent substance and principle of life, motion and sense-perception. Whatever is alive or possesses the power of self- movement or perceives, lives and moves and knows by virtue of its psyche. This view is as old as Homer. Soul is a substantial part of nature, or what is the same thing, what we call psycho- logy and physics are treated by the Greeks as different aspects of one reality. Man and nature comprise a single order. 4. Nature is divine. Here we meet what is perhaps the most important aspect of the Greek conception of nature. In modern times the most severe intellectual conflicts have arisen over the rival claims of science and religion. For the most part scientific conceptions of nature have been so framed as to leave no room for a religious interpretation of the world. Naturalism has claimed that physical reality is all there is, and that it is impersonal and everywhere subject to the law of causal- ity. On this view, we have contrasted 'natural' with 'supernatural', 'scientific' with 'theological', and 'physical' with 'mental'. Now so far as I know, with the possible exception of Anaxagoras, no con- flict ever arose among the Greeks between science and religion. The reason for this lies in the fact that for the Greek "the divine encloses the whole of nature". Thus writes Plato: And of the stars too, and of the moon, and of the years and months and seasons, must we not say in like manner, that since a soul or souls having every part of excellence are the causes of all of them, those souls are Gods, whether they are living beings and reside in bodies, and in this way order the whole heaven, or whatever be the place and mode of their existence;-and will any one who admits all this venture to deny that all things are full of Gods?2 2Laws 899b. Jowett's translation.</page><page sequence="6">I14 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIII. That nature is divine is, according to Aristotle, the one fact about the views of his predecessors that stands out in undisputed clearness. He writes: Our forefathers in the most remote ages have handed down to us their posterity a tradition, in the form of a myth, that these substances are gods and that the divine encloses the whole of nature. The rest of the tradition has been added later in mythical form with a view to the persuasion of the multitude and to its legal and utilitarian expediency; they say these gods are in the form of men or like some of the other animals, and they say other things consequent on and similar to these which we have mentioned. But if we were to separate the first point from these additions and take it alone-that they thought the first substances to be gods, we must regard this as an inspired utterance, and reflect that, while probably each art and science has often been developed as far as possible and has again perished, these opinions have been preserved until the present, like relics of the ancient treasure. Only thus far, then, is the opinion of our ancestors and our earliest predecessors clear to us.' It should be remembered, too, that with Aristotle theology is the crowning work of metaphysics. God is the principle on which "depend the heavens and the whole of nature". These passages are so conclusive and the place assigned to God in the physical system of both Plato and Aristotle is so prominent that I can- not understand how anyone can treat the Milesians as scientists who rejected all theological ideas, without affirming a total dis- continuity in what is otherwise a continuous development. The concept of the "divine", of course, underwent marked change. In the beginning the "divine" was an attribute of "nature", and "na- ture" was thought of as wholly corporeal. In the progress of thought, and especially as the idea of the immaterial emerges, the "divine" is separated off and with Aristotle becomes, not a part of nature, but that which "encloses the whole of nature". This phrase refers, as I take it, to the sphere of the First Heaven, which encircles the world. Greek philosophy of nature begins with the divine. It also ends with the divine. In the system of the Stoics the divine pneuma is the soul of the world. To call Thales a "philosopher, who has quietly rejected all the myths about the gods and theogonies" is to violate the spirit of the whole Ionian tradition. We may, if we "Meta. I074b i seq. All of the quotations from Aristotle that appear in this essay are taken from the Oxford translation. "Ibid. Io72b i4.</page><page sequence="7">No. 2.] THE GREEK CONCEPTION OF NATURE 115 like, say that Thales adopted a naturalistic type of explanation, for water is certainly one of the visible elements of the natural order, but when we remember that the word physics is suffused with meanings that cut across all dualisms, we may just as well say that his explanation is supernatural. When we speak of the Greeks as naturalists, we must remember that for them nature is Substance, Life, Power, Soul, and God. When they thought of physis as divine, the word carried the meaning of a master con- cept, the concept of an impersonal power, eternal and imperish- able, capable of generating out of its own assertive energy all the things that come to be. 5. Nature is Value. Natural power is so conceived that it is everywhere worthy of trust. Fidelity to nature is the essence of the Greek spirit. Nature is the model of all excellence and the pat- tern of all perfection. Thus Purpose, Law and Value have a nat- ural basis. All distinctions between higher and lower, better and worse, are drawn in strict conformity with antecedent demarca- tions. According to Heraclitus, the dry soul is not only wisest, but is also best. The Greek liked his world neat. Nothing offended him more than seeing things out of place. Rightness of place was grounded in the order of natural happenings. Things are in place when they are where nature intended they should be. Nature sifts, arranges and distributes things in her own way, and nature's way is the right way. Effrontery, the cardinal Greek vice, consists in over- stepping one's natural limit. In Plato the lines of cleavage that mark the bases for definition and division, the ordering of classes in society, the distinction between the parts of the soul, the hier- archy of pleasures and of intellectual operation and of kinds of being, are drawn in accordance with nature. This view is so characteristic of Aristotle that Santayana has expressed his meta- physics in a simple brilliant formula: "Everything ideal has a natural basis, and everything natural has an ideal fulfilment." That nature is a vehicle of Value as well as of Power is the foundation of the Stoic doctrine of life "according to nature". I have no doubt that Stoic metaphysics is a continuation of the older Greek view of nature as a moral, purposeful, rational, divine or- der. With this general statement of the meaning of nature, let us</page><page sequence="8">ii6 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIII. now turn to the extant records. I shall select for illustration Hesiod, Thales, Anaximenes, Heraclitus and Aristotle. It is my belief, however, that allowing for such modifications as we should naturally expect from a people as intellectually active as the Greeks, the whole of Greek thought adheres to certain very gen- eral attitudes and conceptions. I believe this to be true specifically of Ionian thought, and in a general way of Pythagoras, Plato and Democritus, although I shall not be able to include them in this paper. The earliest recorded beginnings of natural philosophy among the Greeks are found in the cosmology of Hesiod. The following is a brief summary. At the very beginning (protista) Chaos was. At the foundation of things lies a simple, impersonal, natural existence, Chaos, the yawning abyss. And then (autar epeita) Earth was, and Tartarus and Eros (Love). Of the relation of these natural existences to Chaos, nothing can be asserted other than chronological sequence. The text does not warrant the inference that Earth, Tartarus and Eros were produced out of Chaos. Whether, therefore, we are to as- sume one cosmogenetic principle, or four such principles, cannot be determined. Hesiod evinces no interest in the controversy that subsequently arose between monism and pluralism. What is cer- tain is that at least three of the above-mentioned existences be- come cosmogenetically active. Out of Chaos (ek Chaeos) came Erebus and Night. Chaos is here viewed as a generative reality capable of producing out of itself other natural existences. These derivative substances are in turn productive of other physical realities. From the marriage of Erebus and Night spring Aether and Day. From Earth came Heaven, the mountains, and the sea, and subsequently from the marriage of Earth with Heaven came Oceanus, the deep-swirling river that encircles the earth. The later portions of the Theogony deal with the generation of various personified forces and with the genealogy of the personal gods. In this brief outline of Hesiod the one all-important point to</page><page sequence="9">No. 2.] THE GREEK CONCEPTION OF NATURE 117 note is the distinction between cosmology, dealing with the genera- tion of the physical forces and realities of nature, and theogony, dealing with the genealogy of the personal gods. Cosmology pre- cedes theogony. The Olympian gods did not create the world. They govern the world after it has been created by natural forces. The natural world is older than the gods who rule it. This is a view from which subsequent Greek thought never departed. I know of no Greek thinker who ever held to a doctrine of divine creation ex nihilo. The priority of natural existences to the rule of the gods was noted by Aristotle: "And the old poets agree with this inasmuch as they say that not those who are first in time, e.g., Night and Heaven or Chaos or Ocean, reign and rule, but Zeus."" We may now pass to the philosophers. The task which the Ionians set for themselves was twofold. It was, in the first place, to say what "nature" was. The first philosophers did not discover "nature". They all knew in a general way that "nature" was the divine source of power, life and movement. What the early philo- sophers did was to identify "nature" with some particular and definite thing and thus to give to it a concrete definition. Thales said it was "water". Anaximenes said it was "air". Heraclitus said it was "fire". Although they differ as to what the cosmogenetic principle is, they agree that it is divine, self-active and endowed with the power of generating out of itself "all the heavens and all the worlds within them". Thus Aristotle: "If we look at the ancients, physics would seem to be concerned with the matter."6 "Consequently, some assert earth, others fire or air or water or some or all of these, to be the nature of the things that are. . . This then is one account of 'nature', namely that it is the immediate ma- terial substratum of things which have in themselves a principle of motion or change."" I think there can be no doubt that Aristotle is right in interpreting the "nature" of the early Greek philosophers as a material cause, but we must not fail to ascribe to this origina- tive substance all the fructifying and generative powers consonant with absolute power, vitality, mentality and divinity. The explana- tion of every physical change is vested in the inherent capacities of material substance. 'Meta. i09ib 4. 'Phys. ig4a 20. TIbid. I93a 2i seq.</page><page sequence="10">ii8 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIII. The second task is to describe the cosmogenetic process. The details will differ in accordance with the limitations imposed by the selection of a generative substance. All of the Greeks are agreed in the belief that the world has passed through a process of cosmic evolution. With the interest of men of science, although at a time before science had become detached from religion, they speculate about what has happened in the course of world-evolu- tion. What they do is to begin with one or more cosmogenetic substances and proceed to describe in broad and general terms the processes by which the world and all that it contains has come into being. The anthropomorphic gods disappear. Their place is taken by "water", "air", or "fire", but these "natural" substances have all the attributes of the ancestral gods. They are impersonal divinities. Is the outcome natural "science" or "theology"? It is neither, and it is both. It is a practical repercussion of theology, and a speculative anticipation of science. Thales said that "water" is the principle of things. Water, there- fore, is to be identified with "nature". We have only to ascribe to it the qualities already assigned to "nature" to render the mean- ing clear. Water is the living substance of which all things consist. All physical, vital and psychical phenomena are grounded in the natural possibilities of water. As anyone who observes a down- pour of rain may see, water moves itself. What moves itself has soul in it. Soul, therefore, is diffused throughout the universe. The gods disappear, but "nature" is "divine". "Just as our soul being air holds us together, so do breath and air encompass the whole world." This fragment from Anaximenes expresses a theoretical point of view which persisted throughout the whole of subsequent Greek thought. What is here expressed in broad and comprehensive language is the speculative hypothesis that both man and nature are subject to the same animating and vivifying forces. The imaginative vision of the essential unity of man and nature more than any other single idea inspired the whole of Ionian thought. The Greek conception of "nature" is further clarified in the cosmology of Heraclitus. Fire is the first principle. It is a divine substance endowed with every power necessary for cosmogenesis. The details of the Heraclitean cosmology are too well known to</page><page sequence="11">No. 2.] THE GREEK CONCEPTION OF NATURE II9 be repeated here. However, there is one point that should be men- tioned. The maintenance of balance in the process of give and take gives rise to the concept of law and order. All change is orderly change; all transition is measured transition; all opposition is balanced opposition. Thus law, order and harmony are grounded in the objective order of nature. The psychology of Heraclitus is inseparably bound up with his cosmology. The drama of physical change is re-enacted on the stage of human life, thus repeating in the human soul the opera- tions that occur in the physical world. The same force that pene- trates all matter manifests itself in man. Nature's psyche and man's psyche are the same. The soul of man is a fragment of the universal fiery energy that appears in the universe at large. Man is the universe in miniature. Evaporations and exhalations have their counterpart in the meteorology of the soul. One remark should be made that applies not only to Heraclitus but to Greek psychology in general. Explanation of psychological phenomena consists merely in a description of the conditions un- der which perception takes place. So far as I know, no Greek undertook to explain consciousness. Psychology consists in the effort to place the elementary facts of perception and cognition in an intelligible connection with the antecedent conditions with which they are continuous. Perception is, therefore, a natural event. The energies of thought are identical with the energies flowing through the uni- verse. The organs of sense are the instruments by which these energies are utilized for cognitive purposes. Just as man in the vital act of respiration is in physical relation to an atmosphere which envelopes and sustains him, so in the rational act of per- ceiving and knowing he is in relation with the substance of reason which permeates the objective order of nature. Reason is identi- fied with fire. Man lives a rational life just to the extent that the fiery element enters into him. Wisdom is lusty living; stupidity is a mark of low vitality. Thus all humanistic distinctions are dis- tinctions which follow lines already drawn in "nature". "The dry soul is wisest and best." Both knowledge and virtue are meteorological phenomena. "It is pleasure to souls to become moist." Pleasure arises at that point at which the fire of the soul is</page><page sequence="12">120 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VoL. XLIII. transformed into moisture. This transformation involves a degra- dation of being-consequently pleasure is qualitatively inferior to intellect. "It is death to souls to become water." What is here expressed, I think, is the distinction between the animate and the inanimate. There is no psyche in water or earth. They are essen- tially without the power of self-movement, while fire, on the other hand, is all mobility. No Greek ever identified physis with earth. "Souls smell in Hades." In these parts the pure fire of heaven has been transformed into fumid exhalation. Being impure they have sunk to the lowest regions. Under these conditions "smelling" is the only form of contact with an external reality. We now pass to Aristotle's view of nature. His philosophy of nature is the crowning work of Ionian science. "All the things [which exist by nature] present a feature in which they differ from things which are not constituted by nature. Each of them has within itself a principle of motion and of stationariness."8 That is to say, whatever possesses an innate impulse to change belongs to the class of things which exist by nature. No artificial object is self-producing. Hence nature is defined as "a source or cause of being moved and of being at rest in that to which it be- longs primarily."9 Nature is not a substance, but substance has a nature. Nature always implies a subject in which it inheres. Con- sequently, according to Aristotle, all of his predecessors who had identified "nature" exclusively with one or more of the material elements, were wrong. "Nature" is the principle of law, organiza- tion, and production of all those physical things which fall within the sphere of change and becoming. "Nature" is not a thing, but things operate "according to nature". Perhaps no simple words better summarize Aristotle's concep- tion of nature than the word "power". An analysis of nature is an analysis of power. Power is a better word than force because force carries a modern meaning, a meaning that is likely to vanish into a mathematical formula. Aristotle is above all a physical realist. Anyone may understand his physics who possesses the simple-minded faculty of hypostatizing abstractions. Every primary principle is a causa essendi. Consequently scientific 'Phys. 192b 12. 'bid. i92b 22.</page><page sequence="13">No. 2.] THE GREEK CONCEPTION OF NATURE I2I method consists in an advance "from what is more obscure by nature, but clearer to us, towards what is more clear and more knowable by nature".'0 The problem of physics is the problem of understanding how power operates. Let us first consider its operation in the realm of the inorganic. Power cannot be reduced to a single principle. No form of physical monism is tenable. To posit one originative prin- ciple is to deny the possibility of science. We must as physical scientists become pluralists. But pluralism takes many forms. Most of the pre-Aristotelian pluralists have reduced their primary principle to two which they set forth in terms of the traditional "contraries". But dualism is likewise untenable, "for it is difficult to see how either density should be of such a nature as to act in any way on rarity or rarity on density. The same is true of any other pair of contraries."" Power is reducible to motion. If one does not understand mo- tion, says Aristotle, he cannot understand nature. The reduction of power to motion suggests materialism and mechanism. But neither of these views, according to Aristotle, is able to give any satisfactory account of change and becoming. Change in any real sense involves an absolute qualitative transformation of material. The operation of power must be so conceived that such ultimate qualitative change is possible. It is here that Aristotle departs widely from Plato. Plato had started in the direction of mathe- matical physics, and attempted to reduce all quality to the mathe- matical properties of the elements. In Aristotle quality has the same metaphysical status as quantity, and so far as a philosophy of nature is concerned, is of greater explanatory value. The "rare" and the "dense", the "heavy" and the "light", the "dry" and the "moist" are fundamental concepts in physical science. In the oper- ation of power things borrow and lend their detachable qualities. Change is a qualitative exchange and is, therefore, one of nature's operations. The primacy of quality as a scientific point of departure, the transformation of the elements from one form into another, the rejection of atomism and mechanism, and the affirmation of pur- 10Phys. i84a 20. " Ibid. I8ga 22.</page><page sequence="14">I22 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIII. pose as an ultimate concept of scientific explanation, are the out- standing features of Aristotle's philosophy of the inorganic. Let us now turn to his conception of life and mind. His treatise on Meteorology opens as follows: We have already discussed the first causes of nature, and all natural motion [i.e., the Physics], also the stars ordered in the motion of the heavens [i.e., the De Caelo], and the physical elements-enumerating and specifying them and showing how they change into one another- and becoming and perishing in general [i.e., the De Gen. et Corr.]. There remains for consideration a part of this inquiry which all our predecessors called meteorology.... When the inquiry into these mat- ters is concluded let us consider what account we can give, in accord- ance with the method we have followed, of animals and plants, both generally and in detail. When that has been done we may say that the whole of our original undertaking will have been carried out." From this passage it is perfectly evident that biology and psychology are to be treated as parts of the general philosophy of nature. Physics, astronomy, meteorology, psychology and biology are all parts of a single inquiry and are treated by a common method of investigation. Aristotle's philosophy of nature supplies the details of the general speculative anticipation of Anaximenes, namely, that psychology and cosmology have a common basis. Taking Ionian science as a whole, one of its outstanding traits is the persistent attempt to incorporate the philosophies of life, mind and nature within a single type of inquiry, and to explain the three modes of being in terms of the same fundamental principles. Let us now see how biology and psychology are treated as parts of a single order of natural existence. It cannot be said that all nature is alive. The four elements are not living bodies, and there are many inorganic bodies compounded of the elements. What distinguishes living from non-living things is the presence in them of soul. If we leave out of account the active intellect in man, which is most certainly not a part of nature, all of the re- maining functions of the soul fall within the field of natural sci- ence. Just why the active intellect should be viewed as something which "comes in as through a door from without", I cannot say. It would be my guess that Aristotle wishes to identify the highest part of the soul with the "divine". In so far as the rational soul 12Meteor. 338-339a.</page><page sequence="15">No. 2.] THE GREEK CONCEPTION OF NATURE I23 is "divine", man can, in the exercise of reason, imitate the life of God. But let us return to Aristotle's biology and psychology. How are life and mind viewed as parts of "nature"? Each individual living thing is a substance. Every substance has a nature, an inner direct- ing power that governs every change. Soul is the nature of living things. It is that according to which every animate existence dis- plays its activity. Soul is the power behind every vital activity- nutrition, growth, sensation and thought. Vitality is the power which soul communicates to body; all living functions are enmat- tered powers. This may be expressed in another way. Every substance has a dual aspect. It is a combination of matter and form. The reason we pronounce certain conformation of materials "living" is be- cause "form" at that stage of embodiment exhibits superior direct- ing power. It is the business of the physicist to study enmattered form wherever he finds it. Any separation of matter and form, where they are inseparable in existence, leads to abstraction. I should like to quote a passage from the De Anima which seems to me to be of tremendous significance. Consequently their definitions ought to correspond, e.g. anger should be defined as a certain mode of movement of such and such a body (or part or faculty of a body) by this or that cause and for this or that end. That is precisely why the study of the soul must fall within the science of Nature, at least so far as in its affections it manifests this double character. Hence a physicist would define an affection of soul differently from a dialectician; the latter would define e.g. anger as the appetite for returning pain for pain, or something like that, while the former would define it as a boiling of the blood or warm substance surrounding the heart. The latter assigns the material conditions, the former the form or formulable essence; for what he states is the formulable essence of the fact, though for its actual existence there must be embodiment of it in a material such as is described by the other. Thus the essence of a house is assigned in such a formula as "a shelter against destruction by wind, rain, and heat"; the physicist would describe it as "stones, bricks and timbers"; but there is a third possible description which would say that it was that form in that ma- terial with that purpose or end. Which, then, among these is entitled to be regarded as the genuine physicist? The one who confines himself to the material, or the one who restricts himself to the formulable essence alone? Is it not rather the one who combines both in a single formula?' "De Anima 403a 25 seq.</page><page sequence="16">124 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW From this passage it is clear that psychological phenomena are expressions of form embodied in matter. Sensation and emotion are modes of movement which differ from other forms of move- ment only in their superior definiteness of purpose. The Greeks had no word in their language capable of expressing the idea of will. Voluntas, which occurs so frequently in Latin, is a Roman conception, but not Greek. This is significant. Aristotle's psycho- logy is what we should call behavioristic. The idea of will implies a non-natural power capable of influencing natural movement from without. To formulate such a conception would be fatal to the whole Aristotelian point of view. It would destroy the unity of man and nature. I suspect that dualism has its origin partly in the psychology of will and is traceable on the one hand to the Roman emphasis upon Voluntas as a quality of character and on the other to the Christian emphasis upon choice as determining the destiny of the soul. Modern thought has departed widely from the Aristotelian con- ception of the essential unity of man and nature. Descartes set up a dualism with physics on the one side and psychology and logic on the other. It is essentially a dualism between mechanical and purposeful activity. Following Descartes we have given the physicist the exclusive right to define nature, leaving the psycho- logist and logician to deal with what the physicist rejected. When this dualism has been rigidly applied, physics has become a skele- ton, psychology the miracle of immaculate conception, and sym- bolic logic a mere menu card. And we say that Aristotle ruined science. Is it not rather that science ruined Aristotle? M. T. MCCLURE THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS</page></plain_text>
