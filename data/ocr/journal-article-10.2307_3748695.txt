<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CONCEPT OF EVOLUTION' A. R. MANSER THERE appears to be a wide measure of agreement, both amongst biologists and others, that Darwin's theory of evolution marks a major breakthrough in the science of biology; Darwin has even been called 'Biology's Newton', the highest term of praise that could be bestowed on a scientist. A. G. N. Flew, considering the matter from a philosophical point of view, says: 'Yet one of the most important of all scientific theories is that developed by Darwin in his Origin of Species. Covering the entire range of biological pheno- mena its scope is enormous. While if any scientific theory is interest- ing philosophically this one is.'2 In spite of the testimony of both biologists and philosophers of science to the importance of the theory, it does not appear to play anything like the same role in biology as does Newton's theory in physics. For modern physics would be impossible without Newton's laws or relativistic modifications of them; f = ma is an equation which is bound to crop up in almost all attempts to deal with the external world in a physical manner. Many of the places where biology is advancing bear no relation to the theory of evolution, and a large number of biological papers involve no reference to Darwin or to modifications of this theory. Nevertheless most biologists would state that they accepted, and regarded as important, what is commonly called the theory of evolution; scepticism is rare. Some biologists will admit that one of the strongest motives leading them to accept the theory is the lack of any genuine alternative. Lamarkianism is suggested from time to time, but most scientists in the field would regard it as experi- mentally disproved, though possibly on not very adequate evidence. Special Creation is not often suggested nowadays, and in any case would seem to be ruled out because no experimental test could be devised for it; hence it does not appear to be a genuine scientific theory. Thus from the time it was propounded, Darwinism has never had to deal with serious scientific opposition. This is in itself an important fact about the theory, for one of the points that I wish to 'An earlier version of this paper was delivered to the Royal Institute of Philo- sophy on Friday, 29th November, 1963. Another version was read to The Univer- sity of Leicester Philosophical Society. Some revisions were made in the light of the discussions at these meetings, and I would like to thank those who contri- buted to the discussions. I would also like to thank Professor W. T. Williams, of the Department of Botany, University of Southampton, for many discussions on the topics dealt with here. He is, however, in no way responsible for any of the views expressed.

(It might be argued that the same applies to Newton's laws, that they are definitions of force, etc. Without going into this question, I will merely say that the sense in which Darwin's theory appears to be irrefutable is a quite particular one which I will explain in the course of this paper.) One of the difficulties in dealing with the concept of evolution is that nowadays the word 'evolution' itself is often taken to mean Darwin's theory unless some explicit qualification is added. Darwin himself, as the title of his work implied, was concerned with the origin of species; the originality of his book lay in the fact that he proposed a mechanism whereby new species could be formed from existing ones without invoking a deus ex machina from outside the process. Most modern adherents would go further than Darwin did to suggest that all living things originated from some primeval form, and, in some cases, to maintain that this form itself arose from non- living matter. Whether any such event took place on the surface of the earth, or whether this original form was created by some being outside this world, need not make any difference to the rest of the account. (Though of course it may; in general creationists want also to argue that there was some further direction of the process, either by interference with it, or by the endowment of living matter, or perhaps all matter, with special properties that made development inevitable. I only wish to point out that there is no necessary connection between life having been started on this earth by some- thing outside it and the rest of the development being due to a non- teleological process of evolution.) But most evolutionists now use the word in a wider way than Darwin did; his theory has been generalised to cover the field of all levels of living things, the origin and diversification of life into species, genera, families, etc. In this sense a recent writer starts his book on evolution by saying: 'The main unifying idea in biology is Darwin's theory of evolution through natural selection'.' The reference to 'species' has been dropped; the theory being advanced might thus be called the 'General Theory of Evolution', in contrast to Darwin's 'Special Theory'.2 It is worth adding that the majority of evidence adduced for the theory is normally for the 'Special Theory'; little is known about the origin of genera and higher orders. Even if we refer to the modern view as a 'General Theory of Evolution', the term is still not entirely appropriate, for strictly a 'theory of evolution' should only state that living creatures have come 'J. M. Smith, The Theory of Evolution, Pelican Books, 1958, p. 11. 2I take this terminology from G. Kerkut, Implications of Evolution, Pergamon, 1960, p. 157. 19</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHY into being as the result of changes in earlier forms; the word 'evolution' was in use long before Darwin to express the idea of the development of one thing out of another. Basically such a theory can be completely neutral as to how such changes take place; it is no error to talk of the 'evolution of the motor car', or, in an example of 1807 used by the Oxford English Dictionary, the 'evolution of the British Constitution'. As I have said, Darwin's important contri- bution was to suggest a mechanism for such changes in the case of species. It is to some modification of his hypothesis on this count that the words 'Theory of Evolution' are now generally taken to refer. It is perhaps not entirely accidental that people have come to talk of Darwin's achievement in this general way, so it is no verbal quibble to stress that we should refer to Darwin's 'Theory of Natural Selec- tion', which would serve to distinguish it from Lamark's theory, or from other similar theories. I do not think that it detracts from Darwin's greatness to empha- sise that the search for an account that would fit the observed facts was going on at the time he was working on his theory. Indeed, Wallace produced substantially the same hypothesis at the same time as Darwin did. Confusion about what Darwin and Wallace did is often shown by writers who attribute an anticipation of Darwin's theory to any previous scientists or philosopher who asked questions about how it came to be that there were numerous species existing in the world. It is possible to see the theory of the 'Great Chain of Being' as evolutionary in content, particularly when it is viewed from our present standpoint of acceptance of evolution. But in general closer studies of such 'anticipations' will show that they were very different from what we now accept. Even a temporalisation of the Great Chain of Being is not evolutionary, for it still involves a belief in the fixity of species, only suggesting that different ones appear on earth at different times; what it fails to do is to talk of one species becoming a different one in time. Darwin himself mentions that the majority of his contemporaries in the field of biology regarded species as fixed. Consequently, when his account was published, the battle was at least partially between those who regarded species as fixed and those who believed in their formation in time, their 'evolution'. Hence Darwin and evolution became popularly connected, to the detriment of clear thinking about the subject. There are many peculiar aspects of the Darwinian synthesis which require examination, though I intend to argue that most of them are connected. First, there is its enormous impact on the thought of the day, which to us seems out of proportion to what is to be expected from the publication of a scientific theory. Gertrude Himmelfarb, in Darwin and the Darwinian Revolution, suggests that this 20</page><page sequence="4">THE CONCEPT OF EVOLUTION was partly due to the fact that the theory had been expected: 'For what they were experiencing was not the shock of discovery, but rather the shock of recognition. They were so quickly converted, because there was so little to be converted to. And those who chose not to be converted were also quick in their responses; they knew instantly where to direct their attacks, because they had long been mobilised for just such a threat." Even so, the religion reaction need not have been so violent; most contemporary Christians are quite prepared to accept gradual evolution rather than special creation. Even the later suggestion of a connection between man and monkey need not have aroused such passions; a hundred years earlier Buffon had emphasised the nearness of the two species without creating offence. Buffon, it might be argued, defended himself by stating that into one of the species God had breathed His Divine Spirit, but such a resource was, and still is, open to the convinced Theist. I suspect that one reason for the violence of the religious reaction was the suggested mechanism of evolution, rather than the idea of evolution itself. For, as can be seen from the phrase that became popular currency, one of the important elements in Darwin's theory was, to Victorian minds, the notion of the 'struggle for existence'. (Indeed, the phrase was Spencer's, though Darwin accepted it.) That this notion should have seemed to embody the central thesis of Darwin's account is no accident; various writers have pointed out that Darwin's thought owed much to the economic and political thought of the day. Radl says of him: 'He looked at the living world from the point of view of the political economists. ... It is impossible to understand why Darwin influenced the sociolo- gical theorists so profoundly, unless we realise that his whole teaching really constitutes a sociology of Nature, and that Darwin merely transferred the prevailing English political ideas and applied them to Nature.'2 In fact the Darwinian struggle between species (or individual members of a species) was like that between Victorian firms; the efficient survived and made profits, the inefficient went bankrupt or 'died out'. (It is no accident that Darwin and Wallace arrived at their views by reading Malthus, and that Marx wanted to dedicate the English translation of Capital to Darwin.) Though this connection between the economic ideas of the time and the form of the theory has been noted, it seems to me that its importance has not been sufficiently considered. For the difference between a firm and a species is that the former is a conscious organisation dedicated to expanding and making a bigger profit, whereas a species has no "op. cit., p. 370. 2History of Biological Theories, p. 18. 21</page><page sequence="5">PHILOSOPHY objective. Darwin's theory is generally claimed to be non-teleolo- gical. But the very criterion of success in the 'struggle for existence', survival and/or expansion, seems to put a teleological notion back into the centre of evolutionary thought. This explains why it is generally assumed that evolution is in an 'upward' direction, that new species are an improvement on the old. A priori there seems no reason why the criterion of evolutionary success should not be persistence in an original form. In human terms we might consider a mechanism that was simple and reliable, not needing modifications, to be better than one which needed them constantly. By a trans- ference of Victorian economic thought it came to be believed that the more species that there were (the more varieties of goods that were produced) the better was the total state of affairs. I am not suggesting that this anthropomorphism is necessarily involved in Darwin's theory itself, or that Darwin must have thought in these terms; all I claim is that this was one of the elements that made the theory acceptable both to scientists and to laymen. This is because the notion of a 'desire for success' or for expansion seemed to provide an adequate driving force for the process of evolution, to reintroduce a hidden teleology in such a way that those who held the theory could affirm its mechanistic nature whilst at the same time thinking in ways that were not so different from those of genuine teleologists. Modern statistical studies of the evolutionary process may well have removed some of the desire to have a 'life-force' to keep the process going, but even now it is clear that many biologists have to make a conscious effort to prevent themselves from lapsing into such a mode of thought or expression. From a historical point of view, it seems likely that many of the non-scientific supporters of Darwin would have been less willing to accept the theory if this prop had not been available. Evidence for this is given by the spread of 'evolution' into many different fields of thought after its first application to biology. How far such considerations were of impor- tance to actual scientists is less clear. What I am concerned to point out is the ambiguity which can be found in Darwinian thought. This is exemplified in the following quotation, though the provision of 'scare-quotes' shows that the writer is aware of the dangers of what he is saying: 'If we consider the general shape of the animal body and its various transformations, we shall arrive at the following conclusion: the multitude of different transformations gives the definite impression that "undirected" differentiation has "tried" all possible forms in the genera and families'.' Whether the writer was misled by teleological notions is not important; the fact that such ways of describing the phenomena are possible is evidence of the kind of ambiguity I am describing. There has, of course, been a great 'B. Rensch, Evolution above the Species Level, Methuen 1959, pp. 62-3. 22</page><page sequence="6">THE CONCEPT OF EVOLUTION deal of biological work in the field which is not marked by this feature, for instance the statistical work of geneticists. But even scientists working at this level appear to be tempted to talk in terms analogous to those used in the last quotation when they descend to a more popular level. A longer quotation from the work just cited will bring out more clearly the point I am making: 'Fundamentally similar to this biological process is the development following the invention of an engine. After the internal combustion engine had been invented, an array of most diversified "structural types" was developed in adaptation to various kinds of "habitats"; motor cars, motor ships, tractors, agricultural machines and aeroplanes. In much the same way various structural types such as bats, hoofed animals, carnivores, whales and so forth, evolved once the principles of homoiothermy and more complicated central nervous systems had been "invented". In both cases, the evolution of quite different structural types was a consequence not only of invention of a superior and more efficient mechanism, but also of the presence of various types of habitats that could be filled in by types progressively adapting themselves by mutation and selection." What is remarkable about this quotation is not that it talks of the 'evolution' of the internal combustion engine which, as I remarked above, seems quite in order, but that it makes such a detailed comparison between the natural and the artificial. If we look at the phenomena in a biological way, it certainly seems possible to talk of the 'explosive radiation' of the internal combustion engine. It is produced in a wide range of sizes, the limits at each end of the scale being determined by the dimensions at which mechanical factors make it impossible or most inefficient to operate. In some applications it is so advantageous that it rapidly ousts the competing forms, as in road transports; in others, where the advantage is less, the older types survive alongside the new for some time, as in sea and rail transport. There are even 'niches' where it cannot penetrate and where the older types of transport survive, for example in very mountainous regions of those isolated, perhaps economically rather than geographically, from the main areas of its successes. And if we descend to the level of 'species' of internal combustion engines, it is possible to find other features which are very similar to those which occur in organic evolution, for instance the survival of vestigial organs, those which were once useful to the 'species' but are now no longer so. One such example is the bonnet design of the Daimler car; the original models had a finned radiator tank to increase cooling capacity. When, with improved design of other components, this was no longer necessary, lop. cit., p. 279. 23</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHY it did not disappear, but remained as a vestigial organ, no longer used in any mechanical way, but serving to differentiate the car from other makes. Similar examples could be found in other mechanical spheres. Indeed, to someone who knew nothing of the way in which human choice had dictated every change, a motor museum might appear indistinguishable from a natural history museum.1 The history of technology, or indeed of any human institution, tends to be a history of success; the devices that are considered worthy of remark are those which made an important contribution or which persisted for a long time, the unsuccessful ones were quickly weeded out or failed to spread. To a limited extent this is true of biological evolution; the species alive today are obviously relatively successful. It might be thought that the fossil record would also be mainly of successful species, those which were widespread at the time of fossilisation. But because the conditions under which an organism becomes fossilised are stringent, it is probable that the record is not representative; minor species with a suitable habitat will frequently have been preserved, whilst more common species living in conditions which were unfavourable for fossilisation would leave no record. In any case, from the species existing at a particular time it is not possible to predict what species will develop in the future; at least I know of no biologist who would claim that this is possible. Similarly, the account of the state of technology at a particular date does not enable us to predict what will be important in the future. To look at a popular or semi-popular account of technology in the days before the last war is to find a large number of ideas for new developments which came to nothing, and perhaps those that are now really significant being ignored or relegated to a minor paragraph. All had to be tried out, at the time seemed viable notions, though to us, with our hindsight of what was to be really useful, they may seem merely quaint. From the point of view of the present there may appear to be clear line of development because we know what was to become successful. We can thus produce an account of what has happened without having been in a position to predict what would happen. This is particularly clear in the case of discoveries and inventions, for here to predict the next step is in fact to make it; once the discovery has been made, it may appear the 'One conclusion that could be drawn from this type of example would be that the course of evolution had been directed, not by an omniscient Deity, but rather by a demiurge of great power who occasionally had an original idea and who, when- ever he did, made the most of it by applying it in all possible fields. Human technology and biological evolution both seem to progress in a series of 'leaps' with each new discovery diffusing rapidly. 24</page><page sequence="8">THE CONCEPT OF EVOLUTION obvious one, as Miss Himmelfarb claims Darwin's theory was for many of his contemporaries. A historical account of the development of anything is not the same as a scientific account which would have predictive power, and whose reliability would be tested by its success in prediction. The way in which an evolutionary account of the development of a species is similar to the kind of history I have just been discussing can be seen by examining a detailed case, called by one writer 'Perhaps the most striking and longest known example of evolutionary changes . . ." This is the development of dark or 'melanic' varieties of moths in some heavily industrialised areas. Certain species are generally light in colour, though occasionally a black form will emerge. There is some evidence that the dark form is more vigorous, though in most habitats this had not led to its replacing the light one. 'But beginning in the middle of the nineteenth century, the dark varieties have been recorded as occurring more and more often, especially in the vicinity of large industrial centres. In many indus- trial regions the incidence of the dark varieties has grown rapidly from decade to decade; some of the populations now consist of dark individuals, with or without an admixture of light ones.'2 The accepted explanation of the change is that normally the light forms are camouflaged against the light-coloured trunks of trees, whereas dark ones are conspicuous on the bark, and so more likely to be taken by predators. Hence they are less likely to survive in spite of their greater vigour. But where industrialisation has blackened the trunks, the light-coloured become more conspicuous, and so more likely to be taken. Hence more of the black survive to breed and the popu- lation eventually changes from light to dark. There is now a 'selection pressure' against the light moths, and if it were not for the fortunate occurrence of the dark mutation the species would be in danger of being wiped out in industrial areas. The species is thus 'adaptable' and will survive a change which would have eliminated a less adaptable one. The new, melanic, form can be called fitter than the original light one. (It is, of course, possible to set up a mathematical model of such a process and calculate the measure of superiority of one form for it to oust the other, but this is only a model and introduces no new features into the account.) The account itself is only a description in slightly theory-laden terms which gives the illusion of an explanation in the full scientific sense. If no mutant forms had occurred and the species had become extinct as a result of the change of circumstances, it would not have been adaptable. We cannot use the account to predict what will 'T.

All we can do is, after there has been time for the state of affairs to become stable again, say whether the species in question was or was not adaptable. As had been pointed out, there can be no independent criterion of fitness or adaptability; survival and adaptability or fitness are necessarily connected. Of course, in some cases our own standards may intrude; human beings, like rats, can flourish in a great variety of different environments, whereas some animals are tied to a narrow niche in the ecology. But if the niche remains undisturbed for a long period of time, there seems no reason for calling them unfit, however bizarre the condi- tions may be. From a purely biological point of view there seems no reason why species that have survived over a very long period indeed, such as the coelocanth and sphenodon, should not be considered as fit as others that have colonised a wider variety of environments. It is sometimes argued that species that have little variation are unfit because if there were a change in their environment they would be less likely to survive than those with a greater variation, and hence that persistence unchanged over long periods of time is evidence of unfitness. Here there seems to be an appeal to teleological notions, a 'Be Prepared' motto for species. In any case, the evidence from the past would seem to be that in the long run all species die out. As in the case of 'adaptation', other key terms of the theory, such as 'variation' and 'environment', suffer from circular definitions. It often has to be pointed out to elementary students of biology that the latter term refers to what constitutes the environment from the point of view of the organism in question, not from our own. If a species which has been relatively constant in numbers starts to decline without there being any obvious external cause such as human depredations, the explanations may be sought in a change in the environment. This change is only postulated because there has been a change in numbers, or in some other aspect of the popula- tion. In the melanism example, if it had not been for the change from light-coloured to dark-coloured forms, no one would have noticed that the blackening of the trees in some areas constituted a change in environment for the species. What is to be counted as a change in the environment depends on a change in the population; here again no independent definition is possible, and thus no explanation is provided by using the term. The term 'mutation' has slightly more content, for it refers to a discrete change, and hence is preferred by biologists to the original 'variation' used by Darwin. But the lack of any greater content has been noticed by at least one biologist, who refers to 'the real weak- 26</page><page sequence="10">THE CONCEPT OF EVOLUTION ness of modern evolutionary thought, namely its lack of a complete theory of variation, of the origin of candidature for evolution. It is not enough to say that "mutation" is ultimately the source of all genetical diversity, for that is merely to give the phenomenon a name: mutation is so defined." Professor Medawar is claiming that all that is being said when an organism is described as having undergone a mutation is that some discrete change has taken place. This may be obvious to the observer, as in the melanism example, or may only be detectable by experiment. Having seen this point, Medawar goes on to fall into the same trap: 'What we want, and are very slowly beginning to get, is a comprehensive theory of the forms in which new genetical information comes into being. It may, as I have hinted elsewhere, turn out to be of the nature of nucleic acids and the chromosomal apparatus that they tend spontaneously to proffer genetical variants-genetical solutions of the problem of remaining alive-which are more complex and more elaborate than the immediate occasion calls for.'2 But the fact that nucleic acids 'tend spontaneously to proffer' more complex variants is surely only the fact that mutations occur; the word 'spontaneously' does not add any extra information. (I should add, in parenthesis, that I am not here concerned to criticise Professor Medawar; it is revealing that a biologist of his eminence should make such an error which must be due to the nature of the topic he is discussing.) Hence I think that much of what is said by those who defend the theory of evolution in its present form is only a redescription of the phenomena, though this does not mean that such a redescription was not worth carrying out. It may have a function in simplifying the enormous complexity of organic nature. For the biologist is faced with such a variety of different kinds of organisms, without there being any obvious principles which serve to limit the types that exist or have existed. This proliferation leads naturally to the search for an explanation of this variety. It is certainly true that the theory of evolution does make this complexity easier to grasp, gives us a means of finding our way through the maze. Because the normal scientific way of doing this is to give a causal explanation, the presumption is that such an account is also given by the theory of evolution. But what has rather been done is to produce a terminology in which the phenomena can be set, and at the same time an illusion of explanation. Before developing this point in more detail, it is worth noting some internal difficulties in the theory; I discuss these with some diffi- 'Mind, LXX, No. 277, p. 104. 1 should add that some biologists would find this remark eccentric. 2ibid. 27</page><page sequence="11">PHILOSOPHY dence, not being a biologist. They are not central to my argument, but do serve to reinforce it. The example I have been discussing, and the same applies to other examples of 'evolution in action', only concerns the rise of a new species not radically different from the parent one, and it was in this area that Darwin's investigations were concentrated. It is noteworthy that most examples of evolution that are well-documented, either by contemporary observation or in the fossil record, are of the rise of species that differ little from the old. There are a few cases where the fossil record seems to give a wider picture of the development of species that are radically different from the ancestral form, and it is generally believed that the same mechanisms were operative in such cases. The common account of the origin of the horse is a classic instance; the gradual increase in size, coupled with the reduction in the number of toes actually used for locomotion, seems easily explicable by a series of small mutations. There seem to be sufficient fossil intermediaries to make the record clear. It appears that the story has turned out not to be so simple; Kerkut writes: 'The story of the evolution of the horse has become more and more complex as further material is collected, and instead of a simple family tree the branches have increased in size and complexity till the shape is now more like a bush than a tree'.' The tendency is to feel obliged to assign each new species to a separate genus, so no clear line of descent is visible. It can be argued that, given the fragmentary nature of the fossil record, no more is to be expected. In such a case it should be made clear that it is an act of faith that leads to belief in the applicability of minor mutations to the explanation of major changes. Of course, the time span of human observation is too brief for any major changes to have been observed; we are likely to find examples of new minor species, but unlikely to find examples of radically different types of creature. But Darwin's theory does little to explain how radical changes could have come about; the 'explosive radiation' of very different forms seems hard to account for on the basis of minor variations. A few biologists have even gone so far to claim that there would not have been time for some features, such as the bat's wing, to evolve by normal Mendelian means and the pressure of selection, but that the process would have to have started before the origin of the earth.2 Even though others are convinced that there would have been sufficient time, the fact remains that there appears to be a gap between the evidence for the origin of species and the applica- tion of the theory founded on that evidence to the general origin and evolution of all living things. It is assumed that the mechanisms "Implications of Evolution, p. 149. "cf. Marjorie Grene, 'The Faith of Darwinism', Encounter, Nov. 1959, p. 54. 28</page><page sequence="12">THE CONCEPT OF EVOLUTION that operate in the special case can be extended to the general one, though this, as I have said, looks like an act of faith. One further point, of a wider nature, needs to be mentioned. The term 'evolution' seems to imply a direction, and this has often caused difficulty to holders of the theory. But when we are interested in the evolution of anything it is the finished product which is our starting point, and the question in our minds is how it came into being from forms different from it. Normally it is assumed that these forms are also simpler than the final product, but this is not always the case. Biologists often talk of parasites as 'degenerate' forms of creatures that were once free-living; evolution can be in the direction of greater simplicity, though of course only in a minority of instances, or there would be nothing to explain. The impression of finality or of teleology depends on our temporal standpoint, and on the fact that our own presence on the earth is one of the things to be explained. Hence any account seems to be of an 'upward' tendency. This apparent direction has confused laymen and some biologists ever since Darwin; there are some who are convinced that random mutation is insufficient to account for the rise of the present inhabitants of the earth. One element in such a feeling is undoubtedly that chance is not sufficiently exalted to explain the origin of man, but it involves a misunderstanding of Darwinism. For the attractive- ness of his theory lay in the fact that it was in tune with the kind of explanation given by other sciences and that it was difficult to imagine any kind of directing principle that does not involve direct interference with the process itself. It is hard to understand the notion that it is a property of matter to develop into more complex forms and ultimately into living things. More seriously, it is meaning- less as a hypothesis because no experimental test could be devised for it, even in principle. This is an important reason for the lack of any serious alternative to Darwin's theory, which was mentioned above. Given the complexity of nature, the variety of living organisms, each interacting with a large number of others, then it is likely that only an explanation that introduces randomness will prove satis- factory. The need for randomness to play a vital part in the theory might also be derived from the fact that the units of evolution, species or 'populations', are themselves composed of a large number individuals which are not identical with each other and which are placed in environments that are bound to differ in details. Changes in the environment are, from the point of view of the indivi- duals in it, also random, and so a mechanism of random variation will give the best chance of survival. A direction of variation would only be effective if it were linked with a direction of change in the 29</page><page sequence="13">PHILOSOPHY environment. But once the principle of random variations has been introduced, then the type of explanation that can be given is restricted; prediction on any rational basis becomes impossible, and all that can be done is to give an account of how the present state of affairs was reached. Peirce has suggested a useful analogy: 'Thus if a million players sit down to bet at an even game, since one after another will get ruined, the average wealth of those who remain will perpetually increase. Here is undoubtedly a genuine formula of possible evolution, whether its operation accounts for much or little in the development of animal and vegetable species." In such a case it would be possible, after the event, to say which particular coup had made the fortune of one player, or had ruined another. But because the way the dice or cards fell had no connection with the wealth or any other feature of the players, prediction in any scientific sense would be impossible. We could say that unless a certain player won a round within the next so many he would have to leave the game, or that success in a particular round was the foundation of another's fortune, but this would be all. By stressing the important moments of the game it would be possible to produce a compendious account of what had happened, but nothing like a scientific theory. The various points I have made can now be drawn together to make my central claim; that what the Darwinian theory gives is this type of compendious account rather than what is normally produced by scientists. Hayek has made a similar claim, though he calls the theory of evolution a 'mere explanation of the principle'. Though I agree with much of what he says, I think the name is misleading, for the only principle invoked by the theory is that there was none, that randomness was central. I would rather say that what Darwinism presents is a picture of the process, one which, on account of its simplicity and apparent inclusiveness, is irresistibly attractive both to scientists and laymen. (Its popularity among laymen is one of the remarkable things about the theory, and is it- self significant of the type of account it gives.) The closest example of the kind of activity pursued by Darwin and his followers seems to be that of certain historians; the 'materialist conception of history' springs to mind as an example. Perhaps Darwin should be called 'Biology's Karl Marx' rather than its 'Newton'. In both cases there is a basic picture which seems to render a complex mass of facts comprehensible without giving either the power of control or of prediction. If the latter is taken as a necessary condition of any genuinely scientific theory, then neither can be counted as such. 'Selected Writings, ed.

This failure to explain in the normal scientific sense arises because both biology and history are dealing with the large-scale results of the interaction of a vast number of individual things, all differing in some respects. Animals and plants have an individuality which is denied to the atoms and molecules of physics and chemistry. Indeed, unless living creatures did differ at least in their genetical make-up there would be no possibility of evolution. A further consequence is that the random element I have already mentioned must be built into the system and consequently the events with which the theory is dealing must possess an essential uniqueness, different from the combinations of normal atoms. I think it is true to say that no evolutionist would want to claim that life would follow exactly the same pattern on another world, even though it were based on identical chemical processes. These processes would define some limits, but they would be wide enough to permit of great variation in forms of living creatures. There is a strong temptation to feel that what has happened could not have happened in any other way, but this illusion arises from a belief in the normal methods of science and because the starting point of the account is what exists at present. An example of this is shown by the following quotation from Julian Huxley: 'The biological process culminating for the evolutionary moment in the dominance of Homo sapiens . . . could apparently have pursued no other general course than that which it has historically followed: or, if it be impossible to uphold such a sweeping and universal negative, we may at least say that among the actual inhabitants of the earth, past and present, no other lines could have been taken which would have produced speech and conceptual thought, the features which form the basis for man's biological dominance." The difference between the two claims made in this passage is striking. But because the kind of picture that must be given to make the facts comprehensible seems to rule out alternative lines, it is easy to think that it has shown that things must have happened in precisely this way, i.e. that the results could have been predicted. It is interesting to note that some Marxists have claimed, and others denied, that the materialist conception of history enabled historical predictions to be made. It is quite clear that Darwinism does not warrant real predictions. But it must not be thought that my use of the term 'picture' and the comparison with Marx's theory of history is meant to be in 'Evolution, p. 569. 31</page><page sequence="15">PHILOSOPHY any way derogatory to Darwin and his followers. I am only trying to indicate the logical status of the theory. What is done in both cases is to enable us to 'make sense' out of the happenings, to see and grasp a pattern in the wealth of detail which the subjects provide. But there is no simple test, analogous to that used in physical science, which will enable us to choose between different pictures. In history there are revival candidates, but it is still possible to hold the materialist conception and difficult to see how it could be decisively refuted. Similarly it is difficult to see how Darwin's theory could be shown to be false. It might be possible to produce evidence, it has been suggested, that would refute him; an example would be the discovery of fossil Homo sapiens in geologically early strata. I suspect that the first reaction to such a discovery would be to try and undermine the facts in some way; if a theory is firmly believed in a great amount of apparently contradictory evidence can be explained away or ignored. If this were unavailing, a new line of descent for the species could probably be traced. If no such resource were available, then the fixity of species would have to be restored. But it should be noted that the only way of attacking Darwin's theory is by attacking the whole idea of changing species in time: there appears to be no evidence that would demolish Darwin whilst retaining the idea of evolution itself. The case of the Russian revival of Lamarkism is interesting here; at first Lysenko's observations were attacked as completely erroneous, and his suggestions dismissed as inspired by ideology. Now that some of his observations, though by no means all, have been confirmed and similar instances found by western researchers, there is no inclination in the west to dismiss Darwin in favour of Lamark; biologists are confident that they can assimilate these findings to their theory. The apparent irrefutability of the theory has two main sources, the circularity of the definitions of the central terms of the theory and the lack of any serious alternative. Both elements are important. As regards the latter, Professor Popper has said: 'In most cases we have, before falsifying a hypothesis, another one up our sleeves; for the falsifying experiment is usually a crucial experiment designed to decide between the two. That is to say, it is suggested by the fact that the two hypotheses differ in some respect; and it makes use of this difference to refute (at least) one of them." In the case of evolution there seems no particular direction to look for any tests because no testable alternative presents itself to us, nor has done since Darwin published his original work. Part of the difficulty here is that the circularity of the definitions of the key terms make it hard to see how alternative theories could be formulated. let alone tested. lThe Logic of Scientific Discovery, p. 87, n. 1. 32</page><page sequence="16">THE CONCEPT OF EVOLUTION Theories which are not testable in any way are clearly ruled out. A counsel of despair at this stage would be to say that the Darwinian account is only a reiteration of the fact of evolution, that species have changed from simple to complex in the course of time. (Such a suggestion was made by one biologist with whom I was discussing the contents of this paper.) In other words, to disprove Darwin would be to prove the fixity of species. But more is involved in holding such a view of evolution; some possible alternatives are ruled out, for instance the explanation of the evolution of the internal combustion engine, where choices by beings outside the process itself are relevant at each step. In this sense what is important in Darwinism is the belief that ordinary scientific methods are applicable to biological problems, that there is nothing 'unnatural' about life, and no outside forces need be considered. Here again is a likeness to Marx; one important point of his 'materialist' concep- tion of history was to rule out divine interference, whether in a Christian or Hegelian form, in the course of history. The process could run under its own steam, driven by the motor of individual human desires which, because of the conditions under which they had to operate, gave rise to a continual development. Neither a plan laid down in advance, the Christian 'Divine Purpose', nor a magnet in front, the Hegelian 'Absolute Spirit', need be postulated. I have already remarked that there could be no empirical test of a theory of outside interference in the course of evolution. If this point is accepted, then Darwin's achievement can be seen as an assertion that empirical methods are applicable to biology. If this is what is involved, then it is not surprising that there is no test for the truth of the 'picture', for its function is to show that within its boundaries testability exists, that the methods of science are as applicable here as elsewhere. For several reasons no picture of a similar sort was required in the development of physics; since Galileo it has been accepted that the 'Book of Nature is written in the language of mathematics'. This appeared to involve no diminution of God's powers, rather the mathematical nature of the universe could be seen as evidence of them. Similarly the notion that natural phenomena operate in the simplest way seemed both empirically verifiable and in accordance with what might be expected from a wise Creator. The biological realm appeared to differ from the rest of Nature in both these respects; simplicity was hardly in evidence, and there was no place for mathematics to gain a foothold. Con- siderations like these led Kant to assert that 'Biology awaits its Newton'. When they were at last presented with an account that did seem to make sense of the profusion of the organic, men tended to think that a biological Newton had arrived, that Darwin had done C 33</page><page sequence="17">PHILOSOPHY for biology what Newton had for physics. What I hope to have shown is that this is a misunderstanding of his actual achievement. Once this is seen, then there is no need to be unduly worried by the various difficulties which I have anlaysed in this paper. The circular definitions of key terms in the original version and its modern variants are such only because they are being used to construct a conceptual scheme, not to give a testable hypothesis. Again, it is not surprising that a 'picture' of this kind should bear the marks of the notions that were popular at the time of its making. These, and other puzzling features are all explained if the Darwinian theory of evolution is seen as something very different from a normal theory in other branches of science, or even at other levels in biology. To say this is not to minimise Darwin's (and Wallace's) achievements; to have produced a scheme which has commanded almost universal acceptance for so long is no mean feat. But failure to recognise exactly what has been done is liable to lead both scientists and lay- men into thinking that something more was in question, that a full scientific account had been produced. In the case of the materialist conception of history we are well enough aware of what is left unexplained, so we are not tempted to accept it as a final account; the apparent successes of Darwin's theory should not lead us to ignore the gaps and difficulties which it contains, nor the nature of the theory itself.
