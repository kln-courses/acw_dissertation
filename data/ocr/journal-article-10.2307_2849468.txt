Chambers in his Preface to The Mediaeval Stage (1903) emphasized the lack of curiosity among scholarly writers 'about the social and economic facts upon which mediaeval drama rested.' Then, as he mentioned the paths into which this curiosity had led him, he spoke of his 'very deep interest in the track across the ages of cer- tain customs and symbols and rural gaiety which bear with them the inheritance of a remote and ancestral heathenism' -'the ludi of the village feasts, bearing witness not only to their origin in heathen ritual, but also by their constant tendency to break out into primitive forms of drama, to the deep-rooted mimetic instinct of the folk.' Consistent with this point of view and interest he devoted over one-half the space in his two volumes to 'Folk Drama.' There, he included a discussion of primitive religion, seasonal festivals and games, secular intru- sions into ecclesiastical drama, and professional jesters - courtly and non- courtly -as well as of the Mummers' Play and the Sword Dance. Out of the welter of this refractory flux of dramatic materials he has now selected those elements from cultural history that by common acceptance fall into the category of English folk drama. For example, he omits detailed discussion of the Morris Dance partly because 'the earlier notices of it often came from literary rather than folk sources' and because 'it does not appear, at any rate apart from Robin Hood, to have issued in drama.' By the same process of selection he ex- cludes the slight traces of mediaeval secular drama because of its relation to fabliau and romance and the Robin Hood plays because of their literary af-</page><page sequence="2">204 Reviews finities. A review of possible parallels in the religious drama leads him, soundly, I am convinced, to regard most probably only as interesting analogies the Herodian boasters, the impudent, topsy-turvy vaudeville jesters, the mercator of the Visitatio or the Play of the Sacrament, or the vice of the Morality, and to conclude that 'the evidence permits rather than compels the conjecture of some give and take between the Mummers' Play and the religious drama, at least in its later stages.' The simplest common features of the folk play, thus isolated, are its attachment to some country festival, a fight, in which one of the com- batants is slain, the lament for him, his cure by a doctor, and a collection from the audience (quete). The spectacular features are the sword play and the dances; the popular combatants are St George and the Dragon; and a special- ized feature in the Plough Plays is the wooing episode (C. R. Baskervill, 'Mum- mers Wooing Plays in England,' MP xxi (1924), 225-272). Though the researches of Chambers and of such students as Tiddy Sharp, Baskervill, Kennedy, and Piggott have assembled now over one hundred texts as compared with the twenty-nine known in 1903, these fall within the last century and a half. Consequently, they furnish little clear evidence as to prob- lems of origin and relationships. In brief, since it is impossible to reconstruct an archetype, Chambers gives first a brief composite text. He follows this with an extended analysis of its elements and includes several versions: Weston-sub- Edge (Gloucestershire), Mylor (Cornwall), Bassingham wooing play, Revesby (the oldest version of a village play), and a highly elaborated example from Ampleforth (Yorkshire). Apart from the question of possible 'literary' influ- ences, upon which I commented above, Sir Edmund devotes himself primarily to the problems of St George, continental parallels in surviving folk customs, and conjectures as to primitive origins. For the student of literary culture the sections on St George are the most definitely constructive in Ihis book; and they appeal to me as the soundest and most cogently reasoned. After an historical summary of the legend, a statement concerning the records of lost St George miracle plays, and a review of Richard Johnson's Famous Historie of the Seaven Champions of Christendom (1596-1597), he concludes that 'the traditional text, so far as St George is concerned, is based upon Johnson's romance or some derivative thereof.' Furthermore, he finds nothing in its phraseology that needs to be earlier than Johnson. He presents in toto a pretty convincing refutation to Beatty's view ('St George or Mummers' Play: A Study of Protology,' Trans. of Wis. Acad. of Science, Arts, and Letters xv (1905), 273-3245) that the saint stepped directly out of church story into the popular play, with its accumulation of primitive ceremonies. (The reference to Beatty's study, by the way, Chambers fails to include in his bibliographical note.) He rejects the view that there was direct relationship between the lost miracle plays of St George and the folk play, with only one reservation. This concerns the question of whether the martyr was revived after death; and hence would furnish a parallel to the Doctor and his cure in the folk play. I can state only that if there was such a revival, it would be contrary to everything we know about saints' plays and the employ- ment of the individual narrative in the dramatization of the particular saint's</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 205 legend. Hence, he concludes, that neither Johnson's romance nor borrowings from later drama explains the Doctor and his cure and certain other traditional elements. To find the remoter origin for these he turns to continental analogues in mediaeval and modern folk customs, which range from Russia to the Balkans and from Scandinavia to Spain. The closest congeners of the English folk play he finds in the Southern Balkans. Here I can follow his probabilities and accept his parallels. But when he comes to conjectures, carried on from The Mediaeval Stage, concerning the primitive folk play as emerging from the phytomorphic and theriomorphic into the anthropomorphic conception of deity, he is leading to an enchanted wood which I invite the folklorists to enter. Nor shall I try to resolve the doubt expressed by him as to the soundness of Professor Baskervill's theory that the wooing theme of the primitive ludus inspired the caroles and other forms of Elizabethan pastoral poetry. For the clarification and elaboration in this book of views expressed in The Mediaeval Stage all students of mediaeval culture must be grateful to Sir E. K. Chambers. GEORGE R.
