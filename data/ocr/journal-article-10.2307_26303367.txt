<plain_text><page sequence="1">154 Randolph Splitter Proust's Cotnbray: The Structure of Animistic Projection In two early essays, " The Sorcerer and His Magic " and " The Effectiveness of Symbols," the anthropologist Claude Lévi Strauss analyzes the effectiveness of magical cures.1 In Proust's " Combray," Marcel, suffering from vague complaints and half-imaginary fears, a chronic state of anxiety, might seem to be a perfect candidate for such " imaginary " cures. Indeed, both his fears and his deepest wishes reflect primitive, magical, animistic ways of thinking, an uncertainty about the distinction between inner and outer worlds, between animate creatures and inanimate things. In Marcel's eyes, the cook Françoise is a primitive who, though she slaughters chickens with sadistic delight, possesses a strict code of behavior, full of irrational prohibitions and an exaggerated faith in the sacred character of dinners. But Marcel treats his mother's goodnight kiss, like Françoise her dinners, as a sacred ceremonial, a nightly ritual betraying compulsive needs over which—so that they don't get out of hand—he must exercise obsessive control. Freud shows how such private ceremonials resemble religious or super stitious practices, particularly in their original forms,2 and Marcel's aunt Léonie illustrates the convergence of religion and obsession. On the other hand, Marcel's " primitive " way of seeing things is simply childlike, no more primitive than the lively imagination of Lewis Carroll's Alice. But his childhood insecurities, his anxiety about inner/outer divisions, and his " magical " strategies for warding off those anxieties create a basic structure of alternatives which is later repeated, on every level of the Recherche—in love, in social relations, in art.

The experience of going to sleep, in the opening pages of the Recherche, is one of disorientation, uncertainty, and anx iety.3 The reader too is disoriented: the first-person narrator who starts to tell us all about his nocturnal life is a disembodied presence, a voice speaking to us out of a darkened bedroom. We don't know whether he is young or old but the defenseless, uncertain condition of sleep makes him feel like a child: " per haps, while I was asleep I had returned without the least effort to an earlier stage in my life, now for ever outgrown " (S, 4/1, 4) .4 He experiences again " childish terrors " like having his curls pulled, as if he were still at the mercy of powerful adults like the great-uncle who pulled the curls. The invalid in the strange hotel who mistakes the light of a gaslamp for the light of a new day is like a child afraid of the dark: " It is midnight: some one has turned out the gas; the last servant has gone to bed, and he must lie all night in agony with no one to bring any help " (S, 4/1, 4). And this childlike invalid is, we suspect, the narrator himself. The feeling of being lost, in the dark, makes the narrator lose his sense of identity and doubt his own existence: " not knowing where I was, I could not be sure at first who I was; I had only the most rudimentary sense of existence " (S, 5/1,5). The threat which sleep seems to pose is simply annihilation, death, a fall into the emptiness of " not-being " (néant) (S, 5/1, 5). In the new and unfamiliar room at Balbec (described here first) he will long for death (JF, 179/1, 667) and the ob 3 Leo Bersani also deals with Marcel's childhood anxieties in the first chapter of his excellent book, Marcel Proust: The Fictions of Life and Art (New York: Oxford University Press, 1965), pp. 21-55. i References in the text are, first, to the Vintage paperback edition of the English translation of Remembrance of Things Past, tr.

This is the animistic world, if not of paranoid delusion, then of childhood, of Alice in Wonderland, where there is no clear division between fantasies and reality and where one's private fears may be projected onto the world. As in Alice, the most threatening aspect of the situation is the size of the room itself, the terror of its high ceiling. Not only may the walls of a room seem, dizzyingly, to be " whirling madly through the darkness " (S, 5/1, 6), but the narrator's mind feels compelled to project itself literally into the room and fill the frightening emptiness created by the high ceiling, " to leave its moorings, to elongate itself upwards so as to take on the exact shape of the room, and to reach to the summit of that monstrous funnel " (S, 7/1, 8). The monstrous funnel seems like the abyss of not being turned upside down, in which one may be sucked up and lost forever. It is precisely the emptiness of the high ceilinged room that most frightens the narrator, its quality of not-being, and it is this void which he must fill with his own presence, with his own conscious awareness. Some rooms the narrator remembers fondly, and he likes to make his bed into a nest where he can bury his head and shut himself off from the threatening outer world. He even calls the darkness " pleasant and restful " (I, 3/1, 3). But, although sleep may be a refuge, bedrooms can be fearful places; the night (in which one loses confidence in visible reality) is a disturbing time, and the fear of darkness, nothingness, and death may also be the fear of losing consciousness in sleep. The experience of going to sleep implies for the narrator a sense of childlike help lessness in the face of overwhelming, even supernatural forces. And yet this anxiety-filled loss of ordinary conscious control restored by the reassuring process of what the narrator calls custom or habit (l'habitude)*—is also the precondition for a deeper, more valuable, and more gratifying sense of reality. Proust's hero, gazing up at that lofty ceiling like a man with a fear of heights, is like Wordsworth gazing out from the " awful «Cf. Samuel Beckett, Proust (New York: Grove Press, 1931), pp. 7-12.</page><page sequence="4">Proust's Combray 157 and sublime " prospect of Mt. Snowdon: in both cases, the threat of losing oneself in an abyss of nothingness will be over come by the power of imagination to make all things seem a part of oneself. The magic lantern of Marcel's Combray childhood—for we learn that the narrator does have a childhood and an identity of his own—though it substitutes light for darkness, disturbs him because it changes the lighting of his bedroom and makes it seem a new, strange, and alien place. The narrator admits that he enjoyed the moving pictures of the magic lantern but insists upon the malaise he felt at the " intrusion of mystery and beauty into a room which I had succeeded in filling with my own personality until I thought no more of the room than of myself. The anaesthetic effect of custom being destroyed, I would begin to think and to feel very melancholy things " (S, 8/1, 10). The comforting sense of shared identity that Marcel feels with his room is also anaesthetic, deadening, and the new element (mystery and beauty) which undermines the anaesthe tic effect creates what seems to be a peculiarly pleasurable form of anxiety—the first stage of an aesthetic, rather than anaesthetic, response. Marcel is a cautious, fearful, conser vative child; anything new frightens him. He would prefer to live in a hermetically sealed, entirely self-contained world all his own, but the fear of being left open to outside intrusion may give way to the pleasure of incorporating the disturbing element into himself, of restoring the sense that the world is just his private domain. Significantly, the magic lantern, by virtue of the magical immateriality of light, performs just this kind of " transubstantiation " (transvertébration) : " The body of Golo himself, being of the same supernatural substance as his steed's, overcame all material obstacles—everything that seemed to bar his way—by taking each as it might be a skeleton and embody ing it in himself " (S, 8/1, 10). The apparent ability of the magic lantern to assimilate all material objects into itself, though it upsets Marcel's confidence in his surroundings, is actually a visual property which Marcel, implicitly, would like to appropriate for himself. The scenario of the famous goodnight kiss puts Marcel's anxieties, specifically his anxiety about going to bed, into more</page><page sequence="5">158 Randolph Splitter dramatic terms. His mother's kiss is a " communion " (S, 11/1, 13) by which he can assimilate into himself a magical, immater ial, almost supernatural substance—thereby fulfilling, in a dif ferent way, the transmutation that the magic lantern effects— a " volatile essence " {vertu) (S, 18/1, 23) which turns out to be, simply, the sense of his mother's " presence " (S, 11/1, 13). In this way, even the material barrier (different bodies) which separates one person from another may be overcome. In short, the kiss is a literally oral act (" my lips might drink deeply " (S, 11/I, 13)) by which the child Marcel, clinging to early fantasies, imagines that he can incorporate his mother into himself. Characteristically, however, his mother's comforting presence provides " tranquillity " rather than excitement and carries with it merely "the power to sleep" (S, 11/1, 13). The magical substance of the kiss is just a soporific, a tran quilizer. Besides, the project of assimilation is fraught with diffi culties. The volatile essence of the kiss, " frail and precious " (S, 18/1, 23) as it is, is always in danger of evaporating alto gether, and it is necessary to protect it from an alien environ ment. There is always the threat of attack from ouside. In fact, when Marcel is sent to bed without his kiss, he buries himself in his private sanctuary and, making sure that nothing can get in, proceeds to " stop every loophole " and " close the shutters " (S, 22/1, 28). The staircase which he has to climb seems hateful to him, and its smell of varnish—another intang ible substance—seems to be the disembodied projection of his own unhappiness, which in turn assaults him by invading his consciousness in a manner " at once insidious and brutal " (S, 22/1, 28). Again, this kind of animistic projection would be a paranoid delusion if it were not just (just?) a childish fantasy. Marcel imagines, here, that his emotions (one step more re fined than medieval humors) take the form of those volatile essences that mean so much to him, but, as in the medical theories of shamans and their patients, the pain that he feels seems to him like an alien invader, something that penetrates his body. The pleasure of drinking in his mother's attention is counterbalanced by the fear of being poisoned by the smell of varnish. In either case, the mechanism (assimilation or in</page><page sequence="6">Proust's Combray 159 vasion) is the same: oral desires and paranoid fears of invasion are two sides of the same coin. Because the kiss itself is so fragile and precarious, Marcel concentrates his thoughts and zeroes in on " the exact spot on her cheek" (S, 21/1, 27). How different is this from "the punctiliousness which madmen use who compel themselves to exclude all other thoughts from their minds while they are shutting a door, so that when the sickness of uncertainty sweeps over them again they can triumphantly face and overcome it with the recollection of the precise moment in which the door was shut " (S, 18/1, 23) ? Like these madmen, Marcel is care ful to shut the door not only to his room but to his mind, keep ing out an distracting thoughts as if they were dangerous foreign substances. This careful, punctilious, obsessive concern is a defense against the terrifying unpredictability of what other people might do. Marcel is so obsessive that thoughts may enter his mind only on the condition that they leave behind any affective quality, even beauty. Here again he strives for the condition of a patient under an anesthetic, who " can look on with a clear consciousness ... and yet feel nothing " (S, 19/1, 24). Feeling is dangerous, pure thought safe. Significantly, the madmen cling to the recollection of the moment which obsesses them, the memory which they can hold onto and possess. In the same way Marcel holds onto the thought of the kiss, which is even more insubstantial (but less fleeting) than the kiss itself. Only he employs anticipation rather than recollection, fixing his thoughts on the future and so avoiding the terrifying " abyss " (S, 19/1, 24) of the empty present. He even hopes that his mother will come as late as possible, postponing the time when she will have to leave him but also prolonging the time in which she hasn't yet come. In this way he substitutes pleasurable anticipation for anxiety, finding it easier to control his own expectations than to control his mother's actual comings and goings. Indeed, the moral of the story is the need for self-control. When his father, whose dictates seem arbitrary and unprin cipled, and who has been cast in the role of the oedipal bogey man, tells his mother to spend the night with him, Marcel's rigid system of defenses against anxiety collapses. He feels he</page><page sequence="7">160 Randolph Splitter has been rewarded for the cardinal sin of yielding to a nervous impulse, of giving in to a childish need. His mother and grand mother had wished to make him more self-reliant, less dependent on them, but now he is also dependent on the whims of a " nervous condition " (S, 29/1, 38) for which he is not respon sible. When he is alone with his mother, he cries without stop ping—because of his nerves, says his mother, for no reason at all—not because he is seriously unhappy but because he can now give in to the emotions which threatened to overwhelm him. However, the idea that he has been freed from responsibility is an illusion. His sense of guilt is so basic that he feels he has betrayed his mother, failed to live up to her ideal, and forced her to stay with him against her will (which he has). The fulfillment of his wishes (the victory over his mother) is so fraught with guilt that he wishes his mother would go away again, leaving him to nurse his unhappiness in peace. It is not only the denial of his wishes which troubles him but also their fulfillment. The rigid control which he exer cises over his own thoughts—keep out all distractions, think of the future, concentrate on the exact spot—has become, in classic obsessional fashion, a new source of pleasure, safer and less threatening than the original desire. By keeping out all dis tractions, he defends against anything that might attract him, anything " beautiful " like the pictures of the magic lantern, clinging only to a carefully circumscribed image. In short, Marcel needs no training in self-control: both before and after his father's miraculous concession, he fears (and feels guilty about) giving in to desires over which he has no control. Now he can cry without feeling guilty, as he suggests, but (to overstate the case) can he enjoy anything except tears, except his nervous condition itself, except the unhappiness which has become for him the sole condition for happiness? In fact, late in Swann's Way his nervous excitement at the prospect of tra velling to Florence and Venice actually makes him sick, pre venting him from making the trip (S, 300/1, 393). The im minent fulfillment of his desires arouses too much anxiety, but his anxious excitement has almost become an end in itself. The little drama of going to bed, a " screen memory " which condenses the entire history of Marcel's uneasy and</page><page sequence="8">Proust's Combray 161 ambivalent dependence on his mother, a " myth " which gives us the history of Marcel's childhood in a nutshell, confirms him as a kind of premature invalid not too different from his aunt Léonie. She too takes a somewhat masochistic satisfaction in her own suffering, spending her remaining days in bed " in an indefinite condition of grief, physical exhaustion, illness, obses sions, and religious observances [d'idée fixe et de dévotion] " (S, 37/1, 49). The amazing point about Léonie's illness is that, no matter how ambiguously psychosomatic, hypochondriacal, " neurasthenic," or simply imaginary it may be, it leads, in fact, to death. The implicit comparison between Léonie and Marcel makes him seem an old and eccentric neurotic like her, but it also suggests that the source of his complaint, like hers, is the fear of death, or in other words, that the condition from which he suffers is life itself. Aunt Léonie's aim seems to be to cultivate an illness over which she at least has some control, to remain bed-ridden by her own choice, as if she were willing to be an invalid forever as long as she didn't ever actually have to die. So she detests two categories of people, those who urge her to live a more active life (denying the seriousness of her illness) and those who believe that she really is as ill as she says, turning a harmless fantasy into grim reality. In much the same way, Marcel wants his parents to commiserate with him in his suffering, to take it seriously, without actually giving in to him and so putting an end to his misery. But Léonie's illness, growing out of control, proves fatal, and Marcel's ner vous complaint—that indefinite, fantastic, imaginary, neurotic condition of grief and anxiety which for centuries was called " melancholia "—turns out to be real. Just as Léonie, paranoiacally afraid of being betrayed by her scrupulously devoted servant Françoise, longs to betray her, Marcel too may come to resent the " servant " who takes care of him—his mother-and wish to betray her. In real life, Proust was not always grateful for the attention that he de manded from his mother, and Marcel himself comes to feel that he has been " an ungrateful, selfish, cruel youngster " (SGI 13/ II, 756) toward his loving grandmother. At any rate, in her completely moribund life, Léonie attaches " to the least of her sensations an extraordinary importance " (S, 39/1, 50) and finds</page><page sequence="9">162 Randolph Splitter in " the most trivial occupations of her daily life, her morning toilet, her luncheon, her afternoon nap" (S, 90/1, 118), an extraordinary value and interest. This kind of minute, obses sive interest in trivial things, especially one's own sensations, which seems so neurotically self-centered, is exactly what makes Marcel's narrative—that is to say, Proust's novel— possible. It also reflects a primitive, even superstitious belief in the value of particulars, a feature of what Lévi-Strauss calls " the science of the concrete " but also a feature of art. The experience of the madeleine, in which a whole world of memory opens out from a cup of tea, is a case in point. The sensation Marcel has is one of intense pleasure, a kind of " all powerful joy " or manic exhilaration in which " the viccissitudes of life had become indifferent to me, its disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory " (S, 34/1, 45), but it présupposes the sense of loss which has become second nature for Marcel, in this case the loss of his own past. The crumbs of cake dissolving in the warm tea become less material, less substantial; the smell and taste of the tea-soaked madeleine are even more impalpable, like the volatile essence of his mother's goodnight kiss; and this precious essence seems to fill the void within him. Still, no matter how volatile and insubstantial they may seem, Marcel's " essences " are not abstract Platonic ideas but rather magical, even imaginary agents of the outside world. In Marcel's " pri mitive " animisni, the distinction between matter and " spirit " has no real meaning. And yet he claims that the essence which fills him is already simply himself (S, 34/1, 45). The taste of the madeleine is important to him only because it revives a memory (aunt Léonie's Sunday tea), a visual image conjured up like the projection of a magic lantern. New and unexpected events are normally a source of anxiety for Marcel, but this event turns out to be familiar, a repetition of something he has already experienced. And this unconscious familiarity (the kind of impression that Freud analyzes in " The ' Uncanny ' ") is the source of his sudden pleasure, the realization that the world is inside him, that his childhood is not lost, and that life can't hurt him the second time around. The whole world of Combray seems to solidify, take shape, and assume material reality in Marcel's cup of tea, reversing the process of distilla</page><page sequence="10">Proust's Combray 163 tion into impalpable essences, seeming to belie the fact that these shapes and figures are only the insubstantial projections of his imagination. Part of the pleasure of the madeleine is that it is sudden and unexpected, temporarily mysterious and inexplicable, and in his walks along the two " ways " out of Combray, Marcel seems to discover, after all, a pleasure in things outside of him self, in nature. ' He admires the hawthorn-blossoms arrayed on the altar of the local church precisely because they are alive, part of nature (S, 85/1, 112), but he describes the hawthorn that he meets on the road in terms of the architecture of a church: " The hedge resembled a series of chapels... as though I had been standing before the Lady-altar... the flamboyant style of architecture ..." (S, 106/1, 138). He is attracted by what is alive and spontaneous, but in order to possess it he has to place it in an artificial, aesthetic context, as if it were man made after all. The very act of description—even if it is the narrator's, not little Marcel's—is a way of putting the flowers into his own terms and thereby making them his own. He frames the scene in a window—" the sun cast a square of light upon the ground, as though it had shone in upon them through a window " (S, 106/1, 138) —and he also paints a verbal picture, transforming live flowers into a carefully composed arrangement of words. He struggles to possess the secret of the hawthorns, if not to make the flowers part of himself then to fall into their rhy thm, to attach himself to them in a passive submission to their mysterious and beautiful life. The struggle seems to be in vain, and the sentiment which the hawthorns arouse in him remains as obscure and vague as (at first) the sentiment aroused by the taste of the madeleine. But his strategy, significantly, is " to lose " and then " to rediscover " (S, 106/1, 138) the odor of the hawthorns—" as one stands before those masterpieces of painting which, one imagines, one will be better able to ' take in ' when one has looked away" (S, 106/1, 139)—just as, through no design of his own, he had to forget the taste of the madeleine in order to rediscover it, in order to enjoy it. Marcel can't possess something without in some sense losing it first, without leaving himself open, temporarily, to the mystery and uncer</page><page sequence="11">164 Randolph Splitter tainty which frightens and attracts him at the same time—a capacity akin to what Keats called, a little obscurely, " negative capability." This preliminary renunciation is an escape from his characteristically intense, obsessive concentration on the source of his pleasure, an attempt to free himself from the strenuous, fatiguing effort of possession, a rather controlled attempt at letting go. But this is only a first step: Marcel recognizes " the natural laziness which deters us from every difficult enterprise " (S, 35/1, 46), particularly his own, but he will not be satisfied until he has possessed the secret of his own enjoyment, the key to the mystery. This intellectual need to analyze his own feelings is incompatible with a naive acceptance of mysterious forces, but perhaps Marcel is like a self-conscious shaman who has to know the source of his own secret powers. And he comes closer to capturing the true quality of the hawthorns when his grandfather shows him another one, similar and yet different, like a new work by a favorite painter, new and yet familiar like the taste of the madeleine. This new hawthorn is pink instead of white, which Marcel compares to pink biscuits and pink cream cheese tinged with strawberries, as if the flowers too were not only colorful but edible. The nar rator seems to be saying that children view beautifiul things as an almost literal feast for the eyes—" even after the child's mind has realised that they offer no gratification to the appe tite " (S, 107/1, 140) —and in his effort to possess it Marcel too can almost taste the beauty of the flowers. In the same way the buttercups along the Guermantes way are " yellow as the yolk of eggs " (S, 129/1, 167) and even more beautiful because he can't actually consume them. But perhaps the pink hawthorns fascinate Marcel (and even, despite his remarkable powers of self-analysis, Proust) for deeper, unconscious reasons that have nothing to do with food. The pale buds of the hawthorn, when they open, disclose a " blood-red stain," which suggests " even more strongly than the full-blown flowers the special, irresistible quality of the hawthorn-tree " (S, 107/1, 140). Marcel associates the festal flowers with celebrations of the Virgin Mary—" in its cool, rosy garments, a Catholic bush " (S, 108/1, 140) -and just as</page><page sequence="12">Proust's Combray 165 he earlier imagined the blossoming of the flowers in church as the careless, spontaneous movement of " a young girl in white " (S, 86/1, 112), so now he identifies the pink hawthorn with the little girl (Gilberte), with reddish hair and pink freckles, that he sees behind the hedge. Gilberte's mother, who appears now as " a lady in white " (S, 109/1, 141), is actually the same mysterious " lady in pink," an actress or courtesan and not quite a lady, whom Marcel has met at his uncle Adolphe's. The metaphorical identification of girls and flowers is, of course, also suggested in the title of Proust's second volume, A l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs. The opposition between pink and innocent white, the association with the Virgin Mary, with young girls, and with a lady who isn't an innocent young girl, the particular emphasis on blossoming, the opening of buds into mature and beautiful flowers, the glimpse of the girl be hind the hedge, through an arch of pink flowers, and the crucial exposure of a blood-red stain on the inside of pale buds all imply an underlying preoccupation with female virginity: with the loss of virginity in intercourse (the blood-red stain caused by " deflowering "), with the disillusioning metamorphosis of an innocent virgin into a not-so-innocent lady (her mother!), with the equally mysterious metamorphosis of a girl " blossom ing " into a sexual mature woman (marked, on the most literal level, by the blood-red stain of menstruation), or simply with the mysterious, frightening, barely glimpsed sight of a girl's genitals, which seems to disclose (in the fantasy of a boy familiar with his own anatomy) a blood-red wound.8 In short, the pink hawthorns, white flowers tinged red, are reassuringly innocent and yet ambiguously seductive at the same time, like the young, pubescent girls " in bloom " who will be Marcel's special province in love as they were Lewis Carroll's—before Nabokov's Humbert Humbert gave this predilection a bad name. It is not that his interest in flowers is sexual or that flowers are simply a metaphor for girls, but his conscious, artful metaphor conceals a specific, literal, unconscious identification, • Cf. the white and red roses of Molly Bloom's " menstrual " soliloquy in James Joyce's Ulysses and the pale/rosy contrast in Joyce's Finnegans Wake (see ch. 3 of my unpublished study of Finnegans Wake, The Sane and Joyful Spirit).</page><page sequence="13">166 Randolph Splitter which helps explain the magical virtue (the beauty) of pink hawthorns.7 Indeed, in Marcel's eyes, women as well as flowers are mysterious, beautiful, distant creatures whom he would like to possess but into whose world he cannot even penetrate. Making no distinction " between the earth and its creatures " (S, 120/1, 157), he longs for a peasant-girl who will rise up and let him embrace her, an imaginary wood-nymph who embodies for him the secret beauty of the Roussainville woods and of the whole natural world. This peasant-girl is vague and anonymous not only because she represents everything sensual and alive which Marcel can't quite reach—even the madeleine seems " richly sensual under its severe, religious folds " (S, 36/1, 47) —but because she exists nowhere except in his imagination. Accord ingly, the peasant-girl never appears and his unsatisfied desire for her leads only to guilt-ridden masturbation. Marcel's pea sant-girl is like the woman in his dreams in the opening pages of the book, a fantasy which he keeps chasing forever (S, 4/1, 4-5). He comes to realize that his peasant-girls are " the purely subjective, impotent, illusory creatures " (S, 122/1, 158-9) of his imagination (which makes him lose interest in nature), but this unsatisfied desire for an impossible object, an emotional attachment to something that is inside him and beyond him at the same time—a feeling which he applies, in the space of a few pages, to the lady in pink, Gilberte, Mme. de Guermantes, and the hawthorns themselves—is what he calls love. So, for example, he is at first disappointed by the disparity between the actual appearance of the Duchesse de Guermantes in church and the fantasy figure of his dreams, as different as " the material presence of a living actress " and " a projection of limelight from a lantern " (S, 134/1, 175). But he quickly reconciles his fantasies with the image that he sees, and though he can never hope to meet her, he can carry away and incor porate into himself the memory of her face. Indeed, the Duchess is for him an image of visual beauty, like the hawthorns, one i On the idea of metaphor as a psychological paradigm, see Jacques Lacan, " The Insistence of the Letter in the Unconscious," Yale French Studies, 36 &amp; 37 (1966), 112-47, and Jean Laplanche and Serge Leclaire, "The Unconscious: A Psychoanalytic Study," Yale French Studies, 48 (1972), 118-75.</page><page sequence="14">Proust's Combray 167 which momentarily paralyzes his imagination and fixes his sight. Unlike the hawthorns, however, she looks back, glancing around the church and even at Marcel himself. Marcel com pares the glance of her blue eyes to a ray of sunlight, blue light through a stained-glass window, as if that light were a quasi material substance that he could absorb into himself. He im agines that she looks on him in a kindly, loving manner, but he falls in love with Gilberte even though—or rather, because—she looks on him (he thinks) with contempt. That glimpse of her behind the hedge also virtually para lyzes him—because this kind of vision " involves a deeper kind of perception and takes possession of the whole of our being " (S, 108/1, 140) —and he looks at her " with that gaze which is not merely a messenger from the eyes, but in whose window all the senses assemble and lean out, petrified and anxious, that gaze which would fain reach, touch, capture, bear off in triumph the body at which it is aimed, and the soul with the body " (S, 108/1, 141). This gaze is clearly a magical and aggressive instrument of possession, but her look, if not actually hostile, is subtle, ambiguous, inscrutable, as if she is not willing to ad mit that she sees him. (The gentleman that accompanies her, who turns out to be M. Charlus, stares at Marcel " with eyes which seemed to be starting from his head " (S, 109/1, 141).) In order to make her see him and remember him, and in order to repay her contempt in kind, Marcel would like to insult her, calling her hideous because she is so beautiful. His aim is to close the distance that separates them, to overcome her indif ference, but that distance, that indifference, like the uncertainty inherent in his mother's goodnight kiss, seems like a necessary condition for his love. The somewhat masochistic need to suffer, like a Petrarchan lover, at the hands of a cruel and " lordly " lady may soon turn into an angry, even sadistic desire for revenge, as in Marcel's wish to injure Gilberte, at least by denying the beauty that he cannot possess. Or, indeed, he may come to believe his expressions of hostility toward women— "you are utterly disgustingl " (S, 109/1, 142)-and no longer find them beautiful. In the meantime the image of Gilberte, arrested and frozen in his memory, remains for him " the first illustration of a type " (S, 109/1,142) of inaccessible happiness.</page><page sequence="15">168 Randolph Splitter If Marcel's adolescent attitude toward women can be re duced, ultimately, to his fantasy of anonymous peasant-girls, his attitude toward nature likewise owes a lot to his imagination. Near the end of the " Combray " section, he describes a kind of Romantic crisis of faith in which, like Wordsworth, he has lost that almost animistic childhood identification with the natural world: " Whether it be that the faith which creates has ceased to exist in me, or that reality will take shape in the memory alone, the flowers that people shew me nowadays for the first time never seem to me to be true flowers" (S, 141/1, 184). The resolution of that Romantic crisis must come through a recognition that the " primitive " faith which creates an ani mate world is the individual's own power of imagination, but for Marcel this problem is intimately linked with visual per ception and the idea of an aesthetic image.8 (Compare the voyeuristic scene where Marcel spies on Mile. Vinteuil and her friend, in which the photograph of M. Vinteuil also seems to be looking at them (S, 122-7/1, 159-65).) Even his spontaneous outburst of joy when the sun comes out after a rainstorm (" Zut, zut, zut, zut ") receives its immediate inspiration from the reflection of a pink tiled roof in a pond, which he interprets (in the style of pathetic fallacy) as " a pallid smile responding to the smiling sky" (S, 119/1, 155). Of course he too is smiling at the now-sunny sky, but it is the reflection, not the roof or the pond or the sky itself, which moves him most. The images of the magic lantern disturb Marcel, because of their " intrusion of mystery and beauty," but the transformation of reality into mysterious, beautiful, fantasy-rich images is just what he has in mind. By the same token, Marcel's grandmother, in her com mitment to aesthetic values, dislikes photographs because they are too literal and realistic and would like to insulate Marcel from their vulgar reality by introducing " several ' thicknesses ' of art " (S, 31/1, 40). Instead of a photograph of some pictures que scene, she tries to give him a photograph of a painting of that scene. Something is lost in this substitution of art for 8 Cf. Howard Moss, The Magic Lantern of Marcel Proust (New York: Mac millan, 1962), pp. 43-62, and Roger Shattuck, Proust's Binoculars (New York: Random House, 1963), pp. 3-20, 40-60.</page><page sequence="16">Proust's Combray 169 reality—" The idea which I formed of Venice, from a drawing by Titian which is supposed to have the lagoon in the back ground, was certainly far less accurate than what I have since derived from ordinary photographs " (S, 31/1, 40-1) —but some thing is gained as well, namely the personal, human quality which we assimilate into ourselves much more readily than the alien, impenetrable, inhuman surface of ordinary objects (cf. S, 63-4/1,84-5). So Marcel loves the old church of Saint-Hilaire at Combray, which he describes in long and affectionate detail, not because it is conventionally beautiful or artistic, but because it is natural, alive, human. From the point of view of primitive, mythical " religion," the whole universe is natural, alive, and ultimately human, but for Marcel these qualities are an essential criterion of beauty. The once " hard and lifeless matter " of the memo rial stones has melted into something softer and sweeter, like honey (S, 45/1, 59), and the church itself becomes Marcel's "familiar friend" (S, 47/1, 62). The stained-glass windows, illuminated images like the projections of the magic lantern, particularly appeal to him because they seem to use the natural light of the sun to outdo nature. The windows are most bril liant on dull days, and even when the earth outside is still bleak and barren they blossom like a " dazzling and gilded carpet of forget-me-nots in glass " (S, 46/1, 60). The many colors of the church tapestries melt into one another like the stones which " melt like honey and flow beyond their proper margins " (S, 45/1, 59). This Impressionistic dissolution of boundaries, this melting out into forms more fluid and diffuse (like the " per fume " of the tea-soaked madeleine) has a seductive appeal for Marcel because it suggests that the boundary between himself and the outside world is not as rigid and impenetrable as he fears. Windows themselves are an ambiguous boundary, and semi-opaque stained-glass windows, which let light in but do not let you see out, are more ambigious still, which is one of the reasons why Marcel likes them. The church seems so ffiendly and familiar, so much like home, and yet, paradoxically, it preserves the sense of difference, separateness, otherness that we have just denied. The wall of the apse, pierced with small windows at a great height (like</page><page sequence="17">170 Randolph Splitter eyes), seems more appropriate to a prison than a church. Besides this physical barrier there seems to be, between the church and the neighboring buildings, between it and everything else in Combray, "a clear line of demarcation" (S, 47/1, 62). So there is a fixed boundary after all. The lofty steeple of Saint Hilaire, which seems not only natural but also " human '" so sharpened and so pink " (" Combray " is Proust's pink period) " that it seemed to be no more than sketched on the sky by the finger-nail of a painter anxious to give to such a landscape, to so pure a piece of ' nature,' this little sign of art, this single indication of human existence " (S, 48/1, 63) —puts the problem in clearer relief. Marcel's grandmother likes the curious old face of the steeple and even imagines it playing the piano, but this quaint anthropomorphism belies a deeper and more alien kind of consciousness. Though the top of the steeple seems " softened and sweetened " (like the stones in the church) by the light of the setting sun, it also seems " to have mounted suddenly far higher, to have become truly remote " (S, 49/1, 64). The cries of the jackdaws circling around it likewise seem " to intensify its silence, to elongate its spire still further, and to invest it with some quality beyond the power of words " (S, 49/1, 65). The image which moves Marcel so deeply is precisely that of a Gothic church steeple rising abruptly above a line of rooftops, breaking the line of sight, leaving ordinary human reality—and human language—far behind (S, 50/1, 66). The dear, familiar, human quality of the church is only the last term in a complex emotional series which begins with the sudden, unexpected, epiphany-like appearance, taking one by surprise, of a naked spire on the horizon. The sudden appear ance of what is new and unfamiliar is, as we have seen, fraught with anxiety for Marcel, but the conversion of this alien, threatening reality into something old and familiar—as in the case of the madeleine—creates intense joy. In short, the Gothic steeple of Saint-Hilaire, its lofty, impersonal otherworldliness stamped with a human face, fills him with the same kind of pleasurable anxiety as the magic lantern. As Marcel experiences it, beauty is a surprising, disturbing, potentially hostile force which has to be domesticated, made familiar, made human, an " imaginary " foreign substance which he takes into himself in small, homeopathic doses.</page><page sequence="18">Proust's Combray 171 The single spire of Saint-Hilaire and the two spires of Saint-André-des-Champs nearby form a progression that leads to the multiple image of three steeples (two at Martinville and a third at Vieuxvicq) converging on the horizon. The move ment of the carriage in which Marcel is riding, along a winding road, creates a shift in perspective, causing the steeples to appear and disappear, to separate and converge as in a Cubist painting. Here again the setting sun " plays " and " smiles " on the stee ples, bathing them with light before they finally vanish in the darkness, reminding us of Marcel's almost primitive faith in the virtue of sunlight, which illuminates the phenomenal world and wards off the fear of total dissolution that darkness implies. The apparent motion of the steeples plays tricks with Marcel's sense of time and space, the churchtops appearing slow and " dilatory," even motionless, but also suddenly " springing into position." In fact he is " astonished " when the carriage arrives in Martinville much sooner than he expected, the steeples fling ing themselves " so abruptly in our path that we had barely time to stop before being dashed against the porch of the church" (S, 139/1, 181). The impression (allowing for a touch of hyperbole ) is of a dangerously unstable, animistic, Alice in Wonderland universe, " pre-scientific " or simply post Einsteinian, everything whirling in space, nothing fixed. If objects are unpredictable, ready to spring up out of nowhere and strike at any time, the merger of the three steeples into one—and even into none, swallowed up by the (usually alien) darkness—seems reassuring, resolving the problem of sudden, even violent motion in a closing image of stasis and rest. Marcel softens the bold outline of the steeples by imagin ing them as his favorite images of beauty, first flowers and then maidens, " charming and resigned," whose motion is no longer violent but now " timid," " awkward," and " stumbling." The collapse of boundaries may create anxiety—especially if it is too sudden, like Marcel's headlong plunge into the church—but the gradual merger of the steeples creates that sense of unity, har mony, and stasis that Stephen Dedalus (in Joyce's Portrait of the Artist) prescribes for an image of beauty. Except that merger, in which the image loses its integrity, its clear outline, and fades out into the night, is not what Stephen has in mind.</page><page sequence="19">172 Randolph Splitter Stephen's idea of the aesthetic image is something clear and sharp, but Marcel likes the subtle play of fading light, the slow fusion and confusion of forms. It is important to remember, however, that if Marcel's " special pleasure " ends with an image of rest and resolution, it begins with the sense of sudden, surprising change, the anxious discovery of a universe that is unpredictable and alive. Here again the experience is an exercise in controlled anxiety, like a ride on a roller coaster. Marcel fears the unpredictable, uncontrollable quality of life itself, but he needs to be reminded of it in order to feel alive himself. Even a roof, a gleam*of sunlight, the smell of a road can give him the special, " unreasoning " pleasure that he feels but doesn't quite understand, but the immediate sense-impression is only an outer husk which contains, like a secret treasure, the real source and meaning of his pleasure. By the same token, he identifies this inexplicable pleasure as " the illusion of a sort of fecundity" (S, 137/1, 179), a sense of fullness and in toxication in which he himself is bursting with life, and the act of transcribing his experience, putting it into words, is like giv ing birth to the mystery inside him: relieving himself of the steeples and what they conceal, " as though I myself were a hen and had just laid an egg " (S, 140/1, 182). To expel the mystery in this way is not exactly to explain it, the fragment that is born is not yet a work of art, but this " delivery," like the " pregnant " feeling that precedes it, makes him happy. The mystery Marcel takes in must be as insubstantial and diffuse as the " perfume " of the madeleine or the volatile es sence of his mother's kiss. And, indeed, objects of visual beauty lose their material character and are distilled, like the pro jections of the magic lantern, into their own immaterial images. In this case, the avenue of assimilation is not the mouth or even the nose (tasting, smelling, kissing) but the eye, and the transparent, immaterial substance that Marcel takes in is light itself, the light that these objects reflect. The church steeples are seen in sunlight (as in Impressionist paintings such as Monet's studies of Rouen Cathedral at different times of the day), hawthorns and girls are linked with color (pink and white), and the Duchesse de Guermantes seems to emit a ray</page><page sequence="20">Proust's Combray 173 of light. Marcel's vision sometimes seems to be an aggressive instrument, as when he tries to penetrate to the mystery beneath the surface of what he sees, but normally he is the passive recip ient of the light that enters his eyes—the " supernatural " light cast, for example, by the eyes of Mme de Guermantes. In fact, his visual fantasies bear a striking resemblance to the medieval legend or myth in which the Virgin Mary is " impregnated," through the eye, by a divine beam of light.9 For Marcel, too, as for the Impressionist painters, light is a magical, fertile, almost supernatural substance, the magical essence of the object, and the first stroke of daylight which wakes him up at the end of " Combray " the uplifted fore finger of day" (S, 143/1, 187)—is the same quasi-phallic " Finger of God " (S, 50/1, 66) which he sees in the Gothic steeple of Saint-Hilaire. There is a reversal of sexual roles here, in which Marcel plays the passive part of the Virgin Mother and the fertile, life-giving power emanates not only from a seemingly pre-Christian sun god but from high-born courtly ladies like Mme de Guermantes (who appears like a figure on a stained glass window and seems to inspire almost religious veneration in Marcel) and ambiguously virginal girls like Gilberte (sur rounded by flowers in the manner of a church altar). It is the caressing gaze of Mme de Guermantes that penetrates Marcel, the glimpse of Gilberte's pink-freckled face that fills him with love, but the intercourse between them is visual and at a dis tance. Mile Vinteuil's fantasy—attributed to her friend—of spitting in her father's face is an attempt to ward off his pene trating vision, but it also implies an act of intercourse.) He prefers this rarefied, desexualized, " aesthetic " relation just because it is easier to control and possess a disembodied mental image than an actual person with a will of her own. In its essential form, however, what intrudes upon Marcel and shatters his complacency is simply the " beauty " of things— »See Jacob A. Arlow, "The Madonna's Conception through the Eyes," Psychoanalytic Study of Society, S (1964), 13-25, and also Ernest Jones, "The Madonna's Conception Through the Ear," Essays in Applied Psychoanalysis (New York: International Universities Press, 19(H), II, 266-357.

The muse that inspires him and fills him with joy is life itself, the sheer unexpectedness that shakes him out of his chronic self-absorbed depression. This depression is a kind of living death, a sense of emptiness and " not-being," and the sudden impingement of outside reality " fertilizes " him with new life. But just as light passes through a window without damaging it—his preoccupation with windows, especially stained-glass ones, is also anticipated by medieval theologians—Marcel, repeating the Immaculate Conception, re mains a " virgin " when the light of the external object pene trates his eyes. Even though the outside world threatens to invade and overwhelm him, he manages to keep his boundaries intact, take possession of the invader, and turn it into an aesthetic image, virtually a creature of his own imagination. Indeed, just as the taste of the madeleine causes an earlier memory to rise within him (the crucial factor in the " resur rections " of the final volume), Marcel repeatedly says that the mysterious, exhilarating quality which seems to lie hidden in the object really resides within himself. In this way he denies the external origin of that fertile, life-giving joy—" Seek? More than that: create." (S, 35/1, 45) —and, like a shaman, appropri ates for himself the creative power that seems to animate the universe, a power that he both fears and envies. The mysterious feeling which rises from the depths of a dark region and must be brought to light (S, 35/1, 45-6) has unconscious origins, seemingly inside oneself and yet somewhere else, inaccessible, and the light which will penetrate the mys tery—a kind of inner vision—is simply consciousness. (The mysterious essence and the inner light are split versions of the single magical substance that Marcel seeks to possess, and their union, like the union of present and past sensations, resembles another fertilization.) Marcel's intense, obsessive concentration on the object—for example, the exact spot on his mother's cheek where he intends to kiss her—does not enable him to penetrate to the heart of the mystery, and so he turns away or closes his eyes, shutting out all extraneous ideas (S, 19, 35, 106, 137/1, 24, 46, 138, 178) in an effort to concentrate better, with renewed strength, but also because (like Wordsworth and Blake) he</page><page sequence="22">Proust's Combray 175 knows he can see more clearly, into this sort of mystery, with the mind's eye than with the bodily one. The investigation of the mystery may seem blind and fortuitous, an alternate re laxation and renewal of conscious control, but the sudden recognition that he achieves (when, for example, he recalls the original taste of the madeleine) is not accidental. It is the result of a carefully controlled experiment in " free " association. In the complete version of the process, Marcel brings the mystery to light and fully possesses it only by externalizing it, writing down his impressions of the shifting steeples, and this expulsion is the virgin birth which corresponds to the miracu lous conception. If the mysterious essence which Marcel locates in himself is ultimately just himself—the past, seemingly dead self of his nearly-forgotten childhood or else his present, de pressed, barely-alive sense of who he is, a shrunken ego that seems to wander homeless in an abyss of not-being—then it is this self, revitalized by an infusion of outside life, to which he gives birth. In short, by the logic of fantasy, of magical thinking, he becomes his own mother: reminding us of the pregnant kitchen-maid (Giotto's Charity) whose pregnancy, whatever symbolic or allegorical meaning it may suggest, remains con spicuously literal and " real " (S, 61-2/1, 80-2). The fantasy of being impregnated by outside " life " is finally too threaten ing—life itself is too threatening—and so (as in a phobic reaction) Marcel expels the life within him like a dangerous, poisonous, foreign substance. He gives birth to a new self but the self that gives birth is, once again, empty, lifeless, dead.10 This fantasy of rebirth implies a serious division, within Marcel, between thought and feeling,11 between self-conscious awareness and actual emotion, in which any emotion is felt as a dangerous intruder upon the apparently calm, self-controlled surface of consciousness. His emotional life falls into the ex tended " manic-depressive " pattern of the Romantics, in which the child's joy in the natural world, seemingly lost, is recovered in the more sophisticated form of imagination, the " faith that creates " no longer dependent on the outside world. But, despite 10 Cf. Bersani, Marcel Protist, p, 55. Cf. Proust, Contre Sainte-Beuve (Paris: Gallimard, 1954), p. 63.</page><page sequence="23">176 Randolph Splitter his joy in nature, Marcel's childhood is already neurotic and anxiety-ridden. The anxiety of separation and loss is succeeded by sudden joy, the illusion of fecundity, of a creative power within him, but just as he wishes his mother would go away again after she comes to spend the night with him, he must detach himself from his own pleasure and return to his original low-energy (high-entropy) condition. In this respect he is like a shaman who needs to come out of his ecstatic, visionary trances in order to put natural or supernatural powers to good use. Like his aunt Léonie, Marcel is afraid of being overwhelmed by too much excitement, of losing control—it is just this uncon trollable quality which excites him—and so he must cool off his excitement by a renewed effort of self-consciousness and self control. As we have seen, this too makes him happy, but this new happiness seems more like a sense of relief, renewed calm, the kind of tranquility that even his mother's kiss seemed to promise.12 The Marcel of the Combray years seems to " feel " so much, but it is just because he feels at the mercy of his feelings that he longs to feel nothing at all. The end result of this strategy might be complete autistic withdrawal, but instead, at the end of Le Temps Retrouvé, Marcel turns himself into the selfless artist who, like a pregnant woman who dies in childbirth, like his own self-sacrificing mother and grandmother, has no life of his own but creates a new, ongoing life out of his own imagination. Indeed, in this remarkably self-centered kind of self-effacement, the Proustian artist resembles the primitive shaman who func tions on the borderline of his society, withdrawing from it like Proust into his corklined room, going off by himself so that he may be possessed by the forces that animate the universe and even take possession of them. Needless to say, the analogy between the artist and the shaman, which I have belabored, 12 Marcel's desire to restore the " thermodynamic " balance of his over excited emotions may remind us of Freud's death instinct, in which the pleasurable release of energy tends toward the absolute »ero of death. (Cf. Jean Lapanche and J. B. Pontalis, " Death Instincts," The Language of Psycho analysis (New York: Norton, 1974), pp. 97-103, and Laplanche, Life and Death in Psychoanalysis (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1976), pp. 103-24). However, his longing for an almost deathlike tranquility is not an inborn instinct but an obsessional strategy, born out of guilt and anxiety, for greater self-control and self-sufficiency.</page><page sequence="24">Proust's Combray 177 should not be taken too far, but the artist's implicit belief in an animistic universe, his penchant for taking metaphors liter ally, his uncertainty about where the self leaves off and the " world " begins, reflect a way of seeing things that is more magical than scientific. Moreover, as Lévi-Strauss points out, magical thinking, which assumes that nothing is accidental and everything has meaning, that the universe is orderly and logical, is not unscientific.13 On the contrary, this " science of the concrete " explains too much, if only because these primitive " scientists " are afraid of leaving anything unexplained. Freud ian psychoanalysis is also a science of the concrete, and if it too tends to leave nothing unexplained, that is because it seeks to explain not the structure of the universe but the structure of magical thinking. In " Combray," Marcel appears as the victim of childish fears, of his own fantasies, but it is precisely his faith in the magical essence of things, the mystery and beauty that disturb him, that will enable him to be an artist. Or, rather, it is by becoming an artist that he will attempt to allay his anxieties, resolve his ambivalences, and realize his fantasies— and to pretend that he has succeeded. Randolph Splitter, Ph.
