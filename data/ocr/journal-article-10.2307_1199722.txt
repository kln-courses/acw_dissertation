<plain_text><page sequence="1">Language, Logic and God. By FREDERICK FERRE'. New York: Harper &amp; Bros., 1961. vi+184 pages. $3.50. Contemporary American philosophy has, generally speaking, appeared little concerned with the recent efforts among British philos- ophers to bring the contentions and methods of linguistic analysis to bear on religious and theological language. Professor Ferrd's book is a discerning introduction to, and synopsis of, the main currents of opinion offered within this continuing discussion. The book is also a noteworthy attempt to locate the basic sources of the "confusion" which seems to permeate this contemporary analysis. The author begins by distinguishing be- tween the "logics" of what he labels "verifica- tional" and "functional" analysis, respectively. While the rigid empirical criteria of the for- mer eliminates the possibility of "factual meaning" in theological discourse, the "more flexible analytic approach" of the latter en- courages, by seeing language "more as a nat- ural growth or an organism" than as "a use- ful invention" (p. 58), a careful considera- tion of how, for example, a theologian or a religious devotee intends to use his words. Ferrb adopts the perspective of "functional</page><page sequence="2">CRITICAL REVIEWS 73 analysis" and proposes to listen attentively to the explanations of theological language offered by theologians themselves. He finds that the "logic of analogy" is an inadequate attempt to escape between the anthropomorphism of univocal language about "God" and the agnosticism produced by viewing such lan- guage as equivocal. The "logic of obedience," that is to say, the view that it is only in the "obedience of faith" that human language is able to express truth or meaning about God, also fails to justify theological language, for "in making the logical structure of theological language . . . irrelevant to the content it supposedly bears, obedience . . . has called into question the nature of theological mean- ing and truth" (pp. 89-90). Ferr6, likewise, has misgivings about the so-called "logic of encounter," for, while maintaining that an experiential "encounter with God" is basic to the comprehension of theological speech, this theological tradition, he contends, is left with the problems of (1) "testing symbols against religious experience" (p. 100) and (2) dis- tinguishing between "genuine" and illusory "encounters with God" (p. 104). The examination of these theological posi- tions, he asserts, not only allows us to under- stand the divergence of attitudes (concerning theological language) among the functional analysts whom he later discusses but also per- mits us to appreciate more fully what he subsequently offers as "the manifold logic of theism." For theistic language, he insists, can- not be confined to the terms of any one logic. Even though, for example, the academic dis- course of systematic theology is partly char- acterized by an adherence to formal logic, it is, Ferr6 contends, the "informal rules of inference" which provide this type of "lan- guage about God" with its distinctive syn- tactic structure (p. 153). Moreover, despite the cited inadequacies of both the "logic of analogy" and the "logic of obedience," for instance, each has its contribution to make to theological discourse: While the former assists systematic theology by offering "guid- ing rules" for the determination of its con- cepts, the latter helps by emphasizing that "the society of which theological language is the distinctive speech is the Church . . ." (p. 158). Ferr6's concluding statement, namely, "that theological language on its semantic dimen- sion functions as metaphysical language" (p. 163), should, like many other portions of his conscientious analysis, ferment lively discus- sion among philosophers and theologians alike.
