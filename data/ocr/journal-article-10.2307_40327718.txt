P. Elkin IN my presidential address to the Anthropological Section of the * Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science in January 1935,2 I gave a survey and summary of anthropological research in Australia from the early days of settle- ment up to that date, and indicated some of the problems which awaited solution. The contributors to our knowledge of Australian anthropology have included not only the comparatively few and recent specialists or trained anthropologists, but also many non- trained workers (explorers, missionaries, government officials and settlers) who made the study of some aspect of primitive culture a relaxation or an addition to their daily task. In the address referred to, I emphasized the importance of the contributions of such amateurs, for without them we should not possess any contemporary information regarding the natives of several regions. In March of last year (1938), I published in Oceania a summary of the anthropological research carried out during the previous eleven years under the auspices of the Australian National Research 1 This article is an enlargement of a short paper read at the Canberra meeting of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science, January 1939. 2 Report of Melbourne Meeting of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science, 1935, pp. 196-207.

The list of publications occupies nine pages of Oceania, with about 150 titles, and there is much more to be published. The money for this work has been provided by the Rockefeller Foundation and administered by the Australian National Research Council. It has amounted in all to about £60,000. We have, however, almost come to an end of our financial resources and the grants have ceased. Two final pieces of field work research are in progress ; one into the languages of north-west Australia and the other into the social anthropology of a community near Maprik, inland from Wewak, Sepik district, New Guinea.4 Oceania, which is published quarterly by the Australian National Research Council and now (September, 1939) commences its tenth year and volume, is assured financially by the Council for the next four years at least, and will continue to serve as a record of research in Australia, its territories and adjacent islands. It circulates in most countries, and is used by the world's leading anthropologists in their studies of human society and culture. Through the Fisher Library, the University of Sydney, exchanges are arranged with over fifty anthropological and kindred publications in Australia and abroad. Like the majority of scientific journals, Oceania is not as financially secure as could be desired, but another hundred subscribers would make it self-supporting. Oceania, as is now well known, is devoted to the study of the native peoples of Australia, New Guinea, Papua and the Western Pacific, and is primarily a record of research carried out by anthrop- ologists whose work has been made possible by grants from the Australian National Research Council. But its pages are thrown 8 " Anthropological Research in Australia and the Western Pacific, 1927-1937," Oceania, Vol. VIII, No. 3, pp. 306-27. 1 Dr. A.

A perusal of the nine volumes of Oceania will reveal that many articles have been published for such workers.5 5 Beatrice Blackwood, " Report on Field Work in Buka and Bougainville," Vol. II, No. 2.

Although these have so far consisted almost wholly of reprints of series of articles which had previously appeared in Oceania, their issue has been appreciated. The first two, The Social Organization of Australian Tribes, by A. R. Radcliffe-Brown, 1931, and Studies in Australian Totemism, by A. P. Elkin, 1933, are almost out of print, while the third, Studies in Australian Linguistics, edited by A. P. Elkin, 1938, is in steady demand. A fourth has just been issued, namely Rotuman Legends, by C. M. Churchward. It contains a series of texts with translations of one of the most interesting of Pacific Island languages. Unfortunately there are no funds available for the publication of the thorough grammar and dictionary which Mr. Churchward has prepared. The Australian National Research Council has also published this year under the title of A New Guinea Language Book, a short grammar and dictionary of a New Britain language, Tinaia Tuna, the work of Mr. J. H. L. Waterhouse, of the New Guinea Administration native school at Nodup, Rabaul. Neither Mr. Churchward nor Mr. Waterhouse worked in the field under the auspices of the Australian National Research Council, but their work is of the type which the Anthropological Committee of the Council desires to encourage, both for its academic and practical value. The Tinata Tuna Dictionary will be much appreciated by adminis- trative officials, missionaries and natives of western New Britain and other places in New Guinea, for a knowledge of this language [Continuation of footnote 5.] Ibid., " Foreign Words in some Kimberley Tribes of North-West Australia," Vol. VIII, No. 4 (and in Monograph No. 3).

The Monograph, Rotuman Legends, will find an interested public in the natives and missionaries of Rotuma, as well as amongst linguistic specialists.6 Miss Ursula McConnel has prepared a Grammar and Phonetics of the Wikmunkan language, North Queensland, and Mr. T. G. H. Strehlow has done the same for the Aranda. It is hoped that both will soon be published in this Monograph series. In addition to being responsible for the publications already mentioned, the Australian National Research Council also assists financially when necessary and possible in the publication in book form of the results of its field workers' researches. In doing this, it deserves well of the anthropological world, and is at the same time fulfilling its trust to the Rockefeller Foundation. In passing, it should be mentioned that the Australian National Research Council does not claim to have been responsible for all the anthropological research which has been carried out in the Australian regions during the past twelve years. Unfortunately, only a very small amount of Australian money has been available for this purpose. The Board of Anthropological Studies of the University of Adelaide has had some funds which have been used to augment the grants from the Australian National Research Council, and so has been able to organize mostly short mid-year expeditions into various parts of South Australia and adjacent parts of Western and Central Australia. The University of Melbourne, too, has financed or assisted Dr. W. Ivens and Dr. Donald Thomson in their work in the Solomon Islands and the northern parts of Australia respectively. But that is all. More has been done by workers financed by institutions abroad ; Dr. D. S. Davidson, of the University of Pennsylvania, as a Fellow ^of the Social Science Research Council, U.S.A., visited the Australian museums and also part of Arnhem Land (Wardaman tribe) in 1930-31, and as a result gave quite an impetus to the study of aboriginal art and material culture. Dr. Rohéim, 1929, studied the mythology and ritual life of the Central Australians from the psycho-analytical point of view, and later did similar work in Dobu. More recently, 1938, an expedition « Incidentally, both of these publications will probably pay for themselves.</page><page sequence="6">6 ANTHROPOLOGY IN AUSTRALIA, 1939 from the Frankfurt Museum (Germany) spent about seven months studying the art, material culture and social organization of part of the Northern Kimberley (Walcott Inlet-Prince Regent River), and in 1938-39 Dr. Birdsell, of Harvard University and the Peabody Museum, with the assistance of Mr. N. B. Tindale of the South Australian Museum, carried out research in physical anthropology amongst the mixed-blood population of Australia. In the New Guinea region there have been Miss Beatrice Blackwood at Buka, Morobe and south-west New Britain ; Mr. Gregory Bateson, Dr. Margaret Mead, Dr. R. Fortune, Messrs. Reed and Whiting and Mr. Pierre Ledoux in the Sepik River and adjacent districts, and Dr. D. L. Oliver in Bougainville. All of these, with the exception of the first two, who had English support, have been financed either from their own private resources or else by American institutions, and have been commended by such bodies as the American Museum of Natural History, the Peabody Museum, Yale University and the Social Science Research Council of America. In addition, in both regions, some missionaries have made useful contributions ; for example, the Rev. J. R. B. Love, Rev. E. Worms and Dr. H. Nekes in north-west Australia, the Rev. T. T. Webb in North Australia, and the Rev. Stephen Lehner, the Rev. F. Kirsch- baum and the Rev. P. K. Neuhaus in New Guinea. These latter and others like them can only give part of their time to the anthropological study of the peoples where they are working, but their opportunity is unique, though unfortunately in some cases they are severely handicapped by a lack of training in social anthropology. If we keep in mind the work done by scientists financed directly by English and American institutions, by missionaries in their own time and by the Australian National Research Council's workers with Rockefeller grants, we see that Australia itself has done very little indeed in proportion during the past twelve years. We should however, try to increase the amount of anthropological research sustained by Australian resources. The Rockefeller grants, as already stated, have ceased, and the Foundation expects and hopes that Australia will now carry on the work to which such a great start has been given. And I have no hesitation in asking for financial support</page><page sequence="7">ANTHROPOLOGY IN AUSTRALIA, 1939 7 from individuals and Governments in Australia. As I shall show, there are both purely scientific and also practical reasons why anthropological research should be continued, indeed with increasing vigour in the Australian and adjacent fields. I am, therefore, pleased to be able to record a resolution which was passed by both the Anthropology Section and by the General Council of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science at its Canberra meeting, January, 1939 : " That in view of the fact that grants from the Rockefeller Foundation to the Australian National Research Council for anthropological research in Australia have now ceased, this Associa- tion urge on Australian Governments and individuals the need for financial support for the continuance of this research in Australia and its territories on the foundations laid during the past twelve years." On account of its past experience of this work, the Australian National Research Council is the medium through which gifts and grants for research should be made. The Council is now a committee of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science and is Australia-wide in its outlook.7 The question naturally arises : what further work remains to be done ? (1) Physical Anthropology. In this field there is still scope for research, not only for the recording of the ordinary external measure- ments of the living subjects, but also for those other observations which are of special interest to physiologists and pathologists. University expeditions from Adelaide and Sydney have in the past made useful contributions in this regard, in both cases assisted financially by the Australian National Research Council. In the former case, the Board for Anthropological Research of the University of Adelaide has organized several short expeditions in conjunction 7 In matters concerning anthropological research, the executive of the Australian National Research Council is advised by its Committee on Anthropology, of which the Professor of Anthropology (the University of Sydney) is chairman. The latter is also director of the research to which approval has been given. The committee consists of members drawn from each Australian State, who receive the minutes of meetings, though in many cases can seldom, if ever, attend.</page><page sequence="8">8 ANTHROPOLOGY IN AUSTRALIA, 1939 with the South Australian Museum. The following is a brief summary of the results : Research in physical anthropology proper has been for the most part carried out by Dr. T. D. Campbell, Dr. H. Gray, Dr. Brian Maegraith, Dr. Fenner and Dr. Cecil Hackett. The results include not only the routine measurements of height, limbs, head, face etc., but also observations by means of a colour scale of the skin-colour (in various parts of the body) and of the colour of the eyes, examination of the teeth, samples of hair, colora- tion of the oral cavity, fingerprints, impressions of the creases of the hands, physical deformities etc.8 Standard photographs have been taken of all the natives measured, together with a number of still pictures of native life and a series of cinema films. Plaster casts have been obtained of the faces and in some cases of the trunks and limbs of full-blood Aborigines. Observations have been made on native acuity of vision and hearing and of discrimination of colours. In addition to the above, a complete survey has been made of all the natives measured, for the observation of any pathological lesions, caries of the teeth, etc. Notes have also been obtained on childbirth and on new-born infants. This type of survey should be continued and in particular Wassermann tests for the presence of syphilis and yaws should be carried out in Central and South Australia as well as elsewhere. Professors Cleland and Harvey Johnston have carried out an extensive series of blood groupings, the total now reaching 776. These results have proved of considerable importance inasmuch as only the two blood groups O and A have been found in the full-blood natives : 299 belonged to group O and 477 to group A, the relative numbers of 0 and A varying somewhat in different districts. Further work should be done on the subgroups of group A and of the factors M and N, and the mixed-bloods should also be grouped. 8 One report of the excellent work done is provided in " Physical Anthropology of the Aborigines of Central Australia," by T. D. Campbell, J. H. Gray, and C. J. Hackett, Oceania, Vol. VII, pp. 106-39, 246-61, while a fairly complete list of articles on Physical Anthropology results is given in " Anthroplogical Research in Australia and the Western Pacific, 1927-1937," by A. P. Elkin, Oceania, Vol. VIII, No. 3, pp. 326-7.</page><page sequence="9">ANTHROPOLOGY IN AUSTRALIA, 1939 9 The food supplies of the natives have been studied in all the regions visited ; plant and animal foods have been identified. Full notes have been published by Professors Cleland and Harvey Johnston on plant and grain foodstuffs used in north-west South Australia and part of the Northern Territory, and their method of preparation.9 Sir Stanton Hicks of Adelaide University and his colleagues have investigated the metabolism heat production and control of heat loss, which enable the Aborigines to survive in the primitive conditions in which they live in arid Australia with its very hot days, and sometimes freezing nights. The results have an important bearing on the physiological reactions of mankind in general.10 Workers from the University of Sydney have done somewhat similar work in physical anthropology. The basal metabolism, blood-grouping and dentition of groups of Aborigines of New South Wales and Queensland were studied in 1927-28, and Professor Whitridge Davies made two expeditions in 1932 and 1933 into Central Australia (on the first accompanied by Dr. H. S. H. Wardlaw) to carry out important physiological researches amongst the desert natives. Needless to say, as these notes indicate and imply, there is need and opportunity for much more research in human biology in aboriginal Australia. (2) Archceology. There is likewise opportunity for archaeological work, provided that it is scientifically performed. Old camp sites in the open and in rock-shelters are awaiting excavation and will eventually throw light on the history of Aboriginal settlement in Australia. The members of the Ethnological Departments of the Australian Museum, Sydney, and of the South Australian Museum, Adelaide, and others associated with them, have been able to do some work in this section. Two sites on the lower Murray were examined 9 J. B. Cleland and T. H.

But so far there have not been funds for a systematic attack on Australian archaeology.12 (3) Aboriginal Art. The study of rock-carvings and rock- paintings is unfortunately already a matter of pre-history in several parts of Australia, since no investigation was made while the Aborigines were still making and appreciating them. But where there are any Aborigines remaining in the region, their interpretation of the carvings should be obtained. In some cases, of course, in which the native culture has been broken down for a couple of generations, we cannot be sure that the interpretation obtained from the tribal remnants who are probably of mixed blood, is the original one ; but, at least, it is Aboriginal and therefore of significance. In this way I am gaining some insight into the meaning of the rock carvings and engravings on trees and wood of the central and north coast of New South Wales. Above all, we must remember that the Aborigines' works of art of all forms play or played a part in their social, economic or religious life, and it should be our endeavour to find out what that part was or is. We realize this in those regions where this art is still an element in living native culture. As an illustration, we may refer to the cave-paintings of Northern Kimberley, Western Australia. Every gallery, and there is usually one for each local patrilinea! clan, at least, of the Ungarinyin and Worora tribes and probably also of the Wumnabal, includes not only representations of the clan 11 H. M. Hale and N. B. Tindale, " Notes on some Human Remains in the Lower Murray Valley, South Australia," Records of the South Australian Museum, Vol. IV, No. 2, pp. 145-218. 12 An impetus has been given to this work in New South Wales by the arrival ol Professor J. Shellshear who had been associated with the late P. van Stein Callenfels and others of the Archaeological group in the Dutch East Indies, and is now Hon. Archaeologist at the Australian Museum, Sydney, and by the experience and training obtained by Mr. F. D. McCarthy of the Department of Ethnology at this Museum, with the same team of famous archaeologists. An example of the contributions which a careful non-professional worker can make in his spare time is provided by Mr. Edmund D. Dow in his " Aboriginal Ceremonial Cairns near Broken Hill," Oceania, Vol. IX, No. 1, pp. 3°-37-</page><page sequence="11">ANTHROPOLOGY IN AUSTRALIA, 1939 11 totems (certain animals and plants and other objects), but also a picture of an anthropomorphic being. The latter is distinguished by the presence of the eyes and nose, but the absence of the mouth. Many attempts have been made to determine the meaning of this strange figure since examples of it were first discovered by Sir Geo. Gray in 1828, but strangely enough, although the Aborigines were living in the region with comparatively little local contact with whites, no attempt was made until 1928 to ascertain from the Aborigines themselves the significance of the paintings. It was my good fortune to be working amongst the Ungarinyin (Walcott Inlet) in that year ; after I had gained an understanding of the kinship, local organization and secret life of the tribe, I was taken to some of the galleries and gradually gained an appreciation of the meaning of these strange paintings (known as Wand j ina) and their relations to the social, economic and religious life of the tribe. They belong to the Wandjina cult which is localized in each local clan territory and is in its turn closely related to the totemic organization and beliefs with which the increase of natural species is associated, and with beliefs regarding pre-existence and the fate of the spirit after death. An account of this has been written elsewhere,13 and it is sufficient to state here that an understanding of the paintings, both of Wandjina and other subjects on the galleries, could not have been gained without the approach through the social organization and totemism of the tribes. Generally speaking the principle implied in this is true of almost all Aboriginal art : it is not a culture trait existing by itself and in its own right, but is an integral part and expression of religious and social life. Let us hope that it may be possible for trained sociologists to study, before the opportunity passes, this aspect of native culture in all its inter-relations in those 13 A. P.

Fortunately, the interest in Aboriginal art has revived in recent years, with the result that endeavours are being made to record and describe exactly all the rock carvings and rock shelter paintings that can be discovered, designs on weapons, implements and ornaments, and even the temporary forms of ornamentation applied to the human body for corroboree and ceremonial purposes. Spencer and Gillen always paid attention to this aspect of their field work in the Northern Territory and showed the relation of the art to the ceremonial life and often also to the kinship system. Thus the references to art in their two great works on The Native Tribes and The Northern Tribes respectively of Central Australia, and in Spencer's Native Tribes of the Northern Territory, are to be found not only in the specific chapters on Decorative Art, but also in the appropriate sections of the chapters on Weapons and Implements, Sacred Symbols (Churinga), Totemic, Initiation and Burial Ceremonies. Dr. H. Basedow also paid attention to native art, but did not have the same grip of the social and religious background as did Spencer and Gillen and so could not interpret the art as adequately as they.14 This type of work in central and the northern parts of Australia has been continued by various recent field workers, including Dr. D. S. Davidson (Wardaman tribe), Miss Ursula McConnel (Cape York Peninsula, especially with regard to designs on weapons and imple- ments), Miss O. M. Pink (Northern Territory), Mr. C. P. Mountford (Central Australia), the Frankfurt Museum Expedition and myself.15 14 Vide, for example, the very interesting chapter on aboriginal art in Dr. Basedow's book, The Australian Aboriginal, pp. 297-358. It contains a useful description of subjects, designs and methods and indications of what various designs denote, but the impression one gets is that it is a wholly exoteric study. The relation of the art to social, economic and religious life has not been grasped. 15 D. S.

The Sydney-Hawkesbury River District is one of the most interesting regions from this point of view, and a good beginning for the recording of the rock carvings there was laid by W. D. Campbell, R. Etheridge Jnr. and R. H. Mathews, while the late W. W. Thorpe, Ethnologist of the Australian Museum, Sydney, not only visited and recorded many of the " galleries " but also summarized our knowledge of this variety of native art.18 The discovery of more and very interesting carvings [Continuation of footnote 15.] Western Australia/1 Trans.

Frankfurt Museum Expedition, and A. P. Elkin. Vide footnote 13. 16 Thus, there are errors in Dr. Davidson's description and interpretation of the " cave-paintings " of the Lightning Brothers, near Delamere Station, North Australia ; e.g. Dr. Davidson's statement on p. 112 implies that these brothers exist now as spirits, and frequent the gallery during the wet season. The fact seems to be that they are reincarnated in two living men who visit this dream-time gallery before the " wet " and repaint the figures so as to make the rain come. Dr. Davidson rightly notes that the paintings do not suggest that Yagtchadbulla is the younger, but rather is the elder of the two. He does not seem to realize, however, that his informants were referring to the present reincarnations of the heroes. Thus the explanation seems to be that the present reincarnation of that hero is younger than the present reincarnation of his brother, and is not married because his elder brother must be first settled in marriage. The term, bulla, suffixed to his name means " having the foreskin," suggesting that the present Yagtchad may not yet be circumcised, let alone younger than his brother. There are other points of interest raised by Dr. Davidson's description of these paintings (op. cit. 110-20) which can be discussed elsewhere. Any errors which he has made could only be avoided by gaining an adequate apprecia- tion of the background of social organization, spiritual beliefs and religion, and this implies a long acquaintance with the tribe. In the meantime such preliminary essays as Dr. Davidson's are very helpful. 17 These are not true carvings, but consist for the most part of grooved outlines or intagliated surfaces on the rock of the object being depicted. They are often referred to as petroglyphs. For early references, vide W. W. Thorpe, " Early References to Aboriginal Rock Carvings," Mankind, Vol. I, No. 1, pp. 7-11. 18 W. D.

Dr. H. Basedow drew attention in 1914 to the interesting series which he found in the Flinders Range, South Australia,20 and since then further studies of similar galleries in these mountains have been examined by members of the Anthropological Society of South Australia.21 Other examples exist in a few parts of Queensland (seen by myself in the south-western corner), at Port Hedland in Western Australia, at various sites in the Northern Territory and Victoria, and finally at Mootwingee, near Broken Hill, western New South Wales, a recent discovery which created much interest.22 All the known sites of carvings and paintings have not yet been fully recorded and studied and there must be many more. In other words there is much work to be done if financial support be forth- coming. In order of preference, I should recommend that native art, in all forms, be studied first of all in those regions where it still 19 F. D.

Mr. W. J. Enright has for many years helped to keep alive the interest in the rock-carvings and also cave paintings, having been associated in earlier years with both Mr. W. D. Campbell and Mr. R. H. Mathews. In addition to making records himself, he has been and is always ready to assist the members of the university and museum staffs and all who are sincerely interested in such work.

This will enable us eventually to understand in some degree its significance in those areas where it is now an archaeological specimen. In the meantime, all those interested must exert their full endeavours at least to locate the sites and preserve them intact for later study.23 There are still individuals of the collecting type, who will chisel out and remove rock carvings, sometimes destroying the significance of a series of carvings, while others, seeing nothing of special interest in them, might in the process of settlement, destroy them. In mentioning location and preservation of these rock carvings and rock paintings, I do not mean that they should not be recorded at once, if possible (by description, drawing and photography), but that if the money available be limited, as it is, it should in the first instance be used for the study of native art in regions where that art still functions in Aboriginal Hfe. In any case, there are and will always be a number of interested persons, some well qualified, who will devote their spare time to this work in the neighbourhood of our cities and country towns, while trained members of museums and university staffs can do likewise. In all cases, the efforts should be co-ordinated through the Department of Ethnology and Anthropology in the Museum or University or the Anthropological Society in the various States. This is of course especially necessary with regard to the excavation and examination of old camp and burial sites, but should not be neglected when one intends to examine rock paintings and carvings. Assistance and advice, the results of experience and training, should always be sought.24 23 Groups like the Anthropological Societies of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia and the Department of Anthropology, University of Sydney, are doing much in this matter of preservation and receive support from the Depart- ments of Lands. 24 Incidentally, all those interested should read Dr. D. S. Davidson's Aboriginal Australian and Tasmanian Rock Carvings and Paintings, published in 1936 (as Memoir, Vol. V, of the American Philosophical Society), a work which enables us very simply to see the range of these forms of native art and to see some of the problems raised. R. H. Mathews gave a brief but interesting introduction to the study and recording of these subjects in his " Rock Carvings and Paintings of the Australian Aborigines," Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc, Vol. XXXVI, pp. 466-78. Vide also his " Australian Rock Carvings," op. cit. pp. 195-208.</page><page sequence="16">i6 ANTHROPOLOGY IN AUSTRALIA, 1939 The study of the designs both in engraving and painting on weapons, implements and sacred objects is also important. Spencer and Gillen always paid attention to this, and recently Mr. F. D. McCarthy and Dr. D. S. Davidson have endeavoured to systematize this study, providing a survey of the forms and methods used, and to some extent endeavouring to find the significance of the patterns.26 It is not just a matter of describing and illustrating the designs but of ascertaining their meaning. They may only represent traditional patterns of prettiness, thus witnessing to an aesthetic appreciation, but more often than we think, the designs have mythological, religious and magical significance. Though it be only a shield or club which is being decorated, the very efficacy of the weapon may be believed to arise from the design and what it represents. Perhaps too, it had to be " sung &gt;# over while it was being engraved or painted. The study of such decorations in the field should eventually throw light on the problem of the relation of aesthetic appreciation to economics, religion and magic, and finally to that faith and conviction of certainty and success which is one of man's fundamental psychological needs.26 Here then is another reason for the support and prosecution of field research. (4) Linguistics. Many studies of native languages have been provided in the past, mainly by missionaries, but for the most part they were incomplete and usually unrelated to the cultural back- ground. I have pointed this out in the opening article of Oceania Monograph, No. 3, Studies in Australian Linguistics, published in 1938. Recently, however, some more thorough work has been taken in hand. Mr. T. G. H. Strehlow in Central Australia, building 25 F. D. McCarthy, Australian Aboriginal Decorative Art, published by the Australian Museum, Sydney, 1938, pp. 1-48. D. S.

Rev. J. R. B. Love has done valuable grammatical work for the Worora in north-west Australia, and Dr. Nekes has been making exhaustive studies of languages in the Broome region, north-west Australia. Some of the results of these two workers are included in the above mentioned Monograph, while the latter has a grammar and comparative dictionary almost ready for publication. In addition, several of the social anthropologists have also provided brief and useful preliminary studies of the languages of the tribes amongst whom they have worked, and at present Dr. A. Capell is in the field studying the Northern Kimberley languages. There is, however, sufficient linguistic work for several specialists for many years to come. The results of such research are not merely academic, for they can, and should, be used by missionaries and others who work amongst the Aborigines. We realize to-day that a language cannot be adequately studied apart from an understanding of the culture of which it forms an integral part. Lists of words, even long dictionaries, are of little use ; grammars, if well prepared, are of much more value, but these cannot be fitted into any preconceived form, classical or otherwise, for they are misleading if they are not reflections, or rather media, of the manner of thought and life of the communities concerned. Further reference is made to this in the article on " The Nature of Australian Languages " to which reference has been made,27 and is well illustrated in a Grammar of the Wikmunkan Language, which is. to be published in Oceania, Vol. X, and in the Oceania Monograph No. 5. (5) Social Anthropology. There is still much to be done before the study of the social anthropology of the Aborigines is complete. There are some areas and tribes which have not been studied and others which should be restudied. For, although we may study a culture very thoroughly in its many aspects for one or two years, we cannot expect to understand fully a people in such a comparatively short time. Moreover, when we go back to the same area after an 27 Oceania, Vol. VIII, No. 2, pp. 127-69, reprinted in Monograph No. 3. B</page><page sequence="18">i8 ANTHROPOLOGY IN AUSTRALIA, 1939 absence, we not only add to the amount of knowledge previously gained, but with regard to some matters, find reason to modify our previous interpretations. We must always remember that social anthropology does not aim at a mere recording, or a verbal photo- graph, as it were, of what a people does or believes, but at an interpretation and understanding of that people's life in all its aspects. The research of the past twelve years has filled in many gaps in our knowledge of the social anthropology of the Aborigines. Thus in the north-east, the work of Dr. W. E. Roth and of the Cambridge Expedition to Torres Straits has been supplemented by the field work of Miss U. McConnel, Dr. D. Thomson and Dr. L. Sharp, with the result that, when all the reports have been published, we will have a reasonably complete account of the tribes in most of Cape York Peninsula. Likewise, Spencer and Gillen's and Pastor Strehlow's work supplemented by that of Mr. T. G. H. Strehlow, Miss Pink and Dr. W. E. H. Stanner will cover Central Australia fairly adequately, while the more northern parts of the Territory are covered by Spencer and Gillen, Dr. Basedow, Dr. Stanner, Dr. Hart, Dr. Warner, Dr. Davidson, Dr. Thomson, the Rev. T, T. Webb, and a work I am preparing in conjunction with Mr. W. E. Harney who has lived for twenty years in this region with a seeing eye and a hearing ear. Reference to our increasing knowledge of the north- western corner of the continent will be made presently. Our information regarding the South Australian region was very imperfect in spite of the writings of Gason, Siebert, Howitt, Spencer and Gillen, Home and Aiston, on the north-east, Taplin on the south-east, and various writers (mostly included in J. D. Woods, Native Tribes of South Australia) for the Adelaide-Port Lincoln districts. But the full reports of my own work in 1930, when all published, will round off the earlier results in the north-east and provide a useful foundation for further work in the western half of the State.28 Professor Radcliffe-Brown's work on the Yaralde and neighbouring tribes had organized our knowledge of the Aborigines on the lower Murray, 28 Some reports have been published at various times since 1931, mostly in Oceania, but also in Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, 1931, and in Man, 1939-</page><page sequence="19">ANTHROPOLOGY IN AUSTRALIA, 1939 19 Mrs. D. Bates' recent book (The Passing of the Aborigines) gives some information on the western tribes, while the reports of the Adelaide University Expeditions have always added something to our know- ledge of the life and beliefs of the Aborigines in the various centres visited each year. Both Professor Radcliñe-Brown and I and also Mrs. T. Kelly of the Department of Anthropology, Sydney, and Mr. W. J. Enright have successfully added to the knowledge gained by earlier workers on the coast of New South Wales, chiefly A. W. Howitt, R. H. Mathews and John Fraser. But in spite of all this work and progress we must not beguile ourselves into thinking that the task is really completed in any one region, or that there are not fresh fields to be studied and others where it is still possible to add to the little that was obtained by earlier and usually untrained observers. Professor Radcliffe-Brown's work on the Kariera and other tribes, of the central and western coast of Western Australia and in the Darling River region of New South Wales is an example of what can be done and so, too, are the notes made by Mrs. Kelly on Fraser Island and Cherbourg, south- eastern Queensland. And here I am thinking not so much of the study of the changes which are in progress, as of the original culture, of which some, and occasionally much, remains. There are still almost untouched fields in the eastern parts of Western Australia and parts of the Kimberley Division and even in Arnhem Land, and in some instances the native order of life is not yet fundamentally altered. Opportunity remains also for further intensive work in parts of South Australia and Queensland, as well as in other regions where trained anthropologists have made investigations, for a few months' or one or even two years' study of a tribe cannot give a complete picture and understanding of its life, though it will do much in that direction. It is for this reason that two or even three methods are adopted ; namely a preliminary survey of a region, intensive work in a limited area of that region, and finally, a special survey to solve various problems which have been raised during the general survey and the intensive study, and to investigate some particular aspect of native life. Thus, in the first place a worker with a special grip of Australian social anthropology moves from tribe to tribe in a selected region,</page><page sequence="20">20 ANTHROPOLOGY IN AUSTRALIA, 1939 spending from a month to three months here and there as opportunity- occurs, obtaining in each a good grip of the kinship system, social groupings, totemic organization and belief, economics and some knowledge of the religious, ceremonial and magical life. At the same time he selects a tribe in which the opportunity for intensive study of various social, totemic and other cultural problems exists. This leads to the second method : intensive research by the same or another worker in a limited field, which should occupy from one to two years. Then thirdly, this person will return when possible to fill up gaps in his information and understanding, or perhaps another will make a survey of a more extended nature for the purpose of specializing in one aspect of Aboriginal life in several tribes which have been previously studied, e.g. totemism, linguistics or economics, or changes in the social and religious life. An illustration may help : In 1927-28 I spent twelve months in the Kimberley Division ; of this time almost three months were spent amongst the Nyul-Nyul, Bad (Bardi) and Djaui tribes from Beagle Bay to Sunday Island, a little less with the remnants around Broome and the Karadjeri at La Grange, two and a half with the Ungarinyin at Walcott Inlet, and a short visit to the Worora at Port George IV, about the same with Forrest River tribes and three weeks moving round from Wyndham to Derby, getting some idea of the location and social organization of the tribes in East Kimberley. An examina- tion of my results, both published and unpublished, shows that by being all my waking hours on the " job " and by having the advantage of a fairly thorough knowledge of what was hitherto known of the Aborigines, I gained a very real and remarkably correct understanding of Aboriginal social organization, totemism and ritual (initiation, totemic and burial), and that my knowledge was not merely abstract and formal. But it is quite obvious that in three or even five months, a person cannot obtain a complete knowledge of a people's life ; he may grip the general pattern of that life, but not the rich and varied way in which it is expressed. Initiations, deaths, mourning, births, increase-rites, acts of magic, irregular marriages, elopements, economic exchanges, quarrels and dreams will not occur to order, and in some cases, when they do happen, occupy weeks and even months. It is therefore necessary to follow up that work in the</page><page sequence="21">ANTHROPOLOGY IN AUSTRALIA, 1939 21 tribal areas where it is likely to be most productive of results. This has been and is being done in the Kimberleys. In 1929 and 1930 Mr. (now Dr.) R. Piddington did further work mainly amongst the Karadjeri ; in 1934 and in 1935-6, Miss (now Dr.) Phyllis Kaberry29 studied first the Forrest River tribes and later some of those in East Kimberley, checking and building on my findings regarding totemism, local organization and sub-sections, and in particular, studying the women's life ; and now Dr. A. Capell is specializing in a study of the languages of the tribes whose social and religious life has been studied by previous workers, and is also able to throw further light on the mythology and social life of the region. In addition, the Rev. J. R. B. Love, in the course of his long period of service of over twenty years amongst the Worora who in mythology, social organization and language are similar to the Ungarinyin, has contributed much to our knowledge of the language and beliefs of his tribe ; Father Worms has collected information from tribes in the Southern Kimberley, the Rev. Dr. Nekes has made a thorough study of the Nyul-Nyul and related languages of this region, and last year, after consultation with myself, a Frankfurt Museum Expedition spent several months in Northern Kimberley (from Walcott Inlet to the Lower Drysdale) examining the cave paintings in particular and studying the social anthropology in general.30 When the results of all these workers have been published and collated, we shall obviously have a fairly thorough understanding of the Aborigines of the Kimberley Division. 29 Vide titles of papers on north-western Australia in " Anthropological Research in Australia and the Western Pacific, 1927-1937," Oceania, Vol. VIII, No. 3, p. 321, and at the end of this paper. 30 J.

Thus, though our systematic knowledge of the social anthropology of the Aborigines has been vastly increased during the past twelve years, thanks almost wholly to the Australian National Research Council, there is much to be done yet, not only in the matter of describing tribes not yet studied, but in deepening our under- standing of Aboriginal social life. (6) Psychology. Associated with the previous discipline is the psychological study of the Aborigines so that we may learn (1) what are the driving forces in the individual lives, and whether these people differ in any way from ourselves in this regard, (2) what light psycho-analysis can throw on their mental and emotional life, (3) what is their response to suitably arranged intelligence tests, and whether such tests throw any light on the possibility of the Aborigines adapting themselves to civilization, and (4) how they compare with other primitive peoples in the matter of intelligence and so get a psychological answer to the common question : Are the Aborigines the lowest race of mankind ? Needless to say, the psychological approach must be made against a background of understanding the native culture, otherwise it will be dealing with individuals in vacuo, and will not produce results of any value. Professor S. D. Porteus has directed his attention to problems (1), (3) and (4), especially (3) and (4), and in a lesser degree Dr. R. Piddington and Dr. H. K. Fry have done the same, while Dr. G. Rohéim has made the psycho-analytical approach.31 In all aspects 31 S. D.

[Footnote continued on next page.]</page><page sequence="23">ANTHROPOLOGY IN AUSTRALIA, 1939 23 of psychological research, however, little more than a beginning has been made ; it is to be hoped therefore that this work may be resumed not only because of its practical significance, but also because of its theoretical importance for psychology in general. (7) Culture Contact. Omitting archaeology, the various anthropological disciplines to which reference has been made, throw light incidentally on the contact of white and black in Australia, and in hardly any part of the continent to-day can they remain merely academic, but must be directed, at least in part, towards the problems of racial contact and cultural diffusion and clash. Anthrop- ologists should not only try to ascertain what a people's culture once was, but also what it now is in the process of change. The approach must be dynamic and not static. All cultures are in process of change ; this was even true of Aboriginal culture before the coming of the whites, but, of course, the change is especially marked and rapid where two peoples, one civilized and the other primitive, are brought into economic, social and religious contact and conflict, as in Australia and its territories. The cultural change, however, is almost wholly confined to the indigenous primitive people. Such changes are of important sociological interest in themselves as well as being of significance to administrators and missionaries. Social anthropologists, as distinct from archaeologists, are not concerned with human or cultural fossils, but with human beings in society, who have to adjust themselves to one another and to their environ- ment, and in some cases also, as in Australia, have to readjust themselves to conditions arising from a clash of peoples and cultures. For my own part, although I have always endeavoured in field work to understand the social organization, economics, totemism, ritual, mythology and magic of the tribe as it was, apart from white [Continuation of footnote 31.] H.

As Professor of a Chair, largely supported by the Commonwealth Government, and charged with the anthropological training of administrative officers and cadets, this was and is my duty. In I933&gt; I published a " Policy for the Aborigines " which became the main positive plank in the programme of the Association for the Protection of Native Races of Australia, a policy which I have since elaborated in various articles and addresses, and the principles of which have been adopted by the Commonwealth Government in its new policy for the Northern Territory Aborigines.32 My own association with successive Ministers for the Interior has been made the more useful as a result of investigations made by other field workers of the Australian National Research Council, especially Dr. W. E. H. Stanner, Mr. T. G. H. Strehlow (now a patrol officer in the south-west of the Northern Territory) and Miss O. M. Pink in the Northern Territory and Miss McConnel in north Queensland. Dr. Stanner especially has made a very detailed study of culture contact in the Daly River district and also, at my request, made a special inquiry in the Tennant Creek district at the time when changes were being made in the Aboriginal reserve there on account of the finding of gold in the neighbourhood. Of similar significance has been the survey of the north-eastern corner of Arnhem Land by Dr. D. Thomson for the Commonwealth Government, together with his suggestions for the better administra- tion of that particular district. In New South Wales also the Department of Anthropology has sought to assist the Government to improve its method of aboriginal administration. The reports and representations (based on careful 32 The Minister for the Interior honoured me by asking me to assist the Secretary of the Department and himself in drawing up the general principles of the new policy which was adopted early this year, and has resulted in the creation of a special Department of Native Affairs in the Northern Territory, with Mr. E. W. P. Chinnery as its first director. The latter will gradually organize it somewhat along the lines found so successful in New Guinea native administration and will also co-operate with missions, assisting them financially and inspecting their educational and health activities. Patrol officers will receive training in anthropology.</page><page sequence="25">ANTHROPOLOGY IN AUSTRALIA, 1939 25 study of the situation) made mainly by Mrs. T. Kelly and partly by myself to the present Aborigines' Protection Board and then to the Minister in Charge and later to the Public Service Board have drawn attention to the need for a change in method and objective. A new officer has been appointed, a plan to appoint a new Board for the Welfare of Aborigines has been announced, which will include an anthropologist, and some regard is being paid to the value of anthropological investigation and knowledge. In other words, in Australia, as in New Guinea, applied anthropology is now considered necessary, but such acknowledgment demands continued research in culture-contact and native adminis- tration and education. (8) People of Mixed Blood. The previous reference to culture contact leads to the necessity for appreciating the position, capabilities, handicaps and opportunities of the mixed-bloods in Australia. This is a very important and practical matter. There are about 20,000 of these folk and ultimately they must become part of our life - social and religious as well as economic. Almost all of those brought up in the country and bush districts in association with full-bloods have imbibed much of the outlook and beliefs of the latter, and although they have mixed a great deal with whites in economic pursuits, yet in time of anxiety, illness and death revert to the old ways. This must, of course, be correlated with the fact that very little whole-hearted endeavour is made by ourselves not merely to give them our view-point, and teach them some of our beliefs and knowledge, but to show that we are sincere in our efforts by admitting them more readily to our own social, religious and economic life. Most of the " half-castes " realize sooner or later that our way of life is not really for them ; they are just to be " hewers of wood and drawers of water " - if no one else wants to do the hewing and drawing. It is the realization of this circum- stance that tends to drive them back to the old Aboriginal beliefs, that there they might find comfort and moral strength. It is the result of a feeling of inferiority for which we are responsible. Even men in high places still glibly announce as a truism that the half-caste inherits the vices of the races of both parents, but none of the virtues. There is no proof for this indictment, but until we take the education</page><page sequence="26">26 ANTHROPOLOGY IN AUSTRALIA, 1939 of the mixed-bloods seriously and in sincerity make available for them better opportunities than they now possess for a complete life, we must expect all sorts of unpleasant reactions. We need a careful examination of their present social and economic position, and this can only be done by fairly long and intensive personal association with, and study of, them in their environments on station, mission settlement, in the bush and in town. A good start has been made. About five years ago I received the co-operation of about fifty persons engaged in the supervision of half-castes or government and mission settlements. They kindly answered a long questionnaire and in some cases wrote several times. In addition, I was able to visit a few of the settlements myself and more than once, so that I know some of the individuals and their conditions fairly well. Finally, Mrs. Caroline Kelly has, under the auspices of the Australian National Research Council, made a very thorough sociological study of several settlements, and is now engaged in writing up the results of this research. All this work is of practical value to those concerned with the administration of the half-castes, and should on no account be neglected. Only a small portion of my own work has been published.33 An earlier study of the mixed-bloods was made by Professor Griffith Taylor and F. Jardine, in which some attention was paid to sociology, as well as to anthropometry.34 I have recently had a special study made of half-caste school children attending a general school, by a teacher who has shown the necessary interest and faculty to do this. The results are important seeing that the background is borne in mind in the observations, marks and tests. The recent survey of half-castes by Dr. Birdsell and Mr. Tindale, 33 Mrs. Kelly presented a preliminary paper, " The contact of whites and mixed blood Aborigines in a New South Wales country town " at the Canberra meeting of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science, January 1939. As for some of my own results, vide " Civilized Aborigines and Native Culture/1 Oceania, Vol. VI, No. 2, pp. 117-146 ; " Native Education with special reference to the Australian Aborigines," Oceania, Vol. VII, No. 4, pp. 459-500 ; " The Reaction of Primitive Races to the White Man's Culture : A Study in Culture-Contact," The Hibbert Journal, July, 1937, pp. 537*45 • 34 " Kamilaroi and White," Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of N.S.W., Vol. LVIII, 1925, pp. 268-294.</page><page sequence="27">ANTHROPOLOGY IN AUSTRALIA, 1939 27 to which reference has already been made, should be very helpful, even though attention has been paid chiefly to anthropometry and some psychological testing and the investigators could not spend a sufficiently long time in any one district to make a satisfactory sociological study. However, enough has been said to show that there is opportunity and need for research into the problem of the mixed-bloods in Australia. Conclusion. In the above survey of research done and of the needs and opportunities for further research, I have referred almost exclusively to Australia itself, but a perusal of the general report on " Research in Australia and the Western Pacific, 1926-38," to which reference has been made, will show that a very creditable amount of anthropological field work has been carried out in Papua, New Guinea and Melanesia during the past twelve years both by workers of the Australian National Research Council and by others from abroad. But a few dozen expeditions cannot exhaust more than a very small fraction of this large region, never mind how much care be taken to select type cultures and to round oñ the survey of districts. The field is almost illimitable, and once again, the research is of practical as well as of theoretical and purely scientific value. Administrative and missionary work goes on but more and more those responsible insist that this must be based on an anthropological approach.35 Thus, the more we know of these Papuan and Melanesian peoples, the better can we govern them and help them in their adjustment to present day conditions. Incidentally, as field work advances, so can administrative officers and missionaries destined for that region be better prepared in their university course (Sydney) by being provided with a knowledge of the particular people whose lives they are to influence. 35 This insistence is made a practical reality in Papua by the work of the Govern- ment Anthropologist, Mr. F. E. Williams, some of whose reports are concerned directly with the contribution which anthropology can make to administrative and missionary work. His reports are all the more valuable by reason of his length of service in the Territory, his thorough knowledge of the Papuan and Papuo-Melanesian and his understanding of administrative and missionary objectives. New Guinea and North Australia could well do with similar permanent officers.</page><page sequence="28">28 ANTHROPOLOGY IN AUSTRALIA, 1939 This region, too, presents many interesting problems, such as the multiplicity of languages, the diffusion of culture-traits and the contact of various peoples and some fascinating institutions like the Kula exchanges, the Malagan ceremonies and the gardening homestead system of the newly found peoples on the interior highlands of Papua and New Guinea. With reference to the work which has been accomplished and also that which remains to be done, I desire to emphasize that I do not ignore or undervalue the contributions of amateur anthropologists, that is, of those who have not had graduate and post-graduate training in the University and directed training in the field. As in the past, so in the future, there is a great opportunity for the amateur or the person who can only be a field anthropologist in his spare time. I hope that government officials, missionaries and others who can, will contribute of their best to our knowledge of native peoples. But I am sure that these folk themselves will agree that the greater part of the work must and should be done by trained anthropologists. This requires money, organization and workers. The last named are available or can be trained, and the Australian National Research Council, with its years of experience and its machinery for selecting, guiding and assisting workers, is ready to do its part ; moreover, it is no longer a separate body, but is now a committee of Fellows of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science, and so is truly an Australia-wide institution for scientific research. The first requirement is the one which is now lacking. I appeal in the first place to Australian individuals and Governments to support anthropological research which is in danger of coming to an end as far as Australia is concerned.
