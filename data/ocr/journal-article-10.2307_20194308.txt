<plain_text><page sequence="1">Literature for content area learning ANNE TROY Literature can be read for fun but also for interdisciplinary teaching and learning. Includes bibliography of science trade books and historical fiction. FOR SOME YEARS now, educators have agonized over what appears to be a steady decline in reading ability. The annual report card on reading skills in our major cities is appalling. Some suburban high schools say as many as half of their incoming freshmen are not above the third grade level in reading. Five million job hunters cannot even read the help wanted ads. In junior colleges, 30 to 50 percent of entering students need reading help. More than 20 percent of Americans sixteen or older cannot understand at least 10 percent of standard applications for driver's licenses or Medicaid. As usual, the blame is spread around. The colleges blame the high schools, the high schools blame the elementary schools, and the teachers in the lower grades blame the home environment. Children's desire for knowledge is sometimes turned off by poor materials, poor methods, and poor appreciation of the joys of reading. Teaching through a greater emphasis on literature seems a partial answer to the problems of materials, methods, and interest in reading. Take advantage of the children's attention and enthusiasm during the story hour in elementary classrooms. Combine reading and other subjects. Stories just for fun should not be eliminated, but they can also be used to help keep the idea that learning is fun alive in the minds of young students. This is also a way to give children more practice in reading which is purposeful and which appeals to a wide range of tastes. Good books which teach in a pleasurable way are not rare. A look at some in the area of science, other people and places, history, and geography reveals the number of 470 The Reading Teacher February 1977</page><page sequence="2">things which literature can teach and also ways in which literature is sometimes preferable to lectures and textbooks. When carefully selected and used, these books can bring surprising results, along with eliminating undue pressure and allowing children to absorb that which they are ready for. In the areas of science, books acquaint children with the earth's features, climate, and resources. They develop the observer and the experimenter in children. The pendulum of emphasis has swung so far in the direction of firsthand experiences, of discovering for oneself by observation and experi mentation, that some teachers have relegated reading to the back room and feel guilty when others suggest reading as a part of the science program. The fact is that children cannot discover everything in science through firsthand experiences. This is not to belittle firsthand experi ences. It does suggest that an educated person depends on reading for information, inspiration, and appreciation, and that early, satisfying experiences with "reading to discover" are also important for children. Millicent Selsam (1967), a writer of science books for children, has said: "The role of the writer is to write the book so that a child can feel he is participating in an observation of a discovery.... A good nature book should stimulate a young person to hear, see, smell, and taste things?to use all of his senses to observe." Most kinds of observation lead to questions, so a picture of Earth in space may bring the question, "What holds it up?" Questions, in turn, lead to experimentation, research, and more observation in order to answer questions such as "How and why do caterpillars build cocoons and change into butterflies?" Such questions are likely to arise and when there are interesting questions to be answered, learning takes place. Good science books help children to be aware of the world around them and make it possible for them to discover pleasure and happiness by becoming more conscious of the beauty of their immediate world. Outstanding science trade book titles are available in a yearly list published in spring issues of Science and Children. A short review and the appropriate grade level are given for each book. Many of the science book topics are important to children, that is, of high interest to them. For example, Our Captive Animals by J.J. McCoy includes true stories of captive animals, illustrated with photographs. The problems of keeping animals safe and healthy, and of breeding them, are among the subjects included. The true story of eleven-year-old Jon's trip to the Everglades is presented in narrative form in The Mystery of the Everglades (Graham and Graham). The absorbing account of the accurate, detailed observations illustrated with photographs im presses the reader with the message, "Save the Everglades." One of my little friends, a Boy Scout, brought another of these books to my attention. The scout troop had been trying to put into practice some of the suggestions in Going to Waste: Where Will AII the Garbage Go? by James Marshall. The vivid presentation of the ever increasing problem of waste disposal and the disastrous future if we fail to solve it impressed this group of twelve-year-old boys so much that they were spending Saturdays and after school hours collecting cans from restaurants, recreational areas, and ditches of roads for recycling. Some children want to read books about a variety of life cycles of birds, insects and animals. Others turn to a book like Sterling North's story of a TROY; Literature 471</page><page sequence="3">Photo by Michael Kalbough raccoon, Rascal, in order to share North's memories of and love for nature. Two recent titles of this type are A Skunk in the House (Colby) and The Year of the Badger (Burkett). The entertaining account of a family's experiences with a pet skunk shows that the owners do not train the skunk but rather it trains the humans. The skunk's food likes and dislikes, taming and housebreaking and ailments, intelligence, idiosyn crasies, and scent are a part of a delightful narrative. The Year of the Badger is entertaining as well as informing about the antics, mis chievousness, inquisitiveness, neat ness, and habits of the badger. Many children, after a fictional exposure to spiders in Charlotte's Web (White), want to learn more about different spiders. Other children are drawn from factual to fictional material on the same subject. A spider book that may be used with Charlottes Web is My Daddy Longlegs by Judy Hawes, a fascinating and informal discussion story about daddy longlegs and spiders. The author begins by asking unusual questions and through the story explains the answers. In straightforward, direct prose Alice Hopf describes a year in the life of a wood ant in Biography of an Ant. Although there is no fiction alization or anthropomorphism, the ant is called "Rufa" and its story is told in narrative form. Like the illustrations, the text is clear and explicit, with a matter-of-fact approach to the organization and specialization of the ant colony. During the 1970s children's book publishers have produced many problem centered books on divorce, drugs, and various ethnic groups, adjustments or acceptance. How ever, according to many librarians, children do not seek out these types of books unless adults suggest them. Children do ask for books about other countries and cultures. Some of these questions may be the result of class assignments but a consider able number may result from television. In a large city children become aware of ethnic differences at an early age. Books such as Carol Ann Bales has written about Chinese 472 The Reading Teacher February 1977</page><page sequence="4">American and American Indian children can be used to arouse interest and appreciation of the differences found in American society and in the world. Chinatown Sunday and Kevin Cloud are based on tapes made by children who describe their lives and families. The story of Lillian has less action than Kevin's description of an urban Chippewa family, but it has the same colloquial flow as Lillian tells how her family came to Chicago, her friends in school, her ability as a baseball player, her favorite holi days, and the customs and traditions her family observes. HISTORICAL FICTION History is one of the areas where fiction seems to be preferable and many times nearly replaces textbooks. The child is not interested in and probably should not be required to know dates and other boring facts. Instead the flavor and spirit of different eras should be shared. Good fictional works can create the atmosphere of an era in a memorable way, whereas textbooks have a ten dency to be boring, overly factual, and quite forgettable. The idea that history is people rather than just a series of events comes through in historical fiction. A child will learn to love and respect history more if he experiences it vicariously with a character with whom he can easily identify. Fortu nately, there are quite a few very good historical novels for children. Understanding the past is not easy but children have one asset that many adults have lost: their imagina tions are easily led to worlds of fantasy. Understanding the past is, after all, an action of imagination, an exercise of a controlled fantasy. The American Revolution was above all a political event, one so imprisoned by cliches and mythology that restoring it to comprehensible proportions is not easy, especially for children, until they are encouraged to use their imaginations and to take a jump backward in time. Jean Fritz's book, And Then What Happened, Paul Revere?, presents for young readers a spirited account of the life and times of Paul Revere. Fritz's second book for the American Bicentennial, Why Dont You Get a Horse, Sam Adams?, contains some defects in the character of Adams but such faults are incidental to a good tale about Adams learning to ride a horse on the way to the Continental Congress. The Revolutionary War is the subject of many fictional and semi fictional works. Mary Kay Phelan's Four Days in Philadelphia?1776 and Midnight Alarm: The Story of Paul Reveres Ride are good examples of important historical events presented in a narrative. Jean Fritz's Early Thunder describes the fierce debate of colonists preceding the war. Fa mous names appear in these novels, but they appear as personalities rather than statues. A good histori cal novel includes the main events of the period it covers; it shows the reader the events leading to the war as they were experienced by young people. Best of all, because the reader becomes emotionally attuned to and identifies with the characters, he really feels what independence means. In My Brother Sam Is Dead (Collier and Collier), the Revolution, its agonies, and its injustices are seen through the eyes of Tim, the polit ically ambivalent son of Tory parents and brother of a Patriot soldier. In July 1779, Tib, of The Corduroy Road by Patricia Clyne, escapes from his Tory uncle after the death of his father and heads for West Point. The description of Tib's adventures on the way and the discovery of his father's secret about the Corduroy Road are vivid, realistic, and excit ing. In Two If by Sea by Leonard E. TROY: Literature 473</page><page sequence="5">Fisher, hundreds of British troops have been reported gathering on Boston Common. In this suspenseful story, four men trapped inside the city of Boston try to send a message to the Minutemen and other rebels waiting in the countryside. The actions of these four affect the future of all Americans on the evening of April 18, 1775. History class can be brought alive by the teacher reading books such as the ones above or by the dramatic presentation of short scenes. For example, the spirit of independence is conveyed much better through the reading of fiction than it is through the reading of textbooks. The chil dren see realistically drawn people as they really are affected by events of political dissent and war. There is a great deal of interesting, quality literature which can teach without pressure or preaching. Of course, each teacher must decide for the specific class how much of this type of teaching should be used. We should be aware of the possible danger of making literature too much of a teaching-learning medium which could turn children off to all literature for fun. When the teacher uses literature with great care, students will reap many benefits. Dry facts are soon forgotten; attitudes, feelings, and general concepts can remain forever. Why not, then, work to develop these in pleasant ways?
