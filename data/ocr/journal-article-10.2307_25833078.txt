<plain_text><page sequence="1">French Studies 69 LATE MEDIEVAL LITERATURE By ROSALIND BROWN-GRANT, University of Leeds i. NARRATIVE GENRES EPIC. C. Raynaud, 'Ganelon dans les enluminures du Xlle au d but du XVIe si cle. Premi re approche5, CRISIMA j, 69-89, charts the changing iconographical representation of this character and con cludes that his treachery is increasingly interpreted in the later Middle Ages as l se-majest rather than simply as betrayal. W. L. Hendrickson, 'Geste de Guillaume or de Garin de Monglane?5, Menard Vol., 667-78, contends that the term 'geste5 evolves from meaning 'historic exploits5 in the Guillaume cycle to meaning more generally 'a group of texts relating to a particular dynasty5 in that of Garin de Monglane; whilst S. I. James, ' "Pseudo55-courtly elements in a canonical epic5, Papers (ICLS 8), 367-74, takes issue with Gautier's exclusive definitions of the chanson de geste and offers a more positive assessment of the 'courtly5 Geste de Monglane with its amorous intrigues, fantastic episodes, and detailed treatment of individual behaviour. V. Naudet, 'Quand le roi frappe la reine: partir d'une sc ne de la geste des Lorrains', Bertrand, Geste, 445-59, compares the treatment of this episode in Garin le Loherenc and Gerbert de Metz in which the queen, Blanchefleur, is represented as a sacrificial victim struggling to remain loyal to her lineage whilst protesting against the corruption of her husband P pin's court. D. Collomp, 'Le doigt sur la dent (geste symbolique du serment sarrasin)', ib., 607-24, traces the development of this gesture as a standard topos of supposedly muslim mores in a range of epics from the 13th to the 16th centuries. F. Sinclair, 'Reproductive frameworks: maternal significance in Berte as granspi s\ Fest. Emden, 269-95, argues against the traditional view of the epic as exclusively concerned with patrilineal succession and sees texts such as Berte allocating an important role to the mother whose influence affects the positive or negative qualities of her offspring. J. A. Nelson, 'The function of prose in Godefroi de Buillon', ib., 327-37, notes how the author of this prose reworking strips his rhymed source down to its essential, factual elements. H.-E. Keller, 'Le clan de Girard de Vienne dans Galien le Restor ', Menard Vol., 713-22, regards this work as a precursor of Renaissance epic in its emphasis on family as a clan of individuals rather than as a traditional hierarchized feudal dynasty. Claude Roussel, Conter de geste au XlVe si cle. Inspiration folklorique et criture pique dans La Belle H l ne de Constantinople (PRF, 222), 452 pp., situates this chanson de geste in the context of later medieval reworkings of the folktale La fille aux mains coup es and examines how, in</page><page sequence="2">70 French Studies transforming it into an epic, the author personalizes and develops his main protagonists whilst at the same time highlighting the didactic and moral import of his text by introducing elements from hagio graphy. H. Akkari, ' "M re, tu souffriras et tu erreras": la souffrance et Terrance de la m re dans La Belle H l ne de Constantinople et dans Florent et Octavien', BDBA, 16:7-18, likens the suffering undergone by mothers sent unjustly into exile to the exploits of knights and deems their struggle to safeguard the family unit to anticipate the roman familial; whilst R. Bellon, 'Le renforcement affectif de la n gation par l'expression d'une valeur minimale dans La Belle H l ne de Constantino ple', Demarolk Vol, 105-18, examines F. M hren's linguistic category of reinforcement in the light of this text. M.-J. Pindivic, 'La d claration amoureuse dans la chanson de Doon de Maience et ses adaptations en prose', BDBA, 15, 1997:19-29, analyses how reworkings of the 14th to 16th c. vary in their treatment of this theme compared to the original version. I. Weill, 'Le ch teau d'Oridon dans la chanson d'Auberi le Bourgoiri, Actes (Rambures), 209-19, reads this work featuring a cruel and despotic lord presiding over a magnificent castle as a transposed representation of the political conflicts between feudal barons and the monarch which typified the reigns of Louis VI and Louis VII. ROMANCE. Two Medieval Outlaws: The Romances of Eustace the Monk and Fouke Fitz Waryn, trans. Glyn Burgess, Cambridge, Brewer, 1997, x -f 210 pp., is a modern English version of Li Romans de Witasse le Moine and Fouke le Fitz Waryn, with information on historical figures and MS tradition, as well as a useful index of proper and place names. I. I arrea Las Heras, 'Le Livre du Voir-Dit de Guillaume de Machaut: una nueva formulaci n del amor cort s', RLMed, 10:117-40, argues that M. places greater stress on personal experience than on ideal forms of amorous behaviour, thus putting forward a more naturalistic conception of love. F. Bouchet, 'Les "signes" de l'amour: strat gies s miotiques de la d claration amoureuse dans le M liadorde Froissart', BDBA, 15, 1997:167-78, examines how the various knights use their words and chivalric deeds as signs by which to declare their love for their ladies, despite being obliged to remain incognito; whilst in 'Rh torique de l'h raldique dans le roman arthurien tardif. Le M liador de Froissart et le Livre du Cuer d'Amours espris de Ren d'Anjou', Romania, 116:239-55, Bouchet contrasts F.'s use of heraldry as a m tonymie device which simultaneously hides and reveals the knight's identity with R.'s more static representation of arms as heraldic emblems of his illustrious knights. C. Rollier-Paulian, 'Le d nouement du Roman du Conte d'Anjou: une r ussite ou un chec?', PRIS-MA, 14:175-91, re-evaluates the romance's lengthy ending, stressing the religious and social significance of its didactic message of</page><page sequence="3">Late Medieval Literature 71 restitution and reparation; whereas in 'L'image de la m re dans le Roman du Conte d'Anjou', BDBA, 16:247-60, she argues that, due to his position at the court of Philippe le Bel, Jehan Maillart's preoccupation with upholding the social order leads him to suggest that a mother's role is simply to ensure the legitimacy of succession and thus the transfer of male power from one generation to the next. C. Ferlampin Acher, 'Le charme 'Artus de Bretagne', Menard Vol., 513-28, highlights its evocation of an ideal courtly world, reduced use of the fantastic and pathos, and valorization of verbal ruse and trickery; whilst in 'Les "deceptions" dans Perceforest du "fantosme" au "fantasme"', CRISIMA j, 413-30, she examines the significance of different types of illusion and apparition as formative moments of betrayal in the protagonists' moral itinerary. M. Szkilnik, 'Passelion, Marc l'Essili et l'id al courtois', Papers (ICLS 8), 131-38, demonstrates that these two characters from Perceforest and Tsa e le Triste respectively point to epic influence on later medieval romance as they reveal how violence, cruelty, and infidelity are the other side of the chivalric and courtly ideal of justice, generosity, and devotion. P. Victorin, 'La Reine Yseut et la F e Morgue ou l'impossible maternit dans Tsa e le Triste', BDBA, 16:261-76, argues that the author here transforms the figure of Yseut into a mother as a pretext for his continuation of the prose Tristan which, paradoxically, takes on a more burlesque and parodie tone as the dwarf Tronc largely usurps Yseut's nurturing role. S. Sturm Maddox, 'Alterity and subjectivity in the Roman de Melusine', Papers (ICLS 8), 121-29, contends that the impossibility of attributing a fixed identity to the character of M lusine, whose fairy 'otherness' makes her thoughts and feelings inaccessible to mortals, is symbolic ally linked to the inevitable decline of the dynasty that she has founded. A. Caillaud, 'The search for power: a female quest in Antoine de la Sale's Petit Jehan de Saintre', FCS, 24, 1997 [ 1998] : 74-83, maintains that the negative portrayal of Belle Cousine warns the reader against renegotiating the gender roles involved in courtly love within an established male hierarchy. R. Dubuis, 'La notion de Joie et son expression dans Saintr , RTUG, 55:113-23, analyses the ironic contrast between the text's extensive use of the term 'joie' and the author's disillusionment with an impossible ideal of love; whilst in 'Du bon usage de la "nouvelle" dans Saintr ', Demarolle Vol., 325-38, Dubuis puts the work's enduring appeal down to its blurring of generic distinctions. J. Dufournet and A. Poujet, 'La loi de la duplicit dans les Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles', ib., 339-52, stress how the narrator highlights the theme of trickery, and verbal ruse in particular, in order to teach the reader not to confuse appearance with reality. C. Brucker, 'Si/ainsi en moyen fran ais: autour de B rinus', ib., 133-48, compares and contrasts the relative occurrence and function</page><page sequence="4">72 French Studies of these two adverbs in this 14TI1-C. romance with Villehardouin's chronicle and Denis Foulechat's Polieratique. M. Thiry-Stassin, 'Larmes de femmes dans le Roman de Troie en prose (version Bodmer 147)', Menard Vol., 1377-89, notes the greater role given to women's laments in this version which she links to the shift of interest from women as mothers to women as lovers of the male hero. J. H. M. Taylor, 'The significance of the insignificant: reading reception in the Burgundian Erec and Clig s\ FCS, 24, I997[i998]: 183-97, argues that, by acculturation, the later prosateur assimilates a puzzling and disturbing model of Arthur's Britain to a more familiar and ordered Burgundian model of government; N. J. Lacy, 'Adaptation as reception: the Burgundian Clig s\ ib., 198-207, shows how, in the reworked text, irony is excised, style homogenized, and dialogue reduced to a minimum, probably in accordance with the literary taste of the later period; whilst M. Colombo-Timelli, 'Syntaxe et technique narrative: titres et attaques de chapitre dans Y Erec bourguignon', ib., 208-30, is a stylistic analysis of how Erec's actions are highlighted at the expense of Enide. Histoire de tres vaillans primez monseigneur Jehan d'Avennes, ed. Danielle Qu ruel (Biblioth que des Seigneurs du Nord), Villeneuve-d'Ascq, Presses Universitaires du Septentrion, 1997, 219 pp., is a new critical edition of this anonymous I5th-c. Burgund ian prose romance which forms the first part of a trilogy of texts that also includes La Fille du Comte de Ponthieu and the Roman de Saladin. Based on Paris BNF ms. fr. 12572, with Paris Arsenal 5208 as a control, this edition contains a substantial glossary and several small reproductions of ink and watercolour miniatures from the text. J. Cerquiglini-Toulet, 'Une parole muette: le rire amoureux au Moyen Age', Menard Vol., 325-36, surveys the variations on the theme of smiles and laughter as symptoms of an amorous disposition in a range of mostiy i4th-c. romances and lyrics. 2. POETRY David. A. Fein, Fran ois Villon Revisited (TWAS, 864), 1997, xiii -f 187 pp., surveys V.'s life and ouvre, devoting chapters to the Lais, Testament, and other poems, and examining his use of elements from the Bible and the Danse Macabre. Robert R. Daniel, The Poetry of Villon and Baudelaire: Two Worlds, One Human Condition (Currents in Comparative Romance Languages and Literatures, 52), NY, Lang, 1997, vi -f 196 pp., adopts a more innovative approach in comparing the two poets' works in terms of their emphasis on the physical rather than the spiritual world and of their exploration of the themes of decay, mortality, and transience. J. Ribard, 'Le Lais de Fran ois Villon et sa th matique symbolique', Demarolle Vol., 353-62, sees V.'s</page><page sequence="5">Late Medieval Literature 73 winter symbolism as positive, with its evocation of Christmas as a time heralding salvation and its image of being frozen suggesting a spiritual withdrawal from worldly disappointments. J.-C. Delclos, 'IiEntroubli de Villon ou la page que Ton ne peut tourner', ib., 363-74, reinterprets the famous stanzas xxxvi-xxxix of the Lais as expressing V.'s state of emotional and intellectual stagnation in failing to leave Paris for Angers and in finding his poetic inspiration run dry. A. Slerca, 'Un motif mythique de la Ballade des pendus de Fran ois Villon', RLaR, 102:179-90, traces the folkloric and mythical sources behind V.'s image of the human body being reduced to dust and ashes by the hostile elements of the natural world. B. N. Sargent Baur, 'Odd man out: Villon at court', Papers (ICLS 8), 57-65, assesses V.'s court poetry as the impersonal and somewhat lacklustre produc tions of a figure who received litde patronage from the aristocratic milieux of his day. C. Martineau-G nieys, 'L'espace dans le "Lais" et le "Testament" de Villon', Menard Vol., 957-68, discusses the representation of Paris as an enclosed and claustrophobic space which echoes V.'s own emotional isolation from his surroundings. C. Deschepper, ' "La M tamorphose Villon": pi ce en trois actes', LR, 52:3-20, reads V.'s last two poems and a sermon joyeux, the Sermon de saint Belin, as a triptych providing an ironic commentary on the Parliament of Paris which freed the author from the Ch telet in 1463. P. S lamme, 'Villon, une m saventure ignor e. "La pierre et la porte" [Legres et Vhuis]. Un essai d'approche des huitains xcv et xcvi du Testament (v. 990-1005)', MA, 104:91-105, reads these lines as a satirical and parodie attack on two of V.'s contemporaries -Jehan Cornu and Pierre Bobignon - for their role in a bloody confrontation between students and soldiery in 1452. M.-P. Su rez, 'La m re et la femme fatale chez Villon', BDBA, 16:237-46, compares the figure of V.'s mother praying to the Virgin to the planctus of Mary in Passion plays of the period and sees this pious representation as a counterbal ance to his usual image of women as faithless lovers. M. Laccassagne, 'Po tique et politique du corps dans l'oeuvre d'Eustache Deschamps', Bertrand, Geste, 321-37, reveals how D. makes satirical use of the image of the body in a number of his 'ballades morales' in order to deliver political and moral lessons against irrational inaction and insatiable greed which he regards as undermining good government in the French state. Le Purgatoire dyAmours, ed. Sandrine Thonon (Travaux de la Facult de Philosophie et Lettres de l'Universit Catholique de Louvain, 41, Section de Philologie Romane, 15), Louvain-la-Neuve, Louvain U.P., 175 pp., is the first modern critical edition of this prosimetrum, a late i5th-c. contribution to the debate on courdy love, which is based on Paris Arsenal 5113. M. Santucci, 'Adam de la Halle, auteur des Ver d'amours et des Ver de le mort?', Menard</page><page sequence="6">74 French Studies Vol., 1183-92, compares these two works with that of H linand de Froidmont on which they are heavily reliant and concludes that Adam was indeed the author of the former but not the latter text, which she deems to be inferior to his usual standard. R. Crespo, 'Due congetture fuorvianti: R.1541 (Richard de Fournival), v. 15 e v.26', CN, 58:91-100, corrects Lepage's edition by reading cje' for 'ne' in 'qe je vausise avoir moie' (v. 15) and by substituting 'nului' for 'ne la' and restoring the 'mais' in 'c'ains mais nului vi or en ai' (v. 26); whereas in 'R.1278 (Richard de Fournival)', Romania, 116:394-414, Crespo follows Zarifopol and Lepage in taking the a MS as the basis of a new critical edition of this poem, to which he appends a full set of explanatory notes. M. Amri, 'Symbolisme animal et souvenir amou reux dans le Bestiaire d'Amours de Richard de Fournival', BDBA, 15, 1997:31-43, discusses how the author deploys memory in order to recall painful experiences of love as part of his plea to his lady to requite his passion. Sylvia Huot, Allegorical Play in the Old French Motet: The Sacred and the Profane in Thirteenth-Century Polyphony (Figurae: Reading Medieval Culture), Stanford U.P., 1997, 236 pp., is a ground-breaking study which examines the allegorical and parodie interaction between the multiple voices of the motet as they articulate competing secular and religious discourses of desire. G. Mombello, 'A propos d'une dition pr originale de la ballade de Cl ment Marot. Deux Noels du XVI si cle', Menard Vol., 993-1006, transcribes two poems from Seville Biblioteca Colombina 15.2.16(8), one of which is an earlier version of a ballad printed in the 1532 edition of the Adolescence clementine. G. Gros, 'Ecrire et lire au Livre de Pens e. Etude sur le manuscrit personnel des po sies de Charles d'Orl ans (Paris, B.N.F., fr. 25458)', TLit, 11:55-75, examines C's progressively deepening introspection as he abandons pure lyricism and becomes more resigned to his fate as a captive; whilst R. C. Cholakian, 'Charles d'Orl ans: the challenge of the printed text', FCS, 24, 1997t1998]: 119_26, sees C's writing primarily as an act by which he attempts to secure the volatility of the spoken word. J. H. M. Taylor, 'Inescapable rose: Jean le Seneschal's Cent Ballades and the art of cheerful paradox', MAe, 67:60-84, assesses the intertextual relations between this work and the Roman de la Rose, concluding that the author here offers a sophisticated and deliberately ambiguous analysis of the amatory state. L. C. Brook, 'The optimistic love-poet: Philippe de Beaumanoir', Papers (ICLS 8), 197-206, examines how, in the Salu d'Amours and the Conte d'Amours, P. appeals to the lady to alleviate his suffering in the confident expectation that she will answer his pleas; whilst in 'The Demandes d'Amour of the Chantilly and Wolfenb ttel manuscripts', FCS, 23, I996[i997]: 222-35, Brook stresses the importance of these two large collections of demandes, a</page><page sequence="7">Late Medieval Literature 75 genre which was derived from an aristocratic social game. A. Arm strong, 'Two more rebus-poems by Jean Molinet?', Scriptorium, 51, 1997:76-80, is an edition of two previously unattributed rebus poems by M. preserved in Paris BNF ms. fr. 19165, with suggested solutions to the puzzles they contain. David Cowling, Building the Text: Architecture as Metaphor in Late Medieval and Early Modern France (Oxford Modern Languages and Literature Monographs), Oxford, Clarendon Press, x + 245 pp., examines how the rh toriqueurs, and Jean Lemaire de Beiges in particular, employ metaphors of the human body, the state, memory and the text as buildings in order to deliver a variety of didactic and political messages to their literary patrons and to fashion the self as a voice of authority. R. Trachsler, 'Cent s nateurs, neuf soleils et un songe. Encore sur Machaut, la Sybille et le cha non manquant', Romania, 116:188-214, identifies Ovide moralis , xiv, w. 1121-88 as the source of the Sibylline episode in the Fontaine amoureuse and analyses how M. changes the significance of this passage in his discussion on the nature and function of dreams as part of the lover's experience. Isabelle B temps, LTmaginaire dans l'oeuvre de Guillaume de Machaut (Biblioth que du XVe si cle, 59), Champion, 472 pp., examines M.'s debt to and dialectic with the key sciences of his day (astronomy, arithmetic, geometry, m decine, and geography, etc.) in his construction of a poetic universe which privileges instability and ambiguity over certainty and fixity. M. Boulton, 'The lady speaks: the transformation of French courtly poetry in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries', Papers (ICLS 8), 207-17, compares and contrasts the nostalgia for a lost ideal expressed by the male voice in Alain Chartier's Belle dame sans merci with the critique of courtly ideology voiced by the female figures in Machaut's Voir-Dit and Christine de Pizan's Livre du Due des Vrais Amans. Catherine Attwood, Dynamic Dichotomy: The Poetic (P in Fourteenth- and Fifleenth-Century French Lyric Poetry (Faux Titre, 149), Amsterdam, Rodopi, 228 pp., is an innovative study that discusses the different ways in which Machaut, Froissart, Deschamps, and Christine distinguish between their authorial voice and the first-person speaker of their texts. Attwood concludes that the key relationship each explores is that between, respectively, for M., the T and the 'Other'; for F., the T of the present and that of the past; for D., the T and a range of externalized personae; and for C., the T and various external actants such as Fortune, which brings about the subsequent transformation of this first-person voice. Two timely additions to the study of C's lyric poetry are The Love Debate Poems of Christine de Pizan: Le Livre du D bat de deux amans, Le Livre des Trois jugemens, Le Livre du Dit de Poissy, ed. Barbara K. Altmann, Gainesville, Florida U.P., 294 pp., which is a new critical edition of these three texts based on Harley 4431, featuring an extensive</page><page sequence="8">76 French Studies introduction offering interpretive analysis of the poems and a discussion of the MS tradition, as well as a useful glossary. Christine de Pizan and Medieval French Lyric, ed. Earl Jeffrey Richards, Gainesville, Florida U.P., ix + 241 pp. is an important collection of mostly new essays, whose principal aim, according to the editor ( 1 -24) is to stress the innovative nature of C's lyric output: W. D. Paden argues that she radicalizes the carefully defined generic forms of late medieval lyrical genres by introducing a more subjective tone than that of her literary predecessors (27-49); J. C. Laidlaw compares C's Cent balades to both Machaut's works in this genre and the Livre des cent balades in order to show how she combines formal innovation with a more personal and polemical content (53-82); B. K. Altmann examines the thematic relationship between the 'lay mortel5 and the Cent ballades d'Amant et de Dame to which it is appended and concludes that the former acts as an envoi to the latter by summing up the perils for women of passionate love (83-102); J. Laird and E. J. Richards read the Due des vrais amans not as a romance but as a dramatized collection of lyric and prose in which G. stages a dialogue between various male and female voices that exposes the faults and limits of courtly love and values (103-31); N. Margolis analyses how C. deploys both clerkliness and courdiness in her complainte poems in order to expound her vision of woman's real place in the process offin'amor (135-54); L. J. Walters reveals how C's use of the translatio studii topos in her lyric poems and the Mutaci n de Fortune enables her to represent herself as an authoritative commentator on the political and social ills then affecting the French state (155-67); C. Mc Webb discusses how, in the Cent ballades d'Amant et de Dame, C. revises the empty formalism of courtly lyric in order to create a new kind of female subjectivity (168-83); B. M. Semple traces the development of C5s phenomeno logy of beauty from her emphasis on its immediate impact on the audience's passions in the lyric to her portrayal of a more intellectual and internalized meditation on aesthetics in the dream-vision (187-205); and E. J. Richards contends that C. renews the medieval lyric by reintroducing history and experience into her poems in line with her politically committed prose ouvre (206-29). 3. DRAMA Jean Molinet, Les Pronostications joyeuses, ed. Jelle Koopmans and Paul Verhuyck, Geneva, Droz, 255 pp., is an important new critical edition of M.'s parodie predictions - complete with suggestions on how to decode his cryptic messages - which includes readings from Cambridge, Gonville, and Caius College, MS 187/220, aversion not consulted by Dupire, the previous editor. A. Hindley, 'Les vu Pechie</page><page sequence="9">Late Medieval Literature 77 Morteil: dramatizing sin in the Old French Moralit ', RoS, 32:21-32, re-evaluates various morality plays for their narrative, dramatic, and visual representation of the individual's struggle with the forces of evil. M.-O. Bodenheimer, 'L'expression dramatique de la d claration amoureuse dans Le Jeu de Robin et Marion d'Adam de la Halle', BDBA, *5&gt; *997 : I45~55&gt; stresses the importance of the knight's declaration to the shepherdess as the motor of the action in this form of dramatized pastourelle. J. Enders, 'Medieval snuff drama', Exemplaria, 10:171-206, assesses the difficulties of determining true levels of violence in medieval plays, citing the alleged execution of a convicted murderer in 1549 during a performance of the Judith and Holofernes story in Tournai. Graham A. Runnalls, Etudes sur les myst res. Un recueil de 22 tudes sur les myst res fran ais, suivi d'un r pertoire du th tre religieux fran ais du Moyen Age et d'une bibliographie (Champion-Varia, 14), Champion, 503 pp., is a major collection of reprinted articles from 1973-96 which cover key issues such as generic convention, perform ance, MS tradition, dating and technical vocabulary. E. Pinto Mathieu, 'Ch teau et mondanit dans la Passion de Jean Michel (XVe si cle)', Actes (Rambures), 229-39, analyses the representation of the palaces of Herod and Mary Magdalene in this play both as a valuable source of information on I5th-c. manorial life and as negative symbols used to warn the audience against the dangers of worldliness and vanity. J. D. Wilkins, 'Corps et biens: the body as currency in fifteenth-century Myst res de la Passion', FCS, 24, 1997 [1998]: 254-72, maintains that the prevalence of metaphors of the body to express the ransom and redemption exchange between God and Satan is determined by contemporary preoccupations with drama and commerce. J.-C. Bibolet, 'Les gestes d'adoration, de pri re, d'offrande et de violence dans Le Myst re de la Passion de Troyes', Bertrand, Geste, 93-107, points out the greater number of stage directions given in the Troyes version compared with those in Gr ban; whilst V. Dominguez-Vignaud, 'Les gestes de Marie dans les Myst res de la Passion: les Planctus dans la Passion du Palatinus, la Passion Nostre Seigneur ti la Passion de Gr ban', ib., 201-17, shows how the representation of Mary's sorrow at the foot of the Cross evolves from being purely lyrical to increasingly dramatic. M.-O. Boden heimer, 'Le role da la M re dans les Miracles de Nostre Dame par personnages', BDBA, 16:49-57, assesses the literal and spiritual aspects of motherhood in this play; whereas H. Charpentier, 'Figures de la m re dans le Mistere du Viel Testament, ib., 59-70, sees Sara, Rebecca, and Rachel as more developed individuals here than in the Vulgate, which thus emphasizes their maternal role in establishing the lineage of Abraham. R. Deschaux, 'Structure et sens du Myst re du roy Advenir', RTUG, 55:97-102, gives a synopsis of this reworking in dramatic</page><page sequence="10">78 French Studies form of the legend of Barlaam and Josaphat and analyses its literary qualities, particularly its varied used of verse forms, as well as its didactic and religious message; P. Walter, 'Noms de diable dans deux Myst res du XVe si cle: La Pacience de Job et Le Myst re du roy Advenir', ib., 103-12, traces the folkloric origins of the names of various demons which they mention; whilst Y. Le Hir, 'Sur les citations latines dans la Moralit UOmme p cheur', ib., 125-31, inventories the different types of Latin quotations cited and assesses their function in delivering the text's message of repentance. B. Roy, 'Getting to the bottom of St. Caquette's cult', Ziolkowski, Obscenity, 308-18, offers a radically new interpretation of Le Grant Voiage et p lerinage de sainte Caquette as a witty and scatological farce about how a woman cures her sexual frustration by kissing an obscene relic. *Recueil de farces (1430-1550). Vol. XII, ed. Andr Tissier, Geneva, Droz, 404 pp., is the latest volume in the series and contains editions of the Deux Savetiers, Brus, Le Savetier Audin, Martin de Cambrai, and La Pip e. 4. HISTORICAL AND POLITICAL LITERATURE Froissart, Chroniques. Livre I Le Manuscrit dAmiens. Vol. v: Lexique, ed. George T. Diller, Geneva, Droz, 359 pp., is an invaluable analytical glossary to the whole of the four previous volumes of this important critical edition. Diller is also the author of4 "Pour la cause de ce que j'estoie fran ois". Langue(s) et loyaut (s) dans les Chroniques de Froissart', MA, 104:461-71, which argues that F. uses his text as a 'd fense et illustration' of the superiority of the French language. M. Zink, 'La fin des Chroniques de Froissart et le tragique de la cour', Papers (ICLS 8), 79-95, reads the ending as F.'s attempt to impose a tragic symmetry on historical events by equating the fates of Edward II and Richard II of England, thus stressing the instability of the fortunes of kings. C. Blons-Pierre, 'L'expression de la rapidit dans les Grandes Chroniques de France', Menard Vol., 161-72, is a stylistic analysis which compares the distribution of verbs and adverbs expressing speed and movement across the first four volumes of this chronicle. Brigitte Roux, Les Dialogues de Salmon et Charles VI: Images du pouvoir et enjeux politiques (Cahiers d'Humanisme et Renaissance, 52), Geneva, Droz, 174 pp., ^ a handsomely produced study of the two MSS. containing different versions of Pierre Salmon's early i5th-c. political treatise on kingship and government. It examines the intricate relationship between text and illumination in these versions for the way in which S. encodes his pro-Burgundian message and subtly undermines the authority of the ailing king, Charles VI. F. Duval, 'S bastien Mamerot', Romania, 116:461-91, offers a new perspective on the life and works of this little-known mid-i5th-c.</page><page sequence="11">Late Medieval Literature 79 compiler and translator, with a useful appendix of extracts from historical documents which mention the author as well as short passages from his four major texts.

Nabert, 'La m re dans la litt rature politique la fin du Moyen Age (XIVe-XVe si cles)', BDBA, 16:191-202, argues that such texts are informed by both the idealized maternal images of didactic literature and the contemporary polemic surrounding the legitimacy of succession. A. Strubel, 'Gaston Ph bus et l'intelligence des b tes', Menard Vol., 1281-95, relates his anthropomorphic typology of animals according to their capacity for reasoning or ruse to literary and mythological tradition as well as to G.'s own personal experience of hunting; whilst J.-C. Faucon, 'La repr sentation de l'animal par Marco Polo', M di vales, 32, 1997:97-117, argues that M.'s descriptions of animals emphasize realism over exoticism and symbolism. J. Dufournet, ' "Environ ce temps je vins au service du roi" (Philippe de Gommynes, livre ni, ch. xi', CRISIMA 3, 469-80, shows how C. justifies his shift of allegiance from Charles le T m raire to Louis XI in August 1472 by claiming disloyalty to be endemic in contemporary society; whilst J. Blanchard, 'Commynes le diplomate: "arch ologie" d'une formation intel lectuelle', M nard Vol., 147-59, argues that the M moires break with the traditional symbolic and hieratic representation of monarchy, and privilege instead the viewpoint on affairs of state of professional diplomats like C. himself. M. Slattery, 'King Louis XI - chivalry's villain or anti-hero: the contrasting historiography of Chastellain and Commynes', FCS, 23, 1996[i997] : 49-73, shows how the former attacks the king for undermining chivalric values by retreating from battle whereas the latter praises Louis's successful use of diplomacy in order to avoid combat. G. Small, 'Qui a lu la chronique de George Chastelain?', Burgundica, 1:115-26, analyses the reception of this text amongst its contemporary audience and accounts for its appeal amongst both the Burgundian nobility interested in their ancestral heritage and the incoming Hapsburg rulers curious about the past history of their newly acquired territories. E. Gaucher, 'Joinville conteur: les anecdotes dans la Vie de saint Louis', IL, 49, 1997:10-16, argues that J. 's use of seemingly digressive anecdotes serves both to underline the prestige of his saindy protagonist as well as himself as authentic, eye-witness narrator, and to lighten an otherwise dry didactic work with more entertaining passages evoking the exoticism of the Holy Land; whereas in 'Du bon usage de la trahison, dans l'historiographie des XlVe et XVe si cles', CRISIMA 3, 499-507, Gaucher reveals how the authors of the Chanson de Bertrand du Guesclin and the Livre des faits du mar chal Boucicaut replace the feudal notion of honour and loyalty with a more pragmatic and ambivalent concep tion of betrayal. D. Lalande, 'Nicolas de Gonesse est-il l'auteur du</page><page sequence="12">8o French Studies "Livre des fais du Mareschal Bouciquaut"?', Menard Vol., 827-38, rejects this attribution on the grounds that the style of this work differs substantially from that of C's translations of Plutarch and Valerius Maximus; whilst A. J. Kennedy, 'Christine de Pizan's Lime du corps de policie: some problems in the identification and analysis of her sources', ib., 733-44, laments the lack of good critical editions of Middle French sources such as this translation of Valerius Maximus which was used by C. and others in their political and historical works. Kennedy is also responsible for an excellent new critical edition of C's Livre du Corps de policie, Champion, xiii 4- 231 pp. Based on Chantilly 294, an autograph manuscript, accompanied by a full scholarly apparatus including a particularly useful glossary, it replaces Lucas's rather unsatisfactory edition of 1967 which was transcribed from a version of the text produced long after C's own lifetime. R. Brown-Grant, "Hee! Quel honneur au femenin sexe!": female heroism in Christine de Pizan's Diti de Jehanne d'Arc', JIRS, 5, 1997:123-33, argues that, far from proposing Joan as a feminist exemplum, C. presents her as a salvific heroine atypical of ordinary womanhood in order to increase her propagandistic value as a force behind whom the French nation should unite against the English; whilst J.-F. Kosta-Th faine, 'Entre po sie et proph tie: les sources du Diti de Jehanne d'Arc de Christine de Pizan', RJ LG, 22:41-56, surveys the biblical and medieval elements which enhance this text's status as a prophetic discourse. 5. RELIGIOUS, MORAL AND DIDACTIC LITERATURE Fauvel Studies: Allegory, Chronicle, Music, and Image in Paris, Biblioth que Nationale de France, MS fian ais 146, ed. Margaret Bent and Andrew Wathey, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1997, xix + 666 pp., is a monu mental interdisciplinary collection of 27 essays on this multi-faceted but litde-studied satire and comes complete with an index of MSS and musical compositions. J. E. Merceron, 'Obscenity and hagio graphy in three anonymous Sermons Joyeux and in Jean Molinet's Saint Billouart, Ziolkowski, Obscenity, 332-44, argues that, whilst the anonymous works conform to the bawdy tradition in simply coupling the language of sex and religion in order to mock the Church's sexual and moral values, M.'s text experiments with the semiotic and semantic elements of the Christian, bawdy and courtiy traditions in its obscene allegory of a 'vit' and a 'cul' pursuing a 'con'. A.-M. Legar , 'All gorie et gestualit dans un manuscrit du P lerinage de vie humaine en prose', Bertrand, Geste, 341-67, examines the illumination cycle accompanying this text preserved in Biblioth que publique et universitaire de Gen ve, MS fr. 182, for the influence of Quintilian's</page><page sequence="13">Late Medieval Literature 81 InstitutT oratoria on its representation of both hand gestures and body language in general. W. Pfeffer, 'The Dit des monstiers', Speculum, 73:80-114, offers a critical edition and English translation of this I4th-c. work, with a commentary on its linguistic, textual, and historical significance, and a useful glossary of the churches which it mentions. M. L onard, 'Le Dit de la Honnine', Menard Vol., 879-95, is an edition of this previously unpublished tale which compares the destruction wreaked by a caterpillar on a garden with the corruption brought about by a low-born woman of her noble husband and his court. L onard is also the author of Le edit' et sa technique litt raire des origines 1340 (Nouvelle Biblioth que du Moyen Age, 38), Champion, 1996, 455 pp., an important reassessment of this polymorphous genre - accompanied by an appendix listing all 684 works making up the cdit' corpus - which examines its key internal characteristics and relationships to other genres, and concludes that it represents a major step in the move towards the more personalized poetry of the later middle ages. F. Clier-Colombani, 'Le coup de foudre dans UOvide moralis ou la faillite de l'amour', BDBA, 15, 1997:179-211, shows how the interaction between text and image in the Rouen MS provides a moral lesson against the perils of love by representing the amorous encounters between gods and mortals as brutal and non consensual; whereas in 'La m re dans Y Ovide moralis ', ib., 16:71-108, she argues that the text's moralizations reduce the different models of maternity illustrated by pagan queens and goddesses to a single type of motherhood, one which is exemplified by the Virgin Mary as submission to God's creative power. Renate Blumenfeld-Kosinski, Reading Myth: Classical Mythology and Its Interpretation in Medieval French Literature (Figurae: Reading Medieval Culture), Stanford U.P., 1997, 314 pp. discusses how various texts from the mid-12th c. to 1430 rework classical myths according to their particular political, poetic, and didactic agendas, with chapters devoted to Anglo-Norman romances of antiquity, the Roman de la Rose, the Ovide moralis , Machaut and Froissart, and Christine de Pizan. G. Souillac, 'Charisme et proph tisme f minins: Marguerite Porete et le Miroir des simples mes', AJFS, 35:261-78, examines how M. presents herself as a female prophet in order to legitimate her claim to attain divine knowledge unmediated by the hierarchy of the Church; whilst M. G. Sargent, 'The annihilation of Marguerite Porete', Viator, 28, 1997:253-79, sees the heterodoxy implicit in M.'s attempt to reformulate ideas about male and female subjectivity as the main factor which led to her persecution. G. Ouy, 'Trois pri res in dites de Gerson', Demarolle Vol., 27-38, is a transcription of Paris BNF MS fr. 25552, fols 75-80, which contain both a particular and a general prayer to St John the Evangelist (Jean Gerson's patron saint) as well as one addressed to St</page><page sequence="14">82 French Studies Agnes. L. J. Walters, 'The Tournai Rose as a secular and a sacred epithalamium5, Papers (ICLS 8), 251-66, argues that by incorporating references to the Song of Songs and elements of Franciscan spirituality into its illumination cycle, this MS of Gui de Mori's reworking of the Rose functions as both a commemoration of the wedding of a real-life couple and a celebration of the soul's pursuit of divine love. E. Martin, Away from self-authorship: multiplying the "author" in Jean de Meun's Roman de la Rose', MP, 96:1-15, reveals how, in the midpoint and apologia passages, J. layers multiple subjectivities in order to disavow any authorial responsibility; whilst A. Planche, 4 "Ne valoir une pomme, une bille, une cive ..." L'expression concr te de la valeur nulle dans Le Roman de la Rose. (Partie Jean de Meun)', Demarolle Vol., 118-32, examines the place of the Rose in the development of negative comparisons due to its extensive use of disparaging images taken from the domains of food, amusements, and dress. T. Van Hemelryck, O sont les "Neuf Preux"? Variations sur un th me m di val', SFr, 42:1-8, argues for the influence of the Ubi sunt?topos on the tradition of the Neuf Preux, with particular reference to George Chastellain's use of these two themes in his Miroir de Mort. C. Segre, 'Due nuove attestazioni di "Les Douze moys figurez" ', Menard Vol., 1235-46, transcribes a version of this text contained in Tommaso III di Saluzzo's Chevalier errant (Paris BNF MS fr. 12559) using Torino Biblioteca Nazionale L.V.6 for variants. M. Colombo-Timelli, 'Le Purgatoire des mauvais maris. Introduction et dition', Romania, 116:492-523, is a critical edition of a late I5th-c. Burgundian work based on the Colard Mansion incunable (Paris BNF R s.p.Y2.244), with a discussion of the text's place in the Querelle des Femmes. R. Deschaux, 'Sourires et joies dans le Champion des Dames de Martin le Franc', Menard Vol., 407-16, comments on M.'s use of comic anecdotes and puns as part of his pro-women contribution to the Querelle and his substitution of a conception of love based on Faith, Hope, and Charity for that governed by Venus and physical passion. D. Ruhe, '"Pour raconte ou pour dottrine". Uexemplum et ses limites', pp. 331-51 of Les Exempla m di vaux: nouvelles perspectives, ed. Jacques Berlioz and Marie-Anne Polo de Beaulieu, Champion, 464 pp., compares the use made of exempla by the Chevalier de La Tour Landry and the Menagier de Paris in their respective courtesy books for women and concludes that the latter emphasizes more the aesthetic and entertaining aspects of his examples than their strict didactic import; whilst A.-M. De Gendt, '"Plusieurs mani res d'amour": le d bat dans Le Livre du Chevalier de la Tour Landry et ses chos dans l'ouvre de Christine de Pizan', FCS, 23 I996[i997]: 121-37, examines the attack on fin'amor voiced by the</page><page sequence="15">Late Medieval Literature 83 Chevalier's wife and suggests its possible influence on the representa tion of Sibylle Monthault de la Tour in C's works. Alcuin Blamires, The Case for Women in Medieval Culture, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1997, 279 PP-5 ls a pioneering study of the philosophical and theological tradition of pro-feminine arguments which established writers such as C. were able to draw upon in their defence of women against misogynist opinion. L. C. Reis, 'Le prologue au Livre des Trois Vertus de C.', RoN, 39:47-52, analyses how the opening passages of this work link back thematically to her earlier Cit des dames. Christine de Pizan, The Book of the City of Ladies, trans. Earl Jeffrey Richards, NY, Persea Books, rev. edn., lxv + 281 pp., is an updated version of this important translation of the Cit des dames which first appeared in 1982, and features a new foreword by Nathalie Zemon Davies as well as a new introduction on recent developments in C. scholarship. M. Jeay, 'C.: chroniques de la trahison', CRISIMA j, 453-65, examines how she explores the issue of women's betrayal in love and fatal loss of reputation in society across a range of lyrical, didactic, and political texts. J. A. Wisman, 'C. and Ameline's Metamorphoses', FCS, 23, I996[i997]: 138-51, shows how her representation of Arachne as a highly skilled artist challenges Ameline's image as vain and untalented in the male exegetical tradition. A. Suranyi, A fifteenth-century woman's pathway to fame: the Querelle de la Rose and the literary career of C.', ib., 204-21, is a survey of her defence of women texts up to, during, and after the Querelle which is heavily reliant on previous scholarship. J.-P. Beaulieu, 'UAvision Christine ou la tentation autobiographique', Litt ratures, 18:15-30, sees this text as proto-modern in its exploration of self-representation within the impersonal framework of the allegorical dream-vision and its breaking down of the distinction between the public and private spheres. L. Dulac, A propos des repr sentations du corps souffrant chez C.', Demarolle Vol., 313-24, demonstrates how, across a variety of works, she uses the image of the suffering human body as part of her political and moral analyses of the ills of her contemporary society; whilst in 'Litt rature et d votion: A propos des Heures de contemplaci n sur la Passion de Nostre Seigneur de C.', Menard Vol., 475-84, Dulac offers a preliminary study of literary techniques in one of C's most neglected religious works. J.-L. Picherit, 'La fournaise dans la litt rature du Moyen Age', RLaR, 102:167-77, discusses how C., Gerson, and Deschamps use the image of the oven from the Book of Daniel as a symbol of moral purification or as a metaphor for hell. Two important general collections of essays have also appeared in this bumper year for tudes christiniennes, the first of which is Christine de Pizan and the Categories of Difference, ed. Marilynn Desmond, Minneap olis-London, Minnesota U.P., xix + 287 pp. In this volume, which</page><page sequence="16">84 French Studies groups papers based on a conference held at Binghampton University in October 1995 and reflects some of the main strands in current American scholarship, C. Cannon Willard offers an overview of C's political treatises (3-15); R. Krueger examines C's critique of the process of teaching and her anxiety about the failure of moral instruction to reform the social order (16-40); D. Wolfthal analyses how she reinterprets the traditional rape scenario of women as victims of sexual violence by representing them as forceful avengers against their assailants in the Epistre Othea and the Cit des dames (41-70); M. A. C. Case compares C. with modern critical race theorists in order to show how she legitimates her experiences to give authority to her otherwise marginalized voice in the Querelle des Femmes (71-87); T. Fenster re-assesses the importance of C's choice of French over Latin for the development and prestige of the vernacular as a didactic medium in the later Middle Ages (91-107); B. M. Semple argues that, in the Avision Christine, she condemns the pursuit of knowledge which leads to intellectual arrogance and instead advocates pursuit of the spiritual life undertaken in humility and acknowledgement of one's ignorance (108-27); M. Weitzel Gibbons shows that the miniature of the Bath of the Muses episode in the version of the Chemin de long estude contained in Harley 4431, fol. 183, functions as a multi-layered image of female intellectual authority (128-45); M. H. Green contends that C probably excluded the figure of the Salernitan doctor Trotula from her Cit des dames because of the latter's association with the misogynist medical tradition of revealing the 'secrets of women' (146-78); J. L. Kellogg examines how, in the Epistre Othea and the Mutaci n de Fortune, C. takes issue with the misogynist aspects of Ovid by reinterpreting his myth of Ceyx and Alcyone in order to produce a more authoritative discursive voice for herself and other women in society (181-94); D. McGrady maintains that by reconceptualizing the poet-patron relationship in the Harley 4431 MS of her collected works, C. transforms the patron's traditional power over literary creation into a valorization of the writer's position as author and no longer simply as court entertainer (195-214); C. J. Brown demonstrates the varied reception of C's works in the late 15th and early 16th c. in France and England whereby French printers of her texts highlight her gender in order to attract a largely female readership whereas English printers play down or even efface her identity as woman author in their attempts to please a more male audience (215-35); and M.-A. Bossy argues that the copy of her Fais d'armes et de chevalerie contained in British Library MS Royal 15.E.VI which was presented to Margaret of Anjou by John Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, on the occasion of her marriage to Henry VI of England was designed to enhance the prestige of the giver as a soldier and</page><page sequence="17">Late Medieval Literature 85 connoisseur of French culture at the expense of both C's status as author and Margaret's importance as receiver of the gift (236-56). The second of these volumes, also based on conference proceedings but representing more the European dimension of G. scholarship, is Sur le chemin de longue tude . . . Actes du colloque d'Orl ans Juillet 1995, ed. Bernard Rib mont, Champion, 204 pp. In this collection, S. G. Bell analyses the reception of the City of Ladies in a series of lost 16th-c. tapestries produced for various Renaissance queens and princesses (7-12); A. Birrell compares the love relationship between husband and wife in C's Trois Vertus with medieval Chinese love poetry (13-24); R. Brown-Grant reads the Epistre Othea as a mirror for princes which, like John Gower's Confessio Amantis, links personal morality with social ethics in all spheres of human activity (25-44); C. Brucker examines the significance of the terms 'hauteur', 'gloire', and 'renomm e' for C's moral and didactic project of encouraging the reader to pursue virtue and attain salvation (45-64); M. Closson offers a rather descriptive overview of the educational possibilities open to women in the French Middle Ages (65-76); L. Dulac accounts for the somewhat disparate structure of the Avision Christine by relating it to key themes explored by C. in earlier texts such as the substitution of Opinion for Fortune and the linking of personal and collective misfortune (77-86); M. Guarinos discusses how, in the Trois Vertus, C. exhorts her female readers to balance their responsibility as moral individuals against solidarity with other members of their sex (87-100); A. J. Kennedy reveals how the Diti de Jehanne d'Arc was read by the literary critic Gustave Cohen during the Occupation as a lesson in moral fortitude and a defence of French cultural values (101-10); J. Laidlaw reassesses C's virelais in the light of her i4th-c. poetic predecessors and her own lyric output with its emphasis on women as victims of passionate love (111-26); G. Ouy and C. M. Reno outline the form that their forthcoming catalogue of C's autograph MSS will take (127-35); A. Slerca situates the Chemin de long estude in the tradition of myth narratives on the creation of the universe and notes C's original use of both irony and the polemical dialogue (135-48); A. Tarnowski reads C's representation of Pallas Athena as a symbol of the author's intellectual aspirations both as a purveyor of wisdom and an instructor in chivalric prowess (149-58); L. J. Walters examines how C. models her transformation into a man in the Mutaci n de Fortune on the gender change involved in the story of St Perpetua whilst transposing the religious inspiration behind the saint's life into a more secular and humanist set of ideals (159-82); and M. Zimmermann discusses the early 20th-c. German reception</page><page sequence="18">86 French Studies of C. which tends to gloss over her provocative status as pro to feminist in favour of a less threatening view of her as wife, mother and patriot (183-204). 6. MISCELLANEOUS J. E. Merceron, 'Cooks, social status, and stereotypes of violence in medieval French literature and society', Romania, 116:170-87, ana lyses a range of mainly 13th-c. texts, such as the Bataille de Caresme et Ch mage and the Merveilles de Rigomer, for their pejorative portrayal of cooks as characters who direct their violence against the religious estate and the military elite, often as the instruments of a third party. M. A. Rouse and R. H. Rouse, 'The goldsmith and the peacocks: Jean de le Mote in the household of Simon de Lille, 1340', Viator, 28, 1997:281-303, examines the relationships between illumination, orf vrerie and poetic composition in the commissioning of the Li parfait du paon and the allegorical Voie d'enfer et de paradis. A. Smets and B. Van den Abele, 'Manuscrits et trait s de chasse fran ais du Moyen Age. Recensement et perspectives de recherche', Romania, 116:316-67, is a detailed inventory of MSS containing hunting treatises with a brief but useful introduction to the authors and works cited.</page></plain_text>
