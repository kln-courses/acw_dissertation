<plain_text><page sequence="1">WYNDHAM LEWIS Monstre Gai (II) The interval between Section I of the narrative, published in the last number of THE HUDSON REVIEW, and the present sec- tion, represents the period of a single morning. Pullman goes out early, and a young man called Sentoryen, an agent of the Bailiff, who has been waiting outside, introduces himself. Almost im- mediately after Pullman's retlurn Mr. Mannock accompanies hium and Satterthwaite to the State-bank, where they are supplied with a month's money. After that the two newcomers, Mr. Mannock acting as guide, visit Tenth Piazza. This is the principal shopping centre of Third City. They are here first in contact with the inhabitants. Then they return to Mr. Mannock's apartmnent, where they have lunch. THAT AFTERNOON PULLMAN OCCUPIED MAJESTICALLY the centre of the settee, and Mannock was in the large armchair he favoured, upon the inland side of the mantelpiece. Returned from the Tenth Piazza, they had lunched lightly, and afterwards Satters had flung himself like a tired dog upon his bed, greatly to their relief. The mantelpiece clock indicated that it was just after two o'clock; both men sat without speaking, but Mannock asked himself who this magnate might be who sat there before him, sought out by the Bailiff and coming from a world in which he had been Somebody, it would seem. That rather lofty something about his guest which he had noticed within ten minutes of their first meeting, and which showed no signs of disappearing, what on earth could it be? Erect and silent, Pullman gently stroked his bearded chin. What this aggressive self-confidence might signify, to this Mannock had given very little thought until now. He had not asked Pullman what had been his profession or his trade. Mannock himself had been in business in the East, mainly in China; but he did not feel that this new acquaintance of his had been a business man. No. Perhaps his calling had been clerical: but there was no clerical collar to indicate such origins, unless he had belonged to one of those sects who dispense with a uni-</page><page sequence="2">WYNDHAM LEWIS form. A surreptitious glance or two, a modification of the central image, and he decided against the beard belonging to a Preacher. That out of the way, he gave himself up to a general analysis. When you began to study him, Pullman had a noticeably im- pecunious look. He had not the clothes of a gentleman. If any reliance was to be placed upon the rig-out in which people make their appearance in the camp, Pullman had not come out of the topdrawer, but of some intermediate one. However shoddy he might be, the man of means would be wearing an expensive suit of clothes, or a pair of shoes made for him. One man, he remem- bered, had turned up at the Camp in a grey topper and formal suit to match, which, though it was rather soiled, he had no doubt been provided with in order to identify him as an Ascot and Royal-Garden-Party guest. No, Pullman's air of authority had nothing in the way of clothes to sustain it. Obviously it was in no way related to Finance. Having reached this point in his analysis, Mannock could get on without the figure of Pullman as a guide. He marshalled in his mind a number of types with a very high opinion of themselves, but for no visible reason. Well, there was always the Actor. Quite an unsuccessful Actor would still have an inflated sense of his personal prestige. The fellow would come prancing along towards you, his head in the clouds. His wardrobe might in no way bear out his swagger. Without a bob's worth of coppers to rattle about in his pocket, this fellow was the Prince of Denmark. Mannock smiled; but his expression quickly changed. The Beard! -whoever saw an Actor with a beard? The Actor was a clean- shaven man, and there was no way of fitting his guest to the place reserved for men of that calling. Then Mannock thought of the Schoolmaster. Yes, that was a possibility. The Schoolmaster often displayed a quite bloated self- esteem; and he might quite well wear a not very graceful or im- pressive beard. Yes. The more Mannock considered it, the more he thought that he might be in the presence of a Schoolmaster; imposingly familiar with the differential calculus, or terribly good at Greek, but not very affluent. Not a Public-School master, this fellow had not been teaching gentlemen! But there was some- thing quite obvious which Mannock had ignored-something eminently genteel in its associations which he had passed over. 29</page><page sequence="3">THE HUDSON REVIEW It now rose accusingly in his memory. It was quite simply the Fag, evidently of first importance, which had been left out-that English institution of which Satterthwaite was the by no means self-effacing representative. How could he have overlooked the fag? But the Wykehamist cast a dubious mind's eye towards the rugger cap worn by Satters. He knew that there were many schools called Public, but . . . and there was a fag wherever a Prefect whirled a cane. He would be prepared to find a fag in any institution that was Public enough to boast a "House". But whoever saw a bearded Prefect? What had happened to Pullman after the fag-owning decade? There were Other Places, he was vaguely aware, outside of those two fairylands with which Youth ends, the one watered by the Isis, bulging with learning from Jesus to All Souls; the second built upon the Cam, captured by Science, though civilising what has mastered it: but Mannock's vague awareness had no desire for greater precision. Had he made the effort, in the interest of locating his guest's pigeonhole, he might have found a Place not unknown to learning, where a Chair had once been illustriously occupied by his guest, not at all a bad niche for a rather unusual Gelehrter, within earshot of the Halle Orchestra (to give a hint of where this might be). This would not have caused the Schoolmaster Theory to be quite inap- plicable; that had really rather appealed to Mannock. He had amusedly been turning this over in his mind when with an alarm- ing suddenness, Pullman started to speak: "On what principle," he enquired, "are people selected for citizenship in the Camp outside the City?" "Oh, I don't know." Mannock was annoyed at his subject speaking, as an artist would be if a cow he had been drawing got up and walked away. "You yourself have been a witness of how they are selected, have you not? The Bailiff is a strange function- ary. He pretends . .." With the utmost suddenness the room became as dark as night. Mannock sprang up. "Does this often happen?" Pullman, who had not moved from his position in the centre of the settee, enquired. The voice was irritatingly steady. "Never in my experience." Mannock sounded peevish. A blast, rather than a flash, of lightning, a hundred times brighter and colder than any day, stamped out everything in 30</page><page sequence="4">WYNDHAM LEWIS blinding black and white upon the human retina. Pullman looked clearer and calmer than ever to the exasperated eye of his host. Pullman, too, had the sensation of being unspeakably distinct, but his calmness was, of course, more apparent than real. The switch-off, back to primeval night, was very violent; abruptly the vivid day ticked out. In the absence of all light, the eyes ached. "David Hume observed that because the sun had never failed to rise every morning since the beginning of the world, that is not to say that it will do so tomorrow morning." These unhurried vocables seemed to be uttered in defiance of the blackness, and they had the same effect upon Mannock as if Pullman had personally stage-managed the turning off of the light. If his thoughts could have acquired a voice it would have been as a growl that they would have been heard. "What does the fellow think he is doing! Obviously a Schoolmaster!" One stood, the other sat, as if posing for their portraits. Neither liked the quality of the blackness. Pullman felt he could not furnish it with his thoughts, it was impenetrable and alien. Man- nock did not recognise it, he was speechless with terror. But as if the blackness had spoken there was an enormous shock; the house they were in rocked backwards, and then with equal violence it seemed to right itself. This second movement tossed Mannock down on the floor, in front of the mantelpiece. The house then seemed to shake itself, and several of the window panes crashed, and there was a crashing and banging outside. The door was dashed open, and Satters appeared, flung himself up against Pullman on the settee, his voice blowing into the latter's face, in a breathless scream, "Pulley, wha... wha... wha... wha... what!" Pullman, erect as he still was, was in no position to tell Satters what. He had no idea himself. Technically, he suffered from shock, as he would if he had been in a car and it had come into collision with a milk-float. His rigidity was a necessary adaption. Only tensed could he meet the appallingly unexpected. He began by holding protectively Satters' bloated head, and himself derived a certain comfort from these contacts. In the end his fingers got wound round his fag's strong curls. As events developed, he found that he was pulling at a massive lock. In moments of especial stress he nearly pulled out by the roots sec- tions of his young follower's thatch. His hand left the hair, it fastened itself on the nose snorting upon the settee at his side. 31</page><page sequence="5">THE HUDSON REVIEW He noticed his lips framing an apology; his hand released the nose, and Satters, apparently believing, in his shadowy consciousness, that something nightmarish had had hold of his nose, sneezed aggressively. There were no more shocks; the next development was a world- embracing hiss. The City and everything in it became a Hiss. If a man is standing on a railway station platform near a locomotive, it is apt to emit a deafening hiss, which causes him to hurry away. Magnified a million times, such a hiss as this resulted-with Pull- man's fingers sticking in his ears until later they fell down against his sides when his consciousness left him. But actually the hiss was the last thing he heard. While he sat there, his senses full of a prodigious Hiss, other sounds filled the air. Corked as his ears were, his hearing mechanism, such of it as was not obsessed by the hiss, dimly attempted to record the chaos; but the next blast was final, and it gave up all attempt to hear. Something like a Star must have been hurled at the metropolis. Or it was stunned by a rushing world. Or it was smothered by a hostile universe. If anything lived in Third City it lived as a congealed and armoured mechanism as Pullman did, his arms dropped like lead on either side of his body. -Ie sat there bolt upright, but was not a valid witness of the hereafter. Beneath him Mannock lay trembling on the floor, but it was an automatic rattle of his flesh, not one at which his consciousness assisted. He adhered to the floor like a piece of paper, a gasp stifled and stuck, his mouth as round as a pennypiece. Satters' head adhered to Pullman's body at about the level of the hip, like an unsightly wen of doughy texture. He was quite motion- less. It was a stricken group. During everything that happened subsequent to this, a storm of such force was present, violently rushing into every crevice, that there was not a scrap of glass left in the window-frames, and the pictures, which were hurled to the floor, also lost their glaz- ing. The appearance of the room was entirely changed by the destructive blast, the lighter chairs and cabinets were driven into the corners of the room, the carpet rose into the air, and stopped there, except that it rested upon, here a chair, there the projecting corner of the settee. Later on Pullman discovered that he had been blown over on top of Sa.tters, whereas Mannock's hair was almost blown out of his head, and in the end was stretched out 32</page><page sequence="6">WYNDHAM LEWIS to its utmost limit; a fragment of glass was embedded in his neck. Upon this violent wind missiles of different sizes tore their way into the City; a stone, the size of a Sphinx, plunged into the tower of the Central Bank, other large stones visited the citizenry, and splintered glass, like that which had found its way into Mannock's neck, flew everywhere in and out of the houses: the wind was also responsible for transmitting a blistering heat. At times those of the inhabitants who had been practically mummified, as had the group in Habakkuk, were very fortunate, for those few who had not been rendered unconscious reported that they had been grilled alive. They said that they might have been in front of an open furnace, and they expected at every moment to be shrivelled up. The background to the superhuman uproar, which started with flashes of lightning which were like blows from hard blades of light, the background to this was an orchestral tutti as of mass instruments, each straining its utmost to make more noise than had ever been made before. To supply the simile with an overseer, one might elect as chef d'orchestre Satan in person. A dark cloud had stood over Piazza One; it emptied itself in the form of a spout of malodorous liquid which came down in the center of the Piazza and inundated neighbouring streets. Every- one had closed their windows, and held handkerchiefs to their noses. A doctor said that if a second cloud behaved in that way, there would be a diphtheria epidemic. This was happening in the poorer quarters of the City about the time Habakkuk was ex- periencing the first shocks. The rain of Flies occurred later. The Flies were quite dead when they reached the City, and carpeted everything with a uni- form blue-black. With a sound like the cymballing of thin sheets of metal, locusts followed, in lesser mass, the rain of Flies. Pull- man by that time had been blown across Satters' body, and hardly a person in Third City was less of an automaton than he. But the Waterspout, or the Deluge of Flies, was incidental. Mankind practically asphyxiated, what could only be a "Battle" took shape, at once anthropomorphic and supernatural. Its major features were the percussion of great voices, words used as missiles the size of houses, and then what the human soldier's ear would have recognised as the sounds of warfare in the Twentieth Cen- 33</page><page sequence="7">THE HUDSON REVIEW tury sense, so magnified as to be aurally unmanageable. The ap- parent slamming of monstrous doors would correspond, for those attuned to terrestrial battle, to the detonation of shells and bombs. But the doors which seemed to be slamming must have been shutting out areas as large as the City itself. Taking the sounds literally, beside the hollow roar of doors a thousand feet high, were nests of machine-guns, giving a monster rattle, a sky- scraping honeycomb with muzzles for windows. A human lis- tener, in registering such immensities, could not possibly have admitted them to his slender auditory apparatus; he would have somehow translated the gigantic sounds into a scale more adapted to his sensual possibilities. What would not be familiar to the human soldier would be the three or four mammoth voices on high, crashing out the alphabets of Heaven and of the Pit. The nasal tongues of giant viragoes at one time conducted a screaming argument among the clouds, which, if translated, was totally absurd. This terrific contest degenerated into something like a zoological madness. The giant sounds shrank to a hubbub of monkeys, and a psittacine screaming. As abruptly as it had begun this chaotic orgasm ended-like a vast squib it hissed and spluttered, it chattered and squawked to an end, an end at which no one was present, as no one had been fully present at the never- ending encounter. What succeeded it was a silence equally monstrous. It was in a universal silence that Pullman grew conscious of his surroundings, far more oppressive than any sounds he had ever heard. In every sense his awakening was abnormal. He did not, for instance, become aware of the conditions in which he and the others breathed and had their beings: that was a later and philo- sophic realisation. What first came was a feeling of a rigid body, as if frozen into an unnatural erectness. It was, as it were, a negative awareness: a cataloguing of things which were not. First of all, he could not move. Then he became aware of all the other things which he could not do. And as to the world outside himself, that mainly, to start with, was a list of negations. Every- thing was upside down-this was not here, or that was not there. When he began to recover his faculties, the first sensation was one of such violence that he thought not that he was coming to life, but that he was dying. Nausea weighed him down with a 34</page><page sequence="8">WYNDHAM LEWIS leaden loathing. But that was secondary: his angry liver de- manded how its functioning came to be shut down; the urinary system struggled to force two or three pints of liquid, or near- liquid, through the kidneys; most painful of all was the spine. What could it be? Were the meninges involved? If only ice could have been administered. He remembered the treatment he had read about in the case of some spinal ailment. Ice appeared to be essential. He wondered if Mannock possessed a refrigerator, but, even if he had, Pullman realised he was unable to move, so could not have procured any ice from that source. The reactions were so acute at this point that he fainted. When he came to, the spinal column was easier, but in the urinary region the pains were so severe that he again succumbed. When he regained conscious- ness for the third time the pains had diminished, he just felt sick and completely exhausted: perfectly still, his eyes shut and his hands pushed beneath his body to secure a little heat, he fell into a profound sleep. When he awakened, the organic disturbances appeared to have subsided. Absolute stillness obtained as before, not a sound was to be heard anywhere; no one seemed to be left alive in the City. To an analytical mind such as Pullman's one of the first things to occur was the question of the time. But before the bodily ordeal began there had literally been no interval allowing for such speculations. Now he fixed his eyes upon the mantelpiece clock. He had stared at it for a very long time, when with difficulty he realised it had stopped. His next reflection was that either (a) the day was drawing in or (b) that henceforth there was going to be less light in the world. It had all been used up! he reflected stupidly. However, what could not be called an increasing suppleness, but was certainly a consciousness of a development all over his body of a potential pliability, began to be felt. To look directly at his wrist-watch was of course impossible. Revolving his left arm was painful enough, there was no question of lifting it up. But he found that he was able gently to withdraw his left elbow a couple of inches. Then the wrist-watch was visible. His extravagance had been justified; quietly it ticked on. It was al- most five minutes to eight. He then set about very roughly computing the time occupied by the superhuman disturbance. His guess was that for either 35</page><page sequence="9">THE HUDSON REVIEW two or three hours abnormal conditions had persisted. He checked this later on with many people, and his final conclusion was that what he had allowed at that time was approximately right. Looking down he was able to see Mannock. His friend was still outstretched upon the floor, before the mantelpiece; his mouth gaped open, his hair stood erect upon his head. He also noticed, for the first time, the piece of glass embedded in the neck. How white he was! He stared at the colourless mask. The ques- tion as to whether Mannock was alive or dead must be left in abeyance until, as he put it, he himself "came unstuck". Soon it would be too dark to see: was that delirium to be re- peated when the night came? He shuddered. Would they all be annihilated before they had quite regained their physical com- petence? Would he die-really be dead this time: and Michael, Sentoryen and a million other "Youths", would they all be wiped out too? He was terrified as he thought of this, yet his fatalism did not desert him. He even allowed his mind to rest upon Michael, that mad giant in his furred overcoat, with his fantastic philosophy. Would he die, or would the Youth God lift him from his bed and carry him into the Elysian Fields? Someone surely would watch over this grand hallucine. But a cold wind began blowing through the apartment. What was this? Pullman, alone in this blasted city? . . . everyone else like these two people dead ... alone, with that terrible noise, with this frantic wind? To be alone in such a storm of hatred, a supernatural rage! His existence was ridiculous-why should he be preserved, in order to be the witness of this horror?-to lie here trembling and gasping, and in the end to be extinguished? He could only guess what was happening in other parts of the city. But he felt-and since there were no sounds outside it was perfectly possible-that he was the only man alive. He could not resist the sensation of an unexampled loneliness. Had he heard, all of a sudden, a step outside in the hall, it would not have occurred to him that it was a man's. His heart would freeze as he wondered what kind of creature this could be. This idea terrified him so much that he revolved his head a little and fastened his eye intently upon the handle of the door. But there was no movement and at last he forgot about it. The wind increased to a gale, and became colder than he had 36</page><page sequence="10">WYNDHAM LEWIS ever expected it to be in this city. Had the city not only become derelict, all its inhabitants destroyed, but was it now to be de- livered up to the colds of interstellar space? Would those fearful stars, in future, blaze down upon something as cold as themselves? His body grew colder and colder. He began to recover the use of his limbs; the necessity to secure something to cover himself up in, appeared to stimulate him to movement. First he found he could, very slowly and painfully, move his legs, and move his feet up and down. Next came the arms, al- ready limited movement was possible. But section by section he must learn to move his limbs in all directions. The darkness in- creased: soon the full night would be there. There were of course no lights in the streets, but there were also no stars. In about half an hour he was able to move freely his arms and legs; sit up for a moment and then subside again. The body was as yet rigid. It was at this point that the door opened. He sat absolutely without movement, breathing as lightly as possible. He was still facing the fireplace, and the door was behind him. Stiff and motionless, he held his breath, pretending that, like the others, he was dead. A stealthy step crossed the room, then the approaching foot struck something in the dark. If this was a man, it was a very silent one. Perhaps looters were at large: most of the city was dead, and looters were taking ad- vantage of this fact. Then there were a few diminutive sounds, a sigh, a sharp scratching-a match was being struck. There, in the brilliant matchlight, was the scared face of Platon. Pullman had never before had occasion to feel so ashamed of himself: he suddenly croaked out a laugh, Platon jumping and the match going out. Another match was produced, and once more they could see one another. "You are alive," Platon's voice was low and husky. "Good. I thought I was the only live one-in all the city." "I thought that too," Pullman said truthfully. Platon burst into a feeble guffaw, and the other joined him in a doleful gasp of mirth. Pullman sat up, in a rickety and unsteady fashion. Next he rolled over on his side and, after a number of unsuccessful at- tempts, managed to stand up. This had occupied four or five minutes; and when he looked down, Platon was kneeling at the 37</page><page sequence="11">THE HUDSON REVIEW side of his master. He had opened Mannock's shirt at the neck, and put his head sideways upon his chest. He was listening for the sound of the heart. Pullman could see where he was, but not what he was doing. "His heart beats," said Platon. "Good." Pullman was now doing loosening-up exercises on the sofa. He found it warmed him, too. "Capital!" he said with an attempt at a firmer voice, sitting up and slapping his arms across his chest. Then he said, "We are all alive." "All," echoed Platon. He slapped his hand upon Satters' chest. "He alive?" he asked indifferently. "Yes," Pullman said, proceeding with his exercises. Platon sat down beside the unmoving Mannock. "Hot drink!" thinly blustered Pullman. "No gas," was Platon's answer to that. Pullman, supporting himself with pieces of furniture, reached the electric light switch. "No electricity," echoed Platon. Pullman opened the door, and, the palms of his hands pressed against the wall, reached a hat-rack. Two overcoats hung there: these he unhooked, and shuffled back with them into the living- room. One of them he handed to Platon. "Put this over Mr. Mannock," he said. The other he threw around his own shoulders. Then he sat down. He must learn to speak again, he told himself. Immediately he began to put words to work, organising things with the house-boy-who, though he was called a boy, must have been around twenty-five. The first step was to get a match struck and to look at his watch. Miraculously it still functioned, and the time, it alleged, was a few minutes past eleven. He showed it to Platon, who philosophically commented "Good! Good!" He felt, no doubt, that eleven was good because it might have been worse. It was best, Pullman laid it down, that Mannock, and likewise his ex-fag, should be left alone, until such time as the gas came on again, and hot drinks could be obtained. Was it possible, he asked the boy, to block up the windows to enable them to sleep? He felt as they were doing this, and reconstructing their life again, item by item, that at any moment they might be over- whelmed like the inhabitants of Herculaneum-or even much 38</page><page sequence="12">WYNDHAM LEWIS more suddenly than that. However-an encouraging sign-the wind abated somewhat. Questions regarding the future presented themselves first. "The shops will have no food tomorrow-indeed, there may be no adequate supplies for some time. Has Mr. Mannock laid in any reserves? If you have stores, how long would they last?" Sounds in the streets reached them. They both tumbled to- wards the windows, Pullman falling and again rising to his feet. Two loudspeakers were in neighbouring streets, but what was being broadcast it was impossible to say. But a small motor-vehicle with a very loud mechanical voice, burst into Habakkuk. It sternly shouted instructions to the citizens: "TO ALL CITIZENS. STOP INDOORS UNTIL THE CITY SERVICES HAVE REMOVED THE FLIES FROM THE STREETS. THEY WILL NOT BE LONG, CITIZENS! THE GAS AND ELECTRICITY IS BEING ATTENDED TO. PATIENCE, CHILDREN. PATIENCE. IT WILL NOT BE LONG, NOW!" "Children!" grittily expostulated Platon. "Flies!" was Pullman's response, in something between a bark and a croak. Standing inside the windows they stood on glass splinters, and upon some blue-black substance. This had blown in when, as a dark hail, the Flies fell in the city, carpeting it with their blue- black bodies, which had been asphyxiated a thousand feet above the battlements. Then Pullman saw that to what was left of the windows the insect blue-black was adhering. Closely packed along that part of the window-frame where the glass fitted into it, and where the wood leaves, as it were, a little shelf, were the flattened bodies of the flies. Distributed among the smaller black-bodied flies were large pallid locusts. It was these that had made a sound like tin. Pullman returned shakily to the settee, and Platon resumed his position on the floor beside his master. As Pullman sat down, a kind of complaining wheeze was heard from Satters: and from now on Satters gave off more and more evidences of returning life. One of these was to give Pullman a heavy kick on the shin. It was about twenty minutes before Satters opened his eyes. They 39</page><page sequence="13">THE HUDSON REVIEW were two big wandering and alarmed baby-eyes; and then speech began: "Wha... wha... wha... what..." "Shut up." "Oh. Per... per... per... I say. Wha... wha... what... Pulley. Pulley." Pullman began to feel extremely sick. He thought all that was more or less over. That of course was not the case. Irritably he grated at his budding responsibility, at his big baby. "How do you feel?" But he did not wait to listen to the explanations of Satters. He went into the kitchen with Platon. "It will be about a couple of hours, I imagine, before the electricity and gas fitfully appear. Let us," Pullman said, "plaster up the windows of Mr. Mannock's bedroom" (for it was still extremely cold). "I suppose nothing is intact, but the curtains may only have been blown down; we could hammer them up. Refix all that, if it is there; on top of that, spare blankets must be tacked. Tin-tacks." A bellow came from the living-room. "As soon as the windows are fixed, I think we should carry Mr. Mannock in there, put him on the bed, and cover him up. It is still disagreeably cold." Pullman now went towards the bellow, which had become an indignant roar. When he had first got to his feet, soon after Platon's arrival, his limbs felt as if they were made of paper. When he began to move about, they seemed to have no reality in the way of weight. "Am I," he wondered, "becoming meta- physical again?" All his physical reactions led to the formulating of such a question. For, upon their entering the City, some supernatural power had endowed Satters and himself with the full metabolism of the human body as known in their life on earth. What had apparently happened during the two terrible hours of inexplicable uproar and attack (and the very atmos- phere may have been withdrawn while that was going on), was that these precarious advantages had been lost, and the gut- equipped mannikins had been degutted. The agonies Pullman had suffered were, he supposed, due to their partial reequipment. But he was far as yet from the normal young man who, with Satters, had first made the acquaintance of Mannock. He was still only a shell, a mere shadow of himself. It was as a shadow that he 40</page><page sequence="14">WYNDHAM LEWIS moved towards the living-room to deal as best he could with another shadow. But he felt a little uneasy about the shadowy quality of Mr. Satterthwaite who, because of his youth, was probably fifty per cent ahead of him in recovery. However, there it was-to his ex-fag he must appear as masterfully organising everything. In a second spasm of anxiety, the question as to whether he would be strong enough to deal with Satters presented itself. He would have to lie down on the job, put up the shutters, throw up the sponge, strike, unless this preposterous baby quieted him- self down. To make his mind work properly, he found, was nearly as difficult as it had been to gain control of his physical self: and he was not sure which it was, his mind or his body, which now seized the handle of the door and flung him inside into the room, looking tremendously tough. He addressed Satters aggressively: "What is all this about? Who told you you could blow off steam like that! Shut up, do you hear! Shut up!" A howl of despair greeted this. Pullman sat down in the centre of the settee, as usual, his body turned towards Satters. "Now, sir. No nonsense. Your Pulley is not himself. Nobody is his dear old self-except you! You are most dreadfully your- self." An explosion of self-pitying sobs was the response to this statement of the position. Pullman moved along the settee to- wards Satters and smacked his face. There was enough force in this blow to shake; it administered a shock, both to the fat body and to the rudimentary psychology. The former fag put his hand up to his cheek, and there came a sound like a deep ooo. The eye above the ooo was full of sullen anger. "I did that to see if you could move your arms. You can. Are your legs equally movable?" He pinched the nearest of the fat legs, a really vicious compression. Satters jumped ostentatiously. "You beastly cad! Pulley, you are a beast to pinch me like that!" Pullman stood up. "Can you stand up?" he demanded. He got a grip on Satters, such a grip as you would get on the front of a footballer, and succeeded in pulling him off the sofa. "Now stand up, you lump of dough! Up! On your feet!" Pullman felt so abominably sick after these exercises, that he 41</page><page sequence="15">THE HUDSON REVIEW moved away in the direction of the door. Satters, collapsed upon the settee, followed him with a big reproachful eye. "Come with me to the lavatory! Do you want to urinate? Come with me. Quick!" He left the room, and hurried to the water-closet. As soon as he reached it he catted: then stood anticipating other spasms- feeling washed-out and empty, but propping himself against the wall, as he gazed down into the pan. Soon there was a heavy blun- dering step; next the doorway behind him was filled with a glaring, bedraggled, but obviously incontinent, schoolboy. "I say, Pulley. . !" Pullman, the colour of a very green apple, backed away from the pan, and roughly changed places with the other. "Go on. You are more important than I am." He left Satters inside, shutting the door. That was the end of it as far as Pullman was concerned. He was good for nothing except a bed, he had literally nearly killed himself over the revival of Satters. But Satters had been brought to life and put upon his feet. He had wound up Satters, he was ticking again. Falteringly he made his way to his bedroom, shook the dead flies off his bed and subsided upon it. It was three hours later that Platon wakened him. Gas was the word he heard. Subduing extreme fatigue, he rose and went to the bathroom. Before he reached the bathroom Platon appeared. The houseboy's face had a different look-it was somehow belli- cose-but, that apart, he was utterly jaded, and to say that he was in need of sleep would have been a criminal understatement. Mannock, he explained, had shifted a good deal, and groaned, but so far he had not opened his eyes. Pullman went to the kitchen with Platon, where some coffee was being made. As they went he said shortly, "Mr. Satter- thwaite?" The houseboy poked a disrespectful finger in the direc- tion of the living-room. Washed and dressed, he went in where Satters was sleeping, upon the settee (a sign of quite extraordinary displeasure on Satters' part to be lying here, preferring the settee to a bed within whispering distance of his master). Pullman gazed down at the snoring fag, but Satters refused to wake up. "Coffee!" shouted Pullman. "Eats! In Mannock's room." He left him there, and went back to do for Mannock what he had for Satters. Satters, however, had no intention of being out of it. Soon he could be heard evacuating the living-room; and next, 42</page><page sequence="16">WYNDHAM LEWIS there he was, sleepily scowling, rubbing his eyes with the back of his hand, and picking his nose. The masterful one stood gazing down upon the sick man. Ignoring Satters, he went out of the room; in a few minutes he returned with Platon at his side, who placed a tray of coffee near the bed. Platon had painted with iodine the incision where he had removed the piece of glass from Mannock's neck; he had also, with great difficulty, forced the hair to lie down. As Pullman watched, the sleeper's shoulder moved convulsively and the face turned upwards on the pillow. Pullman again bent over the oldest and by far the most seriously affected of them. "Mannock, Mannock," he said loudly and em- phatically, squeezing his arm and patting it. Within five or ten minutes Mannock was lying with his arms stretched out on either side, and slowly and painfully speaking. "Hallo. Has that terrible noise stopped? I should like to know.. ." He stopped and strug- gled to piece together several words in an orderly way. "Is he safe ... Padishah?" Pullman told him (without any justification) that the Padishah luckily had been spared. "Stanfield . . . all right?" Pullman had not the least idea who Stanfield was, but he an- swered firmly, with the ring of truth: "Stanfield is in excellent shape." His mind put at rest as to the well-being of the Padishah and of Stanfield, Mannock settled himself, closed his eyes, and went to sleep. It was as if he had asked, a look of morbid anxiety in his eyes, "How is His Majesty the King?"-and having been as- sured that His Majesty had never been better, had sunk into a restful sleep. But Pullman wakened him again and pressed him to drink a cup of coffee. "It tastes like molten lead!" the patient whispered, pushing away the cup. But Pullman insisted that he should go on drinking the molten lead. This ordeal appeared to have made him a little wakeful. Satters, grimacing, was attempt- ing to drink his coffee. Pullman sat down and proceeded to do the same thing. For all of them this was a mysterious and semi-solid liquid. Satters went to the bathroom to vomit, but Pullman seemed almost to be returned to his normal self. His voice was stern. "Is what we have suffered of frequent occurrence here?" he enquired of Mannock. Mannock began shaking his head with such emphasis as he could muster. "No, no, no ... Never before." Pullman gave his beard a stroke, and emitted a deep, a very 43</page><page sequence="17">THE HUDSON REVIEW deep and dubious "Ah!" Then suddenly he asked, "What does this mean, Mannock?" Mannock looked frightened. "I do not know. Really, I do not know." "If you do not know, Mannock, what do you suppose?" Mannock raised his eyebrows a little piteously. "Nothing at all ... absolutely... I am a spectator... like yourself." "I am sorry you do not feel strong enough to give a guess," Pullman observed almost disagreeably. "I should have thought that however rotten you felt, you would have a dim speculation or two about this awful business." The invalid seemed about to cry. But instead, making an effort, he remarked fairly audibly, "One thing is clear enough ... Satan is the culprit... Beyond that, I have no idea as to what was going on." Satters, who had returned, and resumed his seat, lost a few shades more of his robust colour. "Satan," he repeated in an awed whisper. "The Devil," Pulley told him contemptuously. "The Der ... Der ... the Der ..." "Yes. The Devil," Pullman barked, "and you will soon find yourself in Hell, and some gluttonous demon will be cooking you in a pot. He will regard you as a tender morsel." A look of unmitigated terror appeared in Satters' face. "Pul...Pul Pul.. Pul." Pullman looked at him. "Per ... Pulley! Are you serious? Do you really think.. .?" Pullman stood up, went over to Mannock and patted him gently, saying: "Now you must go to sleep again. I am sure we shall all be alive tomorrow, and possibly the next day. The only one I am anxious about is Satters. He is such a great fat tender morsel." Obtaining some extra blankets from Platon, Pullman and Satters went to their beds. A wind sprang up again, but of a normal type, a little blusterous and with some rain. The glassless windows made it necessary for them to put their heads under the bedclothes. In spite of these conditions, Pullman was asleep almost as soon as he had lain his head upon the pillow. The last thing he was conscious of was the sound of chattering teeth from the bed of the terrified Satters. . .. 44</page><page sequence="18">WYNDHAM LEWIS Five days elapse. During that time the principal occurrence is a visit to a select cafe, and an even more select club, by Mr. Mannock and his two temporary guests. On the way. they inspect the body of an enormous flying dragon, shot down during the Blitz on "Black Tuesday". After lunch, Pullman was invited to come down to Fifth Piazza. "About three o'clock," Mannock told him, "there is to be a deputation from Hades. They are sending a little party of diabolical diplomats." "Is this quite usual?" asked Pullman. Mannock sighed. "Most unusual," he protested. "In fact, I should not have said that it was possible for such a deputation to come here at all, certainly not at such short notice. However, there it is. A delegation from the enemy who was responsible for that frightful rumpus four days ago is to meet the home team in a display of open diplomacy. It is, I think, rather a good sign." They travelled by underground, and eventually came to the surface at one end of Fifth Piazza, a very large open space, only smaller than Tenth Piazza. Like the latter it was paved and arcaded. It had the same bare impressiveness: the houses, of not more than three storeys, were coloured a uniform cafe-au-lait. The crowd was dense; half of it knew why it was important to be there, and this was the Catholic half; the other half had not the vaguest idea what this spectacle might mean. The center of the Piazza was roped off, and along the inner side was a continuous line of armed police. Pullman noticed several truck-loads of civil guards stationed near the corner of the Piazza (for the entrance to the underground was happily not far from the area where the meeting was to take place). The excitement of the non-catholic half was not less intense because of their complete lack of interest in what was at stake. As this was the vocal half, where Pullman and Mannock were it seemed a solid thronging of idiots. "What is Hell, Bert?" or "Does the old Devil smoke cigarettes?" Pullman heard one man say to another. "I've been 'ere a hundred years and never saw a devil, have you, Ernest?" The other said: "Are you that old, Arthur?" There was a loud explosion. The crowd received this with a gasp, pressing tightly up against the ropes, with a deeply drawn 45</page><page sequence="19">THE HUDSON REVIEW "Oh!" The infernal contingent advanced with a dancing step along the Piazza to the appointed meeting-place. That was ex- actly in front of where Mannock and Pullman were standing; they edged their way to the front, but had their toes trodden on and found themselves in unsavoury proximity to a stunted rabble, determined to see, and resenting the toffishness of Mannock. Straight in front of them, and not distant more than a couple of dozen paces, was the home team: it was beautifully blond and clean, two lines of uniformed men, carefully chosen from the police for their blue eyes and flaxen hair. One was almost white, he was so fair. Standing in front of these picked men was one of the hundred personal companions of the Padishah. He was a very tall and muscular young man, and looked extremely angry. The eyes of the beauty chorus behind him were fixed upon the horrible throng advancing against them, and they did not look better pleased than their chief. As the diabolical contingent drew near, exclamations of horror arose all the way down the line. "Are they yewman?" asked a spectator standing between Pullman's legs. "I'm buggered if I know," the man stationed between Mannock's legs expressed his ignorance. Mannock bristled. "How shameful! I know I shall be sick in a minute," came from him. Pullman trembled; he was silent. To a roar of fear, of disgust, of half-human cries, snorts and gasps, advanced pirouetting the double line of demons hoofed and horned, frisking and cavorting, ogling and grimacing, and, not by any means least, emitting the most revolting stench. This assailed the noses of all the spectators, however far away, the moment they made their appearance. As they advanced, with every step they stank more, and the smell developed intolerably. "What a ghastly sight!" Pullman muttered to his companion; "and oh my God, what a smell! Nothing human stinks like that." Their leader was a man. He was large and powerful, extremely dark, his face appearing to be discoloured. Stepping very quickly, he strode up to his opposite number, until their faces were a foot apart. A very elegant summer suit and brown shoes seemed to constitute him a man born of woman, though his countenance was so charged with evil that if he had walked along a city street in London or New York he would have been arrested at sight. He appeared to spit some words towards the face of the angel, 46</page><page sequence="20">WYNDHAM LEWIS and the other shook from head to foot with rage, but glared without speaking. The crowd everywhere had recoiled a few feet, but the armed police stood their ground. The infernal contingent eyed, sideways and slit-faced, the on- lookers as they passed them; these monstrous, sideways, half-men were throughout naked-except that you would not call them that, any more than you would use such a word regarding an elephant, or a kangaroo, or an ape. Not that they belonged to an unmixed type; they had the smiles of inexpressibly loathsome men, but they stamped upon hoofs which were purely animal. Purely animal were their powerful, oily and hairy legs. Their arms and hands were disagreeably human; except that the top of the arm, like the breast, was covered in thick hair; the head was a mystery-the face was that of a very large goat, but it had many human attributes. Most enigmatic of all were the messages which darted from and smouldered in the elongated eyes. Nearest to the spectators was a hoofed creature, with a human face goatish and leering. His penis and his tail had the appearance of being a continuous organ, the tail growing out of the body at the rear exactly opposite the place where the penis issued from the body in front, arching downwards as did the tail. The nipples hung from the breasts, like corkscrews, and two short horns sprouted out from the scaly forehead. This man of hoofs kept sliding his eyes around at the spectators, and suddenly he thrust out a hooked tongue, which protruded almost a foot from his face. "Oo, did you see what the bastard did?" " 'Ere, 'Arry, did you see 'im, boy!" A head shot about looking for Harry. In the second rank of the infernal animals was one with so goatish a countenance that his curving nose constituted almost all of the profile of his face. In his case the penis was erect, but curved upwards like an inverted red hook. All the twenty, prancing, shuffling, swaying backwards and forwards, chattering, starting, laughing, snarling, grimacing in- carnations of evil, were never at rest for a moment. One of them lifted his tail and excreted. Another pissed. As they drew up behind their leader, in two tumultuous lines, one or two of them protruded their tongues at the line of blonds 47</page><page sequence="21">THE HUDSON REVIEW in front of them. One turned his back and farted. Several of the beauty chorus held handkerchiefs to their noses, which provoked hilarity in the infernal ranks. Pullman was fascinated by the abnormally brooding and violent expression of the man detailed to command these monsters at his back. He watched him as he stood there, wondering if he would deliver his message verbally or in writing. He did not have to wait long for the answer. Both Mannock and himself could hear every word with perfect distinctness. What, using a byronic formula, one might call respectively His Darkness and His Light- ness gazed into each other's eyes with such an infinity of hatred on both sides that Pullman wondered how they could stand so still. The hatred that came from Hell was a steady withering stream of fire, whereas the angelic rejoinder was disposed to flash indignantly. The first words came from the darker of the two. "You know what I am here for, Goody-two-shoes!" he hissed in the other's face. At these words the large blond countenance erupted. A furious response burst out of it on the instant, the big red lips farting the vocables out. "Pot-boy for boiling the damned in tar, what would you come for? Travelling for your dung-shop, is that it?" He from Hell affected dignity. "I am a bearer of an order from my chief. You-all of you-are to leave this place im- mediately. We order you to get out of this place without delay, and go back where you came from. Silly little song-birds of Jesus. This city is of no use to you. What do you do with it? Nothing that anyone can see. You pray all day, and leave it to the Bailiff to manage. We can make better use of it than you, so hand it over, or rather vacate it, the whole hundred of you. If you do not we shall come here in very great force, and make an end of you." "Is that all you have to say? And is it as an advertisement for your perfume that you bring with you those foul animals?" The devil's envoy leered back, a long obscene leer. "No, I brought them to shock your sensibilities. Disgusting, isn't it?" "You should have come like that yourself, instead of dressing up as you have. It was out of respect for me, I suppose. Have you anything else to say?" "There are many things I could say . . about your blond beauty chorus, for instance ... I could say a lot about them." 48</page><page sequence="22">WYNDHAM LEWIS The big blond face in front of the demonic leader was again convulsed, subject apparently to sudden rages. His voice flew up into the highest register. "We far prefer to be the opposite of what you like, Beelzebub's bottle-washer . . . you little fetch-and-carrier for that Smell in Hell... sucker-up-to-of-Satan." "You . .. You choir-boy of that Humbug in Heaven, you tuneful appendage of that pompous old egomaniac . . . the Al- mighty Sod-beg pardon, God." What these two figures were saying to one another could be heard a long way away, and in any case all over the Piazza it was obvious that a "row" was beginning. Everyone began to rush towards the center of disturbance, and an avalanche descended upon Mannock and Pullman. "I am glad you are here! I shall be able to shelter behind you." Shouting into Mannock's ear, Pullman grimaced. "I don't advise you to. I am not a very solid wall." A genuine alarm was visible in Mannock's face, mingled with a snobbish dis- taste for ending his days beneath the feet of a proletarian horde. He began to look around indignantly for police protection. "Where are the Police Officers?" As their pugnacity developed, to the amazement of everybody these two six-footers grew to be seven-footers, and the seven- footers grew to be eight-footers, and so on. The spectacle of these two carnival figures roaring at one another, standing so high above the surrounding people that nobody now looked any- where except at these two miraculously growing men, had turned the meeting into something even more stupefying; and Pullman noticed that there was a deepening hush of expectancy at their end of the Piazza. What was going on in people's minds? Ob- viously the advent of that fear which must accompany a miracle. A roar of such volume came from the blond giant as to strike terror in the crowd, many of whom began to edge away. The huge words crashed out in the air like a supernatural demonstra- tion. "Demon!" it began, and had a terrible echo. "Demon, I will crush you like a fly! Impudent black bug! I will annihilate you on the spot. Hell-bird, you will regret the day you brought your filthy troop to this city." Hell's envoy struck the other on the face, and the blow was 49</page><page sequence="23">THE HUDSON REVIEW a climax of alarm. There was a smothered Ooo among the spec- tators: the police who lined the square made ready their arms. Quite half the people near Mannock and Pullman had disappeared, and the others stood with white awe-struck faces. "If they begin fighting-and growing," Pullman whispered to Mannock, "we shall all be trampled under foot." The blond giant returned the blow, and both the escort of demons, and the blond followers of the Padishah's sprouting envoy, scuttled to the rear to avoid being trodden on. But the giants were now firmly fastened together, rocking about from side to side. Such panted remarks as "T-t-take your claws away from my throat," or "Blast you, I will tear your eyes out," could be heard, in the midst of enormous breathing and threatening grunts. Pullman had noticed long before this that both giants had kicked off their shoes, which lay, very minute footwear, not far from where their feet were moving. Their clothes had every- where burst asunder. But it was at this moment, that, with enormous splutters and gasps, they suddenly levitated. With the little garments of a mere six-footer, none of them intact, hanging from them in loops and wisps, two vast nudities rose into the air and disappeared over the roofs. But they made their exit buttocks uppermost. Hell was on top, as they rose out of the Piazza. Hell's messenger protruded against the azure sky an anchovy-coloured balloon. But this was immediately succeeded by an upsurge of pink limbs, of enormous size, climbing up on top of the darker element; and that is how they actually vanished behind the roofs, a picture in pink, wine-brown, and azure, the last things seen being three or four violently agitated feet, pink feet and brown feet, the stiff tumbling spikes of twenty toes signalling the agita- tion beneath. For those who still watched, with great excitement, the vanishing of the aerial combatants, there was a sequel in a very few minutes. Seemingly a considerable distance beyond where the agonized feet had vanished, the two figures, grown enormously in size, reappeared, locked together in a mad embrace, and aimed upwards towards the sun, the moon, and the stars. The light figure had now, springing out of its shoulders, prodigious wings, stretched to their utmost length, and dazzling white, whereas the dark figure protruded wings of a smaller size, dark and bristling. 50</page><page sequence="24">WYNDHAM LEWIS Blood dripped from both, and splashed down among the markets near First Piazza, so it was learned later on. But there was a third figure of the white persuasion-an enormous full-sized angel, rising into the sky beyond the moat. It was obvious at once that the diabolic intruder had seen this third figure, because an intensive struggle began between the two original antagonists; the dark one was tearing himself away from the embrace of the white. Almost at once the severance was effected, and a huge black figure dashed away, over the roofs, coming down, it was reported later on, in Tenth Piazza; grown smaller already, he made a crash landing near the centre of the Piazza, rolling over and over like a parachutist reaching the earth at the end of a drop of considerable depth. Then he was seen to spring into the air, and land upon a balcony above the long arcade. There he crouched, getting smaller and smaller as the people watched him, and then there was a loud report, and he was cov- ered in what was described as a little cloud, like that caused by many forms of explosion. When the smoke cleared away, this combatant, the dark one, had disappeared. Above the Piazza the two white angels had flown circling round over the crouching black figure; when their enemy evaporated, they turned and flew in a wide circle over the city, and were last seen circling down towards the enormous barracks, at the moat-side, where the hundred angels had their post. The wounded one was still bleed- ing as he flew. And that was the last that was seen or heard of this supernatural combat. Pullman stood back exhaling noisily. "Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian," he said, as if to himself. Mannock was about to reply when he seemed to change his mind. He continued to gaze up into the sky, apparently displeased. The crowd stood uncertainly as if in a dream. Everyone began looking at everyone else, some with a smile. But a new event took the place of the old. There was a fresh roar from the crowd, as two of the animals sprang upon one of the blonds in front of them, and dragged him over beneath their hoofs. Then they proceeded to tear him to pieces, rolling him over and over, and both of them scratching his face and neck. The blond was screaming, and, at the sight of the blood, the neighbouring crowd began a violent demonstration. However, several of his fellow-blonds rushed in to rescue him. 51</page><page sequence="25">THE HUDSON REVIEW This they had partly succeeded in doing, but with the result that the entire body of goatish men and beautiful young policemen were at each others' throats. It was a lorryful of troops, which was parked immediately above the station-entrance, who first saw in detail what was hap- pening. Pullman was nearly thrown to the ground by an onrush of armed men. Jumping over spectators lying in their path, the troops swarmed through the police barrier and at once the sounds of rifle-fire mingled with the screams and groans of the combat- ants. But quite half of the animals had withdrawn from the struggling mass. They huddled together, showing every sign of alarm and anxiety. They chattered to one another, casting fearful glances over their shoulders, and moving a little towards the centre of the Piazza. Two Police blasts sounded, and on the other side of the Piazza the Police advanced from where they were standing in front of the onlookers. About a dozen, with rifles drawn at the ready, bore down upon the uncertain group of animals, helped them to make up their minds which way to go, and also determined for them what speed they should adopt for their with- drawal. Meanwhile the confused battle proceeded where a few more aggressive animals were leading the attack on the blonds; but now the troops were attempting to pick off as many of their infernal visitors as possible. "Crack-crack, crack-crack," went the rifles, and with a howl of unearthly pain an animal would fall to the ground. The blond casualties who had been pulled out of the melee by the Police were in an awful condition; Pullman noticed in one case, that the young man had had his trousers forced open and his sex had been literally torn from his body. Then, as though obeying a signal, with great abruptness the ani- mals broke off where they were fighting, attempting to disengage themselves. Quite suddenly they appeared very anxious that the battle should terminate. Dragging their casualties after them, they began gliding away, in some cases clutching up the wounded, carrying them in their arms like enormous babies. The Civil-Guards who had been engaged, though merely as snipers, in the melee, at once stepped back allowing the animals to join their main body without molestation. As to the blonds, more bitterly and totally engaged with their demonic opposites, 52</page><page sequence="26">WYNDHAM LEWIS as if by magic relieved of the necessity of fighting, they stepped back too, all more or less seriously wounded. Like a number of big schoolboys, they walked or hobbled back to where their lines had been, comparing notes, showing one another bitten fingers, scratched faces, and, in one case, Pullman noticed, a quite severe eye-injury. Some looked back towards the casualties who lay in a neat row, being given first aid by the Police. Pullman heard one say: "The filthy bastards nearly did in old Albert." The attention of Mannock and Pullman had, up to now, been fully occupied. They looked at one another simultaneously, smil- ing as they did so. "What was the meaning of that remark of yours ..." "About being a Christian?" Pullman interrupted him. Mannock nodded his head, saying, "Yes. I see you remember." "Mannock, we have witnessed a miracle! People in this City disappear into the sky, two or three times their normal size . . . and I see live devils in front of me, not many yards away." And he crossed himself. "A most confirmed disbeliever would publicly beg your par- don," Mannock agreed. "That is what I must do," Pullman sighed. "But I must do so to a priest." "Do you know where the Catholic Cathedral is to be found? It is just at the farther end of this Piazza." "Thank you," Pullman said. The hostility of the crowd increased, which seemed to enter- tain the demons. With girlish giggles, and splutters of laughter, some of the demonic creatures were chattering together, evidently saying the equivalent of "What a game! What shall we do next?" But the majority were more serious, visibly uneasy. They all were moving about without ceasing, in a kind of St. Vitus's dance. At the sound of revolver shots fired in the air by two officers of the police, several of them sprang up for nearly the height of their bodies. It was in a less orderly group-with shrill noises, and stamping and scuffling, frisking and pirouetting, some of them ogling the crowd as they passed-that they reached the spot where they had first alighted. Then there came a kind of crack, like the sound of an enormous whip, and the next moment that part of the Piazza was filled with a dense bituminous smoke. When it 53</page><page sequence="27">THE HUDSON REVIEW had cleared, the fiends, both casualtied and intact, were no longer there. Everyone was choking and spitting where they were near enough to be affected by the smoke added to the bodily stench of the animals. The police had begun clearing the square, and driving the remainder of the crowd before them into the side- streets. Pullman and Mannock themselves took the way of the Underground, Pullman muttering, "Yes, let us get home. I have a great deal to think about." On the return journey they did not say very much to one an- other. Back in the living room they appeared somewhat taciturn also. Very soon Platon brought tea, and after they were refreshed, Mannock spoke. "I really do not know what is happening here. The man we saw disappear into the sky-I mean the blond one-I have met and talked to a dozen times. He was a very pleasant fellow; not much to say for himself, but as gentle as a lamb. To watch him grow- ing in size until he towered over the Piazza, to hear him roaring out words which a kitchen scullion might envy, and this speech so magnified in volume that it shook the whole of the enormous square, and lastly to see him, practically naked, disappearing into the sky, locked in the arms of a ghastly demon from Hell, is not the kind of thing I ever expected to see in this City. What would we have said in our former life in London, say, if we saw the Queen growing larger and larger until she was as tall as Bucking- ham Palace; if we saw her take flight, shouting curses at her Chamberlain, or perhaps at the Prime Minister-who also started to become unnaturally large, until his head appeared above the houses in Downing Street. What would our sensations be?" "We should be justifiably amazed," Pullman declared. "But it is a thing which could never happen, because we are mere mortals, the Queen as much as ourselves. Now here, it is a different mat- ter. You must allow me to say that you have made a mistake. Those are supernatural personages, our rulers here. You have tended, I feel, to treat them too much as if they were the King and Queen. All the time that you were talking to that Immortal (whom we have just seen in his proper role) you should have expected him to fly out of the window or up into the sky." Mannock threw himself back in the chair where he was sitting, his face a battlefield of very disturbing emotions. Looking at 54</page><page sequence="28">WYNDHAM LEWIS Pullman with displeasure, he answered him in the following way: "Thank you for your lecture. I am most obliged to you for pointing out my shortcomings. But I am a very simple man who takes things and people as he finds them, and is not gifted with second sight." Pullman saw at once that he had made a bad mistake, and that with so conventional a man as Mannock a much milder and duller attitude was essential. He had been very much excited by the spectacle in Fifth Piazza. But so had Mannock, as was shown by his own imaginary picture of a gigantic Queen. Yes, but because Mannock had been betrayed into swollen and fantastic imagery, the temptation to talk big in reply should have been resisted. "Ah well," and Pullman laughed, as he moved freely about upon the settee, "I am afraid I have been rather intoxicated by what I have seen. The scent of Hell is an aroma which does not suit me. The way I look at this afternoon's events is quite differ- ent from you. I am stupefied by the miraculous. All my life I was a sceptic. And now I see that I was very short-sighted. The miraculous here is the most common or garden of things: for men (whom we are able to meet socially) are literally walking miracles. I should not be in the least astonished if tomorrow Jesus Christ appeared in Third City: I should merely bow my head. If I heard the voice of God I should not be surprised." There was a pause during which Pullman observed that all the anger had left Mannock's face, and he was considering what his friend had said to him. His face was so mobile, and expressed his thoughts in such a stylish way, that it might be described as a very charming factor in the make-up of this very simple man. After a little Mannock began to speak in a voice that was completely changed. "You know, Pullman, I am, I am afraid, a very worldly fool. You have opened my eyes to what I should have seen, instead of the quite dull things which I did see. I can't tell you how grate- full I am. I might never have realised this if we had not been together in Fifth Piazza, and if we had not had this conversation afterwards." His eyes were misted with tears as he looked over at the bearded figure, who, in a few words, had shown him the vast importance 55</page><page sequence="29">THE HUDSON REVIEW of what had occurred. They both sat in silence for some time, Mannock eagerly conning over the backgrounds of this revela- tion. Of God he had always been mystically aware . . . that is, when he was in a beautiful church and the organ was playing some terrific piece; but at other times this awareness shrank to something that he found it impossible to think of except as a cold abstraction: but now he had seen with his own eyes the great Mazdean Principles of Light and Dark, of the Good and the Bad, locked in a fearful embrace, disappearing into the sky. And what had he been thinking of a short while after that? He had been thinking of the indecorous behaviour of one of the leading figures in the ruling caste of the City-of something that was not done, or was not said. He felt very humble, but he also felt very elated. He rose and stretched, saying, "I am not quite up to these reve- lations. I think I will go and lie down for a little." "I should, if I were you," Pullman told him. "I feel rather shattered myself." He stood up. "I think I will go and have a wash to start with. I may have forty winks." They smiled at one another, and Mannock went to his room, Pullman to the lavabo. 56</page></plain_text>
