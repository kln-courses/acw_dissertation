<plain_text><page sequence="1">116 THROUGH A WINDOW: MY THIRTY YEARS WITH THE CHIMPANZEES OF GOMBE Jane Goodall Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1990 Precis. This is Jane Goodall's anecdotal meditation on her years at Gombe. Consisting of twenty relatively short chapters, it is only loosely chronological. Rather it has a number of foci. First, there is the field research itself and the setting within which it has taken place more or less continuously for over thirty years. The first chapter is a narrative describing a day in the field with Dr. Goodall. Her observations are interspersed with her thoughts on what it means to look "through a window" at the world of the chimpanzee, "searching for meaning" (p. 10). In the second chapter she contin- ues her musings about what she is trying to learn via her research, discussing the problem of ascribing emotions and intellectual ability to non-human primates. The third chapter briefly introduces the reader to the Gombe Stream Research Cent?n Starting with the fourth chapter there is a long series of chapters that focus either on relationships or on in- dividual animals that Goodall has found particularly interesting. Among the former are chapters on moth- ers and daughters, power, change, sex, war, sons and mothers, and love. Among the latter are chapters on Figan, Gilka, Goblin, Jomeo, Melissa, and Gigi. There is also a chapter on the baboons of Gombe and their interactions with the chimpanzees. The final three chapters deal with the relationship between humans and chimpanzees. First, she com- pares and contrasts the two species, addressing the issue of what humans can learn about themselves by studying chimpanzee behavior. Second, she writes a powerful indictment of the cruelty which humans show to the chimpanzees they capture to use for their own monetary enrichment or for other purposes. The book ends with an evocation of what it means to Jane Goodall to be able to enter the "magic world" of the chimpan- zee where she can "find peace, and energy," "a world to heal the battered spirit." (p. 240) This conclusion is followed by two appendices: (1) some thoughts on the exploitation of non-human animals; and (2) chimpan- zee conservation and sanctuaries. ?Carol Barner-Barry</page><page sequence="2">117 Conservation Rhetoric and the Chimpanzees of Gombe Blaine P. Biedermann Department of Zoology University of Florida Gainesville, Florida 32611 Jane Goodall is probably one of the most universally recognized names in conservation biology, both by the biological conservation community, as well as by the general public. Through her five previous books (Through a Window is her sixth), her extensive public tours, and especially the widely viewed television programs pro- duced by the National Geographic Society, Goodall has sensitized the world to the plight of our closest living non- human relatives, the chimpanzees of the genus Pan (spe- cifically Pan troglodytes). Through a Window is largely a continuation of Goo- dall's effort to educate the public about chimpanzee cul- ture. Goodall strongly believes that education is the key to survival for the chimpanzees of Gombe and the few other remaining populations of their genus. Environmentalists generally agree that one of the keystones for future conser- vation is the education of children. Although Dr. Goodall has previously published for children, this book is clearly written for an adult audience. While the author presup- poses little, if any, biological background of the reader, she knows the intellectual potential of the reader and carefully lays the framework of this rhetorical discourse. In order for a biological conservationist to be success- ful, he or she must gain popular interest, whether it be an interest in a single species or in a large tract of tropical rain forest. Since the Western world is rather intolerant of absolute control over biological resources, the conserva- tionist needs to persuade cooperation within and among societies to achieve this goal. Goodall has done this through the thoughtful publication of thirty years* research on the behavior of a single species in the wild. A three decade field study of any non-human primate population is unprecedented in ethology and for its own success must be commended. In order to persuade the reader to the side of chimpanzee conservation, Goodall has combined three essential ele- ments of a sound rhetorical argument. First, she recognizes that the rationale behind chimp conservation is not self- evident to all readers. Extensive description of day-to-day chimpanzee life appeals to the morals of the reader. Sec- ond, she recognizes and addresses the target audience. Concentration on description and anecdote is very effec- tive for a mostly lay audience. Finally, she capitalizes on the appropriate tone (which might be read by some as a level of ambiguity; see following) for that audience. Conservation is a practice that experiences periodic surges in our society. When human welfare is at stake, interest in conservation of other species and their habitats wanes. On the other hand, humans somehow seem to return to an emotional state of mind during which we consider "harmony with nature" of great importance. It's at these periods that conservationism (more popularly misconstrued as environmentalism) gains popularity. From time to time we need to be reminded by professional ecologists of the significance to our own lives of the lives of other species. The late 1980%s saw a growing concern for animal rights. Despite semantic controversy over the defining characteristics of "animal" and "rights" it is admirable that Goodall does not discriminate within either of these categories. The reader is simply faced with the facts. Chimpanzees are undergoing extreme population decimation and if this trend continues, the species will likely become extinct. If this prediction is important to the reader, conservation efforts will follow. This book is not intended to be a bibliographic source for ethologists. It craves references to critical data. This however, should not depreciate its value, since it is in- tended for a popular audience. Primatologists know where to look for the objective data they need (Goodall, 1986). The significance of this work is in its more liberal audi- ence. Two of the most prevalent criticisms of this book will undoubtedly relate to its subjective tone and its high degree of anthropomorphism. Often this subjectivity is read as ambiguity without consideration of the audience for which it is intended. Recent reviews of de Waal (1989) in this journal produced such opinions. Often anthropomor- phism arises in the study of animal behavior because of the</page><page sequence="3">118 temptation to equate human values with those of the non- human primates we study. Goodall recognizes this criti- cism, but explains her tone to her readers: When I began my study at Gombe in 1960 it was not permissible?at least not in ethological circles?to talk about an animal's mind. Only humans had minds. Nor was it quite proper to talk about animal personal- ity. Of course everyone knew that they did have their own unique characters?everyone who had ever owned a dog or other pet was aware of that. But ethologists, striving to make theirs a 'hard' science, shied away from the task of trying to explain such things objec- tively. One respected ethologist, while acknowledg- ing that there was 'variability between individual animals', wrote that it was best that this fact be 'swept under the carpet*. At that time ethological carpets fairly bulged with all that was hidden beneath them (p. 14). In addition to the rhetorical features discussed above, this monograph contains often surprising comparisons of the sociobiology of chimps and humans. One of the most striking features of Through a Window is the number of ap- parently homologous behaviors shared by humans and chimpanzees. Chimpanzees in Gombe pursue many of the most base social practices of human culture, according to Goodall, including the pursuits of power, love, sex, and war to name a few. Good or bad, these behaviors continue to evolve in both of our cultures, and the most optimistic forecast is for continued benign interaction between chim- panzees and humans in central Africa and around the world.
