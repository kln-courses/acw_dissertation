<plain_text><page sequence="1">New Zealand Slavonic Journal 1994 STEPHEN MARDER A Brief Analysis of Modern Russian Computer Slang* Slang is language in its most unfettered state. It is a form of language which shifts imperceptibly between a smile and a smirk. It is language which amuses and comforts. It would be difficult to find a comprehensive definition of slang which would be universally accep- ted by all linguists. Slang means different things to different people. By its very nature it seems to defy rigid classification. Slang is relent- less in its search for new forms of expression. Slang thumbs its nose at linguists who dare to force it into a corner or try in any way to pin it down! Slang is omnipresent: architects, engineers, students, bankers, drug addicts, astronomers, pilots, circus performers, soldiers, musi- cians, literary historians, automobile mechanics, athletes, farmers, taxi drivers, prostitutes, hunters, medical doctors, alcoholics, sociologists, criminals, to name just a few, all use slang in their everyday activities. English-language collections of slang are numerous, but it is not pos- sible to say the same about lists or dictionaries of slang in Russian. Historically, slang as a pre-eminent form of non-standard speech never enjoyed the status of a legitimate area of linguistic investigation in the former USSR. This is not to suggest that Russian slang was non- existent. Quite the contrary. However, with very few exceptions the many varieties of Russian slang remained unrecorded. The mo- mentous changes which have been sweeping Russia over the last sev- eral years have not changed this situation significantly. And although artificial barriers to publishing Russian dictionaries of slang in Russia no longer exist, in particular, those of politics and prudery, - the country has far more serious matters to concern itself with - the ma- * The use of the word 'slang' in this article must be qualified. Strictly speaking, it would be more correct to refer to the special, informal language used by program- mers and others in the field of computers as 'computer jargon'. However, I have chosen not to do this for two reasons: (1) 'computer jargon' is less convincing to the Anglo-Saxon ear than 'computer slang', and (2) many of the examples cited in this article are still in the process of establishing themselves, are still crystallising and have yet to be codified. From this perspective my present use of the term 'slang' combines elements of jargon with professionalisms. 97</page><page sequence="2">jority of such publications thus far must be characterised as amateur- ish. According to the latest issues of Knizhnoe obozrenie, dictionaries of 'forbidden words' now feature in lists of bestsellers. Sadly, how- ever, such publications are aimed at the broadest possible commercial market. As a consequence, the present status of dictionaries of slang in Russia must be viewed more as a money-making enterprise than a purely scholarly pursuit. If we turn our attention to the scientific-technological revolu- tion, arguably one of the most intense areas of development is compu- ter technology. Dictionaries of computer terms, to include specialised Russian-English dictionaries, contain upwards of 30,000 terms. One would look in vain, however, for non-standard computer terms in such works. Over the following few pages I would like to look behind the scenes, so to speak, in order to uncover a previously uninvestigated area of specialised slang: modern Russian computer slang. A few caveats are in order. First of all, the number of slang words cited in this article makes no claim whatever to completeness; they are merely representative. Secondly, the whole concept of 'nor- mativity' must be suspended. The orthography, stress, semantics and etymology of these computer slang terms are open to considerable discussion and debate. It is likely that a computer specialist in Irkutsk and his counterpart in Piatigorsk would have their own versions of what is correct and what is not. As a result, I must qualify my linguis- tic commentary with the statement that the material cited, of necessity, must be subjected to further scrutiny. This is, after all, no more than a first look at preliminary data. Thirdly, I make no attempt to distinguish what may be considered a colloquial computer term from what could be viewed as a slang computer term. The two are often virtually indis- tinguishable. Fourthly, it is likely that some of the terms cited are slang terms with an extremely limited sphere of usage. No attempt has been made to delineate these spheres geographically. Fifthly, there is an underlying assumption throughout that the reader has an under- standing of at least the barest rudiments of computers and the terms used in their description. Clearly, the more extensive one's knowledge of the computer field, the greater the level of appreciation of the cited material. And lastly, it is conceivable that some of these computer terms are no more than figments of someone's imagination. One should be on the lookout for smirks posing as smiles! There are three sources for the terms cited on these pages. First and foremost is the anonymous 3jieKTpoHHbiM acaproHapwii (Elec- 98</page><page sequence="3">ironic Jargonary), a collection of about 100 Russian computer slang terms, which has been available on the Internet for several years now. Second is A Supplementary Russian-English Dictionary (Stephen Marder, 1992), and third - material which will appear in the next edition of this dictionary. The assembled material is divided into the following categories: 1 . Software and hardware 2. Peripherals 3. Modems, electronic mail, and electronic bulletin boards 4. Compression formats 5. Operations, functions, activities 6. Specialists 7. Miscellaneous * * * 1. Software and hardware co$TBápMM 'software' The element co(J)T is attested in both non-slang as well as slang formations. (Cf. co$t 'soft (glove) leather' (e.g. nappa or imitation leather)', C0(J)t6óji ' Softball'; có&lt;J)TBep 'software'; cf. also 'software' in its non-slang varieties: MaTOÖecneneHHe (&lt;MaTeMaTMHecKoe o6e- cnenéHMe) and nporpáMMHoe oöecneieHHe/cpencTBO.) A minor hu- morous effect is achieved here through syllabification: co(J)-TBap-HM. The antonym *xapnBápnH is not attested. aceJié3O 'hardware' The new meaning results through semantic extension of an ex- isting word. Cf. a general slang meaning of 2œjié3O ('bread', 'brass', 'dough' (= money)). 'Hardware' in non-slang may be rendered by an- napáTHaa nounépacica, annapáTHoe ooecnenéHue, (annapáTHoe) oSopyjïOBaHMe, annapáTHbie/TexHHiecKne cpéjjcTBa, MaiuwHHoe/ TexHMHecKoe oGecne^éHue and xápuBep. 6epnáH, BMHT, bmht^mk, HMCK, Tflacëjibiii iipaMB, xapji 'hard disk (drive)' With the exception of SepuáH, which in its non-slang meaning is a shortened form of an historical reference to a type of rifle (6ep- jláHKa 'Berdan rifle'), the other terms emphasise one of the elements 99</page><page sequence="4">of 'hard', 'disk' or 'drive', or of the movement of the components of the hard disk. The idea of spinning or turning is rendered by bmht, biíhthhk; 'hard' (= heavy) by xapn and TiDKëJibiH; and the concepts of 'disk' and 'drive' are transmitted transparently by hhck and apaiiB. Some of these words have meanings in other slang areas, e.g. bmht may be a billiards term ('side', 'English') or a drug term (type of syn- thetic drug). In non-slang 'hard disk (drive)' is known variously as BMHHéCTepCKMM flHCK, (JÏMCK Or HaKOFlHTeJlb) BMHHéCTep, acëCTKHH HHCK, BMHHéCTepCKMH ¿JMCKOBblM HaKOnHTCJIb, HaKOIHÍTCJlb Ha acëcTKOM MarHiÍTHOM ÄiicKe (H5KMJ],). annapáT, KOMnyTep, MauíMHa, nepcoHáJiíca, nHcnuiica, Tánica 'PC (personal computer)' All these terms are used genetically to denote 'PC although 'by default' IBM computers are understood. AnnapáT, MauíHHa and Tán- ica have received their specialised meaning through semantic exten- sion. (Note, however, that two of these words have slang usages out- side the field of computers: MauiMHa 'rod' (gun or pistol) (criminal si); '(hypodermic) needle or syringe' (drug sl.)'9 and Tánica 'car', 'old car'; 'taxi' (general si.).) FlepcOHájiica is based on a productive model: nepcoHáJi[bHbiM + KOMnbiÓTep +]ica, whereas nHCHiuica de- rives phonetically from 'PC (uncu) in combination with the diminu- tive or hypocoristic suffix -mica. KoMnyTep seems to reflect a 'man- on-the-street' pronunciation of the 'learned' KOMnbiÓTep, or perhaps a degradation in pronunciation (KOMnbiÓTep - &gt; KOMniÓTep - &gt; kom- nyTep). SMTMUiKa 'IBM PC/AT'; MKCTiiiiiKa, xa-Tá 'IBM PC/XT' Two of the most popular models of IBM PCs are reflected in the three words cited. (*A-T3 is unattested.) The word-formation models present belong to a combination of two widespread categories in Russian: phoneticisation (AT - &gt; smtm, XT - &gt; mkctm, XT - &gt; xa-Tá) + suffixation (-mica). riMCioxa 'PC-compatible (computer)' Formed on the basis of fihcm (&lt;PC) + the augmentative suffix -K)xa. KOCÓM 'twin-floppy or dual-floppy disk drive' [N.B. One of the disk drives is 5.25", whereas the other is 3.5". No known English equivalent apart from the cited one has been found.] 100</page><page sequence="5">The word functions as both adjective and adjectival noun, and the humorous effect is achieved by association with squinting (ko- CHTb). BáKca 'VAX' {type of minicomputer) This word illustrates the concept of popular etymology resulting from a reading of the English 'VAX' as Baicc and the subsequent as- sociation with the nearest Russian-sounding equivalent (BáKca). npiÓKep, nenáTaJuca 'printer'; BaewicajiKa 'dot-matrix printer'; Jiá- 3apb 'laser printer' The unifying feature of these four words is 'printer', a concept which in non-slang is rendered by the generic nenáTaiomee ycTpÓH- CTBO, ycTpÓMCTBO nenáTH (now rarely used) or npMHTep, or more specifically by MáTpMHHbiw/MrÓJibqaTbiM npMHTep and less often by 3HaKOCMHTe3Mpyiomee nenáTaiomee ycTpÓHCTBO, neqáTaiomee ycTpÓHCTBO MáTpMHHoro Trina, (TÓHeHHo)MáTpMHHoe nenáTaiomee ycTpÓMCTBO. (Here and elsewhere appropriate adjectives may be com- bined equally with either npiimep or neiáTaiomee ycTpÓMCTBO.) The commonest way to refer to 'laser printer' is Jiá3epHbiH npjÍHTep. The slang terms each illustrate special features: BacMK refers to the specific rasping sound produced by the majority of dot-matrix printers; ná3apb can be viewed as a folk-etymological formation (cf. the personal name Jlá3apb); npiÓKep is an exotic borrowing from German; and nená- TaJiKa combines the familiar suffix -Ka so widespread in less formal varieties of Russian together with the root element nenaT-. It should be noted that a slang equivalent of the other major type of printer - the inkjet printer (in non-slang: CTpyMHbiM npMHTep) - is unattested. xyjiHT náKKapji (cf. HÓpTOH-ráiO This is a playful reference to 'Hewlett Packard' in which the humorous effect is achieved through a merging of the senses of 'Hew- lett' with a form of xyjiMTb ('to abuse, revile'). 2. Peripherals HMCKéTHMK, KapiviáH, $Jion, (pjionápb, (pJionoBÓA, xjionápb, 'floppy disk drive' A half-dozen slang synonyms are used in the sense of 'floppy disk drive'. (Cf. non-slang HaiconiÍTejib Ha thSkom MarmÎTHOM uric- ice.) XlMCKéTHMK combines the elements HHCKéTfa] with the produc- tive suffix -HHK. Semantic extension accounts for the use of KapiviáH in its conventional computer meaning. The element &lt;t&gt;Jion- is evident 101</page><page sequence="6">in half the synonym series, first as a truncated version ($Jion) of $Jión(n)H-HMCK + mcKOBÓJi, then in combination with the slang suf- fix -ápb in $Jionápb, and finally in the transparent $JionoBÓji. In the historical development of Russian, in particular, as evidenced in a specific dialectal feature, the letters $ and x were often confused. In xjionápb this situation is played out to maximum advantage to achieve a comic effect. Another explanation is association with the idea of the metal disk window 'snapping shut' (cf. xjiónaTb). öjimh 'a single disk' {from a box of disks); 6ynÍBKa 'boot(able) disk', 'startup disk', 'System disk'; xáeBaa HHCKéTa 'high-density floppy disk' Three different types of floppy disk are represented in the three slang words cited. The idea of flatness is immediately apparent in 6 Jim h ('pancake'), whose specialised computer meaning obtains through semantic extension. ByTflBKa is derived from 6yTMTb (see be- low): 6yT- + the demeaning suffix -flBica. (Cf. non-slang 3arpyacá- eMafl/3arpy3oqHafl jjucieéTa 'boot disk'.) In xáeBau jjHCicéTa we see a combination of slang and non-slang elements. J^HCieéTa is now the commonest way to refer to a floppy disk, but xáeBbiíí (&lt;high) is un- adulterated slang. It has analogues in general slang, where the -OBbiñ/- eBbiií element usually attracts the stress (e.g. SjiyëBbiM 'blue', yaiÍTÓBbiM 'white'). Mbiuia, Kpbica 'mouse' Standard Mbiuib is seen to be transformed into m bini a (also common in non-standard Russian). More amusing, however, is the term Kpbica. The entry for this word in the Electronic Jargonary reads as follows: 'CoBéTCKafl Mbimica. (Brine™? Pa3MépoM e ynór. :-) )' There we have it - with even a 'smilie' (= emoticon) thrown in! noflMbimica 'mouse pad' An elegant formation (noa + Mbiui + Ka). Báaca 'VGA'; ë*, éaca 'EGA'; ícaprá 'CGA'; nrá 'EGA' These slang terms denoting four types of monitors are all based on a Russian reading of English abbreviations. With the exception of éaca and Báaca, which have a Frenchified ring to them, the other three words are all familiar to the Russian ear. MáTepHafl nJiáTa 'motherboard'; nJiMTKa 'board', 'card' Here we see a contrast between non-slang iuiáTa in combina- tion with a special adjectival form of 'mother'. In Modern Russian MáTepHbiM is invariably associated with a 'mother oath', and thus 102</page><page sequence="7">through its combination here with iuiáía an unexpected humorous effect is achieved. (Cf. non-slang oötejiMHMTejibHafl/MaTepMHCKafl nJiáTa, nJiáTa BTopóro ypoBHfl Motherboard'.) Non-slang njiHTKa physically resembles a narrow, flat object, and so its semantic exten- sion to 'board', 'card' is quite natural. Keoápua, icéHOopaa, KJiaßa, TeKJiáfla 'keyboard' The 'femininity' of 'keyboard' comes through in all four Rus- sian slang equivalents. Ke6ap.ua and Kéfi6opna represent variant Rus- sian readings of the English word. Kjiaßa is a clipped form from non- slang KJiaBMaTypa (but note the sound coincidence with the personal name Kjiaßa (&lt;KjiaBflHfl), whereas TeKJiájia is an exotic borrowing from Italian. THTMBáíl 'TTY' An old (but still widespread) reference to 'typewriter terminal' (TTY) is seen in this Russian sounding of the English abbreviation. Cf. rjiiÓKaTb B THTHBaii 'to trip on a TTY' (i.e. work from a console in symbolic mode) and KMJiíÍTb Bce TMTHBáH 'to kill all the TTYs'. HOJi6okjik)m 'perforator' A device for perforating cards is rendered in slang by the com- bined ideas of penetrating CuojiSnTb) and pecking (KJießaTb). npoÖKOTpOH 'powerful source of electrical interference' (in a nearby organisation) A fantastic combination of elements is used in this slang term: the lowly fuse (npoöica) is merged with the space-age suffix -TpÓH to produce a comic effect. One has the sensation that researchers work- ing in an adjoining building are using powerful equipment which not infrequently causes power surges and system crashes, the result of which is a loss of power in the immediate area. moto$óh, mo$óh 'tape-drive mechanism' These slang words, which may denote a tape recorder as well as a tape streamer, derive from MarHHTO&lt;J)ÓH ('tape recorder'). O3yiiJKa, páMKa 'RAM'; n333yiuica, pÓMica 'ROM' In standard computer terminology 'RAM' (random access memory) is rendered as onepaTMBHoe 3anoMHHáiomee ycTpÓHCTBO (O3Y). (Cf. also BHyTpeHHflfl/onepaTMBHafl náMHTb, 3anoMMHáiomee yCTpÓMCTBO C npOM3BÓJlbHOM Bbì6opKOM (3yiIB)/C IipOH3BÓJlbHbIM HÓCTynoM (3yn,[0, náMflTb c npoM3BÓJibHOM BbiSopKOÍí 'RAM'; and nojiroBpéivieHHoe 3anoMHHáiomee ycTpóíicTBo (JX3Y), nojiro- 103</page><page sequence="8">BpéMeHHafl/nocTOflHHaa náMflTb 'ROM'). A literal reading of O-3V together with the familiar suffix -Ka combine to form 03yuiKa, and we see a similar process at work in the formation of ri333yiiiKa. PáMica and pÓMKa are 'happy' contaminations of, respectively, RAM + Ka and ROM + Ka. CMUM-pÓMKa 'CD-ROM' In the present slangism we see a phoneticisation of an English abbreviation combined with the now familar Russianisation of 'ROM'. An additional humorous effect is acheived through associa- tion with a polite command in conversational mode to a fictitious interlocutor by the name of Roman: "Chum, PÓMKa!" 3. Modems, electronic mail, and electronic bulletin boards aeyaocáTb, KOHHéKTMTbCfl 'to make a connection' (by modem) With these slang words we are dealing with two entirely differ- ent approaches to verbalisation of a concept. In the case of acy^KacáTb, the usual sense of 'buzzing' is extended to include the characteristic sound of a modem making a connection with a mainframe or an elec- tronic bulletin board. The idea of 'connection' in KOHHéKTHTbCfl is rendered by the wholesale importation of a foreign root, to which is at- tached a 'reflexive' infinitive designator. iimnéTb m njießaTbCfl Following on from the previous two entries, here we have a more graphic representation of the characteristic sound of a modem and an electronic bulletin board making a connection. To anyone who has had occasion to listen to this sound, the ideas of 'hissing' (uiw- néxb) and 'spitting' (nJießaTbCfl) are perfectly reasonable descriptions of the nerve- wracking grating sound. He CHiòxaJiHCb 'no carrier/handshake error' This rather earthy slangism suggests 'reciprocal smelling at both ends', as it were, in other words, in order to make a proper con- nection across telephone lines certain conditions must be satisfied: the sender and the receiver 'smell out each other' with a view towards es- tablishing their compatibility to transmit information electronically. Meccár, Meccára 'message'; m3hjio, HeTMáíiJio 'mail' These are somewhat fanciful Russianisations of English words. HeTMSMJio has the additional sense of mail/a message received 'over the net' (i.e. through an Internet node). 104</page><page sequence="9">3(pTénHyTb 'to FTP' Arguably the most popular way to send and receive files over the Internet is through FTP (File Transfer Protocol). The present slang word is an elegant solution to the problem of how best to render the concept in a Russian environment! The fact that 3(J)TériHyTb has all the signs of being a semelfactive (perfective) verb should not overly concern us. The search for an imperfective form continues. Tjiauia 'GlasNet' The Russian electronic network FüácHeT 'GlasNet' is neatly transposed onto slang soil through the word Fjiáiua, a diminutive form of FjiacpMpa. Note also an echo in rjiácHOCTb and an affirmation of the idea, through the very existence of the Russian network, that rjiac ecTb ! 6e6écKa, ÖHÖnnocKa, ÖMÖHCMHa, öwÖHSCMHa, ÖHÖHacica, BBS6á 'BBS' Here we have a whole series of slangisms for 'electonic bulletin board [service]' (BBS), all of which are based on a literal sounding out of the English abbreviation either by reference to the name of a letter (6e - B) or to the sound of a letter (6m - B). As in many of the other slang words already examined, the suffix -Ka is well represented here. Specifics of word-formation include the attaching of a translated element onto a stem (6m6m + nocieá) and the use of the singulative el- ement -MHa (ÖMÖMC-MHa, 6M6w3C-HHa). The series is rounded out with an exotic hybrid: BBSSá. 4. Compression formats ynaKÓBaHHbiM, yTÓnTaHHbiíí 'compressed, 'compacted'; apaca- HÓM, apacëBaHHbiM; áwcoBbiH, npuaMcÓBaHHbiM; OTajixáneHHbiM, ajiáiueBbiM; 3acTá(J)(J)JieHHbiM, 3acry(})(|)JieHHbiH; 3a3nnÓBaHHbin; 3a3yaceHHbiM, 3a3ynjieHHbiii When we turn our attention to the present slang coinages, we find a wealth of forms, most of which are format specific. YnaKÓBaH- HbiM and yTÓnTaHHbiii are generic references to any kind of file com- pression and both make reference to 'packing' (ynaKOBáTb) and 'com- pacting' (yTonTáTb). (These as well as most of the other terms cited function as both adjectives as well as past participles passive.) Depending on what file types we are dealing with, we have a choice of forms, most of which come from the world of MS-DOS: ApacaHÓH and apaceßaHHbiM relate to ARJ-compressed fare- jayed') files. A humorous effect is achieved through sound similarity 105</page><page sequence="10">with vernacular and dialectal apacá ('rust') and apaeaHÓií ('rusty') (instead of low colloquial paca (cf. standard pacáBHHHa) and standard pacáBbiM). Note also North Russian apacaHÓM instead of pacaHÓH 'rye': apacaHÓM KapaBáñ, xjieS. Amcobwh and npMaMCÓBaHHbiw designate ICE-compressed ('iced') files. 'Iced' files predate 'LHA(rc)'ed files. OT3JixáHeHHbiM and 3JiáiueBbiH denote LHA(rc)-compressed ('el-harked') files. 3acTá$(I)JieHHbiM and 3acTy(J)(I)JieHHbiM represent coinages from the name (and different pronunciations) of one of the two most popular compression programs available for the Macintosh - Stufflt. The files so compressed are termed 'stuffed'. 3a3MnÓBaHHbiM relates to ZIP-compressed ('zipped') files. 3a3yaeeHHbiM and 3a3yiuieHHbiH designate ZOO-compressed ('zooed') files. As can be seen, the most popular prefix used in designating slang coinages of compressed files is 3a-, although other prefixes are also used, and some coinages are without prefixes. The prefix used with uncompressing ('unstuffing', etc.) files is pa3- (pac-), although these forms are not cited. 5. Operations, functions, activities acyHMBaTb, oSacynnBaTb 'to introduce or install a CBMIS' 'Computer-based management information system' (CBMIS) is known as aBTOMaTM3HpoBaHHan CMCTéivia ynpaBJiéHHfl (AC^) and on this basis the present slang verb is formed. There is a humorous asso- ciative link here with cyica ('bitch'). 6jiMHKOBáTb 'toblink' Transparently formed on the basis of the English verb. Cf. Kyp- cop ÖJiMHKyeT 'the cursor is blinking'. GyTMTb, 3a6yTMTb, oSyTHTb, 3ananTMTb, o6yTb 'to boot (up)'; nepeõyTOBáTbCfl 'to re-boot' (cf. riHHáTb, imyTb) The element -6yr- figures in all but one of the slang words in this synonym series. The etymology of 3aJianTMTb would appear to be generally related to the 'footwear' theme of 'booting'. BCTaTb, 3aBMCHVTb, 3a^peMáTb, noBMCHVTb, noTyxHyTb, pyx- HVTb, CKÓpHMTbCfl, cnoTKHyTbCfl, ynácTb 'to crash', 'die', 'hang', 'fall over' (cf. BMcejibHMK) Russian computer slang is rich in synonyms to describe the col- lapse of an operating system or program, and the words it uses to 106</page><page sequence="11">characterise the phenomenon closely parallel the English words cited. There are, however, a few interesting exceptions. 3anpeMáTb suggests no more than a temporary affliction - wishful thinking, of course, in the case of a major crash! - whereas CKÓpHHTbCfl lends the process an anthropomorphic sense of physical pain. (It remains something of a cosmic mystery why in the last decade of the twentieth century we still use the word 'crash' to refer to the given phenomenon. Nowadays, of course, 'crashes' are silent, but perhaps when they originally occurred they could be heard. . .) BbÍHecTH, noHecTM, CHecTM 'to erase all the files and reformat the disk' The verbs, each with a different prefix, point to a removal of the object, in this case the files. acaTb SaTÓHbi 'to press the buttons' (i.e. use a 'mouse') An interesting caique which combines a native Russian word (acaTb) with a foreign-sounding one (GaTÓHbi). nenaTHyTb, npMHTaHyTb 'to print' rienaTHyTb functions as a semelfactive of nenaiaTb, whereas npMHTaHyTb (also semelfactive) has its source in npiÍHTep. riHHáTb, iiHyTb 1. 'to send' (afile or e-mail). 2. 'to re-boot' (cf. nepeGyTOBáTbCfl) This slangism is a good illustration of semantic extension. Cf. standard rmyTb 'to kick'. nHxáTb KHÓriKM, ToriTáTb KHÓnKM 'to use a keyboard' In these slangisms 'buttons' (KHÓnicH) replace 'keys' (KJiáBM- iiim), and the expressive verbs riMxáTb ('to push, shove') and TonráTb ('to trample down') are combined in an original way. CHCÓriHTb, cbicónwTb 'to be a Sysop [system operator]' Illustrates a twofold approach to the pronunciation of English 'y' in 'Sysop'. CJiMBáTb, cJiMTb 'to back up, do or make a back-up or back-up copy' Semantic extension of standard CJTMBáTb ('to pour off/out'). TopMO3MTb 'to be a computer junkie' It is interesting to compare the present meaning with the sense of 'to be thick' (i.e. slow to comprehend), a sense found in general slang. 107</page><page sequence="12">6. Specialists BHceJibHHK 'inexperienced Sysop' (cf. 3aBHCHyTb, noBHCHVTb and others above) Whenever a BBS crashes, there are always those who are quick to point a finger at the Sysop! He (or she) is a convenient vehicle to carry the can since many (rightly) feel that the Sysop (and compan- ions) have been re- writing the code (again!) in order to improve the operation of the BBS. An experienced Sysop is all-knowing, and there is no computer problem he cannot solve. On the other hand, there is the inexperienced Sysop. In a real sense he is a 'gallows bird' (bh- cejibHMK), for whom hanging is too kind a punishment ( :-) ), since in- variably he is responsible for the temporary death ('crash') of the BBS. MaKpyiiiHMK 'macroassembler programmer' Chances are that if you ask 10,000 Russians what MaicpyiiiHHK means, all those who know the word, or think they know the word - probably a considerable number - will give you the answer to a to- tally different question. Most likely their answer will contain words like (in English translation) 'hit man or professional killer'. But this is the correct answer to another question: "Kto TaKOH 'MOKpyiiiHMK'?", i.e. the word spelled with 'o' and not 'a'. (Note: MoKpyiUHHK is de- rived from MÓKpoe Cnéjio), a centuries-old word (still very much alive (no pun intended!)) from the language of the underworld. The best English equivalent is the most literal one: 'wet job' (= murder, assas- sination).) In Russian computer slang there is a deliberate blurring of the senses of MOKpyiUHMK and MaKpyiiiHMK, words which are indis- tinguishable in pronunciation. Consider this a smile rather than a smirk. HacMJibHMK, CMOHMCT 'person who uses C, 'C programmer' Both of these words appear to have reached their present posi- tion in Russian computer slang owing to the presence in them of the element en - the Russian pronunciation of the computer language C. (Cf. the slang version of the program: U3.) The fact that one word hap- pens to denote 'rapist' (HacHJibHHK) and the other is the equivalent of 'zionist' (cmohmct) would seem to be purely accidental. nacKanflHT, nacKBMJiflHT 'person who uses Pascal', 'Pascal pro- grammer' The computer language Pascal (nacKánb) is reflected directly and fully in the humorous formation nacicajiflHT, whereas the slang 108</page><page sequence="13">version of Pascal - nacoMJib - is duly reflected through popular etymology in a second synonym: nacKBHJiíÍHT. peaHHMáTop 'reviver', 'resuscitate' (Le. hacker capable of reviv- ing or resurrecting a hopelessly 'hung' system despite all the latter* s efforts to 'resist' :-) ) This slangism illustrates the ease with which the usual medical sense of peaHHMáTop has been extended to include the computer field. 7. Miscellaneous nypnóc, jojbipnóc 'DR-DOS'; Macajtóc 'MS-DOS' Various phonetic readings of English abbreviations account for different results in the three slang terms given, with the element -floe common to all of them. 'DR-DOS' - the Digital Research version of DOS - comes out as either aypflóc or ubipnóc. Here we should note a humorous sound similarity between flypjjóc and jjypnÓM ('funny farm', 'nuthouse'). Macanoc - with its stress pretty much where you want it to go - is seen to be strikingly similar to a common English nickname for the Microsoft version of DOS - 'messy' DOS. rHyc 'GNUC; rHyTbiM 'GNUC (adj.) This - or any?! - version of GNU (pronounced 'gnu' without a silent 'g') - is a pretty vile piece of work in any language ( :-) ), and thus it is interesting to observe how this situation is transplanted onto Russian soil. The purely literal reading of g-n-u-s produces a pleasing comical effect. It is as if one needs a little light relief in order to deal with a program and programming environment many consider to be tedious. The 'curved' nature of GNU C may not be immediately obvious, but one would be well advised to stay clear of its 'horns' and otherwise avoid any 'curve balls' this beast may throw your way! TpySonacKaKáJib 'Turbopascal' Pascal (nacKáJib) has been subjected to a playful re- working in the present slangism, in which we seem to be whisking along (cica- HeM) at breakneck speed. y-HMX 'UNIX' The wordplay present in this slang item is easier to describe than to translate since it is based on the sound coincidence between y Hiíx and the strange-looking y-HHX. One could do no better than to quote the Electronic Jargonary: 'y-Hïix - UNIX (a y Hác - JléMOc)'. 109</page><page sequence="14">annjiMKyxa, MapaxáiÍKa, npHKJianyiiiica 'application program' Three different words account for as many different approaches to rendering a concept. AnnjiMKyxa is of course derived from 'appli- cation' with a resounding low-level suffix, whereas npHKJiajryiiJKa traces its origins to npnKJiajíHáfl nporpáMMa. MapaxáMKa remains a mystery. Perhaps it is related to MapáTb ('to soil, stain') and refers to the countless times a program must be rewritten in order to rid it of all bugs. MCXÓJJHHK 'source code' An elegant creation. Cf. mcxohhwh ('initial'). Cf. also (for added measure) mctóhhhk ('source'). HOJioárrep, KJionojiáB 'bug buster', 'debugger', 'debugging pro- gram' A kind of semi-quasi-calque accounts for flOJiSárrep (j'osi6 [lÍTb] + oárrep), whereas KJiononáB takes the creative process one step further. In this case we see the collective bug (KJion) having the life crushed out of it (naBHTb). (Cf. non-slang versions of the concept: OTJianoMHaa nporpáMMa, nporpaMMa-OTJiaflHHK, OTJiáj^HMK.) HÓpTOH-ráu 'Norton Guide' (cf. xyjuÍT IláKKapfl) Peter Norton's excellent diagnostic programs are well known to computer users throughout the world. In the present slangism we note a gentle poking of fun at his famous 'guide' in the guise of ra^ ! canMCT 'baddie' When computer games first came out they invariably pitted the Forces of Good against the Forces of Evil. Small wonder, then, that the latter should have received the name 'sadist' (earner), the idea being that one does not simply knock off one's enemies, one wipes them out totally, one vaporizes them with a vengeance when scattering their remains throughout electronic space. (J)áMHO, (jMJié 'file' Two radically different approaches to word-formation account for the present slangisms. The suffix -jio is not common in Russian computer slang (cf. MáíÍJio above) but figures in the first of our ex- amples ($aMJi + jio). (The standard word for 'file' is $aMJi.) How in- genious, though, is our other word - (pMJié ('fillet')! (J)éHfl, 4&gt;éHbKa 'feature' Both these words are well-attested in general slang (cf. $éHfl 1. 'criminal slang', 2. 'slang' (in general); (péHbKa 'decoration, adorn- 110</page><page sequence="15">ment'; 'knick-knack^)', 'trinket(s)' (e.g. beads to go with clothing)) In computer slang they have the sense of 'undocumented feature', a euphemism for 'bug'. npHMÓHKH 'bells and whistles' Programmers are traditionally engaged in an endless search to make their programs run faster and better and often their efforts are prized for their 'add-ons'. Such 'bells and whistles' distinguish a word processor which merely... processes words from one which combines traditional word processing with page layout capability. KOMnara6á6ejibHbiM 'compatible' Russian words which contain the elements -aöeJibHbiMAMSeJib- HbiH fall into two major categories: the serious and the not-so-serious. (Cf. the medical term HeonepáoejibHbiM 'inoperable', or uoKTopá- öeJibHbiH 'doctorable' (i.e. of a topic suitable for use as a doctoral thesis), or CMOTpMÖeJibHbiM 'worthy of being seen or viewed', 'pleas- ant to watch', 'watchable' (e.g. of a film, performance).) In the present example, as an alternative to the well-worn coBMecTMMbiii (cf. MBM- coBMecTMMbiM), we see a more original creation. BMHny3á, $ópTOHKM 'MS Windows' We have nearly reached the end of our brief analysis of Russian computer slang and are now ready to award some prizes. Third prize goes to the present entry, which combines Western and Russian tech- nological achievements. BMH.ay3á (sing. BMH.uy3) is a slick way to ren- der the concept of 'windows', whereas (pópTOMKH ('small hinged win- dow-panes used for ventilation') is a more rustic solution to the nam- ing process. MeaciiyMÓpuHe 'interface' Here is our second-prize winner, a stunning example of a caique. (Cf. standard - and unimaginative! - MHTep(j)eMC.) KpaKa3íí6jia, Macaivrôa, o6e3bflHa, coöanica, yxo 'the 'at' symbol (@y Without question, this final entry is our first-prize winner. Whe- ther through design or accident, o6e3bíÍHa, coöanica and yxo all bear a resemblance to '@'. As exotic slangisms par excellence, however, Kpaica3fl6jia and MacflMÖa receive the palm. Their etymology is a matter of the wildest possible speculation! * * * 111</page><page sequence="16">Conclusions The above somewhat lighthearted cursory look at Russian com- puter slang reveals a number of vital word-formation elements at work. It has been shown that apart from the occasional exoticism (e.g. KpaKa3fl6jia), the commonest methods utilised are (1) semantic ex- tensions of the meaning of existing words (e.g. aceJié3O); (2) native Russian formations (e.g. nepcoHáJiKa); and (3) forms based wholly or partly on a literal reading of English (e.g. xa-T3, nucniiiKa). The study of Russian computer slang, as well as many other types of Russian slang, is an eminently worthwhile and richly rewarding undertaking. Many are the treasures waiting to be revealed through a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the numerous varieties of Russian slang, and one sincerely hopes that others will be attracted to the challenge. 112</page></plain_text>
