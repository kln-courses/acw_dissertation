<plain_text><page sequence="1">HUME'S DIALOGUES CONCERNING NATURAL RELIGION B. M. LAING, M.A., D.LITT. PROFESSOR Kemp Smith in providing a new edition of Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, embodying all the author's additions and corrections, has given expression to the perennial interest and fascination which this work has possessed for many minds during the odd one hundred and fifty years since it was first published by Hume's nephew. The editor himself has performed a great service by contributing an Introduction and a clear and concise summary of the Dialogues, in both of which he expounds his own view as to how Hume's discussion is to be interpreted. Hume employs three characters-Demea, Philo, and Cleanthes; and the discussion is ostensibly reported by a youth Pamphilus, who claims to have been an onlooker at the time and who at the end sums up his impression to the following effect: "Upon a serious review of the whole, I cannot but think, that Philo's principles are more probable than Demea's; but that those of Cleanthes approach still nearer the truth." As Philo plays the role of the sceptical critic and Cleanthes that of defender of the teleological argument, the conclusion of the Dialogues suggests that Hume's sympathies are with Cleanthes, that he is to be identified with the latter, and that he thus is to be regarded as accepting the teleological view with its theistic implications. What has rendered it difficult for many students of Hume to accept this reading of the Dialogues is their apparently mainly negative character combined with the apparently sceptical nature of Hume's general philosophy. Professor Kemp Smith is one of those students and in his Introduction to, and in his summary of the argument in, the present edition he seeks to defend the interpretation that Hume and Philo are to be identified. According to his presentation of the argument the Dialogues constitute a somewhat disjointed and even curiously inconsistent piece of work, infected by a supposedly mischievous humour on the part of Hume, even, it is to be suspected, by a certain degree of insincerity. Arguments of an important character are left unanswered by Cleanthes because he seems unable to deal with them. Philo is really made to have the best of the discussion: he dominates the argument and forces Cleanthes into positions which the latter cannot defend, being reduced to simple re-assertions of his view. He is able to state even Cleanthes' views more clearly and more I75</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPHY effectively than Cleanthes himself. Some of the arguments put into the mouth of Cleanthes, as in his reply to Demea in Part IX, "sound very strangely"; and in Part X "he is made to voice against Demea those very objections which Philo has been urging against his own modes of formulating the argument from design, and the cogency of which he refuses to recognize when they are again urged against him by Philo." On the other hand, Philo at times behaves with "mischievous intent." Hume's "usual procedure" is to have as much as possible of Philo's case expounded by one of the other protagonists. The close of the discussion contains merely "the conventionally prescribed avowal" about the disabilities of reason and the need of revelation. The latter part of the Dialogues takes "a very strange and indeed bewildering turn," for Philo comes forward as the champion of the case for design and claims to believe in final causes. And Philo, it has to be remembered, is to be identified with Hume. But the obvious absurdity of the sceptic, after an admitted victorious argument, confessing to a belief in what he had been opposing requires some explanation; and either it points to a playful insincerity in Philo and a mere debating success over Cleanthes, or else it requires resort to the "artfulness" and "mischievous intent" of Hume (that is, Philo) whose object is to whittle away any important theistic significance which Philo's confession may seem to have. It is the second alternative which Professor Kemp Smith emphasizes. Consequently in his opinion the outcome of the Dialogues is, firstly, more sheerly negative than is usually supposed, and, secondly, the conviction that Hume consciously and deliberately set out to undermine the religious hypothesis. The resort to Hume's "artfulness" admittedly has support in a statement made by himself in a letter to Adam Smith (August I5, 1776) where he says that "nothing can be more artfully written." In what sense Hume's use of the word "artful" is to be understood is a debatable point. The context points to the effect which the fears and hesitations affecting his friends had upon him. Hume recognizes, as clearly appears from a letter to Strahan (June 8, 1776), that the topics advanced by Philo in the course of the argument are "out of the Common Road" and will give umbrage; and there too he definitely states that "he introduces a Sceptic, who is indeed refuted, and at last gives up the Argument, nay confesses that he was only amusing himself by all his Cavils." Either this statement must be regarded as another bit of egregious "artfulness," with the consequence that the Dialogues as well as Hume's other philosophical writings have to be considered as all a playful jest, or else it must be taken in all seriousness as expressing what Hume believed the Dialogues to be, with the consequence that he quite clearly identifies 176</page><page sequence="3">HUME'S DIALOGUES CONCERNING NATURAL RELIGION himself with Cleanthes. That the statement of the case for scepticism, which is upheld by Philo, required careful handling in the super- charged religious atmosphere of the eighteenth century must be acknowledged. It was only too easy to formulate the sceptical position in an arrogant and offensive form. Hume's caution and "artfulness," if the latter is to be given a meaning other than skill shown in literary presentation and in developing the opposing views, requires no other interpretation than this-that he recognized, aided no doubt by the observed reactions of his friends, that he was treating a subject apt to provoke strong feeling and that it was incumbent upon him to write within the canons of good taste. Somehow a sort of tradition, much like that about Voltaire, has arisen that Hume wrote with his tongue in his cheek and that any avowal of religious faith is but a cloak which merely serves his purpose of delivering surreptitious but deadly blows at religion. Professor Kemp Smith, for instance, considers that in the Dialogues Hume is deliberately and consciously undermining the religious hypothesis. Two points must be mentioned in reply to this contention. In the first place, the Dialogues are concerned purely with Natural Religion, and even for a very large section of orthodox divines in the eighteenth century the arguments of Natural Religion were a sort of heretical argument; and the deliberate exposure of their weakness, an exposure even ending in scepticism so far as that line of reasoning was concerned, would have caused no dismay, in fact would have met with approval, for it would have left their own position untouched, if not strengthened. In the second place, Professor Kemp Smith's assertion is made in face of Hume's express declaration in a letter to Sir Gilbert Elliot that "any Propensity you imagine I have to the other side (that is, in favour of the sceptical views of Philo) crept in upon me against my will," and in face of a definite request for assistance in strengthening the case of Cleanthes who, he says, is made the hero of the Dialogues. Unless this letter is to be regarded as another piece of artfulness, it is impossible to admit Professor Kemp Smith's assertion. Those who take the view that the Dialogues, not merely in tendency but in intention, are sceptical lay stress upon at least two points. In the first place, one of the strongest supports in favour of such an interpretation is that Hume's general philosophy necessitates it. That philosophy is held to be essentially sceptical. Yet Hume himself in a footnote to Section XIV of Part III of the Treatise, where he is discussing the idea of necessary connection, writes: "The same imperfection attends our ideas of the Deity; but this can have no effect either on religion or morals. The order of the universe proves an omnipotent mind; that is, a mind whose will is constantly attended with the obedience of every creature and being. Nothing M 177</page><page sequence="4">PHILOSOPHY more is requisite to give a foundation to all the articles of religion." This passage is clear evidence that Hume, whatever interpretation the philosophical public may put and may have put upon his theory, did not consider that that theory was inconsistent with an acceptance of the teleological argument; and it requires convincing evidence that he at any later time came to reject it. It rules out once more the suggestion that Hume was in temperament and in intention a sceptic. What alone could be legitimately maintained-what is quite a different thing-is that, whatever Hume himself may have thought, his views, including the discussion in the Dialogues, lead, when carefully examined, to sceptical results. In the second place, stress may be laid, as by Professor Kemp Smith, upon the weakness of Cleanthes' defence-a weakness which stands out prominently in spite of Hume's efforts to cover it up. This weakness must here be taken to be a matter of logically defective argument and not merely one of artful touches for or against Cleanthes, since Philo too is represented as being once at a loss in face of Cleanthes' argument and is also made to confess how great an effort was required of him to meet his opponent's view. Cleanthes, it is pointed out, seems, apart from the statement of his thesis, to be singularly lacking in argument and in ability to refute his opponent, he simply repeats his doctrine and is reduced in the end practically to silence. On the other hand, it is fair to point out that he is represented as treating Philo's objections as arbitrary and frivolous, in fact as simply irrelevant, as refusing to admit the conclusions which Philo puts forward as drawn from his hypothesis, as declaring that he sees in general the fallacy and error of Philo's arguments, although he does not state these fallacies and errors, as finding that the vulgar theology with its injudicious reasoning has given Philo too just a handle for his attitude of ridicule. Are all these features so much artfulness on the part of Hume and really designed to insinuate in the mind of the reader a belief in the weakness and untenability of the teleological argument? Is the argument, then, of Cleanthes as weak as Professor Kemp Smith suggests and has Philo the best of it? Or is there some foundation for Cleanthes' contention that Philo's arguments are arbitrary and irrelevant and directed too much upon the "injudicious reasoning" of the ordinary theologians? The views expounded by Philo are stated in terms which are rejected by Hume in his general philosophy. They assume a clear and precise distinction between mind and matter which Hume's philosophy denies. Philo uses the notion of "actuating force" several times; he speaks in terms of productive power or energy which Hume has elsewhere ruled out- expressly in the footnote in Part III of the Treatise to which reference has already been made. The arguments at these points is non- 178</page><page sequence="5">HUME'S DIALOGUES CONCERNING NATURAL RELIGION Humean because pre-Humean. It is true that Cleanthes in replying to Demea in Part IX seems to use an argument which involves a distinction between mind and matter. This is one of the arguments which Professor Kemp Smith thinks "sounds very strangely in the mouth of Cleanthes." But Cleanthes is here not maintaining any positive doctrine involving and requiring any such distinction; he is concerned purely with the refutation of Demea's theory, and, within the limits of that "pretended explication of necessity" asserted by Demea, he seeks to show that Demea has not proved that the "necessary existent" is the Deity, since matter may equally well be that necessary existent. But Cleanthes goes on in the same passage to point out that the same argument used to rule out matter as the necessary existent can be with equal justification used against the conclusion that the Deity is that existent; and his contention rests upon the inability of the human mind to make any clear distinction between mind and matter. The rejection of the term "necessary existence" by Cleanthes because it has no meaning is thoroughly Humean, the word "necessary" (if we may assume an interpretation of Hume's general philosophy here) having only an epistemological, not an ontological, significance. The views which Philo puts forward can have justification only on one ground, namely that they are serious alternatives to the thesis put forward by Cleanthes; and to be serious alternatives they must have a certain degree of intelligibility and of probability in themselves. To ensure the rejection of the teleological argument they must have a probability greater than that of the former. This must be the case with each alternative theory. Cleanthes protests against Philo's faculty of invention and declares its futility; in this he is justified, for Philo by piling up one possibility on top of another is relying for the refutation of Cleanthes upon the total effect of these various possibilities, when, as a matter of fact, each doctrine must be considered by itself and when the total effect is no greater than that of the one possessed of the greatest probability. The issue of the Dialogues is essentially reducible to the question whether the teleo- logical argument is inherently intelligible and probable, and whether any other alternative with equal intelligibility and with equal or more probability can be formulated. The three characters in the Dialogues stand for three different, though at points over-lapping, standpoints. Demea represents the view that there is a Divine Being who is Creator of the universe but who is so far different from human nature and from anything in human experience that his nature is mysterious and incomprehensible; it is the view of those orthodox believers who stand by a supernatural revelation, and for whom a philosophical discussion about the Divine nature is absurd, indeed blasphemous. Philo's attitude is somewhat complex; I79</page><page sequence="6">PHILOSOPHY he cannot as a sceptic assert that there is no Divine Being; yet at times he argues that there is evidence in support of such a view; at times he agrees with Demea that the Divine nature is not knowable because of its incomprehensibility; at other times he argues that we cannot be certain whether there is or is not a Divine Being. Cleanthes holds that the Divine nature is to some extent knowable and know- able to an extent that is really requisite for human purposes; and, while Philo makes no attempt to assess the probabilities of the various ideas he puts forward and to consider whether there is a decisive probability in favour of one against his opponent's position, being content to insist upon the conflict of evidence and the need of suspense of judgment, Cleanthes contends that, according to the ordinary rules of evidence accepted even by the sceptic in other matters, the balance turns in his favour. These considerations suggest that not only is it not beyond question that Philo has the best of the argument but also that the Dialogues can in a very fundamental way be regarded not as an expression of a personal attitude on the part of Hume, in which case his relation to Calvinism and to religion becomes a somewhat irrelevant matter, but as a discussion on evidence, just as the Essay on Miracles is essentially a discussion on evidence, religious issues being employed as a medium for a detached examination of logical issues. It is clear from Hume's correspondence relative to the Dialogues that he felt the weight of the evidence to be such as to create difficulties for the traditional religious views; and there arises an important question regarding the significance of the scepticism maintained by Philo and the teleological position main- tained by Cleanthes. Hume in his correspondence is seen to be struggling honestly and seriously with a religious problem, which there is reason to believe arose for him through acquaintance with critical theories affecting religious beliefs. It is an analogous prob- lem with which he deals in his general philosophy. What requires to be emphasized in regard to the Dialogues is that many, if not all, of the views put into the mouth of Philo are not original but borrowed. Professor Kemp Smith recognizes that one large portion is borrowed from Bayle on Strato's atheism. The presence of evil in the world, which is the subject of discussion in the latter part of the Dialogues, was a matter that received attention from many writers before and at the time of Hume, and the substance of that latter part is to be found in some of Voltaire's writings, published long before the Dialogues and while Hume, according to Professor Kemp Smith's 1 The reference is to the lldments de la Philosophie de Newton (I738), Traitd de Mdtaphysique (I734), Le Desastre de Lisbonne (1756). There are many similarities of phrasing in the two writers, e.g. light is anatomized, (which I have been unable to trace in Newton). I80</page><page sequence="7">HUME'S DIALOGUES CONCERNING NATURAL RELIGION view of the chronology of that work, was probably writing it. Voltaire even formulated the arguments for and against the teleo- logical theory. The relevance of this fact is that, if Hume is to be identified with Philo, he and his Dialogues cease to have any importance as an original contribution to the problem of Natural Religion. All that he has done is to expound scepticism in the literary form of dialogue and thereby to give the discussion a certain dramatic interest. But otherwise he has simply collected and repeated arguments which had been often stated previously. If the Dialogues are to be or deserve to be rescued from this insignificance, it is necessary to look to the position maintained by Cleanthes, however imperfectly developed that position may be. The discussion on evidence is concerned with the validity and value of the teleological argument based on analogy. Two main difficulties are brought forward: first, one connected with the use of the causal principle; second, one connected with the terms of the analogy, whether a machine of human contrivance is the most suitable term or one that need be used and whether mind is the only possible cause. Philo is made the spokesman of these objections. Causal inference rests upon a species of effect which in experience we have found to proceed from that species of cause. In order that a causal inference may be possible the universe must come under a species of effect which has always been found to proceed from a species of cause. But the universe is, or at any rate may be, so far as the evidence goes, something unique, and hence the requisite basis for an inference as to its cause is lacking. Because of this, room is left open for the admission of other possible causes and other possible effects to which the world may be compared. The world need not be compared to a work of art; it may with just as much justification be considered to be similar to an animal or a vegetable. Mind is not the only possible cause of order; matter itself may contain an internal principle of order; the cause may be rather of the nature of generation or organization than of the nature of mind. The objection based on the nature of causal inference is discussed elsewhere in Hume's writings.I In Section IX of the Enquiry Hume lays down the principle that "all our reasonings concerning matter of fact are founded on a species of Analogy," and he draws attention to the part played by sameness and similarity of causes and effects. In Section XI he recognizes the importance of a species of cause and a species of effect, for if something were claimed to be an effect and were entirely singular, any inference as to its cause would be impossible-a view which is relevant, of course, to the question of miracles, for miracles are often singular or unique events. But X Enquiry, Sect. xi. I8i</page><page sequence="8">PHILOSOPHY at the end of this section Hume's words can be read to the effect that a denial of any other possibility is not intended but that some other avenue may be still open. Hume leaves it to the Epicurean "to pursue the consequences" of the principle enunciated, and observes that, since the opponents of Epicurus always assume the universe to be unique in its kind and the Deity, its cause, also to be unique, the Epicurean's reasonings upon that supposition "seem at least, to merit our attention." Cleanthes in the Dialogues rejects the view that the existence of any Being-for that is a matter of fact-can be proved and explicitly takes his stand upon the argument from analogy with the success or failure of which religion itself stands or falls. It might be noted that this issue has a topical interest in view of the contention of Logical Positivists that proposi- tions about God have no meaning because they are not verifiable. How does Cleanthes fare under Philo's criticisms? Emphasis is put upon the uniqueness of the universe and upon the consequent possibility of other causes than mind. Objection is taken not merely to the adequacy of a comparison of the universe to a human work of art but to the need of such a comparison. There are possible analogies, such as an animal or vegetable, besides a machine. Professor Kemp Smith, on the basis of a fundamental distinction between artificial products and organisms, argues in a long comment that the distinction invalidates Cleanthes' attempt to illustrate their self-evident similarity. Philo's criticism assumes this supposed contrast between a machine and an organism, and he is represented as making the utmost use of the idea of an organism to overthrow Cleanthes' position. Though it is he who elaborates the comparison of the universe to an animal and Cleanthes is repre- sented as not having thought of this form of analogy, admitted to be a "pretty natural one," yet it is Cleanthes who first makes reference in Part III to animals, but in a respect different from Philo; and the difference serves to bring out an important feature of Cleanthes' theory. It is a feature that is inherent in Hume's general philosophy, the nature of which has been too much obscured by a preoccupation with the doctrine of causation as invariable sequence conjoined with custom, generating expectation and for the elucidation of which the Dialogues make an essential contribution. Philo in his discussion of the analogy of an organism lays stress upon organization in the sense of activity, energy, power, as the source of order; and Professor Kemp Smith, in his use of such terms as "self-organizing," "self-maintaining," "self-regulating," and so on, seems to accept a similar view. Such terms are ruled out by HIume's general philosophy from any intelligible account of phenomena; and they are not used nor accepted by Cleanthes in the Dialogues. He is insisting upon the fact of order itself; organ- I82</page><page sequence="9">HUME'S DIALOGUES CONCERNING NATURAL RELIGION ization is for him order. In the sense of power or activity it is simply an unknown x or occult quality, incapable of providing any basis for analogy. Prima facie, machines, animals, vegetables, are very different from each other, and are also very different from minds. Hence there are dissimilitudes which constitute a grave difficulty. But there is one feature in which all agree, namely order. When Cleanthes in stating his argument makes use of the term "machine," it is order of which he is thinking; when he refers to an animal, it is the "anatomy" that he mentions; when he speaks of light, it is the word "anatomy" that he uses, and in using it he intends to emphasize structure and order. The illustrations employed by Cleanthes in Part III and considered by Professor Kemp Smith to be bewildering, irrelevant, and misleading are a failure only if stress is laid upon the idea of propagation or upon the instances only as facts, but are significant when it is kept in mind that Cleanthes wishes to draw attention to order-exemplified in his special illustration by wisdom and coherence. Everywhere order is being discovered; the more science advances, the more does it come upon order. Philo argues in terms of causes of order or of organization, for instance in animals, and suggests that the cause may not and need not be mind. This form of argument is from Hume's point of view a traditional one because it employs traditional terms and concepts. It leads Philo to argue that a tree is the cause of a tree or an animal is the cause of an animal; and it leads him also to press Cleanthes as to the cause of mind and hence of the Divine Mind-a procedure against which the latter protests and which, it is pointed out, always presupposes order and does not explain it. On this interpretation of Cleanthes' argument the difficulty based on the requirement that causal inference rests upon a species of cause and a species of effect is removed, for Cleanthes accepts too the Humean doctrine that mind is to be understood and is known only as an order or system. One important and significant feature of Hume's philosophy, often overlooked, is that it annuls so far as scientific investigation and knowledge are concerned the hard and fast distinction between machines and organisms and between mechanism and teleology, and forestalls the later controversy of mechanism versus vitalism or teleology by seeking a common and universal notion in that of order, system, or organization. When Hume himself spoke of the mind as a mechanism he did not consider it necessary to compare it to or to regard it as an engine or a pump. He was among the first, if not the first, of modern philosophers to draw attention to relations and to the problem of knowledge as a problem of relations. Whenever the human mind investigates nature, it always comes upon relations or upon structure. 183</page><page sequence="10">PHILOSOPHY "Light is in reality anatomized," says Cleanthes in the Dialogues. "Would not a man be ridiculous who pretended to reject Newton's explication of the wonderful phenomenon of the rainbow, because that explication gives a minute anatomy of the rays of light." In the Treatise where he deals with the question of personal identity he discusses this issue in a way which annuls any fundamental distinction between the productions of nature and the works of art as well as between these and minds. When a machine is investi- gated what are discovered are relations between the parts-"a reference of the parts to each other, and a combination to some common end or purpose." In the case of animals and vegetables the parts bear to each other reciprocal relations of cause and effect; they have a mutual dependence on, and a connection with each other, as well as having a reference to some general purpose. The intellect explains or understands a machine, just as it does an animal or vegetable, when it discovers its structure or system of relations. This applies equally to minds; the intellect never discovers a self-that is, a simple, unchanging entity or substance; it comes upon only a system of "perceptions," a system which Hume, in order to elucidate his view, compares to a republic. To try to get behind structure, system, or order, as Philo suggests in his argument is on such a Humean doctrine absurd; and Cleanthes in the Dialogues voices this absurdity when he is asked to account for the cause of the Whole itself. "Did I show you the particular causes of each individual in a collection of twenty particles of matter, I should think it very unreasonable, should you afterwards ask me what was the cause of the whole twenty. This is sufficiently explained in explaining the cause of the parts." It leads him also to point out that Philo's argument presupposes order or system and is not accounting for it; for though, as Philo maintains, there is a sense in which a tree is the cause of a tree and an animal the cause of an animal, this does not affect Cleanthes' contention since, in terms of Hume's philosophy, a tree or an animal is to be understood as an order or system, and this order is being all the time assumed. The conclusion, therefore, to be drawn from a more detailed examination of the discussion is that there is no need to admit that Philo has the better of the argument, since on this interpretation of Hume and Cleanthes, his contentions are mainly irrelevant and have importance only when the whole matter is treated on traditional, that is non-Humean, lines. It is known from Hume's correspondence that he was aware of a difficulty due to the "dissimilitudes" or dissimilarities-a difficulty which Cleanthes recognizes; but he does not allow this to be a decisive factor in the argument. The various systems, including mind, have a fundamental similarity. How then on this basis does the principle of analogy apply ? 184</page><page sequence="11">HUME'S DIALOGUES CONCERNING NATURAL RELIGION A consideration of this question necessitates a reference to the nature of analogy as Hume understood it. In the TreatiseI he gives a narrower interpretation of analogy which is a form of reasoning based upon a specific degree of resemblance between cases. In the Enquiry2 he gives a wider meaning to it, for it is now regarded as equivalent to inductive inference or as covering the whole field of probability instead of being "one species of probability"; and in this respect he is in alignment with certain continental writers of the eighteenth century.3 The difference between the two interpre- tations of analogy is that in the former case the inference is to a specific cause or effect and in the latter case to a general proposition or to a wider uniformity. There is no clear and fundamental distinction between the two, for by the analogical procedure in the narrower sense the known uniformity is having its range widened and the way is being opened for a more extensive generalization. On Hume's principles there is no guarantee that any such generaliza- tion will necessarily be true. Any generalization is experimental. The difference between scientific generalization and the generaliza- tions4 made by plain people in ordinary life lies in the fact that the scientist working under the guidance of rules elaborated in accordance with experience gained in the experimental investigation of nature exercises precautions and gauges the degree of probability according to the observed evidence and the character of the properties in respect of which bodies are similar. In this, too, Hume is in line with continental writers who otherwise differ regarding the foundations of their theory; but both agree in declaring that insight into nature, though not obtained by way of demonstration as exemplified in geometry, has none the less a kind of certainty of its own. One objection urged by Philo against the argument by analogy is expressed in the question whether, supposing order to be admitted throughout the universe, such order is evidence of mind as the cause. Philo wants to argue back to a cause of order, and in doing so is thinking conformably to the traditional view and to Hume's more limited meaning of the nature of analogy. The characteristic order of a machine is due to mind; hence the order of the universe, which is similar to that of a machine, is due to mind. The existence and nature of a Divine Mind are thus inferred from similarity of effects and causes. It is inferred from the order observed in nature. I Part III, Sect. xii (at end). 2 Sect. ix. 3 e.g. S'Gravesende in his essay Sur l'evidence. 4 Cleanthes in the Dialogues (Part I) says: In vain would the sceptic make a distinction between science and common life, or between one science and another. The arguments employed in all, if just, are of a similar nature, and contain the same force and evidence. 185</page><page sequence="12">PHILOSOPHY The tendency of this view is to regard the Divine Mind as something remote from the human mind; it is the attitude favoured by Deism and makes the Deity "an abstract, invisible object" as Hume elsewhere says. Cleanthes, however, in the Dialogues proceeds to maintain another position,' which Professor Kemp Smith holds to be inconsistent with the preceding argument which put emphasis on inference. It has to be admitted that there seems an inconsistency. This other position is that the belief in a Divine Mind immediately flows in upon one with a force like that of sensation; that is, the Divine Mind is not inferred from but is immediately apprehended in the order of nature. The view implies that the human mind is in direct contact with the Divine Nature, and it is the view accepted later even by Philo. It is this second view which agrees most closely with Hume's other theories, especially his theory of mind as a system. The transition in the Dialogues is accompanied by a change in the way of looking at the various instances of order in the universe, for they are spoken of no longer as merely effects of mind but as "the image of mind reflected on us from innumerable objects." These are the words of Cleanthes. The first form of the argument involves a distinction between mind and order which is not consistent with Hume's point of view. For him, as for Cleanthes, mind is order of a certain kind, so far as mind is known at all, and that is the only way in which we can intelligently, and are entitled to, speak of mind. When emphasis is once put upon this idea, and a mind and a machine, as well as organisms, are considered as structures or systems, a machine is not merely an effect but is an effect that has a similarity to its cause. That such similarity exists between causes and effects is implied even on the ordinary view that trees are the causes of trees or animals of animals. Consequently, machines may be said to have a mental character, even that they have a mind-no doubt of a simple and rudimentary nature but none the less a mind-provided that Hume's theory of mind is remembered. For the purposes of the teleological argument, which is essentially an affair of reasoning, the relation of machines to mind has to be considered in order to justify the use of the word mind in respect of the type of order in question.z This makes the argument one by I This form of the argument has a likeness to Voltaire's statement of the teleological view. The arrangements in nature "font une demonstration qui, a force d'6tre sensible, en est presque m6prisee par quelques philosophes" (llements de la Philosophie de Newton, I, Ch. i). Cf. other passages, "Je ne sais . . . . si jamais il y a eu un plus bel argument que cet verset: Coeli enarrant gloriam Dei." 2 In the eighteenth century it is probable that order and design were not two distinct ideas. In a footnote to Le Ddsastre de Lisbonne (vers. 75) Voltaire expresses a view concerning the order of the universe, which, according to i86</page><page sequence="13">HUME'S DIALOGUES CONCERNING NATURAL RELIGION analogy in the narrower sense; and the argument is easily trans- formed into analogy in the wider sense in the form of a generaliza- tion expressing a world-wide uniformity. But any argument of this kind is only an attempt to elucidate and justify by means of reason what is a prior experience of a direct kind with an all-pervasive order of the nature of mind. Philo admits later that, in dealing with Cleanthes' theory, he has needed all his metaphysical and sceptical subtlety to elude his grasp, but he adopts a triumphant note when he comes to discuss how the teleological view, based on experience and observation, can establish the moral attributes of the Divine Being. This issue, introduced by Demea, is recognized by Cleanthes as a crucial one, for the answer will determine whether there is to be "an end at once of all religion," and that answer is made to turn again upon whether mankind can be proved unhappy or corrupted. The issue is not discussed really very fully. It is one, however, which confronts not merely teleologists but all religious views; it troubled philo- sophers and theologians in the eighteenth century particularly because the difficulties seemed so favourable to scepticism. Cleanthes is giving expression to this fact in admitting that Philo has now fallen upon a subject worthy of his "noble spirit of opposition and controversy." He openly admits that the only way in which the moral attributes of the Deity--and he is prepared to adopt this way-can be defended is "to deny absolutely the misery and wickedness of man"; but even discounting much of the exaggerated account of Philo regarding human suffering he is still constrained to recognize that there is evil. In face of this fact the view which he ventures to suggest-a new theory he calls it-is that of a "finitely perfect Deity," "benevolence, regulated by wisdom, and limited by necessity." The conclusion which Philo on the other hand would draw is that the ultimate principle of the universe is morally neutral or indifferent. The theory of a finite Deity is in accordance with the whole of Cleanthes' preceding argument; and the rejection of the idea of infinity is in line with Hume's general philosophical principles. That danger lies in the obscurity and the vagueness of the termin- ology used in reference to the Deity is suggested at more than one point of the Dialogues, and Cleanthes prefaces his theory of a finite Deity with remarks to this effect. The difficulty, however, confronting the teleological view in respect of the moral issue is a serious one, and there is evidence in Hume's correspondence with Hutcheson the Avertissement, was interpreted to signify that "this word order applied to nature is void of sense, unless it signifies an arrangement of which we apprehend the regularity and design."

The difficulty, which is noted also by Voltaire, is one concerning the ontological status of moral principles. If the latter are interpreted, as Hume inter- preted them, in such a way as to make them relative to human nature or needs and subject to the varying circumstances in which human life has to be organized; if, for instance, justice is to be considered mainly in reference to the human institution of property and moral qualities generally in terms of utility, then there is no evidence that moral designations are applicable to the Deity or to any beings superior to, or even other than, man. Consequently, the basis of any analogical argument is lacking. Nevertheless it is possible to find in the idea of utility a means of transition from human life to the universe and a means of giving significance to Cleanthes' theory of a finitely perfect Deity. The question at issue at this stage is not that of the existence of a Divine Mind but of his moral nature. The theory of a finitely perfect Deity only requires that the Divine Being tend on the whole to promote the happiness of mankind. This does not rule out suffering, but it does assume a particular meaning of morality and goodness and it does require the admission, made by Cleanthes, that happiness predominates over the misery of mankind. The assumption may be wrong and Cleanthes' admission may be unverifiable; but within these limits the foundations for analogy exist. The conclusion is obviously not, so far as words at least are concerned, what orthodoxy requires. But no claim can be made that Cleanthes is arguing on behalf of orthodoxy,I the representative of which, if any one is, is Demea. The whole issue is one regarding the extent to which reason, dealing with the evidence obtainable by means of experience and observation, will give support to the beliefs characteristic of the religious attitude; and of course the meaning to be given to the terms of such beliefs must be fixed also in accordance with that evidence. Apart, however, from this question about the lack of clearness and precision in the terms occur- ring in religious discussion, it is obvious that Cleanthes is far from orthodox and has given a new turn to the teleological theory. He is well aware of this; his concluding doctrine about a finitely perfect Deity is put forward with the statement that "if it deserve our attention, we may afterwards, at more leisure, reduce it into form." The final estimate of the Dialogues must of course depend in part on the interpretation of Hume's attitude to scepticism, in favour of which, according to Professor Kemp Smith, he deliber- 1 Cleanthes' anthropomorphism can hardly be objectionable to an orthodoxy which holds that God created man in His own image, for, if so, man has a likeness to the Divine Nature. His theory is labelled experimental theism (Part V) and contrasted with the true system of theism. 188</page><page sequence="15">HUME'S DIALOGUES CONCERNING NATURAL RELIGION ately and often with concealed and malicious intent argues. In order that such an interpretation in respect of the Dialogues may be successfully maintained, the representation of Philo the sceptic expressing his belief in the value of the teleological argument at the end of the discussion has to be understood as a subtle or "artful" manner of depriving the view of any serious significance. But the change-over on the part of Philo is not merely peculiar; it is a very inartistic device on the part of Hume, too glaring in its inconsistency to be considered even subtle or artful; and although Philo's attitude becomes nominally that of Cleanthes, there remain considerable differences between them regarding such matters as the foundation of religion, the part played by religion in life, and the relation between religion as a practical attitude in life and the intellectual interpretation of this attitude. The references to light and its anatomization suggest the view that, just as the scientist may analyse the seeing eye and light into structures and does not thereby annul the fact that the eye sees white light, which is an experience connected with a synthetic power characteristic of the eye, so analysis does not destroy the fact that human nature may be so constituted as to be religious or to view the world in a religious way. Herein there may be found an overlooked significance of Hume's Natural History of Religion which seeks to show that the religious attitude is universal, and herein too is found a reason for Cleanthes' insistence upon the universal influence of religion. Hume's references to religion elsewhere in his writings give no hint of any rejection of religion, though he gives many hints about his questioning theories of religion. The final representation of Philo is quite consis- tent with much that Hume says concerning the inability of the sceptic to adhere a l'outrance to his own doctrine, and it can be regarded as an artistic portrayal of such an attitude on Hume's part towards scepticism. The critical and destructive side of Hume has been so much empha- sized historically that the constructive pioneer, possibly because the construction is not of great magnitude, has been ignored. In the Dialogues the arguments of Philo are somewhat stale and hackneyed so far as the eighteenth century is concerned. It is the views put forward by Cleanthes, no doubt in very undeveloped form, that are of real interest and of philosophical value, however dangerous and heretical they may be from the point of view of the orthodox. Cleanthes' denial of the simplicity of the Divine Being, his acceptance of that mind as a system, in the sense in which Hume considers the human mind to be a system, his assertion of the finitude of the Deity carry with them the temporalizing of the Deity. These are the consequences of the application of Hume's philosophical ideas to religion. The precise historical significance of this re-inter- I89</page><page sequence="16">PHILOSOPHY pretation of teleology, as distinct from the philosophical validity of such a re-interpretation, would require an acquaintance with, and an examination of, the conflict of certain ideas in the eighteenth century. For the present it must suffice to mention a recent work by Professor A. O. Lovejoy on The Great Chain of Being, in which he points out, though Hume is not mentioned at all, that such ideas as have just been stated in connection with Cleanthes came to be put forward in the eighteenth century. 9go</page></plain_text>
