During this period, an international team undertook topographic, archaeological and geophysical surveys, together with artefact studies and analyses, aimed at determining the nature and extent of occupation at the site, and offering new data about the settlement history and material culture of this region in pre Classical times. The results of this work suggest that the site was occupied from at least the fourth millennium (Late Chalcolithic) to the middle of the sixth century BC, a date that coincides with the Persian conquest of Lycia, with only scant evidence of use/occupation after this phase. In addition, the nature of our finds suggests that the site, despite its location in the summer pastures (yayla) and at a considerable altitude (1,250m), was well-connected to other Anatolian and Aegean regions, and probably served as more than just a minor seasonal agro-pastoral settlement, particularly during its Early Bronze Age and Late Iron Age periods of occupation. The evidence relevant to the second millennium BC is too limited at present to allow further interpretation about the nature of occupation at the site, but is significant per se, especially in view of the scanty archaeological remains of this period in the region, and despite the numerous references to the Lukka people and settlements available in documentary sources. Özet Bu rapor, güneybati Türkiye'de, kuzey Likya'da bulunan Çaltilar Höyük'de 2008-2010 yillan arasinda yapilan araçtirma faaliyetlerinin ana sonuçlarmi kapsamaktadir. Bu sûre içinde, uluslararasi bir ekip, yerleçimin niteligini ve kapsamim belirlemek ve bu bölgenin Klasik dönem öncesindeki yerleçim tarihi ve maddi kültürü hakkinda yeni bilgiler elde etmek amaciyla, buluntu çaliçmalari ve analizler yamnda, topografik, arkeolojik ve jeofizik araçtirmalarda bulunmuçtur. Bu çaliçmanin sonuçlarina göre, yerleçim yeri, en azindan dördüncii binden baçlayarak (Geç Kalkolitik) M.Ö. 6. yy'in ortalarma kadar (Pers içgaline rastlayan dönem) iskan edilmiçtir, fakat bu dönemden sonrasi kullamm veya iskan için yeterli kanitlar mevcut degildir. Buna ek olarak, buluntularm niteligi bakimmdan; yazlik meralarda (yayla) kurulmuç ve önemli bir yükseklige sahip olan (1,250m) konumuna ragmen, yerleçim yerinin diger Anadolu ve Ege bölgeleriyle baglantili oldugu ve özellikle Erken Tunç Çagi ve Geç Demir Çaglarmda büyük ihtimalle, sadeee kûçiik bir mevsimlik tanm alam olmaktan daha fazlasim sundugu söylenebilir. M.Ö. ikinci bine ait kanitlar bu dönem için yerleçimin niteligi açisindan daha fazla açiklama yapmamiza çu an imkan vermeyecek kadar simrhdir, fakat yazili kaynaklarda Lukka halkma ve yerleçimine pek çok referans verildigi halde, özellikle de bölgede bu döneme ait arkeolojik kalintilann yetersizligi göz önüne alindigmda kendi baçina önemlidir. 61</page><page sequence="2">Anatolian Studies 2011 This report presents the main results relating to some of the research activities carried out at Çaltilar Höyük in the summers of 2008, 2009 and 2010, as part of a collab orative project between various UK, Turkish, German and Canadian institutions. These activities aimed at providing new data concerning the material culture and settlement history of pre-Classical southwest Anatolia - data that, in turn, could help to facilitate a better understanding of the role of this area within the wider Aegean/Anatolian/ eastern Mediterranean regions and to answer other research questions as discussed in more detail below. Çaltilar Höyük is primarily a pre-Classical site, adjacent to the eponymous modern village, in the district of Fethiye and Mugla province (figs 1-3). It is situated in the upper reaches of the Xanthus river system (the modern Koca or Eçen Çay), in the summer pasture region, known in Turkish as yayla, at an altitude of ca 1,250m above sea level. It is also located near the ancient cities of Oenoanda and Balboura (about 15km northeast from the former and 10km southeast from the latter). This is an area that, before the Romans, belonged to a region referred to as Kabalia, whereas in Roman times it was part of northern Lycia (Coulton 1993; 1998: 226; forthcoming a). This region may previously have been part of the lands of Lukka mentioned in Hittite texts and other sources of the second millennium BC - a territory that recent scholarship locates in an area corresponding to and extending beyond Graeco-Roman Lycia and associates, in particular, with some settlements in the Xanthus valley (for example, Mellink 1995; Hawkins 1998; Niemeier 1999; Raimond 2004; Bryce 2005; 2006; Collins 2007). The site was first investigated in 1988 by the Balboura Survey, directed by J.J. Coulton, whose preliminary reports suggested a long sequence of occupation, as indicated by the presence of archaeological materials dated to the early first (eighth and seventh centuries), third and fourth millennia BC, with little if any evidence of the site being encumbered by Classical and later remains, but also an apparent gap in use/occupation during the second millennium BC (Coulton 1989; 1992; 1998). This gap, however, has now been filled by our work (for example, Momigliano et al. 2008; 2010a; 2010b; and below) and by subsequent study of the material collected by the Balboura Survey team (French forthcoming). Fig. 1. Locations of Çaltilar, other main sites and modern towns mentioned in the text 62</page><page sequence="3">Momigliano, Greaves, Hodos, Aksoy, Brown, Kibaroglu and Carter Fig. 2. Google Earth view of the site and village Lycia is well known for its impressive Graeco-Roman funerary monuments and settlements, including the afore mentioned Balboura and Oenoanda in the uplands and Xanthus and Patara near the coast, all of which were members of the early Roman Lycian League (Strabo Geography 14.3.2-3, 13.4.17). This region occupies an important geographical position between the Aegean, the eastern Mediterranean and inland Anatolia through to the modern Turkish 'Lake District' province of Burdur. The maritime routes that followed Lycia's shores and linked the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean have yielded spectacular Bronze Age shipwrecks at Gelidonia and Uluburun (Bass et al. 1967; Pulak 1998; Bachhuber 2006). This region is also situated between the second millennium BC literate societies of the Hittites of central Anatolia, and the Minoans and Mycenaeans of the Aegean, and various documentary sources refer to this area in pre-Classical times. For example, Hittite, Egyptian and Ugaritic texts of the second millennium BC mention the people of the land of Lukka. The Hittite sources in particular refer to a number of towns in this region that can be identified with sites along or near the Xanthus river, including Patara, Dalawa (Tlos) and Wiyanawanda (Bryce 1986; Raimond 2004; Collins 2007: 69). The latter has often been identified with later Greek Oenoanda, although the earliest archaeological evidence for settlement here is Hellenistic in date and the site has yielded no Late Bronze Age remains as yet (Coulton 1982: 121 with references; see also Coulton 1998). However, Early Bronze Age remains have been found a few miles away at Eceler Höyük, near the modern town of Seki (Aksoy, Köse 2005). In the early first millennium BC, Homer refers to the Lycian heroes Sarpedon and Glaukos as allies of the Trojans (for example, Iliad 2.876 77, 6.150-211, 224-25), while Herodotus later connects an older Sarpedon, the brother of king Minos, with the colonisation of this region by Cretans (Histories 1.173; see also Durnford 2008). 63</page><page sequence="4">Anatolian Studies 2011 Fig. 3. Aerial view of the site and village from the south Despite the relatively rich evidence from shipwrecks and texts, very little is known about the actual settlements and material culture of pre-Classical Lycia, especially for the second and early first millennia BC, which are the most crucial for contextualising these written sources and providing some background to the later formation of Graeco-Roman polities in the region. In fact, the lack of second millennium remains is one of the main reasons why some scholars have proposed that the Lukka people lived under semi-nomadic conditions (Singer 1983: 208; Bryce 2005: 54). There is, however, growing evidence to suggest that the scarcity of pre-Classical remains has been exaggerated, and may not be the result of wandering tribes but rather due, at least in part, to the fact that this region of southwest Turkey has remained largely under-investigated, especially for the Middle/Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages (Yakar 2000: 359-63; Momigliano, Aksoy forthcoming). For example, evidence of Middle Bronze Age occupation has been found in the Elmali plain (the adjacent valley to the east of Çaltilar and separated from it by the 2,505m high Elmali Dag) at Karataç-Semahôyiik and Hacimusalar (Mellink 1985; 1995; Özgen personal communication), as well as in the nearby Burdur-Antalya region, at Bademagaci Höyük (Umurtak 2003). In addition, Late Bronze Age ceramics, including some Mycenaean imports, are attested at Telmessus (Fethiye) and Beylerbey (Hacimusalar) (Mee 1978: 124, 145; 1998: 141), while three bronze objects dated to the Late Bronze Age, now in the Ashmolean Museum (Oxford), are said to be from Tlos (Moorey, Schweizer 1974). Further discoveries of Mycenaean pottery are attested at Dereköy in the Burdur/isparta region (Mee 1978: 126; 1998: 141). Soundings at Xanthus (Metzger 1972: 23-26; Yener-Marksteiner 2007), Patara (Içik 2000: 6; Kahya 2002) and occasional discoveries around Elmali, including at Kizibel, Karaburun (Mellink 1969: pi. 76.32-33; 1970: pi. 58.19; 1972: pi. 57.11-12; 1976; 1998) and Hacimusalar (personal observation), provide isolated, unstratified insight into the material culture of Lycia during the earlier first millennium BC. Within this research context, therefore, the overall aims of our project are: (1) to contribute new knowledge about the settlement history and material culture of the pre-Classical periods in this region, by providing new data that could also help to contextualise the early written references mentioned above; (2) to investigate the role of this region within the context of broader eastern Mediter ranean-Anatolian-Aegean interactions and connectivity between the fourth and early first millennia BC, and more generally the role of major river systems as communi cation routes; (3) to explore the nature of settlement in this summer pasture location over a long span of time, so as to ascertain whether this area was exploited only seasonally, as it is largely today, or whether there is evidence of more permanent occupation, at least in certain periods; and (4) to examine possible shifts in the character of settlement in relation to changing environ mental and socio-political conditions. Çaltilar Höyük is an eminently suitable site by which one can begin to answer these research questions. The work of the Balboura Survey suggests that this settlement offers two of the major prerequisites for a successful investigation of these issues: the absence of extensive Classical and later remains, and a long sequence of occupation, from the fourth to the first millennium BC. In addition, in 1990 the site and its environs were declared a protected archaeological area, further facili tating archaeological research. After short visits in 2006 and 2007 by members of our team accompanying staff of the Fethiye Museum, in 2008 we started our programme of research, which included topographical, geophysical and archaeological surveys, together with studies of the archaeological finds from our surface collection, as well as other activities mentioned below. Only the surveys and artefact studies, however, are treated in this article, which is structured as follows: after the introduction, setting out the research context of this work, we present a section on the field surveys, which includes subsections on the topographic survey, surface collection (rapid reconnaissance and intensive archaeological survey around and on the mound, respec tively) and geophysics (magnetometer, electrical resistance tomography and magnetic susceptibility). This is followed by a section on artefact studies, which comprises subsections on ceramics, lithics (chipped stone and obsidian) and other materials; the ceramics subsection comprises discussions of the main classes of pottery in chronological order and a substantial part on ceramic petrography, the latter being especially useful to explore issues of connectivity. The fourth and final main section brings the results of this multi-disciplinary study together, offering a brief discussion on the phases, extent and nature of occupation at the site. 64</page><page sequence="5">Momigliano, Greaves, Hodos, Aksoy, Brown, Kibaroglu and Carter In addition to the surveys and artefact studies, during our 2008-2010 campaigns we initiated other research and outreach activities, which included: a survey of spolia in Çaltilar village; ethnoarchaeological research on modern pottery production in the area; preliminary geomorpho logical investigations; and a series of public meetings to explain our research and display our results to the general public. We have also held interviews with focus groups in the village to assess the local impact of our research in a variety of socio-economic and intellectual contexts, and to determine how best the project can work with the local community to achieve heritage sustainability. These other activities will be described in future publications (although summaries have already appeared in our annual preliminary reports in Anatolian Archaeology, Araçtirma Sonuçlari Toplantisi and ANMED [Anadolou Akdenizi Arkeoloji Haberleri/News of Archaeology from Anatolia s Mediterranean Areas] since 2008: for example, Momigliano et al. 2008; 2009; 2010a; 2010b; 2010c; 2011; see also our website: http://sace.liv.ac.uk/lycia/). Field surveys Field survey aims and methodologies The design of the fieldwork strategies for the investi gation of the höyük at Çaltilar sought to further the general aims of the project overall (see above). The aims of the fieldwork programme were to determine the extent of the archaeological site itself, to understand its occupa tional history, and to understand the site formation and post-depositional processes that have created the mound in its current form and are likely to have affected its character and future archaeological potential. Our specific objectives were: (1) to conduct surveys around the höyük and in the adjacent village to assess the visible archaeological material (pottery and spolia)-, (2) to conduct topographic studies of the mound and its surroundings; (3) to conduct intensive survey of the surface of the mound and collect all visible finds, plotting their distribution spatially and, where possible, identi fying their date and type; (4) to conduct geophysical surveys to elucidate further the nature of the site (magne tometry, electrical resistance tomography and magnetic susceptibility). Topographic survey. The settlement mound at Çaltilar is located approximately 300m to the south of the modern village in an area of cultivated fields and orchards. It covers approximately 3ha and the visible part of the site (the mound) measures about 180m north-south by 150m east-west and is 12m high at its highest point. The visible limits of the prominent höyük at Çaltilar are quite clear. The northernmost, and steepest, side of the mound is defined by a tractor track and a distinct drop away in the slope of the mound into a flat field. To the east it is delimited by a gravel road, beside which runs a stream fed by the Cuma spring that rises in Çaltilar village. Another, concrete-lined, water culvert fed by this same spring and a line of poplar trees denote the western edge of the site. The southern side of the mound drops away to a flat lower terrace, which wraps around its southern and southwestern sides and, in turn, drops away to extensive flat, cultivated fields to the south. A site grid was established from a pre-existing benchmark in the middle of the site that is a remnant from a previous government land survey and was taken as the 1000 east/1000 north point for the new grid. To establish the site grid and for the topographic survey itself, a Sokkia SET4E total station was used to take a total of 3,200 individual measurements. These data were then entered into a GIS package to create a Digital Elevation Map (DEM) of the mound and its surrounding areas (fig. 4). This DEM formed the basis for the dimensional distribution maps of the surface finds presented later in this report (figs 9, 10, 11, 12). To provide further information about the mound, its physical shape and environmental contexts, a series of aerial photographs was commissioned from a commercial air photographic service (Air Studyo, Antalya). Using a tethered helium balloon and remote-controlled digital camera, a systematic series of photographs was taken across the mound. In addition to a detailed set of oblique and vertical views of the mound, panoramic views of the höyük in its wider setting were also taken to illustrate its relationship with the local terrain, the modern village of Çaltilar and the contemporary physical and agricultural environment (figs 5, 6). These surveys, plus first-hand observations in the field, have provided a detailed understanding of the physical shape of the mound and insights into the possible site formation and post-depositional processes that may account for its current shape. The general shape of the mound is oval, oriented north-south. The top of the mound is entirely covered by cultivation terraces that step downwards towards the south. These take the form of a series of flat fields with retaining walls on the south side, behind which soil lynchets have accumulated. These fields have been ploughed, and the stones turned up by this ploughing have been removed to form retaining walls and occasional stone heaps, found at intervals across the site. These stone clusters and walls are often overgrown with thickets of wild plum, which grows extensively (fig. 6). In places, these walls and thickets impeded surface collection and geophysical survey, and the depth of accumulated soil towards the south of the mound and the deep ploughing of some fields limited the results of the geophysical survey (see below). The northern side of the 65</page><page sequence="6">Anatolian Studies 2011 1257 m Fig. 4.

Cultivation of the mound today 67</page><page sequence="8">Anatolian Studies 2011 mound appears stepped and has evidently been terraced at some point in the past, presumably for cultivation. In common with other sites in the Near East and Turkey, the northwest and west sides of the mound are the most eroded (Rosen 1986: 25^6; Thomas 2007: 47). Rapid reconnaissance survey. Excavations and surveys at other höyük sites in Turkey have shown that the visible limits of the mound itself do not always equate to the extent of the archaeological settlement. For example, at Kazane Höyük (Creekmore 2010) and Ziyaret Tepe (Matney, Bauer 2000: with previous references) substantial 'lower town' areas were identified by means of geophysical survey. Such areas can represent periods in a site's history when there was extensive settlement that extended, temporarily, beyond the previous limits of the accumulated levels of the main site. It was therefore necessary to determine if there was any evidence of such a lower town at Çaltilar or whether the visible höyük does indeed represent the limits of the main archaeological activity here. While the main site grid was being established, other team members conducted a rapid reconnaissance (with no collection of material) in the fields immediately adjacent to the mound, to determine more precisely the extent of the archaeological site that would be subject to intensive survey. This rapid reconnaissance revealed a sudden drop-off in archaeological remains to the east and west of the visible edges of the mound, that is the two sides delimited by the branches of the Cuma stream. The few sherds observed in these fields are typical of the background scatter, or 'halo', normally observable near archaeological sites (for example, Gallant 1986). Levels of pottery were generally very low, and even in fields that were as little as 50m away from the site itself there was apparently no archaeological material to be seen. However, to the immediate north and south of the prominent mound there were fields rich in pottery and other finds, which may represent lower occupation terraces. These fields were therefore included in the full geophysical investigations and surface collection. Fields further to the south that had yielded some Roman pottery and spolia were also included in the geophysical survey. Intensive archaeological survey. The aim of the intensive surface survey was to collect all visible artefacts from the surface of the mound and to plot their spatial distribution. Total surface collection was felt to be preferable to adopting a sampling strategy because of the relatively small size of the site and the relatively low density of visible finds noted during the Balboura Survey and preliminary site visits by the research team in 2006 and 2007. The results of such a total surface collection could also be meaningfully investigated should excavation at the site begin in the future. To achieve this, a grid was established across the höyük and fields immediately to the north and south, using wooden pegs at 10m intervals. For collection, these grids were then divided into 5m by 5m squares using ropes, and all visible artefacts were collected, separately bagged and logged by their grid co ordinates. It was hoped that the higher degree of precision that 5m grids allow might help to clarify issues in the temporal and functional usage of the site, whilst recognising that surface finds do not always directly correspond to archaeological activity and are subject to various post-depositional processes that can affect their distribution on the surface. Nevertheless, research at other sites in the Near East, where it has been possible to compare surface collection with materials recovered from excavation, has demonstrated that there can be a good correlation between surface and sub-surface material to a depth of ca 50cm (Thomas 2007: 45—46). During collection, each 5m by 5m square was assigned two walkers plus one person to complete a paper record of each grid, including recording features, visibility and other factors that might affect the later inter pretation of the results. To ensure a degree of consistency in assessing visibility, the number of team members who were responsible for completing this component of the field record was restricted to a few individuals who had compared their perceptions of visibility and worked together closely to ensure minimum discrepancies in this important index (Whitelaw 2007: 58). To ensure further comparability of results between squares and to limit the bias that individual collectors might have in recognising and collecting materials, walkers covered each square systematically by walking boustrophedon in both north south and east-west directions, with each walker re examining ground already covered by the other. A time limit was also placed on how long could be spent in each square, with a minimum of five and a maximum of ten minutes being allowed for collection. The average time taken for each 5m by 5m square was eight minutes. In 2008, collection was concentrated into a 50m by 150m transect across the north-south axis of the höyük, with small extensions to the north, east and south. This made effective use of the limited time available to under stand the general character of the site and the range of materials present, as well as the difference in on-site and off-site levels of activity. In this season, a total of 413 squares (10,325m2) were walked and 14,000 sherds and almost 400 other finds were recorded. In 2009, the remaining areas not covered by the previous season's transect were walked, resulting in a total coverage of the whole mound. An additional 715 squares were surveyed to the east and west of the 2008 transect, covering 68</page><page sequence="9">Momigliano, Greaves, Hodos, Aksoy, Brown, Kibaroglu and Carter 17,875m2. A further 18,700 pieces of pottery and 580 other finds were collected, processed and recorded in that year's work. In both years a number of squares that had been recently covered were re-walked by another team soon afterwards as a control to ascertain that the initial collection had been thorough. In most cases no pottery remained to be collected, with one or more artefacts remaining to be collected by the second sweep in only a very few cases. Over two years of intensive surface collection, it was therefore possible to cover an area of 28,200m2. This included the whole surface of the visible mound, the lower terraces to the south and north, and some part of the adjacent fields. The recovered artefacts included ca 33,000 sherds and ca 1,000 other finds (see below). In order to understand better the processes by which artefacts were brought to the surface between seasons, two 10m by 10m areas that had been walked in 2008 were re-walked in 2009 and, in addition, the location of each individual find in these two areas was plotted using the total station. One of these reinvestigated areas was located on the south terrace and had been subject to ploughing in the intervening year; the other area was on the north summit of the höyük and had not been ploughed but featured numerous molehills, which are common at Çaltilar. This reinvestigation showed that the number of artefacts collected in 2009 was similar to that collected in 2008. Quantifying the collected sherds demonstrated that new artefacts are being brought to the surface each year by the dynamic post-deposition processes of agriculture and mole activity. Plotting their distribution spatially showed that, perhaps unsurprisingly, whereas in ploughed areas sherds were found in lines that roughly corre sponded to the route of the plough, in areas where moles were the main agents that brought artefacts to the soil's surface their distribution was more typically clustered. These results provide an important insight into some of the processes by which the pottery gathered by the survey had been brought to the surface for recovery. The contents of the bags collected from each individual 5m by 5m square were washed, sorted, counted, weighed and entered into a database at the depot. At this stage they were sorted into preliminary categories, including prehistoric I (subdivided into Neolithic, Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age), prehistoric II (Middle and Late Bronze Age), Iron Age (subdivided into Early, Middle and Late), Classical to Roman, post-Roman (subdivided into Byzantine, Islamic, Ottoman and modern) and unknown. Examples of diagnostic material were photographed and drawn. All material was kept and is held in the project depot for future study and long-term storage in systematically arranged boxes. The only example of obsidian found was sent for analysis to T. Carter at McMaster University, Canada, while samples of pottery and slag were taken for scientific analysis in Germany and the UK, respectively. Observations on particularly abraded material and fresh breaks were noted during processing, although no detailed, systematic study has yet been conducted on sherd size and abrasion; we hope that this will be done in the future. Geophysical surveys. Three types of geophysical survey were used to complement and enhance the results of the intensive surface collection. These were magnetometer, electrical resistance tomography and magnetic suscepti bility. For the magnetometer survey a fluxgate gradiometer was used across 20m by 20m grid squares, with readings taken every metre. Due to the character of the höyük and the very delicate nature of the magnetometer equipment, not all areas of the mound were accessible to this type of survey. On the western, northern and eastern slopes of the mound the ground was too steep or treacherous to allow the equipment to be used safely; on the northwest corner of the mound the presence of an electricity pylon and overhead cables was likely to cause interference with the results; and some areas of the surface were so densely covered by thickets or field walls that the equipment could not be used safely, and dummy returns were made where results could not be achieved. The survey was conducted in 2008 and the strategy was to follow the same transect used in the surface collection. That is to say, a wide transect was taken on a north-south axis across the length of the mound starting to the south of the visible mound and extending as far north as could be safely achieved given the limitations of the equipment on the extremely steep northern slope of the höyük. When the north-south transect was finished, additional areas that had shown promising results were added. These were the northeast corner of the mound and the lower terrace to the north. In total, an area of 13,600m2 was surveyed; the results are presented in fig. 7 and discussed below. The second type of geophysical survey used was electrical resistance tomography, which was conducted in 2010 using a Campus system from the University of Liverpool. The specific aims of the tomography survey were to investigate the limits of the settlement, to under stand the structure of the höyük and to gather more infor mation about anomalies in the northeast corner, first identified by the 2008 magnetometer survey. These two systems complement each other well because they work on different principles, and the addition of electrical resistance tomography would add to the results of the magnetometer survey because it can reveal sub-surface structures at greater depths than standard magnetometry. 69</page><page sequence="10">Anatolian Studies 2011 Fig. 7. Results of the magnetometer survey 70</page><page sequence="11">Momigliano, Greaves, Hodos, Aksoy, Brown, Kibaroglu and Carter In electrical resistance tomography a line of copper pegs is set at lm intervals and connected to a cable, between which a series of electrical pulses is sent out, and the differing levels of resistance are recorded and calcu lated to produce vertical profiles through the sub-soil stratigraphy to a depth of 4m (fig. 8). Using this method, a series of 25m-long east-west profiles was taken across the site from north to south at 10m intervals so as to understand the limits of the site and the general structure of the höyük. A second series of profiles at lm intervals and oriented north-south was taken across an area of the northeast of the mound where a large anomaly had been noted by the magnetometer survey in 2008. Finally, a series of test profiles was taken in an east-west orien tation in cultivated fields to the northeast of the mound on the northern terrace, where surface collection suggested there was a very high concentration of pottery. The results from these profiles are discussed below. Finally, a complete survey of the mound and the immediately adjacent areas was made using a Bartington MS2 magnetic susceptibility probe. This method can identify archaeological activity against background levels of natural soils because burning causes magnetic suscep tibility spikes that can be differentiated from 'natural' geology. By surveying the whole surface of the mound and the adjacent fields we hoped to determine the limits of the settlement, as magnetic susceptibility levels might be expected to drop away sharply beyond them. To achieve this, readings were taken at 5m intervals across the whole surface of the mound. Again, the results of this survey are discussed below. Results of surveys Intensive archaeological survey results. The initial obser vation made during the rapid reconnaissance survey of the surrounding fields - that the volume of pottery dropped off sharply beyond the visible limits of the site - was largely confirmed. With the exception of fields immediately to the north and south of the prominent part of the mound, which appear to form lower terraces to it, no significant numbers of finds were made beyond it (see also below, figs 9-12). This has been demonstrated by the rapid reconnaissance, the intensive survey, as well as both the magnetometer and electrical resistance tomog raphy surveys. The effective size of the site can therefore be considered to be slightly larger than the immediately visible limits of the mound.

It can also be seen that, as one would expect, the volume of pottery gathered corresponds very closely with the contemporary land use in the area under examination. Volumes were highest where recent agricultural activity had included ploughing. This includes the south terrace, the north terrace and the southeast corner of the flat top of the höyük itself. Where there had been no recent ploughing, sherds were brought to the surface by molehills, which are particularly common across much of the north-central area of the mound. Where yields were lowest, it was often because of the presence of thickets of wild plum, thistles or other close growth that impeded collection, as can be observed in the northeast corner of the höyük. More specific forms of disturbance also contributed to the distribution of sherds on the surface of the mound. For example, in the very northwest comer of the mound, excavations for the foundations of an electricity pylon have contributed to a spike in the number of sherds recorded in this area. There are also generally higher numbers of finds recorded from the lower sides of the mound, especially on the south. This may be due to increased erosion on the slopes, partly related to culti vation patterns and the slight inclination of the mound in this direction. The distribution of finds can also be affected by deflation of deposits, whereby artefacts that are heavier than the soil in which they are contained and the movement of sediments wash artefacts downslope and can result in a concentration of artefacts in lower parts of the site. For example, it was noted during processing of material from the north fields that the pottery dated to the Iron Age looked particularly 72</page><page sequence="13">Momigliano, Greaves, Hodos, Aksoy, Brown, Kibaroglu and Carter abraded, suggesting exposure for a considerable amount of time and possible downslope movement, in contrast with the prehistoric I material, the appearance of which was more 'fresh' and generally less abraded by comparison. Finally, more recent investigations and surface collections carried out before our systematic survey began (for example, a few artefacts collected from one area of the mound that may have been dropped elsewhere) may have had an impact (cf. also Whitelaw 1991: 204-05). Overall, despite these possible post-depositional factors, they are unlikely to have caused very severe disturbance to the deposits at Çaltilar, and, although the volumes of artefacts recovered can vary considerably from square to square as a result of recent agricultural activity, the general distribution of the pottery and other finds is likely to have been largely unaffected. Figs 10-12 illustrate the pottery distribution according to the main periods mentioned above (prehis toric I, II, etc.), while fig. 13 illustrates overall propor tions of ceramic finds. The pottery distribution maps were produced by Andy Wilson (University of Liverpool), using ArcGIS and Surfer softwares. Material attributable to the prehistoric I (Late Chalcolithic to Early Bronze Age) phase of occupation represents 24% (sherd count) and 34% (weight count) of the total assemblage, and appears to have a wide distri bution, with significant concentrations on the southern part of the level top of the höyük as well as on its lower terraces to the north and south. This, combined with the aforementioned observations on the abraded character of the Iron Age pottery, especially in the north terrace, suggests that the prehistoric I occupation of the mound was more extensive than that of later periods. Fig 10. Distribution maps of prehistoric I pottery: (a) raw data with sherd counts; (b) kernel density (raster image); (c) 3D version of kernel density map 73</page><page sequence="14">Anatolian Studies 2011 Prehistoric II (Middle to Late Bronze Age) pottery is quantitatively fairly insignificant (representing about 1% of the total in terms of pottery count and about 2% in terms of pottery weight). The sherds that can be attributed to this phase seem to be fairly evenly spread across the mound, and are likely to have been brought to the surface by disturbances, such as that created by the installation of the electricity pylon in the northwest corner of the flat top of the mound or excavations of foundation trenches or similar activities in the Iron Age. Iron Age material represents approximately 75% (sherd count) and 62% (weight count) of our total pottery assemblage, clearly reflecting the fact that levels dating to this period represent the latest phases of substantial use/occupation of the mound (and are therefore over represented in the surface assemblage: cf. Rosen 1986:48 51). Post Iron Age material is insignificant in quantity, and its distribution is therefore not illustrated here. As noted above, a general preponderance of material for all periods seems to be located on the sides of the mound, and especially on the south and southeast sides. This 'skirt' effect is not unusual (cf. Thomas 2007: 54), and at our site can be partly related to cultivation patterns and erosion, and the slight inclination of the mound in this direction. Geophysical results. The results of the magnetometer, electrical resistance tomography and magnetic suscepti bility surveys have all furthered our understanding of the settlement history of the mound and the post-depositional processes at work here. The results from the magnetometer survey revealed that there was no detectable sub-surface activity on the lower terraces and fields and apple orchards immediately adjacent to and beyond the limits of the visible mound to the south (see fig. 7). In the fields further to the south, Fig. 11.

These results suggest that the visible limits of the site are indeed also the limits of the main zone of archaeological activity. Where this spolium and pottery originated is, as yet, unclear, although a few nearby sites identified by the Balboura Survey are possible sources (Coulton et al. forthcoming). From the flat summit of the höyük, the magne tometer results correspond closely with the existing pattern of field walls that are visible on the surface. This series of east-west oriented farming terraces dominated the magnetometer results across the south and central areas of the höyük. Only in the northern area of the mound were there any signs of sub-surface activity not related to these field walls (fig. 7, upper right). The clearest of these anomalies was a large rectangular feature, oriented north-east to south-west in the northeast corner of the summit of the mound. On the surface above where this anomaly appeared, a large concentration of fieldstones was observed, suggesting that this anomaly may indicate the presence of a stone built structure beneath the surface at this point. The feature appeared to measure approximately 10m by 20m in size. Elsewhere on the mound, there are anomalies that correspond to the curve of the mound in the northeast corner, but there is nothing yet to indicate that these are archaeological features rather than changes in the soil caused by the slope of the mound at this point. On the lower terrace to the northeast of the mound, a noisy pattern of anomalies is probably a consequence of recent agricultural usage. Electrical resistance tomography is a method of geophysical prospection that is capable of producing profiles through the soil to provide information on sub surface stratigraphy. The system used at Çaltilar produced 25m-long profiles, with an effective depth of 4m (fig. 8). Setting up and operating the system are extremely time consuming activities and it cannot be used in rain or during thunderstorms, both of which are common in the Lycian yayla region during the summer months. Consequently, the use of this technique in the 2010 season was focused on clarifying particular questions about the site that had been raised by the previous years' surface collection and magnetometer surveys. The first priority for the electrical resistance tomog raphy was to understand the general character of the höyük, its structure and post-depositional history. The magnetometer survey in 2008 had indicated that, other than at the north end of the mound, the site had been intensively used for agriculture and any archaeological evidence in this area is likely to have been buried by lynchets of plough soil, accumulated behind walls of fieldstones. To examine this provisional interpretation further, a series of 18 profiles was taken east-west across the central axis of the mound at 10m intervals. In the profiles from the north of the mound, some sub-surface features are discernable. However, as profiles were taken progressively southwards, fewer and fewer features were discernable at deeper levels, perhaps as a result of the accumulation of plough soil towards the south. In general, very few features could be identified firmly in the profiles. Reasons that may account for this obser vation may be the limited use of stone architecture at the site or the dryness of the soil conditions in the summer months. Where profiles were taken to the south of the mound, there was a significant change in character, suggesting that the limits of the archaeological site had been reached and adding further weight to the hypothesis that the visible limits of the mound roughly correspond to the actual limits of the zone of archaeological activity. This is consistent with the results of the 2008 rapid recon naissance, surface collection and magnetometer surveys, which also indicated a sharp drop-off in archaeological finds at this point. In the northeast corner of the site, where a rectilinear anomaly had been identified by the 2008 magnetometer survey, an intensive sequence of north-south oriented electrical resistance profiles was taken at lm intervals. In these, the anomaly was clearly visible at depths from the surface down to 2.5m. These results are consistent with this anomaly being the remains of a stone-built structure of considerable size and depth (fig. 8). Finally, on the lower terrace to the northeast of the mound, a trial series of profiles was taken across a culti vated field in which a high density of prehistoric pottery had been recovered during surface collection. However, due to this field being irrigated for cultivation, the results of the electrical resistance tomography only showed the wetter topsoil layers with any clarity and no deeper features were discernable, and survey here was halted. It had been hoped that the magnetic susceptibility survey of the mound and all the nearest sections of the adjacent fields would be able to differentiate the area of most intense archaeological activity, that is to say the site of Çaltilar Höyük, from its surrounding background geology. However, due to either the nature of the background pedology or contemporary agricultural practices, such as fertilising with potash or nitrates, or both, it was not possible to identify such subtle differ ences in the readings, and the results of this survey were inconclusive. 76</page><page sequence="17">Momigliano, Greaves, Hodos, Aksoy, Brown, Kibaroglu and Carter Ceramics In the late 1990s, J.J. Coulton (1998: 236) noted that the work of the Balboura Survey was hampered by the 'absence of excavated sites in the area which would provide dated sequences of local pottery to which the survey sherds could be compared'. A decade or more later, the situation has not substantially improved, although publications of the excavations conducted by M.J. Mellink in the 1960s at Elmali-Karata? (Eslick 1992; 2009) and by Refik Duru from the 1970s onwards at Kuruçay and Bademagaci (Duru 1994; 1996; 2008) have improved this state of affairs to some extent, especially for the fourth and third millennia BC. The problems in identi fying and dating surface material are particularly acute for the second millennium and Early Iron Age, partly because of the scarcity of nearby excavated sites that can offer adequate parallels. Intensive surveys in the territories of Kyanaei and Hacimusalar (Kolb 2008 and Foss 2006 respectively) did not report any second millennium material, even if, at or near the latter, occupation during this period is attested by some remains detected during excavations and previous surface investigations (Mee 1978: 124, 145; 1998: 141; Mellink 1985; 1995). Even at Kilise Tepe in the Göksu valley, which is relatively close to well-known and extensively excavated settlements such as Tarsus and Mersin, surface investigations identified very little Middle Bronze Age material, although this phase was well represented in the subsequent excavations (Baker et al. 1995: 168-70, 182-86; Thomas 2007: 50; Postgate 2007: 103-09). We hope that the publication by ilknur Özgen of the excavations at Hacimusalar in the Elmali plain will help to rectify this situation. In the following pages we describe various types of wares recovered from our survey, which have added considerable data to the picture provided by the Balboura Survey concerning the use/occupation of the höyük from the fourth to the middle of the first millennium BC, especially in combination with the results of the pétro graphie analyses (see below, 'Ceramic petrography'). Prehistoric I (Chalcolithic to Early Bronze Age) Chalcolithic. The earliest datable ceramic material at Çaltilar appears to belong to this period, and more specif ically to a late phase, since we were unable to identify any typical Neolithic or Early Chalcolithic decorated pottery, such as that found at Girmeler Cave near Tlos in the lower Xanthus river valley or in the Burdur region at Hacilar and Kuruçay (for Girmeler, see Köktürk 2000; French 2008; for the Burdur region, see Duru 2008: figs 121-42, with further references). The Chalcolithic pottery from our site is all hand made, and is principally exemplified by two related ware types, both of which are characterised by the presence of abundant chaff as temper. The first usually presents well smoothed or burnished surfaces, mottled in colour, varying from buff to dark greyish-brownish; it also presents a dark grey-black fabric (or at least a dark grey black core), very rich in chaff temper but also other inclu sions. The second differs from the first only in the appearance of its exterior, which has a coarser, unbur nished surface. While we cannot exclude the possibility that some pieces from both wares could date to earlier phases in the Chalcolithic era, or indeed later, as they may continue in the Early Bronze Age, diagnostic fragments from Çaltilar include several lug handles and a large handled bowl with flaring rim and rounded base (fig. 14A, B), which find exact parallels with the Late Chalcol ithic pottery of Elmali-Bagbaçi (cf. Eslick 1992: pl. 16.4, 6, 7 for bowl, pis 30-32, 105e for handles). An almost complete miniature cup (fig. 14C) also probably belongs to this period. Pétrographie analyses of six samples from these wares (CT-15-20, see below, 'Ceramic petrog raphy') indicate that on the whole they form a fairly homogeneous group (assignable to pétrographie group 1), which can be described as 'local'. A unique fragment in dark-burnished and white painted ware (fig. 14D) from Çaltilar may also be assigned to the Late Chalcolithic, since it ' inds its best parallels in pottery dated to this phase found at Beycesultan and Aphrodisias (Lloyd, Mellaart 1962: 82, fig. P5: 92, fig. P9, pi. XVIIc; Joukowsky 1986: 309, fig. 279) and appears to be slightly different from other fragments decorated in white on dark recovered from our site and assignable to the Early Bronze Age (discussed below). This piece has a dense, fairly fine dark fabric (with no chaff clearly visible), a black highly burnished surface and a decoration in relatively thin, regular lines, in a thinly applied white paint. Another quite rare but distinctive type of ware that may be assigned to the Chalcolithic/Early Bronze Age phases of the settlement is represented by very coarse, gritty fragments, with reddish-buff smoothed or even burnished surfaces. To the naked eye, the main character istic of this ceramic class is the presence of very frequent large whitish chert inclusions. Pétrographie analyses suggest that this type of pottery is likely to be local (group 1, subgroup IF, and group 4, subgroup 4A). Early Bronze Age. Much of the pottery assignable to the Early Bronze Age finds parallels with that found at Elmali-Karataç and dated to the Early Bronze Age II and III phases (cf. below), especially with Early Bronze Age II ceramics, but so far we have been unable to identify pottery that can be assigned with certainty to Early Bronze Age I (and this also seems the case concerning the assemblage from Çaltilar collected by the Balboura Survey: French forthcoming). 77</page><page sequence="18">Anatolian Studies 2011 IN09.0001 A IN09.0013 B IN09.0012 3cm ra IN09.0035 q 0 3cm O V IN09.0002 ' ! 3cm KEY: I black 'A red dark to buff. | burnished grey light brown dark brown purple Fig. 14. Late Chalcolithic pottery: (A) bowl with flaring rim; (B) lugs; (C) small cup; (D) dark burnished ware with white painted decoration; colour key employed for figs 14-46 Several wares can be assigned to the Early Bronze Age II—III phases: grey-black to buff burnished; dark grey-black burnished ware with white painted decoration; red burnished with white painted decoration; pale grey burnished micaceous ware; incised ware; and relief ware. Much continues to be handmade, although some fragments belong to vessels that may have been wheel-thrown. Of the grey-black to dark buff burnished ware, surfaces are usually well burnished and vary in colour from grey to black, with dark grey-black cores, but can also assume dark buff and even reddish hues in fragments that were fired in slightly more oxidising conditions (and sometimes variations in colour from black to reddish or buff can be observed on the same fragment). Most diagnostic pieces can be assigned to rims of wide mouthed jars or plates and to bowls with rounded profiles (fig. 15). Some bowls are provided with knobs near the rims (fig. 16), while others are provided with handles imitating twisted rope, which are quite typical of the late 78</page><page sequence="19">Momigliano, Greaves, Hodos, Aksoy, Brown, Kibaroglu and Carter Early Bronze Age II period (fig. 17; cf., for example, Eslick 2009: pis 50: KT 479, 58: KT 185, KY 507; Lloyd, Mellaart 1962: 156, fig. P29). With the exception of fairly rare fragments with micaceous fabrics, suggesting that they are imports to Çaltilar, probably from the Denizli/Menderes massif region, it is practically impossible to distinguish macro scopically the different fabrics of the grey-black to dark buff burnished wares. Thin section analysis, however, shows that pottery assigned to this category belongs to several pétrographie groups, some of which can be considered 'local' (group 1), while others fall outside the geological area compatible with our site (groups 2 and 3). Some samples were taken in 2009 from what appeared macroscopically a homogeneous group of dark burnished fragments; their thin sections, however, showed them to belong to different pétrographie groups. In 2010 we restudied this material, and took more samples in an attempt to match more closely macroscopic and micro scopic groups, but to no avail.

Early Bronze Age dark burnished ware: rounded bowls with knobs on rims A few fragments in burnished ware show decoration in relief. One is a rim fragment from a large jar with traces of what may be anthropomorphic decoration (fig. 18), reminiscent of that found on a smaller vessel from Early Bronze Age Elmali-Karataç (Warner 1994: pi. 166; Eslick 2009: pi. 66: KA 602). Dark burnished ware with white painted decoration is a very distinctive but rare type of ware, since only three fragments have been assigned to it. However, it is likely that more pieces were originally decorated with white paint, which has since disappeared. Indeed, of these three fragments, only one is well enough preserved to be worth illustrating (fig. 19A). Compared with the Chalcolithic example in this ware discussed above, the fragments assigned to the Early Bronze Age show a similar black burnished surface, but the white painted lines are thicker and more greyish or creamy-white in colour. The three fragments collected from Çaltilar belong to both open and closed vessels (i.e. bowls and jugs), and show close affinities with comparable pottery found at Elmali Karataç, mostly in period IV, which is dated to the Early Bronze Age II (cf. also below: red burnished ware with white painted decoration). Similar pottery is also attested at Eceler Höyük near Seki (Aksoy, Köse 2005). The three sherds have been sampled for pétrographie analysis (samples CT-101-03) and this shows that one belongs to pétrographie group 1 (local) and the other two to group 2 (possibly from the Elmali area). Red burnished ware with white painted decoration is as distinctive and rare as the black burnished and white painted ware discussed above. Only a few examples have been collected from the surface, belonging to both closed and open shapes, such as large bowls with white painted semicircles pendant from the rim and small jugs (fig. 19B -E). One fragment presents a slight variation, in having a white decoration probably consisting of hatched triangles on a buff burnished instead of red surface (fig. 19F). The fabric of these sherds is fairly fine and pale buff in colour (with a greyish core in some examples). Our fragments are closely comparable to pottery from Elmah Karataç periods V and VI (Eslick 2009: 51-53) and from Hacimusalar (see below, 'Ceramic petrography'). According to Mellink (1966: 252) and Eslick (2009: 51), red burnished pottery such as this became more popular at Karataç in period V, while black burnished predominated in the earlier phase. Both Karataç periods IV and V, 80</page><page sequence="21">Momigliano, Greaves, Hodos, Aksoy, Brown, Kibaroglu and Carter however, are dated within the Anatolian Early Bronze Age II period, while phase VI also partly overlaps with the Early Bronze Age III (Eslick 2009: 227). Of this ware, four fragments were sampled from Çaltilar, and these were compared with two samples from Hacimusalar, kindly provided by the excavator (and with the permission of our respective representatives of the Turkish government). The results of the pétrographie analyses of these six fragments show that they belong to two distinctive pétrographie groups, 1 and 2, the former probably 'local' and the latter derived from calcareous clays, and most likely located in the Elmali area, although other regions outside the Çaltilar basin cannot be excluded. Very few fragments (fig. 20) assignable to the prehis toric period and presenting incised decoration were collected at Çaltilar. Their rarity and their micaceous fabrics strongly suggest a non-local origin (possibly from the Denizli/Menderes massif area), but this conclusion needs to be corroborated by pétrographie analyses. No very close parallels have been recognised, but while incised ware is also found at various nearby sites (such as Kuruçay and Elmali- Bagbaçi) already in Late Chalcolithic levels (cf. Eslick 1992: pl. 104e, f; Duru 2008: 136, fig. 270 centre, 138, fig. 272 top row), there are closer affinities, once again, with Early Bronze Age levels at Elmali-Karataç (cf.

Joukowsky 1986: 393, fig. 326.1, 5) and Beycesultan (Lloyd, Mellaart 1962: pl. XXIII.4). Prehistoric II (Middle to Late Bronze Age) Pottery that can be safely assigned to these phases is relatively scarce at present, amounting to only a handful of examples. Even if one were to include the few dozen sherds whose attribution to the second millennium BC is less certain, the total amount of pottery from this period would remain statistically not very significant, i.e. between 1-2% of our total surface collection. Never theless, the very existence of this second millennium BC material is important, given the relative paucity of remains of this period in our region in general and in relation to references to the Lukka people and settlements in this area in early documentary sources, as mentioned in the introduction. This relative scarcity may also be explained by two factors: (a) our inability to identify some of the surface pottery as belonging to this phase; and (b) the likelihood that the Middle to Late Bronze Age occupation of the höyük was not as extensive as that of the Late Chalcolithic to Early Bronze Age and has largely been obscured by subsequent occupation levels. Material that can be assigned to the second millennium BC with some confidence comprises a number of carinated bowls covered with a red slip (fig. 21) and made in semi-fine reddish-buff fabrics usually showing a grey core. These bowls find parallels in terms of their overall appearance and profile among some of the material assigned to the early to middle second millennium BC published from Elmali, Bademagaci and Beycesultan (cf., for example, fig. 21A and Mellink 1969: pi. 78, fig. 44; Umurtak 2003: fig. 2.4, 5; cf. fig. 2IB, C with Umurtak 2003: fig. 5.11; Lloyd, Mellaart 1965: fig. PI2: 12). One fragment with bead rim and handle set upon the rim, in particular, is closely reminiscent of Beycesultan IVb shapes (fig. 2IE; cf. Lloyd, Mellaart 1965: fig. P24: 36-38), but could also belong to later phases of the Late Bronze Age. Thin section analysis of one of the examples illustrated here (fig. 21C) suggests this is an import (from the Denizli/Menderes massif area). Fig. 20.

Middle to Late Bronze Age red-slipped ware 84</page><page sequence="25">Momigliano, Greaves, Hodos, Aksoy, Brown, Kibaroglu and Carter Other material from our site that could belong to the Middle and Late Bronze Ages is represented by a few red and grey-slipped bowls with rounded or carinated profiles, red-slipped pedestal fragments, red-slipped handles with sub-triangular sections and trefoil-rim jugs in a buff semi-coarse fabric (see also Momigliano, Aksoy forthcoming). But their state of preservation (especially their limited size), the present lack of secure comparanda from this region and/or the wide chronological range that can be attributed to them (for example, trefoil-rim fragments: cf. Baker et al. 1995: 157) make their identifi cation much more tentative. Some of the potential Late Bronze Age grey wares appear to be imports. Indeed, all of the samples submitted as potential Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age wares appear not to be local products, but, given the uncertainties regarding their classification and the paucity of this material in general, these results should not be regarded as conclusive (cf. also below, 'Ceramic petrography'). Iron Age Of the ca 33,000 sherds collected during the 2008 and 2009 seasons, as noted above, 75% (sherd count) and 62% (weight count) were identified as likely to be Iron Age, that is dating from ca 1200 BC down to ca 550 BC. This end point is taken for the Iron Age because it is when Lycia was annexed into the Persian empire (see below). Of the sherds collected, 945 were identified as having particular diagnostic potential that would enable us to establish a basic chronology of the site's occupational history and begin to inform a pottery typology for Çaltilar's Iron Age periods. Diagnostic features include physical aspects that would enable shape identification, such as rims, handles, bases and other distinguishing physical features, as well as distinctive decorative motifs. Many body sherds that were decorated with simple bands and/or concentric circles were not considered sufficiently diagnostic for the purposes of the present study and therefore were not quantified as such. A number of fabrics were regarded as local at macro scopic level due to their frequency and long duration, since they appear to have been used not only throughout the Iron Age but also during previous periods. What distinguishes them chronologically is the quality of the clay, the decorative styles and their execution, and the vessel shapes themselves, all of which find parallels in stratified contexts elsewhere. Representative samples of our various fabric groups were subjected to pétrographie analysis (see below, 'Ceramic petrography'). Those that we considered macro scopically as local in fact fall within all four main pétro graphie groups. This suggests that much of the material that we had originally considered 'local' comes not from our immediate upland basin, but from a regional koine in affinity with wares produced at Elmali and perhaps the eastern part of Sögüt, and even further away. Examples that we did suspect as being imports from further north along the western Anatolian littoral fall into group 3, which largely hails from the western part of Denizli and the more western regions of the Menderes massif. The following discussion highlights our most representative and significant examples from the Iron Age assemblage. Early Iron Age.

Cores of sherds can range from grey to pink in colour as a result of firing. Inclusions range from small to large white inclusions, with some examples being more gritty than others, particularly larger vessels, which generally have coarser fabrics, with white inclusions and pock marks visible on the surface. Decoration may include self-slip or wash and occasional burnishing, and comprises a range of geometric elements from typical simple matt black bands through to more complex cross-hatched and bichrome motifs. The addition of matt red or brown paint is relatively common, in some cases with the use of a third colour (for example white or purple) to produce a more extensive range of bichrome and polychrome themes (fig. 22B, D, H). Concentric circles (fig. 22C), triangles and semicircles pendant from ground lines are characteristic of this group, as are cross-hatched triangles and bands (figs 22A, E, G, 23C). Wave line motifs, both horizontal and vertical, are present with the rare addition of moulded and incised decorative elements (figs 22F, 23A). Concentric circle motifs and concentric triangles may date as early as the late tenth or early ninth century (for example, Catling 1998: 154, 166-67; Coldstream et al. 2001:36-40; Lemos 2002). Many of the vessels are medium to large in size with a variety of closed and open shapes. These include large bowls, amphoras and vessels for mixing, pouring and drinking, including various jug and cup forms (fig. 23). A number of pedestal bases, including some with banded decoration (fig. 24), have parallels elsewhere that date to a horizon within the tenth and ninth centuries, and perhaps extending into the later 11th century (Catling, Lemos 1990: 69-70; Coldstream, Catling 1996: 379-84; Lemos 2002: figs 63-66; Aytaçlar 2004: figs 11, 16). 86</page><page sequence="27">Momigliano, Greaves, Hodos, Aksoy, Brown, Kibaroglu and Carter The origins of these vessels may be from elsewhere, as suggested by our pétrographie results: a closed vessel with black and red bands belongs to subgroup 2D, while what appears macroscopically as a general single type of red gritty ware in fact has quite diverse origins (subgroups 2G, 3B and 4B). One sherd of this phase in a unique fabric macroscopically has a horizontally everted rim with a fabric that is strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) with small white and large dark red inclusions, and a dark brown slip decorated with a concentric chevron pattern on the shoulder in added white (fig. 23D); its origin is unclear at this time. Middle Iron Age. A substantial number of our examples (ca 460 diagnostic examples) compare to material in central and western Anatolia associated with ninth, eighth and early seventh century stratified contexts (for example, Clazomenai: Ersoy 2004; Smyrna: Özgunel 2003; Bagbaçi: Mellink 1970: pl. 58; 1984: 105; Büyiikkale/Bogazköy: Bossert 2000; Genz 2004; Kealhofer et al. 2009: 280-82; Kilise Tepe: Hansen, Postgate 1999; Postgate, Thomas 2007). Fabrics show continuity from the previous phase; the distinguishing features in defining the Middle Iron Age examples below include the more precise execution of a greater variety of decorative motifs and vessel forms themselves. It is now clear from pétrographie analysis that many originate elsewhere (subgroups 2A, 2D, 2G, 3B, 3C, 3D, 3G, 3H; see below, 'Ceramic petrography'), although some may well be from the immediate environs (subgroup 1C). Large open and closed vessel forms, notably mixing bowls, pouring shapes, including trefoil-rim forms (associated with this phase on the basis of the quality of the decoration execution), and probably storage forms (i.e. amphoras) are prevalent (fig. 25A-C) alongside finer bowl forms (fig. 25D-H) (cf. Bossert, Fischer 1998: fig. 6.3; Utili 1999: nos 256, 262, 264, 266; Asian 2002: no 152). Among the form innovations in this period is the flat-edged rim, sometimes with decoration on the rim itself and usually accompanied by series of bands on the body (fig. 26A-C). Tall rims are also characteristic of this phase (for example, Cummer 1976: nos 1—11; Asian 2002: nos 37-38; also in Greece, for example Langdon 1995: nos 1103, 1114-25, 1189, 1202-03) and are similarly adorned with finely-executed bands (fig. 26D G). Bases can be flat, ring or pedestal (fig. 27), while handles can be strap and circular (fig. 28). Decoration includes a variety of geometric motifs that are executed mostly in matt black paint with the occasional addition of red or purple. Well-executed, precisely-drawn bands, triangles and concentric circles are particularly popular. Banded decoration, in addition to lines of diverse widths, can also include bands with red infill (fig. 29D, G J, M, P, W, Z, Ae). Concentric pendant semicircles are often executed above or below a ground line, which sometimes is depicted in added red rather than black (fig. 29A, C, H, I, K, L, N, P, S, T, V). Vertical wavy lines and horizontal wave line motifs are related to this class (fig. 29D, F, M, Y, Ad). Cross-hatched triangles, a cross hatched motif with added red, and concentric chevrons represent the angular motifs (fig. 29E, O, Q, W, X); swastikas and cabled decoration also appear (fig. 29B). Notable are a number of sherds with very micaceous fabrics, which most probably originate from coastal Caria, along the Büyük Menderes valley and/or one of the nearby Aegean islands (fig. 30), where mica is one of the distinguishing fabric features. They are characterised by numerous flecks of silver or gold mica that can be small or large and are aligned in some examples, which is indicative of clay-working processes. The decorative motifs of these sherds are similar to the genre of the eighth and seventh centuries. Where decoration is preserved, motifs include bands and wavy lines. / \ ' / i M ) ^ 1 I / / 0 \ = 5cm — 0 / H 5cm Fig. 25.

Imported western Anatolian micaceous ware group We also have a substantial and notable collection of material from elsewhere in western Anatolia, as indicated by our pétrographie analysis (see below, 'Ceramic petrog raphy'), although we are unable to say from precisely where; this is associated with the general class of south western Anatolian ware (most recently and with refer ences, see Coulton forthcoming b: section d; French forthcoming). Our examples, grouped on the basis of their surface treatment, are petrographically discrete, and with further study may serve as a means of distinguishing production centres and techniques. One group is noted for its thick white slip on a relatively coarse fabric that is yellowish-red (5YR 5/6) with quite a few small and medium-sized white inclusions and medium black inclu sions (subgroup 3A). The surface treatment consists of the thick white slip, especially on the rim for open shaped bowls, and then a brownish slip similar to the fabric colour on the interior. Burnishing is sometimes evident. Decoration is in matt black with added red and includes cross-hatching, cross-hatched triangles, bands and, rarely, squiggly/wavy lines and concentric circles or semicircles over added white (figs 31-32). A variant group has a red slip with added white and black, rather than a white slip with added red and black (subgroup 3A); the fabrics range from yellowish-red 5YR 5/6 and 5/8 to brown 7.5YR 5/4 or light red 2.5YR 6/8 or red 2.5YR 5/8, with many medium and small white inclusions (fig. 33). There is a further subgroup with a distinctive thick pink slip with similar fabric colour and inclusion ranges (subgroup 3G; fig. 34). Shapes include large vessels (mostly in the red-slip class), including deep bowls and jugs, and smaller, finer-walled cups and bowls (in the pink- and white-slip classes; it is unclear how diagnostically signif icant this observation may be). This group had a long life-span during the Iron Age, originating during the late ninth century (for example, Caria: Özgünel 2006) and continuing in some places into the seventh and early sixth centuries (Coulton forthcoming b: section d, with refer ences; French forthcoming; the technique continues in wares such as Ephesian Ware, a later sixth century class of thickly slipped vessels with a very fine grain and smooth surface, in which the principal decoration is t white slip white slip qui v i «• i Fig. 31.

Imported western Anatolian thick pink-slipped wares executed in a dark, matt paint that is thick enough to be palpable by touch, although stylistically its motifs are closer to the Wild Goat repertoire: Greenewalt 1973). Without stratified contexts, we are unable to date our assemblage more precisely. We have a notable group of black-on-red examples from medium/fine- and fine-walled vessels, including a possible pilgrim flask or similar form and plates decorated with geometric motifs (fig. 35). The fabric of the thin-walled examples is reddish-yellow (5YR 6/6— 6/8) and very fine, with no or very few visible inclusions. The surface has a matt red slip with matt black decoration. The more medium-walled vessels have a yellowish-red (5YR 5/6-5/8) fabric with a medium number of coarse inclusions, and with some medium sized and fine-sized white and black inclusions. The Fig. 35. Imported black-on-red wares most coarse examples belong to large vessels and have a red to yellowish-red (2.5YR 5/8 to 5YR 5/8) fabric with some large white and grey inclusions, and bits of visible quartz. Elsewhere, such examples, especially the fine and medium-walled vessels, are dated to a horizon between the eighth and seventh centuries. Sporadic fine walled and semi-fine-walled black-on-red examples have been found at a number of sites in western Anatolia, such as Gordion, Sardis, Ephesus (Sardis and Ephesus: Greenewalt 1973: 144, n.22, with references; Gordion: Schaus 1992: no. 22) and elsewhere (for example Kilise Tepe: Hansen, Postgate 2007: 360, n.813; Akalan: Cummer 1976: nos 16-18), including along the Xanthus river and along the southern coast (Tlos, Pinara, Xanthus, Patara, Kaç: French forthcoming, with references). Indeed, a plate or dish fragment from our group, with black bands of differing widths on the interior and exterior, and where a set of bands on the exterior is joined by a squiggle, finds a close parallel in an example from Gordion (fig. 35F; cf. Schaus 1992: no. 22). As our examples belong to subgroup 3A (see below, 'Ceramic petrography'), production is more likely to be from closer to home, perhaps Rhodes (for example, Cook, Dupont 1998: 19-20) or the Anatolian mainland itself (for example, Greenewalt 1973: 114), rather than Cilicia, Cyprus or the Near East, although imports from the eastern Mediterranean cannot be ruled out entirely. We have one definite example of Phrygian pottery, and at least one possible further example. The former is a body sherd from a large, closed vessel (fig. 36B). Its fabric is yellowish-red (5YR 5/8) and has many small and medium white inclusions. The surface is slipped with a very thick cream-coloured slip (pale yellow 2.5Y 8/2). The decorative motifs include a cross-hatched panel in a frieze zone with vertical bands in the zone underneath, which are common among the ornate class of brown on buff at Gordion during the late eighth and early seventh centuries (panel motif: Young 1957: 328, pi. 94.27; 1981 : 36, pi. 176; cross-hatching with rays: Sams 1994: no. 930, see also 165-73, 192; DeVries 2005: fig. 4.8). A twisted handle has fabric and stylistic similarities to examples from Gordion, as well (fig. 36A). The fabric is pale yellow 2.5Y 8/3, with medium-sized white and black inclusions, and air holes, suggesting organic temper. Phrygian stylistic influence may well have extended into regional output during this time. A rim sherd from Çaltilar, of a fabric that was considered local prior to the distinctions highlighted by pétrographie analysis (yellowish-red 5YR 5/6-5/8 fabric with a medium number of large white inclusions, and some medium sized and fine white as well as darker black inclusions; further study of the fabric of this example is now necessary), has a decorative motif of a grid with a dot in 92</page><page sequence="33">Momigliano, Greaves, Hodos, Aksoy, Brown, Kibaroglu and Carter Fig. 36. Phrygian wares: diagnostic handle and body sherd the centre of each grid square in matt black paint (fig. 25D). This motif is similar to examples produced at Gordion (for example, Boardman 1999: fig. 94) but also manufactured in other regions at the fringes of Phrygian interest and influence (for example, Kilise Tepe: Postgate, Thomas 2007: no. 813). A discrete group of burnished grey ware has also been identified (fig. 37), which falls into pétrographie subgroup 2D (see below, 'Ceramic petrography'). While this may be more regional, it may also be another class of import from (north)western Anatolia, since the region was a known producer of grey wares during the Iron Age (Bayne 2000). It is equally plausible that this may represent another class of Phrygian pottery. Grey wares became the predominant core of the local pottery industry of Gordion from the tenth century to the Hellenistic period, constituting between 80% and 85% during the Early Phrygian (950-800 BC) and Middle Phrygian (800-540 BC) phases (Henrickson 2005). Phrygian influence extended into Lycia during the Iron Age, as evidenced by Phrygian-style tomb painting and Phrygian silver in the neighbouring Elmali plain (Mellink 1976), so it should not be surprising to find pottery, as well; that such pottery has not been observed before is more likely due to the fact that few contexts of such a date have been recovered in Lycia (for most recent discussion of Phyrgian evidence in Lycia, with references, see Coulton forthcoming b: section d). Several examples can be identified as so-called bird bowls, a group often associated with seventh century Rhodes but now known to have several production centres along the western Anatolian littoral and islands (for example, Kerschner at al. 1993; Özgünel 2006: 81-86). Our examples are all of the same very fine brown (7.5YR 5/3) fabric with no visible inclusions (fig. 38A). They have the characteristic lustrous black glaze on the interior and exterior, and remains of the top of the frieze zone, although not enough is preserved of any of our sherds to illustrate the animal figures that are associated with this group. Fig. 3 7. Imported grey wares Fig. 38. Imported wares: (A) western Anatolian bird bowl; (B-D) Protocorinthian and Corinthian wares; (E) Euboean body sherd 93</page><page sequence="34">Anatolian Studies 2011 We have a number of examples that originate in Corinth, most of which are small body sherds. Some examples probably belong to the Corinthian Late Geometric phase (750-720 BC: recently DeVries 2003: 141) (fig. 38B), judging by their fabric (pink 5YR 7.4), which is slightly less refined than the subsequent, more yellow Protocorinthian (ca 720-680 BC) wares. Our Protocorinthian examples fall within the standard fabric descriptions for Corinthian products of this period (light brown to light yellowish-brown, 7.5YR 6/4 10YR 6/4, fine fabric with no visible inclusions). They all appear to belong to open shapes, either plates or kotyle-shaped bowls with quite straight-sided walls (fig. 38C-D). We also have an example that appears to be Euboean (fig. 38E). Its fabric colour ranges from reddish-yellow (5YR 6/6) to yellowish-red (5YR 5/6), while the texture is fine but with some large and medium white inclu sions. Its surface treatment includes a very pale brown (10YR 8/3) slip and matt brown/black painted decoration. The style of the execution is very reminiscent of Euboean: two cross-hatched triangles with a band across the top and an uncertain, possibly anthropomorphic, figure. Late Iron Age. Material datable to the late seventh and sixth centuries is also quite abundant. Fabrics of this period, in general, appear to the naked eye as identical to those employed in the previous phases, but with few, if any, tiny white inclusions. Vessels are often thin- or medium-walled and are usually slipped. Very few closed vessel forms have been recognised and, in contrast, there appears to be a notable predominance of fine table wares. Shapes include a variety of cup forms as well as larger vessels such as mixing shapes (akin to the krater and dinos/lebes forms of the Greek repertoire) and serving vessels (such as so-called fruit stands) indicated by both rim (fig. 39) and base varieties (including pedestal, ring and flat base forms), and handle types (fig. 40). The diffi culties noted above in dating the assemblage are most apparent in the often fragmentary fine ware rims and some bases, many of which might as easily find parallels in terms of form in sixth century BC wares (for example, figs 39A, D, G, I, J, 40L; cf. Utili 1999: fig. 6) as they would with Early and Middle Iron Age examples (cf. Lemos 2002: figs 63-66; Aytaçlar 2004: fig. 16; Ersoy 2004: fig. 3). As previously, fabrics considered local through macro scopic study in fact have a variety of origins (subgroups 2D, 2G, 3A, 3G; see below, 'Ceramic petrography') if ^7 r T 1 »SSVSSSS s s N IN08.0104 j / I ? o Fig. 39. Late Iron Age so-called local wares: rims and diagnostic body sherds 94</page><page sequence="35">Momigliano, Greaves, Hodos, Aksoy, Brown, Kibaroglu and Carter I o Fig. 40. Late Iron Age so-called local wares: diagnostic handle and base sherds A distinctive fine ware group with a grey core that fires to red at the exterior surface is a clear import (fig. 41). The fabric is gley 1 6/ and 5/ gray and has no visible inclusions. This group is often slipped with a streaky brown slip, although the surface might also sometimes have a black slip. Pétrographie analysis links this to a clay group that originates most probably in central western Anatolia (subgroup 3E). While it is difficult to reconstruct precisely the shapes of the vessels belonging to this group, we can determine that open and closed shapes were part of the repertoire, and bases include both flat and ring types. We also have an example of Lydian Marbled Ware (fig. 42). This describes a distinctive method of decoration whereby a multiple brush was pressed down so that the brush marks overlapped and wiggled to deposit the slip/glaze (usually dilute black iron-oxide paint) matter unevenly in wiggly bands to create a marbling effect (Greenewalt 1978: 38; Kerschner 2005: 136-37, pl. 10.5-6). Its output appears to be restricted to the sixth century. Our example is a rim sherd from an open vessel. The fabric is light yellowish-brown (10YR Fig. 41. Late Iron Age imported fine ware group with grey core 95</page><page sequence="36">Anatolian Studies 2011 Fig. 42. Lydian Marbled Ware rim sherd 6/4), fine and with few medium-sized black inclusions. The interior and exterior of the vessel appear to have a burnished slip that is very pale brown (10YR 7/4). The rim, which has a slight ridge, is decorated with a matt black band that extends over the rim to be a band along the top of the interior of the vessel. The exterior is decorated with four vertical bands that were disarticu lated to produce a kind of tortoiseshell or rippling effect. Probably from Chios comes a fragment of a chalice form decorated with a cable pattern (fig. 43). Its fabric (yellowish-red 5YR 5/6 with some medium-sized black inclusions and slightly larger white inclusions) is coated with a thick slip (very pale brown 10YR 7/4) on the exterior and watery black glaze on the interior (cf. Cook, Dupont 1998: 46—47). The cable motif is executed in a dark brown/black matt paint. The shape of the sherd and motifs suggest that this piece derives from the curved handle zone of the typical Chian 'chalice' vessel form, probably dating between the late seventh and sixth century BC (for example, Lemos 1991: 8-13). While a double guilloche pattern is typical, especially during later seventh century examples, the 'eyes' of our example are unusual. We also have evidence of Attic imports, but these are only body sherds of closed vessels with the characteristic iridescent black glaze of Attic wares of this period (not illustrated). We lack clear indications of Attic black figure and red-figure wares. Fig. 43. Late Iron Age Chian chalice body sherd with guilloche decoration We have a number of examples for which manufac turing provenance cannot be identified but the shapes and decorative motifs are associated with so-called oriental ising classes, which have a temporal horizon between the late eighth and early sixth centuries. One such example is the body sherd of a large closed vessel decorated with vertical rows of gradually elongating outlines of tongues or feathers in matt black that are filled with alternating matt black and purple-red paint (the fabric is light brown 7.5YR 6/4, while the surface is very pale brown 10YR 7/4; the sherd is grey at the interior wall of the vessel and contains some medium-sized brown, black and white inclusions, and a few red inclusions: fig. 44A). Parallels for such polychrome feather-like motifs can be found in Proto corinthian to later black-figure wares and in East Greek products of the same chronological span (for example, Pottier 1922: pis 3, 6, 7; 1933: pis 2, 16, 77, 79; Lambrino 1928: pis 11, 27; Kunisch 1971: 24-25, pi. 164; Descoeudres 1981: 66-67, no. 20.3^1; Boulter, Luckner 1984: 5-6, no. 69.1-2). Our examples of animal motifs include an ear depicted in the form of a coffee bean (fig. 44B; pale brown 10YR 6/3 fabric with some medium white inclusions, very pale brown 10YR 7/4 surface); part of a bichrome griffin head with half of a swastika filling ornament (fig. 44C; light brown 7.5YR 6/4 fabric with few medium white inclusions, the surface is 7.5YR 6/4 and very 5cm Fig. 44.

We also have a number of fine table wares, primarily plates and bowls, that are decorated with monochrome or bichrome bands (figs 45, 46B) and occasionally other motifs, such as a broken meander (fig 46C-D) or a connected lozenge (fig. 46A). The fabric is often very fine and has no visible inclusions, although in larger vessels occasional medium-sized red inclusions and few very small white inclusions may appear. The fabrics range in colour from reddish-yellow to strong brown (7.5YR 6/6— 5/6) to pale brown (10YR 6/3) to reddish-yellow (5YR 6/8); the surface colour may be reddish-yellow (5YR 6/6) or pink (7.5 YR 7/4). Many of these are related to group 3 (subgroups 3A, 3E and 3G; see below, 'Ceramic petrog raphy'), suggesting an origin from considerably far away. Later pottery In addition to the ceramic assemblage above, a small number of sherds and tile fragments dating to between the Hellenistic and Islamic periods has been identified. These represent less than 0.06% of our total assemblage. They are insufficient in quantity to suggest occupation at the site during these periods, although they do indicate a local awareness of the mound as an elevated area over the ages. They may be the residue from manuring by a nearby settlement, used when the höyük was no longer occupied and started to be cultivated. 97</page><page sequence="38">Anatolian Studies 2011 Ceramic petrography Aims and methodology. Pétrographie thin section analysis is a powerful analytical method, widely applied in ceramics studies, which allows the grouping of specimens according to similar microscopic features, the identification of possible geological sources of the raw materials, the reconstruction of production technologies, technological variations over time and space, and so the choice strategies concerning raw materials (Riederer 2004; Reedy 2008). These data, in turn, can yield valuable information about certain socio-economic aspects of ancient societies. This section presents the results of the pétrographie analysis of 104 sherds collected from Çaltilar (or, more precisely, 103 sherds and one mud-brick fragment). The samples comprise various ware types, dating from the Late Chalcolithic to the Late Iron Age periods. In addition, two samples from Early Bronze Age sherds from Hacimusalar were included in the analyses, for comparative purposes. The analyses focused primarily on the characterisation of the raw materials, i.e. the identification of rock and mineral fragments and fabric features, which define different clay sources and help to determine their provenance. The principal aim of these analyses was to characterise petrographically a number of macroscopically defined ceramic wares (for example, red burnished and white painted ware, black-on-red ware, etc.) and other classes of pottery (for example, pithoi, mud-brick), some of which were suspected to be 'local', while others appeared to be imports. In other words, in our study we focused on two key questions. (1) Can we identify and characterise petrographically 'local' pottery production/consumption at Çaltilar, in the sense of production/consumption of pottery whose fabric composition is compatible with the geology of the area? (2) Can we identify and characterise imported ceramics, with respect to provenance and technological traditions? In addition to the aforementioned 106 samples (104 from Çaltilar and two from Hacimusalar), we also collected a total of 18 'reference' clay samples, taken from the young unconsolidated sediment deposits from Çaltilar basin (seven samples), Seki (five samples), Sögüt (four samples) and Gölhisar (two samples) (see fig. 47 and table 1). The clays are fine, or partly very fine with high plasticity; for example, clay samples C-l to C-3 from Çaltilar are suitable for pottery making. Since they are unconsolidated materials, all clay samples were first fired at a constant temperature of 750-800°C to obtain a ceramic-like hardness and then thin sections were prepared akin to the sherds. Additionally, one thin section was also prepared from sands collected from a riverbed close to Çaltilar. Both sherds and reference clay samples were examined in thin section using plane and cross-polarised light using a standard pétrographie microscope to charac terise the individual rock and mineral inclusions, grain size, their distribution in the matrix (serial or hiatal distri bution), their quantity (as percentage) and other textural and structural features. The percentage of the rock and mineral inclusions as well as pores in the sherds were estimated using the comparison chart of Rice (1987: 348). The grain sizes were measured using an eyepiece micrometer. The results were then compared with the geology of the region and the microscopic observations of the reference clay samples. The results of microscopic observations are presented as fabric groups (and subgroups), and each group is discussed with respect to predominant inclusion types, clay groundmass and raw material provenance. This work has enabled us to identify a wide number of pétrographie groups and subgroups, which are described in more detail below, after a brief discussion of the geological setting of our site. Geological setting of Çaltilar. Çaltilar is located geolog ically in the so-called Lycian Nappes (sheet-like masses of rocks that have moved large distances on sub horizontal surfaces) (fig. 48). The rocks clustered into the Lycian Nappes consist of different types originating during the long-standing tectonic regime and are exposed across a large area of southwest Anatolia, enclosed between the Menderes massif in the north and the Mesozoic Age Bey Daglan thick limestone sedimentary rocks (Collins, Robertson 1997; 1998; Robertson 2000). They are divided into three tectonic units: (1) the 'Lycian Thrust Sheets', composed mainly of Mesozoic to Early Tertiary carbonates with radiolarian cherts, shales and Paleogene clastic rocks; (2) the Lycian Mélange, thick chaotic lithologies, interpreted as an accretionary prism related to the subduction of Mesozoic Neotethyan oceanic crust (Robertson 1998), comprising serpentinite, gabbro, basaltic rocks, radiolarite cherts and limestone, and clastic sediments (Danelian et al. 2006); (3) the 'Lycian Ophiolites', dominantly composed of serpen tinised peridotites, related to the Cretaceous Neotethyan oceanic lithosphere that formed above a subduction zone (Robertson 1998; 2000). In the surrounding area of Çaltilar and its vicinity are exposed predominantly ultramafic rocks of peridotite and serpentinite of the Lycian Ophiolites and the Lycian Mélange (fig. 49). There are also relatively small limestone blocks enclosed in the Lycian Mélange, outcropped in the northwest and southeast parts of the basin.

On the basis of the inclusion types, their quantity and overall fabric features, the sherds can be divided into four major groups, corresponding to three main geological zones and one undetermined zone, and encom passing most of the selected sherds. The four major groups can be divided into further subgroups, on the basis of more detailed pétrographie descriptions. The litho logical types of the main inclusions and general paste features enable us to reconstruct the main source rocks from which the clays used in pottery making were derived, and to assign them to broadly defined source regions. These major groups and subgroups are discussed below. Group 1 (serpentinite group). Samples: A total of 28 samples could be assigned to this group. With the exception of one Iron Age rim, they all date to the Late Chalcolithic to Early Bronze Age, and belong to a variety of wares.

The characteristic feature of this group is the presence of a large amount of serpentinite fragments either as large grains or fine silt size inclusions in the matrix, which suggests that the clays were predominantly derived from serpentinite and/or its unaltered equivalent, namely peridotite rocks. Further inclusions are chert and micritic limestone, and to a lesser extent (1-2%) quartz, calcite, pyroxene, olivine, chlorite and plagioclase. The grains are usually sub-rounded, partly angular, fine sand sized, 101</page><page sequence="42">Anatolian Studies 2011 but single grains can reach up to 1-1.5mm in diameter. Most samples (ca 75%) show serial grain distribution in the matrix, and some show well-sorted fine inclusions, suggesting that they are natural in origin. However, ca 25% of the samples show hiatal distribution, including large fragments (for example, CT-14, CT-19). This suggests that their raw clay was tempered during paste preparation. The clay paste is generally dark, black in colour under the polarised light. Some samples (for example, CT-16, CT-8, CT-104) display a so-called sandwich-like structure - bright outer margins and dark core: this is most probably the result of firing in a reducing atmosphere with an oxidising cooling stage. Provenance: The group-specific main inclusion - serpentinite - plays a key role in establishing the prove nance of the wares of the group. As discussed above, the main geology of Çaltilar and its surrounding area is dominated by serpentinite/peridotite and, to a lesser extent, by limestone and chert (fig. 49). This suggests that the clay source(s) of this group is (are) located somewhere within this geological zone, for example Çaltilar, Seki, Gölhisar or in their vicinity. This is also supported by pétrographie analysis of the clay reference samples from Çaltilar, Seki, Gölhisar and Sögüt. On the whole, we can regard the samples assigned to this group as representative of 'local' production, in the sense indicated above, of pottery that appears to be common at Çaltilar and whose fabric is compatible with the local geology. Subgroups: On the basis of the proportion of the main inclusions, and additional inclusions besides serpentinite in the clay matrix, group 1 can be subdivided into six subgroups as indicated in tables 2 and 3. Subgroup 1A: This is the largest subgroup (20 samples, plus a piece of burnt mud-brick) and is charac terised by a high quantity of rounded and sub-rounded main inclusions (up to 25%), overall low clay quality (silty clay paste) and moderate grain size (except for single large grains up to 1,5mm in diameter) compared to the other subgroups. There are also minor inclusions (1 2%) of quartz, calcite, pyroxene, olivine, chlorite and plagioclase (fig. 50A). Subgroup IB: This comprises only sample CT-19, which is very similar to subgroup 1A, but contains additionally well-rounded mudstone fragments. Subgroup 1C: This comprises only sample CT-150, which is made from fine clay and predominantly contains serpentinite that is high-grade altered and chert. It also shows a similarity to the reference clay samples from Çaltilar and Seki. Subgroup ID: This comprises only sample CT-10. Besides the group 1 specific inclusions, this contains quartz sandstone inclusions (3 4%), a higher proportion of quartz, calcite (4%) and clay mineral. The grains are well sorted (serial) and it has a compact clay paste. Some coarse inclusions (quartz sandstone, serpentinite) reach up to 1.5mm in diameter. It is not clear whether these coarse inclusions were added deliberately during manufacture, since the grains show no clear hiatal distri bution in the matrix. Subgroup IE: This group comprises three samples taken from large storage jars (two macroscopically assigned to the Early Bronze Age and one possibly to the Late Bronze Age). The subgroup is characterised by a high amount of serpentinite fragments, up to 30-35%, also represented in the matrix. The fragments are very angular and are comparable with the clay source used for modern ceramics in Esenköy/Dont. Subgroup IF: This comprises only sample CT-117, whose main inclusions are chert and serpentinite fragments, both in large quantities. There are no other inclusions, such as micritic limestone or quartz. Group 2 (marly clay group). Samples: The 25 samples assigned to this group present considerable temporal and typological variations, covering all main phases of occupation identified at the site and a wide variety of wares. General characteristics: The characteristic features of this group are its derivation from calcareous rocks and the absence of serpentinite and metamorphic rocks. Due to the calcareous nature of the source rocks, the clays show Fig. 50.

However, the wares classified into this major group are not entirely homogeneous in terms of their pétrographie features and can be assigned to various subgroups, suggesting the exploitation of different clay sources, albeit all located within a geological region dominated by calcareous rocks. Most of the inclusions (ca 74%) show serial distri bution, suggesting that they are natural in origin. About 24% of the samples (six specimens), however, contain large grains that show hiatal distribution (for example, CT-32, CT-34), suggesting that they were deliberately added by the potter. 103</page><page sequence="44">Anatolian Studies 2011 Provenance: The main inclusion types and general marly clay nature, lack of serpentinite and low amount of chert indicate that the clay in this group does not originate in Çaltilar, Seki or their vicinity. This inference is also supported by analytical data from the reference clay samples from Çaltilar, Seki, Sögüt and Gölhisar. The Elmali plain, where the geology of the surrounding area predominantly consists of calcareous rocks and a lack of large serpentinite outcrops (cf. figs 47, 49), is potentially the location of such marly clay deposits. However, other regions where the main geology consists of calcareous rocks, such as the eastern part of Sögüt, offer other possibilities. It is therefore difficult to identify with absolute certainty the prove nance of the wares belonging to group 2. Although Elmali is the most likely option, further analyses of reference samples and ceramics are needed to reach more reliable conclusions. Subgroups: On the basis of the proportion of main inclusions, group 2 can be subdivided as detailed in tables 4 and 5. Subgroup 2A: Samples CT-29, CT-31, CT-32, CT-33 and CT-49 show a similar clay paste (generally silty and rich in silt-sized clasts) and type of inclusions (quartz sandstone, quartz, micritic limestone and chert). Subgroup 2B: Sample CT-5 contains inclusions similar to those in subgroup 2A, but very low micritic limestone grains and high quantities of quartz sandstone fragments. Subgroup 2C: Sample CT-30 contains inclusions similar to those in subgroup 2A, but in addition shows large calcite fragments and some of these fragments contain small quartz grains. Subgroup 2D: This subgroup includes micritic limestone and chert (3-6%), both polycrystalline and monocrystalline quartz in low quantity (ca 1%; fig. 50B). Group Subgroup Sample no.

Subgroup 2F: Samples CT-7, CT-107 and CT-108 all belong to the Early Bronze Age red burnished ware with white painted decoration: the first is from our site, the other two from Hacimusalar. They are characterised by a fine clay paste with a low amount of angular, small micritic limestone inclusions and polycrystalline quartz grains. The clay material seems to be derived predomi nantly from micritic limestone. Under the microscope one can see very fine micritic limestone particles embedded in the clay matrix (for example, fig. 50D). Subgroup 2G: The samples of this group are charac terised by a high amount of micritic limestone (4-7%), chert (ca 4-6%), sandstone, single slate, mudstone and calcite. There is also a red-coloured high-grade altered iron-rich mineral in minor quantity. Group 3 (metamorphic group). Samples: This group comprises 50 samples and like the previous one also presents considerable temporal and typological varia tions, covering all main phases of occupation identified at the site and a wide variety of wares, but mostly pertaining to the Iron Age. General characteristics: The group's main character istic is the presence of inclusions such as slate and gneiss like metamorphic rocks, combined with an absence of serpentinite. Further inclusions are micritic limestone, chert and quartz. In 82% of the samples the inclusions show mostly serial distribution in the clay matrix, suggesting that they are natural in origin. In addition, ca 35% were produced from very pure clay that was well levigated during production. However, ca 17% show hiatal grain distribution, suggesting tempering during paste preparation processes. Provenance: The types of inclusion and general matrix features suggest that the clay sources for group 3 were derived from predominantly slate/gneiss or similar metamorphic rocks. This and the absence of serpentinite suggest that the wares of this group were not produced in Çaltilar, Seki, Gölhisar or Sögüt, and this inference is also supported by pétrographie analysis of the reference samples. Metamorphic rocks are known in the western part of Denizli, and in the more western region of the so-called Menderes massif (fig. 51). Subgroups: According to the main inclusion types, their proportion in the clay matrix and general fabric features, we can identify many subgroups. Although the main inclusions originated from metamorphic rock and can be assigned to the broad geological zone mentioned above, the variations among the subgroups suggest that they were produced from different clays occurring within the main geological zone. The general characteristics of the subgroups are described in tables 6 and 7. Subgroup 3A: This is characterised by high amounts of large slate inclusions. The clay paste consists of small muscovite flakes of metamorphic source. Further inclu sions are polycrystalline quartz (both large and silt-sized fragments) in the matrix. Subgroup 3B: This contains inclusions similar to subgroup 2A, but with higher quantities of micritic limestone and chert. The clay paste also contains a higher proportion of micritic limestone fragments than subgroup 2A. This suggests that the wares belonging to this group were produced from different clay sources, which were, nevertheless, located within the same broad geological zone (fig. 52A). Subgroup 3C: Sample CT-44 is close to subgroup 3A, but contains some inclusions of high-grade altered mafic minerals, maybe derived from peridotite or gabbro. 105</page><page sequence="46">Anatolian Studies 2011 38' 00' —37* 30* If AEGEAN SEA Alluvium Neogene deposits Regional strike and dtp Normal fault A Thrust fault 20 40km LYCIAN NAPPES BORNOVA FLYSCH ZONE EZH3 CYCLADIC METAMORPHIC COMPLEX MENDERES MASSIF Paleocene Metasandstone slate, calciturtoidite Mesozotc Marble (Milas Marble) Permo-Carbon.

All photomicrographs were taken with cross-polarised light Subgroup 3D: Sample CT-46 is also similar to subgroup 3A, but contains large amounts of polycrys talline quartz grains, which were obviously derived from gneiss. Its general clay paste is silty and comprises silt sized quartz grains and muscovite flakes (fig. 52B). Subgroup 3E: This subgroup is characterised by very low quantities of microscopically visible inclusions and a very fine clay paste. Small grains, which are microscop ically identifiable, are quartz and some small slate fragments. In the matrix there are small mineral fragments, which appear to be muscovite flakes. Obviously, the raw clay of this subgroup has been well levigated. Subgroup 3F: The main inclusions are micritic limestone, chert, quartz, slate and quartz sandstone. The relative amount of inclusions and overall fabric features allow the two samples CT-22 and CT-28 to be clustered in this subgroup. Subgroup 3G: Besides the group-specific metamorphic inclusions and muscovite flakes, this subgroup contains mafic minerals such as pyroxene and olivine, showing moderate to high-grade alteration. 106</page><page sequence="47">Momigliano, Greaves, Hodos, Aksoy, Brown, Kibaroglu and Carter Group Subgroup Sample no.

Further inclusions are slate and single micritic limestone and pyroxene fragments. The clay is very silty, mainly derived from gneiss and chert. Subgroup 3J: Sample CT-112's main inclusions are polycrystalline quartz, muscovite (6%) and single micritic limestone. The clay matrix consists of small folded and colourful muscovite flake structures, which is clear evidence of its metamorphic origin. Group 4 (undetermined). This group includes a small number of samples that cannot easily be placed into any of the other three groups and main geological areas. The two subgroups are not related to each other (table 8). Subgroup 4A: Two samples, CT-36 and CT-37, macroscopically assigned to a class of pottery named Chalcolithic/Early Bronze Age gritty ware, show sharp differences from the other clay groups and subgroups discussed above. They are characterised by an unusually high proporation of chert inclusions (ca 20-25%) and a pure clay paste (low silt particles as part of the matrix) (fig. 52C). The grain size of the chert varies from silt-size to large grains up to 1.5mm in diameter. The small grains are generally rounded and sub-rounded, whereas the large ones are angular. This suggests tempering processes during pottery manufacture. Concerning the provenance, the high quantity of chert inclusions suggests that the clay was derived from chert-rich sedimentary rocks. One of the clay reference samples collected in Seki (SEK-4) shows pétrographie features similar to CT-36 and CT-37. Chert sediments are distributed widely in the region around our site, and very close to Çaltilar itself there are massif chert outcrops. A local origin therefore seems quite likely. Subgroup 4B: Sample CT-43 is characterised by silty clay and a dark coloured paste; typical inclusions are basaltic rock fragments with grain size ranging from ca 0.25mm to 1mm in diameter. Other inclusions are quartz fragments, chert, micritic limestone and plagioclase fragments that seem to be derived from basalt; there are also minor quartz sandstone and mudstone fragments (fig. 52D). This suggests that the clay deposit is an alteration product of predominantly basaltic rocks, partly calcareous rocks and quartz sandstone. Grains show serial and sub-serial distribution, and suggest that the raw clay was not tempered. Regarding provenance, we can observe that basaltic rocks are exposed in the south eastern part of the Sögüt basin, suggesting that this could be a potential source for this group, although more inves tigations, and especially more reference samples from this specific area, are needed in order to reach firmer conclusions.

Pétrographie group 4 108</page><page sequence="49">Momigliano, Greaves, Hodos, Aksoy, Brown, Kibaroglu and Carter In conclusion, the preliminary results of our thin section analysis show that a very wide number of clay sources (at least a dozen) derived from three broad geological zones are represented at our site. Two of these broad zones, and consequently many of the pétrographie subgroups, are not 'local'. For the Chalcolithic period, most of the pottery appears to be of local production, but in the Early Bronze Age we have clear evidence of numerous imports from probably the Elmali plain as well as the Denizli/Menderes massif area, and wider connections are also shown by the imported obsidian discussed below. All the samples of potential second millennium ceramics (red-slipped and grey wares, CT-22, CT-24, CT-28-33) appear to have been imported to Çaltilar, but given the overall scarcity of second millennium material, as collected from the site, this result should be treated with extreme caution, if used at all. In other words, it would be premature to conclude from this limited evidence that all the pottery of this period was necessarily imported to our site, since it is possible that, accidentally, no 'local' second millennium ceramics have been selected for sampling. For the Iron Age, however, there is very clear evidence for imports from even wider areas, as shown by both macroscopic and microscopic analyses, which have interesting implications for the history and nature of the settlement during this period, discussed further in the final section of this article. Lithics (chipped stone and obsidian sourcing study) Techno-typological attributes One piece of obsidian and 116 of chipped stone were collected by the Çaltilar survey, of which 20 were selected for publication (figs 53-57): of these, most (19) come in the form of broken prismatic blades of chert. Significantly, almost half (eight) of these chert blades were denticulated, i.e. retouched along one or both margins with multiple notches to produce a saw-like edge, while a further three had clear traces of macro scopic gloss on their edges (for example, fig. 53). The combination of denticulation with intensive-use polish suggests strongly that these blades were specifically being used as sickle elements; some of the wider examples may in fact have been inserted into wooden boards as part of a threshing sledge, a farming technology now claimed to have been in use in Anatolia and the Near East since Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (eighth millennium BC; Anderson 2006). While most of the assemblage illustrated here is comprised of end products, there are two pieces that attest a certain amount of on-site knapping. The first is the base of a small, pressure-flaked obsidian blade core, that had been worked around its entire circumference (fig. 54), the second is a core tablet (platform rejuvenation flake) from a blade core of an orange variegated chert (fig. 55). Fig. 53. Chert blade showing macroscopic gloss on edge Dating At present there is little that can be said with confidence as to the date of the chipped stone, as unipolar chert blade production is something that we associate with sites of Neolithic, Chalcolithic and Bronze Age date in Anatolia and neighbouring regions. More specific dating could be accorded the material if we had larger sample numbers, greater technological detail (as evidenced through proximal sections) and/or more distinctive retouched tool types; for the meantime it is probably safe to argue that most of these finds should be associated with the Late Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age occupation periods at Çaltilar. The obsidian blade core could also date anywhere from the Late Neolithic to Middle Bronze Age, being analogous in technology and scale to what one views at sites in the Lake District such as Late Neolithic Höyücek (Balkan-Atli 2005: pi. 199), and the Late Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age sites of Bakla Tepe and Liman Tepe on the western Anatolian coast (for example, Kolankaya Bostanci 2006; 2007), and further to the west in the Aegean (for example, Carter 2009). As for the sickle/threshing sledge elements, the production and circulation of these implements has a very long history, spanning the Aceramic Neolithic until modern times in the eastern Mediterranean, not least during the third millennium BC, as with the trade of Canaanean blades in the Levant and Anatolia (for example, Kardulias, Yerkes 1996; Anderson et al. 2004). Raw materials While local sources of chert are reported, the evidence - perhaps surprisingly - does not indicate the on-site reduction of true raw materials, given that the assem blage (including the pieces not illustrated here) lacks 109</page><page sequence="50">Anatolian Studies 2011 IN08.0021 3cm Fig. 54. Pressure-flaked obsidian blade core Fig. 55. Core tablet (platform rejuvenation flake) nodules, cortical debris and/or preformed cores. The assemblage structure thus suggests that these cherts were primarily worked at source, with only end products tending to be brought to the site. The range of colours and textures amongst the chert artefacts might also suggest that a number of different raw materials are represented within the Çaltilar assemblage. Where these other siliceous resources came from is not entirely clear; this is a not uncommon problem for archaeolo gists working in Anatolia given the lack of dedicated research on chert sourcing and the fact that supplies of workable stone are likely to be found throughout the larger region, not least within the massive l,000km-long karstic range of the Taurus mountains (for example, Bezic 2007). The assemblage did, however, contain a blade-like flake of a dull red radiolarite (fig. 56), a distinctive and relatively geologically restricted raw material that quite conceivably comes from outcrops along the banks of the Göksu and Burhan rivers in the Antalya region. This is one of the mainstay resources exploited by the inhabitants of the Öküzini Cave from the Epi-Palaeolithic to Late Chalcolithic (Pawlikowski 2002), with small quantities then being used at distance in the Konya plain by the Aceramic Neolithic to Early Chalcolithic community at Çatalhôyiik (Carter et al. 2005). As for the various other cherts (fig. 57), there are again a number of pieces whose colour and texture (grey, matt/coarse; tan/grey fine; tan/mottled, orange variegated inter alia) are also highly reminiscent of raw materials used for blade manufacture from Çatalhôyûk into the Early Chalcolithic (sixth millennium BC). Here these materials are exotic; one thus might wonder if the source region for these cherts lies somewhere between the Konya plain and Çaltilar, either in the Lake District, where the chipped stone assemblages of prehistoric sites are dominated by local cherts (for example, Höyücek and Kuraçay Höyük: Baykal-Seeher 1994) and/or within the westernmost extension of the Taurus. In truth, a great deal more work needs to be done on the question of chert sourcing, commencing with a detailed geo-archaeological characterisation of those materials local to Çaltilar itself, following such work as that undertaken by the Göksu Survey (Newhard et al. 2008). The obsidian sourcing study The one piece we can assign a source to with certainty is the obsidian blade core, having non-destructively charac terised the raw material at the McMaster Archaeological XRF Lab (MAX Lab) using a ThermoScientific Quant'X energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (EDXRF; for instrument configuration and data collection methods, see details in Poupeau et al. 2010: 2711).

Bellot-Gurlet et al. 2008; Poupeau et al. 2010). Trace element intensities were converted to concentration estimates through reference to various standards, including those certified by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) (table 9). In a Sr/Zr vs Rb/Zr bivariate contents plot (fig. 58), the Çaltilar core's elemental signature clearly matches that of geological samples from Nenezi Dag in southern Cappadocia, some 460km to the northeast (Poidevin 1998: 121-22). This is one of the two major obsidian sources of central Anatolia (along with East Göllü Dag), whose products were exploited at distance from the Epi Palaeolithic onwards and used by communities throughout Anatolia, Cyprus and the Levant (Chataigner 1998: 285-87; Carter et al. in prep.). For the Chalcolithic onwards we know slightly less about this source's history and directionality of exploitation, arguably the result of a research bias in characterisation studies towards Neolithic assemblages. That said, recent work has documented tiny quantities of this obsidian in Late Chalcolithic (fourth millennium) strata at both the Öküzini Cave (Carter et al. in prep.), 100km to the east of Çaltilar, and at Aphrodisias (Blackman 1986), 110km to the northwest, while more recently a few Nenezi Dag products were identified in Early Bronze Age II deposits at Malia on Crete, the furthest westerly find-spot of this material (Bellot-Gurlet et al. 2008). Other materials Our site has yielded a number of other finds, which are tabulated in fig. 59. Of these, metal, glass and miscella neous items are mostly modern, and include numerous shotgun cartridge cases, which are testimony to the popularity of the höyük for hunting activities, as indeed we witnessed in the course of our fieldwork. Bones were extremely rare, and were not collected, since they all appeared to be very recent. 30 A Caltilar 2.S 3to m Nenezi Dad East GOSu Dag 2,0 - \P X Sta Nychia M IS • * Dh«menegaki £ a to 05 00 00 0.1 0.2 0.3 04 ftS 06 0.7 00 StfZt 10 Fig. 58.

These are very familiar items to prehisto rians working in the Near East and Aegean, where they have often been interpreted as tokens (for example, Schmandt- Besserat 1992: 211), although other functions can be attributed to them (for example, spindle-whorls, weights, jar-stoppers, etc.), often in conjunction with the presence of certain features (for example, perforations). They are also common in later periods, where there is clear evidence for their use, for example, as jar-stoppers or lids (for example, Pena 2007: 153). At Çaltilar the reworked sherds include both Bronze and Iron Age ceramics, as illustrated in fig. 60. Discussions and conclusions Occupation phases As mentioned in the introduction, Çaltilar Höyük was first investigated in the 1980s by the Balboura Survey, and the important work of this team, as presented in their preliminary reports, had already suggested the presence of material dating to the fourth (Chalcolithic), third (Early Bronze Age) and early first (eighth to seventh century) millennia BC, although none of their prehistoric material was illustrated in them (Coulton 1989: 12; 1992: 47; 1998: 232). The new data presented in our previous reports, and especially here, allow us to refine and add to this existing picture. For example, the second millennium gap has now been filled, despite the consid erable limitations encountered in dating some of this material, largely due to the absence of comparanda from well-stratified contexts at sites within the region. Some vessel shapes and styles have great longevity and, as noted above, it is likely that material assigned to particular phases may rightly belong in preceding or subsequent phases, especially with regard to the Middle to Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages. All the material collected, however, is now stored in our Çaltilar depot (except for the obsidian, pétrographie and slag samples), so that conclusions regarding dating and interpretation presented here can be reassessed in the future, when more information is available. 113</page><page sequence="54">Anatolian Studies 2011 Concerning the occupation phases of the site, the earliest material may be assigned to the Late Chalcolithic period, that is, to the second half of the fourth millennium BC (cf. Schoop 2005: 185-96; cf. also above). Substantial occupation continued into the third millennium BC, that is, in the Early Bronze Age. Although we are unable to identify material that could be assigned with certainty to its earliest phase, many ceramic fragments find very good parallels among the Early Bronze Age II (and possibly Early Bronze Age III) pottery identified at Elmah-Karataç. The material assignable to the second millennium BC (Middle to Late Bronze Age) is too small in quantity and too lacking in diagnostic characteristics to allow precise dating. Nevertheless, it fills a conspicuous gap in the history of the site, and provides a welcome and signif icant contribution to the settlement history and material culture of a region in which archaeological remains of this period are slight and where land-based archaeolo gists, to paraphrase Mellink (1995: 41), still have to catch up with their underwater colleagues (and, one may also add, with historians). The transition from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age, and the earliest stages of the latter period, are still unclear at Çaltilar. There may well be some material in our collection that could be dated to these phases, but we lack the necessary regional typologies to be certain. Some of our decorative motifs, such as concentric circles and concentric triangles, and shapes, notably pedestal bases, may belong to a late tenth and early ninth century horizon. Most of our Iron Age ceramic assemblage can be securely dated to the eighth, seventh and sixth centuries, suggesting that the site was continuously occupied during this period. The ceramic evidence also suggests strongly that occupation at the site ceased during the middle of the sixth century BC. While material associated with our latest assemblage continued to be used elsewhere during the later part of the sixth century, Çaltilar lacks other pottery whose distribution in western Anatolia begins during the second half of the sixth century, notably Attic black figure (Görkay 1999). This proposed final occupation date appears to coincide with historical references to the Persian annex ation of Lycia, first described by Herodotus, who outlines Harpagus's conquest of Xanthus ca 540 BC in brief yet dramatic detail {Histories 1.176). In this passage, we are told that of the Xanthians who claimed to be Lycian by Herodotus's time (middle of the fifth century BC), all but 80 families were, in fact, of foreign origin {Histories 1.176.3), suggesting that only 80 families survived the city's conquest. It is widely assumed by modern scholarship that these 80 families were in the yayla when Harpagus laid siege to the city (for example, Bean 1978: 50; Harrison 2001: 29), and there is reason to believe that the Seki plain may have served as the yayla for Xanthus. The Turkish word yayla has been defined as 'a place to go for a definite period during the summer for: grazing of animals, conducting agricultural practices, supplying livelihood or even rest, which lies outside of the subsis tence boundaries of a village, is usually joint property of a village, and although far away, is wholly or partially tied to that area with socio-economic connections, or a secondary area added to a village's actual subsistence area' (Tunçdilek 1974: 63). In other words, there is a social and practical symbiosis between a village and its yayla counterpart. This symbiosis exists today in Lycia between the major coastal towns of Antalya and Fethiye and the upland pasture regions at the top of the Xanthus river valley system. The Seki basin, where Çaltilar is located, is the first yayla zone one reaches from Fethiye. Many of Çaltilar's summer residents live in Antalya or Fethiye during the winters, using the yayla as their holiday retreat from the heat, humidity and invading tourists of the coastal plain. This residential relationship between the coast and the yayla is reflected in settlement names in both regions. Villages and quarters around Fethiye, in particular, share common names with several small settlements in the Seki yayla: Patlangiç, a mahalle (neighbourhood) in Fethiye, is matched by Yaylapatlangiç, and Kimk - the modern name for Xanthus village - has a corresponding yayla counterpart that is the first town in the Seki basin one reaches from the Fethiye coast. Indeed, Çaltilar has its own lowland equivalent at Çaltiôzii in the Xanthus valley (Fethiye district). An Ottoman bridge next to the modern highway near Seki and a Hellenistic watchtower just beyond the neighbouring village of Bekçiler, 1.5km to the north of Çaltilar and along the same highway, suggest that this particular route across the Seki plain has been in use for centuries. Collectively, these tentatively imply that the Seki plateau may have served as a yayla for the settlements of the Xanthus valley in some periods in antiquity. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasise that the nature of the finds indicates that Çaltilar itself was not merely, or even necessarily, an agro-pastoral settlement of the kind associated with the yayla today (see also below). Regardless of the precise nature of the relationship between the lower and upper Xanthus river valley regions, and between the lower Xanthus river zone and Çaltilar, in particular, however, there may be a correlation between the Persian conquest of Lycia and changes in the settlement patterns of the entire region at this time. 114</page><page sequence="55">Momigliano, Greaves, Hodos, Aksoy, Brown, Kibaroglu and Carter Extent of occupation The surveys carried out in 2008-2010 have shown that the settlement extended beyond the immediately visible limits of the mound itself, over lower terraces located to the north and south, although probably not to any consid erable extent beyond these. The overall size of the settlement therefore, as can be estimated at present, appears to cover approximately 3ha. There are also indications that the size of the settlement varied over time. The overall distribution patterns of our finds and the observation of abraded Iron Age pottery alongside much fresher looking prehistoric I material from the north field suggest that occupation during the Iron Age was restricted to the upper elevations of the höyük and that occupation during the earlier phase extended beyond this into the lower terraces of the mound. We cannot say much about the extent or, indeed, nature of settlement at Çaltilar in the second millennium BC due to the scarcity of material of this period collected from the surface. Nature of occupation The fairly substantial size of the Late Chalcolithic to Early Bronze Age settlement and the nature of some of the finds, such as the presence of many ceramic imports from the Denizli/Menderes massif area and obsidian from central Anatolia, indicate that our site was very well connected and probably occupied on more than just a seasonal basis, although we need more specific data, especially from excavations, to provide firmer evidence. This impression of connectivity, permanence and general politico-economic significance is much more marked for the Iron Age, for which considerably more information is available. One of the most striking features of our Iron Age assemblage is the quantity and nature of the imported vessels. The sheer number of imported vessels retrieved from the surface is surprising, especially as this site is not in a location typically associated with redistribution centres, such as a coastal port. Furthermore, we have examples of vessels from a considerable distance away, notably Phrygia, Lydia, Ionia and Greece. This pattern, which finds echoes in our Early Bronze Age assemblage, illustrates the importance of not only maritime connec tions, but also of land routes (on the importance of overland trade connections in the Early Bronze Age, see Efe 2007: with further references). In addition, many of the Iron Age vessels from these regions are large and elaborately decorated. The status value associated with imported pottery and the fact that many of these vessels were heavy suggest that Çaltilar was not a mere agro pastoral settlement in this period, but something more refined and important. This tentative conclusion may find support from our geophysical results, which are suggestive of a stone-built structure of considerable size (approximately 10m by 20m) in the northeast sector of the uppermost elevation of the mound, with walls that appear to be preserved from the present surface to a depth of approximately 2.5m. Given that the pottery collected from the survey strongly suggests that occupation at the site ceased around the time of the Persian conquest, whatever this structure is, it is likely to predate the middle of the sixth century. Conclusions The results of three years of new fieldwork and artefact studies at Çaltilar suggest that this was a settlement of some importance in southwest Turkey from the Chalcol ithic to the Iron Age. The site appears to have been occupied throughout this long period, although with some possible gaps (for example, the Early Bronze Age I and the end of the Bronze Age/very Early Iron Age, although we cannot say for certain without stratified contexts). It is one of a handful of sites in southwest Turkey where evidence of second millennium BC occupation has been recorded and the only site near Graeco-Roman Oenoanda that, so far, has yielded material of this date, although only further investigations at Çaltilar and within the wider surrounding territory may establish whether this, or some other site, could be the Wiyanawanda mentioned in the Hittite texts. Çaltilar is located on a long-established route through the Lycian yayla and it is clear that at different periods in its history it was an important point in the complex networks connecting the populations around the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean shores with the early cultures and later kingdoms of Anatolia.
