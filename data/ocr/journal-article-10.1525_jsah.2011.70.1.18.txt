      <p>Among early writings on architectural theory, the <italic>Libro architettonico</italic> by the Florentine sculptor and architect Antonio di Pietro Averlino, who used the name 
Filarete—lover or friend of virtue—is surely one of the most original and complex; its significance is therefore also the most controversial (Figure 1).<sup>1</sup> Written in Italian between 1460 and 1464/66, it takes the form of a dialogue between the author and his employers, Duke Francesco Sforza of Milan and his son Galeazzo Maria Sforza, and it tells of the planning and construction of an ideal city, named Sforzinda after its royal patrons, as well as a port allied to it, called Plusiapolis ("rich city").<sup>2</sup> During excavation for the port city's foundations, a golden book written by an "ancient king" is found (Figure 2). The discovered volume is also a dialogue between a patron (the king) and his architect, and Filarete weaves together his own book and this book-within-a-book using numerous literary and visual strategies. He recounts how the buildings of the modern city of Plusiapolis are erected in imitation of those described in the ancient Golden Book; some descriptions refer to the previously erected city of Sforzinda.</p>
      <p>Filarete constructs a renaissance of the ancient world described in the rediscovered text, and his architectural theories and designs are presented as a rebirth of that ancient ideal. However, what is involved is by no means a recovery of Roman antiquity, as one might have expected. Filarete's designs show almost no similarities with the architecture of Rome; instead they share notable common features with the architecture of the Near and Far East, while the text situates the ideal city of Sforzinda in "India" and repeatedly mentions Egypt as the origin of every form of architecture and as the model to be followed.</p>
      <p>Most scholarship has consistently emphasized Filarete’s dependence, with regard to both the text and the illustrations, on classical sources: Roman architecture, Vitruvius, Pliny, Diodorus Siculus, and others.<sup>3</sup> John Onians and Alessandro Rovetta have rightly expanded this territory, emphasizing the importance for Filarete of Greece and the influence of Platonic literature (Onians) and of Byzantine buildings (Rovetta).<sup>4</sup> According to them, Filarete—in contrast to the "Latin" Leon Battista Alberti—was aiming for a renaissance of Greek antiquity. But Filarete's view extended even farther into the east. His imagination was fed by everything he could find relating to the Near and Far East in the medieval literature of travel and wonders and in conversations with contemporary travelers—everything about the far-off lands where he thought elements of genuine, pure, uncorrupted antiquity were still preserved.</p>
      <p>An analysis of Filarete's understanding of the ancient world, his use of the terms "India" and "Egypt," the possible sources for his enthusiasm for and knowledge of the East, and his designs leads to the hypothesis that he was hoping to achieve a renaissance of a <italic>prisca architectura</italic>.<sup>5</sup> In this, he was like his humanist contemporaries, who were seeking older and more venerable witnesses to an original truth, a <italic>prisca theologia</italic>.</p>
      <sec id="div1-1">
         <title>Rebirth of Antiquity</title>
         <p>One of the main themes of Filarete's <italic>Libro Architettonico</italic> is the contrast between two architectural styles. On the one hand, there is the inferior "modo moderno"—i.e., the Gothic style, a "<italic>maledetta praticaccia</italic>" ("damn bad practice") that supposedly reached Italy with the invasion of the "barbarians," meaning the people "from the other side of the Alps" or, more specifically, "the Germans and the French."<sup>6</sup> On the other hand, there is the "<italic>modo antico</italic>," which according to Filarete had already been revived in Florence, but not in Milan. During the course of the dialogue, Filarete's patron and his son, and the reader/listener, are converted from favoring the modern architectural style to the antique.<sup>7</sup>
         </p>
         <p>What Filarete was aiming for in his promotion of an antique style was a rebirth. This is often alluded to in his work, most explicitly in the thirteenth book, in which a visiting lord from Mantua (presumably Ludovico Gonzaga), upon seeing the just-completed city of Sforzinda, enthusiastically proclaims the advent of the Renaissance: "My lord, I seem to see again the noble buildings that were once in Rome and those that we read were in Egypt. It seems to me that I have been reborn on seeing those noble buildings. They seem very beautiful to me."<sup>8</sup> The sense of the phrase "<italic>rinascere a vedere</italic>" clearly indicates that Ludovico Gonzaga/Filarete is thinking in terms of a rebirth of antiquity, either his own rebirth in the past, as the text seems to indicate, or the rebirth of ancient buildings in the present. However, Filarete's aim is clearly stated. He wishes to recreate the lost architecture of antiquity.</p>

      <sec id="div1-2">
         <title>Golden Books</title>
         <p>A central role in this "renaissance" of the ancient style and in the education of the patron and his son—and the reader/listener—is played by the discovery of the ancient codex.<sup>9</sup> As soon as the city of Sforzinda has been more or less completed, construction begins on the fortified port, Plusiapolis. As the foundations for its defensive walls are being excavated, a treasure chest is discovered. Along with other precious items, it holds a further chest containing a Golden Book written in Greek. The author of this <italic>Codex Aureus</italic> is an ancient king named Zogaglia, whose city of Galisforma (the two names are an anagrammatic form of Galeazzo Maria Sforza) once stood on the site. The book first tells the story of the king, and additional anagrams reveal it to be the history of the rise of the Sforza family.<sup>10</sup> It thus confirms and ennobles Sforza rule by endowing it with the pedigree of antiquity.</p>
         <p>The principal protagonist in the Golden Book is Filarete himself, who appears as "Onitoan Nolivera. . . per patria notirenflo" (an anagrammatic form of his name and origin, Antonio Averlino, Florentino), court architect to King Zogaglia.<sup>11</sup> The majority of the Golden Book consists of a dialogue between the ancient king and his architect, in the course of which all of the ancient buildings and complexes erected by the king are described. Guided by the description of the now-sunken port city, the buildings of the new Sforza port are then erected on the same site.<sup>12</sup> Some of the descriptions, however, match buildings that had already been described as erected in the city of Sforzinda, which lay inland, some distance away. A number of the palaces of Sforzinda are described again in the Golden Book, which also mentions the churches. And in fact Filarete attributes to the ancient King Zogaglia the construction of a second city farther away in the interior, where Filarete, commissioned by Francesco Sforza, had just built Sforzinda.<sup>13</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The dialogue in the Golden Book between the ancient king and his architect is no different from the discussion between Filarete and Francesco Sforza and/or Galeazzo Maria Sforza that is recounted in the encompassing text. Filarete sometimes even forgets to change the names to anagrams, or perhaps does so deliberately in order to make the two epochs appear even closer.<sup>14</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Another connection between the two "renaissances"—and between the book and and the book-within-a-book—is created when Filarete reports that he buried a bronze book during the ceremonies accompanying the laying of the foundation stone for the city of Sforzinda, when a marble chest containing the book is set into the foundation of the city wall along with the first stone.<sup>15</sup> This book is to serve as a witness "of this our age and the deeds of worthy men"—but above all as a witness of Filarete's designs and architecture. He suggests that his bronze book corresponds to the ancient Golden Book, found during the excavations for the walls of the port city: "The reason I put these things in this foundation is because, as every man knows, things that have a beginning must have an end. When the time comes, they will find these things, and know our names and remember us because of them, just as we remember when we find something noble in a ruin or in an excavation. We are happy and pleased to find a thing that represents antiquity and [gives] the name of him who had it done."<sup>16</sup> Filarete argues that the present—including his own architecture and accomplishments—should have the same importance for future generations that the Golden Age of antiquity has for the present. If antiquity is lost again, Filarete is ensuring the continuation of its tradition.</p>
         <p>The parallelism between Filarete's own <italic>Libro Architettonico</italic> and the ancient codex is impressed upon the reader in a visual, material manner as well. The title page of Filarete's book bore a motif that he also depicts on the cover of the Golden Book (see Figures 1, 2).<sup>17</sup> In both, a nude woman stands in a vessel inscribed with the word "Memori(a)," with two children identified as Intellectus and Ingenium at her feet. On the title page, which also bears a double portrait of Filarete inside the intial letter E, the woman is pouring a liquid out of two bowls into the mouths of the children (see Figure 1). For their part, each of the children is emptying a jug. The accompanying bees identify the liquid as honey or nectar. In the depiction on the cover of the Golden Book, the woman simply lays her hands on the children's heads (see Figure 2).<sup>18</sup> Filarete's <italic>Libro</italic> is thus represented as identical with the ancient <italic>Codex Aureus</italic>, or at least as a vessel for the same "memoria," from which <italic>intellectus</italic> and <italic>ingenium</italic> draw sustenance.</p>
         <p>Such devices link the present with the past and attach Filarete's architectural treatise with the Golden Book, ensuring that his architecture is identified with that of antiquity. Through Filarete, antiquity is not only reborn in the mind and spirit, but also re-erected in fact.</p>
         <p>However, the antique architecture that Filarete was intent on reviving had little to do with actual Roman buildings, which were then being studied and measured with archaeological interest by contemporary architects, including Brunelleschi and Alberti. Since Filarete himself spent fourteen years in Rome (1433–47) before writing his <italic>Libro Architetto­nico</italic>, the differences between his favored architecture and that of Roman antiquity cannot be attributed to ignorance. These differences were conscious, and they require explanation.</p>
         <p>Filarete makes remarkably few specific references to the buildings that he had seen in Rome. And even when he does, it is immediately clear that he is not interested in archaeological reconstruction. Neither the elevation nor certainly the ground plan of the Colosseum that are depicted by Filarete correspond to the actual structure (Figure 3).<sup>19</sup> And in his discussion of the Circus of Maxentius, he shows interest chiefly in the obelisk and its hieroglyphs (Figure 4).<sup>20</sup>

         <title>Egypt: The Origin of Architecture</title>
         <p>Filarete's interest in Egypt was very strong. He writes that Federico Gonzaga, upon viewing the architect's buildings, proclaimed the advent of the Renaissance and acclaimed the reappearance of "the noble buildings that were once in Rome and those that we read were in Egypt." Like the ancient buildings of Rome, the buildings of Egypt were thus also intended to <italic>rinascere.</italic> For modern observers who—
unlike Filarete—are familiar with Egyptian art, this is likely to come as a surprise, since the two styles have little to do with each other. However, this is not the only passage in Filarete's <italic>Libro</italic> in which Egypt is presented as the model to be revived. There are a large number of references to ancient pyramids and obelisks, sometimes illustrated, in which they usually appear as elements in complex compositions, such as the Monument for Re Zogaglia (Figure 5).<sup>21</sup> A single free-standing obelisk is placed on a central city square, "like the Egyptian ones."<sup>22</sup> Eight labyrinths are mentioned, five of which are illustrated and one of which is called "Egyptian"; Daidalos is twice mentioned as the architect (Figures 6–9).<sup>23</sup>

         </fig>
         <p>One of these labyrinths is of particular interest, as its discussion reveals why Filarete placed such great importance on this type of structure. He prescribes that the House of the Architect is to be adorned with, among other things, pictures of the inventors of the various arts and sciences, in chronological order.<sup>24</sup> Architecture occupies the very first position, and depicted are to be two Egyptian architects, Menedotus and Velnaron, who are said to have built the first labyrinth.<sup>25</sup> This makes the labyrinth the very first work of architecture—the absolute commencement of architecture—and the <italic>sine qua non</italic> of human society, since architecture comes first in the chronology of all the arts and sciences. These beginnings lie in Egypt.<sup>26</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The age and venerability of Egyptian buildings inspires many of Filarete's architectural decorations. The description of the paintings adorning the ducal palace begins and ends with Egyptian motifs: "The paintings represented among other things the origins and beginnings of the kings of Egypt as well as other most ancient histories, for example the life of Cyrus.. . . There were also buildings, as for example the pyramids of Egypt, which are large and eternal. There was also the great Egyptian Thebes, which had one hundred gates, and, in sum, all the noble things of that place. Many other noble ancient things were represented in our court."<sup>27</sup>

         <title>India: The Architecture of a Paradisal Location</title>
         <p>While Filarete identifies numerous works of architecture and ornamentation whose Egyptian origins are emphasized, Sforzinda lies in India. It is certainly no coincidence that the capital city of the Sforza family is named Sforz<italic>inda</italic>; it lies on the river Sforz<italic>indo</italic> (one passage refers to the river as Indo), in the Inda valley, at the foot of the Indo mountain (Figure 10). The siting of the city in India is emphasized repeatedly through the use of these names.<sup>28</sup> Sforzinda is described several times as an earthly paradise—remote, enclosed, and richly endowed with water, animals, and fruits of every type, as well as precious stones and valuable building materials.<sup>29</sup>

         <p>In Filarete's time the term <italic>India</italic> referred to a much larger geographical area than the present-day nation.<sup>30</sup> China, for example, was at that time often designated India Ulterior or Interior. Even Africa was referred to as India Tertia, India Aegypti, or India Aethiopiae, as there was general agreement with Ptolemy that the Indian Ocean was an inland sea, making Africa and India a single entity—a misconception that was finally corrected only toward the end of the fifteenth century. The designation "India" is often simply synonymous with the East or, even more broadly, the "distant." This should be taken into consideration, in view of the many mentions of ancient cities and marvelous sights in Filarete's <italic>Libro Architettonico</italic>. The eighth book, for example, lists Rome, but also Troy, Carthage, Nineveh, Babylon, Thebes in Egypt and Cathay, "a very large country. They say it is in Tartary, where some report there are more than 20,000 bridges."<sup>31</sup>
         </p>
         <p>These 20,000 bridges, or the one hundred gates of "the great Egyptian Thebes," presumably originated—as did the city names—in medieval and contemporary literature on travel and wondrous sights. Marco Polo's <italic>Milione</italic>, to name only the most famous example, describes huge cities with one hundred gates and six thousand stone bridges (Filarete has a particular fondness for depicting bridges)<sup>32</sup> and large and small canals, which are used to remove refuse from the city in the same way as in Filarete's Sforzinda.<sup>33</sup> Marco Polo described a tomb that a "very rich king" had built for himself "in antiquity," with high towers topped with gilded spheres and equipped with apparatuses that transform wind into music. This description could have been one of the inspirations for Filarete's Monument for Re Zogaglia, erected in the main piazza of Plusiapolis, to mark the site where the Golden Book had been discovered (see Figure 5).<sup>34</sup> However, spheres atop towers or obelisks, figures of angels or wind gods that make music of the wind (Figure 11),<sup>35</sup> lighthouses (see Figure 8), lighted columns,<sup>36</sup> towers or columns with water fountains at their tops,<sup>37</sup> revolving towers (Figure 12),<sup>38</sup> and towers that can be climbed on horseback via spiraling ramps on the inside or outside (Figure 13, see Figure 11)<sup>39</sup> are all stock themes of the medieval literature devoted to travel and wonders.<sup>40</sup> Filarete's references to such towers and columns may have been influenced by reports of actual monuments, especially the early Islamic minarets in Samarra and Cairo (Mosque of Ibn Tulun), as well as the famous Lighthouse of Alexandria, all of which could be climbed by horses. Benjamin of Tudela, for example, reported on the monuments of Cairo and Alexandria in the twelfth century.<sup>41</sup> The Pharos of Alexandria is said to have had a water source at its center.<sup>42</sup> A column with a water pipe leading to its tip is described in Baalbek in several eighteenth-century travel accounts; yet another example of a water-bearing column was excavated in Chirbethamsîn, north of Akka, at the beginning of the twentieth century.<sup>43</sup>

         <p>Of special interest is the tower of Firuzabad (Gur) in Iran, now known as "minar" but formerly called <italic>"</italic>tirbal<italic>."</italic> This was originally the core of a square tower with a staircase; the stairs and exterior walls have been lost, and the tower today rises some 30 meters above an expanse of rubble (Figure 14).<sup>44</sup> Gur, the capital of the Sassanid empire, was set in a fertile valley surrounded by mountains on the river Firuzabad; it was arranged on a circular plan, surrounded by two clay walls and a wide ditch; twenty radially arranged streets led to the towerlike building at the precise center of the complex, which probably had been a group of palace buildings. From the top of the tower it would have been possible to overlook the whole city, and water flowed like a spring from the tower's pipe.<sup>45</sup> The correspondences with Filarete's Sforzinda are conspicuous (see Figure 10). In the second book, the Renaissance architect had proposed to mark the center of his circular city, surrounded by a moat, with a tall tower that was to symbolize in various ways the cycle of the year.<sup>46</sup> However, in the sixth book, in the more detailed description of the center of the city, the tower is no longer mentioned.<sup>47</sup> Filarete had apparently abandoned the original ideal plan, derived from Eastern models, in favor of more realistic and nearby sources. But this concession tempered the original idea without abandoning it. The ideal project is now transferred to the central building of a fortress, the function and siting of which in the city are left unclear (see Figures 6, 14). Channeling water to the center of the complex via an aqueduct continues to be described. Now, however, it does not flow into the canals and along the streets, but into the passages of a labyrinth that encircles the fortress.<sup>48</sup> The notable ground plan of the fortress is a square 3-by-3 grid (see Figure 6). The same 3-by-3 grid plan is adopted for one of the palace complexes in Plusiapolis, which is set in the midst of a garden laid out as a map or image of the world, surrounded by a labyrinth (see Figure 9). In Plusiapolis the central square of the complex is occupied by the main building of the palace, while in Sforzinda the central square is the site of the central tower of the fortress.<sup>49</sup> As simple as this gridded layout may be, it does not seem to appear in the Western tradition before Filarete. It does, however, appear in numerous Eastern traditions, such as that of the Indian mandala.<sup>50</sup> Moreover, this pattern was used in laying out cities in China, as well for the semilegendary cosmological temple known as the <italic>ming-t'ang</italic> (hall of light or cosmic house), the ritual residence where the emperor performed the seasonal ceremonial acts necessary to maintain the unity of heaven and earth.<sup>51</sup> Further parallels at a morphological level suggest themselves.<sup>52</sup>

         <title>Knowledge and Notions of the Far East</title>
         <p>Filarete demonstrates that he was familiar with the architecture of the Near and Far East, especially as it was described in the medieval and early Renaissance literature devoted to travel and wonders. Labyrinths, pyramids, obelisks, crowning spheres, and shining towers that rotate and can be climbed on horseback via spiraling ramps can all be found in this literature, but in no cases do the descriptions correspond exactly to Filarete's designs. This suggests that he was working from memory or that his primary source was oral tradition.</p>
         <p>In addition to Filarete's knowledge of the literary tradition, he may have also had more direct, personally communicated knowledge of Eastern buildings. Although we know little about the links between East and West in this period, and the sparse written evidence is overlaid with medieval or ancient literary traditions, the contacts were certainly more intensive than these literary sources would lead us to conclude. The importance of oral transmission of such information should not be underestimated; this has been shown very clearly by recent publications and conferences.<sup>53</sup> While it is true that the surviving written accounts suggest travelers' rather limited interest in foreign architecture, much more might have been drawn out had they been questioned by a contemporary architect.</p>
         <p>Filarete might have consulted at least four possible authorities on the Orient. The first is the humanist Francesco Filelfo, who spent the 1420s in Constantinople (where he had married a Greek woman), before meeting and becoming Filarete's friend in Florence.<sup>54</sup> This friendship, which continued in Milan, is attested to by several letters by Filelfo to Filarete and by an epigram that the humanist scholar dedicated to the architect.<sup>55</sup> Filelfo appears at several points in Filarete's <italic>Libro</italic>—for example, as the author of inscriptions that are to be placed on the buildings, as interpreter of hieroglyphs, and as the translator from Greek of the ancient Golden Book.<sup>56</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Filarete must have also known Filelfo's friend Ciriaco d'Ancona—if not through Filelfo, then through Pope Eugene IV, who had employed both of them at the time of the Council of Ferrara/Florence in 1438–39 and thereafter. They were resident in Rimini and Venice at the same time.<sup>57</sup> Accounts of several of Ciriaco's travels to Constantinople, to the Aegean, and three journeys to Egypt are extant, and there is evidence that he made drawings of the buildings he saw—drawings that were presumably destroyed in 1514 by a fire in the Sforza library in Pesaro.<sup>58</sup> Furthermore, it is very likely that Filarete knew both the Florentine Benedetto Dei, who began traveling through the Orient in 1458 and reported on his travels in letters,<sup>59</sup> and Niccolò de' Conti, who traveled through India and perhaps even China between about 1414 and 1439, and whom Filarete could have met in Florence or Venice.<sup>60</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Filarete's multiple periods of residence in Venice could, of course, have led him to make other valuable acquaintances and receive first-hand news from the Orient. For example, the Persian ambassador from Tabriz (an important trading city on the Silk Road, which was frequented by Italians) was in Venice at the same time as Filarete, and he or someone from his entourage could have told Filarete about the mosque in Tabriz.<sup>61</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Filarete's architectural concepts, although inventive, are not purely imaginary, and it is likely that verbal resources inspired the minaret-like towers of his four-spired Cathedral of Sforzinda (Figure 15) and the two versions of his Temple of Plusiapolis (Figures 16, 17).<sup>62</sup>

         <p>While the mosque of Tabriz has not survived—nor has any other early mosque with four minarets—an understanding of it can be assembled from literary sources and archaeological remains, and Filarete's designs can be compared with similar mosques of a later date.<sup>63</sup> The conical termination of Filarete's towers resemble those of the great Ottoman mosques, such as the Selimiye at Edirne by Sinan (Figure 18).<sup>64</sup> The "minarets" of Filarete's second version of the Temple of Plusiapolis stand on octagonal bases like those at the Taj Mahal in Agra (1632–49) and the tomb of Jahangir at Shahdara, Lahore (1628–38) (Figure 19, see Figure 17). Those minarets resemble the semi-engaged minarets of the Gol Gumbaz at Bijapur; in both, the minarets are octagonal, are seven stories tall, and are perforated by windows (Figure 20, cf. Figure 17). Like Humayun's tomb in Delhi (1570), or Akbar's tomb at Sikandra (1613), both variants of Filarete's temple stand on arcaded platforms, and like the Taj Mahal in Agra, the platform is reached by stairs parallel to it (Figure 21, see Figures 16, 17, 19). His first version of the Temple of Plusiapolis resembles yet another Mughal monument, the tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah in Agra (completed 1628; Figure 22). In both, octagonal towers at the corners advance beyond the plane of the façade. Since it is highly improbable that Filarete influenced the Mughal architects, it may be assumed that these architectural forms derive from a common source.</p>

         <title>Imaginary Utopia or Serious Program?</title>
         <p>Filarete places his ideal architecture in India and refers at numerous points to Egypt as the home of the ideal art that is to be revived. His imagination was fed by information about strange and distant lands gleaned from medieval literature and heard about from contemporary travelers. Filarete's "antiquity" stands temporally before and geo­graphically outside Greek and Roman classical antiquity. What was it that fired this interest in the distant Orient, a place he had never visited? Was this land more than a surface onto which he could project his fantasy of an ideal? In other words, was Filarete only concerned with establishing an unknown and thus indisputable authority, which was defined loosely enough to give his own imagination free rein? Because a utopian state needs to be protected from reality, utopians of all periods have set their creations in the past or future, or on inaccessibly distant islands—or in India. As early as the Hellenistic period, "India" was a byword for the "end of the Earth" and a symbol of an exotic world, alternately imagined as a place plagued by horrible monsters, or as an earthly paradise, with a perfect climate, where mighty kings and peaceful people lived in great wealth under just laws.<sup>65</sup> The early church fathers and, in particular, influential medieval encyclopedists such as Isidore of Seville (early seventh century) and Vincent of Beauvais or the Florentine Brunetto Latini (thirteenth century) placed the Garden of Eden in India. Numerous <italic>mappae mundi</italic> such as the famous Ebstorf world map, the Hereford map, and many of the Spanish Beatus maps locate Paradise in the Far East—in India.<sup>66</sup> The ideal lands of several chivalric romances and many versions of the Alexander romance were located in India, as was the mythical kingdom of the priest-king Prester John.<sup>67</sup> The main river of this earthly paradise is, of course, the Indus; sometimes a mountain is also mentioned, also called Indus or a similar name—exactly as in Filarete's <italic>Libro Architettonico</italic>.<sup>68</sup>
         </p>
         <p>At the time of Filarete, Egypt was considered by many to be a part of India, and Filarete states in the eighth book that Egypt is located in Asia.<sup>69</sup> Moreover, at least since Plato, everything Egyptian (not least the hieroglyphs, which served as a hermeneutic model) was seen as exemplary embodiments of idealism and timelessness.<sup>70</sup> The Renaissance enthusiastically adopted this fashion by 1419 at the latest, the date of the discovery of Horapollon's <italic>Hieroglyphica</italic>, a copy of which Filarete's friend Filelfo owned.<sup>71</sup>
         </p>
         <p>However, Filarete was seeking to do more than adopt Far Eastern and Egyptian clichés for literary purposes, as his discussion of the Golden Book reveals.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="div1-7">
         <title>Hermes Trismegistos</title>
         <p>Scholars have interpreted Filarete's account of the discovery of the Golden Book as an allusion to the rediscovery of Vitruvius's treatise by Poggio Bracciolini in 1421<sup>72</sup> or as a reference to the <italic>Bibliotheca historica</italic> by Diodorus Siculus.<sup>73</sup> However, a different identification fits extremely well with the known facts.</p>
         <p>Filarete's account of finding a treasure and the Golden Book, which contains ancient knowledge, is reminiscent of stories from Arabian literature, known since the tenth century, that describe the discovery of the Tabula Smaragdina and similar alchemistic texts attributed to Hermes. The oldest of these narratives recounts the discovery of Hermetic books in Egyptian pyramids and burial chambers. Later versions attempt to give credibility to the idea that these books made their way through inheritance to other countries, where they were later discovered.<sup>74</sup> The latter category includes The Book of the Treasures of Alexander (<italic>Kitab dahirat Aliskandar</italic>), presumably written in the eleventh century.<sup>75</sup> Its account of a discovered treasure, developed through a multilayered background story, bears such a strong resemblance to Filarete's narrative that one is forced to conclude that direct derivation is involved.</p>
         <p>In the "Book of the Treasures of Alexander," Prince Al-Mu'tasim learns after the destruction of Amorium that a monastery in that city holds a number of recorded revelations and relics of the prophets. He dispatches his architect and an astrologer, who search the monastery for hidden rooms but find none. Just as Al-Mu'tasim is about to give up the search, Al-Mamun, the legendary first opener of pyramids, appears to him in a dream, saying: "O brother, begin tearing down the walls, for in them is the treasure of Du'Iquarnain and the science of Aristotle and the great Hermes! I congratulate you, O brother, on the honor, victory, spoils and splendid possessions that are to be given to you!"<sup>76</sup> The following morning, the prince orders his architect to tear down the walls as quickly as possible. And indeed, in the foundations is found a copper box containing a gold box with an inscription in Greek. In this box, finally, is found a Golden Book written in Greek.</p>
         <p>The prince sends for an interpreter, who begins translating the inscriptions and the Golden Book. The inscription on the outer box tells of King Alexander, and why, when, and under which constellation he had had the treasure buried, so that only the next most worthy person would be able to find it, a person who would be both philosopher and king, and who would guard the treasure just as Alexander had done and protect it from unworthy persons. In a postscript that Aristotle addresses to Alexander, the origins of the "treasure" are traced back, by way of Apollonius of Tyana, to the pre-Flood wisdom of Hermes Trismegistos. This account is followed by ten chapters that present the alchemistic treatises and the formulas taken from the Golden Book.</p>
         <p>This narrative has notable elements in common with Filarete's tale: the excavation of wall foundations in an ancient structure by an architect at the behest of his prince-patron; the subsequent discovery of the treasure of an ancient king; the location of the treasure in a box containing another box, which in turn contains a Golden Book bearing a Greek inscription; both the inscription and the book have to be translated by an interpreter who is summoned for this task; in addition, Filarete's king gives his servants instructions to bury the treasure so that only a most worthy person will be able to find it.<sup>77</sup> While his account of the Golden Book does not include an astrologer to determine the suitable celestial circumstances for the concealment of the text, that detail is in his story of the Bronze Book.<sup>78</sup> And, finally, Filarete's Golden Book also contains alchemistic secrets.</p>
         <p>In Filarete's story, within the boxes found while laying the foundations for the walls of the port city are, among other objects, two vases containing mysterious powders.<sup>79</sup> The patron, who is summoned when the box is opened, and his son initially mistake these for the ashes of a dead person and want to discard them, but the wise architect intervenes, suggesting that they should wait until the book has been translated. So Francesco Sforza returns to his court with the book and halts construction until the contents of the Golden Book have been translated. After a few days, he sends to his princely son, who has remained at the building site, these instructions:</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>My dearest son, you will say thus to the architect, and I say to you that you should be pleased and willing to undertake noble things, for we have had the letters written on the golden book translated as well as all the others. We have understood the tenor of the whole. Among other things the dust that we wanted to throw away is such that, spend money as you will, it will never be lacking, for the contents of one vase are related to the sun and of the other to the moon. This makes a great multiplication in the god who cut off the head of Argus of the hundred eyes. We have discovered even better things, that is, the way to do it. So be of good cheer and do great and noble things. Forget the expense but build eternal things.<sup>80</sup>
            </p>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>"The god who cut off the head of Argus" was Mercury, a key figure in alchemy. And since the contents of one vase are related to the sun and that of the other to the moon, the powders can be identified as alchemical sulfur and mercury, the two generative principles of all material and components of the philosopher's stone (<italic>quinta essentia</italic>). "Its father is the sun; its mother is the moon," as the Hermetic Tabula Smaragdina states.<sup>81</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Mercury is the Latin name of the Greek Hermes, and the reference to the Book of the Treasures of Alexander, which deals with alchemical texts attributed to Hermes, suggests that Filarete's Golden Book was conceived as a reference to a collection of alchemical texts attributed to Hermes that, according to the inventory of 1459, was located in the library of Francesco Sforza in Filarete's time.<sup>82</sup> Thus the contents of the Golden Book and the architecture that it describes—Filarete's architecture—are linked to Hermes.</p>

         <title>
            <italic>Prisca architectura</italic>
         </title>
         <p>Filarete's Indian Egypt establishes architecture's venerable ideal beginnings, before Greece and Rome, before it was corrupted and distorted. He attempted to devise an original, true <italic>prisca architectura.</italic> In the 1460s he could not have initiated a project of this type by himself. He contributed to a general movement that was launched in his home city of Florence by Gemistos Plethon (whom Filelfo knew) and other Neoplatonists at the time of the Council of Ferrara/Florence (1438–48) under Filarete's patron Pope Eugenius IV. The objective of this movement was to rediscover the original truth, a <italic>prisca theologia</italic> (or <italic>prisca philosophia</italic>, <italic>philosophia priscorum,</italic> etc.), before it was split into pagan philosophy and Judeo-Christian theology. The aim was to harmonize the former with the latter.<sup>83</sup> In the same years when Filarete was writing his <italic>Libro Architettonico</italic>, Marsilio Ficino was working on a translation of the <italic>Corpus Hermeticum</italic>, a collection of writings that in 1460 had made its way to Florence from the East.<sup>84</sup> Although these texts actually originated in the second or third century AD, they were regarded as the oldest writing and were attributed to the mythical Egyptian king and priest Hermes, who at that time was generally considered to be a real historical figure. In the preface to his translation of the first book of the <italic>Corpus</italic> (1464), Ficino describes the content of the work as "a <italic>prisca theologia</italic>. . . which has its origins in Mercury,"<sup>85</sup> thus for the first time outlining a concept that he repeated in his subsequent writings and that was to vastly influence European intellectual history in the century that followed. He proposed that human wisdom had its origin not in Greece with Socrates or Plato, but in a much more distant period and place—in Egypt with Hermes Trismegistos, and then later in the Near or Far East.<sup>86</sup> To learn this absolute, primal truth before it was divided and corrupted, he argued, it is necessary to search for the oldest preserved manuscripts, to study them, and to translate and adapt them for the present.</p>
         <p>Filarete appears to have carried out in the field of architecture what his humanist colleagues were doing in theology and philosophy in Florence (and shortly thereafter in other places as well). He assimilated everything he could find pertaining to the Far and Near East in classical sources, the medieval literature of travel and wonders, and conversations with his contemporaries—in every source where he believed elements of genuine, pure antiquity—a <italic>prisca architectura</italic>—were preserved.<sup>87</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Filarete must have had a yearning to travel to India himself. In fact, just like his humanist contemporaries who traveled to the East in search of writings that might contain the most ancient truth, the <italic>prisca theologia,</italic> Filarete planned to journey to the East after completing his <italic>Libro Architettonico</italic> in 1466. However, he died before he could fulfill this wish.<sup>88</sup>
         </p>
         <p>If Filarete had lived longer, he would have been disappointed. Had he been able to travel all the way to India, he would have seen that Indian architecture by no means corresponded to his colossal ideals. Moreover, he would have lived to see that the architectural style that he had created did not attract any followers. It may have influenced an architect here or there in some manner, but the only faithful copies of his drawings appear in two codices of sketches for ephemeral, fantastic architectural works that Vasari and others labeled "<italic>bizzarie</italic>."<sup>89</sup> The sole structure built according to the <italic>Libro Architettonico</italic> was a "floating theater" of wood and paper designed by Antonio Rusconi in 1564 for the Compagnia degli Accesi in Venice.<sup>90</sup>

                  <p>The report forms the framing narrative for the first 21 books, which are followed by three additional books in which the architect fulfils his earlier often-repeated promise to give the prince instruction in the art of <italic>disegno.</italic> Originally, in 1464, Filarete had dedicated his book to Francesco Sforza, but when he was forced shortly afterward to look for a new employer, he prefaced his text in 1466 with a new dedication to Piero de' Medici (Figure 1) and added a twenty-fifth book praising the deeds and works of the Medici family, particularly their appreciation and patronage of architecture. The original has been lost; the most important extant manuscript is the Codex Magliabechianus (II,I,140) in the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze; Antonio Averlino Filarete, <italic>Trattato di architettura</italic>, ed.

On the manuscript tradition, see in particular Liliana Grassi, in <italic>Trattato di architettura</italic>, 1: cvii–cxxix; and the excellent summary by Genoni, <italic>Filarete in Word and Image</italic>, 145–203. The modern edition gave the text the misleading title "Trattato di Architettura." Filarete himself evidently did not give it a title, but in the dedication prefaced to the twenty-five books the architect himself refers to the work as "architettonico libro"-a title, or at least a description, that descibes its contents far better and has therefore replaced the older, secondary description in most recent studies.</p>

                  <p>The term "prisca architettura" is the author's creation in analogy to Filarete's humanist contemporaries who, like Francesco Filelfo or Marsilio Ficino, tried to reconstruct an original truth beyond both biblical and classical sources, which they coined <italic>prisca theologia</italic>, <italic>prisca philosophia</italic>, or <italic>philosophia priscorum</italic>.

                  <p>Thus, at the beginning of the dialogue, Filarete's patron Francesco Sforza, pointing to the cathedrals of Milan and Florence, defends the "modern"—i.e., Gothic—style against the new building practice, which follows models of antiquity (Lib. I, fol. 2r). In the middle of the <italic>Libro</italic> he seems undecided: now he likes the "modern" Gothic style and the ancient style equally and thinks that perhaps everyone should simply decide according to his own taste (Lib. XIII, fols. 99v–100r). At the end of the dialogue—that is, at the end of the education process that his architect Filarete subjects him to—the patron is convinced, and he joins in the praise of the ancient building style as the only true one, and even the only possible one (Lib. XVI, fol. 128v).</p>

                  <p>This literary process, which consciously mixes the past and present and the "ancient" Golden Book with Filarete's <italic>Libro architettonico</italic>, is especially clear in the description of the famous "House of Virtue and Vice" (Lib. XVIII). Filarete first presents it to his patron as his own invention (<italic>fantasia</italic>). He speaks in the first person present or in the future form: "First of all, I will take a space of 600 braccia"; "It is better for me to tell you all my fantasy and then clarify point by point my reason for making it in this form"; "Now I will tell you why I devised this edifice in this form when I made my fantasy and for what end and purpose it was done"; "Now I will tell you what I have thought about the form of this building"; "Now I shall discuss the use of its interior division of this house"; "I thought"; "I made"; "I depicted."; "I placed"; etc. In the course of his further descriptions of the construction, Filarete changes now and then to the third person and to the past tense, until finally he is using these forms exclusively. The fact that this past tense refers to a building described in the Golden Book finally becomes clear at the latest when Filarete again has himself represented by the anagram "Onitoan Nolivera": "There was also a place here appointed for the architect, where he who had built this entire building was to live.. . . His name was Onitoan Noliaver [<italic>sic</italic>].. . ". Finally, at the end of the section, the patron's son turns not to Filarete but to the translator of the Golden Book (Francesco Filelfo) with the question: "What follows now?", as though everything else had previously been read to him from the Golden Book.</p>

The illustration is not found in the Codex Magliabechianus. Since the Codex Trivulzianus is not dedicated to Piero de Medici, like the copy preserved in Florence, but instead is still dedicated to Francesco Sforza, it is the older version and thus closer to the original. A reproduction of the cover of the Golden Book is not preserved in the Codex Trivulzianus, but the depiction is found in the Codex Magliabechianus, Lib. XIV, fol. 108v. See note 2, above.</p>

                  <p>Four of the labyrinths illustrated surround a castle or palace (Lib. VI, fols. 38r; VI, 40v; XIII, 99r; XIV, 110r); one encloses a garden (Lib. XV, fol. 121r). Cf. Lib. I, fols. 2r (Daidalos); I, 7r (Persenna); VI, 37v (Daidalos, Persenna); XIX, 151v ("Egyptian"). The earliest labyrinth in Greek literature is Egyptian, mentioned in Herodotus (<italic>Historiarum libri</italic> II.148). Strabo mentions several Egyptian labyrinths (<italic>Geographica</italic> XVII.1, 3, XVII.1, 37) and describes the first Greek one as having been erected by Minos in Crete (X.4, 8). Diodorus Siculus (<italic>Bibliotheca historica</italic> I.61) and Pliny (<italic>Naturalis historiae</italic> XXXVI.19, 84ff) link the Cretan and Egyptian constructions to a visit to Egypt by Daidalos—on the same journey on which he learned about the Egyptian method of creating statues. Cf. Allen B. Lloyd, "The Egyptian Labyrinth," <italic>Journal of Egyptian Archaeology</italic> 56 (1970), 81–100; Sarah P. Morris, <italic>Daidalos and the Origins of Greek Art</italic> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992), 186 and 240–41. In Lib. VIII, fol. 59r, Filarete praises the antique style of Brunelleschi's architecture, calling him "a most subtle follower of Daidalos" (cf. Brunelleschi's epitaph of 1447 in Florence Cathedral, composed by Chancellor Carlo Marsuppini, who praises his outstanding services in the "arte daedalea"). In an epigram dedicated to Filarete in <italic>De iocis et seriis</italic> (Codice Ambrosiano G 93 inf., fols. 218v–219r) his friend Francesco Filelfo calls Filarete a "Daidalos"; Maria Beltramini, "Francesco Filelfo e il Filarete: Nuovi contributi alla storia dell'amicizia fra it letterato e l'architetto nella Milano Sforzesca," <italic>Annali della Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa</italic>, ser.

                  <p>Incidentally, Egyptian origins are attributed to several of the other arts as well, such as astrology (Lib. XIX, fol. 154r). And although Filarete calls the Greek Volari the inventor of painting in his discussion of this art, he adds, "Some say it was discovered in Egypt. The Egyptians say that they had the art of painting more than six thousand years before the Greeks" (Lib. XIX, fol. 152v). See also Lib. I, fol. 3v, where Filarete traces the Greek orders of columns (and their anthropomorphic measurements) to the Egyptians.</p>

There are several other possible connections to India. As Gerhard Goebel (who, significantly, is a historian not of art but of literature) correctly pointed out, in the case of the famous "House of Virtue and Vice" (Lib. XVIII) Filarete might have drawn inspiration from the devotional literature of the Middle Ages as well, such as the "Romance of the Seven Wise Men," a framework story from India that has come down in various Eastern and Western versions. See Gerhard Goebel, <italic>Poeta Faber. Erdichtete Architektur in der italienischen, spanischen und französischen Literatur der Renaissance und des Barock</italic> (Heidelberg: Winter, 1971), 30; cf. Rudolf Palgen, "Malebolge and the Pedagogical Tower: Outlines of a Method," <italic>Modern Language Review</italic> 43 (1948), 196–212. It may be mentioned in passing here that according to Theodore A. Wertime ("Asian Influence on European Metallurgy," <italic>Technology and Culture</italic> 5 [1964], 391–97), the iron smelter that Filarete comes across on an excursion in the vicinity of Sforzinda, and which he subsequently describes in book XVI, represented a technology that in Filarete's day was common only in the East. Evidence of its use in the West appears only after Filarete's lifetime. Although I cannot independently vouch for the accuracy of this, I have not found any evidence that Wertime's view has since been contested.</p>

However, Marconi and Muratore confined themselves to noting very general morphological similarities and did not address the question of whether, in what way, and for what purpose Filarete might have obtained information about the motifs described. Ralph Quadflieg considered that Filarete's Ospedale Maggiore adopted various architectural motifs and organizational ideas from the Maristan Qala'un in Cairo, built in the reign of the Mameluke Sultan Qala'un in 1283–84. See Ralph Quadflieg, <italic>Filaretes Ospedale Maggiore. Zur Rezeption islamischen Hospitalwesens in der italienischen Frührenaissance</italic> (Cologne: Abt. Architektur des Kunsthistorischen Instituts der Universität zu Köln, 1981), esp. 139–47; cf.

Oleg Grabar (Vienna: Böhlau, 1985), 73–81. Gulru Necipoglu-Kafadar regarded the method, described by Filarete in Lib. XIV, of drawing plans to scale by using a checkered grid subdivided into smaller squares corresponding to multiples of the cubit as having been influenced by grid-based plans from the East. See Gulru Necipoglu-Kafadar, "Plans and Models in 15th- and 16th-Century Ottoman Architectural Practice," <italic>JSAH</italic> 45 (1986), 224–43, esp. 233–34.</p>

In a letter to Filippo Maria Visconti dating from 1443, Ciriaco d'Ancona himself testifies that during his travels across "the sea or the egyptian Nile or the immeasurable expanse of so much sand" he had made "proper sketches of all kinds of things, not only in words, but also in true and proper drawings"; cited after Phyllis Williams Lehmann,<italic> Cyriacus of Ancona's Egyptian Visit and Its Reflections in Gentile Bellini and Hieronymus Bosch</italic> (Locust Valley, N.Y.: Augustin, 1978), 10. The fact that Filarete was actually familiar with a sketch by Ciriaco and also made use of it is confirmed by the reproduction of Hadrian's tomb (Castel Sant'Angelo) in the depiction of the martyrdom of St. Peter on Filarete's bronze door in St. Peter's in Rome, which represents an exact replication from a source by Ciriaco preserved in a copy; see Bernard Ashmole, "Cyriac of Ancona," <italic>Proceedings of the British Academy</italic> 45 (1959), 25–42, esp. 36–38.</p>

IX, fol. 68v), as well as in the Üç Serefeli mosque in Edirne (1438–47), which until 1453 was the capital of the Ottoman Empire.

                  <p>Hermes Trismegistos was held to have been a contemporary and disciple of Moses, but was sometimes also regarded as his forerunner and teacher, as the famous depiction in the floor mosaic in Siena Cathedral of 1488 suggests. Zoroaster is sometimes placed directly alongside Hermes, and Filarete also mentions Zoroaster in the context of a list of inventors of the human arts (of magic, in this case) (Lib XIX, fol. 153v).</p>

                  <p>It may be recalled here that the assumption that older, "ancient" traditions had been preserved in a genuine form, or at least with less adulteration, in the East, in contrast to the West, was widespread in Filarete's time. See for example Vespasiano da Bisticci, on the Greek delegation at the Council of Ferrara/Florence in 1438/39: "I will not pass on without a word of special praise of the Greeks. For the last fifteen hundred years and more they have not altered the style of their dress; their clothes are of the same fashion now as they were in the time indicated." (Vespasiano da Bisticci, <italic>Renaissance Princes, Popes, and Prelates. The Vespasiano Memoirs: Lives of Illustrious Men of the XVth Century</italic>, trans. William George and Emily Waters (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1963), 26). This was also the reason for the paradoxical assumption that Arabic, as a language from the East, had preserved the language of Christ, which led to the introduction of numerous pseudo-Arabic inscriptions on robes and objects of sacred pictorial art from the late thirteenth century to the sixteenth century. See for example Rosamond E. Mack, "Oriental Script in Italian Paintings," in Rosamond E. Mack, <italic>Bazaar to Piazza. Islamic Trade and Italian Art, 1300–1600</italic> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002), 51–71.</p>

                  <p>Filarete's travel plan can be gleaned from a letter from his friend Filelfo dated July 30th, 1965, in which he asks a Byzantine acquaintance to take Filarete in; Peter Tigler, <italic>Die Architekturtheorie des Filarete</italic> (Berlin: de Gruyter, 1963), 6 (he was coming "for purposes of sightseeing"). The following year, however, Filarete was still in Florence (letter from Filelfo on 1 February 1466; Rudolf Georg Adam, "Francesco Filelfo at the court of Milan (1439–1481): A Contribution to the Study of Humanism in Northern Italy," Ph.D. thesis, University of Oxford, 1974, 2: 439). He most probably died there or, according to Vasari, in Rome, without ever reaching Constantinople or points beyond. The epigram by Filelfo mentioned earlier, dedicated to his architect friend, also appears to refer to Filareto's intended journey; see note 23, above. The following studies assume, rather unconvincingly, that Filarete did in fact travel to Constantinople and that he influenced building projects by Mehmet II there: Marcell Restle, "Bauplanung und Baugesinnung unter Mehmet II. Fâtih," <italic>Pantheon. Internationale Zeitschrift für Kunst</italic> 39 (1981), 361–67; and Gabriella Ferri Piccaluga, "Il rinnovamento urbanistico alla metà del XV secolo: Istanbul e la capitale del Ducato di Milano," <italic>Le città del Mediterraneo</italic>, 235–42.</p>
