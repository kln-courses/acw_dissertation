<plain_text><page sequence="1">Page Transformations Feminist Science Criticism and Critical Thinking by Lynn Nelson The description of a recent conference on critical thinking and science included the statement that "from a critical thinking perspective [science] is seen as both a promise and a threat" ("Critical Thinking: Focus on Science," at Montclair State Col- lege). No doubt the "promise" referred to would seem self evident, but I suspect the suggestion that science might constitute a threat to critical thinking would seem strange to many. Indeed, one might view scientific method as constituting the core and characterizing the spirit of critical thinking. I agree, to a point (and the source of that qualification will become clear), but I will argue here that many students do not have an adequate sense of the epistemology of science - thus, they do not have an ade- quate model of critical thinking. Indeed, the model they do have of the epistemology of science works to undermine critical think- ing. I begin by sketching the views of science and mathematics that I have found to be common among students in the philosophy of science and logic courses which I teach, views that mystify science and its epistemol- ogy. I will then outline some strategies for encouraging a more sophisticated under- standing of the relationship between our theories and the evidence we have for them, and relate this understanding to some cur- rent work in critical thinking. The strategies I will suggest make use of issues raised in and by feminist science criticism. There are, of course, other ways to foster some of the kinds of thinking in and about science I will advocate, but feminist science criticism is particularly useful in some specific ways. Feminist criticism reveals that values, gen- der, and politics are factors at work in scien- tific theorizing, not just in cases of bad sci- ence but in good science as well. The view of science underwriting my suggestions is empiricist, and it relies heavily on Quine's philosophy of science and recent feminist science criticism. Discovering the one true theory a piece at a time Many of our students view the sciences and mathematics as fundamentally autonomous, monolithic, and cumulative enterprises that are engaged in the project of discovering "the one, true theory" about how things are. Gaining scientific knowl- edge, on their view, is itself a rather passive affair: that is, however much scientists need to do by way of inventing and testing hypotheses, designing experiments, collect- ing data, and so on, so that the truth can "emerge", the "acquisition" of knowledge really involves just looking - albeit, very careful and well prepared looking. The sources for these views are several. First, insofar as students think of science as an activity at all, many are of the view that, if science is a process, it is, as Karl Pop- per puts things, "a process without a subject" (Popper, 1972). The common understand- ing of Popper's claim is that the directions of research, the distributions of knowledge and ignorance (the things we come to know about and those we do not) and, ultimately, the content of scientific knowledge are somehow determined inexorably by a logic of inquiry and the world, unless we make mistakes or tinker with the evidence. (In fairness to Popper, his view is somewhat more sophisticated.) Thus, in the end, Lynn Nelson is Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Glassboro State College, New Jersey.</page><page sequence="2">Feminist Science Criticism Page although evidence may be, paraphrasing Thomas Kuhn, "that collected with difficul- ty" (Kuhn 1970), it is also, in some real sense, "self- announcing." And, in keeping with both a Kuhnian account and those developed in the post-positivist tradition of Carl Hempel and Ernst Nagel, the notion that science is a process without a subject draws on the view that science is an . .students often have little or no sense of what constitutes evidence, or the nature or the strength of the evidence 'ue have (or could have) for our theories. . " autonomous enterprise: a self-regulating activity, detached from common sense and, in NagePs words, "from things men [sic] value" (Nagel 1961; Nelson 1990). The rather passive epistemology I have outlined and the notion of basically autonomous sciences both underwrite and are reinforced by a particular view of the history of science: namely, that prior to the discovery of current theories, the history of science was, by and large, a series of blun- ders from which scientists have now (some- how) emerged to "see" the truth that was waiting for them all along, but about which their predecessors made mistakes. (Indeed, in terms of mathematics and formal logic, most of our students are unaware that these fields even have histories.) I suggest that among the more important factors underwriting the epistemology and the view of the history of science that I have outlined are these: students rarely see con- nections between a particular theory or research program and other going scientific and common-sense theories; they are largely unaware of relationships between scientific theories and research questions on the one hand, and current social and political con- texts and concerns on the other; and they have little, if any, familiarity with the rela- tionship between theory and observation. To put matters another way, they have little sense of how much is "on the line" when we "test a theory," of the inter-dependence of our various ways of organizing and predict- ing experience, including that between common sense and science. [The epistemol- ogy I have outlined further relies on the notion that there is a unique, true story that will enable us to organize and predict experi- ence. I will not address the last directly here, but I suggest that Quine's arguments against there being a unique story commensurate with our experiences can be used to explore the idea that innumerable theories, perhaps incompatible with one another, would be compatible with our experience, and would enable us to both explain and predict the latter. Among the things gained by atten- tion to Quine's arguments is the recognition that science is, as Quine puts things, "a bridge of our own making." As will become clear in what follows, this is not to say that theories are not constrained by evidence]. I take these several views as indications that students often have little or no sense of what constitutes evidence, or the nature or the strength of the evidence we have (or could have) for our theories - at least none beyond the well repudiated view that straightforward observation of an "untheo- rized world" can conclusively confirm or fal- sify an individual hypothesis or theory. But, of course, the models of knowledge and of knowing that I have sketched are fundamentally undermined by the history of science and work in philosophy of science over the last three decades. I will later sug- gest they are also challenged by current work in feminist science criticism, in partic- ular as the latter challenges the notion that we are largely passive recipients of evidence - at least when things are going right. The</page><page sequence="3">Page ransformations models are also fundamentally opposed to the assumptions underwriting a good deal of current work in critical thinking, at least those with which I am in sympathy and will explore. And a more subtle but no less wor- risome consequence of these models is that they underwrite ideals of knowledge and objectivity that reinforce a basic division between the so-called "hard sciences" and the "softer" disciplines: more specifically, that it is only in terms of the latter that con- textual thinking and values do, or should, play a role. Thus, the contextual, pluralistic, and engaged ways of approaching questions and issues that many of us are exploring and advocating can be safely passed up, and any insights gained by more inclusive ways of thinking safely ignored, if we are of a mind - and/or when we are being really serious, e.g., when we are doing science or mathe- matics. From my point of view, both the models and their several consequences - including a basically schizophrenic curricu- lum - are simply unacceptable. Critical thinking The strategies I will suggest for challeng- ing these views presume some notions about critical thinking, and I will briefly sketch these, drawing on the work of Craig Nelson, a molecular biologist who has redesigned his goals and methods in teaching evolutionary biology and genetics (Nelson 1989). Two qualifications are in order. First, Nelson's schema and those on which he draws are richer than my summary will suggest. (Nel- son builds on the work of William Perry 1970, 1981 and Belenky et al. 1986). Sec- ond, I am not concerned to defend the specifics of his schema or the notion that there are discrete "stages" in ways of think- ing. I want to use Nelson's insights, and those of Belenky et al., to clarify the kinds of thinking in and about science that I suggest we encourage. I have chosen these models because they are in keeping with an empiri- cist account of evidence - at least a post- Quinean account of the latter - that has evolved in the light of feminist science criti- cism. Nelson outlines four stages or "modes of thinking" and suggests strategies for enabling students to make the transitions between these (Nelson 1989). His account of the first stage, which he calls a "Sgt. Fri- day mode of thinking" in which students demand "the truth and nothing but the truth," is significantly like the views of knowledge and knowing I earlier attributed to many of our students. (Nelson draws on the notion of "Received Knowledge" out- lined in Belenky et al. and that of "dualism" outlined in Perry 1970.) For students to move beyond this stage, Nelson argues, requires that they become familiar and ultimately comfortable with the notion that uncertainty is part and parcel of science. Attention to the history of science, in particular to its now discarded theories, and to the current half-life of theories in particularly dynamic areas, are ways of intro- ducing uncertainty. In more general terms, I would add, students need to become familiar with what Quine calls the "under-determi- nation" of all theories by the evidence we have, or could have, for them (Quine 1966; Nelson 1990). That is, we need to under- score the tentativeness of scientific theoriz- ing: that, in Quine's words, there is "play" or "slack" between even the whole of our going theories and all of our experiences. But, Nelson notes, as important to criti- cal thinking as the recognition of uncertain- ty is, it does not automatically lead to a sound view of the epistemology of science or to ways of thinking that are critical. For one thing, the recognition of uncertainty often prompts what Nelson calls "Baskin Robbins" thinking that, roughly speaking, "if knowl- edge isn't objective, then it is personal and</page><page sequence="4">Femmist Science Criticism Page intuitive ... and each person's view is good for him or her" (Nelson 1989). Thus, for some students, Nelson laments, stressing that the evidence warrants rather than proves the belief that evolution occurred, leads to the conclusion that "since evolution is not certainly true, I can legitimately ignore it" (Nelson 1989). Nelson argues that a first step in helping students to recognize that opinion is insuffi- cient (and, I would add, that not all beliefs are created equal) is helping them to under- stand and appreciate the criteria and evi- dence used within a field to select preferable claims or theories (Nelson 1989), a way of thinking he calls "contextual relativism." Here, the criteria and methods by which choices are made, and claims and beliefs are offered and evaluated, are clearly articulated and characterized as discipline-specific and, in more general terms, as context specific. Thus, I suggest, in our attention to the his- tory of science, we need to not just provide a litany of now discarded theories; we need to explore the reasons why such theories were, at one time, appropriately viewed as viable, and the reasons why they were ultimately discarded. But, of course, although "contextual rela- tivism" represents an advance over the first two stages, it also has severe limitations, as Kuhn's notion of incommensurability reminds us (Kuhn 1970, Nelson 1990). Contextual relativism, Nelson points out, does not permit us to "compare scientific paradigms, choose appropriate applications in complex situations, or understand the interrelationships between science and pub- lic policy" (Nelson 1989). Each of the situa- tions Nelson cites would require the ability to relate, and perhaps make choices between, different, and in some cases com- peting, criteria. That ability, which, following Belenky et al., Nelson calls "constructed knowing," requires that one be able to "delineate the values that underlie a field's criteria and its applications, demonstrate a fielďs limits, and relate [these] to other fields or contexts" (Nelson 1989). Further, Nelson notes, the necessity of comparing and evaluating disci- plinary or context-specific criteria requires that students draw on their own values in making comparisons and choices, that they be active and engaged participants in the process. In Nelson's words, "mature, critical thinking ... involves the ability and willing- ness to address tradeoffs and articulate why [one] advocates a particular approach ... and to take responsibility for the validity of one's beliefs and for making a difference in the world" (Nelson 1989). Alternatively put, approaches and theories are viewed and evaluated within a larger context of going beliefs and practices, including values. It is only when students are thinking in these ways, Nelson argues, that we can say "liberal education has worked." And, I suggest, it is only when students (and the rest of us) rec- ognize that such "ways of thinking" are both operative in and appropriate to science, no less than other areas, that we can say that critical thinking in and about science can take place. Constructed knowing and feminist science criticism I will now outline some issues raised in and by feminist science criticism which indicate that what Nelson calls "constructed knowing" is, in fact, commensurate with a sufficiently inclusive and empiricist account of evidence. By the latter I mean an account of evidence in which experience, broadly construed to include so-called "common- sense" experience, and our most inclusive theory of nature, also broadly construed to include our values and politics, are recog- nized as the constraints on claims and theo- ries. Feminist science criticism is, of course,</page><page sequence="5">Page Transformations too extensive and dynamic (and, on my view, too important) to summarize and I want to be able to consider some of its implications in detail. So I will focus here on one aspect of that criticism, that which is concerned with androcentrism in science, and explore one instance of the latter: an organizing principle at work in "man, the hunter" theory of human evolution - and, it turns out, in a number of other fields. Feminist scientists and science critics point out that research into animal and human behavior and social organization often incorporates the basic organizing prin- ciple that males are socially oriented - " Feminist scientists and science critics point out that research into animal and human behavior and social organization often incorporates the basic organizing principle that males are sociaäy orient- ed . . . and females are biologically oriented . . . " their activities skilled and determining of social organization, and females are biologi- cally oriented - their activities "natural," unskilled, and largely without consequence for the social dynamics of human and ani- mal groups. In models and theories incorpo- rating the assumption, females are satellites to male actors who determine and dominate social dynamics (Hubbard 1983, Bleier 1983) . As feminist critics note, "man, the hunter" theory incorporates this organizing principle, and credits the evolution of Homosapiens to what are assumed to be activities and behaviors that were engaged in and exhibited by our male ancestors. Females, on the other hand, appear to have gotten a free "evolutionary ride" - for, according to the theory, they were menstru- ating, childbearing, lactating, and childrear- ing, but none of these activities contributed to the evolution of bipedalist and speaking "man," or to the development of the hierar- chical, social arrangements that "man, the hunter" theorists assume characterized early hominid and human groups. Feminists argue that there are fundamen- tal problems with this account and that some of these are directly related to the androcentric organizing principle used by its advocates. For one thing, they argue, we have no reason to assume that our female ancestors were completely occupied with procreation and childrearing activities, that they were dependent on male providers, or that male dominance hierarchies character- ized the social dynamics of early hominid and human groups (Hubbard 1983). But, in fact, things are not as straightfor- ward as the criticism, so stated, would sug- gest. Some "man, the hunter" theorists sim- ply assume or declare that males were dominant and the only hunters. But others use accounts in anthropology of the social dynamics in contemporary hunter-gatherer societies as evidence for early human behav- ior and social organization, including accounts of gender roles and behavior, and divisions of labor and power by gender, in these societies. Some advocates of "man, the hunter" theory also have drawn on work in primatology and animal sociology, and used these as evidence for the view of early human social groups incorporated in the theory. However, feminists in anthropology (Tanner and Zihlman 1976, Hubbard 1983), primatology (Haraway 1988), and the biobe- havioral sciences (Haraway 1978 A, 1978B) argue that the organizing principle at issue, the social- male/natural-fe male dichotomy, is at work in these fields as well. They argue that it shapes, and ultimately distorts, accounts of the social dynamics and behav-</page><page sequence="6">Feminist Science Criticism Page ior of primate groups and of the social dynamics, including gender arrangements, in contemporary hunter/gatherer societies. In short, feminist science criticism reveals a substantial feedback system across fields and sciences that serves to reinforce the organiz- ing principle that is necessary to the "man, the hunter" account of human evolution (Bleier 1988, Harding 1986, Nelson 1990) . The consequences of the organizing prin- ciple (or, more correctly, a cluster of conse- quences) are beginning to emerge in cross- cultural and historical studies, and research in primatology and animal sociology, that are not shaped by the organizing principle. Among the results are the following: first, the principle has precluded recognition and analysis of the interaction between so-called "reproductive activities" and productive activities, of the variation in procreative and reproductive activities, and of the relation- ships between such variation and other fea- tures of the social and physical environment (Bleier 1983, Hubbard 1983, and Nelson 1990). And in terms of the specifics of "man, the hunter theory," feminists argue, the emphasis on male behavior and activi- ties has effectively precluded analysis of the role that procreative and other so-called reproductive activities would have played in human evolution; when we do take these activities into account, alternative accounts of human evolution, and of the social dynamics of various human and animal groups, gain plausibility (Hubbard 1983). In one alternative account of human evo- lution, "woman, the gatherer" theory, women's activities as gatherers and mothers are viewed as central factors, with the greater dependency of the young (the solu- tion to the "obstetrical dilemma"), the envi- ronmental pressures for bipedalism, and the importance of women's gathering for them- selves and their young, placing at least equal selection pressure on females for tool use, language, cooperation, and social organiza- tion (Slocum 1975). Now, I suggest that this debate, and the point holds as well for other issues raised in and by feminist science criticism, can be used to encourage a more sophisticated and critical understanding of evidence - thus, a more sound view of the epistemology of sci- ence and a more sound model of critical thinking. I want to begin by clarifying what, on my view, the debate is and is not about. First, although several issues I have outlined can be used to introduce and explore the relationship between theory and observation (one might, for example, explore the conse- quences of the organizing principle by com- paring frameworks within which single-male primate groups are harems" to those within which these males are "studs"), the really interesting implications of the issues we have considered do not include the "theory- ladenness" of observation. The issue of the relationship of observation to theory was settled thirty years ago. Feminist critics are not attempting to establish that observation is theory-laden and, if they were, they would not be raising new or interesting issues. But there are new results: we had not expected that our assumptions about or experiences of gender might be factors in scientific theoriz- ing, but feminist criticism of "man, the hunter theory," and of the theories on which it built, indicates that they are. It is also important to underscore that the connections exposed between methodolo- gies, assumptions, and theories among fields and sciences are not themselves problemat- ic. If we recognize fundamental connections between all of our going theories, a view Quine long ago advocated and the example we have considered and other issues in femi- nist criticism support, we would expect to find connections between "man, the hunter" theory and others of our going theories. Indeed, synthesizing results and theories is a</page><page sequence="7">Page Transformations mark of good science and it has led to great breakthroughs, Darwin's account of natural selection among them. In any event, we cer- tainly dó not expect or demand that each research project begin from scratch (indeed, I hope we recognize that this is not even possible). Nor would we expect an account of human evolution to ignore primatology, anthropology, or animal sociology, any more than we would expect it to ignore going the- ories in population genetics, paleontology, or geology. (We do, however, need to be clear that assuming that primate behavior or contemporary hunter/gatherer societies can provide clues into early hominid and human behavior, is also dependent on a large body of theory and not "self-evident".) Finally, those criticizing "man, the hunter" theory and/or developing "woman, the gatherer" theory are by no means working in a vacu- um. Like "man, the hunter" theorists, they are synthesizing developments and work in primatology, anthropology, and biology and, in particular, work that was not organized along the lines of the male/female dichoto- my we have considered. Moreover, decisions to explore or adopt such accounts are them- selves dependent, at least in part, on other research that indicates that such assump- tions lead to partial or distorted accounts of social behavior and dynamics. The decisions are also, of course, dependent on a larger body of feminist experience and criticism that includes "common-sense" assumptions about gender and social practices. An example will clarify the point. A mat- ter of current debate between the advocates of these two theories of human evolution is the significance of chipped stones found near fossil remains of Homo erectus (Longi- no and Doell 1988). Are they evidence of male tool-making for the hunting of large animals as "man, the hunter1 theorists assume, or evidence that women were mak- ing tools to assist them in gathering, or evi- dence of some other activity that some future theory might posit? I am suggesting that the evidence and assumptions we would bring to bear on the question of their significance is vast, or more to the point, that current work in primatolo- gy and anthropology and a host of other fields will constitute part of the evidence for an explanation of the stones. Moreover, the very existence of feminist science criticism, no less than its findings, indicates that part of what we will bring to bear on the ques- tion of their significance are our experiences of and views about gender. Again, it is not the connections among scientific theories, the borrowing of methodologies or results, that are new or problematic. What is new (and, on some views of science, problemat- ic) is the evidence that "extra-scientific" experience and views, and in particular those that are recognized as value laden and political, play a role in scientific theorizing. That role is evident both in androcentric theories and methodologies, and in feminist criticism of these. Feminist criticism of "man, the hunter" theory can also be used to explore what Nel- son calls "the unavoidability of uncertainty". On the most obvious level, feminist criti- cism and the existence of two alternative accounts of human evolution illustrate some of the constraints on historical explanation. In reconstructing human evolution, we need to contend with the relative lack of evi- dence and its unevenness (in terms of the question of female and male contributions, for example, we need to take into account that things like metal tools will survive and that baskets will not, and so on). But these problems are not the most telling. Having an abundance of evidence would not, as Sandra Harding points out, "provide us with a goddess's eye view" of human evolution. We would still need to decide what is to count as evidence for any</page><page sequence="8">Feminist Science Criticism Page such story, and going theories and current context will play a central role at every stage. In short, standards and notions of evi' dence emerge concomitantly in the process of constructing theories - they are not laid down "prior to" that process (Nelson 1990). Of far more significance in terms of using this example to explore the notion of evi- dence, the slippage between the amount of evidence available and the stories we tell, and the role that a larger body of going the- ory plays in shaping our construal of what constitutes evidence, are factors in all our theorizing, not just historical explanation. Feminist criticism of models in primatol- ogy, animal sociology, and the biobehavioral sciences, models from which "man, the hunter" theorists have drawn, can also be used to explore some difficulties in and with our current approaches to other species: among these, that our descriptions of other species often make animals sound as if they are people in fur coats, and the conse- quences of this. We might eventually replace our descriptions of other species with ones that are more in keeping with what it is reasonable to say of species whose neural capacities could not support much of what we now say. But for now at least our descriptions are bound to reflect the fact that humans are doing the observing. Prior to feminist criti- cism we might have been willing to say that such descriptions will always be deeply anthropomorphic, but feminist criticism indicates that they have also been funda- mentally androcentric. Two other points about our accounts of other species can be made. First, we can consider feminist criticism of ontologies that include such strange scientific objects as "female coyness," "rampant machismo among male insects," "b ees raping flowers," and primate "harems." I say "strange" because the criteria for these objects are fuzzy at best: what, for example, are the behavioral criteria for maintaining that female worms and female humans, and indeed the females of all species, are "coy?" Moreover, the criticism is not properly con- strued as being about language. Each of the objects I have listed is deeply embedded in accounts of social behavior and dynamics, and each functions in explanations. (More specifically, each is currently incorporated in the notion of "inclusive fitness" devel- oped by Sociobiologists. ) For this reason, calling the behaviors or social arrangements posited in such theories something other than the names listed above makes no differ- ence. And we need to make the point that a theory will be only as good, as serious, as constrained by evidence, as the objects it posits . Second, and the point holds as well for reconstructions of the behaviors and social arrangements of early hominids, not only do the behaviors and social arrangements we posit for other species show unmistakable relationships to our views about human behavior, our descriptions of other species are often used as evidence for the "natural- ness" or universality of these. In more gener- al terms, our accounts of other species are used as clues to our own. In short, our approaches to other species have conse- quences, some of them perhaps narrower than others, but they matter. An obvious example of their consequences is the use by Sociobiologists of their descriptions of the behavior of ducks, bees, and primates as evi- dence for the genetic determination of rape, divisions in labor and power by gender, and male aggression (Bleier 1983, Haraway 1988, and Nelson 1990). What have these various issues to do with critical thinking? I think there are two points that are deeply related but worth sep- arating. Both have to do with evidence. The first is that what I have been advocating, at</page><page sequence="9">Page Transformations bottom, is a Quinean view of evidence - I would call it a "coherence account of evi- dence" - according to which theories and claims are constrained both by experience and a going system of inter-related and interdependent theories. Feminists in vari- ous sciences and their nonfeminist col- leagues have worked within the constraints of a going body of theory, including scientif- "To try to separate feminist criticism of 'man the hunter ' theory , primatology , or anthropology from feminist politics would be as ludicrous as trying to sepa- rate the androcentrism feminist criticism revealed in science from the androcen- trism and sexism in the societies in which science is practiced . " ic and "common- sense" theories, and they could do nothing else. There are no archimedean standpoints. The viability of questions, hypotheses, and theories is rela- tive to a current state of science, broadly construed. A further implication of the issues we have considered is that the relationship between what we will countenance as evi- dence and going theories does not limit us to "contextual relativism" or condemn us to incommensurabilities. Those advocating "man, the hunter" theory and "woman, the gatherer" theory disagree about some things (indeed, we might suspect, a lot of things), but not everything. They can, for example, meaningfully discuss, and disagree about, the significance of chipped stones (as, in Kuhn' s celebrated example of alleged incommensu- rability, Galileo and his inquisitors could discuss torture instruments and Aristotelian physics). Neither theory is a closed system, for we have seen that neither is isolatable from a larger body of theory - including common-sense beliefs - and on large parts of that larger body "man, the hunter" and "woman, the gatherer" theorists will agree. The second point is also about evidence, but it involves a more inclusive notion of the latter than most empiricists have been willing to countenance (Nelson 1990). The difference of consequence between Quine' s account of evidence and that which feminist science criticism warrants - the more inclusive holism I have been advocating - is that the latter reveals that values, gender, and politics are factors in scientific theoriz- ing. That is, the issues we have considered are evidence that the ways of thinking Nel- son calls "constructed knowing" are at work in science. Now we might take the moral to be that, given different or neutral assumptions about gender, we could return to science "as usual" - or that what we need are stricter method- ological controls to filter out all of the polit- ical and gendered noise. But I don't see how we can understand the moral as such, in large part because the relationships between political context and experiences including those of gender, and our approaches to nature, are neither overcome nor absent in feminist criticism. To try to separate feminist criticism of "man the hunter" theory, primatology, or anthropology from feminist politics would be as ludicrous as trying to separate the androcentrism feminist criticism revealed in science from the androcentrism and sexism in the societies in which science is prac- ticed. And unless we are willing to claim that feminists have been doing something other than constructing theories and posit- ing objects, discovering relationships between experiences as well as theories, sub- jecting methodologies, ontologies, and claims to critical evaluation, and paying attention to evidence, we need to conclude</page><page sequence="10">Feminist Science Criticism Page that feminist science criticism is properly construed as within science. What this suggests is that the difference between this work and "science as usual" is that feminists are self-conscious in their inclusion of values, self-conscious of the relationship between their experiences of politics, including those of gender, and the theorizing they do within science communi- ties; conscious of the deep relationships between scientific ontologies and theories and our so-called "common-sense" views of human and nonhuman nature; and that they insist on scrutinizing and evaluating both and their inter-relationships. The basis for my earlier qualification - that it is only to a point that science charac- terizes the spirit of critical thinking - is now clear. What I am here calling "science as usual" is not, for a variety of reasons, self- conscious of these things. But feminist sci- ence criticism indicates that attention to the values underlying, incorporated within, and justified by the theorizing done in sci- ence communities is integral to critical thinking and to good science. It indicates, in short, that "constructed knowing" is at work and appropriate in science. References Belenky, M.F., B.M. Clinchy, N.R. Goldberger, and J.R. Tarule, Women's Ways of Know- ing.

It does not claim to be value neutral.. .By focusing on 'political man1, Political Science generates a partial and faulty picture of political life that provides little sense of what really takes place. It offers observations of formal institution, but leaves unexamined large areas of social and economic life that reflect politi- cal activity." Leslie Hill, 1990 Summer Institute</page></plain_text>
