<plain_text><page sequence="1">Competing with "the barbarous clangour of a gong": Why 'Theme of the Traitor and the Hero" begins in "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen" Rebecca Sheehan Haverford College This essay examines the influence of William Butler Yeats s conception of history in his poem, "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen," on the rhetorical figure of the labyrinth, the negotiations between history and memory and the inspiration of Nietzsche's philosophy of language on two stories from Jorge Luis Borgess 1944 collection, Artificios. It begins by examining the lines from Yeats s poem that comprise the epigraph to Borgess "Theme of the Traitor and the Hero," and goes on to propose that Yeats s conception of memory as catachrestic, particularly the notion of a "great memory' which he borrows from Shelley, was a central influence on Borgess thoughts on authorship, language and history. By focusing on Borges as a reader of Yeats, this essay lends a degree of literary depth to dis cussions that link Artificios to the influence ofFriedrich Nietzsche's 1873 essays. It also lends a more detailed analysis to the relationship between Borges and Irish modernism. Keywords: Jorge Luis Borges / W.B. Yeats / Friedrich Nietzsche / modernism (literature), Ireland / modernism (literature), South America Jorge Luis Borges situates his 1944 "Theme of the Traitor and the Hero" in Ireland, for, as his narrator claims "the convenience of the narrative." The action of the plot, the narrator insists, maintains such structural integrity in the abstract as to possibly occur in "[any] oppressed and tenacious country; Poland, Ireland ... a Balkan or South American state"(Borges 143). But the fact remains, despite the narrator s initial ambivalence about whether he will tell the story at all and then this nonchalance over where to set it, that "Theme of the Traitor and the Hero" is an Irish story. This essay concentrates on the fact of the story's location in Ireland, a fact to which the narrator's trepidation paradoxically draws our atten tion, as essential to understanding the debt this "theme" owes to Yeats's "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen," the poem from which "Theme of the Traitor and the Hero" takes its epigraph. Critics have paid little to no attention to this epigraph in</page><page sequence="2">Competing with "the barbarous clangour of a gong" 23 discussing the story's impressive logical twists, its insights into "metahistory" and even its "Irishness."1 At all levels?the metaphysical, the historical, the personal?"Nineteen Hun dred and Nineteen" demonstrates its exemplary labyrinthine structure, which the poem highlights. As Toby Foshay puts it, "[the events of the moment in the poem are] not unique but a cyclical repetition of the "gyre" of history" (105). It thereby resonates not only with the "theme" of this story, but also with that rhetorical struc ture of Borges's work that consists of the conversion and re-conversion of reader into writer, outside into inside, fact into fiction. This characteristic, perhaps best figured by the persistent presence of the labyrinth in his work, emerges as an image that also appears in Yeats's "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen" at a most compelling moment. In his article, "Dismembering and Disremembering in Nietzsche's 'On Truth and Lying in the Nonmoral Sense,'"J. Hillis Miller invokes Yeats's labyrinth as an emblem of man's effort to curb the chaos of history and nature that charac terize the linguistic turn in philosophy and modernism. Following upon Miller's gesture to "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen," this essay considers how Yeats's poem reflects the problem of subjective language with which Nietzsche's essay collides for Miller. I propose that Yeats's eloquent articulation of that problem is what draws Borges to "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen," as much as it draws him to what has been termed Nietzsche's "perspectivalism."With the shared figure of the labyrinth in mind, the irony that emerges in Yeats's treatment of history and its repetition in "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen," shapes the poignant attitude and commentary not only of Borges's "Theme of the Traitor and the Hero," but also "Funes, the Memorious," also published in Borges's 1944 collection, Artificios. The influence of Nietzsche's "Truth and Lying in the Extra-Moral Sense" and "On the Utility of History, "both written in 1873, upon Borges's story of "Funes, the memorious," has been noted by Clancy Martin's article, "Borges Forgets Nietzsche" and by Roxana Kreimer's "Nietzsche, autor de 'Funes, el memorioso': Critica al saber residual de la modernidad."The substantial influence of Yeats's thought on the process of inverted agency and the transgression of narrative limits that occurs in "Theme of the Traitor and the Hero," as well as the sympathy between the subjective "flaw" of Nietzsche's essay and the concern of "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen," makes it difficult to overlook Yeats as an aesthetic and philosophical influence on "Funes, the Memorious." The influences of Nietzsche and Yeats on this story illuminates a dialectic between the individual and history shared by the two stories from Artificios, but also provide another way of understanding the his torical stakes that underlie the impetus for Funes's character. Here, Yeats's notion of the "great Memory," a notion central to "The Tower," a poem for which Borges avowed a fraught sympathy, plays an important role in the paralyzing memory of Funes. A parallel between The Tower and Artificios emerges by examining Yeats's poem "The Tower," a poem above all about memory, as a possible influence upon Borges's story, "Funes, the Memorious," a work concerned with the total and para lyzing memory of its main character. The parallel concern over the saturation of</page><page sequence="3">24 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 32, Number 3 the present with the past that emerges in these works extends from the subjective to the historical when we consider alongside one another Borgess "Theme of the Traitor and the Hero," and Yeats "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen," two works that explicitly contemplate history's encroachment upon the present, its repeti tions and predictions. The intervention of subjective memory into historical time and vice versa, an intervention traceable through the rhetorical structure of the conflations of subject and object persistent in "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen" corresponds with the authorial inversions in Borges's "Theme of the Traitor and the Hero," between reader and writer and character and author. The transgressions of narrative authority here correspond with the displacement of history from the past to the present to imagine a subjective agency over mindless repetition, revealing a particular sympathy with the ironic imagination behind Funes's total systems and the realization in "The Tower," that the Great Memory which threatens to replace lived experience also consists of the poet and his own youth. "Theme of the Traitor and the Hero" begins with the lines from the second poem of Yeats's "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen," So the Platonic Year Whirls out new right and wrong, Whirls in the old instead; All men are dancers and their tread Goes to the barbarous clangour of a gong. (54-58) The structure of the wordplay in these lines recurs at other points in the poem, comprising a persistent theme. A closer look at how this play functions reveals the logic these instances unite to form over the course of the poem as it utilizes turns of phrase that suggest opposite notions coincident to the same expression, comprising lines that teeter on paradox. Between lines 55 and 56, "Whirls out new right and wrong / Whirls in the old instead," (55-56) the first sets the second up as polyva lent, containing meanings at similar variance to one another as the carefree dance stands to the measured clangour of a gong in the later lines. The reader is left to wonder whether "Whirls in" is to participate in a binary relationship with "Whirls out" to mean its opposite, absorption rather than production. On the other hand, "in" is?unlike "out"?at once process and preposition, thus there is a possibility that the whirling out of new right and wrong takes place within "the old," rather than beside it, after or before it. In other words, by contrast to ". . . the Platonic Year / whirls out new right and wrong," (54-55) "Whirls in the old . . ." (56) could be understood as reading that the Platonic year "whirls in" the old right and wrong, that is, that it absorbs it, that "whirling in" is a process in a similar relation to "whirling out" as a fan going in one direction might be to a fan going in the other. It is clear though that "in"?unlike "out"?has meaning as a preposition, in addition to its possible function as part of a verb phrase. "Whirls in," could also be read as shorthand for "Whirls within." This reading makes more tangible the reason Borges chose from "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen'Tines containing such</page><page sequence="4">Competing with "the barbarous clangour of a gong" 25 a double-entendre. The two ways in which "Whirls in" may be understood confuse it as a deixis or point of reference in the poem. The structure of this confusion offers a grammatical model for the rhetorical structure of Borges's story, a structure that looks further to the figure of the labyrinth that constructs and figures in Borges's collective works. The doubling this confusion presents emerges as a salient feature in the narrative of Borges's "Theme of the Traitor and the Hero." The mechanics of the double-entendre, specifically the surprise meaning of a phrase that reframes its reception, also belies the conflation of author, reader and character that creates the shifting context and unstable agency that drives the plot of "Theme of the Traitor and the Hero." Just as Ryan, the character narrating his grandfather's his tory, finds that his task has been inscribed by the characters of the past he narrates, the historical events of the present find themselves determined by the structure of their object of study. Narrative progress in "Theme of the Traitor and the Hero" emerges as the sudden realization of having been inscribed by the historical object of study all along. This problematic locates the disturbing conflation of subject and object beside a disruption to diachronic history where the present, rather than being newer than the past, exists in limbo with it. Hence the appropriateness of Yeats's description of "the Platonic year" whirling in and so, changing the old, at the same time that it "whirls in," that is, within the old, "instead." Toby Foshay notes with regard to the structure of "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen" that Yeats, in the notes to the poem, refers to the sixth section as "the sixth poem." Foshay argues, "The notion of separate poems under a single title, as against separate sections of the same poem, changes our impression of the relation of part to whole. In terms of the chronology of the poem as a whole, the self containment of each unit implies less a diachronic relation of sections than a syn chronic one; that is, the poems are less consecutive than contemporaneous" (102). The changing relationship of part to whole that Foshay observes is compelling in light of the word play I examine for the "contemporaneous" relationship he notes. Focusing on this aspect of the poem's structure reveals how its very frame plays against diachronic time, in favor of the coincidence of otherwise discrete moments and entities. The synchrony of parts ? and their seemingly unwitting participation in the whole?is an appropriate structural extension of the pattern of wordplay evident in Borges's epigram and similar instances in the poem. The lines Borges selected from Yeats's poem pose a grammatically precise instance of double-entendre that results in disrupting the poem's deixis that echoes throughout "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen'"s five parts. These lines characterize a larger trend both in the poem and in Yeats's thinking at this moment, evidenced by the trope of the gyre that structures his 1928 A Vision. The second stanza of "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen" ends, Public opinion ripening for so long We thought it would outlive all future days. O what fine thought we had because we thought That the worst rogues and rascals had died out. (13-16)</page><page sequence="5">26 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 32, Number 3 The repetition of "thought" in these lines presents the same cacophonic echo that contours the lines Borges chose for his epigraph. Their repetition also shares the same ability to confound the logic of position, as "thought" alternates in sense between verb and noun. "[F]ine thought" (15) is contained within the structure of the "we thought" (15), as its unwitting condition. But it also comes after "we thought," the unwitting condition of the present's situation in the past. The gram matical confusion to which this sentence is susceptible bears with it the conflation of inside and outside and of chronology found in the "Whirls out, ""Whirls in" par allel. This conflation is resonant with the conflations that structure "Theme of the Traitor and the Hero." The conditions of reference shift, depending on the use of "thought" in Yeats's lines; "thought" in line 15 could refer to a more general notion dependent upon the thought "that the worst rogues and rascals had died out," or it could be one and the same (singular) thought. The repetition involved in the linguistic play that permits deixis to become confused here presents an intrinsically historical problem. The repetition of history with the difference of learning what was/were the conditions of the present?too late as it were ? mirrors the condition of temporal confusion in Borges's story. The past writes its own future; the present in which Ryan writes his grandfather's history finds itself within a predicted structure he did not before recognize as encompassing him. At the end of the story we are told, "In Nolan's play, the passages taken from Shakespeare are the least dramatic ones; Ryan suspected that the author interpolated them so that someone, in the future, would be able to stumble upon the truth. Ryan realized that he, too, was part of Nolan's plot . . ." (Borges 146), just as in "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen," the "fine thought," unknowingly depends upon the assumption, or the "thought / That the worst rogues and rascals had died out" (15-16), and the Platonic Year as it "whirls out new right and wrong" (54-55), finds itself already inscribed within a structure where it "whirls in the old instead" (56). Part V of "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen" offers a final instance of a word in Yeats's poem whose unstable meaning ensues from its repetition lending the lines it comprises a power to suggest the conflation of contexts, points of reference and ultimately the relationship between subject and object. Commencing with the invocation, "Come let us mock . . ." (lines 93, 98,103), its last stanza takes this repeated phrase and from it constructs yet another instance of inversion: Mock mockers after that That would not lift a hand maybe To help good, wise or great To bar that foul storm out, for we Traffic in mockery. (108-112) To "mock mockers," or, indeed to "traffic in mockery," appeals to a process of catachresis by which reality is continuously and perpetually deferred by the repro duction of itself at another time, dissimulated from its original instance. In these lines, Yeats cynically critiques the dissimulation of politics whereby responsibility</page><page sequence="6">Competing with "the barbarous clangour of a gong" 21 or "truth" traffics only in difference, rather than generating a radically new platform. This line assumes a structural conflation (we mock mockers, ad infinitum) similar to the previous lines of the poem I've analyzed. It is also the one that projects this conflation as an active hypocrisy with human agency, rather than the fault of a history that is inescapable and tragic. Certainly, there is a resonance between the rhetorical structure of these lines and Yeats's A Vision. Understanding the mecha nism of these lines in the context of Yeats's notion of historical "gyres" makes even the subjective agency implied in part Vs accusatory tone reducible to a certain universal pattern of history that encompasses even mockers who mock mockers. In the mechanics of the gyre, critical discussions of Borges's "logic," espe cially as it constructs the peculiar authorial situation of "Theme of the Traitor and the Hero," should acknowledge yet another important coincidence with Yeats's thought. Kane X. Faucher's essay, "Modalities, Logic and the Cabala in Borges's 'Theme of the Traitor and the Hero'," describes the repetitive "history" that features in Borges's story, Time, in the Borgesian sense, is [a] vast historical stage that re-enacts the same moments with different actors. . . . With each passing era, and though the events repeat themselves, there is a building of the labyrinth, a synthesis of the universal "I" of some eternal watcher (the readers themselves?) through time itself For Borges, his tory is nemetic?a measure of all history?while the particularities or singularities (the people who are affected by the repeating events) are anamnetic: the Platonico Liebnizian doctrine of reminiscence. Time and history can be analogized as a kind of ammonite: the circular coiling away of events and the recoiling of events toward the center. (Faucher 136) What Faucher describes as an ammonite coincides with the process of Yeats's gyres that simultaneously coil in and out, retracing the past with a diffraction of differ ence. Toby Foshay argues that those lines from "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen" that begin with "the Platonic Year" (the ones Borges chose for his epigram) "point us to the import" of Yeats changing the poem's title which was originally "Thoughts on the Present State of the World" to "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen" (Foshay 105). He writes, in 1928, the six poems of "Thoughts . . ."were no longer "present." But they were a reflection within time on the nature of time. These poems were past but they were a point in time which turned on time and reflected it in "a troubled mirror" (III). . . . "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen" mirrors in its very numerology the consciousness that time finds its only permanence in the repetition of itself, of its "right and wrong" (II). Yeats, reflecting on the "Thoughts . . . ," saw that time reflected itself there, not in a mere circle but in a "gyre," not as "nineteen nineteen," but "nineteen hundred and nineteen."The centuries both extend linearly and return on themselves cyclically. (Foshay 105) Foshay goes on to argue in a footnote that "the philosophical reflections" of A Vision "... seem to have influenced [Yeats], specifically in his evocation of time as a gyre.'</page><page sequence="7">28 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 32, Number 3 The interpenetration of the cones of history, which is both linear and circular (as a gyre), is numerologically embodied in Yeats's final title" (Foshay 108). The distinc tion to be made between the repetitive nature of the circle, and the repetition with difference afforded by the gyre, becomes an important "theme" for Borges's story. The present's eclipse by the past is not complete, there is a space of ultimate aware ness (and surprise) over the coincidence of the present with the web of the past that itself supplies the potential for artifice. In "Theme of the Traitor and the Hero," Ryan's realizes that "[t]he idea that history might have copied history is mind boggling enough; that history could copy literature is inconceivable ..." (Borges 144). This enacts Yeats's gyre, making the cyclical nature of history susceptible to a productive avoidance of complete circularity by permitting the intervention of the literary subject. In "Theme of the Traitor and the Hero," this difference comes at the moment of Ryan's epiphany. This moment also affords him the agency to write of his grandfather, not as a traitor, but as a hero. "Ryan realized that he, too, was part of Nolan's plot. . . After long and stubborn deliberation, he decided to silence the discovery. He published a book dedicated to the hero's glory; that too, perhaps, had been foreseen" (Borges 146). Despite the past's augury, the present's arrival at consciousness of its foregone situation in history breaks the repetition. Following upon the visual nature of the gyre as a metaphor, this difference afforded by subjective consciousness interrupts an otherwise flat circle with a third dimension, an alternative to history's closure. This might be equated with what J. Hillis Miller argues emerges triumphantly in Nietzsche's "On Truth and Lying in the Extra-Moral Sense" through Nietzsche's unwitting employment of a coin metaphor that relies on metaphoric half-truths. "Man is the power of anthropomorphic substitution. For no instant can this power be suspended, for man would no longer be himself. His essence is neither consciousness, nor 'spirit,' nor 'selfhood,'but the power of making false transposi tions" (Miller 47). Miller argues further, "To coin metaphors or to coin metal into money are versions of the same activity, that activity of figuration without which man would not be himself" (49). To return to the title of Yeats's poem, the question that often arises, with refer ence to those other poems that contain dates (the political poems, "Easter 1916" "September 1913") is why Yeats did not title his poem "1919"? The written-out title evokes the difference with the diffraction of repetition that structures the gyre as much as it does the notion of an image in a troubled mirror that emerges in the third poem of "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen. "This poem concentrates on what Nietzsche might call the "false equivalences of metaphor" (Miller 49). The mirror's "troubling" character permits man's artifice to intervene in the determination of nature. In this way, the mirror image the title would become if it were numeric, "1919," is disrupted by spelling it out. Its presence in letters disrupts the mimicry implicit to "Nineteen Nineteen" by re-articulating the year as a sum of various parts. The title, "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen," consists of "Nineteen Hundred," and "Nineteen," just as the poem cycle is comprised of five discrete poems.</page><page sequence="8">Competing with "the barbarous clangour of a gong" 29 The influence of Nietzsche's 1872 essay "On Truth and Lying in the Extra Moral Sense" upon Borges's story of "Funes, the Memorious," is difficult to over look given the examples from Nietzsche's text that figure largely in the descriptions of Funes's world which comprise Borges's story. Clancy Martin's recently pub lished article, "Borges Forgets Nietzsche," discusses Borges's reliance on Nietzsche's "theory of perspectivism" in a story that, Martin argues, is ultimately interested in proving the psychological nature of "epistemological truth projects" (43). Read ing "Funes, the Memorious" with Nietzsche's essay alongside Yeats's "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen," it becomes clear that Borges is less interested in using the character of Funes to argue for the necessity of forgetting to thinking. He is, instead, more intrigued by the precarious position of the author himself (in the case of both Nietzsche and Yeats). The impact of Nietzsche's essay on Borges goes beyond Martin's argument, and also beyond the story of Funes. As Miller points out, Nietzsche's essay embodies a process of catachresis that has to be self-canceling for it constitutes a process that replaces truth claims with the "activity of figuration without which man would not be himself" (49). This is a process that, according to Miller, Nietzsche betrays unwittingly by using "false equivalence" to describe "false equivalence" while it becomes clear that the position of a subject's inscription by his object is a problem with which Yeats's poetry engages consciously. It is this process of conflation (to be found in Nietzsche's essay as well as Yeats's "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen") that most resembles the rhetorical process of dissimulation that transpires in the unstable deixis (between reader, writer and character) of Borges's "Theme of the Traitor and the Hero." Looking at "On Truth and Lying in the Extra-Moral Sense"?as Miller has suggested we do, as an essay that negates itself? another relationship emerges with Funes whose life is negated by memory. As the narrator tells us, "[Funes] would ... imagine himself at the bot tom of a river, rocked (and negated) by the current" (Borges 137). It is in the process of catachresis (as a process of perpetual negation) suggested by this image Funes generates of himself that Miller finds sympathy between the concerns Nietzsche expresses in "Truth and Lying in the Extra-Moral Sense" and the impetus for the figure of the labyrinth that features in Yeats's "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen." Given Borges's incorporation of "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen" in the collec tion where "Funes, the memorious" appears, we may ask whether well before Miller, Borges was conceiving of Nietzsche's perspectivalism in the context of Yeats and the role of the labyrinth. In the connection between what language sacrifices of the particular for Nietzsche and the power the "great Memory" wields to negate personal, lived experience emerges a concern Borges articulates about Yeats's life, and the lives of poets generally. Toby Foshay argues?in the interest of distinguishing "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen" from the Irish-Nationalist political poems with which it has often been discussed?that the problem Yeats articulates in this poem is not the "uniqueness of the events of the moment but that they were precisely not unique but a cyclical repetition of the gyre of history" (105). Foshay s description of Yeats's regard for</page><page sequence="9">30 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 32, Number 3 history helps us understand its value for Borges's story. It doesn't, however, go far enough in explaining the perpetual split in subjectivity that tempers and drives the poem. Indeed, Borges's story helps point to an aspect of "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen" that critics interested in its relationship to A Vision often overlook. Foshay describes the major conflict in the poem as its setting-up of an antithesis between the ordered world of society and the chaotic world of nature. "The poet turns from an ordered world in which society is protected and the natural world is harnessed to cultural and artistic form, to total chaos, where a demonic nature now harnesses man to inward chaos" (Foshay 103). Contrary to Foshay s assess ment that it is anti-thesis which determines the poem, I would argue that when one considers the poem's structure ? as I've illuminated in Borges's epigraph and those lines from "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen" I've read alongside it in?the fact emerges that chaos is found amid and even constituting culture. J. Hillis Miller's gesture to the "foul storm" and the "labyrinth" of "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen," in describing the problematic of Nietzsche's authorial intentions in "Truth and Lying in the Extra-Moral Sense," suggests a compelling argument for understanding Yeats's poem and its interest for Borges. Miller illu minates the problematic nature of Nietzsche's essay by arguing that". . . he is too entangled in the situation he is attempting to clarify. He can by no effort survey the situation as if from above, in a species of aerial photography of the human predicament. Nietzsche's language is neither purely conceptual nor purely meta phorical, neither scientific nor artistic" (Miller 47). Miller does not elaborate on the suggestion that Yeats's labyrinth can be likened to Nietzsche's "pyramidal order of concepts." However, it is evident even from Miller's description that the poem rises to meet the dilemma of metaphor as Nietzsche decries it, determining itself not as a battle between culture and chaos, but as a story in which culture suddenly and perpetually finds that it is comprised of chaos, the element it intends to leash. Miller argues, "For Nietzsche as for W.B. Yeats, man is Tost amid the labyrinth that he has made / In art or politics,' but it seems as if that labyrinth, constructed by man's extraordinary genius in architecture, is safe habitation able to 'bar that foul storm out.'This is true even though man's house of words has been made of the false equivalences of metaphor . . ." (Miller 36). In other words, Miller suggests, perhaps this is not true, for it only "seems" that the labyrinth is safe habitation from the storm. Meanwhile, within the labyrinth's architecture itself stands its very own disbanding negation, where "every concept arises from the equation of unequal things" (Miller 36). Man has chosen to bar the "foul storm" of chaotic nature out by constructing a labyrinth, a suitable emblem for the oxymoronic relationship between culture and nature. Culture only perpetuates the self-negating chaos of nature, and nature necessitates the self-negating rationality of culture. By identifying the dilemma of chaos within culture ? situating itself in ironic reflection of the thinker's situation by creating metaphors that give representation to the problematic of inversion whereby the subject finds himself already usurped by, already within the object?"Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen" resists such a total comparison to the voice of Nietzsche's essay. Unlike Nietzsche, who attempts</page><page sequence="10">Competing with "the barbarous clangour of a gong" 31 to clarify the work of metaphor by using a metaphor of a coin's value?which, as Miller shows us, sets up a false ratio of truth?Yeats is aware of being "too tangled in the situation he is attempting to clarify" (Miller 47). The new that "whirls out," is confined after all to "[Whirling] in the old instead." The goal for Nietzsche is to act outside of the false equivalences of metaphor to adequately describe the illusion of truth that takes place there. Contrary to falling into his own trap, Yeats is interested in the nature of the trap. He sees subject and object becoming entan gled, the situation of perpetually failing to bar the "foul storm" of chaos from the strictures of culture. In overlooking this distinction between Nietzsche's and Yeats's positions, Miller leaves unanswered the question of how the "false equivalences of metaphor," or "the equation of unequal things"?Nietzsche's stated concern?can amount to a storm within Yeats's labyrinth. A more extensive look at the third poem of "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen" provides a suggestion for this situation which points again to Borges's character, Funes. The first stanza of the poem (which immediately follows from the lines of the epigraph to "Theme of the Traitor and the Hero") presents us with "some moralist or mythological poet" (59) who "Compares the solitary soul to a swan" (60). The poet claims he is satisfied by the metaphor. Meanwhile, his description of the comparison shows, if anything, how the meta phor falls short due to the imprecision of language and the decay of time. He says, I am satisfied if a troubled mirror show it, Before that brief gleam of its life be gone, An image of its state ... or ride Those winds that clamour of approaching night. (61-63, 66-67) The images of false equivalences endure temporal winds split by memory (the enduring image in a troubled mirror) and the forgetting that encroaches upon the soul's vanishing ("the brief gleam of its life be gone"). This description of language's fraught state announces the labyrinth, as if first laying out its architecture, wherein man is saturated by the ineradicable memory of his work. The second stanza of the third poem tells us A man in his own secret meditation is lost amid the labyrinth that he has made In art or politics; Some Platonist affirms that in the station Where we should cast off body and trade The ancient habit sticks, And that if our works could But vanish with our breath That were a lucky death, For triumph can but mar our solitude. (69-78) What accrues for man "in his own secret meditation" (69) at the moment when he is to cast off "body and trade," (73) is the memory of his works. The image of</page><page sequence="11">32 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 32, Number 3 the ancient habit and a marred solitude resonates with the descriptions we have of Ireneo Funes, especially his flawless memory and perception. The narrator of Borges's story describes him thus: "[Funes] was able to reconstruct every dream, every daydream he had ever had. Two or three times he reconstructed an entire day; he had never once erred or faltered, but each reconstruction had taken an entire day. "/, myself, alone, have more memories than all mankind since the world began? he said to me." (Borges 135). Here, Funes's solitude is weighted with "the memories of all mankind."This is similar to Yeats's "great Memory," a notion he adapts from Shel ley in his 1900 essay, "The Philosophy of Shelley's Poetry." This view of memory counters the experience of the individual with the inheritance of all humanity. The lines from the third poem of Yeats's "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen" are perhaps most resonant with his poem "The Tower." "The Tower" deals more precisely with the burden of memory and the desire for imagination, which also emerges in "Funes, the Memorious.'Tn an interview with Osvaldo Ferrari, Borges elaborates on his interest in the "personal themes" evident in Yeats's figure of the tower as it brings about a confrontation of the aged poet with his youth. Borges describes the key moment of the poem to his interlocutor, "[Borges] ? ... siendo viejo, [Yeats] siente la nostalgia de esa juventud turbulenta . . . [Ferrari] ? Que no tuvo. [Borges] ? No, que no tuvo, pero el la siente." [". . . being old, he feels nostalgia for this turbulent youth . . ." ? "That he didn't have" ? "No, that he didn't have, but he feels it."] (Borges and Ferrari, Reencuentro 194) As much as Borges's appreciation of Yeats has been critically overlooked, his particular interest in Yeats's concept of the "great Memory" is especially thought provoking. On a number of occasions, Borges explains to Ferrari the unforgettable quality of Yeats's poetry. He explains,". . . hay tantos versos de Yeats, que estdn en mi memoria' ["There are so many verses of Yeats that are in my memory] (Borges and Ferrari, Reencuentro 194). In a second dialogue on Yeats, Borges describes a line to which he often returns in memory; Es extraordinario; yo siempre recuerdo aquel verso intraducible, insensato, pero que sin embargo ejerce su magia: "That dolphin's thorned, that gong tormented sea"; que raw: el mar desgarrado por los delfines y atormentado por los gongs. No se si puede defenderse logicamente, pero evidentemente es un conjunto mdgico. [It's extraordinary; I always remember this untranslatable verse, senseless, but that doubtless explains its magic: "That dolphin thorned, that gong tormented sea"; how strange: the sea torn by dolphins and tormented by gongs. I don't know if you can defend it logically, but evidently, it's a magical union.] (Borges and Ferrari, En didlogo II, 264)2 For Borges, Yeats is perhaps emblematic of memory itself. There are few authors Borges so often notes as wielding such power over his memory, for all its</page><page sequence="12">Competing with "the barbarous clangour of a gong" 33 capaciousness. The memorable nature of Yeats's poetry prompts Borges to explain that Yeats's belief in a human memory (with which all of us are endowed at birth) becomes the excuse to avoid "real" experiences for the man of wisdom. At one point Borges proclaims to Ferrari, Si, lo que hacen los poetas . . . Yeats creo una memoria, digamos, de amantes ignorantes de todo; salvo de su amor y de sus experencias inmediatas. Ydijd: la sabiduria es la decrepitud corporeal la decrepitudfisica; cuando eramosjovenes, nos amdbamos y eramos igorantes. [It's what poets do... .Yeats created a memory of lovers ignorant of everything, except for their love and their immediate experiences. And he said: wisdom is the body's decrepitude, physical decrepitude: when we were young, we loved, we were ignorant.] (Borges and Ferrari, Reencuentro, 195) Regarding Yeats's incredible ability to create his own history, Borges says, ". . .ya en anos de madurezy de vejez, a el le gustaba pensar en su memoria personal, que era un pasadoficticio, que es lo que todos hacemos con elpasado; lo que imaginamos no corresponde exactamente a lo que vivimos" [". . . already in years of maturity and age, [Yeats] enjoyed thinking about his personal memory that was a fictitious past, that is what everyone does with their past; what we imagine never corresponds exactly to what we lived"] (Borges and Ferrari, Reencuentro 195). Borges's description?which explains the conception of the great Memory ("la gran memoria") as supplement ing Yeats's personal memory with a "fictitious past"?resembles the pyramid-like structure of concepts in Nietzsche's essay that Miller compares to the labyrinth of "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen." Borges explains: ... Yeats invento que las experiences inmediatas, las experienciaspersonales, son innecesarias, ya que todo individuo hereda "La gran memoria", ye esa memoria seria la memoria de la especie; o mas concretamente, la memoria que se heredaria de todo lo que han vivido los padres, los abuelos, los tatrabuelos;y asi, en progresion geometrica, casi infinitamente. [. . . Yeats found that immediate experiences, personal experiences, are unnecessary, since every individual inherits "the great memory," and that memory would be the memory of the species; or, more concretely, the memory that would inherit everything lived by parents, grandparents and great-grandparents; and so, almost infinitely in geometric progression.] (Borges and Ferrari, Reencuentro 195) The accumulation of wisdom, which "all poets" bear in their old age, is the consequence of both imaginative, inventive departures from experience (the anxi ety of Nietzsche's "Truth and Lying" essay), and overwhelming memory that so saturates the body it can no longer move (the opposite extreme Nietzsche's essay implicitly proposes). The figure of Funes corresponds to both images. He is a figure with which Borges bore great personal sympathy. Borges recounted to Ferrari that Funes was an image of his own insomnia, his packed and flourishing memory. In 1981-1983 interviews with Roberto Alifano, Borges claims with regard to "Funes, el memorioso,""All I did was to write down Tunes'instead of'Borges,'"and earlier,</page><page sequence="13">34 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 32, Number 3 "I remember that I used to lie down and try to forget everything, and that led me, inevitably, to recall everything" (Borges and Alifano, 28-29). At the same time, he represents the other extreme: purely remembered, unimagined experience, which also paralyzes thought. Between the third poem of "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen" and the great Memory that reappears in "The Tower" emerges a poetic consciousness of pre cisely the ironic loss Borges describes when he speaks of Yeats and his work. In these instances, the poet realizes that he himself is part of the great Memory (that replacement for personal experience), that there is "no solitude to be had" (III).The freedom the great Memory grants to its dwellers?perhaps another image of the safety of a labyrinth that "bars that foul storm out"?returns as paralysis when it is realized that "our works" do not "but vanish with our breath" (III). The unsatis fying nostalgia for what was never lived but through imagination even paralyzes memory in "The Tower," Does the imagination dwell the most Upon a woman won or a woman lost? If on the lost, admit you turned aside From a great labyrinth out of pride, Cowardice, some silly over-subtle thought Or anything called conscience once; And that if memory recur, the sun's Under eclipse and the day blotted out. (113-120) "If on the lost, admit you turned aside / From a great labyrinth out of pride" (115? 116) recalls the memorable lines from "Who Goes with Fergus?", "And no more turn aside and brood / Upon love's bitter mystery" (7). The turning aside of "The Tower" reverses course from "Who Goes with Fergus?" as the subject of the lines is not what is turned to but what is tumedfrom, the "labyrinth" of real experiences that were eclipsed and avoided by thought. The opposite extreme of the poet in "The Tower" is Funes, who does not need to produce images in a troubled mirror. As a "man of genius," he has no need for metaphor or for other devices of imagination because, mechanically, he remembers everything exactly as it is. Time seems not to threaten the memory of objects in Funes's world, but renders their presence more exactly. But there is someone making the "false equivalences" of metaphor in "Funes, the memori ous": the narrator. This narrator provides a disclaimer before telling us about his interview with Funes: "I will not attempt to reproduce the words of it, which are now forever irrecoverable. Instead, I will summarize, faithfully, the many things Ireneo told me. Indirect discourse is distant and weak; I know that I am sacrific ing the effectiveness of my tale" (Borges 134). In beginning this story, the narrator continually and self-consciously discredits the accuracy of his memory, "I recall (I think) ..." (Borges 131), "I am so absentminded that I would never have given a second thought to the exchange [between my cousin and Ireneo Funes]" (Borges 132). The forgetful narrator, riding back from the ranch in San Francisco with his</page><page sequence="14">Competing with "the barbarous clangour of a gong" 35 cousin on horseback, first encounters Ireneo Funes from this perspective. Three years later, when he returns to Fray Bentos (the location of his first encounter with "chronometric Funes") he inquires about Funes. The narrator is told "... he'd been bucked off a half-broken horse on the ranch in San Francisco and had been left hopelessly crippled" (Borges 132). The narrator makes sense of Funes's condition for us through the "magic" of metaphor. This magic recalls what makes the senseless "dolphin torn, gong tor mented sea" effective for Borges. The narrator goes on to describe what he felt when he heard this news. "I recall the sensation of unsettling magic that this news gave me: The only time I'd seen him, we'd been coming home on horseback from the ranch in San Francisco, and he had been walking along a high place. This new event, told by my cousin Bernardo, struck me as very much like a dream confected out of elements of the past" (Borges 132). The narrator connects his two encounters with Funes conceptually with the half-truths of two moments in time; the horse gains significance as a unifying symbol. Funes's physical paralysis extends this "magic" of "false equivalence." It acts as a poignant metaphor for the condition to which his flawless memory renders him: a condition in which, as the narrator suspects,". . . he was not very good at thinking. To think is to ignore (or forget) differences, to generalize, to abstract" (Borges 137). Even his death from "pulmonary congestion," cannot shirk the irony of metaphor, the sophisticated abstraction of which Funes is himself supposedly incapable. Just as Ryan finds himself a character written into the history he narrates in "Theme of the Traitor and the Hero," Funes is caught within the metaphoric half-truths his perfect perception of the world would have him avoid. It is through the narrator's metaphors that we glean a notion of Funes, and Funes's physical impairment is a senseless yet unavoidable "false" equivalent to his inundated memory. Indeed, Funes s world ? a rush of images of objects at different times and places ? is its own "troubled mirror." It is a labyrinth constructed of images in the mind of a metaphoric man (the narrator)?images that are also "truths. "The num bering system Funes invents points to the chaotic nature of truth when thought of as a complete and unmoving Platonic system, ". . . in 1886 he had invented a numbering system original with himself... he would say, for instance, 'Maximo Perez'; instead of seven thousand fourteen (7014), 'the railroad'; other numbers were 'Luis Melian Lafinur/'Olimar,"sulfur,"clubs,"the whale,"gas,"a stewpot'.. ." (Borges 136). When the narrator tries to explain to Funes that his principle was "exactly the opposite of a number system' (Borges 136), Funes refuses to under stand. What is compelling in imagining Funes's response to the numeric is that as an emblem for perfect memory?a mind beyond the necessities of Nietzsche's bemoaned half-truths ? he ends up amidst the chaos that persists at the moment metaphors and concepts are coined. It is equally interesting that his system suggests the impossibility of diachronic time. By conflating numbers with discrete images and names, which are free to "fol low" or "lead" to an infinity of others, Funes challenges the linearity of history that has always implied the truth of a single narrative. As a subject that finds himself</page><page sequence="15">36 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 32, Number 3 already inscribed within the object of his inquiry, Funes already holds much in com mon with the poet of Yeats's "The Tower." It is perhaps in his numeric "principle" that we find the most compelling reflection of that negotiation between historicity and the split subject that occurs in "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen." If Funes is emblematic of the artist's anxieties, the labyrinth of the third poem in "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen" begins to make sense in the context of this story. It depicts an unsheddable "ancient habit" for the "metaphysical poet," lost within the architecture of his own thought. Like the challenge to diachronic time that Funes's disorderly assignment of things to the numeric system becomes, Yeats's "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen" resists chronology as its wordy rather than numeric title suggests. As Foshay points out, the coexistence of the six discrete poems that comprise "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen" implies a similar resis tance. Borges's story appropriately depicts the "foul storm," which the poet's reason ing exists to block out, as ironically part of Funes's perfect memory. This chaos is within the labyrinth, that inversion to which the grammar of Yeats's poem points, and that suggests itself as an impetus for Borges choosing lines from "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen" as the epigraph to "Theme of the Traitor and the Hero." To return to Funes's "principle" and the threat it poses to historicity, Roxana Kreimer notes that Funes fulfills the model Nietzsche proposes in his essay "On the Utility of History. ""A man that would feel in a purely historical manner, would be like someone who could not sleep" (Kreimer 190). Kreimer goes on to reckon Funes as part of a bleak picture of the post-industrial world: ". . . In light of industrial progress we sacrifice social progress, Benjamin points out; in the July revolution we shot symbolically at watches to retard the homogenous time of oppression and accumulation. The memory of'chronometric'Funes expresses the inexorable march of linear time embodied by technologies everywhere" (Kreimer 195). Contrary to Kreimer s claim, even the "chronometric" nature of Funes cannot seem to quash subjective agency. His numeric principle upsets historical time and his memories, rather than being confined to a rigidly linear conception of time. In an "interview" with the narrator, Funes tells him, "My memory, sir, is like a garbage heap ..." (Borges 135, emphasis original). Funes demonstrates similarities to the poet and the labyrinth of Yeats's "The Tower." His memory evinces the chaos that persists within the bounds of culture, and he is exposed to the vast rush of mankind's memories while remaining con fined to the solitude of his paralysis. The irony of finding within a "chronometric" character the ahistorical is thus unsurprising. Perhaps a more apt comparison would Funes's garbage heap of memories to Benjamin's angel of history: His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing in from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such a violence that the angel can no longer close them. (Benjamin 157)</page><page sequence="16">Competing with "the barbarous clangour of a gong" 37 In Benjamin's conception, the storm of progress?industrial progress to which Kreimer likens Funes by virtue of his "chronometric" character?advances the angel. Like Funes, the angel doesn't see events in chronological order, but as a single wreckage. In this sense, Funes embodies more than one paradox. He is the abstract problem of the conflation between subject and object of Yeats's poetics (the prob lem Miller identifies as at the heart of Nietzsche's "Truth and Lying" essay). At the same time, he is the paradoxical realization that the angel of history is comprised of the systematizing storm of progress ? a system comprised of the garbage heap. Notes 1. T. Whiston's "An 'Irish' story of Jorge Luis Borges: 'Tema del traidor y del heroe" makes no men tion of the epigram or of Yeats, it is rather interested in Borges's rejection of realism in his account of a nineteenth century Irish Rebellion. More recently, in his essay "Modalities, Logic, and the Cabala in Borges's 'The Theme of the Traitor and the Hero," Kane X. Faucher treats an impressive range of "modalities" in which Borges's story may be understood while relegating the significance of the epigram to a paragraph that explores what Faucher takes the couple of lines to be in direct reference to; "Plato's theory of the Forms," and the tower which Faucher takes as Babel. The only commonality between the quotation and the story that Faucher's close-reading (of the quotation, not the poem, "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen" from which it originates) yields is that Yeats's words ". . . [reify] the notion of repetition, as a drawing from the Forms of history" (110). 2. Yeats's line speaks of a dolphin-torn rather than "thorned" sea. I'm not sure whether this is Borges's mistake or an error in Ferrari's transcription. Works Cited Benjamin, Walter. "Theses on the Philosophy of YWstory."Illuminations. Trans. Harry Zohn.
