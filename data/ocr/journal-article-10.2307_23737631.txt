<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PAST IN CHINA'S PRESENT A Cultural, Social, and Philosophical Background for Contemporary China Joseph Needham (The following is the second half of a two-part article on the background of modern China. In this paper, Professor Need ham discusses the philosophical aspects of China's history; in the preceding article, he presented some features of the social and cultural development of China.—Editor) I. Confucian Morality and Taoist Social Protest Let us now turn to the consideration of certain matters more on the philosophical and ethical plane. Of course, we have already touched upon some aspects of ethics, but we need to put this in its correct perspective by recognizing the exist ence of an essential wallpaper of the Chinese mind today and for the foreseeable future—the background of Confucianism and Taoism. I say this with the parallel in mind that how ever revolutionary any European, for example, may be, he will have as the inevitable background to his mind the social righteousness of Israel, the subtleties of Greek philosophy, and the logic of Roman law, three elements all embodied in the Christian Church and the Holy Roman Empire. These fundamental conditioners of thought cannot be deleted from the European past. We have already said a word or two about the moral aus terity of ancient or classical Confucianism, which was essen tially a system of ethics and not in any way a metaphysic.1 i For a more detailed account, see Science and Civilisation in China, Vol. s (in course of publication in seven volumes by the Cambridge University Press), pp. 3 ff. Hereinafter abbreviated as SCC. 28i</page><page sequence="2">282 THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW The Confucian ideal was a state of social justice insofar as this could be conceived of within the framework of the feudalism of Master Khung's own time (the —6th century). Its conservatism arose from the fact that the relation of prince and minister or master and servant was included among those five human relationships which Confucius invested with par ticular sanctity. But the idea that every person exists in a kind of concrete special functional relationship with every other person in society is one which is capable of perpetual renovation; loyalty to superior officers is needed in a Red as well as in any other Army, and filial piety must necessarily appear in new forms when family allowances or full old-age pensions and suitable new State-provided modes of life for the aged come into general acceptance. Confucianism was a religion, too, if you define that as something which involves the sense of the holy, for a quality of the numinous is very present in Confucian temples (the Wen Miao); but not if you think of religion only as the the ology of a transcendent creator-deity. The emphasis of Con fucianism, of course, was always on duties rather than rights, and this again is familiar in modern as well as in traditional Chinese society. There has been little change in that respect. In the past Confucianism tended a good deal towards asceti cism and even a certain prudery, and these ancient presences can be felt very much among the communists of today and in their social attitudes. But the Taoists are immortal as well. The ancient Taoist philosophers were men who made a powerful social protest against the feudal society of their time.2 They refused to co operate with it. The famous expression chün hu! mu hu! of Chuang Chou, for instance, in the —4th century, when he says, "Princes, indeed! Grooms to be sure!", in other words, those who know only the distinctions between princes and 2 For a more detailed account, see SCC, Vol. 2, pp. 33 ft, and especially pp. 86 If., 100 If.</page><page sequence="3">THE PAST IN CHINA'S PRESENT 283 grooms, how you should salute one and how you should salute the other, we spew them out of our mouths. This is not true knowledge. We believe in obtaining a real knowledge of Nature and a real understanding of the ceaselessly changing universe. We retire from human society, we walk outside hu man society, we resort to the mountains and forests, we con template Nature, we cultivate our receptivity, and we teach abstention from all force and coercion. "Production without possession, action without self-assertion, development with out domination."3 And there they were in their hermitages and abbeys all through history, refusing to cooperate in the bureaucratic-feudal society. That element of Taoist renunciation, and that element of Confucian ascesis, neither of them springing from any super naturalism but in the interests of high morality, are very powerful indeed at the present time. The vein of puritanism, in fact, in modern China is not at all new. It is something which has been there all through the ages. It has reminded some observers of the Ironside spirit in -f- lyth-century revo lutionary England, with the age-old humanistic moral con viction of Master Khung taking the place of that of the proph ets of Israel's god of righteousness. The reforming of the old decayed society and the assertion of moral values, if no doubt occasionally carried to rather absurd lengths, is thus not a new development, but a restoration of something exceed ingly old. In fact, I should go so far as to say that although neither Confucianism nor Taoism, in spite of some appear ances, ever involved the conception of a creator or an omnipo tent transcendent deity in the usual sense, they were wholly devoted, each in their diametrically opposite way, to bring ing about what in early Christian terms would be called the "Kingdom of God on Earth." It has been instructive in recent years to see the reassess 3 These words, brilliantly summarizing much of the essense of the Tao Té Ching, were quoted by Bertrand Russell in The Problem of China (London, 1922), p. 194, but I do not know from where he derived them.</page><page sequence="4">284 THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW ment of the ancient philosophers going on. When I was in China in 1952, it was interesting to see that only three indi vidual characters were emphasized in the magnificent teach ing exhibition of archaeology and history from the Bronze Age onwards which is established in the Imperial Palace Mu seum, the Ku Kung Po Wu Kuan at Peking. They were Mo Ti, the —4th century philosopher of universal love, and Hsimén Pao, the great hydraulic engineer and humanitarian of the —6th century. This latter official is remembered not only for having built some of the earliest dams and reservoirs, but also, according to a story which is not at all unhistorical, for having ended the sacrifice of girls to the god of the Yellow River. So he was a humanitarian and a hydraulic engineer at the same time. The third hero emphasized was Kungshu Phan, or Lu Pan, the great artisan and patron saint of arti sans. But when I went back six years later, I found that while the three heroes were still there, Confucius, Mencius, and even Hsiin Chhing, as well as most of the other classical philosophers, had been added, emphasis being laid on Con fucius chiefly as an educator. All of them are now well rep resented and described with suitable exhibits. A great debate is always going on, of course, as to how far Confucius himself was a revolutionary. There is no doubt that he was in the field of education, for he did away with the ancient idea that noble birth was an indispensable re quirement. He was prepared to educate anyone who was capable of receiving it. This was how he became the patron saint of the bureaucracy, for all the posts needed officials and the Confucian education was the most suitable for them. But the question is more complex than this, for it turns on the extent to which Confucius was consciously opposed to the whole system of bronze-age proto-feudalism, and in favor of more collectivist forms. There is, at any rate, no doubt that some of his recorded actions indicate this, and that some of his descendants played a part in those popular re</page><page sequence="5">THE PAST IN CHINA'S PRESENT 285 bellions of which we have already spoken. A strong case for the politically democratic character of Confucius has been made out by the sinologist H. G. Creel in a fascinating, if somewhat controversial, study.4 Actually, Kuo Mo-Jo himself, the great archaeologist and ancient historian who is now presi dent of the Chinese National Academy of Sciences, has gone on record quite a number of times for what one might call the progressive view of Confucius as opposed to the other view, held, of course, by many Chinese Marxists, that he was nothing but a reactionary of deepest dye. It was natural that they should think so, for in modern times and under the Kuomintang, many landowners and traditionalists of all sorts upheld Confucianism as one of the conservative institutions they wished to defend. The reader may complain if no word is said about Bud dhism. In my opinion (and again this is a personal one), it never played anything like the same part in China as the two indigenous doctrines. It is very curious that although philosophically "other-worldly," for economic reasons it came to be allied with peasant struggles, and in some periods at least as much so as the Taoists. But presumably because of its emphasis on compassion, the karuna aspect of Bud dhism, alongside that of emptiness (sunya), it was very im portant and early in the field with regard to the establish ment of hospitals, orphanages, and similar institutions. It has certainly not been without influence on modern reformers and revolutionaries. II. Neo-Confucianism and Dialectical Organicism When we pass from the ethical to the metaphysical, a num ber of points arise which are of as great if not greater im portance than anything yet said. The school to which I particularly want to draw attention is the Hsing Li Hsüeh Chia, creators of the great scholastic synthesis of the -f-iith * Confucius, the Man and the Myth, (New York, 1949; London, 1951).</page><page sequence="6">286 THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW and -j-i2th centuries.5 The greatest representative of the Neo-Confucian school was Chu Hsi, who was born in -(-1131 and lived throughout the rest of the century. The earliest was Chou Tun-I, born in 4-1017, and three other great names come in between. It is highly characteristic of their philo sophical position that Chu Hsi has been termed both the Herbert Spencer and the Thomas Aquinas of China. What may have been an important factor in the rallying of the Chinese intellectuals to the communist point of view is the fact that Neo-Confucianism was closely related to dia lectical materialism. In other words, this system of thought, which was really the culmination of Chinese philosophical speculation throughout the ages, was a materialism, but it was not a mechanical materialism. It was, in fact, an organic conception of Nature, a theory of integrative levels, an organic naturalism,6 having nothing to do with an external transcendent creator-deity or supernatural being of any sort, but at the same time leaving all possible room for man's highest experiences, highest indeed of the successive levels of organization and integration in the world of Nature. It was thus essentially not dualistic. It was, if you like, holist. It was therefore closely allied to the conceptions of dialectical materialism, which is also a materialism but not a mechanical one, and pictures a dialectic in Nature such that contradic tions are constructively resolved at a series of integrative 5 A detailed account is given in SCC, Vol. 2, pp. 455 ff. Such recent publica tions as Chou I-Chhing's La Philosophie Morale dans le Néo-Confucianisme (Paris, 1954), and A. C. Graham's Two Chinese Philosophers (London, 1958) are well worth study. * Exactly what I mean here has been set forth, with documentation, in earlier publications; see especially my Herbert Spencer Lecture at Oxford University, Integrative Levels, a Revaluation of the Idea of Progress (1937), especially page 40; reprinted in Time, the Refreshing River (London, 1943), in which see especially pp. 184 ff., 233 ff. The relevance of organic naturalism (as in Whitehead, Sellars, Smuts, Lloyd-Morgan, etc.) to dialectical material ism, indeed a close logical relationship, may be found further in J. Lindsay, Marxism and Contemporary Science (London, 1949), especially pp. 70 if. The most recent world picture in this tradition, drawn, however, neither by a professional philosopher nor by a marxist theoretician, but by a brilliant and unorthodox Jesuit, is The Phenomenon of Man by J. Teilhard de Chardin. Fr. Teilhard de Chardin spent many years of his life in China.</page><page sequence="7">THE PAST IN CHINA'S PRESENT 287 levels (plant, animal, social, etc.); the series of the scala naturae, in fact, with all the transitions between its stages. The Neo-Confucian school operated with two fundamental conceptions, chhi and li. Chhi originally meant something rather like the Greek pneuma, a vapor, something like a gas or an emanation, but by the Sung it had come to mean all matter, the grossest as well as the most tenuous. As someone recently pointed out very acutely, it is rather remarkable that pneuma became more and more rarefied in Europe as the centuries wore on, while chhi, on the other hand, became more and more material. This must be connected with the characteristic Chinese love of pragmatic concreteness. As for li, the word began by meaning a way of cutting jade accord ing to its natural pattern, and eventually came to mean es sentially all structure in Nature itself—"natural organic pat tern." These words are absolutely not translatable by Aristo telian matter and form; they have at first sight some similarity with those concepts, but at bottom they are not at all similar. Then there are many other important technical terms, like chhéng, for example, which some people translate as "sin cerity." I have a fixed conviction that it ought rather to be rendered the "precise fulfillment of an organic function," with all that that implies. Among the most profound of Neo-Confucian ideas is that embodied in the famous phrase wu chi erh thai chi, "that which has no Pole and yet itself is the supreme Pole," namely, the conception of the whole universe as an organic unity, in fact, as a single organism.7 7 Certain Neo-Confucian terms and conceptions might still be useful today. As J. Lindsay has pointed out (loc. cit., p. 91), we find it hard to speak of the forms of "organized-ness," the x-factor at all the successive levels, which makes the difference between random collocations and wholes or entities, at each new level "making all things new." "Vitalist theories like Lloyd Morgan's," he says, "or organicist theories like Whitehead's try to fill the gap with spirit, elan, nisus, God, or a metaphysical principle of creative purpose. Almost the whole of language is soaked with anthropocentric attitudes. We simply do not possess a word which can simultaneously express the activity of the atom and the activity of the human being. We can express mechanical relations and we can express personal relations; but we lack the integrative vocabulary." Here li is exactly what is wanted—the pattern-principle oper</page><page sequence="8">288 THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW III. European Schizophrenia and Chinese Unitariness In all this one might think that we were getting far away from contemporary China. Not at all. The enthusiastic ac ceptance of dialectical materialism in China is regarded by many Westerners as a great mystery. They marvel that such a people could have accepted what at first sight might seem so European with alacrity and conviction. Yet I can almost imagine Chinese scholars saying to themselves, "How aston ishing; this is very like our own philosophia perennis inte grated with modern science and at last come home to us." It is important to notice how deeply opposed is this non dualistic, organic conception of the universe to what I intend in due course to call, adopting a phrase from Lancelot L. Whyte,8 the "European dissociation." By this I mean that confused dance in which Europeans have engaged from the earliest times, oscillating between theological spiritualism on the one hand and mechanical materialism on the other. What difficulty the Western world had in attaining equili brium! On one side there was the tradition of atomism start ing with Democritus, Epicurus, and Lucretius, and contin ued by atheist science all down the ages. On the other there was the tradition, emanating perhaps from Israel rather than from Greece, which laid emphasis on the spiritual reality of the Creator and the angelic host, upheld by priests and prophets. This dualism mirrored itself in a thousand con flicts—necessity versus freedom, matter versus spirit, sensu ality versus asceticism, reason versus instinct, the real in contrast with the ideal—local engagements in a seemingly universal campaign. Strung in this field of force were Augus tine and Albertus, Bacon and Milton, Darwin and Freud. (These pairs of great men are mentioned not as antitheses but ating in diverse ways at all levels, but a term without any theological or metaphysical undertones, and not at all anthropomorphic. If clues such as this are followed up, Neo-Thomism may run into serious competition. 8 In The Next Development in Man (London, 1944), especially pp. 59, 61, 85, etc.</page><page sequence="9">THE PAST IN CHINA'S PRESENT 2 89 as illustrative examples. All the outstanding thinkers of Eu rope have been torn between the two poles, and sometimes famous men have incarnated the one and the other in head on collision—as in the case of Huxley and Wilberforce.) The crowning symbol of this divided mind was the Holy Roman Empire itself, with the Pope and the Emperor as the dual but inwardly irreconcilable apex, two persons on one throne, failing, alas, on earth to attain the perfect union of the three persons in heaven. Many a time have I stood with Chinese friends in our Western cathedrals—at Augsburg or Korcula, Chartres or Lincoln, delighting, like Henry Adams, to explain to them how the essential duality of the European soul found expression in the visible sharing of earthly power between lords spiritual and lords temporal. It is true, of course, that most of the theologians upheld an ultimate primacy of the Church, but century after century the King's lawyers stubbornly contested it. Nothing of this kind existed in Chinese culture, for the emperor on earth was both priest and king. The Son of Heaven represented below the Pole Star in the heavens above, around which every star revolved. A famous passage in Julius Caesar describes this state of things: But I am constant as the northern star, Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament. The skies are painted with un-number'd sparks, They are all fire and every one doth shine, But there's but one in all doth hold his place; So in the world—'tis furnish'd well with men .... Yet in the number I do know but one That unassailable, holds on his rank, Unshaked of motion, and that I am he.... Such words could have been spoken by any Chinese emperor, the unitary head of church and state. It may, of course, be arguable that this "schizophrenia" in Europe all through the centuries gave rise to a certain creative tension which was</page><page sequence="10">290 THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW not present in Chinese society. It may well be that this peren nial uneasiness was one of the great spiritual or intellectual factors which led to the rise of modern natural philosophy when the social situation became ripe for it; that remains to be investigated. What is sure, at any rate, is that Chinese culture attained sagely synthesis while adolescent Europe struggled on in the grip of ambivalence and contradiction.9 Not until the time of Leibniz did the European spirit begin to be able to transcend the irreconcilable opposites of its youth—God and the angels versus atoms and the void— creation against evolution—cassock and alb at odds with the divine nudity of Aphrodite. This argument does not imply that there were no basic psychological conflicts in Chinese civilization, for some of these are doubtless implicit in the human condition itself; but rather that conflicts within Western man were unduly heightened and intensified by a fundamentally unreconciled dualism, an unsolved contra diction, lying at the root of European culture itself. This is why it has so much yet to learn from China—and from India. In any case, it is easy to see that the profound unitariness of Chinese culture not only favored the acceptance of dia lectical materialism as its own philosophia perennis in fully developed form, but was also very congruent with the con ception of a one-party state. Traditional China had never s What Alan Watts has written on this is deeply true—The Way of Zen (London, 1957), p. 175: "Taoism, Confucianism and Zen Buddhism are ex pressions of a mentality which feels itself completely at home in this universe, and which sees man as an integral part of his environment. Human intelli gence is not an imprisoned spirit from afar, but an aspect of the whole intri cately balanced organism of the natural world, the principles of which were first explored in the Book of Changes. Heaven and earth are alike members of this organism, and Nature as much our father as our mother since the Tao by which it works is originally manifested in the Yang and the Yin—the male and female, positive and negative principles which in dynamic balance main tain the order of the world. The insight which lies at the root of the Far Eastern cultures is that opposites are relational, and so fundamentally har monious. Conflict is always comparatively superficial, for there can be no ultimate conflict when the pairs of objects are mutually interdependent. Thus our stark divisions of spirit and nature, subject and object, good and evil, artist and medium, are quite foreign to these cultures."</page><page sequence="11">THE PAST IN CHINA'S PRESENT 291 been anything else. Though Taoists occasionally found their way to power, the real ruler through the ages was, as it were, the Confucian Party. This point is extremely important as it mirrors on the sociological side this philosophical, unitary, organic naturalism. Moreover, Chinese intellectuals were all the more ready to accept dialectical materialism for it was something which in a way they themselves had generated. If one seeks for the origins of dialectical materialism in the West, one can get back to Hegel easily enough, but beyond Hegel there is only Leibniz and when one gets that far, it is not obvious where the further sources were. Of course, you can bring Plotinus into it (much to his surprise), but his philosophy, if organic, was hardly materialist, so it is well worth knowing that Leib niz himself was extremely interested in China. He wrote at least one book on that culture, the Novissima Sinica. He edited the Jesuit relations from China and was in extremely close touch with Jesuits living there, such as Joachim Bou vet; they supplied him with the Neo-Confucian commen taries on the classics as well as the classics themselves. Leibniz himself fortunately annotated copies of a number of books relating to Chinese thought, especially by dissentient Jesuits who did not agree with the usual Jesuit view about China, and from these notes we can see that if his own philosophical system was not primarily derived from Neo-Confucian or ganicism, he found in it much precious support and con firmation.10 IV. The Absence of Metaphysical Idealism and Theology There is an obverse, of course, to all this and that is the absence of certain trends in China. Most conspicuous by its absence was any strong tradition of metaphysical idealism. Nothing in China corresponds to Berkeley and Bradley and nothing really corresponds to Plato, for it is only a jeu lo SCC, Vol. 2, pp. 497 R-, 500 ff.</page><page sequence="12">292 THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW d'esprit, I think, to call Chuang Chou the Plato of China. In his literary manifestation this may pass, but the meta physical ideas are just not there. I shed no tears about that because I am not a metaphysical idealist. It is true that from the end of the Sung onwards there was a wing of the Neo Confucians which showed a strong tendency to metaphysical idealism, culminating in Wang Yang-Ming and the philoso phers of the Ming period,11 but even there it was, on the whole, I think, more mystical than metaphysical, since in general Chinese culture did not have that Greek inheritance of formal logic which led to metaphysical propositions in the strict sense. Here again the Buddhist thinkers must not be forgotten, for many of their schools worked out extreme idealistic positions,12 but whatever they did affected the general trend of Chinese thought, I submit, remarkably little. Buddhism in China was always really heterodox, powerful imperial support in certain dynasties notwithstanding, and all its con ceptions—the total vanity of the world, the imperfectibility of human society, the salvation of the self by worship and almsgiving, the superiority of the monastic life of moderated asceticism—were decisively rejected by the literati. For them the world was not an illusion, good government and a society of justice and righteousness were feasible, the family with its moderated relations between the sexes was the right and natural way of living, and salvation could look after itself. By the same token there never appeared in China a powerful theological philosophy. The conception of the Creator-God was absent. I once had occasion to go into this in great detail because I was anxious to plumb to the bottom the absence of the conception of Laws of Nature in Chinese thought, and in the end I satisfied myself that it never spontaneously ap Cf. F. G. Henke, The Philosophy of Wang Yang-Ming ^Chicago, 1916), "htlosophy. and, more recently, Féng Yu-Lan, A History of Chinese Philosophy, trans lated by D.

Leibniz's idea of a pre-established harmony was one of the most Chi nese formulations which ever found itself incorporated in the procession of European philosophical thought. V. No Persecution for Opinion's Sake But if "Laws of Nature" did not arise indigenously in the Chinese mind, perhaps some other consequences of the ab sence of a "jealous" unitary personal God were highly advan tageous. Take the question of persecution for opinion's sake. Let any unbiassed enquirer look for himself and report if he can find in Chinese history anything corresponding to the Holy Inquisition. There were, no doubt, political censor ships, such as the alarm and uneasiness at the Manchu Court, for instance, about writers who might be secretly supporting the Ming and working for a Ming restoration. In the -}-i8th century, as Goodrich has shown,14 there was a good deal of draconic investigation of books involving some shocking and unhappy individual cases. But of persecution for theological opinion as we know it in Europe, with the whole background 13 SCC, Vol. 2, pp. 518 ff.; also, in preliminary form, "Natural Law in China and Europe," Journal of the History of Ideas, 12 (1951). 3 and 194; and abridged, "Human Law and the Laws of Nature in China and the West" (Hobhouse Memorial Lecture, London, 1951). Interesting discussions continue still, however. Cf. D. Bodde in Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, 20 (1957), 7°9 11L. C. Goodrich, The Literary Inquisition of Chhien-Lung, (Baltimore, 1935). The political battles between powerful eunuchs and Confucian re formers could be extremely fierce, as may be seen, for instance, by reading C. O. Hucker's study of the Tung-Lin movement of the late Ming in J. K. Fairbank, ed., Chinese Thought and Institutions (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1957), p. 132. Moreover, intellectual originality could be dan gerous in the more conventional periods, as may be seen by the sad case of a scholar named Li Chih (+1527 to +1602) who was driven to suicide in prison for a Confucian-Buddhist syncretism which a thousand years earlier would have been in the height of fashion. On him one may read O. Franke in Abhandlungen d. preuss. Akad. Wiss. (Phil.-Hist. Kl.), 1938, No. 10. He was an enlightened freethinker, advocating many things which contemporary China unquestioningly accepts, such as the equality of the sexes and the free choice of partners in marriage, and has honor as a martyr of humanism. But such a case was exceptional.</page><page sequence="14">294 the centennial review of Crusades against Muslims, Jews, and Albigensians, the Inquisition, and the manifold cruelties perpetrated by both sides "for the good of their souls" in the wars of the Refor mation and the Counter-Reformation, one simply cannot find any comparisons in China at all. I am not saying that the Buddhists were not interfered with from time to time. They were persecuted to the extent that thousands of monks and nuns were obliged to return to civilian life and even to marry. They were also injured by the enforced nationali zation of some of the enormous Buddhist images, the bronze of which was melted down and made into coins. But the only religious persons ever burnt alive in China were some of the Buddhist monks of their own free will, for at times it was believed that suicide was the quickest and most efficacious way to attain Nirvana. The literati abhorred it. Another phenomenon in European history for which it is difficult to find any counterpart in China, however one gropes amidst the superstitions which flourished in medieval times there as well as in other cultures, is the witchcraft mania.15 For more than two centuries (the -{-15th to the -J- 18th) Europe suffered a reign of terror in which unnumbered thousands of persons, notably but by no means exclusively old women, were burnt at the stake or tortured or killed in many other ways after condemnation as witches and sor cerers. This may have been just another aspect of the prin ciple of religious persecution, but it had numerous features which have invited the attention of modern psycho-patholo gists, and it constitutes yet another cultural element which Western civilization face to face with modern Asia has some difficulty in explaining away. It seems to have been a disease associated with the great upheavals of the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the rise of capitalism, for the earlier Mid dle Ages had been almost as free from it as the 19th century. i» The best paper known to me on this subject is that of E. T. Withington, "Dr. John Weyer and the Witch Mania," in C. Singer, ed., Studies in the History and Method of Science (Oxford, 1917; reprinted, London, 1955).</page><page sequence="15">THE PAST IN CHINA'S PRESENT 295 By contrast, the advantage of having an entire magistracy vowed by long training to a humane scepticism in matters of religion and magic will here be very apparent. Precious philosophically the alogical and irrational element at the heart of Christianity may have been, but it bore inescapably the compensating curse that belief could take the place of reason even on the judge's bench. Moreover, the popularity of literary genres, which is not without relation to their social environment, may show us something. Just as people today delight in detective stories because they live in highly po liced and secure societies, tales of ghosts and "occult" phe nomena were very popular in medieval China—precisely be cause few of the scholars believed in them. Indeed, the idea of religious persecution as understood by both Catholics and Protestants in the West is, I think, truly absent from Chinese history.16 If it had been present, there could never have been that extraordinary syncretism when in certain periods some scholars went out of their way to dress up in Buddhist robes and a Confucian hat with a Taoist staff, and maintain that the San Chiao, the three religions, the three doctrines, were essentially parts of one and the same truth. Few in the West today are prepared to do that kind of thing even with the next chapel down the road. i« This was really demonstrated in a classical work by J. J. M. de Groot, "Sectarianism and Religious Persecution in China," Verhdl. d. Koninklijke Akad. Wet. Amsterdam (Aid. Letterk.), N.R. 4 (1903), Nos. 1 and 2, (con tinuous pagination), though his own bias was in the opposite direction. The conception of heresy (yin ssu, hsieh shuo) was not indeed totally absent from Chinese thinking, but it was inextricably bound up with the fear of political subversion and popular revolt against the ruling bureaucratic-feudal State. Thus the laws against sects were really directed against secret societies, and a "heretic" who abjured Confucianism or developed some aberrant form of Taoism or Buddhism was indistinguishable from a rebel. Abundance of in stances show that this "alarm and despondency" of the officials was perfectly justified; the burden of proof lay on the sect to show that it was non-political. Yet in many ages there could be glad acceptance of foreign religions and some were acclimatized successfully for centuries—Zoroastrianism, Nestorian Chris tianity, Manichaeism, Islam, and Israel, apart from the outstanding example of Buddhism itself. To sum up the matter, the point at issue tended always to be political rather than philosophical, and the odium theologicum of the West was by that token absent.</page><page sequence="16">296 THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW Here again we come to a very important outcome at the present time, namely the emphasis on persuasion. In the last ten years in China, I do not know how many man hours or man-woman hours or years have been spent attending meet ings. The extent to which the Chinese have gone in for meetings has probably never been surpassed in the history of the world since the Early Church. I think it has been done because of this deeply-rooted feeling that you cannot make people really enthusiastic about anything against their will. In fact, so far as I can see, life in the Soviet Union never embodied the profusion of rectification meetings common to every social unit in China; in every laboratory, in every rail way junction, in every workshop, these group meetings have been going on. What I have heard from a number of West ern friends who have participated in these meetings leaves no doubt that the result has been much greater cooperation and much greater mutual understanding than is probably ever achieved in the working-together groups of our own society.17 VI. December 25th or July 14th? Four times in history China was offered the possibility of adopting organized Christianity: once in the -{-8th century, when the Syrian Nestorians came; once in the -{-13th cen tury, when there was a Franciscan Archbishop of Cambaluc; once again in the -(-17th century, in the brilliant age of the Jesuit Mission; and lastly in the -{-19th, when the Thai-Phing rebels drew part of their inspiration from a form of Protest antism. But it always failed, and the fact must be faced by Westerners that the Christian religion in its organized forms has been decisively rejected by Chinese culture.

What the Jesuits offered of modern science was enthusiastically received, and though for them the scientific contacts were only a means to an end, they succeeded fully in acclimatizing Galileo and Harvey while utterly fail ing in their principal aim, the transplantation of Augustine and Aquinas. The Chinese, with their usual acumen, saw through the Jesuit pretensions completely and realized that the modern science of the Renaissance was not something essentially Western, but something essentially new.19 They also realized that it had nothing intrinsically to do with Christianity.20 The religion and theology of Europe could not be regarded as "superior" doctrines; they had developed, no doubt, in the same civilization as modern science, but this was a relation of accidental historical contiguity and not one of necessary cause and effect. Moreover, as time went on, the behavior of the Western powers, with all its elements of im perialistic bullying and racial pride, made the preaching of missionaries seem more and more systematically hypocritical. The last straw in this process has been added in our own time by the self-caricature of its mores and modes of life which the West has offered to Asia, that mixture of sex and sadism characteristic of its cheap films and books. is This point is elaborated in detail in SCC, Vol. 3, pp. 448 fi. See also J. Needham, Chinese Astronomy and the Jesuit Mission; an Encounter of Cultures (London: China Society, 1958). 20 The implicit logic of the Jesuit approach was that modern science was better than medieval science, and that only Christendom could have produced it; the Chinese should therefore become part of Christendom. The non sequi tur was that a unique historical circumstance (the rise of modern science in a civilization with a particular religion) cannot prove a necessary concomi tan ce. Religion was not the only factor in which Europe differed from Asia. In the actual historical and ideological genesis of science and modern science. Israel and Christianity, and for that matter Hellenism, too, were no doubt very much concerned, but historical genesis is not the same thing as intrinsic inseparability. Once the historical process had come about, other world-views could be just as compatible with science as Christianity ever was, if not more so, as in the case of Taoism.</page><page sequence="18">298 THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW Such was the negative effect of Europe on China. But if the West could not make clear and sincere the message of the 25th of December, that of the 14th of July was a very dif ferent matter. Christianity has been well called "the grand mother of Bolshevism," but that ancestry had been part of a particular historical process, and philosophically other grandparents or "foster-grandparents," e.g., Confucianism or Taoism, could qualify in other parts of the world. The revo lutionary socialism of the great European bourgeois revolu tions, from the Levellers at Burford Bridge to the Sans Culottes storming the Bastille, went over into Chinese cul ture without the slightest obstacle because it had to do more clearly with the fundamental needs of men incarnate in their material being. This was the great positive effect. On such common ground China and all Asia could accept European influence unhesitatingly, for Europe, too, was giving some thing up—its own heritage of medieval feudal and capitalist oppression, as well as all the beliefs connected therewith.21 Besides, in the course of time, a more enlightened West would be ready to accept Chinese influence once again, as it had done with such effect in the 18th century.22 All the pioneers of modern China were marching in this demonstration. One of the greatest of Sir Thomas More's successors was Khang Yu-Wei, who in his Ta Thung Shu (Book of the Great Togetherness) sketched a "utopia" extra 21 This has been seen by J. R. Levenson in a brief but most acute paper, "Western Religion and the Decay of Traditional China; the Intrusion of History on Judgments of Value," Sinológica, 4 (1954), 14. He reprinted it in his book, Confucian China and its Modern Fate; the Problem of Intellectual Continuity (London, 1958), pp. 117 if. This work is full of ingenious studies and valuable insights, yet it fails altogether in its main objective, namely, to show that contemporary China has lost its roots in the past. Indeed, in its anxiety to magnify Western influence on Chinese thinking at all costs, Lev enson's work runs grave risk of being described as the last refuge of the doc trine of Western intellectual superiority. 22 Europe's discovery of a morality without supernaturalism, a chronology without a flood, and a cosmology without any crystalline spheres is an oft told story which need not be repeated here. But I shall never forget the im passioned telling of it long ago at a lecture in Cambridge, to which Dr. E. R. Hughes came armed with the heavy artillery of Confucius Sinarum Philo sophus in folio.</page><page sequence="19">THE PAST IN CHINA S PRESENT 299 ordinarily farseeing in its structure and imbued with many traits characteristic of the Chinese tradition as well as of the modern scientific world-view.23 The greater Sun Yat-Sen, that improbable medical revolutionary to whom I have al ready referred, did his best in his Three Principles to put socialism into Chinese terms.24 It is surely needless to recall that at that time the influence of the Russian Revolution on Chinese thinking was extremely powerful. And, indeed, until 1927 the Kuomintang was a real positive force, even if only semi-conscious; it did a great deal to modernize the country, to stamp out abuses, and to continue the tradition of public works and public ownership of industrial enterprises. Only after the crisis of that year was it fully captured by the land owner-banker-comprador group, who found it much more profitable to engage in financial speculation abroad than to develop their own country. But this only postponed the in evitable conclusion, for what the Chinese people fundamen tally appreciated of Europe was the ideal of liberty, equality, and fraternity, not the theology of a Church too often, alas, subservient to the powers that be.25 Moreover, the merit of marxism (or, as it was called by its founding fathers, "scien tific socialism") was, in Chinese eyes, that although it had originated in a particular historical situation in Western 23 This work was conceived and first drafted in 1884 and 1885, first printed (in part) in 1913, and first completely published in 1935 (reprinted in Peking in 1956). An excellent but abridged translation by L. G. Thompson, The One-World Philosophy of Khang Yu-Wei (London, 1958), is now available. 24 Besides the paper by Scalapino and Schiffrin mentioned in the preced ing article, see H. Schiffrin on Sun Yat-Sen's land policy in Journal of Asian Studies, 16 (1957), 549. On that great man there are many books, but reference to L. Sharman, Sun Yat-Sen, his Life and its Meaning; a Critical Biography (New York, 1934), will have to be enough here. A Source-Book of Sun Yat Sen's Political and Social Ideals was collected and translated by Hsii Shih Lien (Los Angeles, 1933). 25 One might find parallels within the European orbit itself. In his recent book, The Greek East and the Latin West; a Study in the Christian Tradi tion (Oxford, 1959), Philip Sherrard, writing of the time of Korais in the early 19th century, says: "Thus the union with Western Europe which the Greek East had so energetically rejected at the close of the Byzantine period was at last to be accomplished, not any longer in Christian terms, but in those of the secular and temporal ideals of the modern West."</page><page sequence="20">300 THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW Europe, its doctrine, like that of physical science itself, was intrinsically universal, not tied to any particular civilization, and capable of illuminating and analyzing the social history of the Chinese themselves. And so both Chinese and West erners could go forward on an equal and mutually apprecia tive basis, both working to end the oppression of the past in all its forms, "neither afore nor after other," "without any difference or inequality."26 VII. China and the History of Law All this was bound to have a great effect on the Chinese conceptions of law. One can well understand why there was no feeling of outrage when the previous Kuomintang code, after all a very artificial importation from the West, was swept away and replaced by more popular laws. In fact, throughout Chinese history there was a great dislike of codi fication and a strong aversion to abstract legal principle.27 The devotion of Roman law, for instance, to highly abstract formulations cannot be paralleled at any time in China. 2« On the vitally important mental attitudes here involved, the controversy between Umberto Campagnolo and Alioune Diop which has recently been going on in Comprendre, 19 (1958), 7 ff., 9 If., 157 ff., is well worth reading. Campagnolo voices a widely held view when he states as a dilemma that either the great historical civilizations are immiscible and irreducible individ uals, in which case they can never meet, or they are destined to transcend themselves in a world culture, in which case no one can know what this will be. Campagnolo escapes from this by maintaining that one of the great civiliz ations possesses in its original intuition and principles the means which per mit it to understand and to estimate the others, and to lead them to estimate themselves according to its own scale of values. This is the "civilization of the universal" which has developed only in Europe (and by extension, in America) and upon which devolves the historic mission of accomplishing the ethnic unification of the world. To this Diop replies that such a doctrine is nothing but racialism in its most rarefied, insidious, and Sunday-go-to-meeting form. The civilization of the universal cannot for a moment, he says, be confused with the civilization of the West, but must necessarily arise from the contribu tions of all peoples; and the fact that we cannot yet know its features is not an argument for denying that it will come. Needless to say, I am fully in sympathy with Diop. The conception of the "chosen people," God's elect, which Europeans and Americans have transferred to themselves from ancient Israel by way of the link between puritanism and capitalism in the early phases of Western technological development, is still working great evil in the world. 27 This is explained more fully in SCC, Vol. 2, pp. 521 ff.</page><page sequence="21">THE PAST IN CHINA'S PRESENT 301 There was a profound belief that every case ought to be judged in the light of the concrete circumstances, i.e., on its own merits. I am not, of course, saying that there was never any codification of law. On the contrary, there were jurists in every century from the Han onwards and many of them compiled great collections of law cases; moreover, there were official codes, of course, in each dynasty. Yet on the whole they never played anything like the part (many people would say the "sublime part") of the Justinian code and the other great legal institutions of Europe. Furthermore, the idea of equity, if that is the right way to phrase it, was much more important in China than the idea of positive law. Expres sions like summa lex, summa injuria, would have been in conceivable in traditional Chinese society. Arthur Waley once excellently remarked that in China in the Middle Ages no magistrate, having made what he knew to be an unjust judgment, would have descended from his bench congratu lating himself on having faithfully applied the law of the land.28 This was not a characteristic of Chinese jurispru dence, nor was there any delight in legal fictions. Similarly, Chinese medieval society was not characterized by great ad diction to litigation. People chiefly kept out of the way of the nosphomeric civil magistrate as much as they could, and did not enjoy taking cases to be judged in civil actions such as the West delighted in. Advocates and pleaders were there fore scarce, and the magistrates' consciences were counsel for the defense. Such differences in the conception of law in China and the West do seem to help in explaining the changes of the present day. VIII. China and the History of Science Finally we come to the last question which I wish to raise, namely, the position of Chinese culture in the history of science and technology. Only the study of the social, intel 28 A.

One may say, broadly speaking, that Chinese science and technology were very much more advanced than those of Europe (apart from the Hellenistic wave of brilliant theo retical formulation) between the —3rd and the -}-15th centu ries, but after that, Renaissance Europe began to take the lead. Indeed, in Galileo's time the technique of scientific dis covery may be said to have been itself discovered, with the re sult that the unified world of modern science came into being, common to all men and liberated from the ethnic stamp which had qualified all forms of medieval science and tech nology. As I have said elsewhere,29 one must understand clearly that Renaissance Europe did not give rise to "Euro pean science," but to universally valid modern science, in which men and women of all cultures can freely participate. The fact that this break-through took place in Europe and in Europe only is not proof of any specially privileged qual ity of the "Faustian soul," as the Germanic mystagogues used to maintain, nor is it an argument for conferring upon Euro pean civilization a superior rank as the "culture of the uni versal" as certain writers today still like to maintain. For until it has been demonstrated that the concrete historical development of Europe, the form of its feudalism, the needs of its growing mercantilism and industrialization, the prior impulsions and facilitations of its intellectual history from the pre-Socratic Greeks onwards, and other similar factors, will not explain in an adequate manner the "miracle of Galileo," we have no right to appeal to mysterious predestinations or gifts of the European spirit as the explanation of the origin 29 Comprendre, 12 (1954). 132; cf. SCC, Vol. 3, pp. 448 ft.

And, in view of the great achievements of non-European peoples on which this modern science was built, we have every reason for not doing this. As for China, the problem remains: why did the Chinese society of the -f-8th century favor science as compared with Western society, and that of the -J- 18th century inhibit it? What happened at the Renaissance in Europe, the im mense rise of modern science after the time of Galileo and the perfection of the method of the mathematization of hy potheses, had profound effects upon the relations of the peoples of East and West. We know only too well the results of it. We know how the Western standard of life was power fully raised by modern technology, and also how bad it was for Westerners to be granted those two or three hundred years of military dominance in which they could so easily overawe all other cultures.30 But if the world can avoid self destruction by the unimaginable powers which modern phys ics has unleashed, it can benefit almost unimaginably by them. Behind this question of why the rise of modern science took place only in Europe, and did not occur in East Asian civilization in spite of so many great Chinese achievements in the past in the scientific, mathematical, and technological fields, lie all the problems of the nature and development of Chinese society. We have already had occasion to make certain suggestions as to why nothing corresponding to the Renaissance took place there. The whole city-state motif was absent in China from the start. The merchant interest, of such cardinal im portance for the rise of modern science in the West, was systematically suppressed in China. Then there were the ideological factors, on the one hand the assembly of deified ancestors, and on the other hand the personal creator-god, whose rational decrees men thought they could spell out 30 Moreover, as J. Romein has well said in Comprendre, 19 (1958), 91: "from their temporary technical superiority Westerners wrongly inferred a peren nial Chinese technical inferority."</page><page sequence="24">304 THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW haltingly in their own mathematical language;31 or again on the one hand the indwelling Tao of things which made them spontaneously cooperate, on the other the assumption of atomistic impacts and mechanical propulsions.32 Natural science in its modern form seems to have needed a certain heuristic naiveté which Chinese natural wisdom lacked. Such was the first question which prompted me to devote the rest of my life to preparing a comprehensive treatise on the history of science, scientific thought, and technology in China. Afterwards I came to realize that behind this there was another question at least equally important: why, before the Renaissance, in the period from about —200 down to about -(-1400 or -|-145°, was China often so far ahead of Europe? This also has to be answered; why was bureaucratic feudalism so much more efficient than Hellenistic imperial ism or medieval Western feudalism in applying science to human affairs—very often, in a way, applying a theoretical science that did not exist? This paradox is rather nice, but one can give many examples to illustrate it, not all by any means in the technological field. Let us leave on one side the famous inventions of printing, gunpowder, and the mag netic compass, so justly celebrated by Francis Bacon. I have already referred to the mastery of the technique of cast iron, the obtaining and handling of iron in the fused state. In Europe no one knew any cast iron until about 4-1380. In China, however, they had been habitually making agricul tural tools of it as far back as the —2nd century. I cannot, of course, stop here to explain how it was done. I think we si See the references given in note 13. 32 SCC, Vol. 2, pp. 279 ff. It is highly significant that while theories of atomism never "caught on" in China though continually introduced in asso ciation with Indian Buddhist thought, the Chinese developed primitive but quite clear forms of wave-theory, especially in relation to the influence of Yang and Yin forces. This will be discussed in detail in SCC, Vol. 4, Part 1, but in the meantime, see J. Needham and K. Robinson, "Les Ondes et les Particules dans la Pensée Scientifique Chinoise," Sciences (Paris, i960). Simi larly, the idea of "action at a distance" aroused no difficulties in Chinese scien tific thinking and was accepted by everyone.</page><page sequence="25">THE PAST IN CHINA'S PRESENT 305 know.33 It is only one outstanding example of how far China was ahead of the West technically in those early centuries. Equally striking is the fact that in the absence of deductive geometry as developed by Euclid and Apollonius in the West, it was in China and not in Europe that long before the Renaissance the inventions of the equatorial mounting for the telescope34 and of the mechanical clock35 were made. This latter is particularly extraordinary, since China has so often been pictured as a "timeless" agrarian civilization. One point which may be very significant is that some of these medieval inventions were closely connected with the bureaucratic character of the culture. As instances one might mention the seismograph36 and the rain-gauges and snow gauges.37 In a closely knit bureaucratic structure, an élite society where there was a high degree of organization and foresight, even though feudal, it was desirable indeed to be able to know if and where an earthquake had occurred, in order to be sure to send relief and also perhaps troops to the area which had been severely affected. This was clearly the case in the -)-2nd century when the ancestor of all seismo graphs was put into operation by Chang Heng. Equally, the rain-gauges and the snow-gauges are interesting from this point of view because it was necessary to be forewarned if there were going to be serious floods, and we know from -f-nth- and -(-12th-century mathematical books, which give problems about the shape of rain-gauges, that they were quite widely used, probably established among the western foothills 33 See the references given in note 11 of the previous article. 3* SCC, Vol. 3, pp. 367 ff., and J.

Another example about which my collaborators and I have recently written at length38 concerns a very remarkable geodetic survey, the meridian arc established by Chinese expeditions sent forth in the year +723, which made measurements for two or three years and then combined the results. This was under the supervision of the Astronomer-Royal, Nankung Yiieh, and an outstanding Buddhist monk and mathematician, I-Hsing. This arc was undoubtedly the most remarkable piece of organized field work in the whole of the Middle Ages, for it ran from the borders of Mongolia right down to Indo-China, a distance of some 2500 kilometers, with about nine stations along it at which systematic observations were made of the summer and winter solstice shadows and polar altitudes. I doubt whether in any other medieval cul ture it would have been possible to imagine or to carry out such a highly organized scientific survey. It therefore clearly deserves remembrance, and it was certainly associated with the bureaucratic character of that feudal society. China today is recovering these past achievements and much work on the history of science is going on. There is a great enthusiasm there for science as the indispensable means of raising the Asian standard of life to equality with the rest of the world. But Chinese people are also beginning to be very conscious of the great discoveries, observations, and inventions made by their ancestors. They are getting to know about facts which the dust storms of history have hidden for centuries, and which historians of the modern West have not always been happy to uncover.39 Is it not im 38 SCC, Vol. j, p. 292 ft., but much more fully in the paper by A.

Stability perhaps, but where was the "societal stagnation" which some of our pundits find exemplified in medieval Chinese culture? Epilogue It has been my aim in the foregoing pages to provide a back ground for thought on contemporary China, seen through the eyes of one student of the history and culture of that great civilization. I have no wish to minimize in any way the extraordinary improvements in the lot of the "old hun dred names" which have been effected by the present Chinese government and under the leadership of the Communist Party.

Indeed, contemporary Chinese writers themselves, with the laudable aim of demonstrating the pro found renewal and re-birth of their country, sometimes tend to denigrate their own past, whether by emphasizing dark aspects such as the subjection of women or the rapacity of landlords, or by under-valuing the philosophy or art of for mer ages. This is only to cut off the branch on which they are sitting. The fact is that the rest of the world needs to learn, with all humility, not only from contemporary China but from the China of all time, for in Chinese wisdom and experience there are medicines for many diseases of the spirit and indispensable elements of the future philosophy of hu manity.</page></plain_text>
