<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shahrastani on the Arcana of the Qur'an: A Preliminary Evaluation Toby Mayer Institute of Ismaili Studies Introduction The oeuvre of cAbd al-Karim al-Shahrastani (d. 548/1153), whose epithets 'the Crown of the Faith' (taj al-din), 'the Most Learned' (al-afdal) and even 'the Proof of God' (hujjat al-haqq) bespeak his high repute, nevertheless lifts the veil on a startlingly bold and even eclectic religious intellectual of Seljuq times. The atypical drift may even be sensed in his best known works, the great doxography Kitab al milal wa'l-nihal (The Book of Religions and Sects'),1 written in 521/1127, and the Ashcari treatise Nihayat al-iqdam fi cilm al-kalam (The Limit of Daring in the Discipline of Theology'), written around 530/1135. For while the first takes over much data from earlier works like Ibn al-Rawandi's Fadihat al-Muctazila and Baghdad!'s Farq bayn al-firaq, it can also be viewed as set apart within the genre through its largely non-polemical tone and sweeping range of interest. The Nihaya, for its part is notable for the rigour and refinement with which the Ashcari school's familiar positions are unfolded. Unexpectedly, even in this dogmatic context the sheer breadth of Shahrastani's concerns remains evident, insofar as he only sets out the views of his school colleagues after detailing the alternatives espoused by Muctazilis, philosophers, Materialists (dahriyya), Shici extremists (ghulat) and even pseudo-Sabaeans and 'Brahmins'. Moreover, the Nihaya contains clear cases of the author's disagreement with the historical norms of Ashcari thought, as was noted by Guillaume in his far from satisfactory edition and translation of the work, and also by others.2 If such well-known works hint at a mind of some scope and daring, others, hitherto passed over, tell a story of perhaps even greater drama about Shahrastani. Three texts are in question. The first is his systematic attack on points of Ibn Sina's (d. 428/1037) metaphysics, known as Musaracat al-falasifa ('Struggling with the Philosophers'), dating from around 535/1140.3 The second is the Persian text descriptively titled Majlis-i maktub-i Shahrastani-i muncaqid dar Khwarazm (The Preaching Session Composed by Shahrastani, Held in Khwarazm'), possibly dating from around 538/1145.4 Finally, there is the subject of this article: his extant portion of Qur'an commentary, Mafatih al-asrdr wa-masabih al-abrar (The Keys to the Arcana and the Lamps of the Godly'), dated by the text itself to 540/1145.5 In these</page><page sequence="2">62 Journal of Qur'anic Studies works, which are somewhat later than those on which Shahrastanl's fame mainly stands, certain unusual currents should be acknowledged. In form the Musdraca seems a congeries and in style forbiddingly technical. An array of issues is handled, each under a set of subheadings in which the author firstly quotes Ibn Sina at length, then tries to bring out the inconsistencies within the quoted material as well as the absurdities which follow from it, and finally ventures what should have been said on the subject in the first place. A closer reading in fact lays bare a compelling unity in all this. The keynote of the whole treatise is divine transcendence - but in a much more uncompromising sense than normally understood. This proves to be the main grounds for Shahrastanl's criticism of Ibn Sina's thinking on each issue, and also the starting point for what should have been said - the 'correct' solution (al-mukhtdr al-haqq) to the question. More specifically: the author routinely blames Ibn Sina for failing to use concepts like 'intellect', 'oneness', 'substantiality', 'necessity' and even 'being' for God and creatures in a purely equivocal sense. In failing to do so, Ibn Sina's theological discourse is held to fall foul of his own principle of divine simplicity. For if the concepts he uses are not purely equivocal, according to premises coming down from the Aristotelian tradition, the uniform concept held in common between God and others may only be distinguished in Him through a differentia. So it follows that God would be made up of genus and differentia, and He would become composite. Against this, Shahrastam rules that any such concept when used of God, must at once be taken as radically equivocal. That is to say, its meaning in theology must be wholly sundered from its familiar ones, and is unthinkably higher. Yet Shahrastam lets through one slight sense in which it stays within reach of our thought. He holds that it minimally may be taken to signify that God is the origin of the more familiar concept, as found in creation. Insofar as the latter stands in opposition to some other concept, it can no longer be straightforwardly attributed to God since the Qur'an tells us do not knowingly set up rivals (andad) for God? Instead, when attributed to Him it is simply a way of affirming that He is the ultimate agent of both opposed realities and of their bipolar linkage.7 This then turns out to be the foundation for Shahrastanl's preferred solutions in metaphysics under the heading of al-mukhtdr al-haqq. For example, his proof of God simply rests on the reality of being and non-being in human experience and intellect, which presuppose an ultimate agent. But the radical implications of this stance should not be missed. For it follows from it that God is properly speaking beyond either non-being or being, and this is in fact exactly what Shahrastam enjoins in the Musaraca: God is a pure huperousion, wholly transcending the hierarchy of existent things (tacala wa-taqaddasa can an yakuna jalaluhu tahta'l-tartib fi'l-mawjudat).9 This ultra-transcendentalist position in the Musaraca gives some clue to the likely pedigree of the author's higher theology, as will emerge. In the Musaraca he simply traces it to what he euphemises as the 'explicit, pure, hanifi, revelation' (al-sharc al-zahir wa'l-hamfi al-tahir).10</page><page sequence="3">Shahrastani on the Arcana of the Qur'an: A Preliminary Evaluation 63 The Majlis on the other hand is a twin text to our Qur'an commentary, not only because of its likely dating but also because it dwells in the same hermeneutical world, and even boasts long passages of exegesis, albeit within the relatively cursory and informal framework of a Persian sermon.11 It refers to an unusual and clearly elaborate angelology and prophetology, in which angels work as intermediaries in the divine activity of creation, just as prophets are intermediaries in the divine activity of guidance.12 (This division of labour follows a deeper distinction, fundamental to Shahrastani's thought, between creation and the Command - to be dealt with in more detail below.) Not one, but two prophetic lines or 'lights' come down from Abraham. An evident light (nun idhir) is transmitted in Isaac's lineage, while a secret light (nun mastur) is transmitted in Ishmael's. In Isaac's line, that of the Biblical tradition, each prophet brings some particular new perfection; but in Ishmael's, ultimately surfacing with the advent of Islam, a synthetic perfection is found which combines them all. Moving on, Satan's failure to prostrate to Adam is not a failure to acknowledge God's status as Creator (khdliqt), rather it is a rejection of His status as Commander, a rejection of the divine Command/Logos (amr) itself, 13 and of the so-called 'mediator of the divine Command' (mutawassit-i amr). Shahrastani proceeds to trace all doctrinal errors within Islam to features of Satan's original imposture.14 While the Ashcaris are frankly mentioned here as defective along with Muctazills, philosophers, KarramTs etc., Shahrastani distinguishes them from the people of 'God has said and God's Messenger has said', and proudly numbers himself amongst them.15 While the identity of this faithful elite is again not spelt out, it looms, for example, in the author's reference to the apocalyptic figure known as the qd3im, who is to come at the eschaton to sift those who are to win Paradise from the rest. Shahrastani states without more ado that this figure will be cAlI ibn Abi Talib.16 Through a detail such as this a probable Shici context emerges for the features just mentioned: the strong hereditary concern in the prophetology, the claim that Satan's failure to prostrate to Adam - the archetypal 'mediator of the divine Command' - is a paradigmatic imposture in which later errors are somehow rooted, and finally the mysterious elitism of the author's own affiliation which contrasts with these errors. Indeed, in an involved exegesis of the episode of Satan's failure to prostrate to Adam in our own Mafatlh al-asrdr, the Shici message is made explicit:17 ... Just as Iblis did not assent to the present, living, current imam (al imdm al-hddir al-hayy al-qaJim), likewise are the commonalty (ka dhalika al-cdmma)... they do not understand that prostration to Adam was prostration to God. Nay, prostration to God, as long as it is not linked to prostration to Adam, is not [true] prostration to God, just as the formula 'no god but God', as long as it is not linked to the formula 'Muhammad is God's Messenger', is not the [true] formula of bearing witness and of sincerity.</page><page sequence="4">64 Journal of Qur'anic Studies The surprising impression that elements of Shlci teaching were espoused by this paragon of the Shaflci-Ashcari establishment under the Seljuqs, who had indeed held a position at the Nizamiyya college in Baghdad and possibly earlier at that of Nishapur, has gripped current scholarship on Shahrastam.18 Moreover, the predominant view is that the teaching in question was IsmacilT. Admittedly, even those who hold that it was IsmacIli, such as Diane Steigerwald, accept that the original audience of the Majlis in Khwarazm was likely to have been Twelver - in line with the earlier thesis of Muhammad Rida Jalali Na3inl.19 It is also incontestable that Musaracat al-falasifa was dedicated to a nobleman from the Twelver community of Tirmidh, AbuT-Qasim cAli ibn Jacfar al-Musawi.20 But the weight of evidence is that it was not a Twelver, but an Ismacill form of Shfism that influenced the thought of Shahrastam. Thus the very keynote of the Musaraca, as mentioned above - the extreme transcendentalism of its theology - wholly fits with Ismacili doctrine from the period, which unusually stressed the idea of a God 'beyond being',21 and was angrily censured for it.22 It may also be noted that certain Ismacill writings of the time did refer to Ismacilism as 'the hanif religion' and the reigning imam as its 'protector' (cismat al-din al-hanif) - in line, perhaps, with Shahrastanl's euphemism for his enigmatic higher orthodoxy in the Musaraca.23 Again, if the passage on Satan's refusal to prostrate, just quoted from the Mafatih, is scrutinised it emerges that while Shahrastam likens his non-compliance to the majority's refusal to 'assent to the present, living, current imam', he crucially also points out that the 'expectant Shica (al-shlca al-muntazira) only advocate the expected occulted imam (lam yaqulu ilia bi'l-imam al-ghaJib al-muntaz,arY.24 In other words, he makes clear his view that the Twelvers, just like the masses (al-camma), ultimately fail to acknowledge the 'present, living, current imam'. He instead promotes another contemporary ShicI group that acknowledges an imam who is not in occultation, and this would seem to point to the Ismacills. There is the powerful additional evidence of certain writings from the time. Shahrastanl's contemporary, Abu Sacd al-Samcam (d. 562/1166) states in his al Tahblr fi'l-Mucjam al-kablr that '[Shahrastam] was suspected of heresy (al-ilhad) ? 25 and inclining to them [sic]. He was extreme in Shfism (ghala fi'l-tashayyuc)' Samcanl's allegation has also come down in a more specific form, according to which '[Shahrastam] was suspected of inclining to the people of the mountain fortresses (kdna muttaham bVl-mayl ild ahl al-qilac), meaning the Ismacilis, their missionary activity and defending their calamities ...\26 Subki quotes this statement from 'the History of our shaykh Dhahabf and in fact proceeds to defend his fellow Shafici quite vigorously against Samcani's claim: T do not know whence Ibn al Sam?ani had that, for the works of AbuT-Fath indicate the opposite of that (inna tasanif AbVl-Fath dalla cala khilaf dhalikaf ,27 But that Samcani did not pluck his allegation from thin air is made clear by a final, remarkable witness. The major philosopher, astronomer and Twelver Shfi theologian Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (d.</page><page sequence="5">Shahrastani on the Arcana of the Qur'an: A Preliminary Evaluation 65 6121121 A) took active part in the Nizari Ismacili movement for perhaps as many as three decades of his life, and is owed a thoroughgoing treatment of Nizari teachings in his Rawdat al-tasllm. In his Persian IsmacIli confession, Sayr wa-suliik, he touches on the story of his induction into the movement as a youth, and states that at first his father shaped the direction of his studies, pointing him to a philosopher by the name of Kamal al-Din Muhammad Hasib who would hint regularly to him that 'it is possible that the truth [may be found] among people who are, in the eyes of the group that you know, the most contemptible people', i.e. the Nizaris. Tusi tells us that his father, for his part, was educated by a maternal uncle of his (khdl-i khud), who had been a student-attendant (shdgird wa-mustafid) of Shahrastani himself. What is remarkable is that TusI renders the latter's name here with the title ddci al du cdt (Chief Missionary) - hardly a vague honorific, but a highly specific rank in the Ismacili dacwa hierarchy.28 Thus a hundred years after Shahrastani's lifetime we 29 appear to have been given a decisive glimpse of the true extent of his involvement. However, to read the rich picture of Shahrastani's intellectual identity simply in terms of 'prudent dissimulation' (taqiyya) would be unfortunate. The model of eclecticism seems to fit him better than dissimulation - eclecticism, it should be added, in its newly positive definition and not as the term of disparagement used by earlier intellectual historians.30 Madelung, for example, stresses that Shahrastani always remained, communally, a ShaficI Sunni, and he points out that in the Kitab al-milal wa'l-nihal he seems to be frankly critical of the 'new dacwa' of Hasan ibn al-Sabbah for its seemingly anti-intellectual impact on the Ismacili community.31 If the sincerity of this can be doubted, given Shahrastani's overwhelmingly public profile in the Milal, it is harder to deal in this way with the stubbornly Sunni elements of the Qur'an commentary. Its modern editor, Muhammad cAli Adharshab, points out that Shahrastani's focus on ShaficI law becomes obvious in the course of explaining the juristic rulings of verses. Our commentator additionally refers to the views of other Sunni schools, but hardly ever to those of the Shica. He regularly relies on the Sunni sahih collections of traditions and even transmits material out of keeping with the doctrine of the infallibility of cAli ibn Abi Talib.32 It is surely especially noteworthy here that the commentary dates from the last ten years of Shahrastani's life. After two busy decades in Merv whence he had been attracted by prospects of patronage and had even become close to the Seljuq sultan, Sanjar, his world collapsed in 536/1141. This was the date when the pagan Qara Khitay federation crushed Sanjar's forces near Samarqand, driving Shahrastani to withdraw to his hometown, Shahrastana, where he lived on for another twelve years or so. Given the relative obscurity he then faced in his retirement, it seems unlikely that he would go on promoting a powerfully Sunni dimension in his teachings, had this dimension been solely a reflex of dissimulation.</page><page sequence="6">66 Journal of Qur'anic Studies Granted then that Shahrastanl's combination of Sunni and Ismacili elements in the Mafdtih was sincere, albeit eccentric, the fact remains that these elements are not level, but graded. The Mafdtih is a comprehensive (jdmic) type of Qur'an commentary, which covers each verse from many angles. It is mainly in his fascinating discussion of the asrar al-ayat, the 'arcana of the verses', that the author claims to base what he says on the authority of the Prophet's family (ahl al-bayt) while he freely depends on Sunni material in the more 'exoteric' aspect of the tafsir. He thus seems to have been particularly concerned that his higher hermeneutic (taJwll) of the scripture should be founded on some objective religious authority, rather than his own personal opinion. There are many statements to this effect. He asks for example at the beginning of his discussion of the arcana of the basmala formula: 'Who is it who has the ability to comprehend these arcana without guidance from the people of the Qur'an, who are the people of God and His elect (peace be upon them), or has the audacity to bring them up in books without permission and authorisation from them?'33 He proceeds to pray T take refuge with God, the Hearer, the Knower, from the stoned Satan, so that there may not occur in my thought, neither come to my pen that by which I would take up my seat in hellfire.34 May God (Mighty and Majestic) grant refuge from hellfire and its blazing, and may He protect us from swerving and slipping up in the hermeneutic (ta?wil) of the verses, or their commentary (tafsir)V35 Our author prided himself, in other words, on rooting the whole of his understanding of the Qur'an, and not just its externals, on a duly authorised teaching tradition. Let it be immediately said, however, that the precise link of Shahrastanl's ta?wil with the teachings of the Prophet's family remains elusive. While the sections on arcana do contain some material from ShTci ahddith, they also have unattributed examples of letter mysticism and many other items of esoteric interpretation. Above all, they employ a breathtaking framework of hermeneutical concepts which give the impression of a grand and strictly coherent system underlying the Qur'an, a kind of 'philosophy of the Qur'an'. While some of the concepts in question explicitly derive from Shici ahddith, it seems likely that others must derive from an on-going, living magisterium - perhaps in keeping with the nature of the Ismacili tradition. It moreover appears that Shahrastam, having once digested this system of ideas, felt free to apply it on his own initiative to each consecutive verse of the scripture. He thus became de facto though not de jure, an independent hermeneut. This view is strongly supported by a valuable detail from the passage partially quoted in the paragraph above, from the opening of Shahrastanl's discussion of the arcana of the basmala-fommXdL. He states:36 Since I am specified by the transmitted prayer 'O God benefit us by that which you teach us, and teach us that by which you benefit us, by the truth of the chosen ones amongst your servants', I found in myself</page><page sequence="7">Shahrastani on the Arcana of the Qur'an: A Preliminary Evaluation 67 the faculty of guidance (wajadtu fi nafsi quwwat al-hiddya) unto the word of prophecy and I understood the language of the divine message, so I was thereby rightly guided to the arcana of the words in the glorious Qur'an without my doing exegesis of the Qur'an by [mere] personal opinion. This vital statement seems to lay bare the real nature of the author's reliance on the ahl al-bayt, one which may turn out to have allowed him a degree of practical independence as a function of his very effacement in their authority. Thus, while he insists that he is singled out by the prayer that God teach us through 'the chosen ones amongst His servants', this paradoxically leads to him finding within himself the ability to do hermeneutics. The deeper background of such thinking may well be the IsmacIlI concept of the inner configuration (tamaththul) of the imam by his true disciple, such that he inwardly merges with him and in some sense may encompass his authority within his own identity.37 But however Shahrastani conceived the formal dynamics of this 'authorisation' process, in practice it simply allowed him to invest his rich ta3wil with the kudos of the ahl al-bayt, and to give it the potent aura of an authority ultimately flowing from the Prophet himself. In other words, what the reader is confronted by in the asrdr sections of the commentary, is essentially simply a thoroughgoing 'wisdom'-based hermeneutic of the Qur'an, one which focuses on unveiling the deeper intelligibility of the text from a quasi-philosophical viewpoint. And this may well be how Shahrastani's Mafdtlh struck its earliest audience. Thus - 38 his contemporary Bayhaqi says: [Shahrastani] was composing a Qur'an commentary, interpreted the verses according to the canons of the holy law (sharlca) and wisdom (hikma), and other things too. So I said to him, 'This is to give up what is right! The Qur'an is not to be commented on except by the reports of the pious ancestors (salaf), consisting of the companions and their successors. Wisdom [i.e. philosophy] is something quite separate from the exegesis (tafsir) of the Qur'an and its interpretation (ta'wil) - especially so [if] its ta?wil is already written. One may not combine the holy law and wisdom better than the imam Ghazali did (may God have mercy on him)!' Shahrastani was consumed by anger because of that... Despite the slighting tone, Bayhaqi's likening our author here to his older contemporary Abu Hamid Muhammad al-Ghazali (d. 505/1111) is thought provoking. Bayhaqi's analogy not only confirms the need to accent 'wisdom' in evaluating the Mafdtlh, but it also inadvertently gives us a model to understand Shahrastani's teaching as a self-consistent unity rather than a dissimulative</page><page sequence="8">68 Journal of Qur'anic Studies hotchpotch, namely, the model of Ghazali. His 'wisdom'-hermeneutic and higher theology were probably no more seen by him as at odds with his communal affiliation with Shaficism (and up to a point, Ashcarism) than were Ghazall's by him - the difference was simply that the Ghazalian hermeneutic was of Sufi derivation, whereas the Shahrastanian was, in some sense, of IsmacIlI derivation. In the following look at volume one of Adharshab's first edition of the Mafdtih, which contains the twelve chapters of Shahrastanl's introduction and his commentary on Surat al-Fatiha, the aim is to take stock of especially noteworthy features.39 The focus will not be the author's searching investigation of the sensus literalis (i.e. tafsir), largely overlapping with other commentaries, but whatever is linked to his bid to probe the sensus spiritualis (i.e. ta3wll): firstly, his outspoken account of the Qur'an's historical canonisation, on which he founds his theory that its ta3wil must flow from the Prophet's family; secondly, the key hermeneutical concepts which he introduces in the course of the introduction, and which he will go on to apply in his ta?wil in the sections on 'the arcana of the verses'; and finally his ta?wll of the arcana of Siirat al-Fatiha, in which we see how these concepts may work in practice. The Canonisation of the Qur'an in Shahrastanl's Theory In chapter two of his introduction Shahrastam formulates a teaching, clearly subtle notwithstanding its obvious controversy, on the history of the 'assembling' of the Qur'an (jam0 al-Qur?an), and on the scripture's true nature. As his discussion unfolds, despite some overlaps it is seen to fall into a broadly dialectical pattern, with thetic, antithetic and synthetic phases. In the first of these, he rehearses the consensual events which bore fruit in the cUthmanic textus receptus. Depending on a sequence of reports, he starts his account with the 'affair of Yamama', i.e. the region to the east of the Arabian Peninsula and south of Bahrain, which formed the tribal territory of the Banu Hanlfa.40 After rallying to their counter-Muslim prophet known as Musaylima, the Banu Hanlfa were beaten during the caliphate of Abu Bakr (d. 13/634) at cAqraba? in 12/633. Despite the resounding Muslim victory, many companions who had been learned in the Qur'an lost their lives - a grave danger, given that it was as yet mainly transmitted orally. The caliph therefore bade Zayd ibn Thabit gather the scattered shoulder blades, palm leaves etc. on which the scripture had been recorded part by part. Upon Abu Bakr's death, the resulting scripts were handed to Hafsa, the Prophet's widow. Her father cUmar ibn al-Khattab (d. 23/644), on acceding to the caliphate, then had these bound together to form a single codex. A fresh, more definitive project was under way between 32-3/652^4 during the caliphate of cUthman ibn cAffan (d. 35/656). cUthman's efforts were driven by urgent political considerations. There was a trend for the Muslims of Iraq and Syria to fight over the accuracy of the versions of the scripture in each other's keeping.</page><page sequence="9">Shahrastani on the Arcana of the Qur'an: A Preliminary Evaluation 69 The unity of the umma was paramount and the caliph took firm action. Again, Zayd ibn Thabit was picked to see the project through, along with a team made up of SacId ibn al-cAs, cAbd Allah ibn al-Zubayr and cAbd al-Rahman ibn al-Harith, with Aban ibn SacId's name also coming up in the reports. A new codex was put together from the extant fragments, and on completion was supposedly found to fit in all details with the earlier 'Hafsa codex'. The cUthmanic text was consciously assembled to supersede all others, with a view to forestalling further strife. The caliph therefore set up the new prototypical codex (al-imdm) in the Prophet's mosque in Medina, and sent official copies of it to Mecca, Kufa, Basra, Damascus and Yemen. Having set out these accepted facts, Shahrastani plunges into the second phase of his discussion in which he boldly problematises the cUthmanic text, again on the basis of transmitted reports. Given that by the sixth/twelfth century such doubts were barely ever expressed even by ShTci authorities, let alone those associated with Sunnism, it is certainly very noteworthy that our author explores them and is a gauge of how open his mind was to every line of inquiry.41 Moreover, while Adharshab understandably strives to minimise and even negate this aspect of Shahrastani's discussion, his problematic of the textus receptus is surely unavoidable in reaching any deeper understanding of his overall hermeneutic.42 His opening gambit is the case of Q. 33:23, a verse which was supposedly left out of the codex at first. As reported in Bukhari, Zayd ibn Thabit then tracked the revelation down to Khuzayma ibn Thabit al-Ansari and duly entered it in the text.43 The verse may be translated as follows: Amongst the faithful are men who fulfil what they pledge themselves to God to do. For amongst them is he who fulfils his promise (man qadd nahbahu) and amongst them is he who bides his time (man yantaziru). And they are quite unchanging. The words are said to refer to the martyrdom of four individuals: cAbd Allah ibn al-Harith ibn cAbd al-Muttalib, Hamza ibn cAbd al-Muttalib, Jacfar ibn Abi Talib, and CAH ibn Abi Talib. The first three (covered by the words 'he who fulfils his promise') were already dead by the time of the verse's revelation while cAli (referred to as 'he who bides his time') remained firmly alive. The fulfilment of his pledge by cAli (d. 40/660) was as yet far ahead, even lying at least six years in the future at the time of the cUthmanic canonisation project. The verse is thus inter alia a prophecy, in due course borne out by events, of 0All's assassination. Yet this verse, which equated CA1I during his lifetime with an exceptional list of martyrs, was actually at first omitted - and it is this detail which seems to interest Shahrastani. He mentions here (ostensibly as the view of others) that the recorded case of the omission of this verse might be part of a wider pattern in regard to revelations lauding the Prophet's family and bolstering their authority.44 At any rate, he goes on to bring forward other reported cases of revelations omitted from the textus receptus, such as 70 names of hypocrites originally entered in Q. 9:64, and the dyat al-rajm ('the verse of lapidation'), said originally to have been part of Sura 33, and which is presumably numbered among over 200 supposedly lost verses of the same sura,</page><page sequence="10">70 Journal of Qur'anic Studies which has 73 verses in its present form but which Ubayy ibn Kacb claimed originally had 286, or even 300.45 Shahrastam also inspects the qualifications of the two principal members of cUthman's team, Zayd ibn Thabit and Sacid ibn al-cAs. It is true, he says, that SacId was well known as a linguist. But he had never recited to, nor been recited to by, the Prophet. The whole project was therefore flatly rejected by Ubayy ibn Kacb, with whom the Prophet had indeed run through the entire Qur'an and whose recitation was followed by many early Muslims.46 Zayd ibn Thabit on the other hand was widely praised as the very 'scribe of the revelation', i.e. the Prophet's amanuensis. Yet even he was put down by the surpassingly authoritative Ibn Mascud, who said that Zayd was a mere lad, with his two side locks, 'playing with the boys', when he, Ibn Mascud, had already got 70 chapters of the scripture from the Prophet in person.47 According to traditions, the latter had even commended Ibn Mascud's recitation to the Muslims, as a virtual facsimile of the revelation as it had been delivered by God (kama unzila).AS By comparison, Zayd's credentials primarily came down to his scribal skills, and in consequence Ibn Mascud, like Ubayy ibn Kacb, opposed the whole cUthmanic codification project and in particular deplored the caliphal policy of destroying rival versions, going so far as to dub cUthman 'the codex burner' (muharriq al-masahif). Shahrastam here relays the gist of a report which has cUthman taking action against this critic of exceptional stature, dispatching a slave who assaulted Ibn Mascud with such ferocity that he killed him.49 Our author goes on to quote authorities like cUthman himself, Ibn 0 Abbas and cA?isha for the claim that the textus receptus involves cases of orthographical error and solecism (lahn) - problems which allegedly crept in during the transcription 50 process. An important part of the overall problematic is now introduced: the case of CA1L Shahrastam clearly has high regard for the claim that cAli was himself responsible for a project of his own, antedating cUthman's. The reality of an cAlid codex (mushaf cAli) is both argued by him through reports and on rational grounds. Rationally, he asks if it is conceivable that the Prophet would have been charged to deliver the revelation, yet wholly neglected such a vital matter as its collection and preservation, 'knowing [the while] that the likes of that scattered [text], were it not collected together, would disappear, neglected, and people would fall into division over it, after it was [precisely] sent down as a means of uniting people and for their following what it contained?'51 If it is conceded that such is unlikely, who then would have been a more obvious appointee than the Prophet's intimate, CAH, an individual perfectly placed to undertake the project 'on the basis of the method of 52 ? - direct stipulation and indication' (cala minhaj al-nass wa'l-ishara)? Shahrastam puts the (clearly rhetorical) question to his readers: was CA1T not a better scribe than Zayd, and a better Arabist than SacId?53</page><page sequence="11">Shahrastani on the Arcana of the Qur'an: A Preliminary Evaluation 71 Moving onto transmitted evidence, he rehearses the story of how the Prophet did indeed urge cAli to record the Qur'an in a definitive codex, and on his death in Rabic I 11/June 632 c All took a vow that he would not so much as enrobe until he had seen the task to completion.54 The cAlid codex supposedly straddled the very borderline between apographa and autographa. Its fidelity in regard to the ordering of the revelations and other issues of arrangement was allegedly guaranteed through the Prophet's personal direction while still alive. We are moreover told that cAli entered his own comments as marginalia, concerned in particular to record parallel revelations (or perhaps instances of equivocation: md ya ctaridu min al-kaldmayn al maqsudayn) in the scripture.55 Presumably Shahrastani offers these details on the form of the codex to lend credence to its historical existence. He transmits a report from Muhammad ibn Sirin (d. 110/728) that many desired to lay hands on the fruits of cAll's labours.56 The material resulting from his efforts was supposedly huge - Shahrastani mentions a report that records that it was a 'camel load' (himi baclr), much more, in other words, than the textus receptus. Yet if what is conveyed in the Mafdtih is to be believed, the cAlid codex was destined for rejection and concealment. In an account whose psychological implausibility is perhaps balanced by its mythopoeic power, CAH and his slave Qanbar convey the great codex to the Prophet's mosque and offer it to the Muslims there assembled. These representatives of the umma, presumably recoiling from the prospect of a version of the scripture fully validating cAll's authority over them and that of the ahl al-bayt, are next alleged to spurn his efforts outright: 'Away with your codex! We have no need of it!' (irfac mushafaka Id hdja bind Hay hi). His basic responsibility fulfilled, CAH goes on to vow that his version will never again be directly available: 'By God! You will never see it again!' (Id tarawnahu ba?da hddha abadan).51 It may be that focusing on the historicity of this account is to miss its point. The point for us is the story's functional subordination to Shahrastani's hermeneutical theory and his concept of the Qur'an, not the separate issue of the story's factuality. Whatever its factual status, Shahrastani evidently took it seriously, and its effect on him was to heighten, exponentially, the mystique of the ahl al bayfs teachings, implicit in which was understood to be direct knowledge of the hidden c Alid codex. The potency of this mystique is further sealed by the parallel between CAH and Aaron, to which Shahrastani gives some weight. cAli is of course famously equated with Aaron, the forefather of the Jewish high priesthood, in a number of ahddith traced to the Prophet.58 Shahrastani follows through the implications of this link, likening cAli's situation to Aaron's when the Torah was delivered to Moses at Sinai. Aaron also had to acquiesce to the Israelites' rejection of the divine plan in the famous event of the golden calf, explaining to Moses that the people reckoned me as weak and nearly killed me.59 The claim is also explicitly that the motive of Aaron's</page><page sequence="12">72 Journal of Qur'anic Studies behaviour - to forestall schism and disunity - was close to cAll's.60 Whatever the case, the greater significance of the parallel of Aaron comes out a little later when Shahrastam states that though the Torah in its prevalent form is (according to Islamic belief) marred, a copy of the original tablets inscribed by God Himself and bequeathed to Moses is yet jealously safeguarded by the Jewish high priesthood, the Aaronides (cindal-khassa min awlad Harun).61 The Muslim equivalent of the Aaronides is of course the imamate descending from CAH and the Prophet's daughter Fatima. So Shahrastanl's point is apparently that the cAlid codex is an intact version of the Qur'an in the hereditary 'high priesthood' of Islam, mirroring the situation in Judaism. 'The tradition of the two precious (or weighty) things' (hadith al-thaqalayn) is further critical evidence in Shahrastanl's case. According to the hadith in question which is preserved in both Sunni and Shfi sources, the Prophet announced (either on the Farewell Pilgrimage at cArafat, or at Ghadir Khumm, or in his room during his final illness, depending on the version) that he was bequeathing the Muslims 'two precious things: God's scripture and my offspring (citrati)\ He went on to assure them that 'as long as you hold fast to them both, you will never go astray. The two will not be sundered till they reach me at the Pool [of Paradise].'62 For Shahrastam, this hadith is the basis for reaching a correct understanding of Qur'anic verses which are widely taken as proof texts for the divine protection of the textus receptus, verses such as Q. 75:17, The collection of it and the recitation of it are incumbent upon Us, and Q. 15:9, We it is Who sent down the Remembrance [i.e. the Qur'an], and We are the protector thereof According to Shahrastam, these should not be used to silence any inquiries into the integrity of the cUthmanic vulgate or the genuine historical issues which relate to it. What the verses really mean is that notwithstanding these issues God assures the Muslims that the Qur'an in itself will never cease to be safeguarded. As he puts it: 'Though the Qur'an is neglected with one people, it is protected and shielded with another people.'63 For the hadith al-thaqalayn underscores that the Qur'an is with the ahl al-bayt till the end of time. It would be badly distorting to leave Shahrastanl's discussion here, in the 'problematic' in which he has raised concerns over the textus receptus and alleged the rejection of the precious 0 Alid codex. He in fact ends up with a synthetic position in which his theory reaches its real conclusion. He thus, apparently contradictorily, mentions traditions in which cAli himself warned sternly against excess (ghuluw) in regard to the Qur'an and against those who rejected cUthman and his codification. Unlike cUthman himself, cAli seems never to have presumed to draw attention to any lapsus calami or solecism in the cUthmanic text.65 On the contrary, he and his descendents recited from it and lovingly transcribed it in their own hand, setting an example of respect - despite allegedly not having been consulted in its production.</page><page sequence="13">Shahrastani on the Arcana of the Qur'an: A Preliminary Evaluation 73 Shahrastani here highlights that the Qur'an itself inculcates an attitude of high veneration for both the Torah and the Gospel, notwithstanding the acknowledged questions of authenticity and transmission which apply to them. These scriptures are to be accorded all due respect as a matter of principle, while acknowledging that they are only accessible in practice through multiple lines of transmission: the Torah has its received (i.e. Masoretic) and supposedly concealed (i.e. Aaronic) recension, as already mentioned; the Gospel on the other hand has no less than four primary recensions, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, which Shahrastani says are strictly speaking largely exegesis in which are embedded quotations of God's actual Word.67 The Qur'an, it seems, for Shahrastani is similarly only to be accessed through a binary transmission. Put in Kantian terms, the scripture in itself is virtually 'noumenal' and is 'phenomenalised' to the degree feasible through bringing together two separate channels, neither of which is self-sufficient. For while the textus receptus (the first channel) is subject to the said problems of transcription, the teachings of the ahl al-bayt (the second channel) lack sufficiency for an obviously different reason, namely, that the cAlid codex is only known in them indirectly and implicitly. Nevertheless, a uniquely authentic encounter is supposedly made possible through carefully combining the two channels of this transmission. And this is of course just what Shahrastani aims to do in his own approach in the Mafatih, an approach which thus claims to bring the Qur'an qua noumenon within our reach. Shahrastani closes his discussion with a testimony:68 So the Qur'an which is in our midst is the Word of God between the two covers, protected by God's [own] protection from change, alteration, solecism and error. For its [true] Scribe does not doze, and its [true] Intoner does not utter solecisms!69 It has a people who intone it with its true intonation, and know it with both its esoteric interpretation (ta'wil) and its sending down (tanzil). They dismiss the doubt of the doubters and the claim of those who allege falsification (al-mubtilun): And those firm-rooted in knowledge say: 'We believe in it. All is from our Lord.' And only men of understanding take heed (Q. 3:7). Prima facie, the statement seals the chapter with a declaration of pious deference for the cUthmanic text and its inerrancy - perhaps in a bid to diffuse the controversy aroused in the course of his discussion. Adharshab seizes on the statement as part of his case for Shahrastani's basic orthodoxy on the textus receptus and it is true that the acknowledgement that everything between the covers of 'the Qur'an in our midst' (bayna azhurina) is God's Word should probably be taken at face value: human interpolation in the textus receptus was not the issue for him. Yet the declaration cries out to be reconciled with the highly controversial tone of Shahrastani's problematic, and seems flagrantly at odds with it. While he has there</page><page sequence="14">74 Journal of Qur'anic Studies marshalled reports on the presence of solecisms etc. in the text, here he is - denying them outright. He is presumably bent, in part, on taking cAll's lead in not adverting to such things and in conferring nothing but the greatest respect on the masahif cUthmaniyya. But in addition it may be seen by now, that this need not be just a pious reflex or 'suspension of doubt', but have coherent grounds. For Shahrastam, the cUthmanic text is indeed nothing less than a true gateway to the noumenal scripture, especially if guaranteed through combination with the teaching of the ahl al-bayt 'who intone it with its true intonation, and know it with both its esoteric interpretation and its sending down'. And to be sure, the reciter and scribe of the noumenal Qur'an is neither solecistic nor dozing, since it is none other than God Himself. Shahrastanl's awe for the textus receptus, in other words, follows from his belief in its veridical link with the noumenal scripture, so this final declaration need not contradict the problematic. Shahrastanl's Key Hermeneutical Concepts The interpretations met with in the sections headed asrar al-ayat largely depend on a set of complementarities such as creation/the Command, hierarchy/contrariety, and the accomplished/the inchoative. Antonyms familiar from Qur'anic exegesis are also found - though with unexpected developments in meaning and application - such as generality/specificity, the abrogating/the abrogated, the clear/the ambiguous, and revelation/hermeneutics.71 Creation and the Command (al-khalq wa'l-amr), for their part, are said by Shahrastam to be the most fundamental of these distinctions, thus the premise for the others.72 They are the two primary realities which issue from God. The Command, ultimately identifiable with the Qur'anic fiat kun (Be!), is that by which the things of creation enter existence,73 and is therefore presupposed by creation. It may be compared with the concept of the Logos in Christian thought, through which 'all things were made' and without which 'was not anything made that was made'.74 The Command is also mysteriously identified by Shahrastam with the religious law and particularly the Qur'an, whose cosmogonic function he takes quite literally, leading him to a variety of profound speculations on its significance on the level of words and even of letters, as will emerge. In one important passage he equates creation and the Command with the scales (al-mizan) referred to in a large number of Qur'anic verses75 and he analyses various dicta to bring out the fact that the creation and the Command are indissolubly tied and imply one another - such as in the very formula Be [i.e. the Command] and it is [i.e creation] in verses such as Q. 16:40. Q. 55:1^ is another example: ... He created humanity [i.e. creation]. He taught it speech [i.e. the Command]. Again, Q. 14:24, A goodly word [i.e. the Command] is as a goodly tree [i.e. creation]; and returning to Q. 55:1^1, The All Merciful He taught the Qur'an [i.e. the Command]. He created humanity [i.e. creation]. In such verses, either the Command term or the creation term comes first, leading Shahrastam to explore the 'scales' symbolism further and to conclude that:76</page><page sequence="15">Shahrastani on the Arcana of the Qur'an: A Preliminary Evaluation 75 When what is weighed consists in things pertaining to the Command (amriyydt) and the religious law, its scales are the creation and creational things (khalqiyydt); and when what is weighed consists in creational things, its scales consist in things pertaining to the Command. Shahrastani's understanding that his other hermeneutical distinctions are premised on this one leads him to generate more elaborate schemata - subdividing the others through creation and the Command, as will be seen. It is noteworthy that the distinguo is a salient feature of Ismacilism in the period, during which much of its theological speculation centred on the nature of the Logos-Command, a reality which was essentially identified with the deus revelatus.77 Another conceptual pair argued by some to show the influence of contemporary IsmacIlI theory is that of hierarchy (tarattub) and contrariety (tadadd).1* The former is a 'vertical' differentiative principle while the latter is a 'horizontal' one. In accordance with the trend towards schematic elaboration just mentioned, contrariety is further divided by Shahrastani between creation and the Command, and he even says that contrarieties within creation and the Command can be in two different ways. Thus in regard to creation there can be contrariety between an existent and a non-existent, and also between one existent and another; and in regard to the Command there can be contrariety between faith and unbelief, and also between one faith and another. The Qur'an, according to Shahrastani, is characterised by constantly expressing the principle of contrariety: 'There is no verse in regard to the believers but another verse follows it in regard to the unbelievers, and there is no quality amongst the qualities of good but following it a quality amongst the qualities of evil is mentioned.'79 He even claims that 'were you to examine the words of the Qur'an you would find this contrariety in every word, except what God wills'.80 The title of the Qur'an, al-Furqdn ('the Criterion', from the verbal root faraqa, 'to discriminate'), is said by Shahrastani to be related to this differentiative function. On the other hand, the title al-Qur'dn, derivable through a 'spiritual' etymology from qarina, 'to join' (rather than its conventional derivation from qara'a, 'to recite'), is said to be related to the scripture's exactly complementary function of 'gathering together the things hierarchically ordered within it (mutarattibdt fihi)\ The twin functions are jointly alluded to in Q. 17:106, And it is a Qur'an that We have divided up ifaraqndhu) ...81 Hierarchy, for its part, is said in an intriguing statement by Shahrastani to pertain to the light of existence while its absence pertains to the darkness of non-existence. He quotes a hadith here which confirms that the absence of hierarchy implies the absence of existence: 'Human beings continue to prosper so long as they are different, and when they become equal they are destroyed.'82 Shahrastani says that hierarchy can be found in many different orders of being, for example between some</page><page sequence="16">76 Journal of Qur'anic Studies angels and others, some prophets and others, and some human beings and others - so, e.g., one human being may be a teacher of knowledge and another a student of 83 knowledge. On the other hand, the principle of contrariety is evident in the fact that one may be a student and another a 'dungfly'!84 A highly implicit reference to the world view and institutions of contemporary Ismacflism is conceivably present in all this, with its principle of instruction (taclim), its emphasis on the teacher-disciple (calim-mutacallim) relation, its stark juxtaposition of initiates and the majority (ultimately rooted in the ShicI principle of tabarru3, innocence through disavowal), and its co-ordination of cosmological and human hierarchies, the latter expressed in the complex official ranking of the hudud al-din. The inherently hierarchical structure of existence in its various orders of manifestation is used by Shahrastam in unexpected ways. In one lengthy and complex passage, it emerges as his own distinctive 'rational' basis for the doctrine that the Qur'an is miraculously inimitable (mucjiz). The basic argument is that just as nutq (i.e. the faculty of speech, also reason) constitutes humanity's superiority over other species and is inimitable as such for what is below it, so the perfection of nutq constitutes the superiority of prophets over human beings and is inimitable for what 85 is below them. Moreover, since nutq covers both speech and reason, not only the Qur'an's verbal superiority follows from this thinking, but also the supremacy of its intellectual and moral teachings. On like grounds, Shahrastam argues the error of judging the relative merit of one part of the Qur'an over another, since standing in judgement over something in this way presupposes possessing some standard which exceeds it, on which basis it is evaluated. Instead, the whole Qur'an must be considered a priori inimitable on the grounds of hierarchy in nutq.se In this our author implicitly disposes of arguments for inimitability founded on pseudo empirical inquiries into the verbal perfection (nazm or balagha) of the Qur'an. Likewise, his argument is equally to be distinguished from other historical attempts at a posteriori defences of inimitability, such as those based on miraculous dissuasion from imitation (sarfa), and the presence of supernatural information (cilm 87 al-ghayb) in the Qur'an. In the above we see Shahrastam using the complementarity in question to solve, not only problems of exegesis, but also issues of kalam theology. He extends a similar role to the next of his complementarities, that of the accomplished (mafrugh) and the inchoative (musta3naf). While the terminology is not without some basis in the Qur'an itself,88 some have again claimed that it has a more immediate source in contemporary IsmacIlism.89 At any rate, Shahrastam himself states that the concepts ultimately derive from a Prophetic hadith which he quotes in full, and it is noteworthy that while the latter is seemingly only partially attested in the Sunni sahih collections, it is given in full in ShicI collections, with a ShicI chain of transmission going back to the Prophet.90 A likely reason for this disparity is</page><page sequence="17">Shahrastani on the Arcana of the Qur'an: A Preliminary Evaluation 77 immediately clear in the context of the hadith as quoted by Shahrastani, for the scene is an altercation between Abu Bakr al-Siddiq and cUmar ibn al-Khattab, the sound of whose raised voices draws the Prophet from his inner apartment. It turns out that they have been discussing the problem of predestination. The Prophet intervenes and tells them to think in terms of an angel which is half fire and half ice - the ice neither melting nor the fire being extinguished. The great angel ceaselessly praises God as the sustainer of its paradoxical nature. The part of the hadith generally found in the Sunni sources is then the very last in which cUmar, still perplexed, confronts the Prophet with the blunt question: are our lives unfolding in the present (anif), i.e. inchoative (musta'naj), or are they accomplished (mafrugh), with their contents already determined? The Prophet answers that they are definitely accomplished, yet we must act nonetheless: 'Act! And each is eased towards what he has been created r ,91 for. The terminology, then, for Shahrastani originates with this thought-provoking hadith, in which he surprisingly takes the ice of the angel as representing the inchoative aspect of reality and its fire as the accomplished aspect of reality, though it is more obvious to equate the accomplished with the fixed element (ice) and the inchoative with the mobile element (fire). But these details should not distract from the simple power of the Prophet's explanation. The genius of the symbol of the paradoxical angel is clearly that it allows the necessary transition from the natural viewpoint in which the antinomy remains intractable, to a viewpoint in which the rationally 'impossible' co-existence of the terms is taken positively, as an on-going 92 witness to the divine potentia absoluta. As just mentioned, Shahrastani uses the accomplished/inchoative distinguo inter alia to solve thorny problems of theology. Extreme Muslim theological positions like that of the Necessitarians (jabriyya) who unqualifiedly denied free will and the Libertarians (qadariyya) who unqualifiedly affirmed it are said by him to arise from ignorance of the distinction. An exclusive focus on the dimension of the accomplished leads to the negligence (tafrlt) of the Necessitarians who affirmed that God simply commands sinners what they are in fact unable to fulfil - a doctrine abetting laxity. On the other hand, an exclusive focus on the dimension of the inchoative leads to the exaggeration (ifrat) of the Libertarians who denied the dependence of human actions on God - a doctrine compromising divine omnipotence. The secret is to affirm the concurrence of the two dimensions of reality, like the Prophet: '... his statement [to cUmar] "Act!" is an allusion to the judgement of the inchoative and "each is eased towards what he has been created for" is an allusion to the judgement of the accomplished.'93 The distinction can also be used to good effect in the central exegetical task of reconciling apparent contradictions between the verses of scripture (i.e. tarjlh). For example, certain verses command the Prophet to guide or reprove unbelievers, such</page><page sequence="18">78 Journal of Qur'anic Studies as Q. 20:44, Speak to him a gentle word, perhaps he will pay heed or be God fearing. Other verses state instead that there is no use whatsoever in such guidance, such as Q. 2:6, It is all the same for them if you warn them or do not warn them. They will not believe. As Shahrastam explains: 'Whoever does not understand the two judgements - combining the verses of those who defy admonition and the verses of the command to admonish, is hard for him. And that is the secret of secrets!'94 The point is clearly that verses enjoining guidance refer to the dimension of the inchoative and verses repudiating guidance refer to the dimension of the accomplished. Again, Shahrastam puts this distinguo together with that of the creation and the Command, thereby yielding a more elaborate schema. The accomplished and the inchoative in regard to the Command, in the sense of the Qur'an, is precisely represented by verses of the two kinds just mentioned - necessitarian verses and verses of commandment or admonition, respectively. On the other hand, the accomplished and the inchoative in regard to creation are held to be the two different orders of being: respectively, spiritual beings beyond time and space, and material beings within time and space.95 The next distinction, that of generality (cumum) and specificity (khusus), is a familiar tool in the discipline of Qur'an interpretation, yet Shahrastanl's application of it seems subtler and wider than its familiar one in the juristic interpretation of the Qur'an - for example in his own ShaficI rite - where it is vital in establishing the legal force of different verses and in the aforementioned process of reconciliation between prima facie antithetical revelations.96 In fact, according to Shahrastam there are at least three levels to distinguish: the general, the specific, and lastly the individual. As he says: 'There is no general expression in the Qur'an without specification having entered into it, and there is no specification without individualisation having joined it.'97 He ventures that the last of these levels of application (i.e. tashkhis) has been historically neglected in Qur'anic exegesis.98 Shahrastam proceeds, using an array of Qur'anic verses, to exemplify these levels. For example, 'humanity' (nds) may refer to the entire human species in verses like Q. 2:21, O Humanity! (ya-ayyuha'l-nas) Worship your Lord. On the other hand, such injunctions are not to be enforced on the level of pure generality since Islamic law stipulates that non-adults and the deranged are not legally answerable, though they technically fall within the human species. A further degree of specificity is found in a verse like Q. 2:199, Then hasten to where humanity (al-nds) hastens, which refers to the rites at cArafat during the Greater Pilgrimage. The verse's addressees are clearly enjoined to imitate a more specific group in their midst, called by Shahrastam the 'rightly-guided guides' (al-hudat al-mahdiyun), who are nonetheless termed 'humanity'. Finally 'humanity' in the Qur'an may even apply at the individual level since traditional exegesis states that 'humanity' in the following verse (Q. 4:54)</page><page sequence="19">Shahrastani on the Arcana of the Qur'an: A Preliminary Evaluation 79 means, simply, the Prophet himself: ... or are they jealous of humanity (al-nas) 99 because of what God gave them in His bounty? In fact, in this analysis of Qur'anic applications of nas Shahrastani can be seen to dilate the relative distinction of general and specific into no less than four degrees (general, relatively specific, more specific, and individual). The same dilation is found in his analysis of 'mercy' (rahma) in the Qur'an. The first three degrees of mercy are brought out on the sole basis of Q. 7:156-7, in which they follow in an exact sequence as the text unfolds: My mercy encompasses everything, and I will stipulate it for those who are God-conscious and give the poor-due and who believe in Our signs - those who follow the Messenger, the unlettered prophet. Here, the most general level of mercy is referred to first: My mercy encompasses everything. Next, it is made relatively specific and said to be ordained for the godly in a trans historical and pan-religious sense: / will stipulate it for those who are God-conscious and give the poor-due and who believe in Our signs. Finally it is narrowed down further as ordained specifically for Muslim believers: ... those who follow the Messenger, the unlettered prophet. Then beyond this, Shahrastani unearths a purely individual application of 'mercy' in the Qur'an - thus completing the fourfold series - since in a verse like Q. 21:107 'mercy' exclusively signifies the Prophet: We only sent you as a mercy for the worlds. Shahrastani's unusual concerns remain in evidence in his discussion of the standard exegetical concept of abrogation (naskh), which is marked in its subtlety. As before, the distinction of abrogating (nasikh) verses and abrogated (mansukh) verses is pivotal in the task of tarjih (reconciliation of contradictory verses) and in establishing the legal force of injunctions within the Qur'an. Two contradictory injunctions may be compatible on the grounds that one is revealed earlier, hence abrogated, and the other is revealed later, hence abrogating.100 Yet Shahrastani's discussion gains in interest when it emerges that he is not only concerned with the relation of one Qur'anic dispensation with another, but also that of the Qur'anic dispensation per se with earlier religions. There is an explicit analogy made by him between the intra-textual abrogation of one Qur'anic verse by another, and the inter textual abrogation of earlier scriptures by the Qur'an. He begins his treatment with three brief definitions of abrogation. Either it is the simple annulment of an established divine injunction (raf al-hukm al-thabit), or it is the expiry of the injunction's time period (intihd1 muddat al-hukm), or finally, it is a process of perfection or perhaps 'supplementation' (takmil).m Throughout his following discussion, he strives to defend the last of these views, thus refutes the first two. It seems that for Shahrastani it is quite wrong ever to take abrogation as amounting to the redundancy of any divine revelation: 'never hold the opinion that one divine system (sharlca min al-shara'i0) negates another or that its injunctions are annulled and others are laid down.'102 Instead each successive sharlca</page><page sequence="20">80 Journal of Qur'anic Studies supplements or completes (mukammila) what preceded it, from Adam till the Resurrection - and in a mysterious sense, even beyond the Resurrection, since Shahrastam adds that it will simply be 'the next genesis' (al-nash3a al-ukhra).m Within this continuum of revelation, the virtue of all is to be affirmed, nothing disowned. In this Shahrastam by no means compromises Islam's presumed pre-eminence relative to earlier shard3ic. He states clearly his belief that it is the final and noblest sharlca. Yet the claim is also seemingly that earlier shara3ic and their attendant laws are not just intrinsically valuable, but even more radically, that their efficacy at some level continues within Islam. The point is somewhat clarified by a careful threefold analogy presented by Shahrastam. Firstly, amongst things pertaining to the creation (khalqiyyat), there is the case of foetal development, as dwelt on by the Qur'an in a number of passages, for example Q. 23:12?14.105 The Qur'an significantly refers to the result of this process in which a spermatozoon in the womb grows into a 'clot' and the clot a foetus, as 'another creature' (khalq akhar). The key to the process, then, for Shahrastani is the combination of change and continuity, the change arising from the perfectibility of the self-same subject, not from a sequence of discrete subjects, one cancelled by the next. As he says: 'Were the sperm drop, amongst creaturely things, negated or annulled, it would not attain the second stage, nor the third, but it would reach the limit of its perfection and would not become another form of perfection, with the completion of its identity (maca istlfa3 dhatihdy.106 Moving now to things pertaining to the Command-Logos (amriyyat), there is secondly the case of different successive shard3 i\ in which there is the same process of change undergone by a single subject: 'Were the first sharica negated or annulled, it would not attain the second [stage] and the third, but it would reach the limit of completion and would not become a form of perfection, with the confirmation of its identity (maca istihkdm dhatihdy}01 Thirdly and finally, Shahrastani makes reference to the purely intra-textual abrogation of revelations within the Qur'an. The final, noblest sharVa contains an abrogated aspect - the latter being integral to the totality. In its sequential revelation over time there is both this aspect, subject to change and made up of the branches (furuc) and there is also a stable core which is the 'principles of religion' (usul al-diyana), the 'Mother of the Scripture' (umm al kitab) and which is analogous to the foundation in relation to the house (al-asas li 7 bayt).m We are clearly invited in this to view the various shara3ic in like vein. There is a unifying core in their principles, and there is also a shifting abrogated aspect - though even this is to be understood positively in terms of the process of takmll referred to above, as Shahrastani says, 'He only abolishes for some perfection (li-kamal) in which [the abrogated] has culminated'.109</page><page sequence="21">Shahrastani on the Arcana of the Qur'an: A Preliminary Evaluation 81 Shahrastani finally fleshes out his thinking through a concrete example drawn from the Qur'an, legislation whose very rigour again incidentally disabuses us of any assumption that his theory detracts from the earnestness of his Islam. Yet scrutiny of the example does put into stark relief the radicalism of his teaching on abrogation, and the fact that Shahrastani virtually negates it in any conventional sense - including abrogation of other shard?ic. He takes up the supposed abrogation of the 'verse of acquittal' by the 'verse of the sword'. The first is Q. 109:6, To you your religion and to me my religion, the second is Q. 2:216, Fighting is prescribed for you, and also Q. 9:14, Fight them, God will punish them at your hands. Our exegete flatly rejects the view that the latter injunction to fight simply abrogates the former injunction to leave alone 'the religions of the unbelievers' (adydn al-kafirln). In fact 'the verse of acquittal' stands permanently as the ne plus ultra of acquittal through verbal declaration (nihdya fi'l-tabarri bil-qawl), which is unsurpassable as the verbal and credal establishment of monotheistic faith (taqrir al-tawhid bil-lisan wayl-ictiqdd). Yet once established in its perfection, it requires the complement of acquittal through action (al-tabarrl bVl-ficl) which is the military establishment of monotheistic faith (taqrir al-tawhid bVl-sayf wa 'l-izhaq). While one kind of verse is logically consequent on the other, they yet pertain to two separate varieties of theistic self-acquittal which both stand in their own right. In other words, the 'abrogation' of the verse of acquittal does not mean that it is ever simply suspended. And Shahrastani in the end insists that this is in fact always the case with abrogation: 'Likewise every verse of the Qur'an which is said to be abrogated by another verse, the abrogating verse is found to be set up by the abrogated, not annulling it, nor negating it (la rafica wa-la mubtila).,lu If the extrapolation is finally made from this to the inter-textual sphere, we appear to be confronted by a teaching that while Islam properly succeeds earlier shard3 ic, through whose advent they are perfected, this succession is 'logical' rather than a question of displacing them in existence. It indeed assumes their existence in a synchronic, not merely diachronic, manner: they must 'be there' for it to exist. In all this, Shahrastani is surely defending a fundamentally tolerant and even 'ecumenical' attitude towards other faiths.112 As with other complementarities, Shahrastani reformulates the centrally important distinction of the clear and the ambiguous in terms of his other concepts. He points out that the distinction is fundamental since the Qur'an itself refers to its verses as falling into these two categories, notably in Q. 3:7, [God] it is who sent down to you the scripture consisting in clear verses (muhkamdt) - they are the essence [literally, mother] of the scripture - and other ambiguous ones (mutashabihat) ....113 Views on the precise scope of the two categories vary widely, and Shahrastani makes the clever point that most scholars' dependence on opinion in drawing the distinction, i.e. their problematic rather than apodictic definition of the terms, results immediately in the whole Qur'an becoming ambiguous. Tt is amazing', he says, 'that both the clear and the ambiguous verses in their opinion have ended up</page><page sequence="22">82 Journal of Qur'anic Studies consisting of ambiguous verses, since the exegesis of them does not prove to be based on certainty!'114 He instead states tersely that the 'people of realisation' amongst the learned simply identify the clear verses with his aforementioned category of the accomplished and the ambiguous verses with the inchoative. That is, the categories pertain to different aspects of the mystery of predestination, the clear verses relating to the closed, absolute dimension of God's omniscience (al-mafrugh) and the ambiguous relating to the open, contingent dimension in which free will operates and events are played out over time (al-musta'naf) - both of which stand on their appropriate level. It is typical here of Shahrastanl's hermeneutics that he reformulates prima facie juristic distinctions in unexpectedly philosophical terms, though they do not thereby lose their juristic applicability. His handling of the distinction of generality and specificity is another good example of this trend. The point is next made that hermeneutics (taJwil) - the more unnavigable project of interpretation, in contrast with exegesis (tafsir) - specifically pertains to the ambiguous/ inchoative aspect. This is drawn by Shahrastani from the next part of the verse just quoted, Q. 3:7, As for those in whose hearts is deviation, they follow what is ambiguous of it, seeking dissension and seeking its hermeneutic (taJwiluhu). Hermeneutics is the preserve of the imams and not just open to any believer. This restriction is confirmed by the rest of this famous verse (though this is not made explicit here by Shahrastani), for it goes on to say that the true hermeneutic of the Qur'an is only known to God Himself and to 'those firm-rooted in knowledge', i.e. the imams. (Note though that their inclusion with God depends on the punctuation espoused by Shlcism and supported by early authorities like Mujahid ibn Jabr al Makhzuml, but is ruled out by the standard punctuation of the textus receptus.)115 Shahrastanl's vital point will thus be that while the accomplished aspect of the Qur'an is accessible to regular Sunni exegesis, its inchoative aspect is only accessible through the imams. The practical significance of this comes out in the following. As with the couples earlier mentioned, Shahrastani further subdivides the clear and the ambiguous between creation and the Command to generate an elaborate final schema. On the one hand, some clear verses of scripture correspond with the accomplished aspect of creation (events already fulfilled through divine predestination, al-qadar) and others with the accomplished aspect of the Command (already known legal injunctions).116 All such revelations fall within the reach of conventional exegesis. On the other hand some ambiguous verses correspond with the inchoative aspect of creation (forthcoming events through the divine decree, al-qada3) and others with the inchoative aspect of the Command (legal injunctions which, though rooted in scripture, are only subsequently actualised).117 The momentous upshot of all this, then, is that anything in these last categories, comprising prophecies about the future as well as later legal applications, falls beyond the reach of conventional exegesis</page><page sequence="23">Shahrastani on the Arcana of the Qur'an: A Preliminary Evaluation 83 and depends on the hermeneutic of the imams. The discussion is admittedly highly terse and allusive, lacking in the concrete examples introduced in other contexts. But if it has been deciphered correctly, Shahrastani's allegiance to the Prophet's family appears in the case of the ambiguous aspect of the Command to have extended even to the practical legal side of his religion. At the beginning of the Mafdtih Shahrastani highlights the cosmic importance of the imams' role in the total process of divine revelation. The role of the imams is complementary to the role of the angels. The angels are instrumental in the 'sending down' (tanzil) of the revelation, the prior part of the process. The imams and the scholars who adhere to them (al-c ulamaJ al-sddiqa) are instead instrumental in the 'taking back up' (ta'wll, 'hermeneutics', literally translated) of the revelation, the later part of the process. Both together complete the full cycle of revelation, from God to God, and both are in fact exercising a divine function, as confirmed by Q. 15:9, We send down the Remembrance and We are its protector - that is, God is the real agent of the scripture's descent via the angels and God is the real guardian of its meanings via the imams. The analogy of the two kinds of divine functionary is underlined by Shahrastani when he speaks evocatively of the imams (and authentic scholars) using a famous Qur'anic description of the angels: they are both ranged for [God] before Him and behind Him.m These powerful underpinnings of Shici mysticism - undoubtedly central to our author's own view of his enterprise - nevertheless need not distract from the intrinsic coherence and brilliance of the conceptual system which he has here provided for uncovering the Qur'an's arcana. In essence we are simply confronted in all the above by a thoroughgoing 'philosophy of the Qur'an'. Shahrastani's Commentary on Surat al-Fatiha The framework of ideas presented above is applied in the sections on arcana throughout the Mafdtih, including in his commentary on Surat al-Fatiha. Shahrastani thoroughly discusses each verse under a set of headings which may vary slightly from one verse to the next. Amongst these rubrics are found 'lexicography' (lugha), 'linguistic coinage' (wadc), 'etymology' (ishtiqdq), 'grammar' (nahw), 'harmonious order' (nazm), 'exegesis' (tafsir), 'semantics' (macdni) and finally 'arcana' (asrdr). Ideas presented under other headings are often assumed in the exposition of arcana. Thus the latter is arguably the flower of Shahrastani's commentatorial project and so is the main focus of the following summary. An important example of how the overall commentary finds its resolution in the 'arcana' is the question of whether or not the basmala formula (In the Name of God, the Infinitely Merciful, the Compassionate) is to be included in the Fatiha and taken as its first verse, or excluded and taken as a mere division-marker. This question amounts to an important problematic in Shahrastani's commentary.119 From the</page><page sequence="24">84 Journal of Qur'anic Studies earliest period some authorities viewed the opening formula as non-essential to the sura or indeed to any sura of the Qur'an. Nevertheless, those who took this view had to reckon with the definition of the Fatiha as sevenfold, resulting from its clear identification in hadith with the 'Seven Repeated Ones' (or 'Seven Doubled Ones', sabcun min al-mathani) referred to in Q. 15:87. Assuming that this necessitated a division of the Fatiha into seven verses, authorities excluding the basmala had to introduce a new verse division to create seven verses out of the remaining six, and they did this by taking You have graciously favoured (ancamta calayhim) in verse 7 as the end of a new verse 6 and the remainder of that verse as verse 7.120 Shahrastani presents a variety of trenchant arguments against this with foundations in tradition, reason and finally in the more esoteric considerations explored in the arcana. As an example of the first kind of argument he mentions a prophetic tradition according to which any important matter begun without the basmala formula is 121 ? 'emasculated' (abtar). Religious consensus (ijmac) moreover states that the pauses of the Fatiha are fourfold, and ancamta calayhim is not one of them. As an example of the second kind of argument, Shahrastani proposes that the verse endings, through their phonological harmony (insiyaq), indicate that the basmala must be integral to the Fatiha. For the insiyaq throughout involves the vowel -i plus an unvowelled consonant. This produces the following perfect sevenfold sequence: -him, -min, -him, -din, -?in, -qim, and -lin.122 It is clear that ancamta calayhim conflicts with this sequence. But Shahrastani insists that actual certainty on this matter can only arise through the contemplation of the arcana of the Fatiha.123 As will emerge, his whole analysis of the arcana amounts to a remarkable sevenfold division of the Fatiha which is somewhat different from the conventional sevenfold division involving its verses. In this esoteric interpretation, the repetition or 'doubling' suggested by the Qur'anic title of the Fatiha (i.e. al-mathani) does not so much refer to the fact that the verses are repeated in the course of the formal ritual prayer of Islam (saldt). Rather, it refers to certain echoed concepts or 'reprises' (mardudat), of profound significance, which run through the Fatiha. These echoes, which Shahrastani presents in detail, are later found to be exactly seven in number - but only if the basmala formula is treated as integral to the sura. This discovery, then, emerging in the course of the 'arcana', turns out to be Shahrastanl's ultimate proof that the opening formula is essential to the Fatiha.124 Shahrastanl's first section on arcana pertains to the divine name Allah, whose importance is such that it merits a discussion in its own right, independent of the context in which the name first appears, the basmala.125 The group credited with these teachings on the divine name's arcana (who are referred to as 'those who magnify God's names', al-muc azzimun li-asmd3 Allah) reject outright the idea that it can be thought of as derived via any etymology (ishtiqaq). Nevertheless, under the heading 'linguistic coinage' (wadc)126 Shahrastani does presently air the views of</page><page sequence="25">Shahrastani on the Arcana of the Qur'an: A Preliminary Evaluation 85 scholars who acknowledge its derivative (mushtaqq) status, including thought provoking derivations of it from waliha, 'to become mad with love' (suggesting that 127 ? this condition befalls God's worshippers) and also from laha, 'to hide oneself 128 (suggesting pure transcendence and the deus absconditus). Prominence is given here to a view attributed to al-Hasan al-Jurjani that the name comes from the verb aliha, 'to seek protection', yielding the word ildh (god) which signifies that 'refuge is taken in Him' (yulahu ilayhi) on the analogy of imam (leader), signifying that the person in question 'is followed as an example' (yu'tammu bihi). To this original form of the word was then supposedly added the Arabic definite article, al-, as an honorific, producing al-ildh, 'the god'. Then, through frequent usage, the 'a9 of al ? ? 129 and the 7' of Hah coalesced to produce the name in its prevalent form: Allah. However, under the heading 'arcana' Shahrastani makes clear that he himself prefers not to historicise the proper name of God in this way.130 Instead a variety of highly esoteric interpretations of the divine name are presented which discover powerful theological meanings in its form, or as Shahrastani says: '... the letters which are the make-up of the word refer to that which was commissioned with the gnosis of Him.'131 The most important of these analyses has the pronoun huwa (He) as its starting point. This is represented by the final '/z' of the name, which fully vowelled in the nominative would be Allahu (huwa then being produced from -hu by the addition of the consonantal 'consort', qarina, of V namely 'w'). This ultimate ground of the divine name amounts, supposedly, to a reification of the godhead (an affirmation of its 'thingness', shay'iyya). It is also said to signify God's 'majesty' (jalal) or absolute transcendence insofar as it acknowledges implicitly that God's 'He-ness' (huwiyya) or quoddity (the fact that He is) is what is graspable of Him, while His intrinsic identity (mdhiyya) or quiddity (what He is) remains utterly beyond grasp.132 Shahrastani then explains that to this -hu is next added a second affirmation represented by the prior 7'. The Arabic prepositional form //- signifies that what adjoins it has the status of responsibility and possession, Shahrastani calling it the 'lam affirming possession' (lam al-tamlik).m Prefixed to the pronoun -hu to make lahu (i.e. 'His', or 'due to Him') it affirms that everything non-divine is God's possession (milk) and God's dominion (mulk). This then points to the great complement of God's attribute of majesty (i.e. transcendence), namely His 'bounty' (ikram, creative largesse) - in line with Q. 55:26-7, All that is in the world will pass away and your Lord's Self alone will endure in its majesty and bounty (dhu'l-jalali wa'l-ikrdm). Shahrastani later spells out the significance of these twin attributes with the important statement: 'He is veiled from them through His majesty, so they may not perceive Him, and He manifests Himself to them through His bounty, so they may not deny Him.' Thus these two affirmations - represented by the final '/*' and the medial 7' of the divine name - express the paradox that God is simultaneously</page><page sequence="26">86 Journal of Qur'anic Studies ungraspable and undeniable, or in Shahrastanl's words: 'Insofar as He is He (huwa) He is ungraspable and insofar as all belongs to Him (or is due to Him, lahu) He is undeniable.'135 Lastly the 'a' is in turn added to the 7' to give al-, the Arabic definite article. According to Shahrastani the significance of grammatical definition (tacrlf literally 'making to know') in regard to God is to affirm that He is in fact more well known (acraf) than anything else.136 In short, in this extraordinarily ingenious analysis the entirety of the divine name comprehends both the deus absconditus and the deus revelatus. The name affirms through its extrema that God is simultaneously utterly hidden (i.e. through -hu) and utterly apparent (i.e. through al-), and it shows through its median (i.e. 7') precisely in what respect His hiddenness and apparentness are compatible. A final observation may be made: the direction of Shahrastanl's analysis (i.e. from the '/z' of reification, through the 7' affirming possession, to the V of grammatical definition) is the exact reverse of the oral articulation of the name. Thus the unfolding of inward meanings in the name is in a chiastic or mirror correspondence with the unfolding of its outward letters and sounds - an inversion typical of the relationship of the two realms of interior significance and exterior form. In Shahrastanl's teaching, the highest role of the Qur'an, and especially the divine names in it, is to express God for the benefit of creation - a se/f-expression amounting to a substantive manifestation. Shahrastani thus shifts from the relatively uncontroversial proposition that the divine names in scripture give information about God, to the proposition that they are actual epiphanies of Him. In the discussion in question Shahrastani makes use of the old Sufi distinction between the disclosure of God by something else (tacrif) and the disclosure of God by Himself (tacarruf):131 Wherever you find in the Qur'an a verbal expression for whatever is linked to one of the divine names, it is for the sake of disclosing [God], every disclosure (tacrlj) being [God's own] self-disclosure (tacarruf) to something, and every self-disclosure being an epiphany (tajalli) of His ... Jacfar al-Sadiq's statement is quoted by Shahrastani in this context: 'God manifests Himself (tajalla) to His servants through His scripture.'138 In this distinctively 'positivistic' form of scriptural mysticism sense and reference wholly coincide and the cosmological function of divine attributes is actually ascribed in a literal manner to God's relevant names in His Book. Contemplation of scripture is viewed as an objective encounter with the transcendental roots of all things - God's nomen proprium in the Qur'an being the example par excellence of this. Thus for Shahrastani, the constituent letters of the divine name (i.e. A, L, L, H) underlie created existence in an objective sense, and he terms them the 'four foundations' (al mabadi0 al-arbaca).m Again, the basic form of tridimensional space, the so-called</page><page sequence="27">Shahrastani on the Arcana of the Qur'an: A Preliminary Evaluation 87 'primary body', is traced to the letters' different characteristics. The height of the primary body is said to be related to the vertical extension of the alif, its breadth to the horizontal extension of the lam, and its depth to the cavity of the ha'.140 The three great names of God which follow in sequence in the basmala, Allah, al rahman, al-rahlm (or rather the divine attributes of ilahiyya, rahmaniyya and rahlmiyya) are said by Shahrastani to relate to the sequential divine activities of existentiating, maintaining and rewarding creatures. Mutatis mutandis, they are spoken of as sustaining the three 'worlds': respectively that of creation, the Command, and the future eschaton or the 'world of merit'.141 This point is undergirded with a number of Qur'anic quotations. The equation of ilahiyya with creation may be supported by Q. 43:87, If you ask them who created them, they will surely say Allah. The equation of rahmaniyya with the Command may be supported (albeit via a more intuitive and associative kind of thinking) with Q. 25:60, What is al-rahman? Are we to prostrate to whatever you command us? Finally, the equation of rahlmiyya with the eschatological realities of reward and merit may be supported with Q. 33:43, He is compassionate (rahlm) towards the believers}42 The aspect of divine mercy (rahma) expressed by the name al-rahman is thus quite different from the aspect expressed by the name al-rahlm. The former name of God is linguistically more intensive, so that the equivalent adjectival form ghadban, from ghadiba 'to be angry', means not just 'angry' but 'consumed by anger', 'furious'.143 In the Qur'an, al-rahman, 'the Infinitely Merciful', is reserved exclusively for God and is explicitly said to be interchangeable with the divine nomen proprium itself: Pray to Allah or pray to al-rahman ...\144 On the other hand the adjective rahlm can be predicated of both God and creature, and the Qur'an explicitly applies this adjectival form to creatures as well as to God, for example: For the believers [the Prophet] is full of pity, compassionate (rahlm)}45 Shahrastani's hermeneutic of these two divine names is rooted in a venerable tradition of interpreting Q. 7:156, as already quoted: My mercy encompasses everything and I will stipulate it for those who are God-conscious etc. In a view which purportedly goes back to such eminent early exegetes as Ibn c Abbas, Muqatil ibn Sulayman and SacId ibn Jubayr, the verse is understood to refer in succession to a general or indiscriminate mercy and a particular or discriminate mercy.146 The former is explicitly stated in the verse as encompassing all existents whatsoever, while the latter is reserved for the God-conscious believers alone. This vital distinction would presently be definitively encapsulated by the great Hispano-Arab mystic Ibn al-cArabI (d. 638/1240) in his contrast of the 'mercy of gratuitous gift' (rahmat al-imtinan) and the 'mercy of obligation' (rahmat al-wujub)}41 Mercy in the former sense pertains to the intensive name al-rahman, while mercy in the latter sense pertains to the name al-rahlm. Shahrastani, for his part, contents himself with drawing attention to a beautiful symmetry between the two names in a formulation</page><page sequence="28">88 Journal of Qur'anic Studies which again takes the form of a chiasmus. This might be expressed as follows: rahman is exclusive in predicability (used only of God) but inclusive in operation (extending to all existents) while rahlm is inclusive in predicability (used of God and creature) but exclusive in operation (extending only to believers). Shahrastani expresses this with typical concision: 'rahman is specific as a name (khass al-ism) but general in meaning (camm al-macna) and rahlm is general as a name (camm al ism) but specific in meaning (khass al-macna).'m These two kinds of mercy, represented by the two relevant names in the basmala, are offered by Shahrastani as the second 'doubled one' referred to by the Fatiha's title 'the Seven Doubled Ones'.149 The first, according to him, is in fact made up of the whole basmala formula of verse 1, and the whole hamdala formula of verse 2 (Praise belongs to God, the Lord of the Worlds).150 The two formulae are a complementarity even outside the Qur'anic context since the basmala is the customary dedication which precedes the activities of the believing Muslim and the hamdala is the customary thanksgiving which succeeds them. As Shahrastani puts it (on the basis of a prophetic tradition), the two verses are 'sequential in verbal expression (lafz) and parallel in meaning (macna) ...In the Name of God is at beginnings and Praise belongs to God is at completions'.151 In this there is again a strong argument for the inclusion of the basmala in the Fatiha, for as Shahrastani explains, the evocation of praise and gratitude in the hamdala logically follows the evocation of grace and mercy in the basmala, the idea of the former being naturally predicated on the latter.152 The particular arcanum discovered by Shahrastani in the hamdala in verse 2 is a good example of how the arcana of verses assume data given under earlier headings. For previously in discussing the semantics of verse 2, he has stressed that the Arabic word hamd (praise) could mean either 'laudation' or 'thanks' depending on whether it is in response to a noble quality in the praised object or in response to a grace received from it, respectively.153 Now (in a verse already quoted, Q. 55:27) God is fundamentally attributed with both majesty and bounty. In the short section on the arcana of the hamdala, Shahrastani explains with impressive consistency that hamd in the sense of laudation is in response to God's inherent majesty and hamd in the sense of thanks is in response to His bountifulness.154 The third 'doubled one' consists of the twin titles of God from verse 2 and verse 4: 'Lord of the Worlds' (rabb al-calamln) and 'Ruler of the Day of Judgement' (mdlik yawm al-dln)}55 Shahrastani in a typically daring etymology shows inter alia that the former title may be interpreted as 'the educator of creatures', by deriving rabb from raba, 'to grow' (hence form II, rabba = 'to make grow', 'to educate') and following the Kitab al-maqayls of Ahmad ibn Faris (d. 395/1004) in interpreting calamln as each genus of creation.156 According to Shahrastani, the title 'Lord of the Worlds' pertains to creation and the herebelow, while the title 'Ruler of the Day of</page><page sequence="29">Shahrastani on the Arcana of the Qur'an: A Preliminary Evaluation 89 Judgement' pertains to the Command and the Hereafter (on the basis of proof texts such as Q. 82:19, ... the Command that Day is God's). The realm of creation concerns bodies and the corporeal, while the realm of the Command concerns spirits and the spiritual. The former is God's Realm of Omnipotence (jabarut) and the latter is His Realm of Sovereignty (malakut).151 There follows a fascinating passage in which Shahrastani discusses the intimate dependence of created things on the things from the world of the Command or the Realm of Sovereignty, an intimacy of linkage 158 which has nothing to do with the analogy of physical proximity: ... there is no existent amongst the existents of the world which He has created out of something or which He has originated ex nihilo, without there being an angel from His Realm of Sovereignty which directs it, and a Word (or Logos) which is its active agent determining it - even the rain drop from the sky falls accompanied by an angel and the mote of dust from the earth rises upwards accompanied by an angel. The two worlds are not adjacent to one another in the manner of bodies, nor do they combine intimately in the manner of bodies with shape and form. Rather they are distinct in significance and in reality ... The fourth 'doubled one' is identified with verse 3 of the Fatiha, where God is affirmed for a second time as being 'the Infinitely Merciful, the Compassionate'.159 Here return the two mercies already discussed from the basmala in verse 1. The distinct significance of these instances of mercy in verse 3, according to Shahrastani, is that they have a mediatory function, linking different realities - notably, mediating between creation (referred to by 'Lord of the Worlds' in verse 2) and the Command (referred to by 'Ruler of the Day of Judgement' in verse 4). It is noteworthy in this hermeneutic that notwithstanding its seeming obscurity, it is typically attentive to the literal form of the text of the sura, finding intrinsic rationale in it and indeed, a direct correspondence with the structure of higher reality. The fifth 'doubled one' is then identified with the two affirmations of verse 5, It is You we worship and it is You we ask for help.160 In accordance with the trend to introduce his higher hermeneutical concepts in the arcana, Shahrastani analyses these propositions in terms of the inchoative/accomplished distinction. It is You we worship implicitly affirms not only the acceptance of God's commandment but also the human subject's ability to act freely to acquire merit or demerit in response to it. The first half of verse 5 is therefore, for Shahrastani, an implicit negation of unqualified necessitarianism and an acknowledgement of the dimension of the inchoative. On the other hand it is You we ask for help affirms the dependence on divine assistance which is an implicit negation of unqualified libertarianism and an acknowledgement of the dimension of the accomplished.161</page><page sequence="30">90 Journal of Qur'anic Studies Shahrastani here draws attention to the verse's orthographic details in an ingenious example of what has been earlier called his 'positivistic' vein of scriptural mysticism. There are, he says, two great moments at which divine light is received. The first is a reception of it by beings upon their existentiation (cinda al-ibdac wa'l takwln) by God and the second is a reception of it by hearts upon their submission (cinda al-tdca wa'l-tasllm) to God.162 Then, just as existentiation is brought about through contact with the letters kdf and niin (i.e. kun, 'Be!', the divine creative fiat mentioned in Q. 16:40 etc.), likewise submission is in turn brought about through contact with the very same letters. For verse 5 of the Fatiha is nothing less than the enactment of this submission of the believer to God, and two letters in it are shown to be of particular significance: kdf and nun. To recall the Arabic form of the verse: iyyaka nacbudu wa-iyyaka nastaclnu. Shahrastani explains that the second person singular pronominal suffix -ka ('You', as in it is You ...), known as the kdf al-khitdb, grammatically suggests the direct confrontation with or witnessing of the one addressed - it implies that its referent is actually present to the speaker in some way. Next, he proposes that the inflexion of the first person plural of the imperfect na ('we', as in ... we worship and ... we ask for help) implies the free capacity of the speaker to act.163 Thus the kdfmd the niin of verse 5 amount to the fulfilment of the criteria for the reception of the cardiac light: acknowledgement of the divine object and free self-submission to it. In sum, in this strikingly ingenious hermeneutic, the two eruptions of light from God are both found to be triggered by the letters kdfmd niin. Verse 5 is pivotal in the Fatiha according to Shahrastani. It marks a turning point in the sura whose earlier verses are to do with 'declaration' (tacrlf) i.e. of truths about God; and whose later verses are to do with 'entrustment' (takllf) i.e. of functions to God on behalf of the worshipper. This is in accordance with the famous hadith qudsl (divine saying): T divide the ritual prayer between Me and My worshipper into two halves ...\164 A pattern appropriate to the pivotal status of verse 5 is discovered in it by Shahrastani. He claims that it implicitly retraces the same sequence of divine names as found in the verse which opens the first half of the Fatiha, i.e. the basmala: In the Name of God (Allah), the Infinitely Merciful (al-rahmdn), the Compassionate (al-rahim). Through this perfect mirroring of the basmala it in effect brackets together verses 1-5 and indicates that they are a kind of unity. The premise of Shahrastanl's interpretation here is that dependence on God in the statement It is You we ask for help is in regard to two things: help simpliciter and help qua guidance. Thus verse 5 refers (1) to Allah in the statement It is You Whom we worship, given that the name Allah betokens the deservingness of being worshipped; (2) to al rahmdn in the request for help simpliciter in the statement It is You we ask for help, given that the name al-rahmdn betokens the deservingness of being asked for help (e.g. Q. 21:112, Our Lord is al-rahmdn, the One sought for help (al-mustacan)); (3) to al-rahlm in the request for guidance in the same statement It is You we ask for</page><page sequence="31">Shahrastani on the Arcana of the Qur'an: A Preliminary Evaluation 91 help, given that the name al-rahlm betokens the deservingness of being asked for guidance (e.g. Q. 7:52, [The scripture is] a guidance and a mercy, (hudan wa rahmatan), for a people who believe)}65 The discussion of the arcana of verses 6 and 7 is unusually long and makes full use of Shahrastani's major hermeneutical concepts to elucidate the verses from a number of different viewpoints. The main complementarity used, however, is hierarchy/contrariety, which powerfully informs the entire remainder of the Fatiha, if Shahrastani is to be believed. To begin with, hierarchy characterises the relationship of the statement of verse 6, Guide us on the straight path and the statement of verse 7, The path of those You have graciously favoured, since according to Shahrastani the former expresses the condition of the seekers of guidance and in the latter the 'graciously favoured' are the guides who are above them.166 Inter alia the seekers are said to belong to the dimension of the inchoative while the guides (be they prophets or imams) are said to belong to the dimension of the accomplished.167 Next, contrariety is understood to be involved between these two groups on one side and on the other the two groups mentioned in the rest of verse 7, Not those against whom is Your wrath nor those who go astray. These are in fact in an infernal equivalent of the same ordered relation - carefully described by Shahrastani as a disparity (tafawuf) rather than a hierarchy (tarattub) - for the equivalent of the 'guides' here are the vessels of divine wrath mentioned in the verse, while the equivalent of the 'seekers' subordinate to them are 'those who go astray'.168 These two pairs (guides and guided, and their two opposites)169 respectively constitute according to Shahrastani the sixth and seventh 'doubled one',170 concluding the entire series and completing the explanation of the deepest significance of the Fatiha's epithet 'The Seven Doubled Ones' (sabc min al mathdnl). The whole series of mardudat is therefore as follows: (1) The basmala and hamdala (verses 1 and 2); (2) The two kinds of mercy represented by the names al-rahmdn and al-rahlm in the basmala (verse 1); (3) 'The Lord of the Worlds' = creation (verse 2), 'the Ruler of the Day of Judgement' = the Command (verse 4); (4) The mediatory versions of the basmala's two kinds of mercy (verse 3), mediating between creation and the Command, as represented by verse 2 and verse 4; (5) The two affirmations (verse 5): It is You we worship = inchoative; it is You we ask for help = accomplished; (6) Guide us on the straight path, the path of those You have graciously favoured = hierarchy of guided and guides, respectively (verses 6 and 7);</page><page sequence="32">92 Journal of Qur'anic Studies (7) Not those against whom is Your wrath, nor those who go astray = infernal guides and guided respectively, in contrariety with (6) (verse 7). Conclusion While the Mafdtih is clearly a very valuable addition to the gathering evidence for the major role of Ismacili Shfism within Shahrastanl's overall thought, it also suggests that the paradigm of eclecticism fits him better than that of prudent dissimulation. Notwithstanding the fact that the more unusual and esoteric aspects of his introduction and commentary on the Fatiha have been the focus of the above study, it should be borne in mind that there are many straightforwardly Sunni elements in the Mafdtih. Written as it was in the relative obscurity of the author's retirement, there seems little reason to doubt the basic sincerity of these elements. Yet aside from the sad incompletion of the tafsir, it is not hard to see why it was kept at arm's length and so neglected that only the precious unicum in the Library of the National Consultative Assembly in Tehran remains. It adumbrates a perspective of extraordinary intellectual daring, controversy and subtlety on Islam's holy scripture. This is very clear, for example, in the 'problematic' of the discussion of the cUthmanic canonisation project. The discussion in question however, provides the mainstay of Shahrastanl's scriptural hermeneutics: in general, that the Qur'an is only truly accessible through combining the textus receptus and the authoritative interpretations of the ahl al-bayt, and in particular, that the higher meanings of the text are only guaranteed through their teaching. That said, when the author's ta?wil is carefully investigated, he appears to operate as a remarkably independent hermeneut, taking over the principles which he believed to derive from the Prophet's lineage and applying them with great freedom and individual ingenuity. What seems to confront the modern reader of the asrdr sections of his commentary is nothing less than a coherent, fully elaborated philosophy of the Qur'an, a twelfth century 'semantic logic' of Islam's revelation. While it is a tragedy that so little of the author's total project is available for us to study, this article is only based on the first of several volumes of Adharshab's edition in progress. The forthcoming volumes, covering Shahrastanl's commentary on Siirat al-Baqara, are eagerly awaited for a fuller view of his complex and extremely profound hermeneutic.

Madelung and Mayer, Struggling with the Philosopher, p. 43 (English) and p. 41 (Arabic). Shahrastani argues for God's oneness on very similar grounds: '"Oneness" is applied to God (Exalted is He) and to existents purely equivocally (bi'l-ishtirak al-mahd). He is one unlike the "ones" mentioned - one such that the two opposites, unity and multiplicity, both emanate from Him, one in the sense that He brings things that are "one" into existence. He was unique in unicity, then He made it overflow on His creation. Unity and existence belong to Him without an opposite opposing Him or a rival comparing with Him, "And do not knowingly set up rivals for God!'"

In his Masdric al musdric in which he tries to refute Shahrastanl's critique of Ibn Slna in the Musdraca, TusI identifies Shahrastanl's claim that God must be elevated above all ranks and contraries, as the teaching of the Nizaris (madhhab al-tacllmiyyin), which he decries as 'akin to the talk of preachers and poets' (yushbihu kalam al-khutabd7 wa'l-sh^ard').

Later in the same work (p. 106) TusI also laments Shahrastanl's overlooking crucial details of the system taught him by the Ismacllls in his attack on Ibn Sina, namely the twin principles of contrariety and hierarchy (tadddd wa-tarattub). These will be spoken of below in connection with the Mafdtih, in which they play a large role. 30 See Pierluigi Donini, 'The History of the Concept of Eclecticism' in J.M. Dillon and A.A.

Shahrastani, Mafatih, vol. 1, p. 183. The possibility that a cyclical concept of time is discreetly being alluded to here is supported by a mysterious statement in the author's preamble in which he praises God in that He has concluded prophecy with 'the Chosen One' Muhammad, 'conclusion in the sense of utmost degree and perfection, not conclusion in the sense of abatement and passing away'. See pp. 103-4. The implicit reference is to Q. 33:40 where Muhammad is spoken of as the 'Seal of the Prophets' (khdtim al-nabiyln), a designation which Shahrastani here seems to take in terms of the perfection (kamdl) of prophethood through the latter, not its passing away (zawal) through him. While the definite interpretation of the author's expressions is admittedly hard, if cyclicity is indeed alluded to in them, it is further evidence for probable IsmacIli influence.

Again: '[The basmala] is definitely part of the Fatiha ... The proof of that is the authentic reports which we transmit and the mighty arcana (al-asrdr al-matlna) which we are presently occupied with mentioning.' Shahrastani, Mafatih, vol. 1, p. 223.

Evidence for this is presented later on p. 217, where Mufaddal is quoted: 'And by way of proof that ['Allah'] is not etymologically derived from a verb is the fact that it is not put in the dual and it is not pluralised ...'. 131 'Fa-dallat al-huruf allati hiya bind' al-kalima cald ma kullifa bi-macrifatihV Shahrastani, Mafatih, vol. 1, p. 215. 132 Also Shahrastani, Mafatih, vol. 1, p. 215. 133 Again Shahrastani, Mafatih, vol. 1, p. 215. 134 Shahrastani, Mafatih, vol. 1, p. 228 135 Shahrastani, Mafatih, vol. 1, p. 215. 136 Shahrastani, Mafatih, vol. 1, 215.

There may be an IsmacIlI pedigree for this item of letter mysticism. It is mentioned in the writings of Hamid al-Dln al-Kirmani in his al-Risala al-wdciza fi'l-radd cala al-Akhram al-Farghdnl, where it is presented as a blameworthy anthropomorphic teaching of the renegade Fatimid dacl al-Hasan ibn Haydara al-Akhram (d. 408/1018), whose doctrines ultimately contributed to the emergence of the Druze.

Shahrastani employs paronomasia in making the point: the fos/implies mushdhada (direct witness of the object) and the niin implies mujahada (self-exertion of the subject). 164 Tabari, Jdmic al-bayan, vol. 1, p. 66.

The infernal categories are described in terms of disparity rather than hierarchy, presumably, because the guides in this case are spiritually ranked beneath the guided. 169 It is noteworthy that the order of references to these various groups in verses 6 and 7 is, again, chiastic: Guide us on the straight path (seekers), the path of those You have graciously favoured (guides), not those against whom is Your wrath (guides), nor those who go astray (seekers). 170 Shahrastani, Mafdtih, vol. 1, p. 245, p. 250, and schema on p. 252.</page></plain_text>
