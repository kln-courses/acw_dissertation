<plain_text><page sequence="1">Strindberg's Alchemical Way of the Cross By Mary G. Hamilton In the years between 1892 and 1897, August Strindberg turned his back on the cold and unappreciative Swedish literary world. Moving from the penin sula to the continent proper, he gave up literary pursuits temporarily as he became more and more preoccupied with chemical and alchemical experi mentation. This was the period of his "Inferno crisis," during which his writings consisted solely of scientific-occult treatises like Antibarbarus, Sylva Sylvarum, "Pourquoi le fer seul indique le Nord," "Analyse spectrale," and "La distance du soleil à la terre." In August 1894, Strindberg took up residence in Paris, remaining there until the summer of 1896 when he left for Sweden and Austria. He returned to France again the next year. M. Alain Mercier, basing his work on Gunnar Brandell's Strindbergs Infernokris (Stockholm, 1950), has pointed out Strindberg's association with French al</page><page sequence="2">140 Strindberg's Alchemical Way of the Cross chemists like Jollivet-Castelot and Tiffereau, the alchemical revue L'Hyper chimie and the "Société alchimique de France."1 It was not, however, Strindberg's intellectual life alone that was affected by his obsession with alchemy, for he suffered from what Swedenborg termed alchemical "leprosy," and as a result spent from January 11 to January 31, 1895 in the Hôpital Saint-Louis being treated for severe psoriasis of the hands, induced by his experiments with sulphur.2 It is small wonder, therefore, that alchemy should play a major role in the first literary fruits of the Inferno crisis: the autobiographical novel Inferno (1897) and the play To Damascus (Parts I and II, 1898; Part III, 1900-01 ). It is the play with which we are particularly concerned here.3 Alchemy is central to To Damascus, contributing major themes, images, and structural techniques. The gold motif enters in the very first scene: the Stranger complains of poverty and meets the Beggar, who speaks to him of Polycrates' magic gold ring. From this point on, gold, and gold surrogates (for example, the money the Stranger constantly seeks) dominate the play, especially in Parts I and II. Gold is part of a complex symbolism. On the one hand, it obviously represents material gain, and hence worldly existence: this is a conventional symbolic interpretation. In this worldly aspect, gold is a chimera and a menace, "the most false of all standards,"4 as the alchemical banquet scene (Part II, Act III, Scene 1) illustrates. Renunciation of gold, therefore, represents renunciation of the material life of this world. Hence, in Part I, the Stranger throws his last copper into the brook (Scene 6); in Part II he gives up his alchemical experiments; and in Part III he gives away his silver watch. There is another side, and a paradoxical one at that, to the gold symbol. As a pure, very precious, and almost indestructible metal, gold is a symbol of all that is untainted, elevated, eternal. It is an image of the sun, and thus symbolic of divine intelligence and wisdom. The alchemist's experiments are more, therefore, than just attempts to make literal metallic gold. Indeed, one of the most common utterances of the alchemists was Aurum nostrum non est aurum vulgi.5 The search for alchemical gold is, aside from any scientific or pseudo-scientific interests, a spiritual or psychological quest: alchemy is a process symbolic of spiritual transmutation wherein the base metal of im pure, mortal man is transformed into the pure gold of the redeemed immortal; or, in psychological terms, the fragmented, undeveloped personality is trans muted into the unified, fully realized self. As a symbol of spiritual wealth, then, gold is much to be desired, and hence the alchemical pursuits of the 'Alain Mercier, "Auguste Strindberg et les alchimistes français," Revue de lit térature comparée, 43, No. 1 (jan-mars, 1969), 23-45.

Strindberg himself has pointed out the alchemical structure of To Damas cus. In a letter of March 1898, he dwells on the cyclic development of Part I: The artful point lies in the composition, which symbolizes "the Repeti tion" that Kierkegaard talks about; the action unfolds itself toward the Asylum; there it knocks against the pricks and then kicks back, the pil grimage, the turned lesson, the reiteration; and then it starts again at the same place where the playing ends and where it began. Perhaps you have not noticed how the settings unfold backwards from the Asy lum, which is the back of the book that closes itself and encloses the action. Or like a snake biting its own tail.6 The "snake biting its own tail" is the alchemical Ouroboros emblematic of the cyclic nature of the Magnum Opus which ex una primum radice procedit quae postmodum in plures res expanditur et iterum ad unam revertitur. . . .7 Although Strindberg is speaking in his letter specifically of Part I, it should be noted that repetition is important throughout the play: besides Part I, Part II especially, Part III to a certain extent, and indeed, the whole of To Damascus are based on a cyclic pattern. Part II returns in every third scene to "The 'Rose' Room" and begins Acts II, III, and IV in alchemical settings: The Laboratory and The Banqueting Hall. In the small house on the moun tain (Part III, Act III, Scene 3), the same setting and basic staging are repeated four times with variations: first with the Stranger and the Lady, his second wife, in a happy mood; then with the Stranger and the Lady in a bored mood; next with the Stranger and the Tempter; and finally with the Stranger and the Woman, his first wife. The play as a whole is a series of recurring renunciations and conversions. Although the Stranger seems to have changed at the end of Part I, Part II finds him in as big a muddle as ever. Similarly, after the conversion at the end of the second part, Part III presents a regression in the Stranger's descent of the mountain to set up house once again with the Lady. In keeping with the cyclic structure, the monastery at the end of Part III represents a return to the small church of Scenes 1 and 17 in Part I—both, it must be remembered, are Gothic; that is, of the Middle Ages, the period par excellence of the alchemist. As the circular Ouroboros suggests, alchemy is based on the philosophical premise of anthropomorphic monism, or hylozoism. This posits a single source for the whole of material reality, a prime matter or hyle in which everything exists potentially until given its own particular form. Alchemical monism is evolutionary in character. Practitioners of the Great Work hold that the vari eties of matter develop through various stages to reach their individual level in the hierarchy of life. This means, then, that everything, including metals, ®Quoted in Birgitta Steene, The Greatest Fire, Crosscurrents/Modern Critiques (Carbondale, III, 1973), p. 82. 7Emperor Heraclius, quoted by Morienus (De transmutatione metallorum), quoted in Jung, p. 293n.</page><page sequence="4">142 Strindberg's A Ichemical Way of the Cross can be transmuted to a higher, more perfect state. Metal is regarded "as a living being, which is engendered and develops in the womb of the earth, where it is subjected to various conditions, such as help or hinder its perfec tion."8 The alchemist's task is to give a speeded-up imitation of nature. Since everything has both a material and a spiritual part, it is the work of the alchemist to purify the informing "soul" and the material "body" and thus to elevate the matter so purified. As Bon. Carra de Vaux points out: In practice, the aim of the alchemist's efforts is to find the substance, a living substance, 'elixir' or spirit, which, when combined with the body of the imperfect metal, previously prepared and purified, will change it into perfect metal.9 Strindberg was a true alchemist: a monist who believed in the possibility of perfection through transmutation. In Inferno he mentions that du moment que tout le monde reconnaît l'identité de la matière, se pro clamant moniste sans l'être, je passai outre, tirant les dernières conclu sions de la doctrine, et éliminant les frontières qui séparent la matière de ce qu'on appelait l'esprit.10 This monism shows up in To Damascus where the Stranger informs the Lady that For some time I've noticed a great deal; but not as I used to. Once I merely saw objects and events, forms and colours, whilst now I per ceive ideas and meanings. (p. 27) Later he tells her, [. ..] I feel my spirit growing, spreading, becoming tenuous, infinite. I am everywhere, in the ocean which is my blood, in the rocks that are my bones, in the trees, in the flowers; and my head reaches up to the heavens. I can survey the whole universe. I am the universe. And I feel the power of the Creator within me, for I am He! I wish I could grasp the all in my hand and refashion it into something more perfect, more lasting, more beautiful. (p. 56) Thus it is that the Stranger sees himself as a liberator, a Prometheus who, in an attempt to remould her, renames the Lady Eve. Strindberg's monism also manifests itself in all the Doppelgänger found in To Damascus: the Stranger, the Beggar, the Dominican/Confessor, the Doctor, the Tempter, and Caesar are all one, just as all the women in the play are one woman, and this one woman in turn is one with the Stranger. The Mother notices the similarity between the Lady and the Stranger early in the play: "Then you're like my daughter—she, too, has no scruples and no conscience" (p. 8Bon. Carra de Vaux, "Alchemy (Muhammadan)," Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, ed. James Hastings (New York, 1910, 1967), I, 291. » Ibid. 10Inferno, p. 57.</page><page sequence="5">Strindberg's Alchemical Way of the Cross 143 68). The Stranger himself eventually notices this. "How like me you are!" he exclaims to the Lady (p. 206). She is, in Jungian terms, his anima. In his note to A Dream Play, Strindberg points out that In this dream play, as in his former dream play To Damascus, the Author has sought to reproduce the disconnected but apparently logical form of a dream. [...] The characters are split, double and multiply; they evaporate, crystallise, scatter and converge. But a single consciousness holds sway over them all—that of the dreamer.11 A word should be said about the alchemical concept of "Mercurius." It is so central to alchemy that it has supplied the art with one of its many names: "Hermetic." "Mercurius" is used by the alchemists in a wide variety of meanings, all interrelated. It refers to the chemical mercury or quicksilver, to the god Hermes, the planet Mercury, and above all to the secret means of transmutation, the elixir or philosopher's stone which is also the life force. Jung describes the various attributes of this Mercurius: [...] Mercurius is the divine winged Hermes [...] manifest in mat ter, the god of revelation, lord of thought and sovereign psychopomp. The liquid metal, argentum vivum—"living silver," quicksilver—was the wonderful substance that perfectly expressed the nature of the stilbôn; that which glistens and animates within. When the alchemist speaks of Mercurius, on the face of it he means quicksilver, but inwardly he means the world-creating spirit concealed or imprisoned in matter. The dragon [an image of Mercurius] is probably the oldest pictorial symbol in al chemy of which we have documentary evidence. It appears as the ouroboros, the tail-eater, in the Codex Marcianus [.. .] which dates from the tenth or eleventh century, together with the legend, hen to pan (the One, the All). Time and again the alchemists reiterate that the opus proceeds from the one and leads back to the one, that it is a sort of circle like a dragon biting its own tail [...]. For this reason the opus was often called circulare (circular) or else rota (the wheel) [...]. Mer curius stands at the beginning and end of the work: he is the prima materia, the caput corvi, the nigredo\ as dragon he devours himself and as dragon he dies, to rise again as the lapis. He is the play of colours in the cauda pavonis and the division into four elements. He is the herma phrodite that was in the beginning, that splits into the classical brother sister duality and is reunited in the coniunctio, to appear once again at the end in the radiant form of the lumen novum, the stone. He is metal lic yet liquid, matter yet spirit, cold yet fiery, poison and yet healing draught—a symbol uniting all opposites.12 One of the major themes of To Damascus I is that of the stations of the cross. Scenes 5 and 13, "On the Road," are dominated by "crucifixes, chapels and memorials to the victims of accidents," to the point that the Stranger refers to the setting as "this endless way of Calvaries [...]" (p. 61). In Scene 9 the Abbess tells the Stranger that he was found "on the hills above 11August Strindberg, "Author's Note" to A Dream Play in Plays, trans. Elizabeth Sprigge (Chicago, 1962), p. 521. 12Jung, pp. 292-95.</page><page sequence="6">144 Strindberg's Alchemical Way of the Cross the ravine, with a cross [he'd] broken from a calvary and with which [he was] threatening someone in the clouds" (p. 79). Scene 11 contains a particu larly important reference to the stations of the cross. Here the Mother urges the Stranger to "Go back the same way you came. Erect a cross at every station, and stay at the seventh. For you, there are not fourteen, as for Him" (p. 93). Four scenes later the Stranger tells the Lady, "[...] we'll meet at the seventh station. Where we began!" (p. 103). On a literal level, the seventh station is thus the street corner where the play started, and where it ends with this meeting that the Stranger arranges. In orthodox Catholic tradi tion, the seventh station commemorates the second of three times that Christ fell on the way to Calvary. Although this makes a certain amount of sense in that the Stranger and the Lady have returned in Scene 17 to the street corner (and, significantly, to the little Gothic church), the insistence on the fact that there are seven stations instead of the usual fourteen leads us to suspect some further meaning. We tend to agree with the Stranger when he tells the Mother, "You speak in riddles" (p. 93). Clues to the answer are given, however. Although alchemical treatises describe a confusing number and type of procedures leading to the final attainment of gold, one number that recurs frequently is the mystical/magical seven. In alchemy there are seven metals corresponding to the seven ancient planets; that is, lead (Saturn), tin (Jupi ter), copper (Venus), quicksilver (Mercury), iron (Mars), silver (Moon), and gold (Sun). Further, according to P. V. Piobb, there are seven stages in the "intrinsic" or subjective alchemical process.13 If Scene 17, the Street Corner, is the seventh station in To Damascus, and we count each scene leading up to it as one station, we find that the first is in the kitchen in Scene 11. Now the first operation in alchemy is calcination (oxidation by heat), and one of the essential pieces of equipment is the athanor, the alchemist's oven. Where better to start alchemical transmutation, then, than in the kit chen? It should be remembered that the description of the kitchen given in Scene 7 specifically mentions several other items which may be linked with alchemy: "utensils of copper, iron and tin, and wooden vessels" (p. 64). One of the meanings of hyle in Greek is "wood," and a wooden sphere cut in two often formed the nest "wherein the Philosopher's Egg may be cherished till it be hatched."14 About calcination, Piobb says: Pernéty, dans son Dictionnaire mytho-hermétique, la définit ainsi: "Puri fication ou pulvérisation des corps par le moyen du feu extérieur qui en dissout les parties en séparant ou en évaporant l'humide qui les liait."15 The alchemists saw in all bodies, including the human intellect which they treated like a chemical body, three constituent principles: active, "masculine" Sulphur, or form; passive, "feminine" Salt, or matter; and hermaphroditic 1:iPierre Vincenti Piobb, Clef Universelle des Sciences Secretes, Omnium littéraire (Paris, 1950). ,4Jean d'Espagnet ("Penes nos unda Tagi"), Hermetic Arcanum, trans.

This is the case with the Stranger in Scene 11 where, in what might be called his "dark night of the soul," he experiences the annihilation that the Mother calls "The annihilation of the Divine. We call it spiritual death" (p. 92). In the kitchen scene, the Mother says that she regrets "trying to separate" the Stranger and his wife (p. 93). As male and female, they represent the two halves of the unity that is Man. The Mother has destroyed this unity, and Scene 12, "In the Ravine," is a clear image of her work. The second operation in alchemy, according to Piobb, is putrefaction. He notes that the word was created by St. Augustine in the fourth century "pour rendre ce que nous appelons aujourd'hui 'désagrégation'."18 Putrefaction is "cette de struction de la nature ancienne, cet abandon des manières de voir qu'on avait jusqu'ici" that J. E. Cirlot, in his Dictionary of Symbols describes as "separa tion of the destroyed remains" of calcination.19 In the ravine, the Lady and the Stranger are separated and searching for each other, but kept apart by the Smith and the Miller's Wife, who refuse to help them find each other, and lie when asked for information. The fire of the Smith's forge can be seen as an image of the heat generated by putrefaction. Solution is the third operation. The word comes from the Latin solutio, meaning a loosening. It is during this stage that chez le sujet évoluant, "se décomposent," selon le latin, les éléments constitutifs de l'être, où, comme disent les Alchimistes philosophes, "l'es prit se sépare du corps," donc où l'âme, avec l'intelligence qui l'exprime, prend son essor en quittant les préoccupations gênantes qui créent les besoins corporels.20 In Scene 13, "On the Road," the Beggar, with his caged starling, emblematic of the captive soul, has some advice for the Stranger. "What's within us is nothing but pure... nonsense," he says (p. 95). He urges the Stranger to hurry on to the ocean away from the distractions of life: If you can't laugh at adversity, not even that of others, you're begging off life itself. Listen! If you follow this wheel track you'll come, at last, to the ocean, and there the path will stop. If you sit down there and rest, you'll begin to take another view of things. Here there are so many accidents, religious themes, disagreeable memories that hinder thought as it flies to the 'rose' room. Only follow the track! If it's muddy here and there, spread your wings and flutter. (p. 96; italics mine) 1 «Ibid., p. 339-40. iVbid., p. 341. ™Ibid„ p. 364. ™Ibid., p. 343; J. E. Cirlot, A Dictionary of Symbols, trans.

The snow on the ground represents both the coldness necessary for distillation and the purity that results from the alchem ical process. The isolated elements are the Lady and the Stranger who, after long separation and constant search for each other, are now "collected," brought together, but not yet truly united : The LADY re-enters, throws herself into his [the Stranger's] arms, but recoils. LADY. You thrust me away. STRANGER. No. It seems there's someone between us. LADY. Indeed there is! (p. 98) There are several references in this scene to forms of water, symbolic of the purified distillate. The setting is "By the Sea," there is snow on the ground, the Stranger speaks of the eternal water that keeps "the mill" perpetually grinding, and storm clouds are gathering at the close of the scene. At this point, two important aspects of alchemy should be mentioned. One is the use of colour symbolism, and the other the relationship of the seven planets to the process. The sign that the alchemical operations are working is colour change. Originally there were four stages, each with its respective colour mentioned in Heraclitus: melanosis or nigredo (blacken ing), leukosis or albedo (whitening), xanthosis or citrinitas (yellowing), and iosis or rubedo (reddening). About the fifteenth or sixteenth century, how ever, the colours were reduced to three, with the xanthosis seldom being mentioned. Occasionally the viriditas (greening) appears after the melanosis or nigredo.22 As the first colour, black represents the darkness and potential of chaotic prima materia, whether base metal or guilty man. White is the second stage, signifying the first transmutation and spiritual purification. Red is third and characterizes the second transmutation, into sulphur; spiritually it represents passion.23 The final colour, unmentioned in this explanation, is, of course, that of gold. Each stage with its colour change is represented in "the way of the cross" of To Damascus. The four scenes looked at so far illustrate the first two original alchemical colours, plus the viriditas. Each scene is also allied with a particular planet. The first station, "In the Kitchen," takes place in the dark of night with the play of shadows and storm clouds taking a prominent role in establishing the atmosphere. A stuffed bird of prey sits on the table. It can be connected with the caput corvi, the crow which, because of its black colour, is "associated with the idea of beginning (as expressed in such symbols as the maternal night, primigenial darkness, the fertilizing earth)."24 The cause of the eery shadows is the moon, the symbol of the feminine aspect of the hermaphroditic Mercurius, and hence of the prima materia, the womb out of which the transformed metal will eventually issue. -'iIbid., p. 346. --Jung, p. 229. -3See Jung, pp. 229-32 and Cirlot, p. 6. -4Cirlot, p. 68.</page><page sequence="9">Strindberg's Alchemical Way of the Cross 147 Scene 12, "In the Ravine," is also strongly associated with black: the smithy, as the Stranger pointed out in the first trip through the ravine, is black; the Lady is in mourning; it is fall and the trees are bare; the mood is one of despair. The planet of this scene is Saturn. The rock formations which "look like giant profiles" (p. 62) recall the period of the Titans. As Cronos, the God who ate his own children, Saturn is an ouroboros and sym bolizes the all-consuming appetite of time. The flour mill is an apt image for this aspect of Saturn. One of his emblems is the scythe, an ambiguous symbol related by its function to active destruction, and thus putrefaction, and by its crescent shape to the feminine and passive procreative principle. Hence, to the Alchemists, Saturn was an androgyne and, therefore, "Mercurius sen ex."™ There is no scythe in Scene 12, but there is a ramshorn to which the Stranger draws our attention in the earlier ravine scene (p. 63f.). It is, in all likelihood, crescent-shaped, and is by its nature and function a bisexual image: ordinarily a phallic symbol, this horn is used as a type of cup con taining ointment and has, therefore, a feminine character as well. Jung dis cusses at some length the unicorn and its horn, frequent symbols in alchemy. A very ambiguous symbol, the unicorn is an image of Mercurius. It is alexipharmic, its horn in particular having healing qualities and often being used as a cup. In this connection, Jung notes that The horn as an emblem of vigour and strength has a masculine character, but at the same time it is a cup, which, as a receptacle, is feminine. So we are dealing here with a "uniting symbol" that expresses the bipolarity of the archetype [.. . .]26 The duo of Smith and Miller's Wife in Scenes 12 and 6 further expresses the hermaphroditic nature of the alchemical Saturn. There is another important colour found in Scene 12: green. The Stranger wears a green hat that the Lady mentions in her description of him. He wears the same hat in Scene 13. Here we have a visual image of the pro gressive "ripening" or "maturing" of the Work. The planet of Scene 13 is Mars. In Scene 5 the setting for "On the Road" is described: A landscape with hills; a chapel, right, in the far distance on a rise. The road, flanked by fruit trees, winds across the background. Between the trees hills can be seen on which are crucifixes, chapels and memorials to the victims of accidents. In the foreground a sign-post with the legend, 'Beggars not allowed in this parish.' (p. 61 ) The only change in Scene 13 is that it is now autumn. For the Romans, Mars was originally a vegetation god, and thus the presence of the fruit trees in this scene. He gradually became the god of war because of the primi tive association of creation and preservation with "primordial sacrifice."27 The "crucifixes, chapels and memorials to the victims of accidents" under -''Ibid., p. 265. -"Jung, p. 471; Jung's discussion of the unicorn begins on p. 435. -'Cirlot, p. 195.</page><page sequence="10">148 Strindberg's Alchemical Way of the Cross score this bloody sacrificial side of Mars, appropriate to the separation of body and soul in "solution." In Scene 14 the colour white appears. As we mentioned, it is winter and there is snow on the ground. In the background are seen "three bare masts of a wrecked ship, that look like three white crosses" (p. 98). The first transmutation has been made, the alchemical operations are succeeding. Jupi ter is the planet of this scene, and his metal is tin (or sometimes pewter), the shiny pseudo-silver. In the earlier scene "By the Sea," the Stranger hurled defiance at the sky, whose god is Jupiter, wielder of the thunderbolt: I know I'm damned. But I'm ready to hurl the curse back at him who so nobly cursed me.... {He throws up the letter.) With a curse of my own. LADY. Don't. You frighten me. STRANGER. Fear me, so long as you don't despise me! The chal lenge has been thrown down; now you shall see a conflict between two great opponents. {He opens his coat and waistcoat and looks threaten ingly aloft.) Strike me with your lightning if you dare! Frighten me with your thunder if you can! (p. 58) In Scene 14, the sky, with its gathering storm clouds, presents the answer to the Stranger's challenge. His arrogance has left him and now he knows fear— spiritual transformation is being worked. It should be remembered that in the myth of Perseus, Zeus (the heavens) descends as a golden rain on Danae, a personification of earth. The eventual result of their union is the birth of Perseus, whose name means Persian, that is, magos to the Greeks.28 The magos is the illuminated or transformed man. The fifth alchemical operation is conjunction, union, the joining of oppo sites represented archetypically by the hieros gamos or "chymical wedding." In Scene 15 the Lady and the Stranger are re-united in the "Room in an Hotel." The male and female principles have become one. The second trans mutation has been achieved, for red is the colour linked with this setting: we are reminded of the scenes in the "Rose" Room, the Christmas rose and blood are mentioned, and the Stranger suggests dyeing the Lady's crochet work rose red. This is the stage of changeable passion, whether spiritual or physical, and is not the final stage of pure immutability. The Lady and the Stranger are in a hotel room, a temporary residence, not a permanent home, and although they are reunited, they are not happy: the Stranger has night mares, and, as he confesses to the Lady, "I've nothing but unpleasant things to say, since we came here" (p. 100). Further purification is necessary, since, like the Lady's crochet work, their union has become "soiled in the making" (p. 102). Both works can be "washed," however, and so the Stranger leaves the Lady temporarily to go on to the sixth station of the cross. The planet of Scene 15 is Venus, goddess of love, and her metal copper, -"Piobb, Vol. II, 347-48.</page><page sequence="11">Strindbergs Alchemical Way of the Cross 149 the red metal. This is the fifth station, and Strindberg links the rose with the number five, as well as with the planet Venus: La reine des fleurs, la Sainte Rose, la sauvage à corolle simple est bâtie sur le nombre 5. Cinq est le nombre de la perfection; d'après la Kabbale, le nombre de la sensualité (les cinq sens). Les cinq pétales de la corolle sont attachés sur le calice en pente as cendante, formant une spirale. Donc la fleur monte en hélice comme le soleil et le système planétaire est supposé se mouvoir vers le centre in connu (Swedenborg). Les cinq pétales triangulaires fixés au cercle du périanthe constituent un pentagone régulier, figure parfaite qui renferme de hauts mystères. Les lignes diagonales du pentagone tracent l'image du pentagrammé ou du pentalfa (les cinq alfa) le signe sacré de l'exorciste, qui a doué la Rose de forces occultes, gardées dans les couronnes nuptiales et funèbres, portées par les filles d'honneur de l'épouse, déposées sur les tombeaux afin de repousser les puissances infernales. [...] Le pentagone a résolu le problème de la trisection de l'angle, puisque les lignes diagonales partagent les coins en trois parties égales, chacune de 36 degrés, le coin du pentagone en occupant 108. Or, voici le nombre 108 qui appartient à la planète Vénus, nombre emprunté au ciel, comme la Rose a été dédiée à Vénus, la déesse de l'amour et de la beauté. A Vénus donc la Rose avec la beauté, le parfum et l'épine. Le Rosier, svelte comme un jonc, aux verges souples, aux piquants comme les dents du brochet; tu ne romps pas la fleur sans avoir les mains ensanglantées; tu mets la hache à la racine, et le buisson repousse, reverdit, refleurit; il méprise le feu et revient de ses propres cendres; il se plaît aux bords poussiéreux du chemin, il aime le sol pierreux, pourvu que l'air et le soleil lui soient fournis, à cette fleur d'amour miraculeuse. [....] La rose, teintée du sang d'Adonis, désire le sang. Sensible et cruelle, elle fait tomber les pétales au plus léger attouchement. Elle ne peut pas souffrir, mais elle apporte secours aux souffrants. Regardez le buisson, en automne, privé de fleurs et de feuilles! Rouge comme le feu, il porte sur chaque brindille une amphore à cinq anses, rouge cornaline, ou mieux une urne lacrymatoire. C'est ce que l'on a nommé Signatura rerum, l'indication de la nature qu'il s'y cache des forces guérisseuses.29 The rose, then, like so many of the symbols related to alchemy, is a very complex image. On the one hand, it is associated with the world of the flesh, with sensuality, with violence and death. On the other, it is linked with the world of the spirit, transcendent love, beauty, and salvation. In To Damascus, the Stranger's explanation of the meaning of the "Christmas rose" underlines the dual nature of this image: "the Christmas rose you're wearing is a man dragora. Its symbolical meaning is malice and calumny; but it was once used in medicine for the healing of madness" (p. 34). When the Stranger leaves the Lady and moves on to "The Doctor's House" in Scene 16, he is subjecting his love to sublimation, the sixth alchemical 29Auguste Strindberg, "Rosa Mystica," Rosa Alchemica, No. 11 (Nov., 1902), pp. 354-56.</page><page sequence="12">150 Strindberg's Alchemical Way of the Cross operation. The elevation of physical love to the spiritual plane is not, how ever, easily achieved. Sublimation, or "mystic detachment from the world,"30 is closely associated with suffering, and frequently represented by the Prome theus myth in which a winged creature, emblem of flight to sublime heights, devours the entrails of the one who would deify man. The Stranger recognizes the difficulties inherent in the sublimation process but decides to proceed nonetheless: I want to risk everything—life, freedom, welfare. I need an emotional shock, strong enough to bring myself into the light of day. I demand this torture, that my punishment may be in just proportion to my sin, so that I shall not be forced to drag myself along under the burden of my guilt. So down I go into the snake pit, as soon as may be!" (p. 102) The Doctor is only too willing to help the Stranger suffer. There is mention of cutting off the Stranger's head, or heaping coals of fire on it. The Doctor even speaks of his own revenge as a curative for the Stranger. It will hearten him, lift the burden off him (p. 104). As a medical man, the Doctor is a personification of Mercury, one of whose symbols is the caduceus, the wand with entwined snakes that serves as the emblem of the medical profession. The Stranger's reference to the snake pit in the preceding scene establishes this image in our minds even before we meet the Doctor in Scene 16. There are other connections between the Doctor and Mercury in this scene. One is the tortoise by the well (p. 41 ) : Mercury invented the Lyre from a tortoise or turtle shell. As a primaeval creature, the tortoise, like the snake, is asso ciated with chthonic forces and is thus an image of the prima materia, one of the aspects of Mercurius. It is also an alchemical utensil, the testudo or shallow bowl used as a cover for cooking pots.31 The androgynous nature of Mercurius is alluded to in Scenes 2 and 16 through the presence of the Doctor's Sister, a character who appears only in these two scenes. Herma phroditic Mercurius is frequently portrayed as a union of brother and sister, an image for the union of two proceeding from one and returning to one. It is significant that we find Mercurius at the sixth station of the cross, for if we remember, we found him also at the first in the role of prima materia. We have, then, another Ouroboros, and since "Mercurius stands at the begin ning and end of the work," the alchemical transmutation is all but complete. There remains only the final operation, philosophical coagulation, the seventh station of the cross. This is the "réunion inséparable du fixe et du volatif [j/c] en une masse si fixe qu'elle ne craint point les atteintes du feu le plus violent [ ]32 This occurs in Scene 17 at the street corner where the Stranger and the Lady meet again. This time their union is spiritual, as well as physical or social, for the Lady persuades the Stranger that he must have faith, that he must believe. He agrees to try, and as a first step goes to fetch the letter which has been in the Post Office since Scene 1. The alchemical process has succeeded: the Stranger finds that the letter contains the money he has been waiting for. As the station of gold and enlightenment, 30Cirlot, p. 6. 31 Jung, p. 157n. 3-Piobb, Vol. II, 357.</page><page sequence="13">Strindberg's Alchemical Way of the Cross 151 this final scene belongs to the planet of illumination, the Sun. It is important that the money should have been in the Post Office all along, for alchemy merely discovers the gold that has always been hidden in the base metal. Encouraged by the results of his first act of faith, the Stranger makes a second though tentative one and accompanies the Lady to the door of the church where he will perhaps find the spiritual gold he seeks. This is what the Lady hopes for in lighting a candle to Saint Elizabeth, patron of the poor and needy. Her votive offering is given both in thanksgiving, and in supplication. Alchemical imagery and symbolism are not, of course, limited to Part I of To Damascus. On the contrary, they are very evident in Part II where they play an important role from the opening scene onwards. The Stranger speaks of the Lady: "Her talent for making me suffer excels my most infernal inventions; and if I escape from her hands with my life, I'll come out of the fire as pure as gold" (p. 121). This is the Stranger's answer to the Lady's lament at the close of Part I: "All these sufferings, all these tears... in vain!" (p. 108). They are not in vain, for salvation is the result. The way of the cross, purification, spiritual transformation are not meant to be easy. The Stranger's laboratory experimentation is the most obvious instance of alchemy in the play. It is particularly significant that in searching for al chemical gold and in building his "mousetrap" to "neutralize" the "Powers," the Stranger is involved in electrical experiments. The nineteenth-century adept Eliphas Lévi attributed to electricity a central role in the alchemical process. Basing his theory on readings in the Kabbala, Lévi came to the conclusion that in alchemy 1° Les quatre fluides impondérables ne sont que les manifesta tions diverses d'un même agent universel qui est la lumière. 2° La lumière est le feu qui sert au grand oeuvre sous forme d'élec tricité. 3° La volonté humaine dirige la lumière vitale au moyen de l'appareil nerveux. Cela s'appelle de nos jours magnétiser. 4° L'agent secret du grand ouevre, l'azoth des sages, l'or vivant et vivifiant des philosophes, l'agent producteur métallique universel, c'est l'ELECTRICITE MAGNETISEE.33 Lévi would thus relate the joining of opposites in alchemical conjunction and the hermaphrodite to magnetic polarization. It is interesting to note in passing that the metallic element mercury is used in various types of electrical equipment, including certain switches, lamps, and arcs, and that copper is a particularly good conductor of electricity. Although the alchemical imagery is most obvious in Part II, it is found again in the last Part of To Damascus, especially in the second act scene at the "Cross-Roads in the Mountains," where the Confessor poses riddles about copper, sulphur, and mercury, and the Stranger encounters Maia, the nurse in his "first family." Part III also introduces the Jupiter-like figure of the Prior. We should not forget that in mythology Maia was the mother and Zeus/Jupiter the father of Hermes/Mercury. 33Eliphas Lévi, La Clef des Grands Mystères (Paris, n.d.), pp. 206-07; see also pp. 212-13, 233-35.</page><page sequence="14">152 Strindberg's Alchemical Way of the Cross This scene in Part III is not the first to take place at a cross-road. The first and last scenes in Part I are located, as we have seen, at a "Street Corner," simply a cross-road by another name. The Stranger draws our attention to an important aspect of this particular setting. He and the Lady are back where they began "at the street corner, between the inn, the church and the post office" (p. 107). Each of these buildings represents a different way of life, a different road to Damascus, and can, therefore, be seen as emblems of the three separate parts of the play. Part I is associated with the little Gothic church. It contains among other things a convent-asylum, an occult way of the cross, and an illicit love affair. This is the private road to Damascus, the hidden path of the "feminine" soul, received revelation, and passive faith. In Part I, the Stranger is more worked upon than work ing: he is constantly led by the Lady and prodded by the Beggar, the Mother, the Doctor, et al. Part II is symbolized by the inn and its replacement, the Banqueting Hall. Here we have the public road to Damascus. The return in every third scene to the "Rose" Room emphasizes the significance of the Lady: she is no longer, however, a mistress, but has become a wife and mother—she has acquired an acceptable social character. The role of alchemy has also changed since Part I. The spiritual quest has largely given way to the search for fame and fortune. The stations of the cross have been replaced by the laboratory. Part II, with its final scene in the "Rose" Room, presents the way of the "mascu line" body and active science. The Post Office of Part I heralds the way of Part III. As messenger of the Olympians, Mercury is god of communications, and emblem of postal and telegraphic services. Communications of a particular kind play an inter esting role in the last part of the drama: the monks have little need to speak aloud because they have developed the ability to "converse" tele pathically. The Prior's perception is so keen that he "can feel if anyone's thoughts have strayed into wrong paths. In some respects he's like—merely like, I say—a telephone engineer's galvanometer, that shows when and where a current has been interrupted" (p. 270). Mercury's relationship to Part III is not simply in the sphere of communications, however, for his hermaphro ditic nature represents the composite road to Damascus suggested in this section of the play. (The two-headed portraits in the monastery Picture Gallery present a visual image of duality right within Part III.) Although the Stranger eventually retires to the seclusion of the mountain-top monastery, and thus to a private mode of existence, he does descend the mountain for a while to resume his social way of life with the Lady, his wife. The mona stery itself is "not merely a religious foundation," but "a monument of Western culture. That is to say: Christian faith wedded to the knowledge of Hellas and Rome" (p. 269). Besides religion, the monastery "embraces all the arts and sciences" including as it does a library, museum, observatory, laboratory, hospital (complete with sulphur springs), agricultural and horti cultural facilities. Part III, where great emphasis is placed on the Hegelian dialectic, is the path of the intellect: a synthesis of passive faith (represented by the guidance of the Confessor), and active inquiry (represented by the arduous climb up the mountain). The conversions of Parts I and II are unsuccessful because the way of life they designate is only half of what is</page><page sequence="15">Strindberg's Alchemical Way of the Cross 153 necessary to the complete individual. The true union of opposites takes place only in Part III. This, then, is the final "conjunction," the ultimate "philo sophical coagulation" in the alchemical process of Strindberg's To Damascus.
