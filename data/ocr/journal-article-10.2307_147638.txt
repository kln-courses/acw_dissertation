<plain_text><page sequence="1">A SANCTUARY AND CEMETERY IN WESTERN CORINTH (PLATES 1-1 1) R ECENT investigations at Corinth have brought to light evidence which points to the existence of important architectural monuments and a cemetery of the classical period in the western part of the ancient city. The precise location of the structures and the limits of the cemetery cannot as yet be established; and we can hardly expect additional information except as the result of chance finds. For this reason, and because of the historical and topographical interest of the new discoveries, it has seemed worthwhile to present the limited evidence now at our disposal. In 1962 the American School of Classical Studies began the investigation of a large system of water tunnels and cisterns in the area popularly known as Anaploga (or Anapnoa), near the church and settlement of Haghioi Anargyroi, some 1000 meters southwest of the ancient Agora of Corinth.' Here has been exposed a long underground water supply tunnel; it brought water from some point at the southeast (possibly the ancient source now known by the Turkish name Hadji Mustapha 2) toward a small and fertile valley at the northwest, where the water was presumably used for irrigation (Fig. 1).' The tunnel has been traced over a distance of more than 600 meters; manholes (nos. 1-5, 6, 9, 12-14) occur generally at intervals of approximately 60 meters.4 Some of the water which flowed down this tunnel was diverted into at least two subsidiary tunnel cisterns (manholes 1-11 and 3-7-8-10), one collecting shaft (manhole 9-A) and one well (well 2).5 The two cisterns have a I In times both of physical absence from Corinth and of physical disability, I was assisted in the excavation by my wife and by Mr. Charles K. Williams. Mr. Williams has advised me extensively on architectural problems and has prepared almost all the drawings. I have profited much from discussions of the ceramic remains with Mrs. Judith Perlzweig Binder and Professor G. Roger Edwards. Brief notices of the excavations have appeared in: B.C.H., LXXXVII, 1963, pp. 725-726; LXXXVIII, 1964, pp. 703-705, figs. 6-11; XC, 1966, pp. 754-756, fig. 10; Archaeological Reports (Soc. for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies), 1962-63, p. 11; 1963-64, p. 7; 1965-66, pp. 6-7, fig. 6; AeXr., XVIII, 1963, Xpomca6, pp. 78-79; XIX, 1964, XpovtKa, pp. 100-101, pls. 105, b, 106-108. 2 P.

Its shaft happens to lie tangent to the tunnel, between manholes 1 and 2, but it had no functional connection with the tunnel.

Parts of this vast system went out of use in the late 4th century B.C., part at the time of the sack of Corinth by Mummius. The southeastern section seems to have been kept in use as a cistern in Roman times, when the flow of water was blocked by a barrier wall just west of manhole 12. The portion of the system with which I am here concerned is the cistern consisting of manholes 3, 7, 8, and 10 and of the stuccoed tunnel connecting them (P1. 1). At manhole 3 the floor of the main tunnel lies at 98.84 m. above sea level.6 On the southwest side of the man- hole shaft a secondary tunnel opens out. This extends 41.60 m. toward the southwest to manhole 7; 43.12 m. further on lies the principal manhole, no. 8; the distance from manhole 8 to no. 10 is 42.00 m.; beyond manhole 10 the tunnel extends a further 13.31 m. and then terminates in a dead end.7 The levels of the tunnel floor between manholes 3 and 10 are indicated in Plate 1.8 The highest point in the cistern is at manhole 3, the lowest at manhole 10; beyond that manhole the cistern floor rises slightly. The drop in level of the tunnel floor from manhole 3 to 7 is steep (about 1 in 30); further toward the southwest the slope is much less pronounced (1 in 100 between manholes 7 and 8, 1 in 70 between manholes 8 and 10). Whereas in the main tunnel the walls are stuccoed generally to a height of only 0.40-0.50 m. above the floor, in the tunnel leading southwest from manhole 3 the stucco on the walls rises to a much higher and uniform level. From a point 12.50 m. beyond manhole 3 the walls to their full height and the roof of the tunnel are completely covered with water- proof stucco. At manhole 7 the stucco rises within the shaft to a maximum level of 99.41 m. above sea level. At a point about 25.40 m. southwest of manhole 7 the roof of the tunnel rises suddenly and from there slopes up very slightly toward manhole 8; from this point to manhole 8 and for 20.35 m. beyond 8 the tunnel walls are 6 At the bottom of the manhole shaft is a settling basin 0.40 m. deep below the tunnel floor. 7At the extreme southwestern limit of the tunnel a hole appears in the stuccoed end-wall; this hole reveals that, whereas the tunnel is cut in its entirety through hard rock, the barrier which closes the system beyond manhole 10 is a wall constructed of clay. Piercing through this wall we were able to see into another stuccoed tunnel cistern extending off for a distance of about 4.00 m. on a line 160 south of west toward a manhole blocked with earth fill. It appears probable that the further cistern is earlier than that with which we are dealing and that when our cistern was constructed the miners by chance broke through into the earlier tunnel and then built a wall of clay, stuccoed on the east side, to separate the new cistern from the old. 8 In general our cleaning of the tunnels extended only two to three meters in each direction beyond the manhole shafts. The earth which had fallen into the manholes usually spread out for a distance of several meters into the tunnels. This fill was removed far enough to enable us to measure the level of the tunnel floor adjacent to the manholes and to permit our passage, over the mud (and occasionally fallen rock) which covered the entire length of the tunnel floor, from one manhole to another. For this reason the line of the tunnel floor as indicated on Plate 1 is restored hypothetically from one to another of the successive measurements taken close to the manholes. 9 This offset in the tunnel roof and the similar one between manholes 8 and 10 are probably due to an error on the part of the workmen who dug the manholes and tunnels. One may reason- ably assume that in digging manhole 8 (at a point where the starting ground level was some three</page><page sequence="4">4 HENRY S. ROBINSON stuccoed to a height of only about 1.90 m. (i.e., to a maximum level of 98.93 m. above sea level); the upper part of the walls and the roof were left without stucco. From 20.35 m. beyond manhole 8, where the tunnel roof drops down about 0.50 m., the walls to their full height and the roof of the tunnel are again covered with stucco. At manhole 10 the stucco rises in the shaft to about 98.30 m. above sea level. The section on Plate 1 shows very effectively that so long as any water flowed in the main tunnel at a level sufficient to rise above the barrier between manhole 3 and the tunnel leading to manhole 7, the tunnel cistern would receive a regular water supply and theoretically could be filled to the level of the top of that barrier (ca. 99.00 m. above sea level). The tunnel is generally 0.50-0.60 m. wide and (except for the sections immediately adjacent to manhole 8) 1.50-1.60 m. high. We may estimate that the cistern, when full, could hold about 100 cubic meters of water (ca. 26,400 gallons). The three manholes which served for the drawing of water (7, 8, 10) may have served as many different households or industrial establishments.'0 We have, of course, no means of ascertaining the normal daily consumnption of water per person in classical times; but considering the sanitary conditions of the private houses in the Greek period we may perhaps estimate a maximum of 5 gallons per day per person. If we further assume that a single household may have consisted of twelve persons (free and slave), it will appear probable that the tunnel cistern, once filled, could have provided water for the entire needs of three households over a period of over five months; and since the water presumably ran in the tunnel and replenished the cistern through all but the hottest summer months, we can visualize that the cistern could have supplied quite adequately all the needs of each household using its manholes for the full twelve monthis of any year of normal rainfall. The date of construction of this cistern cannot be determined with precision. That portions of it went out of use shortly after the end of the 4th century B.C. iS clear; that it served for only a brief period of years is unlikely in view of the magni- tude of the whole hydraulic installation of which the cistern is a part." There is no mneters above that at manhole 7 and about four and a half meters below that at manhole 10) the miners failed initially to excavate the shaft deep enough; the tunnels leading off in both directions thus had insufficient depth, when united with the tunnels coming in from manholes 7 and 10, to provide the slope needed for draining the water supply southwestward. Under these circum- stances the natural solution was to deepen manhole 8 and the tunnels leading toward 7 and 10 until the necessary slope was obtained. 10 In the sixth century B.C. a potter's kiln existed in this general area; wasters from it found their way into a well-shaft located some 260 meters east of manhole 3. A few meters to the north of that well have been found remains of what was probably a fulling establishment. Well and fullona were both excavated in 1962 (B.C.H., LXXXVII, 1963, p. 726; AcXr., XVIII, 1963, XpovtKa, p. 79). "Unless some irreparable damage had occurred in the system (of which there is no indica- tion), or unless the water supply upon which the system drew was in some way altered (which seems improbable in view of the fact, noted above, that parts of the main tunnel continued to serve an hydraulic function into early Roman times).</page><page sequence="5">A SANCTUARY AND CEMETERY IN WESTERN CORINTH 5 reason to suppose that the system antedates the 4th century. It is possible that after the tunnel cistern ceased to function, the water supply for the area was provided from a large chamber cistern located near manhole 1. This cistern, dug into solid rock only a meter or two below the surface, is not connected in any way with the tunnel system. Its capacity is about two and one half times that of the tunnel cistern. For the chamber cistern a date of construction is provided by potsherds included in the earth filling thrown into a long rock-cut trench after the covered cistern-drain had been laid in the floor of the trench. This pottery is to be dated in the 3rd century B.C. (LOT 1113).12 All of the three manholes of our tunnel cistern (7, 8, 10) are oval in plan (no. 8 is about 2.15 m. x 0.70 m.; no. 10 is about 1.80 m. x 0.90 mi.; no. 7 is about 1.15 m. x 0.65 m.; the dimensions of all vary from one level to another within a single shaft as a result of changes in the degree of hardness and in the character of the rock through which the shafts have been sunk); they are provided with foot-holds cut into the long sides of the shaft and at vertical intervals of about 0.50 m. All three manholes must have been kept open anid accessible at all times; 1 only manhole 8, however, retains traces of any cuttings on the rock surface around the mouth (Fig. 2). The several channels and two settling basins there exposed are shallow, irregularly cut and without stucco coating; they appear to have been designed to carry water away from the manhole and may at one time have had some connection with the stuccoed basin or watering trough found near the bottom of the manhole (see below, No. 15). East of manhole 8, and tangent to settling basin 1, appear quarry cuttings which presumably antedate the manhole and the surface channels near its mouth (P1. 11, a-b). The channels have not been investigated further from the manhole mouth than is indicated in the plan, Figure 2. The three manholes of the cistern seem all to have gone out of use at the end of the 4th century or in the early 3rd century B.C.14 The occasion for the abandonment cannot be ascertained, but it may have been associated with the disturbances resulting from the rivalries of the immediate successors of Alexander over control of the Greek 12 See AEXT., XVIII, 1963, XpOVLK', p. 79; B.C.H., LXXXVII, 1963, p. 726. For the system of pottery storage at Corinth by LOTS, see Hesperia, XXXI, 1962, p. 100, note 7. 13 Most of the manholes of the main tunnel (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, 14) seem to have been for service use only and were generally kept covered. Manhole 1 was regularly open; in the rock around its mouth are cuttings for the supports of a windlass. 14 To this date belong the amphorae, almost complete, found at the bottom of manholes 7 and 8. We must imagine that after the fall of these amphorae the cistern was not again in regular use. Ancient cisterns, as those used in modern times on the Greek islands, must have been cleaned out each fall just before the anticipated autumn rains. Such cleaning would have involved complete drainage (by bailing), washing down of the cistern walls and floor, and a second drainage. That the broken amphorae were not removed in the fall of the year they were dropped into the shaft indicates that regular use and maintenance of the cistern had terminated.</page><page sequence="6">0\ /--t _ "' ,,,, ~~~~+ tl.s BASIN I R t@$t*#*tt121lttsF18@|wl@st$$t~~~M t I@ t 8 t t$82* t Itt II s? #|t* so* I it c ttatttlt4 J 01 /&lt;iASIN !2X " / // f ll /l6.9.

The cistern went out of use and into its manholes were thrown many objects whose rejection suggests at least partial abandonment of the public or private buildings near by; the many fragments of architecture (see the catalogue below, Nos. 14, 15, 25, 40, 41, 45, 46, 51, 66, 67, 68) must have been violently shifted from their original position, for some of them (Nos. 14, 15, 51) went into the manholes with the earliest filling; others perhaps lay about on the surface of the ground, in the debris of ruined structures, to be thrown from time to time down into the manhole shafts which were gradually filling with rubbish. The numerous cippi (Nos. 26, 27, 28, 38, 39, 52, 53, 56, 57, 59, 69, 70, 71) must be interpreted as markers: for graves, for boundaries of fields, for horoi of sacred areas. That they, too, were cast away into the shafts indicates that respect for and need for these markers had ceased (nos. 52, 53, 56 and 57 were discarded into manhole 10 in the early part of the 3rd century). Two of the cippi which are of sculptural form (Nos. 38, 39) in all probability marked graves; " others, which are of architectonic character, were probably termini, horos-stones. The latter may be divided into two groups: those carefully cut and finished with stucco (Nos. 26, 27, 28, 52, 69), and the roughly finished, non-stuccoed variety (Nos. 53, 56, 57, 59, 70, 71). The stuccoed cippi were possibly boundary stones of sacred areas (to be associated with the structures implied by the Doric and Ionic architectural mem- bers?); the others may have been grave or field markers.'7 It is quite reasonable to 15 In 308 Ptolemy received Corinth from the daughter-in-law of Polyperchon, who had con- trolled the city since the death of Antipater in 319. Two years later Corinth was ceded to Cassander, whose general Prepelaos was driven thence in 303 by Demetrios. Demetrios' son Antigonos Gonatas still held Corinth in 253. In that year Alexander of Corinth, supporting Ptolemy, seized the city, only to lose it again to Antigonos in 247/6. In 243 Aratos captured the city from Antigonos. 16 Graves of the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C. have been discovered in the vicinity of the tunnel cistern (Fig. 1, C: B.C.H., LXXXVIII, 1964, p. 705, figs. 10-11; AEXr., XIX, 1964, Xpovuac4, p. 101, pl. 108; the grave from which came the bronze mirror should be dated in the early 3rd century rather than the late 3rd, as first reported); further east (Fig. 1, B: B.C.H., LXXXVII, 1963, p. 726; A4Xr., XVIII, 1963, Xpovtca, p. 79) have appeared burials of slightly earlier date (as well as Roman interments). It is quite possible that in addition to the sculptural markers Nos. 38-39, other stones such as the conical cippus (No. 69) and the stelai (Nos. 66-67) might have marked graves in the vicinity of the cistern. See Addendum on page 35. 17 In Athens occur numerous examples of simple grave and boundary stones carved in columnar form (as our Nos. 26-28) or as irregular slabs. A late 5th century grave marker for Hilarion from the Kerameikos (P1. 10, a) is considered by Werner Peek to be the earliest columnar grave monument in Athens (Kerameikos, III, Inschrif ten, Ostraka, Fluchtafeln, Berlin, 1941, no. 32, pp. 41-42, pl. 14, 3); see also A. Conze, Die attischen Grabreliefs, IV, Berlin, 1911-1922, p. 11, pl. 376. A few other Athenian grave and boundary markers which seem comparable to the Corinthian cippi are illustrated on Plate 10, b-f (E.M. 10095 = I.G., II_III2, pt. 2, p. 751; E.M. 10175 = I.G., II-III2, 2580; E.M. 10152 = I.G., II-III2, 2578; E.M. 10164 =I.G., II-III2, 2622; E.M. 10176 - I.G., II-III2, 2593) ; cf. also Conze, op. cit., III, Berlin, 1906, p. 303, pl. 291. Among the many such inscribed markers in the Epigraphical Museum in Athens I have seen none which have the form of an inverted T, as our Nos. 57 and 70. Simple grave stelai, often very roughly</page><page sequence="8">8 HENRY S. ROBINSON assume that if this quarter of the ancient city, for some political or military reason, had been severely treated by one of the occupying forces of the Hellenistic kings and strategoi and the inhabitants had been killed or enslaved, the agricultural lands might have been parcelled out among the soldiers of the permanent garrison of the great Macedonian stronghold at Corinth.18 The new allotments would have been larger than the old parcels and the new owners could dispense with many of the boundary stones which the previous generation of Corinthians had used.19 There is evidence to suggest that the area covered by this destruction was extensive. In 1960 a well was observed in the scarp of a ravine some 180 meters northeast of our manhole 3 (Fig. 1, A); this well proved to have been abandoned and filled with debris in the first quarter of the 3rd century B.C.; the shaft contained, along with pottery typical of the period, building debris such as large fragments of pebble mosaic flooring.2" It does not yet seem possible to ascertain the particular political upheaval which wrought so much destruction in western Corinth in the early 3rd century; but we may hope that continued investigations in various sectors of the city will enable us to establish more precisely the date of the disaster and thus to make clear the part it played in the history of Corinth in the early Hellenistic period. CATALOGUE MANHOLE 7 Each of the tunnels leading toward manholes 3 and 8 was cleared for a distance of about three meters from manhole 7. Four nearly complete amphorae and a cooking pot of the late 4th to early 3rd century B.C. were found in this fill. We must assume finished, are reported at Eleusis (TIo. 'ApX., 1889, cols. 175-176, 179 [archaic]; 1898, cols. 86-87 [geometric]); Amorgos (Ath. Mitth., X, 1886, pp. 99-101); and Thera (H. Dragendorif, Thera, II, Theraeische Graeber, Berlin, 1903, pp. 108-111, 295). I am indebted to Dr. Franz Willemsen of the German Archaeological Institute in Athens for the photograph of the grave marker of Hilarion and to Mrs. Konstantina Delmouzou-Peppa, Director of the Epigraphical Museum in Athens, for permission to reproduce photographs of the grave and boundary markers from that Museum. "8 Distribution of lots of land (tcX3pot) to (mercenary) soldiers is attested primarily in Asia Minor and the East in- Hellenistic times (G. T. Griffith, The Mercenaries of the Hellenistic World) Cambridge, 1935, pp. 314-316; M. Launey, Recherches sur les armnees hellenistiques, Paris, 1949, pp. 43-45, 349, 738; M. Rostovtzeff, The Social and Economic History of the Hellenistic World, Oxford, 1941, III, p. 1346). In most cases the land distributed was municipal or royal land, not previously in private ownership; but Griffith (op. cit., pp. 315, 196) cites the cases of Dionysios I of Syracuse and Nabis of Sparta, who turned over to their mercenaries and supporters captured territories and confiscated private properties (Diodoros Sic., XIV, 78, 2-3; Polybios, XIII, 6, 3). "I Nine other roughly finished boundary stones of poros (not stuccoed) were found in the filling of well 2, which connects with the Anaploga water tunnel near its northwestern extremity (Fig. 1): Inv. A 424-430 and two uninventoried fragments. One of these (A 424) bears on each face a roughly incised large letter: n and W (AX7r., XIX, 1964, XpovKa', p. 101, pl. 107; B.C.H., LXXXVIII, 1964, p. 705, fig. 9). The well was abandoned around 275 B.C., when the boundary stones and other debris were thrown into the lowest part of the shaft (LOT 1557). 20Hesperia, XXXI, 1962, pp. 116-117. G. R.

In addition to the five almost whole vessels the tunnels produced numerous small fragments of classical pottery, from Geometric times to the 4th century B.C. None of these fragments joined to another and they obviously represent the same dumped filling as that which filled the shaft from its floor to 108.93 m. above sea level. The latter fill (LOT 1649) contained two coins 21 and two fragments of terracotta figurines, a clay spindle whorl and a loomweight; no vases could be mended and none of the fragments of pottery was significant enough to inventory.22 The fill in the upper, part of the shaft (108.93 m. to 112.63 m.-LOT 1648) was similar to that below (small fragments of classical black-glazed pottery) but contained several late Roman pieces. This fill may have been thrown into the shaft in the 5th century after Christ to " top up " the well filling. OBJECTS FROM THE SHAFT 23 1. Terracotta head of child. P1. 4. MF 11578. Pres. H. 0.022 m.

ROBINSON widens slightly toward the heavy, overhanging rim, which is triangular in section. Handles, oval in section and with sharp spine on outside, from shoulder to below rim. In the upper wall, below the shoulder, appears a lead plug; its head on the exterior is round and flat, on the interior it is rough and flush with the surface of the vessel. There is no trace of flat bars of a clamp attached to this plug either inside or out; and the adjoining fragments of the body show no trace of other holes or plugs. It seems likely that the wall of the amphora was at this point imperfect and that a single lead plug was inserted to close a hole which had appeared during the firing. (The clay of this amphora, like that of the so-called Corinthian "blister ware " [cf. Hesperia, VI, 1937, p. 259; XVII, 1948, p. 233, E 10], contains some small bits of lime and other impurities. During firing some of these inclusions burned away com- pletely; the gas which formed in that process created pockets within the fabric; sometimes the clay enclosing the larger pockets fractured on one or both surfaces of the vessel.) This is a common Corinthian amphora type which has antecedents as far back as the 6th century (Hesperia, VII, 1938, pp. 605-606, nos. 201-203; XXII, 1953, pp. 108-109, under no. 166).

Robin- son, The Athenian Agora, V, Pottery of the Roman Period, Chronology, Princeton, 1959, F 22, G 85-86, M 4, M 36-37 and passim); here, however, the gouges were probably made by successive downward strokes of an instru- ment with multiple short teeth; the ridges resulting from this " combing " of the surface were partly smoothed down in the turning process. Perhaps a Corcyraean amphora (cf. Hes- peria, XXII, 1953, p. 108, under no. 166; Hes- peria, Suppl. X, 1956, p. 167, no. 204), but the type is very common in Corinth. 4. Coarse amphora. P1. 2.

Single, nar- row strap handle from shoulder to lip.</page><page sequence="11">A SANCTUARY AND CEMETERY IN WESTERN CORINTH 11 MANIHOLE 8 Here, as in manhole 7, the fill in the tunnels and in the lower part of the shaft (from bottom at 96.63 m. to 97.73 m.-Fill I: LOT 1687) was thrown in during the late 4th or early 3rd century B.C. Again it appears that numerous amphorae (in re-use as water jars?) fell into the bottom of the manhole during its last season of use and shattered, scattering fragments into both tunnels. This debris was not cleared out during the fall months, the cistern was abandoned and fill accumulated gradually in the manhole. First, a large rectangular poros water basin (No. 15) was allowed to drop into the shaft; this lay at 97.70 m. to 98.15 m. and thus might have been below the water level (maximum height about 99.00 m.) if water continued to reach manhole 8 from the main supply tunnel. Above the basin fragments lay some ninety centimeters of fill containing a relatively small quantity of very fragmentary pottery of the late 4th and early 3rd centuries B.C. (Fill II: LOT 1686); no whole vessels occurred in Fill II, which probably represents debris from a dump. The same observation holds true for the third filling, from 99.08 m. to 103.93 m. (Fill III: LOT 1685); but here the sherds range in date from Geometric to the middle of the 2nd century B.C. From 103.93 m. to 105.73 m. occurs a filling (IV: LOT 1684) con- taining many complete or nearly complete vessels which seem for the most part to represent the middle of the 2nd century B.C., though one Knidian amphora handle (No. 33) is to be dated ca. 108-88 B.C. That handle, found in the upper part of Fill IV, may perhaps have filtered down from Fill V (105.73 m. to 114.53 m.-LOT 1683), which like II and III, is a mixture of material of varying date, without joins. Fill V may represent a clearing of the site at the time of the founding of the Roman colony, though no clearly Roman sherds occurred. From 114.53 m. to 116.73 m. the filling (VI: LOT 1682) of very fragmentary pottery contained some pieces as late as the 2nd century after Christ. OBJECTS FROM FILL I 6. Cup, black glaze.

The echinus has a full curve at the top but an almost straight profile below. Three annu- lets with sharply profiled edges; a trace of a flute on the neck, just below the lowest annulet. Within the groove between echinus and abacus are slight traces of a second coating of stucco, so thick that it must have altered materially the profile of the capital; the finished surface of this second coat is nowhere preserved. The drawing (Fig. 4) shows the original state of the capital. Little of the bearing surface is pre- served and there is no trace of dowel cutting or of setting line. 15. Poros water basin, stuccoed.

Broken into three large and three small frag- ments, plus many smaller bits and pieces; parts of floor, wall and rim missing, but all essential details are preserved. Soft, grayish buff poros limestone; fine, creamy yellow stucco (over an undercoat of similar stucco mixed with fine sand and gravel) on interior and rim (the thickness of the stucco varies, according to the condition of the sur- face of the basin beneath, from 0.005 m. to 0.015 m.). A large block of poros hollowed out to form a rectangular basin or watering trough. The edges of the rim are bevelled inside and out to minimize damage from chipping. At floor level, in the center of the back wall, a drain hole (interior Diam. 0.07 m.), sloping down toward the exterior. The stucco of the interior is continued through this hole and out onto the exterior surface over a circular area ca. 0.25 m. in diameter around the drain hole; this thick boss of stucco probably served to provide a firm hold for a wooden plug. On the front vertical face appear two ( ?) incised let- ters: HE (letter height 0.13 m.). These are probably a mark of ownership. Mason's marks would not be expected on such a basin (unless from some previous use of the block, of which there is no indication) ; it does not seem pos- sible to interpret the two letters as a mark of liquid capacity (the actual capacity would have been about 130 liters or 3.3 amphora-measures).

Fragment A consists of the left leg from thigh to foot, left forearm, part of right leg and part of the resting surface of the figurine; non-joining fragments B, C and D represent parts of shoulder, chest and base. Hard, dark reddish clay, fired gray at core (not Corinthian). The figurine represents a woman draped in chiton and himation, seated on a rock (frag- ment D), with left hand in lap holding bunched folds of the outer garment. The figurine was not made in a mould, but was built up by hand; the condition of the interior shows that at least two (and in some areas three) layers of clay were used in the process. The fabric is</page><page sequence="16">16 HENRY S. ROBINSON thick, not smoothly finished; the lower part of the figure is unfinished behind and shows traces of the fingers and tools of the coroplast. The bottom edge is rough and bears the marks of the grain of the wooden surface on which the figure was mounted while being modelled. For seated figurines of the late 4th and early 3rd centuries, see D. B. Thompson, Hesperiac, XXXI, 1962, pp. 249-253. 18. Terracotta figurine fragment. P1. 4. MF 11464. Pres. H. 0.074 m.; pres. W. 0.067 m. The preserved part of the figure, modelled by hand, is attached to a flat background plaque (0.006 m. thick) which is broken away at bottom, right and top; the left edge is pre- served in part. Reddish buff clay, fired buff at core; sur- face faintly burnished; red glaze paint on back- ground. The relief appears to represent the legs of a draped female figure, seated (not standing, as the legs are closer together at the ankles than at the knees). The legs terminate in blunt ends, without modelling of feet. The distinc- tion in depth between vertical planes at the lap may have been minimal. At the preserved top of the background plaque are traces of a neatly cut hole; since this coincides approxi- mately with the position of the waist of the modelled figure, the hole cannot have been for suspension or attachment (for either of which the hole must be near the top of the plaque); it may have served to hold some object which protruded from the waist or rested in the lap of the figure.

Two engraved guide-lines, drawn at right angles to one another and from the centers of diametrically opposed flutes, fixed the position of the initial cylindrical hole of the empolion cutting, around which the rec- tangular depression was less precisely hollowed out. There was no empolion cutting on the resting surface, but near the outer edge of the resting surface appear five deep (and appar- ently intentional) incisions which seem to form the mark ll I (mason's marks?).

A cylindrical shaft with flat top rises from a cubical base, the whole cut from one block of stone. The stucco covers the shaft and the top of the base; the sides and bottom of the base were not stuccoed and were presumably imbedded in the earth. The stucco is much weathered and pitted, but the original surface, preserved at a few points, was extremely fine and smooth.

The Athenian Agora, V, F 1 and 2; also Hesperia, III, 1934, pp. 422, 433, E 151-152); the color of the glaze on the exterior is very similar to that of the lighter Pergamene fabric, but the clay is darker than Pergamene and there is no " double-dipping streak " (for this streak, an invariable feature of certain early Roman wares, see: Athenian Agora, V, p. 6; F. 0.

Plate with sloping floor on ring foot; broad, offset horizontal rim with ridge near lip. The shape is reminiscent of some Pergamene forms (as Athentian Agora, V, F 5), but the fabric and glaze are definitely of other manufacture. The shape occurs also in black glaze, as P 626 of the Athenian Agora (Hesperia, III, 1934, pp. 370-371, D 1), which is to be dated around the middle of the 2nd century B.C.</page><page sequence="19">A SANCTUARY AND CEMETERY IN WESTERN CORINTH 19 31.

Spine, catch-plate and spring-plate of bronze; the pins and springs of iron.

The spine has the shape of a lance blade and haft, the haft decorated with four trans- verse incised lines. Catch-plate has form of an elongated arrowhead, the edges of the blade bent up on both sides to hold the points of the pins. To the flat, rectangular spring-plate ad- hered, on either side, parts of the spiral iron springs of the two pins (in the course of clean- ing the spring was detached from one side of the plate). This type of fibula appears to have its origin in the northern Balkans, more specifically in the area of Dalmatia. It is a variant of the middle</page><page sequence="20">20 HENRY S. ROBINSON La Tene fibulae. For examples from Dalmatia, see: V. Curcic, "Alter und Herkunft einiger Fibeln und Tongeftisse aus Bosnien und H-er- cegovina," Jahrb. far Altertumskunde, II, 1908, p. 6, note 18; C. Truhelka, " Ein Tumulus der La-Tene-Periode in Mahrevici," Wiss. Mitth. aus Bosnien und der Herzegowuina, XII, 1912, pp. 24-25, figs. 27-30. For other examples from Greece: Chr. Blinkenberg, Fibules grecques et orientales, Copenhagen, 1926, p. 15, fig. 2 (with double pin; from Thisbe in Boeotia?); P. Per- drizet, Fouilles de Delphes, V, Paris, 1908, p. 112, no. 593, fig. 402 (with double pin; from the Pronaia sanctuary in Marmaria). Truhelka notes that some of the fibulae of this type from Mahrevici are made from a single piece of metal; but one (that illustrated in his figs. 29- 30) is made in two pieces; the springs and pins are separate from the spine, catch-plate and spring-plate as in our Corinthian example. The Mahrevici tumulus is dated by Truhelka (p. 16) in the middle La Tene period (300- 100 B.C.; or, according to Truhelka, after' 250 B.C.), but the pottery and bronze vessels from this and other contemporary tunmuli cited by Truhelka include Greek imports which mnust go back to the end of the 5th century or the be- ginning of the 4th. For other examples of bronze fibulae with iron pins, see Blinkenberg, op. cit., p. 117, no. VI.12.a, p. 125, no. VI.25.h, p. 222, no.

A single fragment comprises the "head," broken away at neck; bun of hair at back missing. Fine, grayish buff poros limestone. The locks of hair are modelled in a rather thick coat of stucco, over which the final coat of fine, white stucco (with marble dust) is applied. Over the hair the final coat was applied roughly with a brush; on the neck it is smooth. A cippus having the character of either a sacred boundary marker or an aniconic tomb portrait. It appears to represent a female head without mnodelled features of the face. Long locks of hair, rendered in moderate relief, are drawn up from the nape of the neck and back from what would be the middle of the face, and are united at the back in a bun (broken away). Mr. C.

Like No. 38 above, this cippus may have had the character of a sacred boundary stone or of a grave marker. the shaft are perhaps arguments against this interpretation.

The shortness of the shaft and the presence of a spreading base at the bottom of the form is not dissimilar to that of our cippus.

The rock-cut Phrygian tomb faqade at Yapuldag appears to present a close analogy to our cippus (F. von Reber, Die phrygischen Felsendenkmdler, Abh. der k. bayer. Akad. der Wiss., III. Cl., XXI.

It is worth noting, however, that the omphalos form is used as a capstone for graves, for cinerary urns and for sacrificial pits: Aegina-Arch. Anz., 1932, cols. 162-163, fig. 21; G.

It lies parallel with the left face of the triglyph, set 0.07 m. in from the left face; it extended to a point 0.07 m. (or less) from the right face.

The left face of the block, though broken away at left, is now 0.35 m. wide; it must therefore have comprised a metope (or metope-backer) as well as a triglyph.

The fill in the tunnels and in the shaft from bottom to 99.77 m. (Fill I: LOT 3202) was uniform and contained many fragments of amphorae similar to Nos. 2 and 3 above; none of the amphorae was sufficiently complete to permit restoration. In addition the fill contained numerous fragments of imported Attic black-glazed ware of the end of the 4th century B.C. and of Corinthian black glaze of the same period.24 This fill seems likely to have been thrown into the shaft at the time of abandonment in the late 4th or early 3rd century, since many of the vessels were clearly complete or nearly so when they fell in. Fill II (99.77 m. to 105.82 m.- LOT 3203) appears to contain nothing later than Fill I, but the character of the material is different: no vessels appear to have been anywhere near complete when thrown into the shaft; and many small pieces of fine ware of earlier periods (as early as Geometric) also occur. Fill III (105.82 m. to 111.17 m.-LOT 3204) is like II in the fragmentary condition of all the vessels represented and in the broad chronological range; but here some pieces seem to represent the first half of the 2nd century B.C.25 Fill IV (111.17 m. to 114.92 m.-LOT 3205) produced one coin 2 and a number of nearly whole vessels, several of which are listed below. These appear to be no later in date than the sack by Mummius in 146 B.C. Uninventoried material from the Fill confirms this chronology.27 Fill V (114.92 m. to 119.32 m.) contained some early Roman wares 28 plus one fragment of pottery of the 3rd century after Christ and a fragment of a late Roman lamp. In Fill V occurred another Corinthian bronze coin of the Pegasos/trident type (symbol illegible). In the upper levels (119.32 m. to modern surface; the rock-cut shaft of the manhole first appeared at about 120.60 m.) there were no significant sherds, but one coin of the 4th century after Christ.29 24 Attic black-glazed kantharos as Thompson's A 28 (Hesperia, III, 1934, p. 319, fig. 5); black-glazed kantharoi and skyphoi similar in shape to Thompson's A 28-31, A 26; Attic fragments with rouletted and stamped ornament such as occurs in Thompson's Group A. 25 Non-inventoried pieces which confirm this dating are: a small fragment of Megarian bowl comparable to Thompson's D 49; a black-glazed kantharos rim fragment with incised zigzag orna- ment; some imitations of early Pergamene fabric; and a lamp nozzle of Broneer's Type XI. 28 A Corinthian bronze of the Pegasos/trident type, the symbol illegible. 27 Simple bowls with poor brownish to black glaze, similar to Thompson's D 9 and 5; an unguentarium comparable in body profile to Thompson's C 76; a coarse cooking ware bowl on ring foot identical in shape with Corinth C-47-827 (from a manhole in the Southeast Building, a group dated by G.

The shaft may originally have been square in section; it has apparently been cut back obliquely on one side for a distance of 0.22 m. down from the top to adjust the stone to some adjacent block or monument. It is perhaps not impertinent to call attention to the poros pillar from the Argive Heraion (C. Waldstein, The Argive Heraeum, I, Boston, 1902, pp. 42-43, 139-140, figs. 15, 70) which Waldstein sug- gested might be the primitive " kion " or pillar- image of Hera mentioned by Pausanias: from a block originally square in plan each of the four corners has been bevelled vertically from FIG. 9.

Probably Corinthian fabric. At the top of the relief field, a simplified guilloche pattern. In the field, from left to right: standing female figure, Amymone and Poseidon standing apart, helmeted Athena facing ( ?) with shield, standing female figure, girl advancing right to crown a trophy. Below, a single row of acanthus leaves with running rabbits between the tips of the leaves; on base, a rosette with four large and four small leaves. The Amymone-Poseidon group is familiar on Attic bowls, where, however, the god generally has his right hand on the shoulder of Amymone (W. Schwabacher, A.J.A., XLV, 1941, pp. 188-190, Group 2); the girl crowning trophy also occurs on bowls from Athens (ibid., pp. 191-193, Group 4). With this should be compared other related bowls from the Corinthia: Corinth C-64-335 (Corinthian fabric) and CP 1927 (probably not Corinthian fabric); Isthmia IP 1475 and IP 3352. On C-64-335 (from the upper filling of manhole 11 of the Anaploga tunnel system) appear two figures similar to those used for C-65-98 (Athena [but she is moving right, with head facing], girl crowning trophy); on CP 1927 appear the figures of Amymone and Poseidon. All three of the bowls from Corinth have similar bands of simplified guilloche above the figured zone and at the bottom have ro- settes or rabbits between the tips of the single row of acanthus leaves. The group of girl crowning trophy occurs on both the fragments from Isthmia and on a number of bowls of Corinthian manufacture from Corinth (as, C-65-373). The mould for C-65-98 was prepared from badly worn dies and was already cracked when this bowl was produced. Although it is prob- able that somne of the same dies were used for producing each of the three separate moulds from which C-65-98, C-64-335 and CP 1927 were made, the state of the dies differs from bowl to bowl. On C-64-335 (which G. R. Edwards considers the earliest of the figured Megarian bowls from Corinth, around the end of the 3rd century B.C.) we have the earliest and freshest state of the dies. C-65-98 appears to be the latest of the three; the dies used for its mould were worn and had probably been retouched, and the bowl appears to have shifted while in the mould, so that the figures have a double outline. The Megarian bowl of Corin- thian fabric C-28-52 was made from a mould in which the Poseidon (without Amymone) and girl (crowning a non-existent trophy) were produced from dies of smaller size; the rabbits in the field are very similar to those on C-65-98. It is probable that C-28-52 is later than any of the other three noted above; it was made with new dies which were impressed into the mould at random, without consideration of the original iconographical relationship of one to another. 63.

No inscription nor any trace of paint on the preserved surfaces. It is possible that the stela crown No. 65 may belong to this stela. 68. Column shaft, poros, faceted. P1. 8. A 505. Pres.

THE ARCHITECTURE The architectural remains found in the manholes, particularly Nos. 14, 25 and 45, permit some deductions as to the chronology and the character of the architectural monuments of the area. No. 45 (Fig. 8, P1. 7) is a Doric corner triglyph/metope block well enough preserved so that all its dimensions (except the width of the metope)</page><page sequence="32">32 HENRY S. ROBINSON can be ascertained; it comprised the adjoining triglyphs and one metope (on the left side of the block). The elevation of the triglyph (heads of the glyphs) resembles that of the very much larger exterior order of the peristyle of the temple of Zeus at Olympia, while the section of the glyph at the top is very similar to that of the pronaos order of the same temple."0 The triglyph is very small, smaller than those of the Megarian Treasury at Olympia or of the Athenian Treasury at Delphi, about the same width as those of the Syracusan Treasury at Olympia (W. 0.306 m.; H. 0.460 m.). It cannot derive from anything larger than a distyle in antis faqade. It might with greater likelihood belong to a triglyph altar or to a triglyph frieze forming a parapet wall, as at the Sacred Spring in Corinth.3" It can hardly have served for the frieze of a normal Doric building, since the corner cornice block in such a structure would almost certainly have been a true corner block, shading both faces of the corner triglyph beneath; such a cornice block would normally have been held in place by means of dowels in the side joints (at right angles to the two faces) rather than by a hidden dowel in the middle of the resting surface as is implied for the cornice associated with our No. 45.32 30 E. Curtius and F. Adler, Olympia, Tafelband I, Die Baudenkmndler, Berlin, 1892, pls. XIII, 1, XV. It is not feasible to attempt to date the triglyph on the basis of proportions of width to height, since in normal Doric construction triglyph widths may vary considerably across the prin- cipal faqades; and the proportion of height of taenia to height of triglyph in the frieze of a building may be quite different from that in an altar or a parapet wall. For the dating of our single triglyph the best parallels are those of elevation and section of the top of the glyphs, as noted above. 31 B. H. Hill, Corinth, I, vi, The Springs, Princeton, 1964, pp. 138-145, 177-185; cf. also Hesperia, XXIX, 1960, p. 231, note 12, fig. 3. 32 The use of a hidden dowel in the resting surface of a corner cornice block is attested in the poros construction of the Propylon of the Gymnasium at Epidauros. This building was erected in the 3rd century B.C. according to G. Roux (L'architecture de l'Argolide aux IVe et IlIe siMcles avant J.-C., Paris, 1961, p. 412). One corner cornice block and two corner triglyphs can be seen adjacent to the east side and the northeast corner of the Propylon. On the resting surface of the corner cornice block (P1. 11, c, d) appears a square dowel hole (its shape at the surface of the stone much altered by the violent removal of the metal dowel) measuring 0.08 m. x 0.08 m. x 0.135 m. deep; some of the lead which held the dowel in place survives in the depth of the cutting. The hole is placed 0.23 m. in from the edge of the resting surface on the front, 0.26 m. in from the edge on the side. The corner triglyph which lies adjacent to this cornice block (PI. 11, c) has on its bearing surface a corresponding dowel cutting which measures 0.04 m. x 0.04 m. x 0.065 m. deep; its position fits very well with that of the dowel hole in the undersurface of the cornice (allowing ca. 0.03 m. overhang of the resting surface on front and side). There is no indication of lead in the dowel hole of the corner triglyph block. Presumably the metal dowel was slightly less than 0.04 m. square in section; this metal pin must have been leaded into the cutting in the resting surface of the cornice block before that stone was set in position. Since the pin could not also be leaded into the cutting on the top of the triglyph, the dowel hole there was made smaller in order to provide as tight a fit as possible for the dowel when the cornice block was carefully lowered (in absolutely level position) onto the frieze course. It should be noted that the corner cornice block as well as at least one other cornice block (not from a corner) of the Propylon of the Epidauros Gymnasium were provided also with T-dowels on the resting surfaces at both side joints (P1. 11, c, e; the latter block is incomplete at left, where</page><page sequence="33">A SANCTUARY AND CEMETERY IN WESTERN CORINTH 33 A corner triglyph at the Heraion of Argos, which Roux assigns to a triglyph altar,83 has a dowel hole on its bearing surface, placed within 0.12 m. and 0.15 m. of the two outer faces (P1. 7). The northwest corner triglyph of the triglyph altar at Corcyra has a dowel hole near the center of its bearing surface.3" Dowel holes on corner triglyph blocks, placed as on our block No. 45 and on the triglyphs from the Heraion of Argos and Corcyra, could most easily have served to hold-in place two cornice blocks meeting over the corner in a diagonal joint; just such a joint is pre- served at the exterior angle of the cornice of the triglyph wall at the Sacred Spring in Corinth,35 although no dowel appears to have been used there. It is most reasonable to assume that the corner triglyph block No. 45 served as part of a triglyph altar or of a triglyph parapet wall; it appears to belong to the first half of the 5th century B.C. The Doric column capital (No. 14) also shows some resemblance in profile to the capitals of the temple of Zeus at Olympia; the abacus, however, is rather shallow in proportion to the height of the echinus.36 The width of the abacus (est. 0.483 m.) appears to be too small for association with a triglyph even of the small dimensions of our No. 45, for which one would expect an abacus at least 0.62 m. wide (2 to 2/2 times as wide as the triglyph). It may be that the capital is from a votive or funerary column.37 Unfortunately its bearing surface is not sufficiently well preserved to indicate whether the capital supported any further member. Like the corner triglyph, the capital appears to be of the first half of the 5th century B.C. The Ionic column drum (No. 25) has broad, shallow flutes which suggest a date in the 4th century B.C. One may compare with them the shallow flutes of the interior order of the South Stoa at Corinth 8 and of the Ionic columns of the Abaton at the overhang with mutules and viae is broken away). These dowels, like that at the outer corner of the corner cornice block, must have created very difficult conditions for the masons in the setting of the blocks of the cornice course. T-dowels are known as early as the 6th century (Delphi, Treasury of the Knidians, W. B. Dinsmoor, B.C.H., XXXVII, 1913, p. 10) and are common from the middle of the 5th century (base of the Athena Parthenos, W. B. Dinsmoor, A.J.A., XXXVIII, 1934, pp. 93-94, fig. 2; Erechtheion, G. P.

For propor- tions in 5th and 4th century Doric capitals, see P. Amandry, Hesperia, XXI, 1952, pp. 257-259; the proportions of our capital would place it at the head of most of Amandry's (or, rather, de la Coste- Messeliere's) tables and so clearly in the first half of the 5th century. 37 It is even smaller than the isolated Doric capital from the Corinthian Kerameikos, the abacus of which is 0.63 m. wide (A. Stillwell, Corinth, XV, i, The Potters' Quarter, Princeton, 1948, pp. 69-70, 80, fig. 11, pl. 25, B). 38 0.

ROBINSON Epidauros.89 The number of flutes, twenty, is common in Peloponnesian Ionic archi- tecture.40 The absence of an empolion cutting on the resting surface of an Ionic column drum is unusual. In the Doric order- of the classical period the resting surface of the lowest drum of the shaft (which rests on the stylobate) is usually without enpolion; in the Ionic style, however, the lowest drum (which rested either on the column base or oh a short section of shaft incorporated into the base block) and also all other drums usually have the empolion on both the resting and the bearing surface.41 If we assume our drum to have been the uppermost one in the shaft, then, on analogy with the proportions of the order its the South Stoa at Corinth, our columni should have had a base diameter of about 0.48 m. and a height (with capital) of about 4.53 ti.; if our druim had been the lowest in the shaft, the entire column (with capital) would have been about 2.88 m. high.42 It is not impossible that this drum derives from a votive or funerary column (at suggested above also for the Doric capital No. 14) or from one of the supports of a baldachino such as was erected about 400 B.C. over the triglyph altar at the sanctuary of Hera Akraia at Perachora.43 The base diameter of the Ionic colulmns in the Perachora baldachino is 0.37 m.; the lower diameter of our drunm (No. 25) is 0.305 tm.

Delorme, Gymunasion, Paris, 1960, fig. 19) there were three Ionic columns, of which the bases of two survive; the central base has an empolion cutting on its bearing surface, the southern base has none. Such an irregularity cain be attributed, in all probability, to careless- ness on the part of the contractor or mason; a similar factor may be responsible for the absence of empolion cutting in the resting surface of our Corinthian drum. 42 The columns of the Temple of Athena Nike on the Acropolis at Athens are 4.066 m. high; those of the baldachino around the triglyph altar at Perachora have been estimated to be 2.501m. to 3.0{ m. high. H. Payne et al., Perachora, I, The Sanctuaries of Hera Akraia and Limenia, Oxford, 1940, pp. 89-91; H. Plommer and F. Salviat, " The Altar of lIera Akraia at Perachora," B.S.A., LXI, 1966, pp. 207-215. Parallels for the baldachino at Perachora are to be found at Corinth in the area of Temple A, one covering a small shrine erected over the dismanitled temple, the other covering an altar in front of the same shrine (R. Stillwell et al., Corinth, I, ii, Architecture, Cambridge, 1941, pp. 4-16, pl. I. Excavations by Mr. Charles Williams in 1966 established that the construction of the two baldachinos is probably to be dated at the end of the 4th century or the beginning of the 3rd: cf. B.C.H., XCI, 1967, p. 633). It may be noted that a baldachino appeared on the bier of Alexander the Great, surrounding the sarcophagus (Diodoros Sic. XVIII, 26-27; K. F. Muller, Der Leichenwagen Alexanders des Grossen, Leipzig, 1905); and it is possible that the " peristyles" which occur on sarcophagi (as that of the Mourning Women) and on numerous fiinerary monuments (as the Nereid Monument of Xanthos) were intended to imply baldachinos over a place of offering to the dead rather than temples which would symbolize the deification of the dead (cf. Muller, op. cit., p. 49).</page><page sequence="35">A SANCTUARY AND CEMETERY IN WESTERN CORINTH 35 centuries B.C. a sanctuary or cemetery whose area was clearly marked out by stuccoed boundary stones; that in this area there existed a triglyph altar, built in the first half of the 5th century and perhaps covered by a baldachino of the Ionic order in the 4th century; that at least one votive or funerary column of the Doric order and a large stela stood there. There is no certain evidence in all our material for any roofed buildings. Graves are known to have existed in the vicinity of Anaploga and some of them were probably marked by poros stones (especially Nos. 38 and 39). The architectural members noted above may have adorned the cemetery or a sanctuary, which, int close proximity to the grave areas, might well have been devoted to a hero cult or to chthotit divinities. It is to be hoped that the activities of the farmers in the area, ploughing their fields, may yet bring to light some remains of such a sanctuary still in situ which will render possible a complete excavation of this presently elusive monument.
