JENSEN, ALICE M. LEAHY, HELEN ,MARSHALL, MELITA H. ODEN, and, others. Stanford University Press and George G. Harrap &amp; Co., Ltd. 1930. Pp. xiii+508. 21s. THIs is a follow-up study of the thousand gifted children whose intellectual and other qualities were investigated in the research described in Volume I. It is hoped that such studies may be continued for another twenty years, by which time the majority of the cases will be approaching the middle period of life. At the time of the present study the group is for the most part from 13 to 19 years old and at College or in the upper classes of school; but the extreme age-range is from 8 to 27 years. Six years have elapsed since the original investigation of the group. There were 1438 cases in the original inquiry, of whom 643 formed the main experimental group; and at the date of the second inquiry 1201 were still co-operating, including 587 of the main experimental group. -Between the two " cross-sections " of the child's life there had been annual or more frequent correspondence with the parents and the school. There were 73 children still not more than 13 years of age at the time of the retest, and these were given again the Stanford-Binet Test. Their average I.Q. six years before had been 148,- and it was now '140, the drop being mainly due to -the girls of the group, and only slightly to the boys. Although these 73 children ranged, at the 'time of the original test, from 2 to 6 years of age, there was no evidence that the drop in I.Q. was particularly associated with the younger ages; the eleven original two- year-olds had dropped in I.Q. just about as much, and no more, than any other age-group, if the probable errors of the measurements are taken into consideration. There were of course gains as well as losses, and probably some at least of the losses were due to the fact that many of the children were near the " ceiling " of the test and could do no more than pass every item. One girl did indeed perform this feat, yet gained an I.Q. of only 173 as against her original 192. She is not however included in the calcu- lation of the average drop. The cases over 13 years of age were unsuitable for retesting by the Binet scale, which is only intended for children, or adults below the higher levels. The next older cases were retested by the Terman Group Test but although this test has more " top " than the Stanford-Binet, yet even it is inadequate to measure the older gifted children, and still older cases 'were therefore given the Thorndike College Entrance Examination. These group tests substantially bore out what the Binet tests of'the younger cases had shown, that the group as a whole was still far above the average level of intelligence, but that a number of cases showed marked departures from the level that would have been expected from the scores of six years ago, most frequently in a downward direction, but in a few cases upward.</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS. 515 Careful inquiry into the health records, the, personality traits, the racial ancestry, of the group whose I.Q.'s had dropped failed to show any significant influence of these factors, nor were any marked changes in famnily cir- cumstances found. An interesting part of the research, for which Miss Jensen was responsible, is the evaluation of the merit of prose and poetry which has been written by fourteen of the most literary of the gifted group. Their writings, or extracts, usually two specimens from each child, were intermingled with extracts of similar length from the juvenile writings of men and women who afterwards became famous writers, as Byron, Hawthorne, Burns, Pope, Macaulay. The 151 specimens thus assembled were then given for rating to seven judges, of whom four were Professors or lecturers in English, with previous school teaching experience, while the others were psychologists who had already made inquiries into the psychology of literary taste. The judges worked separately, and they were sometimes, but only seldom, able to identify a famous writer from his juvenile style, as when Judge D reports " this sounds like Shelley ", or Judges B and F say " Burns ", on reading poems written by thlese at 18 and 17 respectively. But in the opinion of these judges, there were some of the writings of the Californian children which showed about as much,literary promise as any of the twenty-eight eminent authors had shown' at a corresponding age. Perhaps the reader of this review would like to try to say which of the following two fragments was written by a Californian child and which by Samuel Johnson, each at the age of 16: A. And this is death ? This carven marble face, The effigy of one we loved so well, Lies on its pillow, white as are the blooms That early spring has heaped upon his bier. B. This tributary verse receive, my fair, Warm with an ardent lover's fondest prayer. May this returning day forever find Thy form more lovely, more adorn'd thy mind. Perhaps the most- remarkable production is a verse by Verda, a Californian girl of mixed Scottish, Irish, Prench and English ancestry, who was found to be able to read, without any instruction, at the age of four, and at five composed and printed, without spaces between the words, this The place I'd like to be Is where the spreading tree Spreads its shade And is made By the gentle hand of God In the. rich, black mud. And the brooklet, ripples down To the other end of town, And the roses are in bloom, And the violets give perfume, Ard the blue grass waves like bushes, And in the brook here wave rushes, But instead-a dingy town. In another chapter, five gifted musicians among the group are described, and other sections deal with children who ate " zealots " in this or that</page><page sequence="3">516 NEWV BOOKS. school subject or hobby. It is of cQurse extremely difficult to say whether any of the whole thousand are going to be men or women of genius in the world's sense. Indeed, perhaps the first impression one gets from a, rapid skimming of the book is of disappointment that among so many carefully selected children there is not yet one who can be said to come near genius in the sense in which we apply the term to Byron or Keats or Clerk Maxwell. But second reading makes one wonder if one has not been too hasty, and expected too much from children who are still for the most part at, school and only rarely at College. What the work does seem to show is that there are other factors which may nullify the promise of early child- hood, factors of temperament and character, or merely factors of the environment. Joseph, for example, the brilliant eldest son of a mixed American and Japanese marriage (and remember the Californian prejudice against the Japanese), is now at seventeen the breadwinner of the family on the remote family ranch, and fighting both against prejudice and a poor soil. He wants to go to the University to study scientific stockbreeding, but is loth to abandon his home-responsibilities. Or Clara, brought up in the unconventional environment of a clairvoyant's dingy home in a Los Angeles slum, whose Italian parents became intermittently divorced and reconciled, and whose school record has become more and more disappoint- ing, may perhaps claim to have had less chance than her fellows. On the other hand, several members of the gifted group have shown deterioration under exceptionally favourably circumstances, and others have won through obstacles. The main fact must steadily be kept in view, that as a group, with all these exceptions, these children still in the large majority of cases are far above the general level of their fellows in intelligence and in school and college achievement. " It is quite possible ", say the authors, " that no intellect of heroic .stature will emerge from the thousand gifted subjects of the present investigation. By the laws of chance one could hardly be expected, for after all the selection was made from only about a, quarter-million children of the Californian school population. The Oxford Rhodes scholars are far more highly selected than our gifted group, yet from the hundreds who have gone from the United States during the last twenty- five years none has thus far risen to over-towering eminence."

I AM not able to regard these Studies as among the most successful of -this well-known and valuable series. I hasten, however, to add that this remark involves no reflection on their authors, all of whom are competent, and some of whom are distinguished. I would attribute the unsatisfactory impression they make as a whole mainly to a somewhat infelicitous choice of a subject for their co-operative enterprise. The seven Californian Sages set out, like the seven against Thebes, to attack one of the most arid and intractable of philosophic problems. True, the 'problem of relations ' continues to be a manifest favourite of academic philosophy, but it should long ago have become evident that no laurels are to be gathered by ex- peditions into this desert. Questions whether 'relations' exist and what is their 'nature', and whether they are 'valid ' and ' external' or 'internal',</page><page sequence="4">NEW BOOKS. 517 and what (if anything) all these terms mean, no doubt lend themselves to endless (and fruitless) discussion; but it is a little surprising that they should have been deemed by the philosophers of the University of California at Berkeley worthy of being made the objective of their annual foray, the thirteenth. For the game that is played with 'the problem of relations' is subject to such very odd restrictions and conventions that all prospects of success seem from the outset to be seriously compromised. For example, though it is common enough to treat 'relations' with a respect bordering upon veneration as self-subsistent, superhuman, if not also supernatural, entities, one might searchtheliteraturefar andwide without finding in it any reference to any relater, whose actions and activities constitute the relations he is said to 'recognize', or to his purposes, ideas and feelings in so doing. By a tacit convention any such references are strictly taboo, and the discussion is vitiated from the outset by the depersonalizing fiction which enables every philosopher to claim the authority of 'reason as such' for his own idiosyncrasies: yet it never seems to occur to philosophers that by this convention they severely restrict the area of their inquiry, and may render the questions they discuss unmeaning and insoluble. It is a further convention, to the strangeness of which the academic separation between the departments of psychology and of philosophy should not have blunted our perceptions, that abstraction must be made -from the psychological side of logical problems, and no inquiry must be tolerated into the, psychological provenance,, relations and affiliations of the terms used in philosophizing. Yet when the question is raisedit can hardly be denied that notions like 'validity', 'certainty' and 'necessity' have a wide (and perhaps vague) psychological sense, and- that feelings of ' validity' 'certainty' and 'necessity' assuredly exist. If, therefore, it is desired to use these terms in a specific logical sens6, one would expect that some attempt should be made to specify in what respects logical validity, certainty and necessity differed from psychological, before proceeding to build upon them elaborate structures which may prove to have little or no foundations. It is not, therefore, surprising that philosophic inquiries should so often prove abortive. But, to come to closer quarters with this Californian enterprise, Prof. D. S. Mackay leads the way with a Historical Sketch of the Problen of Rela- tions which traces it back to the struggles of the Platonic with the Megarian and Cynic Schools, and lucidly distinguishes between relations between things, terms and objects of knowledge. This enables him to separate the question of the metaphysical status of relations from that of their logical import and their cognitive validity. But where, one asks, is there any recognition of their relativity to the purpose of their relater, and so of their ratioiality and use ? And his fine contempt for " eristic arguments which would reduce all knowledge to the bare statement of identity " (p. 13), contrasts somewhat oddly with Prof. Prall's subsequent acceptance of the contention of Symbolic Logic that any law of logic is a tautology (p. 155), and that " there are in logic no propositions that assert anything " (p. 158). Prof. J. Loewenberg, who discusses The Question of Priority, gallantly tackles the ambiguities of the 'prior'. He develops the idea of R. B. Perry's ' ego-centric predicament' by declaring a 'concentric predicament' universal, meaning thereby that " we all move in concentric circles ", each of which tends to include everything (p. 54). He then catalogues specifically the biocentric predicament, which leads to pragmatism, the archceo-centric, which leads to naturalism, the ego-centric, which leads to solipsism, the</page><page sequence="5">518 NEW BOOKS. psycho-centric, which leads to idealism, the logo-centric, which leads to rationalism, and the cosmo-centric, which leads to his own 'problematic realism' and ' dialectical pragmatism'. The most urgent questions this classificaton suggests to me is, whose ' mind ' the ' psycho-centric ' predica- ment refers to, and why it should not be called anthropo-centric ; or in other words, why human personality should be ignored in laying the foundations on which " idealistic edifices rest " (p. 58). Prof. S. C. Pepper discusses 'Categories ', with special reference to Prof. C. I. Lewis's Mind and the World Order, which should not, he thinks, call them a priori, seeing that they are hypothetical, and depend for " their success in describing the intrinsic structure of stuff " (p. 97). Prof. V. F. Lenzen on The Nature of Geometrical Relations well brings out the derivation of geometry from physics and the variety of choices mathematicians are now-a-days admitted to have in constructing their science. Prof. D. W. Prall's paper on Implication is the longest and perhaps the most ambitious in the volume. Without questioning the assumption of Symbolic Logic as a purely formal science, and agreeing that " tautology is the form of all the laws of logic " (p. 136), even while arguing that tautology is meamingless, he yet aims to show that " logical relations - . are actually abstracted from everyday sense experience, and that the attempt to make them a priori and fundamental instead of derivative, culminating in the view that they are not only sui generis but absolute . . . fails " (p. 138). His proof of this pontention seems to me to suffer seriously from his omission to analyse the notions of 'logical necessity' and 'certification', but on page 155 he comes near to seeing that the 'necessity' concerned is a personal meaning. Prof. P. Marhenke discusses The Reality of Relations, and establishes " the futility of Mr. [W.,E.] Johnson's attempt to reduce the relational proposition to the predicative form " (p. 186). Finally, Prof. G. P. Adams, in his study, The Relation between Form and Process, not only gives a useful summary of several of the earlier lectures, but breaks fresh ground, and threatens to burst through the cadre of the whole 'problem'. He challenges the whole antithesis of 'form' and 'matter' in its traditional form, declares that "experience discloses active forms organizing material " and suggests that "the matter to which a form or category is applied may also be a process which generates the very form which is used to organize it " (p. 191). Inquiring how the antithesis of form and matter arises, he finds that our ability to discriminate them depends " upon a certain looseness of structure, upon the absence of invariable and universal ties or relations between the parts of our world " (p. 195). An appeal to James's psychology and its 'law of dissociation by varying concomitants', yields the insight that 'form' is just the name for any invariant element or character amid the flux of change. But Prof. Adams resists the temptation of exaggerating this invariance. It need not be absolute. " It is enough if there be a relative invariancy" (p. 196), and this is enough to satisfy "' the dictum that there is no change without the changeless " (p. 197). He sees further that knowledge is discernment of form, and that in observing " we rearrange and reshuffle " our world (p. 198). " Experimentation, the voluntary inauguration of changes in an item's concomitants, is in principle present from the earliest use of eyes and hands," and framing a hypothesis is " placing an idea in some novel and it may be fruitful context ". But " it is the loose structure of the world which makes this possible " (p. 199). Is not all this a fresh breeze of common sense dissipating philosophic fogs ? So is the recognition (p. 204 f.) that there are alternative foris and organizing principles both in</page><page sequence="6">NEW BOOKS. 519 science and in metaphysics; and that " both freedom and mind come into being only when any material does not inevitably carry with it the one form which organizes and determines it" (p. 208). In view of this, to what depths may we not expect the price of the 'block-u-niverse ' of Absolutism and determinism to slump ? Finally (p. 214), Prof. Adams also asks " where do purposes, plans of actions, ideals, judgments of value and standards come from ? " Certainly a pertinent question, and the putting of it shows that Prof. Adams has transcended the limitations of his 'problem'. For there is no room for these essential constituents of our real world among the unreal and fictitious abstractions of academic controversy. F. C. S. SCHILLER. Moral Sense. By JAmES BoNAR, LL.D London: George Allen &amp; Unyin, Ltd. (Library of Philosophy), 1930. Pp. 304. Price 12s. 6d. net. I OUGHT to begin with an apology for the late appearance of this review. The editor of MIND sent me Dr. Bonar's volume almost a year ago, but a series of unfortunate circumstances has hindered me from completing and sending in my notice until now. Dr. Bonar's work (his second contribution to the Library of Philosophy) is dedicated to 'J.H.M.' and if one is correct in expanding 'J.H.M.' to 'Professor J. H. Muirhead ', the compliment is' well deserved. Whatever be the extent to which they differ from his philosophical doctrines, philo- sophers of all schools of thought cannot but recognise the devoted service which Professor Muirhead has rendered to philosophy for many years. Were we to reckon that service by taking account only of his share in the production. of the 'Library of Philosophy '-and that would indeed be a miserly reckoning-our debt of gratitude to him would be incalculably great. t In his Preface, Dr. Bonar mentions that this volume fulfils a promise of the original programme of the ' Library '. It is to be concerned with an important type of moral theory which prevailed in this country for the greater part of the eighteenth century-the theory of the 'Moral Sense', suggested by Lord Shaftesbury and developed by Francis Hutcheson. The volume begins with an account of Shaftesbury's system, touching on his relations to Hobbes, Cudworth, and Locke. A short chapter-passes in review the criticisms of such thinkers as Mandeville and Berkeley; and the sympathetic, qualified criticism of Butler. In Chapters III. -to VI, (inclusive), the more definitely developed doctrine of Moral Sense as found in Hutcheson is expounded; and following is a chapter on ' inor Critics '. The author then turns to the modification of the Moral Sense theory as found in Hume-both the 'Treatise' and the ' Enquiry' being dealt with; and after a fairlv detailed exposition and discussion of Adam Smith's criticism of ' Moral Sense ' and rejection of it in favour of ' Moral -Senti- ments ', the final chapter is devoted,to a brief account of Kant's attitude to the ' Moral Sense ' theory. In the form of an Appendix there is a dialogue 'Concerning Natural Gifts and Graces and the Intellectual Virtues ' in which 'Shaftesbury abides the Questioning of a Young Modern Admirer'. From a writer of Dr. Bonar's eminence, we expect a scholarly production. Nor are we disappointed. At the end of every chapter there are copious references to the literature of the period, and one feels that the author cannot have left many writings unexamined which might possibly throw light upon the doctrines expounded by him. It would be rather inappro- priate, therefore, to enter upon the discussion of details of Dr. Bonar's</page><page sequence="7">520 NEW BOO1KS. interpretation of his authors; it would be inappropriate, at any rate, for the reviewer whose need to learn is decidedly greater than his competence to discuss the views of the British Moralists. But as the. author of this volume would naturally expect his work to aid the less as well as the more mature students of the period he is dealing with, it may be permissible to set forth the general impression of one who is rather a beginner in the study of British Moral theory. I must confess that I did not get quite so much from the book as I had hoped. Whether that was the result of Dr. Bonar's method of exposition, or the difficulty of presenting any systematic account of the Moral Sense theory, or the difficulty of attuning one's mind to the characteristic eighteenth century modes of thought, I do nbt presume to say. But, from whatever cause, I have not come awawy with anv clear impression of the views expounded and the criticisms offered. I am loth to suggest that Dr. Bonar is responsible, but I have read the book through twice-with sufficient intervals between readings-and both times felt a lack of force and coherence of treatment. Curiously enough, I do not feel the same difficulty about the doctrines of the 'MIoral Sense' writers, as expounded by Sidgwick and Martineau. This difference between Dr. Bonar, on the one hand, and Sidgwick and Martineau, on the other, mav really be due to a difference of intetpretation. At any rate, the latter writers place much less stress on the importance of the doctrine of 'Moral Sense-' in Shaftesbury, than the former (if I do not misunderstand him) does; and, on the whole, the Sidgwick-Martineau interpretation wins my allegiance. I have introduced this comparison, because it may possibly explain my trouble in reading Dr. Bonar's work. The clue to my dissatisfaction may lie in the title of his book-" Moral Sense ". Dr. Bonar takes Hutcheson as the chief exponent of the Moral Sense theory, regards Shaftesbury as having suggested it, and Hume, Adam Smith and Kant as, in their various ways, critics of it. No doubt this is a reasonable and sound view to take. But it 'is possible that in the attempt to exhibit the historical continuity of their doctrines, Dr. Bonar's treatment of these writers has been tram- melled by having the idea of the " Moral Sense " always at the back of his mind. It is unfortunate that one tends to emphasise what one finds wrong with a book, and that one allows the good to speak for itself; and we cannot end this rather 'impressionistic' notice without expressing sincere gratitude to Dr. Bonar for having undertaken that laborious research, the results of which have been embodied in the work before us. W. D. LAMONT. Franciscan Philosophy at Oxford in the Thirteenth Century. By D. E. S:HARP, M.A'., D.Phil. Oxford University Press, 1930. 8vo, viii, 419 pp. 21s. Tas volume is made up of a series of studies devoted to the philosophical doctrines of Robert Grosseteste, Thomas of York, Roger Bacon, John Peckam, Richard of Middleton, and Duns Scotus. The title is likely to raise objections, but perhaps it was not easy to find a fitting one, for such a' book. It is not really a history of Franciscan philosophy at Oxford, but, rather, an interpretation' of some Franciscan philosophers; but if Miss Sharp had selected a title accordingly, it would have been objected to her that Grosseteste was not a Franciscan, although he was the founder of the Franciscan school at Oxford. On the other hand, we are not sure that</page><page sequence="8">NEW BOOKS. 521 Richard of Middleton was an Oxford man; in fact, we are not even absolutely sure that he was an Englishman, so that from that point of view alone it would be difficult to justify the title. But, after all, these are minor points. When all is said, it remains true that the reader will find here a collection of doctrines that are not only important in themnselves, but intimately connected, and certainly related to the Franciscan Oxford School. - In dealing with these doctrines, a strictly consistent scheme has been followed throughout the whole work. The author has selected a series of problems for detailed exposition and summarised the answers given to them by the above-mentioned philosophers: theory of becoming, types of becoming, matter in its static aspect, form in its static aspect, psychology, angelology, natural theology. By forcing upon every one of the philos- ophers the same series of que*tions, the book acquires an indisputable unity, but only at the cost of a somewhat excessive rigidity. It is only fair to say, however, that, the questions selected being crucial ones, the series of their answers amounts to a fairly complete inventory of each one of the philosophies considered. Let it be added that it is difficult to be more exacting than Miss Sharp in the selection and analysis of the material to be used in a work of the kind. No second-hand material is to be found in the whole book; all quotations are drawn from the original sources, even, as is the case with the almost unknown doctrine of Thomas of York, when they are elntirely manuscript. We have therefore to deal with a very valuable contribution to the knowledge of one of the most important phirosophical movements of 'the thirteenth century, or, rather, with an extremely useful collection of materials for the further study of that movement. It wo'uld be an impossible task to summnarise the conclusions of the book; in fact such a summary can be found in the last thirty-seven pages of the volume, and it is rather a catalogue of theses than a systematic interpretation of the Franciscan philosophy and its evolution. The personal outlook of the author is felt rather in casual observations, not infrequent and scattered throughout the whole book, than in any endeavour to reduce the mass of historical facts to some kind of intelligible unity. Some of these observations, interesting as they may be, will seem objectionable, and in need of qualification. For instance, can it be said oi Grosseteste that, throughout the De luce, where most of the 'light metaphysics ' is chiefly expounded, "the cosmogony of Genesis is disregarded " (p. 19, n. 1) ? Grosseteste himself would have been surprised by the statement. The very fact that we see him trying to explain the formation of the world by light alone shows us that what he means to give is a commentary on the third verse of Genesis: "And God said, Let there be light: and there was light." His interpretation of the text may be very loose, but he certainly does not mean to disregard it. In the same chapter (pp. 28-29) Grosseteste is treated as the first of the English School to suggest the theory of the plurality of forms; but the fact that he recognises a form of corporeity does not prove it, since this is a doctrine borrowed from Avicenna, where it does not imply a' real plurality of forms. Concerning Roger Bacon, it is rather hard to consider his Opus majus as containing a paraphrase of Roger Marston's Quacestio disputcttct (p. 162, n. 2). Of course, we are not quite sure of the dates, but the Opus mcajus was written between 1266 and 1268, whereas Roger Marston was still studying in Paris in 1270. Besides, it is enough to compare both texts to see that if there is a fragment inserted in one of them, it has been borrowed from Bacon, whose style is so easily reco-nisable and different from that of Roger Marston. Such 35</page><page sequence="9">522 NEW BOOKS. details, however, do not detract from the usefulness of Miss Sharp's doctrinal repertory; her book will certainly be very frequently quoted, and still more often used by historians who will forget to quote it. The truest kind of success indeed. E. GILSON. Reason and ,Nature: an Essay on the Meaning of Scientific Method. By MORRIS COHEN. Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner &amp; Co. .1931. 21s. Tins is a book of which it is not easy to give a succinct account. In plan it belongs to the type of the Einleitung in die Philosophie ; it covers a wide range of subjects-including mathematics, biology, the social sciences, jurisprudence, and ethics,-and in respect of each topic of which he treats Professor Cohen discusses the kind of knowledge at which, by rigorously adhering to philosophically disciplined methods of reasoning, we should aim and which we may hope to attain. On the other hand, it is not the author's object to explain to beginners what -philosophy is about; and if he addresses himself to 'thoughtful readers irrespective of their previous philosophic studies', and has 'therefore avoided technical terms so far as was consistent with substantial accuracy', he is very definitely concerned to expose prevalent errors, and to lead his readers, if not to embrace prescribed philosophical positions, at any rate to adopt a certain definite attitude towards all philosophical problems. That attitude is one of resolute loyalty to the processes of impartial reason.' '.Our reason may be a pitiful candle-light in the dark and boundless seas of being, but we have nothing better, and woe to those who wilfully try to put it out '. The chief forms of philosophical error against which, at the present day, it is necessary to wage war are, on the one hand, the belief that only " brute facts ', only particulars, whether conceived as physical or mental entities, 'are real (though surely nominalism of this kind is now somewhat out of fashion); and, on the other hand, the belief, to be encountered in many guises, that mysticism can furnish a key to the discovery of communicable knowledge. William James, Bergson, Croce, and Spengler are among the leading heresiarchs against whose anti-rational teaching Professor Cohen utters a warning. Unreason of the quasi-mystical type is much helped by the use of romantic and emotion-fraught words such as 'Life', 'Experience ', ' Reality ', ' Creative ', ' Constructive ', and ' Synthetic '. The plan of the book is as follows: Book I, under the rubric 'Reason and the Nature of Things ' deals in the first place with the ' insurgence against reason ' which the author finds to be characteristic of much modern speculation; and contains a general vindication of ' reason', against such rivals as tradition, authority, intuition, and instinct. Chapters III and IV, entitled respectively ' Reason and Scientific Method ', and ' the Metaphysics of Reason and Scientific Method', set forth in outline Professor Cohen's views on some of the main problems of logic, in relation to the discovery of scientific truth, such as Probability, Induction, and the a priori. A prinpiple to the impQrtance of which the author frequently recurs as a guide to rational thought is what he calls the 'principle of polarity', by which he means 'that opposites such as immediacy and mediation, unity and plurality, the fixed and the flux, substa'nce and function, ideal and real, actual and possible, etc., like the north (positive) and the south (negative) poles of a magnet, all involve each other when applied to any significant entity.' Book II trtats of 'Reason in Natural Science', and contains discussions</page><page sequence="10">NEW BOOKS. 523 of the nature of mathematics, 'mechanism and causality in Physics', 'Law and Purpose in biology ', and ' psychology in natural science'. The author insists that fidelity to the axiom that the world is rational does not exclude recognition that phenomena causally explained, and mathe- matical propositions strictly deduced, may yet and do actually contain novelty. Book III, treating of ' Reason in Social Science', contains discussions of the logical apparatus and postulates appropriate to history, jurisprudence, and ethics. Here, as in the earlier titles, Professor Cohen's primary con- cern is to attack all deviation from the ideal of impartial and un-tendencious rationalism. He insists with welcome vivacity upon the impossibility of deducing ' ought ' from ' is '; and gives expression to well-timed protests against the disservice rendered by the romanticism of the ' historical method ' to the criticism of existing institutions and to the cause of rational progress, particularly in the field of law. As those readers know who have enjoyed a previous acquaintance with Professor Cohen's writings, he possesses an exceptionally wide and pro- found acquaintance with subjects outside the domain of technical phil- osophy, and writes of mathematics, physics, and law with the confidence born of knowledge. His style is pointed, lucid, and epigrammatic; subjects present themselves to his mind in nut-shells rather than in bales. It was to be expected, then, that a book from the pen of an author so equipped, and covering so wide a field of discourse as the present work, would be, as this book undoubtedly is, interesting, and even remarkable. And yet it must be confessed that we have laid it down with some feeling of disappointment. We feel that we have enjoyed for some days the conversation of a very able, clear-minded, and well-informed man; that he has carried us along with him, engaging our interest, and, usually, our agreemeiit. But the conversation has, we feel, been somewhat too dis- cursive; we have been hurried past points where we should willingly have lingered; and we regret, for example, that on that evening when we were discussing Vitalism we did not sit up two hours later. M. S. A. The Living Mind: Essays on the Significance of Consciousness. By WARNER FITE. London, Williams &amp; Norgate, Ltd. Pp. ix + 317. lOs. 6d. WITH the exception of the first Essay, which serves as an introduction to the rest, this book is a republication of articles which appeared in the Philosophical Review, the Unpopular Review, the Journdl of Philosophy, the International Journal of Ethics, and the Atlantic Monthly, between 1908 and 1918. As all these periodicals are American, the Essays may be presumed to be hnw to the British public, and as they consistently expound a definite point of view they really form a book. It will be found, moreover, to be a book well worth reading. For the Princeton professor is one of the few philosophers who can write. He is also one of the few philosophers who has something to say. Consequently his writings may always con- fidently be commended to all who have an open mind, and are willing to enrich its contents. The particular point which Prof. Fite endeavours to drive home in this volume is that ' cQnsciousness ' is by no means the otiose and impotent fiction that makes no difference, to anything or anybody, which behaviour- ista feigns it to be, but the most real and important thing in the world, if it is treated, not as a vague abstraction, devoid of all specific reference to</page><page sequence="11">524 NEW BOOKS. anything real, but as essentially personal. Defining philosophy as " a study of the world in the light of the fact that the world is known ", Prof. Fite answers the next question, 'known by whom ? ' by declaring that all knowing is personal and pointing out that in the study of some things we have a choice between the attitude of the observer and of the agent. The physical sciences, no doubt, have to observe the behaviour of their objects from without, but the psychologist can 'introspect'; or rather can do better. For, strictly, " the introspector is as purely an external observer of what passes not in him but before him, as if he were reporting the behaviour of the lower animals "(p. 7). Unfortunately, " his' introspection' is no report of personal experience ". He reports " not what he sees but what he knows he ought to see on the basis of a scientific theory of correspondence between the inner world and the outer " (p. 10). From ,,the agent's point of view (which should not, strictly, be called a point of view at all, p. 49), on the other hand, "only the worlds of personal experience are real " and " everybody's world is mainly a convention, a modus vivendi invented for purposes of conversation and of concerted action, a world in which none of us really lives" (p. 15). The external observer's point of view is quietly presupposed in behaviourism, realism, the doctrine of external relations and the definition of consciousness as a relation (p. 282); but this attitude leaves it a mystery why consciousness should be con- sidered " worth any consideration whatever " (ibid.). i3ut " if we look for the object in some separable, impersonal, non-human,' and non- significant element, or 'entity', in our experience, we shall never find it" (p. 288), and for " the person who is conscious of an object, the meaning of an object is not extrinsic, or additional to, or separable from, the object itself " (p. 282). All this is not only well put, but also profound; it undermines not only a facile abstraction which is now growing irksome to the natural sciences that have, until recently, been able to work it, but also the phil- osophies and psychologies which have flattered,themselves that they could become 'scientific' by aping an incident in scientific method. Accord- ingly, Prof. Fite's final essay on 'The Human Soul and the Scientific Pre- possession' is full of delicious satire on these psychologies, and contains also an excellent dog-story on p. 310. The second essay, on 'The Agent and the Observer,' contrasting the former's view as logical and teleological, with the latter's as mechanical (p. 34), is also excellent, carries through this vital distinction with great skill and beautiful clearness. Moreover, Prof. Fite quite realizes that " the agent's view is, if you like, essentially anthropomorphic " nay 'automorphic' (p. 40), but proposes to substitute 'humanism' for 'anthropomorphism', a proposal which has my heartiest support. Altogether it seems to me highly desirable that philosophers and psychologists should radically reconsider a number of traditional assump- tions which they -have rashly taken as absolute, though the sciences had only used them methodologically. Thus the discovery that scientific 'laws' are only statistical seems to mean that determinism is to be taken as a methodological assumption, and not as a metaphysical fact. Ein- steinian Relativity means that the observer's standpoint cannot be taken for granted, but must be seriously taken into account. And Heisenberg's principle seems to mean that physics can no longer assume that the observer's aotion09 in knowing make no difference to the 'facts' observed. Thus the sciences are teaching a new philosophy to the philosophers, and showing them how to undo their initial abstractions, and how to transcend even so</page><page sequence="12">NEW BOOKS. 525 deep an antithesis as that between the observer and the agent. Only, instead of reducing the agent to an observer, as heretofore, science now shows us how the observer becomes an agent! F. C. S. SCMHLER. The Psychology of Intelligence and Will.' By H. Q. WYATT. London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner &amp; Co., Ltd. 1930. -Pp. viii + 273. 12s. 6d. net. AR. WYATT has written this book because he believes that psychologists are " strangely irrelevant or delusive " when thev deal with intelligence and volition. His purpose is to make " a reasoned protest against this practice of disparagement ". He develops his own analysis of intelligence by traversing the different theories of the Behaviouirists, the Gestalt psy- chologists, Thurstone, Thorndike and Spearman. He concludes that intelligence is the power of discovering, on any given occasion, such relations between percepts, imnages or concepts as are pertinent to the particular end which the individual is then seeking to attain. In discussing volition, which he extols as " the creation of motive" and as " pure self-activity or true initiative " (whose possession by man is " an immediate deliveralice of consciousness itself "), he considers the views of Wundt, James and others, and the questions whether volition i-s unique and whether the existence of free-will is compatible with the scientific character of psvehology. Con- cerning the relation between intelligence and volition, Mr. Wyatt maintains that " in the last analysis the two are fundamentally the same: they are life asserting itself as against non-life, life pushing ahead ".
