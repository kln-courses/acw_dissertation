      <p>What motivates primates to intentionally kill infants? The answers to this question are the basis for a long‐standing, sometimes heated primatological debate. However, Amanda Rees's curiosity lies not in answering <italic>this</italic> question <italic>per se</italic>, but rather in understanding how we, as primatologists, have come to explain it. Using the infanticide controversy as her springboard, the author provides a comprehensive and thoughtful sociological analysis of how scientists set out to understand the world around us, while simultaneously providing an engaging and compelling history of the field of primate behavioral studies.</p>
      <p>Rees begins by introducing modern field‐based primatological research, including its (relatively brief) history and goals, as well as highlighting some of its key limitations, particularly “fieldworker's regress,” the acknowledgement that “conclusions are inevitably partial and that not everything can be accounted for” (p. 212). Herein, the author takes the opportunity to set the stage for later chapters by addressing key issues integral to the infanticide debate, including: What constitutes a “natural” primate group? Is what we have observed the exception or the rule? Is the absence of evidence in fact evidence of absence? And is our interpretation of the evidence objective, or are we guilty of anthropomorphism, ascribing our own beliefs and motivations to behaviors observed in our study subjects?</p>
      <p>Rees then goes on to chronicle the controversy surrounding nonhuman primate infanticide from its initial documentation in the early 1960s and its first adaptive explanation presented in 1967 to its current standing as either a byproduct of male aggression, as per Bob Sussman and colleagues, or an adaptive reproductive strategy a lá Sarah Hrdy et al. Using this relatively recent primatological debate, Rees also more broadly examines the “art” of field science; how controversial explanations are sometimes initially received (in this case, they were both lauded and criticized), how they are perceived and how these perceptions change and evolve. Or do they?</p>
      <p>This book was expertly written, comprehensively researched, and presents a fascinating and insightful look into the ambiguities that plague field behavioral research. I would recommend this volume to both primatologists and field biologists.</p>
