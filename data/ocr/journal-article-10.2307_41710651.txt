With few exceptions, these 3,000 objects bore witness to a traditional, authentic Aboriginal past, with only occasional references to changes or dislocations brought about through European contact. A single exhibition case containing 'Articles of Native Workmanship in which Materials of Civilisation have been Used' served as a salutary warning, marking the boundaries of authenticity. Despite forming 'a class of objects' that, as Stirling's introductory label stated, 'have recently (1907-8) been made known by the late Revd J. G. Reuther, for many years Superintendent of the Lutheran Mission at Killalpaninna, situated on Cooper's Creek about 50 miles east of Lake Eyre', the toas were situated safely in the 'traditional' realm.2 Stirling's exhibition labels were typically written in an ahistorical form of museum prose that characterized ethnographic exhibitions well into the 1960s. That sense of time suspended, a pervading 'ethnographic present', was reinforced by the gallery's realistic dioramas containing manikins depicting scenes of Aboriginal life in southern and central Australia. The gallery powerfully underpinned the assumptions of ordinary visitors that Aboriginal people still made objects similar to those displayed, and still maintained a hunter-gatherer existence somewhere beyond the settled districts. Indeed, the Stirling installation retained that effect well beyond the normal lifespan of a museum gallery, not being dismantled until the mid- 1980s. The toas required a particular historical reference for the very reason that by 1914 it was generally assumed that all the main categories of Aboriginal material culture had been collected and described. The idea of a new class of objects appearing at this late stage required explanation, much as if a new species of kangaroo had suddenly appeared. 35</page><page sequence="2">Philip Jones Figure 1.

Each ochred sculpture, generally between fifteen to twenty-five centimetres tall, was mounted in a small black- painted plaster block, to which a small numbered label was fixed. These labels bore short paragraphs of text unlike any others in the gallery. Labels describing cases of boomerangs, shields, articles of dress, and so on, had little work to do beyond confirming these objects' evidentiary role in the gallery's key propositions of regional variety, diffusion, and evolution. These objects' actual function required little explication. Visitors needed only to approach a case and read headings such as 'Throwing Weapons', or 'Water Containers' to comprehend the objects within, readily associating form and design with apparent purpose. 36</page><page sequence="3">Carefully SculpturedWords The toa labels functioned very differently. In a gallery devoted almost entirely to the material culture of hunting, gathering, fighting, trade, ceremony, and adornment - and where objects filled the categories of matched actions as neatly as they confirmed the visitors' expectations - the toas required particular texts. For the closer the visitor approached, the more intriguing they became. Some seemed quite anthropomorphic - a hand, a foot, a leg waving in the air. Others had small pieces of vegetation, bone, stone, hair, or feathers attached to them, usually embedded in their bulbous gypsum heads. Many were painted with stripes or dots, both on the gypsum heads and over their red-ochred wooden shafts. Stirling's lengthy introductory label spoke only in general terms, confirming that the toas 'may be described as topographical, in the sense that each represents, and serves as an indicator or sign-post to, some particular locality'.3 To learn more, the visitor needed to step closer, to read the small paragraph of text fixed to the base of each toa. This small effort at comprehension, unrequired elsewhere in the gallery, may have provoked some visitors to consider that the gap in culture between Europeans and Aborigines was not entirely one of 'degrees of civilization', for these small texts contained hints of an entirely different, but coherent, world-view. Whether or not they had been bowdlerized by Reuther and by Stirling's re-rendering of them, the labels amounted to a consistent set of founding texts or creation stories. The only other objects in the gallery to convey any sense of the Aboriginal 'Dreaming' were sacred stone or wood tjurunga of the Arrernte people of Central Australia. However, the allusions to totemic ancestors in their accompanying labels were brief, with little of the toa texts' detail or flavour of Ancestral trajectories across the desert landscape. The function of the tjurunga as generic 'tablets' encapsulating sacred data relating to individual and group identity was conveyed easily by a simple framing text. In contrast, as Howard Morphy's later analysis made clear (see below), the toas were composed of at least three sign 'types'; they were not emblematic or generic objects and were not readily comprehensible to the visitor. Their individual texts were essential to their success as museum objects. These drew the visitors closer, reducing the scale of interaction so that the visitor focused on a single, quirky object, relating its symbolism to a particular moment in an ancestor's mythological trajectory across a distant arid landscape. Each text related a short episode centred on a particular place and on a particular mythological 'ancestor' responsible for naming or creating that place. Although it was not clear to the visitor, these places were all in the sandy or stony desert country east of Lake Eyre in north-eastern South Australia, dispersed across an area almost the size of France. Two examples of these texts, and their matching toas , are shown here (Figures 2-5) . Most of the toa labels began with the words, 'To where...' or 'To the place where...'. In this neat way, each label positioned its toa axiomatically as a signpost, before supplying the visual key or logic of the sign itself by explaining 37</page><page sequence="4">Philip Jones Figure 2.

This explanation was usually embedded within a short vignette or episode in the travels of a mura- mura or 'dreaming ancestor' who found, created, visited, or named the site. Museologically, this was a most satisfying exercise. Intrigued by a particular toa , a visitor gleaned the relevant detail from the label, and matched this to the object. The match provided a simple and direct, if circular, proof of the toa's validity. I recall discovering these alignments for myself as a young visitor to the gallery. 38</page><page sequence="5">Carefully SculpturedWords Figure 3.

The head of the Toa represents a steep hill on Cooper's Creek, which is overgrown with different kinds of bushes de- Picted rom this as hill, red in and wet seasons, yellow water spots, rom this hill, in wet seasons, water trickles, which was regarded as a spring by the Mura-mura, Patj alina, who named the place. This water flows into Cooper's Creek (coloured black), which is bordered by gum trees (white dots). RBÜTHBR COLLECTION (120^ The Problem For some visitors though, this circular logic of text reflecting object, and vice versa, surely raised more questions than it answered. Visitors may have wondered about the pertinent 'facts' conveyed by these labels. Who were these mura-muras ? What were their relations to each other and to the various 'tribes' identified on the labels? Why were apparently banal or unheroic events such as noticing a group of seated crows, or fetching water, inscribed into the landscape as place names? Only the German manuscripts of the toas ' collector, the Revd J. G. Reuther, could illuminate this. Reuther's manuscripts were partially translated during the 1930s, but it was not until 1981 that a published microfiche translation became available (Reuther 1981). Even then, few people made the effort to connect the mura- muras with the bewildering density of Reuther's gazetteer of 2,468 place names (in volume seven of the fourteen volumes), and to link these names and the ancestors with the toas themselves. One person who did attempt to reconcile Reuther's toas with his manuscripts was the art historian and anthropologist, Howard Morphy, who wrote his University of London M.Phil, thesis (Morphy 1972) on the toas , basing his analysis on colour photographs of one side of each toa , microfilm of sections of Reuther's manuscripts, arid photographs of H. J. Hillier's map of Reuther's sites, which included toa localities. Morphy later published a distillation of his main arguments (Morphy 1977). 39</page><page sequence="6">Philip Jones Figure 4.

Morphy's was a laudable, even heroic, attempt to analyse the highly variable, if not outright confusion of semiotic categories and variations represented by the toas , as though they were part of a consistent sign 'system' devised and developed by the Aboriginal people of eastern Lake Eyre. His main influences were the French semiotician Roland Barthes and the Chicago anthropologist Nancy Munn. Munn had successfully applied semiotic analysis to the iconography of Australian Western Desert sand drawings (see Munn 1962 and 1966; see also Munn 1973), and Morphy aimed to apply her methodology to eastern Central Australia. Critically, however, Morphy accepted without question Reuther's 40</page><page sequence="7">Carefully SculpturedWords Figure 5. The Stirling Gallery label for the toa illustrated in Figure 4.

REUTH ER COLLECTION (289). proposition that the toas were used systematically by Aboriginal people in pre-European times, opening his 1977 paper with the following statement (referenced to Stirling andWaite 1919): Toas are direction signs which signify particular localities and they were used by the Dieri and neighbouring tribes of the Lake Eyre region of Central Australia. They were stuck in the ground on departure from a camp in order to communicate the departing group's destination to anyone able to interpret them. (Morphy 1977: 77) Morphy was working with refined and complex models of sign systems, observing the Saussurean distinction between a sign's 'signifying components' and its actual 'meaning'. He allowed for the possibility that not all morphological components of the toas might operate as signifiers, or at least not in all cases. Whereas the skein of possibilities and variables generated by Morphy's close and careful analysis perhaps rendered a clear conclusion unlikely, the fact is that he was always working from an unstable premise. For unlike the tjurunga or sand-drawings of Central Australia, Reuther's toas were .certainly fabricated with at least some European intervention and influence. I have published a detailed exposition of this argument elsewhere (Jones 2007), making it clear that 41</page><page sequence="8">Philip Jones the toas cannot be taken as a coherent sign system rooted in pre-European time and logic. Morphy's analysis depended on a literal reading of Reuther's claims for the toas , leaving no room for the possibility that - even allowing for their incorporation of traditional symbolism and mythology - the toas were generated just once, as a single efflorescence during late 1903, within the boundaries of Reuther's own ethnographic and linguistic project. That said, Morphy's analysis has resulted in a useful typology of the toas that opens new possibilities for their reanalysis. The Toas It is time to examine the toas more closely. Figure 6 illustrates a representative selection of fifteen toas , incorporating the three main types mentioned above. Reading from left to right, here are condensed versions of Reuther's descriptions of each toa , and their ascribed meanings:4 1 . Mambudirkani: to the plain where Wittimarkani gathered seed in her Pirra (wooden bowl). As it was time to return to the camp, she placed it on her hip to carry it, but made the wrong movement and it fell to the ground. Toa = plain on Cooper Creek with cracked earth (red stripes). Dots = bushes or holes. 2. Wirkaripudlani: to the Wirkaripudla Plain where the two creeks join. Discovered by Godagodana. Red dots = small stones on upper part of plain (white). Yellow = soil on plain. Black = two creeks. 3. Kutirani: to a very crooked part of Cooper Creek, which Patjalina noticed on his travels. Toa = bed of Cooper Creek. Dots = gum trees standing in creek bed. 4. Manataulawuluni: to the plain where Kirlawuluni (Kirlawilina) saw the two wild ducks opening their beaks to quack. White = shape of plain and head of duck. Projections = beak of a duck quacking. 5. Manawilparamarani: to the plain where Wadlulana died with his mouth open, like a yawning man. Top = tree with a broken trunk. White knob = plain, overgrown with bushes (red dots). 6. Pirrapirrani: to the flat, ringed by a sandhill, where the two mura-muras , Putantara, camped. 7. Tampangaraterkanani: to the lake where Mandramankana saw many pelicans standing. Top = head of pelican. White = lake. 8. Ngurluwarilani: to the plain on Cooper's Creek, which Darana named after Ngurluwarila, one of his dogs. Stripes = cracks on plain in dry season. White band = plain. 9. Ngantiburanani: to where Karuwontirina saw two emus sleeping behind a bush. Toa - shape of emu. Yellow dots = ribs. 1 0. Panjiworduni: to the plain overgrown with Palpuru bushes, where Mardalbuluna camped. He met people there who used finely pointed emu bones to dig out prickles from their feet. Top = bone. White = plain. Red dots = Palpuru bushes. 1 1 . Womamokuni: to the creek that Billipilpana noticed was shaped like a snake's skeleton, which he found on the plain nearby. Smaller creeks joining the main 42</page><page sequence="9">Carefully SculpturedWords Figure 6. Fifteen toas from Reuther's collection , representing the three main 'sign types' . Courtesy and copyright , South Australian Museum . creek resembled the snake's ribs. 7oa = backbone and ribs of snake. Red dots = trees on lower part of plain, where water lies after rain. 12. Ngatjinani: to the hill where Kirliwilina implored his uncle to let him chase after the girls who lived there. Toa = hill resembling a human head. Red = red soil. White = chalky soil. Eyes, mouth and nostrils = caves in which the girls hid from Kirliwilina. 13. Witjikurawinpani: to the sandhill on Cooper Creek where Patjalina came while hunting. A whirlwind had obliterated animal tracks and swept debris together. White knob = sandhill. Red dots = bushes. Black lateral stripe = Cooper Creek. Black vertical stripe = deep waterhole at base of sandhill. Yellow = sand. Dots = gums. 14. Idiburinani: to the plain where Darana and his men plucked out the hairs of their beards. White = plain. Top = tail feathers or hair. 15. Paruwalpani: to Lake Kirlawilpa (Killalpaninna itself, the site of the mission where the toas were made), where Pitikipana once found many fish dying from brackish water. He spread them along the shore for later consumption. Morphy identified three main 'sign types' among the toas, which are represented in Figure 6. Type 1 comprises toas with attachments symbolizing their sites, as represented by numbers 10 and 14. Type 2 comprises toas shaped and painted to symbolize a site's distinctive characteristics, as in numbers 1, 3, 4-9, 11, 43</page><page sequence="10">Philip Jones 12, and 16. Type 3 comprises toas with painted symbols indicating sites, as represented by two examples, numbers 2 and 13. Despite their distinctive differences, Morphy observed that types 1 and 2 'operate similarly as signs as far as the degree of specificity of the meaning is concerned, and on this basis can be considered a single type in opposition to type (3)' (Morphy 1977: 80; see also Jones and Sutton 1986: 14-15). Morphy devoted a considerable part of his discussion to the type 3 toas , noting that in contrast to the specificity of meaning associated with types 1 and 2, type 3 'consists of a limited number of signifiers, each of which can signify a range of possible meanings' (Morphy 1977: 82). Such a system had been observed in the Western Desert by Nancy Munn, who had termed it a 'discontinuous meaning system' (Munn 1966: 937). Strangely though, Morphy did not ponder the question why the Diyari and related groups might have applied two apparently incompatible 'meaning systems' (continuous in the case of types 1 and 2 and discontinuous in the case of type 3) to a specialized set of material culture objects charged with transmitting meaning in essentially secular settings. Since Peter Sutton and I published an account of the toas in Art and Land in the mid 1980s (see Jones and Sutton 1986), my continuing investigations have teased out the logical inconsistencies in Reuther's characterization. In the case of type 1 toas , for example, it seems absurd for the toa-maker to have attached distinctive elements - such as pieces of vegetation found only at the destination - before actually setting off for that destination. In addition, type 1 and 2 toas are often made with a degree of complexity and elaboration completely at odds with what is known of desert people on the move. This has been demonstrated by X-ray images of particular toas (see Jones and Sutton 1986: 65) and more recently, by CAT-scan images that reveal a multistage process in applying the wet gypsum 'heads' to the toas (see Figures 7-9). While ochres, wood, and fibre string were part of the ordinary kit of eastern Lake Eyre people, gypsum or pipe-clay supplies were not, being associated primarily with ceremonial activity. Much of the region where ltoa sites' occur is in sandy desert, with no ready access to supplies of gypsum. This substance required careful processing before it could be applied as a thick plaster to the toas. These factors, and the construction of the toas as revealed by close analysis, supports the proposition contained in archival documents, that they were made at Killalpaninna mission over the period of a few weeks during late 1903 (see Jones 2007: 225-83). Even so, I have been reluctant to subscribe completely to the withering assessment of the toas provided during the 1930s by ex-policeman and ethnographer George Aiston. Living on the Birdsville Track,- just a few miles from Killalpaninna, he came to know several of the Wangkanguru and Diyari people who had been at the mission when the toas were made (see Jones 1993, 201 1). In his correspondence with the Melbourne collector W. H. Gill, Aiston made two pointed remarks. On 18 May 1930 he wrote: 44</page><page sequence="11">Carefully SculpturedWords Figure 7. X-ray image and photograph of toa representing Lake Gregory, confirming mortice- and-tenon carpentry join through the central shaft; 400 mm high; collection of the South Australian Museum (A70020; Reuther 20, Jones and Sutton 1986: 122, cat. 335).

Our blacks did not carve idols in wood, although the German Missionaries collected a lot of what they called toas, these were images and figures representing various waterholes and the Mooras who looked after them. But the blacks who made them for the missionaries told me that the missionaries supplied the designs and got the blacks to make them, neither I nor any of my black friends had ever heard of them until they were made for the Missionaries.5 Aiston was even more forthright eight years later, writing: 'the great Toa hoax was got up by one of the teachers who is now at Hermannsburg - he suggested the designs and supervised the making of those toas - a thing totally unknown to any of the tribesmen in this country'.6 In an earlier published reference to the toas, Aiston had been gender, if rather more wry: 'The shaped sticks stuck into the sand on departure and spoken of as toas were not known by the old men of the Wonkonguru. These would have been most useful, as they described the destination sought' (Home and Aiston 1924: 26). The Melbourne ethnographer and stone tool collector A. S. Kenyon was active during the period 1900-1930. He had become aware of the small industry in Aboriginal artefacts emerging in north-eastern South Australia at the close of 45</page><page sequence="12">Philip Jones Figure 8.

In a tantalizingly brief reference to toas he wrote to Edgar Waite, Stirling's successor as director of the museum in May 1920: 'I should be specially pleased to get the "Record" containing the Toa's [sic] article as their use as given in the annual report for 07/8 conflicted with the accounts given me by men who had lived among those tribes'.7 A month later, in another short letter, Kenyon wrote: 'I shall be glad if you would forward me the one with the article on Toas... I trust you have noted my doubt about the genuineness of those implements. In Melbourne there is a continued supply of spurious implements from the same locality'.8 In the absence of any known supporting or corroborating statements to validate Reuther's claims for the toas, these two critiques seem devastating 46</page><page sequence="13">Carefully SculpturedWords Figure 9. CAT-scan of toa illustrated in Figure 8, showing two- stage application of moulded gypsum around shaft (using string as reinforcement). Courtesy and copyright, Peter Bitas. enough; though neither Aiston nor Kenyon repudiated the toas publicly and no doubt was cast on them by other museums. Museum exhibitions during the early and mid-twentieth centuries had a way of accruing authority simply through inertia, and this was certainly the case with the South Australian Museum. Moreover, unless judged to be outright fakes, the notion of 'inauthentic' ethnographic objects became increasingly problematic, particularly as Aboriginal identity gradually broadened during the late twentieth century to include people of mixed descent, and as notions of syncretism and innovation came into favour. But there are two other key reasons for not writing the toas off as 'inauthentic'. The first reason is initially compelling. This is that each of the toas represents a documented place and is associated with a verifiable fragment of mythology Al</page><page sequence="14">Philip Jones linked to that place. These links are apparent not only in Reuther's manuscript, but have been verified through the intensive research of the linguist Luise Hercus (see, for example, Hercus 1987), and through other published sources. That said, it is certainly possible that Reuther - either on his own, or in partnership with the schoolteachers H. J. Hillier and A. Vogelsang (both of whom later worked at Hermannsburg, as noted by Aiston) - may have used his place-name manuscript as the basis for concocting and manufacturing toas on the mission. With its description of sites and their characteristics, and the mythological events occurring there, it would not have been difficult to turn out one toa after another, with varying degrees of involvement of the European and Aboriginal participants. The second reason also appears compelling, at first. This relates to the incidence of the 'type 3' toas , as noted by Morphy, distinguished by the painted symbols on the main 'blade'. As noted above, Morphy drew on the observations of Nancy Munn, who had analysed Warlpiri sand-drawings that were also distinguished by a limited number of signifiers with a range of possible meanings, comprising a 'discontinuous meaning system'. Morphy noted that such type 3 toas were in the minority in Reuther's collection, but did not pursue the possible link between these toas and the phenomenon ofWestern Desert graphic traditions, either in sand-drawings or in the Arrernte tjurunga, for example. Yet it is very likely that such a link exists, for many of the type 3 toas bear a strong resemblance, both in their form and iconography, to the tjurunga of Central Australia. In their wooden form, tjurunga were distributed as far east as Cooper's Creek and the Birdsville Track in north-eastern South Australia. The tjurunga may have been one key influence on the type 3 toas , but an even likelier influence was that of the decorated boards worn vertically as headgear by ceremonial performers. This form of headgear was more typical of the Arrernte region, with examples recorded photographically by such researchers as F.J. Gillen andW. B. Spencer (see, for example, Spencer and Gillen 1927: fig. 50 opp. 156). As with the tjurunga, it is likely that use of this headgear also spread to the eastern Lake Eyre region. These decorated boards could be as long as three or four feet. Their front faces were painted with black figures, outlined with white dots, against a red-ochre ground, and the boards were often surmounted by feathers. The boards were strapped to the head by means of hair-string, usually thickly coated with wet gypsum, which set hard - another element found on the toas. Few of these items were collected in the colonial period, but they were used in the Lake Eyre region - and there was one in Reuther's ethnographic collection. An unremarked fact is that while type 3 toas form only about a sixth of Reuther's total collection, they comprise more than a third of the first 100 he numbered and described, and all of the first ten, as illustrated by H. J. Hillier in his series of watercolour sketches of Reuther's ethnographic collection (see Figure 10). Indeed, we could propose that these ten stand as the prototypes for his toa collection, and if this is so it may well explain how these apparently 48</page><page sequence="15">Carefully SculpturedWords Figure 1 0. The first sheet of H. J. Hillier's watercolour sketches of Reuther's toas, showing the preponderance of 'type 3'; note the resemblance to no. 405 in Figure 1 1.

The item of 'ceremonial regalia' listed and described as No. 405 in Reuther's collection (see Figure 11) offers a clue to how the toas may have emerged. This object was worn in an 'increase ceremony' to ensure the continued supply of kapiri (goannas). It conforms with the ceremonial headgear described in more detail for the Arrernte by Spencer and Gillen (Spencer and Gillen 1927: 156-7); but it also conforms, quite precisely, with the Reuther toas illustrated in Figure 10 here. Number 10, for example (see also Jones and Sutton 1986: 82, no. 1), represents Maltara, 'a plain surrounded by sandhills where Billipilpinna made a decoration of emu feathers'. Number 3 (see also Jones and Sutton 1986: 91, no. 80) is another key example, for the traditional ceremonial designs on this particular toa were recognized during a visit to the South Australian Museum by the Diyari man Andreas Dibana during the early 1940s. The anthropologist Ronald Berndt describes the moment: On one occasion, when I was sitting with him and Vogelsang in our accustomed place, on the floor in the north-eastern corner of the gallery, recording the Muramura 49</page><page sequence="16">Philip Jones Figure 11.

Gadimargara (Katimarkara) myth, Dibana jumped up and hurried over to the case of toas. Excitedly, he pointed to one... which, he told me, was associated with his father's father, aThirrari man who married a Diyari widow. To Dibana there was no question but that this toa was a traditional object; he went on to tell me that, as he was describing the Gadimargara myth, there was the country to which he referred! (Berndt 1986: 7; original emphasis) It is not too fanciful to imagine Reuther collecting an item of ceremonial regalia, enquiring about its significance and finding that it represented (indicated) a particular site. Extending his enquiries, and finding that all sites with ceremonial connections could be represented by objects conforming to 'sign type 3', he may have realised that it was possible to collect a series of such objects, each just as indicative of a site. As production began, the idea of making or commissioning toas to reflect the 'stories' and characteristics he had recorded for those sites might easily have resulted in a diversification of styles and a gradual but observable 'miniatuarization' of the toas.9 Finally, as the evidence from the X-rays and CAT-scans seems to make plain, the process came to involve Europeans, such as the artist-cum-schoolteacher Harry Hillier who - George Alston claimed - 'suggested the designs and supervised the making' of the toas. 50</page><page sequence="17">Carefully SculpturedWords Such an hypothesis accounts for the genesis of the toas , but it also allows for the possibility that Reuther understood the Aboriginal explanation of an object's iconography and its link to a site as an insight into how such objects might be 'read', by anyone happening upon them. Certainly, within a short time Reuther had formulated two propositions for these objects, by which toas would become identified. The first involved realigning the 'signifying' qualities of the object to become its main purpose, so that it was no longer a ceremonial object affirming a link with a Dreaming place or identity, but had become a sign to that place. The second was to elevate the rather haphazard collection of these signs and symbols to the status of a 'picture language'. Reuther made this claim more than once: in his own manuscript description and in the first document confirming the appearance of the toas; that is, in a letter dated March 1904 to his mission superior Pastor Kaibel, head of the mission committee at Light Pass, north of Adelaide: What do you think for instance when I tell you that the natives know a 'picture script' drawn in colour on to wooden sticks, and that I have about 300 of these in my hands? Has anybody ever found anything like that in connection with the Australian natives? The religion of the natives is much the same as this 'picture script'.10 A 'picture script' implies something akin to the exciting discovery of Linear B by Arthur Evans at Knossos, in 1900 - involving a varied collection of characters - rather than a standard series of type 3 boards with their 'limited number of signifiers'. In 1903 there were very good reasons for Reuther, as he built a collection for sale, to extend the range of toas into types 1 and 2. If the sequence revealed by Reuther's own manuscripts is reliable, his toas began to depart from the type 3 format as soon as barely ten of these had been made. Toas were being fashioned in sculptural form, to depict specific behaviours or actions, animals, plants, and human attributes. These figurative representations were undoubtedly influenced, if not directly generated, by Europeans on the mission, for it is clear enough that such forms did not exist in the pre-European material culture (see Jones 2007). It is probably at this point that Aiston's proposition of a hoax begins to apply, but even then, Reuther was careful to pepper his collection with a number of type 3 toas , and to always ensure that, whatever form they took, the toas referred to the documented sites. To return to a consideration of Reuther's words and texts, it is useful to make a comparison of the place-name description in volume seven of Reuther's manuscript with the description of the same place in volume twelve, the toa volume. Some interesting inconsistencies emerge. Taking the series of fifteen toas illustrated in Figure 6 here, for example, we find that nine of the fifteen toa descriptions propose a different mura-mura from those named in volume seven. In several cases Reuther's description of events at the sites vary significantly. Much more careful work is required to analyse these variations. 51</page><page sequence="18">Philip Jones As Luise Hercus informs me, the mura-muras had their own nicknames and euphemisms, and it is possible that these were applied in some contexts and not others, accounting for the variation. But the opportunity exists for an entirely fresh exercise in semiotics and textual analysis, involving an analysis of the toas as visual depictions of the site descriptions contained in volumes seven and twelve. Might it be possible to see the toas as 'enactments' of the place-name entries in volume seven, with their descriptions in volume twelve applied later, after the toas had been made? Conclusion The toas beg many questions. Nearly forty years after Howard Morphy first examined them as a sign system, it is fair to say that they remain enigmatic. Reuther's passion for words, names, and etymology probably provoked the toas into existence, or shifted them from one category - as ceremonial paraphernalia representing or depicting sites, to another - in which their primary role became defined indicatively as 'signposts'. The toas came into existence at a time when there simply was no category of 'Aboriginal art' in museums. Whether it was Europeans or Aboriginal people at Killalpaninna who played the leading role in extending the range and scope of these objects into the figurative, sculptural domain, the museum response was circumscribed. They were interpreted necessarily as functional objects, previously unnoticed by ethnographers, and Reuther's definition of them as signposts constituting a 'picture script' formed the basis of their first modern scrutiny, by a pioneer in Aboriginal art and semiotics. From the very beginning of their museum presence, unveiled as one of the new ethnographic gallery's key exhibits, the toas were presented with their accompanying texts. In fact, as outlined in this paper, it would not have been feasible to exhibit the toas without those texts. But it has not been clear, until recently, that the toas were a product of Reuther's texts, tangible elaborations of place names that he had invested with a particular dynamic gained from his exposure to the Aboriginal Dreaming and its cast of characters, gestures, and symbols.

The complete collection of toas acquired by the South Australian Museum in 1 907 amounted to 404. Several of these were judged to be 'duplicates'. Four were exchanged with the Canterbury Museum, Christchurch, and a further twelve were exchanged with the Australian Museum, Sydney. A number of toas were unfit for display. See Jones and Sutton 1986: 79. 2. From the first paragraph of the introductory label; South Australian Museum, Anthropology Archives, AA298, Stirling Gallery exhibition labels, 'Toas'. This text was taken from Stirling's posthumously published article on the toas ; see Stirling and Waite 1919: 111-12. 3. As note 2. 4. These descriptions are based upon those used in Jones and Sutton 1986, edited by the present author from the translations of J. G. Reuther's original descriptions contained in both volumes 12 and 13 of his manuscript (Reuther 1981), and retaining Reuther's original spellings. 5. George Aiston to Walter H.

One other, small collection of toas is known, but these also derive from Killalpaninna, or from Aboriginal people who may have been involved in making them for Reuther. These were collected at the sister mission of Hermannsburg by the Lutheran missionary Oskar Liebler, in 1910-1913. See Jones 2007: 273-6. 9. The first ten Reuther toas are an order of magnitude larger than most of the subsequent ones, particularly those of types 2 and 3. The first ten toas average more than 35 inches (900 mm) in length, in contrast to an average length of 1 5 inches (400 mm) for the remainder of the collection. 10.
