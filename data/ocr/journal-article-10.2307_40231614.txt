Baier writes, 'Gauthier rightly sees the dangers of exploitation and subjection in- herent in a kin-based and affection-dependent morality, so purports to try for something totally different. Even if our moral natures can- not recognize themselves in Gauthier's version of them, the problem that drives the attempt [for an individualist and unsentimental moral- ity] is a real one, and so far, I think, an unsolved one; unsolved for morality as well as for moral theory.' Hampton writes, 'Gauthier will point out that anyone who insists that a human being has objective value must develop a theory that will not only justify that claim but also explain what reason one would ever have for respecting this value. I believe this is a challenge one has no choice but to accept, given what the moral facts are.' Morals by Agreement is an attempt to challenge Nietzsche's presci- ent remark, 'As the will to truth ... gains self-consciousness ... morali- ty will gradually perish.'1 It is an attempt to write moral theory for adults, for persons who live consciously in a post-anthropomorphic, post-theocentric, post-technocratic world. It is an attempt to allay the fear, or suspicion, or hope, that without a foundation in objective value or objective reason, in sympathy or sociality, the moral enterprise must fail. Peter Danielson correctly recognizes that it represents morality as * A comment on reviews of Morals by Agreement (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1986) by Annette Baier, Peter Danielson. and Jean Hampton. 1 Friedrich Nietzsche, On the Genealogy of Morals, tr.

Many of the details of the construction may be mistaken. Indeed, if my approach to morality is as radical as I claim it to be, then it would stretch credibility to suppose that Morals by Agreement contains more than a crude sketch of an adequate moral theory. Even so, I am present- ly disposed to defend most of the details, and will try to meet the criti- cisms of my reviewers. But I am more concerned to advocate an approach. And so I find myself at very different distances from my three critics. Danielson does not reject my approach (and I am tempt- ed to think that he accepts it); perhaps to strengthen it, he proposes plausible alternatives to two of the three principal components of my theory - to the proviso, and to constrained maximization. And he might be right. Hampton would like to reincorporate contractarian- ism into a more familiar, Kantian framework (and so I must resist what may seem friendly overtures); however she is unwilling to accept in the reincorporation the other principal component of my theory - the principle governing agreement, minimax rational concession. I think she is wrong. Baier, like Danielson, is unconvinced by the proviso (al- though her worries are very different from his), but her real unease seems to be with the spirit of the enterprise. 'For the rest of us,' she says, and proceeds to list a very motley crew indeed, 'another basis for another possibly less modest morality will have to be found/ Have to be found? All she need do is give us, or point us in the direction of, the resources required for its construction. Since Hampton does not develop an argument in support of objec- tive value or objective reasons for action, she leaves me with nothing to answer in defence of the subjectivist and relativist account of value, and the instrumental account of rationality, that underlie my moral theory. Hampton claims that without objective value I sometimes get 'unintuitive and unacceptable results.' Since I agree with J.L. Mackie that our traditional moral views have been formed on the presupposi- tion of objective value, it does not surprise me, and should not sur- prise the reader, that some of my conclusions conflict with what still may seem intuitively true.2 As for unacceptability, I can say only that I find myself compelled to follow the argument where it leads. To understand the problem that, as I see it, faces morality and moral theory, let me sketch a view of human agency. I suppose that the best explanation of the behaviour of fairly sophisticated animals, such as the higher mammals, some birds and cephalopods, will postulate be- 2 See J.L. Mackie, Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong (Harmonds worth: Penguin 1977) 23-4, 30.</page><page sequence="3">Moral Artifice 387 liefs and desires. The animal acts to fulfil its occurrent desires, given its equally occurrent beliefs. Human beings differ from other animals primarily in their capacity to represent their beliefs and desires to them- selves; human beings are, we might say, semantic animals. This capaci- ty frees the animal from the narrow temporal horizons of occurrent desires and beliefs. It also brings it face to face with the relation among its various beliefs and desires. The task of unifying beliefs and desires into a coherent whole is thrust upon it, and, as Kant recognized, unifi- cation is the sphere of rationality. And this task is, of course, what Hume overlooked in his account of the self; the sense of self is the sense of a unified whole of beliefs and desires. In order to bring beliefs and desires into coherence, the animal must be able to weigh its various representations, to modify and adjust, reject and endorse. Rationality has a reflective role, and the distance afforded by reflection gives the animal its sense of autonomy, of determining what it believes and desires. And this confirms its sense of self. The capacity to represent beliefs and desires enters centrally into agency. We explain characteristically human behaviour, not in terms simply of beliefs and desires, but in terms of representations of beliefs and desires. We think of the agent as deliberating about possible ac- tions in the light of her represented beliefs and desires, and acting in accordance with her deliberation. Indeed, we explain characteristical- ly human behaviour in terms of representations of states of affairs that are the objects of a range of intentional attitudes, belief and desire being but two. Thus a person may, in deliberating, take herself to have a reason to bring about some state of affairs, or a reason to act in the light of some state of affairs, without the represented state of affairs entering in any direct way into her desires. The capacity to act in the light of what the agent takes to be reasons, although freeing her from the direct dependence of her actions on her occurrent desires, exposes her to what we may identify as false consciousness, the dependence of her actions on represented states of affairs that do not enter into the set of beliefs and desires established by the unifying and reflective ex- ercise of her rationality. In this sketch I have referred to beliefs and desires, not to emotions. Yet the capacity for feeling that human beings share with at least the higher vertebrates and cephalopods also provides material for represen- tation. And in the explanation of human behaviour we postulate emo- tions and representations of emotions as motivationally significant. In Morals by Agreement I endeavour to treat the practical role of desire and emotion together, in terms of preference. The resulting simplification yields a theory that not only treats morality as artifice, but that is most easily applicable to artif actual agents possessing a deliberative but not an affective capacity. For such agents, constraint poses only an institu-</page><page sequence="4">388 David Gauthier tional problem - how to design the deliberative capacity so that it is guided by the principle of minimax relative concession. The accom- modation given to the affections in the last two chapters of Morals by Agreement then appears as an attempt to harness their potentially sub- versive force to the service of preference-driven rationality. A less sim- plified theory would accommodate affective capacities structurally. It would reveal the artifice of the human heart. But I shall remain here largely within the framework of beliefs and desires, and their representations. The exercise of rationality gives rise to the sense of self; it also creates the individual. For in deliberating in the light of her epistemic and conative representations of states of affairs, the agent determines for herself the reasons on which she acts. Although in practice what she takes as reasons will largely confirm and be confirmed by what those with whom she interacts take as rea- sons, what is decisive is her own determination. And in determining her own reasons, the agent establishes her individuality. Even if, as may plausibly be supposed, her capacities for semantic representation and deliberation would be unrealized except in a social context, in deliberating she transcends that context. These remarks are programmatic. But they should suffice to indi- cate the problem facing morality. In the Biblical/Kantian perspective from which we understand morality, moral reasons are constraints on the agent's deliberation, curbing her pursuit of whatever she may pre- fer. They are, or at least seem to be, determined independently of the nexus of reflectively endorsed belief and desire constituted by render- ing her representations coherent. Why should such considerations mat- ter to the agent, when they conflict with the reasons delivered by reflection on her preferences? Why then are they not a part of false consciousness - considerations that only masquerade as reasons for acting? Why are they not to be rejected, as destructive of her in- dividuality? To view morality as part of false consciousness need not be to view it uncharitably. The problem created by the emergence of individuali- ty among beings who depend on society for their development and survival must not be underestimated. The survival and flourishing of any human society makes demands on each member that she may not choose to recognize. The imposition of external constraints is costly; if she can be induced to accept internalized moral constraints, then society and individual are reconciled. But once morality is seen in this light, its imposture seems evident. The apparatus that was needed for it to secure its hold - a divine order, or an objective rationality or value independent of individual preferences - finds no place in our sketch of human agency. In Morals by Agreement I seek an alternative appara- tus, using only the materials in that sketch, and appealing only to the</page><page sequence="5">Moral Artifice 389 individual's deliberative rationality. The resources are spare; they do not permit the construction of Baier's 'stronger and more generous morality.' The result may not inspire, but the question is rather, does it suffice? Suffice for what? Think of the state of affairs that would exist, were each person to act strictly to advance the concerns that she, as an in- dividual, reflectively endorses as part of her unified self. If, following in a long tradition, we call this state of affairs, with Hobbes, the natu- ral condition of humankind, or more generally the state of nature, we emphasize, correctly, the absence of all social constraint, whether in- ternalized (moral) or external (political), but we ignore, misleadingly, the fact that only highly socialized beings would develop the capaci- ties requisite for them so to act. Nevertheless, I shall speak, here as elsewhere, of the state of nature. In the state of nature, then, each in- dividual seeks straightforwardly to advance whatever seems best to her. And, as is now well known, the outcome of interaction among such beings is, in many situations, mutually disadvantageous; every- one would benefit were everyone to exercise appropriate restraint in advancing her goals. Hobbes posed a political solution to this prob- lem; let each person continue to advance her interests, but under coer- cively maintained conditions that prevent mutual disadvantage. Advocates of the free market pose an economic/structural solution; let each person continue to advance her interests, but in free market con- ditions of perfect competition in which the outcome is demonstrably optimal. I seek to develop a moral solution; let each person internal- ize a principle of action that, followed by everyone, leads to an out- come that is both optimal and fair, in receiving the voluntary agreement of all. A morality then suffices if it can pass three tests: (i) is it rational for each individual to dispose herself to act in accordance with it (the com- pliance test); (ii) is it rational for each individual voluntarily to agree to it provided others do so as well (the contractarian test); (iii) if every- one acts in accordance with it, is the outcome optimal (the efficiency test). The tests are not, of course, altogether independent. But they bring out the three facets of morality that I want to emphasize. Failing the compliance test would reveal morality as an imposture, having no hold on the reflectively rational agent. Failing the contractarian test would reveal morality as a system of domination, coercively rather than voluntarily imposed on some agents. Failing the efficiency test would reveal morality as inadequate to overcome the structural problem of suboptimality in natural interaction. If a system passes all three, then, as the advertisement says, who could ask for anything more? I turn now to a more detailed discussion of some of the concerns advanced by Baier, Danielson, and Hampton. I shall proceed largely</page><page sequence="6">390 David Gauthier in the order of Morals by Agreement. In the next section, I shall take up Hampton's objections to the principle of rational agreement, mini- max relative concession. In the third section, I shall consider Daniel- son's defence of reciprocal cooperation against constrained cooperation. In the fourth and fifth sections I shall discuss objections to the proviso raised by Baier and Danielson; the latter will lead me to reevaluate the place of the market in my argument. Then in the sixth section I shall consider Hampton's identification of a Rawlsian turn in my appeal to the Archimedean point. I shall conclude with some remarks, stimu- lated by Baier, on the moral affections. II A just society, I claim, embodies the principle of minimax relative con- cession (MRC) in its institutions and practices.3 This is not to say that MRC need always be directly involved. I do not attempt to deal with the relation between macrolevel fulfillment of MRC and microlevel prin- ciples for interaction in Morals by Agreement. But it is evident that a cooperative arrangement among the members of a certain sub-group within society that satisfies MRC - an agreement, say, determining shares in the 'cooperative surplus' capturable by a producer's cartel - might give those persons more than their fair share (as determined by MRC) of the overall social cooperative surplus. An arrangement that satisfies MRC is procedurally fair among those persons party to it. But overall justice within society makes other demands on many arrange- ments; a fair trial is not procedurally fair among those - judge, jury, prosecutor, defendant, witnesses - party to it. But is MRC fair? Hampton expands on the case of Mabel and Abel.4 Abel has $400 to invest and Mabel $600; investments under $700 earn 5% and those of $700 and more earn 10%. Their options are restricted to investing separately, or pooling some or all of their funds and in- vesting those funds jointly. Alternative investment partners are un- available. The cooperative surplus is the difference between the gains from individual investment and those from full joint investment, or $50, and MRC requires its even division between the partners. Hence Abel ends up gaining $45 (a rate of return of 11 1/9%) and Mabel $55 (a rate of return of 9 1/6%). Isn't this unfair? Since the rate of return 3 The principle is stated in Morals by Agreement, 145. 1 Morals by Agreement, 140-1</page><page sequence="7">Moral Artifice 391 on their pooled funds is 10%, shouldn't Abel gain $40 and Mabel $60? Shouldn't we appeal to a proportionality principle to divide the cooper- ative surplus, rather than to MRC? Mabel and Abel are each dependent on the other to realize any of the cooperative surplus. This dependence is not only financial. It is true that there is no surplus to be realized if their combined funds for investment fall short of $700. But in addition to their funds, their agree- ment is also necessary if the surplus is to be realized. And this depen- dence on agreement is what defeats the claim that a fair outcome would give each the same rate of return on total investment. The situation of Mabel and Abel is structurally equivalent to one in which they are jointly offered $50, provided they can agree on how to divide it be- tween them. The obvious point of agreement, dictated by MRC and surely by any plausible principle for bargaining, yields each $25. If, independently, Mabel has $600 to invest and Abel $400, with a rate of return of 5%, then Mabel will end up gaining $55 and Abel $45. And this is exactly the outcome yielded by applying MRC. By distinguish- ing the contribution each makes through agreement from the contri- bution each makes merely through investment, and relating the total return to both of these, we arrive at our solution. Hampton proposes that we consider the situation as one in which initially Mabel and Abel each has $400 to invest, by pooling their in- vestments they realize a total of $80 rather than $40, and MRC divides the cooperative surplus equally between them. Now, Hampton says, let Mabel invest $200 more; MRC gives Abel $5 of the $20 Mabel's in- vestment earns, 'despite the fact that he has done nothing for it. So Abel is being allowed to benefit from her contribution in exactly the way Gauthier said was a sign of a partial system of distribution.' But David Copp (as represented by Hampton in her n. 7) makes the proper re- sponse: 'Mabel couldn't earn the $20 without Abel's help, but could only earn $10.' Hampton ignores the contribution Abel makes through his agreement. As long as Mabel does not have $700 of her own to invest, then each of her dollars gets a return of only 5% unless Abel agrees to admit it to their pooled funds. Abel's argument is not, as Hampton supposes, 'that his $400 should be "counted" in determin- ing his share of the profits more than once if his partner contributes more than he does.' As long as his agreement is both necessary and suffi- cient to double the return on any dollar invested by Mabel, then he can bargain with her over the distribution of that increase in return, and reasonably claim half. The size of their two contributions, either in dollars or in relation to each other, as long as they are within the limits laid down by the requirement that Abel's agreement be neces- sary and sufficient, is immaterial.</page><page sequence="8">392 David Gauthier Let me illustrate the impact of MRC in its most dramatic form. Sup- pose that Mabel has $700.01, and Abel has $699.99. Rounding to the nearest cent, Mabel gets a return of $70 and Abel $35. There is a poten- tial cooperative surplus of $35, realizable if, in effect, Mabel sells Abel one cent in return for a share in the surplus. Assuming, as Hampton stipulates, that there is no other source of money available, then MRC requires, what seems to me plainly rational, that Abel must promise Mabel half or $17.50 from his increased return, to obtain her cent. Any distribution of the surplus is mutually advantageous, and an equal dis- tribution reflects their equal bargaining power in reaching agreement. To understand further the significance of agreement, consider a var- iant of the original situation. There is an investment fund to which anyone may contribute, at will, any funds he or she has. If the total amount invested is less than $700, the fund returns 5%. If the total is at least $700, the fund returns 10%. Here agreement is unnecessary; Mabel and Abel have nothing to bargain about. If Mabel has $600 in the fund, and is receiving $30, Abel can say to her that if he invests his $400, she will receive more, and he may propose that she give him some of her increase. But Mabel has no reason to agree. It is straight- forwardly rational for Abel to invest his $400. Mabel merely points this out to Abel. Paying him to invest is unnecessary. In this situation, what each contributes is money, and each realizes the same rate of return on this contribution. But MRC does not dictate this outcome; there is no cooperative venture here, no cooperative surplus to be divided be- tween Mabel and Abel. Hampton, then, treats a bargain between Mabel and Abel, as if no agreement were involved. She is led thereby to think that she can pro- pose an alternative to MRC, a 'Principle of Proportionality in distribu- tion, which is that in a cooperative endeavor each person receives that portion of the total benefit which is proportionate to her contribution to it/ But she is mistaken. Let us see why. Hampton introduces a variant of the original situation, in which Mabel has $800 to invest rather than $600. She supposes that, Abel's contribution remaining $400, MRC awards Mabel $70 and Abel $50. Not so. Given the stipulated $700 threshold on obtaining a 10% re- turn, Mabel's $800 earns $80 on its own. She doesn't need to bargain with Abel to gain this return. However, Abel must bargain with her, getting her to agree to let him contribute his $400 so that the return on it will be doubled. Here the cooperative surplus is $20, which MRC divides equally between them, yielding Mabel $90 and Abel $30. In this situation Mabel is doing better under MRC than she would under equal rates of return. This defeats Hampton's claim that MRC typical- ly disadvantages larger investors in comparison with equal rates of re-</page><page sequence="9">Moral Artifice 393 turn.5 But this is not the most important point to be considered here. More important is to ask how Hampton's proportionality principle ap- plies to this situation. It may seem obvious. The overall rate of return on investment is 10%. Surely the proportionality principle requires that each person receive this rate; Mabel gains $80 and Abel $40. If we suppose this, then we are treating the cooperative endeavor as the total investment of $1200, Mabel's contribution as her investment of $800, Abel's as his invest- ment of $400, and the total benefit as the total return, $120. And we conclude that Mabel gains nothing from cooperation; she gets a total of $80, which her investment would yield her independently. Mabel extends to Abel the privilege of combining his investment with hers, and charges him nothing of what he thereby gains. Some rational bargain! But Hampton says that the proportionality principle 'can only be used in situations where the contributions of each party to the cooperative surplus can be determined.' This suggests that the total benefit should be identified with the cooperative surplus, which after all is what is realized by the cooperative endeavor. (Hampton mentions this view as an alternative in her n. 8.) So we now suppose that Mabel contri- butes $800, and Abel $400, realizing a surplus of $20, to be divided proportionately, $13.33 to Mabel and $6.67 to Abel. Mabel's total gain is $93.33, Abel's $26.67. Note that this is a greater departure from equal rates of return than required by MRC, which as we saw would give Mabel $90 and Abel $30. 6 But this way of understanding cooperation in order to apply the proportionality principle is clearly unacceptable. For suppose that Mabel has $399,600 invested. Then on the present interpretation, the surplus realized by allowing Abel to add his $400, still $20, would be divided $19.98 to Mabel, two cents to Abel. The absurdity here arises from allowing the size of Mabel's investment to 5 Consider again the original situation. Suppose that interest is paid annually, and that Mabel and Abel each reinvests the interest. Once Mabel's capital reaches $700, she can earn 10% independently, and so Abel must bargain with her to continue their joint fund. Once both reach $700, cooperation ceases. Under MRC, after seven years Mabel will have approximately $1238 invested to Abel's $710, at which point cooperation between them ceases. Had they agreed to equal rates of re- turn, so that both gained 10% throughout, after seven years Mabel's capital would be only $1169, Abel's would be $779. In this situation MRC initially gives Mabel less than she would obtain under equal rates of return, but in the long run she does better. 6 Of course, if we were to accept this view of how proportionality should be ap- plied, it would support Hampton's claim that it is more favorable to large inves- tors than MRC - but hardly in the way she supposed.</page><page sequence="10">394 David Gauthier affect her share of the cooperative surplus, despite the fact that it does not affect the size of that surplus. What this reveals is the mistake of supposing that the cooperative endeavor should be seen as the total investment of $1200. Mabel's $800 puts her in a position to cooperate with Abel, but her investment is quite unaffected by their cooperative endeavor. So let us say that cooperation consists in Abel's investing with Mabel rather than in- dependently. What are the respective contributions of Mabel and Abel? Abel's is surely $400. Mabel's is simply her agreement. For we clearly cannot coherently say that Mabel contributes nothing: then there would be no cooperative endeavor. And since we have argued that Mabel does not contribute her money (the return on which is unaffected by cooper- ation), all that she can contribute is her agreement. The benefit, we have argued, is the cooperative surplus, $20. But how do we commen- surate the contributions? We might interpret MRC as defining such a commensuration. MRC says, in effect, that Abel's money is worth exactly as much as Mabel's agreement in providing the benefit, and that this holds independently of the amount of Abel's money, as long as he stands to benefit from cooperation. Principles alternative to MRC might provide other ways of doing this. Accepting any such principle, we could then say that Hampton's own principle of proportionality is also satisfied, but only because we would have defined the relation among contributions in terms of their effect on the outcome. We may find such an idea of proportionality pointless and, given some possible principles, no doubt the related sense of proportionality would be counter-intuitive. But note that if we do want to use Hampton's principle of proportionality, then it must rely on MRC or some other principle; it cannot achieve the re- quired commensuration, whether in situations such as the one I have just been discussing or in those similar to Hampton's original example. For its appearance of being directly applicable there arises only because, as we have already seen, Hampton ignores the contribution of agree- ment to providing the benefit or cooperative surplus. Our present ex- ample is surely proof that such a contribution must not be ignored. Hampton's proportionality principle is not, therefore, an alternative to MRC. It does not tell us how to commensurate contributions to the production of the cooperative surplus. In particular, it does not tell us how to weight the significance of agreement. Now it is of course true that in many situations, distribution of benefits is quite indepen- dent of agreement. But such situations are not cooperative, in the sense in which Morals by Agreement is concerned with cooperation. Rather they are typically market situations. A market rate of return on invest- ment makes cooperation, and a principle of distribution such as MRC, unnecessary.</page><page sequence="11">Moral Artifice 395 But there is yet a further problem with Hampton's account. She thinks that her proportionality principle (if we could formulate it in- dependently of other principles) might be supported by 'a more com- plicated economic analysis, probably using a richer specification of the contract situation and relying on theories of the core/ and as a foot- note to this claims, 'We might diagnose Gauthier's mistake in his con- tractarian methodology as one of ignoring . . . [that] the rational solution to a bargain depends not only upon how much each could get by her- self, but also upon how much each could get if she joined alternative coalitions.' But as Hampton must know, the core is empty in many games, including some of those to which we seek to apply the resources of bargaining theory in order to identify a rational outcome. And even when it is not empty, the core does not adequately accommodate Hampton's concern with alternative coalitions. What is the relation between MRC and the core? I shall examine first the general three-person interaction with transferable utility. Let the persons be X,Y, and Z. Without loss of generality we may represent this in 0-1 normalization, letting the payoff to each individual acting independently be 0, the payoff to the coalition {X,Y) = a, to {X,Z} = b, to {Y,Z} = c, and to {X,Y,Z} = 1. (Note that each of a, b, and c lies between 0 and 1 inclusive.) In Morals by Agreement I insist that 'Each person's claim is bounded by the extent of his participation in co-operative interaction. For if someone were to press a claim to what would be brought about by the co-operative interaction of others, then those others would prefer to exclude him from agreement.'7 Hence X claims (1 - c), what he adds by joining the others. Similarly, Y claims (1 - b) and Z claims (1 - a). Since all together they get 1, MRC assigns each a proportion p of her claim where p[3 - (a + b + c)] = 1, or p = l/[3 - (a + b + c)]. Thus X gets (1 - c)/[3 - (a + b + c)]. We may now distinguish three cases, depending on whether the sum of the claims, [3 - (a + b + c)], is less than, equal to, or more than the cooperative surplus, or 1. Consider first case (i), in which the sum of the claims is less than 1; the claims do not exhaust the cooperative surplus. Then p is greater than 1; MRC will assign persons more than their claims. One's claim, although it represents all of what one adds by joining with others as a cooperator, does not always set an upper bound on one's share of the cooperative surplus in interactions involv- ing more than two persons. We may easily show that in case (i), the core is empty. For an out- come is in the core if and only if no non-empty set of persons could ^ Morals by Agreement, 134</page><page sequence="12">396 David Gauthier form a coalition that would be able to provide each of them with more than the outcome affords them. We divide the outcomes exhaustively into those that do, and those that do not, offer any person more than her claim. Consider the first group. If person X, say, receives more than his claim, then Y and Z must each get less than she could from a coalition between them, since X's claim is just the difference between what {Y,Z} can get and what {X,Y,Z} can get. Hence no outcome in which any person receives more than her claim can be in the core. Con- sider the second group. Since no person receives more than her claim, and since the claims do not exhaust the cooperative surplus, each per- son must get less than she could receive from the grand coalition {X,Y,Z}, which can distribute the entire surplus. So no outcome in which no person receives more than her claim is in the core. And this completes the proof that the core is empty. Consider next case (ii), in which the sum of the claims equals 1; the claims exactly exhaust the cooperative surplus. Then p is 1 and MRC assigns each person her claim. And this is the unique outcome in the core. For in any alternative, either someone receives more than her claim, so that the others could do better given a coalition between them- selves, or no one receives more than her claim and someone receives less, so that everyone could benefit from the grand coalition. Consider finally case (iii), in which the sum of the claims exceeds 1; the claims exceed the cooperative surplus. Then p is less than 1 and MRC assigns each person less than her claim. Now this outcome is in the core. It divides up the entire cooperative surplus, so that there is no gain from the grand coalition. It gives each person less than her claim, so the others must receive a total payoff greater than they could gain by a coalition between themselves. And of course, since it gives each person a proportion of her claim, no one could do better by unilateral defection, i.e. by a coalition of one. Thus no non-empty set of persons can form a coalition that benefits each member of the set in relation to what she receives from the outcome determined by MRC. But in case (iii), there are other outcomes in the core. Any distribu- tion of the entire cooperative surplus that gives each person less than her claim must be in the core, since it must give each pair of persons a total payoff greater than they could gain by coalition. There are in- finitely many such distributions; MRC picks one. Thus I have shown that, for the general three-person game with transferable utility, MRC provides a solution whether or not the core is empty, and that if the core is non-empty the solution does indeed fall within it. What more could Hampton wish? But alas. Neither she nor I is likely to be satisfied. Suppose that Mabel can cooperate with either Abel or Gable (to pick a third character from Hampton's footnote 14) to obtain some benefit. Abel and Gable can-</page><page sequence="13">Moral Artifice 397 not secure this benefit without Mabel, and all three cannot increase what Mabel and either Abel or Gable can obtain. In this situation, nei- ther Abel nor Gable can make any claim, given that neither adds to the cooperative surplus obtainable without him. So it would seem that MRC gives the entire surplus to Mabel. And this, it may be noted, is the sole outcome in the core! But it seems neither rational nor fair. For surely Abel and Gable would recognize that both lose by competing for Mabel's cooperation, and so would agree that one of them abstain from seeking to cooperate with Mabel, in return for half of what the other gains.8 On this basis, MRC would divide the total cooperative surplus through two agreements, one involving Abel and Gable, the other involving, in effect, their coalition and Mabel; Mabel receives half and Abel and Gable each one-quarter. The final outcome would not be in the core of the three-person interaction, but each part would fall in the core of one of the two-person interactions (treating a coalition of Abel and Gable as, for the purposes of interaction, one person) into which the original interaction has been decomposed. The application of MRC to multi-person interactions thus raises a problem of determining the appropriate cooperative infrastructure. In two person situations MRC identifies each person as necessary to the production of any and all of the cooperative surplus, and both as jointly sufficient, so that it divides the surplus equally between them, where such a division is possible. But in multi-person situations the contri- bution of each to the overall cooperative surplus is not so straightfor- wardly discerned. The possibilities of coalition formation must be taken into account in ways that neither a simple, one-stage application of MRC, nor an insistence that, where possible, the outcome be in the core, adequately accommodates. I should note further that the result I have proved for the general three-person interaction, that when the core is non-empty, a one-stage application of MRC yields an outcome within it, cannot be extended to interactions involving four or more persons. We may show this by an example. Consider a four-person interaction, with transferable util- ities, involving X, Y, Z, and W. Suppose that each person gains 0 by herself, that if X and Y cooperate {X,Y) can gain 3, that no other pair of persons can gain anything, that adding either Z or W to [ X, Y ) does not increase the gain from 3, that either { X,Z, W } or { Y,Z, W ) can gain 8 But doesn't Mabel have some power to disrupt this agreement? I ignore this com- plication here; it might lead to an application of MRC that would be related to the Shapley value for a multi-person game. See L.S. Shapley, 'A Value for N- person Games/ in H.W.

Tucker, eds., Annals of Mathematical Studies 28 (Princeton: Princeton University Press 1953) 307-17.</page><page sequence="14">398 David Gauthier 2, and that if all cooperate { X, Y,Z, W } can gain 4. X claims 2, the cooper- ative surplus realized if he joins (Y,Z,W) to yield {X,Y,Z,W). Simi- larly Y claims 2. Z claims 1, the cooperative surplus realized if she joins [X,Z,W} to yield [X,Y,Z,W}. The sum of the claims is 6; the cooperative surplus is 4. Hence a one- stage application of MRC gives each person two-thirds of her claim; X and Y each gets 1 1/3 and Z and W each gets 2/3. This outcome is not in the core, since the coalition [X,Y} can get 3 and so give X and Y each more than 1 1/3. But the core is not empty; any outcome that distributes the entire cooperative surplus, ensuring that X and Y to- gether get at least 3, but that each gets no more than 2, is in the core. (If X gets more than 2, then Y, Z, and W together get less than 2, and so { Y,Z, W } can give each more; similarly if Y gets more than 2.) Thus we have shown that a one-stage application of MRC can yield an out- come falling outside the core. But is this one-stage application plausi- ble? Surely we might expect that X and Y would agree to divide 3 by cooperation between themselves, and then would agree to four-way cooperation including Z and W for the remaining surplus of 1. Apply- ing MRC to each agreement, X and Y would gain a total of 1 3/4 each; Z and W would gain 1/4 each. And this outcome is in the core, as I have just shown. From this discussion of the relation between MRC and the core, I want to conclude only that neither a one-stage application of MRC nor a requirement that the outcome of agreement fall within the core when it is not empty, offers a satisfactory resolution of the problem of ra- tional cooperation. I see no reason, however, to doubt that an appropri- ate multi-stage application of MRC offers a satisfactory resolution. So Hampton and I can agree that market solutions are appropriate to mar- ket structures. We can agree that distribution will be based on mar- ginal product where this is defined. But then we disagree, since MRC is intended to yield a solution for all cooperative structures where a benefit is available to persons who can agree on its distribution, not for market structures in which cooperation is unnecessary, and not only for structures in whch marginal product is defined. More work needs to be done to show how MRC applies in multi-person interactions, but neither Hampton's proposed proportionality rule nor her appeal to the theory of the core offers an alternative to MRC. MRC may or may not have intuitive appeal, but its defence is to be found not in moral intuitions, but in an analysis of rational bargain- ing. I provide at least part of such an analysis in Morals by Agreement, Hampton ignores it when she claims that my 'contract language only disguises an implicit appeal to our intuitions about fairness.' It is she who makes such an appeal, basing it on what I have argued is a flawed account of examples in which the circumstances rule out the ordinary</page><page sequence="15">Moral Artifice 399 market structure that of course would yield the intuitively familiar re- lations between returns and investments. And so I do not find Hamp- ton's concerns persuasive. But Hampton thinks that in establishing a principle of distributive justice, an appeal to morality is unavoidable. Those contractarians who understand the social contract as specifying how much any individual ought to get of the available social resources ... must argue why that approach ... is preferable to an approach which regards the contract as specifying how much an individual is worth . . . .' What an individu- al ought to get, in a contract, over and above what he could get out- side the contract, is what others ought rationally to give him to induce him to join with them. Or, as we might say, 'so much as would be given for the use of his Power,' and this, as an author with whom Hampton has more than a nodding acquaintance has said, is The Value, or WORTH of a man,' which 'is not absolute; but a thing dependant on the need and judgement of another.'9 We may wish to meditate on Leviathan, to see more clearly why there is only one approach to the contract, and to distributive justice, that of rationality, which tells us both what an individual ought to get, and what that same individual is worth. MRC needs refinement, but we should preserve its ground- ing in the equal rationality of persons each concerned to maximize her utility - the fulfillment of her preferences. Ill Danielson accepts my defence of the rationality of constraint, but not of the particular disposition, constrained maximization, that I propose. A constrained maximizer is a conditional cooperator; she cooperates with those whom she expects to cooperate with her. Danielson defends reciprocal cooperation; a reciprocal cooperator cooperates with those whom he expects to cooperate with and only with other cooperators. A conditional cooperator cooperates with an unconditional coopera- tor - someone who would cooperate (or behave in a cooperative man- ner) with anyone, doing her part in a cooperative venture even when others would not, and could not reasonably be expected to, do theirs. But it is irrational to cooperate with an unconditional cooperator inso- far as this involves constraining one's own maximizing behaviour. A reciprocal cooperator does not do this. He cooperates only with those who are at most conditional cooperators, taking advantage of those who always behave cooperatively. 9 Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan (London 1651) chapter 10</page><page sequence="16">400 David Gauthier Conditional cooperation may seem a promising candidate for a moral disposition. A conditional cooperator is willing to accept no less than her fair share, but seeks no more. Reciprocal cooperation may seem a less promising candidate. A reciprocal cooperator seeks his fair share only among those who are willing to accept no less for themselves; he willingly exploits those who - irrationally - rely on the benevo- lence of their fellows. To avoid misunderstanding, note that a reciprocal cooperator is not engaged in a game of 'second-guessing.' He does not seek to fool others, to take advantage of those who are taken in by his cooperative disposition. Nor does he seek to exploit those who are unable to pun- ish him for uncooperative behaviour. One of the benefits of agreed constraint is to remove or diminish the need for external enforcement of cooperative behaviour, and so to reduce the investment each per- son must make in defending herself against free-riders and predators; a reciprocal cooperator does not take advantage of those who have lo- wered their defences in the expectation that others will do the same. Again, a reciprocal cooperator does not confer benefits only on those from whom he expects future benefits in return. The reciprocity with which he is concerned is dispositional; he plays his part in coopera- tive ventures with those who require his willingness to play his part as a condition for playing their part. Each part need not be further de- fined in reciprocal terms. Thus suppose that it is the practice, in a small agrarian community, to harvest the crops on behalf of any disabled member, and suppose that this practice is reasonably judged, ex ante, to be mutually advantageous. A reciprocal cooperator will not refuse to help one of his disabled fellows on a particular occasion, simply be- cause he intends to move elsewhere after the current harvest season, and so will never himself benefit from the practice. His concern is with the character of the practice. If he supposes that others would have harvested his crops had he been disabled, even if they would not have expected him to help harvest theirs were they disabled, then he will see no reason to participate. But as long as the practice is fully mutu- al, so that those who get help are those who would be expected to give it, it will command his support. A reciprocal cooperator is not someone who relates each individual cooperative act to the anticipated behaviour of others in such a way that he expects a net gain from its performance. Such a person would exhibit no real constraint in his maximizing behaviour, and indeed, would not perform genuinely cooperative acts as cooperation is un- derstood in Morals by Agreement. Properly understood, then, recipro- cal cooperation may seem less unattractive as a candidate for a moral disposition. And its attraction may be enhanced if we note that recipro- cal cooperation helps to sustain the conditions in which cooperation</page><page sequence="17">Moral Artifice 401 flourishes, and so in which fair mutual advantage is realized. Uncon- ditional cooperation is a disposition that is inimical, not only to its own survival, but to that of any form of cooperation. For a world of uncon- ditional cooperators is easily invaded by straightforward maximizers, who exploit their guileless if benevolent fellows at every turn and whose presence, except in conditions of full transparency, increases the risk run by other cooperators of mistaking their fellows' disposi- tions and consequently being victimized. Conditional cooperators, al- though defending themselves directly against predators and free-riders, fail to defend themselves indirectly, by sustaining the unconditional cooperators whose presence enables straightforward maximizers to thrive. Reciprocal cooperators defend themselves both directly and in- directly; by exploiting unconditional cooperators, reciprocal coopera- tors help eliminate the natural victims of straightforward maximizers, placing the latter at a competitive disadvantage. Reciprocal coopera- tors thus help make the world safe for morality. This is not an appealing argument. If the farmer, in order to protect his chickens from the foxes, eliminates the local rabbits, thus reduc- ing the foxes' overall food supply and encouraging them to go else- where, it does seem rather hard on the innocent rabbits. But of course, rabbits cannot help being rabbits, whereas unconditional cooperators can presumably mend their guileless but costly ways. Although my argument does not require other-directed concerns, it equally does not deny them, and many of us might prefer reeducating unconditional cooperators to exploiting them. And this raises a difficult issue that neither Danielson nor I con- sider. In my argument, preferences are fixed, not to be sure as simple givens but as objects of rational reflection, and then dispositions are defined in relation to them. But what if these dispositions are them- selves objects of preference? Danielson, focusing on artificial morali- ty, can avoid this problem by the appropriate construction of his agents. I cannot. I must then allow for the possibility of such preferences. And these preferences need not be arbitrary, or given exogenously to the defence of rational constraint, for since human beings have, in addition to beliefs and desires, emotions that affect their willing- ness and ability to behave in different ways, the cultivation of ap- propriate feelings for our fellows may be essential to inducing behaviour that is maximally conductive to mutual preference fulfill- ment. The cultivation of appropriate fellow feelings thus becomes a suitable object of rational agreement, and the agreed feelings may well give rise to preferences over dispositions to unconditional, condition- al, reciprocal, and other forms of cooperation. Speculatively, I sug- gest that, absent such preferences, Danielson's defence of reciprocal rather than conditional cooperation is sound; yet the desirability of</page><page sequence="18">402 David Gauthier cultivating feelings supportive of cooperative practices and inimical to predation, exploitation, and free-riding may well support, at this richer level of analysis, conditional cooperation. Persons who take an interest in cooperation are, I suggest, likely to prefer to dispose them- selves to cooperate with other cooperators. IV Reading Baier's account of Morals by Agreement is rather like looking at the image in a fun-house mirror; the parts are there but everything is out of shape. Or so one supposes, but the author should not claim to be a privileged interpreter of his text. Consider then someone who thinks that morality is fundamentally based on 'the biological categor- ies of conception, birth, life, death' with 'instinctive genetic and affec- tive foundations' (the phrases are Baier's, although she does not explicitly relate them to morality in the way that I am now suggest- ing). Such a person might see a system based rather on 'the "rational" categories of interaction, presence and absence' as Baier sees Morals by Agreement. 'It almost amounts to a make-believe case of ancestry by agreement. At the Archimedean point we are indeed to "choose" the processes that have shaped us. It is supposed to be a liberating choice, but the price of this "liberation" is prior fake incarceration.' But this overlooks the distinctive capacities that separate us from other animals. They are shaped by biological and in some cases social processes, and can not call that shaping into question. We too are shaped, but our capacity to represent states of affairs to ourselves leads us to exist in a semantic space of our own creation, in which the shap- ing is as much open to question as everything else. Human prefer- ence has no fixed points. In representing and reflecting on what, at the level of animal impulse, is merely given, we undermine the ap- peal to 'fairly dependable human affections' as moral foundations. And in that reflection we come to choose the processes that shape us; metaphorically, we choose our own ancestry. To be sure, the extent of our awareness, and so of our self-creation, is always limited. We lack the capacity to create as God, ex nihilo. But the limitations can not be stated; we can recognize what they were for others, but not what they are for ourselves, since we transcend them in representing them. Thus in Morals by Agreement I underestimate the problem posed to morality by our capacity for semantic representa- tion. I assume that we take, as the content of our reasons for acting, the reflectively endorsed representations of our desires, and unify those reasons by the form of maximization. But when we take seriously the</page><page sequence="19">Moral Artifice 403 claim that human preference has no fixed points, then even these as- sumptions may be called into question. The characterization of our moral nature is already too thick. These remarks may suggest the difficulty I find with Baier's perspec- tive. But they may not sufficiently explain my failure to grasp some of the details in her critique, in particular, as they relate to each per- son's basic endowment and to the proviso. Baier seems to be concerned with the relation of coming into being and passing away to the basic endowment of what a person 'can make use of simply in virtue of his presence in a situation, and what no one else can make use of in his absence.'10 Specifying the basic endowment of a zygote does not seem to me important, but equally it does not seem difficult; the genetic ma- terial it contains is certainly part of its basic endowment since there is no other being able to access and so use it if the zygote is not pres- ent. That, had the zygote not come into existence, another zygote might have come into existence that would have made use of the material is not to the point. Baier says, discussing Crusoe and Friday. 'If Crusoe is deemed ab- sent, once dead, when Friday comes into his inheritance, then neither Crusoe nor Friday ever had their own bodies among their basic en- dowments.' Why ever not? Dead Crusoe has no basic endowment - dead Crusoe is not the sort of thing capable of having a basic endow- ment. But when alive, Crusoe could use his body, and in his absence, no one else could. That his body will become available for use in the permanent absence that results from his death is again not to the point. Baier is concerned with the metaphysics of my morals, but as far as conception, birth and death are concerned, I do not see why. Crusoe and Friday agree that Friday will care for Crusoe in his ill- ness, and will receive Crusoe's undestroyed possessions on his death. Were Friday not to care for Crusoe, he would leave him no worse off than in his absence; were Crusoe not to leave Friday his possessions, he would again leave Friday no worse off than in his absence. (I as- sume that the hut, weapons and tools would not have been available to Friday had Crusoe not built them or rescued them from shipwreck.) Caring and bequeathing are therefore admissible subjects of bargain- ing; in terms of them, Crusoe and Friday strike a mutually advanta- geous agreement. Crusoe gains by being cared for; Friday gains by inheriting Crusoe's possessions in return for caring. Baier seems to find some problem here, but what it is I know not. 10 Morals by Agreement, 100</page><page sequence="20">404 David Gauthier Baier misstates the proviso. It does not say 'don't push a fellow fur- ther down than he'd sink anyway, in your absence,' but rather, 'don't push, etc. except to avoid being pushed further down that you'd sink in his absence.'11 Don't better yourself by your fellow's presence, by worsening him by your own presence. This rules out eating other peo- ple's children (unless they are better off eaten, which seems unlikely), but not, as Baier astutely points out, eating one's own (unless their lives are thereby made not worth living, which of course is not al- together improbable). Baier's example does not, however, constitute a situation in which the proviso licenses the eating of children. Her cannibalistic Peruvians take the mothers of their future meals as war captives, and breed with them rather than kill them. Now if the provi- so applies, it rules out using the women as breeders, since this betters the situation of the cannibals by worsening that of the women. Baier denies this, since the women 'might otherwise have been instantly slaughtered' (so they are conceivably better off as breeders), but slaugh- tering would itself be ruled out by the proviso. Thus even if the provi- so permits eating the children, it does not permit breeding with the mother (unless, of course, she too were to be a happy party to the fu- ture feast, eager to enjoy the fruit of her womb). But the proviso does not, in fact, get any grip on the situation Baier envisages. It constrains interaction only with a view to cooperation, and Baier's cannibals have no reason to envisage cooperation with the mothers of their prospec- tive victuals. Baier's real objection is not to the proviso, but to the subordination of all forms of moral constraint to the requirement of mutual benefit. Thus I argue that 'the proviso moralizes and rationalizes the state of nature - but only in so far as we conceive the state of nature as giving way to society,'12 and we conceive the state of nature giving way to society only insofar as it is advantageous for all concerned. If Baier's Peruvians see no prospect of benefit from cooperation, then they lack any reason to constrain their behaviour by adherence to the proviso. If they see the prospect of benefit only if the initial bargaining posi- tion incorporates some predatory gains realized in the state of nature, then they have reason to modify the constraint on the behaviour that would result from full adherence to the proviso. This is the bargain between slaveowners and slaves that I discuss at the end of Ch. VII, and to which Baier refers. The slaves do not, as she supposes, 'accept a proviso that ensures their ultimate disadvantage'; acceptance of the 11 Ibid., 205 12 Ibid., 193</page><page sequence="21">Moral Artifice 405 proviso would benefit them. They would be only too happy to bar- gain from a proviso-constrained initial position. But the slaveowners, recognizing the costs to them of accepting the proviso, reject it. Baier claims that I do not 'seriously consider a strengthening, a stronger ini- tial constraint on appropriation'; the problem is that in some cases the proviso is already too strong to serve as an initial position for a mutu- ally advantageous agreement. The only response to Baier's real objection is to note that she is ask- ing for a morality that would demand irrational behaviour of its ad- herents. To be sure, traditional moralities have always done this (although rarely openly). But the demand for irrationality cannot sur- vive its exposure. My concern is to safeguard the rational core of moral constraint by casting off the irrational excrescences. And constraints that do not carry with them the expectation of advantage (not, of course, directly, since direct advantage is no constraint; the idea throughout is that advantage comes from being disposed to certain forms of constraint) lack the support of reason. One should not understand this too narrowly, however. Baier does, in considering Joanna and Jonathan.13 She supposes that, should Joan- na's garden be destroyed by a storm as she goes into labour, she loses her bargaining power. But a prudent Joanna will have forseen the pos- sibility of such a disaster; the bargain that she and an equally prudent Jonathan will have concluded will provide insurance against disaster and for mutual support of their offspring. Nothing in my argument precludes them from wanting children and taking thought for their care, although nothing requires that they do. Furthermore, looking forward to the infirmity of old age, Joanna and Jonathan are likely to view child- ren as an investment, giving them the assurance of care when they will need it as the reward for their child-raising labours. This attitude is, after all, not uncharacteristic of persons in those parts of the world that lack pension plans or social security. And the children, if they are to fulfil their part of the intergenerational bargain, are likely to want to feel wanted; if they think of themselves as having been potential condidates for eating or trading, they may take a different view of what is later required of them. Thus we should think of Joanna, Jonathan, and their children, as linked in an agreement that provides, not just for immediately profitable trades of vegetables for fish, but for long- term care and assistance. Such an agreement, rather than being ground- ed in 'some humanity/ calls it into play. 13 Ibid., 206-8</page><page sequence="22">406 David Gauthier V Further concerns about the proviso are raised by Peter Danielson. To discuss these, diagrammatic representation of the implications of the proviso will be helpful. Suppose that in a state of nature, person X could obtain a maximum utility u in the absence of person Y, and Y could obtain a maximum utility v in the absence of X. In Figure 1, we show the point (u,v), which we shall label the no-interaction point, N, and we divide the utility space into four quadrants in relation to it. Figure 1 Y t Pareto-superior points N(u,v) Pareto- inferior points 1 ► X The upper right quadrant contains those points Pareto-superior to N; the lower left quadrant contains those points Pareto-inf erior to N, and so on. Now the proviso, as I interpret it, licenses state of nature be- haviour that moves the parties to any point in the upper right quad- rant. What does it say about behaviour that moves parties to points in the other quadrants? That depends on the feasible outcomes. Let us suppose, as I do in the interactions discussed in Morals by Agree- ment, that mapped in utility space, these constitute a closed, convex figure, the outcome-space; its continuous upper right bound, or utili- ty frontier, then represents the Pareto-optimal possibilities. Then there are five cases to consider:</page><page sequence="23">Moral Artifice 407 (i) The outcome-space includes points in the upper right quad- rant. Then the proviso limits state of nature interaction to such points. (ii) The outcome-space does not include points in the upper right quadrant but includes the no-interaction point. Then the provi- so forbids all state of nature interaction. (iii) The outcome-space includes points in the lower left quadrant that are Pareto-optimal (see Figure 2). Then the proviso restricts state of nature interaction to these points. Figure 2 (iv) All Pareto-optimal points in the outcome-space are in the upper left quadrant (see Figure 3). Then the proviso restricts state of nature interaction to the rightmost such point. (v) All Pareto-optimal points in the outcome-space are in the lower right quadrant. Then the proviso restricts state of nature inter- action to the uppermost such point. With a clear understanding of the implications of the proviso for state of nature interaction, we may turn to Danielson's concerns. He agrees</page><page sequence="24">408 David Gauthier Figure 3 that the initial bargaining position should be non-coercive, and so should incorporate personal rights. But, he argues, 'rational contrac- tors might stop here, making personal rights the only precondition of bargaining/ Property rights, and so appropriation, although licensed by the proviso (as I interpret it), would be subordinated to bargain- ing; they would emerge, if at all, not in the state of nature but only as the result of social agreement. Why would rational contractors re- ject property rights? Consider the effect of admitting them. Although any appropriation licensed by the proviso would worsen no one's po- sition in the state of nature, and although it would increase the utility payoff to each person of the initial bargaining position in relation to that of the no-interaction point, yet it seems that it would better the outcome of bargaining for some, and worsen it for others, in relation to that which would be determined by the no-interaction point. Con- sider Figure 4. Here we show the no-interaction point, N, and a point, P, Pareto-superior to it, that we suppose would result from proviso- constrained interaction in the state of nature and so on my account would be the initial bargaining position. Call P the no-advantage point, since the proviso rules out interaction that involves the taking of ad- vantage. We show also the utility frontier of the outcome-space (i.e. the Pareto-optimal points) available through cooperation, and the</page><page sequence="25">Moral Artifice 409 points on the frontier that would result from bargaining (using MRC), taking on the one hand N and on the other hand P as the initial bar- gaining position. Now since preferences over the Pareto-optimal out- comes are strictly opposed, it is clear that any shift in the initial bargaining position that yields a different final outcome betters the sit- uation of one person and worsens that of the other. Hence it seems that state of nature appropriation does indeed violate the proviso. As Danielson says, 'there is an incoherence in Gauthier's main defense of the proviso. It leaves one no worse off only if the effect of appropri- ation is taken to be localized to the preagreement situation. However, the only reason we are supposed to accept the constraint of the provi- so is with regard to the "prospect of mutual benefit." . . . Since [the per- sons] can see how constraints on the initial position effect their benefits ... they will globally maximize/ Figure 4 I am of course simplifying Danielson's argument and omitting many of the details. But what I have said should suffice to reveal a problem in his position. The contractors recognize that state of nature interac- tion affects the initial bargaining position whch in turn affects the so- cial outcome. Now this points in two opposed directions. On the one hand, it suggests that each will act in the state of nature, not necessar- ily to maximize his payoff there, but in order to place himself most</page><page sequence="26">410 David Gauthier advantageously for social bargaining. This would reinstate the claims of the threat point (which I discuss in Morals by Agreement, ch. VII.2.4) to serve as the initial bargaining position. It would eliminate the provi- so as a constraint on state of nature interaction, leaving only a con- straint on coercion grounded in the need to ensure compliance with the bargained outcome. On the other hand, it suggests that each will resist any bargain that leaves him worse off than were bargaining to proceed from the no-interaction point - otherwise he will consider that others have bettered their position by worsening his. This would require a strengthened proviso, in which state of nature interaction would be constrained, not by the requirement that no one better her situation in the state of nature by worsening that of her fellows, but that no one better her social bargaining position by worsening that of her fellows. Figure 5 Would the strengthened proviso rule out all state of nature interac- tion? No. For in some cases such interaction may expand the possibil- ities for cooperation in ways that are mutually advantageous. Consider Figure 5, in which cooperation from the no-interaction point, N, is limit- ed by the utility frontier F, but in which cooperation from another point, P, Pareto-superior to it and, we assume, feasible in state of nature in- teraction, is limited by the frontier F'. Taking P as the initial bargain-</page><page sequence="27">Moral Artifice 411 ing position yields an agreed outcome Pareto-superior to that obtained by bargaining from N. Although there is a sense in which the move from N to P strengthens X's bargaining position in relation to Y, yet both X and Y are made better off by the move. Thus even the strength- ened proviso would permit interaction leading to P. And if this inter- action involved appropriation, then even the strengthened proviso would allow it. The claim that only personal rights would be recog- nized in the state of nature is too strong. But state of nature property rights would clearly be far more limited under the strengthened proviso than under the proviso proposed in Morals by Agreement. Danielson seems not to have noticed that his critique of the proviso cuts in opposed directions. He supposes that the prospective bargain- ers will recognize that 'the only feature relevant to accepting a starting point is its effect on the resulting bargain/ but does not realize that this may lead them to support the strengthened proviso as necessary to ensure that no advantage is taken of any of them in relation to bar- gaining from the no interaction point, or to reject the proviso so that each of them may affect his social bargaining position as best he can. Indeed, we may suppose that some would favour the strengthened proviso, others its elimination. But I want to defend the proviso as I presented it. It is true that its effect is to permit state of nature interaction that leaves some persons ultimately worse off than they would have been had everything (ex- cept personal rights) been decided by agreement. State of nature in- teraction removes some items from the bargaining table. But those persons whose bargaining position is weakened are nevertheless bet- ter off than at the no interaction point. Their situation is improved, or at least not worsened, by state of nature interaction, and then im- proved further by the outcome of social bargaining under MRC. If the proviso is satisfied, state of nature interaction does not confer short- term benefits at the risk of long-term overall costs. The only complaint available to those who find their bargaining position weakened by state of nature appropriation is that the scope of social bargaining has been restricted in ways disadvantageous to them, but this disadvantage does not constitute a worsening of their situation in comparison with the no-interaction point. There are no independent rights to a social bar- gaining agenda on which they could base an appeal for a strength- ened proviso. The case for eliminating the proviso, and ruling out only coercive interaction in the state of nature on the basis of personal rights, is to be answered by an appeal to the instability of the resulting social struc- tures. Respect for personal rights does not rule out the taking of ad- vantage, where this is explicated in terms of bettering one's position by worsening that of another, in relation to no-interaction. If the ini-</page><page sequence="28">412 David Gauthier tial bargaining position reflects state of nature interaction that includes the taking of advantage, then, as I argue in Morals by Agreement, the ideal of social cooperation is undermined, and social institutions and practices are seen as sustaining and perpetuating exploitative relation- ships. The argument for compliance with requirements that go against one's direct interest appeals to the equal rationality of persons; each, recognizing the benefit of universal compliance, is willing to comply herself as far as, but only as far as, her fellows are also willing. But social arrangements that institutionalize the taking of advantage require a greater degree of compliance by those worsened, in relation to the direct pursuit of their own concerns, than by those bettered. Once recog- nized, this partiality will have a destabilizing effect on the social insti- tutions, and will therefore tend to be eliminated over time, the process slowed by the costs of departures from the status quo, or temporarily arrested by direct coercive intervention on the part of the advantaged. But we may recognize these practical obstacles to ensuring that the ac- tual social bargain is constrained by the proviso without undermining the claim that compliance with fully cooperative, voluntarily accepta- ble arrangements, satisfying both the proviso and the principle of mini- max relative concession, constitutes the unique point of stability in interaction among fully rational persons. Suppose that my defense of the proviso is successful. Danielson may nevertheless object that the defence of state of nature appropriation is another matter. Let state of nature interaction be constrained by ruling out the taking of advantage. 'One cannot be taken advantage of in ini- tial appropriation if appropriation is not permitted to influence the so- cial bargain.' But in Morals by Agreement I argue that to interfere with some appropriative activity in the state of nature would violate the provi- so.14 One can be taken advantage of if initial appropriation is not per- mitted to influence the social bargain. Danielson does not consider that argument. He is, however, right to decouple my defence of constraints on state of nature interaction from my defence of the market. For even if in- dividual appropriation is legitimated in the state of nature, it might be that the social bargain would introduce the collectivization of control over the material factors of production. Social institutions are to be selected in accordance with the demands of MRC, and we can not say, a priori, what institutions will satisfy those demands. The argument of Morals by Agreement treats morality as a remedy for market failure. 14 Ibid., 214-17</page><page sequence="29">Moral Artifice 413 (Consider for example: 'Where the invisible hand fails to direct each person, mindful only of her own gain, to promote the benefit of all, co-operation provides a visible hand ... we begin our examination of co-operation as the rational response to market failure.'15) But market success rests on moral conditions; the agreed, not the merely natural, absence of force and fraud. These conditions, it is true, suffice for the coming into being of the market, so that, ceteris paribus, the uncondi- tioned rejection of market interaction would 'constrain freedom so that advantage might be taken.'16 The question remains, however, wheth- er and how far the market would be chosen, as part of the overall set of social institutions and practices that would most fully realize the ideal of cooperative interaction, maximizing the overall cooperative sur- plus in relation to the state of nature and distributing it in accordance with the requirements of reason and justice embodied in MRC. Al- though I have no doubt that, for significant areas of human interac- tion, the market would indeed be chosen, the formal apparatus of moral theory does not suffice to answer the question. Danielson is right to insist that 'the market can be regulated by the social contract.' VI Hampton notes a further consideration relevant to the social regula- tion of the market in suggesting that 'it is no longer clear that a market society ... is not going to shape some individuals ... badly, nor that there aren't other principles disruptive of market interactions . . . which an Archimedean chooser with this sort of concern [with how individu- als are shaped] would believe it was also necessary to choose.' Hamp- ton argues that the introduction of Archimedean choice significantly modifies my moral theory, introducing a second, more Rawlsian con- tract method, and 'a decisive shift in ... what [the] contract method is for.' Rather than being 'used to select principles for individuals to use in order to promote and ensure a desirable cooperative relation- ship,' it 'is used to choose principles that are "for" the structuring of the social system which plays a profound role in creating individuals.' And from this perspective it may seem that the earlier justifications 'of the MRC principle, the Lockean proviso and constrained maximi- zation' are thrown 'into doubt.' 15 Ibid., 113 16 Ibid., 261</page><page sequence="30">414 David Gauthier What is the role of Archimedean choice in my analysis? Primarily, it serves to confirm, from a moral perspective, the rational derivation of impartial constraints on straightforward maximization. In earlier chapters, I argue that rational persons would agree to and comply with those institutions, practices and principles that emerge from rational bargaining based on proviso-constrained natural interaction. The moral status of these rationally agreed constraints derives from their impar- tiality. Although I also argue in earlier chapters that, in being found- ed on an appeal to the equal rationality of those who agree to and comply with them, their impartiality is assured, I confirm this directly in Ch. VIII by providing them with an Archimedean point justifica- tion - by showing that an individual chooser, so placed that her im- partiality is assured, would select them. I show, or claim to show, that the Archimedean chooser or ideal actor would choose freedom con- strained by the proviso, and mutual benefit in accordance with mini- max relative concession. I also claim that she would choose the market where it is to be had; I now think that choice of the market, as of other determinate principles and institutions, cannot be shown to follow from a consideration simply of the reasoning of the Archimedean chooser, but depends on information about the determinate effects of differing possible ways of organizing social and economic life. She views socie- ty as 'a single co-operative enterprise/ but in so viewing it, she does not view the market in isolation, as I suppose her to do in ch. VIII.4.3. I do not claim that she would choose to be a constrained maximizer (as opposed to choosing those conditions that make constrained max- imization rational), or equivalently to choose to comply with what, from an impartial perspective, she would choose, because the question of compliance can be settled only from an agent's actual standpoint. The ideal actor would choose to have that disposition to choose that would most benefit her; she would choose also those circumstances in which constrained maximization would be the most beneficial disposition. But since she does not know whether she is in those circumstances, she would not directly choose to be disposed to constrained maximization. In all of this, there is no modification of my contractarian method. Rather, I am concerned with a different problem - that of impartial choice rather than rational agreement. What I show is that the two yield the same results, as far as institutions, practices, and principles are concerned. But is this so? Does not Hampton note a difference in the scope of the two problems, so that rational agreement determines a scheme of cooperation among determinate persons, whereas impar- tial choice determines a social structure for the shaping of those per- sons? She is, of course, correct to note that the discussion of Archimedean choice moves to a broader perspective than is found in</page><page sequence="31">Moral Artifice 415 earlier chapters. But this is an accident of the particular way in which I present my moral theory. Consider an individual asking for the justifi- cation of the social institutions and practices that constrain her be- haviour. She may begin by considering whether she would accept such institutions as the outcome of a bargain with the fellow members of her society. But in recognizing that the social bargaining position in which she now finds herself is itself conditioned by the workings of these institutions and practices, she will be led to consider whether she would have accepted them, ex ante, in circumstances not con- strained by her (or her fellows') actual social position. And in recog- nizing further that her very preferences and realized capacities have been shaped by her society, she will be led to consider further wheth- er she would have accepted the institutions and practices of her socie- ty in an agreement in which each person reasons in terms of his potential for social development. Thus even if we think of the rational justification of existing social institutions and practices to determinate individuals, we are led to assess them in terms of the distribution of the fruits of social cooperation they afford in relation to what each could expect 'in that social structure most favourable to the actualization of his capacities and character traits, and to the fulfillment of his prefer- ences, provided that this structure is a feasible alternative' to existing society.17 An individual may consider existing social institutions and practices ultimately unjustified, without denying that, given the person she ac- tually is, they afford her a fair share of the benefits of social coopera- tion. For the person she is may not be the person that, she supposes, she would have been, in an essentially just society. But in an imper- fect world, the ideal of the self that is represented by the person one would have been in an essentially just society may remain largely in- determinate. A person may then believe herself to be misshaped by her society, without any precise measure of the deprivation she suffers, and without supposing that were she to find herself, with her actual preferences and skills, in an essentially just society, she would find it better suited to her needs. Although an essentially just society adapts to provide for the fair fulfillment of whatever preferences its members have, it need not adapt or be able to adapt to provide for the fulfill- ment of preferences that arise only in persons misshapen because of injustice. In insisting on the continuity between an individual's assessment of the justice of her relationshps with her fellows, and the justice of 17 Ibid., 264</page><page sequence="32">416 David Gauthier the institutions by which her skills and preferences have been shaped, I want to emphasize my difference with Rawls. In recent writing, he stresses 'that justice as fairness is not intended as the application of a general moral conception to the basic structure of society, as if this structure were simply another case to which that general moral con- ception is applied/18 My view is quite the opposite. The same moral conception informs our evaluation of basic social institutions and of interpersonal relationships. And the same form of rational justifica- tion applies at all levels of social and interpersonal life. The role of Ar- chimedean choice is not to change the focus of concern from cooperation to socialization, but to reveal the moral impartiality im- plicit in rational agreement. VII Socialization is not to be neglected. If one thinks of morality, not only as artifice, but as intended for such artifacts as corporations and govern- ments, then one need consider only problems of institutional design. In principle, a constrained maximizer is no more difficult to construct than a straightforward maximizer. But if one is concerned with moral- ity for human beings, with the constraints that each can have reason to impose on herself, then we must face the limitations on human plasticity. Constrained maximization may, for all that I say in Morals by Agreement, be incompatible with our psychology. But semantic animals are not maximizing machines. Again, we must not overlook the distinctive capacities that separate us from other animals. How they choose on the basis of their desires and beliefs - whether in a maximizing or, more plausibly, a satisficing manner, is not open to them to question or alter. When we begin to act on the basis of our representations, we may be natural maximizers, but our capacity to represent states of affairs to ourselves and to reflect on our representations enables us to treat the maximizing principle as as much open to question as anything else. Not only the content of human preference, but its form, lacks fixed points. It is, of course, conceivable that our capacity to reflect is in some respects idle. However convincing we find the case for constrained max- imization, we may be subject to an akrasia that subverts our rationality. But the evidence surely supports the claim that the form of ration- 18 John Rawls, 'Justice as Fairness: Political Not Metaphysical/ Philosophy and Pub- lic Affairs 14 (1985) 225</page><page sequence="33">Moral Artifice 417 al choice is not fully fixed. Although it may be possible to give a trivial maximizing interpretation to any particular choice, the supposition that human beings are maximizers turns, not on this possibility, but on the prospect of an overall maximizing interpretation of an individual's choices in which what she maximizes on one occasion may plausibly be related to her other choices and more generally to the set of beliefs and preferences that are ascribed to her. And it seems evident that not all actions performed for reasons can be explained within a nar- row maximizing framework. Persons frequently consider themselves to have reason to do what does not maximize the fulfillment of what, from their other behaviour and expressed attitudes, we reasonably take to be their preferences, given what we equally reasonably take to be their beliefs. Maximization may provide part of the framework for the ascription of desires and beliefs to persons, but the framework fits par- ticular choices loosely. If persons can act for non-maximizing reasons, then it seems plausi- ble to suppose that they can act for reasons that are only indirectly related to maximizing the fulfillment of their preferences. The psychol- ogy of semantic representation seems compatible with treating moral- ity as an artifice for human beings as well for decision-making institutions. But, as I noted at the outset, human beings are character- ized not only by desires and beliefs, but also by emotions and feel- ings. And these will no doubt play a psychologically significant role in determining how successful individuals will be in treating consider- ations of differing kinds as reasons for choosing and acting. A norma- tive account of practical rationality will then need to be linked with a complementary account of the cultivation of the feelings supportive of the reasons it endorses. It is here that we may expect to find place for much of what Baier considers lacking from the 'individualist and unsentimental morality' I have developed. We do not, however, take human affections as foun- dational in the construction of morality. Indeed, the more specifically moral sentiments are surely acquired, and we shall want to say of them very much what John Stuart Mill did in Utilitarianism, agreeing that moral sentiment 'is ... susceptible, by a sufficient use of the external sanctions and of the force of early impressions, of being cultivated in almost any direction.'19 But they may be attached to the social and so- ciable feelings that are no doubt part of our evolved repertoire for en- hancing reproductive success, and these feelings, brought to conscious 19 John Stuart Mill, Utilitarianism (London 1861), ch. Ill, para. 8</page><page sequence="34">418 David Gauthier awareness, can be endorsed and enhanced insofar as they help to moti- vate and to reward fair and mutually beneficial cooperative interac- tions. The ideal of cooperation gives us the standard by which we can evaluate the cultivation or our affective capacities. There is every reason to suppose that, just as the best way to max- imize the overall fulfillment of one's preferences is to be disposed to something more than maximizing choices, so the best way to assure fair mutual advantage in cooperation is to be disposed to something more than bargaining behaviour. Society may implement a rational bar- gain, but not by being a universal bazaar. A market that offers fair ben- efit to mutually unconcerned individuals neither cultivates nor rewards the social and familial feelings that sustain the affectively involved in- teractions of human life. It does, however, sustain a society within which the free play of human affectivity becomes possible. Baier continues 'to suspect that the liberal morality (with its adher- ents) is itself a parasite on what it claims to improve upon - it relies on and exploits the usually unfree affectivity of the mothers of surviv- ing children, and the contributions of all those who help a child ac- quire and develop capacities as well as preferences, who socialize us into autonomy.' If by this she means that historically a society of au- tonomous human beings does not and could not spring into existence, but must emerge from a long and painful gestation, then we can only agree. But to suppose that such a society can not sustain itself without exploiting some of its members, and particularly those assigned the task of socializing the young, is to despair. Perhaps every social sys- tem exploits its primary socializers; if so, then Baier is right. But being right would give her no reason to single out a liberal morality for con- demnation. I remain, however, optimistic enough to believe, or at least to hope, that she is mistaken, and that persons will freely choose the affective ties needed to base an ongoing intergenerational contract in emotion as well as in reason. Through agreement we may find true partnership, redeeming by moral artifice the claims of the heart.
