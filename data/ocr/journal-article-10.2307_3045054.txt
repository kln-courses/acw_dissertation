<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Marksman of Ravenswood: Power and Legitimacy in The Bride of Lammermoor ROBERT C. GORDON (9N E of the sharpest ironies of The Bride of Lammermoor lies in the fact that the hero's single most decisive and heroic act generates the major tragic action of the novel. The incident in chapter 5 in which Edgar Ravenswood brings down a charging bull at the feet of Sir William Ashton and his daughter Lucy inaugurates a love affair that ulti- mately contributes to the stabbing of a bridegroom, the madness and death of Lucy herself, the ruin of one family, and the death through extinction of another. Edgar's miraculous shot preserves two lives, but the final consequence of his benign violence is a more terrible catastrophe than the one averted. Nevertheless, there is profit to be gained from separating Ed- gar's deed from its consequences and viewing it in the context not only of preceding events but also against the historical background of an eighteenth-century British debate concerning what social ar- rangements best encouraged precisely the sort of helpful violence represented by Edgar's exploit. This debate repeatedly set the landed freehold, both as true and normative property and as generator of martial virtis, over against the modern drift toward abstraction and alienation represented by the financial and military revolutions of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Opponents of these ? 1986 by The Regents of the University of California 49</page><page sequence="2">50 NINETEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE innovative ideas developed-not always with full awareness of the implications of their arguments-a myth of earth-centered power vital to an understanding of the significance of Edgar's exploit and its relationship to the value system of the novel. MOreover, once this relationship is clearly perceived, we will discover that, when rejoined to a consideration of its ultimate consequences, Edgar's rescue sharpens the irony and deepens the tragedy of the conclusion. The episode deserves generous quotation and summary. The Lord Keeper of Scotland, Sir William Ashton, and his daughter Lucy are walking through part of an "extensive chase" that belongs to the estate, now his, that was formerly in the possession of the Ravenswood family. The strollers are first threatened and then charged by a bull belonging to an ancient, savage, and misanthropic race of cattle: It seemed inevitable that the father or daughter, or both, should have fallen victims to the impending danger, when a shot from the neighbouring thicket arrested the progress of the animal. He was so truly struck between the junction of the spine with the skull, that the wound, which in any other part of his body might scarce have impeded his career, proved instantly fatal. Stumbling forward with a hideous bellow, the progressive force of his pre- vious motion, rather than any operation of his limbs, carried him up to within three yards of the astonished Lord Keeper, where he rolled on the ground, his limbs darkened with the black death- sweat, and quivering with the last convulsions of muscular motion. Lucy lay senseless on the ground, insensible of the wonderful deliverance which she had experienced. Her father was almost equally stupefied, so rapid and unexpected had been the transition from the horrid death which seemed inevitable to perfect security. He gazed on the animal, terrible even in death, with a species of mute and confused astonishment, which did not permit him dis- tinctly to understand what had taken place; and so inaccurate was his consciousness of what had passed, that he might have supposed the bull had been arrested in its career by a thunderbolt, had he not observed among the branches of the thicket the figure of a man, with a short gun or musquetoon in his hand. This instantly recalled him to a sense of their situation: a glance at his daughter. reminded him of the necessity of procuring her assistance.... The huntsman approached them accordingly, and the Lord Keeper saw he was a stranger, but was too much agitated to make any farther remarks. In a few hurried words he</page><page sequence="3">THE BRIDE OF LAMMERMOOR 51 directed the shooter, as stronger and more active than himself, to carry the young lady to a neighbouring fountain, while he went ... to procure more aid. The man to whose timely interference they had been so much indebted did not seem inclined to leave his good work half fin- ished. He raised Lucy from the ground in his arms, and conveying her through the glades of the forest by paths with which he seemed well acquainted, stopped not until he laid her in safety by the side of a plentiful and pellucid fountain.' After the rescue, Sir William attempts to express his thanks: "This gentleman . . . will, I trust, not regret the trouble we have given him, when I assure him of the gratitude of the Lord Keeper for the greatest service which one man ever rendered to another-for the life of my child-for my own life, which he has saved by his bravery and presence of mind. He will, I am sure, permit us to request "Request nothing of ME, my lord," said the stranger, in a stern and peremptory tone; "I am the Master of Ravenswood." (ch. 5) Lars Hartveit has accurately described the effect of this episode: The whole scene could have been taken from one of Lucy's ro- mances: the wild cattle grazing in the gloomy park-the sudden attack-the unerring shot from the thicket at the nick of time- the mysterious appearance of a handsome young man seemingly out of nowhere.2 But the significance of the scene derives largely from the fact that it is not from one of Lucy's romances but is continuous with Scott's normal representational narrative style-a style that, as Hartveit points out, can often be skeptical of romantic credulity. Here, then, is an act which, within the novel's own stylistic norms, is, at least for the moment, uniquely successful and uniquely "ro- mantic." The local populace, out of courtesy and perhaps some pity and affection, have bestowed upon Edgar the title of Master 'Sir Walter Scott, The Bride of Lammermoor, Vol. 8 of the Waverley Novels, Dryburgh Edition (London: A. and C. Black, 1893), ch. 5; subsequent refer- ences are from this edition and are incorporated into the text. 2Scott's "The Bride of Lammermoor": An Assessment of Attitude (Bergen: Nor- wegian Universities Press, 1962), p. 8.</page><page sequence="4">52 NINETEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE of Ravenswood. After so decisive an exploit the reader may well feel that the title has acquired a new significance and that Edgar's peremptory announcement has a new, pragmatic justification. By his own skill, assisted by an experienced acquaintance with the estate and its byways, he has preserved two lives from destruction by a hostile force. His performance becomes all the more impressive when set beside the character and behavior of Sir William. Edgar exhibits unusual skill, an intimate knowledge of the estate, and a capacity for intense concentration on the task at hand. Sir William exhibits very nearly the perfect opposite. Lucy herself knows the Ravens- wood estate far better than he, and must for this reason be his guide, "for he was too much engrossed with his political labours, or with society, to be perfectly acquainted with his own extensive domains, and, moreover, was generally an inhabitant of the city of Edinburgh" (ch. 4). The importance of such a contrast is reinforced by an awareness that absence is one of the novel's most important motifs and that most of its meanings and associations are negative. (An exception, as might be expected, is Lady Ashton, whose absence can only mean a remission of the local effects of pride and malice.) Not only is Scotland like "an Irish estate, the property of an ab- sentee" (ch. 2), but the most villainous event in the novel, Lady Ashton's subversion through virtual imprisonment and her skilled psychological warfare of Lucy's commitment to Ravenswood, is in- directly assisted by his absence on the continent (chs. 27, 28). An awareness of the importance of this theme enables us to apply it to a judgment of a person's fitness for his station in the most literal sense. Thus in Edgar, Lucy, and Sir William, we encounter different ideas of what it means simply to be present in a particular place. Edgar's presence is so intimate and effective that he very nearly becomes a presence in the mythic sense. The character of Lucy's presence, whatever her other weaknesses, is positive. She exhibits a combination of aesthetic and humane awareness of the estate and its dependents that would augur well for her social value as the lady of any domain. It is Sir William who revealingly mocks this potentiality by a joking reference to her -concern for "every boor about the castle" (ch. 3). Despite his ability to respond to the natural beauties of his property, his presence can be most accurately de-</page><page sequence="5">THE BRIDE OF LAMMERMOOR 53 scribed as disguised absence.3 If local knowledge and identification are important criteria, Sir William is unfit for his station. Under no circumstances could he become "the Master of Ravenswood" in a complete and beneficial sense. It is necessary, however, to ac- knowledge that insofar as Edgar's success implies a capacity for brilliant deeds of violence, this is an amoral potentiality that would have served him equally well had he been stalking Sir William with an intent to kill. Of this, more later. How much significance should we attach to the sharp contrast in presence and mastery between Ravenswood and Ashton? An answer might be suggested by the section of the novel that precedes Edgar's deed of rescue. If any one issue dominates these early chapters, it is that of the rightful ownership of the Ravenswood estate. In the first paragraph of the tale we are informed that the castle had a history of conflict-of being "besieged with ar- dour, and defended with obstinacy" (ch. 2). But in the Ashton- Ravenswood conflict, more indirect methods of siegecraft seem to have decided the issue. By means of judicious purchase and legal and political manipulation in times of social turmoil, Sir William achieved what in the past the brutality of direct assault had failed to bring about-the alienation of the Ravenswood estate from its hereditary possessors. In his brief history of the estate, Scott maintains at least the stance of editorial neutrality. At no time does he directly accuse Ashton of theft through chicanery, although his reminder that bad times breed bad law (ch. 2) suggests and helps us to interpret what Scott was later to make more explicit, that "the broad principles of justice ... were not quite so favourable to the Lord Keeper as those of strict law" (ch. 15). But Scott's judicious reserve gives a special 3In an early exchange between Ashton and a somewhat impertinent forester, the latter rebukes his master for his failure to participate in the chase and holds Edgar Ravenswood up as a model. In some discomfort at the forester's "ha- rangue," Ashton bestows an awkward and premature gratuity, which the ser- vant receives "as the waiter of a fashionable hotel receives double his proper fee from the hands of a country gentleman-that is, with a smile, in which pleasure at the gift is mingled with contempt for the ignorance of the donor" (ch. 3). Here the theme of absence is reinforced by association with a world of cosmopolitan rootlessness and conveys an impression of Sir William as a man out of place at Ravenswood.</page><page sequence="6">54 NINETEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE vitality to the question of rightful possession, at least to those read- ers who might seek an escape from the verbal effects of editorial caution. The style that frustrates an appetite for certainty simul- taneously arouses a desire to look elsewhere for an answer. Anyone seeking to understand the issues of property and pos- session, presence and activity, in The Bride of Lammermoor must begin with Alexander Welsh's study of these issues in The Hero of the Waverley Novels, for it is Welsh who lays down the terms in which the issues are to be discussed, and in so explicit a way that this article must be considered an attempt to complete Welsh's own line of argument. Central to Welsh's thesis is the problematic relation- ship between Property and the capacity for violence. For Welsh, the Scott hero is very nearly the personification of Property in its inhibiting power. Since Property is, in Burke's words, "sluggish, inert and timid," the person who represents and supports its restrictive and prescriptive values will be passive, prudent, and surprisingly inactive even when action seems called for. Welsh recog- nizes that Ravenswood is something of an exception among Wav- erley heroes, for he is "distinctive, essentially unattractive, and therefore interesting." But the thesis is not modified, for Edgar "suffers his fate passively, albeit passionately."4 He is, in short, an ordinary Scott hero with a few quirks. But does not Edgar's rescue of the Ashtons bring into question his membership in Scott's brotherhood of inert heroes? To such a question Welsh's study contains some implied answers. One of these-and here I am ascribing to Welsh an argument that Welsh could, but does not, apply to Ravenswood-might stress the essen- tially harmless character of Edgar's feat. The Scott hero, Welsh generalizes, "never kills anyone."5 Edgar's superb shot is, after all, directed only at an animal, and the generalization holds. Moreover, we never actually witness Edgar in the act of firing his weapon. It is as if Scott wished to draw a veil over his hero even as he performs a violent deed of the most benign sort. Edgar's feat may thus be said to confirm rather than challenge Welsh's thesis. 'The Hero of the Waverley Novels (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1963), pp. 45, 44, and, for the Burke quotation, p. 122. I am grateful to Alexander Welsh for reading and criticizing this article, and for certain suggestions that I have followed. 'Welsh, The Hero of the Waverley Novels, p. 223.</page><page sequence="7">THE BRIDE OF LAMMERMOOR 55 Nevertheless, for this reader the above circumstances do not significantly alter one's perception of Edgar's deed as an extraor- dinary achievement for a hero supposedly passive and inert. For one thing, the shot itself is very nearly miraculous. An enraged and charging bull is certainly not a man; he is, in fact, worse-more dangerous because less vulnerable. He had to be "truly struck be- tween the junction of the spine with the skull" and nowhere else, and even after this he is "terrible even in death" (ch. 5). Such a victim at the very least increases our respect for the power and address of the marksman. It would be depressing to consider the consequences had his target been Sir William. Another reason for reconsidering Edgar's relation to the Welsh thesis lies in the invisibility already referred to. There is no impres- sion conveyed that the author is discreetly shielding us from the sight of violence out of some commitment to an ideal of heroic passivity. Invisibility actually enhances the impression of power and efficiency; we hear "a shot from the neighbouring thicket," and we perceive its effect. The man is lost in his deed; he is all act. Edgar's invisibility, in fact, invites a broadly martial approval. For a marks- man, what could be a better situation than his? A third reason can be found in that fantastic character of the episode noted by Hartveit. The rescue is a notable example of Scott's characteristic romanticism of graceful and marvelous action in an intimately known natural setting.6 Edgar is first glimpsed by Sir William "among the branches of the thicket." After his later self-revelation he mutters a few civilities and "was immediately lost in the thicket." These are the appearances and vanishings of ro- mance, and they suggest skills and capacities that would appear marvelous to any outsider, including the reader. One way of explaining Edgar's unusual skills and assessing their significance for The Bride of Lammermoor would be to keep Welsh's thesis in mind and to seek out and examine those property relations which might facilitate such skills.

Gordon, "Scott, Fer- guson, and the Martial Spirit," Scottish Tradition, 6 (1976), 66-82.</page><page sequence="8">56 NINETEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE ages such a move because he singles out the abstract character of modern property as a restraint upon activity: Property is an idea.... The "rights of things" are not invested in the thing or land itself: property is an abstract relation between things and persons.... The idea of property does not concern the actual activity of sowing and reaping, eating and sleeping, but the expectation of these things, the "right" to them. And later: The Heart of Mid-Lothian reveals that the "reality" defended by the Waverley Novels is an abstract construction. It is a "reality prin- ciple," not a concrete fact; it does not have the weight and solidity of wood or iron. But it is strong: all the tentative romantic energies, and wicked impulses as well, are constrained by a vast network of relations, of pacts and polity, promises and property, which is civil society.' Elsewhere Welsh defines property as a kind of disembodied force making for stability: "In some passages of Burke it stands for the very existence of things, a static principle, a motionless power in the midst of things, opposed to dangerous and unpredictable ener- gies of all kinds." It might be observed that property as symbol or "static principle" has little to do with the actual character of pos- sessions-of things owned. Yet Welsh's definitions do not encourage a very concrete image of such possessions, for their "weight and solidity" have evaporated into an abstract world of rights, promises, and expectations. Moreover, Welsh affirms that different temper- aments will be suited to different types of property and modes of possession. Thus the passive and obedient hero will be rewarded with the most stable or inert kind of property, an estate, while the dark heroine, Rebecca of Ivanhoe, for example, will own wealth in the form of "conveyables," a circumstance which accords with her romantic and generous impulses to give property away to others.8 But if different sorts of property suit different temperaments, might there not exist a sort of property relationship that is appro- priate to the Ravenswood who displays such skill in his rescue of the Ashtons? The answer is both affirmative and paradoxical. The 'Welsh, The Hero of the Waverley Novels, pp. 96, 140. 8Ibid., pp. 121, 116.</page><page sequence="9">THE BRIDE OF LAMMERMOOR 57 possession of an estate is precisely the circumstance that not only suits the temperament of Edgar as romantic rescuer but more spe- cifically encourages and stimulates the skill and address that he exhibits; yet the estate is also a source of the "passive income from land" that Welsh singles out as an appropriate final reward for his inert and submissive Scott heroes.9 With what is the estate to be identified-inertia, or romantic exploit? Scott himself might provide us with some help in reconciling this apparent contradiction. Whenever he was alarmed by radical disturbances such as those of 1819, he sought means to resist them. In a letter to Lord Melville he wrote: "It is the middle class which requires to be put on the guard every man who has or cultivates a furrow of land or has a guinea in the funds or vested in stock in trade or in mortgage or in any other way whatsoever.'0 Anyone seeking to relate notions of property and notions of violence should study this sentence, for Scott is thinking not only of the mobilization of opinion but also of men, horses, and weapons. The determi- nation to defend property of all sorts carries an enormous poten- tiality for violence, albeit of a defensive sort. But the sentence also implies degrees of motivation. If its sequence places symbolic, abstract, or promissory possession alongside the more concrete ownership of land, it nonetheless puts the traditional landed re- lationship first and moves through the other forms of property until it dissipates itself in the somewhat vaporous "whatsoever." We will learn more about the significance of Scott's emphasis and its application to the question of heroic activity, including Ra- venswood's, if we examine some of the historical roots of the dis- tinction that Scott implies. Was there, for example, a period in British history when men were acutely aware of emerging differ- ences in types of property and modes of possession? And if so, did it produce theories of property and the possibilities for effective action that measured one sort of property or type of ownership against others? The answers to both questions are affirmative. What is more, although the chronological coincidence does not play an 9Welsh, The Hero of the Waverley Novels, p. 118.

In his study of the fate of Machiavellian notions of civic virtu in the Anglophone world, J.G.A. Pocock points out that in the final decades of the seventeenth century Credit came increasingly to usurp the mythic power over men's imaginations previously wielded by Machiavelli's fortuna or occasione. A necessity for trade as well as for the wars undertaken to protect it, Credit assumed increasing importance with the emergence of the Bank of England and the National Debt as means of carrying on large state enterprises. But Credit, while both powerful and capricious, was also highly abstract. Defoe described it as follows: Like the soul in the body it acts as all substance, yet it is itself immaterial; it gives motion, yet it cannot be said to exist; it creates forms, yet has it self no form; it is neither quantity nor quality, it has not whereness, or whenness, site or habit. If I should say it is the essential shadow of something that is not, should I not puzzle the thing rather than explain it, and leave you and myself more in the dark than we were before?'2 By reason of its attenuated, abstract, and promissory character, Credit could be said to have completed the process of abstraction from "the weight and solidity of wood or iron" begun long before by the invention of money, which, as Locke pointed out, was itself a creature of "Fancy and agreement." 13 It would have been natural at this time for many to elevate land over credit and its symbols as the more sound and traditional of the two modes of property. Robert Molesworth, for example, wanted a parliament composed of men with estates, "and those not "See Pocock's important chapter, "Neo-Machiavellian Political Economy: The Augustan Debate over Land, Trade and Credit," in his The Machiavellian Mo- ment: Florentine Political Thought and the Atlantic Republican Tradition (Princeton: Princeton Univ.

To which end, every Merchant, Banker, or other money'd Man, who is ambitious of serving his Country as a Senator, shou'd also have a competent, visible Land Estate."'4 But we come closer to the issues raised by the situation of Edgar Ravenswood when we recognize that the question of land versus credit and other forms of wealth was frequently interwoven with the debate over the most effective means by which the state could arrange what Maury D. Feld has called its "structure of violence."'5 By those who opposed Walpole and the new eco- nomic order he seemed to represent, Credit was seen as a partner of new military arrangements in leaching away the very aptitudes so conspicuously displayed in Edgar's rescue of the two Ashtons. In discussing these arrangements and their significance, I will adopt a broadly Weberian approach-one that would perceive debate over new modes of violence as an inevitable consequence of the progressive centralization and bureaucratization of power in the major European states. The Weberian context is suitable for two reasons. First, Weber and his followers strongly emphasized the importance of the control of the sword in justifying and furthering such centralization. 6 Second, Scott's own interest in both legitimate and illegitimate violence might seem less gratuitous or subliterary when properly related to larger considerations regarding the per- petually relevant and vexing issue of the social control of armed force. 17 In order to understand the connection between modes of prop- erty and structures of violence, we must recognize that the financial revolution ran concurrently with what some historians have called "4See Molesworth's preface to Francis Hotoman's Franco-Gallia; or, An Account of the Ancient Free State of France, trans.

A falcon had grown up that might well prefer neither to hear nor heed the falconer. But the new armies could also be viewed and condemned as part of an assault upon traditional social and martial values arising out of the personal ownership and management of landed and other sorts of property. Isaac Kramnick sees standing armies as part of a "new depersonalized world" which "seemed to render the individual helpless before forces much larger than himself." Hence the Augustan "Opposition's attack on the standing army must be understood partly as a rejection of an impersonal professional and rootless organization in the place of a more personal and locally based militia in which each man and his neighbor could perceive his own contributions."'9 The "credit mechanism" was not forgotten as an instrument in the hands of the new depersonalizing forces. In fact, Credit permitted and even encouraged wars in distant parts for secular ends, thus stimulating the existence and use of alienated military bodies. There developed a devilish mutuality of interest between soldiers and financial speculators-an interest eloquently "8Michael Roberts, The Military Revolution: 1560-1660 (Belfast: M.

Swift wrote: Let any Man observe the Equipages in this Town; he shall find the greater Number of those who make a Figure, to be a Species of Men quite different from any that were ever known before the Revolution; consisting of either Generals and Colonels, or of such whose whole Fortunes lie in Funds and Stocks: So that Power, which, according to the old Maxim, was used to follow Land, is now gone over to Money; and the Country Gentleman is in the condition of a young Heir, out of whose Estate a Scrivener receives half the Rents for Interest, and hath a Mortgage on the Whole; and is therefore always ready to feed his Vices and Extravagancies while there is any Thing left. So that if the War continue some years longer, a Landed Man will be little better than a Farmer at a rack Rent, to the Army, and to the publick Funds.20 In attacking both the world of new finance and that of new arms, Swift is reacting to a double assault upon both the image and character of the landed freehold. At the same time that the landed freehold is losing its normative position in the very definition of property, it is also losing its identification with the national thymos- the resolve to defend and assert the country's interests through force. It is when we examine the polemical countermeasures taken against this new world of alienated properties, powers, and func- tions that we begin to approach the world of romantic action ex- emplified by Edgar Ravenswood and to perceive relationships between conditions of possession and potentialities for violent ac- tion. Briefly, spokesmen for landed traditionalism argued for land as the center of the full range of human capacities attributable to the rounded, omnicompetent zoon politikon whose faculties were being parceled out among new and distant specializations.2' Among these faculties was martial capacity. Other forms of property and ownership, as long as they could be seen as analogous to the landed freehold in their immediate connection with personal interest and passion, were admitted, but, as in Scott's sequence of energizing 20Jonathan Swift, ed., The Examiner, and other Pieces Written in 1710-11, ed.

Swift gives us a hint of this ideal when the King of Brobdingnag, outraged at Gulliver's account of Europe's kings and armies, asks "whether a private Man's House might not better be defended by himself, his Children, and Family; than by half a Dozen Rascals picked up at a Venture in the Streets, for small Wages, who might get an Hundred Times more by cutting their Throats?"23 Here the theme of property enters a new key. The impressed and regimented instruments of the new modes of violence are beyond all property, abstract or concrete. They are propertyless ne'er-do-wells with an appetite for the property of others. But we should note that the phrase "better defended" implies competence as well as social ap- propriateness. The private man in his house is a better soldier than the hireling or the conscript. Similarly, the Molesworth who pre- ferred stable to fleeting sorts of property located true soldiership in a man with "Wife and Children, and an Estate to fight for" rather than "the poor swaggering Idler" in a red coat.24 Thus the freehold could be placed in opposition (as true and normative property and as generator of martial virtu) to the modern drift toward abstraction and alienation represented by both the financial and military rev- 22A sense of expanding economic activities is conveyed in one 1803 sequence, which depicts the British people as quitting "their ploughs, their looms, their mines, and their hearths" to take up arms against a possible invasion (Reflexions on the Invasion of Great Britain by the French Armies [Birmingham, 1803], p. 17). 23Gulliver's Travels, 1726, in Vol. 11 of The Prose Works of Jonathan Swift, ed.

Before dismissing Swift and Molesworth as polemical fantasists we should at least recognize that the new instruments of national violence could be realistically perceived as dangerously antidomes- tic. Long before Gulliver's Travels, Roger Boyle, himself a partisan of military modernism, expressed the view that the permanent and highly specialized character of modern military institutions was incompatible with rooted domesticity and warned that marriage inhibited soldiership "since the Married are generally too much incumbred to follow the War with that intentness of mind which the profession does require."25 But if Boyle was right, modern military structures subverted social foundations. One way of dis- couraging their development was to reclaim for the freehold the capacity to stimulate martial zeal, concentration, address, and "in- tentness of mind." In doing this, opponents of the new military structures carried as far as fantasy allowed what can only be defined as a restatement in modern terms of the myth of Antaeus and the energizing power of the earth.26 This power, however, was regu- 25[Orrery], Roger Boyle, A Treatise of the Art of War: Dedicated to the Kings Most Excellent Majesty (London: Printed by T. N. for Henry Herringman, 1677), pp. 19-20. 26Those familiar with eighteenth-century political discourse will ask why I prefer Antaeus to Cincinnatus as classical paradigm. There are two reasons. First, the Cincinnatus of Livy and others was hardy and skillful in large part because he was a farmer; nevertheless, he lacked the special sort of passionate identification given by interest and close connection with a particular property. Second, his rustic hardihood and, above all, his return to the soil after his military exploits, themselves echo the Antaeus motif, that of the earth as re- juvenator. I suggest that the Cincinnatus legend can be viewed as a myth of magical, earth-generated power, moralized, secularized, and adapted to a sit- uation in which the freehold must share power with a capital center-a situation found in Republican Rome and, of course, in eighteenth-century England. The Cincinnatus story can account for much in the British debate over centralized authority, but cannot account entirely for the suggestion of power through contact or proximity developed in the hyperbole of debate. Such imagined power may well have contributed to a belief in the militia as a regenerative force-an institutional means of returning the nation to its true source of strength. See Kramnick, Bolingbroke and His Circle, p. 166. The classic version of the Cincinnatus story is to be found in Livy, III, 26-29. For an influential exercise of scholarly skepticism upon Livy's story, see B. G. Niebuhr, The History of Rome, trans. Julius Charles Hare and Connop Thirlwall, 3rd ed. rev., 3 vols.

As Charles Sackville argued, "Men of Property may safely be trusted with Arms; for they will not disturb the Peace of their own Possessions; nor ever rise against a Govern- ment, that shall protect their Liberties and Fortunes."27 Unlike Swift's regimented cutthroats, such men could easily identify their interest with society's, and for this very reason, words like "prohibition" or ''repression," with their implications of psychological discomfort, cannot be applied to this natural relationship between the capacity for extraordinary violence and the discipline that should attend it. At a time when the most conspicuous instruments of disciplined violence were large bodies apparently composed of unpropertied men set apart from their communities, opponents of the new struc- tures set in operation what the Marxist critic FredricJameson might call a "delaying tactic" against a significant new sort of alienation.28 Jameson uses this phrase to categorize Romanticism as a movement in European history, but it is clear that the polemical myth of the propertied Antaeus must be considered part of such a movement. And at this point we may with profit recall the previously mentioned harmless character of Edgar's shot. That the presence of Lucy may have saved Ashton's life is suggested by Edgar when he refers to her as Ashton's possible "guardian angel" (ch. 5). I would suggest another operative force. Observing events from his place in the thicket, Edgar could hardly be said to have chosen his course of action. I believe that he was possessed by the role of the possessor at his most heroic and responsible. In one instinctive act he ex- emplified all the virtues of action that landed possession could bestow-marvelous skill and address in the use of violence and a gallant and spontaneous confinement of that use to protective and humane purposes. But his deed is romantically attractive in part because for more than a century before Scott, British polemicists had been engaged in a debate whose subject was remarkably similar to Welsh's-the relationship between property and the capacity for action. 27[Dorset], Charles Sackville, 2nd Duke of Dorset, A Treatise Concerning the Militia, in Four Sections (London: printed for J.

How could some- thing so easily dismissible as a futile and nostalgic gesture in the face of inevitable changes in the structure and management of violence still succeed in exerting power over the imagination as late as 1819, the year of the novel's appearance? One answer is simply and obviously institutional: the prescribed annual debates in a par- liament that had long insisted on maintaining at least a nominal control over the military purse. Moreover, these debates were al- most guaranteed to sustain a classic dualism between "head" and "heart," order and spontaneity, bureaucratic rationalism and local exuberance because the two chief instruments of land warfare, army and militia, were so frequently the subject of discussion, and each encouraged a rhetoric appropriate to one or the other set of opposing values.29 As long as a militia could be depicted as a truly indigenous force opposed in character and superior in effectiveness to regimented bodies of impressed misfits contemptuously referred to as "redcoats," there were bound to be celebrations of armed domesticity and local tactical power. Such celebrations were en- couraged by the ultimate military success of the rebellious American colonists, who were seen to demonstrate the superiority of the armed freehold over the formally embodied military unit.30 The importance of the American example illustrates the sec- ond reason for the myth's persistence: its political ambivalence. Beginning as a neo-Machiavellian and Harringtonian example with strong republican implications, the modern Antaeus became a weapon against Walpole in the hands of Bolingbroke and his party, resumed a strong republican character among sympathizers with the American cause, and finally passed into the hands of Britain's 29See J. R. Western, The English Militia in the Eighteenth Century: The Story of a Political Issue, 1660-1802 (London: Routledge and K. Paul, 1965), pp. 89-103, for a brief summary of some of the basic arguments, pro and con, of the militia controversy. 30"That the colonists had won their liberty, arms in their hands, strengthened the belief in militia institutions and in the 'natural' soldier springing from the outdoor bourgeois and farmer" (Alfred Vagts, A History of Militarism: Civilian and Military, rev. ed.

This last cooptation of the Antaeus figure is understandable when we consider how naturally revolutionary and Napoleonic warfare could be perceived as a vast, centralized assault upon property and locality throughout Europe. For this reason, fear of the new Caesar and the desire to develop a patriotic rhetoric of resistance led to hectic celebrations of domestic valor such as Wordsworth's remarkable insistence in The Convention of Cintra that when a people are called suddenly to fight for their liberty,-their best field of battle is the floors upon which their children have played; the chambers where the family of each man has slept (his own or his neighbours'); upon or under the roofs by which they have been sheltered; in the gardens of their recreation; in the street, or in the market-place; before the altars of their Temples; and among their congregated dwellings-blazing, or uprooted.3' This is Swift's "private Man" defending his house now strikingly intensified. The argumentative usefulness of this image was ob- viously greater for whichever side of any political or military conflict that could best invoke the theme of the threatened freehold. It is this pivotal motif that connects Wordsworth's belligerent Spaniards with, on the one hand, the most emphatic American assertion of the Antaeus image, Daniel Chester French's Concord Minuteman, and on the other, Edgar Ravenswood, whose skill is partly the consequence of his intimate acquaintance with disputed land. Scott was not a self-conscious or sophisticated philosopher con- cerning the relation between property and violence. Moreover, his own activities as economic man involved him in an extraordinary contradiction. Few entrepreneurs have made such an extensive use of distant and symbolic modes of finance, and yet few men have taken such delight in the ownership of landed property and the activities, including the potentially violent ones, encouraged by such ownership. The sentence in the letter to Melville cited above ac- knowledges the potentiality of all property, including paper tokens of possession, for stimulating action. Moreover, in another letter 3"The Prose Works of William Wordsworth, ed. Alexander B. Grosart, 3 vols. (London: E. Moxon, 1876), II, 65-66.

"32 But The Bride of Lammermoor possesses its own implications regarding the relations between property and power. One means of grasping these implications has already been suggested. By pur- suing the history of a particular controversy regarding the proper and effective grounds of violent action, we can perceive how inti- mately considerations of property and possession were intertwined with notions of heroic action. Out of the political controversy there arose an ideal of guiltless and successful violence properly adjusted to need and circumstance. Edgar's rescue of the Ashtons, a rescue whose romantic character is in part an extension of the military address ascribed to the propertied warrior in the hyperbole of political debate, achieves a flawless conformity with this ideal. He is alert, watchful, and deadly, and he seems to know the territory so well that he may be said to carry a map of the terrain in his mind. But Edgar's skill is profoundly out of keeping with his situation if we remember that he is not in fact the owner of the property he knows and uses so well. In his discussion of Edgar's rescue, A.O.J. Cockshut makes a creative and helpful error. Although Scott makes it clear that Edgar killed the bull with a musquetoon, Cockshut tells us that he used an arrow.33 The error is understandable when we consider that Edgar is like a Robin Hood, enveloped by thickets, intimately acquainted with the ways of the forest, yet formally and perhaps unjustly denied a rightful stake in the territory he com- mands and in need of a higher authority to vindicate his right.34 32The Letters of Sir Walter Scott, VI, 428 (quoted in Welsh, The Hero of the Waverley Novels,'p. 109). 33The Achievement of Walter Scott (New York: New York Univ. Press, 1969), p. 83. Cockshut, I suspect, momentarily confused Edgar's weapon with the crossbow with which young Henry Ashton kills a raven. See Cockshut, p. 84, and The Bride of Lammermoor, ch. 20. 34Locksley's "right" is that of a huntsman and yeoman deprived of forest rights by unjust game laws. See Scott's Ivanhoe, ch. 41.</page><page sequence="20">68 NINETEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE The skills of both Locksley and Ravenswood illustrate that a man dispossessed of a territory by processes of law is not thereby dis- possessed of those capacities bestowed by rightful presence or pos- session. The issue is far more important in The Bride of Lammermoor than in Ivanhoe, and Edgar's deed may be seen as an important gloss on the question of true ownership previously raised by Scott. We are, I think, justified in reasoning from Edgar's deed to the implications suggested by the polemical tradition concerning arms and property. This involves more than trusting the tale rather than the teller; it also requires that we see the inevitable associations concerning propriety and right that were part of the established context in which such deeds as the rescue were perceived. Once these associations are considered, Edgar's shot from the thicket becomes an abrupt and monosyllabic affirmation of rightful pos- session. Ashton is ironically rescued because alienation by abstract processes of law can only accomplish so much. More Herculean strength and enterprise are needed to separate Antaeus from the source of his strength. Antaeus depended upon physical contact with the earth. Sim- ilarly, Edgar's rescue suggests the importance of the physical, the immediate, the concrete. It is true that, living in the age of Walpole, he must accommodate himself to a world of promises, velleities, and distant adjudications, but he is often impatient in such circum- stances. His words to Ashton on the loss of his family's estate play upon the difference between real and immediate deeds involving skills in violence and the consequences of legal complexities and apparent ambiguities: "Sir William Ashton ... the lands which you now occupy were granted to my remote ancestor for services done with his sword against the English invaders. How they have glided from us by a train of proceedings that seem to be neither sale, nor mortgage, nor adjudication for debt, but a nondescript and entangled mix- ture of all these rights; how annual rent has been accumulated upon principal, and no nook or coign of legal advantage left un- occupied, until our interest in our hereditary property seems to have melted away like an icicle in thaw-all this you understand better than I do." (ch. 16) This appetite for clarity and immediacy achieves its most des- perate expression in his refusal to accept a scrap of paper as suf-</page><page sequence="21">THE BRIDE OF LAMMERMOOR 69 ficient evidence of Lucy's wish to terminate their engagement. His confrontation with Lucy and her family appeals to Lucy's, his own, and the reader's desire for, in Lucy's words, "direct communication": "If this young lady, of her own free will, desires the restoration of this contract, as her letter would seem to imply, there is not a withered leaf which this autumn wind strews on the heath that is more valueless in my eyes. But I must and will hear the truth from her own mouth; without this satisfaction I will not leave this spot." (ch. 33) It is true, as Welsh points out, that "Scott did not greatly con- tribute to the 'protest on behalf of value' that Alfred North White- head discovered in the romantic movement."35 Moreover, Scott lacks anything resembling Blake's mythic thoroughness in setting forth the ultimate consequences of the division between the abstract and the concrete. But he does derive, or attempt to derive, considerable narrative satisfaction or even excitement from moments when is- sues are clarified by direct confrontation and narratives thereby take new directions. Young Lochinvar comes out of the West (not an irrelevant example given the similarities between the situation in the poem and the episode of Edgar's final challenge to Lucy and the Ashtons), Jeanie Deans confronts the queen, Henry Morton seeks out Burley in his cave, Ravenswood confronts Sir William after the rescue. This appetite for directness and immediacy is significant, for if the justice of Edgar's claim upon Lucy can be argued from the validity and sincerity of the betrothal, that claim can also be seen as an attempt to resume through marriage a com- plex of positive and direct relations attendant upon the legitimate occupation of a particular property. But among the direct and immediate encounters possible for any proprietor of Ravenswood Castle we must include the con- frontation with hostile violence. That the attacker brought down by Edgar was a beast in no way detracts from his importance as a symbol of all potential menace within or without the realm. Scott's somewhat anthropomorphic reference to the breed's "antipathy to the human race" (ch. 5) converts these animals into potential forces to be defended against, and here Edgar's exploit, as well as the 35Welsh, The Hero of the Waverley Novels, p. 137.</page><page sequence="22">70 NINETEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE atmosphere of romantic success that Scott bestows upon it, signif- icantly establishes him as unique in heroic potential. There is no one quite like him. This circumstance gives a peculiarly pragmatic edge to the justice of his claim upon Lucy, for it acquires an ad- ditional validity from the rounded totality of benign capacities that would have been achieved had he been successful in his suit. Edgar's loyalty to the estate as inheritance and his skill as defender, joined with Lucy's humane interest in its tenants and dependents, would approach a satisfying union of Power and Charity. What we get in its place is a deserted strongpoint without even an Ashton to defend it. The Bride of Lammermoor is, at least in part, the tragedy of a lost national resource. As a response to a vast, apparently encyclopedic, alienation and abstraction of functions, the glorification of landed wealth and power was bound to have an appeal for Scott, whose intense local attachment was seldom without a degree of defensive belligerence. The whole Border region could be viewed as an extension of the Ravenswood estate, "in times of foreign war and domestic discord ... besieged with ardour, and defended with obstinacy." In his own time of war, revolution, and popular commotion, Scott was never for long able to envision a remission of danger. His last years were full of anxiety over radical disturbances, an anxiety reflected in his urgent appeals for the continuation in being of a local yeomanry.36 Considered within the Weberian historical framework, which em- phasizes the growth of bureaucratic permanence, centrality, and sophistication, Scott is by no means to be classified as an adminis- trative Luddite. In 1826, for example, his Malachi Malagrowther complained that centrally controlled and maintained regular forces were being neglected and denied to Scotland.37 Nevertheless-and here we may indulge in the luxury of ascribing to Scott a perfect and total consistency-no model of the national structure of vio- lence was either safe or complete without the enforcing and coun- terbalancing weight of the noblesse campagnarde, one of whose 36The Journal of Sir Walter Scott, ed.

Edgar's exploit, "like one of Lucy's romances," gives justice to his efforts to resume his role as the estate's legitimate proprietor and defender. At the conclusion of his study of Scott's heroes, Welsh asserts that "the Waverley Novels tell an extraordinary tale of property and force." Of none of them is this truer than of The Bride of Lammermoor.
