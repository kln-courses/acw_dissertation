Weniger1 Magdalenian material from northern Switzerland, southwestern and south eastern Germany, the middle Rhine, and central Germany is examined for differences among these geographical areas. Several regional features, including a broad range of archaeological data, can be identified and indicate two regional groupings, a southwestern and a northeastern. The first includes sites from central Germany and the middle Rhine, while the second includes northern Switzerland and southwestern Germany. The southeastern German sites cannot be firmly placed within this pattern because of the insecure data base. The main differences are in prey species, hunting and settlement patterns, and some characteristics of the mobile art. The comparison does not allow a finer sepa ration, although the two regional groups could probably be subdivided into smaller geographical units. Alternative explanations are discussed and further avenues of research are proposed. KEY WORDS: Magdalenian; Central Europe; regionality; settlement pattern; site-types. INTRODUCTION The region investigated here reaches from the Elbe valley in the north to the Alps in the south, including the southern parts of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany and northern Switzerland. This is the so-called "middle mountain zone," at 500-1000 m above sea level (asl). The area consists of river valley and some basin landscapes. The main river systems are the Danube, flowing from west to east, and the Rhine, which 'Deutsches Archaologisches Institut, Serrano 159, E-28002 Madrid, Spain. 323 0892-7537/89/0900-0323506.00/0 ? 1989 Plenum Publishing Corporation</page><page sequence="2">324 Weniger Fig. 1.

More than 150 Magdalenian sites are known from this area and 75 of them are included in this study (Fig. 1). Caves and rockshelters predominate in northern Switzerland, Swabia, and Bavaria, and open-air sites (many of them surface sites only) in the middle Rhine and central Germany. Many open-air and small cave sites are poorly known. Most were excavated before World War II and the collections are often dispersed or lost. Some have never been published. Work on the Magdalenian began in this area in 1866 when Fraas started excavating the open-air site of Schussenquelle in the Alpine foothills in southwestern Germany (Miiller-Beck, 1983). The site produced a rich fauna of &gt; 400 reindeer (Adam, 1966) but very few stone artifacts. In 1870, Fraas conducted equally unsophisticated excavations at Hohler Fels Schelklingen in the southern Swabian Jura. Since that time, the Swabian Alb has been a focus of Paleolithic research with numerous caves and rockshelters. Important modern excavations have been at Brillenhohle (Riek, 1973) and the Felsstalle rockshelter, which yielded one of the richest Magdalenian lithic inventories in Central Europe (Kind, 1987). Hohler Fels Schelklingen was reexcavated in the late 1970s, revealing an important sequence of four Magdalenian layers (Hahn, 1977). A rockshelter outside the cave, Helga-Abri, was also reexcavated (Hahn, 1984a). Other small caves in the eastern Swabian Alb include sites in the Bruckersberg area (Riek, 1957) and in the Eselburger valley (Hahn, 1984b). The important material from Bockstein and Hohlestein in the Lone valley is still not published in detail (Hahn et al., 1973). Petersfels is one of the most important Magdalenian sites outside the Swabian Alb. It is a cave, slightly above the valley floor, with a large, well-preserved living area in front. It was first excavated in 1927 (Peters, 1930; Peters and Toepfer, 1932; Mauser, 1970). Excavations in front of the cave in the 1970s revealed a sequence of Magdalenian occupations (Albrecht, 1979; Albrecht et al, 1983). Another cluster of sites in the loess area of the upper Rhine Valley, of which the most important is the open-air site of Munzingen (Padtberg, 1925), was excavated before World War II. Excavations of Magdalenian sites began in Switzerland soon after those in Swabia. In 1873, Merk began the excavation of Kesslerloch in northern Switzerland (Merk, 1875), which was continued by Nuesch and Heierli (Nuesch, 1904; Heierli, 1907). The cave had a rich Magdalenian deposit &gt;2m thick but the stratigraphy was poorly studied; in 1980, a test pit outside the cave provided new information about the site (Ammann, 1988). The Schweizersbild rockshelter (Nuesch, 1896) has the same history as Kesslerloch. Beyond the Schaffhausen area, the valleys in the Swiss Jura were intensively investigated during the first two decades of this century. South of Basel is an important cluster of small and medium-sized caves; one of them, Hollenberg-Hdhle 3, was excavated in the 1950s and the</page><page sequence="4">326 Weniger collections have been restudied recently (Sedlmeier, 1982). In the southern Swiss Jura, there is another group of sites near Olten. There were many old excavations and one in the 1970s at a new site, the small cave of Rislisberg hohle (Barr, 1977; Stampfli, 1983). The large open-air site of Mossbuhl, which yielded rich collections and some interesting habitation structures, lies at the southern edge of our area of investigation (Barr, 1973, 1975; Schwab, 1972). In Bavaria, there is an important series of sites in the lower Altmuhl valley, but all suffered from early and inadequate excavation and most are still unpublished. To the west, at the border with Swabia, is a small cluster of sites in the Nordlingen Basin, of which one, Kaufertsberg, has been recently reinvestigated (Kaulich, 1983). The only modern excavation has been at the open-air site of Barbing, where, unfortunately, no fauna was preserved (Reisch, 1974). Gonnersdorf, one of the most important Magdalenian sites in Central Europe, lies in the middle Rhine valley; it was discovered in the late 1960s and excavated using modern techniques. Andernach is across the Rhine from Gonnersdorf; it was first investigated by Schaaffhausen at the end of the last century (Schaaffhausen, 1888; Bosinski and Hahn, 1973) but has recently been reexcavated (Veil, 1982,1984). Alsdorf, at the northwestern edge of our area, is another recently excavated open-air site. Part of it had already been destroyed but the remainder yielded a rich lithic industry and habitation structures; unfortunately, there was no fauna preserved (Lohr, 1979). Ober kassel, one of the rare Magdalenian burials (Veil, 1978), has been long known. Excavations in the Lahn caves date back to the 1870s, so documen tation of them is fragmentary. There are many sites in central Germany; most of them are open-air, often in sandy sediments, and many are surface sites with no organic preservation. There are also sites in the loess areas and some caves. Two of the most important sites are the caves of Kniegrotte and Teufelsbrucke. Kniegrotte was excavated in the 1930s by an amateur, so we have no strati graphic data (Feustel, 1974). Teufelsbrucke, nearby, was excavated in the early 1970s, but the sediments had been badly disturbed by later prehistoric occupations and by amateurs so, again, stratigraphic data are lacking (Feustel, 1980). Well-preserved, open-air sites, some in loess sediments and some with habitation structures, include Oelknitz (Behm-Blancke, 1970; Musil, 1985), Nebra (Hanitzsch and Toepfer, 1963; Toepfer, 1965), Bad Frankenhausen (Feustel, 1977), and Saaleck. The collections from Saaleck are stored partly in the German Democratic Republic (Hanitzsch, 1978) and partly in the Federal Republic of Germany (Terberger, 1987). It is thus apparent that the data available from the different regions of western Central Europe vary in quality. Only central Germany, southwestern</page><page sequence="5">The Magdalenian in Western Central Europe 327 Germany, and northern Switzerland have dense distributions of sites. There are few sites in the middle Rhine, although, fortunately, most of these have been recently excavated using modern techniques. In southeastern Germany, however, most of the excavations were done at the beginning of the century and there has been no reevaluation of the sites. On the whole, we are dependent in Central Europe mainly on data from old excavations that are controlled only partially by the results of modern studies; interpretation is, therefore, sometimes difficult. The first synthesis of the Magdalenian in Central Europe was by Schmidt (1912). Since then, regional syntheses have been written for Switzer land by Bandi (1947,1968), for Bavaria by Birkner (1936) and Freund (1964), for Swabia by Hahn (1979,1981) and Weniger (1982, 1987a), for the middle Rhine by Bosinski and Hahn (1973) and Veil (1978), and for central Germany by Feustel (1979). Although Magdalenian sites are less frequent and less rich in western Central Europe than in southwestern France or northern Spain, the density of sites is quite remarkable, and the available data are still manageable in quantity, which is an advantage. There is also information on sedimentation, geological deposits, paleoclimate, and paleovegetation, which makes possible more detailed study of man-land relationships in the various topograpic zones. Ethnoarchaeological approaches and a general interest in social behavior have seriously altered Paleolithic research in the last two decades. One important field of research is now regionally. The identification of regional groups is common in later prehistoric research but is only now beginning in Old World Paleolithic studies (Brown, 1987). The Magdalenian is probably the most suitable Paleolithic technocomplex for analysis of regional components and their relationships, and indeed, only by the identi fication of regional differences can we establish what the term Magdalenian really means. For example, is it comparable to an ethnohistorical taxonomic level like the subarctic Indians, or perhaps the Northern Athapaskan, or the Plateau Indians? RADIOCARBON DATING AND CHRONOLOGY Some 84 radiocarbon dates are available (Fig. 2), covering a time span from 17,100 to 10,230 B.P. Most dates fall between 13,000 and 12,000 B.P. and, therefore, within Boiling. The majority of dates is from southwestern Germany; the multilayered site of Petersfels has 35 dates (Jaguttis-Emden, 1983) and the two occupations at Felsstalle have seven radiocarbon dates (Jaguttis-Emden, 1987), which, like Petersfels, are mostly between 13,000 and 12,000 B.P. These two sites may bias the overall distribution.</page><page sequence="6">328 Weniger (n) CENTRAL GERMANY (n-13) 10 MIDDLE RHINE AREA (n-6) in NORTHERN 1U] SWITZERLAND (n-7) _I?I?I 1 1_ 20l 10 SOUTHERN GERMANY (n-58) 20-i ALL DATES WESTERN CENTRAL EUROPE (n-84) 10 H 19 4=b=?

Although Petersfels has more than seven stratified archaeological levels (Albrecht, 1979), the occupations all fall within about 1000 years and do not cover the whole time depth of the Central European Magdalenian. This is a general problem, that no sites are known with long sequences. Other rich sites, like Kesslerloch and Kniegrotte, which probably had several different phases of Magdalenian, were excavated many years ago. The two dates from Kniegrotte seem to suggest a longer sequence but it is no longer possible to establish the relationships among the radiocarbon dates, stratigraphy, and artifacts. At Hohler Fels Schelklingen, there were four distinct Magdalenian layers (Hahn, 1977). Four radiocarbon dates for two of the layers indicate a long sequence from 17,100 B.P. ? 150 years (H.5120-4569) in the lowest</page><page sequence="7">The Magdalenian In Western Central Europe 329 layer (Ha) to 12,770 B.P. ?110 years (H.5312-4907) in Layer lb, underlying Layer la, which yielded a biserial barbed bone point. Unfortunately, the area of excavation was very limited and the sequence may be disturbed (J. Hahn, personal communication), but the site does give some indication of the potential duration of Magdalenian occupation in Central Europe. Munzingen, in the upper Rhine Valley, supports an early Magdalenian settlement. The older excavations by Padtberg (1925) are dated to 15,870 B.P. ? 135 years (H.4156-3373), but limited work nearby in the 1970s yielded a date of 12,130 B.P. ?95 years (H.4738-4660). The faunas and lithic artifacts from the two excavations are different, so two occupations may be indicated (Albrecht, 1981). The archaic character of Padtberg's bone-antler industry (notably the polishers made on horse ribs, which resemble Gravettian types) support a date early in the Late Glacial (Berke, 1981). However, the main Magdalenian occupation was between 14,000 and 11,000 B.P., with a peak during Boiling. After Boiling, there was a gradual decline in the Magdalenian presence until its end at the boundary of Allerod and Younger Dryas. The radiocarbon chronology is partly supported by the stages that have been proposed for the mobile art (Bosinski, 1982). Spear throwers decorated with sculpted horses from Kesslerloch and Teufelsbriicke, contour decoupee from Kesslerloch and Oberkassel, and semicircular batons decorated with buckles from Kesslerloch and Freudenthal have parallels in the French Magdalenian IV, dating to the beginning of Boiling (Bosinski, 1982, p. 49). Venus figurines and engravings on stone slabs, as at Gonnersdorf, represent a younger stage and are comparable to French Magdalenian V (Bosinski, 1982, p. 60). A final stage of the Magdalenian is represented by schematic engravings of horses from Schweizersbild, Saaleck, and Groitzsch. An early phase is probably represented by the unique art objects from Kniegrotte (Bosinski, 1982, p. 51), which, together with the other archaic elements such as bone points (sagaies) with lateral grooves and triangles among the stone tools, might suggest French Magdalenian III. There are no observable differences in the radiocarbon record between regions (Fig. 2), although few dates are known from Switzerland, the middle Rhine, or even central Germany. The Magdalenian in Central Europe probably began before 15,000 B.P., as is indicated by the dates from southern Germany and also by the Polish cave of Maszycka, with two radiocarbon dates for the Magdalenian of 14,250 B.P. ?240 years (Ly-2453) and 15,490 B.P. ?310 years (Ly-2454) (Kozlowski, 1987). Thus, the once postulated hiatus in the human occupation of Central Europe during the Late Glacial maximum is slowly being filled (Weniger, 1989a). Although the radiocarbon record indicates quite a long Magdalenian occupation in western Central Europe and although the data from the different regions are uneven, we may assume that most sites fall within a</page><page sequence="8">330 Weniger narrow span of about 2000 years. This facilitates our comparison of sites and regions. ENVIRONMENT AND FAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES The retreat of the glaciers after the Late Glacial maximum seems to have been very rapid (Brunnacker, 1960; Frenzel, 1983). The climate ameliorated quickly, but the forest returned more slowly from its southern European refugia. This allowed the development of a rich herbaceous grassland (Weniger, 1982; Frenzel, 1983), which supported a large and diverse herbivore fauna, including very large forms such as mammoth, woolly rhino, and bison. Up to 10 species are recorded in the Magdalenian (Table I), a greater diversity than is known elsewhere in the midlatitudes. The richness of the herbivore biomass is further indicated by the presence of three carnivore species, cave lion, cave hyena, and wolf, which fed upon the same types of prey and were therefore highly competitive. During Boiling, archaic faunal elements such as mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, cave lion, and cave hyena slowly disappeared from Central Europe. In the second half of the Late Glacial, there seem to have been refugia in Eastern Europe, with its more continental climate and still open vegetation cover, so archaic species probably became locally extinct later in that region. The extinctions seem to have been a response to the recovery of the forest during Boiling, since mammoth had survived in the region during the Late Glacial maximum and is also documented during the early Late Glacial (Weniger, 1989a). Although the landscape was still open in Boiling, the advancing forest must have greatly increased competition for food between the large herbivores. Overall, reindeer and horse were the predominant species (Weniger, 1982, p. 121). In addition, there are also marked regional differences in faunal compo sitions (Table I). Muskox is represented only in the southwestern part of Central Europe, while saiga antelope occurs only in the middle Rhine Valley and central Germany. These two species perfectly reflect the assumed climatic and vegetational differences: the southwest had a more humid, tundralike character and the northeast was drier and more continental. The occurrence of mammoth in more than half of the central German sites supports this model. Another significant difference is the frequency of ibex, which is documented in most of the Swiss sites and one-third of the southwestern German sites (Table I) but is rare elsewhere. The alpine nature of the fauna in the southwest is further supported by the almost exclusive presence of chamois in this zone. Reindeer and horse are the two predominant species but there are also significant regional differences between their frequencies (Tables I and II).</page><page sequence="9">Table I.

In northern Switzerland and southwestern Germany, reindeer occurs in every site, while horse is less frequent; in southeastern and central Germany, horse is more frequently documented (Table I). These differences are even more pronounced when one considers the dominance of species within each assemblage (Table II). In northern Switzerland, reindeer is dominant in nine cases, ibex in one, and in one site the two are equal. (This pattern underlines the importance of ibex, after reindeer and horse.) Reindeer predominates in many assemblages in southwestern Germany, but some are dominated by horse and the majority show a balance between the two. In southeastern Germany, horse is the dominant species in three assemblages, reindeer in one, while the two are equal in two sites. In the middle Rhine, two assemblages are dominated by horse, one by reindeer, and one is balanced. Horse is predominant throughout central Germany. We should also take into account the size of the large herbivore assemblages. In northern Switzerland and southwestern Germany, large assemblages are always dominated by reindeer, but not so the small and medium-sized assemblages. There are no large faunal assemblages from south eastern Germany. The cave of Kleine Ofnet, which is difficult to interpret, had a small to medium assemblage dominated by horse; the small assemblages from Rennerfels and Steinbergwand are also dominated by horse, so we can assume that horse was of some importance in this region. The large assemblages from Gonnersdorf and Andernach in the middle Rhine indicate that horse was the most important prey at these sites, while, in marked contrast, the small to medium assemblages from the two sites in the Lahn valley are balanced or dominated by reindeer. In central Germany, all faunal assemblages, regardless of size, are dominated by horse. Thus, analysis of the large-herbivore assemblages</page><page sequence="11">The Magdalenian in Western Central Europe 333 Fig. 3. Regional differences in main prey species and distribution of site-types. Black animal, main prey; white animal, secondary prey; Large, medium, and small sites are indicated by circle sizes. indicates significant regional differences within western Central Europe (Fig. 3). Reindeer was the main prey in the southwest, while horse (and ibex in northern Switzerland) was second. The relationship between horse and reindeer is unclear in Bavaria because of the fragmentary nature of the data. In the middle Rhine, horse was the most important prey and reindeer second. In central Germany, horse was predominant overall. The composition of the faunal assemblages reveals a shift from reindeer to horse hunting from southwest to northeast, which is congruent with assumed climatic and environmental changes. Besides the two main animals, many other species were also hunted, although in much smaller numbers. Bovids were quite important in the Swiss</page><page sequence="12">334 Weniger sites and red deer was important in some areas. However, these species were essentially supplementary and hunting in the Magdalenian was obviously specialized. White hare and ptarmigan are common in some faunal assemblages. White hare is abundant in the large assemblages from Teufelsbriicke, Oelknitz, Kesslerloch, and Petersfels, and both species are numerous in the small to medium assemblages from sites such as Buttenloch, Hollenberghohle, 3, Teufelskiichen, and Brillenhohle. There is no identifiable relationship between assemblage size and the frequencies of these two species, but their presence in sites of all regions demonstrates that they were regular elements of the diet. Another interesting aspect of some faunal assemblages is the presence of dogs or domesticated wolves. They are documented in the central German sites of Kniegrotte, Teufelsbriicke, and Oelknitz (Musil, 1984, 1985) and at Oberkassel (Nobis, 1979) and Andernach (Bosinski and Hahn, 1973, p. 178) in the middle Rhine, demonstrating that animal domestication started in Central Europe in the Magdalenian. The presence of dogs in horse-dominated sites in central Germany has been interpreted by Musil as an indication that they were used in specialized horse hunting (Musil, 1985, p. 10). The two sites from the middle Rhine, where horse, again, was the most important prey, support this idea. LITHIC ARTIFACT ASSEMBLAGES Lithics are by far the most abundant artifacts (more than bone or antler objects) and several scholars have studied them within the last three decades, trying to identify internal structure; their results are somewhat contradictory. Schwabedissen (1954) proposed a division of the Magdalenian into three groups which he called Dobritz, Probstfels, and Thaynger. The first includes mainly central German sites and is characterized by a predominance of backed bladelets, often retouched at both ends or around the entire circumfer ence; perforators and burins with an elongated truncation (Lacan type) are also typical. The Probstfels group includes sites from the middle Rhine and southern Germany. The assemblages are characterized by high frequencies of backed bladelets, which are rarely retouched at the ends and never completely; perforators are very rare but backed points are common. The Thaynger group includes sites from southern Germany and northern Switzerland and may represent a mixture of the two other groups. Narr (1963, 1968) basically followed this classification, calling the Dobritz group the perforator-bladelet group. The Thaynger group supposedly included sites with shouldered points and backed angled points and the Probstfels group was kept as the third unit. The origin of these groups was</page><page sequence="13">The Magdalenian in Western Central Europe 335 thought to lie somewhere in France and several hypothetical migration routes were reconstructed. Hanitzsch tried to develop a structure for the central German sites. He identified special tool types that he considered to be significant within the assemblage, of which the key types are burins with elongated truncations, various types of perforators, backed bladelets, and backed points. Their frequencies within assemblages were used to distinguish several groups within the central German material (Hanitzsch, 1969, p. 187). Feustel proposed to place sites from central Germany and Switzerland in the "Oelknitzer" group, which he divided into several variants on the basis of a few key types (Feustel, 1974, Fig. 84). As the authors admit, none of these essays has given a clear image of the structure of the Central European Magdalenian (Narr, 1963, p. 97; Feustel, 1974, Fig. 83). Most of the proposed key types occur only in very small numbers: some times a single example is used to classify a site, to the neglect of other features. Furthermore, the groups overlap widely and many groups consist of very few sites?sometimes even only one or two. Their significance is therefore dubious, especially in light of the sometimes considerable geographic sepa ration between the sites within a group, as noted by Narr (1968, p. 219). Narr was the first to suggest that seasonal movements and different seasonal activities might be responsible for some of the variation (Narr, 1968, p. 222). Although the system of key types does not work well within the Central European Magdalenian, some types are considered to be significant by many authors (Hanitzsch, 1969, 1972; Bosinski and Hahn, 1973; Feustel, 1974; Franken and Veil, 1983; Terberger, 1986). These types are burins with elongated truncation (Lacan type), backed bladelets with truncation or retouched on both edges, several types of perforators (some made on burin spalls), and various types of backed points. Higher frequencies of backed points and the presence of completely retouched bladelets seem to charac terize a late phase. Variation in burin types may also be a chronological indicator: burins with truncation were probably gradually replaced by dihedral burins (Weniger, 1982; Kind, 1987). However, these vague chronological markers cannot separate different regional groups. The composition of the lithic tool assemblages may be influenced by at least three main factors: difference in time, interregional difference in space, and intraregional difference in space in terms of activity-specific sites. Other factors are raw material quality and availability and excavation techniques. There are obvious and observable differences in the frequencies of tool classes between sites: some are dominated by backed bladelets, some by burins or perforators, and some by endscrapers. Table III lists the three most common tool classes within each assemblage in order of frequency. Only five tool classes are represented: backed bladelets, burins, endscrapers, perforators,</page><page sequence="14">Table III.

Overall, backed bladelets and burins are the most important tools; they are usually the two most common classes within an assemblage. Endscrapers are usually one of the three most common classes, and perforators are next in frequency, while the truncated pieces reveal a regional pattern. The relationship between backed bladelets and burins is clouded by differences in excavation techniques. Backed bladelets are the smallest class and are therefore poorly represented in the older excavations, as is clearly shown at Petersfels (Albrecht, 1979); in general, their frequency is directly proportional to the precision of the excavation (Kind, 1987). In addition, there is a difference between cave sites and open-air sites, since artifacts are much more difficult to recover from coarse cave sediments than from the fine-grained sediments of open-air sites. Backed bladelets are, therefore, better represented in old excavations of open-air sites than of cave sites (Kind, 1987, p. 150). However, recent excavations at open-air sites like Andernach, Alsdorf, Nebra, Groitzsch Cl Ost, and Bad Frankenhausen have shown that a lithic assemblage is not necessarily biased simply because backed bladelets are not the dominant tool class. Nevertheless, it is apparent that collections from old excavations of caves are biased when backed bladelets are not one of the three main tool classes; I have therefore placed them within the top three classes in all such collections (primarily sites from northern Switzerland and southwestern Germany) and omitted the class that was previously third. This reveals the following pattern: in 43% of all the sites under consideration, backed bladelets, burins, and endscrapers are the three most common classes; this pattern occurs in 60% or more of the sites in Switzerland and southeastern and central Germany but is rare in sites in southwestern Germany and the middle Rhine area. In about a third of all sites, endscrapers are replaced by perforators, but this varies by region. It occurs in three of the five sites in the middle Rhine but only one of the five Bavarian sites. Elsewhere, the perforator-variant accounts for 26-35% of the sites. Alternatively, endscrapers may be replaced by truncated blades: this occurs in over half of the southwestern German sites but in only one site elsewhere (Alsdorf in the middle Rhine). The basic tool structure and the perforator variant describe the essential composition of most assemblages; the only strong regional feature is the truncated blades of southwestern Germany. It also appears that smaller assemblages show more variety than do the larger ones. Such a comparison, on the basis of only the three most frequent tool classes, greatly simplifies the assemblage composition, but a very broad approach is necessary in order to cover such a heterogeneous data base. A comparison of the data in Table III from open-air sites and cave sites or rockshelters shows that the differences</page><page sequence="22">344 Weniger in assemblage composition do not result from this topographic distinction between sites. Regional variations obviously exist but interpretation is very difficult. It is not sufficient merely to compare type lists, but rather we must investigate an entire range of external and internal factors, such as the representativeness of the samples, site-types, activities, chronology, and regionally. Only against such a background will the patterning of tool assemblages be recognizable. The rough comparison made here shows only that truncated blades had a special significance in southwestern Germany; the relationship between the basic tool structure and the perforator-variant as well as the variation bet ween regions cannot be explained, except by the more complex analysis proposed above. SITE-TYPES AND SETTLEMENT PATTERN One of the most obvious differences between sites is the number of stone artifacts. A classification of sites by assemblage size was first proposed by Lohr (1979), revised and expanded by Weniger (1982, 1987), and seems to reflect a general pattern within the European Upper Paleolithic (Kind, 1985). In order to define the assemblage types, I propose to use a system of letters from Aa to Ee, the uppercase letter indicating the number of cores and the lowercase letter the number of tools, as follows. A: 1-20 cores a: 1-50 tools B: 21- 50 cores b: 51-100 tools C: 51-100 cores c: 101-200 tools D: 101-200 cores d: 201-500 tools E: &gt; 200 cores e: &gt; 500 tools (Fig. 4) Each archaeological unit separated and described by the excavator is treated as one assemblage. This characterization becomes less valid the earlier the excavation, and even in the best documented excavations, there remain uncertainties about the processes of site formation. Another major problem is the correlation of an archaeological layer or assemblage with a paleoethnographic event. These factors mean that each site must be considered individually to determine how many archaeological units could be identified, how meaningful they are, and if excavation was only partial, whether the parts excavated are likely to be representative. The largest assemblages (Ee) usually yield at least several hundred tools and sometimes more than 200 cores (Table HI, Fig. 4). The disproportionate numbers of cores at Felsstalle and Groitzsch Dl/B Nord seem to result from their locations next to raw material sources.

Kniegrotte, and Nebra are different in having hundreds of tools but relatively few cores. However, Oelnitz and Nebra are not fully published, Kahla Lobschutz is known primarily from surface collections, and the paucity of cores at Kniegrotte may reflect the excavation techniques or, more likely, the fact that most raw material came from a source more than 60 km away (Weniger, 1989b). The Dd and Ed sites have smaller assemblages and might represent single large occupations, while Ee sites would represent repeated large occupations. Among the medium-sized assemblages (mainly Cd and Bd sites), the rarity of cores at Andernach probably again reflects a special raw material</page><page sequence="24">346 Weniger procurement strategy (Weniger, 1989b); most raw material was brought in as large blades or finished tools (Floss and Terberger, 1987). In addition, the original excavation was in the last century, so we may assume that the assemblage is incomplete and, therefore, reasonably place Andernach in the large-site category. Of the somewhat smaller medium-sized assemblages (Bb and Cc sites), Kaufertsberg, Birseck-Ennitage, and Brugglihohle are old excavations, as are Heidenstein and Hohlestein-Stadel, which I prefer to consider Bb, although it had only 19 cores. However, sites like Barbing and Groitzsch A1/A2 Nord are modern excavations and do support the existence of smaller medium-sized sites. The group of small sites (Aa and Ab) is tightly clustered and well separated from the other sites (Fig. 4). Some sites had no cores and form a separate variant. The differences between small and large sites are well defined and clearly visible. The medium-sized sites are less homogeneous and more difficult to interpret because of their subdivision into the smaller and larger variants. The classification of site-types is complicated by external factors, such as different excavation techniques or states of preservation, and by internal factors of prehistoric human behavior. Some of the latter, such as raw material procurement, may be detectable, while many other facets of human behavior are archaeologically invisible. We need to consider other quanti tative and qualitative features of sites in order to decide how meaningful is their separation by assemblage size. Differences in assemblage size usually correlate with the size of habi tation areas. Large sites cover &gt; 100-200 m2, small sites cover &lt; 30 m2 (and existed even in the absence of physical limitations, even in caves), and medium-sized sites fall in between. Similar differences in living areas have also been observed elsewhere in Europe (White, 1985). The lithic assemblage size usually reflects the faunal assemblage size. The large-herbivore faunas have been grouped by frequency, as shown in Table III. Class 1: 1-10 MNI (minimum number of individuals) Class 2: 11-20 MNI Class 3: 21-50 MNI Class 4: &gt; 50 MNI Some open-air sites, like Schussenquelle and Oelknitz, yielded &gt; 500 or &gt; 150 MNI of large herbivores, but smaller assemblages of &lt;20 MNI are also reported, as from Felsstalle, Nebra, or Bad Frankenhausen, and probably result from poor preservation: faunal assemblages from caves tend to be larger than those from open-air sites. Only the results of the 1968 excavation of Gonnersdorf are available, so the fauna is &lt; 50 MNI.</page><page sequence="25">Hie Magdalenian in Western Central Europe 347 Differences in preservation complicate the classification, but almost all the large sites are in classes 3-4, small sites usually have &lt; 10 MNI (class 1), medium sites are in between. The bone-antler industry follows the trend of site-types in terms of organic preservation. In most small sites, few or no finds are reported (Table III), medium sites yield &lt; 10 finds, and large sites yield between 10 and several hundred finds. These quantitative differences thus support the classification of site types. One could argue that they are merely a product of the frequency of reoccupation, and indeed, most of the largest sites have been reoccupied several times. Nevertheless, each archaeological layer of the large sites produced an assemblage at least five times larger than those from the small sites, and there are also some qualitative differences between site-types. For example, mobile art [statuettes or figurative engravings on bone, antler, jet, or stone slabs (Figs. 5-7)] and personal ornaments (pendants of jet, teeth, and fossil mollusks) occur only in the large sites and a few medium sites. Further, within some regions, there are differences in faunal composition between site-types, in addition to the general differences between regions noted above. In the southern part of western Central Europe, large sites are dominated by reindeer, while many medium and small sites show a preference for horse or sometimes ibex or, at least, a balance between these two species and reindeer. Further to the north, in the middle Rhine area and central Germany, horse is dominant in the large sites; reindeer is more important in medium to small sites in the middle Rhine, as can be seen in the Lahn valley, while in central Germany these site-types also are dominated by horse. Therefore the classification of site-types is supported in three regions by the faunal composition of the sites. Another important qualitative difference is in the presence of habitation structures. Stone pavements, slab-lined hearths, and similar features are recorded only from large and some medium sites; small and medium sites usually have only simple hearths without stone circles. In some cases, the material for the slab linings or the pavements at the large sites came from sources some kilometers distant. The basic tool structure of backed bladelets, burins, and endscrapers (see above) occurs in the large and medium sites, while the small sites reveal other variants. As can be observed in southwestern Germany, the percentage of tools relative to the entire lithic inventory is much higher at small sites than at large and medium sites (Weniger, 1982, p. 169). The lithic inventories thus confirm differences of occupation or activity between site-types. Other differences appear in the seasonality of the fauna. In southwestern Germany and northern Switzerland, large sites are assigned to autumn winter and medium to small sites to spring-summer (Weniger, 1982, p. 182).</page><page sequence="26">348 Weniger 1 2 3 4 5 6 10 12 13 Fig. 5.

Similarly, at Peterfels occupation was primarily in autumn or winter and secondarily in spring or summer (Albrecht et al., 1983). There is no faunal evidence for seasonality in central Germany, but the presence of habitation structures at Nebra, Oelknitz, and Bad Frankenhausen, which are nearly identical to those from Gonnersdorf and Andernach, suggests a similar seasonal pattern?that is, the large sites were probably occupied mainly during autumn-winter. Various quantitative and qualitative features thus confirm the classifi cation of sites by size, and I suggest that human behavior was responsible for this pattern. I have shown elsewhere (Weniger, 1982, 1987) that ethnohistoric data on the hunter-gatherers of subarctic and arctic North America provide a useful background for the interpretation of some aspects of Magdalenian behavior in Central Europe; this is partly because of similarities in environment. Caribou and fish were the main food resources in the American arctic and subarctic (Gillespie, 1981, p. 15), economies were based upon fishing, big game hunting, or a mixture of the two (Murdoch, 1967; Hosley, 1981; McClellan and Denniston, 1981; Weniger, 1982). Two critical aspects of hunter-gatherer behavior are mobility and fluctuating group size, both of which are linked to economic strategy. The most important social unit was the local group, which was composed of one or two extended families and varied in size from 15 to 75 people (Hosley, 1981; Steward, 1969). When food was scarce, the local group might split up into household units. Units larger than the local group?the maximum band or aggregate group?came together when resources were plentiful: those based on a fishing economy would gather in summer during the salmon runs or at good fishing spots in lakes; hunters would assemble primarily in autumn along the caribou migration routes. These gatherings served several purposes. Communal labor permitted the construction of fishweirs or caribou fences, making exploitation much more efficient. The geographical and temporal clumping of resources makes this type of resource management essential for survival in higher latitudes, where surpluses must be stored in late summer or autumn in order to survive the winter. In ethnohistory, the spring caribou hunt therefore seems to have been less important than the autumn hunt, since resources were more plentiful in summer (Osgood, 1936, p. 36; Hoffmann, 1976, p. 70; Binford, 1978, p. 205). Social activities were equally important reasons for assembling people. Ceremonies are essential parts of subsistence strategy (Jochim, 1976, p. 19) and are vital for the survival of small, dispersed populations. These also took place during the seasons of greatest food supply and, with them, exchange of information and goods.</page><page sequence="30">352 Weniger It is interesting to note that the habitation structures reflect the seasonally different climates. Light summer shelters, covered with bark, or skin-covered tepees can be distinguished from the heavier winter shelters, such as dome shaped houses covered with skins or even semisubterranean houses. These ethnohistoric data shed some light upon the Magdalenian. The large Magdalenian sites, with their high percentages of cores and tools, rich bone-antler industry, labor-intensive habitation structures, huge faunal assemblages, and large occupation areas, indicate a more intensive occupation (longer duration, or more people, or both) than at the medium and small sites. They seem to have been mainly autumn or winter camps. In the southern regions, hunting at this season focused on reindeer and the site locations are congruent with reconstructed reindeer migration routes (Weniger, 1982,1987). I therefore propose that they were aggregation centers, where the year's main hunting occurred, focusing on reindeer or horse at the beginning of the cold season. The large numbers of bone points (sagaies) indicate that hunting was an important activity, and the numbers of sewing needles evidence the working of hides and furs for clothing or shelter. The large number of animals killed presupposes communal hunting by more than one band. In the middle Rhine, such hunts took place at sites like Gonnersdorf, Andernach, and probably Alsdorf; here, as at the large sites in central Germany, horse was the main prey. The communal hunts permitted the storage of some surplus and were essential for survival over the winter. These sites were, in fact, probably occupied throughout the entire winter. The small sites seem to reflect short-term field camps occupied by local bands, or only part of a band, and, in the southwest, are related to horse or ibex hunting, although some reindeer were taken. Bone-antler tools are rare, habitation structures, when present, are simple unlined hearths, and the presence of fire is often recorded only by burned artifacts. The extremely small sites without cores indicate a very minor occupation, in which no cores became exhausted or were discarded or which involved a very special activity not requiring tool production. In southwestern Germany, small sites were probably occupied in spring or summer. We can therefore hypothesize a division between reindeer hunting from aggregation sites during autumn and winter and more horse hunting by local bands, or even smaller units, during summer (Weniger, 1982,1987). We might interpret similarly the small sites in northern Switzerland where horse and especially ibex were important; the seasonality of Hollenberg-Hohle 3 (Sedlmeier, 1982) supports this. Small hunting camps focused on ibex are also documented at higher altitudes in southwestern Europe (Straus, 1986). The two small-medium sites in the middle Rhine are probably related to reindeer hunting. We have no seasonal indicators for them but can assume that they were summer sites for groups that spent autumn-winter in Rhine valley</page><page sequence="31">The Magdalenian in Western Central Europe 353 at aggregation sites like Gonnersdorf or Andernach; this would be a reverse of the southwestern situation. The lithic assemblages from the Lahn valley are quite different from those of Gonnersdorf and Andernach and so a relation ship between them has been rejected (Terberger, 1986), but this does not contradict our own hypothesis. The differences between lithic inventories could result from differences in age, as well as from different activity patterns between large and small-medium sites. Raw material procurement clearly indicates a relationship with the lowlands of the Rhine valley (see below). Our hypothesis is also supported by the topographical separation of large and small sites visible in other regions. In the southwest, large sites are always outside the mountain area in large valleys or basin landscapes (Fig. 3), while small sites (spring-summer) are usually within mountains. The small and large sites of the middle Rhine seem to follow the same trend. In central Germany, there is no topographical separation between large and small sites and the main prey is always horse. The situation in southeastern Germany is unclear: some small sites are beyond the mountain zone while others are within it, and no large sites have been identified. Medium sites in northern Switzerland and southern Germany are domi nated by reindeer, or have a balance of reindeer and ibex (Rislisberghohle), or have a balance of reindeer and horse. The last is also true for Bavaria, while the medium sites in central Germany are horse-dominated. Medium sized sites are richer than small sites. Bone tools are frequently present, there is sometimes mobile art and personal ornaments, and structures are frequent. In southern Germany, where they occur in both the uplands and the low lands, the evidence indicates spring-summer occupation (Weniger, 1982, 1987). I suggest that they were base camps for local groups. In the lowlands of southwestern Germany, they are related to the migration routes of reindeer and seem to represent spring reindeer hunting. However, the spring hunt was evidently of minor importance and does not reflect the same type of aggre gation as in autumn-winter. In the uplands of southern Germany and northern Switzerland, horse or ibex was more important. The Bavarian sites are in the Nordlinger basin and the Altmuhl valley and there is no apparent topographical separation. Medium sites from central Germany are always in the lowlands and are horse-dominated. Some of the large sites, such as Petersfels, Munzingen, or Gonnersdorf, also document a spring hunt, but the sparse evidence for it echoes the image given by the medium sites. It seems established that medium-sized occupations may be concealed within some large sites, as obviously small occupations may also be. An example of such can probably be seen at Felsstalle (Kind, 1987, p. 66). The site-types shed some light upon Magdalenian settlement patterns in western Central Europe. The very broad separation into large, medium, and small sites seems to reflect the dividing and fusing of groups of hunters during</page><page sequence="32">354 Weniger their annual round. However, if the large sites were indeed aggregation sites, as suggested by our model, they were only small aggregation sites and are not comparable to ethnohistoric examples, such as those of the Chipewyan, where 200-400 people might assemble (Smith, 1975). Nevertheless, the large Magdalenian sites were qualitatively different from the other site-types. Although the basic pattern is the same throughout the area, there are some regional differences. Magdalenian hunters in northern Switzerland and south western Germany moved from large, lowland, autumn-winter aggregation sites, where they concentrated on reindeer hunting, to smaller, dispersed, upland settlements during summer, when horse was of importance. In Switzerland, ibex also was important. Interpretation is difficult in the middle Rhine because few sites are reported, but the winter-summer pattern may be the reverse: there are obvious large, autumn-winter aggregation sites in the lowlands of the Rhine valley, from which horse was hunted, and smaller, upland sites where reindeer was more important. The lack of seasonality data from the sites in the Lahn valley precludes a firm conclusion, but bones of fetal reindeer from Wildscheuer and high numbers of very young herbivores at Wildweiberlei (Terberger, 1986) support occupation during the spring or summer. There are no topographical differences between winter and summer hunting areas in central Germany: all the sites lie in the restricted zone between the mountains of the Thuringian forest and the lowlands of the Elbe valley and have faunal assemblages dominated by horse. There are no large sites in southeastern Germany and the medium and small sites do not show any patterning. Our model of settlement pattern contrasts sharply with the ideas of Sturdy (1975). He postulated a long-distance migration of reindeer from the southern limestone zone to the northwestern European plains and suggested that Late Glacial hunters practiced a herd-following economy. Reindeer migrations depend upon topography and environment. Extant European populations migrate over short distances of 150-200 km (Gaare and Skoglund, 1975; Spiess, 1979), but in North America they can undertake long-distance migrations of 1000 km or more (Banfield, 1974). The highly differentiated topography of Central Europe makes Sturdy's proposed migrations of &gt; 500 km unlikely. Further, his routes cross well-defined boundaries in artifact typology, do not coincide with site-types of seasonal occupations, and contra dict the ethnohistorical record of subrecent caribou hunters (Burch, 1972, p. 346; Smith, 1975). Also, his model cannot satisfactorily accommodate the horse-dominated sites. Instead, careful examination of the archaeological data permits us to reconstruct another type of settlement pattern and subsistence strategy. Each of the three main site-types can be further subdivided. The large sites include a set of frequently reoccupied sites and a second set of sites that were probably occupied only once. The medium sites include larger and smaller</page><page sequence="33">The Magdalenian in Western Central Europe 355 variants, as do also the small sites (the subtype of extremely small sites without cores). Other site-types may be revealed by other features, such as the stone and bone-antler tool-kits and the relationship to their debitage, artifact distributions within a site, frequency of bone types by species, and taphonomic studies. At some sites, there are indications of special activities. Hollenberg Hohle 3 (Sedlmeier, 1982), which is a small site (Ab-1), produced a large quantity of jet?some of it unmodified and some made into pendants; more than 30 mollusks; 70 pieces of red ocher; several sandstone slabs for processing ocher; and 11 reindeer antlers. Other faunal remains include at least five reindeer, represented mainly by metapodials, but the dominant species are ptarmigan and hare, each represented by at least 20 individuals. There were no signs of a hearth or even burned artifacts. Only one core is reported and the tools make up an extraordinary value of almost 40% of the lithic inventory. The site has been seen as a special hide-working area, or as a "cache." The small site of Gnirshohle I (Aa-1), which lies inside a small cave system beyond the daylight zone (Albrecht et al, 1977), produced one core and a few stone tools (&gt; 33% of the assemblage), seven sewing needles, some mollusks, several pieces of jet, and some stone slabs which are probably the remains of a hearth. Although slightly disturbed by a badger's burrow, the assemblage probably is complete and represents a special activity. At the small site of Barenkeller/Konigsee-Garsitz in central Germany (Feustel et al.9 1971; Feustel and Musil, 1977), no cores are reported, the percentage of tools reaches 58%, and there were more than 20 bone-antler tools and traces of a simple hearth. The outstanding object is an unusual Venus figurine of ivory (Fig. 5: 10). The excavators interpret the site as a ritual place (Feustel et ai9 1971), and its atypical composition is obvious. These examples indicate the variety of assemblage composition found within one site-type. In general, small sites are more varied than are other types, as is also shown by the composition of the tool-kits, which rarely follow the basic structure (see above). Small sites are our best opportunity to observe special, isolated events, which are usually not detectable in the Paleolithic record. However, precise excavation techniques can sometimes permit the recognition of individual events in large sites as well. Recent examples are Andernach (Veil, 1984; Floss and (Terberger, 1987) and Felsstalle (Kind, 1987). MOBILE ART As noted above, mobile art has some chronological significance and occurs in each subregion, but usually only at the large sites. This suggests</page><page sequence="34">Table IV.

The social aspect of mobile art makes it a useful instrument for the identification of different groups or traditions. Abstract decorations are known primarily from the bone-antler industry (Svoboda, 1976) but have never been studied systematically, so our study is confined to figurative examples. These can be divided into anthropomorphic [mostly Venus figurines or engravings (Figs. 5 and 6)] and zoomorphic representations. More than 500 female representations are known (Table IV), and &gt;200 animal representations. The mobile art from western Central Europe is dominated by the extraordinarily rich collection from Gonnersdorf, with &gt;400 female representations and &gt; 150 zoomorphic engravings (Tables IV and V), so that analysis of it must be double: both including and excluding the Gonnersdorf material. Among the female depictions, &gt; 400 are engravings and only 45 are Venus figurines, although they are generally more varied than the engravings (Table IV); if we exclude Gonnersdorf, figurines are more frequent than engravings. Both forms are documented in all regions, except Bavaria, which lacks figurines. In northern Switzerland, only Moosbuhl has yielded a small possible Venus figurine (Fig. 5: 11). It is very abstract and therefore difficult to interpret, but it has some parallels to a smaller example from Petersfels (Fig. 5: 9) and both are made on jet. Similarly, Petersfels is the only site in southwestern Germany with Venus figurines, although recent excavations at Hohler Fels Schelklingen produced a still-unpublished fragment of jet which might be the back of a Venus (J. Hahn, personal communication). Two sites in the middle Rhine and three in central Germany have yielded figurines. Venuses occur on four different raw materials?ivory, antler, stone, and jet (Table TV)?of which ivory and jet are the most important. Jet was used only in southwestern Germany and northern Switzerland, while ivory was used only in the middle Rhine and central Germany. Ivory figurines are very much alike [except the peculiar example from Barenkeller (Fig. 5:10)] and are distinct from those on jet (Fig. 5). The close connection between the middle Rhine and the central German sites is also shown by the stone figurines reported from Gonnersdorf (Fig. 5: 12) and Oelknitz (Fig. 5: 13). Venus figurines on jet also differ from those on ivory in the presence of distal perforations or notches, which indicates their use as pendants (Fig. 5: 7-9). These are located at the end of the upper body, so that the figurines would hang in an upright position. A fragment of a possibly perforated Venus figurine has been reported from an area of Gonnersdorf excavated after 1968 (Bosinski, 1982, PI. 56: 5), but the presumed perforation is at the center of the statuette, just on the break; this perforation is unique and may be accidental. It is possible that the figurines without perforations</page><page sequence="37">The Magdalenian in Western Central Europe 359 or notches were also used as pendants, for example, by suspending them in leather covers as occurs in subarctic Indian contexts. Nevertheless, at least there were regionally different methods of suspending them. Some unique figurine forms occur at sites like Petersfels (Bosinski, 1982, PL 33: 1, PL 34: 1, 2) or Andernach (Bosinski, 1982, PL 92), but on the whole the figurines are probably a Central and Eastern European tradition and may reflect much older Gravettian origins (Bosinski, 1982). Engravings of Venuses are regionally much more homogeneous. Although not common, except at Gonnersdorf, they are evenly distributed over the whole area (Table IV). They are usually on stone slabs, but Petersfels produced some very small and barely recognizable examples on a piece of bone (Fig. 6: 4) and Kniegrotte produced a very distinctive and peculiar example engraved on antler (Fig. 6: 20). Another unique female sign within Central European is the vulva engraved into a stone block from Oelknitz (Bosinski, 1982, PL 74). Most of the representations are very stylized and only the upper body and legs are engraved (Fig. 6). The Gonnersdorf collection covers the entire range of variation (Bosinski and Fischer, 1974): some figures have a more elaborate upper body, often with arms (Fig. 6:1-2), and some plaquettes even show complete scenes (Fig. 6: 3), which are inter preted as dancing (Bosinski and Fischer, 1974). While the Venus figurines reveal regional differences, the engravings are alike in form and raw material, and they were a basic feature common to all groups in western Central Europe. Zoomorphic representations are reported from 16 sites (Table V). There are only 15 sculptures in the round, including eight spearthrowers sculpted as horses from Kesslerloch and Teufelsbriicke, a bird from Andernach, two contours decoupees from Kesslerloch and Oberkassel, a baton with a head of an animal from Oberkassel, and three insects made of jet from Petersfels, Kesslerloch, and Kleine Scheuer Rosenstein (Bosinski, 1982). Engravings are more numerous and the most important collection is of &gt; 150 specimens on schist slabs from Gonnersdorf. Except at Gonnersdorf, antler was the preferred raw material, followed by stone slabs and bone; ivory, jet, and pebbles were of minor importance (Table V). Overall, horse was most frequently drawn (57%), then mammoth (30%) and woolly rhino (3%). If we exclude the Gonnersdorf collection, horse is even more predomi nant (72%), followed by reindeer (9%) and mammoth (4%). (These figures do not include the recently excavated and still unstudied material from Andernach.) If we count species by site, horse is represented at 12 sites, mammoth, woolly rhino, and reindeer at 3, and ibex and birds at 2 each. The engraving of a large herbivore from Petersfels is difficult to identify (Bosinski, 1982, p. 34); Mauser thought it a bovid, but his drawing (1970, PL 89) more resembles an ibex. Other species are represented only by single</page><page sequence="38">360 Weniger examples. Some regional variation may exist in the drawings of mammoth and woolly rhino: they are reported from two sites in central Germany, from the middle Rhine valley, and from Bavaria, but they are absent from the southwestern zone (Table V). Bosinski and Fischer (1980) have proposed a chronological scheme based on stylistic features. Their oldest phase is represented by the horse engraved on a perforated baton from Kesslerloch (Fig. 7:1), which they see as a static, stylized representation. Examples of a later phase are seen as naturalistic and spontaneous (Fig. 7: 2-6, 9, 11) and are regarded as typical of the "photographic style." Examples of their final phase are also shown in Figure 7 (Fig. 7: 8, 10, 12-14). The horse from Kesslerloch is very unusual. The same kind of interior hatching also occurs on the "grazing reindeer" from the same site (Bosinski, 1982, PI. 8) and on a reindeer from Petersfels (Bosinski, 1982, PI.24). Other horses with interior hatching are known from the Moravian site of Pekarna (Bosinski and Fischer, 1980, PI. 104). Kesslerloch and Pekarna, but not Petersfels, are thought to include an early Magdalenian phase. Unfortunately, the stratigraphies of the sites are not well controlled, so that material from different phases may be mixed. However, it remains possible that this type of interior hatching, which does not represent hair but is an attempt to give more plasticity to the body, does reflect an earlier phase of mobile art of the region. Some aspects of the mobile art thus reflect the homogeneity of the region, and others regional differences. The latter are differences in raw material, motifs, style, and, perhaps, function. RAW MATERIAL PROCUREMENT Lithic raw material was usually obtained from within 20 km of a site (Weniger, 1989b), but most sites also have a small quantity of nonlocal material. In southwestern Germany, sites in the eastern part of the Swabian Alb show connections both with southern Bavaria (Fig. 8) and with the upper Rhine valley. Cretaceous flint from the Aachen-Maas area or the northern end-moraines is an important part of the lithic industries in the middle Rhine area (Fig. 8), where it occurs in various amounts at all sites. At Gonnersdorf and Andernach, it was used in great quantity, and obtaining it from &gt; 100 km away involved a strategy which is reflected in the low number of cores at these sites (Weniger, 1989b). The two Lahntal sites reveal a pattern that is clearly directed to the Rhine valley and, beyond, to the same sources as were exploited from Gonnersdorf and Andernach. There are few data on raw material procurement in central Germany. Kniegrotte and Teufelsbriicke obtained most of their raw material, a Cretaceous flint, from end-moraines</page><page sequence="39">The Magdalenian in Western Central Europe 361 Fig. 8. Regional and supraregional connections indicated by raw materials. Solid lines, material for flaked stone; dashed lines, mollusks and jet. lying &gt; 60 km to the northeast and may have had a procurement strategy similar to that of the middle Rhine area. A quartzite from Kniegrotte and Groitzsch probably comes from the Becov region, more than 100 km away. Other materials, such as jet, fossil or marine mollusks, and amber, also show intra- and interregional connections (Fig. 8). The Mainz Basin was a very common source of fossil mollusks in western Central Europe and mollusks from it occur in many sites in northern Switzerland, southwestern and southeastern Germany, and central Germany, making it a supraregional center. Fossils from the Steinheim Basin occur in the eastern and western parts of the Swabian Alb in southwestern Germany. Mollusks from the northern Swiss site of Kohlerhdhle probably come from the upper Danube</page><page sequence="40">362 Weniger area (Sedlmeier, 1988), so the Swiss Jura also was connected with the Swabian zone. Jet indicates further relationships between Swiss and Swabian sites: the jet from Mossbuhl in the Swiss Mittelland (Schwab, 1985) and from Hollenberghohle 3 in the Swiss Jura (Sedlmeier, 1982) probably comes from the Swabian Alb. Jet also shows a connection between central Germany and the Swabian Alb. These raw materials can be seen as evidence of a net of exchange and communication within western Central Europe. Other fossils relate to sources outside the area under study (Fig. 8). Some southwestern German and Swiss sites yielded mollusks from the Paris Basin (Sedlmeier, 1988; Weniger, 1989b). Other mollusks in southwestern Germany come from the Atlantic coast and even the Mediterranean coast. Medditerranean mollusks also occur in sites of the middle Rhine, southern Germany, and northern Switzerland. These examples indicate an orientation toward western and southern sources, while the small pieces of amber from Mossbuhl (Schwab, 1985) indicate connections with the northwestern European Plain. In the latter zone, amber was usually exchanged in an east-west direction between Hamburgian sites from Poland to England (Burdukiewicz, 1987). CONCLUSIONS The data presented above do not include all aspects of the archaeological record but still reveal a complex picture of Magdalenian settlement in western Central Europe. The geographical clustering of sites may be influenced by nonprehistoric factors but does provide a common background against which regional features can be observed (Table VI). The composition of the large-herbivore faunas reflects environmental differences. Muskox and saiga antelope indicate climatic and vegetational differences between the more humid or alpine southwest and the drier and more steppic northeast during the Late Glacial. This is supported by the probable longer survival of mammoth and woolly rhino in the eastern part of western Central Europe. The relative importance of ibex in the southwest is also environmentally significant. The main prey species also differ among the five regions and reflect these environmental differences. In the southwest, reindeer was the most important prey, followed by horse (or, in northern Switzerland, probably by ibex). In the northeast, horse was predominant and reindeer second. Reindeer may have been less important in central Germany than in the middle Rhine; not enough is known about the Bavarian sites. The lithic assemblages are much more homogeneous. Backed bladelets, burins, and endscrapers are the three most frequent classes in most sites</page><page sequence="41">Tabk VL The Regions and Their Typical Features Important features Northern Switzerland Southwest Germany Southeast Germany Middle Rhine area Central Germany Large herbivores with ecological significance Main prey species in order of their importance Domesticated animals Lithic industries Settlement pattern Summer area/main prey Winter area/main prey Mobile art Main raw material Venus figurines Main raw material Venus engravings Most frequent represented species Other zoomorphic representations with regional importance Muskox Reindeer Horse Ibex Basic theme Uplands/horse, ibex, reindeer Lowlands/reindeer Jet?

A variant of the basic structure, in which perforators replace endscrapers, is found in a third of the sites and is the second most important type of tool composition in the region. A regionally significant feature is the high frequency of truncated blades in southwestern Germany, especially in small sites. Other regional differences are^ shown by our models of the settlement patterns. The three models are based upon fragmentary data and therefore reflect general tendencies within the geographical clusters. In northern Switzerland and southwestern Germany, large autumn and winter camps were located in lowlands like the upper Rhine valley west of the Black forest, the Swiss Mittelland, or the area north of the Lake Constance. There, reindeer was hunted intensively and probably communally. In spring, people moved into the uplands of the Swiss and the Swabian Jura, where horse hunting was more important during the warm seasons (and ibex hunting in the Swiss Jura). This movement is in accord with the data on raw material procurement (Fig. 8), which also fit well with the presumed migration routes of reindeer from the Swabian Alb into southern Bavaria. The data do not permit reconstruction of the settlement pattern for the Bavarian sites. The opposite settlement pattern is hypothesized for the middle Rhine area. Autumn and winter occupations were located in the Rhine valley and northern lowlands, where horse was hunted from large aggregation sites. One probable summer settlement area is in the mountainous zone of the Lahn valley, where reindeer was the most important prey, and the raw material procurement patterns suggest that there were others to the west and north west. In general, the Rhine valley probably was a main winter settlement area and summer settlements were in adjacent uplands. A third settlement pattern can be reconstructed for the central German sites. The preferred year-round hunting areas were the lowlands, between the Thuringian Forest in the south and the Elbe valley in the north, and horse was always the main prey, so there is no spatial separation of sites. A last important set of data relating to regional characteristics is the mobile art. Venus figurines, which are common to all groups (Table IV), are usually made of jet in the southwest but of stone and of ivory in the middle Rhine and central Germany (where mammoth and woolly rhino presumably survived latest). Antler was used as a raw material throughout the area, but the forms of the antler figurines differ greatly between the southwest and the northeast. In addition, the southern examples are usually perforated or notched for suspension as pendants. Sample sizes make more detailed com parison between regions hazardous, particularly since Petersfels is the only</page><page sequence="43">The Magdalenian in Western Central Europe 365 site in the southwest with numbers of figurines, so that it is difficult to distinguish there between regional and site-specific traits. Engravings of Venuses on stone slabs are also found in all geographical groups (Fig. 6). Their frequencies are very different between sites and regions so stylistic comparisons are not possible. However, unlike the figurines, the engravings are all very similar and represent a background theme linking the whole area of investigation. Similarly, some features of the animal representations unite all the geographical groups, while others show contrasts. The horse is represented most frequently in all regions. In the middle Rhine area and central Germany, this accords with its role as the main prey species, but elsewhere reindeer was more often hunted. The same discrepancy has also been observed in the Perigord (de Sonneville-Bordes, 1986). In northern Spain, on the other hand, there was some relationship between economic and artistic importance for the major species, red deer and ibex, but not for horse, which was much more frequently depicted than it was hunted (Altuna, 1979,1983, p. 235; Corchon, 1986, p. 236). Mammoth and woolly rhino are depicted only in the north and east of western Central Europe, where they may have survived longest, and so may also instance a correlation between mobile art and economic or ecological importance. This is not the case in the southwestern zone, where only the relative importance of ibex may be reflected in mobile art. (Another peculiar feature of the southwest are insects carved from jet.) These contradictions arise because mobile art reflects both ecology or economy and social behavior which is independent of that. It demonstrates the integration of Paleolithic man into his environment but also shows his ability to formulate an independent and human understanding and interpre tation of life and nature. The regional differences probably reflect the various possible combinations of these two aspects. The geographical clustering of Magdalenian sites in western Central Europe is not merely a product of external factors of the archaeological record but reflects the internal structure of the material. It was influenced by environmental differences, which required a variety of adaptations by Magdalenian hunters, this makes it possible to observe differences in settle ment patterns and, perhaps, hunting techniques. In addition, the lithic industries and, in particular, the mobile art also show regional patterning. These various features tend to divide western Central Europe into south western and northeastern regions. Northern Switzerland and southwestern Germany constitute one cluster, within which the only differences are the abundance of truncated blades in southwestern Germany and the somewhat greater importance of ibex in northern Switzerland. The Rhine was not a significant boundary in Magdalenian times. The Swabian Alb and the Swiss Jura were probably the preferred summer occupation areas, with</page><page sequence="44">366 Weniger corresponding winter settlements in the Swiss and southwestern German lowlands. We cannot at present see any finer division of this region. The northern and northeastern cluster includes the middle Rhine and central Germany, which differ in the greater exploitation of horse in central Germany. The Bavarian sites cannot be placed with this pattern, although connections with southwestern Germany are obvious. The Frankonian Alb, where most of the Bavarian sites lie, may have had a role similar to that of the Swabian Alb or the Swiss Jura, but the density of sites is still very low and the data do not permit a firm interpretation. Although these zones are ecologically and culturally distinct, the clusters all fall within a single archaeological complex, the Magdalenian of western Central Europe. Smaller geographical units can be seen within this, but thus far, they do not reflect significant archaeological differences. This may mean that the Magdalenian archaeological record is too unspecific and does not permit a finer resolution, or the parameters used in this study may be too broad to identify regionally on a smaller scale. Other problems may arise from changes in group divisions and cultural traditions through time. The sparsity of the archaeological record forces us to treat it as a single temporal unit and we are not able to use such changes as are probably expressed by stylistic variation in the mobile art. It might be possible to reach a finer division by including more of the data on the bone-antler industry and, particularly, on their decorative elements as well as on personal ornaments. Further research in this field is necessary. In any case, even in the present state of knowledge it is possible to divide broad geographical units within the Magdalenian, like western Central Europe, into smaller units that are defined by specific cultural traits. I would therefore argue that it is possible that some classificatory archaeological units might resemble those known from the ethnographic record, although we must remember that archaeological and ethnological units may not necessarily have the same meaning.
