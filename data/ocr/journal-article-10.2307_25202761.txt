<plain_text><page sequence="1">WAS GANDHARA ART A PRODUCT OF MAHAYANA BUDDHISM? By Y. Krisiian I. The Gandhara and Mathura Schools of Art made a revolu tionary contribution to the traditions and history of Buddhist art. Early Buddhist art was aniconic. At Bharhut, Sanchi and Amaravati before the 1st century a.d., the Buddha was represented only in symbols; a riderless horse, the tree or wheel, stupa, and the rest indicated the great renunciation, enlightenment, preaching of the doctrine and the nirvana. In Gandhara and Mathura art, however, the Buddha was represented in human form, and many sculptures representing bodhisattvas have been found in Gandhara. This radical change in Buddhist art has been explained as an expression of the change in the doctrinal content of Buddhism. "In artistic expression", observes Wheeler, "the outstanding difference between these two main types of Buddhism (Hinaydna and Mahayana) was that during the prevalence of the Hinayana teaching the Buddha himself was never represented. His presence was symbolized by a chair, a footprint, an umbrella, a riderless horse. About this symbol crowd the other participants in the scene, but there is no central commanding figure. In Mahayana Buddhism, on the other hand, the figure of the divine Buddha controls the assembly and is the focus of its composition . . .." He goes on to add: "Artistically, this change found its first full expression in what is now West Pakistan and Afganistan... Z'1 Towards the close of the last century Foucher averred that res ponsibility for the entire development of Gandhara art belongs to the Mahayana School.2 Zimmer expressed identical views: "... when suddenly we find that the completely Extinguished One has become visible in the frame of the illusory world, rendered so by illusory means, a new fundamental teaching, or at least a new con ception of the fundamental teaching must be sought.. . . And we know precisely what the new conception was: it was the Mahayana which is documented in the very period of the Gandhara monuments by the Prajndpdramitd texts".3 "So hallowed was the Buddha to 1 Sir Mortimer Wheeler: Rome Beyond The Imperial Frontiers (Penguin), p. 197. 2 Quoted by Griinwedel in Buddhist Art in India, p. 147. 3 Zimmer: The Art of Indian Asia, p. 340.</page><page sequence="2">OANDHARA ART 105 the early Indians that he was represented only by symbols before the 1st or 2nd century a.d. When the Buddha was first repre sented in anthropomorphic form at Gandhara western humanism clashed with Indian mysticism.'*1 "The Gandhara compositions", wrote Percy Brown, "mark the beginning of the movement, when the 1 llnayana or the primitive system of Buddhism was being super seded by the Mahayana or theistic system... ."2 The discovery of sculptures of bodhisattvas seems to reinforce this view of the Mahayanist origin of Gandharan art. "The Bodhisattvas . . . belong only to the northern or Mahayana schools. Except Maitreya, they are unknown in Ceylon, Siam, and Burma."3 "In the representation of the bodhisattvas*', observed Vogel, "we find in the Graeco-Buddhist art the beginning of the Mahayana".4 Gandhara art extended over the valleys of Kabul, Swat (Udyana), Taxila and Kashmir from the 1st to the 5th century a.d., in two distinct phases and over two geographical areas. In the first phase, from the 1st to the 3rd century a.d., the medium was stone (blue or green schist and phyllite) which was abundant in the plain of Peshawar (Takht-i-Bahi, Shah-ji-kl-Dherl, Sahri-Bahlol) and the Swat Valley. In the second phase, from the 3rd to the 5th century a.d., the sculp tures were done in stucco or lime plaster and clay; and the chief sites were spread over a much wider area, the Peshawar plain and Taxila in Pakistan, Kashmir in India, and Ha&lt;Jda (near Jallalabad), Bamiyan, Begram and Kabul in Afganistan. At its inception this art received considerable encouragement from the Kushan emperors, particularly Kaniska. According to tradition he convoked the fourth Buddhist council either at Jullandar or in Kashmir, and this composed the Vibhasa or commentaries on the three Pifakas. It was dominated by arhats of the Sarvastivada, a school of the Hinayana. There is thus no evidence of Mahayana Buddhism being patronized by Kaniska or even so being prevalent in this region. In fact, even in the time of the Chinese travellers in the 5th and the 7th centuries, when the Mahayana had fully developed in India, it did not appear to be a very popular or widespread faith. Their narratives indicate that the Hinayana was the predominant school of Buddhism in this region, certainly at the time of Fa-hsien's visit. 1 J.

Mahayana was followed in the time of HslUm Tsang2 and lluci-Ch'uo.8 At Swat, HsUan Tsang4 says that there were 1,400 old sat)i&gt;hdramas generally waste and desolate; the priests in these studied the Great Vehicle. But he adds that the schools of Vinaya traditionally known among them were the Sarvastivadins, the Dharmaguptas, the MahiSasakas, the KaSyapIyas and the Mahasanghikas ? all belonging to the Hina yana. In Gandhara proper, observed Fa-hsien,6 the people mostly studied the Hinayana. Near the great stupa built by Kani?ka eight or nine // from his capital, Puru?apura (Peshawar), in an old sang hdrdma built by Kani$ka, HsUan Tsang6 found priests studying the Hinayana. Again, at Pu?kalavatl, the old capital of Gandhara, he7 found the priests of an old sanghdrdma following the Hinayana. Regarding Kashmir,8 HsUan Tsang merely says that "there are about 100 sangharamas and 5,000 priests", without indicating the school to which they belonged. His other observations, however, indicate that both the Hinayana and Mahayana were followed: one little Sangharama, he9 tells us, had the standing figure of Avalokiteivara Bodhisattva, a Mahayanist manifestation; another ruined sanghdrdma had 30 priests who studied the Mahayana;10 a third sanghdrdma with about 100 priests belonged to the Maha sanghikas,11 a Hinayana school. A reading of Hsiian Tsang's account of Kashmir leaves the impression that a majority of the Buddhist monks were Hinayanists: he frequently speaks of Arhats but hardly at all of bodhisattvas. In Sakala, he12 found a sanghdrdma with about 100 priests of the Hinayana. The sangharamas of Taxila18 were in ruins in the time of HsUan Tsang; he found only a few priests studying the Mahayana. He adds, however, that in earlier times, near the stupa built by ASoka, there was a monastery where Kumaralabdha14 of the Sautrantika school (Hinayana) composed several treatises. 1 Beal's translation of Hsiian Tsang's: Si-yu-ki: Buddhist Records of the Western World, Vol. /., p. xxx &amp; xxxi. 2 Beal: ibid., p. 120.

Kabul Valley: If we now turn to the Kabul valley; the accounts of the Chinese travellers again confirm the preponderance of Hinayana Buddhists. At Bamiyan, where Hsiian Tsang saw the giant Buddha statues, there were ten convents with about 1,000 priests following the Lokottaravadin4 school of the Hinayana. At KapisV (Begram) there were 100 convents and some 6,000 priests who mostly studied the Mahayana. But near this place, three or four li away, he found a great sangharama with 300 or so priests belonging to the Hinayana. He also mentions that he had seen the figure of Kwan-tsz'-tsai Bodhisattva (Avalokitesvara) in the region.6 It is, however, important to note that the Chinese pilgrim Hoei-Lun (7th century a.d.) and HueiCh'ao,7 the Korean monk (8th century a.d.) found that Kapi?a was still a centre of Hinayana Buddhism. Neither Fa-hsien nor Hsiian Tsang mention the school of Buddhism followed in Nagarahara (Jalalabad). But the statement of Fa-hsien that "In this district there are as many as a thousand towers (stupas) in honour of Arhats and Pratyeka-Buddhas"* would permit one to conclude that the Hinayana was followed. At Lampaka9 (Lamghan) near Kabul, Hsiian Tsang saw ten sanghdrdmas with few priests, the majority of whom studied Mahayana. This is also confirmed by Huei Ch'ao.10 In Bannu11 again, according to Fa-hsien there were some 3,000 priests or more, all belonging to the Hinayana. The accounts of the Chinese travellers indicate that the over whelming majority of the sanghdrdmas in the Gandhara valley belonged to the Hinayana, in any case at the time of Fa-hsien's 1 Winternitz: ibid., p. 269. 2 Beal: ibid., Vol. II, p. 275.

The Kurram4 Casket inscription of the year 20 (a.d. 148) mentions the establishment of a relic of Sakyamuni in a stupa in a new Vihara "in the acceptance of the Sarvastivada teachers". Again the Bedadi5 Copper Ladle Inscription from Bedadi village near Mansehra dated in the year a.d. 168 speaks of a gift to the congregation of the KaSyapiya teachers. Likewise the Taxila6 Copper Ladle Inscription speaks of a gift to the congregation "in the Uttararama of Takshasila, in the acceptance of the Kasyapiyas". The Kasyapiyas were a Hinayana sect. The Palatu Dheri7 Jars inscription B is a donation to the order of the BahuSrutlyaka (Bahusrutiyas were a Hinayana sect) and Ka?yaplya Sramanas. Inscription C of these jars8 reads: "(Gift) of the Sravaka Dharma to the congregation of his relatives": the use of the expression "sravaka Dharma" clearly indicates that the order was of the Hinayana school. The Wardak9 Vase inscription of the year 51 (a.d. 179) from Wardak near Kabul speaks of the local Vihara being in "the acceptance of the Mahasarhghika teachers". 1 According to Prof. Takakusu the principal seat of the Sarvastivada school was in Kashmir, of which another branch was established in Gandhara. It was to the latter that the Abhidharma-hrdaya of Dharmottara belonged. A com mentary on the work called Santyukta-abhidharma-hrdaya by Dharmatnita became the fundamental text of the Gandhara branch and subsequently of the Chinese Abhidharma School. Takakusu: "Essentials of Buddhist Philosophy", pp. 56-58. 2 Sten Konow: Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, Vol. II, Part I. Kharosh^hi Inscriptions, p. 137. He dates the inscription to a.d. 128. There is, however, considerable con troversy about the date of this reliquary and whether it belongs to great Kaniska of the Kushana dynasty. Some scholars have placed the date of this reliquary in 3rd or even 4th century a.d. and consider that the Kaniska mentioned therein was another and a later ruler of the same name. See Lyons &amp; Ingholt: Gandharan Art in Pakistan, pp. 29-30. 3 Sten Konow: ibid., pp. 142-145. 4 Sten Konow: ibid., pp. 152-55. 5 Sten Konow: ibid., pp. 88-89. 8 Sten Konow: ibid., pp. 87-88. 7 Sten Konow: ibid., pp. 122. 8 Sten Konow: ibid., p. 122. 9 Sten Konow: ibid., pp. 165-170.

Sten Konow: ibid., p. 170.</page><page sequence="6">gandhara art 109 About the contents of Kharosh^hi Inscriptions Sten Konow observed: "Nor can it be doubted that it is the Hinayana which is represented ... the names of the Buddhist schools mentioned in the inscriptions do not leave any doubt. The Sarvastivadins are mentioned on the Lion Capital (from Sarnath), the Kanishka Casket of Peshawar, at Zeda, Kurram and Tor Dherai (in Loralai, Balu chistan) and the Ka?yapiyas in records from the Uttararama in Taxila, from the Urasarajya (Bedadi), and from Palatu Dheri. The Mahasarhghikas had a settlement in Wardak. .. "l II. The art of Gandhara proper centres primarily round the Buddha. The bodhisattvas and other gods of the Mahayana pan theon are rarely represented in the sculptures of Gandhara. Only two bodhisattvas are identified with Padmapani2 or AvalokiteSvara.3 The identification of the former, Padmapani, is not certain. Other representations of bodhisattvas are Siddhartha4 or Maitreya6 and the rest have remained unidentified. It is significant that the Mahayana Bodhisattvas appear late in the Gandhara school of art. The earliest phase of this school contains only representations of the Buddha.6 In "the earliest representation of the Buddha by a Gandhara artist known to us" in the relief portraying the story of the Pre sentation of the Jetavan Garden by Anathapirujada, "the Buddha 1 Sten Konow: ibid., p.

III. The art of Gandhara seems to know the tradition which believes in eight Buddhas,3 including six who preceded Sakyamuni, and Maitreya3 who was to follow him. In the Buddhavarpsa, belonging to the Pali Canon and a late addition to the Khuddakani kaya, the number of the previous Buddhas is extended to twenty four beginning with Dipankara, and ending with Maitreya. The number of Buddhas in the Mahayana is innumerable, as they exist (c) Bodhisattva Padmapani (Descriptive Catalogue No. 324) is assigned to Group IV but could be in Group III. Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara (Descriptive Catalogue No. 326) is assigned to Group III. According to the chronology adopted by Marshall in ibid., the Avalokitesvara of fig. 124 already mentioned belongs to a.d. 140 to 241 called 'Later Maturity Period' by Marshall. (d) Unidentified Bodhisattvas are assigned to Groups III or IV. (i) Group III ? Descriptive Catalogue Nos. 313-16, 318-23, 325, 327-330, 499. 500, 501, 502, 541, 546-48, 550, 552, 553, 554, 555-58, 564. The sculptures catalogue Nos. 499 and later can also be assigned to Group IV. (ii) Group IV ? Descriptive catalogue Nos. 317, 543, 545, 549, 550, 551. The sculpture of catalogue No. 545 could be in Group III. The Dhyanl-Buddhas of fig. 135, p. 102 in Marshall, ibid., belong to the Later Maturity Period. The panel contains four seated images of the Buddha in Dhyana-mudrd and their identification with Dhyanl Buddhas as done by Marshall is doubtful as Dhyanl-Buddhas are five in number and only one of them is in the Dhyana-mudrd. 1 Marshall: ibid., pp. 41-42, fig. 53 and n.l, p. 42. 2 See the relief from Muhammad Nari in ill. 82 at page 130 of Grunwedel: ibid. Again in the fragmentary sculpture of The Visit of Indra and his Harpist to the Indrasala Cave* (Lahore No. 550), though a row of six seated figures, five Buddhas and one Bodhisattva onthe lower part of the fragment, only survives, it is safe to assume that there were two more figures now missing, making a total of eight, seven most recent Buddhas of the past and Maitreya. Lyons Sc Ingholt: ibid. p. 91, Descriptive Catalogue No. 135 (Group III). Again in the damaged sculpture "Buddha with Worshippers. Amorini" (Lahore No. 2306, 2058 and 2059), five standing Buddhas are portrayed, but there were undoubtedly two more as well as a Maitreya. Lyons &amp; Ingholt: ibid., p. 133 Descriptive Cata logue No. 224 (Group III). Likewise, though only two standing Buddhas survive on the sculpture "Two Buddhas" ? Peshawar No. W.U.1927, seven Buddhas were undoubtedly portrayed. Lyons &amp; Ingholt: ibid., p. 114, Des criptive Catalogue No. 228 (Group IV). The sculpture Peshawar, No. 794 containing seven figures and identified by Spooner as the seven last Buddhas of our age is doubtful as three of the figures are attired in princely robes, which are associated only with bodhisattvas. Lyons Sc Ingholt: ibid., p. 84, Descriptive Catalogue No. 120 (Group III). 3 Maitreya, being a future Buddha, is, strictly speaking at present, a bod hisattva only.</page><page sequence="8">OANDHARA art 111 eternally and the parinirvana of a Buddha does not mean his extinction. In Tflntric Buddhism, there arc i\vc pre-eminent Manual Buddhas, corresponding to the five Dhyani Buddhas.1 The iigural representa tion of eight Buddhas (including Maitreya) only clearly indicates that the school belonged to a period when the number of Buddhas had not multiplied and is pre-Mahayanic. Again the frequent representations of the Dipankara Jataka in which Sumati, the future Buddha, throws flowers at Dipankara Buddha, was only natural as Sumati was to become the Buddha Sakyamuni. This story was an essential part of the biography of the Gautama Buddha; and Dipankara Buddha is not an exclusively Mahayana Buddha. IV. The identification of a large number of sculptures in Gandhara with the Bodhisattva Maitreya indicates that the Sarvastivadin cult of this divinity was dominant in that region. In fact, the cult of Maitreya was developed by the Sarvastivadins2 and, therefore his representation in Gandhara would be only natural. The Maitreya of the Sarvastivadins is very different from the bodhisattva mahasattvas such as AvalokiteSvara and ManjuSrl, and also from Bodhisattva Maitreya of the Mahayana. The Bodhisattva Maitreya of the Sarvastivadins is the future Buddha who resides in the Tu$ita heaven before being born among men to reveal the doctrine. He is a being who has yet to attain bodhi or enlightenment. Again Tusjta is the third of the eleven Kama-lokas as distinct from the twenty-one Brahma-lokas (consisting of four arupa and seventeen rupa-lokas). The latter are higher planes. The resident of Tu?ita is only a bodhisattva, distinct from Maitreya, the Manu?i-Buddha of the Dhyanl-Buddha Amoghasiddhi and the Dhyani-Bodhisattva ViSvapanl The Manu?i-Buddha Maitreya resides in the Akani?tha 1 Ingholt's suggestion (Lyons &amp; Ingholt: ibid., p. 84) that the sculpture Peshawar No. 794 can be explained along the lines of Mahayana theology as portraying the five Bodhisattvas and their corresponding Buddha counterparts does not appear to be tenable unless we suppose that the complete panel con tained ten figures instead of seven or eight. 2 It is significant to note that the jatakas and the avadanas do not form part of the Vinaya of the Sarvastivadins of Kashmir, while they were included in the Vinaya of the Sarvastivadin school of Mathura. (Przyluski: Fables in the Vinaya-Pitaka of the Sarvastivadin School; Indian Historical Quarterly, Vol. V, 1929, pp. 2-3). See also Przyluski: "Darsfantika, Sautrantika and Sarvastivadin" in Louis de la ValUe Poussin Memorial Volume, p. 33). It may be presumed that the Vinaya of the Sarvastivadins of Gandhara was the same as those of Kashmir. That would perhaps explain, inter alia, what Foucher observed, a marked diminution in the number of jatakas in the art at Gandhara. (Foucher: The Beginnings of Buddhist Art, p. 26.) JRAS.

Thus the Bod hisattva Maitreya of the Sarvastivadins does not occupy the highest planes of Buddhist cosmology.9 In iconography also, the Maitreya of tJnndhitra Is different from the Maitreya of Mahayana. In Gandhara,8 he is crowned and bejewelled and holds a vessel of ambrosia (mangalakalaia) in one of his hands. Another characteristic is that the hair at the top of the head is arranged in two loops forming a horizontal figure 8.4 In the Sadhanamdld, as a minor god, he accompanies others, carries a chowric in the right hand and a Nagake?ara flower in the left.6 As a principal divinity in the Sadhanamdld, he is three-faced, three eyed and four-armed, sitting in the Paryahka attitude on an animal with two hands in Vydkhyana mudrd, one in Varadamudra and one holding the Nagakeiara flower.8 In the Manjuvajra Mandald1 and Durgatiparisodhana Mantjlala* similar descriptions of Maitreya occur. In China he is the "Laughing Buddha" (Mi-lo-Fu), a giant hilarious old man on whom boys are clambering. The two distinctive marks of Maitreya9 are a stupa in the crown and a scarf wound around the waist and tied on the left side with the 1 The number of the heavens in the rupa-lokas varies from 16 to 18. The Abhidharmakoia has 17 heavens. 2 In Japanese Mahayana Buddhism there are three main paradises: (i) Tosotsu ten (Tusita) or the "Heaven of Contentment", of the future Buddha, Maitreya. (ii) Gokuraku Jodo (SukhavatI) of Buddha Amita and (iii) Ryoju-sen (Grdhra ku|a) of Buddha Sakyamuni. The first, the Heaven of Contentment, is not a full fledged heaven; it is still in formation since its ruler Maitreya has still to attain Buddhahood; in fact, it is a kind of "ante-room for a real paradise". Anesaki in 'The Mythology of All Races' Vol. VIII (Chinese &amp; Japanese) p. 241. 3 "In the iconographic development of both Bodhisattva, Siddharata and Maitreya, there seem to have been two currents, one Brahmanic, the other regal, so that neither can be claimed as sole distinguishing mark for either Bodhisattva.... Under these circumstances the presence of a Brahmanic water flask ... cannot decide the issue in favour of Maitreya." Lyons and Ingholt: ibid., p. 131, Descriptive Catalogue No. 279, Group II. Again, the flask held in the hand is "an attribute both of the Bodhisattva Siddharata and Maitreya". Lyons and Ingholt: ibid., p. 135, Descriptive Catalogue No. 288, Group II (III). Again, the lunar crescent in the Usplsa is conclusive evidence for identification with Maitreya.

These we consider as belonging to later iconography; the Maitreyas of Gandhara do not carry a stupa in their crowns.1 V. Another personage who is frequently represented at Gand hara is Vajrapdyi. He almost invariably accompanies the Buddha. The different representations may have differing features:8 one is with a tonsure, another is bearded and another looks like a demon; but all hold a Vajra in hand. He is, however, entirely free from all ornaments.8 The Vajrapaqi of Gandhara is different from the VajrapHi.il of the Mahayana pantheon. In the latter he is jewelled, provided with a lotus scat,4 and is seen in a triad with Amitayus (or ManjuSri) and Padmapani (AvalokiteSvara).6 In Tantric Budd hism, he is the ferocious emanation of the Dhydni-Buddha Vajradhara and the spiritual reflex the dhyani bodhisattva, of Dhyani-Buddha Ak$obhya.6 As one of the group of eight Dhyani-Bodhisattva, in addition to carrying a Vajra in his right hand, he holds his left hand in Varada mudrd.1 VI. Zimmer expresses the view that the sculptures in which the Buddha is provided with a lotus seat or pedestal are Mahayanic in origin.8 "... the lotus is generally employed to denote a universal, 1 See the eighth Buddha identified as Maitreya at the bottom of the relief from Muhammad Nari reproduced at illustration 82 in Grimwedel: ibid, and the Bodhisattva represented in the broken relief from Kafirkot in Swat, illustration 140 ibid.

That is why the Buddhas, the first-born of that reality, are entitled no less than Brahma to the lotus throne.

"It cannot be conceived that the Body of Beatitude (Sambhogakdya) could have been seated anywhere else than on the angelic lotus .. ."2 "The prolongation of the stem, which is the axis of the sensible world, bears at the summit of the universe the spiritual lotus-throne of the Sambhogakaya."3 Coomaraswamy makes a somewhat similar suggestion: The Buddha is merely an image, akfti, of the Dharma, existent in the world. "The primary ontological significance of the lotus is precisely with respect to this existence, astitva, sthdyitd, sthiti, a being 'firmly grounded in the possibilities of existence', commonly called the Waters."4 Padmasana (along with Vajrasana) differentiates "the station of Sambhogakaya from that of the Dharmakaya, which is inaccessible even to the angelic eye";6 the lotus denotes a birth and manifestation, of Dharmakaya, which is incomprehensible and formless, "primarily in the intelligible, or also and consequently in the sensible, world ... ."fl The Trikdya doctrine postulating the Body of Bliss (Sambhogakdya) with the Dharmakaya and Nirmdnakdya, was very much posterior7 to the use of the lotus throne for the Buddha. The Padmasana in early Buddhist art should not therefore be interpreted to signify Mahayana affiliations, whatever may have been its significance in later Buddhist art. There were different types of seats for the Buddha: the pallanka or patfa-pallanka, just a slab of stone with rectangular base, the simhdsana or lion throne, and the padmasana or lotus-seat. The padmasana appears to have come into vogue in contrast to the simhdsana (lion throne), the earlier throne or seat of the Buddha.8 The latter was essentially an imitation of the paraphernalia of an earthly ruler. When its inappropriateness was realized in depicting a being who had won spiritual supremacy, the padmasana came into use. It was eminently a symbol of spiritual suzerainity or attainment as distinct from temporal. 1 Coomaraswamy: Elements of Buddhist Iconography, p. 69, n. 33. 2 Paul Mus: "Le Buddha pare"' quoted in Coomarswamy: ibid., p. 55. 3 Mus: quoted in ibid., p. 55.

Coomaraswamy: ibid., p. 43.</page><page sequence="12">GANDHARA ART 115 Again, as Zimmer himself observes: "The earliest extant images of Buddhas seated on lotus calyxes are found in the later Gandhara works of the 3rd century a.d.1 As such either the Gandhara sculp tures before the 3rd century a.d. belonged to the Hinayana or the lotus symbol was unknown to the earlier art of the Mahayana.2 It should be noted that the story of the Great Miracle of Sravastl, as given in the Pali Canon, belongs to the pre-Christian era, and relates that the Buddha multiplied his bodies, which were seen seated and standing on lotuses.3 The lotus support for the Buddha was not, therefore, an exclusively Mahayanic emblem of his trans cendental character. Nor was such a support an exclusive privilege of transcendental beings, Buddhas or Bodhisattvas.4 It is a symbol of the quality of detachment ?just as a lotus growing and living in water is untouched by water, so a Buddhist is in the world and yet out of it and uncontaminated by it. The lotus which serves as a throne to support an image or a statue of a holy man is the emblem of Buddhist qualities and symbolizes the Law; as a throne of a 1 Zimmer: ibid., p. 175. Ingholt expresses the view that the lotus seat probably was not used until the period of sculptures belonging to Group HI, viz., 300-400 a.d. of the groups in which he has divided the Gandharan sculptures. Lyons &amp; Ingholt: ibid., p. 33. According to Coomaraswamy "The Buddha is in fact represented padmasana, kamalasana, from late Andhra times onwards, that is almost from the beginning of anthropomorphic iconography" ibid., p. 48. He, however, has observed that though no representation of the Buddha on a lotus seat exists prior to the second century a.d. in actually surviving works of art of Gandhara, and in late Andhra works from AmaravatI, Sri LaksmI was seated on a lotus at least as early as the second century b.c. and it is likely that the earlier examples were on less durable material or had been painted. Ibid., pp. 21-22. 2 In support of the derivation of Miran paintings from the art of Gandhara, F. H. Andrews observes that in sculptures and paintings alike the figures at Miran, with few exceptions, are barefooted and do not stand on padmasana. (Andrews: Wall Paintings from Ancient Shrines in Central Asia, p. xxi.) This would indicate that in the parent school of Gandhara, lotus support was not a characteristic feature of the sculptures of the Buddha. 3 Lyons &amp; Ingholt: ibid., plates No. XX, 2 The Buddha in Meditation on Inverted Lotus Throne', Karachi and No. XXI, 2 The Buddha in Meditation and Other Buddhas*. According to Ingholt these sculptures are illustrations of the doctrines of Mahayana theology: ibid., p. 38. See also ibid., pp. 121-23. "The Preaching Buddha on Lotus Throne", Lahore, No. 1135 from Mohamed Nari, Descriptive Catalogue No. 255. 4 In the sculpture of the "Preaching Buddha on Lotus Throne" Lahore, No. 1135, flanking the lotus are a man and a woman, both standing on lotuses. They have been identified with Luhasudatta and his wife. Lyons and Ingholt: ibid., p. 121, Descriptive Catalogue No. 255. See also: ibid., plate XVI, 3 The Teaching Buddha on Lotus Throne' and p. 124. Again in the sculptures shown in Plates No. XVI, 4 The Teaching Buddha on Inverted Lotus Throne' and No. XX, 2 The Buddha in Meditation on Inverted Lotus Throne', Karachi (Lyons and Ingholt: ibid.) elephant nagas emerging from watery base and supporting the lotus seat of the Buddha carry figures on the tips of their trunks supported</page><page sequence="13">116 GANDHARA ART Buddha or a Bodhisattva, it symbolizes most particularly the sovereignty of the personage represented, or the authority of the Law.1 We suggest that the lotus seat at Gandhara in its earlier phases is not always an emblem of divinity but of the Miracle of Sravastl. Describing fig. 122 from Loriyan Tangai representing the Miracle and belonging to the Later Maturity Period (a.d. 140 to 241), Marshall observes that "the only features that remotely connect it with the great miracle are the border of conventional lotus leaves fringing the edge of the stool on which the Buddha is seated and the architectural setting which presumably represents the pavilion built by King Prasenajit. For the rest, it is a matter of guesswork to identify this scene or the actors in it".2 Again in Marshall's fig. 1233 ? the Miracle of SravastI from Muhammad Nari ? besides the Buddha, two of the reduplicated images (one of them in the photo graph is damaged) are shown on lotus seats beneath the small arches on the side of the Buddha's head. But this representation of the Grand Miracle is confined to the middle band of the relief; the upper and lower bands have no connection with the Great Miracle scene. None of the six previous Buddhas, nor the last Buddha, Sakyamuni, nor the future Buddha, Maitreya, at the bottom of the panel, is shown standing on lotus. Similarly it is the lotus seat beneath the Buddha in Marshall's figures 124 and 125 that enables us to identify the reliefs as repre senting the Miracle of Sravasti. on lotuses. In the case of the first sculpture, these have been identified with Luhasudatta on the left and his wife on the right. In the case of the latter (plate XX, 2) the figure on the left is a monk, and on the right a nun. See also Lyons &amp; Ingholt: ibid., p. 128. In the sculpture representing The Buddha as Supernal Sun* from Amaravati c. a.d. 200, there are two dancing apsarases, supported by lotuses. See Cooma raswamy: ibid., plate 1, fig. 2. Again, in Hokke Mandara, a bronze work of a.d. 673 from Nara, the Tathagata Sakyamuni on the left, is attended, inter alia, by Ananda and Rahula who are standing on lotus supports. See Coomaraswamy: ibid., plate VIII, fig. 30. In the paintings of Bezeklik in Turfan, lotus support has been found in the case of devatas ? (Andrews: ibid. Bez. i. M, N. p. 53 ? plate XII and Bez. i. J. K. pp. 55-56 ? plate XIII), a bearded naga deity (Andrews: ibid. Bez. x.

The paintings in the vaults and soffits of the gigantic Buddha at Bflmiyftn are Mahftyfinic, as they represent a Mancjala or a primitive form of the paradises of the transcendental Buddhas. The Man^ala depicted in the cave at Kakrak is con sidered to be the earliest known pictorial example of Tantric Budd hism. These have been dated to the 6th or the 7th century a.d.1 The Buddha wearing a jewel-studded chasuble over monastic garments and having heavy earrings is a product of the Mahayana and is dated to about the 7th century a.d.2 The stelae or the rock carvings found in Swat representing LokeSvara, a bodhisattva of the Mahayana pantheon, belongs to the 7th and 8th centuries a.d.8 The Manqlala depicting the Sakyamuni Buddha surrounded by twenty similar Buddhas on a smaller scale discovered on rock near Skardu is also dated to about the 10th century a.d.4 Again the paintings at Bamiyan are in the style of the later Central Asian paintings. Its sculptures, except for the two colossal Buddhas, are neither made of schist, the medium popular in early Gandhara art, nor of stucco, the medium of the later Gandhara art, but of clay mixed with straw in a framework of wood, a technique that was popular in Central Asia and Tun Huang. That is why Hackin observed that Bamiyan at this time belonged to Central Asia and its art is Irano-Buddhistic.6 It would, therefore, be clearly inappropriate to determine the nature and content of the art of Gandhara from paintings and sculptures which are un doubtedly Mahayanic in character but which belong to an artistic 1 Rowland: Wall Paintings of India, Central Asia and Ceylon ?

He goes on to say that the so called 'bejewelled Buddha' belongs to the last phase of Mahayana Buddhism in India. 3 Tucci: 'Preliminary Report on an Archaeological Survey in Swat' "East &amp; West" New Series, Vol. 9, No. 4, Dec., 1958, pp. 322-24. 4 Fosco Mariani: Karakoram, translated into English by James Cadell, p. 60.

Judged in this context, the art of Gandhara contains hardly anything which can be considered as an expression of the Mahfiyftna school of Buddhism.1 This conclusion ilnds confirmation from the content of the Buddhist paintings of Gandhara inspiration. The Buddhist paintings at Miran discovered by Sir Aurel Stein are dated to about the 3rd or 4th century a.d. These are considered to be "the only examples of the same (Gandhara) art expressed in paintings, at present known".2 Here, the Buddha is just an ordinary man in the act of teaching and distinguished only by his plain nimbus and the colour of his robe.8 There are no bodhisattvas of the Mahayana pantheon in these paintings.4 It may not be out of place to mention that the hallmark of the early Mahayana Buddhist art of China was its representation of the Lotus (Saddharma-pundarika) theme, a stQpa with the Buddha and Prabhtttaratna sitting side by side, and Vimalaklrtl and Man juSrl engaged in a discourse,6 the former representing the superior Chinese man (Chun-tzu). In the later Chinese Buddhist art, the characteristic features are the Paradise scenes and the mang!ala in which the Buddha or a bodhisattva is surrounded by a host of bodhisattvas and attendant monks, and the rest. There is no evidence to indicate the popularity of the Lotus and VimalaklrtinirdeSa Sutras in Gandhara; there are no representations of Prabhutaratna nor of ManjuSri and Vimalaklrti.6 1 Rowland has also observed that "The sculpture of Gandhara seems to confirm the testimony of the Chinese pilgrims on the predominance of the Hinayana sect of Buddhism". The Art and Architecture of India, p. 78. 8 Adrcws: ibid., p. xx. 3 Andrews: ibid., p. xxi. 4 Andrews also came to the conclusion that "The Buddhism of Miran with which our earliest paintings were concerned seems to have been of the simple form, the Hinayana**. "Central Asian Wall Paintings** in Indian Art and Letters, 1938, Vol. VIII, p. 12. 6 J. Leroy Davidson: ibid. The pictorial representation of paradises was the work of Chinese designers. Andrews: ibid., p. 13. 6 According to S. Mizuno and T. Nagahiro, "representations of Prabhutaratna and Sakyamuni are found all over YUn-Kang and continued at Lung Men, but are not found in Central Asia, and only once in Gandhara,... and then probably under T'ang (!) influence*. They are found in Tun-huang from the Wei period.. .** Mizuno and Nagahiro: YUn-Kang: The Buddhist cave temples of the fifth century A.D. in North China, Vols. VIII-1X, p. 73, Quoted by Basil Gray in Gray and Vincent: "Buddhist Cave Paintings at Tun-huang", p. 18-19 n. We could not, however, trace any sculpture of Prabhutaratna in Griinwedel: ibid., Lyons and Ingholt: ibid, and Marshall: ibid.</page><page sequence="16">GANDHARA art 119 How do we account for the emergence of an anthropomorphic art at Gandhara, for this apparently radical departure from the aniconic early Buddhist art of SftftchI, Bhfirhut and Amaravati, if there was no change in the doctrinal content of Buddhism as would appear from epigraphic records, from the accounts of the Chinese travellers and from an analysis of the content of Gandhara art? "The transition from non-representation to anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha" observes Tucci, "need not have been caused by the sudden appearance of a foreign art type. More pro bably it was the result of new spiritual directions in Buddhism itself: increased emphasis on the laity, on devotionalism, the need for a savior; compounded by the political drive to reach new peoples accustomed to other religious forms".1 In the absence of any evidence, the suggestion of political considerations necessitating concessions to foreign elements steeped in alien religious traditions is purely speculative. In fact the art of Gandhara (and of Mathura) did not involve any break with tradition. Its anthropomorphism was the logical outcome of a powerful personality cult which is the most outstanding feature of the early Buddhist art.2 The Greek had represented his gods in human form. To him anthropomorphism did not involve a violation of any canonical injunction or violence to any deep rooted tradition of aniconism. At the same time the Bhakti cult as evident in the early Buddhist art, had prepared the people for the change that had found consummation in anthro pomorphism. This, it should be noted, did not involve a break with the past inasmuch as the "anthropomorphic" did not mean that the images were "naturalistic".8 The Buddha images represented an ideal type and to that extent were still symbolic even though strictly iconic. 1 Tucci: Encyclopedia of World Art, Vol. 11, Buddhism, 682. 2 See the author's article The Origin of the Buddha Image* MARG., April, 1962, pp. 15-16. 8 Coomaraswamy: 'The Nature of Buddhist Art" Introductory Essay to Rowland's 'The Wall Paintings of India, Central Asia and Ceylon'', p. 16. "... the Buddha image is not in any sense a portrait, but a symbol;... the image is devoid of any semblance of organic structure; it is not a reflection of anything that has been physically seen, but an intelligible form or formula*'. Again " ... the 'anthropomorphic" image in India remains abstract..." Coomaraswamy: Elements of Buddhist Iconography, p. 40.</page></plain_text>
