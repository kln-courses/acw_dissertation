<plain_text><page sequence="1">Napoleon and the Church Lewis Rayapen 44 Lancaster Gate London W2 England and Gordon Anderson Box 1311 New York, New York 10113 USA The relationship between church and state has been a perennial problem for modern democracies. Napoleon Bonaparte attempted to reconcile religion and politics in order to bring social stability to France which was suffering from moral decadence and de-Christianization policies. The Concordat of 1801, and other expressions of Napoleon's religious policy, ultimately failed because Napoleon viewed religion more as a means than an end. Introduction The relationship between a prince and the church gives rise to an eminently historical problem. Behind the obvious perennial issue of church and state rela- tions, there is the deeper concern of the relationship between the spiritual and the temporal. The two powers have not always, if at all, been happy bedfellows. At stake is the whole question of the human condition and the value of existence, and the way of life most conducive to the satisfaction of man's needs and his desire for happiness. The two orders have competed more often than they have cooperated with one another in their claims to bring about the ideal world. Napoleon Bona- parte is the epitome of a lay attempt to resolve this problem once and for all. His efforts at a religious settlement for France, and the rest of Europe, are worthy of investigation. This is the primary purpose of the paper. We look, first of all, at the religious situation prior to the accession of Napoleon as first consul (1799) in order to understand the historical background against which he operated and to have some insight into the problems he inherited. Next, we sketch the major opinions of Napoleon on religion as a whole in order to Dr. Lewis Rayapen, born in Mauritius, received his Ph.D. in French from the University College of Swansea, Wales.

The ideas he held help explain his policy and provide us with a better understanding of the motivation behind the historical events of his religious policy. The Concordat of 1801 , which we examine thirdly, is the central expression of this policy. With the Concordat, due attention needs to be paid to the accompanying Organic Articles, the Coronation of Napoleon as Em- peror of the French, and the Imperial Catechism. Napoleon was at this stage at the height of his achievement in his dealings with both the Gallican forces and the Ultramontane Church of Pius VII. The events that follow show clearly that Napoleon had built on sand; the precarious edifice he had forced into existence tottered and collapsed with Leipzig (1813). His solution had been no solution at all. Or was it? Why? What conclu- sions can be drawn from Napoleon's attempt to solve church-state problems? What lessons, if any, can be learned? What influence has the thwarted settlement had on later developments? /. Background to Napoleon 's Religious Policy The Ancien Regime rested upon a tacit coalition between the throne and the altar. The church, since the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685), meant primarily the Roman Catholic Church, anti-intellectual and retrograde in its outlook, and stagnant because of rampant corruption of the clergy, especially the higher clergy. The rising middle-class chafed under papal authoritarianism, and bitterly resented the abuses of the ecclesiastics, viz., simony, plurality of office, immorality, and extravagance. The bankrupt church was a burden to the state, which increased tithes and taxes from the nominal one tenth to an impossible one third. 1 The church was intolerant, repressing freethinkers with utmost severity. In 1766, for example, a certain LaBarre was beheaded and burnt for not kneeling before the Host. After 1757, it was death to any author or printer tending to discredit religion.2 Protes- tants were subject to discrimination and persecution. Perrodo-Lemoyne reports that the law recognized only those marriages contracted in the presence of a Catholic priest; the wife of a Protestant was, therefore, a concubine and the children born of such a union illegitimate.3 The revolutionary National Assembly welcomed the opportunity to eliminate these abuses. It sought "the creation of a national church, free of political abuses and social inequalities of the ancien regime, independent of any kind of foreign ecclesiastical control, democratic in its forms and geared to the new system of local administration."4 With the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (1790), the Assembly had attempted a religious settlement. The main features of the 1790 religious settlement were: 1) adjustment of the boundaries of the diocese to those of the departments; 2) abrogation of the Concordat of 1516 by provision of the election of bishops and cures by all those on the roll of active citizens, irrespective of their religious belief; 3) payment by the state of reasonable salaries to both upper and lower clergy; and 4) canonical institution of bishops by French metro- politans instead of by the pope.5 The title of archbishop was abolished and 10 metropolitan areas organized. The decision to pay the clergy had actually been voted on November 2, 1789. No cure was to have less than 1,200 livres a year.</page><page sequence="3">INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE REVIEW 1 19 This doubled the wage of the lower clergy but threatened the bishops. A liberal scale of pensions was allowed existing members of the clergy. Orders which studied, taught, or nursed were preserved; others were to be left to die out. On February 23, 1790, the law no longer recognized monastic vows.6 The Civil Constitution was favorable to the state and to half of the lower clergy. It offered them a better chance of promotion, enabled them to nominate their vicars, in- creased their salary, provided them security of tenure, and held the bishops to residence and purely spiritual functions. It was not favorable to the pope, however, and to the French episcopate. While 50 percent of the lower clergy took the oath of allegiance, only seven bishops did so.7 The majority of the bishops emigrated; and, together with the insoumissionnaires that stayed and went underground, they were later to instigate religious uprisings and the assassination of the Constitution- als. As a reaction, the Jacobin extreme left emerged from the ranks of Dominican friars and France saw a schism between the Constitutionals and the Unconstitu- tionals. The Jacobins embarked on a policy of de-Christianization. Their leaders sought "a cult more congruous to the beleaguered Revolution ... the provision of a solemn focus for patriotism ... a new social order of justice and fraternity to be realized on earth ... a secular religion of humanity."8 The calendar of the Revolution replaced the Gregorian one. Further, between 1793 and 1802, the Jacobins established revolutionary cults (the Cult of Reason, the Cult of the Supreme Being, the Cult of the Decadi) with a view to displace the Constitutional Church worship. The Convention of 1792 brought about the separation of church and state. The churches were open to the public for worship and ministers of religion had to take an oath of allegiance to the Republic. The hours of a church building were rotated so that Constitutionals, the Cult of the Decadi, Catholics willing to take the oath, as well as other small eclectic cults, all shared the same place.9 Between 1795 and 1799, the Directory furthered anticlerical policy to break the power of the pope.10 When he became first consul (1799), Napoleon inherited both this separation of church and state and the moral decadence of revolutionary France. William Sloane reports that "The Revolution left France with moral licence. . . . Any situation to come would have to be for the better."11 Furthermore, he had to resolve the nature of his relationship with the papacy. Back in 1797, after Napoleon had left for Egypt, the Jacobins and other zealous partisans had caused incidents which gave the Directory a reason to have general Berthier enter Rome and drive out Pius VI. The pope had been forced to flee from town to town. On July 14, 1799, the exhausted pope reached Valence where he finally died. 12 Now that he has become first consul, what shall be Bonaparte's relationship with the new pope? Napo- leon's initial desire was to save the Holy See. II. Napoleon and Religion Napoleon inherited a Catholic sensitivity from his mother and anticlericalism from his father. Religion appealed to his romantic imagination. "Is it not a fact," he asked, "that the Catholic religion appeals more strongly to the imagination by the ceremonies than the sublimity of its doctrines? When you want to arouse enthusiasm in the masses, it is necessary, above all things, to appeal to the eyes."13</page><page sequence="4">120 SUMMER 1991, VOLUME 66, NUMBER 3 Later influences were to include the romanticism of Rousseau, from whose Social Contract he drew the principle that the state must be the guardian of religion in order not to be victim of it.14 He is heir also to the revolutionary ardor of Robespierre, and the pragmatism of Abbe Raynal. Was it not Raynal who had said that the state does not exist for religion, but religion for the state?15 Overt anticleri- calism belonged to his younger days (1785-1794) when he voiced criticism against a church which, according to him, disrupted the unity of the state.16 To him, the clergy had always been against the freedom of nations.17 They infiltrated men's consciences and thus dominated their lives. Napoleon felt he could not preserve his freedom of thought and action under the guidance of a confessor who would rule him with the fear of hell. 18 At this stage of his life, Napoleon readily identified with the grievances of the Revolution and felt religion was superfluous. The state, he believed, could adequately provide for human happiness, even though the subsequent downfall of Robespierre prompted him to do some serious rethinking. In 1790, he learned about the power of religion in the lives of men when he and his brother were molested by a religious proces- sion. On one occasion, in the autumn of 1790, Napoleon and his elder brother Joseph were in danger of losing their lives because of their disrespect for a procession of priests and devotees who were protesting the new anticlerical de- crees of the French National Assembly. The two young democrats barely escaped condign chastisement; and Napoleon, if not Joseph, seems always to have retained a vivid impression of the power of the Orthodox creed over the Latin people. The fall of Robespierre also brought a significant change in his attitude toward religion: religion was necessary for the moral health of a nation.19 That is why he could disregard the instructions of the Directory to capture the pope in 1796, saying that he would "rather be the Saviour of the Holy See. "20 Religion was necessary for the state to shape the minds of men and establish social order.21 Religion attempts to satisfy man's metaphysical anguish, and answer questions of man's origin and destiny.22 Every religion ought to be respected, proclaimed Napoleon with impe- rial magnanimity: "The legions of Rome protected all religions," he is reported to have said to his soldiers before embarking on his campaign to Egypt. "You will meet with customs different from those of Europe. You must learn to protect them."23 Every religion attempts to meet man's spiritual needs in its own unique way. What is "essential for public order and morality is not that all men should have the same religion, but that everyone should be attached to his own. "M But so far as France is concerned, the Catholic faith was the right one.25 Napoleon proclaimed himself a Catholic but did not partake of the sacraments, though he said he sought the consolation which religion gave.26 Le Moyne argues that Napoleon was thoroughly an unbeliever and attended religious ceremonies only if they gave him greater power in the eyes of the people. He could not bear, however, that the slightest form of authority not emanate from him.27 Thus, to Napoleon, religion was also political expediency: "It was by becoming a Catholic that I pacified the Vendee, and a Mussulman that I established myself in Egypt. It was [by] becoming ultramontane that I won the public opinion in Italy. If I rule the people of Jews, I would rebuild the temple of Solomon. Paradise is a central spot whether the soul of man proceeds along different roads; every sect has its own road."28 Napoleon believed in an omnipotent Creator God, for the reasons traditionally</page><page sequence="5">INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE REVIEW 121 advanced in the cosmological and teleological arguments.29 His God reminds one of the Aristotelean Unmoved Mover, as well as of a kind of Platonic entity at the acme of a spiritual hierarchy governing all things.30 All religions, however, were anthropomorphic phenomena. As for Jesus, like any other prophet of divine authority, he had words of life and power. Napoleon, therefore, used Jesus' words to confront the pope. "The present Pope has too much power, priests are not made for me. Let them follow the example of Peter and Paul and the Holy Apostles who were worthy of any Boniface. Why not let the Pope render unto Caesar what is Caesar's?"31 Man, for Bonaparte, was a spiritual being and he would not brook that priests reserve themselves sway over men's minds and leave him power over physical bodies, keeping the soul and tossing him the corpse!32 Napoleon believed the soul to be some kind of ethereal entity that reincarnates.33 A man's conscience is the most sacred of things and the worst tyranny is to force a people to embrace a religion contrary to their beliefs.34 The pope, as the spiritual leader of the church, was indispensable for the proper administration of France. To Napoleon, the pope's main fonction was to institute bishops, consecrate the Republic, name curates, or perform any religious duty that could benefit the state, and bring unity. He needed the pope as the central figure that would assist him to bring the Catholics of France under the authority of the Republic (which, in effect, means the authority of the future emperor).35 The pope, to be a good leader of the clergy, ought to issue a bull or a document ordering priests to obey the government.36 The mission of the clergy was to keep internal peace. "The black army of the priests was to guarantee the internal peace, as the white army of soldiers was to safeguard against foreign aggression."37 Napoleon's attempted religious settlement was permeated through and through by this attitude of opportunism. His attitude toward religion was politically motivated. He at- tended mass essentially to honor his gendarmerie. III. Napoleon 's Solution to the Church-State Problem Effort toward reconciling church and state had started back in 1796 and, in 1799, the new first consul arranged for the honorable reburial of the remains of Pius VI. He used the occasion for political propaganda and to bring about the election of a pope favorable to France.38 Meanwhile, Napoleon had achieved considerable political stability through his victory at Marengo, and was anxiously awaiting Cardinal Chiariamomi, now Pius VII, to arrive in Rome so that they could negotiate. The pope appointed Cardinal Consalvi as secretary of state and the stage was set for the 1801 Concordat. There is an interesting parallel between this Concordat and its predecessor of 1516. "But Rome had negotiated the Con- cordat of 1516 with a Catholic monarch at the head of a solidly confessional state: the new Concordat was a result of barter between two strange powers linked by no spiritual bond."39 This was to be reflected in the terms, tenor, and results of this tenuous agreement. The Concordat sanctioned the sale of ecclesiastical properties, called for the reapportionment of dioceses, demanded the resignation of the whole French episcopate, and mandated the recognition of a new constitutional clergy to be nominated by Napoleon, installed by the pope, and paid by the state. (See the Appendix for the full text of the Concordat.) The French people rejoiced at the</page><page sequence="6">122 SUMMER 1991, VOLUME 66, NUMBER 3 prospect of religious peace, whereas in Rome the immoderate concessions of Pius VII were mocked.40 The old revolutionaries under Napoleon, too, were furious at the Concordat, and Napoleon had to fight to get the Concordat accepted, for the old revolutionaries had solid positions in the assemblies of the Consulate, espe- cially in the Tribunal.41 The Constitutional bishops never retracted their oath of allegiance; and , to the pope's dismay, though they had all resigned to conform to the bull "7am Multa," requiring the resignation of all bishops, 11 of them were reappointed by Napoleon. Furthermore, Napoleon added the Organic Articles that limited communication between the French clergy and Rome, assured control of the lower clergy through appointed bishops, and granted recognition to Protestants who had been like second-class citizens ever since the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in the last century.42 This pacified the French liberals. Meanwhile, Napo- leon had annexed the Italian Republic, in which Consalvi was able to renegotiate a more favorable Concordat in 1803. However, these terms were soon disregarded by Napoleon in his usual arbitrary manner. He changed the name of the Cisalpine Republic to Italian Republic, interfering in the internal affairs of the new Republic through his vice president, Melzi D'Eril.43 By 1804, the year of the Civil Code and his self-coronation in Paris, Napoleon was busily secularizing the French constitution. The first book of the code dealt with the enjoyment of civil rights, the protection of personality, domicile, guardi- anship, tutorship and curateship, relations of parents and children, marriage, personal relations of spouses, and the dissolution of marriage by annulment or divorce. Freedom of divorce, which prevailed during the revolution, was substan- tially limited by the code, however, and became available only on certain specific grounds.44 The emperor of the French henceforth used his consecration by the pope for spiritual leverage. He thought in terms of a constitutional monarch and arro- gated to himself prerogatives similar to the divine rights of kings. "My crown proceeds from God," he said, "and from the will of the people, and only to God and my people am I answerable for it."45 Despite Napoleon's absolutism, Pius, too, asserted spiritual authority by insisting that Napoleon and Josephine receive the sacrament of marriage before their consecration. Cardinal Fesch, the uncle of Napoleon, officiated the ceremony. The pope was frustrated when, instead of being given Italy by Napoleon, as he expected, Napoleon asked that the pope crown him king of Italy. Ironically, while Napoleon was being crowned in Milan by the French archbishop, Pius was quietly increasing his popularity in southern France. Napoleon reached the pinnacle of his spiritual pretensions when he instituted the Imperial Catechism in 1806, whereby he claimed to be the Supreme Representa- tive of God on Earth, obviously usurping papal authority. To serve the emperor is tantamount to serving God himself!46 From that year on, the feast of the Assump- tion of Mary was replaced by that of Saint Napoleon! It seemed that, at long last, Napoleon had realized his dream of reconciling the spiritual and the temporal.47 While virtually remaining the spiritual head of the French Church and leading the majority of the French Catholics, the pope was expected to be subservient to the emperor and confirm his (Napoleon's) appointment of bishops. All members of the clergy were now civil servants to be ordained only with the authorization of the state which paid them a salary. A peaceful coexistence seemed to reign between the two former rival factions and the church appeared to be injected with fresh vigor. It</page><page sequence="7">INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE REVIEW 123 would appear that the bitter divisions among the French clergy were being healed, enabling the emperor to incorporate the Rhenish Catholics and the fiercely Ultra- montane Belgians into the French frontiers and prepare the path for French hegemony in Italy.48 Could the Napoleon who bullied the pope, who was so absolute and arbitrary in both lay and religious matters, who had insisted that the liberties of the Gallican Church be professed because he is the one who wields the sword,49 maintain the integrity of his empire and the stability of the religious settlement, and disprove the adage according to which absolute power corrupts absolutely? IV. The Breakdown of Church and State Relations The first test of the viability of the religious settlement came with the annulment of Jerome's marriage, which Napoleon wanted his brother to obtain for purely political reasons. Napoleon wanted the papal sanction.50 Jerome had been duly married by the Catholic bishop of Baltimore, so the pope could not comply with Napoleon's injunction without jeopardizing his spiritual mandate. For strategic reasons, Napoleon invaded Ancona in 1806. Italy was parceled out to become fiefs of the empire. Then, in 1809, Pius flatly refiised to become a vassal of the emperor, and rejected the 2,000,000 francs offered him for his support, since Rome was now occupied. Instead, Pius issued the "Quum Memo- randa ," excommunicating all who had committed sacrilege by invading the Holy See. Napoleon promptly had Pius imprisoned, imposed severe limitations on papal government, and firmly asserted the separation of church and state. The cardinals that formed the Sacred College were brought to Paris. For dynastic and political reasons, what he called "le bien de l'Etat," Napoleon had the Senate dissolve his marriage to Josephine in order that he might marry Marie-Louise, daughter of Francis I of Austria. Napoleon wanted to secure the hereditary succes- sion and Josephine had failed to give the emperor an heir. So the witnesses of the 1804 marriage were enjoined to declare in court that they have never been wit- nesses.51 The pope was outraged that Francis should grant his daughter to an excommunicated and duly married man. Determined that his marriage be sanc- tioned by the church, Napoleon expelled the 13 cardinals who, invoking the bigamy of the emperor, refused to attend the ceremony. Further, he saw a historical precedent in King Henry VID of England and vowed to change the religion of Europe by changing the religion of France.52 Believing he could do without the pope, he had recourse to Ecclesiastical Councils. To his annoyance, the prelates declared allegiance to the pope. So Napoleon bullied a delegation into extracting the pope's consent to the metropolitan institution of bishops. He then rejected the agreement they signed because it did not cover the investiture in Italy and it alluded to Rome as the "Mother Church." The pope would sign nothing further; so, in 1812, Napoleon abrogated the 1801 Concordat and had the pope removed to Fontainebleau. However, with his defeat in Russia, Napoleon was pressed into seeking support again. He cajoled the pontiff into signing the Fontainebleau Concordat whereby the pope would exercise his office in France and Italy, maintain diplomatic repre- sentation, and recognize the competence of the councils to institute bishops if the</page><page sequence="8">124 SUMMER 1991, VOLUME 66, NUMBER 3 pope failed to do do within six months. The pope would, however, have the exclusive right to nominate six suburbicarian sees and titular sees. Dioceses would be reduced in number in Hiscany, Genoa, Holland, and the Hanseatic depart- ments. The Congregation for the Propagation of Faith, the Sacred Penitentiary, and papal archives were to be established. The pope's agent would administer papal domains that had not been alienated and the pope would receive compensa- tion of approximately 2,000,000 francs a year.53 Consalvi and other surviving cardinals of the Sacred College visited Pius and the troubled pope repudiated the Fontainebleau Concordat (May 24, 1813). 54 The defeat of Napoleon at Leipzig that same year saved the "black" cardinals from a grim fate. The pope was liberated by Austrian forces and returned to Rome in 1814. Is it ironical that three years later, the same Pius pleaded for the clement treatment of the exiled Bonaparte? Conclusion Napoleon inherited the problem of determining the place of religion and the role of its representatives in the proper running of the country. He believed that religion was useful to society but should be subservient to the state. This policy was embodied particularly in the 1801 Concordat, which declared Catholicism the religion of the French majority and transformed the clergy into paid civil servants. However, Bonaparte never succeeded in completely reducing the church into a servant role. He failed due to lack of insight into the forces he was contending with. He thought he could override the pope through councils. His policy, logical and consistent within his own political frame of reference, did not come up so much against the personality of the pope as against the spiritual values the pope and his church stood for. Certainly, Napoleon was at times concerned for the welfare of others; but he had misplaced priorities: he had France and the world revolve around himself. Yet, he never fully qualified for the position of spiritual head; rather, he had usurped it, be it on the occasion of his coronation or when he instituted the Imperial Catechism. Political expedience overruled moral values as evidenced in his position on divorce and remarriage. To Napoleon, religion was always a means, and he never contemplated observ- ing the practices of the church, despite his deathbed claim of dying in the Catholic faith. His real ambition was to reconstruct the unity of the spiritual and temporal values either in himself or between himself and the pope. This he never did. But his religious policy did emancipate Protestants to an equal status with Catholics and the 1801 Concordat contained principles workable enough for France to keep for the next 100 years. Further, most of the rampant abuses of the Ancien Regime were removed. Members of the lower clergy had greater security and tenure. However, harmonious and fruitful church and state relations, as well as the main goal of Napoleon, which was to control the spiritual impulse of the people through political means, remained as elusive as ever.

It was ratified at Rome by the pope in the bull Ecclesia Christi of August 15, 1801, and at Paris by the first consul on September 10 following. It was recorded as a law of the state on April 8, 1802, and solemnly published on Easter Day, April 17. The following is the text: "Convention between the French government and His Holiness Pius VII. The Government of the Republic recognizes that the Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman religion is the religion of the great majority of the French citizens. His Holiness equally recognizes that this same religion has derived, and derives at the present time, the greatest good and the greatest glory from the establishment of Catholic worship in France, and from the personal profession of it by the Consuls of the Republic. Consequently, following this mutual recognition, as much for the good of religion as for the maintenance of internal tranquillity, they have agreed as follows: "Article 1. The Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman religion shall be freely exer- cised in France; its worship shall be public, conforming itself with the police regulations which the Government shall judge necessary for public tranquillity. "Article 2. The Holy See, in concert with the Government, shall make a new circumscription of the French dioceses. "Article 3. His Holiness shall declare to those holding French bishoprics that he expects from them in firm confidence, for the sake of peace and unity, every kind of sacrifice, even that of their Sees. After this exhortation, if they refuse this sacrifice commanded for the benefit of the Church (a refusal, however, which His Holiness does not expect), provision shall be made for the appointment of new officials to govern these newly divided bishoprics in the following manner. "Article 4. The First Consul of the Republic shall nominate, within three months from the publication of the bull of His Holiness, to the archbishoprics and bishoprics under the new arrangement. His Holiness shall confer the canonical institutions, according to the forms established by agreement with France before the change of government. "Article 5. Nominations to bishoprics which shall be vacant immediately shall likewise be made by the First Consul, and canonical institution shall be given by the Holy See in conformity with the preceding article. "Article 6. The bishops, before entering upon their duties, shall take directly at the hands of the First Consul the oath of fidelity which was in use before the change of government, expressed in the following terms: 'I swear and promise to God, on the Holy Gospels, to be obedient and faithful to the Government estab- lished by the constitution of the French Republic. I promise also to have no dealings, to be present at no council, to belong to no league, whether at home or abroad, which may be contrary to public peace; and if, in my diocese or else- where, I learn that anything is being plotted to the prejudice of the State, I will make it known to the Government.' "Article 7. The ecclesiastics of the second order shall take the same oath at the hands of the civil authorities named by the Government. "Article 8. The following form of prayer shall be recited at the end of the Mass, in all the churches of France: ''Domine salvan fac Republicam; Domine, salvos fac Consultes. ' "Article 9. The bishops shall make a new circumscription of the parishes of</page><page sequence="10">126 SUMMER 1991, VOLUME 66, NUMBER 3 their dioceses which shall have no effect without the consent of the Government. "Article 10. The bishops shall nominate to the curacies. Their choice shall fell only upon persons acceptable to the Government. "Article 11. The bishops may have a Chapter in their Cathedral, and a Semi- nary for their diocese, but the Government shall not be obligated to endow them. "Article 12. All churches, metropolitan, cathedral, parish, and others not secularized, necessary for worship, shall be placed at the disposal of the bishops. "Article 13. His Holiness, for the sake of peace and the happy re-establishment of the Church religion, declares that neither he nor his successors shall in any way trouble those who have acquired alienated ecclesiastical property; and that conse- quently the possession of this same property, and the rights and revenues attached to it, shall remain unchanged in their hands or in those of their assignees. "Article 14. The Government shall guarantee an adequate salary to the bishops and clergy whose dioceses and parishes shall be included in the new division. "Article 15. The Government shall at the same time take measures to enable French Catholics, if they wish, to endow churches. "Article 16. His Holiness recognizes in the First Consul of the Republic the same rights and prerogatives as the old Government enjoyed. "Article 17. It is agreed between the contracting parties that in case anyone of the successors of the First Consul now acting should not be a Catholic, the rights and prerogatives mentioned in the article above, and the nomination to bishoprics, shall be regulated, with respect to him, by a fresh convention." ♦Reproduced from James Hastings, editor, Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, New York: Scribner's, Volume 3, 1924, pp. 803-804.
