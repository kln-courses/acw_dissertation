Sigei Educational Testing Service This essay is a presentation of continuities and discontinuities in the field of de velopmental psychology between 1970 and the beginning of the 1980s. The discussion is limited to areas of cognition and learning. Three major theoretical trends are identified: (a) Piagetian, (b) behavioristic, and (c) information-pro cessing. The field is perceived as fragmented, and the expectation is that such a state of affairs will continue because of the world hypothesis (metaphor) from which researchers work. Analyses of the current state of affairs in the field are also discussed because of a tendency for an ahistorical perspective to prevail. Future trends, based on current new directions in the field of cognition and learning, are addressed. My aim is to present a perspective on trends and concerns relative to the field of child development during the 1970s and to identify the nascent directions that seem to be emerging in the 1980s. In a sense, the discussion will have a developmental flavor since I use the continuity-discontinuity paradigm to frame my com ments. But before proceeding to substantive issues, a word about my perspective. Fields of knowledge are arbitrarily categorized and labeled. Es sentially, this is a problem in taxonomy. Taxonomies, when used in botany or zoology, for example, are often based on identifiable char acteristics which provide the necessary and sufficient attributes to differentiate species and genus, thereby yielding discrete classes. Developmental psychology has no discernible physical features by which to define it. Thus, in organizing such a field, criteria must be The author thanks Richard Gallagher for his constructive comments, Betty Clau sen for her typing, and Linda Kozelski for her bibliographic and editorial assistance, on this paper.

Since such inventions emerge from the reality construction of the inventor, substantive variations can emerge. So, too, in the context of developmental psychology, I have invented and organized my own reality of cognition and learning. To identify continuities and discontinuities in child develop ment first requires a definition of the field. The two critical terms child and development themselves pose definitional problems, with the growing trend toward eschewing the term child, which is an age-based concept, and emphasizing the term development, which is not necessarily defined by age. Development is the core construct, but differences exist as to how to conceptualize it. Indeed, while reviewing the field of developmental psychology over the past decade, I was impressed with the persistent variations in the use of the term development. In spite of a growing interest in so-called "developmental" questions, with the attendant increase in personnel and resources, clarification of the concept is no more evi dent in 1981 than it was 10 years ago. For biologically-oriented stu dents of human behavior (psychologists, in particular), development is similar to the biological concepts of maturation and growth. For psychologists who use an environmental behavioristic learning model, development is change in quantity of acquired experience. In recent years, with the re-emergence of Piaget and subsequent cognitive orientation, the model of development involves change, not as a function of accumulated experiences, but characterized as qualitative, maturational, sequential, irreversible, transformational, and end-state oriented (Overton &amp; Reese, 1981; Piaget, 1950; Wohl will, 1980). These approaches, while not specifying the segments of life involved, tend to limit their interests to childhood and adoles cence. Piaget, for example, does not extend his developmental con cerns beyond adolescence, where the end state of formal opera tional thought is established (Piaget, 1970). Adding to the proliferation of concepts and perspectives of development is the emerging orientation toward life-span develop ment. The exponents of this perspective refer to life-span develop ment not as a theory, but as an orientation to the study of behavioral development (Baltes, Reese, &amp; Lipsitt, 1980). Specifically: Life-span developmental psychology is concerned with the description, explanation, and modification (optimization) of developmental processes in the human life course from conception to death. Like other develop mental specialities such as child development or gerontology, life-span developmental psychology is not a theory but an orientation. ... [A] de velopmental orientation is needed whenever the behavior identified in</page><page sequence="3">Childhood Development Research 349 volves a change process and is better understood if placed in the context of chains and patterns of antecedent and subsequent events. (Baltes et al., 1980, p. 66) There seems to be the need to advocate increased specializa tion; otherwise, why add the term life-span to the broad concept of developmental psychology? The rationale for adding life-span, aside from avowedly rejecting the traditional view that developmental psychology is defined in an age-grade normative perspective, is to advocate investigation of new questions. The growing interest in life-span questions, e.g., intergenerational differences, and multi linear and discontinuities over a wide spectrum of ages, suggests a growing interest in moving beyond childhood and adolescence to answer questions regarding the human condition. Masters (1981) provides a clear statement of what developmental psychology is: In sum, developmental psychology can best be characterized as: a micro cosm of psychology in general. Most, if not all, the subareas within psy chology are represented within developmental psychology, usually by their typical labels with the qualifier "developmental" appended initially. Thus, there is developmental: behavioral genetics, cognitive, social, per sonality and language, and so on. Each of these specialties has become reasonably complex and encompasses a large literature of contemporary theory and research that would require its own individual review to pro vide any degree of depth. (Pp. 117-118) In view of the diversity of the field of developmental psychology, and some of the crucial definitional issues raised in the foregoing remarks, therefore, my reflection on child development research over the last decade is limited to continuities and discontinuities in learning and cognition. During the past decade (1970-1980) theoretical and empirical activity dealing with the development of learning and cognition has been explosive. The outpouring of books, journal articles, confer ences, etc., reflects the proliferation of conceptual models and the advances and refinements in methodology extending the ranges of study. The result of this effort is the production of a large and exten sive body of literature. While I have not made a statistical count of the growth trends mentioned above, my informal survey of the Annual Review of Psychology, as well as my learning that the proj ected edition of Carmichael's Manual of Child Psychology will be four volumes (a 100% increase from its 1970 edition of two volumes), attests to the knowledge explosion in the field of developmental psychology. Not all these increments in knowledge production have focused on the development of learning and cognition. But the interests in</page><page sequence="4">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY cognitive development and correlated areas (e.g., development of language, social cognition) justifies defining the past decade as "The Period of the Cognitive Revolution." As some of these develop ments are described, it will become clear that the "cognitive" take over has been profound, influencing the thinking of investigators who 20 or even 10 years ago would have eschewed the "cognitive" construct. My reflection on this period is not only in terms of the changes that have taken place in conceptualizations, methods, and problems of study, but also on what seems to guide these dramatic shifts in paradigms, conceptualizations, and methodologies. Learning and cognition will be discussed as interrelated psycho logical functions. Learning, a traditional psychological area of inter est, has been treated as a subject of study in its own right (Reese, 1976). Cognition, in this context, denotes a higher mental process, such as reasoning, judgment, thinking, or problem solving. The defi nition of learning and its relationship to cognitive development var ies as a function of one's conceptual framework. Thus, for the behav ior-oriented psychologist, defining learning in terms of acquisition is traditional. For the Piagetian, learning is defined in a assimilation accommodation model, eschewing associationist concepts of the traditional behaviorist approach. (See Gallagher &amp; Reid, 1981, for a detailed discussion of Piagetian "learning theory.") In sum, then, learning and cognition are conceptualized differently, depending on the theoretical orientation of the investigator. MAJOR THEORETICAL ORIENTATIONS OF COGNITION AND LEARNING During the 1970s the study of development of learning and cog nition was vigorous, resulting in an explosion of publications stem ming from different conceptual models. While proliferation in re search paradigms became evident, they were essentially of three types: (a) those that were structural types, influenced by Piaget; (b) those that were more functional in nature, within a behavioristic tradition; and (c) those that used the process approach, as in infor mation processing. Each of these approaches employed different re search paradigms and studied different problems. The Structuralists By 1980, virtually all developmental psychologists were cogni zant of the seminal work of Piaget (1970). His theory is structuralistic in orientation, providing detailed descriptions of changes in cogni</page><page sequence="5">Childhood Development Research 351 tive structure that denote the developmental changes from infancy to adolescence. While the theory acknowledges the significance of social and cultural factors influencing the course of cognitive devel opment (Piaget &amp; Inhelder, 1969), it does not detail the characteris tics of the environment that influence the course of developmental, structural change. There is an invariance, nevertheless, in the pro posed direction of development eventuating in the individual's cap ability to engage in logical-mathematical thought. Thus, Piaget de scribes how the individual comes to know, and, concomitantly, Piaget identifies the "operations" or processes that the individual employs in the accumulation and organization of knowledge. While essentially a structural theory, Piaget's delineation of cog nitive operations defines the processes available to the individual, given certain structural stages, thereby providing the functional as pects. Nevertheless, the Genevan theory is often identified as a structural approach (Beilin, Note 1). Transition from stage to stage for Piaget is not only a function of maturation and experience, but, most importantly, equilibrationâa core concept in Piaget's developmental model. Equilibration is a "central process . . . leading from certain states of equilibrium to others qualitatively different, passing through multiple non-balances and re-equilibrations" (Piaget, 1977, p. 3). Piaget's work was not without its critics, varying from the vocif erous, e.g., Siegal and Brainerd (1978) and Rotman (1977), to those who attempted to modify his position by tightening and ordering various conceptualizations, e.g., Pascual-Leone, Goodman, Ammon, and Subelman (1978). While many of these theories focus on pre school children, there are indications that a structural approach can be used even with infants (Langer, 1980). Consistent with the in creasing interest in infancy behavior and development, Langer (1980) describes the ontogenesis of logic in working with infants from 6 to 12 months of age. The influence of Piaget and Werner, as well as Pi aget's own original approach, is evident in Langer's study. He argues that logical thinking can be studied prior to the development of a symbol system. Langer's is a significant study, reflecting continuity with the trends in a structural approach to cognitive development, bufbeginning in infancy. One of the major new thrusts, a direct outgrowth of Genevan theory,1 is the area of social cognition, an approach that moves away from the "physical" cognitive orientation of Piaget to that of social 1. The term Genevan will be used interchangeably with Piaget, Piagetian. It seems to be becoming the general term (Gallagher &amp; Reid, 1981).</page><page sequence="6">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY and personal awareness. The search has begun to identify the cogni tive, structural, and developmental features that play a role in the child's coming to know and to understand himself in the context of his social world. Off to a slow start in the 1970s, but stimulated by Shantz's (1975) organization of the literature, the field blossomed and, to all indications, continues to burgeon (Bearison, in press). As in so many areas of psychology, the field of social cognition prolifer ated and a host of areas heretofore of minimal interest bloomed, e.g., understanding of social rules (Shantz, in press), moral judgment and moral education (Kohlberg &amp; Turiel, 1971), revisionism in moral development (Tomlinson, 1980), social developmental theory of in terpersonal relations (Youniss, 1980), understanding of social con ventions (Turiel, 1974), and children's understanding of society (Furth, 1979, 1980). These are illustrative of the diversity of research interests that have emerged from the 1970s. Piaget, ironically, addressed almost all of these questions in his 60-year career. (See Gruber &amp; VonÃ¨che, 1980, for a lengthy and var ied bibliography.) Indeed, Piaget's cognitive developmental stage dependent theory was the major intellectual force, directly or indi rectly, generating the cognitive revolution. The cognitive revolution also influenced those who heretofore tended to eschew such mentalistic concepts as cognition and mental operations. Behavior-oriented psychologists have begun to incor porate cognitive concepts as explanatory in their developmental studies. The work of T. Kendler (1979) is but one example of behav iorist perspectives. The Behaviorists Notable among the functional approach within a behaviorist type of model, T. Kendler has provided an excellent summary of her current theoretical position (T. Kendler, 1979). The Kendlers have developed a task, reversible shift, a type of research paradigm to study discrimination learning. (H. Kendler has been a long-term partner in this research.) The Kendlers's interest is in the ontogene sis of discrimination learning. As a result of a series of clever experi ments and reinterpretations of earlier data, they arrived at a two level theory of discrimination learning: The theory assumes a hypothetical, central process that contains two ma jor components; an encoding component that analyzes, integrates, and stores the incoming information and a behavior-regulation component that initiates, monitors, and regulates behavioral output. The structures underlying the two components are organized into two levels that ma ture at different rates (Kendler, 1979, p. 115).</page><page sequence="7">Childhood Development Research Initially, the young child employs nonselective encoding (implying a relatively passive response to stimuli) and later develops a "cogni tive" hypothesis testing mode. Where the earlier mode is associa tive, since in this mode regulation is incremental and the knowledge so acquired is used to evoke approach or avoidance behaviors, the cognitive level is one in which "information provided by the rein forcement contingencies" (p. 112) is used to test the rules or strate gies that result in correct solutions. Thus, T. Kendler provides a learning model which, while initially interpreting the results on the basis of the initial component (asso ciative), was revised to incorporate a concept of a more active, in deed willful, subject. The assumption is that prior to Level 2, discrim ination learning from infancy onward to the cognitive level, children's learning can be characterized as associative. There is need, of course, to incorporate learning processes of infancy if one is to consider the theory as dealing with ontogenesis. Over the 10-year span, major conceptual changes were re ported in the Kendler model (1979), and the end is not in sight among behavorists. Of particular interest, of course, is T. Kendler's invoking internal mental activities. Although hesitant to use mental istic constructs, as indicated by her quotes around the term cognitive, T. Kendler found it necessary to employ mental con structs in her theorizing about the ontogenesis of learning. The cognitive approach has also influenced social learning theorists (e.g., Bandura, 1978). Bandura, perhaps the leading social learning theorist, reflects the significance of cognition when he as serts that "cognitive factors partly determine which external events will be observed, how they will be perceived, whether they have any lasting effects, what valence and efficacy they have, and how the in formation they convey will be organized for future use" (Bandura, 1978, p. 345). Other social learning theorists have incorporated cog nitive constructs into their system (Zimmerman, 1981). In fact, these theoretical perspectives have elaborated the role of cognitive pro cesses as mediating behavior. These shifts in conceptualization appear dramatic. But they are less dramatic in the sense of discontinuity with previous learning theory than the current developments in information processing. Information Processing Information processing has become one of the increasingly popular models for the study of cognitive development in young children. Essentially, the information, as applied to children, is the</page><page sequence="8">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY adaptation of an approach developed with adults. The work of Klahr and Wallace (1976) and Siegler (1978) are excellent examples of the application of information processing paradigms to the study of cog nition in children. Klahr and Wallace (1976) state that their perspective: represents an attempt to apply the theoretical and methodological ap proach of Allan Newell and Herbert Simon (1972) to the complex prob lems raised by empirical work in the Piagetian tradition. The general para digm is to formulate precise models of performance of the organism at two different levels of development, and then to formulate a model for the transition or developmental mechanisms. (Klahr &amp; Wallace, 1976, p. ix) Interestingly, Klahr and Wallace quote Simon (1962) who held that: If we can construct an information processing system with rules of behav ior that lead it to behave like the dynamic system we are trying to de scribe, then this system is a theory of the child at one stage of the devel opment. Having described a particular stage by a program, we would then face the task of discovering what additional information processing mechanisms are needed to simulate developmental changeâthe transi tion from one stage to the next. That is, we would need to discover how the system could modify its own structure. Thus, the theory would have two partsâa program to describe performance at a particular stage and a learning program governing the transitions from stage to stage. [Simon, 1962, pp. 154-155; quoted in Klahr &amp; Wallace, 1976, p. ix] The comments of Newell and Simon are indeed reminiscent of the problems addressed by Piaget. The convergence between Piaget and Siegler is striking also. Siegler investigated some of the same questions posed by Inhelder and Piaget (1964) in his quest to understand the development of sci entific reasoning. In fact, Siegler asks an epistemologica! question: "What do younger children not have (or what do they not know) that older children do have (or know) and that is necessary to learn?" (Siegler, 1978, p. 118). Using a variety of tasks (e.g., probability, bal ance scale, projection of shadows) modeled after those of Piaget and Inhelder (1975), Siegler set out to study rule-governed behavior in preschool children. He reports that "improved encoding contrib utes to improved ability to learn, which in turn contributes to an im proved level of existing knowledge" (Siegler, 1978, p. 144). Further, with theoretical perspective of Siegler reveals some convergence with Piaget in spite of paradigmatic differences: The model of development is similar to Piaget's model of assimilation/ accommodation but differs in two important ways. First, there is a strong distinction in the present model between what children know and what they can learn. For example, improved encoding is thought to contribute</page><page sequence="9">Childhood Development Research directly to children's ability to learn but only indirectly to their existing knowledge. Second, within the present model all components are inde pendently measurable. Being able to measure the explanatory construct âencodingâin particular offers a number of advantages. At a theoretical level, it helps us escape the circularity that is inevitable when we explain behavior in terms of constructs that have no observable basis except the behavior they are said to explain. At the psychometric level, it can help us predict exactly who is ready to benefit from new experience and who is not. (Siegler, 1978, p. 144) While Siegler shared some of Inhelder and Piaget's tasks and concepts, Pascual-Leone is working on an integration of the infor mation processing model with Piagetian theory. In a recent article, Pascual-Leone (1978) says that "We will claim that psychological theories . . . must be process structural; a causal account of the pro cesses of equilibration and the manifestation of general stages must include an explicit representation of the step-by-step temporal functioning of the developing system" (Pascual-Leone, Goodman, Ammon, &amp; Subelman, 1978, p. 244). Pascual-Leone et al. integrate in a complex theory the structural notions of Piaget, incorporating en coding operations which resemble the concepts of information pro cessing theory (Klahr &amp; Wallace, 1976), but integrated into a unique structural-process system. Other models of cognitive development were proposed during the 1970s, e.g., Gholson and Beilin's (1979) hypothesis testing model, Case's (1974) functional theory of intellectual development, Charles worth's (1976) ethological approach, and Sternberg's (1977) analogi cal reasoning model (in the information processing mode), to name but some. With the exception of Charlesworth's, all these ap proaches to cognitive development stem from Piaget's behavior theory and information processing concept. At this point, these ap proaches and their various spin-offs encompass the field. As for the degree to which they mutually influence each other, only time will tell. Discontinuity in Cognition and Learning Research Is Real At first glance, there are elements of novelty in the foregoing overview of models or conceptualizations of cognitive develop ment. Yet, the material presented above has not emerged de novo from a vacuous intellectual history. Indeed, significant for its histori cal antecedents is the reintroduction of the consciousness or self awareness motif in cognitive research, specifically in the area of metacognition, which refers to the child's becoming aware (self conscious) of him/herself as a learner, thinker, and problem-solver. Flavell has been a prime mover in this area of study (Flavell, 1977).</page><page sequence="10">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY What is a particular interest in metacognition literature is that the basic meta concept implies an awareness of one's processes in per forming particular acts, has been introduced into such studies as those of memory, language, psychological theory. Thus, metamem ory, metalanguage, and metatheory are becoming increasingly prev alent. Clearly, psychologists have not resolved how to cope with the reality that we (including investigators) are "aware" beings, and to some degree, know how we do and can act. Further, there is evi dence that we are aware of how to control our behavior (e.g., Mis chel, 1979), to dissemble, or to reorient our behavior, signifying a re turn to the old issue of consciousness and a return to issues related to psychic determinism or freedom of choice, but conducted in a more "scientific" way. Another "new" discovery is the important role the family plays in influencing cognitive development (Marjoribanks, 1979; Mc Gillicuddy-DeLisi, in press; Sigel, in press). Ironically, most of this re search continues to focus on families of preschool children, just as in the 1950s and 1960s. Few studies deal with school-aged or adoles cent children (Sigel, Dreyer, &amp; McGillicuddy-DeLisi, in press; Youn iss, 1980). A body of research in the past has been primarily con cerned with mothers (the psychologists' view of the family), but now researchers are discovering the significance of other family mem bers, e.g., the father (Lamb, 1975; Lewis &amp; Weinraub, 1976; Parke, 1979), and siblings (Cicerelli, 1977). Within the research genre of families, the new discovery is that the study of infants in the family context will be enlightening for the ontogenesis of cognitive development. Not only has the family come into its own as an arena for re search, but the broader environment has assumed a larger place in current research activity. The "field" or environment which has been integral to the thinking of such Gestalt psychologists as Barker (1968), Koffka (1924), and Lewin (1936) is now receiving increased at tention (Bronfenbrenner, 1979). In the early 1970s, with Piagetian influence dominant, little at tention was paid to the social context and cultural milieu in which the child developed; this was in spite of Piaget's assertion that social and cultural factors are important in development (Piaget &amp; In helder, 1969). However, this decontextualization of the child has shifted to interest in social contexts. Bronfenbrenner's (1979) "eco logical validity" concept, Nelsen and Gruendel's (1980) interest in children's memory of everyday experience, Sigel's (1970,1981) "dist ancing strategies," and Abelson's (1981) script theory, are instances of this renewed interest.</page><page sequence="11">Childhood Development Research 357 It seems clear that what we are studying currently in develop mental psychology has direct and indirect linkages to the past. Un fortunately, there is not always acknowledgment or even awareness of the history. At times we display a disrespectful orientation to past work. This lack, I believe, is due to not accepting the context in which work was done nor the potential stimulation that these early works could offer. The questions posed today are often similar, if not identical, to those in the past, e.g., how thought develops, and how early learning affects later performance. Often, old issues are being reconceptualized. For example, intellectual development, studied longitudinally in the Berkeley Growth Study, is now considered life span developmental psychology. Thus, I contend that our ahistorical bent is regrettable; it reduces the chances of our profiting from our own experience, and hence we waste a lot of time and energyâand money. On the more specific level, research that demonstrates the ef fects of social interaction in enhancing children's acquisition of con servation (Murray, 1972) has also proliferated. All of these new ap proaches provide increased systematization of issues and problems endemic to psychological study of cognitive development. Turning from social/environmental areas to the biological area, it is seen that interest in the genetics of intelligence (cognition) has surfaced. The heredity-environment issue was popular in the 1920s and 1930s, creating a considerable amount of controversyâwhich seemed resolved when it was acknowledged that heredity and envi ronment were significant and that the weighting issue was irrelevant. Yet Jensen's article in the Harvard Educational Review reopened a series of political and social arguments regarding inheritability of in telligence (Jensen, 1969). (The issue became heated because of the racial overtones of Jensen's argument.) But, at the same time, re search by genetically-oriented psychologists at the University of Colorado has made significant strides in investigating the effects of heredity in intelligence in a more objective and less provocative arena, e.g., family resemblances, and adoption studies without racial overtones (Plomin &amp; DeFries, 1980). However, in spite of these con siderable efforts, Plomin and DeFries have not attended sufficiently to the particulars of the family environment, thus not resolving the problems of the relative significance of heredity or environment. Sigel (in press) has shown that parents who interact with their chil dren and use inquiry strategies (a type of distancing) have a signifi cant impact on their children's representational competence. Thus, while Plomin and DeFries may be correct in regarding the role of in heritance in intellectual development, it is still necessary to incorpo</page><page sequence="12">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY rate parental teaching strategies which may be among the critical factors affecting intellectual development. The type of research described above had its roots in definable antecedents, suggesting that there is continuity, but it appears to be cyclic, or perhaps a U-shaped, function. Whenever a research inter est becomes popular, it then recedes and later resurfaces with a new name and a new set of methods. Or perhaps it is a spiral effect, just as in human developmentâthe process is one of differentiation and hierarchical integration. The reasons for this shift in focus and em phasis may be due to social-historical reasons, e.g., the advent of in creased technical know-how (statistical analysis or computer tech nologies, for example). Perhaps the rapidly changing social scene has contributed to the potential of behavioral science as a repository of usable knowledge. Or perhaps the belief still prevails that science and technology, with all their expertise, can provide strategies for solving social problems. On the other hand, it is likely that particular research leads have been exhausted temporarily and that with new insights revitalization occurs. A good example may be the fact that research in such motivational systems as dependency, aggression, and achievement decreased in the late 1960s and early 1970s and was "overthrown" by the cognitive revolution. However, recent interest in children's coping with interpersonal aggression is being studied with strong cognitive focus (e.g., D. Shantz and C. Shantz). They bring together the motivational elements (aggression) with cognition (social rule learning) studied in a group context. Three traditions are incorporated in her effort: (a) group dynamics, (b) motivational sys tems, and (c) cognitive systems. It is how these data are conceptual ized that will reflect a new synthesis (e.g., Shantz, in press). It would be an interesting and informative exercise to uncover the basis for our field's periods of differentiation, disequilibrium, and re equilibration into new structures. REASONS FOR FRAGMENTATION IN COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH Developmental psychology will continue to be a fragmented field, in spite of the efforts at integration proposed, for example, by Fowler (1980). While fragmentation refers to different units or cate gories of knowledge, varying from epoch to epoch, it should not be confused with discontinuity. Rather, fragmentation refers to the cat egories by which areas in a field are identified and reorganized. Thus, for example, there are the cognitivists, the social learning theorists, and the information processors. Individuals identified with</page><page sequence="13">Childhood Development Research each of these or other areas are, in fact, specialists, not necessarily knowing or perhaps even seeing any relevance of others' work for their own. The best evidence is any American Psychological Associa tion convention program. Such specialization will continue even if efforts at communication, integration, or synthesis persist. Diverse Roots of Psychology Psychology as a science of human behavior has a number of roots that reflect different philosophical and intellectual traditions. Mueller (1979) reports on the beginnings of psychology, from the experimental approach of Wundt, Sherrington, and Thorndike, to the clinical work of Claparede, Freud, Jung, and Adler, to name but some. As he shows, little effort was made thenâor is made nowâto integrate the various perspectives, although at times each of the writers touched on a topic common to different approaches, e.g., Freud wrote on thought processes, as did Thorndike. Some efforts were made in more recent times to relate psychoanalytic theory to learning (Sears, Note 2), an effort that has gone by the boards in the 1980s. Thus, although there are efforts at searching for a unified theory, I cannot be optimistic about such an effort for the field as a whole. Diversity on Developmental Psychology Mueller's comments about the field of psychology are relevant for developmental psychology in two ways: (a) developmental psy chology is not unique, but a sub-set of psychology, and (b) develop mental psychology is beset by an ah/'sfor/ca/orientation. I agree with Pepper (1942) that models of human development derive from the world hypotheses of the investigator. Pepper calls these root metaphors that are used as constructions of reality. Among the metaphors that Pepper identifies are (a) mechanism, (b) organicism, and (c) contextualism. Each of these is expressed in mod els of development currently in vogue. The mechanism metaphor construes the human organism as analogous to a machine, wherein forces which influence human behavior are mechanical in nature. (The Freudian model is a case in point.) The organicism metaphor construes the individual as an integrated system, wherein each com ponent influences each other component (Piaget, 1970). In contex tualism metaphor, behavior is influenced by an array of contextual and environmental factors (Bronfenbrenner, 1979). Each of these metaphors, according to Pepper, guides not only the theoretical for mulations, but also the methods used for study and its criteria for</page><page sequence="14">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY truth. The relevance of this type of analysis is that each of us works with some of these metaphors, not necessarily acknowledging that they are what guide our efforts. Tyler (1981) wrote an exposition of the relevance of Pepper's exegesis for psychology, claiming that in terest in Pepper's philosophical ideas is related to "increasing reali zation of the importance of metaphor in human thinking" (Tyler, 1981, p. 10). These perspectives are not just intellectual and rational prod ucts of the mind. They are deeply embedded in our affect system. While the maintenance of an individual's intellectual position may be well justified on some rational basis, these perspectives are main tained on an emotional level and thus are not easy to change even in the face of discrepant experience. Rokeach (1968), for example, goes even further than Pepper when he argues that there exist funda mental beliefs that are rooted in individual experience and are rein forced by social consensus. "Rokeach states it is upon these [fundamental beliefs] that other 'derived' beliefsâincluding social attitudes and opinionsâare based. He asserts that it is in the nature of primitive beliefs to persist unquestioned in most societies" (Mangan, 1978, p. 175). It may well be that intensity of one's commitment to a concep tual perspective is an integral part of one's professional self definition. After all, researchers invest considerable time, energy, and emotion in their work. It is easy to understand the reluctance and the resistance of investigators to change the questions under study, even when they appear to some as trivial, irrelevant, or dead end. After all, one person's trivia may be another person's profound activity. It can be argued that I am setting absolutistic standards for de termining when a change occurs. The point is that change for one person may be more dramatic than for another person. T. Kendler and Bandura are two investigators, for example, who have expanded, or in some way, altered their initial conceptions. In each case, but with a different emphasis, each has incorporated a cognitive con struct into her/his ongoing system. These are internal changes, and do not suggest a change in the fundamental set of assumptions with which they work. This type of modification is essentially what conti nuity in research efforts means. Investigators need not necessarily refuse to reject their initial conceptual frameworks. It is progressive to modify one's position on the basis of new findings, for, after all, that is what science is all about. But it is clear that such alterations are usually within, and not between, systems. A fundamental issue in this discussion of the bases for continued</page><page sequence="15">Childhood Development Research fragmentation in the field, not only in the 1970s, is endemic to the field as a whole, namely, the lack of attention to the historical ante cedents of our discipline. Developmental Psychology is Ahistorical The "continuities and discontinuities" of this article's subtitle make two basic assumptions: (a) that the field moves in a linear accel erating direction, which presumes vertical relationships between Time 1 and Time 2, and (b) that connections among events can be discerned, so that the end of some areas of interest drop out and new forms or contents emerge, suggesting reorganizations and transformations of ideas. For example, studies of memory are pres ented under a cognitive rubric instead of within a memory and learning framework. In essence, the subtitle reflects a developmen tal perspective, analogous to the development of the organism. So, our studies are aimed at understanding origins, forces, and condi tions which might shed light on the mysteries of human develop ment. By the same token, we search our professional souls to under stand how the field as a whole moves and perhaps develops. Thus, I apply the same strategies in examining the field as I might in investi gating a child's growth and development. A key interest among developmental psychologists is in origins âthe beginningsâbecause we continue to believe that the influ ence of previous experience affects later behavior (without as much evidence as we need here). Ironically, in our field, effects of early experience (analogous to the early research in our field) in the form of empirical or conventional wisdom, has had minimal influenceâ influencing what we do or how we do it. For example, authors of child biographies provide rich anecdotal information with consider able insight into development. Yet, they are not acknowledged as literal gold mines of knowledge. It would be interesting to find out how many professionals and students have actually read any of them. Two particularly instructive examples are derived from Navarra's (1955) study (reprinted 1973). He reviewed eighteenth and nine teenth century literature on cognitive development, citing the work of Tiedmann (1787): Tiedmann's criticism of the practice of binding a child's hands in swathings, which was a common practice in the 1780's, has analogous contemporary applications. His point is that if a child is given greater op portunity to explore, he will probably develop more extensive concep tions of himself and his environment at a much earlier age. Tiedmann re ports many instances in which he has observed visible signs of reflection "and intelligent adjustment on the part of the infant." He also saw the</page><page sequence="16">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY child's anthropomorphic interpretations as logical deduction: the child "always envisages an unknown thing through one that is known." (Na varra, 1973, pp. 3-4) Preyer, who is considered to be the founder of modern child psy chology, accepted the fact that, while individual differences in rate of development occurred, the sequence of development is the same for all children (Navarra, 1973). That Tiedmann, and even Preyer, did not generate a science of developmental psychology is not surprising in view of the lack of readiness to apply a "scientific" approach to psychological issues, particularly focusing on children, in the eighteenth, or even the nineteenth, century. This introduction of the scientific approach occurred in the early twentieth century, but from a different con ceptual framework (Watson, 1918). My point is not to regret that developmental psychology did not begin in the eighteenth century. Rather, my regret is that by ig noring what was done has resulted in a loss of a tradition and a re luctance to acknowledge actively our intellectual ancestors where appropriate (Sears, 1975). This lack of awareness is especially poign ant in Navarra's case. His little book (Navarra, 1973), originally pub lished in 1955, is relevant today. He observed a young boy for about two years, beginning when the child was 3 years old and continuing into the child's 6th year. Navarra provides an in-depth understand ing of how the child comes to know about his world. Yet why was his study "lost"? Why could it not have been a seminal piece of work from which experiments could be established? Navarra's book is loaded with hypotheses and insights into such areas as the child's ac tivities, developing sense of self, and the strategies used in problem solving. In 1981-82, we are still engrossed in the very problems that Navarra posed, but there are no efforts made at connecting, building upon, or even acknowledging his work. In reviewing the past 10 years, one gets a sense of a "knowledge explosion"âscattered in many and often disparate directions. From an Olympian perspective, however, one can identify a number of points of contact, at least heuristically, e.g., cognitive anthropology offers valuable insights into theory and method for the developmen talists, or studies in perception and cognition. Noting the relevance of such a discipline may sound like a plea for an interdisciplinary perspective, one that waxed and waned for at least 40 years, a perspective that was again emerging during the 1970s. But I am not referring here to the unity of science, a scientific ideology that was prevalent in the 1940s and 1950s, but rather to a sensitivity to, and identification of, the relevance of particular bodies of knowledge in</page><page sequence="17">Childhood Development Research other disciplines that have direct bearing on particular issues under study in cognitive development (Sigel, 1956). Some of the influence of interdisciplinary cooperation was already evident in the sensitivity of researchers working among minority groups. It may be more pro ductive, then, to work at interdisciplinary cooperation rather than to struggle to create great conceptual schemes. But the 1970s have been disappointing in basic ways. Not only has the field become highly fragmented and specialized, but it has not come to grips with a basic conceptual issue, namely, the devel opmental construct. Development, for me, is not simply age differ ences nor accretions from one time to another. Such an approach can lead to trivial, nonexplanatory statements, unless it is followed by explanatory studies. For example, one needs to know whether preschool children are less adept at solving conservation problems than are elementary-aged children, or that toddlers use shorter sen tences than do preschoolers. But, these should be followed by ex planatory studies, since we need to know why the differences occur. Or, put another way, we need to have an explanation of the change, and an identification of the processes involved in that change. While knowledge in all related fields has proliferated, it is not always easy to claim that proliferation is necessarily progress. How many more studies on conservation do we need? Part of the prob lem is intrinsic to our field. As we know, behavioral science involves very complex issues. I was made aware of this fact by a traveling com panion. I asked what kind of work he did. "Fusion physics," he said. "Very complex," I said. "What do you do," he asked. "I'm a develop mental psychologist," I responded. "Now, that is complicated. I do not envy you. My stuff is easy by comparison," was his reply. My first reaction was to scoff at his lack of comprehension. But, on further thought, I agreed with him. Why? As we all know, results of any study are contingent on the nature of the sample (race, ethnic group, culture, age, socioeconomic status, inherent nervous system, adequate psychological adjustment). To control, either through sample selection or statistics, is a major effort. To assume randomiza tion will solve the problem is begging the question. Since we are constantly working with an array of complex, uncontrollable, and unknown factors, how much more complex can our task be? A LOOK INTO THE 1980s In the 1980s, continuity will be evident, as will discontinuity. Taking a developmental perspective, and using the 1970s to prog</page><page sequence="18">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY nosticate the 1980s, development will probably continue to have some linkages with the past. These linkages will vary in strength. New areas will develop which will not be new in fact but in appear ance. Other new areas that lay dormant will be reintegrated into ongoing activity. Thus, the phenotype will appear discontinuous, but its genotype will, in fact, be continuous. Specifically, the influence of Piaget, while at times misdirected by American investigators, is still generating new issues and prob lems. A central one is still the determination of the developmental ordering of intelligence. There are doubts about the validity of stage theory, at least in Piagetian terms. That development involves change and that the human organism solves change is obvious. There is no need for verifying that. It is the why and how that are at issue. Models of transformation or accretion of the role and function the individual plays in defining and in determining his/her develop mental course are the biggest challenges to date. Embedded in this concern is the need to pay increased atten tion to the forces that interact with the person to influence the de velopmental course. An area of increasing interest is the role of the family, whether it be the nuclear family as we traditionally know it, or its various versions which are appearing on the horizon. Changes in family constellation will allow some natural experiments for evaluat ing the significance of mothers and fathers, because more single par ent families are available. Now, instead of the father-absent families, we can examine the mother-absent family. Indeed, various family combinations are possible in which to study the child's cognitive functioning. These new environmental changes will no doubt generate dif ferent rates or different quality of growth, revealing sources of indi vidual differences, which should be investigated. As we come to learn more about social factors influencing various aspects of behav ior, it will be possible to integrate this knowledge by focusing on particular sources of individual variation. For example, we have iden tified a class of parental strategies which have a causal relationship to preschool children's representational competence (Sigel, in press). Individual differences in cognitive performance were identified. But little is known of the history of these individuals to help explain indi vidual variation in performance.Our findings may well help explain individual differences among children in cognitive rule learning ex periments such as those reported by Siegler (1978). During the next decade, the approach to the study of cognition will move forward. Calling cognition a "cognitive science," as it is now being cited, is not just a change of labels, but rather foretells a</page><page sequence="19">Childhood Development Research change in categorization of cognition and the subsequent change in paradigms and materials. For example, Jean Mandler (1979), in de scribing her work on memory, classes it under the cognitive science rubric. What becomes apparent in Mandler's discussion of memory is the manifest convergence of ideas in cognition. Constructs such as "structure" and schema have a Piagetian ring to them, but such re semblance does not necessarily mean theoretical convergence. What is even more striking in her paper on memory are two issues: (a) There is no mention of the role of emotions in memory, and (b) There is a movement toward understanding memory not in terms of word lists or even lists of sentences, since with such material she claims we have missed principles of organization that may be preva lent in our daily lives. To the extent that the principles used to or ganize lists vary from other commonly used organizations, we are apt to develop distorted theories of memory, applicable only to lim ited phenomena (Mandler, 1979). The overarching concept of cognitive psychology refers to memory, language processing, perception, problem solving, and thinking. The Cognitive Psychology masthead says, "This journal emphasizes work on the organization of human information processing" (my italics). But even this categorization is incomplete and the journal editors hold that related areas, e.g., linguistics, artifi cial intelligence, and neuro-physiology, are also relevant. This exam ination of a journal's purpose reveals the breadth of the newly devel oped field, and at the same time reveals an awareness of the necessity for a cross-disciplinary strategy. Perhaps what we are wit nessing is not only fragmentation of areas, but a basic shift in catego rization of existent knowledge. This change is a prototype of things to come. The interest in children's cognitive development, now more broadly defined, will probably focus on more "realistic" problems. In this way, laboratory research may become closer to what children generally do. The arti ficiality may be more in the setting of the research than in the mate rials. But in spite of this new burst, there is still a dearth of research relating to children's understanding of what is to be done (metacognition), as well as feelings and attitudes that are concomi tant with task requirements. In other words, there is need to study the interface between cognition and affect. Currently, we are also willing to take into account the fact that children develop in social networksânot only is the family a source of influence, but so are social networks. Most recently, articles are appearing that deal with social networks (Cochran &amp; Brassard, 1979; Lewis &amp; Weinraub, 1976). In this increased awareness of the signifi</page><page sequence="20">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY canee of the broader social scene, we come head-on not only to concept issues but also to method problemsâhow to conceptualize impacts and how to measure them and how to analyze such complex data. We will have less fear of such issues in the 1980s because of computer technology. These broad trends provide overarching conceptualizations and programmatic definitions. Within each area we shall witness a con stant dialectic between precision and loose formulations and refor mulations. The field will constantly be in a state of change. Thus, problems in cognition will shift in concept and method. To expect otherwise is to view the development of development from a non dynamic perspective. Proliferation will continue and will yield new mosaics which will be broken up and reconstructured into equally aesthetic pieces. The biggest challenge will not be in the scientific realm but in the interface between science and social policy, a new specialization where the scientist enters the socio-political fray. The challenge is considerable, where few of us are experts and many of us are politi cal fledglings, but where many opportunities will arise amid dangers of immodesty, smugness, and oversimplification. While we have a sense of social responsibility to share our expertise with the policy makers, we must also accept the fact that few of us can take the poli cymakers' perspective. Also, few of our research results are directly applicable. Hence we need to interpret the material. If we are ego centric, all we shall get in policy discussions is collective monologues and parallel play. Only when we come to decenter, we may come to take the legislator or policymaker's perspective, thereby creating a reciprocal and productive relationship. Methodological Shifts There is considerable evidence that we are becoming increas ingly sensitive to the complexity of any behavior and aware of the multideterminations of any single cognitive act. For example, reach ing or speaking are influenced by an array of precursors that operate in the developmental history of the individual. While multivariate strategies are used to expand the array of contributing factors, these types of analyses are still insufficient. Increasingly, we shall need cau sal analyses (path analytic models) in developmental research where the temporal issues will be built in. Our own research in this form has helped us understand the causal connectives in identifying familial features impacting the child (Sigel, McGillicuddy-DeLisi, &amp; Johnson, Note 3). What this method requires is the specification of each of the</page><page sequence="21">Childhood Development Research factors and the direction of its effectâan important requirement forcing the development of more precise theorizing. A related problem is the development of adequate programs to analyze sequential behaviors that are involved in interaction analyses over the life span. As interactions beyond dyadic situations are ex amined, the need for more sophisticated methods becomes essential. Finally, the peculiar antagonism between experimental ap proaches and so-called naturalistic studies must be clarified. Such antipathy is unconstructive. CONCLUSION The study of child development has matured considerably in the past 10 years. Perhaps this maturity will be reflected in its incor poration as a field in life-span human development. Thus, the child will be viewed in a developmental context in concert with his peers and his parents, all of whom are to be viewed as developing humans, which will be a logical conceptual step that will create a develop mental perspective. Within this framework, specific problems will continue to engage us, such as the processes involved in developing of intelligence (Piagetian), the interface of emotions with intellect, and the widening of the sphere of influence to include social factors. This overview was not intended as a comprehensive review of the existing literature in the field. Rather, my aim was to reflect on what I believe is happening in the field. Other writers might have se lected different examples, different points of emphasis, and have come to different conclusions. But, for me, if through such reflec tions we become more aware of our traditions, our perspectives, we can engage in meta-reflectivityâreflecting on our reflections. Such an approach will alter the way we communicate about an exciting and challenging enterpriseâessentially asking Flavell's question, "What develops?" REFERENCE NOTES 1. Beilin, H.
