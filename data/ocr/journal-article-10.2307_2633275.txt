<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MODEL OF THE PLANTATION ECONOMY: THE CASE OF TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO by Trevor Sudama * This paper seeks to analyze and offer a critique of the model of the planta- tion economy with reference to the experience of Trinidad and Tobago. The model, conceptualized by Lloyd Best of the University of the West Indies with some collaborative involvement of Kari Levitt of McGill University (Best, 1968; Best and Levitt, 1969), has been chosen for three main reasons. First, it seems to be a seminal work in the new phase of Caribbean literature on development. A number of leading academic economists attached to the University of the West Indies and elsewhere have been influenced by this contribution. In his discus- sion of plantation economy, Beckford (1972:45) notes his indebtedness to Best, who "has described the situation exceptionally well in his 'Outlines of a Model of Pure Plantation Economy' " (1968). Girvan (in Beckford, 1975:125) acknowl- edges the support of Best and Levitt in the research work done for the project from which the plantation economy model developed. This work seemed to have strongly influenced Girvan's subsequent orientation. And Kari Levitt (1973:xix) states: "My collaboration in work on plantation economy with Mr. Lloyd Best of the University of the West Indies during his two-year stay at the Centre for Developing Areas Studies of McGill University assisted me in clari- fying the concept of the new mercantilism." Second, the school of thought which Best represents continues to exercise intellectual dominance in the English-speaking Caribbean. It should be added here that Thomas has in large measure moved out of this tradition, and his work (1974) marks a noteworthy contribution to dependen- cy/underdevelopment debate with particular reference to small economies. And third, Best is a practicing politician, and it is of interest to see to what extent, if any, the assumptions and analysis which characterize the model bear any relation to his political prescriptions. What follows is divided in a general schematic way into four sections. The first gives a brief outline of the main features of the plantation economy model. In the second, an attempt is made to ascertain whether, at a very general level, there is empirical evidence for the applicability of the model to Trinidad and Tobago and what tentative conclusions can be drawn. The third section sub- jects the model to a critique which involves reference to one stream of thought associated with the Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA) tradition (see O'Brien, 1975, and Harding, 1976) subsumed under the broad amorphous category called dependency theory. Finally, the relevance of the model to a *The author is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Political Economy, University of Toronto.

It should be noted that Lloyd Best is the leader of the political party called "Tapia" which seeks to replace the ruling People's National Movement (PNM) government of Dr. Eric Williams. Tapia has contested one general election to date, and Best has gone out of his way to project himself as the intellectual and political heir of Dr. Williams. THE PLANTATION ECONOMY MODEL IN OUTLINE The plantation model embodies an historical/structural analysis of econo- mies created by European colonization from the seventeenth century onward, primarily through the establishment of plantations. The characteristics of such plantations determined, as it were, the relationship of the metropolis to the colony (or hinterland) and the structure of the latter's ecanomy which, with some modifications, has persisted to the present. Best (1968:283) claims that "plantation economy . . . falls within the general class of externally propelled economies." For the purposes of analysis, historical periods are divided into three broad phases in the model: (a) Pure Plantation Economy, covering the period from about 1600 to 1838 (the cut-off date appearing to coincide with the abolition of slavery by the British); (b) Plantation Economy Modi- fied, spanning the period from about 1838 to 1938 (the eve of the Second World War); and (c) Plantation Economy Further Modified, 1938 onward. The pure plantation economy phase is crucial to our discussion, for it was at the beginning of this period that the rules according to which the hinterland economy related to the metropolitan economy were settled. Best (1968:283) summarizes the relationship as mercantilist and lists five major characteristics of what he calls the "general institutional framework of collaboration between the two." These were as follows: (1) The metropole had absolute discretion as to what conditions it created or altered in the hinterland' and with what other countries it established commercial and other relations; this freedom was de- nied the hinterland. (2) The division of labor was so regulated that "terminal activity," which implied primary production or elementary processing at one end and the final stages of assembly (if at all) at the other, was restricted to the hinterland. The great bulk of value-added activity (in money terms) was car- ried on in the metropole. (3) The monetary system in the hinterland was based on the Metropolitan Exchange Standard. There was free convertibility at a fixed rate of exchange between metropolitan and hinterland currencies. This system was aided by the establishment in the colony of financial intermedi- aries, having their head offices in the metropole, which converted their hinter- land assets into liabilities of the metropole, thereby facilitating payment for goods and services of metropolitan origin. This mechanism assured that the hinterland's reserves were always invested in the metropole. Conversely, in- vestment in the hinterland by metropolitan agents was greatly simplified and indeed formed the overwhelming portion of all investment. (4) All hinterland trade (with respect to origin, destination, or carriage) was controlled by the metropole (the navigation clause apparatus). And (5) arrangements under which hinterland producers met the needs of the metropolitan market were worked out on a preference system. The metropole's primary concern in the hinterland was production for ex- 'Best also distinguishes between hinterlands of exploitation, of conquest, and of settlement. This categorization merely differentiates the initial form of economic and political organization, since a hinterland of conquest could be converted into a hinterland of exploitation. Indeed, in the case of Trinidad and Tobago this was what happened. The country was originally a colony of Spain, was conquered by the British in 1797 and formally ceded by treaties in 1802 and 1814 (Robinson, 1971:3). However, only the exploitation relationship and its mechanisms are of interest to us here.</page><page sequence="3">SUDAMA: PLANTATION ECONOMY 67 port and not for local consumption. Establishment of the plantation economy meant that all economic inputs including labor (but not land, of course) were supplied by the metropolitan agents from the outside. Labor input was essen- tial since the indigenous populations were decimated within a very short peri- od of time after colonization. From almost the very inception of the plantation economy, slave and indentured immigrant labor brought from the outside was harnessed to the plantation. The option of subsistence production could not by any means have been permitted, and thus the plantation had to encompass the work force's total existence. Plantations were more or less self-contained units: "The plantation which admits virtually no distinction between organization and society, and chattel slavery which deprives workers of all civil rights in- cluding right to property, together furnish an ideal framework" (Best, 1968:287). Such an economy has only one sector which may be broken up into a number of individual plantations. A change of metropolitan masters hardly mattered. The mercantilist relationship was merely reoriented to a new metro- pole while plantation owners changed nationality. Production for export re- mained the dominant form of economic activity. All change was induced from the metropole with the ultimate aim of benefiting agents of the metropole. The pure plantation economy phase experienced periods of expansion and recession which coincided more or less with the fortunes of the single staple export in the metropolitan or European market. In the initial period (around the first half of the seventeenth century), the metropole granted titles of own- ership to land in the colony to favored individuals (lords proprietors) who then, for a rent consideration, alloted their holdings to joint-stock trading companies organized by merchants. It is these companies that undertook the plantation venture by mobilizing capital and other "inputs." In this exercise, the mer- chants played a key role. The joint-stock company set up its production unit in the hinterland by sending out its agents (planters), by acquiring fixed capital in the form of slaves and equipment and also by acquiring working capital (prov- isions, tools, and supplies). Apart from a very limited local production, all the plantation needs were imported and "trade and payments are effected as 'in- tra-company' transfers and book transactions" (Best, 1968:288). The merchant retained an overriding control. At the same time he tended to move towards mortgage lending and assigned to the planter the full entrepreneurial role with all its risks and opportunities. With the lapse of time, a number of factors combined to bring production into decline. The soil became less productive, the cost of slaves rose, and the price of the export crop fell in the metropolis due to excess supply. The planter and the plantation economy found adjustment difficult, if not impossible. The upkeep of slaves was a fixed cost and, though some were deployed to mainte- nance jobs, this was hardly an alternative for the majority. The slaves were not trained to do anything other than unskilled agricultural work. Nor was there a subsistence sector to which they could be shunted off until needed. On the other hand, the planter could not command the capital for reinvestment in the plantation which might have enabled it to become somewhat more competi- tive. Lacking capital and unable to meet fixed interest obligations to the mer- chant, the planter could not attract capital from that source either. The alterna- tive of diversifying production to meet local consumption needs would have required a whole new institutional framework beyond the horizon of the local planter. In the meantime, fresh loan funds were obtained wherever they could be had, but the mounting indebtedness and the diminishing disposable product meant increasing pressures from metropolitan creditors, coupled with growing restlessness among the slaves whose living standards had been reduced. With an economic solution ruled out, it became clear that the remaining Latin American Perspectives: Issue 20, Winter 19?79?, Vol. VI, No. 1</page><page sequence="4">68 LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES option was political. The planter soon discovered that special price formulas and entry terms in the metropolitan market were increasingly difficult to ar- range. The mercantilist era was being undermined by the new industrialist class, and "free trade" was being vigorously advocated in the metropolis. A political solution was eventually adopted, but it was forced by the metropoli- tan government, resulting in basic reforms of plantation economy institutions - primarily the abolishment of "the old labour regime" (Best, 1968:294) and market monopoly system. The emancipation of the slaves became a reality (the Emancipation Bill was passed in Britain in 1833), and the pure plantation econ- omy phase came to an end. However, of all the types of hinterland, the hinter- land of exploitation "experiences the greatest difficulty in adjusting to the breakdown of the mercantilist order. The legacy of institutions, structures, and behaviour patterns of the plantation system are so deeply entrenched that ad- justment tends to take place as an adaptation within the bounds of the estab- lished framework" (Best, 1968:294). With minor modifications, all the major characteristics of the previous phase persisted into the phase of plantation economy modified. What differen- tiated this phase, however, was the acute labor shortage experienced on the plantations as a result of the emancipation of the slaves and the manner in which the shortage was solved. In the particular case of Trinidad and Tobago, the long-term solution to the labor shortage was sought in the recruitment of indentured immigrant workers from India. Between 18382 and 1917, it has been claimed that 145,000 such immigrants were brought to Trinidad (Williams, 1964:100), many of whom, after fulfillment of their contracts, became semi-in- dependent peasants. (Another event of significance in the case of Trinidad and Tobago was the discovery of petroleum resources at the turn of the century [Robinson, 1971:28]. Consequently, in the following decades a mineral staple, developed by metropolitan capital and geared to the metropolitan market, re- placed the agricultural staple, sugar, as the mainstay of the economy.) The phase of the plantation economy further modified covers the period from the Second World War to the present, according to Best. During the course of the war, the plantation economy was forced, by the general inacces- sibility of imports, to become much more self-reliant than during the First World War. The self-sufficiency was, however, largely confined to food re- quirements and some simple consumer products. There was also a limited shift of trade from Europe to North America. But because the institutional frame- work continued unchanged and taste patterns persisted, the metropolitan-hin- terland ties were easy to re-establish, and the import-substitution trend was effectively reversed after the war. In the late fifties, however, and especially after independence from coloni- al rule (Trinidad and Tobago became independent in 1962), attempts were made both by the colonial and post-colonial governments to foster develop- ment. But the concept of development was a limited one. A strategy of diversi- fication was devised based on import-substitution, primarily of a narrow range of consumer goods. The policy envisaged luring foreign investment through offers of almost limitless concessions. The implementation of this development stategy coincided with the coming of age of the multinational corporation and the rapid spread of their activities throughout the world. Consciously or un- consciously the path of development that was being followed was a path deter- mined by the interests, perspectives, and goals of the multinational corpora- tions and international capital. The strategy of development pursued implied development only within the framework set by the interests of these corpora- 2Although Indians were introduced to British Guiana as early as 1838, actual immigration to Trini- dad only began in 1845.</page><page sequence="5">SUDAMA: PLANTATION ECONOMY 69 tions. The consequences of this strategy are noted by Best and Levitt as fol- lows: "The result is that the typical manufacturing establishment is a taker of highly specific technology, tied to imported tastes, imported intermediate and capital goods, and imported managerial personnel and organizational proce- dures" (1975:57). No new linkages are established, structural transformation is minimal or absent, and "terminal activity" remains the norm. In the case of Trinidad and Tobago, foreign investment through the multin- ational corporations and international agencies now dominates the traditional major sectors (oil, chemical, sugar) of the economy and determines the distri- bution of the economic product, the disposal of the surplus, trade patterns, and tastes. Development undertaken by the government continues to be almost wholly dependent on the revenues received from these corporations. Local capital, mobilized largely by the metropolitan banks, is hardly accessible to indigenous entrepreneurs, but it is readily available to the distributive trades sector (where little risk is involved) and foreign firms and joint ventures. Due to structural and institutional constraints, governments find themselves unable to mobilize and redirect internal resources. Preferential markets in the metro- politan countries are still sought for agricultural staples and "high-cost" manu- factures. This favored approach to development brings little success. "In point of fact," say Best and Levitt, "the strategy of 'industrialization by invitation' does not bring transformation. Rather it reinforces the traditional institutions of plantation economy" (1975:56). Thus, in modified form, the institutional framework and structures of the pure planation economy remain. APPLICATION OF MODEL TO TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO The plantation economy model outlined above is in the nature of an ab- straction - what might be called an "ideal type." It has been formulated by abstracting features of societies which have had, by and large, similar histori- cal experiences. An attempt has been made to put these abstracted features into a kind of theoretical framework. However, the degree of coherence which these features are accorded in the framework is such that the theoretical im- port of the model is very much in question. Suffice it to say that the model as such does not exist in its pure form in reality. However, an attempt will be made to ascertain to what extent the general characteristics of the economy, identified by the model as salient features, are in fact observable (if even in an indirect way) in the case of Trinidad and Tobago. In particular, attention will be paid to the patterns of trade with the metropolis, the pattern of foreign in- vestment, the structure of the economy, the monetary system, and any system of market preferences. Of necessity, greater attention will be focussed on the recent past. Some doubt has been expressed as to what extent the Trinidad and Tobago economy approximated the plantation economy model. The confusion stems from the lack of clarity in the model itself on its definition of a plantation econ- omy, that is, whether the emphasis is on the character of the dominant rela- tions of production within the colony, on selected structural features, or on the dependency aspect of the total society in its relationship with the metropolis. Thus Williams (1964:81) states that "Trinidad in 1833 was not a plantation so- ciety. Rather it was a society of small estates operated by a few slaves." In support of this view he notes that Trinidad and Tobago had by August 1834 a combined total slave population of 26,517 "divided into three broad categories: predial attached, the field slaves; predial unattached; and non-predial slaves employed in service, such as on the wharves, and domestic servants" (Wil- Latin Americain Perspectives Issue 20, Winter 1979, Vol. VI, No. 1</page><page sequence="6">70 LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES liams, 1964:83). Another argument that could be advanced is that the pattern of trade at this point in time does not seem to indicate a very large sugar cane sector, and it was in sugar cultivation that slave labor was chiefly employed. There was some diversity in the commodities exported, and one could not point to a single staple export. Though sugar was at this time still pre-eminent among exports, cocoa and, to a lesser extent, coffee were acquiring increasing significance (Williams, 1964:78). Trinidad was also importing in substantial quantities from Venezuela (Williams, 1964:79), which implies that its import trade was not restricted to Britain. However, those who argue that the characteristics of the plantation econo- my are nevertheless discernible in Trinidad and Tobago at this period are able to point to a number of factors. The slave population of the country was well over half of its total population. In 1828, for example, the total population was 42,874 (Williams, 1964:79) and could not have been a great deal more in 1834. The overwhelming proportion of the population was engaged, in one way or another, with the production, processing, and export of a narrow range of agri- cultural crops. Of the total value of exports, sugar continued to be the most important single item. Moreover, the imports from Venezuela were part of a triangular trade involving British exports of manufactures to Venezuela, with British merchants serving as intermediaries. In addition, the investment was almost exclusively British, and the monetary system (or whatever there was of it) was under the latter's control. One author notes that, "With the absorption into the British system, Trinidad and Tobago developed the standard colonial relationship with Britain as banker, financier, trading partner" (Robinson, 1971:35). Trade relationships with the metropolis were mediated by a system of preferences and, although the protectionist duties on British West Indian sugar entering the British market were repealed in 1852 (Williams, 1964:156), the im- plementation of this measure did not take full effect until 1874. Hence there was neither an immediate nor complete disorientation of trade relations. Some existing contacts and arrangements did operate in a preferential way, particu- larly where the investment interests also managed the trade internally in Brit- ain. Thus it appears that, while the characterization of the internal arrange- ments for the organization of production could be disputed, the external rela- tionships in this period more closely approached those defined by the model. During the plantation economy modified phase, there were periods when no exclusive trading pattern with the metropolis, Britain, is observed. This would, on the face of it, open to question the existence of one of the character- istic features of the economy posited by the model. Mid-way during this phase, around the period 1886 to 1890, the greater portion (67 percent) of Trinidad's sugar exports went to the United States3 instead of to Britain and represented the high point of a trend which commenced in the 1850s (Williams, 1964:157). Nor was sugar the main staple export in this period. In 1886 the value of cocoa exported was 37 percent of total commodity exports with sugar exports for that year just behind (Statistical Abstract, 1889:89). This indicates that there were two major export staples and two different markets to which they were sent. The question which this raises again for the plantation economy model and the metropolis/hinterland relationship is whether both markets were intermediated by common agents, suggesting a triangular trade. This seems to have been very likely. Of total commodity imports into Trinidad and 'But the United States had practically no investment in Trinidad at this time and could not be said to have assumed a metropolitan relationship vis-a-vis Trinidad and Tobago. The question of who intermediated the trade again becomes relevant, and it is reasonable to assume that British mer- chants were heavily involved in this trade.</page><page sequence="7">SUDAMA: PLANTATION ECONOMY 71 Tobago in 1886, only 43.2 percent (Statistical Abstract, 1889:31,89) originated in the United Kingdom. The bulk of the remaining imports came from North America, though it is again likely that shipping and financial arrangements were handled by the British. The content of imports seems to confirm the na- ture of external dependence. Cottons accounted for 17.3 percent and food items (fish, flour, meat, and rice) for 21.5 percent (Statistical Abstract, 1889:89). Of these items the only one that could not have been produced in Trinidad and Tobago was flour made from wheat. During this phase of plantation economy modified, two Canadian banks began operations in the country (Robinson, 1971:18) but had no impact on the working of the monetary system. They mere- ly adapted to the needs of a system controlled from Britain. As stated by a former Minister of Finance, "The monetary system of the first half of the twen- tieth century as it affected the colonies was such that sterling was the standard currency and all colonial currencies were pegged to it. Reserves were held and invested in the United Kingdom. Monetary management therefore became sim- ply an automatic consequence of the management of sterling" (Robinson, 1971:35). As a consequence of the onset of world-wide depression, the "free trade" policy was abandoned by the metropolis, and the statutory preference system was re-established at the Imperial Economic Conference in Ottawa in 1932. This would bolster the argument that some characteristics of the planta- tion economy persevered into modern times. In the current phase of plantation economy further modified, petroleum products are the most important item of export (a mineral staple instead of an agricultural one) and in the years between 1964 and 1971 accounted for 86 to 88 percent of total commodity exports (Jainarain, 1976:293). The principal country to which exports are directed is the United States which accounted for 47 per- cent of the total value of commodity exports in 1969, though this figure de- clined to 40 percent in 1971 (Jainarain, 1976:149). The overwhelming portion of these exports to the United States comprised petroleum and petroleum prod- ucts. Since the U.S. entry into the Trinidad petroleum industry, a large refining capacity has been installed with about two-thirds of the refined petroleum products derived from imported crudes (Jainarain, 1976:289). This fact would seem to contradict one of the postulates of the plantation economy model, i.e., that significant product elaboration does not take place in the hinterland. But the role of the multinational corporation and its ability to shift production around must be borne in mind. Those who argue that the plantation economy model is still applicable maintain that the refining process (product elabora- tion) can be transferred elsewhere (though at a cost), that there is no perman- ence to the activity, and that it is not under indigenous direction and control and does not develop local linkages. There is the further claim that when one considers the range of products which emanate from a petroleum base (espe- cially petrochemicals), those that are the result of simple refining constitute a very limited range. The lion's share of product elaboration still takes place in the metropolis. Trinidad can boast of no petrochemical industry, though a number of plans may be on paper as is currently the case. The decline of the United Kingdom as a recipient country for Trinidad ex- ports merely reflects its declining role as the metropolis, according to the mod- el. From taking 27.7 percent of total exports in 1951, in 1971 it received only 8.9 percent (Jainarain, 1976:150). As a source of imports, the United Kingdom's share has dropped from 35.6 percent in 1951 to 13.2 percent in 1971, whereas over the same period the United States' share climbed from 8.3 to 17.5 percent (Jainarain, 1976:150). Figures for the United States do not, however, provide a complete picture since the imports of crude into Trinidad from Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and Lybia are all under the control of a U.S.-based multinational Latin Am&amp;kaco Perspectives~ Issue 20, Winter 1979, Vol. Vl, No. 1</page><page sequence="8">72 LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES and account for 38.2 percent of total imports (Jainarain, 1976:150). The heavy concentration of trade under the direction or control of U.S. multinationals seems undeniable. The composition of imports into Trinidad and Tobago does not convey the impression of a dynamic economy capable of "indigenous-pro- pelled" growth and development. In 1970, 53 percent of total commodity im- ports was in industrial fuels, mainly petroleum crude. Of the remaining 47 per- cent, approximately 20 percent, or nearly a half, was in the form of consumer goods - a fact which illustrates the continuing "taste" for, i.e. dependence on, imported products. About 11 percent, or almost a quarter, of the non-petroleum imports were in the nature of intermediate goods, i.e. agricultural and industri- al raw materials and industrial chemicals. This figure has significance for the ostensible expansion in the manufacturing sector to be discussed below. Capi- tal goods accounted for the remaining 15 percent of imports (Jainarain, 1976:149). In terms of direct foreign investment, the demise of the presence of the United Kingdom and the predominance of the United States are only too ob- vious. In 1968 British direct investment in Trinidad and Tobago was a mere ?34.6 million [U.S. $83 million] (The Caribbean, n.d.:22) and appeared to follow a declining trend. However at the end of 1973, U.S. direct investment in the country was U.S. $650 million of an estimated total direct foreign investment of U.S. $1,000 million (Garner, n.d.:7). Flows of direct foreign investment into and out of the country showed an alarming deficit in the recent past. One commen- tator pointed out that, "In the period 1956-67 the inflow of direct foreign invest- ment into Trinidad and Tobago was TT $908.3m [U.S. $529.8 million], while the outflow of investment income arising from direct foreign investment amounted to TT $1306.2m [U.S. $761.9 million], i.e nearly 50% in excess of the capital inflow" (Jefferson, 1972). The bare statistics would seem to point to some changes in the structure of the Trinidad and Tobago economy, but important qualifications need to be made in drawing conclusions from the figures. The advocates of the plantation model have not conclusively proved that there were no structural changes whatsoever that took place in the fifties and sixties. From 1951 to 1968 the con- tribution of agriculture to the Gross Domestic Product dropped from 17.1 per- cent to 8.3 percent (Jainarain, 1976:136,162), but the sector continued to employ in the latter year approximately 25 percent of the labor force. This could only mean falling real incomes for those employed in that sector. Mining and refin- ing fell from 30.6 percent to 24 percent over the same period. The contribution of the manufacturing sector rose from 13.9 percent to 17 percent, but the im- portant qualification here is that these statistics are not based on value-added figures and therefore tend to exagerate the degree of structural change. (The plantation economy model rejects out of hand the notion that any real structur- al change is possible.) The high import volume of intermediate and capital goods has already been noted, and the bulk of these are utilized in the manu- facturing sector with their value included in the contribution of this sector. Significantly, too, the percentage of the labor force employed in the sector has fallen from 18.9 percent in 1946 to 15.0 per cent in 1971 (Jainarain, 1976:136,162). The contribution of public utilities and services to the GDP shows a jump from 27.2 percent to 37.4 percent in the same period. The employment in these sec- tors also records a rise, but since they are controlled by the government and used for patronage purposes, the increase in the percentage figures would re- flect, to a large degree, increased wage payments without any corresponding increase in real output. As further evidence of limited structural change and its implication for growth, it has been pointed out that the growth rate in the GNP per capita over the period 1960 to 1970 was a modest 1.9 percent (The Carib-</page><page sequence="9">SUDAMA: PLANTATION ECONOMY 73 bean, n.d.:8). And there was the persistence of very high ratios of exports and imports to GDP. In 1962, exports as a percentage of GDP were 59.3 percent, and in 1961 the import ratio was 64.5 percent (Demas, 1965:104). However, by 1968 the export ratio had risen to 70 percent with the import ratio remaining more or less the same at 63 percent (Jainarain, 1976:133). In an age of multinational corporations, the formal control of the monetary system by a government may mean little in its attempts to come to grips with the problems of balance of payments and currency parities, not to mention capital movements. The problems are especially acute for small countries. (Nevertheless, one would expect with Trinidad's accession to political inde- pendence some attempt towards independent action.) It is significant that Trin- idad and Tobago, which became independent in 1962, continued to maintain a currency linked to the U.K. pound sterling and continued for a long while after 1962 to keep the major portion of its reserves in sterling assets. Finally, Trini- dad and Tobago continues to seek preferential terms for its major agricultural export, sugar, and for certain manufactured goods, both from the United King- dom (the former metropolis now a member of the European Economic Com- munity) and from the United States (the current metropolis). The above attempt to seek empirical verification of the plantation economy model may justifiably be objected to on the ground that it uses statistics based on bourgeois concepts of economic structure and growth; that the macro fig- ures tell us nothing about the relationships between groups and classes or about changing or persisting relations of production; that the model's assump- tion of a unidirectional relationship between structural change (or transforma- tion) and growth is erroneous in that there could be structural change with or without growth. The pertinent question then, from this view, is not whether there has been structural change, but in whose interests do the persisting or changing structures operate. The objection is well taken, but, as I said earlier, the model first had to be dealt with on its own ground. From the foregoing, one can say that it is possible to make a case that today Trinidad and Tobago finds itself in a dependency relationship with the new metropolis, the United States, in the economic terms postulated by the planta- tion economy model (re: trade, investment, technology, etc.) One can also maintain that some internal changes in the economy, by and large quantitative, have been induced from the outside. But the precise manner in which these changes have actually resulted is not elaborated by the model. The postulated connection between dependency, the unchanging structure of the economy, and the absence of internal linkages is not made explicit. There are a number of other crucial questions left unanswered; for example, the relationship be- tween dependency and the failure to effectively mobilize the country's internal resources, or the persistence of foreign-dictated taste patterns, or the problems of large-scale unemployment and gross inequalities. But even if we concede that the general features of the institutional framework which characterized the pure plantation economy are substantially visible today (if with minor changes), we are now confronted by the questions: Has the model analyzed in a rigorous way the mechanisms by which these structures are said to have been perpetuated? Are these structures theoretical constructs or merely des- criptive categories? Has the model rigorously analyzed the relationship be- tween internal processes and external developments, or does the model merely "sensitize" us to the existence of the external dimension of the problem of un- derdevelopment? At this point we have to take a more critical look at the mod- el and its underlying assumptions in order to assess its usefulness as a tool of analysis.

Vt, No. 1</page><page sequence="10">74 LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES LATIN AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN "DEPENDENCE" SCHOOLS - A CRITIQUE Before we move on to a more systematic critique of the plantation econo- my model, it is necessary to attempt some clarification on Girvan's thesis that contributions emerging in Latin America and the English-speaking Caribbean, based on the concept of external dependence and the institutionalization of underdevelopment . . .show that there is an underlying similarity in the methodology of the two schools of thought, which emerged virtually independently of one another; and that this similarity derives from a common need to devise an appropriate theoretical framework from the interpretation and analysis of the economic process in both regions . . . The similarities, the differences, and the growing convergence, of the content of dependency economics in the two regions, reflect similarities and differences in the terms upon which the two regions were incorporated into the international economy, and the growing convergence in the nature of their dependence and underdevelopment in the contemporary period (Girvan, 1973:1). This lengthy quotation serves to highlight a number of issues that are cru- cial to an understanding of the nature of the contribution of the Caribbean "dependency" school (represented by Best, Girvan, Beckford). In the first place, the whole notion that "the two schools of thought . . . emerged . . . in- dependently of one another" is a conscious attempt to stake out supposedly new intellectual ground, to make a claim to indigenous pioneering effort in isolation from any foreign influences. The extent of this so-called independ- ence has been questioned by Cumper (1974:465). He points to the role of Dud- ley Seers and the plantation sociologists who were involved in studying both the Caribbean and Latin America and who were in frequent contact with intel- lectuals of both regions. Girvan also seems to be asserting the rather dubious proposition that "dependency economics" is somehow either a differentiated discipline or an identifiable sub-discipline of the field of economics. Secondly, Girvan's ideological predisposition becomes evident in the manner in which he selects the material used in his review. The influence of the Cuban revolution on the development of dependency theory is nowhere mentioned in his article. The only reference to Cuba (1973:26) is to emphasize its dependent position in the socialist bloc. Furthermore, the Latin American dependency theorists whose positions he emphasizes and identifies with almost exclusively are Sun- kel and Furtado of the ECLA tradition (O'Brien, 1975:11) which is intellectually congenial to the Caribbean dependency school. Dos Santos, Cardoso, and Fal- etto are mentioned briefly in a couple of lines (Girvan, 1973:22) while no refer- ence is made to Marini, Quijano or Florestan Fernandes who all represent in varying manner a Marxist perspective. Bambirra's position is quoted (Girvan, 1973:25) but only to be summarily dismissed as advocating a transfer of de- pendence to socialist countries for technical inputs - for had not Sunkel re- jected this proposition as contrary to a policy of national development? Mean- while Girvan advocates continued "negotiations" with the multinational cor- porations within a system of capitalist relations. Therefore, when Girvan speaks of the growing convergence of the content of dependency economics in the two regions, he has in mind only the bourgeois tradition, not Marxist. And when Girvan speaks of "the growing convergence in the nature of their (the two regions') dependence and underdevelopment in the contemporary period," one wonders whether he is stretching a point or being rather simplistic. For such would be the case to speak of the changes taking place in, say, Brazil and Jamaica as a "convergence in the nature of their dependence and underdevel-</page><page sequence="11">SUDAMA: PLANTATION ECONOMY 75 opment." Finally, if there was such a "common need to devise an appropriate theoretical framework" (emphasis mine), one wonders why the need did not arise in the dependent countries of Asia and Africa by producing a similar theoretical structure. Leys notes that "from a diversity of currents . . . [there was] by the mid- 60's an apparent theoretical mingling of structuralism with Marxism" (1978:8). It is necessary to emphasize that, with the exception of Thomas' recent contri- butions, there was no such mingling in the case of the English-speaking Carib- bean for the simple reason that there was no resident Marxist tradition. This must be borne in mind in order to locate in the ideological spectrum the place of Best and the Caribbean dependency school. Theirs is a purely histori- cal/structural/institutional tradition and, in this limited sense, it is possible to compare the contributions of Sunkel and Furtado with those of Best. This cri- tique will therefore deal only with this tradition. Girvan (1973) argues that both schools trace their lineage from a disillusionment with the import-substitution and "investment by invitation" philosophy of development of the fifties and early sixties and from a need to search for new insights. As regards methodolo- gy, Sunkel (1973:134) makes the point that "historical insight is essential for the identification of such structural elements, explanation of the functioning of system with a given structure, and analysis of structural change itself" and adds further "it becomes quite clear that external links and relationships have exercized a fundamental influence on the shaping of the structures of our sys- tems and, therefore, on their functioning and outcome." Sunkel's historical phases more or less correspond to the phases which find expression in the plantation economy model. Where Best and Levitt (1969) describe the planta- tion as being structurally part of an "overseas economy" comprising metropo- lis and hinterland, Sunkel identifies "mechanisms of dependence" (Girvan, 1973:10) which "he reformulates into a global view of the Latin American eco- nomic process, wherein they become elements in a system. . ." The plantation model's focus on the persistence of the institutional framework and internal structures is also reflected in Furtado's problematic from which the historical method of investigation emerges (Girvan, 1973:13). Leys (1976) has made an excellent general critique of underdevelop- ment/dependency theory and my own comments on the plantation economy model draw on this work. One of the basic criticisms relates to the empiricist assumptions of the model. Best and Levitt proceed by constructing models of certain historical phases through identifying the institutional structures as the product of interacting social forces - hence the necessity to conceptualize re- lationships and interactions by going behind the superficial appearances. How- ever, having constructed them, we are told that "as an interpretation of eco- nomic history these models may be conceived of as successive stages in the evolution of plantation economy" (Girvan, 1973:16). In other words, it is as if historical space were truncated into given intervals, and structures identified in one period somehow found themselves (with minor modifications) located in another. These stages are successive only by description; and history, as Leys (1976:9) has commented, then becomes only empty "empirical periodiza- tion." Thus, although an historical approach to the analysis of plantation econ- omy seems to be postulated, the content of the analysis is anything but histori- cal. There is no serious attempt to analyze internal processes of change by identifying the continuity and strength of social forces. The periodization por- trays self-enclosed moments in time and static relations which are mechanical- ly transposed from one period to another. And underlying all this is the unreal- istic assumption that in the long interval between the establishment of planta- tions and the society of today no significant developments have taken place. In Latin American Perspectives: Issue 20, Winter 1979, Vol. Vl, No. 1</page><page sequence="12">76 LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES fact the model can only obscure any changes by stressing continuity. Another problem relates not only the kind of questions but the manner in which they were posed and to which answers were sought through the devel- opment of the model. For example, such questions as whether there might not be "a path of innovation which may lead to the fullest transformation of a small economy?" and whether "the particular experiences and resources of a particular people in a particular habitat lead them both to express qualitatively different sets (as well as different orderings) of preferences from others, and also to devise different means of achieving their goals?" or whether it is "in- herent in the structure of the international corporations which operate in the region that the Caribbean economies remain fragmented and unintegrated?" seem to be badly posed (Best, quoted in Girvan, 1973:15). The size of an econo- my is certainly a factor to be taken into consideration, but the whole notion that there might be a "path of innovation" to be somehow empirically discov- ered and which when taken would lead automatically to the fullest transfor- mation seems to be somewhat naive, if not utopian. And how people express or order their preferences and come to terms with their habitat surely has to do with the development of the productive forces and the kind of relations of pro- duction which such development dictates, i.e. with the character of the domi- nant mode of production. People simply do not just "decide" to order their preferences in some wholly idealist or voluntaristic manner. And if one takes seriously Best's statement about the inherent structure of international corporations responsible for fragmented economies in the Carib- bean, only two solutions seem possible - either get rid of the international corporations operating in the area or force them to change their structure. We shall soon see how Best's political program attempts to deal with this. Follow- ing from the content of the questions and the manner in which they are posed, the task is then defined as identifying "the crucial obstacles to transformation [such] as the nature of economic institutions and economic policy, and the pat- tern of tastes and of technology." From such a definition flow the inevitable demands of economic policy for "a reorganization of institutions to permit a transformation of the structure of production, the development of indigenous technology, and the definition of social goals and preferences from within" (Girvan, 1973:17), that is, what emerges is a policy of liberal reformism. What seems clear from the above is that transformation is regarded as a natural evolutionary process, and all that is necessary is the removal of the obstacles which stand in the way. The paternity of such a view of development can be found in the bourgeois modernization theories of the fifties and early sixties propounded by U.S. writers such as Almond and Powell, Eisenstadt, Pye, Hirschman, Rostow, Lewis and others who were concerned with identify- ing and removing the obstacles to modernization. Furthermore, what the dy- namic of this primordial demiurge of transformation is we are not told. And we are left to speculate on exactly where people fit in this scheme of reorganiza- tion of institutions, transformation of the structure of production, and defini- tion of goals. It is reasonable to conclude that the mass of the people are viewed as merely passive observers of all this frenzied activity which presum- ably engages the attention of technocrats, intellectuals, and the middle classes generally (Cueva, 1976:14). The elitist assumptions of the model are only very thinly disguised. Thus, in spite of Girvan's talk of an indigenous school of thought, what Morrissey (1976:98) describes as the "superstructure of subjuga- tion" remains very much in evidence at the intellectual level. An analysis of the assumptions and structure of the plantation model identifies Best as a vic- tim of intellectual imperialism - a view no doubt against which he would vi- olently protest.</page><page sequence="13">SUDAMA: PLANTATION ECONOMY 77 Many commentators have also remarked on the virtual absence of any re- ference to class or even any conception of it in Best's model, let alone an analy- sis of class conflict (Leys, 1976:4). On this question, Oxaal (1975:45) has made the point that "the refusal of Lloyd Best to recognize the importance of making a class analysis of Trinidadian and West Indian society is one of the peculiari- ties and . . . the major weakness in Best's ideology." Such a class analysis would require a rigorous analysis of relations of production identifying pat- terns of relationships which involve people's location in the process of produc- tion. Such a course ought to lead to discussion of power relations between classes, of conflicts and the role of the state in dealing with such conflicts, and therefore its relationship to the classes in question. The model has circumvent- ed these questions in the following manner: (a) by not posing them at all; for example, by refusing to consider that the persistence of structures may have something to do with the dominance of certain groups or classes in the society; (b) by ascribing to external factors a prominence which all but erase internal developments from the account, (as noted above, plantation economy is cate- gorically deemed to be an "externally-propelled" economy); and (c) by ascrib- ing a cognitive capacity to abstractions, a kind of anthropomorphism as, for example, when Best states: "During this foundation period the economy ac- quires characteristic patterns of behaviour" (1968:289, my emphasis). Thus a discussion of classes and their behavior both in terms of their potential for changing structures within the framework of the society (and indeed the framework itself) or for reproducing these structures is noteworthy for its abs- ence. In the non-conflictual class harmony scheme sketched by the model, the state appears to be both an expression of the popular will and a neutral instru- ment wielded by technocrats for implementing the "best" solutions. Thus the plantation economy model exists merely as a descriptive appara- tus with very little explanatory power. No rigorous conceptualization of the underlying dynamics of the abstracted features is made; nor are the relation- ships between the features given any systematic theoretical examination. As a description of static reality, the model may have some utility, but as an analyti- cal construct which seeks to establish causal relationships and explain the dy- namics of historical change, the model is clearly unsatisfactory and of little use. Furthermore, the model is almost wholly oriented to the discipline of (bourgeois) economics. Best, however, recognizes this limitation. He maintains that "the barriers between sociology, political science, economic history, an- thropology, and economics, as such, need a drastic lowering" (Best, 1968:323). Yet an expansion or reformulation has not been attempted, while in a recent publication Best and Levitt (1975:34-60) have reissued the model, though in a very synoptic form. In a methodological critique, Benn (1974:256) has pointed out that the concept of plantation economy as a "total social system" (in a monolithic sense), though perhaps valid for the phase of pure plantation econ- omy (i.e. the phase of slavery), is not adequate for analyzing the dynamics of the society in the post-emancipation period when a partially independent peas- ant sector emerged. Though Benn's reference (1974:258) to the end result of this "holistic approach to the study of society (imposing) a one-dimensional view" seems to convey an implicit criticism of Marxist methodology, he nevertheless draws our attention to the economism of the model which seeks to link all social phenomena directly to economic forms. While from a Marxist perspec- tive economic relations are of primary significance and determine all other so- cial relations, it is not a simple determination. The economic is determinant only "in the last instance" and through a series of mediations. It is the analysis of these "structures of mediation" between the economic and superstructural levels (i.e. political and ideological) that is crucial to the Marxist method. And Latin American Perspectives: Issue 20, Winter 1979, Vol. VI, No. 1</page><page sequence="14">78 LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES it is the failure of the plantation model to attempt to analyze the complex, di- alectical relationship between the economic and other levels which constitutes another of its more serious shortcomings. In historical terms, the model over- whelmingly adheres to what may be termed the "product cycle syndrome" which posits that the hinterland's fortunes are dictated mechanistically by the stages in the life of the staple export industry. The situation today that requires explanation is more complex because of the (at least overtly) more multilateral nature of economic relationships introduced by the multinational corporations. In the case of Trinidad and Tobago, the U.S. imperialist connection was initiated during the Second World War as a result of the building of military bases in 1942 for strategic purposes. From that time onward an implicit imperi- alist relationship with Trinidad and Tobago in cultural and ideological terms was increasingly stengthened through literature, films, the activities of reli- gious organizations, and immigration. Yet the latter remained a colony of the United Kingdom, which was responsible for the overwhelming portion of for- eign investment there. Unless this historical development is recognized, it is not possible to understand the full nature of the current U.S.-Trinidad imperi- alist relationship. It was only in 1956 that U.S. investment in Trinidad and To- bago became significant as a result of the purchase by Texaco Inc. of the major oil company, then a British concern. In 1965, three years after independence was gained and with a domestic ruling class installed (national but imperialist junior partners) in office, serious strikes and worker protests broke out primar- ily in the sugar industry, then owned by the U.K. firm, Tate and Lyle Ltd, and in the oil industry, largely owned by Texaco. The domestic ruling class re- sponded by declaring a state of emergency during which the Industrial Stabili- zation Act was passed, virtually banning all strikes and requiring the submis- sion of all industrial disputes to compulsory adjudication procedures. Similari- ly in 1971, as a result of worker protests in the oil industry, a state of emergency was declared; the oil workers' union leadership was detained and wage negotiations conducted during their detention. Also in 1971 a libel charge was brought against a former minister in the Trinidad and Tobago government who alleged that the ruling party was offered a half-million-dollar bribe by an oil company for concession rights. And in 1976 the principal beneficiaries of the de facto devaluation of the Trinidad and Tobago dollar were the oil compa- nies whose accounts were kept in U.S. dollars and who periodically trans- ferred sums from their head offices to meet local disbursements. Within three months in that year the Trinidad and Tobago dollar devalued to the extent of 16 percent. Thus for every U.S. $100 million the oil companies formerly trans- ferred, they were in this period in a position to transfer only U.S. $84 million to meet the same level of local disbursements. The local groups who benefited were sectors of the local bourgeoisie producing consumer goods for export and wholesale and retail merchants dealing in goods whose demand was non price- elastic. Both these sectors had strong influence with the government and ruling class. In all these cases it seems reasonable to infer that the local ruling class acted under pressure from sectors of the American and British bourgeoisies, but the role of the latter two governments as such is not quite clear. Yet there seems little doubt that the responses of the local ruling class expressed an im- perialist relationship. This discussion is not intended to question whether Trinidad and Tobago is integrated into the system of imperialism or to deny the existence of an im- perialist relationship between the United States and Trinidad and Tobago. It merely serves to highlight the subtle ramifications and the multilateral nature of such a relationship which involves the shifting emphases on different ele- ments of power in its system of domination. It is this kind of interaction which</page><page sequence="15">SUDAMA: PLANTATION ECONOMY 79 the plantation economy model fails to explain or draw attention to. What we are offered instead is a simplistic notion of the modern-day multinational cor- poration as an updated version of the eighteenth century merchant, the former "replicating" many of the features of the latter (Girvan, 1973:18). The relation- ship between the international bourgeoisie through its local representatives (the managers of foreign-controlled firms and the agents of international or- ganizations) and the local bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie is not explored. There is a basic paradox in the model, for although it concentrates overwhelm- ingly on economic phenomena (in a rather selective way of course), external constraints are recognized only at the superstructural level in the form of cul- tural (taste pattern) and intellectual domination. That there might be some re- lationship between the constraints at the various levels seems to escape Best. Nor does it occur to him that the constraints he does acknowledge may reflect and be reinforced by the interests of the dominant local classes. The above discussion has dealt with the existence of classes and class interactions in peri- pheral capitalist countries such as Trinidad and Tobago in a very simplified way, but this was done in order to emphasize that the imperialist relationship could not be reproduced without the active involvement of groups in the peri- phery that represent class interests, though not in a simple and direct manner. BEST'S POLITICAL PROGRAM We now come to the question of the kind of conclusions for political action that might be drawn from the model. It could be argued that the model was formulated as a descriptive "value-free" analysis that merely provided a tech- nical basis on which action was to be premised - a kind of fact-finding mis- sion. The specific action itself would be determined by the ideological perspec- tive of the decisionmaker, whomever that might happen to be. But such value- free, clinically approved scholarship never really exists in the real world. One always starts off with a viewpoint of the world, an ideology - and more con- sciously so if scholar and prospective decisionmaker are one and the same person. The contention here is that the model of the plantation economy is essen- tially ideological and that the connection between Best's political program and the ideological perspective underlying the model is quite transparent. Leys (1976:7) notes that the mainstream of underdevelopment/dependency theory resulted in "radical structuralism." The structuralism that Best represents can- not, however, even be seen as radical. He sees capitalist development as not only possible but desirable and is thus firmly committed to bourgeois develop- mentalism or non-radical structuralism (see Leys, 1976:19 for an elaboration of these concepts). Hence Best's political program is anti-colonial and nationalis- tic (a kind of posturing which may now be regarded as outmoded) but not anti- capitalist. It is decidedly founded on the tenets of neo-classical economics, and it is firmly in the "liberal-democratic" political tradition. Once certain con- straints (never satisfactorily conceptualized) hindering transformation have been removed and decision making localized, all will be well. Who will even- tually make the decisions locally, we are not told explicitly, and perhaps for a very good reason - it is necessary that a populist illusion be created and main- tained. Nor does it seem necessary to explain how and through what local group or groups (classes do not exist in his scheme of things) are the taste patterns and institutional framework perpetuated, and how in fact change will be effected. That the capitalist framework is the most appropriate for develop- ment is inferred from the absence of any hint at positive restructuring of the economy and economic relationships. All that seems to be needed is a shift in the locus of decision making, and the restructuring will take care of itself. It Latin American Perspectives Issue 20, Winter 1979, Vol. Vlt No. 1</page><page sequence="16">80 LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES does not appear to occur to Best that inaccessibility to credit by local entrepre- neurs and agriculturalists, for example (a fact on which he laments so much), may be the result of the undiscriminating application of accepted capitalist cri- teria. If decision making is localized, it is not clear what effect this will have on the organization of production internally or what criteria will be used for es- tablishing external economic relationships by the new local managers to alter these facts. Nor can we guess how internal redistribution, if any, will be effect- ed. As noted earlier, the role of the state is, to say the least, nebulous in Best's formulation. Presumably it will be assigned the task of "holding the ring" and making technical adjustments while this "natural" process of restructuring takes place after the "removal" of constraints. If the above imponderables are viewed as problems, then passive, evolutionary solutions are the only ones which emerge from the model. As noted earlier, dependency theory of the bourgeois ECLA tradition is ex- tremely congenial to Caribbean dependency theorists. The obsession with poli- cy as an abstraction, conceived without its human dimension, is demonstrated by Sunkel (1973:134) who refers to "development policy" continuing "to attack the symptoms of underdevelopment" or "policy suggestions . . . with their need to change internal production structures . . . and institutional structures" (Girvan, 1973:10). This is the indirect method of change so favored by those committed to capitalism. Furtado could not have come closer to Lloyd Best's thinking in the following quotation, a long one but helpful in identifying the similarity of ideological viewpoints: Placing into the forefront the problem of the control of the system of decisions and of the appropriation of the fruits of technological progress . . . that is the problem of the political power and of its legitimation in terms of social interests - the center of the discussion displaces itself from the traditional dichotomy of private ownership vs. pub- lic ownership of the means of production. Such a dichotomy implicitly reduces political activity to reflex actions of the evolution of the economic infrastructure and favors a process of class interest confrontations of secondary importance in considering the structural problems covered herein. And, within the framework outlined, planning - far from being a coercive instrument - is transferred into a source of the legitimation of the power that the dominant enterprise exercises. The conciliation of an effective planning activity - without which the structural reforms are not to be achieved - together with a broad autonomy of decisions at the corporation level and within an authentic sense of the participation of the population in the social reconstruction efforts, is the greatest challenge facing political leadership (Furtado, 1979:134, my emphasis). Somehow there will be brought into being a magic mix of dominant national enterprises, an authentic sense of participation by the people, and an absence of class confrontation. Best has a similar dream and is no less emphatic as illustrated by these illuminating statements: Nor have we had feudalism or any dynamic class of national capitalists so there need not be any "socialists" or "communists." What is the meaning of "middle class"? In almost every family we can find represented the full spectrum from professional through artisan to labourer. Tapia [Best's political group] rejects all of these imported categories, and we seek to understand what is going on here in terms of Caribbean defi- nitions . . . And we make all kinds of fresh interpretations (Oxaal, 1975:45). What is taken to characterize the "middle class" is noteworthy for its lack</page><page sequence="17">SUDAMA: PLANTATION ECONOMY 81 of clarity and the associated naivete. That was in 1971. By 1976 the campaign against socialism had not abated - "You have a creed, a lifeless doctrine like socialism" (Trinidad Guardian, September 19,1976:13). It is thus clear what Best is ideologically opposed to, but he is less explicit about where he stands or what he stands for. The main aspects of his ideology must, therefore, be distilled from his political action program. Oxaal (1975:42) notes that localization and mass participation was to be its main thrust: "Lo- calization. . . was not to be understood as the same thing as nationalization or expropriation. The latter concepts were viewed as inappropriate borrowings by colonial radicals from the North Atlantic experience. It simply did not mat- ter whether the major industries in Trinidad were foreign companies or not so long as they performed in the way dictated by local people." The notion of foreign companies being dictated to by nationals of the country again has an air of naivete about it, but, as we will attempt to show later, there could be a rational explanation to the unrealistic position maintained. Additionally, Best's program envisages structural changes to induce the development of local pri- vate entrepreneurial intiative. But Trinidad's experience with reliance on pri- vate enterprise for development has not been a happy one. A disillusioned for- mer Deputy Prime Minister (himself committed to "private enterprise" and de- velopment within the capitalist framework) had this to say: "the major weakness of the development plan was its reliance on the private sector during the plan period to achieve too much of its own transformation" (Robinson, 1971:121). A final comment from Oxaal is enlightening: "Aside from the basic propo- sitions about the chief structural contradictions in the economy, the spirit of the Tapia approach was a free-wheeling, open-ended one" (1975:44). The ideol- ogy is now more visible. After all the promises of new definitions and fresh directions, the ideological prescription is capitalism, presumably of a local brand together with liberal democracy of a rather utopian, mass participation variety. But it would be capitalism unheralded and without fanfare, sold to the Trinidad and Tobago public under the guise of some populist charade. The present regime in Trinidad and Tobago, committed to a similar model of development (though not as nationalization-shy as Tapia), has brought a greater portion of the economy under its ownership and control than has any other regime in the Caribbean apart from Cuba. There has been more "local decision making" than ever before, and wide-ranging inducements are offered to local entrepreneurs. But there is no evidence of a commensurate degree of structural transformation. In the light of this fact, Best's persistence with his formula is at first puzzling. To understand what lies behind his ideological po- sition, one has to look at the geo-political situation of Trinidad and Tobago. The question would seem to focus on what one would, given the perspective of the average Caribbean intellectual, reasonably conceive to be the long-term prospects of a radical political program both in terms of its acceptability and its impleinentation. The overriding view of many seems to be that politics in the area has always been dictated by the need to be aware of the hemispheric ideological hegemony and the limits within which one can maneuver. For Best, the ideological framework is a given, and solutions, however exotically de- scribed, must be discussed and agreed upon within that overall geo-political structure, i.e. U.S. dominance. The ostensibly naive statements about foreign companies taking orders from local people or kinship ties negating class soli- darity can now be seen as serving simultaneously as a means of establishing ideological legitimacy externally and as part of a strategy to defuse or neutral- ize a potentially unmanageable situation internally. If one understands how heavily the experiences of British Guyana, Santo Domingo, or Jamaica in recent Latin American Perspectives: Issue 20, Winter 1979, Vol. VI, No. 1</page><page sequence="18">82 LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES times weigh on the minds of the majority of Caribbean politicians, and their overiding concern about not offending powerful external interests, one can more readily understand the ideological motivation which prompted Best to for- mulate his program. Indeed being guided by such an outlook is quite compati- ble with their inherited predispositions towards "peaceful change."
