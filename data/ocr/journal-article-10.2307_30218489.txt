Without them, no society or culture would exist, no "progress" be achieved, no art be created, nor could the heavens be mapped, the atom be explored, people be amused, angered, or uplifted, and human wisdom or folly be shared or preserved. How can a list of such diverse items be characterized? At first glance, it seems quite hopeless to find a common denominator. It is even difficult to find a name for them. They are not "things" or "objects" (although some of them are); they are not "acts" (although some of them are); they are not "language" (although most of them involve it). An important distinction should be made at the outset. The words and phrases on the list all designate situations in which some form of human behavior possessing special characteristics occurs. This special kind of activity we shall provisionally call "communication," and the words and phrases on our list may be said to refer to communication situations. But these terms also characterize many other kinds of human activities. A traffic signal, or a motion picture film, or a painting appear in a variety of human situations. They may, for example, be commodities with monetary value, and, as such, are bought and sold. They may be objects with weight and size which must be taken into account in trans- porting or storing them. In each of these situations the objects acquire different meanings-a tricky word which we will have to deal with later -because they elicit different kinds of behavior. Not only is the observ- able behavior different, but we may infer that the human attitude to- wards these objects are different. It is essential that the communicative situation not be confused with any other. By the term "situation" we mean that at a given time there exists a pattern of forces which has an over-all meaning that can be designated by a term or phrase. Since these are human situations, these forces are manifested in behavior patterns, or patterns of interaction between per- sons, that appear to have a certain consistency and may be the basis for predictions. These predictions or expectations may be accurate or inac- curate, depending on the insights of the predictor. And even the most stable situation has within it the possibility of change. We indicate this when we say that we expect the situation to improve or to deteriorate, to become less tense or to reach a crisis. Further, when we speak of these human situations, we note that they are polarized with respect to par- ticular factors, such as personalities, or issues, or physical conditions.</page><page sequence="3">80 AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW Such polarization means that these factors play a central role in deter- mining the character of all interacting behavior patterns, and especially the nature and course of social change. THE COMMUNICATION SITUATION In the case of the terms on our list, we have designated situations which have this unified character, and which are polarized around the thing, or act, or stimulus to which the term refers. Let us examine the list again and ask certain questions. What human purposes or ends are served in the situations designated by these terms? How are these pur- poses served? What is it that differentiates these from other situations in which social behavior occurs? In the first place, the items, as stimuli, are produced by human beings with the purpose of shaping or steering behavior in a particular direction, or establishing some sort of relationship between the producers of the stimuli and those who respond. There is much variation as to precision of direction in each situation. The traffic signal is relatively unambigu- ous, but the Constitution of the United States requires a Supreme Court to interpret its directions, and a poem may be even more vague. In any event they all serve as means to ends, rather than ends in themselves. Second, each item is responded to in terms of what it stands for. There are a number of confusing terms used to refer to stimuli that have this remarkable property. They are said, for example, to have meaning, to be symbols, signs, etc. Whatever the term used, it should be recognized that they elicit responses which imply significance beyond the object or the behavior itself, and that they are produced by a human agency. Third, these items establish a particular relationship between the per- sons who produce them and the persons who respond, but it is not a mechanical push-button or steering relationship. If modification of hu- man behavior is to occur there must be a shared meaning between the producer of the stimulus and the respondent. This is a transaction in which both parties must participate. George Mead, who laid the founda- tion for all subsequent work in this field, pointed out that if communica- tion is to occur between human beings both parties must be implicated. This means that the person who produces the sign or symbol must be able to respond to it in the same manner as the other person is expected to respond. This Mead calls "taking the attitude of the other." For exam- ple, the person who puts up a trail marker in the forest is not engaging in random activity-he expects other persons to react in a certain way,</page><page sequence="4">HUMAN COMMUNICATION 81 and he must be able to react as he expects others to respond. This is something about which we shall have more to say. Now we merely point out that in communication the producer of the stimulus (sign-symbol) always makes certain assumptions regarding the capacities and potenti- alities of the other person. These assumptions may be general or specific; they may turn out to be essentially correct or wholly wrong; but in the communication situation the producer of the stimulus must make them. He even makes assumptions about the needs or motives of those whose behavior he is trying to steer. In this commonality of response lies its "meaning." Without this sharing process through mediation of the spe- cial kind of stimuli called signs or symbols there is no communication and no socialized meaning. Finally, it should be noted that there is considerable variation in the responses which each stimulus is capable of eliciting. The response to a traffic signal will probably not show much variation, although a Navajo Indian who saw one for the first time would probably be puzzled. The responses to a symphony, a poem, or even a news broadcast may show enormous variability. The point of these observations is that responses to stimuli in communication situations are not automatic and mechani- cal, but are dependent on the totality of cultural and personality factors which each respondent brings to the situation. This last point is significant for a theory of communication because it makes untenable the widely held notion that communication is merely a transmission system. That conception, which is stated in many forms, implies that the communication process consists in the simple transmis- sion of "ideas," "information" or some other unit of meaning from the communicator to the communicatee, and that it is received intact. Or if it has not been received intact, it is said to have been affected by some sort of interference which resulted in distortion. In other words, the transmission-belt theory of communication in its simplest form assumes a simple linear, one-directional relationship between the communicator and the communicatee, subject only to interferences or disturbances analogous to those mechanical imperfections that would disturb or dis- tort communication over a telephone system. There is an imposing array of research findings, mainly in the field of the psychology of perception, which makes such a mechanical conception of communication unaccept- able. Rather, as will be shown later, the communicator and communica- tee are interdependent. It is a two-way relationship which cannot be adequately understood in terms of simple engineering or mechanical</page><page sequence="5">82 AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW analogies. It is a uniquely human relationship from which emerge all civilization and culture and without which man, as we know him, could not survive. It might be said that communication and communicative situations involve the individual in public relationships. The sign-symbol stimulus material enables individuals to share experiences. In communicating, I make public something that has hitherto been private. Generalizations Four generalizations regarding communication situations may now be made. (1) They are situations in which human beings enter into certain strategic relationships with each other or with their environment. (2) They are situations the central characteristic of which is the pro- duction and utilization of signs, symbols and symbolic acts. (3) They are situations which provide a maximal opportunity through the use of signs and symbols for the sharing of experience, achievement of goals, gaining of insight and, in general, mastering one's environment. (4) The sign or symbol material used in these situations is subject to the percep- tual processes of the individuals involved. Since the foregoing generalizations are condensed, they require some expansion. It is necessary, for example, to distinguish between those who produce symbolic material and those who react to it: the communi- cators and the interpreters. The symbolic material to which they both respond, though in different ways, is communication content. These terms will be more completely defined, and the dynamic interdependent relations between them will be more carefully examined. The terms strategic, sign, symbol, and mastering the environment, also require definition and elaboration. These are key concepts for the understanding of communication and what it does for human beings in their relations with each other and with their environments. Dynamics of Behavior; Structuring Reality In order to understand how communication situations function in human relations, it is necessary to introduce certain psychological con- cepts, especially those that are concerned with the dynamics of behavior. When we stand off and look at the larger aspects of our own or other people's behavior, the question most frequently raised is: What is the individual trying to do? Both the layman and psychologists can agree</page><page sequence="6">HUMAN COMMUNICATION 83 on a general answer. Human animals, and all other animals, are always striving for goals. The term "goal" can include such diverse things as a bit of cheese at the end of a rat maze, food in an icebox, making a good impression, getting an education, or understanding the structure of the atom. The pathways to these various goals are never wholly free from obstacles-delays, frustrations, and detours. As the individual con- fronts these obstructions, he must appraise them in the light of his pre- vious experiences and readjust or remarshal his resources in order to surmount them. Or, of course, he may turn to other goals. In other words, he adopts strategies, especially symbolic strategies. In perceiving obstacles and making adjustments in order to continue on the path to a goal, the individual is coming to terms with reality. In doing this, he utilizes whatever resources are available or that he be- lieves are available, in order to overcome, or remove, or get around, or even escape from the obstacles which confront him. Psychologically, this involves his "seeing" his situation in a particular perspective. He identifies the forces which are friendly or unfriendly to his course of action-whether correctly or incorrectly is beside the point. When he does all this, he is said to cognitively structure the situation. We may assume the basic postulate that individuals need to cognitively structure their "worlds" in order to live in them. In a sense, every situation pre- sents a problem to the individual. On the one hand, there are the external objective factors-objects, physical configurations of forces, "events," etc.-and on the other are the needs, values, beliefs, and attitudes of the individual himself, plus, of course, his perceptual apparatus (sense organs, neural mechanisms, etc.). This structuring may be simple or complex, adequate or inadequate, but it is always an action on the en- vironment, and its function, broadly speaking, is to bring about a degree of order or coherence as a necessary condition of action. There is another psychological concept that is useful for our purposes. This is the concept of tension. This refers to a characteristic of all human beings and, indeed, of all animals; namely that in their relations with the forces in the environment, they never achieve a state of absolute stability. A sort of temporary balance between all these forces may be reached, but, at best, it is precarious. There are always disturbances and unexpected changes in the environment, new needs to be served, and minor or major threats to one's course of action and goals. These and many other factors create a condition of mild or great disequilib- rium. This instability produces tension.</page><page sequence="7">84 AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW The importance of this concept from the point of view of behavior dynamics is that the individual is always striving to reduce his tensions. The need for cognitive structuring, sometimes called "the need for meaning," is, in reality, the need to establish a more stable structure and hence reduce tension. Krech and Crutchfield who have discussed the concept in some detail make this point clearly: ... the history of the psychological field of the individual does not involve a series of excursions away from a stable state and return to the same state. It is, rather, a history of changing equilibriums, in which the psychological field restructures con- tinuously, never returning to a state in which it existed before. Thus, an individual who, by achieving a certain goal, reduces the tension that initiates his action toward that goal, does not thereby become satisfied. His very achievement of the goal has so restructured his psychological field as to make possible all sorts of new instabili- ties and tensions, make desirable new kinds of goals, induce new aspirations, etc. (Italics added.) The structuring of a situation, then, serves not only to create a frame for some sort of action towards a goal; it also is tension-reductive. These tensional states may intrude themselves into consciousness in the form of feelings of restlessness, anxiety, or dissatisfaction. They may also, as Krech and Crutchfield point out, be reflected in a feeling that some particular aspect of the situation is especially important or desirable, or that the situation "demands" something-possibly action-from the individual. The structuring process is not necessarily a highly organized intellec- tual activity to which the term "conscious plan" should be applied. It may be automatic and instantaneous. This is illustrated by the simple act of picking up an object from the floor. Before it is picked up, the object is perceived as having certain phenomenal properties. It is per- ceived as movable, as possessing a certain weight and size; there must be anticipatory muscular adjustment before it is lifted. At a more complex level, the skilled billiard player makes a shot which, as an act, contains within it the anticipation of a whole series of precisely planned and complicated outcomes. That these structurizations may, in fact, turn out to be inaccurate or "wrong" is, of course, beside the point. When the structuring process is concerned with interactions between individuals, rather than between individuals and objects, it is more com- plicated and the assumptions are less certain, but its essential psycho- logical character is not changed. Yet even here, in the rapid adjustments which we are constantly making in our relations with other persons, there need not be much in the way of conscious analysis or planning.</page><page sequence="8">HUMAN COMMUNICATION 85 The most characteristic feature of our structurization of other indi- viduals with whom we are in any way involved is the imputation of motives. We ascribe motives as a basis for our assumptions as to how the other person will respond to us. As a premise for our own behavior, it is necessary to perceive the other person as possessing certain motives, beliefs, attitudes, or interests. This characteristic is the basis for all human relations and is central to certain situations. For example, the applicant who is being inter- viewed by a prospective employer is concerned with making a good impression. To do this he attempts to size up the potential employer's personality traits. He has to assume that he is a certain kind of person with certain likes and dislikes, and he adjusts his strategy in the light of these assumptions. This is a special case in which there is a particular premium on "reading" the motives behind the fagade, but, in some degree, this occurs in all human social relations. Communication, even that which is brief and casual, could not occur without it. We sustain our position in the social fabric by making assumptions about what is going on in the mind of what George Mead has called "the other." Value System and Perception In these structuring activities it will be noted that the values, beliefs, and attitudes of the individual play an important role. Within certain limits we "see" what our interests, beliefs and values determine us to see. The part played in perception by the value system of the individual has recently received much attention from social psychologists. For example, the investigation of Postman, Bruner and McGinnies showed that words which had a high value for a subject were more speedily recognized than those of low value. The investigators hypo- thesize that the value-orientation of the individual sensitizes him to certain external stimuli. When the stimulus is congruent with the value- orientation of the subject and his threshold is lowered for it, these inves- tigators term the process perceptual resonance. When the value-orienta- tion acts as a barrier and prevents the individual from perceiving certain aspects of his environment, the process is termed perceptual defense. Such studies make it clear that perceiving is not merely photographic. Rather, the "world out there" is perceived in terms of the perceiver. This means that it is perceived as friendly or unfriendly, pleasant or un- pleasant, and so on through the whole gamut of values and meanings. There is, however, a limit to the meanings which can be projected out-</page><page sequence="9">86 AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW ward. The world out there has its own organization. It is filled with objects and people that have structure, shape, contour, size, solidarity and, unless we are hallucinated, these may not be evaded. They are the so-called structural factors in perception. The relative importance of these two sets of factors-the social or functional and the structural- and how they work together need not concern us here. The outcome of this combined operation is that we orient ourselves in the world so that we act in accordance with our needs as persons and its character as tangible reality. In brief, we do not simply react to a world of things which are "there." Rather, we establish very complicated, interdependent relationships be- tween the world out there and ourselves as organisms with needs, values, and attitudes. A meaningful behavioral environment is one so structured that it is congruent with "reality," on the one hand, and the needs and disposition of the organism, on the other. We create our environment as we go along. Tensions mount and are reduced; goals conscious or un- conscious, are achieved, and new goals emerge. As organisms with needs and purposes operating in an environment which may be recalci- trant, or, at best, indifferent, we utilize whatever strategies of wit or insight we possess in coming to terms with it. We must assume that the environment in which we are acting or expect to act has certain charac- teristics. We must presuppose that other individuals have certain motives or characteristics, that events, expected or unexpected have certain "causes," that forces about us are friendly or hostile, that "things" can be utilized in certain ways, and that they possess specific physical characterisitcs. It is clear that the individual's perceptual-cognitive transactions with the world "out there," the world of things, is not simple. A distinction made by some psychologists-notably, Werner, Scheerer, Koffka, and Arnheim-may be useful. Werner, for example, distinguishes between "geometric-technical" and "physiognomic" perception. As distinct from the geometric-technical mode of perceiving, physiognomic perception is a mode of cognition in which the external world is directly apprehended as expressing its own inner form of life. It is, according to Werner, a "dynamization of things based on the fact that objects are predominantly understood through the motor and affective attitude of the subject. ... A landscape may be seen suddenly as expressing a certain mood . .. it may be gay or melancholy or pensive." Basically, in its pure form (if such exists) it is a mode of perception in which the distinction between</page><page sequence="10">HUMAN COMMUNICATION 87 the perceiver and the thing perceived is lost. The me and the not-me are fused. There is evidence that this type of perceiving is especially charac- teristic of children and of people in the so-called primitive cultures. At the other end of the perceptual continuum is the geometric-tech- nical mode which sharply separates the perceiver from what is perceived. This is the mode of "objective" science. It is based on the assumption that the external world may be described by a neutral observer who is able to exclude his own feelings, attitudes, and beliefs from his percep- tion. This mode is highly sanctioned in our society, and the physiog- nomic mode is systematically discouraged. Significance of Metaphor That the physiognomic mode is never eliminated is evidenced by the omnipresent metaphor in our language behavior. The intimate rela- tion between language and perceptual-cognitive processes receives its most powerful expression in verbal metaphor. The psychological basis of metaphorical reference is the cognition of one thing in terms of some- thing else. I. A. Richards characterizes metaphor in terms which are essentially physiognomic: I . . . include as metaphoric, those processes in which we perceive or think of or feel about one thing in terms of another-as when looking at a building it seems to have a face and to confront us with a peculiar expression. I want to insist that this sort of thing is normal in full perception and that study of the growth of our perceptions (the animistic world of the child and so on) shows that it must be so. Richards' assumptions regarding the development of perception are supported by the studies of Murphy and Hochberg. They note that in primitive stages, perception is "inextricably fused with the motion, posi- tion, and feeling state of the observer." Even in the laboratory where every effort is made to rule out the "subjective" variable, it is impossible to separate completely the affective-conative processes of the observer. It is a reflection of the geometric-technical emphasis in our culture that verbal metaphor (and not all metaphors are verbal) is commonly regarded as merely poetic embroidery. But if physiognomic perception and the related metaphoric expression are as fundamentally related to the human way of apprehending the world as the studies of Piaget, Werner, Murphy and Hochberg, and others seem to indicate, the at- tempts at purely objective description may interfere with the basic cre- ative nature of human cognition. That is, the capacity to become aware of the underlying relationships in the apparently confused flood of un-</page><page sequence="11">88 AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW related impressions which impinge on our sense organs from the outside world is a necessary part of creative thinking. This process is central to the human animal's transaction with his environment. This, plus the closely related capacity, the use of symbolic processes to share our aware- ness with others, lies at the basis of both art and science. Science has always used metaphorical description. The great scientific metaphors of science and philosophy have been extremely fruitful in generating hypotheses which may or may not have been empirically verified: for example, man is a machine; at birth, the mind is a tabula rasa on which experience writes; society and personality are structured; a current of electricity; field theory. We may underscore Arnheim's statement: "It is the function of the metaphor to make the reader penetrate the con- crete shell of the world of things by combinations of objects that have little in common but the underlying pattern." It is clear that the "reality" with which we grapple cannot be fully understood in terms of the external physical elements. Perceptual-cog- nitive processes always organize and unify. To this the organism makes a preponderant and inescapable contribution. The most common verbal expression of this is in the form of verbal metaphors, but the underlying dynamisms of experience are not limited to language. Non-linguistic metaphors are found in all visual art, in stage design, in photographs, motion pictures, and, in fact, in any representation or arrangement of objects, animate or inanimate, which has human significance. In the Olivier production of Richard III there is a scene in which the two princes meet at the end of a vast hall. The one boy runs across the hall to clasp his arms around his brother; they cower together on an immense throne. The size of the hall and the two boys alone at the end of it express a terrible isolation which is enhanced by the presence of the sinister Richard and his companions lurking in the background. By purely visual means without the aid of speech, the configuration of hos- tile forces closing in on the princes is expressed in essentially metaphori- cal terms. It must be made clear, an Arnheim points out, that a weeping willow tree does not look sad because it looks like a sad person. "It is more ade- quate to say that since the shape, direction, and flexibility of willow branches convey the expression of passive hanging, a comparison with the structurally similar state of mind and body that we call sadness imposes itself secondarily." It is not necessary to describe this process in terms of the "pathetic fallacy," anthropomorphism, or personification,</page><page sequence="12">HUMAN COMMUNICATION 89 nor is it based on similarities and analogies. The organism, as Arnheim points out, is primarily "interested in the forces that are active around it-their place, strength, direction. Hostility and friendliness are attri- butes of forces. And the perceived impact of forces makes for what we call expression." This is perception in depth. WHAT IS THE REAL WORLD? In Mark Twain's satirical story of a Connecticut Yankee who is trans- ported to King Arthur's Court, there is a scene which amusingly depicts how differently two people may perceive the same objects. The matter- of-fact Yankee, Sir Boss, accompanied by the highly imaginative and talkative girl, Sandy, are approaching the end of a long quest for the castle in which, according to an accepted story, forty-five princesses were held prisoners by three giant ogres. But what do the twentieth century Yankee and the girl of sixth century Britain see? The girl speaks: 'The castle! The castle! Lo, where it looms!' What a welcome disappointment I experienced! I said: 'Castle? It is nothing but a pigsty; a pigsty with a wattled fence around it.' She looked surprised and distressed. The animation faded out of her face; and during many moments she was lost in thought and silent. Then: 'It was not enchanted aforetime,' she said in a musing fashion, as if to herself. 'And how strange is this marvel, and how awful-that to the one perception it is enchanted, yet to the perception of the other it is not enchanted, hath suffered no change, but stands firm and stately still, girt with its moat and waving its banners in the blue air from its towers. And God shield us, how it pricks the heart to see again these gracious captives, and the sorrow deepened in their sweet faces!' I saw my cue. The castle was enchanted to me, not to her. It would be wasted time to try to argue her out of her delusion, it couldn't be done; I must just humor it. So I said: 'This is a common case-the enchanting of a thing to one eye and leaving it in its proper form to another. You have heard of it before, Sandy, though you haven't happened to experience it. But no harm is done. In fact, it is lucky the way it is. If these ladies were hogs to everybody and to themselves, it would be necessary to break the enchantment, and that might be impossible if one failed to find the particular process of the enchantment. And hazardous, too; for in attempting a disenchantment without the true key, you are liable to err, and turn your hogs into dogs.... But here, by good luck, no one's eyes but mine are under the enchant- ment, and so it is of no consequence to dissolve it. These ladies remain ladies to you, and to themselves, and to everybody else; and at the same time they will suffer in no way from my delusion, for when I know that an ostensible hog is a lady, that is enough for me, I know how to treat her.' 'Thanks, oh, sweet my lord, thou talkest like an angel. And I know that thou wilt deliver them. ... 'I will not leave a princess in a sty, Sandy. Are those three yonder that to my distorted eyes are starveling swineherds-</page><page sequence="13">90 AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW 'The ogres? Are they changed also? It is most wonderful. Now am I fearful; for how canst thou strike with sure aim when five of their nine cubits of stature are to thee invisible? Ah, go warily, fair sir, this is a mightier emprise than I wend.' It is indeed! A question that is almost certain to inject itself at this point is: To what extent does the "world" that is the result of structuring process differ from the "real" world? Or, in the case of Mark Twain's characters, which of the two perceptions of the "castle", the "ogres", and their high-born prisoners was the "true" one? They are clearly not the same. The answer need not be a metaphysical discourse on the nature of ultimate reality. In terms of the problems with which we are here concerned, the simplest answer is that there are not two worlds, one of illusion and one -that is "real." There is one world-the world the individual lives in, bends to his needs, has relations with other persons in, loves in, and dies in. For our purposes it is sufficient to assume that both man and the world in which he lives are organizations of material energies. The striking thing, and that which furnishes the psychologist with most of his problems, is that the organization of material energies which we call man not only reacts to this world but, in the various ways we have described, on it. He manipulates it and constantly recreates it. Psychologically there is not just one world, but many worlds. The critical question is: How are they related? It is at this point that the problem of "reality" becomes acute. The world or environment created by human activities is not only a world of things; it is a world of meanings and significations. The dog that is my pet is a much loved creature with a thousand engaging ways and a per- sonality all his own. To me, my neighbor's dog is an unpleasant creature with annoying habits and a mean disposition. To a third person, the two animals are just dogs which he has difficulty in telling apart. Which of these are the real dogs? The answer is that the two dogs as stimulus objects are structured in different ways by different individuals, each with his special need-value-belief system. The resultant structurizations are real because they have real or objective effects on behavior. Stimulus Fields-Behavioral and Geographic It is possible, and indeed necessary, to distinguish between these "worlds" without assuming that one is real and the others imaginary. The scientific study of these different "worlds" may require different method- ologies, different terminologies, and different conceptualizations, but we</page><page sequence="14">HUMAN COMMUNICATION 91 must not beg the question by assuming that some are real and some are not. A distinction that has proved useful to the psychologist is that between the behavioral stimulus field and the geographic stimulus field. This is a distinction roughly equivalent to that made earlier between the functional and structural factors in perception. The behavioral stim- ulus field is the field as the individual "sees" it; in its simplest form the "seeing" is physiogenic. An analysis of this field will probably employ such terms as "meaning," "needs," "values," "beliefs," "cognitive struc- turing," and the like. These are psychological terms. They characterize aspects of the internal dynamics of individuals. Although they present difficulties of observation and measurement, they are none the less real. The geographic environment exists, presumably, independently of the structuring process. The description of this environment will employ the terminology of the physical sciences or the language of everyday life. The resulting descriptions give us another picture of reality without which modern man cannot survive, and paradoxically, with which he may destroy himself. These various pictures of reality are illustrated in the example of the dog. He is my pet, but he is also a complex organization of energies-a physio-chemical machine-which the physiologist, chemist, and many other scientific specialists may describe, each in his own jargon. He may be described also by the social psychologist in terms of the role of pets in western culture, or by the economist who is interested in the propor- tion of the American family income (or my income!) which goes to maintain pets. He is also my pet, and unlike any other dog in the world. "Behaviorally"-speaking, he is a different dog for each of these specialists, including myself. "Geographically"-speaking, he is the same dog. All these descriptions present significant aspects of the animal, and, geo- graphically or behaviorally, he is certainly a "real" dog. Let us consider another example. A town is a place where a number of people work and live. It is an environment which has been created by these people. Geographically, it is on a map, occupies a given terrain which has particular physical features, and has a certain configuration of streets on which are buildings of various shapes and sizes. Behavior- ally, it is a different environment for each person who lives in it. In a real sense, each individual creates it. He sees it in terms of his personal interests, needs, and experience. Some have been residents since its be- ginnings-the old timers and pioneers; others are newcomers, and some are merely passing through. Some people live on the "right" side of the</page><page sequence="15">92 AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW tracks, and some on the "wrong" side. To some it is perceived in ro- mantic, sentimental or nostalgic terms. To others, the town is a place of struggle and failure. No two persons see it in quite the same way, and the divergencies may be very great. It is apparent that the town as geographic environment-which seems so stable and "real"-is permissive of a variety of behavioral environ- ments. In this sense, it is ambiguous-as, indeed, the geographic environ- ment always is. To attempt to transcend these ambiguities by charac- terizing the geographic environment as the only real environment is both futile and naive, and will lead to serious social consequences. To do so, for example, implies that all the people in the town are suffering from delusions. It is extremely important to know more about these different environments, how they are created, how much they overlap, and under what conditions they change. An example of a scientific approach to a problem of this sort is found in such studies as Middletown by the Lynds, Plainville USA by West, and Elmstown's Youth by Hollingshead. By using special techniques of observation and analysis, a town as a community of people carrying on widely diverse activities, pursuing a variety of goals, and having a variety of backgrounds and social attitudes, is described. Such a study, if con- ducted by competent persons, yields a picture of the community which is different from that of any non-scientific person who happens to live in it. Such studies are extremely useful since, among other things, they give us a set of reference points with which we can compare other more naive descriptions. Their "reality" depends on the extent to which objective reliable methods were used by the investigator. He must be careful not to think of the various behavioral environments as errors, mistakes, delusions, or distortions of some ultimate reality. But the problem of discrepancies between these environments is prac- tically and theoretically important. If these discrepancies are great, human relations will be seriously disturbed, and the social outcomes may be disastrous. This is true because structurization, as we have noted, is always the basis for action. The corrective lies in the fact that discrepant environments may always be cognitively re-structured so as to reduce the discrepancies, and hence, the tensions. Communicative techniques, because they demand at least a degree of sharing, play the dominant role in this process. When these techniques break down, or become seri- ously impaired, the result is that the "worlds" (behavioral environ- ments) of individuals become isolated, the correctives which would</page><page sequence="16">HUMAN COMMUNICATION 93 normally reduce the discrepancies are not utilized, and the results, in- dividually or globally, are likely to be catastrophic. Underlying Attitudes and Interpretation An experiment reported by Eberhart and Bauer makes a significant contribution to these problems. These investigators were interested in discovering how beliefs and attitudes affect the interpretation or under- standing of an event after it has occurred. They investigated the way in which a dramatic event with high emotional loading was recalled. In order to understand the relevance of this procedure to the present dis- cussion, it should be stated that the need-value systems of individuals show themselves in how they remember events, as well as in the way they are structured at the time of occurrence. Forgetting (or remember- ing), like perceiving, is a dynamic process in which the individual retro- spectively structures a situation in terms of his needs and values. The event which Eberhart and Bauer utilized occurred in Chicago in 1937, and has since been referred to as the Memorial Day Massacre. On this day a clash occurred between police and strikers and strike sympathizers near the Republic Steel Plant. Ten strikers were killed, 90 others were injured-many by gunfire-and 35 police were injured. The incident received national attention, and the newspaper accounts of what occurred differed widely from each other, and from the report made later by the LaFollette investigating Committee of the U. S. Senate. The discrepancies between the accounts in the Chicago Tribune and the report of the Senate Committee were especially marked. These centered around three points: (1) what the crowd did, (2) what the police did, and (3) whether the crowd was armed. It was on these points that Eber- hart and Bauer concentrated their study. They constructed a question- naire in which the respondents were asked to indicate which version they believed most accurately described what happened. Two and a half years after the event a group of 177 stuldents at Northwestern University filled out the questionnaire and also indicated the newspaper from which they secured their information. The alternatives that were presented to them, the response most frequently chosen, the version that had appeared in the Chicago Tribune, and the findings of the Senate Committee are given in Table 1. Regarding the action of the crowd, 55 percent of the students selected response b. Regarding the action of the police, 71 percent selected choice a. Regarding the possession of arms, 87 percent of the students failed</page><page sequence="17">94 AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW to select the Chicago Tribune version, but in this instance agreed with the Senate Committee findings. The pattern of responses varied, but more than 40 percent reported, "The crowd intended to invade the plant and drive out the strike-breakers; the police acted in self-defense and to protect the rights of property; and the crowd carried objects which might be used for weapons, but were not armed for battle," This may be com- pared with the Senate Committee version-alternatives a, c, and c. TABLE 1-INTERPRETATION OF AN EVENT Chicago Senate Student Tribune Committee Selection Version Report 1. The crowd a. intended to establish a peaceful picket line outside the plant gate X b. intended to invade the plant and drive out the strikebreakers X X c. intended to attack the police 2. The police a. acted in self defense and to protect the rights of property X X b. deliberately and brutally shot down peaceful citizens c. on slight but in- sufficient provo- cation attacked a group of defenseless men and women X 3. The crowd a. was armed with pistols, baseball bats and meat hooks, and advanced in mili- tary formation. X b. was completely unarmed c. carried some objects which might be used for weapons but were not armed for battle X X To test whether there was any relationship between the pattern of recall of such an event and underlying attitudes and usual sources of</page><page sequence="18">HUMAN COMMUNICATION 95 information, the students were given another questionnaire, the results of which were illuminating. Over 66 percent opposed the idea of workers as a potentially dominant group; they read only conservative magazines and newspapers, usually including the Tribune. There was a close rela- tionship between the three variables, general attitude, sources of infor- mation, and the way a specific event was recalled. To test these findings further, the investigators obtained results on the strike questionnaire from students in three Pacific Coast colleges and one New England college. In this questionnaire there was no mention of the Memorial Day incident as such. The subjects were merely told that it was a strike that occurred several years earlier, and were asked to indicate what they thought had probably occurred. In three of the four groups the same pattern of responses occurred. In one Pacific Coast college the results deviated sharply. Here 45 percent chose the a, c, and c-pattern-the Senate Committee findings. This deviation seemed to be explained by the fact that the students in this group were completing a course in social psychology in which there had been considerable em- phasis on stereotyped thinking with respect to social phenomena. Other- wise, as Eberhart and Bauer note, it is significant that "student groups, one to three thousand miles apart . . . return almost identical group answers." Whether the incident was identified or not seemed to have little effect on the versions they are willing to accept regarding what happened in a situation involving violence between police and strikers. We have considered this experiment in some detail because it throws light on several aspects of our problem. In the first place, it throws into relief the relationships between "real- ity" and the perception of reality. The searcher for truth is bound to ask: "What really happened? What are the facts?" There were some brute facts: ten persons (strikers) were killed, 90 injured, and 35 police were injured. But much more is demanded: what were the intentions of the crowd? the police? who was armed? We move away from the relatively meaningless "facts" to the underlying dynamics of a situation. Who did what to whom? Why? What made people behave in this manner? Who is to blame? At this point, structuring processes as determined by need-value sys- tem begin to operate, and the situation becomes ambiguous; that is, it permits different interpretations to be made. Can the "facts" be deter- mined? In the case of the study we have been describing, a painstaking sifting of eye-witness stories resulted in an approximation of the "facts."</page><page sequence="19">96 AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW Presumably, this was done by the U. S. Senate Committee investigation. The "facts" which they finally reported, however, are still only approxi- mations. If careful comparisons between eye-witness accounts are made, if specific criteria of reliability and objectivity are established and ap- plied, the result might be a description which may have a number of important uses, but it only approaches a description of the behavioral environment which is absolutely "objective." Stereotypes and Perception In the second place, the study reveals that there are certain stable structurizations which are widely distributed and which function more or less independently of the actual situation. These are related to under- lying attitudes, are relatively rigid, and operate in such a manner that certain situations or events, regardless of their objective characteristics, are structured alike. In the study just described, it appears that individuals, whether the situation is specifically identified or not, have, so to speak, ready-made structurizations which "tell" them how certain situations will be pat- terned. These ready-made structurizations are sometimes called stereo- types. Stereotypes express the social appraisals and attitudes which the individual has acquired as a member of a particular class or group. They have two important psychological characteristics: (1) they serve to protect and support the existing status, privileges, or advantages of the individual or the group; and (2) they are highly resistant to modifica- tion. As regards the second characteristic, in extreme cases they may persist in the face of total contradiction from the geographic environ- ment. In such a case, of course, they take on the character of delusions and become highly maladaptive. While stereotyping is potentially dan- gerous since it prevents the individual from freely structuring each situation he confronts, it may, within definite limits, serve a useful func- tion in providing the individual with a kind of psychological shorthand for quick appraisals of situations. Stereotypes are, of course, only a special case of cognitive structuring. Characteristics of Structuring Process It will be useful to point out the more important implications of the structuring process from the point of view of the individual acting in an environment. We may first attempt a provisional definition. The term structuring refers to all the activities of an individual at a given moment</page><page sequence="20">HUMAN COMMUNICATION 97 in isolating, organizing, understanding, and perceiving his environment in order to come to terms with it so as to pursue his goal or goals in it. From the point of view of understanding human behavior in general, and communication situations in particular, the following are the more important characteristics of the process: 1. The relationship between the individual and his environment is an interdependent one. He reacts to and on the environment which is "out there" in terms of his demands on it and its demands on him. This reac- tion to and on the environment is conceived to depend primarily on organizing tendencies within the individual to which the term structur- ing is applied. In structuring the environment the individual isolates, selects, and interprets those features which appear to be related to what- ever needs at the moment he is trying to satisfy. 2. In structuring the environment, the individual attributes to it a variety of characteristics and potentialities, and insofar as it contains other persons, he attributes to them motives and capacities. He himself adopts attitudes towards the environment, based on his system of values and beliefs. These values, beliefs, and attitudes may be derived from his personal experience, his membership in a culture, his group member- ships, his occupation, his position in the class structure, etc. Whatever their source, they have been interiorized in the individual. They are uniquely his. 3. In structuring the environment, the individual makes use of a variety of devices among which symbols and symbolic acts are especially important. These will be discussed in more detail later. For the present discussion, their important characteristic is that they are produced and manipulated by the individual not as ends in themselves, but as a means of directing his own and other persons' behavior. 4. The structuring process is essentially creative. In isolating, select- ing, and interpreting aspects of the environment, the individual is, in effect, producing a new situation. He may bring aspects of the environ- ment into relationships which have not previously existed. His capacity to use symbols, as we shall see later, is especially important in this con- nection. The relationships which appear in the structuring process may be regarded as emergent gestalten, not merely additive combinations of existing features. The individual may be said to perceive relationships which have not hitherto been perceived. 5. A result of the selective aspect of the structurizations is that cer- tain features or aspects of the external environment acquire a "demand"</page><page sequence="21">98 AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW character. This means that they have acquired a stimulus value, have "insistence" for the organism which is not necessarily dependent on their physical intensity. These aspects may be perceived as attractive or repellent, but, in any case, they exert a control over behavior. 6. These selective processes, based as they are on the need-value- belief system of the individual, make him susceptible to some features of the environment and not to others. The individual may be said to be vulnerable to those aspects of the situation which are, or appear to be, relevant to the needs and values that are dominant at the moment. This is sometimes called "interest." Kenneth Burke puts it this way: "It is not hard to imagine that if a grasshopper could speak he would indicate more interest in what you had to tell him about 'Birds That Eat Grass- hoppers' than in a more scholarly talk on 'Mating Habits of the Au- stralian Auk.' " This conception of "interest" is particularly important in understanding responses in communication situations which involve propaganda. 7. The cognitive structures of the individual tend to maintain them- selves even in the face of changes in the external situation. This persist- ence results in stability and consistency of the individual's behavior, but the structures may become so rigid that changes in the environment which are contradictory are not perceived at all. The term "stereotype" is applied to those structurizations which determine the way in which individuals in one group perceive individuals in another. Stereotypes are highly resistant to change, and in general, serve to maintain the status, privileges, and powers of the members of the group against threats or presumed threats of other groups. 8. The geographic situation in which the individual is reacting is always to some extent ambiguous, and therefore, as Luchins has sug- gested, may be susceptible to a number of structurizations, or to a few, or to only one. In other words, the external environment has degrees of permissiveness in regard to structurization. The Rorschach ink-blots are examples of stimuli which are in this sense highly ambiguous. Novel, unexpected, or threatening events are usually ambiguous. At this point the reader might refer to the listing of situations with which this paper began. And, we may ask, where has this relatively long excursion into behavior dynamics brought us, and what contribution has it made to our understanding of those situations? A characteristic of all the situations was that in them individuals, through a variety of tech- niques, were engaged in "mastering" their environments. Most of the</page><page sequence="22">HUMAN COMMUNICATION 99 succeeding discussion has been concerned with the psychological mech- anisms involved. In the broadest sense, this is a strategic operation that involves the establishment of a working relationship between the needs, goals, and values of individuals, on the one hand, and the objective environment, on the other. This is a creative process and the term "struc- turing" is applied to it. SYMBOLIC STRATEGIES Strategy is a military term. It is defined as the "science and art of military command, exercised to meet the enemy in combat under ad- vantageous conditions." Metaphorically, we may apply the term to any organization of means to achieve ends. In this sense, strategy refers to all the forces which an organism utilizes in coming to terms with its environment. This includes the utilization not only of things and objects to achieve some goal, but much more importantly, the subtle organiza- tion of man's symbolic resources. It is the symbol, as Leslie White points out which transformed our anthropoid ancestors into men and made them human. .... It is the symbol which transforms an infant homo sapiens into a human being. ... All behavior consists of, or is dependent upon, the use of symbols. Human behavior is symbolic behavior; symbolic behavior is human behavior. In an illuminating paragraph in Permanance and Change, Kenneth Burke points out that all organisms are "critics" in the sense that they interpret the signs about them. They learn to discriminate between food and non-food, or between the potentially dangerous and potentially friendly aspects of the environment. But, Burke says: . . the experimental, speculative technique made available by speech would seem to single out the human species as the only one possessing an equipment for going beyond the criticism of experience to a criticism of criticism. We not only interpret the characters of events (manifesting in our response all the gradations of fear, apprehension, misgiving, expectation, assurance for which there are rough behavior- istic counterparts in animals-we may also interpret our interpretations. The word "symbol," like most words, has acquired an aura of mean- ings, some of which make it a suspect term. Kenneth Burke rejects the word because it usually implies the unreality of the world in which we live, as though nothing could be what it is, but always be something else, as though a house could never be a house, but must be, let us say, the concealed surrogate for a woman, or as though the woman one marries could never be the woman one marries, but must be a sur- rogate for one's mother, etc.</page><page sequence="23">100 AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW This identification of symbols with the unreal or fictitious is wide- spread and suggests to many that symbolic processes are not only unreal but even pathological. This interpretation is present, of course, in psy- choanalysis. We are not here concerned with such special usage, except to point out that placing the symbolic process in the realm of the unreal introduces a distortion that is paradoxical. Rather than linking symbols with unreality "as though nothing could be what it is, but must always be something else," it would be a truer statement to say that nothing could be what it is except as it may be designated by symbols. However, it is obvious-as Burke later points out-that there is an important difference between building a house and writing a poem about building a house. There is a difference between the architect's blueprints and the finished house. These distinctions are real, but they should not be made the basis of an unwarranted dichotomy between reality and unreality. The world of symbols is preeminently the world of man; it is not a world of illusion. Symbols are as real as bathtubs, and the be- havior which makes use of them is as real as the behavior which does not. Rather than being concerned with the pseudo-problem of the reality behind symbols, the important thing is to remember that man uses sym- bols as a means of getting along in the world. They are an inescapable part of all his transactions with his fellows and with his environment; they have no reality or meaning apart from these transactions. He didn't invent language as a game. Whenever or wherever man is found in his present biological form, language and symbol systems of one kind or another already exist. They are being used as other tools are used, as a means of getting along in his world. In nearly all discussions of these problems a distinction is made between signs (sometimes called signals) and symbols (sometimes called signs). The sound of rain on the roof is said to be a sign of rain, and is interpreted as an indication that rain is falling. The flush on a person's face may be interpreted as an indication of anger. In each case the stimulus is interpreted as an indication of a state or condition beyond itself. However, a much more complicated process is involved when we talk about rain. Here a verbal sign is pro- duced in place of another sign (the sound of rain or the sight of rain) and a science of meteorology becomes possible. The produced sign is a symbol which, following Morris, may be defined as a sign produced by its interpreter that acts as a substitute for another sign with which it is synonymous.</page><page sequence="24">HUMAN COMMUNICATION 101 Characteristics of Symbols The distinction between signs and symbols is not always easy to make, and there are many borderline cases that are difficult to classify. Broadly speaking, signs occur naturally. For example, a person lost in a forest may interpret a column of smoke on the horizon as an indication of fire and possible human habitation. This is clearly a sign. If the fire has been built with the intent of producing smoke as a sign to another individual, it is a symbol. The symbolic character becomes clearer if we assume that by pre-arrangement the interpreter and producer of the fire have agreed that smoke of different qualities, shades, etc., have particular significa- tions; they become a code which either party may utilize. The pre- arrangement may involve only two persons, or it may be implicit in the culture of a large number of individuals. Symbols have three characteristics which have profound significance for their use in communication: (1) They are produced by human agents-there is no convincing evidence that sub-human animals pro- duce and utilize symbols; (2) they have communicative significance only insofar as the communicators and communicatees have previously agreed on their meanings; (3) they are produced with intent to structure situations in which the parties have or are assumed to have a common interest. It will be noted that these characteristics rule out many complex signs to which organisms react in nature. Bees, for example, as shown in the studies of von Frisch, on returning to a hive leave traces which serve as directions to other bees as to the location of pollen-bearing flowers. As Schneirla has shown, this process resembles symbol usage in human communication only superficially. Someone has shrewdly observed that the bees cannot lie. This points up the basic distinction between com- munication through the use of symbols and behavioral interchange among animals by means of signs. Symbols are manipulable (and there- fore less reliable), are subject to intent, and may be used in a variety of contexts. Symbols are central to the communicative process. In the context of communication, symbol meanings are public, not private, since their usage depends on a pre-arranged agreement between two or more per- sons. Those concerned may be said to constitute a communicative com- munity. The whole question of precision is here involved. The degree of agreement as to the signification of symbols may be conceived as a con- tinuum which extends from a theoretically perfect agreement to complete</page><page sequence="25">102 AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW lack of agreement. In the second case, of course, there is no communica- tion. Much time and ink is spent in our society in the endeavor to make symbol meanings completely unambiguous. In certain symbol commu- nities-mathematics, for instance-a very high degree of precision may be achieved. Psychologically, however, a degree of ambiguity is implicit in all symbol usage. This is due to the fact that the cognitive-perceptual processes in two individuals are rarely, if ever, identical. Since the sym- bol content of communications is perceived, a degree of imprecision is practically inescapable. The signification of the storm-warnings hoisted by the Coast Guard are relatively precise for the symbol community which is concerned, but even here they may be misperceived. Imprecision is not inherent in the symbolic material itself, but is a function of the degree to which the producer and the interpreter of the material share each others' perceptual-cognitive world. This conception is basic to the formulations of George Mead. Com- munication by language or other significant symbols is part of a con- tinuously changing social process. In using symbols each individual has to understand what he is saying; that is, he has to affect himself as he affects others. This contradicts the popular notion that meanings may be attached or detached from symbols at the will of the person who uses them. For Mead, there are no meanings or ideas that are not shared with other persons. The sharing is a behavior process that begins when indi- vidual A makes a gesture-for example, uses a word-to which he must incipiently react as he expects individual B to react. All meanings emerge from this social process and in no other way. Having acquired meanings and ideas-that is, significant symbols-through social interactions, the individual may use them "privately." That is, he may talk to himself or "think." But initially the significance of the symbols came through social intercourse. All human thinking, imagining, persuading, moralizing-in fact, all activity involving symbols-is, from Mead's point of view, an unending conversation that men carry on with each other and with themselves. Burke makes an effective statement in regard to this when he discusses the origin of symbolic materials. Symbols, he says, appear in the unending conversation that is going on at the point in history when we are born. Imagine you enter a room. You come late. Others have long preceded you, and they are engaged in a heated discussion, a discussion too heated for them to pause and tell you what it is about. . . . You listen for a while, until you decide you have caught the tenor of the argument, then you put in your oar. Some one answers; you</page><page sequence="26">HUMAN COMMUNICATION 103 answer him; another comes to your defense; another aligns himself against you ... the discussion is interminable. The hour grows late, you must depart. And you do depart, with the discussion still vigorously in progress. Some imaginary situations may clarify these relationships. Situation I: A man and a little boy are walking on a road past an apple orchard. The boy sees the fruit, climbs over the fence, and attempts to pick an apple, but it is out of reach. He looks about, notices an empty box, drags it under a branch, climbs on it, and reaches the fruit which he picks and eats. Situation II: A man and a little boy are walking on a road past an apple orchard. The boy points to the fruit and says he wants an apple. The man points to a sign on the fence which reads KEEP OUT. TRES- PASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED. The following conversation occurs: BoY: What does the sign say? MAN: It says to keep out or we may be arrested. Anyway, the apples don't belong to us. BoY: But I'm hungry and I want one. MAN: The farmer's house is up the road a bit; we'll stop and see if we can buy some. They proceed up the road to the house and knock on the door. The farmer, accompanied by a barking dog on a leash, appears. The follow- ing conversation ensues: MAN: I'd like to buy some of your apples. FARMER: They're not for sale. MAN: My little boy here is hungry, and I'd like to buy just a few. FARMER: They're not for sale, or to give away. I haven't enough for my own use. MAN: I don't wont you to give them away; I only want one or two for the boy. Have a heart. FARMER: I tell you they're not for sale, and I want you to get off the place. Boys have been stealing apples, and I've got a shotgun which I'm ready to use. MAN: Now keep your shirt on, and don't get trigger-happy. You had bet- ter keep that vicious dog away from my boy. As the farmer starts to close the door, the man sees a Masonic insignia on the farmer's coat. MAN: I see you are a Mason. So am I. FARMER: Why, yes, I am. I belong to the local lodge. (Ritualistic handclasp.) MAN: Well, I must get along. Perhaps I can get something for my boy to eat in town. Nice looking dog you've got. FARMER: Maybe I was a bit hasty. I always want to extend a helping hand to a brother Mason. Come around back of the house, and I'll see</page><page sequence="27">104 AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW if I can't find some apples. That's a cute kid you've got. The dog's very friendly. His bark is worse than his bite. MAN: Why, thanks. Jackie, you can pet the dog. The most striking feature of Situation I is the direct and immediate character of the boy's response. He sees what he wants and how to get it with a minimum of delay. To be sure there are obstructions to be over- come-the fence has to be climbed, and the box must be utilized as a means of getting the fruit. These obstructions must be properly identified and appropriately reacted to. There is certainly "planning" of a sort, and there is utilization of past experience. The total situation is cog- nitively structured by the boy in such a manner that his experience is brought to bear, the obstacles overcome, and objects utilized as tools. In this, the boy may be said to have "mastered" the situation, and is prepared for action in it. These are the strategies of direct action. The obstacles to achievement are physical rather than human. Nobody has to be persuaded, no permis- sion has to be gained, no beliefs have to be modified, no loyalties won. Although there is planning, it is planning which requires no symbolic techniques. The techniques used are the techniques of direct aggression; in a sense, they are the techniques of violence. In Situation II the boy confronts the same problem in the sense that there is fruit in sight and he wants it. But here the resemblance ends. The obstructions are of a different order, and their overcoming requires wholly different strategies. It is not simply a matter of seeing what one wants and getting it. Attitudes and motives must be assessed and changed, and loyalties explored and gained. Simple aggression will not solve the problem. Conflicting ideologies are involved, and the strategy of direct action will not suffice. The first barrier is physical only in the sense that it is a painted piece of wood. It contains some odd black-on-white markings which have- from the point of view of a Man from Mars-an odd effect on the man and the boy. The man reads the sign and prevents the boy from respond- ing to the apples in a direct manner. He interprets the sign for the boy in terms of assumed contingencies which are not objectively present and which bear no resemblance to the painted markings. The intents and purposes of persons not objectively present direct the behavior of those who are. In the interchange between the man and the farmer, matters become even more complicated. Getting apples appears to involve "buying." It</page><page sequence="28">HUMAN COMMUNICATION 105 also involves threats and placation, the imputation of motives by each party to the other, and references to contingencies not visually present. All of this is accomplished by a complex interchange of vocal sounds and (probably) gestures, plus, of course, the actual presence of two people and the dog. Then, surprisingly (to the Man from Mars), the whole character of the situation suddenly changes. Wholly different motives are assumed to exist, the dog is no longer "vicious" but friendly, and the boy is no longer a potential thief, but is "cute." The non-present apples which could not be bought or obtained by cajolery, and access to which was barred by a non-present (and possibly non-existent) shotgun, a "vici- ous" dog, and a threatening manner, suddenly become available. All of this occurs without any change in the objective factors in the situation, but because a hitherto unnoticed object (Masonic insignia) becomes central to the action. It is a truly remarkable effect which appears to emerge from an object which, considered as a physical stimulus, is extremely small. Both Situation I and Situation II illustrate the structuring process. The man, the boy, and the farmer react to each other and to the objects in the environment selectively in terms of assumed meanings and poten- tialities. The assumptions made as the action progresses may or may not be correct. For example, the box which the boy utilized as a means of reaching the apple, might for some strange reason, have been anchored in a block of concrete, although the boy perceived it as a movable object possessing a certain weight. In this event, we may assume that he would have restructured the situation in some manner under the stress of need for the apple. The striking difference between the two situations is the unique role played by symbolic techniques in Situation II. Here words, insignia, signs, and symbolic actions are utilized as devices in the structuring processes. They become, in fact, the central agency in organizing the relationships between individuals, and between the individual and his environment. Situation I was structured by the boy in a definite manner, but there was no use of symbols. This last statement may require some qualification, however. For the boy the use of symbols is "second nature," and he may have "talked to himself" in the process of mastering, that is, structuring, the situation. He could, perhaps, have "instructed" himself sub-vocally in solving the problem of getting at the apples by using the box. But we may assume that he could have solved the problem without the use of symbols since animals with no, or minimal, symbolic</page><page sequence="29">106 AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW capacities solve similar problems in a similar manner. In particular, it should be noted that the conversation between the man and the farmer employs words in combinations that would certainly puzzle the Man from Mars even if he understood the language. Such phrases as "keep your shirt on," "extend a helping hand," "his bark is worse than his bite" and "have a heart" signify something more than the literal meanings of the separate words. The essence of this more complex level of symbolic usage is, as Kenneth Burke points out (Phi- losophy of Literary Form, p. 503), the "seeing of something in terms of something else." Such a device is a metaphor. In perceiving that appar- ently unlike items-for example, keeping on one's shirt and keeping calm-have a psychological identity, we establish what Burke calls a new perspective. We thereby enlarge the meaning of some aspect of our surroundings. How Symbols Function We may note that the symbols (words, insignia, etc.) as well as the symbolic act (symbolic handshake) in Situation II are used in a variety of ways. They are used in overcoming the obstructions which intervene between the boy and the apples and in structuring the shifting patterns of hostile-friendly relationships between the man and the farmer. These uses illustrate how symbols function in communication situations. These functions may be briefly summarized. 1. They point to, or "place" in context by naming an object, person, act or attribute. The object or person is thus located; attention is directed towards it, and, in general, it becomes more easily manipulated. The boy is addressed as "Jackie," the dog is "vicious," etc. These symbols, of course, may be used independently of and apart from their referents. Jackie not only may be spoken to (by name) but spoken about. 2. They generalize the referent by placing it in a category of objects or acts towards which one has an attitude, and towards which one may be expected to adopt a course of action. In Situation II, the boy's intent to pick an apple is placed in the category of illegal actions by the words on the sign. The dog is successively referred to as "vicious" and "friendly," both of which categorize the animal and suggest appropriate actions. 3. They have referents beyond themselves for which they stand as surrogates. The symbol may be responded to in the same manner as</page><page sequence="30">HUMAN COMMUNICATION 107 that for which it stands. Apples, for example, may be responded to as objects to be picked and eaten; they also may be talked about. In Situa- tion I, the apples are constantly present in the field. In Situation II, they are symbolically present. 4. They express affectively-toned attitudes towards situations, ac- tions, or objects. The question whether symbols are ever wholly neutral is perhaps debatable. Kenneth Burke discusses this problem and makes the distinction between poetic and semantic meaning (Philosophy of Literary Form, p. 138 ff.). "The semantic ideal would attempt to get a description by the elimination of attitude (p. 147)." Concerning the attainment of this "ideal" Burke expresses considerable doubt. "The best thing to be said in favor of the semantic ideal is that it is a fraud: one may believe in it because it is impossible (p. 159)." All language is inherently poetic (in Burke's sense) because it steers action, and action is never neutral. This is its orienting function. The farmer's hostile atti- tude is indicated by reference to a non-present shotgun, and the man's orientation by the debunking metaphor, "trigger-happy." It appears that symbolic devices have a special potency for establishing a framework for action. Friendly or unfriendly aspects are identified, and a course of action implied which may or may not take place. Its direction at least is indicated. The farmer threatened action. The man planned (symboli- cally) to buy apples from the farmer. The ritual shaking of hands was a symbolic action which, so to speak, set the stage for a new orientation of the relationships between the farmer and the man. On the other hand, the action may be specifically directed. The words on the sign instructed trespassers to keep out of the orchard. 5. Symbolic techniques enable individuals to share experience; that is, to participate in each other's attitudes and motives, and to understand each other's intents and meanings. The Masonic insignia restructured the situation so that the farmer and the man could vicariously share each other's experiences and motives. They were enabled to enter into each other's past experiences. We may assume that each individual reacted to the insignia in the same manner as he intended the other person to react. This is Mead's "significant symbol." It has the unique characteristic of eliciting responses in the user which are the same as those elicited in "the other." These, then, are some of the important characteristics of symbolic devices. Actually, of course, we are dealing with an enormously complex process that has many aspects. The number of uses to which these</page><page sequence="31">108 AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW processes are put by man in the business of living is without limit. Any summary statement can only indicate in a general way their functions in human societies. But we may say with assurance that the use of symbolic processes enables man to select, identify, and manipulate aspects of a situation, generalize about it, express attitudes toward it, relate it to other situations in the past and in the future, direct his own and the actions of others in it, and evoke in himself and others similar attitudes and tendencies to action. Life-Maintaining Function With increasing complication of organs and functions, evolutionary changes wrought an elaboration on both sensory histology and function. As perception grew as a process mediating sense reception with action, the range of potential modifications through learning increased. Man became capable of rapidly restructuring his perceptual field. Since the Darwinian philosophy of evolution teaches us that organs and functions emerge that are most 'successful' in maintaining a species, we must examine the evolutionary, life-maintaining functions of perceptual learning. -Charles M. Solley and Gardner Murphy, Development of the Per- ceptual World. New York: Basic Books, Inc., 1960. p. 31. Pacemaker in Psychology Not only is the psychology of perception older than that of such other fields as learning or motivation, but it also has served as a pace- maker in the way of decisive changes in basic outlook. Perception thus may be best suited as a paradigm not only for the past but also for things likely to come. ---Egan Brunswik, Perception and the Representative Design of Psychological Experiments. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1956. p. 4.</page></plain_text>
