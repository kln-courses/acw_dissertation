<plain_text><page sequence="1">ART AS KNOWLEDGE Carl H. Hamburg To UNDERSTAND art as knowledge, to think of one in terms of the other, would seem to require specification of a set of characteristics that could justly be applied and predicated to both. To avoid turning the "art as knowl- edge" theme into an "art is knowledge" identity, we must be content with the thesis that only some and not all of the defining elements of art can be intelli- gibly correlated to elements going into the definition of knowledge. By neither attempting to prove that art is the same as knowledge, nor that it can do better or worse what, e.g., scientific knowledge is supposed to be able to do, we are relieved from having to proceed from too tight a definition of either enterprise or to end up with definitions of such vast generality that nothing-except possibly one's own conciliatory efforts-will remain distinct. To understand art as a type of knowledge, it will neither do to equate both nor, indeed, to create between them an opposition so radical as would befit, if at all, only the highest formal achievements of theoretical knowledge on one side, and the lyric cry on the other. In what follows, we will not enlarge upon all the things that art is not, nor shall we add another to the many compilations of all the things that art is. Instead, we will point to the common ground occupied by what, in actual usage, has been understood by art and knowledge. If "art as knowledge"-then, as knowledge of what? As knowledge of something other than the piece of art itself? If so, we are committed to a re- ductive analysis, a quest not so much for what we know in the arts, but through them. If art as knowledge of a special kind, what could we possibly mean by this expression ? Surely, art is art, and not knowledge; if it is to be neither the same as knowledge, nor opposed as utterly different from knowl- edge, if it is not even considered as reductively yielding, through an artistic medium, knowledge of a non-artistic subject matter, as what sort of knowledge is art to be conceived? At worst, to speak of "art as knowledge" would just seem to shift the problem of distinguishing the two by requiring new dis- tinctions between the theoretical and artistic meanings of knowledge. At best -and from this assumption we shall proceed-such shift in terminology emphasizes a continuity, an embracing of the arts as comparable to other modes of human understanding. 2</page><page sequence="2">ART AS KNOWLEDGE 3 Academic man, it has been observed, comes in schools. Thinkers, and writers, in the field of aesthetics are no exception to this rule. And as there are different schools of thought, there are also different definitions of art to be found in the many volumes written on the subject. Such broad terms as "significant form," "qualitativeness," "intrinsicness" and others have usually done service for definitory purposes. To argue, as we propose, for art as a "mode" of knowledge, would seem to confront us with the following situation: we should either start out from a tight definition of knowledge and, upon emphasizing its superiority to other definitions offered, proceed to show how nicely it also accommodates all that the arts have ever claimed to be and do; or, again, we could avoid much argument by formulating both art and knowledge in terms so general and lofty, bathing them in so rich a glow, that nothing, except possibly one's own good will, would stand out distinctly any more. However, we shall try a somewhat different procedure. Instead of starting from ad hoc definitions, we will point our argument by indicating the common ground implied by the very dichotomies that have been appealed to by those who, time and again, have perpetuated not so much a meaningful distinction but an isolating separation between science and art. 1. Perfect-Imperfect Knowledge. In these terms, different thinkers have at different times distinguished the artistic from the scientific enterprise. The underlying assumption here is that the "true nature of reality" is somehow known and, depending upon what it is taken to be, it will either be the arts which, in approximating the essential features of this "reality," will be more "perfect" a means for that end than the sciences, or vice versa. Thus, given a Platonic realm of ideas, or a universe of mechanical or electrodynamic laws as expressing the basic structure of reality, it will be science, and not the arts, which must appear as the more perfect vehicle to take one there. Starting with the concept of a living, dynamic and "irrational" universe, expressed, e.g., in the philosophies of Schopenhauer, Schelling, Nietzsche and Bergson, it will be the arts, rather than science, which promise a more perfect appre- hension of its essential features. "It is the beginning of all poetry"-writes Schlegel--"to abolish the law and method of rationally proceeding reason, and to plunge us once more into the ravishing confusions of fantasy, into the original chaos of human nature." For Bergson, too, the unique grasp conceded to art is implied in his valuation of intuition as capable of pushing beyond the symbols which, like the veil of Maya, stand between the "rational" thinker and live, dynamic reality. Philosophies of art, oriented around privileged reality-concepts-be they mathematical, physical, religious or bio- logical-will, of necessity have to put varying emphases upon sometimes art,</page><page sequence="3">4 COLLEGE ART JOURNAL sometimes (scientific or philosophical) knowledge as the more perfect routes to the "really real." With the contemporary emphasis upon "experience" (as being equally open to artistic as well as to scientific interpretations) and of "culture" (as comprehending science as well as artistic and other endeavors as of equal status), philosophers have, of late, preferred to think of reality as (culturally) equally "real" in all the aspects in which human minds have been able to experience it. It has become quite pointless, therefore, to classify at this time either the arts or the sciences as respectively perfect or imperfect modes of knowing the real as such. 2. Emotion-Reason. In this version, art, instead of knowing all, now knows nothing at all. Far from reaching knowledge of a profound or intimate type inaccessible to the sciences, art as emotion is entirely divorced from inquiries into what is "true" or "probably true" about this world. From Plato to Tolstoy, the arts have accordingly been charged with infecting or disturb- ing our emotions. More recently, the positivists have pointed the issue by con- trasting the arts as emotive utterances or ejaculations from science as the body of verifiable propositions. In some people's minds this has taken the form of asserting that the arts are after emotions-and the sciences after truth. And yet, such a science as psychology will contain verifiable propositions, state "truths" about emotions (among other things)-and there are some art-forms in which even the sober striving after truths can be dramatized and thus be made emotionally more significant. It is useful to remember: 1) that, as subject-matter, emotions are dealt with in both science and art. Neither has a monopoly on them, or any other topic, for that matter; 2) that, as states of mind, emotions inhabit the scientist as well as the artist even though the mere "having of emotions" neither disqualifies the former nor distinguishes the latter. For our purpose, it is to be kept in mind: a) that having emotions and articulating emotions are two different affairs; b) that the arts, while they may be "infecting" emotions sometimes, more often clarify and intensify them; c) that artistic appreciation is less a matter of having, than of realizing the meaning and impact of, emotions; d) that expression of emotion, if it is to be artistic, implies structure and as such becomes comparable to other symbolic forms of expression. 3. Imagination-Concept. Much has been made of this undeniable distinc- tion between the sober, conceptual structures of (theoretical) knowledge on one hand and the remarkably fluctuating creations of artistic imagination on</page><page sequence="4">ART AS KNOWLEDGE 5 the other. On this alternative, there is no chance again for art really to "know" anything. To "imagine things" has become synonymous with being ignorant of them. The "imaginative" is too easily identified with the "imagi- nary"-and both are dismissed as "anthropomorphic" and unfit for any serious "objective" study of things. And yet, the "anthropomorphic" is still of very real concern, if only to the anthropos; if it imposes a perspective, a slant-so does all the perspective conceptualizing of our sciences which operate on various levels of abstraction for various purposes of generalization. "Forget the abstractions 'science' and 'art' and all the high talk about them, watch the individual scientist and artist at work, and they look more alike than either is like any other worker. The artist, too, is a ceaseless experimenter, and his artistry is as rigorous a discipline as a scientific inquiry. . ... Nor are utterly different faculties involved in this process. The scientific mind is not a mere logic-grinder, turning out truths with remorseless precision. It, too, feels its way, has flashes of insight, leaps to conclusions . . . although the final experimental test is all-important-what is tested is a hunch, an inspiration, a dream. All the great scientific theories are great imaginative feats." (Herbert Muller: Science and Criticism, 257.) 4. Fiction-Fact. This is another popular form of the above "Imagination- Concept" polarity between the arts and sciences. It is just as easy, of course, to reduce the "fictional" to the "false," as it is to think of the "imaginative" as merely "imaginary." If so reduced, imagination is said to lead to fiction, while concepts alone refer to facts. The separation between art and science again has been so overstretched as to have become stultifying. Actually, this version operates from an ideological basis that has since been abandoned. Philosophers of science since Vaihinger and Duhem have made explicit a good many of the fictional elements involved in scientific fact-"finding." On the other hand, the arts have often proven the only medium by which to get close to certain aspects of the hard factuality of human experience and existence. We have already listed comparable traits: both knowledge- and art-makers experiment, impose a discipline on their respective activities, explore, make hit-and-miss trials. Neither employs essentially different faculties. Both imagine, articulate, formulate and construct. Let us add that they also start with the same data. No matter how far the theoretical scientist soars from the level of sensory per- ception, from it he takes off and to it he must return-if it is verification of his construction he wants. Nor is the artist in so different a position. No matter how far one feels transported, inspirationally touched or lifted "out of this world," the artist's appeal is still to and through the senses. Both scientist and artist use senses to make sense, both start with some "fact"- and arrive at an interpretation of fact (accessible to all, many or few)-not at fiction.</page><page sequence="5">6 COLLEGE ART JOURNAL 5. Passivity-Activity. Like its predecessors, this popular alternative too has its feet firmly planted in mid-air. Whatever plausibility it possesses is de- rived from its appeal to what are indeed different emphases in both enter- prises. But such shadings in emphasis should not be frozen into criteria of final opposition. If knowledge is, admittedly, an "activity" of some specific kind, its function is still the "settling" of doubt. However active, dynamic, evolu- tionary or revolutionary, science still aims at determinations that will, for a while, suspend conflict and further research activity in a given subject-matter. While this may ultimately be a matter of temperament, it seems difficult to divorce altogether contemplation as a genuine phase of either scientific or philosophical thinking. It is just as difficult, if not impossible, to account for works of art as either issuing in or appealing to a merely contemplative, passive and receptive mind. Such disinterested-yet rapt-attention may be one isolable feature in artistic creation or consummation. However, such a phase must in the end be abstracted from the full context of art-appreciation which is characterized by much inner movement and conflict-solvings (conscious or not) by which one feels and thinks oneself through in an esthetically strong experience. However materially "disinterested," an "interest" or "concern" of some kind is alive in art-production and appreciation. Yet interests involve conflicts even though, as Eliseo Vivas remarks, "as is true of garlic, a small amount of it goes a long way." (A Natural History of the Esthetic Transaction; 103.) A good case could indeed be made for finding instances of poor-aca- demic or sentimental-art, wherever happy endings and harmonizations are too easily introduced, with nothing in particular to stand in need of harmonization. A number of conventional dichotomies have now been considered. Others, such as "Public and Private Worlds," "Discourse and Vision," "Reality and Illusion" could have been added. Their rejection as inadequate for characterizing the arts and sciences respectively is implied in our earlier comments. We have rejected an emotional interpretation, according to which the arts know nothing, and an intuitive version, according to which the arts know what is important to know better than any other mode of knowledge. We have suggested that both emotional and structural, intuitive and con- ceptual, active and passive factors enter both enterprises. If then neither art nor science are to be understood as more or less adequate grasps-as chips of the old block-reality, if they are considered instead as differently centered per- spectives, issuing in different interpretations of whatever "reality" may come to mean in human experience, then, we suggest, a more satisfactory way of indicating their common features would be to conceive of both art and science as two different "languages" in which man can articulate his world for different purposes and by different criteria of precision. Actually, we find</page><page sequence="6">ART AS KNOWLEDGE 7 ourselves in good company. Since the turn of the century, mathematicians, physicists, and philosophers of science have combined with semanticists, estheticians, naturalists and idealists in holding that knowledge is a sort of "language," a faith mediated by "symbols." An imposing array of thinkers have come to see in man's symbolic activity a function universal enough to encompass both artistic and scientific sense-making. In what follows, we propose to be careful and, while realizing the com- mon genus, pay attention to the characteristic differences between the two "languages." Languages differ in their "vocabularies" and their "grammars." The question to be asked then is: what is the specific difference in the type (or use) both the artistic and scientific languages make of their "vocabularies" (symbols) on one hand, and of the relation between symbols, their "grammar", on the other? Symbols in Art and Science. "Whatever else life may be"-it has been said--"it is an experience"; whatever else an experience may be-we add- it cannot occur more than once. If therefore it is not to eventuate into what William James called a "blooming, buzzing confusion", it must be due to our seeing, feeling and realizing it in certain recurrent patterns. Something is recognized as something, one perception becomes a cue for others, a color desig- nates aspect and distance of a "thing" or "person." All this, the Gestalt- psychologists have pointed out some time ago; if we are to take them seri- ously we must also recognize that symbolization occurs on levels where it has not ordinarily been looked for. If this be accepted, artistic and scientific languages could be presented as more conscious and organized manipulations of symbols, rising from an already symbolic level of immediate common- sense-perception, to more specifically guided and consistently articulated symbol-structures of theories and art-products. What then distinguishes the artistic from the theoretic symbol-structures ? Do they confine themselves to characteristically different symbols? Surely not; the same symbols can figure as easily in one as in the other; auditory and pictorial symbols are vehicles for both enterprises. There is, however, a significant difference in the use or manner of employment of their symbolic media by art and science respectively. As regards the symbol-use of theoretical knowledge, it must be unambiguous and well-defined, i.e.: (1) fixed in its meaning; (2) substitutions (equivalent expressions) must be possible in principle; (3) it must be translatable into other (though not necessarily all) languages. The artistic symbol-use, in contradistinction, owes its very success to the</page><page sequence="7">8 COLLEGE ART JOURNAL richness of its connotations. In a sense, it profits from ambiguity of meaning, since: (1) it need not mean the same thing to different audiences, or to the same audience at different times; (2) it will make a complex, if not diffuse, reference; in not being pre- cise, it will all the better convey feeling tone, do justice to perceptual rhythms and proportions and enrich meaning while blurring its contours; (3) it will be part of the meaning itself. Symbol-use in the arts is unique exactly because "what" is said and "how" it is said are not separable and thus not substitutable without loss in the medium of any other language. In consequence: we may not use the standards of one way of symbol- usage to measure the achievements of the other. The artistic symbol may be more fully charged with emotive-attitudinal meaning, the scientific symbol may be more livelessly exact, neither can do the work of the other. When the poet compares his beloved to a flower, he speaks neither to botanist nor to anthropologist. When the biologist classifies man-loved or unloved-among the "mammals" he is not arguing with the poet's description of some humans as "roses", even though he is saying and implying much about man which, if not always interesting, is certainly important to all men at some time or other. It has become commonplace to point to the "high price", the loss of concrete- ness we have to pay for the controlled abstractions of science. There is no need to add to this theme here. It is sufficient to remember that precision and abstractness of the scientific symbol-work is neither more nor any less im- portant than the meaningfulness and concreteness of the artistic symbol-work; understanding and control of the pervasive features of our world would be as pointless without the intensification and enjoyment of its perceptual features, as the latter would be insecure without the consequences of the former. Relations in Art and Science. Both theory and art-work relate the symbols through which they mediate their characteristically different meaning-func- tions. There is usually no question about the fact that the scientist, when investigating or expressing the results of his investigations relates the particu- lar item of his concern with other items with which it can be shown to enter into regular and, if possible, measurable relations. The artist, it can be shown, does the same. Both scientist and artist, e.g., may talk about "gold" or "water" and disclose aspects about either which are not otherwise obvious. Expressing the one as "H20" and the other by its various chemico-physical properties is, of course, to relate them to other elements as well as to empirical</page><page sequence="8">ART AS KNOWLEDGE 9 laws and mathematical operations. The artist also, if painting or talking about "water" and "gold", relates these to as many aspects of our perceptual and emotive experience as he can get away with. "Water", instead of merely stand- ing for anything "wet", will be related to such sensuous aspects as the clear- ness of crystal, the smoothness of silver, the roaring violence of its waves; it may be related to its purifying, fertilizing or soothing properties. It takes the poet to tell us more about "gold" but that it is "hard, yellow, malleable and expensive." Its romance, its power, its lustre, its tragic or comic relations to human pursuits, all these are legitimate and significant properties not revealed in chemistry-books. Whether we express the meaning of a given item in human experience through a structural atomic formula which makes explicit components and relations that characterize its physical nature or whether we intensify the meanings of such items by metaphorically relating them to a great variety of perceptual and emotional aspects, in either case we are talking about reality, in different languages and for different purposes. Neither scientist nor artist can tell us what "water" or "gold" really are in glorious isolation from anything else; for both, the realization of their meaning is achieved within differently oriented schemes of interpretation. The difference in these schemes can be specified, we suggest, by paying attention to the manner in which both the arts and sciences relate differently the experiential items with which they are concerned. Philosophers of art, when reflecting upon contrast or similarity between art and science, have sometimes emphasized one, sometimes other, distinguishing features. Accounting for their findings, the following set of relational contrasts may be sufficient to specify the differences between the scientific and the artistic experience-accountings: I. Intensive-Extensive Relations. It is in these terms that Cassirer, e.g., distinguishes the respective languages of art and science. Both compare, in that "they relate a manifold to a unity." (Essay on Man, 143.) They differ in that the language of science achieves this unity by operating with an extensive abstraction from experience; art, on the other hand, is said to present us with an "intensification" of experience. Art aims at "concretion," science at "functional abstraction." An experience is rendered artistically if, and to the extent that, it has been so related to other items and modes of experiencing that its meaning has been enriched, felt, and thus been intensified beyond its surface-and commonsense-aspects. An experience has been accounted for scientifically when, by experimentally controlled abstraction from the inci- dental "here and now" of its appearance, it has been so related to other events (or classes of events) that its occurrence can be "explained" and, if possible, predicted. II. Qualitative-Quantitative Relations. In this manner of contrasting</page><page sequence="9">10 COLLEGE ART JOURNAL science from art, attention is directed to the quantitative aspect of the scientific enterprise. In contradistinction, it is said of the artist that he relates the immediate quality of an experience. In terms of this distinction, it could be said that what the artist relates may not be measurable and weighable-and yet be immeasurably important and imponderably essential. III. Intransitive-Transitive Relations. This division has been suggested by the following considerations: in the scientific relations we pass from the object of direct experience either backward to causal connections or forward to consequences. The object, in other words, is resolved into a network of relations. "Our interest is in a complex of events not embodied as meanings by the object from which investigation starts, but which lie beyond it." (Eliseo Vivas: Naturalism and the Human Spirit, 99). Thus, while in science we aim at the formulation of "transitive" relations, we look in the arts at the object "in order to see it, to listen to it . . . we fasten our attention on it, arrest it in such a way that we do not wander from it but rest within it attentively." (ibid.) An apprehension of this kind has, in contrast to the scientific aim, been termed "intransitive." IV. Conditional-Presentational Relations. Emphasis may be placed on the conditional mood in which the scientist relates phenomena: when relating phases in the states of one event-series to phases in another series, and by relating them both to a numerical series, he is thinking, if not always talking, in a conditional sense. "IF such and such be the case, and IF such and such relations are established, then such and such will probably be the case." On the other hand, when the artist gives us his picture or vision of a face or a landscape he expresses whatever relations he establishes to our senses and moods in a directly presentative, if not an imperative, manner. In presenting an experience by relating it to significant perspectives, the artist deals in concern with matters of human concern and, unlike the scientist, he does not even attempt to be "neutral." As it has been put: "we point with pride, with alarm, with disgust; we deal with facts in terms of Hurray, Ouch, Phooey." (H. J. Muller: Science and Criticism, 262). Artistic emphasis may be more subtle or more profound than that; at any rate, when Omar Khayyam speaks of "That inverted bowl we call sky, whereunder crawling coop't we live and die"-neither he nor we would be bothered by the more sober conditional sense in which the scientist may question any description of the sky as a "bowl" or the human mode of locomotion as a form of "crawling." In summary: we have discussed both art and science as modes of "know- ing". The advisability of such interpretation was supported by reference to symbol-use and relational structure which the arts share with theoretical forms</page><page sequence="10">ART AS KNOWLEDGE 11 of knowledge. We have briefly indicated considerations which have led to treat of both as comparable languages about, rather than chips of, reality. In conclusion, let us reaffirm that while art as knowledge may not compare in reliability with the precise symbol-work of the sciences, it is still up to the artist to disclose to us what we may know and understand of those aspects of the human condition from which the scientist must forever look away in order to deliver to us his formulae of control. If there is any merit in reflections of the order of generality as attempted here, it may be to guard us against ascribing to the arts as a whole properties ascribable only to some of them. The history of aesthetics is replete with partial definitions of art which, adequate to literature, e.g., do not befit music or, generalizing upon the specific languages of the visual arts, are not ac- commodating to the remaining art-forms. Sculpture, poetry, music etc. surely emphasize and utilize differently both sensory data and their symbolic organi- zation. As art-forms, however, they share with theoretical knowledge the same basic faculties of observation, imagination and abstraction. Also, like the sciences, they are subject both to formal principles of consistency and empirical principles of relevancy which control symbol-use and symbolic relations as briefly outlined in a preceding passage. While each art-form must differently determine the criteria appropriate to the formal unity of its structure, these criteria must be other than, or more than, the logical criteria of linguistic consistency which formally control scientific discourse. As regards the empirical relevance of artistic symbol-structures, they are not verified by the mere occurrence of experimentally controlled sense-data; in- stead aesthetic consummation %"verifies" in a complex (emotive-conative-per- ceptive-cognitive) response of the total individuality of the "tester." Consider- ing that any normal perceiver, under standard conditions, can verify theory, the great universality and procedural reliability of theoretical symbolisms be- comes evident. Considering, however, that data-perception covers only a small range of human responsiveness and that, even when perceiving, standard-con- ditions are rarely realized, it becomes equally evident that the cultural value of the arts is linked with their role in attending to, and cultivating discriminating sensitivity to, those reality-aspects whose sensuous beauty and emotional significance must be ignored for the purposes of theoretic symbolization.</page></plain_text>
