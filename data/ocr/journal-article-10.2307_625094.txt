<plain_text><page sequence="1">A History of Greek Religion. By MARTIN P. NILssoN. Translated from the Swedish by F. J. FIELDEN, with a Preface by Sir JAMES G. FRAZER. Pp. 310. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1925. 12s. 6d. This is not simply a translation of Dr. Nilsson's Swedish work on Greek religion, the sub- stance of which was delivered in 1920 in a course of lectures for the Olaus Petri foundation, at Upsala. Since then the author has lectured at Aberystwyth on the relations of Cretan</page><page sequence="2">NOTICES OF BOOKS 281 to classical Greek religion (1923, see Year's Work for that year, p. 45), and, pending the complete publication of that course, he incorporates a sketch of its results in the first chapter. Noteworthy points are, that he refuses to consider the serpent necessarily chthonian (p. 13), suggests (p. 15) that the double axe is a sacrificial implement, not a thunderbolt, in its origin, will not hastily conclude that the Minoans worshipped a great goddess (p. 18 sq.), pointing out, very pertinently, that their art shows more than one type of female deity, and is strongly of opinion (p. 31) that the goddess, or goddesses, had as partner, not a lover or husband, but a divine child, the Cretan Zeus. In Chapter II he sets forth his discovery, already published in 'Avr[rlopov: Festschrift fiir Wackernagel, of the coincidence of Mycenaean sites and cycles of myth; with regard to particular myths and to religion he is frequently in agreement with the best results of research in this country, perhaps more than that of the Continent; thus he recognises (p. 238) that Herakles was not originally a Dorian hero, but merely one who was appropriated by them; he rejects (p. 67) Bethe's Sagenverschiebung, and equally (p. 77) S. Reinach's totemistic theories and (p. 78) Miss Harrison's too ingenious attempt to read savagery into everything. At the same time, he is quite ready to use the results of anthropology and folk-lore, clearly recognising, for instance, the occasional survival of a savage belief or practice (see especially Chapter III), or the importance of folk-tale themes in mythology. 'He is,' as Sir J. G. Frazer says in his introduction to the book, 'far too cautious to push the comparisons to extremes, to discover a totem under every bush and a ghost under every god;' but this does not prevent him from seeing that such things as ghosts and, if not totems, at any rate magical beasts, are to be reckoned with. He adopts the Frazerian distinction between magic and religion, with its implication that the former is the earlier (e.g. p. 98); a view against which strong objections can be urged, but which is convenient for purposes of classification at any rate. On many debatable points, such as the existence of divine kings, he maintains a sage neutrality. In his fourth chapter, Gods of Nature and of Human Life, his attitude is, that man begins (and therefore the Greeks began) by projecting 'his own conscious and volitional ego into the world about him,' thus conceiving of 'powers' exterior to himself, which can hardly be called personal, certainly not anthropomorphic, at first; from these powers (daimones) develop the personal and anthropomorphic gods. The next chapters discuss the part played by Homer in shaping these concepts, the very important factors of legalism and mysticism (Chapter VI.), the religion of the State, and, finally, a welcome and very sensible section, the differences between the religion of the cultured classes and that of the peasantry. In this connection he instances a few of the modern survivals. Dr. Nilsson is well qualified to write such a book as this, not simply by his learning and his good sense, but by the fact that he was himself brought up in a country district of Sweden where he met many people among whom something of the old attitude towards such things as myths still lingered. Thus, he does not need to theorise about the importance of the aetiological myth, for he remembers that nearly all the folk-tales he heard as a boy were aetiological. Hence one listens with respect to his views on the mentality of simple people, peasants and barbarians, because he has met that mentality himself and spoken with the possessors of it. Hence also the sanity of much that he says; he is not evolving a camel out of his inner consciousness, but sketching what he has seen. There are a number of points, however, on which he will find many to oppose him, on grounds which to the present reviewer appear good. Apart from the vexed question of Homer (he is a separatist), I doubt very much if Wilamowitz-M6llendorf's theory of the Asiatic origin of Apollo, which Dr. Nilsson adopts, will hold water; the distinction between magic and religion, already mentioned, is rather too sharp; and there are minor matters here and there which might be criticised. But all this leaves it true that the book is fresh, well-informed, vigorous, and on the whole perfectly sound. The translator has made several slips in English idiom, such as ' young' several times for ' late' or ' recent.' On p. 101 we find, ' When the place was planned, in late Mycenaean times,' in a context which seems to indicate that he has misunderstood planerad (levelled). On p. 109 he, or the printer, has made Iasion into Jason. H. J. R.</page></plain_text>
