By Dipak Bhattacharya , with a foreword by Govindagopal Mukhopadhyaya . pp. x, 243, Calcutta, Sanskrit Pustak Bhandar, 1984, Rs. 80. The title of this book is somewhat misleading. Rather than being, as one would expect, a methodological or philosophical study of symbolism in mythology and ritual, references to Agni serving as illustrations of the findings, and general conclusions resulting from the author's theoretical deliberations, it is an investigation of the significance of the Vedic myth of the birth of Agni as a deity and his symbolic meaning and function in rituals, written from a certain methodological standpoint briefly explained in a relatively short introduction forming the first chapter of the book. A few general observations are further made in an even shorter concluding chapter. The briefly outlined general and methodological stance of the author is, however, worth noting. He regards myth as the equivalent of what in modern times is called a theory, but since in Indian religious thought myth is never divorced from ritual, he looks at ritual as myth enacted. With respect to the meaning of the Vedic myth the author sees it as expressing what later became the preoccupation of philosophy, only the language is still one of imagery and symbols. Earlier Vedic researches were rooted in linguistic analysis and so were unable to unravel the philosophical dimension in the older hymns, because it is not obvious in them while being conspicuous in a few late hymns in the tenth book (which do not deal in myths, but in cosmogony expressed in straightforward conceptual terms). Only the recognition, first achieved by Bergaigne, that some Vedic myths, referred to in early hymns, were cosmogonie made visible their philosophical perspective and revealed that there was a Weltanschauung presented in them. The author calls this the Rgvedic "pre-ontology". This dawning understanding of the Vedic myth as the archaic form of philosophising even enables one, the author asserts, to trace the Rgvedic foundations of the post-Vedic systems of philosophy. And one can now go with more assurance beyond the theory of anthropomorphism (and zoomorphism) in Vedic mythology which still undeservedly exerts some influence even today. The clue to progress is what L?ders already recognised as the main task of Vedic research, namely to inquire into what the Vedic gods meant to the Vedic poets themselves. Even when the theory of the Vedic gods as personifications of natural phenomena reigned supreme one often searched quite in vain for their original physical basis, as in the case of Indra. And where this basis appears to be too vague it used to be explained by the process of obfuscation because of the accretion of new functions by the god figure. But the correct procedure is to look for the symbolic meaning of the god figures themselves and even where a god is clearly a personification of a natural force or phenomenon the important question to be asked is: what is that natural phenomenon symbolic of? And then the imagery of anthropo- or zoomorphic figures associated with that natural phenomenon reveals its true function in that it expresses some further aspects of the basic idea which the poet had in mind and for which the natural phenomenon is a symbol. L?ders' work did not fully develop this line, because it is incomplete, and later scholars such as Renou and Gonda did not pay enough attention to the task of interpreting Vedic symbolism. The author demonstrates the way one should go about it with the example of Varuna. In Oldenberg's view he was originally a moon god (his twin, Mitra, being a sun god). But to the Vedic poets Varuna was the guardian of truth (rta). The image for this function in the human context was that of king, and Varuna is indeed associated with kingship, as L?ders had shown. So the principle the poet conveys is that of the guardianship of truth and he does so by way of the nature symbol of the moon and the imagery of kingship. In the process of obfuscation it is the nature symbol which suffers (and even the image taken from social life may fade), but not the original idea of overseeing truth (which eventually finds, in later times, direct philosophical, i .e. conceptual, expression). This should be the way to trace the beginnings of Indian philosophy in the early layers of the Rg Veda shrouded in the dream language of imagery and symbolism which was later given up by philosophers but was in a way retained down to modern times, in specialised spheres of activity like art and pastimes and certain types of dreams now studied by some schools of psychology. This method can also be applied to the Atharva Veda, although the abundance of magic</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS OF BOOKS 351 elements in it was thought by some (e.g. Winternitz) to place it completely outside the sphere of philosophy. But if the crude and base components of magic procedures are set aside, "the border-line between magic and philosophy fades out in the rituo-philosophical set-up of the Vedic world-outlook". The author also ponders on the problem of distinguishing myths from legends, on figurative descriptions of rituals and metaphors and on the applicability of the historical method in Vedic research. As regards the last point he is in favour of its use. He believes that fundamental changes did occur in the Vedas, albeit "within superficially similar structures". The second chapter, "The Birth of Agni", takes almost half of the book. The author concentrates on the Rgvedic hymn 4,1 which, although it mentions the well-known three births of Agni, gives prominence to his birth out of the infinite expanse, the home of the eternal law and truth (rta). This raises the story of the birth of Agni to the rank of cosmogonie myths and all the other images of the hymn have to be viewed from this angle. The author supports his thesis with lengthy and arduous argumentation, references to many other hymns, criticism of earlier interpretations and finally by pointing out what he sees as later versions of the myth in the tenth book, including the famous hymn 10,129, and in the Atharva Veda. The third chapter is concerned with showing how the ideas surrounding the birth of Agni are reflected in agny?dheya, the Vedic fire ritual. The author uncovers in it not only the shift of the motive for performing the ritual from material gain to gaining heaven, but also the developing idea of inner sacrifice, pointing to release (in the author's words: to "becoming non phenomenal"). This trend was, however, monopolised in post-Vedic time by the "knowledge" tradition of the Vedas (j??nak?nda) and the ritual tradition (karmak?nda) was not further developed in this respect, but it reappeared in Tantrism in its specific way which is outlined in the rather brief fourth chapter: the birth of Agni is not seen there as a cosmic event, he is conceived by the Goddess and Siva and the ritual serves as a rite of initiation into the path of salvation. As the author affirms in the concluding chapter, there has been a movement from archaic cosmo gonie "myth-ideology" as expressed in the Vedic ritual to its soteriological re-interpretation in the Tantric ritual. The main problem of this book is its style, or rather lack of it. The author has not observed even the most basic rules of systematic presentation of a topic and pours out ideas, remarks, quotations, descriptions and references one after the other without ever offering a paragraph of clearly stated conclusions or a narrative exposition. Even his general remarks suffer from his chaotic procedure. Thus his general and methodological stance could be outlined at the outset of this review only after a painstaking reconstruction and reformulation of his haphazard writing. Many of the book's deficiencies are probably due to the fact that it is in part based on the author's doctoral thesis from 1975, but he can hardly be excused for not having put it into better shape for publication nine years later. He is also completely innocent of works and studies relevant to his theme which have been published since 1976. The only redeeming feature of the book is the fact that he has scattered in it some valid general ideas about the problems of Vedic interpretation and pointed out the connection between cosmogonie myth and philosophy. These are not new ideas by any means, but the author is right when he complains that outdated methods of early Vedic research still have undue influence. If he had given more care to the presentation of his materials, his book might have contributed more to the weakening of that influence than it can do in its present form.
