McCall This paper presents a multivariate statistical and spatial analysis of rock art site content and composition for the Didima Gorge, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. In presenting an experimental set of methodological approaches, the paper attempts to identify categories of rock art sites based on their image content and other archaeological characteristics, and then explores how these types might have related to various social, religious, and economic contexts in the past. The paper finds evidence for three kinds of rock art site use in the Didima Gorge: (1) large residential "home bases" that were centers of economic activity, (2) large unoccupied sites that were special locations for ritual activities, which the paper argues were sometimes the locations of puberty initiation, and (3) small isolated sites that were locations of private magical activities done by lone individuals. The central theme of this study is that there is clear evidence for diversity in terms of the contexts in which rock art sites in the Didima Gorge formed, and that no single account is adequate for their explanation. Este ensayo presenta un andlisis del contenido de los sitios en arte sobre piedra ubicados en el canon de Didima, KwaZulu Natal, Suddfrica. Se propone clasificar los sitios segun su contenido pictoral mas las caracteristicas arqueologicas. Luego esta clasificacion se relaciona con los antiguos contextos sociales, religiosos, y economicos. Se presenta evidencia para tres clases de uso para los sitios de arte sobre piedra dentro del Canon de Didima: (I) bases residenciales; (2) grandes sitios ded icados a actividades rituales, entre estas las iniciaciones de pubertad; y (3) pequehos lugares aislados donde individuos soli tarios practicaban la magia. El tema central de este estudio es que hay indicaciones claras de diversos contextos deformacion entre los sitios del arte sobre piedra en el Canon de Didima; una explicacion uniforme para su origen no es sustenible. Agreat deal of modern research on South African rock art has focused on a range of ritual contexts relating to the activities of shamans and altered states of consciousness (Dow son 1992; Lewis-Williams 1981,1983,1990,2002; Lewis-Williams and Blundell 1997; Lewis Williams andDowson 1988,1993; Ouzman 1998; Pearson 2002; Whitley 2000). This research has been highly productive and has led to many impor tant insights concerning the social lives of past San groups. This research tradition has generally sought to link patterns of San rock art imagery across a broad geographical and temporal range with reli gious concepts, rituals, and social practices related to shamanism observed among modern and historic San groups (McCall 2007). As has been noted by many rock art researchers (Breuil 1954; Dowson 1992; Lewis-Williams 2002; Willcox 1963), south ern African rock art shows interesting consisten cies over space and time that likely indicate shared cosmological belief systems, and ethnographic work among modern San groups has done much to enlighten our understanding of southern African rock art. Such rock art research traditions in southern Africa have generally focused on the use of eth nohistorical information for the interpretation of imagery at the panel scale (Lewis-Williams 1981). Wider theoretical trends within rock art research, in contrast, have sought to explore such issues as forager enculturation of landscapes through deco ration with rock art imagery (e.g., Jordan 2003). One important limitation for this line of research is the underdevelopment of a toolkit for recogniz ing spatial variation in patterns of rock art imagery.

This paper seeks to make a methodological con tribution to rock art research by using multivariate statistical techniques to explore variation in the composition and organization of rock art sites across the landscape. This study examines the rock art of the Didima Gorge (formerly referred to as Ndedema) in the Drakensberg Mountains of South Africa?a case study that has received thorough rock art recording, mapping, and other archaeo logical investigation since the 1950s. Because this study employs an experimental set of method ological tools, it seemed most efficient to begin with an existing rock art dataset. The rock art recording of the Didima Gorge presented by Pager (1971) represents one of the most detailed pub lished datasets and offers a strong basis for exper imenting with statistical and spatial methodological approaches. Pager's (1971) report includes high-resolution spatial information concerning the location of 17 rock art sites in the Didima Gorge, precise maps of individual sites, copies of the paintings, and detailed typology of individual painting elements for spe cific rock art panels. The report also includes infor mation from the surface collections and/or excavations of 11 of these rock art sites, as well as several unpainted shelters. Pager's (1971) work offers an excellent body of data for the exploration of compositional variability in rock art panels at several spatial scales. This paper identifies variation in site organiza tion and composition that points to differences in the ways in which sites were used, and the division of the landscape for distinct social and ritual pur poses. The paper finds significant evidence for sev eral different kinds of rock art sites, including (1) rock art made in domestic contexts at large resi dential centers, (2) large accumulations of rock art made in ritual contexts at remote sites away from domestic contexts, and (3) small, hidden rock art sites at the bottom of the gorge with little evidence for habitation or other economic activity. Each of these categories of rock art sites has a distinct but consistent pattern of panel composition and orga nization, offering insight concerning the social, religious, and economic division of the landscape. In turn, this information concerning the social and ritual organization of the landscape offers important insights concerning the ways in which the Didima Gorge San coped with an historical period of intense turmoil and conflict. The paper closes by discussing the implications of more his torically situated views of San rock art for other rock art sites in southern Africa. The Rock Art of the Didima Gorge and its Historical Context The Didima Gorge is located in the northern Drak ensberg Mountains of South Africa (Figures 1 and 2). Most of the rock art in the area was produced by San artists, and Pager (1971) suggests, on the basis of his excavations, that the area was occupied by Later Stone Age (LSA) foragers after about 1,000 years B.P. Other archaeological investiga tions of the nearby KwaZulu-Natal and Lesotho highlands show evidence for LSA forager occupa tions and rock painting substantially earlier (Mazel and Watchman 2003; Plug et al. 2003), and it is def initely possible that there were earlier occupations of the Didima Gorge not recognized by Pager. Pager (1971) reports a series of amino acid racemization dates for the rock paintings in the Didima Gorge. These should perhaps be taken with a grain of salt, but this acts as the only direct evi dence concerning the absolute chronology of the rock paintings. The earliest dated rock painting in the Didima Gorge dates to around 800 years B.P. through amino acid racemization, and most of the rock art likely dates to more recent time periods between 200 and 300 years B.P. (Pager 1971; see Mazel and Watchman [1997, 2003] for earlier Drakensberg rock art dates). The recency of much of the Didima Gorge rock art is perhaps under scored by the significant deterioration of many of the paintings since their original documentation by Pager in the 1960s (Pager 1989). In addition to direct dating through amino acid racemization, Pager (1971) also approached chronology through a seriation-based technique focusing on the style of painted eland. When com bined with the direct dating of specific paintings, the sedation approach offers relatively high resolution chronology of rock art sites, and gener ally confirms the suggestion that the majority of the rock art was made during one stylistic phase, which he places during the 200-300 B.P. period.</page><page sequence="3">McCall] CHANGING VIEWS OF DRAKENSBERG SAN ROCK ART 775 Umhlwazine 1.

Historical Context of the Didima Gorge The rock art in the Didima Gorge is composed entirely of rock paintings. Like most other regions of San rock paintings, it is dominated by natural istic paintings of anthropomorphic figures and ungulates, especially the eland. In addition, there are less common depictions of tools, structures, geometric figures, bees, serpents, baboons, and the rianthropic figures. The content of the Didima Gorge rock art also offers important clues to its chronology, as there are a number of depictions of cattle, sheep, and other cues pointing to relatively recent dates. At least to some extent, the movement of San foragers into the Didima Gorge would seem to be the result of the arrival of Iron Age agropastoral ists into the lower territories of KwaZulu-Natal (Pager 1971; Vinnicombe 1976; Willcox 1984). While not as extreme as the southern extent of the Drakensberg, the location of the Didima Gorge is clearly not as productive as the more coastal foothills of KwaZulu-Natal. Presumably, the expansion of Iron Age agropastoralists into the region is substantially responsible for movement of San farther into the Drakensberg. The last 300 years have been a period of fairly intense conflict in this region, with the most extreme manifestation of this being the events lead ing up to the mfecane} During this time period, many agropastoralist groups sought refuge in the higher regions of the Drakensberg and further dis turbed the foraging activities of the San inhabitants (see Dowson [1995] for discussion of the impact of the mfecane on San rock art). Evidence for con flict occasionally manifests in the rock art itself, with a number of examples of weaponry and eight scenes of fighting. Such conflict in the higher south ern reaches of the Drakensberg is also recorded in the writings of early European colonists, especially local missionaries (Blundell 2004; Dowson 1995; Etherington 2004; Pager 1971; Willcox 1984; Wright 1971, 2007; Wright and Mazel 2007). Based on both direct dating and sedation chronology, Pager (1971) argues that the most intense period of painting occurred during the late seventeenth and eighteenth century, and that this corresponds with the most sophisticated use of shaded polychrome coloring on eland and other ungulates. If it is the case that the highest frequency of painting activity occurred during a striking period of upheaval, this would be an important find ing. This study preliminarily argues that the pro duction of rock art, directly related to social and religious practices, aimed at dealing with this tur moil. The currently available chronology of the rock art in the Didima Gorge places it in a vivid historical context, and relates it to the coping strate gies of the San in the Drakensberg. Before presenting any analysis of archaeologi cal data, it should be made clear that the rock art of the Didima Gorge is not an invariant element of a static tradition of San rock art in South Africa (Dowson 1995; Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2004a, 2004b). Instead, it emerged during a dramatic and ultimately fatal period of conflict and stress. Per haps the most interesting question raised here is how Didima Gorge rock art relates simultaneously to both "pan-San" cosmological/religious struc tures and this specific historical context. Looking for Spatial Patterns in Rock Art Panel Composition For historical reasons, South African rock art research has been mostly content-based, focusing on the meaning and social context of imagery (Dowson 1992; Lewis-Williams 1981; Lewis Williams and Dowson 1988; Ouzman 1998; Vin nicombe 1976; Willcox 1963, 1984; Woodhouse 1969). One important element of this is the signif icant ethnohistorical basis for understanding the meaning of rock art imagery, stemming from the salvage ethnographic interviews of the /Xam in Cape Town at the turn of the century by Bleek and Lloyd (1911) and their contemporaries (Bleek 1924; Lewis-Williams 2001; Stow 1905). From this body of narratives, Lewis-Williams (1981) originally constructed a valuable framework link ing rock art imagery with the experiences of shamans during altered states of consciousness. Outside of South Africa, there is a large body of literature dealing with forager landscape encul turation, the social construction of religiously meaningful places, and the organization of social space. In particular, Australian rock art research has tended to approach forager rock art from a land scape perspective, focusing on the accurate loca</page><page sequence="5">McCall] CHANGING VIEWS OF DRAKENSBERG SAN ROCK ART 777 tion of rock art imagery within the wider context of a spatial/temporal framework. For example, Rosenfeld (1997) offers a compelling account of the ways in which the rock art of the arid zones of western and central Australia affect many crucial aspects of social interaction between individuals and the landscape, as well as economic use of the landscape. In this way, Rosenfeld breaks down the epistemological barrier between content-based rock art research and artifact-based studies of land scape use. In a separate but related vein, Chippin dale and Tacon (1998) discuss the construction of chronological frameworks in the Northern Territory using both chronometric and seriation-based approaches, allowing them to recognize temporal variation in rock art production. As a contrast, these authors specifically single out South African rock art research for its lack of chronological specificity and ignorance of large-scale spatial variation (cf. Mazel and Watchman 1997, 2003). More recently, ethnoarchaeological research, such as that of Jordan (2003), has begun to address important questions of the role of landscape encul turation and decoration in shaping forager social, economic, and religious dynamics. This work is sig nificant because it makes explicit links between forager cosmological beliefs, religious structures, social practices, social relationships, and the pat terning of landscape decoration. This offers a valu able approach for widening studies of rock art beyond the content of individual panels in order to see integration with basic social and religious prac tices. While South African rock art research is quite sophisticated in approaching rock art imagery using ethnographic and ethnohistorical texts (Lewis Williams 2006), it has tended to ignore this impor tant parallel research trajectory. Another important archaeological property of rock art as a class of artifact is its tendency to act like a palimpsest. This is true in both archaeolog ical and art-historical senses, with rock art accu mulating in terms of significant superposition at the panel scale, and conflated assemblages of rock art at the landscape scale (McCall 2007; Smith 2001). The palimpsest quality of rock art has important implications for long-term processes of landscape enculturation, as early accumulations of rock art strongly influence both the location and content of later accumulations. In this way, rock art is a valu able source of evidence concerning the longue duree of forager interactions with the landscape and the cosmological and social structures that under lie them (Braudel 1980; McCall 2007). This study seeks to make some basic steps toward the recog nition of variability in the characteristics of rock art sites at several spatial scales, and seeks to relate this variability to patterns of landscape use, orga nization, and enculturation in the past. Geographical Characteristics of the Didima Gorge and Rock Art Site Locations The extensive rock art recording of Pager (1971) includes many typological characteristics of 3,909 individual rock art elements from 17 painted sites. Pager also reports other archaeological information from the surface collection of artifacts and limited excavations at 11 sites with rock art and 4 unpainted sites. The analysis presented in this paper restricts its scope to only 14 of these sites, excluding those with fewer than 20 individual rock art elements for the reason of sample size. This paper starts with the basic premise that variation in the imagery at rock art sites, at least in part, relates to the position of sites on the landscape. In other words, this paper examines the proposi tion that locations of certain kinds of ritual, social, and economic activities depended on characteris tics of the landscape and the socially constructed divisions of space for various purposes. The main goal of this analysis is to demonstrate that the con text of rock art sites is variable, and that not all rock art sites worked the same way in the past. The Didima Gorge is divided into three eleva tion zones with archaeological remains present: (1) high rock shelters, which formed on the shoulder of the mountains at the boundaries between sand stone layers; (2) low rock shelters, which formed in the same manner as the high shelters, but are located near the base of the gorge; and (3) river side rocks, which are huge boulders that eroded out of the sandstone strata and rolled to the base of the gorge alongside the river. Figure 3 shows a gener alized profile of the Didima Gorge, demonstrating the locations of archaeological sites on these land scape features. These distinctions between land scape elements provide one important framework for this analysis. One distinction between rock art site types was immediately apparent upon basic inspection of the data: Didima Gorge has a stark contrast between</page><page sequence="6">778 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 75, No. 4, 2010 6, 7? 12, 13? 14 Figure 3. Generalized diagram of rock shelter levels in the Didima Gorge and the location of rock painting sites at each level. large and small rock art sites. Figure 4 shows a his togram representing the number of paintings at the 17 painted shelters. This pattern is common to other regions of southern African rock paintings, and has been identified by Kinahan (1991) in the Brand berg of Namibia, Garlake (1995) in Zimbabwe, and Willcox (1984) in the Drakensberg. As these researchers have noted, this basic distinction in rock art site characteristics immediately demon strates that the archaeological context of rock sites was not the same, raising the likelihood that rock art was placed at certain sites for different reasons. There is also an important landscape element in terms of the differentiation between large and small sites. Figure 5 shows a box plot representing the number of rock art elements per site broken down by location on the landscape. This clearly shows the tendency for large rock art sites to form in low rock shelters. Once again, this is not a revelation for southern African rock art researchers, but it does raise a number of important questions con cerning why large sites tend to occur at this land scape location. One possibility that is frequently raised is that these were convenient locations for habitation sites, and that rock art accumulated in large quantities in the context of domestic activi ties. This explanation was particularly popular among "art for the sake of art" rock art researchers, such as Willcox (1984) and Woodhouse (1969), who tended to see all San rock art as domestic dec 14 12 10 C/) 8 E6 z 4 2 0 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 Total Number of Paintings Figure 4.

Box plot showing variation in the number of paint elements for the three levels in the Didima Gorge. oration of one form or another. In the Brandberg, Kinahan (1991; see also McCall 2004) prefers to see large sites as the locations of dry-season multi band aggregations, where several bands would join and concentrate around reliable water sources. Thus, he attributes the large site/small site dichotomy to seasonal variation in group size and mobility. In both models, large rock art sites are seen as resulting from exclusively domestic con texts. While the connection between large sites and long-term habitation makes sense, is it possible that ritual rather than economic contexts might affect aspects of this patterning? This is an extremely important question, and Pager's (1971:37) surface collections offer another source of information with which to examine it. For the purposes of this analy sis, it was assumed that, at the three sites where no artifacts were reported, there were no artifacts pre sent. This avenue of investigation works from the assumption that the number of artifacts present at a painted rock shelter acts as an index of the inten sity and/or the duration of economic site use. In other words, the more frequently and the longer a site was used, the more archaeological waste should be present (see Yellen [1977] for an ethnoarchae ological explication of this principle). Obviously, surface collections at rock art sites with a great deal of public traffic are not ideal sources of informa tion. However, there were large-scale differences in artifact concentrations that are useful in terms of thinking about site functions. If rock art accumulated at archaeological sites as a function of the length of occupation and/or the number of individuals present, then we should expect a strong direct relationship between the number of artifacts present at sites and the number of rock art elements. In order to test this expecta tion, a regression was performed examining the relationship between the total numbers of painting elements at each site with the total number of surface-collected artifacts, excluding faunal remains. The results of the regression weakly sup port this expectation (r2= .465; Beta = .682; F = 7.831; p = .021). While statistically significant, the correlation was unexpectedly weak, even given the presence of a bimodal distribution of data points (in other words, the large site/small site dichotomy). Figure 6 shows the studentized residual values for the number of paintings for each surface-collected painted site compared with the adjusted predicted values. Three of the four sites with the highest num ber of rock paintings were the most extreme out liers in this regression. This suggests that there were, in fact, significant non-economic factors influencing the occurrence of large rock art sites and that rock art sites formed at locations without significant domestic activity.</page><page sequence="8">780 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 75, No. 4, 2010 Adjusted Predicted Value Figure 6. Graph plotting the studentized residual values against the adjusted predicted values for the number of paint ing elements at each site based on the number of surface-collected artifacts. Two of the large sites, Botha's Shelter and Junc tion Shelter, both had a much larger than predicted number of rock paintings based on the number of artifacts recovered during surface collection. In contrast, Poacher's Shelter had far fewer paintings than predicted and also a relatively large unpainted section of the rockshelter. The third large site, Sebaaieni Cave, is relatively close to the predicted value. There are also four sites with substantial accumulations of surface artifacts and paintable rock surfaces with no rock paintings. These facts have the implication that some large rock art sites were associated with intense (probably domestic) economic activity, while others were not. They also demonstrate that the number of rock paintings pre sent at a site is not mainly a function of the size of the available painted area. Sebaaieni Cave most clearly represents a site with intensive domestic economic activity?in other words, it is the clearest case of a "home base." It has both many paintings and surface-collected artifacts, and also shows other evidence for regu lar occupation, including clear hearth areas and heavy architectural lower grinding slabs. Poacher's Shelter also has many artifacts but relatively few paintings, and it is also a good candidate for a domestic site. Like Sebaaieni Cave, it also has clear hearth areas and lower grinding stones. These sites support the idea that rock art was frequently pro duced at domestic sites. There are also several large sites that do not fit the expectations of the characteristics of domestic sites. Botha's Shelter and Junction Shelter repre sent a category of site with a large number of paint ings but relatively few artifacts. In contrast with Sebaaieni Cave and Poacher's Shelter, these sites do not have many features associated with occu pation, such as hearths or lower grinding slabs. Botha's Shelter was discovered in a highly intact state by the forester A.P. Botha in 1957, and the site showed a very high degree of preservation and very little subsequent human disturbance. Interestingly, it has no hearths, no other domestic features, nor any evidence for occupation in general. This site is also in a high and difficult to reach location. It is not accessible from the river floor, and it is easiest to access from the top of the gorge rather than the base. The isolated and secluded position of Botha's Shelter explains its late discovery; it casts doubt on the functionality of the site as a residential center since it would be laborious to reach the river in the valley floor on a daily basis. This points to the intentional selection of this site for painting because of its secluded location. The characteristics of Junction Shelter are quite complex and warrant special attention. Like</page><page sequence="9">McCall] CHANGING VIEWS OF DRAKENSBERG SAN ROCK ART 781 Botha's Shelter, this site has far fewer artifacts than would be expected given the extremely large num ber of paintings. Interestingly, the artifacts that are present are almost all lithic pieces, with very few ceramics (perhaps a total of two vessels [Pager 1971]). The site has no visible hearths, but does show some evidence for occupation, including 20 grinding stone fragments and one architectural lower grinding stone?by far the largest number of such artifacts in the area. One quite speculative explanation for this pattern is that Junction Shelter might have been a home base location in early time periods, explaining the large number of lithics and grinding stones. Then, as the incidence of local conflict increased, the site ceased to be occupied as a residential center in a regular way, as it is located in a vulnerable position at the junction of the Didima Gorge with the main canyon. The use of lithic tools declined over time in the Drakensberg, as access to iron implements became more common. For example, Gooch (1882) notes the almost exclusive use of iron tools by the Drak ensberg San by the mid-nineteenth century. Also, the use of ceramics acquired through exchange with neighboring groups increased in later time periods (Plug et al. 2003). Early periods of occu pation followed by abandonment and subsequent use of the site for painting would explain the large number of lithics and grinding stone fragments, the small number of ceramics, and the lack of visible hearth features. In this sense, the context of rock art production at Junction Shelter might have begun as mainly domestic, and then shifted as the loca tions of habitation sites moved farther up the gorge. Comparisons with Sebaaieni Cave and Poacher's Shelter further suggest that the lower part of the gorge was more intensively occupied in earlier time periods, and that the upper portion of the gorge was occupied in later time periods. The remaining seven sites are quite similar, with a relatively small number of paintings and few arti facts. These sites are mainly located on riverside boulders and in low rock shelters near the base of the gorge. These sites were the least extensively sur face collected, which mainly resulted from the fact that most contained no or very few surface artifacts. In this way, the small sites at the base of the gorge near the river represent their own category of site type, separate from the large domestic and large non-domestic sites. Pager's Recording and Pattern Recognition Data Analysis Another important line of evidence for examining spatial variation in rock art site composition at the landscape scale is the extremely detailed typolog ical catalog of the 3,909 recorded rock art elements at the 17 painted sites reported by Pager (1971). This offers an ideal dataset for examining spatial variation in the occurrence of various rock art ele ment types. Pager originally reports 66 categories of elements2; this is actually too detailed to be very useful for statistical analysis, since many sites often lack elements belonging to many of the existing cat egories. For this reason, this analysis collapsed the original typological framework into one with only 15 categories (listed in Table 1). This was accom plished largely by combining categories with small numbers of data points. Even with the simplification of the typological scheme, this left the daunting task of comparing head-to-head the frequencies of 17 variables (the rock art element categories in addition to the fre quencies of lithics and ceramics) for 14 separate rock art sites. For the purposes of data reduction, a principal components analysis (PCA) was per formed using these 17 variables and the individual rock art sites as cases. This analysis also included the frequencies of ceramic pieces and lithics as two variables. The PCA produced a three-component solu tion reported in Table 2. The first component explained 63.5 percent of the variation, the second component explained 19.5 percent of the variation, and the third component explained 11.1 percent of the variation. All other components combined explained less than 6 percent of the total variation. A varimax rotation was performed to clarify the initial solution and used to generate regression scores for the cases showing how strongly each rock art site correlates with each of the three com ponents.3 The main question for this analysis concerned the recognition of the co-occurrence of certain ele ment types. In other words, were there rock art ele ments that tended to appear together as a package at these rock art sites? Addressing this question is an important first step toward understanding the spatial variation in the occurrence of these element packages. The PC loading scores were used as a basis for clustering variables, and Figure 7 shows</page><page sequence="10">782 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 75, No. 4, 2010 Table 1.

It was gen erally associated with occupation sites, being most prominent at Sebaaieni Cave. A good inference from this may be that this list of categories repre sents a pattern of rock art imagery associated with mainly domestic contexts. The cluster that corresponds with the second PC contains men, women, humans, winged anthro pomorphic figures (ales), baboons, cows/sheep, and other animals. This set of variables is largely driven by the large accumulation of rock art at Junc tion Shelter. This finding is interesting, given the earlier proposition that this site was an early occu pation and later reused in other contexts related to the production of rock art. In this sense, it is an odd combination of domestic and religious space that is unlike Sebaaieni Cave, though the two share many important characteristics. The cluster that corresponds with the third PC contains children, eland, tools, and obscure figures, and this component stems mostly from the rock art at Botha's Shelter. As this site is remote, secluded, and mostly lacking surface artifacts, this rock art would seem to belong to mainly religious/ritual contexts rather than being associated with the loca tions of other kinds of economic activity. This set of categories is interesting, as it contains eland (which are among the most common element types), alongside children and obscure figures (which are quite rare). The category of obscure fig ures refers to geometric, non-representational ele ments, referred to as entoptic phenomena by Lewis-Williams and Dowson (1988).

For the purposes of clustering sites, a series of PC regression scores was calculated, measuring how strongly sites corresponded with the principal components. Figure 8 shows a dendrogram based on a cluster analysis informed by these PC regres sion scores. This cluster analysis in many ways mirrors the distinctions in site types recognized through the comparison of the number of rock art elements and surface-collected artifacts at the sites. It clearly suggests that there are three kinds of sites based on content in terms of rock art elements and surface artifacts: (1) large domestic sites, perhaps "home bases," (2) large uninhabited sites, and (3) small, isolated sites. In short, this finding shows that there is variation in the content of rock art sites that both mirrors their larger archaeological context and has a strong relationship with their position on the landscape. Not only does this strongly confirm the notion that rock art was made at different points on the landscape for different purposes and in differ ent contexts, it actually points to some clear possi bilities in terms of how this division of space might have worked in the past. The information derived from the PCA can also be applied directly to the landscape-scale spatial analysis. Figure 9 and Table 3 show the percentage of the total rock art elements belonging to each of the PC categories. Figures 10-12 show maps of the regression scores for the three components for the various sites in the Didima Gorge and Table 4 shows the frequencies of rock art sites belonging to each component broken down by landscape location.

This analysis has clearly suggested that there are three separate and distinct rock art site types in the Didima Gorge. This finding supports the ideas that, (1) not all rock art sites formed as the result of iden tical social, religious, or economic contexts, and (2) it is possible to recognize the formal differences between rock art site types at the landscape scale. A more difficult question concerns the relationship of these observed rock art site types to the actual contexts in which they were made and the next sec tion offers a brief discussion of some possibilities in that regard.

This information, in turn, offers an important basis for addressing theoretical questions concerning the division of economic, social, and ritual division of space by forager groups. This methodological approach is essentially a tool for landscape-scale pattern recognition; identified patterns, then, become the basis for the generation of research questions and the evaluations of our models of past human cultural dynamics. One aspect of the observed patterning is espe cially interesting in terms of recent research on the role of shamanism in southern African rock art: the imagery most commonly attributed to altered states of consciousness occurs most frequently at the large, remote, and unoccupied sites. This suggests that not every southern African rock art site was equally related to trance dance rituals and that the large unoccupied rock art sites specifically may have been the locations of trance-related ritual activities done away from home bases. In his recent ethnoarchaeological work, Jordan (2003) offers a striking account of the performance of certain important rituals away from domestic areas at loca tions on the landscape with cosmological signifi cance (which are often decorated). The idea that some rituals cannot be performed near domestic areas is a very old one in anthropology, and is rem iniscent of Douglas' (1966) writings on the reli gious avoidance of domestic "pollution" under certain circumstances. One important possibility in terms of ritual con texts that is quite prominent in San ethnography and ethnohistory is the puberty initiation ritual. Male and female initiation rituals have been described in innumerable cross-cultural contexts and have also been suggested as the ritual context for many rock art sites around the world (e.g., Whitley 1998). They are frequently performed away from resi</page><page sequence="15">McCain CHANGING VIEWS OF DRAKENSBERG SAN ROCK ART 787 s^. Umhlwazine 1. Sebaaieni Cave 2. Elephant Shelter 3. Water Shelter 4.

For exam ple, among the Ju/'hoansi in the northwestern Kala hari, young male initiates are taken to secluded sites and sequestered for several weeks of exposure to extreme elements, hunger, thirst, and trance dancing (Biesele and Howell 1981; Lee 1979; Mar shall 1976). This is one clear possibility for the large unoccupied rock art sites in the Didima Gorge. The content of the large unoccupied sites is also quite interesting in terms of thinking about initia tion rituals. For example, at Botha's Shelter, there is the unusually frequent occurrence of elements depicting children, eland, tools, and geometric forms. The depiction of children at an initiation rit ual site might be expected, but the other motives are also quite interesting in this context. The eland is known to have had very important roles in both male and female puberty initiation ceremonies among both recent and historical San groups, and this is frequently cited in discussions of the eland in San rock art (e.g., Lewis-Williams and Dowson 1988; Vinnicombe 1976). Likewise, it is easy to construct narratives explaining the importance of subsistence tools and the supernatural potency rep resented by geometric forms for children transi tioning into adulthood. In addition, modern San initiation rituals also involve trance dancing, and the presence of geometric forms may point to depic Table 4.

While there is a strong case to be made for Botha's Shelter and, in later time periods, Junction Shelter as puberty initiation sites, this does not address the connection between the increasing fre quency of painting around and during the period of conflict in which it is situated. Presumably, with all other things being equal, there would not have been an increase in the number of puberty initia tions caused by some set of external variables. While there are innumerable potential explanations for this pattern, it may have been the case that there was generally an increase in all kinds of ritual related to painting. For example, Katz and col leagues (Katz 1985; Katz et al. 1997) demonstrate among the Ju/'hoansi in the Kalahari an increase in the frequency of trance dancing with periods of food shortage and other forms of social stress. This fact is employed by Kinahan (1991) in his seasonality-based account, which sees increased painting activities around waterhole localities dur ing stressful periods of the dry season. This is cer tainly a strong possibility for the Didima Gorge during this period of upheaval, as well. Another possibility is that the frequency of painting did not increase uniformly at all site types for the same unitary reason. In this sense, finer grained chronometric chronology of the rock art at various site types would be highly useful. Largely lacking this, the chronology of rock art sites can be addressed in less accurate ways with Pager's (1971) seriation-based relative approach. Unsurprisingly, Sebaaieni Cave, Poacher's Shelter, Junction Shel ter, and Botha's Shelter show the longest duration of painting activity?they are all large sites with many paintings. Future analyses might focus on establishing when the periods of most intense paint ing occurred at these large and important painted sites. The small sites are easier to deal with using seriation-based chronology, and they appear in higher frequency in later time periods. In fact, Pager (1971) suggests that several of the painted boulders have actually come after the stylistic period he places between 200-300 B.P., perhaps as recently as the early twentieth century. This interesting chronological pattern underscores the importance of the question of what the social or religious con text of these paintings was. Recently, Lewis-Williams and Pearce (2004a, 2004b) have suggested that some rock art sites were the locations where San shamans went to perform private rituals related to the magical influence of the natural world. Specifically, they suggest that this was sometimes the result of San shamans offering their rainmaking services to agricultural neighbors for payment or in the face of intimidation. This is a very interesting suggestion, and possibly applic able given the historical context of the rock art sites in the Didima Gorge. Furthermore, the individual and private use of rock art sites for magical pur poses has been historically documented in numer ous places around the world (e.g., Keyser and Whitley 2006), and such rock art sites have many similarities with the small sites in the Didima Gorge and elsewhere in the Drakensberg (Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2004a, 2004b). The content of the small isolated sites is also quite distinct from that of the larger sites in the Didima Gorge. The small isolated rock art sites tend to have far less superposition than do the larger sites and they are quite idiosyncratic in their con tent. For example, one Didima site is particularly well-known because of its unusual and highly infor mative content: Sorcerer's Rock. At this site, there is an example of a female figure carrying a bow and arrows with genital emissions running to other elements on the panel?a "mythic woman" in the language of Willcox (1984) and Solomon (1994:Figure 13). Such figures have been discussed by many scholars (e.g., Lewis-Williams 1981; Solomon 1994, 1998; Vinnicombe 1976; Willcox 1984), and continue to be an important topic of dis cussion concerning Drakensberg San ideology and gender. One possibility is that the lines emerging from the figure's exaggerated genitalia represent cosmological beliefs concerning the connection between menstruation, reproduction, life, death, rain, and renewal (Solomon 1994,1998). For these reasons, images such as these make a good deal of sense in the context of magical rainmaking, which touches on all of these cosmological concepts. In its search for rock art site types, this paper has shown the difficulties of category construction and the identification of the social, religious, and economic contexts in which rock art was made. Admittedly, much of this post hoc explanation of the observed patterning is quite speculative and dependent on further research for evaluation. At the</page><page sequence="17">McCall] CHANGING VIEWS OF DRAKENSBERG SAN ROCK ART 789 same time, it has shown that there is demonstrable spatial variation at the landscape-scale in the char acteristics and content of sites, and that not all rock art sites formed in the same context. While there is clearly a great deal of overlap and ambiguity in the past uses of rock art sites, it is equally clear that spatial variation can potentially provide crucial information concerning the social, religious, and economic division of the landscape. Perhaps this approach will prove productive in bridging the epis temological gap between our understanding of long-term cosmological orientations and specific historical contingencies as they affected rock art production. Conclusion Learning about the contexts in which rock art was made in the past depends on the recognition of spa tial patterning in the content of rock art sites. This paper has presented an analysis of spatial variation in the archaeological characteristics and content of rock art sites in the Didima Gorge. The recognized patterning demonstrates some important facts con cerning Drakensberg San rock art: (1) it is possi ble to recognize three basic rock art site types; (2) these site types relate to separate social, religious, and economic activity in which they were made; (3) the spatial variation offers important clues con cerning the organization and division of landscape; and (4) this information offers insight into the spe cific historical contexts acting on San peoples in the face of agropastoralist and European colonial expansion. Rock art, by definition, is a class of archaeo logical artifacts designed to mark space. More important than the specifics of scenarios offered to explain patterns of rock art in the Didima Gorge, this paper has presented a methodological approach for pattern recognition rooted in multivariate sta tistical and landscape-scale spatial analysis. As rock art datasets increase in number and quality, and GIS-based approaches to spatial analysis (e.g., viewshed and cost-path analyses) become more powerful, rock art researchers must expand their horizons to broader spatial and temporal scales.

Cobbing (1988) argues that the mfecane was nothing more than an "alibi" for colonial expansion into Natal invented by Eurocentric historians. In contrast, Etherington (2004) presents substantial evidence for conflict in at least part of the region, and this was likely the case for the Didima Gorge. 2. It is fair to question the validity of Pager's (1971) cat egorization of rock art elements in the light of subsequent research informed by San ethnography/ethnohistory (e.g., Lewis-Williams [1981] and later work). As a pilot study, this analysis is merely interested in understanding spatial varia tion in the frequencies of these elements as categorized by Pager. 3. It should be noted that the rotation of PC A solutions is somewhat controversial. For example, Jolliffe (1989) warns against rotating solutions until a pre-desired solution is attained (see also Baxter [1994]). This problem notwithstand ing, varimax rotation is recognized as a method for simplify ing or clarifying initial PCA solutions (Manly 2005). It keeps the principal components orthogonal while rotating them into a position that maximizes the difference between high and low values.
