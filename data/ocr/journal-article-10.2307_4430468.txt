<plain_text><page sequence="1">W. P?tscher, Strukturprobleme der aristotelischen und theophrastischen Gottesvorstellung (Philosophia Antiqua, 19). Leiden, Brill, 1970. XIV, 150 p. Pr. fl. 48,?. In his Introduction P. indicates the difference between ancient conceptions of god (including Plato's) and those shaped by Christian influence. Ancient thought distinguished various levels of divinity: on one level it finds a unity, on another it assumes a plurality of divine beings. Chapter II, on Aristotle, is subdivided into analyses of De Philosophia and of Metaphysics A. Theophrastus (ch. Ill) is discussed largely in terms of pe?? e?se?e?a? (P.'s own edition of the fragments is used as basic text). One notes that Theophrastus and Aristotle get equal space. P. even considers it possible that whereas Ar. never fully elaborated his theology (the Metaph. is but a blueprint), his pupil offers an extensive philosophical formulation of the idea of the divine ("im religi?sen Sinne"), just as he also continued Ar.'s zoological investigations (pp. 1-2). P.'s treatment of the early Aristotelian views could have profited Mnemosyne, Vol. XXVIII, Fase. 1 6</page><page sequence="2">82 DE NOVIS LIBRIS IUDICIA from an analysis of Plato's Timaeus. After all, there is sufficient reason to take De Philosophia as an alternative cosmology in view of Ar.'s criticism of Plato's theory of Ideas and his psychology *). If the fragments are one-sidedly studied in terms of Metaph. A, the danger of distortion is great. P. successfully demonstrates that Ar. and Th. both make a distinction within the sphere of the divine. At the highest level they clearly speak of one divine being while on a lower level there is a plurality of gods. The distinction mono- / poly-theistic is not ap- plicable to them (p. 31). But P. does not give us a comprehensive treatment of the theology of these Greek thinkers. To clarify the conception contained in De Philos. P. uses the key- fragment 26 (Ross). Information from other testimonies which are often related to the dialogue is but seldom used, although P. fails to indicate whether he questions their reliability. Fr. 26 is likely to remain a bone of contention for some time. P.'s discussion of the various parts is clear. He holds that one should distinguish (a) one highest, transcendental (p. 42) deity called ????; (b) an alius quidam; and (c) the various individual heavenly bodies also called divine. Most important is the distinction between (a) and (b) (p. 29). According to P., the term alius quidam proves that this god is different from (a). So (a) and (b) are not merely two ways of speaking about the same divine substance. It should be remem- bered, however, that this is related to an evaluation of the text as a whole. P.'s interpretation of multa turbot (p. 35, "Aporie des Stagiriten" or "ein Missverst?ndniss der Tradition"?P. chooses the second possibility) neglects the fact that Epicurean polemics show httle respect for the intention of the partners in a discussion. It is conceivable that in this text also matters not divided by Aristotle himself are purposely separated and called contradictory. I agree with P. that already in De Philos, the divine mind will have oc- cupied the highest place in reality. But there is insufficient proof for its being transcendental in the sense of meta-physical a). In the section dealing with Ar.'s later views, the author is especially concerned with the position of Metaph. A and its ch. 8. He ably defends assignment of a late date to Book ? against I. During (pp. 71-73). ?) Cf. the replacement of ???? as a??? ????se?? of the s??ata (Phaedrus and Leges X) in De Caelo I, c. 2 (which is early) by the f?s?? immanent in the five elements.

P. relates the sacrificial gifts mentioned there (a ???? ?a?a???, a ???? apa???, and "mass- volle Gabe") to a (transcendental) ????, the astral deities and the anthropomorphic deities respectively, on the assumption that sacrifices should correspond with the nature of the deity (pp. 80, 82-86). As to the criticism of the idea of an unmoved transcendental mover in Th. Metaph. c. 2, 5, 8 P. remarks that "das sogenannte metaphysische Bruchst?ck . .. keine entsprechende Basis darstellt" (pp. 82; 108 n. 3), This is certainly inadequate. This criticism renders a transcendental character of the world-???? as in Ar. Mdaph. A (p. 84) unlikely. And how can one infer a correspondence between the qualification of the soul as apa??? in fr. 8 and of the heavens in Ar. De Caelo A 3, 270 b 2 and ? ?, 284 a 14 (pp. 89-92) ? If the author would defend this in terms of "fliessende ?berg?nge" (p. 89), one would suspect him of Heraclitism. Finally, one could doubt the Theophrastic origin of fr. 8 (as does ?. B. Gottschalk, J.H.S. 88 (1968), 169 and Gnomon 41 (1969), 341) in spite of the author's defense on pp. 145-146. I am afraid that this work cannot be recommended without reservations : many parts of it fail to convince the reader. Nieuw VENNEP, Zichtweg 16 A. P. Bos</page></plain_text>
