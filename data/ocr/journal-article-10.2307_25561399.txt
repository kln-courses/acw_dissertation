<plain_text><page sequence="1">D Malachi O'Doherty / culture The God that Richard Dawkins refutes is the God of the fundamentalist. Can't atheism do bette than this? The sea leaps its bounds and suddenly we are ants, as expendable in nature's scheme as maggots or autumn leaves that will be next year's topsoil. The ardent atheist Richard Dawkins is contemptuous of the question why. In a letter to the Guardian he asked: "In what sense of the word 'why' does plate tectonics not provide the answer?" Dawkins calls us back from religious fuzziness to science and reason, to "face reality and do something constructive about human suffering". That's all very well but there is in fact no indication that those who grapple with the challenge this disaster poses to the question of God are neglecting to face the practical problems too. There was an unbroken flow of contributions to Black Santa at St Anne's. A church had become a focus for a practical, helpful response to the disaster - not a refuge for breastbeating and helpless God-botherers troubled by the collapse of the theology of the benign creator. This suggests that Dawkins is fighting the wrong cause. Dawkins scores by demanding logic of religious believers but religious believers - many of them - know their faith and doubts are not founded on logic. Still, the disaster is a reminder of the paradoxes in the popular conceptions of God. If God is all-powerful and could have stopped the wave but didn't, then he doesn't love us as much as people say. The usual responses to this are to say he is testing us and ultimately that the disaster is for the good of us all because it brings out our generosity. This suggests a God who behaves like a child poking a stick through the bars of a monkey house, who chastens them by occasionally taking some out and killing them. No matter how ennobling the experience might be for the survivors it does little credit to the person providing it. If God is good then he must not be omnipotent but if he is not omnipotent he is not God, surely? But the theology of the benign creator collapses as readily before one child with cancer as before a tsunami. But the tsunami reminds us that we live vulnerable lives on an unstable planet. Presumably the planet's instability has been a great aid to evolution but there is no comfort in that. We think and aspire as individuals. Nature has no investment in us as individuals and will sweep us aside. That's a gloomy and a sobering thought. That's the sort of thought that might turn one to wondering what really matters and has value in a world in which we are so expendable ourselves. That's why people ask religious questions, even when nature puts the idea of a good, all-powerful God aside so lightly. In the past, the Christian world responded to our vulnerability by fearing God and attempting to placate him. Hindus responded by treating the world as an illusion which we would reincarnate into until we were sick of it. Neither approach was conducive to making the best of the vulnerable life that we have but if Dawkins can't see that people need to address their imaginations for some comfort, beyond the promise that science will give us all the answers someday, then he must be more ; , j ;i5i ..... , ,,G2 .....ig?:&gt; 8#'?.:oi.;::i : .....

There is something a bit evangelical about Dawkins. He is proselytising for the logical response and with passion. What he is really saying, I think, is that putting your faith in science is a better philosophical response to disaster than grasping for a meaning to life. He is wasting his breath if these are not really mutually exclusive anyway. It is pathetic that so much discussion on religion among believers still assumes that a personal anthropomorphic God is a literal fact but it is inexcusable that secular rationalists make the same mistake of taking all meaningful religion for anthropomorphism and imagining that they refute the religious aspiration by debunking the personal God. They are in fact doing no more than many thoughtful believers themselves did in the 19th century. The rational atheists are not doing very well at refuting religious faith if they can only take on the fundamentalist and define God in their terms. i ...i...............d ........... .i..a.K.
