Wolfson Tiqqun ha-Shekhinah: REDEMPTION AND THE OVERCOMING OF GENDER DIMORPHISM IN THE MESSIANIC KABBALAH OF MOSES HAYYIM LUZZATTO REDEMPTION AS UNION OF MASCULINE AND FEMININE It is commonplace in scholarship to assume that the distinctive feature of the kabbalistic idea of redemption involves the reunification of the masculine and the feminine aspects of the divine. Historical exile is understood widely in the theosophic kabbalistic tradition as a reflection of a fissure or an imbalance within the nature of God that results from the separation of the male and the female, the holy King (Tif'eret) and the Matrona (Shekhinah). The redemptive moment is marked by the rec- tification of this condition, which again is operative in both the divine and the human spheres.1 One must naturally avoid the temptation to treat the kabbalah as a monolithic phenomenon in the religious history of Judaism,2 but it is nevertheless accurate to isolate certain patterns of thought and symbolic 1 See G.

The issue of exile and redemp- tion is one such recurring theme that intertextually links kabbalists in different historical periods and geographical regions. Whatever the com- plicated layers of theosophic speculation that evolved in the course of the centuries, particularly in the doctrines promulgated by Isaac Luria (1534-72) and his disciples in sixteenth-century Safed, the basic idea of the harmony of masculine and feminine potencies in the divine lies at the foundation of the kabbalistic idea of redemption.3 In support of this claim a plethora of texts could have been cited, but for the purposes of this introductory comment it will be sufficient to mention one passage from Moses Cordovero (1522-70), who expressed the idea succinctly in his interpretation of the verses, "He shall come as a redeemer to Zion, to those in Jacob who turn back from sin declares the Lord. As for Me, this shall be My covenant with them, said the Lord" (Isa. 59:20-21): "He shall come as a redeemer," the Messiah (semah ge'ullah) is in Yesod who causes the redemption to overflow below. "To those in Jacob who turn back from sin," they reflect the blemish from the aspect of repentance, which is Binah. "De- clares the Lord," Tif'eret and Malkhut. "As for Me, this shall be My covenant," the bond of Malkhut in Tif'eret. "As for Me" (wa-'ani), [the word] 'ani refers to Malkhut below and the waw to Tif'eret above. "This" (zo't) refers to Malkhut below and "My covenant" (beriti) to Yesod. Thus are the two aspects, Malkhut in Tif'eret and Malkhut in Yesod.4 Cordovero captures an essential aspect of the kabbalistic idea of messi- anic redemption: The primary locus of the redeemer is Yesod, the at- tribute that corresponds to the divine phallus, for this gradation is the conduit that connects the masculine and the feminine. The moment of redemption thus entails the unification of Tif'eret and Malkhut through the phallic Yesod.5 The explicit statements of the kabbalists depicting the redemption in terms of the motif of the hieros gamos have led a variety of scholars to affirm that the messianic ideal in kabbalistic literature is predicated on the conjunction of the masculine and the feminine rather than the neu- 3 This is the conclusion reached in the most recent comprehensive studies of the messi- anic elements in Lurianic kabbalah.

A typical statement to this effect is offered by Gershom Scholem in his brief account of the doctrine of re- demption according to the Zohar: In the present state of exile, there is the disjunction of the bride and the groom in the Godhead. With the advent of the messianic redemption the perfect unity of the sefirotic realm is reestablished and "the Shekhinah will be restored to perpetual union with her husband."6 In several publications, I have argued that the image of heterosexual pairing is appropriate only in the first stage of the redemptive process in which the exilic condition of separation and frag- mentation begins to be overcome. The consequence of the unification, however, is the restoration of the feminine to the masculine. This resto- ration does not entail, as Scholem would have it, the perpetual union of the Shekhinah and her husband, but the ontic assimilation of the former in the latter. That this reintegration involves the subjugation of the fe- male to the male is expressed in the repeated claim of the kabbalists that the attribute of judgment (linked to the feminine) is ameliorated by the attribute of mercy (linked to the masculine). Although mercy itself is obviously transformed by its union with judgment, the effect of the transformation is not reciprocal, for the union of male and female results in judgment being overwhelmed by mercy, which translates into the masculinization of the feminine rather than the feminization of the mas- culine. In the union of the sexes, therefore, the binary opposition is tran- scended by the restoration of the female to the male. The most telling symbolic depiction used by kabbalists to convey the ontological trans- mutation of the feminine into the masculine is the identification of the feminine as the corona of the phallus ('ateret berit). The image of the phallic crown, also depicted in terms of the rabbinic eschatological mo- tif of the crown worn by the righteous in the world to come, conveys the idea of the stabilization of the feminine, the overcoming of female otherness and the consequent reconfiguration of the androgynous unity of the divine. The ontic restoration of the feminine to the masculine is expressed as well in terms of the biblical locution, "a capable wife is a crown for her husband" (Prov. 12:4). Redemption in its ultimate sense does not signify the perpetual pairing of male and female, but the recon- stitution of androgyny in the Godhead in which the gender dimorphism is superseded.7 6 G.

I am concerned rather with analyzing Luzzatto's thought on the basis of his own writings. Moreover, I am deliberately avoiding the impor- tant question of Luzzatto's understanding of the anthropomorphic images used by kab- balists in their description of the divine. Luzzatto saw his major task as providing an alternative to the literalist and the metaphorical approaches. According to Luzzatto, the divine gradations are spiritual forms that assume visual shape only within the imaginative faculty, which is the psychic agency correlated with the Shekhinah. Compare Moses lHayyim Luzzatto, Qin'at ha-Shem Seva'ot, in his Ginze Ramhal, ed. H. Friedlander (Bene Beraq, 1984), pp. 80-82, 138, Ma'amar ha-Wikkuah, in his Sha'are Ramhal, ed. H.

Avivi, "Ma'amar ha-Wikkuah of Ramhal" (in Hebrew), Ha-Ma'ayan 15 (1974-75): 49-58, esp. 52-53; J.

Schatz, "Ramhal's Metaphysics in Its Ethical Context (a study in Qelah Pithei Hokhma)" (in Hebrew), Jeru- salem Studies in Jewish Thought 9 (1990): 361-96, esp. 371-73. Schatz, p. 373, n. 26, re- marks that the imaginative function is attributed to the Shekhinah as well in Abraham Cohen Herrera's Sha'ar ha-Shamayim, which she assumes had a major impact on Luzzatto. (Regarding this influence, see also N. Yosha, Myth and Metaphor: Abraham Cohen Her- rera's Philosophic Interpretation of Lurianic Kabbalah [in Hebrew] [Jerusalem, 1994], pp. 357-58.) It must be pointed out, however, that in earlier kabbalistic literature, espe- cially the later strata of the zoharic corpus, the same function is assigned to the Shekhinah. See E. R. Wolfson, Through a Speculum That Shines: Vision and Imagination in Medieval Jewish Mysticism (Princeton, N.J., 1994), pp. 312-16. The relevant zoharic material un- doubtedly influenced Luzzatto. I note, finally, that the claim of G. Scholem, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (New York, 1954), p. 272, that Luzzatto's theistic interpretation of the Lurianic doctrine of the parsufim was "designed to strip it of its obvious mythical ele- ments," is far too simplistic an assessment of the symbolic approach of Luzzatto. In my opinion, Luzzatto does embrace the mythical core of the earlier theosophic kabbalah, ex- pressed in the zoharic and Lurianic materials, but he locates the structure of the myth in the human imagination. On the nexus of exile, dream, and imagination, see Moses Hayyim Luzzatto, 'Adir ba-Marom (Jerusalem, 1990), p. 281: "The aspect of dream is also in the exile, and it is not from the secret of this awakening, for its secret is the imagination. The soul that sees what it sees outside the body depicts these things in the imagination." See the recent analysis in J. Hansel, "La cabale et la philosophie dans l'oeuvre de Moise Hayyim Luzzatto (1707-1746)" (Ph.D. thesis, Sorbonne, 1996), pp. 178-81. 9 To date, the most comprehensive treatment of Luzzatto's messianic posture and its re- lation to Sabbatianism can be found in the various essays by I.

Indeed, one of the main reforms (taqqanot) that bound together the members of Luz- zatto's secret circle of illuminati, the hevrat mevaqshe ha-shem, the "fra- ternity of those who seek the Lord,"l which were formulated in the contract of unity (shetar ha-hitqashrut) drafted in all probability in 1731,12 involved the study of kabbalistic lore "for the sake of the rec- tification of the holy Shekhinah and the rectification of all of Israel."13 Similarly, in Adir ba-Marom, his lengthy commentary on the 'Idra' Rabba' one of the most recondite sections of the Zohar, composed in the early months of 1731,14 Luzzatto remarks that "the first principle of ev- erything and the foundation of everything is that study should be only for the sake of the rectification of the Shekhinah."15 In another passage from this work, Luzzatto makes an even more general statement in the context of commenting on the description of the enlightened kabbalists, the maskilim, as "reapers of the field" (mehasde haqla'), at the beginning of the 'Idra' Rabba' (Zohar 3:127b): You must know that the essence of a person's action is to direct his ways and his conduct for the sake of rectifying the Shekhinah....

See Tishby, Studies in Kabbalah and Its Branches, p. 984. 14 According to a letter that Luzzatto wrote to Isaiah Bassan, dated on Lag ba-'Omer 1731, the composition of the commentary to this part of the Zohar was already completed.

The secret of the matter is that the mystical intent of all the acts of worship ('avodah) that men perform for the Holy One, blessed be He, is that they constitute the working of the field ('avodat ha-sadeh), and this is the eso- teric significance of "a king is enslaved to the land" (melekh le-sadeh ne'evad) (Eccles. 5:8), for just as there are many different types of work that pertain to the field, and all are necessary to bring about the improvement (tiqqun) that is required by it, so too the Shekhinah has such a need. These acts of labor are ver- ily the miswot, for they, too, are of varied species. Thus it is written, "Though you take much seed out to the field, you shall gather in little" (Deut. 28:38), and it is also written, "You have been sowing, but have nothing to reap" (Micah 6:15). The secret of this is that the miswot act by way of planting, for the lights are sown in Nuqba', which is the field. When the [time of] reaping has been reached, that is, to bring out of the Nuqba' for those that are below, it says, "Sin couches at the door" (Gen. 4:7). Sitra' 'Ahra' grows stronger to take this light. If there is no one who knows how to harvest the field properly, the light does not spread forth so as not to be given to Sitra' 'Ahra' in the secret of "He has withdrawn His right hand in the presence of the foe" (Lam. 2:3). Yet, he who receives upon himself the matter of the rectification of the Shekhinah, he ascends to take the light from the place that Sitra' 'Ahra' does not reach and he brings it below. When it is taken from the man it is guarded, for all of the danger is in the dis- semination from Malkhut to humanity. And this is in truth the matter of the stu- dents of the academy of Rashbi, may peace be upon him, constantly going out on journeys and studying the secrets, for this is verily the true way to perform this rectification. This is a matter that Rashbi taught them.16 The true end of all human action, and not just the study of Torah, is the messianic task of tiqqun ha-shekhinah. More specifically, Luzzatto iden- tifies the traditional commandments (miswot) as the different forms of labor that one performs in the field. Through ritual acts one sows seeds of light into the feminine like the farmer who plants different crops in the ground. The theurgical significance of the act of sowing seeds into the earth is implied in Luzzatto's citation of the verse, "a king is en- slaved to the land," melekh le-sadeh ne'evad (Eccles. 5:8). The labor of the righteous below in working the field through ritual observance stim- ulates the labor above performed by the king working the field, which is symbolic of the sexual union of Tif'eret and Malkhut. In the time of reaping, however, the task is to draw out the light from the feminine to benefit those below her. At this moment of liminality, the demonic "other side" is strengthened in its effort to take the light, a mythic drama that Luzzatto links to the verse, "Sin couches at the door" (Gen. 4:7). The kabbalists are the "reapers of the field," for they know how to ascend to the place beyond the reach of the other side to harvest the light ('or) from the ether ('awir) of the supernal Garden of Eden. The activity associated with reaping the field is the exposition of the secrets 16 Ibid., p. 37. 294</page><page sequence="7">History of Religions of Torah, particularly as they are studied in proximity to open spaces as one journeys on the way in the pattern of the disciples of Simeon bar Yohai described in the Zohar. The tiqqun is achieved, therefore, by the maskilim who depart in a state of ecstasy from the world and ascend to the Shekhinah in order to draw forth the light that is hidden therein, a light that is contained as well in the secrets of Torah.17 Thus, the mas- kilim are on a par with Moses, who is also identified with the soul of the Messiah,18 for "they are established in the secret of Yesod to overflow afterward to others, and this is [the intent of the verse] 'And the enlight- ened will shine like the splendor of the firmament and those who lead the many to righteousness [will be like the stars forever and ever]' (Dan. 12:3), for the Messiah is called righteous, in the secret 'he is righteous and victorious' (Zech. 9:9), and those who are strengthened in his power are called righteous. This is [the meaning of] 'This is the gateway to the Lord, the righteous shall enter through it' (Ps. 118:20)."19 Esoteric gno- sis is thus considered the "true way" (derekh ha-'amiti) to effect the tiqqun, for this form of study facilitates the union of the Shekhinah with the upper masculine potencies by means of the maskilim who are in the position of Yesod.20 The process of enlightenment (haskalah) is com- pared to the flame glowing from the coal, the latter serving as the mate- rial base for the former. The flame in all of its colors is identified as the 17 Ibid., p. 44, where Luzzatto expresses this idea in terms of a well-known numerology used by kabbalists, 'or (light) = raz (secret). 18 Ibid., p. 43. In many of his works, Luzzatto repeats the identification of Moses and the Messiah, an identification that underscores his own messianic pretensions as well as his belief that he was the reincarnation of Moses in his generation. Compare Moses Hayyim Luzzatto, Ma'amar ha-Ge'ullah (Jerusalem, 1990), pp. 24, 96-97. On other occa- sions, Luzzatto speaks of the triad of Moses and the two messianic figures, Messiah son of David and Messiah son of Joseph. For example, cf. Moses Hayim Luzzatto, introduction to his Shiv'im Tiqqunim (Jerusalem, 1991), p. 10, Qin'at ha-Shem Seva'ot (n. 8 above), p. 98, Ma'amar ha-Ge'ullah, p. 68, and TQT"W Tefillot (n. 8 above), sec. 199, p. 186; sec. 460, p. 372; Israel Hezekiah Trevis, Razin Genizin (Jerusalem, 1991), pp. 181, 250; and Moses David Valle, Shiv'im Panim, in Megillat Setarim (Warsaw, 1889), 2b (according to that passage, Moses effects the unity of the two messianic figures by uniting the left hand, which corresponds to the Messiah son of Joseph, and the right hand, which corresponds to the Messiah son of David); see Tishby, Studies in Kabbalah and Its Branches, p. 764. Luz- zatto's belief that he was the reincarnation of Moses betrays, no doubt, the idea expressed in earlier sources regarding the identification of Luria as the reincarnation of Moses, the first deliverer of Israel and hence the prototype of the messianic figure. Moreover, in the Lurianic texts, Simeon bar Yohai of the Zohar is identified as the reincarnation of Moses. Hence, a clear nexus is drawn between Moses, Simeon bar Yohai, and Luria. See Liebes, "'Two Young Roes of a Doe"' (n. 3 above), pp. 116, 123-24, 132, 145-47; and Rubin, "Zoharic Works of R. Moses Hayyim Luzzatto," pp. 390-95, 399-404.

The Nuqba' must be con- structed from 'Abba' and 'Imma' so that she would be worthy to come to Ze'eir 'Anpin, to unite with him. Her unification with him is the secret of unity (sod ha-yihud), for then the four letters of the tetragrammaton are bound together in one unit ... and this is the secret of the providence and the governance of all the worlds.23 In a letter that Luzzatto wrote (in Padua on the first and second of the intermediate days of Passover, 1732), to his teacher, Isaiah Bassan, he elaborated on the same motif, emphasizing that the task of man is to provide satisfaction for the Creator, which entails "rectifying the holy Shekhinah and building her as it has been transmitted to Israel, the 'people close to Him' (Ps. 148:14)."24 Luzzatto goes on to distinguish two kinds of love that the Jewish male has in relation to God, the "love of the Holy One, blessed be He" and the "love of the Shekhinah." The former is described as the love found in all the pious ones of Israel who guard the divine by scrupulously observing the commandments, whereas the latter is characterized as the "desire and passion to rectify the Shek- hinah," a rectification that is portrayed as an act of constructing the dif- ferent entities that constitute the various gradations of the Shekhinah. The two acts of worship, moreover, have their source in the feminine elements of the divine, Leah (or Binah) and Rachel (or Malkhut). With [n. 8 above], pp. 383-92), is a cornerstone of Luzzatto's messianic kabbalah, related par- ticularly to the ontological root of the Zohar itself. Luzzatto's words to Benjamin Cohen on this score are most revealing. See Ginzburg, Rabbi Moses Hayyim Luzzatto and His Generation, p. 37, no. 15: "The Zohar is precisely the aspect of the drop that comes forth from Yesod, and thus it is called the 'splendor of the firmament' (Dan. 12:3)." See Rubin, "Zoharic Works of R. Moses Hayyim Luzzatto" (n. 9 above), pp. 396-97, 400. 21 Luzzatto, 'Adir ba-Marom, p. 39. 22 The "land" to whom the king is enslaved according to Eccles. 5:8 is symbolically equivalent to the woman fashioned from the rib of Adam according to Gen. 2:22. That is, both refer to the feminine potency of the Shekhinah in the divine realm. See the commen- tary on Ecclesiastes written by Moses David Valle, Be'ur Sefer Qohelet (Jerusalem, 1988), pp. 62-63. 23 Luzzatto, 'Adir ba-Marom, p. 215.

Thus, the mascu- line can address the feminine as "bone of my bones" (Gen. 2:23); that is, male and female are constructed from one substance. By contrast, Rachel, the "childless woman of the house" (cf. Ps. 113:9), is described as the flesh (an allusion to the continuation of Gen. 2:23, "and flesh of my flesh"), which is sometimes fat and other times thin, sometimes in a state of repair (tiqqun) and other times in a state of damage (qilqul). Sum- ming up the discussion, Luzzatto writes: Those who serve with the general worship are rooted in Leah, the secret of the bone, while those who serve by way of the rectification of the Shekhinah are rooted in the flesh, which is Rachel.... This is the sum total of a man's exis- tence, that his worship be in the love of the Shekhinah, which is added to the love of the Holy One, blessed be He. Hence, the words of the Ari, may his memory be for a blessing, are correct when he said that the essence of a man's occupation should be the inwardness of Torah, for this alone illuminates the Shekhinah, as it says in the Zohar and in the Tiqqunim that only with respect to the secrets of Torah is it proclaimed, "I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant" (Gen. 9:16).25 Tiqqun ha-shekhinah is achieved most perfectly through the study of the secrets of Torah, which results in the remembering of the covenant. As I shall argue in the final section of this essay, the act of remembering the covenant entails the phallicization of the feminine, which marks the climactic phase of redemption. Reflecting previous kabbalistic sources, especially the zoharic and Lurianic texts, Luzzatto repeatedly emphasized the fact that exile is a condition of restriction and limitation that results in the separation of male and female. Exile, therefore, is the constriction of the masculine potency of beneficence and the domination of the feminine force of judg- ment. This separation is not absolute, however, for if it were the world could not endure. In a composition that deals extensively with themes related to the redemption, Ma'amar ha-Ge'ullah, composed sometime in 1729,26 Luzzatto expresses the matter as follows: "The great pipe [i.e., Yesod] that overflows to the Shekhinah is at first hidden. It is not hidden 25 Ibid. 26 In a letter to Isaiah Bassan, written on the eighteenth of Kislev 1729, Luzzatto men- tions Ma'amar ha-Ge'ullah as one of several texts that he has already written. See Ginz- burg, Rabbi Moses Hayyim Luzzatto and His Generation, p. 31, no. 14; Benayahu, Kabbalistic Writings of R. Moshe Hayyim Luzzatto (n. 9 above), pp. 48 and 227. 297</page><page sequence="10">Tiqqun ha-Shekhinah entirely ... but the opening is compressed, and that which descends from it descends in a great concealment."27 The reception of a diminished flow of energy on the part of the feminine Shekhinah from the phallic Yesod marks the first of four damages caused by the exile.28 The enfeebled con- dition of the Shekhinah is portrayed by Luzzatto (on the basis of earlier sources) by several other mythical images. Thus, for example, in the state of exile, the Shekhinah is stripped of the glorious and splendid garment that Binah, the divine mother, bestowed upon Tif'eret and Shekhinah, the son and the daughter, and in its place she is adorned with the dark and lowly clothes of the weekday (bigde hol).29 In the exile the garments were garments of darkness and gloom in the secret of the shell that surrounds the core ... but in the time of the redemption the gar- ments will be "garments of salvation" (bigde yesha') (Isa. 61:10), and the [at- tribute of] strength is called in this way as is Binah since she is to the left, and in truth these garments come out from her. Regarding all of this [it is written] "He wrapped me in a robe of righteousness" (me'il sedaqah) (ibid.), this is the splendid and glorious robe that is given to her from the king, and since it is given in the time of union it is called the "robe of righteousness," for righteous- ness signifies the supernal union.30 According to another image employed by Luzzatto, in the exile the Shekhinah is sullied by the blemish of the "flooding of the feet" (shittuf ha-raglayim), a state of impurity linked to the verse, "Her feet go down to death" (Prov. 5:5). The rectification of this condition, which I surmise 27 Luzzatto, Ma'amar ha-Ge'ullah, p. 6. 28 Ibid., pp. 4-10. 29 Ibid., p. 16. In Qinat ha-Shem Seva'ot (n. 8 above), p. 93, Luzzatto similarly de- scribes the Shekhinah divesting herself of the "weekday garments" (malbushe ha-hol) when the time of redemption arrives. In that context, Luzzatto elaborates on the motif of the Shekhinah being garbed in the demonic shells during the exile on account of the sins of Israel (pp. 91-92; cf. pp. 129-30). Alternatively, this idea is expressed as the Shekhi- nah descending to the realm of the shells in order to perfect the feminine potency of the demonic. This is related to the mystery of the intentional transgression ('averah lishmah), whose purpose it is to elevate the Shekhinah from her entrapment in the shells. Interest- ingly enough, Luzzatto speaks of the disclosure of the masculine Ze'eir 'Anpin imme- diately after the sin is committed, which results in the reinstitution of traditional rituals. The messianic discarding of the law is thus only a temporary action. Moreover, Luzzatto emphasizes that the antinomian act, which is characterized more specifically as the break- ing of sexual taboos ('arayot), applies only to women (pp. 97-98). On the positive valori- zation of halakhah as the means of walking (halikhah) by which the Shekhinah in exile rules over the nations of the world, cf. Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 507, p. 410. In Shiv'im Panim (n. 18 above), 18a, Valle describes the change of the garment of Yesod, which marks the transition from the exilic to the redemptive state. On the donning of the Shekhinah in garments of the attribute of judgment in order to subjugate the demonic power, cf. Valle, Shiv'im Panim, 18b-19a. 30 Luzzatto, Ma'amar ha-Ge'ullah (n. 18 above), p. 90. 298</page><page sequence="11">History of Religions involves a sin of a sexual nature,31 will come about through the arrival of the two messianic figures, the Messiah son of Joseph and the Messiah son of David, who are identified as the feet of the Shekhinah.32 Another symbolic depiction of exile involves the image of the Shekhinah laying in the dust, which represents the realm of demonic shells, and thus the holy union is not consummated. The beginning of redemption, which Luzzatto designates by the term peqidah in contrast to the second stage referred to as zekhirah,33 is signaled by the rising of the Shekhinah from 31 I suggest that shittuf ha-raglayim refers more specifically to the spilling of semen in vain through masturbation or involuntary nocturnal emissions. It is possible, however, that this term refers more generally to sexual licentiousness. In any event, it seems clear to me that the reference is to illicit sexual behavior on the part of Jewish males. The nexus of sexual impurity, exile, and the separation of the male and the female aspects of the divine is underscored in Luzzatto's decoding of the expression 'erwah in TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 27, p. 16: The word ra', the evil that is related to illicit sexuality, separates the waw and the he', the masculine and feminine aspects of the divine. Compare ibid., sec. 53, p. 30, and sec. 192, p. 177. Already in the Lurianic material, the principal function attributed to the messianic figure was to rectify the sin of spilling semen in vain, which was understood as the primordial sin of the supernal Adam above and of the first Adam below. See Meroz, "Redemption in the Lurianic Teaching" (n. 3 above), pp. 328-35; and Liebes, "'Two Young Roes of a Doe"' (n. 3 above), p. 141. Let me note, finally, that in the poem attrib- uted to Luzzatto, which begins "qawweh qawweh libbi qawweh 'ohilah," the expression shetef mayim, "flood of water," is one of several images used to describe the exile. The text is published in Tishby, Studies in Kabbalah and Its Branches (n. 8 above), p. 704. In Luzzatto, 'Adir ba-Marom (n. 8 above), p. 16, the floodwaters in the biblical story of Noah are interpreted as symbolic of the demonic other side. Compare Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 109, p. 74. 32 Luzzatto, Ma'amar ha-Ge'ullah, pp. 16-17. From that context it would appear that the two messianic figures correspond to Nesah and Hod, which are called the "feet of the Shekhinah." Compare Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 513, p. 416. For a slightly different explanation of the messianic symbolism of the feet, compare ibid., sec. 292, p. 256; sec. 456, p. 370; and Trevis, Razin Genizin (n. 18 above), p. 187. Regarding Luzzatto's iden- tification of the messianic figures as the divine feet, see E. R. Wolfson, "Images of God's Feet: Some Observations on the Divine Body in Judaism," in People of the Body: Jews and Judaism from an Embodied Perspective, ed. H. Eilberg-Schwartz (Albany, N.Y., 1992), p. 172. On the symbolic correspondence of the two messianic figures, see Luzzatto's letter (written in Padua on the eighteenth of Shevat 1730) to Bassan in Ginzburg, Rabbi Moses Hayyim Luzzatto and His Generation, pp. 66-67, no. 30: "Indeed, the secret of the messi- ahs is dependent on Malkhut... the Messiah son of Joseph is in the secret of Yesod and the aspect of Malkhut is in the secret of Rachel.... Thus, with respect to David it is writ- ten, 'May the Lord make the woman who is coming [into your house] like Rachel and Leah' (Ruth 4:11). The truth is that this is the secret of 'Who will go first? The son of Jesse is first' (Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 102a), for he is the secret of Leah who comprises Rachel as well. This is related to the fact that he takes the aspect of Malkhut, and the Mes- siah son of David is in the aspect of Yesod. Therefore the rectification of Malkhut is in David." The identification of Yesod as the ontological root of the messianic figures occurs frequently in Luzzatto's writings or those that were written by members of his circle. Com- pare Luzzatto, introduction to Shiv'im Tiqqunim (n. 18 above), p. 9; Trevis, Razin Genizin, pp. 180, 182. 33 On the possible Sabbatian background to Luzzatto's notion of two stages of redemp- tion, see Tishby, Studies in Kabbalah and Its Branches, pp. 780-808; and Liebes, On Sab- bateanism and Its Kabbalah (n. 9 above), p. 319, n. 119. According to both Tishby and 299</page><page sequence="12">Tiqqun ha-Shekhinah her downtrodden state, followed by the unification with her lover, a se- cret alluded to in the verse, "I rose to let in my beloved" (Song of Songs 5:5).34 The initial stage of redemption involves the reunion of the male and the female achieved by the opening of the phallic channel that was blocked in the exile: "When the power that emanates from the perfect root will reach the Saddiq, who is called in the Torah mal'akh ha-go'el,35 then this light will descend and will be revealed to the Shekhinah who is his partner, and he will give her power that he has not given her from the day of the exile of Israel until that day.... When this Saddiq will ar- rive and will be united with the Shekhinah, that which was initially con- cealed on account of the exile will be opened ... and there will be no more hiding of the face as in the beginning."36 The two phases of redemption correspond to different degrees of unifi- cation in the sefirotic realm.37 According to one formulation of this idea, peqidah is described as a time when the attribute of Hokhmah illuminates Malkhut from behind, whereas zekhirah is portrayed as a moment in Liebes, underlying Luzzatto's distinction of a two-staged redemption is the identification of peqidah as the Messiah son of Joseph, associated with the level of Yesod or Sabbatai Sevi (Tishby, Studies in Kabbalah and Its Branches, pp. 764-69, 797-807; and Liebes, On Sabbateanism and Its Kabbalah, p. 66), and zekhirah as the Messiah son of David, associated with Tif'eret. Liebes mentions that this distinction is found as well in the 'Or ha-Shem of Hasdai Crescas. One must also bear in mind, however, that in the Zohar it- self the words peqidah and zekhirah connote two aspects of memory, which are related to stages of the redemptive process. Cf. Zohar l:115a, 119a, 159b-160a; 2:222a (in that context Moses is depicted as bringing the Shekhinah out of exile by the act of remember- ing her; the word peqidah clearly is a euphemism for intercourse, albeit of a spiritual na- ture; on the euphemistic use of the root pqd, cf. Judges 15:1; Babylonian Talmud Yevamot 62b); and discussion in Wolfson, "Re/membering the Covenant" (n. 7 above). It is also possible that Luzzatto was influenced in this regard by non-Sabbatian kabbalistic sources such as Cordovero or Luria. Regarding the dual messianic figure in the former, see Sack, Kabbalah of Rabbi Moshe Cordovero (n. 5 above), pp. 291-98, and in the lat- ter, see Liebes, "'Two Young Roes of a Doe,'" pp. 130-64. 34 Luzzatto, Ma'amar ha-Ge'ullah, p. 19. Compare the words of the Maggid to Luzzatto from Rosh Hodesh Sivan, 1727, recorded in Moses Hayyim Luzzatto, 'Oserot Ramhal, ed. H. Friedlander (Bene Beraq, 1986), p. 256. 35 Gen. 49:16. Compare Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 434, pp. 354-55. In that context, Luzzatto describes the mal'akh ha-go'el, the phallic force of Yesod, that opens the closed door (delet sagur), which is the aspect of Malkhut during the exile. The opening of the door occurs through the disclosure of the secrets of the Torah. Compare Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 340, p. 286. 36 Luzzatto, Ma'amar ha-Ge'ullah, p. 12. On the hiding of the divine face and the exilic condition of the Jewish people, cf. Moses Hayyim Luzzatto, Da'at Tevunot, ed. H. Fried- lander (Bene Beraq, 1989), sec. 40, pp. 30-31. 37 In Trevis, Razin Genizin, pp. 236-37, the unification associated with peqidah is de- scribed as the beginning of the rectification, the first intercourse from the left side related to the Messiah son of Joseph, whereas the unification associated with zekhirah is the com- pletion and perfection of the rectification, the second intercourse from the right side re- lated to the Messiah son of David. On the correlation of the two messianic figures with the right and the left side of the divine, see the comment of Valle mentioned above in n. 18. 300</page><page sequence="13">History of Religions which Hokhmah and Binah together illumine the face of the Shekhinah.38 Alternatively expressed, peqidah derives from Yesod and zekhirah from Tif'eret.39 Thus, from an historical perspective, peqidah precedes zek- hirah, but from an ontological perspective, zekhirah precedes peqidah.40 Indeed, even in the first phase of redemption Tif'eret is the motivating force that activates Yesod to unite with the Shekhinah.41 Luzzatto alludes to this dynamic in his description of zekhirah as the illumination of the upper and lower mazzal, represented respectively by the names YHWH (written as YO"D H"Y WY"W H"Y, which equals 72) and Ehyeh (writ- ten as AL"F H"Y YW"D H"Y, which equals 161). The numerical sum of the permutations of the two names is 233, which is also the value of the word zakhor, "remember."42 The secret of the redemption is thus related to the verse, "God remembered His covenant" (Exod. 2:24); that is, re- demption is dependent on memory, which is linked especially to the dis- closure of the phallic covenant.43 When Yesod overflows without obstruction onto the Shekhinah, the act of zekhirah comes to fruition and the redemption is complete. Thus, in one of his 515 messianic prayers, the TQT"W Tefillot,44 Luzzatto im- plores God to dispel the demonic darkness that separated the sixth and seventh of the lower emanations, that is, Yesod and Malkhut, and to re- store the rest and peace taken away from her by uniting the two grada- tions in the messianic Sabbath.45 In the state of exile, the eschatological opening of the channel of Yesod to irrigate the Shekhinah is facilitated by the expositions of the secrets of Torah on the part of the kabbal- ists, whose mystical enlightenment derives precisely from that gradation 38 Luzzatto, Ma'amar ha-Ge'ullah, p. 15. 39 Ibid., p. 12. 40 Ibid., p. 11. 41 Ibid., pp. 21 and 24. Elsewhere, Luzzatto affirms the view expressed in the Lurianic material, which in turn is based on earlier sources, regarding the role of the feminine as that which stimulates the male in sexual union. For example, see Moses Hayyim Luzzatto, Pithe Hokhmah wa-Da'at, in Sha'are Ramhal (n. 8 above), p. 195. As I will argue below, however, this function has the effect of transforming the gender of the feminine. That is, the elevation of the feminine to stimulate the masculine results in the actualization of the phallic potency within the female. On the elevation of Malkhut to Da'at, cf. Luzzatto, Pithe Hokhmah wa-Da'at, p. 207, and Kelale Hokhmat ha-'Emet, in Sha'are Ramhal, sec. 32, pp. 317-18. The transformation of Malkhut from the point beneath Yesod to an aspect that is rooted in Da'at is indicative of the condition of the aggrandized feminine in the messianic state. 42 Luzzatto, Ma'amar ha-Ge'ullah (n. 18 above), p. 11. 43 A similar point is emphasized in a fragment on the nature of the redemption by one of the members of Luzzatto's circle, Israel Hezekiah Trevis, published by Benayahu, Kab- balistic Writings of R. Moshe Hayyim Luzzatto (n. 9 above), p. 277. Compare Luzzatto, Shiv'im Tiqqunim (n. 18 above), sec. 30, pp. 71-72. 44 The TQT"W Tefillot was composed in 1731. See Benayahu, Kabbalistic Writings of R.

On the contrary, the final tiqqun ha-shekhinah was occasioned by Luzzatto's consummating his marriage by engaging in physical sex.50 Luzzatto alludes to this secret in his interpretation of the words, "here in Padua," included in the marriage certificate (written on the twenty-seventh of the month of Av, 1731) in which he portrays his marriage to Zipporah, the daughter of David Finzi, as the wedding of the biblical Moses (symbolic of Tif'eret) to the Shekhinah: the word poh, "here," can be vocalized as peh, "mouth." On the day of the wed- ding, therefore, Padua is described as the "place in which the mouth was opened," which I decode as a reference to the opening of the phallic 46 See n. 20 above, and cf. Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 42, pp. 23-24; Trevis, Razin Genizin (n. 18 above), pp. 240-41. 47 On the nexus of asceticism and eroticism in the zoharic kabbalah, which served as the basis for subsequent kabbalistic sources, see E. R. Wolfson, "Eunuchs Who Keep the Sabbath: Becoming Male and the Ascetic Ideal in Thirteenth-Century Jewish Mysticism," in Becoming Male in the Middle Ages, ed. J. Cohen and B. Wheeler (New York, 1997), pp. 151-85. The erotic nature of man's attachment to God is also evident in Moses Hayyim Luzzatto's description of the pietistic ideal of devequt, "conjunction," in his Mesillat Yesharim, ed. A. Shoshana (Jerusalem, 1994), pp. 288-91. 48 Zohar 1:21b-22a, 152b, 236b, 239a; 2:5b, 222a, 245a; 3:4b, 148a, 180a, 261b; Scholem, Major Trends (n. 8 above), pp. 226-27; I.

Compare Luzzatto, Qin'at ha-Shem Seva'ot (n. 8 above), p. 126. 49 On the ascetic dimension of Luzzatto's life and the specific connection to his involve- ment with the mystical fraternity, cf. the comment of Rafael Israel Kimhi in his letter to the rabbis of Venice (dated 3 Kislev 1730), in Ginzburg, Rabbi Moses .Hayyim Luzzatto and His Generation (n. 12 above), p. 21, no. 8. In this connection it is of interest to note that, in one of his letters to Benjamin Cohen, Luzzatto remarks that ascetic practices prepared Luria for his role in the redemptive process. See ibid., p. 38 (no. 15). In TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 446, pp. 362-63, Luzzatto links ascetic practices to the exile when the Shek- hinah is subject to the impurity of the demonic shells. An extended discussion of asceti- cism (perishut) and its connection to piety (hasidut) appears in Luzzatto's Mesillat Ye- sharim, pp. 135-43. 50 See Tishby, Studies in Kabbalah and Its Branches (n. 9 above), pp. 730 and 748, n. 18. See, however, n. 173 below. 302</page><page sequence="15">History of Religions Yesod.51 Consequently, the Shekhinah became kallat moshe,52 the "bride of Moses," for by means of his unification with Zipporah below, Luz- zatto assisted in the unification of the Shekhinah and Moses above: "He said to the virgin whom no man had known,53 the bride of Moses, 'Be my wife in a perfect union to arouse the coupling above until there is no end and there is no limit.'... From the mouth of our sages, may their memory be for a blessing, we certainly learn how to serve (la'avod) the Shekhinah through various laws and decrees.... And thus all of the worship ('avodah) of the lower beings causes the king to perform an- other service ('avodah) above, 'a king is enslaved to the land' (Eccles. 5:8), for everything is from the arousal below."54 The sexual consumma- tion of the marriage of Luzzatto and his wife thus served as the stimulus to arouse the union above between the male and female attributes of God, a union that is portrayed in explicitly messianic language. ESCHATOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATION OF EVIL INTO GOOD In addition to the ideal of the unification of male and female, the messi- anic task of tiqqun ha-shekhinah can be viewed as the restoration of the demonic to the divine.55 These two vantage points are, of course, interrelated, for the union of the male and the female cannot be actual- ized until the demonic is reintegrated into the divine. Thus, toward the very end of his marriage contract, Luzzatto comments on the words, "everything is firm and abiding" (we-hakol sharir we-qayyam): "Now Yesod becomes erect in order to copulate for he rules (shorer) and dom- inates over all the shells. 'And abiding,' this rectification will endure 51 Ibid., p. 740. Tishby (ibid., p. 753, n. 126) interprets this as a reference to the mouth of the angelic Maggid, but it seems to me that my interpretation better suits the context. On the significance of the mouth in the final messianic tiqqun, cf. Moses Hayyim Luzzatto, Be'ur Zayin Melakhim, in 'Adir ba-Marom (n. 8 above), pt. 2 (Jerusalem, 1988), pp. 128- 30.

"Israel stand in the midst of darkness from the aspect of Samael and his female... concerning whom [it is written] 'He has made me dwell in darkness, like those long dead' (Lam. 3:6), on account of the 'alef, which is the light ('or), that disappears ... and from [the word] 'emet [truth] there remains met [deceased]."57 Luzzatto characterizes the control of judgment over mercy and the consequent weakening of the divine emanation by the biblical notion (Deut. 27:17) of overstepping one's boundary (hassagat gevul). That is, as a consequence of Israel's sinfulness, the power of the divine light is diminished and the shell arrogantly and impudently seeks to cleave to the place of holiness to which it does not belong.58 Sin not only creates a blemish above by separating the male and the female in the divine realm, it allows for the demonic side to draw from and be sustained by the overflow of the holy gradations as it is channeled through the Shekhinah.59 By contrast, in the time of the "great rectifica- tion" (tiqqun gadol), there will be an expansion of the boundary (har- havat gevul), which signifies the overpowering of judgment by mercy.60 "The boundary derives from the power of strength, but when peace is greatly strengthened, mercy overpowers strength, and then all the lights draw close to one another in a great affinity, for the power of closeness and unity grows strong in the lights.... Every power draws close to its neighbor and there is no great need for boundary.... The power of peace that is strengthened unifies everything in a complete unity."61 The state of unity that is described here in terms of the augmentation of the phallic aspect of God, designated by the technical term "peace,"62 is 56 Tishby, Studies in Kabbalah and Its Branches, p. 744. Compare Valle, Shiv'im Panim, 19b. 57 Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 22, p. 13. On the essential connection of darkness (un- derstood as the concealment of divine light) and the demonic force, a theme reiterated in many of Luzzatto's texts, see Qin'at ha-Shem Seva'ot (n. 8 above), p. 121. 58 Luzzatto, Ma'amar ha-Ge'ullah (n. 18 above), p. 88. In Qin'at ha-Shem Seva'ot, p. 114, Luzzatto asserts that the characteristic of going beyond an allocated boundary is bestowed upon the demonic from the diminution of the moon. 59 Compare Luzzatto, Qin'at ha-Shem Seva'ot, pp. 128-30. The attachment of the de- monic to the Shekhinah is the esoteric significance of the symbol of the Tree of Knowl- edge of Good and Evil, which is applied to the Shekhinah. 60 Luzzatto, Ma'amar ha-Ge'ullah, pp. 82-83.

The latter receives the name shalom when it is united with the former, an idea exegetically linked to the repetition of the word shalom in Isa. 57:19. On p. 79, the Shek- hinah is identified as the "time of peace," 'et shalom, which stands in opposition to the "time of strife," 'et milhamah (Eccles. 3:8), and on p. 81, the Shekhinah is given the title 304</page><page sequence="17">History of Religions predicated on the overcoming of the duality of good and evil, light and darkness. In the state of exile, the demonic shell causes the separation of the male and the female and thereby prevents the rectification of ex- istence on all levels of being. By contrast, in the messianic state of tiqqun, evil will be annihilated and the good that is within the evil, the spark of light trapped in the shell, will be restored to the realm of holi- ness.63 The full disclosure of divine unity is predicated on the subjuga- tion and ultimate transmutation of the impure into the holy. In TQT"W Tefillot, Luzzatto expresses the perfection of unity (shelemut ha-yihud) as follows: "You placed all the impure gradations beneath the feet of your holy Shekhinah, as it says concerning her, 'His kingship (malkhuto) rules over all' (Ps. 103:19). When you concealed your unity, the impure ones ascended and descended upon her in their impudence.... As soon as your unity will be revealed upon her, all of them will be subjugated and enslaved beneath her. Immediately, 'laying the world at his feet' (ibid. 8:7)."64 The removal of deception (sheqer) from the world is de- pendent on the bond (qesher) of holiness through which Israel is con- joined to the divine from above and below.65 Time and again, Luzzatto affirms the complete obliteration of the de- monic force in the messianic age, an idea linked especially to two bibli- cal verses, "I will give the land respite from vicious beasts" (Lev. 26:6) and "He will destroy death forever" (Isa. 25:8).66 The original function of the demonic shells was to test human beings so that they would merit a just reward by overcoming temptation. The desire of the shell was to be conjoined to holiness, but a boundary was set between the two to pre- vent a mixing of the forces.67 In the time of redemption, however, the shell will no longer stand opposite the side of holiness, for it will be destroyed. In Luzzatto's own words: "sword of peace," herev shel shalom (cf. Tosefta, Ta'anit 2:10; Palestinian Talmud, Ta'anit 3:6, 66d; Babylonian Talmud, Ta'anit 22a), for it is the attribute of judgment (symbolized as the sword) that derives from the attribute of peace or Yesod. Conse- quently, the Shekhinah can combat the force of demonic impurity, which is at odds par- ticularly with the phallic gradation of the divine. On the explicit identification of the saddiq, which corresponds to the divine phallus, as shalom, cf.

At present there is "another god" ('elohim 'aherim) in the world, for even though in truth nothing can be done that the king did not command, they act in their strength and in their pride as if there were, God forbid, another source distinct from the true one. In truth, holiness separates and distances itself from impur- ity, and thus they are called "other gods." When the creation in its entirety is rectified, the evil that is in the shell will be annihilated and the good will be drawn after the holiness as is appropriate.68 Returning to this theme in another passage, Luzzatto remarks that "in that time the shell is already annihilated, for the good is removed from the impurity and it is drawn after the holiness, and the evil is pushed below. The remainder [of the impurity] attaches itself to the idolaters who have already died and who are in Gehenna.... In the end of days there will be a day of great judgment to complete the purification of all the souls and all of creation. ... As a result of that judgment all of crea- tion will be completely pure and all of the evil will be destroyed and consumed."69 In spite of these passages, which suggest a more dualistic approach based on the notion of the absolute separation of the forces of holiness and impurity and the need to obliterate the latter in its entirety in the mes- sianic future, Luzzatto rejects the positing of absolutely distinct forces in existence, for in his opinion, following a longstanding kabbalistic tradi- tion, the demonic power ontically derives from and thus ultimately must be restored to the Godhead.70 Thus, for example, in his main systematic treatise on the theoretical principles of theosophic kabbalah, Qelah Pithe Hokhmah, written in 1732,71 Luzzatto presents the metaphysical reason- ing underlying the eschatological goal of the transmutation of evil into good: "The will of the Emanator, blessed be his name, is only good, and thus nothing exists but his goodness. All that is evil in the beginning does not derive from another authority, God forbid, that could exist in opposition to him, but its end is certainly good. Then it will be known that there is no authority but him."72 "If evil were to rule entirely without any other authority over it, evil would be called an authority unto itself. But since we know that the existence of Ein-Sof is necessary, there is no 68 Luzzatto, Ma'amar ha-Ge'ullah, p. 28. 69 Ibid., pp. 68-69. 70 See E. R.

Thus when you consider any evil in the world, it is impossible not to comprehend that there is an existence that is good, which is the necessary of existence."73 Similarly, we read in the 'Iggerot Pithe .Hokhmah wa-Da'at: "When we ascend more to the root of things, we comprehend how the essence of all is the unity of the Ein Sof, blessed be he.... And the essence of the unity is that even evil itself is evil only in its beginning, for in the end everything will be trans- formed into good."74 The same theme is expressed in Da'at Tevunot: "The principle is: [God] hides his face and gives a place for evil to exist until he returns and reveals his goodness, and evil will no longer exist, and the unity of his dominion will be seen."75 The manifestation of di- vine unity in the world is predicated on the ontic transmutation of evil into good.76 What Luzzatto intends by the rhetorical flourishes describing the an- nihilation of the shells, therefore, is the ontological reintegration of the demonic into the divine, since he categorically rejects an absolute meta- physical dualism.77 Thus, Luzzatto contrasts the role of the shell in the current condition of the world and in the messianic future: At present the shell is impure and its function is to protect the core, but in the fu- ture the shell itself will partake of holiness and it will be restored to the attribute of divine judgment, providing the limit and boundary necessary for the creative balance that sustains the world. "This is [the intent of] 'Your teacher will no longer be covered' (Isa. 30:20), for when the shell was impure it darkened the light. . but when the shell is the secret of [the attribute of] strength, then it too illumines and does not darken, and its task is only to give boundary, even though a great expansion will be 73 Ibid., sec. 30, pp. 96-97. 74 Moses Hayyim Luzzatto, 'Iggerot Pithe Hokhmah wa-Da'at, sec. 19, in Sha'are Ram- hal (n. 8 above), p. 376.

There is thus a re- trieval of the pure body that was soiled on account of the sin of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Compare Moses Hayyim Luzzatto, Kelalim Ri'shonim, in his Sefer ha- Kelalim, ed. H.

In Luzzatto, Mesillat Yesharim (n. 47 above), pp. 320-22, the spiritualization of the physical is the level of holiness (qedushah) attributed to one who cleaves constantly to God. Regarding such a person it can be said that "it is as if he were joined to the supernal angels" (p. 321). 307</page><page sequence="20">Tiqqun ha-Shekhinah found."78 In a passage from Qelah Pithe Hokhmah, Luzzatto asserts that in the final tiqqun, all nations, and not just Israel, will be rectified, and in this state death, impurity, and the evil inclination will all be com- pletely eradicated.79 Even the subjugation of the demonic to the holy, which has been attained in previous historical moments such as the Sinaitic theophany, is a lower level of achievement, for the ultimate re- demption is the act of perfection (pe'ulat ha-shelemut), which entails the transformation of evil itself into good and the restoration of all things to their supernal source, the "unity that acts according to itself" (ha-yihud ha-po'el lefi 'asmo).80 Thus, Luzzatto explains that the verse "He will destroy death forever," signifies that "the evil is absorbed in its root.... And in the perfect rectification (tiqqun ha-shalem) the exis- tence of evil per se is abolished."81 In a most daring passage in Hoqer u-Mequbbal,82 Luzzatto writes: Had the holiness not been there [in the demonic shell] it could not have existed even for a moment, as the verse says, "You keep them all alive" (Neh. 9:6), even the pig and the insect. Why is [the pig] called hazir? Because in the future it shall revert (lahazor) [to holiness] and it shall be permissible for the aspect of the shell and the desire, and even the archon of Esau, who is the angel of death and the evil inclination, shall be abolished, and death shall be destroyed forever, and the holiness shall be purified from the shell, "in that day there shall be one Lord [with one name]" (Zech. 14:9).83 78 Luzzatto, Ma'amar ha-Ge'ullah, pp. 62-63. In his mystical ketubah, Luzzatto speaks of the subjugation of the demonic shell in the messianic future in terms of the image of the servant who is enslaved to his master. See Tishby, Studies in Kabbala and Its Branches (n. 9 above), p. 743. 79 The proof texts that Luzzatto cites to signify the eschatological eradication of death, impurity, and the evil inclination are, respectively, Isa. 25:8, Zech. 13:2, and Ezek. 36:26. On other occasions, Luzzatto, following earlier kabbalistic sources, associates Israel with the right side of holiness and the nations with the left side of impurity. The messianic hope is thus framed in terms of the obliteration of the nations or their subordination to Israel.

The transforma- tion of the pig from an unholy to a pure animal is alluded to in Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 176, p. 153. The connection between the word hazir, "pig," and the verb lehahazir, "to restore," is found in Ecclesiastes Rabbah 1:9 (Jerusalem, 1975), p. 8; Leviticus Rabbah 13:5, ed. M. Margulies (New York, 1993), p. 295, and see n. 2, for reference to other rele- vant sources. The closest parallel to Luzzatto's explanation of the word hazir that I have found is in Abraham Galante's Qol Bokhim on Lam. 4:21, cited in Isaiah Horowitz, Shene Luhot ha-Berit (Frankfurt, 1717), 20b: "This is the secret of why [the pig] is called hazir, for in the future it will be restored (she'atid lehahazir)." In the same context (20a), Horowitz himself cites the rabbis as the source for the statement that "in the future the pig will be 308</page><page sequence="21">History of Religions Perhaps the most sublime expression of the idea of the subjugation of evil to good in the messianic era is Luzzatto's conception of the trans- formation of the serpent into the rod,84 which symbolizes the reintegra- tion of the demonic force into the attribute of judgment associated with the Shekhinah. In the state of exile, impurity has dominion over holi- ness and the rod is transformed into the serpent. Related to this complex of symbols is the idea of the Messiah himself being garbed in the de- monic shells, particularly those of Esau and Ishmael, which represent Christianity and Islam, in order to accomplish the tiqqun by purifying the sparks of light from the realm of darkness.85 Luzzatto anchors the esoteric notion of the descent of the messianic redeemer to the demonic realm-an idea that he relates to the aggadic motif of the Messiah sit- ting at the gates of Rome (Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 98a)-in the numerological equivalence of the Hebrew terms nahash (serpent) and mashiah (savior).86 In particular, the Messiah son of Joseph, who is from the left side of judgment, is given the task of rectification of the external (tiqqun ha-hisoniyyut) and thus must stand in the secret of the serpent, whereas the Messiah son of David, who is from the right side of mercy, is assigned the task of rectification of the internal (tiqqun ha-penimiyyut).87 In the messianic redemption, the demonic force is pure." For a recent English rendering of these passages, see Isaiah Horowitz, The Gener- ations of Adam, trans. M. Krassen (New York, 1996), pp. 218-20. 84 The image is derived from Exod. 7:10-12. 85 Luzzatto, Qin'at ha-Shem Seva'ot (n. 8 above), p. 132; and Trevis, Razin Genizin (n. 18 above), pp. 187, 189. The task of the Messiah to descend to the demonic shells in order to redeem the sparks is in emulation of the Shekhinah, who is also described as descending to the shells in order to purify the souls of Israel who have fallen there. Insofar as the souls are themselves the female waters of the Shekhinah, the liberation of the souls from the shells is ultimately a form of self-emancipation. Compare Luzzatto, Qin'at ha-Shem Seva'ot (n. 8 above), pp. 129-30 (see n. 28 above), and Hoqer u-Mequbbal, 22a-23a. In his mys- tical ketubah, Luzzatto describes the redemption (based on Deut. 21:11) as a war against the demonic shells with the stated aim of bringing out the Shekhinah who has descended into that realm in the course of the exile. See Tishby, Studies in Kabbalah and Its Branches, p. 740. The descent of the saddiq to the demonic realm for the purpose of elevating the entrapped sparks is repeatedly emphasized by Valle, Shiv'im Panim (n. 18 above), 7a, 9a, 9b-10a, lOa-b, 12a, 12b, 13a-b, 14b-15a, 15b, 16a, 16b, 18a, 19b, 20a, 21a, 22a. 86 Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 58, p. 37. The possible Sabbatian influence on Luz- zatto's idea of the transformation of the Messiah into a serpent as part of the process of rectification has already been noted by Tishby, in Studies in Kabbalah and Its Branches, pp. 762-63. In 'Adir ba-Marom, pp. 338-39, Luzzatto mentions together with the numeri- cal equivalence of nahash and mashiah the identification of ha-satan and ha-mashiah, for ha-satan equals 364 and ha-mashiah equals 363, to which is added the extra one corre- sponding to the word itself in order to get the desired sum of 364. Luzzatto goes so far as to say that "in the secret of her exteriority she becomes Satan and in the secret of her inte- riority she becomes Messiah." Hence, the demonic and the divine are two aspects of one reality. Regarding the boldness of this numerology, see Tishby, Studies in Kabbalah and Its Branches, p. 775, n. 66. 87 Luzzatto, Qin'at ha-Shem Seva'ot, p. 100. The placing of Messiah son of Joseph in the realm of the demonic is related by Luzzatto to the ten sparks (i.e., drops of semen) that he emitted when he was tempted by the wife of Potiphar, which are related to the ten 309</page><page sequence="22">Tiqqun ha-Shekhinah subjugated by the attribute of judgment and the serpent is transformed back into the rod. This secret is alluded to in the verse, "Dan shall be a serpent by the road" (Gen. 49:17), for the name "Dan" is made up of the letters dalet and nun, which denote the attribute of judgment (din). These letters, moreover, are comprised within the name 'Adonai, which sig- nifies that the demonic is rooted in and comes out from the attribute of judgment. When the serpent is subdued under the rule of the Shekhinah, the locus of divine judgment, it is transformed back into the rod, an idea buttressed by the fact that the word for rod, matteh, is numerically equivalent to the word dan.88 The ontic transmutation of the demonic serpent into the divine is reiterated with a slightly different emphasis by Luzzatto in TQT"W Tefillot.89 From this context we learn that the rod is symbolic of Yesod.90 By means of this phallic rod or, more specifically, the rite of circumci- sion, the restoration of the serpent to the divine is actualized.91 The shat- tering of the three shells, which correspond to the three acts in the rite of circumcision-cutting the foreskin, splitting and pulling down the membrane, and dripping the blood92-results in the remembering of the covenant of Jacob, which comprises in itself the covenants of Abraham and Isaac (linked exegetically to Lev. 26:42), in a manner that is analo- gous to the containment of the attributes of love and judgment in the attribute of mercy. The transformation of the serpent into the rod thus signifies the sanctification of the phallus and the consequent removal of the demonic force. When that is achieved, the feminine Shekhinah itself rabbinic sages killed by the Romans ('asarah haruge malkhut). For elaboration of this theme, cf. ibid., pp. 102-3; Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 27, p. 16; sec. 399, p. 330. On the task of Messiah son of Joseph to be submerged in the demonic shells in order to subdue them, cf. Luzzatto, introduction to Shiv'im Tiqqunim (n. 18 above), p. 13. In Qin'at ha-Shem Seva'ot, pp. 125-26, Luzzatto explains the burial of Moses outside the land of Israel in terms of a similar motif, i.e., in the postmortem state Moses suffers for the sake of the tiqqun of Israel. 88 Luzzatto, Qin'at ha-Shem Seva'ot, pp. 98-99. Luzzatto also relates the idea of the subjugation of evil by good to the image of the serpent shedding its skin (p. 100). On the image of the transformation of the serpent into the rod, which is identified with the at- tribute of judgment by means of which the Messiah son of David controls the demonic power, cf. Trevis, Razin Genizin, pp. 185 and 232. 89 Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 1, pp. 1-2.

Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 464, pp. 375-76. 92 In TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 34, pp. 19-20, Luzzatto links the three cardinal transgressions of idolatry, illicit sexuality, and bloodshed with the three demonic shells, which are also as- sociated with three acts in the rite of circumcision, cutting the foreskin, splitting and pulling down the membrane, and dripping the blood. By removing these shells, the deceit (sheqer) of the demonic side gives way to the knot (qesher) of unity and the covenant is disclosed in the world (according to Gen. 9:16 and Lev. 26:42). Compare ibid., sec. 132, p. 94. 310</page><page sequence="23">History of Religions is transformed from the menstruant forbidden to her husband to a pure woman prepared to engage in conjugal intercourse. Against this background one can understand Luzzatto's assertion that the hope of redemption is tied especially to the letter waw, the "sign of truth," which overcomes the falsity of the demonic power.93 The mean- ing of this association is disclosed in another passage wherein Luzzatto explicitly identifies the "sign of truth" ('ot 'emet) as the "sign of the cov- enant" ('ot berit),94 an identification that confirms a point repeatedly as- serted by him: Redemption comes about primarily through the divine phallus for it serves as the antidote to counteract the poisonous effects of the demonic in the world. Hence, in another one of his messianic poems, Luzzatto addresses God in the following way: Your light shines from the source of all, and this is the yod that goes down vig- orously, concerning which it says, "God said, 'Let there be light,' and there was light" (Gen. 1:3), and these are the five lights.95 This light emanated in the five configurations,96 which are the totality of holiness, and through them all the blemishes are removed so that all will be established in Your unity. This is the he', and immediately everything is bound in one river, and this is the righteous one (saddiq) who stands on behalf of Israel, and concerning him [it says] "A river is- sues forth from Eden to water the garden" (ibid., 2:10), and this is the waw, and it spreads forth through Israel, which consists of the four divisions, the four camps of the Shekhinah, and when the righteous stands amongst them, the he' is completed through them,97 and this is the perfection of Your holy name.... As soon as the righteous one stands in Israel, all evil is removed from them.98 93 Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 8, p. 6; sec. 233, pp. 221-22. 94 Ibid., sec. 25, p. 15; sec. 403, p. 333; sec. 494, pp. 397-98. 95 That is, the word 'or, "light," is mentioned five times in the creation narrative in Gen. 1:3-5. 96 That is, the five parsufim of the Lurianic kabbalah, which are the five configurations of the divine light that take shape after the fracture in the primordial macroanthropos ('adam qadmon). 97 That is, the dalet, which represents the four divisions of Israel, the earthly embodi- ment of the four camps of the Shekhinah, and the waw, symbolic of the phallic Yesod, to- gether take the form of the he', the last letter of the tetragrammaton. The representation of the Shekhinah by the he' therefore signifies the phallic transformation of the feminine. Compare Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 482, p. 388: "Your holy Shekhinah is the 'bread of affliction' (Deut. 16:3), a morsel of unleavened bread [cf. Babylonian Talmud Pesahim 115b], for the Shekhinah is [represented by the letter] he', but she is a dalet in her own se- cret for she is poor (dallah) and impoverished ('aniyyah). [The letter] waw [joins the dalet] when the eternally living righteous one (saddiq hei 'olamim) is united with her, and imme- diately, [she is characterized as] 'a land where you may eat food without stint, where you will lack nothing' (Deut. 8:9)." The addition of the waw of Yesod to the dalet of the Shek- hinah results in the formation of the he', which symbolizes the state of the fullness of which it says that the earth lacks nothing, lo' tehsar kol bah, which can be read as the All, i.e., Yesod, is not lacking from her.

Sinfulness in its most elemental form is the vitiation of the phallus brought about by sexual improprieties.99 Moreover, insofar as the mysti- cal secrets are contextualized in the phallic aspect of the divine, and the kabbalist who can elicit these mysteries from Scripture is the earthly manifestation of that gradation, it follows that esoteric study affects the transformation of the demonic serpent into the rod. Concerning the messianic king it says, "I shall not die but live" (Ps. 118:17), and this is the mark of life,100 and this mark is the Shekhinah, for in another time it says, "Her feet go down to death" (Prov. 5:5), but through the secrets of Your To- rah it says regarding her, "I will see it and remember [the everlasting covenant]" (Gen. 9:16). Immediately [it says] "He drew his feet into the bed" (ibid. 49:33), this [word mittah, "bed," numerically equals] dan [i.e., the letters dalet and nun] of 'Adonai, for it is the rod (matteh) that was changed into a serpent (Exod. 7:15) and returned to being a rod, concerning which it says, "This is Solomon's bed" (Song of Songs 3:7) and immediately "He drew his feet into the bed!"10' By playing on the words matteh (rod) and mittah (bed), which are made up of the same Hebrew consonants, and assuming further the numerical equivalence of these words and the letters dalet and nun from the name 'Adonai, Luzzatto is able to string together different biblical verses to express the idea that the demonic force is transposed into the attribute of divine judgment. As a consequence of this transposition, the Shekhi- nah itself undergoes a change from being submerged in the realm of impurity (conveyed by Prov. 5:5) to becoming the vessel (related in the image of the bed) that receives the overflow from the masculine aspect of the divine (alluded to in Gen. 49:33102 and Song of Songs 3:7). In 99 Compare Luzzatto, Qin'at ha-Shem Seva'ot (n. 8 above), pp. 102-3, 106-9. 100 Literally, taw hayyim, based on Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 55a. 101 Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 468, p. 478.

It is likely that the word "feet" in these contexts denotes the feet of the Shekhinah to which are at- tached the deceitfulness of the demonic. Luzzatto's comment reflects the motif expressed in Midrash 'Otiyyot de-R. 'Aqiva' (in Batte Midrashot, ed. S. Wertheimer [Jerusalem, 1980], 2:397-98) to the effect that "deceit has no feet." For discussion of this text and its impact on Sefer ha-Bahir, see E. R. Wolfson, Along the Path: Studies in Kabbalistic Myth, Symbolism, and Hermeneutics (Albany, 1995), pp. 74-77.

On the attachment of the serpent to the foot of the Shekhinah, cf. ibid., sec. 171, p. 147. The motif of the serpent's attach- ment to the heels of holiness is related to the divine proclamation to the serpent in Gen. 3:15, on the one hand, and to the notion of the footsteps of the Messiah, on the other.

In the profoundly complex symbolism of theosophic kabbalah, heterosexual union results in the reconstitution of the androgynous phallus. ESCHATOLOGICAL ELEVATION AND AUGMENTATION OF THE SHEKHINAH The unity of all things, achieved by the union of male and female, is the most basic feature of the redemption: "'[And the Lord shall be king over all the earth;] in that day there shall be one Lord with one name' (Zech 14:9): Understand that all of the rectification (tiqqun) depends on the secret of unity such that everything is one bond without separation, for all the lights are bound and united one with the other."103 The period of redemption, therefore, is a "time of pleasure" in which "the king will stroll in his garden with great joy," and "from the abundance of the light of his countenance the garden will shine with a great light."104 The strol- ling of the king in the garden and the consequent illumination of the latter by the former are symbolic depictions of the hieros gamos that is consummated in the redemption.105 Indeed, the latter is characterized by Luzzatto as a time in which this union is not interrupted on account of the "great desire" and the "overpowering love" that the female has for the male. The intensification of heterosexual passion appropriate to the messianic era is thus described by Luzzatto: "This is what it says, 'the time of singing has come' (Song of Songs 2:12), for the Shekhinah sere- nades her husband. 'The song of the turtledove is heard in our land' (ibid.), for the king does not depart from the garden, but he strolls in it, and all of the righteous and all of Israel who have been redeemed from their exile take pleasure in him. This is the great joy that shall be for Israel perpetually from the time of the redemption and onward."106 The arousal of heterosexual eros marks the shift in the ontic status of the Shekhinah brought about by the coming of the messianic era. Exile is the period of separation or incomplete union of male and female, and the desire to overcome that condition is expressed primarily as the lust- ing of the male for the female other, although that passion is portrayed 103 Luzzatto, Ma'amar ha-Ge'ullah (n. 18 above), p. 28.

Prima facie, it would seem that the aggrandizement of the Shekhinah signifies the leveling of gender hierarchy in the time of redemption. And, indeed, Luzzatto at times expresses his view in this manner. Closer examination of the relevant passages, however, indicates that this process in fact signals the mascu- linization of the feminine. By way of illustration, let us consider the following citation: Now I will explain to you one principle and you will comprehend the rectifica- tion of the world ... The governance of the lower entities is always by means of Tif'eret and Malkhut ... and it is known to us that in the future her rectifica- tion will be the great rectification and her light will be very strong.... Concern- ing this matter it is said, "And the light of the moon shall become like the light of the sun" (Isa. 30:26), for she will no longer be smaller than he is but she will be equal to him. Then the two kings will make use of one crown.108 The messianic rectification of the Shekhinah involves the augmen- tation of her illumination to the degree that her light will be equal to the light of the masculine, expressed in the prophetic image of the light of the moon becoming like the light of the sun.109 Insofar as the sun is symbolic of the masculine and the moon of the feminine, it is evident that implicit in the prophetic description of the eschaton is the gender metamorphosis of the female into the male. Thus, in 'Adir ba-Marom, Luzzatto contrasts the diminution of the moon, which is related to the shattering of the primordial kings,110 and the augmentation of the light of the moon in the messianic redemption: 107 Compare Luzzatto, Pithe Hokhmah wa-Da'at (n. 41 above), p. 228: "Know that the elevation of the female waters of Nuqba' is by means of the offspring that derive from her, for she gathers into herself these branches, and by this power she arouses the male so that he will be stimulated to overflow.... It follows from this that the desire of the one who receives is first in the copulation, and this is the matter of 'Yet your urge shall be for your husband' (Gen. 3:16). Afterwards she receives the power to elevate the female waters, and it is the spirit that is given to her in the first intercourse, for its secret is in the secret of the corona ('atarah) where there are the forces of strength. Then she elevates the female waters by means of the gathering of her branches in her, for then she draws forth the new power from above in accordance with this arousal." 108 Luzzatto, Ma'amar ha-Ge'ullah, p. 72. 109 On the periodic shifts in the illumination of the moon as symbolic of the different states of the Shekhinah in relation to the world, and particularly with reference to the rela- tionship of the Jewish people to the faiths of Islam and Christianity, cf. Luzzatto, Qin'at ha-Shem Seva'ot (n. 8 above), pp. 112-14, 117-19. ll0 On the nexus of the dominion of the demonic serpent and the diminution of the light of the moon, cf. Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 110, p. 76. 314</page><page sequence="27">History of Religions "And the light of the moon shall become like the light of the sun," for the over- flow of which she is in need emanates upon her and it does not stop.... For, in truth, the Nuqba' is made only to receive from the male and to overflow to the lower beings. Hence, the perfection of her existence is the reception from the male and the emanation.... Even though it appears that this matter is outside her, for her light is from the male, it is not so, but it is the perfection of the Nuqba', for a part of her is the masculine influx that emanates upon her and joins her to overflow in her, and through this aspect she is rich and she has a great light.... This is the secret of the unleavened bread (massah) and the command- ment (miswah), for the unleavened bread is the "bread of affliction" (Deut. 16:3), and this is the aspect of her being alone and not the aspect of perfection from the side of Ze'eir 'Anpin. The commandment is perfection in the secret of "And the light of the moon shall become like the light of the sun." Therefore it says, When she is conjoined to the male, she is called miswah with the additional waw. It does not say that the male and female together are called miswah, mas- sah waw, but the Nuqba' is called miswah when she is joined to the male, for the perfection of the female is her unification with the male.11 Luzzatto elaborates on this theme in a passage in Qin'at ha-Shem Seva'ot, where he similarly notes that in her diminished state the moon is prototypically feminine inasmuch as she has no light of her own and passively receives all illumination from the active male. In this state, the judgmental aspect of the feminine is ameliorated (or sweetened)112 by the masculine attribute of mercy, and hence the latter rules over the former. In the messianic state, however, the female moon is equal to the male sun in stature and thus she is "in the secret of the male" (be-sod zakhar) or, more specifically, "in the secret of the strength of the mascu- line (be-sod gevurat ha-zakhar), which is verily the aspect of the sun, the aspect of the burning fire ('esh ha-soref)."113 Luzzatto thus speaks of two aspects of the Shekhinah. The first is the state of imperfection in which the male rules over the female, and the second is the state of perfection in which the female is rectified by the male and the forces of strength are mitigated. "Therefore the face of the sun and the face of the moon are together, for the aspect of the face of the moon is also contained in it in the secret of this mitigation. However, the face of the moon is alone when the acts of strength (gevurot) are not rectified, and there is naught but the domination of the male (shelitat ha-zakhar), and not the aspect of the mitigation of the acts of strength (mittuq ha-gevurot)."l4 Alternatively expressed, the tiqqun of the Shekhinah 1ll Luzzatto, 'Adir ba-Marom (n. 8 above), pp. 4-5.

This is implied, moreover, in Luzzatto's deliberate in- version of the rhetorical question placed in the mouth of the moon in the talmudic legend regarding the diminishing of her light: "Can two kings make use of one crown?"'17 According to Luzzatto, the positive image of two kings making use of one crown denotes the sexual union of the male sun and the female moon.118 That this union transforms the latter is made clear in the continuation of the passage, which describes the eschatological ascent of the Shekhinah to and unification with Hokh- mah, the second of the divine hypostases: Understand this matter well for it is thus written, "The Mount of the Lord's House shall stand firm above the mountains" (Isa. 2:2), this refers to Hokhmah, which stands above the mountains, and to there Malkhut ascends, as a result of which Binah dwells upon her children, "like an eagle who rouses his nest- lings" (Deut. 32:11). She will be there a crown upon the head [of Hokhmah], one together with and equal to the other. It is known that the male will be more hidden and internal than the female, for the order will not change, but the two will be perfected as is appropriate.119 Despite the fact that the power of the feminine Shekhinah is augmented in the time of redemption, the gender hierarchy remains intact and the 115 The basis for Luzzatto's chain of associations is Zohar 3:282a (Ra'aya' Mehemna'): "The Shekhinah is the radiance (nogah) and the 'radiance of fire' (nogah la-'esh), and from here they called the synagogue (bei kenishta') a 'radiant fire' ('esh nogah)."

The expression "to make use of the crown of royalty" is employed to denote sexual union with the Shekhinah in Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 42, p. 24. 119 Luzzatto, Ma'amar ha-Ge'ullah, p. 72. 316</page><page sequence="29">History of Religions male is given priority over the female. In that state, the feminine is transposed into the crown of the male, the esoteric significance of which I shall discuss below. Luzzatto depicts the ontic change in the status of the Shekhinah in several other images. For example, in one passage he relates this phe- nomenon to the verse, "Come, my beloved, let us go into the field" (Song of Songs 7:12): "The Shekhinah speaks this verse to the Holy One, blessed be He, and what does she say? 'Come, my beloved,' she speaks in this way when she has not yet come out from exile, but in the time of the redemption when her lover is with her, she says to him, 'let us go,' let us go out from exile, 'let us go to the field,' this is the supernal place, the place of joy and pleasure, 'the field that the Lord has blessed' (Gen. 27:27)."'12 What is implied here is made explicit in other pas- sages from the writings composed by Luzzatto and other members of his circle: Redemption entails the reintegration of the son and daughter (Tif'eret and Shekhinah) in the womb of the mother (Binah). Luzzatto's commentary on the continuation of the verse in Song of Songs, "Let us lodge in the villages," makes the point even more emphatically: This is the secret of what is written "Jerusalem shall be peopled as a city with- out walls" (Zech. 2:8) ... the emanation will be in great abundance, and this is called the "property without boundaries,"'21 [she will be] like Binah. The secret of this matter [is alluded to in the words] "Who is she" (mi zo't) (Song of Songs 8:5), the one122 is already rendered equal to the other123 on account of the mani- fold tranquility and the great perfection.... In the time of redemption, Binah, Tif'eret, and Malkhut are all joined together in a firm bond .... "It was there your mother conceived you" (ibid.). Comprehend that [the word hibbelatkha, "con- ceived you"] is [related to] the word hevel [literally, "rope" or "cord"], which connotes the bond of a great union, for there is the place of the joining together of Binah and Tif'eret, and Malkhut is joined to them so that they are one.124 Drawing upon much earlier kabbalistic sources, Luzzatto assigns a special role to Binah, the divine mother, in the redemptive process.125 Indeed, the eschatological status of this attribute is alluded to in some of the standard names associated with it in a plethora of kabbalistic texts, 120 Ibid., p. 48. 121 The expression nahalah beli mesarim is used in rabbinic sources to denote the eschatological reward. Compare Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 51a; Shabbat 118a; Luz- zatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 58, p. 36. 122 Malkhut is symbolized by the word zo't. 123 Binah is symbolized by the word mi. 124 Luzzatto, Ma'amar ha-Ge'ullah (n. 18 above), pp. 50-51.

The special role assigned to Binah in fostering the union of the son and the daughter is conveyed in the following remark that Luzzatto reports having re- ceived from his angelic guide (maggid): "Regarding this secret it is written, 'I will make a fitting helper for him' (Gen. 2:18), for until male and female were found [as one] the supernal mother did not rest upon him, but when the female was aroused in relation to the male, the mother dwelt upon them."126 The sotereological task of Binah is af- firmed in slightly different terms in this passage: From there wisdom shall go out to Israel in a river that is full, concerning which it says, "A river issues forth from Eden" (Gen. 2:10), from the side of the righ- teous one who is the foundation of the world, and Jerusalem shall be built in several wondrous names... and Your unity shall forever be known through it from the side of the supernal mother, for she is the canopy about which it says, "God restores the lonely to their homes" (Ps. 68:7), and similarly "over all the glory shall hang a canopy" (Isa. 4:5), so that each one in Israel shall draw close to his spouse.127 In the time of redemption, however, the union of male and female is so complete that it is portrayed not only as the conjugal intercourse of husband and wife, but as the return of the son and daughter to the mother's womb, the place where the offspring were originally conceived. This is the esoteric significance of the biblical injunction, "If, along the road, you chance upon a bird's nest, in any tree or on the ground, with fledglings or eggs and the mother sitting over the fledglings or on the eggs, do not take the mother together with her young" (Deut. 22:6). "The messianic king waits for the bird's nest, to ascend to there... when he ascends there, with him ascends the power of all the rectifica- tions that Israel rectified in the exile.... When he reaches there, the Shekhinah immediately dwells on them all, on each one according to his labor. In that very time 'the mother sits over the fledglings.'"'28 In his mystical ketubah, Luzzatto describes the final redemption in precisely these terms: "All of the rectifications reach the one light above that stands in the secret of the mother whose name is the 'end of days.' In the 126 Luzzatto, 'Oserot Ramhal, p. 256 (see n. 34 above). Compare Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 450, p. 365. 127 Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 466, p. 377. Compare ibid., sec. 508, pp. 411-12, where it is emphasized that the construction (binyan) of the destroyed Temple in the mes- sianic age ensues from the phallic gradation of Yesod, stimulated by the exposition of kabbalistic secrets. 128 Ibid., sec. 37, p. 21. Compare ibid., sec. 179, p. 157. On the ascent of Shekhinah to Binah as a sign of the eschatological redemption, cf. Valle, Shiv'im Panim (n. 18 above), 21b. It should be noted that in another passage in this work, 19b-20a, the elevation of Tif'eret, the son, to Binah, the mother, assumes a negative connotation. 318</page><page sequence="31">History of Religions time of the ascent of this bride above, all of these rectifications emerge and they become her dowry, for they are not lost, God forbid."129 Re- demption, therefore, may be viewed as the reversal of the birthing pro- cess in which the womb is opened. The eschatological return of the son and the daughter to the mother's womb is symbolized by Yom Kippur, which is another standard designation of Binah in kabbalistic litera- ture.130 Specifically, the prohibition of sexual intercourse and the liturgi- cal recitation in the afternoon service of the section of Torah that deals with uncovering the nakedness of the mother and of the father (Lev. 18:7) underscore the fact that on that day the union of male and female transcends gender binaries.131 The ritualized asceticism of Yom Kippur anticipates the behavior that best assists in the reunion of mother and children characteristic of the messianic era. In one passage, Luzzatto describes the assembly of the (male) souls of Israel in the Temple as a symbolic enactment of the union of these souls and the Shekhinah, which serves as the means for the unification of the masculine and fem- inine potencies of the divine: Just as Ze'eir 'Anpin does not draw close to the Shekhinah above until she is one in all her branches so that all are contained within her, so the supernal Patriarchs do not draw close to the Community of Israel, which is the kingdom of the 129 Tishby, Studies in Kabbalah and Its Branches (n. 9 above), p. 741. 130 Compare TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 111, pp. 76-77. Particularly interesting is the descrip- tion of Yom Kippur in Moses Hayyim Luzzatto's Qissur ha-Kawwanot (Bene Beraq, 1988), p. 123: "On Yom Kippur there is another specific matter and it is the disclosure of the interiority of the mother (penimiyyut de-'imma'). This is the time of the purification of the sanctuary (taharat ha-miqdash), for in truth a disclosure like this is not found in the other days of the year. This disclosure, however, is exclusively in the mother. This is the matter of the inner incense in the Holy of Holies. The outer sanctuary is the Nuqba' [Shek- hinah], the inner sanctuary is the mother [Binah], but the Holy of Holies is the interiority of the mother, and there is the rectification (tiqqun) on Yom Kippur. In the secret of this rectification, the father and Ze'eir 'Anpin [i.e., the son] enter, but the disclosure is in the mother." 131 See Wolfson, Circle in the Square (n. 7 above), pp. 102-3; pp. 219-20, n. 128. In Luzzatto's writings, following zoharic and Lurianic sources, Sabbath also represents the reintegration of the feminine to the masculine in a manner that overcomes gender dimor- phism. This motif is related to the name Shabbat, which is decomposed into the shin, sym- bolic of the masculine potency or the three patriarchs, and bat, the feminine Shekhinah. See Tishby, Wisdom of the Zohar (n. 48 above), pp. 1225 and 1264-65, n. 111; E. K. Ginsburg, The Sabbath in the Classical Kabbalah (Albany, N.Y., 1989), pp. 73-74. I have discussed the gender implications of this motif in my "Coronation of the Sabbath Bride: Kabbalistic Myth and the Ritual of Androgynisation," to appear in the Journal of Jewish Thought and Philosophy 6 (1997). The Sabbath, therefore, symbolically represents the as- cent of the Shekhinah and the consequent rule of the masculine potency over the feminine. Compare Luzzatto, Qin'at ha-Shem Seva'ot (n. 8 above), p. 135; TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 91, p. 56; sec. 296, p. 259; sec. 343, p. 288; Moses David Valle, Berit 'Olam: Be'ur Sefer She- mot (Jerusalem, 1995), pp. 498-99. In the same context, Valle also describes the elevation of the Shekhinah to Hokhmah on the Sabbath, a theme he relates exegetically to the verse, "You shall keep the Sabbath, for it is holy for you" (Exod. 31:14). 319</page><page sequence="32">Tiqqun ha-Shekhinah house of David, until all the souls of Israel are bound to her, and in that mo- ment it is said, "But I have installed My king [on Zion, My holy mountain]" (Ps. 2:6). This unification occurs as is appropriate in the Temple of which it is said, "Till I brought him to my mother's house, to the chamber of her who con- ceived me" (Song of Songs 3:4). The house from the supernal mother, which stands to unify this unification, as it is written, "God restores the lonely to their homes" (Ps. 68:7).132 The conjunction of the male Jews and the Shekhinah, ritually executed by the entry into the Temple, occasions the higher union in the divine. The union of son and daughter in the womb of Binah results in a radical change in the nature of the Shekhinah. In her elevation to Binah, the Shekhinah assumes the nature of the latter. According to Luzzatto's ketubah, this transformation is symbolized by the fifty pounds, the sum of the dowry, which correspond to the fifty gates of understanding that emanate from the mother to the daughter. "The he' of Malkhut is per- fected in all of her sefirot by the power that she receives from the mother and the house of her father, and she becomes a nun from the side of the mother, the straight nun."133 The latter he', which equals five, is attributed to Malkhut, but when she receives the influx from Binah, all of her sefirot, which are ten in number, are perfected, resulting in the sum of fifty, which is the numerical value of the nun, the letter attributed to Binah. The semiotic change from a he' to the straight nun marks the ontic transformation in gender from feminine to masculine,134 which implies that the daughter becomes a creative force like the mother and judgment is transmuted into mercy. In the symbolic orientation of theo- sophical kabbalah, motherhood is portrayed as the phallic potency of the feminine.135 The attribution of the role of Binah to Shekhinah signifies her transition from a state of containment to one of extension. This is the import of Luzzatto's citation of Zech. 2:8; that is, Jerusalem, a stan- dard symbol for the Shekhinah in kabbalistic literature, is depicted as the city so densely populated that it has no walls. The overcoming of the quality of restrictiveness, associated with the attribute of judgment, is conveyed as well by the application of the rabbinic term for eschato- 132 Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 470, p. 380. 133 Tishby, Studies in Kabbalah and Its Branches, p. 742. In Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 495, p. 398, the Shekhinah is described as being transformed into a straight nun when she is lifted up from the demonic realm by Binah. 134 On the messianic implications of the straight nun in kabbalistic symbolism, see Wolfson, Along the Path (n. 102 above), pp. 83-86. In TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 202, p. 189, Luzzatto emphasizes the androgynous quality of the straight nun, for it symbolizes the human form in the chariot, which comprises male and female. 135 Regarding the masculine and phallic aspect of motherhood in kabbalistic symbolism, see Wolfson, Circle in the Square, pp. 98-106. 320</page><page sequence="33">History of Religions logical reward, "property without boundaries," to the Shekhinah. By as- cending to and becoming one with Binah, the Shekhinah transcends all boundary and limitations.136 On numerous occasions in his writings, Luzzatto characterizes re- demption as the reunion of the mother and daughter, a motif that figured prominently in zoharic and Lurianic materials. Thus, in one passage he describes the redemption as the "time when the two lips, which are the upper and lower Shekhinah, are united, and it immediately says, 'Who is she who comes up from the desert' (Song of Songs 3:6), through Your unity that unites them, as it is written, 'Only one is my dove, [my perfect one,] the only one of her mother' (ibid. 6:9)."137 Commenting on a pas- sage in the Zohar wherein the mother is described as lending her gar- ments to the daughter,138 Luzzatto writes: "When the Nuqba' is alone in her aspect, she is the dark judgment to which Sitra' 'Ahra' is attached, but when her existence is perfected from the side of the mother, in the secret of her garments, her judgments are ameliorated and she is rec- tified by the great rectification."139 The rectification of the Shekhinah therefore consists of the gender metamorphosis from passive female to active male, which is portrayed in the image of the daughter donning the clothes of the mother. The phallic nature of this transformation is made 136 Compare Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 74, p. 45. 137 Ibid., sec. 160, pp. 134-35. 138 The relevant passage occurs in Zohar 1:2a. For discussion of this text and its inter- pretation in Lurianic material, see Wolfson, Circle in the Square, pp. 104-6. Compare Valle, Shiv'im Panim (n. 18 above), 17b. The influence of the zoharic passage is also discernible in the following comment found in B. Sack, "The First Version of the Tomer Devorah of R. Moses Cordovero" (in Hebrew), Asufot 9 (1995): 173: "Malkhut is in the aspect of [the letter] he', that is, the secret of her dissemination to overflow upon every- thing, and her limbs spread out to every side. When she is called he', she is in the world of the feminine below, for the letter he' signifies femininity. When Israel go up [to Jerusalem] during the three festivals in the secret of 'all your males shall appear before the Sovereign, the Lord' (Exod. 23:17), they transformed the face of the he' to a yod, which is verily mas- culine. She removes the form of this he' and gathers her branches, and she is concealed in the letter yod, to ascend from the feminine to the masculine. That is, she is a he' from the side of the edifice of Binah . . and she is a yod from the side of Hokhmah by means of Binah. Now she is adorned by the males who are shaped by the commandment of circum- cision, the sign of the yod in the letter yod by means of Binah from the side of Hokhmah." Compare Moses Cordovero, Pardes Rimmonim (Jerusalem, 1962), 14:3, pp. 73d-74b, and Zohar 'im Perush 'Or Yaqar (Jerusalem, 1962), 1:16. 139 Luzzatto, 'Adir ba-Marom (n. 8 above), p. 16. In that context, Luzzatto relates the metamorphosis of the Shekhinah to the biblical narrative concerning the ark of Noah. Symbolically, the ark signifies the status of the Shekhinah after she has received illumina- tion from the splendor of the supernal mother. Interestingly enough, Luzzatto also con- nects this symbolic complex to the Zohar itself; that is, the kabbalistic text, like Noah's ark, provides shelter to save the righteous from the raging waters of the demonic other side. See Rubin, "Zoharic Works of R. Moses Hayyim Luzzatto" (n. 9 above), pp. 397-98. Compare the words of Michael Terni, one of the members of Luzzatto's circle, cited in Benayahu, "Poetry, Prayer, and Confession" (n. 10 above), p. 45: "The perfection of the rectification (shelemut ha-tiqqun) is when 'Imma' and Nuqba' are joined together." 321</page><page sequence="34">Tiqqun ha-Shekhinah even more explicitly in the following passage in which Luzzatto re- flects on the enlarged 'ayin and dalet of Deut. 6:4, the former corre- sponding to Binah and the latter to Malkhut: 'Imma' and Nuqba' are joined as one, "Who is she" (Song of Songs 3:6), and the heart comprehends. The 'ayin is enlarged and the dalet is enlarged, for when 'Imma' is united with Nuqba', she grows big like her... as the mother who nurses her son, gimmel and lamed, everything is a tower (migddal), and this is [alluded to in the verse] "The name of the Lord is a tower of strength" (Prov. 18:10), for the lamed is the tower extended in the air.... The supernal Yesod rules and unites everything as one like the name YHWH, which is everything, united together in the 'alef, [whose orthographic shape can be decomposed into] yod waw yod, the yod on the right, the yod on the left, and the waw in the middle that unites them, "He imposes peace in his heights" (Job 25:2).140 Binah, or the persona of the divine referred to as 'Imma', is characterized as the supernal Yesod, which no doubt corresponds to the lower Yesod, or the divine phallus.141 The phallic element is highlighted by the fact that the union of the mother and the daughter creates one unified entity, which is imaged in the shape of a tower, a rather obvious phallic sym- bol.142 In the state of messianic tiqqun, the Shekhinah assumes the na- ture of the procreative phallus as a result of her union with Binah, for she is enlarged and adopts the role of a nurturing mother. CROWN OF HER HUSBAND: REDEMPTION AND THE MASCULINIZATION OF THE FEMININE According to the widely accepted symbolism of the theosophic kab- balah, the male is correlated with the attribute of hesed, divine grace, and the female with the attribute of din or gevurah, judgment or strength. The union of these two, as I have already remarked, results in the con- tainment of the female in the male, the left in the right. The amelioration of feminine judgment by masculine mercy is actualized in the messianic redemption. Thus, reflecting in his ketubah on the esoteric significance of the sum of the dowry for his marriage, Luzzatto writes: "One hundred 140 Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 481, p. 388. 141 In Trevis, Razin Genizin (n. 18 above), pp. 188-89, Messiah ben David is associated symbolically with Binah and Messiah ben Joseph with Yesod. Messianic redemption is thus described (on the basis of Dan. 12:3) as the illumination that ensues from the union of the two messianic figures: Messiah son of Joseph is the channel that carries the divine overflow from the Messiah son of David to the Shekhinah. In Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 473, p. 382, Messiah son of David is identified with Binah, referred to as Leah or the concealed world ('alma' deitkkasya'). Compare Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 187, p. 170, where the phallic nature of Binah is related to the image of a river that illuminates the maskilim in the mysteries of Torah. Compare ibid., sec. 237, p. 224. 142 Compare Luzzatto, Shiv'im Tiqqunim (n. 18 above), sec. 26, p. 64. 322</page><page sequence="35">History of Religions silver pounds for the union is complete, the male and female in the image of a perfect stature, 'male and female He created them and called them Adam' (Gen. 5:2). Then the left is sweetened by the right, the female is bound to the male, and the silver [symbolizes that] everything is mercy."143 That the redemptive process involves the reintegration of the female to the male can be seen in the following comment of Luz- zatto in 'Adir ba-Marom: "A person must be clean and pure in his ac- tions and his study must be precisely for the sake of the rectification of the Shekhinah, to restore her to the king."144 Luzzatto explicitly glosses the meaning of tiqqun ha-shekhinah as restoring the feminine back to the masculine. The key ontological principle is articulated by Luzzatto in another passage from this work: "In truth the feminine is made only to receive from the masculine and to overflow to the lower beings. Conse- quently, the perfection of her existence is the reception from the mascu- line and the emanation."145 Similarly, in Kelalim Ri'shonim,146 Luzzatto affirms the secondary ontological status of the feminine when he writes that "Ze'eir 'Anpin is the essence for Malkhut is the terminus of Ze'eir 'Anpin, the principle of illumination that brings forth this world."147 The nature of the feminine Shekhinah is determined exclusively in relation to the masculine potency; indeed, the function attributed to the Shekhi- nah is of a decidedly masculine quality. In Pithe .Hokhmah wa-Da'at, the hierarchical relationship between the male and the female is articulated by Luzzatto in slightly different terms: "The matter is that which is re- vealed148 below in Ze'eir and Nuqba', which is the place of governance, emanates above them and below them. Therefore, every inner light ('or penimi) is the secret of Tif'eret, and every external vessel (keli hison) is 143 Tishby, Studies in Kabbalah and Its Branches (n. 9 above), p. 742. Compare Moses David Valle, 'Or 'Olam: Be'ur Sefer Bere'shit (Jerusalem, 1993), p. 155. Commenting on the verse, "I now establish My covenant with you and your offspring to come" (Gen. 9:9), Valle writes: "The secret is that the erection (haqamah) specifically needs Yesod in order to complete the union (ziwwug).... He intimated to him through this that from that point forward there would be a union above as there is below in a manner that was not the case during the flood ... for there was no union in the supernal, holy gradations ... for there is no union in the governance of judgment but only in the governance of mercy. When judge- ment returns to its sheath and mercy spreads forth in the world, the union above and below is renewed. This is the secret of 'I now establish My covenant with you and your offspring to come,' the dissemination of mercy in the world, which causes the union, will not cease." The depiction of the redemption in terms of the image of the containment of the left in the right and of the right in the left is repeated on a number of occasions in Valle's Shiv'im Panim, 2b, 8b. 144 Luzzatto, 'Adir ba-Marom, p. 41. 145 Ibid., p. 5. 146 Concerning the composition of this work, see Benayahu, Kabbalistic Writings of R.

In the first edition of Moses Hayyim Luzzatto, Pithe Hokhmah wa-Da'at (Warsaw, 1884), 7a, the reading is nimshakh, which should be translated as "emanates." 323</page><page sequence="36">Tiqqun ha-Shekhinah the secret of Malkhut, and every encompassing light ('or maqqif) is the secret of Binah, for Hokhmah is the absolute interiority (ha-penimiyyut ha-gamur) and Keter is the source (ha-shoresh), but149 in the future to come the encompassing will be from the aspect of Malkhut."150 In the hierarchical structure of the sefirot, the feminine is associated with the external container and the masculine with the internal content. This hierarchy is operative on two different planes in the sefirotic realm: Malkhut is the vessel that contains the internal light of Tif'eret, just as Binah is the light that encompasses the interior light of Hokhmah. What is most significant for this study is the concluding remark, "in the future to come the encompassing will be from the aspect of Malkhut." This statement alludes to the recurring eschatological motif in Luzzatto's thought to which I have already referred, that is, the moment of redemp- tion is marked by the transformation of Malkhut into Binah. The image of the encompassing light attributed to Malkhut signifies, therefore, that the lower feminine has been elevated to the higher feminine, which is masculine in relation to the former. The ascent of the daughter to the mother thus entails an inversion of gender attribution. This is not to say that the female becomes higher in status than the male, but only that the female itself is integrated into the male on a higher level. The encom- passing light is a receptacle that surrounds and contains the inner light. But it is a receptacle from on top rather than from below, which is the posture ascribed to Malkhut in her normal state. Redemption, therefore, entails the reversal of positions such that the power that receives is placed atop the power that bestows. The transposition of gender valence is conveyed more frequently in Luzzatto's writings by the use of the symbol of the crown. An allusion to this symbolism is found, for example, in Ma'amar ha-Ge'ullah: "From the time of the peqidah the crown ('atarah) began to be built for the Messiah, and it is known that this crown is the [aspect of the soul called] yehidah.... In those days, therefore, he will ascend in great de- grees without limit, for the King of kings will coronate him with the crown of his glory ('ateret kevodo)."151 The coronation of the Messiah is concomitantly a process unfolding in the divine realm. Indeed, the crown of the Messiah is identified as the most sublime aspect of the soul, called yehidah, which is rooted in the sefirotic potencies, and as the crown of God's glory, 'ateret kevodo, which refers to the Shekhinah. 149 Interestingly enough, this statement occurs in the Warsaw edition, 7a, but not in the more recent one (see Pithe Hokhmah wa-Da'at, p. 158). 150 Luzzatto, Pithe Hokhmah wa-Da'at (n. 41 above), p. 158. 151 Luzzatto, Ma'amar ha-Ge'ullah (n. 18 above), pp. 23-24. Compare Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 374, p. 310. 324</page><page sequence="37">History of Religions Hence, the statement that from the time of the first phase of redemp- tion, the peqidah, the crown began to be built for the Messiah alludes to the fact that the Shekhinah itself is constructed during the messianic period. 152 To appreciate the full implications of Luzzatto's remark, it is neces- sary to probe more deeply into the symbolism of the crown and its par- ticular application to the Shekhinah. According to Luzzatto, who again follows a well established exegetical tradition in kabbalistic sources, the term 'atarah denotes the phallic aspect of the Shekhinah, which is at the same time the feminine aspect of the phallus. Indeed, the corona of the male organ, 'ateret berit, is at once the locus of the feminine in the masculine and the masculine in the feminine. Consider the following remark of Luzzatto in 'Adir ba-Marom: I will convey to you the matter [of the verse, "The Lord through wisdom] estab- lishes the earth," for the Nuqba' has two aspects: The aspect of the vessel (keli) that is in her, as they have said,153 "a woman establishes a covenant only with the one who makes her into a vessel," as well as the reality of the Nuqba' from the aspect of Yesod, for the corona of the phallus ('ateret yesod) is the beginning of the existence of the Nuqba'.... The first intercourse is in the secret of the [acts of] strength, and she is built through them to receive afterward the male waters, and she is called "sea" in this aspect. Afterward, in the secret of the male waters she is the "earth," that which is sown and produces fruit.154 In the first aspect, the Shekhinah is compared to a vessel or the sea that passively receives the overflow of the male; in the second aspect, how- ever, the Shekhinah is depicted as part of the phallus in the form of the corona, which designates the masculine dimension of the feminine, also alluded to in the image of the fruit-bearing earth. In producing her yield, the feminine earth adopts the posture and function of the male. Most significantly, the procreative dimension of the Shekhinah is linked to the symbol of 'ateret yesod, the corona of the phallus. The messianic rectification of the Shekhinah is most fully achieved when she is restored to the male as the phallic crown. Many passages from Luzzatto's writings that illustrate this point could have been cited, but for the purposes of the present study I will mention one selection from 'Adir ba-Marom, in which Luzzatto displays his remarkable homi- letical prowess. He begins by saying that "the aspect of Malkhut is the 152 Compare Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 292, pp. 256-57. The role attributed to the Messiah in that context is to take the crown ('atarah), i.e., the Shekhinah, out from exile and to restore it to its pristine glory. Compare ibid., sec. 477, p. 385; sec. 505, p. 408. 153 Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 22b. 154 Luzzatto, 'Adir ba-Marom (n. 8 above), p. 134. 325</page><page sequence="38">Tiqqun ha-Shekhinah secret of the commandment (miswah), the 613 commandments... for this is the corona of the phallus ('ateret ha-berit), for she alone receives all 613.... Thus, in truth, this corona has an important function for she is parallel to all 613. Therefore [the rabbis,] blessed be their memory, said:155 Great is circumcision for it is equal to all the command- ments."156 The Shekhinah is thus localized in the corona of the phallus, which is symbolized by the letter yod in the name Shaddai. When the yod is removed from the name, what remains is the word shed, the de- monic power associated with the gentile nations. The disclosure of the yod through the exposure of the corona occurs only in relationship to Israel in the secret of Malkhut: "Yesod emanates and is revealed in the secret of Shaddai, in the secret of this form and seal, for, in truth, Yesod comprises this corona ('atarah).... Thus, in truth, this corona is the secret of Malkhut, which is contained there."157 Luzzatto draws the obvious conclusion from the fact that the Shekhinah is identified as the corona of the phallus: "The supernal sefirot are all in the secret of the masculine that takes shape according to Malkhut . . but the corona is Malkhut according to the aspect of Yesod, which is the secret of the commandment.... It follows according to this that all of the sefirot are in the secret of yod he' waw and the corona is in the secret of the final he.'"158 The anthropomorphic configuration of the sefirot is in a mascu- line form, and the feminine element, Malkhut, is itself part of this male anatomy.159 It is precisely the disclosure of this aspect of the divine that signals the transition from exile to redemption: The secret of the corona ('atarah) is the rainbow (qeshet) ... and this is the se- cret of the unity itself, that is, the secret of the commandment (miswah) in the secret of the conjunction of the male ... and this is verily the secret of the rain- bow, which comprises all the gradations in a single unity, in the secret of the yod, as we mentioned.... Thus, we have already said that since the aspect of the rainbow at one time was disclosed, it will never again be removed from the world, but it may be hidden by covers that darken.... When it is covered, then is the exile, but when it is removed from these coverings, then shall be the re- demption, in the secret, "I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant" (Gen. 9:16).160 155 Palestinian Talmud, Nedarim 4:14, 38a; Babylonian Talmud, Nedarim 32b. 156 Luzzatto, 'Adir ba-Marom, p. 6. 157 Ibid., p. 7. 158 Ibid. 159 Compare Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 334, pp. 282-83, where the Shekhinah is described as the "image of the anthropos" (demut 'adam) that contains the unity of the holy name (YHWH). To be sure, the perfect human comprises male and female, which reflects the unity of the letters of the name, but the locus of the androgyny is in the phal- lus, and the feminine element is identified as the corona. 160 Luzzatto, 'Adir ba-Marom, pp. 9-10. 326</page><page sequence="39">History of Religions The corona of the phallus, which is here identified as the rainbow, is the locus of the unity of masculine and feminine within the Godhead.161 The rainbow, therefore, is the feminine element that has been integrated into the male as the sign of the covenant. From this vantage point, exile is described as the concealment of the (phallic) rainbow and redemption as its disclosure.162 "As long as there is deceit in the world this rainbow does not stand in its strength... for the foreskin covers it. When truth rules this corona ('atarah) is revealed, and this is salvation for the right- eous one (saddiq)."63 This very point underlies the following prayer of Luzzatto to God: "'Raise the horn of Your people, Israel,'164 this is the 'righteous one who is the foundation of the world' (saddiq yesod 'olam) 161 In 'Or 'Olam (n. 143 above), p. 156, Valle comments on the verse, "This is the sign that I set for the covenant between Me and you" (Gen. 9:12), in the following manner: "The word 'this' (zo't) indicates that he pointed with a finger, for God, blessed be he, showed them the rainbow that is in the clouds on a rainy day, for it alludes to the supernal union of Yesod and Malkhut. The word 'this' (zo't) precisely is the secret of Malkhut and it is commonly known that the 'sign of the covenant' ('ot berit) is Yesod. If the attribute of judgment rushes to seek the complete destruction of the universal judgment, the rainbow, which alludes to the union, is disclosed to stop her indictment, for in any event when there is union there is no place for the universal judgment.... In every generation when the attribute of judgment rushes to her prosecution, the rainbow immediately is revealed in order to bring to mind the covenant, and this is the secret of the union that nullifies the judgment. Therefore they said that the disclosure of the rainbow is a bad sign for the world, for they were worthy of the universal judgment had it not been for the disclosure of the holy union that abrogates it. From that which they said [Zohar 1:72b], 'when you see the rainbow shining in its colors expect the feet of the Messiah,' it seems that it is a good sign and not a bad sign.... It is a clear sign of the coming of the Messiah and of the rectification of the world. Since the rainbow alludes to the supernal union, it is not dis- closed except as it is garbed within the cloud, for the holy matters are not revealed to the lower beings without a garment." 162 Compare Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 34, p. 20; sec. 310, p. 268; sec. 451, p. 366; sec. 342, p. 288. 163 Ibid., sec. 62, p. 40. On the description of the messianic future in terms of the dis- closure of the phallus and the removal of the demonic foreskin, cf. Valle, Shiv'im Panim (n. 18 above), 3b: "According to this secret it is written, 'and for all the great might and awesome power that Moses displayed before all Israel' (Deut. 34:12), for through him was the rectification of the phallus (tiqqun ha-berit) and the removal of the foreskin (ha'avarat ha-'orlah), and through him also was the disclosure of the supernal lights before all Israel, 'The glory of the Lord shall appear, and all flesh, as one, shall behold' (Isa. 40:5), the 'flesh' precisely, for the heart of stone shall be removed and in its place shall be given the heart of flesh (cf. Ezek. 11:19, 36:26), which will be able to see and to draw pleasure from the splendor of the lights that derive from the rectified Yesod. Concerning this secret it is written, 'Then your Master will no longer be concealed, but your eyes will see your Mas- ter' (Isa. 30:20), 'From the end of the earth we hear singing: Glory to the righteous!' (ibid. 24:16), for by means of the songs of the 'singing of the tyrants' (ibid. 25:5), the esoteric significance of which refers to the cutting of the foreskin, the glory and the beauty of the 'righteous, foundation of the world' (Prov. 10:25) is immediately revealed, and it will never be hidden or concealed, for 'The Lord has sworn by His right hand etc.' (Isa. 62:8)." See ibid., 13a. 164 From the prayer 'Avinu Malkkenu, which is recited as part of the liturgy during the ten days of repentance from Rosh ha-Shanah to Yom Kippur. 327</page><page sequence="40">Tiqqun ha-Shekhinah (Prov. 10:25), who is the horn of the jubilee (qeren ha-yovel).165 When the foundation of the mother (yesod 'imma'), the supernal river, il- luminates him, immediately, 'He has exalted the horn of His people' (Ps. 148:14), by means of several lights, the secrets of Torah that issue forth from that very river to him. Through them it says with respect to the Shekhinah, 'I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant' (Gen. 9:16)."166 The Shekhinah thus adorns herself in the form of the rainbow when the divine gradation that corresponds to the phallus re- ceives the influx of light from the mother. The uplifting of the phallic component is accomplished through the dissemination of the secrets of Torah, which emanate from the divine mother to the phallus and from there to the Shekhinah. In the process of overflowing, the Shekhinah it- self is assimilated into the everlasting covenant of Yesod in the form of the corona. This eschatological hope is repeated by Luzzatto in another prayer: "'In that day, I will set up again the fallen booth of David' (Amos 9:11) . . . through the secrets of Torah, which are from the side of the supernal mother, for when the Shekhinah is adorned in them, it says with respect to her, 'I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant' (Gen. 9:16). Not all of the secrets are equal, but when the Shekhinah is adorned in the secrets of Your unity, it is said that the rainbow is seen in her colors, immediately, 'I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant.' 167 The phallic transformation of the Shekhinah in the messianic rec- tification is affirmed by Luzzatto in an astonishing interpretation of the narrative concerning Noah's ark and the rainbow in Qin'at ha-Shem Seva'ot. Luzzatto asserts that there are two aspects of the rainbow: "One is her aspect in exile in which she is garbed in the shells, which is ex- clusively to guard [Israel]. The other is in the time that she removes the garments of the weekday in the time of redemption, for then it says regarding her, 'I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant' (Gen. 9:16), to arouse the union."168 Noah's entry into the ark symboli- cally represents the unification of Yesod and the Shekhinah, but in the process of phallic penetration the space of the female is itself trans- formed. Hence, Luzzatto speaks of the ark being made in the form of the shin, which represents the three attributes, Hesed, Din, and Rahamim, the central pillars of the sefirotic pleroma. The construction of the femi- nine in this manner reflects the tiqqun ha-shekhinah that was necessary to protect the righteous against the floodwaters of the demonic. Indeed, 165 Josh. 6:5. According to the Zohar (1:96a, 2:123a, 3:19b), the qeren ha-yovel sym- bolizes the Shekhinah, whereas, according to Luzzatto, this expression refers to Yesod. 166 Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 265, p. 240. 167 Ibid., sec. 383, p. 317. Compare sec. 164, p. 139; sec. 237, p. 224; sec. 408, p. 336. 168 Luzzatto, Qinat ha-Shem Seva'ot (n. 8 above), p. 93. 328</page><page sequence="41">History of Religions the ark is identified as the rainbow, which, as we have seen, refers to the feminine element concretized in the masculine. The reconstitution of the androgynous phallus in the case of Noah's ark anticipates the final rectification of the Shekhinah in the messianic redemption. CONCLUSION There can be no question that the central doctrine in Luzzatto's messi- anic teaching is tiqqun ha-shekhinah. In contrast to other scholars who have focused exclusively on the heterosexual eros implied in this con- ception of redemption, I have argued that Luzzatto, in compliance with older sources, maintains that the union of the two genders results in the enfolding of the feminine back into the masculine. In the first phase of redemption, the appropriate language is the unification of male and fe- male, but in the second and culminating phase, heterosexual symbolism gives way to the monosexual ideal wherein the female itself is trans- muted to the male in the form of the crown that sits on the head of the righteous, which is a symbolic depiction of the corona of the phallus. The disclosure of the latter is the ultimate mark of redemption, for it symbolizes the ontic restoration of the female to the male and the con- comitant overcoming of gender dimorphism. In the last of his 515 mes- sianic prayers, Luzzatto describes the ontological condition of the divine potencies in the eschaton in precisely these terms: Everything goes to one place in the four letters of Your holy name that rules, and this is what is revealed in Your world in the time of which it is said, "The glory of the Lord shall appear [and all flesh as one shall behold]" (Isa. 40:5). In that time, "the Lord shall be king [over all the earth; in that day there shall be one Lord with one name]" (Zech. 14:9), for by means of this secret He created Adam in His image, and through it "God made Adam upright" (Eccles. 7:29). [The word] 'adam is [numerically equivalent to the tetragrammaton spelled out as] YO"D H"A WA"W H"A, which comprises all of Your gradations as is appro- priate for all of them are contained under Your unity, to make through it one [entity], "I found only one human being in a thousand" (ibid. 7:28), and the Shekhinah rests on his head for she is the crown on the head of every righteous person. 169 The divine gradations in the time of redemption are configured in the shape of a single anthropos, symbolized by the unity of the letters of the tetragrammaton. The gender of that anthropomorphic form, moreover, is clearly masculine. The feminine potency, the Shekhinah, is not por- trayed as an independent being standing opposite the male. On the con- trary, the unity within the Godhead is so complete that the feminine is 169 Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 515, p. 419. 329</page><page sequence="42">Tiqqun ha-Shekhinah described as the crown that sits on the head of the masculine form. The identification of the Shekhinah as the crown on the head of the righteous signifies that the female has been ontically restored to the male. The eschatological status of the Shekhinah as the masculinized fe- male, or the female reintegrated to the male, is also conveyed by the biblical description of the "capable wife" as the "crown for her hus- band" (Prov. 12:4). When the rectifications of the Shekhinah are com- pleted and the evil is restored to the good, then the unity of the divine is disclosed through the Shekhinah, and she becomes the "crown of her husband," which signifies her infinite ascent to the uppermost regions of the Godhead.170 In this capacity, the female attains a higher status than the male because the glory of the latter is revealed only through the former. One might be tempted to argue, therefore, that the tiqqun of the Shekhinah results in a reversal of gender roles, for the female rises to the top and assumes the position of a crown on the head of the male. However, the portrayal of the Shekhinah as the crown only rein- forces the androcentric orientation of the kabbalistic symbolism, for the worth of the female is still evaluated strictly from the perspective of the male. Indeed, as I have argued, the female who sits atop the male as a crown on the head has been transposed into an aspect of the phallus.171 Support for my claim may be gathered from a comment made by Luz- 170 Compare Luzzatto, Kelalim Ri'shonim (n. 77 above), sec. 26, p. 275, Luzzatto, 'Adir ba-Marom (n. 8 above), p. 53; letter of Luzzatto to Isaiah Bassan in Ginzburg, Rabbi Moses .Hayyim Luzzatto and His Generation (n. 12 above), p. 66, no. 30; and Luzzatto, Shiv'im Tiqqunim (n. 18 above), sec. 69, p. 133.

Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 440, p. 358; sec. 497, p. 400; sec. 503, pp. 404-6. The elevation of the Shekhinah is also emphasized by Valle, Shiv'im Panim, 2a, as the first rectification, which is the "rectification of the redemption," tiqqun ha-ge'ullah. More specifically, Valle remarks that Moses, who is identified as the husband of the Matrona, empowers the two messianic figures "to lift up the Shekhinah to the highest of all the gradations." Compare ibid., 6a and 18a, where the messianic rectification is de- scribed, inter alia, in terms of the image of the Shekhinah dwelling upon the righteous one (saddiq), which corresponds to Yesod. 171 In TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 482, p. 389, Luzzatto describes the "perfect rectification" (tiqqun shalem) of the Shekhinah or her union with her husband in terms of the image of the cup being lifted up by the fingers of the hands (based on Ps. 116:13). As a result of being uplifted in this manner, the Shekhinah itself is identified as the yod, whose numeri- cal value is ten corresponding to the fingers. But the yod is also an obvious phallic symbol, and Luzzatto clearly alludes to this in the following remark: "When she ascends above, she is not seen except as a yod that is concealed. Concerning this it says, 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone' (ibid. 118:22), for through Your unity she disappears so that through her Jerusalem will be built in an everlasting construc- tion, as it is written, 'The Mount of the Lord's House shall stand firm etc.' (Isa. 2:2)." Com- pare ibid., sec. 200, p. 187; sec. 386, p. 319; sec. 497, p. 400. In Shiv'im Tiqqunim, sec. 69, p. 133, the messianic transformation of the Shekhinah into a yod is connected with the symbol of the crown of the husband (Prov. 12:4) as well as the image of the moon shining with the light of the sun (Isa. 30:26). 330</page><page sequence="43">History of Religions zatto in Qin'at ha-Shem Seva'ot, reflecting on the androgynous nature of Sabbath: The secret of the matter is that Malkhut in her aspect below is in the secret of the seventh. When she unites with Yesod in the secret of the copulation he him- self becomes the seventh since she is a crown on his head. Therefore [he is] the seventh because he is the sixth that is crowned by the seventh. From his own side he is a waw, but on account of Malkhut who is joined to him he is called the seventh. He is the secret of a waw and the yod is upon him, which is the zayin. Then, on account of his name, the Shekhinah is called sedeq because he is the saddiq.172 According to this passage, the phallic Yesod is transformed by its union with the Shekhinah from the sixth day to the seventh. This is represented orthographically by the image of the crown, which is the yod, rising to the top of the waw, which no doubt is meant to convey the formation of the zayin, symbolic of the seventh. As a result of this union, more- over, the seventh assumes the name sedeq, "righteousness," on account of the sixth, which is called saddiq, "righteous." The unification of Yesod and Malkhut, the sixth and the seventh, the waw and the yod, rep- resents the reconstitution of the androgyne in the divine phallus. The androcentric nature of the image of coronation is driven home when we realize that the depiction of the Shekhinah as the "crown of her husband" is an alternative way of conveying the idea that the Shek- hinah is the corona of the phallus. The convergence of these symbols is made explicit in the following supplication of Luzzatto before God: "Crown us in the light of Your presence, for she is the crown on the head of the righteous one, and Israel are righteous for they come from the supernal Yesod.... Immediately, the Shekhinah certainly becomes a crown on his head, and this is 'a capable wife is a crown for her hus- band' (Prov. 12:4)."173 In this context, the crowning motif is descriptive of man's relationship to the Shekhinah in the messianic redemption, but it is clearly based on the theosophic dynamic: Just as above the Shekhi- nah is the crown on the head of Yesod, so below she can become a 172 Luzzatto, Qin'at ha-Shem Seva'ot, p. 115. The privileged status of the feminine vis- a-vis the masculine on the Sabbath is expressed in the following way in Trevis, Razin Genizin (n. 18 above), p. 210 (partially corrected according to Manuscript Jerusalem, Jew- ish National and University Library Heb 805217, fol. 79a): "Come and see: On the days of the week the blessing of the world is from the aspect of the male, and this is the secret of the six days. The Shekhinah takes the power on each of those days from the male and through it she governs the world. On the day of Sabbath, however, blessing is from the aspect of the Shekhinah, certainly [a day of] rest and repose. On the days of the week the Shekhinah must take power from the male to govern the world, but on the Sabbath it is not so, for the gradations of the male must be rectified in the Shekhinah in the secret of the Sabbath." 173 Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 455, p. 369.

The eschatological coronation has important implications for understanding the respective value assigned to human sexuality and asceticism. In the final analysis, the ascent of the Shekhinah as the phallic crown signifies the unification of gender that is decidedly asexual. In an attempt to emulate the re- deemed state of the Godhead, the messianic task of tiqqun ha-shekhinah on the part of the mystic necessitates engagement in carnal sexuality with the proper intention followed by the abrogation of eros.174 To re- store the feminine to the phallic potency of the divine, which is the ulti- mate rectification of the Shekhinah, it is necessary for the righteous to be crowned by the divine feminine, an erotic bond that is predicated on the subjugation of physical desire. New York University 174 I am not suggesting that the messianic redemption demands an absolute and un- qualified asceticism. On the contrary, it is clear from Luzzatto's writings that he main- tained that the body in general is purified in the time of the Messiah and not abrogated. See n. 77 above. My point is, rather, that the restoration of the feminine to the masculine in the form of the corona of the phallus can be achieved only by one who has abstained from engaging in conjugal sex. The positive role assigned to human sexuality is connected to the theurgic task that one has in unifying the male and female aspects of the Godhead, which is the initial phase of the redemption, but to sustain the integration of the feminine in the masculine, it is necessary to abstain from physical sex. Hence, the erotic conjunc- tion with God in the culminating stage of redemption does necessitate some form of sexual asceticism. See my study referred to above in n. 47. Compare Luzzatto, TQT"W Tefillot, sec. 404, p. 333. The conjunction with the Shekhinah in the messianic era is predicated on the fact that the masculine and feminine elements are united and hence the original sense of sexual innocence (Gen. 2:25) is restored to man and woman. Ascetic renunciation on the part of the righteous in their effort to achieve the messianic goal of the rectification of the Shekhinah seems to be implied in Valle, Shiv'im Panim (n. 18 above), 3b: "This is the import of the verse, 'I adjure you, O maidens of Jerusalem, by gazelles or by hinds of the field: Do not wake or rouse love until it please!' (Song of Songs 2:7).... Initially, it was necessary to rectify the secret of the back and then to come in the light of the face.... The one who rectifies in the posture of the secret of the back benefits for he restores all the evil to the good.... This is the secret of the verse, 'I adjure you, O maidens of Jerusalem, by gazelles or by hinds of the field,' the maidens of Jerusalem refers to the secret of the righ- teous engaged in the rectification of the Shekhinah.... The righteous themselves need to be strengthened until they achieve the termination of their labor and the completion of the rectification, which is to arouse the love. Surely they do not consume the fruit of their ways until the love is aroused." 332</page></plain_text>
