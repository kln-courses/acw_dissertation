(Grades 3-4) This biography of a 215-year-old sugar maple tree begins with the fa- miliar - a seed - and leads students through an interdisciplinary exami- nation of historical and biological changes over time. The author's ap- pealing ink-and-watercolor illustra- tions visually trace the theme of change. The Big Tree invites exten- sion activities and could easily inspire a unit that incorporates science, en- vironmental education, social stud- ies, language arts, mathematics, and visual arts around the unifying theme of the changing tree. Informational content is appropriate, accurate, and clearly presented without resorting to anthropomorphism. - Frances L. Lawrence</page></plain_text>
