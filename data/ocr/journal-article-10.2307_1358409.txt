<plain_text><page sequence="1">sual experience of great psychic force. We might take this insight to heart and reflect on the picture of feminist visual praxis that emerges if Lippard's foundational premises are reconfigured. Political-even revolutionary-consciousness can emerge from modalities of aesthetic or imaginative experience in more complex, mysterious ways than we sometimes allow. "Art," writes bell hooks, "was for me a realm where every imposed boundary could be transgressed." Hooks's description, made without apology, of her love of Willem de Kooning's painting, frankly addresses the ostensible paradox of a black Southern woman whose pleasure in Abstract Expressionism is linked both to a recuperative power that keeps mind and will vitally alive, and to a resistance to confusing the aesthetic and institutional.7 On the face of it, her contention that "Art has no race or gender" seems startlingly anachronistic in the context both of current discourse and early feminist theory. It suggests, however, as do Cole's paintings, the multiple and layered possibilities from which feminist artistic practices are launched, to which a future criticism might attend. Lippard's prominence as a critical voice for the feminist artists' movement since the seventies undeniably gives The Pink Glass Swan a distinct authority. Many will wel- come it, as I do, as a bracing reminder of where we have been and an inspiration to where we might be headed. Lippard entered the arena when feminist art and criticism had a genuinely fresh power, an exuberant, near- ly swaggering optimism; her voice-sharp, colloquial, angry, insightful-contributed in no small part to that energy. Its reappear- ance as another generation of historians, artists, and critics deliberate on their own positions vis-a-vis feminism is well-timed. If the sum of these essays does not quite add up to Lippard's intentions for them, The Pink Glass Swan is nonetheless a tantalizing pro- legomena to a full-length study of feminist art as it metamorphoses under the pressure of its own history.

Lesbian Art: An Encounter with Power by Elizabeth Ashburn Craftsman House, 1996 Damn Fine Art, By New Lesbian Artists by Cherry Smyth Cassell, 1996 Reviewed by Deborah Durie t seems that 1996 was the year for "coming out" books on lesbian artists, including from England, Damn Fine Art by Cherry Smyth, and from Australia, Elizabeth Ash- bum's Lesbian Art. Each presents a discus- sion of lesbian art practice and investigates the discourse surrounding this practice. Both are lavishly produced with many color plates. Lesbian Art by Elizabeth Ashbur, an art teacher for 30 years and a lesbian activist, is a bold and at times provocative statement about contemporary lesbian art practices in Australia. It is a welcome addition to the growing compendium of texts by Australian feminist theorists and the first testimony to the strength of the lesbian (art) community. It also reflects a widening acceptance and tol- erance within mainstream (art) society of les- bian lifestyles and further asserts the growing demand for recognition by lesbians of their lifestyle and art production. Ironically, this stance also allows lesbian artists to step away from the dominance of male homosexual po- litical and cultural agendas. "Self declaration" is the defining measure for inclusion in the text. The experience of the artists varies- from those just out of art school to those in- volved in art practice for more than 30 years. The book consists of three sections. The first provides a dissertation in five chapters examining the position of lesbian artists in Australian culture. The chapter headings, "Fighting Invisibility," "Emerging," "Finding Power," "Working Together," and "Dyke Power" set the stage for a strong statement on the subject. They assert a lesbian presence and promote an increasingly visible, at times contentious, participation in community life. The middle section consists of 24 color plates, and the last and largest, "Surveying the Field," consists of a statement and a black-and-white image by each of the 55 artists represented. The opportunity for the artists to speak for themselves "through their art work and also in artists' statements, interviews and in their own creative and scholarly writings" (11) provides evidence of growing courage to express what has for so long been hidden. Ashbum writes: The works and words of these artists enrich our lives. In contesting the power of patri- archal and homophobic societies to deter- mine the shape and meaning of their lives these artists offer strategies of empower- ment and collaboration while exploring the multifaceted and open ended structures and meaning of lesbian experience. (12) The focus of Lesbian Art, as clearly stated by the subtitle, is twofold: to examine "lesbian art as it encounters the power of a hostile.. .society that has tried to render it in- visible [and to describe] the work of lesbian artists encountering their own creative power to make art that contests this patriarchal and homophobic social order." (10) The book be- gins with the premise that "the growth of les- bian creative expression reflects and rein- forces their empowerment." (10) Ashburn wants "to establish both the physical pres- ence of lesbian art in mainstream art in Aus- tralia and to document the continual creation of their meanings of that existence." (11) WOMAN'S ART JOURNAL</page><page sequence="2">According to theorist Teresa de Lauretis, in "the very act of assum- ing and speaking from the position of subject, a woman could concur- rently recognise women as subjects and as objects of female desire."' In contravening the two genders (man and woman) specified by masculine sexual desire, lesbians deliberately step outside this binary paradigm and thus encapsulate the notion of lesbianism as the "third sex."' It is a question of desire for the sex that is the same, rather than different. "For the lesbian [sexual desire] in- cludes a relation to the self-same."3 This is clearly articulated in C. Moore Hardy's mixed-media collage Flotwers for the Future Generation (1955), which shows two women, eyes locked on each other, under the text "just looking." The stance of each suggests mutual sexual desire. The diversity of lesbian art practice is recorded, from Hardy's documentary photo- graph of S&amp;M, Ms Wicked Competition (1991), to Maree Azzopardi's evocative, mixed-media images of women emerging from laverings of sensual floral surfaces, as in Her Comlpanion in Solitlude (1994), to explicit images of women making love, to explorations of goddess imagery such as Ann Sheridan's lithograph, Earth lMother of Willendorf (1992). All question society's phallocentric dominance, providing the reader with a vari- etv of ways to define or redefine lesbian art. As the text suggests, some lesbians do not sup- port S&amp;M practices, while others see it as le- gitimizing the "consensual relationships" of power. (31) This in itself provides for a ten- sion within the text as stereotyped images of "butch-femme" representations, occurring primarily in performance sites, collide with more subtle transgressive stances. Ashburn reports that several lesbian artists chose to be excluded from the book because their work did not reflect their les- bian desire and therefore could not be counted as lesbian art. Further, they object- ed to being labeled: "They felt the term les- bian, or women or black when added to 'art'...had the potential to diminish the quali- tv of their work as it would then be consid- ered a less valid form." (15) Some feared be- ing marginalized. Barbara Bolt explained: "There is an implicit lesbian text, but do I choose to announce this?" (15) Others de- clined to be included because they had not come out in the public arena. So what is lesbian art, if art made by lesbians can not be included in a book about lesbian art? And does this exclusion further marginalize these practitioners from being .. . y.. , . Fig. 1. Fiona Lawry, Heartbreaker (1993), oilstick on drafting film, rope, 122 x 160 cm. made visible in mainstream art practice? In a polymorphic societ, where definitions of sex- uality, culture, and race continually undergo slippages, it seems problematic that some women who are also lesbians refused to be represented in this text. So what is lesbian art? The problematics of definitions are evident: Terms like "dvke," "butch," and "femme" are often used without being clear- ly defined. Many of the artists call them- selves dykes, which Gever and Magnan con- sider a derogatory term.4 However, in Les- bian Art the descriptor dyke seems to be a self-naming of empowerment. The terms "lesbian," "homosexual," "gay," and "queer" are discussed. Queer is used to encompass lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transsexual orien- tations. Several of the artists call themselves queer. However, Ashbum warns that queer- ness may well subsume lesbians within gay male culture. The boundaries of gender are expanded even further when transsexuals call themselves lesbian. Hence in Perth, at the Art Space Project, only "women...born as women" are allowed to participate in lesbian art activities. (25) Ashburn positions lesbian identity within the constructs of "sexual inversion," which was first used as a medical term at the turn of the century by sexologists Westphal, von Krafft-Ebing, and Lomroso (all men) refer- ring to women who dressed as men and sexu- ally preferred wvomen. At that time lesbians were actually called "inverts."5 Lesbian writ- ers like de Lauretis, Gever, and Magnan have developed the idea of the invert as the "third sex." "Lesbians find ourselves outside heterosexual systems, placed there by history and sometimes by choice....in the particular struggle against the institution of heterosexu- alitv."6 The vision presented in this book is of women who refuse to be defined within het- erosexual, patriarchal confines. In this sense, as Gever and Magnan suggest, they are not "women," as through their art and lives they are reclaiming the ',, many faces of woman that are not tied to a patriarchal binary of sexu- ality; hence the terrain of the third sex. As photographer Hardy explains: Like most people I dislike being la- belled. I do not speak on behalf of the lesbian community: I represent myself and speak for myself. I searchfor ways of representing im- ages of women that empower them and challenge patriarchal expecta- tions of women. My images had re- mained within the lesbian arena but now Ifind it necessary to pub- lish outside as it is important to be less "invisible." (97) In her discussion of lesbian involvement in early feminism, Ashburn invokes Adrienne Rich's term "lesbian continuum," which was devised to unite "all women whether lesbian, bisexual or heterosexual through the focus of woman identification.... Any woman who was woman-identified could be lesbian." (19) Despite the inclusiveness of Rich's intention, Ashburn, at the start of Chapter Three, "Finding Power," writes that "lesbian exis- tence displays aspects other than unity." (28) She defines three strategies used by artists to explore "lesbian consciousness." In the first strategy artists revisit sites of familial or cultural origins, for example, re- tracing goddess motifs (Pam Sinnott, Ann Sheridan, Chris Ireland, Akkadia Ford, Jacqui Stockdale, and Michelle Peate). Peate's The Blinding Cnj, a large metal con- struction of a skeletal winged form suspended from a wall casts eerie shadows that evoke a phoenixlike, anticipatory, other-worldly force. Peate writes: "I alchemically play with tran- scending that which I perceive to exist and chaos into illusions you can touch.... There is a suggestion that shamanic transformations have taken place." (111) Ford's spikey, galva- nized steel Insatiable Chair (1993) speaks of "the awakening of the latent Ancestral Mem- ory, containing consciousness of the body as a shamanic tool." (95) To sit on the chair is to be punctured from below and behind. The spaces of discomfort are negotiated via the distaff of Celtic and Samurai warrior modes. The second strategy, which explores les- bian sexual desire, focuses mostly on perfor- mance art. De Lauretis notes that butch- femme "camp" roles were developed during the 1950s in performances at lesbian work- ing-class bars.7 This now includes playing out S&amp;M roles in specified venues and exchang- 0 FALL 1998 / WINTER 1999</page><page sequence="3">ing gender roles in queer performances with drag queens. "Dykes often performed with drag queens and sometimes they were boys or girls or drag queens.... The performance of gender as multiple and unfixed becomes just another role," (32) according to Ash- burn. The focus is on "eroticising every- thing"; it is very camp and interrogates the lesbian erotic. "In art which places sexual de- sire up front, lesbian viewers need to come to terms with their own feelings towards les- bian sexuality." (30) Many of the perfor- mance and photographic works by Groovii Biscuit, Deej Fabic, C. Moore Hardy, Tina Fiveash, Marion Moore, and Katherine Reeves, among others, play with images of butch-femme and gender blurring. Cross- dressing and cross-referencing with the gay community is a theme throughout the book. De Lauretis elaborates on this point: Lesbian representation [depends on] the critical effort to dislodge the erotic from the discourse of gender, [which is] concur- rent and interdependent with a rethinking of a...gendered sexuality.... Lesbian artists and writers have sought to escape gender, to deny it, transcend it, or perform it in excess, and to inscribe the erotic in cryptic, allegorical, realistic, camp or other modes of representation.8 Fiona Lawry's photorealist Heartbreak- er (1993; Fig. 1) also redefines the female erotic. A slim figure in jeans is circumnavi- gated by a wide belt, with a large metal buck- le. Her hands, positioned at her hips, hold a looped rope. This powerful stance, with fo- cus on the crotch, recalls Western film genre; indeed, the artist is exploring the im- age of the cowgirl. The feet are apart ready for action, the means of capturing is the rope. It could be seen as a butch propaganda image. To the artist, it represents "the power of femininity and the power of desire" and the feeling of being desirable. (101) The third strategy includes "colonising masculines sites" of creation, for instance, sandstone carving, steel sculpture, and com- puting technologies. Linda Dement, Rose Anne McGreevy, Michelle Barker, Sarah Waterson, Rea, and the collective VNS Ma- trix all play with notions of gender in high- tech arenas. "These game girls who populate cyberspace ambiguously and polymorphously are new models in a post-gendered world," the technology giving them the "opportunity of finding new and vital images for lesbians," Ashburn writes. "There is, however, no uni- versal agreement or validity of these strate- gies." (35) This seems to be an odd com- ment, given the innovative, exciting, and challenging work that is being produced by 0 these (and other women) in techno-space. The colonizing of cyberspace is certainly a challenging strategy, as seen in the VNS Matrix poster A Cyber Feminist Manifesto for the 21st Century (1992). A central bare- breasted female figure supports on her slen- der shoulders a huge blue ball on which a manifesto is inscribed: "We are the virus of the new world disorder/disrupting the sym- bolic from within/saboteurs of big daddy mainframe/the clitoris is the direct line to the matrix/we are the future." (56) What is the "post-gendered world"? Is it the one depicted in the eroticized dyke/ queen performance gags, or is it found in the newly formulated femme-techno-viscerated bodies that populate the imaginary of cyber- space? Is the post-gendered world one in which corporeal sites of gender or of eroti- cism are made abject (as in Dement's 1988 digital photograph Suck my Cock), eliminat- ed, reconstituted, and sucked back out again? All at the touch of a button. Do such acts of transgression that attempt to deny gender difference (male, female, third sex) obliterate the repugnant duality? Computer artist Rea's images interrogate not only her dispossession from her Aborigi- nal heritage but also negotiate the spaces of her lesbian identity. She writes: The ideas for Lemons and Resistance 111, came from my thoughts about the lack of visibility of the blak body and the lesbian body.... As a blak artist I have to continue to take risks to construct my own visual representations of images. I use language to identify the world I live/survive in. My own body becomes a canvas, but my images are painted via the use of my computer. I am a photographer who has chosen to work in new technologies...because...l can construct multiple realities with these tools, realities which include all my experiences and don't just reinforce the norms of cul- tural and sexual dominance. (115)9 A divergent technological exploration is expressed by performance artist Anna Sabiel. The documentary photograph of her perfor- mance Internalised Cities (1995) shows Sa- biel naked, suspended from scaffolding. Her body is attached to microphones, so that the sound from each movement reverberates in the space. As this text indicates, lesbian artists have a strong following within the lesbian and gay community, and the increasing popularity of the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras at- tests to a growing interest and tolerance with- in Australian culture. Ashburn also wants to deconstruct stereotypes about homosexuality. One highly successful enterprise was Syd- ney's Lovely Mothers Poster and Billboard Project (1993-94), involving Elisa Hall, Catherine Fargher, Marion Moore, and Deb- orah Kelly, who produced and hung in public spaces photographic posters and billboards of lesbians and their families. Funding was ob- tained from the Australia Council. Artists have traditionally spoken from so- ciety's margins, and it is from this position that questions concerning the structures that undermine and hold marginalized groups at bay must be posed. Ashbur heralds the les- bian and gay artists position of "difference," as it is from this position that their power and voices are seen and heard. She fears "that les- bian art will lose its potential for deviance and transgression once it is commodified and em- braced by the mainstream." (27) Since "capi- talism is constantly seeking new arenas to colonise...the pursuit of the 'gay dollar' is causing the marketplace to reassess the via- bility of lesbian 'products.' This," she con- cludes, "can lead to the mistaken belief that commodification is progress." (11) One of the positive outcomes of lesbian art practice has been the pooling together of resources, creating woman power, group mo- bilization, support, and action. This is particu- larly framed in Chapter 4, "Working Togeth- er." Five collaborative projects are recorded, some supported by local government fund- ing. The Theba Project promoted safe sex through the "Sex, Fun and Esteem" postcard venture under the direction of Fiona Arnold. Outcity Projects gave young lesbian and gay artists the opportunity to exhibit slides of their work in a park as part of the 1995 Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. The Dam Dykes Poster Project promoted positive lesbian sex- uality and safe sex practices; the poster, show- ing lesbians using the "dam" was banned from public display. In Dykes Like Us, Tina Fiveash photographed lesbians in a mode chosen by themselves. The WOM (Word of Mouth), attached also to the Mardi Gras, has also provided visual and performance artists access to public participation. VNS Matrix, a group of five artists and theorists, explores a feminist-defined cyberspace and imposes a critique of its masculine terrain. A variety of questions remain. For exam- ple, is there lesbian as opposed to women's art? Given the parameters set out by this text, and by other lesbian writers, the answer is yes. Although this demarcation is clearly made, it is not universally affirmed, as many lesbians reject labeling. And what of lesbian artists who choose not to address lesbian issues? Will they fall by the wayside, between the lesbian and mainstream art communities? Has the au- thor's monocular vision on lesbian issues as- suaged her from tying in the struggle to over- come patriarchy across feminist fronts? Does WOMAN'S ART JOURNAL</page><page sequence="4">lesbian art differ from art made by heterosex- ual women who also interrogate a phallocen- tric society and celebrate female sexuality? The book suffers from too many general- izations, especially in the first two chapters containing the historical overview. A more detailed examination of Australian women's art history with new readings of earlier Aus- tralian women Modernists with links to the European lesbian communities is needed. Al- so the text focuses on the Sydney lesbian community, shortchanging other art centers. Nevertheless, Lesbian Art is a publishing milestone. Ashburn's close affiliation with the struggles for gay and lesbian political rights, with lesbian organizations, and with the artists represented is evident. She authorita- tively paves the way for future investigations and celebrations of lesbian art and identifies strong lesbian art practices. Lesbian repre- sentation is central to lesbian politics and subculture, and the artists draw richly on the history of 20th-century lesbian culture. De Lauretis comments that earlier feminist em- phasis on sexual difference opened up "a crit- ical space-a conceptual, representational and erotic space-in which women could ad- dress themselves to women."'? Elizabeth Ash- bur has provided both the written and visual space for women to address other women, despite their sexual preference. I highly rec- ommend this book as an insightful and infor- mative text about contemporary lesbian art practice in Australia. Cherry Smyth, a critic and writer living in London, offers an overview of the work of about 60 lesbian artists, mostly from Eng- land and the United States. The focus is very much on the now-work produced in the 1990s, and the artists are young, most born since the late fifties. The title, Damn Fine Art, provokes a two-pronged stand within contemporary art discourses: It heralds the high standard of work represented in this book, mostly by lit- tle-known artists, and, as she writes, "While some of the work is allusive, clever, opinion- ated, and much of it is funny, direct and sexy, all of it is damn fine art." (6) Damn Fine Art can also be read as an "in your face" gesture of defiance against the prevail- ing genealogies of predominantly male "fine" artists and their residual art practices. This stance flaunts gay pride within the tra- ditionally demarcated boundaries of gender- specific roles and behaviors, thus challeng- ing not only familiar representations of women, whether produced by male or fe- male artists, but also provoking an acknowl- edgment of a rising group of artists whose representations of female bodies are no longer tied to gender-specific cultural norms. This reading is inherent within the growing claim upon the title queer, which is used by gays to distinguish themselves from historically and culturally conditioned no- tions of "hetero" males and females. Della Grace (b. USA, lives in London) exemplifies this in her statement: "It's not 'neither/nor', it's 'either/or' and sometimes both. It's be- coming harder to tell what femininity and masculinity really are and who possesses them." (42) Smyth clarifies her intentions in her in- troduction, asserting that the book is about "visual art by lesbians that could be dubbed 'queer'-confrontational, anti-assimilation- ist, provocative." She locates the definition within a contemporary setting, remarking that unlike the 1970s, when "feminist and lesbian artists tried to cohere around a fixed notion of sexual identity," current "queer artists are located around an agreed sense of the mutability of identity and gender, a questioning of what 'lesbian/dyke' is, was and will become." (1) Smyth embraces defi- nitions, writing, "As 'lesbian' is increasingly subsumed by 'queer,' which is taken to mean 'gay, white male,' I chose to retain and exalt that old awkward term, 'lesbian,' while pre- senting artists who identify as lesbian, dyke, gay and/or queer and may or may not have sex with men." (2) By offering a broad definition of lesbian- ism, Smyth sidesteps the problematic of a "sexualised content which...reduces the work merely to being read as sexual." Rather than trying to define lesbian art, she asks: "What are artists who define themselves as lesbians doing in their work and how does that extend knowledge and understanding of the world from a lesbian perspective?" This base allows incorporation of artists who de- fine themselves as bisexual. Smyth also admits that "queer art can be produced by non-homosexuals." (2) Her rhetoric on the selection of artists includes an apologetic for presenting a mostly Eurocentric representa- tion of women. Although some "artists of colour" (African-Americans Leonore Chinn and Lola Flash; Patricia Torres, b. Mexico; and Ingrid Pollard, b. Guyana, living in Lon- don) are represented, it is surprising in the wake of so much postcolonial discourse, that more non-European artists are not included. However, Smyth notes, "If white lesbian art is disparate, dispersed and under-document- ed, then work by artists of colour is a hun- dred times more so." (3) Artists selected for inclusion in the book all had at least one solo show, and the focus is on painting, sculpture, cartooning, digital art, and multimedia installations. Performance art, film, and video are not represented. These omissions are disappointing since several no- FALL 1998 / WINTER 1999 table Australian lesbian artists are producing groundbreaking work in these arenas, as no doubt are others in the international art com- munity. Another area de-emphasized by Smyth is photography, which she notes has been well documented in other texts." The structure of the book is straightfor- ward. After the Introduction the ensuing eight chapters articulate various aspects of lesbian art practice as characterized by Smyth. Each chapter begins with a brief essay by Smyth followed by a two- or three-page spread plus a reproduction for each artist represented in that section. The artists' voices are heard, Smyth quoting either from interviews or their responses to a questionnaire. Chapter One, "This Body Is Mine," in- cludes artists who "adapt conventional modes of figuration to reconstruct a powerful 'les- bian' body that defies stereotypical represen- tations of the female form and what a lesbian looks like." (8) Interestingly, Smyth here chooses work executed in traditional, fine art media: oils, acrylics, pencil, and sculpture. The female body is thus represented within realistic, domestic, and sometimes comical or surrealistic figurations. Chinn's painting Break from Pulp (1994) is a powerful image of African-American women, painted in a photorealist style. Black women's literature and an African-fabric rug articulate a strong image of solidarity. "Vulva Goes to School and Discovers She Doesn't Exist," Chapter Two, offers artists who "push erotic representations of the body both in subject matter and form beyond the parameters defined by conventionally ac- cepted ideas of lesbian subjectivities." (22) The works in this chapter represent trans- gressive possibilities of lesbian desire. E. G. Crighton's (b. USA) mixed-media piece, Gains and Losses (1992), shows photographs of skin, pierced and held on two metal rings, in booklet format. Beneath the skin-stitched pages, hair, cotton threads, and netting pro- trude. Other, more graphic works represent taboo intentions, for example, Carrie Moy- er's (b. USA) charcoal drawing Untitled (1994), showing a young girl standing be- tween a naked woman's (mother's?) legs with tongue extended, and Della Grace's Her- maphrodyke (1995), an oil-touched photo- graph of lesbian lovemaking. Chapter Three, "Hijackers," focuses on reinterpretations of previous images within a lesbian context. Some artists appropriate, of- ten pornographically, Renaissance or Impres- sionist paintings, while other adopt strategies from popular culture (film mostly). Whether utilizing high culture or parodying popular film icons, the works are witty; a self-reflexive shadow humor is also evident. Deborah Kass (b. USA) draws inspiration from Warhol, the 0</page><page sequence="5">"first queer artist," in Chairman Ma (1993), her screenprint of Gertrude Stein. "What Remains," Chapter Four, high- lights the legacy of AIDS and its impact within the lesbian community. Safe sex is addressed in the photographic construction by Tessa Boffin's (1962-93, England) Angel- ic Rebels: Lesbians and Safer Sex (1989). The American team Leone and Macdonald, in Ashes, Ashes We All Fall Down (1989-91), created a braille message in sand that docu- mented the names of friends who had died from AIDS. The title recalls the English nursery rhyme that refers to the bubonic plague. The raised sand dots (braille) stand like sentinels in memory of the lost lives. Belying this seemingly simple aesthetic is a powerfully reflective work. Lesbian activist and grassroots urban community work addressing sexism, racism, and sexual violence against women are the subjects dealt with in Chapter Five, "Mean Streets." The collective DAM (Dyke Action Machine), which evolved in New York City in 1990 from Queer Nation, was founded to heighten lesbian visibility. Their poster Straight to Hell (1994) depicts a dyke gang of three: an African-American, a Caucasian, and an Asian. Shot from below, wearing "gang-boy gear," these three offer an impos- ing image that reiterates the defiance of the title. Also working outside New York's art gallery setting is the group of four, Fierce Pussy, that, like the Guerilla Girls, uses posters and photocopies to subterfuge main- stream art activities. The work of several conceptual artists is encapsulated within Chapter Six, "Material Seduction." Jaya Schiirch's (b. Switzerland, lives in Italy) VII (Clam) (1994) is an ex- quisite minimalist sculpture in Staturio mar- ble. The artist speaks: "My hands retain a physical memory of shapes and curves that I love in a body." (98) Other works wittily draw on Duchampian reconstitutions of found objects, for example, Julia Kunin's (b. USA) Eggboard (1991). "Cartoonesque," Chapter Seven, includes artists using ani- mation and cartoon. Patricia Torres's oil on canvas, On the Air (1989), could well have been placed in an earlier chapter; however, the figures are stylized and cartoonlike. Leslie Bostrom's (b. USA) woodcut, Baby- dolls in Love (1995), shows two huge car- toon heads on tiny bodies. The tongue on the brunette to the left plunges into the ear of the blonde. The final chapter, "Parallel Worlds," in- cludes artists who use a variety of media to explore the worlds of the imaginary. Meta- morphosed male saints appear in women's bodies in the work of French sculptural team Ange et Damnation. Svar Simpson's 0 (b. England) meditative, androgynous plas- ter Cat Yogi (1983) is followed by Linda De- ment's (b. Australia) digitized From Cyber- flesh Monster (1995). In crossing boundaries into cyberspace Dement opens up arenas hitherto unexplored. The arena of the phan- tasmagorical is played out in her virtual spaces by anthropomorphic beings. This informative and provocative but by no means exhaustive book offers discussion couched strongly within current queer cul- ture and discourse positionings. It no doubt will provide encouragement to many. The brutal honesty and forthright nature of les- bian politics of desire and resistance is a sig- nature of the artworks represented. The text and images successfully fill a gap in the doc- umentation of lesbian, and more broadly speaking women's, art practice at this fin de siecle. Don't be shy, read it for yourself. NOTES 1.

At Beck and Call: The Representation of Domestic Servants in Nineteenth-Century American Painting by Elizabeth O'Leary Smithsonian Institution, 1996 Reviewed by Mary Ann Stankiewicz hey stand in the shadows, behind the family members, on the edges of the room, or in an open doorway. Their clothing is muted, providing a neutral backdrop for the real subjects of the paintings. The earliest 19th-century portrayals of household servants relegate both male and female workers to the margins of the canvas. By the end of the cen- tury, however, male servants have almost dis- appeared from view. The subject of the paint- ing is a kitchen maid, house maid, or server. Her skin is luminous; it glows in the light that pours into the picture like Vermeer's Dutch sunlight. The objects that surround her are painted as carefully as she-the porcelain vase, brocade chair, and silver candelabra gleam in the cool light. In some paintings she becomes another precious object, like the blue cup or Chinese figurine, announcing the collector's good taste and refined sensibility. In At Beck and Call, Elizabeth O'Leary, a historian of American art who lives in Rich- mond, Virginia, traces changing depictions of domestic servants from colonial portraits of boys and men with their African-American menservants through early-20th-century paintings by the Boston School in which Irish Bridget becomes another beautiful object necessary to the Brahmin lifestyle. During her research she uncovered 150 images, rang- ing from Thomas Nast's racist mid-century caricatures to Cecilia Beaux's 1894 Ernesta (Child with Nurse), a charming portrait of a child holding the hand of a faceless, anony- mous caregiver. The book includes 118 illus- trations, only 8 in color. O'Leary examines 19th-century paintings as social documents that both recorded and contributed to the so- cial reproduction of contemporary beliefs and values. Her topic enables her to examine crit- ically issues of class, gender, race, and ethnic- ity in American life. O'Leary's exploration of the complex relationships among painted im- ages, ideologies, and social history is both thoughtful and thought-provoking. The first chapter shows how early-19th- century ideas and images were influenced by colonial and British models. Late-18th-centu- ry images of African-American servants standing in the margins of their masters' por- traits followed British models by depicting passive black figures whose function was to enhance the white master.
