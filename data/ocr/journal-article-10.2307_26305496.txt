<plain_text><page sequence="1">MARY BERGSTEIN Freud's Uncanny Egypt: Prolegomena Egypt in all its guises—bibhcal, ancient, and modern—was a place of uncanny "otherness" in Freud's visual and historical imagination. This mental construct was formed from both hieroglyphic writing and Freud's collection of small-scale statuary. Uncanny visual representations of Egypt were also found in books and photographs in his archaeological library, as well as in wood engravings in the Philippson Bible, which he encountered for the first time in early childhood. Manifest subject matter associated with Egypt included mummies, dandng-girls, works of andent art, and romantic desert landscapes. The present reflections on Freud's multifaceted fasdnation with Egypt are offered as prolegomena to open prospects for further research. Sigmund Freud never traveled to Egypt, but a photographic postcard, dated October 11,1913, from Sândor Ferenczi in Bu dapest of an Egyptian relief of Alexander the Great with the god Amun-Ra indicates that such a journey was at least fantasized by Freud (fig. 1). The relief, from a shrine erected by Alexander within the already-ancient Luxor Temple, depicts the conqueror as a pharaoh in the Blue Crown presenting an offering to Amun-Ra in ithyphallic form.1 Freud surely recognized Amun Ra, king of all the gods, in this image; he even came to possess a limestone votive stele and a bronze votive statue of Amun-Ra in his private collection (Marinelli 1998, nos. 16, 24). Ferenczi had acquired the postcard, which is captioned only as "Interieur d'un Temple" ("Interior of a Temple"), from a friend who had been to Egypt that September, and proposed in his note that he and Freud also travel there together in the bearable September weather: "Maybe we'll do it next year!" (Brabant, Falzeder, and Giampieri-Deutsch 1993, 512). Although the physical journey was not undertaken, Freud's interior voyages to Egypt—both All works of art and photographs in the illustrations to this article are in the public domain.

From the daydreams of early childhood, to musing over his collections of books and ancient sculpture in maturity, through the adventure of Moses and Monotheism (1939) in old age, Egypt—biblical, ancient, and modern—was a place of un canny "otherness" in Freud's visual and historical imagination. In Moses the Egyptian: The Memory of Egypt in Western Monotheism (1998), Jan Assman poses deep questions about historical time and geographical space: what did Egypt mean for Freud and his contemporaries? What did it mean for psychoanalysis? Drawing on the idea that "cultural memory" and "cultural forgetting" are essentially Freudian concepts (215), Assman examines Figure 1.</page><page sequence="3">Mary Bergstein 187 Freud's deployment of the paradigms of history, archaeology, and psychoanalysis, together with his preoccupation with Egypt as a veritable "subtext of the Bible" (208). According to Assman, the Western construction of Egypt begins with the Bible, where Judaism is a monotheistic counter religion, poised against Egyptian polytheism for its own defini tion. Egypt was a shattering "symbolic opposite" to the Hebrew culture that sprang from its land, therefore fulfilling ante litteram Freud's (1919) definition of the uncanny as a paradoxical shock reverberating between sensations of extreme familiarity and strangeness. In cultural memory, then, Egypt represents an extreme of despotism, sorcery, and idol-worship (Assman 1998, 11). The Hebrew Bible contains within itself the image of Egypt, idolatrous and fantastic, as its own counter-image. Was Egypt the dark side of the moon? In Freud's imagination, Egypt is both more and less than that, a Mediterranean civiliza tion congruous to and coexistent with the land of the biblical Jews—a culture that yielded artistic production of the most arcane and mysterious order. At the same time, in what Edward Said (1978) has eluci dated as the "orientalist" manner in which the West looked dis tortedly at the East, whether in serious study or popular culture, Egypt is an exotic culture where time stands still, where past and present are circular and simultaneous. In these prolegomena, I would like to point to some of the many images (imaginary as well as concrete) that occur in Freud's visual landscape of Egypt, Arabia, and North Africa—a place loosely described, in modernity, as the Islamic world. Hieroglyphics and Statuary Egyptian hieroglyphic writing was, in its structural form, a way of imagining dream-language for Freud, who used the anal ogy of deciphering hieroglyphics to the decoding of apparently irrational dream "language" in The Interpretation of Dreams. 'The dream-content is, as it were, presented in hieroglyphics, whose symbols must be translated, one by one, into the language of the dream-thoughts" (1900, 341). Freud's further analogy be tween reading hieroglyphs and reading a rebus is flawed, but</page><page sequence="4">188 Freud's Uncanny Egypt it was an effective means of explaining both hieroglyphics and dreams to the general reader. Freud studied hieroglyphics—which are neither pictorial nor textual, but rather a unique system of image-phonetic-sym bolic configuration—in the illustrated handbooks that formed a niche of his own library. According to Ernest A. Budge, whose First Steps in Egyptian: A Book for Beginners (1895) Freud owned, hieroglyphics had a complex and mutable syntax. Glyphs could be arranged in vertical columns or horizontally from left to right or right to left, 'To ascertain the direction in which an inscription is to be read we observe the direction in which men, birds, and animals face, and then read towards them" (3). In such writing, there is a double presence of ideographs and phonetic characters, both of which are pictorial in construct. Ideographic signs are to be interpreted sometimes literally and sometimes figuratively (manifestly or latently, as it were). The hieroglyphic language was thought to be charged with symbol ism: for instance, the ideograph for happiness is a pictograph of what Budge took to be a musical instrument.2 Because of their ancient and hermetic nature Egyptian hieroglyphs were already uncanny and required interpretation. Freud's personal acquisition of Egyptian sculpture was inspired by the Austro-Hungarian Imperial Collections in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, and by the general phenomenon of "Egyptomania" in Western Europe after Jean-François Champollion's first translation of hieroglyphics in 1822. In Max Pollak's famous etching of Freud working at his desk, figures represented contra-luce, including the goddess Neith and the Head of Osiris, loom as if, in the words of Michael Molnar, "the stage were set for some imminent interaction between the man and the figurines" (2006, 19). The objects in his collection were a constant visual and tactile stimulus to Freud; in fact, he used his small sculptures as dolls, even inspecting and fondling them while seated at the dinner table with his family (Burke 2006, 5n9, 277). Lydia Marinelli's catalogue, "My... Old and Dirty Gods": From the Collection of Sigmund Freud (1998), is a seminal contribution to the study of Freud's fascination with ancient sculpture, with essays by leading scholars.3 The roles played by photography and wood engraving in the construction of Freud's Egypt, however,</page><page sequence="5">Mary Bergstein 189 have been much less studied. Pictorial representations in these latter media came in the form of images closely associated with the act of reading, often of a deadpan demeanor, which docu mented Egypt and its excavation. Let us consider some of the published photographs in Freud's library. Sculpture, Mummies, and Men As for Egyptian subjects in photography, what could be more uncanny than a mummy? As the living embodiment of the dead, mummies and portraits of Egyptian kings were well known to Freud from the books in his personal library. Georg SteindorfFs The Great Age of the Pharaonic Kingdoms (1900) was one of the illustrated books on Egyptian archaeology on Freud's shelves. Its genealogy of the Pharaohs as photographed in sculp tured portraiture and mummies is of a piece with the medical and archaeological photography that was most familiar to Freud. In Steindorff, mummified bodies and sculptured portraits were brought together within a common format of photographic il lustrations. On one hand, the mummified head of Thutmosis II in the Cairo museum (fig. 2) is photographed according to the same norms as isolated sculptural fragments, as if it were a work of art. At the same time, the portrait resides in the body itself, and it is accompanied (captioned in the text) by a medical diagnosis, concluding that Thutmosis had probably suffered at length from a severe disease, which caused him to lose his hair before death (36). There is an interface here between the his torical human individual and his eternal, immortal self. Where mortality, immortality, exoticism, and the dead-come-to-life are overlaid in a single image, one senses Freud's unheimlich (1919). A dead man redivivus is immortal or "eternal." The explanatory text about the Pharaoh's hair, with its diagnostic assumptions, brings us back into the ambience of Jean-Martin Charcot's Salpêtrière and its particularly apposite uses of photography of the human body for medical and cultural interpretation. Carl Jung (1961) observed that mummies were powerful images of death in Freud's mind. Directly before sailing for the United States in 1909, Jung chatted with Freud about the natural mummification of humans in the peat bogs of northern</page><page sequence="6">190 Freud's Uncanny Egypt Figure 2. Europe and in the Bleikeller (lead cellar) of the Bremen Cathe dral. Jung maintained that Freud resisted the topic, and that in one discussion of these mummies over dinner Freud suddenly fainted, evidently because of the intensity of his own fantasies about these objects (156). Jung must have been right about the intensity of Freud's mummy fantasies because, upon his arrival in America, Freud visited New York's "China Town" and com mented that he was struck by the similarity of older Chinese men to "the mummies of Egyptian kings" (Togel 2002, 302). Egyptologists of the later nineteenth century examined the ancient dead, as mummies were unwrapped for study and duly photographed (Howe 1994, 41). In a kind of macabre strip tease, mummies were unwrapped before spellbound audi ences who witnessed the release of human figures from thick pads of wrapped cloth (Pringle 2001, 164-65). An anonymous photograph from the 1880s of the Mummy of Mahinpra (fig. Figure 2.</page><page sequence="7">Mary Bergstein 191 Figure 3. 3), for example, represents the unwrapped figure propped up and standing erect on a pedestal against a light neutral ground in the Cairo museum. The installation of the preserved body of Mahinpra on a pedestal for this photograph reinforces the ambiguity between statue and cadaver that so perplexed and enriched archaeological thinking of the time. It verges on the concept of a "statue-come-to-life." This theme, of course, calls to mind Freud's essay (1907) on Wilhelm Jensen's Gradiva, in which a Roman relief sculpture of a nymph uncannily first be comes a ghost and then a living girl to wed the archaeologist for whom it was an object of obsession. The interpretive reception of mummies as involuntary portraits fitted seamlessly into the tradition that governed the interpretation of all portraiture, including statuary, painting, and posed studio photographs of living people. The head of another important Pharaoh from the Cairo Museum appears on Steindorff's pages: a stone portrait of Amenhotep IV (Akhenat en) (fig. 4), found at El Amarna, is presented in a photographic composition that mirrors that of the mummified Thutmosis II. Figure 3.</page><page sequence="8">192 Freud's Uncanny Egypt Figure 4. Steindorff's text praises Akhenaten for having introduced the single supreme deity, Aten. Since most Europeans of the time were monotheists, Akhenaten's innovation was probably con sidered a precocious "discovery" of the single deity (the God of Judaism and Christianity) as opposed to merely an alteration in the style of ancient Egyptian worship practices. Although there is evidence of monotheism in Egypt long before Akhenaten's reign, the West regarded Akhenaten as the first Western-style monotheist (Said 2003, 33). How did illustrated books such as The Great Age, together with the archaeological photographs and the expectations em bedded in them, shape Freud's view of cultural history? In Moses and Monotheism (1939), Freud devised an ethnological profile of the Jews based upon their acceptance of the monotheistic, abstract religion of Akhenaten. Freud's eulogy of Akhenaten as a personality who was responsible for the spiritual and Figure 4.</page><page sequence="9">Mary Bergstein 193 philosophical advancement of humankind and the foundation of Judaism followed in the stream of arguments put forth by Egyptologists such as Steindorff. For Steindorff, the "portrait" of Akhenaten, a chiaroscuro photograph of a fragment of stone sculpture, revealed the enlightened historical personage who first proclaimed "a single God, creator of all life, the lord of the entire world" (1900, 144-46). Documentary photographs of Egyptian sculpture, mum mies, and men may well have fueled Freud proposal that Moses was an Egyptian. The purpose of Freud's "historical novel" was, in his own words, "directed to the single aim of introducing the figure of an Egyptian Moses into the nexus of Jewish history" (1939,52). Moses and Monothdsmwas written in a period of great stress just before the end of Freud's life, and it recapitulated Jewish and Mosaic themes that had haunted him for many years. Said (2003, 27-30) has called Moses and Monotheism a "Spätwerk" or a composition in Freud's late style, comparable to Beethoven's final string quartets, or Monet's Waterlilies series, which reached into the twentieth century.4 These are all open-ended works, highly expressionistic, with little interest in the satisfaction of mimesis, closure, or conclusion. The ethnological premise that Moses was an Egyptian was fragile. According to Freud (1939), Moses was an Egyptian aristocrat who gave his "chosen people," a Semitic tribe called the Levites, the monotheism that had been discovered in Egypt by the Pharaoh Ahmenhotep IV (known as Akhenaten). Jewish monotheism, which rejected magic, sorcery, and anthropomor phic representation of the deity, had come about, then, after a period of somewhat complicated historical latency, from Akhenaten's "Aten" religion (66). Freud claimed that, "in an astonishing presentiment of later scientific discovery [Akhenaten] recognized in the energy of solar radiation the source of all life on earth and worshiped it as a symbol of the power of his god" (1939, 59). As a scientist, Freud saw this as historical progress, an enormous step forward in Egyptian culture and in the civilization of humankind. For Freud the story of Moses was a dramatic historical saga of fili ation and parricide. It is pertinent that in the sixth year of his reign Akhenaten destroyed all the cartouches of his father, Ahmenhotep III, in what can readily be construed as an oedipal</page><page sequence="10">194 Freud's Uncanny Egypt gesture concomitant with the intellectual progress represented by the founding of his new, more abstract, religion (Spector 1972, 62-63). In Moses and Monotheism Akhenaten's view of the cosmos is held to have presaged Freud's own age of scientific discovery in Vienna. The Oedipus complex remains fixed in Freud's world historiography: Amenhotep IV had to become Akhenaten and reject his own patronymic as the successor to Amenhotep III. Freud's thesis that Moses was an Egyptian aristocrat from the circle of Akhenaten gave him the opportunity to character ize the modern Jews in terms of a revised historical ethnology. He stated that the Jews were not fundamentally different from Europeans, but rather they were the heirs to the Mediterranean civilizations from which they were descended and from whom they had retained phylogenetic memory traces: 'They are not Asiatics of a foreign race ... but composed for the most part of remnants of the Mediterranean peoples and heirs of the Mediter ranean civilization" (1939, 91). Freud's anxiety that the Jews not be considered "Asiatics" but rather as "civilized" Mediterraneans is a racialist absurdity that can be understood not only in terms of his education at a classical gymnasium but also as a conscious or unconscious response to Nazi racial policies and the Anschluss of 1938, under the direct impact of which Moses and Monotheism was written. It is possible, especially in light of Moses and Mono theism, that Freud searched for a Jewish ethnicity, including his own putative Mediterranean roots, in Egypt—an Egypt that was both the birthplace of Judaism and its uncanny opposite. The Philippson Bible Apropos Egypt as the timeless, uncanny other, a condensa tion of past and present exists also in Freud's personal visual ization of Egypt. Let us now work backwards from Freud's old age and maturity to his childhood. Using this approach, I shall argue that some of what blossomed in Freud's writings was preceded and foretold by his germinal visual experience with the Philippson Bible as a child. Ludwig and Phöbus Philippson's translation of the Hebrew Bible was the book from which Sigmund Freud was educated</page><page sequence="11">Mary Bergstein 195 in his earliest years by his father, Jakob Freud. Sigmund stud ied from these illustrated volumes from the age of seven until entering the Gymnasium nearly four years later (Davies and Fichtner 2006). So, more than a full decade before Heinrich Schliemann uncovered the ancient city of Troy, an event that impressed the seventeen-year old Freud deeply, he was already primed with vivid and extensive archaeological imagery, much of it in Egypt and Arabia. When he was re-gifted with the same family Bible at the age of thirty-five, in an expanded episode of déjà vu, the Philippson had already produced memory upon memory in Freud's imagination. The Hebrew inscription from his father at that time, together with numerous biblical refer ences, expresses the hope that his son will remember his boy hood attachment to the book. As an elderly bibliophile, with a profound knowledge of art and archaeology, Freud stated in his Autobiographical Study (1925) that his "deep engrossment in the Bible" (8) from the time he was learning to read had an enduring effect upon the direction of his interests. This is to say nothing about the imprint of its over 700 explanatory wood engravings, which illustrate the Pentateuch and the prophecies of the Bible, on his conscious and unconscious mind. What is significant is that these engravings illustrate the scriptures not by the portrayal of narrative scenes but rather by a kind of encyclopedic, historical, and "scientific" analogy. These pictures function to reconcile the translated texts with a geographic and historical reality of places, customs, and events recorded in the Bible. Ludwig Philippson's work is a masterpiece of graphic de sign, a great archive of image-text interface, authoritative in its scope and scale. For Philippson and his brother Phöbus, the scientific apparatus contributed to the phenomenon of the Jewish Enlightenment. Their scholarly enterprise strove to universalize ancient history in order to "make a world that unified the Jew, the Christian, and the Mohammedan" (1858, 1:26).5 The Philippsons' overwhelming reliance upon Orientalist imagery, romantic landscapes, and Egyptian antiquity reinforces the sense that what is presented here is a veritable encyclopedia of the Bible, illustrated by analogy and explained visually by way of ethnography, archaeology, and art.</page><page sequence="12">196 Freud's Uncanny Egypt In analyzing the only dream he remembered from his own childhood, Freud (1900) described an Egyptian image of a fu nerary bier from the Philippson Bible.6 In his account of this dream, his mother, "with a peculiarly peaceful, sleeping expres sion on her features," is being carried by elongated figures with birds' beaks "derived from the illustrations in the Philippsons' Bible" (583). Bird-headed Egyptian figures and funerary biers occur throughout the Philippsons' illustrations. Ana Maria Riz zuto (1998) is one of the few scholars of psychoanalysis to have studied the Philippson engravings. She speculates that a funer ary scene copied from an Egyptian Book of the Dead (Philippson 1858, 2:394) used to illustrate the account of Saul's burial (2 Samuel 3:31-35) might have been the source of Freud's child hood dream. Whether or not Rizzuto is correct, Freud speaks of "illustra tions" in the plural, so we may feel free to look at many illustra tions, those that might have attracted a seven-year-old child as well as those revisited by an adult in his reminiscences decades later. A splendid and fantastic example of bird-symbols occurs in Deuteronomy (4:20) (fig. 5), where precisely the injunction against graven images is articulated: For your own sake therefore, be most careful—since you saw no shape when the LORD your God spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire—not to act wickedly and make for yourselves a sculptured image in any likeness whatever: the form of a man or a woman, the form of any beast on earth, the form of any winged bird that flies in the sky, the form of anything that creeps on the ground, the form of any fish that is in the waters below the earth. (Philippson 1858, 1:871) Although this page is full of attractive visual information on sculpture and paintings made of the form of "winged birds that fly in the sky," the message to Jews is paradoxically "not to act wickedly and make for yourselves a sculptured image in any likeness whatever," a pairing or word and image that sets off the alterity of Egyptians as image-makers while at the same time representing their art as exquisite and fascinating.</page><page sequence="13">Mary Bergstein 197 Figure 5. In Why Did Freud Reject God? (1998), Rizznto proposes, among other theories, that Freud's habit of collecting ancient objects was ultimately motivated by a response to his father's death in 1896, and that the collected objects literally reified im ages known to Freud via Philippson (105-33). She has identified some correspondences between illustrations in the Philippson volumes and the sculptured antiquities that came to fill Freud's working spaces. Apropos the elongated human figures with birds' beaks first encountered in the family Bible, for example, she has observed that a statue of the bird-headed god Floras resided at Freud's side in the consulting room at Berggasse 19 (96-97). Whether or not Freud's collecting of Egyptian art was a reaction to the loss of his father, his own possessions naturally corresponded with the published images he studied throughout his lifetime, including the Philippson Bible as well as postcards Figure 5.</page><page sequence="14">198 Freud's Uncanny Egypt such as the one from Ferenczi and illustrations in the form of engravings and photographs in the many books constituting his archaeological library. Landscapes of Antiquity The landscape of Egyptian antiquity and its modern descendants—the latter seen through a romanticist ethno graphic lens—extends throughout the encyclopedic volumes of the Philippson translation, providing Freud as well as other German-speaking Jews with a particular forma mentis situated within the context of the Hebrew Bible. Much as this material was received as an historical explanation of Jewish antiquity, it was also eminently exportable from the religious sphere into a greater secular view of the natural and cultural world. The Philippson Bible provided a jumping-off point for the study of natural history, art, classical antiquity, Egyptian antiquity, and what we would now refer to as cultural anthropology. Diane O'Donoghue has proposed that the Philippson images furnished not only Freud's earliest textual and visual constructions of Jewish identity but also his first taste of the history of art and of Mediterranean archaeology, topics that were to arouse his interest and flourish in the vocabulary of psychoanalytic theory for the duration of his life.7 The volumes are striking for the rebus-like configurations of their pages, the way the wood engravings condense representations of important works of natural history, art, and architecture, and for their complex word-image relationship, which ramifies throughout the interpretive scholarship in the apparatus of notes and il lustrations. In The Aetiology of Hysteria (1896), Freud posited his famous "archaeological metaphor": Imagine that an explorer arrives in a little-known region where his interest is aroused by an expanse of ruins, with the remains of walls, fragments of columns, and tablets with half-effaced and unreadable inscriptions. He may content himself with inspecting what lies exposed to view, with questioning the inhabitants—perhaps semi-barbaric</page><page sequence="15">Mary Bergstein 199 people—who live in the vicinity, about what tradition tells them of the history and meaning of these archaeological remains, and with noting down what they tell him—and he may then proceed on his journey. But he may act dif ferenüy. (192) Inscriptions, half-effaced and unreadable, are featured in an engraving published by the Philippsons: "Rocks with Inscriptions at Wady Mokkateb." This picture (fig. 6) features a spectacular mountainous landscape with fallen ruins, a small group of in digenous nomadic people, and a wall of rock art; it accompanies the text from Job 19:23-25, "Oh, that my words were written down; would they were inscribed on tablets, forever engraved in stone, with iron stylus and lead! But I know that my Vindicator lives; in the end He will testify on earth." The engraving published here by the Philippsons was already embedded in an Orientalist tradition as it flourished in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. It is derived from an image by Léon de Laborde of the so-called "Written Mountains" (Gebel al Mokkateb) at Wady Mokkateb on the Sinai Peninsula. Laborde's sketches were made on an expedition in 1828 and published as wood engravings and lithographs in his Journey through Arabia Petraea to Mount Sinai and the Excavated City of Petra, the Edom of the Prophecies (1836). At Wady Mokkateb the inscriptions, some of which were pictographs, were carved into the living-rock reddish sandstone that had a uniform, soft, depatinated surface, and were possibly filled with hammered lead. Laborde quotes the Franciscan ex plorer Tomaso da Novara who said that the characters inscribed on these rocks were "unintelligible" (1836,252) to the men in his company despite their knowledge of many languages, including Arabic, Greek, Hebrew, Syriac, Coptic, Latin, Armenian, Turkish, English, Illyriac, Bohemian, and German. Laborde regarded the epigraphy and images as a great unsolved puzzle that awaited further research in paleography. In a scene where the human figures are proportionately tiny compared to the engraved rock-face and loose stones at this site—a place so removed, says Novara, that there is nothing to eat or to drink, and no reason for anyone to be there—the wall of half-effaced and unreadable inscriptions poses a mystery to be deciphered.</page><page sequence="16">200 Freud's Uncanny Egypt Stlf« »It im »rtf — tatet»». Figure 6. The romanticism intrinsic to the engraving, with its vast chiaroscuro impression, is reflected in Laborde's elegiac intu itions about the simultaneous "infancy" and "decline" of the visual arts in Egypt: The figures of men and animals, which accompany the characters, are partly of the same date with the original inscriptions; others appear to be of our own age. They all indicate the infancy of the art, if, indeed there be anything in them resembling that which we call art. In this country, the first essays and the decline in the art of design seem to coincide without having any stage between them. (1836, 252) "The Bedouin," he continues, "while watching the camels, will now draw men and animals as his ancestors drew them in the most remote times" (252). At the heart of the European view of the east is the Orientalist premise that nothing ever changes there. The nomads were a melancholic, primitive people in Figure 6.</page><page sequence="17">Mary Bergstein 201 the sixth century BCE, and they remain so today. Laborde's tenor is one of ponderous romanticism; he himself wore Arab garb while traveling in the desert and depicts himself thus on the title page of the book. His commentaries on the natural history of Sinai, the Bedouin mentality, and the condition of various ruins are mirrored in the pages of the Philippson Bible in several illustrations. In the desert, waxes Laborde, there is something about a group of chieftains in procession that is "antique and scriptural," like 'Jacob and his sons on the way to Egypt" or "the Magi ar riving from remote regions." They evoke "those kings of Arabia so often mentioned in the Bible" (1836, 125). A young slave, serving the explorer's party rice and lamb, "reminded us, by his features and attitudes, of the graceful paintings seen on the Egyptian monuments." In a salient example of racial tourism, this equation of a contemporary Egyptian with the figures in Old-Kingdom tomb paintings is followed in Laborde's text by a small line drawing of a boy's head and shoulders that seems to be copied from an Egyptian mural painting (127-28). The views of Mount Sinai in volume one of Philippson (1858,1:403-4) are also taken from the engravings in Laborde's Journey through Arabia. This reliance on Laborde, seen also in other illustrations, exemplifies the fact that the Philippson workshop in Leipzig borrowed many of its pictures from the great illustrated compendia of knowledge that were published in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. On September 10, 1908, Freud wrote to his family from London that he spent from ten in the morning to noon in the Egyptian collections of the British Museum, and "not yet com pletely cured," went back in the afternoon at about three (Tögel 2002, 243-44). Ernest Jones reports (1955, 52) that during that week Freud spent every evening reading up for his next day's museum visit. Freud, of course, had been primed for the recep tion of the Egyptian works of art in the British Museum by his early childhood "studies" as well as subsequent research. One such image familiar to Freud from the Philippson Bible would have been a group of fragments of a banquet scene from the Theban tomb of Nebamun, who served as accountant to the high priests at the Temple of Amun in Thebes. Dating to ca. 1350 BCE, these are colorful scenes arranged in several</page><page sequence="18">202 Freud's Uncanny Egypt registers, of which the British Museum has conserved three fragments since the 1820s. The girls in the particular fragment reproduced in Philipp son (fig. 7), entitled Aegyptisch.es Gastmahl vonDamen. Nach einer alt-ägyptischen Malerei im Brittischen Museum, (Egyptian Banquet of Women: After an Ancient Egyptian Painting in the British Museum), are shown with elaborate hairstyles with headdresses crowned with crests (of fat?) on their heads and lotus flowers and drinking glasses in their hands. In context, the scene is used to illustrate Egyptian banqueting customs in the story of Joseph: "They served [Joseph] by himself, and them by them selves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves; for the Egyptians could not dine with the Hebrews since that would be abhorrent to the Egyptians" (Gen. 43:31-33). A few of the girls turn to their companions, placing either a lotus flower or a small fruit under their noses. Some of the scenes have been interpreted in our own time as sexual allego ries referring to human fertility or rebirth after death, which the tomb was in part designed to ensure. Although the scenes shown here may indeed have something to do with a religious ritual or sexual initiation, the emphasis seems to be on worldly pleasure represented in naturalistic terms. But how does such naturalistic representation come to find a place in ajewish Bible? Was notjudaism an aniconic religion? The practice of objectivity in the Jewish Enlightenment involved stepping back from the close view of an object and seeing works of art in a historical, encyclopedic manner. The Philippson strategy is subtle and eminently modern. Intellectual distance between visual represen tations and the religious history is established by the specificity of each caption, citing the art-historical source of every image, as if putting the wood-engraved pictures in quotation marks. In this way, the sacred text is illustrated as if by analogy to the visual arts, and always in a non-narrative manner. Historians of psychoanalysis led by Harry Trosman (1975) have spoken of the roots in Romantic classicism of Freud's visual aesthetics. We may speculate that this orientation was to some extent a product of Freud's childhood immersion in the Philippson Bible, especially in the engravings illustrating Lam entations, in which several fervidly Romantic views of Greco Roman ruins are used to envision the destruction of Jerusalem.</page><page sequence="19">Mary Bergstein 203 t&gt; e n 'S) a m c n. 9îad&gt; einer alt« äg^jjtifdjen Malerei im 2h'HHf$eu $Nfeum. @92 ^ Figure 7. Egyptian and Greco-Roman cultures are compared but not polarized throughout the pages of the Philippson Bible, and neither anthropomorphic tradition is deprecated according to aniconic precepts. This is nowhere more evident than in the Psalms, where King David is analogized as the marble statue of Apollo Musagetes (leader of the Muses) from the Vatican Museum (Pio Clementino). This Apollo, who himself resembles a muse, plays a kithara and is crowned with laurels. There is no heroic or erotic nudity here. Only the flayed Marsyas that embellishes the edge of the lyre is without clothing or skin. The Hadrianic marble statue was excavated near Tivoli in 1774 in the ruins of the Villa di Cassio. So Apollo Musagetes, like the Philippson Bible itself, belongs to the Golden Age of archaeological finds, and was still somewhat fresh and thrilling in 1858. The scene of an Egyptian harpist (fig. 8) that accompanies the Psalms of David (Psalm 33) is copied from one of the wall paintings at Thebes, Byran el Molouk, from the "Tomb of the Harps." Its source was the Description of Egypt (1809-1822), a multi-volume, multi-authored compendium, the fruit of Napo leon's mission to Egypt with the French Army. The Description of Egypt was an important source of the Philippsons' Bible, just Figure 7.</page><page sequence="20">204 Freud's Uncanny Egypt Figure 8. as it provided copious documentary and decorative images to nineteenth-century Europe. The group of Shabti figures in the Philippson Bible (1858, 1:873), for instance, which Rizzuto (1998, 121) believes provoked Freud's personal collection of Shabtis, are copied from the upper register of "Thébes, Hy pogées" in the Description of Egypt, where they are called "idols and fragments in sycamore wood painted in various colors" (1809-1822, vol. 2, plate 76). And in Vienna Gustav Klimt (1862-1918), following the historicist program of the galleries of Egyptian sculpture, took as his models for paintings for the spandrels and intercolumnial spaces of the grand staircase of the Kunsthistorisches Museum, commissioned in 1890, images culled from the Description (Haslauer 2007, 89-93). In Psalm 33 there is a certain factual, if not literal, quality to the pairing of word and image in Philippson: "Praise the Lord with the lyre; with the ten-stringed harp sing to him." There are eleven strings on the Theban harp depicted here, but it nevertheless seems selected for its antiquarian accuracy to the biblical songs. Verse 2 is followed by a page of examples of ancient Egyptian harps drawn from various documentary Figure 8.</page><page sequence="21">Mary Bergstein 205 line drawings by the Italian Egyptologist Ippolito Rosellini, who went to Egypt in the Franco-Tuscan expedition with Campol lion in 1828. Rosellini recorded and reproduced his drawings in a two-volume compendium entitled The Monuments of Egypt and Nubia (1832). Rosellini's drawings from the wall-paintings of the tomb of the Vizir Rekhmira, which explain the production of bricks used in building, shows up in Philippson to illustrate Exodus 5:14, where Hebrew slaves were making bricks under the harsh taskmasters of the Egyptian Pharoah. It was probably selected because Rosellini identified the workers as Jewish slaves due to their apparent physiognomic diversity and their beards (1832, l:xlix, 1). More recent archaeology sees these figures rather as Syrians, not necessarily slaves or prisoners. The Philippsons made apt use of Rosellini's reproductive drawings of Egyptian tomb paintings to illustrate biblical Jews enslaved to the Egyp tian Pharaohs. Sephardic Women and Jewish Orientalism To conclude this series of prolegomena let us consider briefly the style and status of women as illustrated in the Philippson Bible. The daughters of Zion are depicted in an exotic and sometimes even strangely invented manner. The blurring of Muslim and Jewish femininity contributes to the phenomenon of what may be called 'Jewish Orientalism" in eighteenth-, ninteenth-, and twentieth-century Europe. According to the prophecies of Isaiah, God will be enraged at the Jews and "uncover the heads of the daughters of Zion" (Philippson 1858, 3:18-24). To expose a woman's head in pub lic was an intolerable humiliation in traditional Judaism. Isaiah announces that, "In that day, my lord will strip off the finery of the anklets, the fillets, and the crescents; of the earrings, bracelets, and veils; the turbans, the armlets and the sashes; of the talismans and amulets; the signet rings and the nose rings, the festive robes, the mantels, and the shawls." This prophecy is one of the passages in Philippson's Bible that is richly illus trated with women, presumably Jewish, who resemble Egyptian dancers and singers (fig. 9).</page><page sequence="22">206 Freud's Uncanny Egypt ob« iKuä3i&gt;stiM)t Mmulttu. »aä SÇiâam »Ufr ncadjout.

They wear tattoos, nose-rings, necklaces, veils, and headdresses. All of these costumes were prevalent in contemporaneous Egypt, Arabia, and the Maghreb, and such ethnography would soon become familiar through nineteenth century "documentation," as in the famous photograph of veiled or nude women by Pascal Sebah during the 1880s. But the visual field was not limited to Muslim women. Jewish women from the Levant were also photographed, especially by the French, for whom they were colonial subjects, and their reproductions published in collectible travel photographs and ethnographic postcards. Dimitri Tarazi et Fils, a firm based in Jerusalem as well as Beirut and Damascus, produced images such as the "Young Jewish Syrian Woman," "Young Jewish Woman in Beirut," or the "Dance of Jewish Women in Egypt" (fig. 10). Photos such as "Eastern Types" represented Jewish women from Gabès, the Tunisian port city that had a large Jewish community from Ro man antiquity until the anti-Jewish riots of 1942.

Women of Gabés" from about 1900 are shown heavily bedecked with silver jewelry, and one of them paints her feet with henna (fig. 11). Such images were, and still are, often mistaken for scenes of Muslim harems, which were off-limits to European photographers. These women embody the uncanny opposite of European Jewish womanhood in the nineteenth century. They are neither impoverished shtetldwellers in coarse wool shawls nor assimilated urban women in their gloves, hats, and corsets. Rather, depicted as leventine exotics, like the Islamic women of Egypt, Arabia, and the Maghreb, they belong to the large body of images that configure Egypt as what Elfriede Haslauer has called the "land of longing" (2007, 94-95). The portrayal of oriental women in visual culture, whether they be veiled, naked, pierced, smoking, tattooed, or adorned with gold, affords the viewer a glimpse of feminine sexuality that diverges from the norm exemplified by European women constrained by the Victorian strictures that Freud regarded as a cause of their complexes and neuroses. As the years passed, Freud fed his curiosity about Egyptian art and archaeology with the books on the topic in his personal Figure 10.</page><page sequence="24">208 Freud's Uncanny Egypt Figure 11. library and the hours he whiled away perusing museum col lections. But as he paged through the Philippson Bible, the Egyptian images used to illustrate the Hebrew text assumed a place of dialectical otherness in Freud's conception of ancient Jewish history, as Assman has elucidated. The commonality formed by Greco-Roman antiquity, Jewish antiquity, and ancient Egypt became at once strange and "natural" to a child for whom the Phillipsons' compendium was a reading primer. What may perhaps now be somewhat less difficult to fathom is that this child should at the end of his life write a dark "historical novel" in which he hypothesized that Moses was an Egyptian.
